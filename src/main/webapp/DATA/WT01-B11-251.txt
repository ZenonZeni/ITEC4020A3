<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">Except with respect to Ready Cash
Investment Fund, Shares become entitled to receive dividends on
the next Fund Business Day after acceptance of an order and are
not entitled to receive dividends declared after the day on which
their redemption becomes effective. Ready Cash Investment Fund
Shares become entitled to receive dividends on the day of the
acceptance of an order and are not entitled to receive dividends
declared on or after the day on which their redemption becomes
effective.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">Dividends of net investment income
currently are declared and paid at least annually by each Fund
in accordance with the Fund's dividend policy. For Intermediate
U.S. Government Fund, Total Return Bond Fund and Stable Income
Fund, dividends currently are declared and paid monthly and for
Ready Cash Investment Fund are declared daily and paid monthly.
Each Fund's net capital gain, if any, is distributed at least
annually, typically in December.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">Shareholders may choose to have
dividends and distributions of a Fund reinvested in shares of
that Fund (the &quot;Reinvestment Option&quot;), to receive dividends
and distributions in cash (the &quot;Cash Option&quot;) or to
direct dividends and distributions to be reinvested in shares
of another fund of the Trust(the &quot;Directed Dividend Option&quot;).
Plan, IRA and KEOGH accounts are automatically assigned the Reinvestment
Option. All dividends and distributions are treated in the same
manner for Federal income tax purposes whether received in cash
or reinvested in shares of a fund.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">Under the Reinvestment Option,
all dividends and distributions of a Fund are automatically invested
in additional Shares of that Fund. All dividends and distributions
are reinvested at a Fund's net asset value as of the payment date
of the dividend or distribution. Shareholders are assigned this
option unless one of the other two options is selected. Under
the Cash Option, all dividends and distributions are paid to the
shareholder in cash. Under the Directed Dividend Option, shareholders
of a Fund whose shares in a single account of that Fund total
$10,000 or more may elect to have all dividends and distributions
reinvested in shares of another fund of the Trust, provided that
those shares are eligible for sale in the shareholder's state
of residence. For further information concerning the Directed
Dividend Option, shareholders should contact the Transfer Agent.

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Bold">Taxation of the Funds. </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">Each
Fund is treated as a separate corporation for Federal tax purposes
and intends to continue to qualify for each fiscal year as a regulated
investment company under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended. In addition, each Fund intends to distribute all of its
net investment income and capital gain each year. Accordingly,
it is anticipated that the Funds will not be liable for Federal
income or excise taxes on their net investment income and capital
gain.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Bold">International Fund-International
Portfolio. </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">International
Portfolio is not required to pay Federal in-come taxes on its
net investment income and capital gain, as it is treated as a
partnership for Federal tax purposes. All interest, dividends
and gains and losses of International Portfolio are deemed to
have been &quot;passed through&quot; to International Fund in
proportion to its holdings of International Portfolio, regardless
of whether such interest, dividends or gains have been distributed
by International Portfolio or losses have been realized by the
International Portfolio. Investment income received by International
Fund from sources within foreign countries may be subject to foreign
income or other taxes. International Fund intends to elect, if
eligible to do so, to permit its shareholders to take a credit
(or adeduction) for foreign income and other taxes paid by International
Portfolio. Shareholders of Inter-national Fund will be notified
of their share of those taxes and will be required to include
that amount as income. In that event, the shareholder may be entitled
to claim a credit or deduction for those taxes.<BR>

<B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="FranklinGothic-Demi">SHAREHOLDER TAX MATTERS</FONT></B>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Bold">General. </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">Dividends
paid by a Fund out of its net investment income (including any
realized net short-term capital gain) are taxable to shareholders
as ordinary income. Distributions by a Fund of realized net long-term
capital gain, if any, are taxable to shareholders as long-term
capital gain, regardless of the length of time the shareholder
may have held shares in the Fund at the time of distribution.
If Fund shares are sold at a loss after being held for 6 months
or less, the loss will be treated as long-term capital loss to
the extent of any long-term capital gain distribution received
on those shares.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">All capital gain distributions
paid by a Fund and all dividends paid by a Fund (except Total
Return Bond Fund and Ready Cash Investment Fund) and received
by a shareholder reduce the net asset value of the shareholder's
shares by the amount of the distribution or dividend. Furthermore,
a dividend or distribution made shortly after the purchase of
shares by a shareholder, although in effect a return of capital
to that particular shareholder, would be taxable to the shareholder
as described above.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">It is expected that a substantial
portion of the dividends to shareholders of each Equity Fund,
except International Fund, and a portion of each Balanced Fund's
dividends to shareholders will qualify for the dividends received
deduction for corporations. The amount of such dividends eligible
for the dividends received deduction is limited to the amount
of dividends from domestic corporations received during a Fund's
fiscal year. To the extent International Fund invests in the securities
of domestic issuers, the dividends to shareholders of the Fund
may qualify for the dividends received deduction for corporations.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">The Funds may be required by Federal
law to withhold 31 percent of reportable payments (which may include
taxable dividends, capital gain distributions and redemption proceeds)
paid to individuals and certain other non-corporate shareholders.
Withholding is not required if a shareholder certifies that the
shareholder's social security or tax identification number provided
to the Trust is correct and that the shareholder is not subject
to backup withholding for prior under-reporting to the Internal
Revenue Service.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">Reports containing appropriate
information with respect to the Federal income tax status of dividends
and distributions paid during the year by the Funds will be mailed
to shareholders shortly after the close of each year.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Bold">Tax-Deferred Accounts. </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">Dividends
or distributions of net long-term capital gain, if any, paid with
respect to the shares of a Fund held by a tax-deferred account
will not be taxable to that account. Currently, distributions
from such accounts will be taxable to individual participants
under applicable tax rules without regard to the character of
the income earned by the account.<BR>
