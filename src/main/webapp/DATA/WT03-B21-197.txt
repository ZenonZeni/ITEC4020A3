<P><B>SUMMARY OF FINANCIAL AND OPERATING RESULTS</B>


<P>TVX Gold Inc. reported a net loss for the third quarter ended September 30, 1996 of US$23.3 million (US$0.14 per share), compared to net earnings US$1.3 million (US$0.01 per share) in the third quarter of 1995.  Net loss for the nine month period was US$13.2 million (US$0.08 per share) compared to net earnings of US$9.8 million (US$0.06 per share) in the corresponding 1995 period. During the quarter, the Company, as part of its ongoing review of its global operations, suspended the mining and milling operations at its Mineral Hill mine and placed the operation under care and maintenance.  As a result, the Company took a US$29 million one-time charge to earnings.  This charge was partially offset by gains on the disposition of minority equity investments which were primarily responsible for the other income of US$7.7 million.

<P>Gold equivalent production for the three months ended September 30, 1996 was 108,000 ounces (78,800 ounces of gold and 2,224,000 ounces of silver) compared to 94,300 ounces (80,300 ounces of gold and 1,042,000 ounces of silver) during the same period in 1995.  Year to date production was 320,700 gold equivalent ounces compared to 311,100 gold equivalent ounces in 1995.

<P>Average realized revenue on gold equivalent sales of 92,900 ounces during the third quarter of 1996 was US$407 per ounce compared to US$383 per ounce on 107,900 gold equivalent ounces sold in the third quarter of 1995.

<P>Cash costs per ounce on a gold equivalent basis for the third quarter of 1996 increased over the same period of 1995 to US$239 from US$218, principally due to the reduction of mill throughput attributed to the hardness of ore encountered at La Coipa, the Company's principal mine and the high cost of production realized at the Mineral Hill mine prior to operations being suspended there, partially offset by the removal of contract miners at the Brasília mine and the diminished use of contractors at the Casa Berardi mine.

<FONT SIZE=+1><CENTER><B>OPERATIONS REVIEW</B></CENTER></FONT>

<P><B>LA COIPA</B>

<P>The Company's share of gold equivalent production from the La Coipa mine in Chile in the third quarter of 1996 was 53,900 ounces (24,700 ounces of gold and 2,224,000 ounces of silver) compared to 46,700 ounces (32,700 ounces of gold and 1,042,000 ounces of silver) in the  corresponding 1995 period. Cash costs for the period, on a gold equivalent basis, increased to US$185 per ounce as compared to US$169 in the same period of 1995. The increase in cash costs is principally due to the reduction of mill throughput attributed to the hardness of ore encountered during the quarter.  

<P><B>CRIXÁS</B>

<P>The Company's share of gold production from the Crixás mine in Brazil was 15,700 ounces in the third quarter of 1996 compared to 16,500 ounces in the corresponding 1995 period.  Cash costs per ounce of gold for the period were US$182 compared to US$164 in the previous year. The increase in cash costs at the Crixás mine is primarily due to lower grade ore being encountered in 1996.

<P><B>BRASÍLIA</B>

<P>The Company's share of gold production from the Brasília mine in Brazil was 14,000 ounces in the third quarter of 1996 compared to 13,600 ounces in the corresponding 1995 period.  Cash costs per ounce of gold for the period were US$191 compared to US$229 for the corresponding 1995 period.  The decrease in cash costs at the Brasília mine is primarily due to continued efficiencies achieved as a result of the removal of  contract mining and the introduction of the larger tonnage fleet of trucks.    

<P><B>MINERAL HILL</B>

<P>During the quarter, the Company announced the suspension of mining and milling at its wholly-owned Mineral Hill mine in Montana, U.S.A.  The Company stated that the continued losses and capital expenditures necessary to continue the current operations at Mineral Hill are not justifiable.  TVX Mineral Hill will, however, continue the surface drilling program at Crevice Mountain to enable the Company to properly assess this resource which may justify mining on this project in the future.  Production at the mine decreased as a result of mining lower grade ore and an ongoing shortfall in mill feed from the main Mineral Hill mine.  As a result, cash operating costs at the mine had risen to US$524 on a year to date basis.  Year to date production amounted to 17,300 ounces of gold. Contributing to this situation were delays encountered in the Crevice tunnel drive, principally due to unexpected water inflows.  For these reasons, the mine, mill and associated facilities were placed on a care and maintenance basis.  The decision to suspend operations at Mineral Hill resulted in a charge to third quarter earnings of the Company of approximately US$29 million ($0.18 a share), including provision for future site reclamation.

<P><B>CASA BERARDI</B>

<P>The Company's share of production from the Casa Berardi mine in Quebec, Canada was 11,300 ounces in the third quarter compared to 8,300 ounces in the corresponding 1995 period. Cash costs per ounce of gold for the period were US$354 compared to US$612 in the previous year.  The decrease in cash costs is primarily attributed to the diminished use of contractors on site.    

<P><B>NEW BRITANNIA</B>

<P>The Company's share of production from the New Britannia mine in Manitoba, Canada was 9,200 ounces.  The mine commenced commercial production on August 1.  Cash costs for the months of August and September were US$316.  Underground production is increasing steadily with the ramp advance to the 650m level completed during the quarter.

<P><B>KASSANDRA MINES</B>

<P>The Company recently announced that the blockade which had been preventing full access to the Olympias mine at the Company's Kassandra project in Greece was lifted.  Certain of the communities and residents in the area of the Olympias mine had been blocking full access to the operations over concerns about mining in the area.  As a result of negotiations between senior Greek Government representatives and representatives of the said communities, the blockade was lifted and TVX Hellas, the Company's wholly-owned Greek subsidiary, commenced moving materials and equipment to the Olympias site to refurbish and reopen the mine and to plan the construction of the gold recovery plant.  During the quarter, ore production from the Madem Lakkos mine was ongoing, supplying feed to the Stratoni mill.  Lead / silver and zinc concentrates continue to be shipped from the Stratoni port.

<P><B>MUSSELWHITE</B>

<P>At the Company's 32% owned Musselwhite project, Placer Dome Canada Limited, joint venture partner and operator, continues construction with substantial completion of the tailings dams, plant site surfacing and the pouring of the concrete foundation for the primary crusher achieved during the quarter.  The mill building cladding and roof sheathing are now also completed.  The construction project continues to be on schedule and below budget with production anticipated to commence in April 1997.

<P><B>KASPERSKE HORY</B>

<P>Underground exploration drilling continued at TVX Gold's 100% owned Kasperske Hory project in the Czech Republic.  During the three month period, 160 metres of underground drifting and 3,840 metres of underground diamond drilling were completed.  The diamond drilling was directed towards exploring the westerly strike extension of the main auriferous zone.  Results to date have confirmed the presence of mineralization with drill intersections of similar grade and width to those obtained in 1995.  In addition to the exploration diamond drilling, a series of closely spaced small diameter holes drilled from the 700 metre level have shown the mineralization to be continuous over greater than 300 metres.  During the remainder of 1996, underground development and diamond drilling will continue to be concentrated on adding to the resource base by exploring to the west of the known mineralization.

<P>A pre-feasibility study being conducted by Davy International is scheduled to be completed during the fourth quarter of 1996.  As part of the pre-feasibility study, Lakefield Research, Ontario, Canada is conducting a series of metallurgical tests to determine the optimal gold recovery methodology.

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=+1><B>LIQUIDITY AND CASH FLOW</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>Operating activities in the third quarter of 1996 used $0.8 million, down from generating $16.9 million in the corresponding 1995 period, due to higher production costs and a 14% decrease in ounces sold as a result of delays in realizing sales at La Coipa.  Working capital requirements utilized $6.2 million primarily due to the payment of interest on the US$150 million unsecured Notes issued in January 1996, and inventory increases at La Coipa.  Excess inventories at La Coipa are expected to be sold in early 1997.

<P>In the third quarter of 1996, investing activities for mining property, plant and equipment increased to $42.6 million from $25.1 million in the same period in 1995.  These increases are related to the Kassandra mines assets, which were acquired in late 1995, and the development of the Musselwhite project.  Proceeds on investments of $17.9 million were the result of the Company liquidating its minority interest in publicly traded mining companies.  In 1995, the Company had acquired minority interest investments for $11.1 million.

<P>Financing activities utilized $1.1 million in cash compared to generating $5.2 million in 1995 when the Company commenced the drawdown of the New Britannia financing.

<HR>

<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>NORMAL COURSE ISSUER BID</FONT></B></CENTER>

<P>The Company filed a Notice of Intention (the "Notice") to make a normal course issuer bid (the "Bid") with The Toronto Stock Exchange (the "TSE") which was accepted by the TSE on August 16, 1996.  In the Notice, the Company provided for the purchase of up to a maximum of 5,000,000 common shares of its issued capital through the facilities of the TSE.  Such purchases are to be made at market prices at the time of purchase with the Bid expiring on the earlier of the date determined by the Company and August 19, 1997.  The Bid gives the Company the flexibility to purchase its shares for cancellation if it determines that, as a result of the difference between its view of the fundamental value of the shares and the market price, it is in the best interest of the Company to do so.  Shareholders may obtain a copy of the Notice, without charge, by contacting the Company.  To date the Company has purchased 604,000 shares.
