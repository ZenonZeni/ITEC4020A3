 <IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> AGING </H2>

<P>Aging is a continuous process of gradual loss of functionality associated with chronic inflammation. The body has an enormous capacity to repair damage if given a  little  help  from  our  diets,  supplements,  reasonable exercise and good skin care.  Some of the oxygen we breathe is converted to dangerous free radicals. Our skin is exposed to numerous toxins every minute of every day. Free radicals damage our DNA, which results in aging and disease. This does not have to happen, especially at the rate it is happening today. It can be controlled.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> AGING SKIN</H2>
<P> The skin ages due to DNA damage, which is induced by both chemical and physical means. The first signs we see in any individual in regards to aging is their skin.  The first signs we see are structural changes like wrinkles and sagging then color and texture changes. Red spots and dilated veins appear. Brown spots appear on hands and face and the skin becomes thinner and less elastic. Structural changes result when collagen and elastin quantity and quality are reduced. Your skin is an open book to your state of health. Of all things the skin tells us the most about a person.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> SKIN PHYSIOLOGY </H2>
<P>Your skin is not just a covering for the body, it is your largest organ. It is a dynamic, ever growing organ that is vital to your existence. It must remain healthy to keep the good things in and the bad things out. It serves to control your body heat and acts as a kind of garbage disposal for the body.  That is. it is a major organ of detoxification. Our skin controls the rate of water loss from our body and prevents water from the outside from entering our body as well.  The FOREVER YOUNG TOTAL SKIN CARE SYSTEM can be a major factor in your efforts to maintain healthy skin and to feel better about your appearance for years to come.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> THE SCIENCE </H2>
<P>The science behind the FOREVER YOUNG TOTAL SKIN CARE SYSTEM is based on a thorough knowledge of skin physiology and the real biological needs of the body to maintain itself in good repair. Since skin is damaged both from the inside and outside the body,  a  system  that  recognizes  the  need  for comprehensive treatment, to correct the combined problems simultaneously, is the only one that can be truly effective.   The  FOREVER YOUNG TOTAL  SKIN CARE SYSTEM meets these requirements by supplying you with the most sophisticated skin care system modern science has ever achieved.  The FOREVER YOUNG TOTAL  SKIN CARE SYSTEM topically corrects underlying skin damaged by assisting the body's repair mechanism to restore the skin to a youthful appearance; then, internally helps in  preventing further damage by blocking and neutralizing free radical activity with powerful antioxidants.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> WHAT TO EXPECT</H2> 
<P>There are two things that determine the result you obtain. The first is based on your commitment. The second is based on the degree of damage you now have. The more severe the damage, the longer it will take. Many years of sunbathing or heavy smoking produce leathery skin that takes longer to repair, but positive results can be achieved if you  continue  the  program.   While  most  users  see results in as little as a month, others will require three to four months. Using it twice a day will produce better results than using it once daily.</P>

<P>Suggested Use: For the face, cleanse morning and at bedtime with EMOLLIENT CLEANSER, then apply FACIAL PERFECTING GEL followed with DAY/NIGHT RENEWAL COMPLEX.</P>
<P>For the body, cleanse skin with the BODY SPONGE when showering or bathing. Also apply BODY PERFECTION LOTION to soften and moisturize the skin. Apply to specific areas to reduce cellulite.</P>
