GEORGIA APP. CT. REVERSES
DEFENSE VERDICT FOR
GEORGIA POWER, OGLETHORP

     Holding that the trial court impermissibly allowed defense
witnesses to enter hearsay testimony regarding the opinions of
unidentified, non-testifying witnesses, the Georgia Court of
Appeals on Nov. 30 unanimously reversed a defense verdict in an
EMF personal injury suit against Georgia Power Co. and Oglethorp
Power Co.  Jordan v. Georgia Power Co. et al., No. A95A1585
(GA Ct. App.).

     The appeals court, however, affirmed the grant of summary
judgment to the defendants on plaintiff Larry and Nancy Jordan's
trespass claim, and sustained Douglas County Superior Court Judge
David T. Emerson's directed verdict on the Jordans' nuisance and
property damage claims.

     Although the Jordans offered expert testimony from an
electrical engineer who said EMF radiation is tangible because it
obeys physical laws and can be measured, the appeals court said
it must affirm the trial court because of a lack of evidence that
EMFs can constitute a physical trespass.  "Although the Jordans'
trespass action could present a jury question, we conclude that
for policy reasons the trial court's grant of summary judgment
was proper," the panel said.  "The scientific evidence regarding
whether EMFs cause harm of any kind is inconclusive; the invasive
quality of these electric fields cannot presently constitute a
trespass."

     The appeals court cautioned that its ruling was not intended
to "close the door on the possibility that science may advance to
a point at which damage from EMFs is legally cognizable and a
trespass action may lie."

     The grounds for reversing the verdict, the appeals court
said, was the testimony by defense experts Drs. Richard Bland and
Saul Rosenberg that the scientific-medical community did not
consider magnetic fields from power lines a cause of lymphomas in
general, or of non-Hodgkins lymphoma (as suffered by Nancy
Jordan), in particular.  The panel said such testimony should
have been confined to each doctor's personal belief that Mrs.
Jordan's disease was not caused by magnetic fields from power
lines.

     "Though it was proper for the court to allow the doctors'
testimony regarding their own opinions of the cause of Mrs.
Jordan's illness, the court committed reversible error in
admitting this 'consensus' testimony," the panel said in an
opinion by Presiding Judge Marion T. Pope.  "Neither Dr. Bland
nor Dr. Rosenberg clearly identified the 'community' of experts
for which he was speaking, nor did either doctor precisely
explain the method by which he ascertained the 'consensus.'"

     Citing the Georgia Court of Appeals' 1994 ruling in In the
Interest of A.S.M., the opinion said "an expert may give an
opinion upon the facts testified to by other witnesses, but not
upon their opinions.  A witness' opinion must be his own and he
cannot act as a mere conduit for the opinions of others."

     The appeals court also considered the Jordans' claim that 27
of the 36 persons in their jury pool should have been
disqualified because they belong to Greystone Power Co.
cooperative, which receives all of its power from Oglethorp.  The
trial court should disqualify Greystone members, the appeals
court said, if the Jordans submit evidence that Greystone bylaws
vest in its members the right to share surplus revenues.

     The plaintiffs are represented by Robert E. Shields of
Doffermyre, Shields, Canfield & Knowles in Atlanta; Bruce
DeBoskey and Steven Kelly of Silver & DeBoskey in Denver; and
Gerald P. Word of Word & Flinn in Carrollton, GA.

     Robert L. Pennington and Scott A. Farrow of Troutman Sanders
represent Georgia Power.  James A. Orr and Elizabeth Boswell of
Sutherland, Asbill & Brennan represent Oglethorp Power.  All are
located in Atlanta.

VIRGINIA SUP. CT. RULING
AWAITED IN EMF PROPERTY
DEVALUATION LAWSUIT

     The Virginia Supreme Court is expected to decide this month
whether a trial judge erred in allowing jury commissioners in a
condemnation case to consider testimony about the effect of
electromagnetic fields on the value of property.  Virginia
Electric and Power Co. v. Dolzer, No. 950622 (VA Sup. Ct.).

     During oral arguments in November, Virginia Electric and
Power Company (VEPCO) contended that Louisa County, VA, Circuit
Court Judge F. Ward Harkrader, Jr. committed numerous errors in
the handling of the utility's right-of-way suit against defendant
property owners John F. and Janet E. Dolzer.

     VEPCO's expert placed the total damage from a 230,000-volt
transmission line in a 150-foot wide easement across the Dolzers'
140-acre farm in Louisa County at $14,530, including the 7.06-
acre easement and the effect of the line on the rest of the
property.  The Dolzers' experts placed the damage at more than
$900,000, and the jury commissioners awarded them $966,915.

     On appeal, VEPCO contended that the trial court erred in
allowing the commissioners to speculate about "the fear of the
unknown" from EMFs.  The utility argued that the court erred in
refusing to allow it to amend its condemnation petition to make
it clear that a railroad spur would be permitted across the
easement and to reduce its right of access to the easement.
VEPCO also contended that the court erred in admitting testimony
about a $1.85 million offer for the tract before VEPCO sought the
easement.

     The property owners responded that the testimony about EMFs
came in the context of their effect on the value of other pieces
of property that the experts used as comparable sales in
determining the reduction of the value of the property by the
easement.  With that foundation, no speculation was involved, the
owners contended.

     They also argued that VEPCO failed to appreciate the unique
nature of the property, which had a knoll that separated an
industrial site from a residential estate that dated to 1785.
The easement barred a railroad spur to the property, and the
visibility of the power lines from the residential portion of the
property ruined it for use as a country estate, the Dolzers said.

     VEPCO is represented by John E. Holleran of Hunton &
Williams in Richmond, VA.  Charles F. Purcell and Craig B. Davis
of Purcell & Purcell in Louisa, VA, represent the Dolzers.

TORT REFORM AND UTILITIES
GROUPS SUBMIT AMICUS
BRIEFS FOR SDG&E

     In separate amicus briefs submitted Oct. 2, the Association
for California Tort Reform (ACTR) and the California Municipal
Utilities Association (CMUA) weighed in on the side of San Diego
Gas & Electric Co. in the utility's quest to have the California
Supreme Court affirm the California Public Utility Commission's
full authority over all electromagnetic field-related issues.
San Diego Gas & Electric Co. v. Superior Court of the State of
California for the County of Orange, Covalt et al., real parties
in interest, No. S045854 (CA Sup. Ct.); see Electromagnetic Field
LR, December, 1995.

     In their briefs, ACTR suggested that EMF fear cases be
judged under the "more likely than not" damage test outlined in
Potter v. Firestone (see Electromagnetic Field LR, February,
1994), and CMUA insisted the PUC must maintain full jurisdiction
over EMF issues for the sake of having a uniform set of
regulations free from court-to-court interpretation.

     "It is against common sense and sound public policy to
permit property owners to recover compensation for unreasonable
public fears about EMFs while requiring those who believe they
have been injured by EMFs to show their fear is reasonable," ACTR
said in suggesting the "more likely than not" test as a means of
sorting reasonable and unreasonable fears.

     "When...two kinds of interests are allegedly injured by the
wrongful acts of another " in this case a public utility that
modified its power lines to increase service to its consumers and
with it, also increase EMFs " we are told individuals must meet a
more stringent test to obtain compensation to their persons than
to their property," ACTR said.  "This proposition stands the law
on its head; it distinguishes property rights and personal rights
contrary to the steady progression of the law since the founding
of the Republic and this state.  If individuals  who believe they
have been harmed by exposure to EMFs must prove that it is 'more
likely than not' that they will suffer the feared health
consequences of that exposure in the near future " and plaintiffs
and their amici do not disagree with that evidentiary threshold "
how can one possibly justify a lesser standard for injury to
one's property?"

     ACTR said "one can do no better" in deciding what is a
rational or legitimate fear deserving of recognition in the
assessment of compensable property diminution than Potter's
requirement that such fear "stems from a knowledge, corroborated
by reliable medical and scientific opinion, that it is more
likely than not that the feared cancer will develop in the future
due to toxic exposure."

     CMUA's brief refutes the Covalt's assertion that the PUC had
made no effort to regulate EMFs prior to SDG&E's upgrade of the
power line in question, holding that, as of 1989, the PUC had a
"definite policy with respect to EMF," of conducting research and
not undertaking mitigation measures for fear that such actions
could worsen the matter (PUC Health Effects Report, Executive
Summary, B-4, 3 Exh. p. 613).  "[G]iven the PUC's position, there
was no reasonable likelihood that mitigation costs would have
been recoverable in utility rates," CMUA noted.  "[T]he
contention that the PUC had not taken a position on EMF
mitigation as of the upgrade at issue is simply not credible.
Penalizing a utility for failing to take mitigation measures " as
would be the case were the lawsuit at issue here permitted to
proceed " would clearly and directly interfere with the stated
position of the PUC."

     The Covalt's have failed to sustain a claim for inverse
condemnation, CMUA added, because they have not shown they were
"singled out" or have suffered a "special and peculiar" impact as
a result of the placement of the SDG&E line's placement or
upgrade.  "Transmission lines, like highways or railroads,
traverse the state and are beneficial," according to the
consortium of 29 publicly-owned utilities.  "The law is clear
that ordinary detriments suffered by all landowners as a result
of proximity to railroads or highways is not sufficient to
sustain a claim in inverse condemnation.  There is no reason to
adopt a different rule for power lines."

     The CMUA concluded, "if this court, as CMUA urges, affirms
Covalt, all utilities would recognize that a failure to follow
the PUC standards would subject them to endless and costly
litigation.  For all these reasons, it is obvious that the EMF
standards promulgated by the PUC are being and will be followed
by all utilities in California, whether they be investor-owned or
consumer-owned."

     ACTR is represented by Fred Hiestand in Sacramento, CA.  The
CMUA is represented by Daniel Davidson and Scott Strauss of
Spiegel & McDiarmid in Washington, DC and David S. Kaplan of
DeCuir & Somach in Sacramento.

     SDG&E is represented by Frank Rothrock and Gary Weisberg of
Palmieri, Tyler, Wiener, Wilhelm & Waldron in Irvine, CA; Duncan
Barr and Joel Lamp of O'Connor, Cohn, Dillon & Barr in San
Francisco; and William Young of Smith Helms Mulliss & Moore in

9TH CIR. AFFIRMS NOAA'S
CHOICE OF DOPPLER RADAR
TOWER SITE IN CALIFORNIA

     The Ninth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals on Dec. 29 said the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) did not
act "arbitrarily and capriciously" in deciding to locate a
California doppler radar weather station without first preparing
a site-specific environmental impact statement (EIS) on the
facility or a study of its potential radio frequency radiation
(RFR) emissions.  Environmental Coalition of Ojai et al. v. Brown
et al., No. 94-56164 (9th Cir.)

     The ruling affirmed a U.S. District Court's refusal to issue
a temporary restraining order requested in a suit by the
Environmental Coalition of Ojai claiming that the government
failed to comply with the National Environmental Policy Act of
1969 (NEPA) when it decided to go ahead with the Sulphur Mountain
station project in 1993 based on several 1980s government
studies.

     The Ninth Circuit affirmed the earlier ruling by Judge Terry
J. Hatter of the U.S. District Court for the Central District of
California, holding that NOAA complied with the NEPA.  In
addition, the district court said residents received appropriate
notice of the project, by virtue of a 1984 programmatic
environmental impact statement, a 1986 preliminary site survey, a
1987 in-depth site survey, and a 1989 finding of no significant
impact (FONSI).  The government review process, it noted, also
included two site specific environmental assessments (EAs), and a
Draft Supplemental Environmental Assessment (SEA) issued by the
U.S. government's Joint System Program Office.

     The Ojai, California facility, part of NOAA's Next
Generation Weather Radar Program (NEXRAD), is one of 55 such
stations across the nation and was completed and placed in
operation during the appeal process.  NEXRAD is part of the
agency's overall effort to update weather forecasting abilities
under the Weather Service Modernization Act.

     Actor Larry Hagman, who lives near the station, joined the
Coalition in its argument that the EIS was a prerequisite for the
station's construction.  The coalition said such a study would
have included review of multiple source RFR levels in the area,
including those from an neighboring FM radio tower.

     "The government did consider the question of 'additive RFR'
from NEXRAD and other possible sources in its SEA," the Ninth
Circuit ruled, in an opinion by Third Circuit Judge Ruggero J.
Aldisert, sitting by designation.  "The SEA concluded that
cumulative RFR levels were extremely unlikely to exceed
'ultraconservative' health standards.  The Government explained
that 'the emissions from the WSR-88D radar will not materially
add to the emissions present in those areas from other sources'."

     The appeals court said, "the Government's decision, based on
its site-specific [EAs], not to prepare a site-specific EIS was
not arbitrary and capricious.  NEPA does not require an agency to
prepare site-specific environmental impact studies for each
individual location....  The purpose of the environmental
assessment is to provide sufficient evidence and analysis for
determining whether to prepare an environmental impact statement
of a finding of no significant impact."

     Concluding, the panel said, "in its 1986 and 1987 site-
specific EAs, the Government considered the environmental impact
of the NEXRAD installation on Sulphur Mountain.  Having
determined that the Sulphur Mountain NEXRAD installation would
have no significant local impact, the government reasonably
issued a FONSI in 1989 instead of preparing a site-specific EIS."

     Lead defendant Secretary of the Department of Commerce,
Ronald H. Brown is represented by Assistant U.S. Attorneys
Patrick J. Walsh and Donna J. Everett of Los Angeles.  The
Coalition is represented by Oxnard, CA attorney Dale G. Givner.
