<B>MNR Participates in New York State<BR> 
Aerial Bait Drop for Raccoon Rabies</B><P>
The Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources will participate this weekend in an aerial bait drop in New York State, designed to test an oral rabies vaccine to slow or stop raccoon rabies.<P>
MNR scientists will team up with research veterinarians and wildlife biologists from Cornell University's College of Veterinary Medicine for the project which begins on October 14 and runs to October 16, weather permitting.<P>
Two different baits -- one produced in Ontario, the other in the United States and both containing a U.S. approved oral rabies vaccine, will be distributed in two areas of New York State -- Niagara County, and portions of Jefferson, Lewis and St. Lawrence counties near the St. Lawrence River.<P>
The New York trials objectives are to establish a barrier of vaccinated raccoons to stop the advance of the raccoon rabies front along the St. Lawrence, and to try and stop an already existing outbreak of raccoon rabies in Niagara County, New York.<P>
The New York project will test both vaccine-baits to see if the raccoons eat the baits and also which one they prefer.<P>
The two baits, will be distributed at a rate of one per three acres. The cream- coloured Ontario-made baits have a distinctive smell and are made of beef tallow, wax, icing sugar and marshmallow essence. The American-made polymer bait consists of fish meal, a binder and fish oil and is brown in colour.<P>
Ontario stands to benefit from the New York State project because it contributes to provincial efforts to prevent the spread of raccoon rabies into Ontario. It will also provide new information on which bait, at what density, we should use if raccoon rabies does get into Ontario.<P>
Along with on-site technical advice, MNR is providing two Twin Otters, specially equipped with baiting machines and computerized flight line navigation system for the aerial drops.<P>
