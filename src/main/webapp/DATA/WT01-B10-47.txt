<h1 align=center>Endometrial Ablation</h1><hr>
<b>A common problem</b><br>Every year about 650,000 American women have <a href="#hyst">hysterectomies</a>. This operation involves surgical removal of the uterus. Many of the women who have this operation do so because of heavy or prolonged periods.<P><b>An alternative</b><br><a href="#eablate">Endometrial ablation</a> offers an effective alternative to hysterectomy for patients suffering from heavy or prolonged bleeding during their period. It is often chosen when other medical treatments have failed or are otherwise undesirable. This procedure involves the removal of the lining of the uterus, which is the source of the bleeding.<P>
<img align=center src="femsit.gif"><br>According to recent studies, most women feel that endometrial ablation relieves the problem with their period. Up to 90% of women who have this procedure are satisfied with the results. After the procedure, the women who were satisfied with it reported lighter periods or normal periods. Some women said that their periods stopped completely after endometrial ablation.<P>
<b>Tests</b><br>Your physician will take your medical history and perform a physical exam to see if endometrial ablation is right for you.<P>
Other tests could include some blood tests, <a href="#ebx">uterine lining sampling (biopsy)</a>, and <a href="#hysteroscopy">hysteroscopy</a> and/or <a href="#us">ultrasonography</a>. These procedures are usually done in your physician's office and are quick and relatively painless.
<p>
<b>Drugs</b><br>For 1 to 2 months before the procedure you may have to take medication, possibly injections, to decrease the thickness of the <a href="#endometrium">endometrium (uterine lining)</a>.
A <a href="#GnRH">GnRH analog</a> may be used for this purpose. Thinning the uterine lining exposes the lower (basal) layer of endometrial cells; this is the tissue your physician will remove with <a href="#elctro">electrosurgery</a>. The day prior to surgery, your physician may choose to place a <a href="#laminaria">laminaria</a> to gradually dilate your cervix the night before your surgery.<P>
<b>What to expect</b><br>Endometrial ablation is an outpatient surgical procedure; this means that you will enter the hospital, have surgery, and usually go home the same day.<P>
<img align=bottom src="clock.gif">   The entire procedure usually takes only 15 to 45 minutes. You will then be taken to the recovery room for rest and observation, and will be allowed to go home when you have fully recovered from the anesthesia. It usually takes an hour or two to recover from anesthesia.<P>
<b>The procedure</b><br>Endometrial ablation is performed during a procedure called operative <a href="#hysteroscopy">hysteroscopy</a>. A narrow viewing tube is inserted through the vagina and the cervix into the uterus. A tiny camera attached to the viewing tube (hysteroscope) allows the uterine cavity to be shown on a TV monitor during surgery. Your uterus is filled with a harmless liquid to make the procedure easier. The lining of the uterus is then burned away or vaporized, using a heat generating tool inserted through the viewing tube.<P>

Your physician may decide to perform a <a href="#laparoscopy">laparoscopy</a> at the same time to rule out other conditions that could require further therapy.<P>
<h2><img align=bottom src="torso.gif">
Afterwards</h2>
Your doctor may advise you to: <P>
<img align=top src="blue.gif">   Avoid strenuous activity for a period of time, usually 24 hours following the procedure.<P>
<img align=top src="blue.gif">   Refrain from sexual intercourse for a specified period, usually 2 weeks or until the discharge stops.<P>

<img align=top src="blue.gif">   Schedule an appointment for about a week after your surgery.<P>

In addition, you may experience some of the following:<P>

<img align=top src="blue.gif">   Frequent urination during the first 24 hours; this is normal.<P>

<img align=top src="blue.gif">   A small amount of bloody, watery discharge for up to 6 weeks following the procedure. It is impossible to evaluate the effectiveness of your surgery until at least three months postoperatively. <P>

<img align=top src="blue.gif">   Some cramping, for which your doctor may prescribe or recommend pain medication. Many over the conter medications such as Motrin, Aleve, Advil or Nuprin.<P>

The anesthesia may cause mild nausea and vomiting.<P>
Rarely, more serious problems such as cardiac arrest (heart stoppage) and pulmonary arrest (no breathing) have been caused by general anesthesia.<P>

Rarely, the viewing tube can puncture the uterus and injure the bowel. This seldom happens, but if it does your physician will generally stop the procedure and postpone it until the puncture heals by itself. Another possible risk is fluid overload. If your body absorbs too much of the liquid used to fill up your uterus during the operation, the procedure will be discontinued.<P>

It is unlikely that the operating tool will puncture the thick uterine wall, but this is a potential risk.<P>

The bowel could also be damaged by heat from this tool. Infections developing from either of these rare complications could require additional surgery.<P>

<b><i>Can I still get pregnant?</i></b><br>
Probably not. Most women cannot have children after this procedure. Because there is still a slight possibility of pregnancy, however, you should continue to use contraception until you have entered menopause. Or you can ask your physician about other contraceptive measures.<P>

Endometrial ablation is a safe, effective alternative to hysterectomy. You may also wish to learn more about another alternative, <a href="#LAVH">laparoscopic assisted vaginal hysterectomy</a>. I hope this information has helped you to better understand endometrial ablation and how it can work for you. If you have any questions that this brochure has not answered, please ask your physician.<P><hr>
<b>Some Medical Terms</b><br>

<p><a name="eablate"><dt><b>Endometrial Ablation</b></a> <dd>Removing the lining of the womb. Removing the uterine lining will decrease your menstrual flow or even stop it completely.

<p><a name="endometrium"><dt><b>Endometriurn (Uterine Lining) </b></a> <dd>The cells that line the womb. This tissue sheds in response to the hormonal changes of your monthly period.

<p><a name="electro"><dt><b>Electrosurgery </b></a> <dd>Instead of a scalpel, a heat-generating electrical device is used to burn-away, removeor vaporize tissue in this type of procedure.

<p><a name="GnRH"><dt><b>GnRH Analog</b></a> <dd> This type of drug acts like a natural hor-mone your body produces. It produces hormonal changes which decrease the thickness of the endometrium.

<p><a name="hyst"><dt><b>Hysterectomy </b></a> <dd>The surgical removal of the uterus.

<p><a name="hysteroscopy"><dt><b>Hysteroscopy </b></a> <dd>A procedure used to see inside the womb, using a viewing tube inserted into the vagina.

<p><a name="laminaria"><dt><b>Laminaria </b></a> <dd>A laminaria is a small rod shaped pieced of dried seaweed, that when placed in your cervix provides for more gentle dilation of your cervix minimizing the risk of cervical tears. 
<p><a name="LAVH"><dt><b>Laparoscopic Assisted Vaginal Hysterectomy (<a href="lavh.html">LAVH</a>)</b></a> <dd>A simpler form of hysterectomy (LAVH) used the laparoscope to avoid a large abdominal incision.  

<p><a name="laparoscopy"><dt><b>Laparoscopy </b></a> <dd>In this procedure, the physician inserts a viewing tube through the skin to see inside the body. Other tubes can be pushed through the skin to introduce probes or instruments; in this way a number of surgical procedures can be performed without a large surgical mclslon.

<p><a name="us"><dt><b>Ultrasonography </b></a> <dd>A procedure used to "see" inside the body, using high-pitched sound waves. This is a little like radar or sonar.

<p><a name="uterus"><dt><b>Uterus </b></a> <dd>The womb.

<p><a name="ebx"><dt><b>Uterine Lining Sampling (Biopsy) </b></a> <dd>In this procedure, a small piece of tissue is removed from the lining of the womb and analyzed in the lab.<p><hr>
If further information is needed to help you with the decision, please feel free to ask your physician.<p><hr>
