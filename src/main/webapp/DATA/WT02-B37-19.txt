PSC PUBLIC HEARINGS ON WISCONSIN'S ELECTRIC INDUSTRY

The Public Service Commission of Wisconsin (PSC) has prepared
an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) as part of its
investigation into changing the structure and regulation of
the electric utility industry in Wisconsin
(PSC Docket 05-EI-114). This EIS is now available for public
review. A separate report by a special Advisory Committee to
the Commission lists recommendations for changes in electric
generation, transmission and distribution.

The PSC held public information meetings and hearings on
the future of Wisconsin's electric industry in six cities,
November 27 through December 5. The hearings were required in
order to obtain public comment on the EIS, but comments and
testimony were also encouraged on the investigation itself,
including the upcoming Commission Advisory Committee Report.
The Commission decisions (based on the comments and
testimony, EIS, and Advisory Committee Report) may affect
customer electricity costs, customer electric services, and
the choices available for each.

The EIS has been prepared because this investigation could
result in the adoption of principles and policies that
significantly alter the regulatory responsibilities of the
Commission. Changes in how the Commission regulates electric
utilities could, in turn, have environmental and economic
consequences. The EIS explores the economic, environmental and
social costs

The PSC encourages members of the public and organizations to
attend the hearings or write and send comments on the EIS.
Comments and testimony on the EIS must be submitted to the
Public Service Commission offices in Madison by 4:30 p.m. on
Wednesday, December 6, 1995. Comments and testimony will be
considered by the three-member Commission as it determines
what recommendations it will make to the Legislature on
December 12.

For more information, or to request a copy of the
Environmental Impact Statement or the Advisory Committee
Report, please write to the Public Service Commission of
Wisconsin, Electric Division, P.O. Box 7854, Madison, WI,
53707-7854, or call 608/267-2896.

MURPHY OIL SUBSIDIARY AND TEMPLE-INLAND
FOREST PRODUCTS FORM FIBERBOARD COMPANY

Deltic Farm & Timber Co., Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of
Murphy oil Corporation (NYSE:MUR), and Temple-Inland Forest
Products Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Temple-
Inland, Inc. (NYSE:TIN), have formed Del-Tin Fiber, L.L.C.
and plan for the entity to construct and operate a medium
density fiberboard plant at a site near El Dorado, Arkansas.

The plant will cost an estimated $90 million, will have an
annual production capacity of 150 million square feet and will
have more than 100 employees when it begins production in late
1997. The site selection and project design are subject to
regulatory approvals, completion of final engineering and
resolution of other site-related issues. Construction is
scheduled to commence in the summer of 1996.

Del-Tin's Chairman, Ron Pearce, stated, "We are pleased to
announce our selection of the El Dorado/Union County area for
this exciting new venture. We deeply appreciate the efforts of
the El Dorado chamber of Commerce and its local team, city and
county officials, the Arkansas Highway & Transportation
Department and the Arkansas Industrial Development Commission,
all of whom worked together to provide us with a site having
the necessary infrastructure for a project of this magnitude.
Del-Tin looks forward to a long and prosperous future in Union
County."

Medium density fiberboard (MDF) is used as a substitute for
lumber in the furniture, flooring and molding industries
throughout the world. MDF is an engineered wood product
composed of wood residuals (chips, shavings and sawdust) held
together by an adhesive bond. unlike most other lumber
substitutes, MDF possesses many of the same machining and
strength characteristics of solid wood.

INDONESIA'S DURI FIELD PRODUCES BILLIONTH BARREL OF OIL

Indonesia's giant Duri oil field, currently producing at a
record 300,000 barrels daily (b/d), yielded its billionth
barrel in September, Chevron and Texaco reported.

Duri is operated by PT Caltex Pacific Indonesia (CPI), a 50/50
Chevron/Texaco affiliate working under a long-term production
sharing agreement with Pertamina, Indonesia's state oil
company.

Located in Sumatra, Duri was discovered in 1941 and began
producing in 1958. Output peaked at 65,000 b/d in 1963, and
then declined steadily until 1984. At that time, CPI engineers
determined that Duri's large reserves, shallow depth, thick
oil and tight reservoir rocks made it an ideal prospect for
"steamflood" technology, which injects steam to heat the oil
so that more of it flows to the production wells.

In 1985, CPI began a major steamflood at Duri, launching a
new era of production growth. Plans call for continued
expansion of the steamflood, already the world's largest.
Meanwhile, advanced seismic imaging is helping to maximize oil
recovery. Duri currently represents about 40 percent of CPI's
total oil output.

PARACELSIAN FILES PATENT APPLICATION
OF IMPROVED AH-IMMUNOASSAY TECHNOLOGY

Paracelsian, Inc. (NASDAQ: PRLN), of Ithaca, NY, has filed a
U.S. patent application that describes improvements in its Ah-
Immunoassay technology.  Paracelsian anticipates that
enhancements over its currently licensed technology will
provide markets for the assay in Asia and Eastern Europe.

"The simplicity and speed of the new formats are ideal for
countries with enormous environmental problems and little
financial support for high-cost instrumental analysis," said
inventor Geoffrey Wheelock, Ph. D., Director of Analytical
Research at Paracelsian. "Much of Asia and Eastern Europe are
rebounding from decades of environmental neglect."

Ah-Immunoassay technology is a biologically-based diagnostic
test designed to detect and determine the level of dioxin-like
compounds found in the environment. The disclosure filed at
the U.S. Patent and Trademarks Office in Washington, D.C.
describes methods for increasing sensitivity, reducing
background interference, increasing sample throughput,
reducing the time required to perform the assay, and reducing
reagent use.

Paracelsian is a biotechnology company engaged in the
discovery of pharmaceuticals and the development and marketing
of assays for Unproved cancer diagnosis. The Company's
technologies are based on a biochemical process known as
signal transduction -- a form of information processing within
the cell. The Company has in effect several licensing deals,
including an agreement with Dow Chemical for Paracelsian's
Ah-Immunoassay signed in January 1995.

EPA APPROVES MONSANTO'S INSECT-PROTECTED COTTON

The EPA has granted regulatory approval for Monsanto's
Bollgard(TM) gene, which provides cotton plants with season-long,
in-plant protection from such major lepidopteran insect pests as
the cotton bollworm, tobacco budworm and pink bollworm. EPA's
registration of the Bollgard gene, the first insect-protection
gene to be approved for cotton and only the third for any crop,
follows the successful completion earlier this year of regulatory
reviews by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and U.S.
Department of Agriculture (USDA). The notification marks
Monsanto's fourth allowing full commercialization of a
genetically engineered crop in the past six months.

The insect control protein introduced into cotton plants was
originally isolated from a specific strain of a natural soil
bacterium, Bacillus thuringiensis. The genetically-engineered
seeds containing the Bollgard gene are covered by Monsanto
patents, some of which have been issued, while others are
pending.

According to James Tobin, Monsanto Cotton Business Director, the
Bollgard gene will be widely available to America's cotton
farmers for the 1996 planting season. The gene has already been
incorporated into a number of popular cotton varieties.

The technology will be commercially introduced by Delta and
Pine Land Company, the leading U.S. cotton seed company.
Additional programs to commercialize Bollgard cotton are
underway at the Jacob Hartz Seed Company and Stoneville
Pedigreed Seed Company, Inc.

CHIRON AWARDS CONTRACT TO SEPRAGEN
FOR LARGE-SCALE PURIFICATION SYSTEMS

Sepragen Corporation (NASDAQ: SPGNU, SPGNZ, SPGNA, SPGNW), of
San Leandro, CA, has signed a contract to build multiple
QuantaSep LS (large-scale) systems for Chiron Corporation. The
contract, valued at approximately $400,000, includes hardware,
software, documentation and validation. The systems have been
designed to meet the specific needs of Chiron's drug
manufacturing efforts.  Delivery is scheduled for January
1996.

"The interactive team efforts between Sepragen and Chiron
engineers resulted in the custom design of the process
purification systems. These will enable the rapid purification
of large quantities of two new potential Chiron drugs for
their clinical trial needs," said Vinit Saxena, president and
chairman.

"This is part of our overall strategic plan to provide
state-of-the-art, large-scale purification systems to
biopharmaceutical companies to enhance and optimize their
manufacturing processes.

"We selected Sepragen for this purchase based on the
exceptional service that they have provided to us in the
past," said Mark Pemberton, director of Bulk Pharmaceutical
Manufacturing at Chiron Corporation.

The QuantaSep LS is a large-scale, computer-controlled
chromatography workstation consisting of hardware,
electronics, software, sensors and detectors.

"Sepragen's advanced technologies have added significant
economic value to the manufacturing processes of many FDA
approved pharmaceutical drugs worldwide," Saxena said.

Sepragen Corporation is a pioneer in the field of large-scale
chromatography - the next generation technology in the
separations field. The company markets a patented radial flow
chromatography (RFC) technology that utilizes a novel
hydrodynamic column design in which the flow is directed
radially from the outside to the center of the column. The
surface areas are larger and the radial flow path (bed depth)
is shorter. The combination of these features results in
higher flow rates, lower back pressures, and increased
volumetric productivity over traditional axial columns. This
is further magnified in large-volume chromatography
applications.

Sepragen also markets computer-controlled process
chromatography workstations and process technology to the
biotechnology, food and environmental industries. The
company's products are being used by leading biotech
companies to reduce manufacturing costs and commercial
production time to market, as well as by food and
environmental companies to produce new value-added products
and processes. Based in San Leandro, California, the company
markets its proprietary RFC technology and services worldwide.

CPUC IS WATCHFUL REGARDING RF/EMF FROM CELLULAR TOWERS

The California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) today
ordered cellular utilities to identify and address public
concerns- potential health problems from electromagnetic field
(ENF) and radio-frequency (RF) exposure in siting and building
new cellular towers. It urged cellular companies to site
facilities away from schools and hospitals, and to restrict
access to sites with warning signs and barriers.

The Commission's jurisdiction is limited to cellular towers
and related facilities - it does not regulate cellular phones.
The federal Food and Drug Administration regulates RF
emissions from consumer/industrial devices and is looking into
RF emissions from hand-held cellular phones.

Due to public concern and scientific uncertainty regarding the
potential health effects of EMF exposure, the Commission
examined what steps should be taken to mitigate the-health
effects, if any, of RF and EMFs from the 1,000 cellular
facilities in California. It found no scientific link between
EMFs and adverse health effects on humans from cellular
facilities.

A steering committee composed of one representative each from
the CPUC Commission Advisory and Compliance Division, CPUC
Division of Ratepayer Advocates, state Department of Health
Services, Cellular Carriers Association of California, and
citizens concerned About Telecommunications EMF held an EMF
informational workshop on July 21, 1993 for interested
individuals and organizations. The workshop was videotaped for
those who could not attend.

APHIS GEARING UP TO EVALUATE TRANSGENIC INSECT RELEASES

Now that the first application to field test a genetically
engineered insect has been submitted to USDA/APHIS, a
Transgenic Arthropod Team has been formed in the Biotechnology
Permits Unit of Biotechnology, Biologics, and Environmental
Protection (BBEP), the agency that oversees introductions of
transgenic organisms and products for USDA. The Team will be
responsible for the development of guidance for the release of
genetically modified arthropods into the environment, and the
preparation of environmental documents associated with those
releases.

APHIS/BBEP already provides this sort of guidance to
prospective applicants seeking to field test genetically
engineered plants and microorganisms under permit or
notification. The agency distributes USDA-APHIS Technical
Bulletin 1783, "User's Guide for Introducing Genetically
Engineered Plants and Microorganisms" to help investigators
identify potential risks to the environment, and advises
applicants concerning the data that must be available for
agency review.

With more insect release proposals expected, the Transgenic
Arthropod Team is compiling a Bibliography Associated With the
Introduction of Transgenic Arthropods, which is publicly
available in database format. It currently contains 32 general
citations and reviews, 32 references on field evaluations,
and 58 titles on laboratory methods. The Team will continue
adding relevant publications and expand the database, and
encourages others to suggest additional publications that
should be included. In addition to the bibliography, the
following information on how proposed releases will be
reviewed is available on the BBEP homepage
(http://www.aphis.usda.gov/bbep/bp).

The evaluation process first considers what the risks would
be if the introduced organism was not transgenic. The analysis
at this point would be the same as for the introduction of a
classical biological control organism and would require such
information as: (1) phylogenetic position of the organism and
characteristics of near relatives, (2) geographic origin and
range, to include temperature and relative humidity tolerances
and diapause attributes, (3) host and habitat preferences, (4)
dispersal characteristics, (5) life table attributes, (6)
interactions with other species, and (7) the relationship
between the organism and currently employed pest management
strategies.

The evaluation process would next consider whether the genetic
alterations have altered the risks associated with the
unmodified organism. The fundamental risk assessment issue to
be addressed is: Will the genetic alteration modify
ecologically or environmentally relevant properties of the
organism? To properly address this issue, APHIS would need to
consider such information as: (1) how the recipient organism
was transformed through recombinant DNA technology, to include
characteristics of the donor, vector, and recipient organisms
and a description of the methods employed, (2) the
characteristics of the modified organism, to include the
stability of the new genotype and the probability of gene
transfer to other organisms, (3) potential impact of the
transgenic arthropod on native populations, communities, and
ecosystems, and (4) methods for evaluation of the safety of
the transgenic organism in field trials before unrestricted
release.

In summary, the APHIS evaluation process would basically
consider the attributes of the unmodified organism, the
attributes of the genetic alteration, the phenotype of the
modified organism compared to the unmodified organism, and the
attributes of the accessible environment. Only after
sufficient information is provided in these four areas of
concern will APHIS be able to determine the appropriateness of
a release into the environment.

APHIS welcomes comments at any time concerning the present and
future regulation of transgenic arthropods. These comments
can be directed to Dr. Orrey P. Young at oyoung@aphis.usda.gov
or at 301-734-8565 (voice) or 301-734-5992 (fax)
