<img src="../caps/lcap.gif" align=left border=0 alt="L">ightening growth over the past year has brought telecom service up, prices down, and opportunities for foreign and local companies. It has also vaulted some fundamental realities to the fore.<p>

A drive on the dusty, clay road into the village of Van Phuc, about 40 minutes west of Hanoi, brings you to the enterprising home of 15-year-old Nu Kim Lien and her family. In 1992 Lien's family installed one of the village's first telephones, a heavy-duty rotary model that turned their home into a phone booth. That year, according to Lien, the phone got the greatest use, about 20 regular customers per day. Lien dials the calls herself and times them on her watch, charging 700 dong (about five cents) per minute for calls to Hanoi.<p>

Today Lien's customers, who use the phone largely for buying and selling construction materials, has nearly halved. "People are becoming richer," says Lien. "About 100 families now have their own phones (one in ten) with more all the time. They need them now." Lien says that the family plans to continue offering phone service. "People know they can come at any time, day or night." A year from today, a visitor might find fax services instead.<p>

<img src="../october96/cover/art.gif" valign=top align=left alt="Telecom Graphic">

<img src="../caps/wcap.gif" align=left border=0 alt="W">ith a growth rate over the past year of 70%, Vietnam's telecom market was recently ranked as the world's second-fastest-growing by Swiss-based telecom authority ITU. In contrast to other sectors in Vietnam, improvements to the system by users here are immediately perceptible, from pricing to clarity to installation time. Universal access to phones is a primary government goal and the market is quickly responding.<p>

Industry hands, already an optimistic group, were beaming when June's Eighth Communist Party Congress produced a mandate for about 6% (per hundred people) penetration by the year 2000. With currently about 800,000 lines installed, reaching that goal means moving quickly to lay 4 million more. And that means immediate opportunities for suppliers, manufacturers, operators and engineers, as well as long-term prospects for those who can service the systems once installed.<p>

However, many in the industry say that the past year has seen a marked change in the Vietnamese telecom tableau. The "free-market rush" has given way to a more moderate pace. State telecom authorities have now presented their goals, leaving nearly 30 foreign telecom firms, including many of the world's largest, to take their best shots at designing winning plans.<p>

The process has generated uncertainty and disappointment, but many long-term domestic targets are now becoming reality. Instead of searching the landscape for future operators and explaining their corporate personalities, some firms are now negotiating land lease rights for antenna towers and working out terms of Business Cooperation Contracts (BCCs). While a system cobbled together from a grab-bag of switches and other central elements is still cited as a problem, that story has another side. Firms like Nortel, for instance, claim to specialize in smoothing out such incongruities.<p>

In addition, industry members say that more contracts, which had been stymied by the Party Congress, are expected to move forward by 1997. Most recently, Korea Telecom won the first domestic BCC to develop the network in three northern provinces. (Australia's Telstra has held a BCC since 1988 for international operations.) Korea Telecom plans to increase lines to 200,000 by 2000 from less than 40,000 at present. The $40 million deal had been underway for two years.<p>

<img src="../october96/cover/pic1.gif" valign=top align=right alt="Telecom Shop Photo">

Four other multinationals have been competing to revamp networks in HCMC and Hanoi, projects valued by the Ministry of Planning and Investment (MPI) at $900 million. In Hanoi, France Telecom and Telstra are negotiating with the state-owned Vietnam Post and Telecommunications Corp. (VNPT) for contracts, respectively, in east and west HCMC. According to the MPI, these contracts are worth up to $500 million. The MPI also said that Japan's NTT and Cable and Wireless will share Hanoi's upgrade. Awards are expected to be announced by September 15.<p>

Deals are being financed by banks (in medium-term loans), Japanese trading companies, the operators and suppliers themselves, and also by VNPT, which late last year also won a $25 million loan to purchase cellular equipment, syndicated by ANZ Bank, one of the largest loans made within Vietnam.<p>

Of course, each line also represents accompanying products, and for hand-set manufacturers the year has also been dynamic. Telephony is officially distributed through several state-owned companies: Cokyvina in the north and center, and Kasati and Potmasco in the south.<p>

Distribution is a mixed bag. Firms that have won major cells contracts with operators have established relatively smooth networks. Ericsson, for instance,  completed a $70 million deal with MobiFone, a service of Sweden's Comvik Vietnam AB and the VNPT's Vietnam Mobile Service (VMS). Part of that deal included hand phones and switching equipment.<p>

For others, distribution is more complicated. Says a Japanese regional vendor of fixed phones, "we've been selling through consultants who purchase quotas, and directly with general contractors or state-owned distributors. So far we've sold 30,000 hand-sets here in two years. Our goal is to sell on the low end, then on the very high end, competing with Philips, Siemens, and Alcatel. We hope to sell 30,000 more in the next six months." Another marketer, this one selling cellular phones, says that Vietnam has been a learning experience. "In China, local businessmen prefer to walk into a meeting with the biggest phone possible and drop it on the table with an impressive thud. Here, smaller is better."<p>

That offshore rep said his firm regrets selling 1,000 hand-sets to VNPT for a price based on a sale of 50,000 ("cheaper goodwill, we thought, than manufacturing") only to discover that locals would prefer to buy a smaller $600 phone than a heavier one for $200 less. However, he added, only hand-set manufacturers with operator agreements can charge prices "high enough."<p>

Many of the firms now signing fixed-line deals with VNPT, as well as US firms who came after the present round of contract winners, faced disappointment last year after high-level decisions that had seemed to promise a new roster of operators went nowhere. Late last summer consortiums were forming around a Hanoi military company known as METC which had won a charter to compete with VNPT. Major operators along with financiers such as Goldman Sachs and Chase were conducting related negotiations. A year later, however, that firm's network status is less clear. But stay tuned: a spokesman for the 100-employee company says to look for "a big announcement in the first quarter of next year."<p>

<img src="../october96/cover/chart2.gif" valign=top align=left alt="Telecom Chart">

<img src="../caps/icap.gif" align=left border=0 alt="I">n the meantime, a third permit to "provide telecom services" (after VNPT and METC) was granted to HCMC-based joint-stock Saigon Postel, one of whose 11 share-holders is VNPT. Both METC and Saigon Postel may start by entering the quick-growing cellular market. The Department of Electricity could become another cellular player, according to one VNPT official. "We stay on good terms with all of these," said a respected switching manufacturer, "but don't expect any viable operator to actually challenge VNPT for a good while." Most industry watchers regard the military company as the best bet.<p>

Presently, Comvik Vietnam AB, the one foreign firm awarded a BCC to operate in the cellular market a year ago, is enjoying enviable growth. MobiFone, the offshoot of Comvik and the VNPT's VMS, now sells 3,000 phones monthly and expects 50,000 subscribers by the year-end. At the beginning of August they carried 31,000 subscribers, compared to 15,000 six months earlier. Competitors are Callink (7,000 subscribers), a non-GSM HCMC provider, and Vinaphone (1,500), a recently introduced service 100%-operated by VNPT and offering Motorola base stations and Siemens switches. Most suppliers and others expect Vietnam will commit to the GSM system, which will allow domestic subscribers to roam throughout ASEAN and Hong Kong.<p>

<tr><td valign=top align=left>Korea Telecom was awarded a ten-year BCC in June 1996 to upgrade the network in the northern provinces of Quang Ninh, Hai Phong and Hai Hung by installing 40,000 lines and to provide technology and personnel training to VNPT.  The BCC requires Korea Telecom to provide three years of installation with seven years of maintenance and revenue sharing with VNPT. Estimated project value is $40 million.

<td valign=top align=left>These four operators are in the final stages of negotiating a BCC with VNPT to operate fixed lines in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City. Telstra is slated to install 400,000 lines in West Ho Chi Minh City, while France Telecom is to install 400,000 lines in East Ho Chi Minh City, NTT is negotiating to install 250,000 lines in Hanoi, while Cable & Wireless is also to install lines in Hanoi. Total investment of the projects is expected to be about $1 billion; lines are supposed to be installed by 2000.

<td valign=top align=left>Comvik International Vietnam AB, signed the initial $340 million BCC for nationwide OSM network operation with Vietnam Mobile Services in June 1994. Comvik is committed to investing $159.7 million, $126.4 million of which will go towards equipment purchases. Network capacity is planned to reach 100,000 over the next several years.

<td valign=top align=left>Telstra holds the oldest and most comprehensive telecom cooperation agreement in Vietnam, signed in October 1988. The $197 million BCC with Vietnam Telecommunications International, improves Vietnam's international telecommunications by installing two Standard A earth stations. Current projects include financing Vietnam's new BDH fiber optic backbone, and financing construction of a VSAT network.

<td valign=top align=left>Sapura won an 8-year BCC to operate payphones with the Ho Chi Minh City P&T. Sapura installed over 836 of its cardphones in Ho Chi Minh City, 35 in Vung Tau, and 22 in Song Be, as of April 1996. By year-end 1996, they plan to install over 1,200 cardphones. In the first three years of its BCC, Sapura has agreed to install 1,500 cardphones in the Ho Chi Minh City area. Sapura also operates payphones in Hanoi under a trial agreement.

Much of the credit for MobiFone's quick success, says Comvik's marketing manager Martin Sjolund, goes to the Vietnamese side. VMS sales and marketing director Nguyen Manh Thang seems to be on his Ericsson continually. "Our company is a service, not a hand-set," he says. According to Thang, the ubiquitous billboards and other ads help advertise "our strongest points, better service, such as roaming in 22 provinces already, and cheaper price. We advertise everything; in May it was image. But best is word of mouth. And with competition (Vinaphone), we must provide the best service." MobiFone aims to keep 60% (of a projected 300,000 subscribers) marketshare in five years, while facing up to three competitors. Vinaphone, he added, should have up to 25% share, but "may not be a competitor in the future."<p>

<img src="../october96/cover/pic2.gif" valign=top align=right alt="Telecom Shop Photo">

<img src="../caps/ecap.gif" align=left border=0 alt="E">xperience in this market causes many surveyed to emphasize the caveats, as well, in part based on METC's false start last year. Says one would-be carrier, "A lot of games can be played without a backbone of legislation. The more carriers the better, but someone needs to fight the regulation battle first. Local, cellular, long distance-fields of business should be defined."<p>

Even without such delineation, and with complaints, players recognize they are operating in a market characterized by quick growth, a credit-worthy partner in VNPT, and the government's attention. In cooperating with foreign partners and gaining training and technology VNPT's goals are becoming grander. A year ago, the monopoly announced its interest in launching a $250 million TV and communication satellite by the year 2000 with outside financing (but industry privately balked). Recently the subject has resurrected. Market leader Alcatel, according to official press, has made a bid to launch "VINALSAT."<p>

However, foreigners and Vietnamese officials note that despite achievements, training remains a key element, especially in terms of technology transfer. A visitor recently arrived promptly at DGPT (the state telecom regulator) headquarters for a meeting with an official known for his clear explanations, but still missed his appointment. Why? The guard receiving visitors repeatedly misdialed his new phone, over the course of half an hour.<p>
