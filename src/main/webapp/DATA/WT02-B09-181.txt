<h1 align=center><b>Conservative Columnist William F. Buckley, Jr.,
<br>Writes of His Sister's Cancer Chemotherapy
<br>and Her Need for Medical Marijuana</b> </h1>
</menu>

<p>In his syndicated column distributed on December 16, William F. Buckley,
Jr., the conservative author and talk show host, writes about his younger
sister's cancer and her need for medical access to marijuana &quot;because
she is undergoing an agonizing jolt of chemotherapy.&quot; To the question,
&quot;How does she know cannabis would help her?&quot; Buckley responds
- &quot;Dumb question. A) She knows, or knows of, people who have had relief
from the wretchedness she suffers from, from a puff or two of marijuana;
and B) so what if it did not work? ... What are we afraid of, that while
recovering from cancer and taking a marijuana cigarette she will become
a crack addict?&quot; </p>

<p>One of the persons she knows who has written about his use of cannabis
for chemotherapy is Richard Brookhiser, a senior editor of Buckley's National
Review magazine. As Buckley notes, Brookhiser found that it takes only
a one or two puffs on a marijuana cigarette to stop immediately-the nausea
of chemotherapy. It usually works, but if it does not, there are no side
effects. In contrast, the very expensive anti-nausea pharmaceutical Zofran
causes headaches in as many as 40% of those who use it and can cause liver
damage, etc. Yet the narcocracy cites Zofran as the reason that there is
no need for medical marijuana. </p>

<p>Buckley also writes of his frustration in not knowing where to buy marijuana
himself in New York City ... where it is almost ubiquitous. This reflects
one of the sad ironies of people in his situation: the older a person is,
the harder it is to find marijuana. The prohibition that is justified on
the grounds that it protects children actually makes it most difficult
for adults, and especially for the ill, to find marijuana when they need
it most. </p>

<p>In any other context it might be amusing to think of someone as recognizable
as Buckley lurking around Washington Square trying to &quot;score&quot;
a few dollars worth of pot. He makes light of this problem, but it really
is not feasible for someone in his position to do what he otherwise would
do. One assumes that at least after this column is published - the Buckleys
will eventually get marijuana, but what of the hundreds of thousands of
others? He laments that &quot;thinking on the subject is so far gone in
putrefaction that the simplest questions go unanswered.&quot; Actually,
most of the putrefaction starts here in Washington. Surveys show that the
overwhelming majority of the American people are in favor of medical access
to marijuana. Newt, please note. </p>

<p>Buckley concludes his column by reporting that researchers in San Francisco
have been ready for two years to do a study of the use of marijuana &quot;in
treating the wasting syndrome associated with AIDS, but they cannot obtain
the necessary marijuana from the government.&quot; Buckley asks, &quot;If
somebody discovered that marijuana would *cure* AIDS, would the narcs still
prowl the street for vendors?&quot; </p>

<p>Yes. Absolutely. NORML's experience suggests that the narcs would redouble
their efforts. They know that the survival of the narcocracy depends on
the suppression of medical marijuana. This is no petty crime that the narcs
are covering up ... as anyone who has endured chemotherapy, or AIDS, or
so much other suffering, would tell us, if they did not have to live and
often die in fear. </p>
