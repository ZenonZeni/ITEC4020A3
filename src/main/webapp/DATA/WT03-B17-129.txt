The library was developed to implement, enrich and support the educational program 

of the college.  The library services are under supervision of the Librarian and Director 

of Information Services. 

<P>

The collection currently embraces more than 10,000 items of books,  periodicals, pamphlets, 

programmed texts, and college catalogues, as well as slides, charts, maps and other audio-

visual materials.  The subjects cover the fields of traditional Chinese medicine, Bio-medicine, 

and Asian and Western herbology.  The holdings are predominately in English and Chinese 

language texts; however, French, Korean, and Japanese text are available.  The textbooks 

and other required readings are on reserve in the Library.

<P>

The Library hours are from 9:00 am to 8:00 pm Monday through Thursday, 9:00 am to 6:00 pm on Friday and 9:30 am to 5:00 pm on Saturday during the Winter Quarter (beginning Jan. 6 to Mar. 22, 1997). 

<P>

The Librarian and Library Assistant help faculty and students in accessing collection and in 

organizing their research and offers bibliographic instruction and an interlibrary loan service 

for materials not owned by ACTCM upon request.

<P>

Also, faculty and students are encouraged to utilize other library resources in their studies, 

such as libraries at the University of California at Berkeley, and the University of California 

at San Francisco.  Both universities are located within a short distance.
