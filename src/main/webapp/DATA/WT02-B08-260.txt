<h1>EISMINT Model Intercomparison</h1>

Received from <b><a href=mailto:phuybrec@vub.ac.be>Dr. Philippe
Huybrechts</a></b>,<br>

Pleinlaan 2, B-1050 Brussel

I would like to draw the attention to 
the activity of model intercomparison, as organized 
within the framework of <b>EISMINT (European Ice Sheet Modeling 
INiTiative)</b>.
<P> 

The objective of this activity is to test and compare 
existing numerical ice-sheet, ice-shelf, and glacier models 
as they are run by several groups worldwide, in order to 
narrow down uncertainties and to enable participating groups 
to upgrade their models. <P>

A number of us have been working lately on a new series of 
experimental setups, aiming at comparing the performance of 
models under real-world situations and under much more 
challenging conditions than was the case during previous 
workshops held in Brussels (1993) and in Bremerhaven (1994). <P>

We have now produced descriptions for 
<a href="http://orca.vub.ac.be/~phuybrec/eismint.html">
5 intercomparison topics</a>, namely:
<UL>
<LI>comparison of models applied to the Greenland ice sheet
<LI>comparison of models applied to the Antarctic ice sheet
<LI>comparison of ice-shelf models
<LI>comparison tests involving basal sliding
<LI>comparison of grounding-line treatments
</UL>
<P>

Interested modelers will be provided with detailed 
descriptions and datasets to run these experiments, and will 
be invited to discuss the results at a workshop
to be organized in October 1997 in Grindelwald 
(Switzerland). Note that the expenses for this workshop 
(travel, lodging, meals) will be entirely covered by the 
European Science Foundation. This call is particularly 
directed to those of you who were not involved in previous 
workshops, but are nevertheless active in ice-sheet 
modeling.<P> 

If you are interested to participate in this venture, which 
is certain to push the art of ice-sheet modelling a further 
step ahead, please contact
