<H3>The Cognitive/Social/Emotional Consequences of Inclusion for Students
with Learning Disabilities: Recognizing and Avoiding the Pitfalls </H3>

<P><B>Jerome J. Schultz, Ph.D.</B>, Neuropsychologist, Wellesley, MA </P>

<P>If inclusion means dumping the student with learning disabilities into
a regular classroom or if a school &quot;becomes&quot; inclusive overnight
by virtually eradicating intensive specialized services for kids who need
them, this is a tragic scenario. This session will present an objective
view of the characteristics of an inclusive school, and will examine the
positive and negative impact of inclusion (and programs that profess to
be inclusive) on students with learning disabilities. </P>

<P>Come with skepticism, questions and challenges. <BR>
Leave with answers. </P>
