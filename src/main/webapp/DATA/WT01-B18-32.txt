<P>Research Associate, The University of Texas at Austin, Marine Science
Institute. </P>

<P>Tony Amos has been with The University of Texas Marine Science Institute in
Port Aransas for the past 20 years. His oceanographic career has spanned 34
years with research expeditions to all the world's oceans and many of its seas,
including 30 cruises to the Antarctic and five to the Arctic. He is a holder of
the US Antarctic Service Medal. In Texas he has studied several aspects of
near-shore and bay and estuarine processes (circulation, currents, hydrography,
and tides) and has conducted a long-term study of the barrier island beaches
which is now in its 19th year. To date 2,535 separate surveys have been
conducted, counting birds, people, marine debris, and measuring beach widths,
dune erosion/accretion, sea temperature and salinity. In addition, over 300
separate surveys have been made specifically to assess the marine debris
problem. Amos has served on a National Academy of Sciences/National Research
Council Marine Board Committee on Shipborne Waste, and various EPA, MMS, and
other committees on the marine debris problem. He is a member of the New York
Academy of Science, the American Geophysical Union, The American Ornithological
Union, the Texas Marine Mammal Stranding Network, the Sea Turtle Stranding and
Salvage Network, and an Honorary Lifetime Member of the Texas Marine Educators
Association. He is the Port Aransas Cooperative Weather Observer for the
National Weather Service, and writes for the Port Aransas South Jetty, The
Corpus Christi Caller-Times, and the South Texas Fishing News papers. Recently
he was selected as one of the &quot;Texas Twenty&quot; by Texas Monthly magazine
for his work on the environment. </P> 
<P><B><I>Research Interests</I></B> </P> 
<P>Current research interests include the US Antarctic Marine Living Resources
(AMLR) program, now entering its eighth year of field study. Amos' contribution
to AMLR is a survey of the physical oceanography of the Elephant Island region,
which is a major area of krill (<I>Euphausia superba</I>) concentration, and
supports a krill fishery with potential to expand and target other species.
Because krill supports numerous predators (seals, whales, penguins, and flying
seabirds), the multidisciplinary AMLR project seeks to understand the
relationship between krill and its predators and the physical, chemical, and
biological environment. </P> 
<P>Work on the Texas beaches continues and now includes a weekly survey of a
remote barrier island to search for nesting and stranded sea turtles and a study
of the standing stock of marine debris on an undisturbed beach.
