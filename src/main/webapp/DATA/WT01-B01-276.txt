<P>One of the areas for which we are collecting information is our <B>Inspiration</B> section in Learn@Home. We are looking for “Success stories from teachers and students to give ideas and motivation to the people going through the process of creating a home learning environment”. Everyone is welcome to participate. Stories will be posted on a rotating basis. Maybe there are people in your local support groups who would enjoy taking part, as well.<BR>

<P>The inspiring stories should be <I>any size less than 1,000 words</I>. They may reflect the struggles as well as the rewards, and may be from anyone's perspective: students, parents, grandparents, and friends.<BR>

<P>You may <A HREF="mailto:inspiration@learnathome.com">submit stories by e-mail. </a>  We will also take submissions by fax at 703-968-4819.<BR>

<P>We are sure there are many stories out there just waiting for this opportunity to find their way onto the Internet. These stories can encourage a new homeschooling family in their efforts and stand as a tribute to those involved. Thank you.
