<img align=right src="/image/gage.gif"><b><i>"CALSTART recognized the economic and environmental benefits to be gained from the emerging industry of advanced transportation.  CALSTART serves as an example of how the consortium process works, showing how innovative transportation projects can go quickly from paper to prototype." -- Michael J. Gage President and CEO, CALSTART</i></b><p><br clear = all><br><p>


It is fitting that the nation’s oldest and largest advanced transportation consortium originated in California.  Always on the leading-edge, California finds itself once again facing issues in advance of the world: severe air pollution, defense downsizing, and fundamental changes in the global economy.<p>
These liabilities have actually created major opportunities for the Golden State.  Through CALSTART, it is taking its considerable skills in defense, aerospace and other high-tech industries and applying them to a new industry.  The venture has already shown a return in hundreds of jobs created and thousands more coming, leadership in world-leading technologies, and vehicles on the road that significantly improve air quality.  <p>

<h3><FONT COLOR=#808080>The CALSTART Mission</FONT></h3><p>
CALSTART is a state-wide, non profit consortium dedicated to creating an advanced transportation technologies industry in California that will create high-quality jobs, clean the state’s air, and improve economic competitiveness.  CALSTART accomplishes its goals by tapping the skills and experience of California’s world-leading defense, aerospace and high tech industries and teaming them with the entrepreneurial spirit for which the state is famous. <p>
This charter has launched CALSTART in just over two years from its original 40 participants to well over 100 firms and organizations.  In that time CALSTART and its private and public partners have created and operated more than 15 major technology programs totaling more than $60 million (mostly privately funded), pushing forward technologies for electric, hybrid electric and natural gas vehicles and systems.  The results have been measured in real products built, placed on the streets and demonstrated, and real companies growing, finding markets and beginning to sell those products.<p>
ARPA is just one of CALSTART’s public partners, but it’s an important one.  ARPA’s approach to innovation matches CALSTART's: seek out the best thinking and technologies; create strategic teams of companies to quickly develop prototypes and products; focus on performance, not paperwork; and operate a network of shared knowledge to maintain industry momentum.<p>

<h3><FONT COLOR=#808080>Accomplishments</FONT></h3><p><ul>
<li> Successful roll-out of the running chassis, essentially the "guts" of an electric vehicle minus the body and interior, proving that a fully capable electric vehicle can be affordably produced in consumer volumes.  Estimated final price with body and interior is under $18,000.  The 7 1/2 month development cycle sets a standard for rapid production;
<li> Nine electric pick-up trucks deployed and operating at Edwards Air Force Base, California's famous flight test center, proving out dual-use capabilities;
<li> hree hybrid electric buses completed and ready for delivery to Vandenberg Air Force Base, the West Coast space launch site.  Vehicles incorporate electric drive systems with a clean, on-board CNG-powered charging system for extended range.  Two commercial hybrid electric buses are under development, to use different drive/generator combinations;
<li> Electric station car program ready to select supplier for 45-car fleet for use at five Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) stations in the San Francisco region;
<li> Multi-vehicle charging station, using both inductive and conductive systems, finished for use at BART station; and
<li> Several electric Kewets modified for use in roles such as traffic enforcement in cities of Alhambra, Chula Vista, Irvine and Davis.<p></ul>

<h3><FONT COLOR=#808080>Future Directions</FONT></h3><p>
CALSTART currently includes more than 100 participating firms and organizations.  In the next year it intends to both advance needed technologies and encourage the involvement of more companies in the advanced transportation industry, expanding the web of creative thinking and information-sharing that is helping quickly drive this new industry forward.
Among new technology projects underway:<p><ul>
<li>	Flywheel and CNG-turbogenerator hybrid electric vehicles;
<li>	State-of-the-art low-cost hybrid "power" batteries;
<li>	Advanced electronic energy management controllers for hybrid vehicles;
<li>	High-power supercapacitors; 
<li>	Advanced fuel-storage chassis for NGVs;
<li>	Electronic valve control for multi-fuel engines. <p>
