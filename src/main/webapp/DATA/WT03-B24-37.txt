<HR>
<P>
Both industry and government offer a wide variety of positions in
information systems practice.  Traditionally, many information
systems roles in organizations have been carried out by experienced
engineers and other technically trained personnel, though often only after
lengthy apprenticeship in detailed design or analysis work.  As the complexity
of modern computer-based systems has increased, there is growing demand for
information systems skills. 
<P>
In employment, the capable information systems specialist may be given
responsibility for development of systems architecture, system standards,
database design and implementation, network design, the overall system
development plan, integration, integrated testing, or operational management of
information systems.  The responsibilities often involve managerial duties,
development of proposals, financial planning, and interaction with the client,
with correspondingly greater financial rewards than are available in less
critical aspects of the work.  Breadth of knowledge and ability to communicate
well are both especially important, as the information systems professional must
deal with specialists as well as non-technical individuals.
