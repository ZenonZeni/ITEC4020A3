DESCRIPTION.  A subdivision is a state, province, or Canada-wide unit composed of members of a specific 
international division.  The two parts of a subdivision's name consist of (a) the state, province, or Canada (if 
Canada-wide) and (b) the international division.  OH-CASE is comprises all CASE members in Ohio.  <P> 
A subdivision is responsible to both its parent division and federation (or Canadian CEC if Canada-wide).  It can 
be considered for CEC unit status only after receiving endorsement by both groups.<P> 
Subdivisions should not be referred to as "divisions" or "chapters."<P> 
Most subdivisions sponsor federation-level conference sessions; they also provide subject-specialty technical 
assistance, promote networking within their focus area, and provide a voice to enhance policy development 
across a state, province or Canada.<P> 
MEMBERSHIP.  According to CEC Delegate Assembly requirements, subdivisions must maintain unified 
membership--i.e., all CEC members who belong to the international division and whose memberships are located 
in the federation or in Canada are recognized as members of the subdivision.  Only members may vote and hold 
office.  No others are to be granted membership nor the privileges of membership.  Non-members may attend 
meetings, pay a non-member registration fee for conferences or other activities, and/or subscribe to publications 
(e.g., the newsletter), but great care must be taken to prevent the awarding or assumption of membership by 
anyone who is not a CEC and division member.<P> 
STEPS IN ORGANIZING A NEW SUBDIVISION.  Information for organizing a subdivision may be obtained 
from the Division Manager at CEC Headquarters.  The procedures are:<P> 
a.     Contact CEC Headquarters to request the requirements and procedures for official unit recognition, any 
additional requirements of the division and/or the federation, and the list of proposed subdivision members (e.g., 
division members affiliated with the federation).<BR> 
b.     Schedule a meeting to which all division members and other interested persons from the federation (or 
Canada if Canada-wide) are invited.<BR> 
c.     Ensure that there is a minimum of 15 members in the federation (or Canada if Canada- wide) to start the 
subdivision.<BR> 
d.     Appoint or elect officers and establish the committees necessary to meet the requirements established by 
CEC, the international division, and the federation.<BR> 
e.     Send the subdivision application form, the proposed constitution and bylaws, and all other attachments to 
the international division president for signature, to the federation (or Canadian CEC if Canada-wide) president 
for signature, and to CEC Headquarters to receive applicant subdivision status.<BR> 
<BR> 
REQUIREMENTS.  To function as an official subdivision of CEC, an organized group of CEC members must 
meet the following requirements which are specified in the CEC Articles of Incorporation and Constitution and 
Bylaws or have been legislated by the CEC Delegate Assembly:<P> 
a.     Maintain a minimum membership of 15 persons.<BR> 
b.     Maintain unified membership.  Subdivision members must be members of the international division and, 
thus, of The Council for Exceptional Children.<BR> 
c.     Recognize, as members of the subdivision, all CEC members who belong to the international division and 
whose memberships are located in the federation (or in Canada if it is a Canada-wide subdivision).  No others 
are to be granted membership.<BR> 
d.     Refrain from collecting subdivision membership dues, although fees for conference registration, 
publications, or for other subdivision services or activities may be charged of both members and nonmembers.  
Nonpayment of such fee(s) by a member shall <B>not</B> deprive him/her of privileges of membership, such 
as receipt of ballots and voting privileges.<BR> 
e.     Abide by all official decisions of the international division's and sponsoring federation's (or Canada's if 
Canada-wide) governing bodies as well as the CEC Delegate Assembly.<BR> 
f.     Operate under a constitution and bylaws that has been approved by CEC Headquarters (and that 
incorporates any additional requirements established by the international division and the federation) and that 
shows the name to be congruent with the name of the international division and federation (or Canada if Canada-
wide) with which it is identified.<BR> 
g.     Show in professionally appropriate ways, including on stationery and in publications, following the name of 
the subdivision:  "A Subdivision of [The Name of the Division] of The Council for Exceptional Children."<BR> 
h.     Inform CEC Headquarters of any amendments to the constitution and bylaws; CEC Headquarters will send 
a copy to the international division and to the federation.  An up-to-date copy should be on file with CEC 
Headquarters and the international division at all times.<BR> 
i.     Conduct all business transactions within the framework of provisions established by the officially adopted 
constitution and bylaws.<BR> 
j.     Select an executive body of not less than three officers.<BR> 
k.     Conduct a broad professional program in keeping with the general purposes of CEC, the international 
division, the federation (or Canadian CEC if Canada-wide), and its own special purposes.<BR> 
l.     Conduct, at regular intervals, activities that include both professional and business meetings.<BR> 
m.     Submit an annual report to CEC Headquarters, the international division, and to the federation (or 
Canadian CEC if Canada-wide).<BR> 
<BR> 
The international division and the sponsoring federation may have additional, non-conflicting requirements.<P> 
When writing/reviewing your constitution and bylaws:<P> 
*     DO make sure that you have included all of the elements required by CEC Delegate Assembly policy (listed 
above).  <B>All</B> of these elements are required for approval of your constitution.<BR> 
*     DO refer to your unit as a subdivision--not a division or chapter.<BR> 
*     DON'T provide for membership dues or membership fees.  You cannot collect money in this way, but can 
have fees for meeting or conference registration or a newsletter subscription fee.  The fees for non-members can 
be higher than for members.<BR> 
<BR> 
Be sure to provide an updated copy of your constitution to your division and federation (and CEC Headquarters 
if you are a unit of CEC) whenever you make changes to your constitution.<P> 
HOW TO OBTAIN CEC UNIT STATUS.  After your subdivision has received official recognition from both 
the international division and the sponsoring federation, you may file for CEC unit status.  The procedures 
are:<P> 
1.     Review your constitution and bylaws to ensure they meet the specified requirements.  If not, they should be 
updated.<BR> 
2.     Complete the CEC Unit Application for Subdivisions.  Send this form to your federation president (or 
Canadian CEC if Canada-wide) and international division president for signature.  If you need their addresses, 
please call us at the toll-free number.<BR> 
3.     After both signatures have been obtained, send the subdivision application form and your constitution and 
bylaws to:  Susan Simmons, Division Manager, Membership Department, The Council for Exceptional Children, 
1920 Association Drive, Reston, VA 22091-1589.<BR> 
<BR> 
CEC Headquarters staff will review your application and supporting documents, then contact you.<P> 
PRIVILEGES.  A subdivision exercises autonomy of operation within the framework of the CEC Articles of 
Incorporation and Constitution and Bylaws and the regulations adopted by the Delegate Assembly and may:<P> 
a.     Plan its own professional programs and develop its own projects.<BR> 
b.     Determine its own financial program.  A subdivision is autonomous in deciding how its income is to be 
spent.<BR> 
c.     Include in its constitution and bylaws provisions that will strengthen the subdivision.<BR> 
d.     Receive a charter upon fulfillment of the requirements.<BR> 
<BR> 
The international division and the sponsoring federation may provide additional privileges and support as 
outlined below.<P> 
CEC UNIT PRIVILEGES FOR SUBDIVISIONS.  A subdivision can be considered for CEC unit status only 
after receiving endorsement by both its parent division and federation (or Canadian CEC if Canada-wide).  
Subdivisions who are units of CEC automatically receive their quarterly membership rosters, the 
<I>Membership Bulletin</I> newsletter, and other information and materials sent throughout the year to 
units.<P> 
DIVISION SUPPORT.  Examples of practices by international divisions to advance the relationships with their 
subdivisions are:<P> 
&iuml;     Distribute a summary of the meetings of the division's board of directors to the presidents of the 
subdivisions.<BR> 
&iuml;     Request input from the subdivisions on division programs, publications, activities and services.<BR> 
&iuml;     Highlight activities of the subdivisions in the division's newsletter.<BR> 
&iuml;     Provide annual membership rebates.  It should be noted that the divisions are not required to provide 
rebates.  Those that do set the rebate amount, qualification requirements, and deadlines.<BR> 
&iuml;     Provide seed money, grants or loans for conferences, publications, or other subdivision 
activities/services.<BR> 
&iuml;     Host a meeting of the subdivision representatives at the CEC annual convention.<BR> 
&iuml;     Invite subdivision officers and members to serve as division delegates at the Delegate Assembly.<BR> 
&iuml;     Inform the subdivision presidents of the identities of the other subdivision presidents.<BR> 
&iuml;     Solicit nominations of subdivision officers for division offices.<BR> 
<BR> 
FEDERATION SUPPORT.  Examples of practices by federations to advance the relationships with their 
subdivisions are:<P> 
&iuml;     Some federations include a representative from each recognized subdivision in their governing body 
(e.g., board of directors).  Most of these representatives receive full voting privileges and are full participants on 
the board.<BR> 
&iuml;     Devote one issue each year of their newsletter to the subdivisions or regularly provide space in their 
newsletter for subdivision news.<BR> 
&iuml;     Provide seed money, grants or loans for conferences, publications, or other subdivision 
activities/services.<BR> 
&iuml;     Provide time and space at the federation's annual conference for subdivision business and membership 
meetings.<BR> 
&iuml;     Allocate session time slots to subdivisions to select sessions for the federation's annual 
conference.<BR> 
&iuml;     Co-sponsor conferences and/or conference activities (speakers, social events, etc.).<BR> 
&iuml;     Provide rebates to subdivisions for their members attending the federation's annual conference.<BR> 
<BR> 
CEC HEADQUARTERS SUPPORT.  In addition to the benefits extended to subdivisions who are units of the 
Council, subdivisions may also call upon the Division Manager and the Membership Department at CEC 
Headquarters for assistance and materials.  The Division Manager is the subdivision's contact for membership 
lists, mailing labels (3c per name plus 10% for handling and 1st class postage; minimum charge of $5.50)--useful 
for newsletter mailings and membership development activities, and CEC and division membership brochures 
and applications.  Call the CEC Membership Department toll-free at 1-800-845-6232, or FAX us at 703/264-
9494.<P> 
THE ANNUAL REPORT AND OFFICER LIST.  At the end of their term of office, the outgoing President 
should submit their annual report plus the officer list for the upcoming year.  CEC Delegate Assembly policy 
requires that all subdivisions submit an annual report to their division and federation.  Those subdivisions who 
are units of CEC must also submit their annual report and officer list to CEC Headquarters.  The forms are sent 
to unit Presidents each Spring; or call the CEC Membership Department at the toll-free number to obtain these 
forms.
