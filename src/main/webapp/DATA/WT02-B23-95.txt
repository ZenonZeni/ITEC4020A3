<CENTER><H1>What Is A+ Certification?</H1></CENTER>
<BR>
<P> A+ Certification is a testing program sponsored by the Computing Technology Industry Association (CompTIA) 
that certifies the competency of service technicians in the computer industry.  Anyone who wants a nationally-
recognized credential as a competent computer service professional can take the A+ exams.  The program is backed by 
major computer hardware and software vendors, distributors, resellers and publications, as well as a leading industry 
service organization, the Association of Field Service Management, Inc. The test, which is administered by Drake 
Prometric (Bloomington, MN), was first available in July 1993, with periodic updates since then. <P>
<BR>
<P>Earning A+ certification means that you possess the knowledge, skills, and customer relations skills essential for a 
successful computer service technician, as defined by experts from companies across the industry.  The exams cover a 
broad range of hardware and software technologies, but are not related to any vendor-specific products.  More than 40 
organizations have contributed time and budget resources to develop the A+ computer-based tests.</P><BR>
<P>To become certified, you must pass two test modules – the Core and one of two other specialties, either the Microsoft™ 
Windows/DOS module or the Macintosh module. When candidates pass the Core plus a specialty, they receive a 
certificate that mentions the specialty module they passed, such as</P>

<MENU>
<BR><LI>A+ Certification Exam with a specialty in Microsoft™ Windows®/DOS® environments
<BR><LI>A+ Certification Exam with a specialty in Macintosh™ OS-based Computers
<BR></MENU><BR>
Individuals who were already A+ certified when the enhanced exams 'went live' in April 1995 need not retake the test 
to remain A+ certified. Candidates for certification may register by phone by calling 1-800-77-MICRO (1-800-776-4276) and schedule 
their testing session at a Drake Authorized Testing Center, in any of the 50 states nationwide, and in 150+ other 
countries worldwide.  Candidates who pass the two computer-based test modules become certified, demonstrating 
basic knowledge of configuring, installing, diagnosing, repairing, upgrading, and maintaining microcomputers and 
associated technologies.<BR><HR>
<CENTER><H2>Why Certification is Important</H2></CENTER>
<BR>
Individual service technicians gain valuable benefits from becoming A+ certified, including:

<BR><MENU>
<BR><LI>Recognized proof of professional achievement:  The A+ credential validates that the holder has reached a level of 
competence commonly accepted and valued by the industry.
<BR><LI>Enhanced job opportunities:   Many employers give preference in hiring applicants with A+ Certification.  Some 
employers may require A+ as a condition of employment. They view A+ as proof that a new hire knows the 
procedures and technologies required to be a successful computer service technician.
<BR><LI>Opportunity for advancement:   The A+ credential can be a plus when an employer awards job advancements and 
promotions.
<BR><LI>Training requirement:  A+ Certification may be required as a pre-requisite to attending a vendor's training course, so employers will offer advanced training to 
those employees who are already A+ Certified.
<BR><LI>Customer confidence:  As the general public learns about A+, customers will require that only certified technicians be 
assigned to their accounts.  The technician then arrives at a client site already known as a competent computer service 
professional. The industry also gains benefits from the widespread acceptance of the A+ credential, including:
<BR><LI>Lower training costs:  Resellers and other employers of service technicians can save money and increase productive 
work-time when vendors eliminate redundant, time-consuming base-level training and instead require A+ Certification 
as a pre-requisite.
<BR><LI>Customer satisfaction:  When employees have a credential that proves their competency, customer expectations are 
more likely met.  More business may then be generated for the employer through repeat sales to these satisfied 
customers.
<BR><LI>Self-regulation of the industry:  Several states have proposed legislation that would regulate the microcomputer 
industry.  A self-regulating industry that certifies its own members with a program such as A+ can often minimize 
such government-imposed controls.</MENU><BR>
<HR><BR>
<CENTER><H2>Who May Take the Tests</H2></CENTER>
<BR><BR>
A+ Certification is open to anyone who wants to take the tests.  No specific requirements are necessary, except 
payment of the fee.  Individuals may retake the test modules as often as they like, but the Core and one specialty must 
be passed within 90 days of each other in order to become certified.
<BR><BR><HR><BR>
<CENTER><H2>How the Program Was Developed</CENTER></H2>
<BR><BR>
Developing the A+ service technician test modules is a rigorous, continuous and thorough process, resulting in 
statistically-proven validity and reliability.  A long list of CompTIA member companies, including the world's largest 
computer vendors, distributors, resellers, and third-party maintenance organizations, joined together to develop the A+ 
test.  Committees consisting of CompTIA members spent hundreds of hours to develop a Certification program that is 
relevant to the industry as a whole.  They contributed enormous resources to ensure that all aspects of the A+ 
Certification exams meet the highest quality standards. Hands-on service technicians from manufacturers and resellers 
defined the test content.<BR><BR>
The questions were written by experts in the field of microcomputer service.  A multi-level review process for all the 
questions ensured that they are accurate as well as psychometrically sound.  Those who participated in writing the 
questions and reviewing them are confident that candidates will find the tests tough but fair.<BR><BR>
The representatives from CompTIA, with the assistance and advice of Drake Prometric experts who administer the test, 
prepared the examination.  The two organizations jointly hold responsibility for its validity.<BR><BR>

<CENTER><H2>How To Register for Tests</H2></CENTER>
<BR>
<CENTER><H3>Call 1-800-77-MICRO</H3></CENTER>

To register to take any A+ test, call this number and talk to a Drake Prometric registrar.  The registrar provides 
information about the tests and finds a convenient testing center and time for you to take your test.  You schedule an 
appointment to take the exams and arrange for payment of the testing fee.
Please have the following information handy when you call:
<BR><MENU>
<BR><LI>Social Security number
<BR><LI>Complete mailing address and phone number
<BR><LI>Employer or organization
<BR><LI>Date you want to take the test
<BR><LI>Method of payment (credit card number or check)</MENU><BR><BR>
You must pay for a test before you take it.  Payment is made at the time of registration, either by giving a credit card 
number or by requesting an invoice be sent to you or your employer.  Vouchers and coupons are redeemed at this time, 
when applicable.<BR><BR>
An exam must be taken within six months of payment.  Scheduling may be arranged up to six weeks in advance.  After 
making an appointment for an exam, you will receive verbal instructions about the cancellation procedures and directions 
to the testing center location. <BR><BR>
<CENTER><H2>Test Fees</H2></CENTER>
The fee for taking the A+ Certification tests differs according to whether or not individuals are employed by organizations that 
are members of CompTIA. Also, taking two or three modules at one seating saves money.   The current pricing schedule:<BR><BR>
<STRONG>For Members:</STRONG> 
<MENU>
<LI>Any Module Alone $ 90
<BR><LI>Core +1 Module    150
<BR><LI>Core +2 Modules   195
<BR><LI>2 Modules         150
</MENU>
<STRONG>For Non-Members</STRONG>
<MENU>
<LI>Any Module Alone $100 
<BR><LI>Core +1 Module    165
<BR><LI>Core +2 Modules   215
<BR><LI>2 Modules         165
</MENU>

Pay for the A+ test at the same time you call to register.  You may use a credit card or have an invoice sent to you or 
your employer.  If you have an invoice sent, you can pay by check.  Remember that you cannot schedule time at the 
testing center until Drake has received your payment in full.

<CENTER><H3>Cancellation Policy</H3></CENTER>
You may cancel or reschedule a test no later than 48 hours prior to the test date.  If you cancel or reschedule later than 
48 hours prior to the test date, you will forfeit your payment.

<CENTER><H3>Taking the Test</H3></CENTER>

You should arrive at the testing center at least 15 minutes before the test is scheduled to begin.  You should identify 
yourself to the administrator of the testing center; you will then have an opportunity to learn how to use the computer-
based testing system before your actual test begins.Bring two forms of identification with you.  One form should be a photo ID, such as a valid driver's license or a passport.  
The other can be a major credit card.Books, calculators, laptop computers, or other reference materials are not allowed during any A+ test.  Because the 
tests are computer-based, you will not need pens, pencils, or paper.
<CENTER><H3>After the Test</H3></CENTER>
As soon as you finish a test, you receive the final score.  You see the results immediately on the computer screen.  In 
addition, a hard copy of the score report is provided at the testing center.
The score report shows whether you passed the exam or not.  You can also see how well you did on each section of the 
test.
<BR><BR>
After you pass the Core exam and one specialty module, an A+ Certification certificate will be mailed to you within a 
few days.  You will also receive a lapel pin and credit-card sized credential that shows you are A+ certified.
If you do not pass the exam, you can register at any time to take the exam again.  But the Core and specialty module 
must be taken within 90 days of each other.  If you fail to pass both exams within 90 days, you will not be granted 
certification.  You would then have to retake the Core exam, even if you had passed it previously, as well as retake the 
specialty module.
<BR><BR>
The A+ Service Technician exams cover generic content areas.  The Core module content covers procedures and 
information about technologies that are not related to vendor-specific products.  Instead, the Core test is a tool to 
demonstrate your fundamental knowledge related to the tasks of a computer service technician, without regard for brand 
of products.<BR><BR>
The specialty modules focus on the tasks of a computer service technician that are related to operating system 
environments commonly encountered in the industry:  Microsoft™ Windows/DOS environments and the Mac operating 
system.  <BR><BR>
Even though the tests are designed to cover fundamental level knowledge and skills, they are still challenging.

<CENTER><H1>Certification For Imaging Professionals</H1></CENTER>
<CENTER><H2>The Competitive Edge Of The 90s</H2></CENTER>
<P>CDIA (Certified Document Imaging Architect) is a program for document 
imaging professionals. This certification program will test for base-line 
competency. The program is backed by major hardware and software vendors, 
distributors, resellers and publications, as well as the computer industry's 
major organization: the Computing Technology Industry Association.  The test 
is scheduled to "go live" in the fourth quarter of 1995, with periodic 
updates after that.</P>

Anyone who wants a nationally-recognized credential as a competent document 
imaging professional can take the CDIA test. The test requires a command 
of the fundamental knowledge of what makes up an imaging system.<BR><BR>

Candidates for certification register by phone and schedule their testing 
session at a Drake Prometric Authorized Testing Center, in any of the 50 
states nationwide, and in 80+ other countries worldwide. Candidates who 
pass the computer-based test become certified, demonstrating basic knowledge 
of the major areas and technologies that make up or affect an imaging system:  
input/capture; display; storage; records management, retrieval and indexing; 
communications/networking; output; and imaging business issues.<BR><BR>

Earning CDIA certification means that you possess the knowledge, skills, 
and customer relations skills essential for a successful imaging solution 
provider, as defined by experts from companies across the industry. More 
than 26 organizations have contributed more than two hundred and thirty 
five thousand dollars and thousands of hours of time to research, develop 
and provide the computer-based test.<BR><BR><HR>
<CENTER><H2>Why Certification is Important</H2></CENTER>
Individual imaging architects gain valuable benefits from becoming CDIA 
certified:<MENU>
<LI>Enhanced job opportunities. Potential employers may give preference in hiring those who are CDIA 
certified. They view CDIA as proof that the new hire knows the generic procedures and fundamental 
technologies required to be a successful imaging solutions provider.
<BR><LI>Recognized proof of professional achievement. The CDIA credential validates that 
the holder has reached a level of competence commonly accepted and valued by the industry.
<BR><LI>Opportunity for advancement. The CDIA credential can be a plus when 
an employer awards job enhancements and promotions. Becoming CDIA certified 
may also serve as a pre-requisite to attending a course, or perhaps testing 
out of a portion of a course, which may lead to job advancement. </MENU>
The industry also gains benefits from the widespread acceptance of the CDIA credential, including:<MENU>
<BR><LI>Lower training costs. Resellers and other employers of imaging professionals can save money and 
increase productive work-time when vendors eliminate redundant time-
consuming base-level training and instead require CDIA certification as a pre-requisite.
<BR><LI>Customer satisfaction. When employees have a credential that proves their competency, customer 
expectations are more likely met. More business is then generated for the employer through repeat sales to 
these satisfied customers.
<BR><LI>Self-regulation of the industry. Several states have proposed legislation that would regulate the 
microcomputer industry. A self-regulating industry that certifies its own members with a program like CDIA 
can often avoid such government control.</MENU>
<CENTER><H2>Who May Take the Test?</H2></CENTER>
CDIA Certification is open to anyone who wants to take the test. No specific requirement is necessary, 
except payment of the fee. Individuals may retake the test as often as they like.<BR><BR>

the Computing Technology Industry Association at (708) 268-1818, ext. 
301, for more information (or to put your name on a list for 
notification just prior to the test going live). Once the test “goes 
live,” you can register to take the CDIA test, by calling Drake 
Prometric.  

The registrar will provide information about the test and find a 
convenient testing center and time to take the test. You schedule an 
appointment to take the exam and arrange for payment of the testing 
fee. Once live testing begins, you will need to have the following 
information handy when you call to register:              

•       Social Security number
•	Complete mailing address and phone number
•	Employer or organization
•	Date you want to take the test
•       Method of payment (credit card or check)

You must pay for the test before you take it. Payment is made at the 
time of registration, either by giving a credit card number or by 
requesting an invoice be sent to you or your employer. Vouchers and 
coupons are redeemed at this time, when applicable. The exam must be 
taken within six months of payment. Scheduling may be arranged up to 
six weeks in advance. After making an appointment for an exam, you 
will receive verbal instructions about the cancellation procedures and 
directions to the nearest testing center location – with over 750 
locations worldwide.<HR>
<CENTER><STRONG>Test Fees</STRONG></CENTER> <PRE>

The fee for taking the CDIA Certification test differs according to 
whether or not individuals are employed by organizations that are 
members of CompTIA.

        For those employed by CompTIA members  $150
        For others      $165</PRE>

Pay for the CDIA test at the same time you call to register. You may 
use a credit card or have an invoice sent to you or your employer. If 
you have an invoice sent, you can pay by check. Remember that you 
cannot schedule time at the testing center until Drake Prometric has 
received your payment in full.</PRE><HR>
<CENTER><STRONG>Cancellations</STRONG></CENTER><PRE>

     You may cancel or reschedule a test no later than 48 hours prior 
to the test date. If you cancel or reschedule later than 48 hours 
prior to test date, you will forfeit your payment. Taking the test You 
should arrive at the testing center at least 15 minutes before the 
test is scheduled to begin. You will identify yourself to the 
administrator of the testing center and have an opportunity to learn 
how to use the computer-based testing system before your actual test 
begins. 

     Bring two forms of identification with you. One form should be a 
photo ID such as a valid driver’s license. The other can be a major 
credit card, or a passport. Books, calculators, laptop computers, or 
other reference materials are not allowed during the test. Because the 
test is computer-based, you will not need pens, pencils, or paper. 

     After the test As soon as you finish the test, you receive the final 
score. You will see the results immediately on the computer screen. In 
addition, a hard copy of the score report is provided at the test 
center. The score report shows whether you passed the exam or not. You 
can also see how well you did on each section of the test and on each 
technology. (Sections and technologies are described later in this 
brochure.) The score report will look similar to this one.

     If you pass the exam, a CDIA Certification certificate will be 
mailed to you within a few days. If you do not pass the exam, you can 
register at any time to take the exam again. The CDIA exam for imaging 
solutions professionals covers generic content areas; the questions 
are mainly related to procedures and information about technologies 
that are not related to specific vendor-supplied products. Instead, 
the test is a tool to demonstrate your fundamental knowledge related 
to the tasks of developing a document imaging solution, without regard 
for brand. But even though the test is fundamental, it is still 
challenging.                                        </PRE>

<CENTER><STRONG>Storage Section</STRONG></CENTER><PRE>

This section of the CDIA exam tests your knowledge of topics such as:

•       What technologies are available for data storage that will 
          meet all of the requirements of a complex document 
          management system?

        There is no single type of data storage that will meet all of 
        the requirements.  Most document imaging systems include a 
        variety of different storage technologies:

        *  RAID (Redundant Array of Inexpensive Drives) – this is a 
        good storage companion for optical storage.  Fast data 
        transfer rates, large image files, safety, expandability, and 
        fault tolerant.

        *  HSM (Hierarchical Storage Management) – disk, optical and 
        tape are used in a hierarchy to maximize performance while 
        reducing storage costs.  HSM systems automatically migrate the 
        data from primary storage on the file server to secondary 
        storage – i.e., disk drives, optical jukeboxes, tape 
        libraries.

        *  Magneto Optical – speedy random access to data, 
        per-megabyte cost-effective, reliability, long media life, 
        multi-function capabilities and portability, seek times range 
        from 20-50 ms.

        *  Optical Jukeboxes – provides for high capacity, near line 
        storage of documents. WORM, rewritable and multi-function 
        media are available in 3-1/2_ to 5-1/4_ formats to meet a 
        variety of storage needs.                    </PRE><HR>

The CDIA test is administered on a computer at a Drake Prometric 
Authorized Testing Center, in an easy-to-use format, in a 
computer-based format.

The format of the test on the computer looks very much like other 
examinations that you have taken before. The difference is, you take 
this exam on a desktop computer connected into a testing network, 
where all the data is stored centrally and securely. Directions for 
using the testing software are displayed on the screen. A tutorial is 
provided as is the assistance of a nearby proctor. On-screen “help” is 
also available, including information at the bottom of the screen that 
lets you know how to enter your answer, move forward in the test, mark 
a question for answering later, or review a previous question. Of 
course, the software tells you how to enter the answer, not what 
answer to enter. 

The CDIA exam includes a variety of questions and formats. The exact 
set and sequence of questions varies with each sign on. Every question 
has at least one correct answer provided in the list of alternative 
choices you are given on screen. Question formats Questions may appear 
in any of the following formats 

•       Situational 
•       Traditional 
•       Identification

Situational questions describe a situation or scenario commonly 
encountered by document imaging professionals while on the job.  Your 
choice of answers will list different ways to resolve the problem or 
situation.

Traditional multiple-choice questions appear most commonly on the 
test.  These questions ask you to fill in the blank or pick the 
correct answer to a question from a given list of choices.

Identification questions may include a diagram, flowchart, or 
illustration with several items called out with arrows, numbers or 
letters.  You are asked to choose the answer that correctly identifies 
what is being shown or described in the question.

No matter what the format of the question, there will be at least one 
correct answer and your challenge is to select it.  When there are 
multiple correct answers, a message at the bottom of the screen tells 
you to “choose all that apply.”  Be sure to read the messages.


GOOD LUCK WITH THE CDIA CERTIFICATION EXAM FOR IMAGING PROFESSIONALS!

You probably know more than you think you do!

<HR>
<CENTER><H1>IT Skills</H1></CENTER><PRE>

Taking a giant step toward the first industry-wide, vendor independent 
certification program for Information Technology (IT) Skills, 
representatives of seven leading companies met recently under the 
umbrella of the Computing Technology Industry Association (CompTIA) in 
Santa Clara, CA, to sketch out the broad outlines of a new multi-phase 
effort.  Phase I of the IT Skills program will focus on certification 
of individuals who perform networking and connectivity-related 
operations.

Calling themselves the ITSkills Certification Committee, the group of 
seven that met in Santa Clara also released a mission statement for 
the new initiative:  “Define and drive the worldwide adoption of 
Information Technology job skills standards and certifications that 
meet the changing needs of IT professionals, employers and clients.”

The seven companies that formed the committee, under the auspices of 
CompTIA, represent a broad cross-section of the computer industry.  In 
taking this important step, they have assumed a leadership role in 
formulating the ITSkills certification program by collectively 
agreeing to fund project costs and commit the necessary resources and 
people to ensure the initiative’s success.  Companies represented at 
the Santa Clara meeting included:  Banyan Systems, Compaq, 
Hewlett-Packard, IBMPCCompany, Lotus Develop ment, Microsoft, and 
Novell.

An Industry-Driven Initiative

“We are excited to be a part of the effort that will bring to the 
industry a certification program that will benefit everyone, beginning 
with our corporate computing end-user customers to the resellers and 
back up the channel to the manufacturers.  Certification has been an 
on-going critical need in the computer industry for a long time and an 
issue CompTIA has addressed in other arenas for the past three years, 
notably A+and our  new Certified Document Imaging Architect 
designation.  We believe the plan th at was just developed meets all 
the criteria and needs of each of the channel segments that have 
grappled with the issue of multi-vendor certification over the years,” 
said John Venator, Executive Vice President and CEO of CompTIA.

“We expect that in the near future, ‘IT Skills Certified’ will be a 
new standard in the computer industry,” noted Barbara Faucett, 
CompTIAChairman and Executive Director of LMBMicrocomputers in 
Indianapolis.  “It will symbolize technical competency and provide 
many bottom-line benefits to resellers, customers, and manufacturers 
alike.”

The new program underscores CompTIA’s commitment to improving the 
professionalism of the computer and information technology industries 
and is designed to meet several important objectives: 

     (1) providing a benchmark of expertise and competency in the increasingly 
         complicated area of Information Technology; 
     (2) increasing public confidence in the computer reseller and service 
          channels; 
     (3) building individual competency and self-esteem; and 
     (4) providing a framework for professional growth.

“Customers have long been asking for a certification framework that 
reflects the multivendor nature of Information Technology today,” 
commented Nancy Lewis, Director of Education andCertification at 
Microsoft in Redmond, WA.  

“The CompTIAtask force is uniquely positioned to meet this 
requirement, because it combines the broad base of experience of 
IT-certification industry leaders and access to ITprofessionals 
worldwide.”  Microsoft is a long-time member of CompTIA and 
participates in a variety of Associati on programs, including the 
ITSkills Certification Committee.

“Due to the large number of multi-vendor enterprise networks, 
customers need cohesive standards of competence to completely leverage 
networking technology,” said Dorene Woodrow, Customer Services Product 
Manager  at Banyan Systems in Westboro, MA, and a participant on the 
IT Skills Certification Committee.  “CompTIA has the ability to 
deliver the performance standards that will benefit IT professionals 
and clients throughout the industry.”

Why Another Certification Program?

“Novell has always been – and continues to be – committed to 
multi-vendor certification,” said Rick Romine, Director of Strategic 
Development at Novell Education in San Jose, CA.  “Novell has been at 
the heart of this issue from the beginning, and we are continuing to 
work with vendors, industry associations, and professionals to create 
these multi-vendor initiatives.”

Romine went on to say, “The multi-vendor certification we are pursuing 
with the Computing Technology Industry Association (CompTIA) will 
ensure a base level of competence in key IT skills for computer 
professionals.  Much of the success of the industry depends on the end 
user’s acceptance and usage of new technologies, and the industry’s 
ability to adequately integrate and service those technologies.  
That’s what makes multi-vendor certification – and our relationship 
with CompTIA – so important.  CompTIA h as the necessary commitment to 
the program to expedite and accelerate its development. Everyone, 
especially the end user, will benefit from that commitment.”

Program Development

Prior to beginning development of the new program, several of the 
vendors participating in the ITSkills Certification Committee 
conducted a survey of end-user customers.  The information from those 
studies is being used, along with input from training and IS managers, 
to define a job profile, highlighting the key job tasks and 
responsibilities of ITprofessionals. Certification exams will then be 
developed and administered to ensure that individuals have mastered 
the fundamentals of their job.  Successful c andidates will receive a 
certificate acknowledging their ITSkills credential. Exams will be 
offered periodically throughout subsequent years, with recertification 
required.

A Track Record of Results and Successes

CompTIA’s involvement in industry-wide, vendor-neutral certification 
began over two years ago when it launched a similarCertification 
program, called A+, for computer service technicians.  The ITSkills 
Certification will follow the successful model of A+, although in an 
entirely different arena. Dedicated to strengthening and growing the 
computer industry, CompTIA’s A+ multi-vendor certification program met 
and exceeded its initial target of 5,000 certified computer service 
technicians in its first year.  Further, A+ Certification has gotten 
high marks throughout the computer industry with more than 40 of the 
industry’s leading vendors rallying behind it with their financial 
support and technical expertise.

“We have achieved significant milestones in the A+ program, with more 
than 16,000 Service Technicians currently A+Certified and some 1,005 
A+Authorized Service Centers across the U.S. and Canada,” CompTIA’s 
Venator explained.  “In mid-1994, we began exploring the possibilities 
for broadening our certification efforts to include new technologies 
and new professions.  The ITSkills Certification Committee is an 
offshoot of those efforts.”  Venator went on to say, “We are bringing 
the educational benefits and o pportunities of certification to more 
industry players with this latest effort.  As a result, we will have a 
better educated and technically proficient base of computer 
professionals.”
