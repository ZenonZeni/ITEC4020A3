<title>Premarin - Update</title>

<h2> Premarin Update by Bonnie Stoehn</h2>

<h5> PREMARIN is a hormone replacement drug made from the urine of pregnant mares.  It is prescribed almost exclusively to women during menopause.  The mares are kept factory farm style for most of their pregnancy in stalls too small to allow them to turn around.  Last year over 70,000 mares stood row after row, chained by the head, fitted with suspended collection apparatus that does not allow them to lie down.  Some foals are killed after birth but most are taken from their mothers after 3-4 months and sold to slaughter.  Mares who can no longer produce are also sent to slaughter. With the exception of a few farms in North Dakota, all production farms are located in remote areas of Canada. </h5>

<p>Once again this July, I traveled to England to teach Humane Horse Handling at the Redwings Horse Sanctuary in Norwich.  The minute I arrived I was handed a list of news reporters who had called for interviews.  It seems the article which appeared in our Spring newsletter on Premarin was the breaking story in the United Kingdom regarding the abuse and slaughter involved in the production of this estrogen substitute; as the name implies, Premarin is derived from pregnant mares' urine.  The drug is prescribed to millions of menopausal women all over the world. </p>

<p>I spent three weeks talking with concerned doctors, reporters, women, and even a micro-biologist about Premarin and its manufacture.  I also met with the public relations representative of Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories, the sole manufacturer of the
drug.  The representative has become quite busy doing damage control as thousands of British women on the drug are demanding plant derived synthetic alternatives from their doctors.</p>

<p>This meeting was a unique opportunity for me to discuss our supporters' concerns about   the production of this drug with Wyeth-Ayerst.  I brought to the drug representative's attention that the pregnant mares' water intake is purposely restricted to ensure their urine be more concentrated, and therefore, worth more money. (Horses whose diets consist of dry roughage such as hay, require free access to water to guarantee their good health.) The rep countered by saying the veterinarians that Wyeth used did not consider withholding water from the pregnant mares' to be a problem.</p>

The drug company claims that, "Horses are in no way mistreated as a consequence of the manufacture of Premarin."  Again, I questioned this statement asking their rep, "What about the 70,000 plus foals that were taken from their mothers last year at four months of age and sent to slaughter?"  She insisted that the manufacture' of Premarin "...has nothing to do with that. The foals belong to the farmers and are of no concern to Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories and therefore, we have no responsibility as to their future."</p>

<p>The drug rep had a ready answer and/or denial for every point I brought up until I showed her photographs from the March 25, 1994 issue of Farmers' Weekly of mares chained in their tiny stalls. (See photo above). Looking closely, she muttered under her breath, "But they told me the mares could turn around and lie down!"  It seems the manufacturer of the most widely used prescription drug in the United states is telling a lot of people a lot of things. (Wyeth's official recommendation to farmers is that a stall be four feet wide for a 1,300 pound horse, and five feet wide for those over 1,700 pounds.)</p>

<p>Meanwhile, sales of Premarin in this last year reached $700 MILLION. The company is expanding its facilities in anticipation of making more $$$$ as Baby-Boomers approach menopause; as the demand increases, so does the potential for profit. Currently, over 1,200 farmers have applied for permits to produce pregnant mares' urine. </p>

<p>Since the first Premarin article which appeared in our Spring newsletter, we have received hundreds of letters from women throughout North America voicing their outrage. They tell
us they have met with their gynecologists and stopped using Premarin.  According to a recent medical survey, 63% of doctors across America are now recommending synthetic alternatives as well as lifestyle changes. If you are on Premarin, talk to your doctor today about the alternatives available.</p>
