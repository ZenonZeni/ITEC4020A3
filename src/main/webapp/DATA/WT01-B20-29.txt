<p align="center"><b>Pierce County Superior Court Judge Rules<br>
That Cancer Patient Should Be Allowed To Use Marijuana</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>October 13, 1995, Tacoma, WA:</b>&nbsp; In a
decision that may be a first for the nation, Superior Court Judge
Rosanne Buckner has ruled that a cancer patient's need to use
marijuana as medicine overrides the state's interest in outlawing
its prescription. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Defendant Ralph Seeley--a former journalist, lawyer, and cancer
patient--accomplished what no one else has done in a quarter
century of attempts.&nbsp; Seeley filed a declaratory judgment
action in Pierce County Superior Court, asking for a ruling that
the State's Constitution's reliance on &quot;fundamental
principles&quot; requires that marijuana be available as a
prescription substance.&nbsp; This past Friday, the Honorable
Judge Buckner agreed.&nbsp; A final order is being prepared. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;I think, practically speaking, the effect [of this ruling]
is to put prosecutions for medical marijuana use on hold,&quot;
Seeley said.&nbsp; During the court proceedings, Seeley's moving
argument contained numerous references to his own experiences as
a cancer patient, forced to choose between breaking the law or
enduring unbearable suffering.&nbsp; Seeley has undergone eight
surgeries on his spine, two lung surgeries--including the removal
of one lung--radiation, and several bouts of chemotherapy.&nbsp;
He faces another surgery next month. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Jeffrey Steinborn, a Seattle lawyer who has represented a number
of clients in medical marijuana cases, called the ruling
significant.&nbsp; &quot;I think it's going to open the door to a
new wave of attempts to make this a legitimate medicine,&quot;
commented Steinborn, who is a friend of Seeley's.&nbsp; &quot;There's
a crack in the door now, a crack in the shell and I think it's
going to spread.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;It is monstrous to say [that] this substance cannot be used
as a medicine by people who are dying,&quot; Steinborn
concluded.&nbsp; &quot;I challenge any federal official to come
and debate the wisdom of this.&quot; <br>

<p align="center"><b>(As Expected) Governor Wilson Vetoes Medical
Marijuana Bill<br>
Californians For Compassionate Use Band Together To File Medical
Marijuana Initiative</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>October 16, 1995, Sacramento CA:</b>&nbsp;
California Governor Pete Wilson vetoed a bill (A.B. 1529) by
Assemblyman John Vasconcellos to allow for the prescribed medical
use of marijuana by the sick and terminally ill.&nbsp; The
legislation would have provided for the controlled compassionate use
of marijuana for those individuals diagnosed by a physician to be
suffering from the diseases of AIDS, cancer, glaucoma, and
multiple sclerosis.&nbsp; This is the third consecutive time that
Wilson has vetoed a medical marijuana proposal. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In reaction to Wilson's veto, a coalition of AIDS activists,
cancer survivors, seniors, nurses, and medical experts have filed
a medical marijuana initiative with the California Attorney
General's Office.&nbsp; Marijuana activist and head of
Californians for Compassionate Use, Dennis Peron, will be directing
the initiative drive. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The initiative maintains that any patients who possess a valid
doctor's recommendation should be allowed to use marijuana as a
therapeutic agent without fear or risk of prosecution.&nbsp; The initiative
also allows citizens to cultivate their own marijuana for
personal use and encourages state and federal governments to
establish a program that will provide for a safe and affordable
method of distribution.&nbsp; This coalition has 150 days to
collect 600,000 signatures. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Using patients as pawns is not right,&quot; declared Anna
Boyce, RN, in response to the governor's action.&nbsp; Boyce is
president of the petition drive as well as an elected member of
the California Senior Legislature.&nbsp; &quot;Marijuana helps
people who are suffering; it is being denied to them for purely political
reasons and that must change.&quot; <br>

<p align="center"><b>HEMPILATION CD Draws National Attention On
CNN</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>September 13, 1993, New York City, NY:</b>&nbsp;
Showbiz Today, a regular half hour program on CNN, featured a
segment on the growing controversy surrounding the release of HEMPILATION:
Freedom Is NORML.&nbsp; HEMPILATION is the first ever major
release devoted solely to the &quot;wonders of weed.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The approximately two minute news segment featured positive
comments from <b>NORML</b>'s Deputy Director Allen St. Pierre as
well as musicians Ian Moore and B-Real of Cypress Hill.&nbsp;
Both Moore and Cypress Hill are featured on the CD. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The CNN piece also featured criticism from David Chamberlain of
the Washington DC-based Family Research Council.&nbsp; Stating
that be hoped that Capricorn Records would abandon the project,
Chamberlain commented that he felt the CD would encourage
teenagers to try marijuana. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">A portion of the profits of the CD go directly to benefit the
National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws.&nbsp;
HEMPILATION: Freedom Is NORML hit record stores across the nation
on September 26.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Meanwhile, Drug Czar Lee Brown Is Not Amused</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>October 19,1995, Washington, DC:</b>&nbsp; The
Washington Post recently reported that Drug Czar Lee Brown is
steaming over the release of HEMPILATION: Freedom Is NORML.&nbsp;
The Post quoted Brown as stating that song titles appearing on
the CD such as &quot;I Wanna Get High&quot; and &quot;Who's Got
the Herb&quot; were &quot;enough to make one sick.&quot;&nbsp;
Brown is set to voice his frustration over the CD as well as what
he considers to be Hollywood's overall glorification of marijuana
in a speech to the Entertainment Industries Council in Los
Angeles. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Other prohibitionist groups who have recently voiced their ardent
disapproval over the release of the HEMPILATION CD include the
Atlanta-based Parents Resource and Information on Drug Education
(PRIDE), the Center on Addiction and Substances Abuse (CASA), and
the Family Research Council.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Alaska Court Rules Roadside Marijuana Search
To Be Illegal</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>September 27, 1995, Anchorage, AK:</b>&nbsp;
In a ruling that could cast doubt upon the legality of many
roadside searches, Alaska District Court Judge William Fuld has
dismissed charges against a man who was arrested after a state
trooper reportedly smelled marijuana and then demanded that the
defendant &quot;hand it over.&quot;&nbsp; In the court's view,
the officer's phrase: &quot;hand it over&quot; was not a choice,
but a demand to search the defendant's vehicle.&nbsp; Therefore,
the court ruled that the roadside search was improper because no
valid consent was ever given by the defendant. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;The trooper was in uniform and the defendant testified that
he felt he had to respond to the officer's command,&quot;
summarized Fuld in his court opinion.&nbsp; &quot;The demand to
'hand it over' admitted to by the trooper was an illegal search
of the defendant.&nbsp; While the trooper smelled marijuana, he had
no right to search the passenger.&nbsp; ... <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">... The state argues that there was a valid consent to a
search.&nbsp; I don't think so.&nbsp; No choice was offered [to
the defendant.]&quot; <br>

<p align="center"><b>Sentencing Project Report Reveals That
Nearly One In Three Black Males<br>
Are Under Criminal Justice Supervision</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>October 4, 1995, Washington, DC:</b>&nbsp;
Nearly one in three African American males in their twenties is
either in prison, jail, on probation, or on parole, according to
report issued this month by the Washington DC-based Sentencing
Project.&nbsp; This figure is a significant increase over the approximately
25 percent of five years ago.&nbsp; The report, entitled Young
Black Americans and the Criminal Justice System: Five Years
Later, cites the federal &quot;war on drugs&quot; as the largest contributing
factor to the disproportionate number of young black males
currently under criminal justice supervision. <br>

Project's latest report, please contact Mark Mauer of the
