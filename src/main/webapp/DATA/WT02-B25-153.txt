THE HARVARD PSYCHIATRY BRAIN COLLECTION
<p>
        The Harvard Psychiatry Brain Collection has been specifically
trying to collect brain tissue from families with serious mental illness.
There has been a special focus on the membership of the National Alliance
for the Mentally Ill (NAMI), the organization for families with brain
disorders.  Our "Brain Bank" functions as a repository for brain tissue
that is used for scientific investigations of the underlying causes of
neuropsychiatric brain disorders.  Toward this end,  we distribute donated
tissue to qualified investigators throughout the country.
 <p>       For research purposes, it is important that we collect tissue from:
A. Individuals with a psychiatric diagnosis (schizophrenia,
manic-depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder);  B.  First degree
relatives (parents, siblings, offspring) of individuals with a psychiatric
diagnosis; and C. "Normal Control" individuals who have no family history
of mental illness.
  <p>      The Harvard "Brain Bank", which is centered at McLean Hospital, is
federally funded to undertake the processing and distribution of donated
brain specimens.  Unfortunately, the government does not provide sufficient
funding to cover the costs associated with brain removal which, may in some
cases be as much as $200-300.  In the past, these costs have generally been
assumed by the family members interested in brain donation.  However,
because of the severe shortage of brain tissue donated by individuals with
a serious psychiatric illness, we have established a special fund in order
to cover the costs of brain removal for individuals with a psychiatric
diagnosis (category A above).  In addition, as long as there is adequate
funding available, we will also cover such costs for the donation of brains
from first degree relatives (parents, sibling, offspring) of individuals
with schizophrenia, manic-depression or obsessive-compulsive disorder
(category B above).  The spouse of an individual with a serious mental
illness, who has no other blood relatives with a serious mental illness,
can donate brain tissue in the category of "Normal Control" (category C
above), and as long as there is adequate funding available, we will agree
to cover the associated costs of donation.
  <p>      Pre-registration for brain donation is encouraged, but not
necessary.  When an individual dies, the surviving family members make the
decision to donate.  We do, however, encourage families to openly plan for
brain donation and to pre-register with the Brain Bank.
   <p>     Brain donation is a personal decision that is made by the surviving
family at the time of death.  In the event of a death, or an impending
death, just dial     1-800-BRAIN BANK any time of the day or night and our
staff will assist you in the donation process.
    <p>    For more information about brain donation, please call 1-800-BRAIN
BANK (1-800-272-4622) and request our "Brain Donation Information"
brochures for your Local Affiliate meeting or a copy of our free video
interview with Dr. Jill Bolte Taylor titled "LifeSpan: Research Takes
Brains".

<P>
"By the 1960s, a horrified backlash--and the advent of new antipsychotic drugs--ended the lobotomy (practice).  But a handful of doctors quietly continued to look for more limited and precise ways to treat mental illness through brain surgery," according to an article in the Wall Street Journal (December 1, 1994). 
<P>
"They focused on a mysterious ring of brain structured call the limbic system, which seems to play a role in emotions such as fear, sadness and pleasure.  At Boston's Massachusetts General Hospital in 1962, H. Thomas Ballantine began trying a pinpoint procedure called a cingulotomy...(and) it appeared to break the cycle of mental illness--without the high mortality and brain damage of lobotomies.  To this day, surgeons are at a loss to explain why cingulotomies work. 
<P>
Because it takes weeks after surgery for patients to respond, Dr. Ballantine suspects the procedure doesn't simply interrupt a brain circuit, but somehow changes the levels of unspecified brain chemicals.  Today, Mass General performs 15 to 20 cingulotomies each year, making it one of the world's only hospitals with a regular psychosurgery practice. 
<P>
Fearful of the lobotomy era's taint, the psychosurgery team takes pains to screen out all but the most desperate cases and deeps an extremely low profile--even though at least a quarter of its patients report improvement in their conditions."

<P>
Nearly five years ago, at the urging of Congress and based on a report by the Institute of Medicine (IOM), NIMH issued the "National Plan for Research on Child and Adolescent Mental Disorders."  Now several IOM members who wrote the original IOM report have prepared the "Report Card on the National Plan for Research on Child and Adolescent Mental Disorders:  The Midway Point." 
<P>
The report card compares the original goals of the National Plan with the achievements thus far described under the following headings:  career development, basic research, clinical research, intramural research, services research, dissemination and advocacy, and leadership.  There has been considerable progress in funding services research and prevention with more progress in clinical research than in basic research.  
<P>
Only modest progress has been made in training new researchers.  Especially troublesome is the lack of progress in funding intramural research and in disseminating information about what has been learned through research.  To obtain a copy of the report card, call the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry at 202/966-7300, or write the Academy at 3615 Wisconsin Ave., NW, Washington, DC 20016-3007.

<A NAME = "depre"><H2>DEPRESSION AND THE ELDERLY</H2></A><A HREF = "#top">[Return to Top]</A><br>
<P>
Oregon psychiatrists fear that severe depression can lead some elderly patients to make deadly, inappropriate decisions about continuation of medical treatment, according to a survey by researchers at the Portland Veterans Administration Medical Center reported in the November 1994 American Journal of Psychiatry. 
<P>
More than 75 percent of Americans favor legislation allowing terminally ill patients or their family members to withdraw life-sustaining treatments, but the researchers argue that severe depression may influence patients to reject medical care they might otherwise accept if their depression were treated.  "Hopelessness leads to undervaluing all possible good outcomes for a medical treatment," said Linda Ganzini, M.D., and colleagues.  "
<P>
This study supports the hypothesis that in many depressed persons, hopelessness, pessimism and excessive emphasis on the burdens of treatment temporarily alter the person's personal formula for weighing risks and benefits of medical treatment."   Ganzini's findings offer hope that psychiatrists and other physicians can predict which depressed patients are likely to have stable or unstable preferences regarding life-sustaining therapies.

<P>
Does Clozepine Alleviate Facial Tics, Body Tremors?
<P>
by Allan Safferman, M.D. and Jeffrey Lieberman, M.D.
<P>
Safferman is research psychiatrist at Hillside Hospital, Long
Island Jewish Medical Center, in Glen Oaks, NY. Lieberman is
director of research in the Department of Psychiatry at Hillside
Hospital.
<P>
One of the major concerns associated with the chronic use of
neuroleptic drugs is the development of tardive dyskinesia (TD),
an abnormal, involuntary movement disorder that can affect the
facial region, the trunk, and the upper and lower extremities.
<P>
The incidence of TD varies in different populations: in non-
elderly adult psychiatric patients it occurs in 18.5 percent
after four years of neuroleptic drug treatment, and in 44 percent
after eight years of treatment.
<P>
Among the elderly, the risk of TD has been found to be over 30
percent after 43 weeks of neuroleptic drug treatment.
<P>
Abnormal movements may be caused by a variety of neurological
illnesses, and the clinician should carefully consider and
exclude other reasonable possibilities before making a diagnosis
of TD. 
<P>
The majority of TD cases are mild, and if caught in time, are
reversible.
<P>
But a small percentage of patients may actually pose a medical
risk to the patient. The movements are often cosmetically
disfiguring and may be functionally disabling.
<P>
Patients with TD may be embarrassed by these movements and their
presence may cause anxiety and alarm to patients. These patients
may be shunned by those who are ignorant about this neurological
problem, thereby hampering the patient's efforts to reintegrate
into the community.
<P>
If anti-psychotic medications are discontinued early at the onset
of TD, a significant number of patients will spontaneously
improve and perhaps even remit after a few months.
<P>
Unfortunately, for many patients, neuroleptic discontinuation is
not a viable option as the relapse rate for patients suffering
from schizophrenia exceeds 60 percent and 80 percent after one
and two years of medication respectively.
<P>
Various efforts to treat TD have been met with inconsistent
results. Some of these measures have included: benzodiazepines,
lithium, bromocriptine, tetrabenazine, reserpine, lecithin,
clonidin, and high does anticholinergics, to name a few.
<P>
Some recent intriguing approaches have included the use of
Vitamin E, and selegiline.
<P>
It appears that all medications that block D-2 dopamine receptors
in the brain have the potential of producing extrapyramidal
symptoms (eg, tremor, rigidity) and may cause TD.
<P>
Clozapine is very interesting in this regard. Clozapine has a
very weak affinity for D-2 dopamine receptors, and therefore,
rarely produces significant extrapyramidal symptoms at
therapeutic doses.
<P>
While there have been a few isolated cases of dyskinesias
associated with clozapine, in these instances patients had
received traditional neuroleptic drugs prior to clozapine. To
date, there have been no confirmed case of TD caused by clozapine
alone.
<P>
For this reason, clozapine is a very appealing drug in that it
can effectively control psychotic symptoms and yet has a very low
risks, if any at all, of producing TD.
<P>
It has been observed that moderate to high dozes of clozapine
(between 500 MG to 900 mg per day) may partially or completely
alleviate symptoms of TD -- especially in those patients with
tardive dystonia.
<P>
At Hillside Hospital in New York, we are currently conducting a
study to determine if clozapine is an effective treatment for
patients with moderate to sever tardive dyskinesia.
<P>
Preliminary results indicate that most of the TD patients show
dramatic improvement in their abnormal body movements.
<P>
This project is currently ongoing and we are seeking more
patients for this study to help us determine if clozapine merely
suppresses TD, treats TD, or spares the brain from intense D-2
dopamine receptor blockage thereby allowing spontanwous "healing"
of dopamine neurons in the brain.
