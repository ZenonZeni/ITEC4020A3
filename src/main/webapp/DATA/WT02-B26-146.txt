With only a fraction of the advertising budget of its laundry detergent
competitors, ARM &amp; HAMMER&reg; brand laundry detergent achieved the
number two market position behind Tide for several periods during 1993.
It did so by leveraging its brand equity and no-phosphates formula in a
public relations and sales promotion program of environmental multi-stakeholder
alliances and third-party endorsements. The partnership included the National
Audubon Society, The Disney Channel, Senator Gaylord Nelson, Kenny Loggins,
Earth Day USA, Scholastic Magazine, the US EPA Office of Environmental Education,
49,000 school teachers and 10,000 retailers. Coddington Environmental was
engaged to help identify and secure the partners and serve as project manager.<BR>

Coddington Environmental helps companies evaluate governmental, environmental
and other organizational agencies and groups for educational, technical
development and marketing partnerships. Partnership programs are designed
to advance company environmental policies, positions and products, while
helping other organizations advance their agendas.
