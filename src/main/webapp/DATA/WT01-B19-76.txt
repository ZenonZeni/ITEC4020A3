<p align="center"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica">For
years marijuana has been taboo, denounced as a street evil.<br>
But chronically ill patients are rediscovering cannabis,<br>
and looking to the Legislature for help.<br>
</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><strong>By Jeff Inman</strong></font> </p>

<p><font size="4"><spacer type="horizontal" size="50">Allen Helmers is fighting for his life.&nbsp;
He's scheduled to go to court on Nov. 20 for violating his
parole.&nbsp; Cops found nearly a half-pound of marijuana in his one-room
apartment in Waterloo.&nbsp; He's been convicted of possession
once before. <br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="50">&quot;If I go to prison, I just hope to God I find the strength
to survive,&quot; Helmers says. <br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="50">Helmers isn't out to get high.&nbsp; He needs it to live.&nbsp;
The victim of a drunk driving accident, Helmers broke his back in
six places.&nbsp; In order to make him mobile, his vertebrae were
fused.&nbsp; The accident also acted as a catalyst.&nbsp; He has fiber
malisia, a disease that slowly eats the soft tissue of the
body.&nbsp; With his immune system lowered, the disease kicked
into overdrive and hasn't quit since.&nbsp; He is in chronic
pain. <br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="50">Doctors pumped him full of pills, hoping to find the right
combination of chemicals to make it go away.&nbsp; It didn't
work.&nbsp; Helmers jokes that he has &quot;a five gallon bucket
of empty prescriptions&quot; that did more damage than
good.&nbsp; Then someone suggested marijuana. <br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="50">&quot;I've tried almost every kind of pill out there,&quot; the
fortyish Helmers says.&nbsp; &quot;I just left the hospital
yesterday with a bleeding stomach because of the side effects.&nbsp;
But the courts seem to think there's some sort of magic pill out
there that will cure everything.&nbsp; The pills just make me
sicker.&nbsp; Marijuana is the only thing that works.&quot;<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="50">For years marijuana has been a taboo drug in the eyes of the
law.&nbsp; Since it was outlawed by the Marijuana Tax Act in
1937, cannabis has been denounced as everything from &quot;wacky
tabacky&quot; to one of the most evil drugs on the street --
rarely as a remedy for what ails you. <br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="50">In recent years, however, the medical world has been
rediscovering marijuana, studying the plant for medicinal
applications.&nbsp; Once prescribed as a quick fix for a migraine
or as a muscle relaxant, marijuana is now being used to ease the
pain of AIDS and cancer patients.&nbsp; Lester Grinspoon, a
professor at Harvard Medical School, has been studying the plant
since 1967.&nbsp; He says marijuana helps with everything from
rare diseases to PMS, and has the potential to aid thousands of
people. <br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="50">&quot;Marijuana is a remarkably safe, non-toxic medicine, that,
if it becomes available, will be inexpensive and unbelievably
versatile,&quot; Grinspoon says.&nbsp; There are over 45 symptoms
it works for, everything from nausea to muscle spasms.&quot; <br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="50">Yet marijuana won't be sold over the counter any time soon.&nbsp;
It's the forbidden cure.&nbsp; Few are allowed access.&nbsp;
Listed as a Schedule I drug by the Controlled Substances Act,
it's considered highly dangerous, inviting abuse, with little or
no medical value.&nbsp; Patients must prove they have a medical necessity
to use the drug, which often translates into drawn out court
battles. <br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="50">Only eight people in the United States receive marijuana
legally.&nbsp; George McMahon is one of them.&nbsp; He has
Nailpattla Syndrome, which causes everything from pain and spasms
to nausea.&nbsp; Doctors said he'd be dead by now.&nbsp; Once
they gave him six hours to live.&nbsp; He climbed into his car,
lit up a joint and had his wife drive him home.&nbsp; Now holed
up at his house in Bode, Iowa, McMahon gets a half pound of
marijuana from the government every month, smoking up to 10
joints a day. <br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="50">&quot;It doesn't work the same way when you have to use it,&quot;
McMahon says.&nbsp; &quot;When you smoke a joint in anticipation
of getting high, you do.&nbsp; I don't get the euphoric
part.&nbsp; I get to forget about my pain.&nbsp; All these
generals and cops keep coming out and saying that there's no
evidence that this works, but then why am I in this
program.&nbsp; I'm evidence.&nbsp; There's people out there like
me who need this.&quot; <br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="50">Patients may now have a chance to get marijuana legally.&nbsp;
California and Arizona recently passed initiatives allowing
doctors to prescribe marijuana to those who need it.&nbsp; Rather
than denying patients the drug and forcing them to buy it
illegally off the street, both Arizona's Proposition 200 and
California's Proposition 215 put control of the drug in the hands
of the government, regulating potency and dosage. <br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="50">But that's only two states.&nbsp; McMahon wants to see cannabis
legalized across the board, especially at home.&nbsp; Since Iowa
doesn't have propositions on the ballot, he has to work for
legislative reform.&nbsp; He, along with co-founder Carl Olsen,
started Iowan's for Medical Marijuana.&nbsp; Their intent: push
the legislature into action, with Helmers as the point man.&nbsp;
It won't be easy.&nbsp; Legislators are weary of legalizing
something that carries so much political baggage. <br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="50">&quot;I'm not convinced this is something the medical community
wants,&quot; says Rep. Jeff Lamberti (R-Ankeny).&nbsp; &quot;I
don't see them saying this is something they need, and some are
saying it does more harm than good.&quot; <br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="50">Rep. Robert Brunkhorst (R-Waverly) agrees: &quot;I don't favor
it.&nbsp; I think there are alternative drugs out there that are
better suited than marijuana.&quot; <br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="50">But some legislators are more sympathetic.&nbsp; Republican Sen.
Gene Maddox of Clive, while by no means endorsing marijuana use,
hasn't closed the door. <br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="50">&quot;I'd be open to it on a restricted basis.&nbsp; But I have a
lot of questions that need answered before I can make up my
mind.&quot; <br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="50">For now Helmers is caught in the crossfire.&nbsp; Until the
debate is over or he proves he has a medical necessity, he'll
continue to smoke illegally.&nbsp; It's the only way the pain
will go away. <br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="50">&quot;Every day I decide whether I should kill myself or not,
whether the pain is too much,&quot; Helmers says.&nbsp;
&quot;It's bad enough being ill without having to deal with an
uncompassionate government trying to throw you in jail for
relieving the pain.&nbsp; People shouldn't have to hide or feel
they are a criminal in order to feel better.&quot; </font></p>

<font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica"><strong>&quot;It's a
question of whether or not we want to throw<br>
people in jail for something they think relieves their pain.<br>
They've tried everything else.&nbsp; Marijuana is all that's
left.&quot; </strong></font><br>
