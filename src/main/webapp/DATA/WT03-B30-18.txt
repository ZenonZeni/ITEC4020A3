ARMY COMPLETES BRIDGE ACROSS SAVA RIVER

     The U.S. Army completed construction of a bridge across the
Sava River in Bosnia Sunday, opening the gateway for armored forces
to occupy northeastern Bosnia.
     Bad weather and flooding during the past week had bedeviled
Army engineers, who had initially planned to complete the bridge by
Christmas Day. The setbacks in crossing the river were frustrating
Army commanders, and leading to suggestions of a U.S. deployment
into Bosnia that was less than the swift show of force promised by
the Pentagon.
     By Sunday night, 148 vehicles and more than 500 soldiers had
crossed the river, including 12 70-ton Abrams tanks -- the first on
Bosnian soil -- and 41 Bradley Fighting Vehicles of the 1st
Squadron of the 1st Cavalry Regiment. The armored vehicles,
escorted by helicopters, rolled south into the strategic Posavina
corridor connecting the two large Serb-held portions of Bosnia.
     The Sava bridge is the link between U.S. supply bases in
Germany and the American headquarters of NATO in the northern
Bosnian town of Tuzla. Although some 1,500 soldiers and thousands
of tons of equipment had been flown into Tuzla, spanning the Sava
was key to bringing most of the 400 armored vehicles needed to
patrol the sector and to separate the warring factions.
     According to yesterday's edition of The Washington Post,
engineers will start work next week on a second bridge to permit
two-way traffic across the Sava.
     "This is one step. We have many more to go," said Brig. Gen.
James P. O'Neal, the assistant division commander. "Now comes the
real hard work in setting in motion the two bridges and keeping the
whole flow moving. This is the showcase, but it's just the front
end."

DEFENSE SECRETARY TO VISIT UKRAINE FOR DISARMAMENT DEMONSTRATION

     Defense Secretary William Perry will visit American troops in
Italy and Hungary today at the start of a week-long trip that will
take him to Bosnia, Ukraine and the Middle East.
     On Friday, he joins defense ministers Valery Shmarov of
Ukraine and Pavel Grachev of Russia in blowing up an SS-19
intercontinental missile silo at the former Soviet missile base at
Pervomaisk, Ukraine.
       The three will also hold talks which could include the rift
between Ukraine and Russia over control of the former Soviet Black
Sea fleet.
     It will be Perry's third trip to Pervomaisk, reports Reuters.
Since becoming secretary in 1994, he has made repeated visits to
Ukraine and other former Soviet nuclear states to encourage their
march toward non-nuclear status.
     "This visit is a truly historic occasion," a senior U.S.
defense official told reporters of the Ukraine meeting with Shmarov
and Grachev. He noted that both Russia and Ukraine--former Cold War
foes of NATO - were Bosnia peacekeepers and that the U.S. was
providing funds to help dismantle the missile base.
     The official estimated that 70 percent of the strategic
nuclear warheads in Ukraine have now been transferred to Russia and
that over two-thirds of the ICBM's in Ukraine have been removed
from their silos.
     The tripartite silo destruction is being funded by Nunn-Lugar
Threat Reduction Program funds, of which Ukraine has received
almost $350 million.

ADMIRAL ARLEIGH BURKE DIES

     Retired Adm. Arleigh Burke, former chief of naval operations
and military leader, died yesterday at age 94.
     Renowned for the speed of his Pacific destroyer squadron,
Burke served an unprecedented three terms as chief of naval
operations in a military career that spanned the ages of cavalry
horse and atomic bomb.
     The Associated Press notes that with the commissioning of the
USS Arleigh Burke in 1991, he became one of the few men to have a
Navy ship - and at the same time the Navy's most modern destroyer
class - named after him while still living.
     As President Eisenhower's naval operations chief Burke pushed
for new anti-submarine technology, development of Polaris missiles,
and building up allied navies, including Japan's.

PRESIDENT VETOES DEFENSE BILL, OBJECTS TO ABM LANGUAGE

     President Clinton vetoed a $265 billion defense bill last
Thursday, saying it would waste money on an unneeded missile
defense system.
     In his veto message, Clinton said he particularly objected to
an attempt in the bill by congressional Republicans to compel him
to build and deploy a national system of defenses against ballistic
missile attack by 2003.
     Clinton said building such a system now would violate the 1972
Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty with Russia and harm arms control
efforts. The bill would have authorized $820 million in 1996 for
the national missile defense program, $450 million more than the
administration requested.
     At $265 billion, the measure is only slightly larger than last
year's defense bill. It is, however, $7 billion more than Clinton
requested.  Defense Secretary William Perry recommended the veto,
primarily because of what he considers the wrongheaded missile
defense provision.
     From the outset, Clinton opposed policy language in the bill
requiring the military to build a system designed to defend U.S.
territory against potential attack from missiles. He said it would
jeopardize continued Russian implementation of the START I nuclear
disarmament accord as well as Russian ratification of START II,
which has not been ratified by the U.S. Congress either.
     In announcing the veto, Clinton also issued an executive order
raising military pay by 2 percent.  The Associated Press reports he
also asked Congress to quickly pass legislation bringing the total
pay raise to 2.4 percent, the amount contained in the vetoed bill.

REJECTION OF COMMERCE SPENDING BILL PRESERVES SOME HOPE FOR ATP

     President Clinton emphatically vetoed a fiscal year 1996
funding bill [H.R. 2076] for the Commerce, State and Justice
Departments December 19, cheering supporters of the Commerce
Department programs like NIST's Advanced Technology Program (ATP)
which had been singled out for elimination by Republicans on
Capitol Hill.
     "The bill constitutes a short-sighted assault on the Commerce
Department's technology programs that work effectively with
business to expand our economy, help Americans compete in the
global marketplace, and create high-quality jobs," Clinton scolded
the House.  He added that he could not accept sharp cuts to
programs such as the NIST-administered Manufacturing Extension
Partnership.
     The veto of H.R. 2076 means Congress will have to reexamine
its plans to cut DOC's budget by some $600 million during the
fiscal year 1995.  It is unclear whether ATP will be restored as
part of the process, and if so, at what level.
     Because Republicans are using the government shutdown to
pressure the White House to accede to their budget-cutting plans,
it is unclear when NIST will receive additional funds.  If it does
continue to receive funds under another continuing resolution,
those would be at the more generous fiscal 1995 level, which
provides $340 million annually for ATP.  Yet three months after the
government's current fiscal year began October 1, today's edition
of Technology Transfer Week notes that NIST, like much of the rest
of the federal government, lack spending authority and remains
closed.

RUSSIA MISSES CFE TREATY DEADLINE

     Russia confirmed yesterday that it had failed to comply with a
New Year's deadline for destroying thousands of tanks and other
military hardware beyond the Ural Mountains as part of the 1990
Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty.
     Gen. Dmitry Kharchenko told reporters Moscow wanted to push
the December 31, 1995 deadline back to the end of 1998.
     The delay was purely economic, said Gen. Kharchenko, who is
the army staff officer responsible for international military
cooperation.  "About 100 billion rubles ($20 million) in today's
money is needed to destroy the weapons transported beyond the
Urals," he said.
     Today's edition of The Washington Times reports Kharchenko
indicated that three other former Soviet republics also failed to
meet the CFE treaty commitment.

NAVY METAL-SPRAY PROCESS MAKES LARGE PARTS ON DEMAND

     The Navy Surface Warfare Center - Carderock Division (NSWC)
has developed a spray-forming process at its Annapolis, Md. lab
that may revolutionize metal-casting and forging and make possible
on-demand production of metal parts to near-net-shape tolerances
from computer design files.
     Originating at Britain's Osprey Metals Ltd., the process has
been improved by NSWC and given an international pedigree,
including a Swedish plant funded by the Defense Department and an
Ohio plant built by a German/Swedish team.
     NSWC originally sought the British process to make nickel
super alloy tubing for new submarines like the Seawolf.  But with
the Navy's traditional suppliers of large metal components
endangered by defense cuts, NSWC realized that the process could be
used rapidly to produce metal components on demand.
     NSWC's spray-forming work, funded by an "exploratory
development" core program, has cut pipe production costs 25 percent
and boosted product yields up to 25 percent.  Material properties
exceed those for casting processes and match those for much
costlier forging and powder-metallurgy products.  Today's edition
of Technology Transfer Week reports NSWC's work is funded by the
Pentagon's "foreign comparative test" program and that the center
is studying spray-formed large-diameter Inconel (iron-cobalt-
nickel) piping for use in the Navy's new Seawolf submarine.

TIME IS MONEY IN NAVY'S GBS EFFORT

     Navy officials are anxious to get permission to give Hughes
the go-ahead to upgrade three military satellites to broadcast
voice, data, and video communications and warn that the longer it
takes to get the effort underway the more expensive it will become.
     Hughes is currently under contract to build 10 Ultra High
Frequency Follow-On military communications satellites, but the
service recently decided to modify the last three so they have
direct broadcast satellite capability.
     Work on these three satellites - which are known as F8, F9,
and F10 - must be accomplished before February 1998 or the service
will be forced to renegotiate its contract with Lockheed Martin, at
an untold cost.  Lockheed Martin is currently under contract to
launch the satellites on its Atlas Centaur launch vehicle.
     "We have a window of opportunity to catch the three
satellites," Capt. Jim Loiselle, program manager for Navy
communications satellites said in a December 8 interview.
     The decision to pursue a GBS capability was prompted by a
warfighting need to have high bandwidth video and data
communications capability, but also by the desire of sailors to
have access to television broadcasts and other ties to the
mainland, according to Navy officials.
     Much of the Navy's GBS system will be based on Hughes'
commercially available DirecTV system, which has teleconferencing
and world-wide television broadcast capabilities.  The Navy system,
reports the most recent edition of C4I News, will be encrypted so
that sensitive information can be protected from potential
adversaries.
