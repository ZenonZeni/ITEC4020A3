The End of the "Flying Peace"

from CHINA FOCUS, Volume 4, Number 11, November 1, 1996

by Zhang Shuangwu

Recently, a lovely project at the Guangxi Nanning Zoo vanished like
a soap bubble.  In October 1995, in order to create a "new scenic
spot," the zoo invested 15,000 RMB to introduce 850 chick doves
into the zoo from other places.  After two months of meticulous
nurturing and taming, the full-grown white doves were released into
the zoo's green trees and tender lawns to sport freely with the
visitors.  The white doves, green lawn, and blue sky became a major
attraction at the Nanning Zoo.

However, during the time they were allowed to fly free every day,
quite a number of the doves were injured when they were chased by
the visitors.  The worst was that some visitors even stole the
white doves when the zoo keepers were not around.  Once, over one
hundred white doves were stolen in a single day!

The deputy director of the zoo, Zhang Caichang, was forced to
remark: "In fact, one white dove is not worth that much, at the
most 10 RMB.  I assume that the visitors who stole the doves were
not going to sell them for money, but rather to make a side dish
for their drinks."  The public security police of the zoo noticed
that in early July this situation had become worse.  The reason was
that during the summer vacation, the number of children visiting
the zoo had increased; with their parents' tacit permission as well
as connivance, some young visitors repeatedly broke the rules.

According to the count, among the 850 white doves which were first
introduced into the Nanning Zoo, besides the 200 that suffered from
natural deaths, another 500 doves were stolen by visitors.
Starting from August 20, the zoo decided to lock the 130 surviving
doves into a specially built and well-sealed wooden house.  The
project of releasing the "Flying Peace" thus came to a premature
end.

In the Nanning Zoo, the white doves are not the only animals to
have suffered such misfortunes. Sea lions, tigers, and red-crowned
cranes are sometimes injured or blinded by visitors.  The medical
bill of the zoo to protect these animals is increasing every year.

The Water Shortage in Xi'an

from CHINA FOCUS, Volume 4, Number 11, November 1, 1996

by Bai Lin & Gao Xiaoyan

Right after the Spring Festival this year, residents in some areas
of Xi'an city began the torment of waiting for the water to be
turned on.  As soon as they received a notice that their water was
being turned on they bustled around to fill containers of all sizes
that they could find in their homes.  They finally became used to
using water this way.  On one occasion, in the summer of last year,
water was the most rare life-sustaining source for people in Xi'an.
Water storage jugs, which cost 35 RMB, were one of the hottest
consumer goods.  Water traffickers also took advantage of the
situation to profiteer.  Even the officials who never had a need to
worry about food would not forget to carry two water buckets in the
trunks of their cars.

Water is threatening the survival of this ancient city.  The
excessive extraction of underground water has already produced
serious consequences: across the city, a total length of 55
kilometers, 13 ground fissures from east to west have destroyed
several thousand houses; the famous cultural relic, the Big Goose
Pagoda, now tilts soberly; and the deterioration of the earth's
surface at the Clock Tower and at three other historic sites has
been exacerbated.

The daily extractable ground water in Xi'an city is 120,000 to
140,000 tons at the most, but this only meets one-third of the
required demand of the city.  So by the time 260,000 tons are
extracted daily, the water level has dropped dramatically.  The
water level is now dropping between two and three meters annually
in the metropolitan area and between three and five meters in the
southern suburbs.  This overextraction has produced a series of
other problems.  First, as the water quality deteriorates, the
shallow water can no longer be used for human consumption because
of the discharge of industrial waste and because of the excessive
use of agricultural pesticides and chemical fertilizers.  Second,
the earth has begun to subside seriously.  From 1986 to 1991, the
earth in the metropolitan area subsided from 30 millimeters to 210
millimeters, and the annual rate increased from 10 millimeters to
70 millimeters.

The drop in the level of the ground water and the deterioration of
the water quality greatly raised the costs of water extraction and
purification for the city water company.  Currently The cost for
water purification has reached 0.47 RMB per cubic meter, while the
water company can only charge city residents 0.45 RMB per cubic
meter of water.  Whereas the 2.3 hundred million cubic meters of
the the total annual natural water supply cannot be changed, the
water supply enterprises are pinched to their limit.

Xi'an was called "Chang'an" in ancient times.  Our forefathers
often described the beauty of this ancient city as "Eight Rivers
Surrounding Chang'an."  But today, of the eight rivers which used
to encircle Xi'an, some have long ago been cut off, and some can
only barely be called "rivers" during the rainy seasons.  Today,
only the Feng River is still flowing year round, but because the
weather has been continuously dry, the water source of the Feng
River has also dropped two meters.  In addition, Chang'an county,
through which the Feng River flows, has built a simply-constructed
dam at the river's upper stream for its own benefit.  This five
million RMB dam pushed the Xi'an water company, which had invested
several dozen million RMB, into a tight corner; even with forty
deep wells, the quantity of water this company could produce
dropped sharply.

In general, when the water supply is insufficient, it is natural to
ration it.  But the Water-Ration Office is plagued by numerous
difficulties.  The same people who sometimes do not have enough
drinking water still do not have a conscience about saving water.
The Water-Ration Office manages 300 work units with self-contained
wells, and supplies 1400 planned water customers each with over 20
cubic meters for daily usage.  Every year, the office readjusts the
water usage quota, and water meters are checked monthly.  The
charge for overquota water is two to six times the normal price.
The Water-Ration Office also sets a quota for water usage for water
for daily living; residents who get water from outdoors receive a
daily quota of 50 liters per person; those have indoor hygiene
facilities receive 120 liters per person; people have bath or
shower facilities get 150 liters per person; students boarding at
colleges get 220 liters (including for the use of labs); grade
school and high school students get 80 liters (also including that
for lab use).  However, because of the lack of funds and the lack
of water supply engineering and due to the unfinished
reconstruction of the old urban pipeline, there is still a gap in
terms of managing water usage in residential areas.  Furthermore,
ground water management within the city is chaotic, as some
departments arbitrarily give permission to dig wells.

With the number of water consumers increasing constantly, the water
supply in Xi'an is becoming more and more short every year.  When
summer comes, it is almost as if eyebrows are about to catch fire.
The peak water supply has become a serious social problem.  In
1991, when there were forty days of summer drought, the daily
difference between the need and the supply of water exceeded 0.4
million cubic meters.  This directly affected the everyday life of
500,000 people living on 20 square kilometers;  202 enterprises
were also affected, and it was estimated that they incurred 42.5
hundred million RMB in losses in industrial output that year.

On July 15, 1991, the city government issued five emergency
policies to deal with the shortage of the water supply: limit daily
use per person to 100 liters; put an end to waste due to running
water, leakage, dripping, and overflowing; ban garden watering and
cooling off with tap water; close down all the city swimming pools
which use tap-water; reduce by 20 percent the supply to customers
using large quantities of water.  By 1995, the condition had
worsened, and Xi'an was inescapably caught in a water crisis.

The daily demand for water in Xi'an is 1.2 to 1.25 million cubic
meters, but now only 0.75 million cubic meters of water can be
supplied.  This shortage of water is 43 percent of the water
supplied.  Now, people are placing their hopes on the Black River
that originates in the Qin mountains.  But until the water from the
Black River can get to Xi'an, there is no way to solve the water
shortage problem.  The total investment in the Black River
diversion work requires 2900 million RMB; although 1000 million RMB
has already been spent, the work has not been finished.

In fact. there are many other cities with water shortages more
serious than Xi'an.  Taiyuan is one such city, but without any
practical scenario to solve the problem, some people have
tentatively suggested relocating the city.  The capital of Beijing
is also short of water, as the average water supply per capita in
Beijing is only 1/30 of the world's average. By the year 2010, the
gap between supply and demand will be over 1000 million cubic
meters.

Leaking Housing Projects

from CHINA FOCUS, Volume 4, Number 11, November 1, 1996

Many new housing projects have been built as China's economy has
developed.  But the quality of the houses has become lower and
lower.  According to a survey conducted by the "China Technical and
Development Center of the Building Industry," in the twenty-two
cities surveyed, including Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, etc., 53
percent of the houses leaked in the very first year after
completion.  According to the official Xinhua News Agency, in the
1950s, leaking began after an average of sixteen years after
completion; in the 1960s, leaking occured after seven to nine
years; in the 1970s, after three to five years.

Due to the poor quality of the housing projects, a great amount of
money has been spent on repairs.  In the survey of the twenty-two
cities, it was estimated that the money spent on repairs in one
year exceeded the original budget by 1.2 billion RMB.

New Party Members

from CHINA FOCUS, Volume 4, Number 11, November 1, 1996

Recently, to the elation of Party officials, there has been a new
upsurge in the number of students applying to join the Communist
Party.  But, on closer scrutiny, it was found that the motives
behind the applications were of a dubious nature.

According to a survey, 30 percent of those answering the question
regarding their motives for joining the Party answered that if one
is a Party member he/she is more likely to find a good job.  When
asked whether it is right to say that Party membership is an
important chip in the competition for good jobs after graduation,
70.1 percent answered that this was reasonable.  When they were
asked what they would do when their personal interests clashed with
the interests of the Party, 53.7 percent answered that they would
do their best to consider the interests of the Party, but their
personal interests would also have to be taken into consideration.

A Free Ride

from CHINA FOCUS, Volume 4, Number 11, November 1, 1996

Jin Hua, an old lady, recently died of cancer in Ji'nan Central
Hospital.  Fortunately, she was a veteran of the Anti-Japanese War
and all her medical bills could be paid by the state; the bill was
given to her daughter to be transferred to Jin Hua's work unit.

Because her daughter is a very methodical person, she checked the
bill over and found that there were many items on the bill that her
mother had not received.  For instance, her mother was allergic to
antibiotics, but she was charged for more than 200 penicillin
shots; her mother's gallbladder had been removed many years
earlier, but one of the drugs listed on the bill was to treat
gallstones.  During Jin Hua's stay in the hospital, she had four
electrocardiograms, but she was charged for eight; she had not had
any blood transfusions, but 640 RMB was charged for blood
transfusions.  Charges for even more expensive medicine to treat
obesity appeared on the bill.  Later it was found out that some of
the doctors and nurses had included on the bill some medicine which
they themselves needed.  They reasoned that since the bill was to
be paid by the state, then why not get a free ride?

A New Wave of Persecution Against Catholics

from CHINA FOCUS, Volume 4, Number 11, November 1, 1996

There are many Catholics in the Baoding region of Hebei province.
Donglu village is one of the most densely congregated areas.  In
the name of "helping to improve the economy," the authorities sent
in a work team of over one hundred cadres at the beginning of this
year and launched a new wave of persecution against the Catholics.
The villagers were forbidden from leaving the village without
permission from the authorities.  Priests were arrested and
worshipping was banned; Catholic students were suspended from
school unless they denounced their religion, nuns were forced to
participate in "pre-nuptial training courses" where "sexual
education" was conducted in a lewd manner. The 38th Field Army of
over 2,000 soldiers surrounded the village to intimidate the
villagers.

Such persecution has also occurred in Jiangxi, Zhejiang, Fujian,
and Shaanxi provinces, as well as in other parts of Hebei province.

Bitter Fruit of the One-Child Policy

from CHINA FOCUS, Volume 4, Number 11, November 1, 1996

Two incidents have become hot topics of conversation among
educators and parents in China.

The first incident concerns ten children from the city of Harbin
chosen to participate in a summer camp in Russia.  These ten were
chosen from over 100,000 Harbin children, and were supposed to be
"outstanding students," but they also turned out to be very finicky
and pampered.  Once when the children were playing volleyball, the
ball rolled into a swimming pool.  The Russian children immediately
jumped into the pool to retrieve it, but the Chinese children stood
there crying "What's to be done?"  When mountain climbing, the
Russian children rushed up the mountain shouting joyously, while
the Chinese children formed a line, climbed slowly and listlessly.
When the time came for the children to depart, the gifts the
Russian children gave to their Chinese friends were all hand-made,
while the gifts from the Chinese children were all store-bought,
conventional presents.

Another incident concerns the freshmen enrolling at Peking
University.  On the day of enrollment, the number of parents
accompanying their sons and daughters far exceeded the number of
students.  Some parents even planned to stay near the college for
two weeks after enrollment to teach their children how to wash
their own clothes and how to take care of themselves.  Nearly all
the students were only children and had led very sheltered and
pampered lives.

Many educators and parents are worried: what has the one-child
policy done to our next generation?

Spending 20,000 RMB to Win 4,800 RMB

from CHINA FOCUS, Volume 4, Number 11, November 1, 1996

An advertisement appeared in Wuhan announcing a guessing game
sweepstakes: telephone the number 9680-0001 and answer a question
about tourism; if the answer is correct, the caller will score a
point.  The person who accumulates the most points will receive the
first prize of 4,800 RMB. The second and third prizes were to be
1,800 RMB and 1,000 RMB respectively.

Finally the results of the sweepstakes were published: the first
prize winner had called 21,817 times, the second prize winner
14,614 times; all winners had called no less than 8,000 times.
People all knew that the minimum fee for calling an 968 number is 1
RMB, so why would anyone spend more than 20,000 RMB only to win
4,800 RMB?  Were they crazy?

No, their minds were perfectly sound.  The operator of the 968 line
explained that nearly all these calls were made using office
telephones.  The winners not only did not have to pay the phone
bills, but also they had not used their own time to participate in
the game.

Fake Medicine from the Red Cross

from CHINA FOCUS, Volume 4, Number 11, November 1, 1996

A "panacea" to cure cancer which was sold by the Red Cross of
Hainan Island turned out to be fake medicine which had endangered
the lives of many patients.

This "panacea" is actually powder of glossy ganoderma spore, which
does not possess such curative effects as advertised by the Hainan
Red Cross.  As early as December 1994, the Ministry of Public
Health had announced that this powder could not cure cancer, that
it should be prohibited from being sold as cancer medication, and
that those who did so should be fined.  But, as the old Chinese
saying goes, "The heaven is high above and the emperor is far
away"; Hainan Island, which is the farthest province from Beijing,
thought it did not have to obey orders from Beijing.  This
"panacea" continued to be sold in the compound of the provincial
public health department for 260 RMB per gram (the actual cost was
roughly 300 RMB per kilogram).  It was not until April 1996, when
victims of this fake medicine began to sue, that this fraud finally
came to a halt.

Letter From China: Adventure in a Small Township

from CHINA FOCUS, Volume 4, Number 11, November 1, 1996

Dear Brother:

I always remember the letter you wrote to me about your first visit
to 42nd Street in New York.  Now let me tell you something I
experienced in a small border town several days ago.

I went to Dongxing township at the border of Guangxi Autonomous
Region together with my boss and another colleague.  Having heard
that the public security there is not good, we decided that we
would stay in the same room just to be on the safe side.  But as
soon as we settled down and turned on the TV for the 7:OO PM news,
there was a knock on the door and in came a young girl asking to
use our telephone.  We didn't give this much thought and agreed.
She made a call and immediately another two girls arrived at our
room, one of whom was wearing very little clothing.  They sat down
on our beds and said: "You must be very tired, let us give you
massages."  We realized that these girls were prostitutes and our
boss said sternly: "Please leave!  We don't need any massages."
But they refused to budge until we threatened to report them to the
police.

Having learned a lesson, we locked our door, but there were still
repeated knocks.  One time our door was opened with a key and in
came a seductive woman carrying a teapot.  She said: "Aren't you
lonely in this small town without me?"  Despite her curses, we
managed to drive her out.  At ten o'clock, my boss and my colleague
went downstairs to arrange for our transportation for the next day.
As soon as they left, another girl came in and said: "You must have
been away from home for many days, don't you need female services?"
When I pushed her away, she cursed at me saying: "Are you afraid
that I'll rape you, you old scoundrel!"  During that one evening,
altogether there were five groups of prostitutes who knocked at our
door.

The following morning we went to the front desk and demanded to
know how the prostitute had obtained a key to our room.  The clerk
said: "She said that you wanted some drinking water. How could I
know she was a bad woman?  There are too many young girls here from
Sichuan and Heilongjiang - when they can't find jobs, they have to
sell themselves."

Your Brother,
Wu Zhixin

The Red and the Black

from CHINA FOCUS, Volume 4, Number 11, November 1, 1996

by Jin Dabai

While the Chinese Communist regime is trying its best to block the
way for democracy in China, the so-called "black gangs" (criminal
syndicates) have successfully penetrated into many mid-level and
grass-root institutions, sometimes even replacing the local
regimes.

As early as 1991, the Ministry of Public Security had exposed a
powerful black gang in Gaoyang county, Hebei province.  Though this
criminal syndicate had only some sixty members, the Ministry of
Public Security had to mobilize forces from Hebei, Heilongjiang,
Jilin, Shandong, Liaoning, Beijing, and Tianjin to crack it.  Why?
Because it had infiltrated into many government and Party
institutions.  Even after the syndicate was cracked, its remnants
still managed to seep into the judicial system, using different
hoaxes, to rescue three of its bosses, finally getting them out on
bail.

The black gangs are growing very rapidly, their power reaching
almost every stratum of the society.  In Nanjing, the capital city
of Jiangsu province, four criminal gangs have divided the city up
into four turfs.  They demand "protection fees" from the businesses
and residents within their turfs and help settle disputes among
residents as if they are government mediators.  Residents who
usually are afraid to go to public security departments or courts
of law prefer to deal with people from the black gangs.

Over the years, the black gangs have gradually wormed their way
into various institutions of the regime; by bribing officials they
have used legal means to obtain power.  With officials to back them
up, the gangsters can do whatever they wish.  Some gangsters are
even officials themselves.  In some provinces in the south, it was
found that quite a few of the local heads of the public security
departments are also black gang bosses.  This is why the Beijing
regime recently decided to rotate local public security heads.

Some officials who find it difficult to solve such problems as
debts, civil disputes, and problems of public order through
officials channels often resort to the black gangs to settle these
disputes and problems.  It is a common practice for managers to
hire gangsters to force debtors to pay up; if the debtor refused,
then he might have to pay with an ear, a hand, or even with his
life.  There is a fixed price-list in Shenzhen for carrying out
such "jobs": chopping off a hand, 8,000 RMB; a foot, 10,000 RMB;
for taking one's life, 30,000 RMB.  Recently the public security
department in Shenzhen arrested two members of a butcher ring.
They had been hired by Mr.Fan, the general manager of a
corporation, to "teach a lesson" to Mr. Wang, the manager of a taxi
company. Fan was willing to pay 30,000 RMB, but, afraid that he
might be caught and face a death sentence, he told the executioners
that he would be satisfied with their merely incapacitating Wang.
However, by mistake a taxi driver was beaten up and the case was
exposed.  When these two butchers confessed, they revealed
information about the price-list; they confessed that they had been
hired several times and that as soon as they were paid they would
go out and "do their job."

Both the officials and gangsters find such cooperation very useful:
the gangsters with official power in their hands become more
powerful; and corrupt officials with support from the black gangs
actually have an "army" at their beck and call.  In a township in
Hunan province, there is a tacit understanding between the local
government and the black gangs: the gangsters will collect
protection fees from the local markets and businesses; and whenever
the public security department wants help in cracking a case, the
black gangs will give assistance.  The township officials see
nothing wrong with this cooperation.  Such cooperation has
developed to such an extent that in some localities the black gangs
regard themselves as the regime itself.

The current trend among the black gangs is to buy out grass-root
Party and government cadres so that they have more valid
protection.  The black gangs in the countryside are making use of
the clans to rope the cadres or to bribe officials in grass-root
elections so that the black gangs bosses are elected to public
office.

The Two Chinas - In the Media and in Reality

from CHINA FOCUS, Volume 4, Number 11, November 1, 1996

by Chen Yen

In August, I went back to China to visit my family and to tour the
country.  In addition to brief stays in big cities like Beijing and
Xi'an, I also visited a number of inland counties and villages in
Sichuan and Hubei provinces.  I have to say that it was quite an
experience.  The most intense realization I had was that the China
that I saw with my own eyes is greatly different from the China
portrayed in various overseas media in Europe, America, Hong Kong,
and Taiwan.

I should say that there is another China that is real but that is
being ignored in the media.

The overseas media reports on China often cite numbers, but these
numbers are primarily from China's official statistics.  For
example, in July of this year China's official media made many
claims: the Chinese economy had successfully achieved a "soft
landing"; the growth rate of the economy for the first half of the
year remained at 13 percent, while inflation continued to decline
to an average of 7.8 percent; and 49 percent of the state-owned
enterprises were operating at a deficit.  Except for the latter
statistic, the above officially announced figures are all positive.
However, their accurateness is questionable.  Even the number of
state-owned enterprises operating at a deficit is quite different
in reality.

Among my observations in China, the first is that the condition of
agriculture is very bad.  This year flooding has been very serious
in the south and there was a bad harvest of the summer crops.
Disallowing for the flooded fields, the crops had rotted in 30 to
40 percent of the remaining fields.  In Sichuan, I ran into many
peasants who had fled from the floods in Hubei province.  They
reported that all the rice paddies and cotton fields in their home
areas were flooded.  The cotton problem was the worst.  The
Jianghan plain in Hubei province used to be a famous cotton-
producing area.  But this year the cotton plants grew only stems,
and there were no buds.  Therefore, there would be a diminished
output.

The agricultural depression directly affected the market because in
inland China, business in the middle-sized and small cities mainly
depends on the buying power of the peasants.  I witnessed a
depressed economic scene in a number of counties and cities in
northern Sichuan: all the department storesin these cities had a
surplus supply of goods.  But without even one exception, these
stores had almost no shoppers.  And few people were going to
restaurants.

When we visited a city in Hubei, we were told that 90 percent of
the state-owned enterprises were idle.  Some operated occasionally,
but they could not make a profit so that the workers had to go out
to find other sources to make a living.

The problems within the state-owned enterprises have already caused
serious social consequences.  In one city in Hubei province, I
witnessed 300 workers staging a sit-in in front of the municipal
government offices.  The city officials all had to use the side
doors of the building to avoid the protesters.  The deputy mayor
had originally planned to accompany us on a tour of the city, but
since his car could not exit from the gate, he had to give up the
tour.  The protesting workers came from a local power plant.  The
city had initially collected funds from the workers so that the
plant could generate electricity but the cost of producing the
electricity was higher than purchasing it elsewhere. So the city
government decided to close down this power plant.  However, the
remaining funds collected from the workers were gobbled up by the
officials of the plant.  Although two of the officials were
arrested for this wrongdoing, the whereabouts of the workers' fund,
not to mention also their salaries, had yet to be resolved.  The
municipal government did not know how to respond to the protest.
Privately, city officials thought the workers' protest was
justified; but even if the government temporarily were able to
issue the workers small subsidies, because of its tight budget it
would not be able to ameliorate the workers' resentment.  Such
incidents are common-place in China today, so city officials across
the country are now quite accustomed to such protests.

Although what I saw during this short trip to China naturally was
limited, it was enough to make me feel the seriousness of the
country's current problems.  When I chatted with local officials, I
was surprised that they so honestly told me that local governments
at various levels all survive by submitting fake reports.
Previously there was no income base for the finances of the local
governments because they relied on the higher levels of government;
now the local governments have to rely on extorting fees from the
masses.  For example, schools now commonly ask grade school and
high school students to pay high tuitions, which in turn are
deposited in the government's coffers. Local governments then boast
that their situation is excellent because their economic growth has
taken off at an amazing speed.

A friend of mine has a position in a local government.  He told me
that though the overall situation is very poor, temporarily the
people will be able to tolerate it.  The reasons are: first, people
have an increased degree of freedom and if their own work unit
cannot pay out wages, they can still find other outside income;
second, most people have become cynical as they know that this
system will not last for long.  As a result, he said, there are two
decisive consequences to the current circumstances and these will
have a far-reaching influence.

First, since the reform started over a decade go, the people's
democratic consciousness has increased a great deal.  This means
citizens everywhere, including people in remote areas, have all
started resorting to their legal rights to express their opinions.
Street protests are an often-used technique.

Second, the relationship between the cadres and the masses at the
basic levels has changed substantially; it is now antagonistic and
competitive.  The supportive base upon which the Chinese Communist
Party used to rely among the lower-level masses has already gone
with the wind.

An Event Fueling the Power Struggle

from CHINA FOCUS, Volume 4, Number 11, November 1, 1996

by Liu Zian

Recently, an important event, which undoubtedly will intensify the
power struggle within the party central, has been unfolding.

The beginning of this event was quite common place: earlier this
year, the position of the vice secretary of the Liuzhou Prefectural
Party Committee in Guangxi Autonomous Region was vacated.  Liu
Heping, deputy mayor of a city in that prefecture, went all out to
try to secure the position.  He used to say that he had served in
the army for thirteen years and because of his achievements he had
been promoted from a common soldier to the post of the deputy head
of a regiment.  But soon a competitor for the vacated position
exposed to the regional party committee that Liu had lied about his
personal history; instead of being in the army he had actually been
a criminal who had spent thirteen years in prison.  After an
investigation, this allegation was confirmed.

Just as Liu Heping was facing a hopeless impasse, suddenly two
officers from the headquarters of the General Staff in Beijing came
to the Guangxi Autonomous Region Party Committee; they claimed that
they were entrusted by the party General Secretary Jiang Zemin to
inform the committee that Liu Heping had spent the thirteen years
in prison "to carry out a special task."  As luck would have it, Hu
Jintao, a standing committee member of the Politburo, was in
Guangxi at that time.  When Hu heard about this, he was very much
in doubt; so he verified this piece of information with Jiang Zemin
himself.  Jiang flatly denied that he had sent out those officers
on such an errand and asked that this fraud be thoroughly
investigated.

It is obvious that whoever had sent those two officers faced great
political risks.  Unless the exposure of Liu Heping would have
brought him tremendous disaster, he certainly would not have
ventured to make such a dangerous move; and if he did not have
strong support, support from someone whose safety also depended
closely on the safety of Liu Heping, this person too would not have
taken such a risk.

Indeed, the case of Liu Heping exposed a huge criminal gang which
involved many high-level officers.  The person who had sent those
two officers to intercede on behalf of Liu Heping was in a high
enough position: he was Major General Liu Shilun, head of the
Management Bureau of the General Staff Headquarters.  This
Management Bureau is in charge of providing logistic services to
all the high officers, and Liu Shilun has broad and influential
connections both in the top echelons of the military and in the
localities.

Based on many cases of corruption which have already been exposed,
Liu Shilun had acted as the go-between for high military officers
and local officials in illegal business dealings.  Liu Shilun was
also guilty of another crime: using his authority he recruited many
pretty girls from the ranks of the female soldiers and sent them to
luxurious hotels established by the military and to military guest
houses in Beijing to provide sexual services to military and local
officials.

Up to the present, one lieutenant general, three major generals,
and tens of local officials have been arrested.  The highest-
ranking officials in Tianjin municipality and in Sichuan province
were also involved.

Corruption in the army has always been more severe than in the
localities, but such cases have always been carefully covered up.
The anti-corruption campaigns have never really reached into the
military and corruption cases in the military have never been
publicly exposed.  In recent years, Jiang Zemin has been especially
careful to avoid involving the military in the anti-corruption
campaigns.  At this time, as Jiang is wooing the military for
support in the intense struggle for power in the post-Deng era, any
exposure of military corruption cases will definitely put Jiang in
a difficult position.  With so many factions in the military, it
will be very easy for one faction to find some pretext to strike at
another; Jiang certainly does not wish to be caught in the middle.

It is said that the relationship between Liu Shilun and General
Zhang Wannian, vice chairman of the Central Military Commission and
chief of the General Staff, is very close.  Zhang Wannian had
several times recommended Liu Shilun for the position of the vice
chief of the General Staff, but his proposal was vehemently
rejected by General Chi Haotian, another vice chairman of the
Central Military Commission and the minister of national defense.
The exposure of Liu Shilun has evidently put Zhang Wannian at a
disadvantage at a crucial moment when Zhang Wannian and Chi Haotian
are both contending for membership on the standing committee of the
Politburo; at the same time, these two generals both carry
significant weight in support of Jiang Zemin in the scramble to
keep his position as the General Secretary of the Chinese Communist
Party.  In view of the fact that Jiang Zemin has always favored
Zhang Wannian over Chi Haotian, the struggle that is now unfolding
surely will be intensely dramatic.
