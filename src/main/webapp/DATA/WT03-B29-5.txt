PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTOR LEADERS OPEN BALTIMORE BIOCENTER

Less than a year from the date of the BioCenter, Baltimore,
MD, ground-breaking, Senator Barbara A. Mikulski, Senator Paul
S. Sarbanes and other public and private sector leaders
have announced the completion of the BioCenter's construction.

The BioCenter, the 54,000 square foot biopharmaceutical
manufacturing facility for biotechnology companies, celebrated
its ribbon cutting celebration today with over 200 people from
the biotech community. The BioCenter is located on five acres
of land donated by the City of Baltimore adjacent to the
Hopkins Bayview Research Campus.

"The BioCenter facility is @ unique and provides a critical
resource necessary to move medical products out of the lab and
into the hands of patients," said Governor Parris N.
Glendening. "In order to keep Maryland-grown discoveries and
the resulting jobs at home and attract companies to Maryland,
the state made a strategic investment in the future of our
biotech companies through our support of the BioCenter."

The BioCenter was created by a landmark public/private
partnership, the Maryland Bioprocessing Center, organized
almost seven years ago by the State of Maryland.

Bio Science Chairman Jacques R. Rubin noted that the
BioCenter will begin operations in the first quarter of 1996.
The BioCenter has four GMP (Good Manufacturing Practices)
production suites, three for microbial products and one for
cell culture production. Bio Science at the BioCenter also
provides companies with in-house quality control labs,
qualified GMP-trained staff, client staff training, regulatory
documentation assitance and client adminstrative offices.
"Bio Science provides biotech companies with cost and time-
saving alternatives to bringing life-saving drugs to market,"
said Rubin.

NPS PHARMACEUTICALS REPORTS THIRD
QUARTER AND NINE MONTHS RESULTS

NPS Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  (NASDAQ:NPSP), of Salt Lake City,
UT, has reported operating results for the third quarter and
nine-month periods ending September 30, 1995.

For the third quarter, revenues were $1,355,000 compared to
$935,000 for the prior year. The net loss for the quarter was
$1,793,000, or $0.26 per share, compared to a net loss of
$1,695,000, or $0.25 per share, for the same quarter a year
ago.

For the nine-month period, revenues were $8,179,000 compared
to $2,925,000 for the corresponding period a year ago. The net
loss was $875,000, or $0.13 per share, compared to a net loss
of $5,080,000, or $0.89 per share, for the same period in
1994.

The increase in revenues in the third quarter of 1995
compared to the third quarter of 1994 resulted primarily from
research support payments received from the Pharmaceutical
Division of Kirin Brewing Company, Limited, as part of an
agreement to develop and commercialize NPS's treatment for
hyperparathyroidism, Norcalcin, in Japan and certain other
parts of Asia.

The net loss for the third quarter was greater in 1995 than
in 1994 primarily because of the progressively more expensive
clinical trials the company is conducting for Norcalcin in the
U.S.

Hunter Jackson, Ph.D., Chairman, President and Chief
Executive Officer of NPS, commented, "Three clinical trials
for Norcalcin were in progress during the third quarter and
we expect them to be completed near the end of the year.
Negotiations are progressing with potential corporate partners
for the commercialization of Norcalcin outside of Asia. We
are hopeful that an agreement will be reached during the
fourth quarter. Such an agreement, along with ongoing research
support payments from Kirin and SmithKIine Beecham, our
partner in osteoporosis research, will further reduce our net
cash requirements and accelerate development of Norcalcin."

NPS Pharmaceuticals, a development-stage company founded in
1986 and headquartered in Salt Lake City, combines a novel
focus on ion-related drug targets with valuable drug discovery
leads from non-traditional natural product sources. The
company is currently devoting the bulk of its research and
development efforts to hyperparathyroidism, osteoporosis and
central nervous system disorders, including chronic pain and
brain damage from stroke.

INTERFERON SCIENCES, INC. REPORTS THIRD QUARTER RESULTS

Interferon Sciences, Inc.  (NASDAQ-IFSC) has reported a net
loss of $1,972,000 for the quarter ended September 30, 1995,
as compared to a net loss of $4,367,000 for the same period in
1994. The decreased loss results primarily from the write-off
of prepaid royalty expenses to Hoffmann-La Roche of
approximately $2,000,000 during the third quarter of 1994.

SCHERING-PLOUGH BOARD ELECTS RICHARD KOGAN TO CEO
AND ROBERT P. LUCIANO CONTINUES AS CHAIRMAN OF BOARD

Richard J. Kogan, president and chief operating officer of
Schering-Plough Corporation (NYSE:SGP), has been elected
president and chief executive officer by the company's Board
of Directors, effective Jan. 1, 1996. Kogan will succeed
Robert P. Luciano, who will continue to serve as chairman of
the Board.

Kogan, 54, has served as Schering-Plough's president and COO
since 1986, and as a member of the Board of Directors since
1982. Luciano, 62, has been Schering-Plough's CEO since 1982
and chairman since 1984. He will remain as chairman of the
Board for another three years upon relinquishing his CEO title
on Jan. 1.

I am pleased that the Board has agreed with my recommendation
that Dick Kogan be elected Schering-Plough's new chief
executive officer," said Luciano. "I've known and worked with
him for nearly 30 years. He's a top-notch executive, with the
hard-driving, far-sighted capabilities needed to lead a
pharmaceutical company during these challenging times. I have
every confidence in his ability to continue Schering-Plough's
successful record."

Kogan credited Luciano with shaping a $1.8 billion (1982
sales) company, which then encompassed a range of businesses
that included radio stations, home repair products, sandals
and cosmetics, into a focused, research-driven pharmaceutical
company, with 1994 sales of $4.5 billion.

"In the nearly 14 years that Bob Luciano has led Schering-
Plough, this company has achieved a total rate of return for
shareholders unmatched in the industry," said Kogan. "He has
brought Schering-Plough to a position of strength, directing
the company's investments in biotechnology and leading-edge
sciences, guiding the renewal of its infrastructure, and
overseeing its expansion into major international markets,"
said Kogan.

Observing that the management team responsible for Schering-
Plough's achievements remains in place, Kogan said he intends
to continue the strategies that have benefited shareholders
and served as the company's blueprint for growth and
competitive success. He said the following key objectives will
stay as priorities:

0 Attracting and developing talented employees, and then
continually challenging and rewarding them;

0 Remaining committed to research and development, focusing on
innovative products that can conquer, treat or prevent life-
threatening diseases in an effective manner;

0 Exercising flexibility and speed in anticipating and
adapting quickly to market changes and the needs of customers;

9 Maintaining financial strength to provide the resources to
compete and grow, while providing attractive returns to
shareholders;

Maintaining vigilant and rigorous control over all costs; and

Upholding the highest ethical, business and compliance
standards in the conduct of the company's business worldwide.

"These have been my benchmarks since joining Schering-Plough,"
said Kogan, "and if we hold fast to them -- never taking our
eye off the ball -- we can expect to see this company continue
to grow and prosper well into the next century."

Reporting to Kogan will be Raul E. Cesan, executive vice
president and president of Schering-Plough Pharmaceuticals;
Donald R. Conklin, executive vice president and president of
Schering-Plough HealthCare Products; Hugh A. D'Andrade,
executive vice president - administration; Harold R. Hiser,
Jr., executive vice president - finance; and Gordon C.
O'Brien, senior vice president - human resources.

Kogan joined Schering-Plough in April 1982 as executive vice
president - pharmaceutical operations, and was elected
president and chief operating officer on Jan. 1, 1986. Before
joining Schering-Plough, he was president of the U.S.
pharmaceuticals division of Ciba-Geigy Corporation. A native
of New York City, Kogan received his B.A. from The City
College of the City University of New York and an M.B.A. from
the Stern School of Business at New York University.

Kogan is a trustee of Atlantic Mutual Companies and a director
of the affiliated Centennial Insurance Company. He also is a
member of the boards of directors of NatWest Bancorp, General
Signal Corporation and the Saint Barnabas Medical Center,
Livingston, N.J. He is president of the International
Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Associations, a
member and past chairman of the Pharmaceutical Research and
Manufacturers of America, and a member of the Council on
Foreign Relations.

Schering-Plough is a research-based company engaged in the
discovery, development, manufacturing and marketing of
pharmaceutical and health care products worldwide.

SEPRAGEN CORPORATION REPORTS THIRD QUARTER RESULTS

Sepragen Corporation (NASDAQ: SPGNU, SPGNA, SPGNW, SPGNZ), of
San Leandro, CA, which develops and manufactures
chromatography columns and computer-controlled process systems
for the biotech and other industries, has reported results for
the quarter ended September 30, 1995.

Net sales for the 1995 quarter were $90,711, down from
$882,295 in the same period in 1994. The net loss for the
quarter ended September 30, 1995, was $873,319, or (0.31)
cents a share, compared with a loss of $45,846, or (0.06)
cents a share, for the 1994 quarter, based on a weighted
average number of shares outstanding of 2,855,032 and 735,528,
respectively.

For the nine months ended September 30, 1995, net sales were
$888,643, down 45 percent from $1,607,050 for the same period
in 1994. The net loss for the nine months ended September 30
was $1,873,131, or (0.87) cents a share, compared with a loss
of $370,619 or (0.50) for the same period in 1994, based on a
weighted average number of shares outstanding of 2,141,595
and 735,528, respectively.

Vinit Saxena, president and chief executive officer, said the
higher 1994 sales figures reflected a large single order for
QuantaSep systems that the company shipped in the third
quarter of 1994. "We expect that revenues generated from sales
of large industrial scale Superflo columns and large QuantaSep
systems will continue to be a significant portion of our
revenue in the immediate future," Saxena said. "We have
experienced, and continue to experience, volatility in revenue
on a quarter-to-quarter basis.

Selling, general and administrative costs totaled $593,778 in
the third quarter of 1995, nearly double the amount in the
third quarter of 1994. The expenses are part of the company's
plan to increase growth through new hires, plans for a new
facility and time spent on new marketing programs and
strategic alliances. In addition, the company's research and
development expenses were $287,745 in the third quarter of
1995, more than double the amount spent in the third quarter
of 1994. The increase was attributable to expenditures
related to the development of a process for dairy whey
fractionation, the development of a special absorbent media
and further development of QuantaSep products.

Sepragen Corporation is a pioneer in the development of
large-scale chromatography products and technology for the
biopharmaceutical industry. The company markets patented
Radial Flow Chromatography (RFC) columns, computer-controlled
process chromatography workstations and process technology to
the biotechnology and food industries. Based in San Leandro,

HMO'S TEAM WITH BIOTECH FIRMS TO BOOST BOTTOM LINE

Biotechnology companies are increasingly teaming up with
managed care organizations to help them finance growth,
leverage technology, and market products, according to a KPMG
Peat Marwick industry guide book, "Blueprint for Growth:
Building the Biotechnology Business."

Industry restructuring, including new alliances between
biotech and managed care companies, is a key finding in the
83-page KPMG industry guide book, which creates a profile of a
complex industry in the process of self renewal. Based on
survey data collected from 374 biotech executives, the guide
book provides a prescription for industry growth. For copies
of the KPMG report, contact Anna Le Goff, KPMG national life
sciences at (800)330-KPMG or via FAX at (609)896-2968.

According to the guide book, managed care providers will
account for 90 percent of the prescription drug customers in
the United States by the turn of the century. Although this
linkage between biotech companies and managed care
organizations has yet to be fully embraced by the industry,
some progressive biotechs have joined forces with HMO's.

Collaborations make sense for both parties, according to
Robert S. Esposito, national director of biotechnology and
life sciences for KPMG Peat Marwick's Health Care & Life
Sciences Practice. Biotechnology companies are affected by
the health care environment emphasis on providing care more
efficiently and more cost-effectively; an emphasis that is
even morepronouncedinthemanagedcarearea.

Biotechnology companies can fulfill that joint requirement by
developing a product that can, for example, eliminate a
costly procedure or reduce a hospital stay due to its
efficacy. The challenge is for those companies to build
efficiencies into their product development process that will
help reduce the burden of their R&D costs on the bottom line.

HMO's and other health care payers have access to billions of
investment dollars; biotech companies need partners to fund
drug development programs. "HMO's combined have in excess $35
billion in reserves available for investment," Esposito says,
"which is more money in the aggregate than the major
pharmaceutical companies," he points out. Pharmaceutical
companies have historically provided biotech inns with an
important source of equity and revenue streams. Some 61
percent of the biotech companies responding to a KPMG survey
have licensed technology to drug companies in exchange for
cash and a future royalty stream.

This year marked a significant turnaround in the biotech
industry, according to Esposito. "It is the first time that
revenue units (premiums) are not going to increase faster
than the rate of inflation. Clearly, biotechnology products
have to be incrementally efficacious; but they're also going
to have to be cheaper," said Esposito.

Pharmacoeconomic studies, conducted as early in the
development process as possible, will become more important in
bringing drugs to market, Esposito predicts. "If they don't
conduct these studies," Esposito cautions, "companies run the
risk of losing out to the competition on what may have been a
breakthrough therapy." Esposito adds, "Pharmaceuticals are
going to be used increasingly in a very different way. Key to
that is pharmacoeconomics. These studies will be critical for
HMO's for the next five years or so."

Pharmacoeconomic studies are developed with one overriding
objective: cost effectiveness. "Biotech companies have to make
their drugs compelling and to be ahead of the competition in
order to make a solid pharmacoeconomic argument; not just a
better drug or that it has a higher cure rate. Instead, the
company must be able to support its product by stating it will
save the system money versus some alternative drugs or no-drug
therapies."

Those companies that incorporate pharmacoeconomic studies in
preclinical trials will be positioned substantially better to
meet changing market trends, including increasing competition.
"Plus," said Esposito, "HMO's will list those drugs on their
formularies. That's a marketing reality."

The KPMG survey data report that about 64 percent of
companies in clinical trials made an effort to conduct
pharmacoeconomic studies before they launched their product.
The use of such studies is on the rise. The number of
pharmacoeconomic studies per company rose from 1.7 in 1988
to 23.7 in 1994, according to the guide book.

The publication's other findings describe an industry in
transition. They include the following:

* The emergence of a new industry structure based on customer
focus in product development. Although nearly 9 in I *
executives (89 percent) report that they are focused on
creating breakthrough therapies, a traditional business
strategy, companies realize that mastering the clinical
approval process is key to future development.

* Steady industry growth, despite recent downsizing. Between
1990 and 1993, the average number of employees at a company
rose from 62 to 99. The average amount of space occupied rose
from 30,150 square feet to 56,661 square feet.

* Recruitment and competitive compensation are the two most
challenging human resource issues. Companies are out-sourcing
functions such as money management, regulatory affairs, legal
counsel, and facility compliance to remain as lean as
possible.

* The year 1994, while one of the dimmest years for equity
financing, also saw companies focused on raising capital. Some
70 percent of survey respondents report that senior management
and business development teams are actively marketing their
technologies to investors. Moreover, the marketing process is
beginning earlier.

KPMG Peat Marwick LLP is the U.S. practice of KPMG, the
Global Leader among professional services firms.

Worldwide, KPMG has more than 6,000 partners as well as
67,000 professionals serving clients in more than 134
