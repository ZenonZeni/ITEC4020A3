<H1>The links between climate change 
and<BR>
acid rain policies</H1>
<HR>
<B>The problems of climate change and acid are distinct but related.</B>  Climate 
change is a global problem that concerns all countries, while acid rain is a regional 
problem concerning individual countries and their neighbours.  Climate change is caused 
by man-made emissions of the so-called <A HREF = 
"fs002.html">greenhouse gases (GHGs)</A>. These non-toxic 
gases, most of which occur naturally in the atmosphere and are not pollutants, include 
carbon dioxide, methane, CFCs, and nitrous oxide.  Acid rain is caused by toxic industrial 
smoke containing sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and chloride.  These chemical 
compounds break down in the atmosphere into their respective acids - sulphuric, nitric, 
and hydrochloric - which are deposited on the earth in the form of dry gas, rain, snow, 
mist, or fog.  These two environmental problems are clearly different - but they are also 
linked in important ways.<P>
<B>Reducing emissions of carbon dioxide to combat climate change would also 
reduce acid rain.</B>  There are at present no economically competitive "end-of-pipe" 
or "scrubbing" technologies for removing carbon dioxide (CO2) from industrial 
smokestacks.  CO2 emissions can only be cut by reducing the use of fossil fuel, whether 
by lowering energy use per unit of economic production or substituting low- and 
non-carbon fuel for high-carbon fuels.  On average, reducing one tonne (1,000 kg) of 
carbon simultaneously reduces about 20 kg of sulphur dioxide and eight kg of nitrogen 
oxides from stationary sources such as factories, and about 0.5 and 9 kg respectively from 
mobile sources such as cars.  From the point of view of policies to cut GHG emissions, 
this secondary benefit of reducing acid rain may be considerable; it may even, at least 
initially, exceed the primary benefit of reduced warming by a factor of 10 or 20.  If these 
figures are accurate, they lend additional support to economic arguments for <A HREF = 
"fs230.html">carbon taxes</A> and other policies for reducing 
GHG emissions.<P>
<B>Reducing emissions of sulphur dioxide to combat acid rain would probably 
affect the rate of global warming. </B> Rather than reducing fossil fuel use, which cuts 
emissions of all fuel-related gases, policies to control SO2 emissions call for installing flue 
gas desulphurisation and other end-of-pipe technologies and for substituting low-sulphur 
fuels for high-sulphur fuels.  While leaving GHGs untouched, these technologies will 
reduce the sulphur dioxide and other sulphuric particles floating in the atmosphere as 
"aerosols".  By scattering and reflecting the sun's light away from the earth (causing bright 
red sunsets), these particles have a cooling effect on the lower atmosphere.  In the highly 
industrialised Northern Hemisphere, sulphur particles in the atmosphere may be offsetting 
at least half of the current man-made warming.  In the less-industrialised southern 
hemisphere, the offsetting effect may be almost negligible.  The potency of sulphur cooling 
has recently been demonstrated with the volcanic eruption of Mount Pinatubo in June 
1991.  This massive release of sulphur particles into the stratosphere seems to have cooled 
the earth by  0.5  C on average between May 1991 and May 1992.<P>
<B>A warmer atmosphere would influence the occurrence and severity of acid 
rain.</B>  Many of the chemical reactions that lead to the formation of acid rain are 
affected by temperature.  Higher temperatures usually accelerate reactions, suggesting that 
global warming is likely to increase the formation of acidic materials.  The likely net effect 
on acid rain is unclear, however, since global warming will also cause changes in cloud, 
wind, and precipitation patterns.<P>
<B>Because of these linkages, there are benefits to designing acid rain and climate 
change policies simultaneously.</B>  Cost benefit analyses of policies to reduce GHG 
emissions normally suggest that reductions should take place as long as the marginal <A 
HREF = "fs228.html">costs </A>of reduction are smaller than 
the marginal <A HREF = "fs229.html">benefits</A> of avoided 
global warming.  Because reducing GHG emissions also reduces acid rain, however, the 
marginal benefits of this secondary reduction should also be considered in the analysis.  
Similarly, a cost benefit analysis of reducing sulphur emissions should consider the 
marginal benefits of avoided acid rain, the marginal costs of making the reductions, plus 
the additional costs of increased global warming due to the reduction in atmospheric 
aerosols.<P>
