<BODY BACKGROUND="wall.gif" BGCOLOR="FFFFFF"><H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Accuracy vs.
Repeatability</H1>
<P>There is much confusion in the industry about the differences between
accuracy and repeatability. The two terms are mutually exclusive, a robot does
not have to be accurate to be repeatable, and a robot does not have to be
repeatable to be accurate. It is important to understand the differences between
these two specifications.</P>

<TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="LEFT" COLSTART="2"><P><B><FONT SIZE="+2">Repeatability</FONT></B><BR>Repeatability
is the degree to which a robot is able to return to a specific translation or
position point in the workcell. In this procedure a robot is taught the required
point by moving the arm to the location with the teach pendant and then pushing
the program-point button. The repeatability specification thus describes <I>how
closely the robot arm reproduces the taught point</I> on each cycle of the
program execution. Notice on the bullseye to the left that the marksman has
grouped his shots close together, however his grouping is far from the bullseye.
Repeatability can be thought of as how good of a grouping can be made.</P></TD></TR><TR

<TD COLSTART="2"><P><B><FONT SIZE="+2">Accuracy</FONT></B><BR>Accuracy is
the degree to which a robot arm is able to move to a specific translation or
position point in the workcell when the point coordinates are entered from an
off-line programming station, calculated inside the program, or received from a
vision system. For example, a simulation program could specify that the arm
should move to a point described as X = 50.00 inches, Y = 45.30 inches, Z =
10.01 inches, Roll = 0.00 degrees, Pitch = 90.00 degrees, and Yaw = 100.00
degrees. The accuracy specification describes <I>how close the arm will be when
it moves to the desired point</I>. Typical robot accuracy is about two
magnitudes greater than the arm's repeatability. On the bullseye to the left,
notice that all the holes are centered around the middle of the target, but the
grouping is not very close together. You do not have to have good repeatability
to have good accuracy.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD COLSTART="1"><IMG

<TD COLSTART="2"><P><B><FONT SIZE="+2">Accuracy <I>and</I> Repeatability</FONT></B><BR>Accuracy
and repeatability are the measure of how close to a programmed point the robot
can come, and how close it gets to that same point again. Notice on the bullseye
that the points are centered around the middle of the target and are grouped
close together. This is good accuracy and repeatability. A robot in this
situation will  be the easiest to off-line program.</P></TD></TR>
