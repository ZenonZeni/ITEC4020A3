<PRE>
     Chairman Pitofsky:  The hour is late and I will be 
brief.  We started off by thanking the staff for putting 
together this wonderful set of hearings.  I would like 
to thank with equal enthusiasm the participants in these 
programs, and the audience, for playing a part in such 
an informed an thoughtful way.
     This agency has a history of bringing people 
together, exchanging views, gathering facts, framing 
issues.  And I can't think of a more appropriate area to 
do that in than where the commercial world meets the 
future.  And that's the way I felt about these two days 
of hearings.
     I am extremely encouraged by the efforts that have 
already taken place by people who are drafting 
guidelines, and I share Dan Jaffe's thought that there 
is some convergence here.  At least there is a 
convergence in the sense that all participants think 
this is an important problem that needs to be addressed.
     There has been some talk, especially in the last 
hour or so, about whether voluntary guidelines ever 
work.  I don't think it's appropriate to go into a 
project like this with the assumption that voluntary 
guidelines will not work.
     This agency has been burned in the past by groups 
who suggested voluntary guidelines and then they weren't 
worth the paper they were written on.  On the other 
hand, there are other voluntary groups that developed 
self-regulatory programs that worked very well.  And 
were supplemented, in some instances, by agency 
enforcement behind those guidelines.
     It's one thing to be skeptical, and to be demanding 
and rigorous about what the guidelines are.  But I just 
don't see any -- I don't think it's appropriate to start 
off with the assumption that they won't work and that we 
have to have government regulation.
     Believe it or not, there are some people who think 
government regulation doesn't work all that well either.  
And in an era in which all of government must do more 
with less, we cannot afford to ignore the possibility 
that cooperation and collaboration will lead to the 
appropriate result.
     We will prepare a report on these sessions.  The 
report will, I hope, reflect all, or most, of the views 
that were expressed here.  I think that several people 
have suggested focus groups on some of these subjects, 
and I gather there is already some interest on the part 
of independent groups of doing exactly that sort of 
thing.
     There is too much information, too many issues have 
been explored here to try to digest them at this point, 
but we will have a report.  And with that report, we 
will see where we go from there.
     I want to thank all of you for your excellent 
participation in these sessions.
     (Whereupon, at 1:12 p.m., the workshop was 
adjourned.)
