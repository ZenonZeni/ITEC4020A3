                <Td width=50%><h3><center>Comparative Immigration and

Integration Program<p></center></h3>


The Center for German and European Studies, a systemwide program housed on the

UC-Berkeley campus, in January 1994 supported the creation of the Comparative

Immigration and Integration Program to promote interdisciplinary and comparative

research on immigration and integration issues facing industrial democracies in

North America and Europe.  


The CGES-CIIP each year funds 10 to 20 faculty researchers, and 10 to 20

graduate student projects, and holds two to three research work shops.  UC

faculty and graduate students interested in comparative migration issues are

invited to participate in the CIIP's research seminars and in the annual RFP

competition; both are announced in Migration News.


For further information, please contact Gia White at the Center for German and

European Studies-- gia@uclink.berkeley.edu


</Td> <Td valign=top ><h3><center>California Policy Seminar</center><p></h3>


The California Policy Seminar established an Immigration Policy Panel co-chaired

by Manuel Garcia y Griego (UCI) and Philip Martin (UCD) in 1995 to help policy

makers and opinion leaders understand how immigration and integration issues are

affecting California's economy, politics, and society.  The panel supports

research, the preparation of option papers, and holds seminars on immigration

issues in Sacramento for state employees who deal with immigration and

integration issues.
