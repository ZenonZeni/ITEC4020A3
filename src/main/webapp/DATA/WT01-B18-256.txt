     II.  CONGRESS, DEA, AND THE COURTS HAVE ALL FOUND THAT

          MUST REMAIN THERE UNTIL IT SATISFIES THE CRITERIA

                     <B>STATEMENT OF THE ISSUE</B>

     Whether the Drug Enforcement Administration properly

rejected the petitioner's theory that marihuana plants should be

moved from Schedule I to Schedule II of the Controlled Substances

Act because marihuana plants are a source of an accepted and

useful medication when the petitioner's theory was based solely

upon language in an informal letter and was contradicted directly

by the plain language of the Controlled Substances Act.

                     <B>STATUTES AND REGULATIONS</B>

     Except for those already included in the Addendum to the

Petitioner's Brief, the pertinent statutes and regulations are

set forth in an addendum bound with this brief.

                                1
<HR>
                       STATEMENT OF THE CASE

I.   STATUTORY AND REGULATORY BACKGROUND

     In response to the growing drug problem in the United

States, Congress in 1970 passed the Controlled Substances Act, <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/21/801.html">21

U.S.C. 801 <i>et seq.</i></a> ("CSA").  The CSA classifies various hazardous

drugs into five schedules.  <i>Id</i>. <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/21/812.html">812</a>.  Restrictions upon use and

access to a particular drug vary based upon the drug's schedule

status in the CSA.  Drugs in Schedule I are subject to more

severe restrictions than drugs in the other schedules.  See

<i>Alliance for Cannabis Therapeutics</i> v. <i>Drug Enforcement Admin.</i>,

930 F.2d 936, 937 (D.C. Cir. 1991).  Congress placed marihuana in

Schedule I of the CSA.<A HREF="#1">1</A>  21 U.S.C. 812(c), Schedule I(c)(10).

     Although Congress made the initial scheduling decisions, the

CSA specifically permits the Attorney General to add a substance

to a schedule, transfer a substance from one schedule to another

or remove a substance from the schedules entirely.  <i>Id</i>. <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/21/811.html">811</a>(a).

The Attorney General may only transfer a substance to a different

schedule if she "finds that such drug or other substance has a

potential for abuse" and makes findings that the drug or

substance meets the requirements for the new schedule.  <i>Id</i>.  The

findings required for placing a substance in a particular

schedule are listed in 21 U.S.C. 812(b).  The Attorney General

has delegated the authority to reschedule controlled substances

____________________

     <A NAME="1">1</A>    The substance is called "marihuana" in the CSA and the
respondent will use that spelling throughout this brief.
However, where the spelling "marijuana" is used in a quoted
passage, the spelling has not been changed.

                                2
<HR>
to the Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration

("DEA").  28 C.F.R. 0.100(b).  The Drug Enforcement Administrator

("Administrator") has further delegated this authority to the

Deputy Administrator.  28 C.F.R. 0.104.

     For over 20 years, various groups and individuals have asked

DEA to exercise its authority to move marihuana from Schedule I

to a less restrictive schedule or to remove marihuana from the

CSA schedules entirely.  See <i>Alliance for Cannabis Therapeutics</i>

v. <i>Drug Enforcement Admin.</i>, 15 F.3d 1131 (D.C. Cir. 1994);

<i>Alliance for Cannabis Therapeutics</i>, 930 F.2d at 937; <i>National

Org. for the Reform of Marijuana Laws</i> v. <i>Drug Enforcement Admin.</i>,

559 F.2d 735 (D.C. Cir. 1977); <i>National Org. for the Reform of

Marijuana Laws</i> v. <i>Ingersoll</i>, 497 F.2d 654 (D.C. Cir. 1974).

Despite these efforts, in March of 1992, the Administrator issued

a final order denying a petition to reschedule marihuana from

Schedule I to Schedule II of the CSA.  See 57 Fed. Reg. 10,499

(1992).<A HREF="#2">2</A>

     The Administrator relied upon the language of the CSA in

____________________

     <A NAME="2">2</A>    DEA's review of the rescheduling petition was quite
extensive.  DEA issued a notice of a hearing on the rescheduling
petition in 1986.  See 51 Fed. Reg. 22,946 (1986).  After
hearings before an administrative law judge, the Administrator
issued findings of fact and conclusions of law that determined
that marihuana should not be moved from Schedule I because the
marihuana plant has no currently accepted medical use and because
it is not safe for use, even under medical supervision.  See 54
Fed. Reg. 53,767, 53,784 (1989).  On appeal, this court generally
upheld the Administrator's decision but remanded the matter for
clarification.  See <i>Alliance for Cannabis Therapeutics</i>, 930 F.2d
at 940-941.  On remand, the Administrator again found that
marihuana plants should remain in Schedule I.  See 57 Fed. Reg.
at 10,507-10,508.  The latter decision was affirmed by this Court
in <i>Alliance for Cannabis Therapeutics</i>, 15 F.3d at 1137.

                                3
<HR>
making his determination.  Under the CSA, a drug or substance may

not be placed in Schedule II absent findings that:

     (A)  The drug or other substance has a high
          potential for abuse.

     (B)  The drug or other substance has a currently
          accepted medical use in treatment in the
          United States or a currently accepted medical
          use with severe restrictions.

     (C)  Abuse of the drug or other substances may
          lead to severe psychological or physical
          dependence.

21 U.S.C. 812(b)(2)(A)-(C).

     In the Administrator's final order, he concluded that the

marihuana plant had no currently accepted medical use and thus

could not be placed in schedule II.  57 Fed. Reg. at 10,499.

The Administrator applied a five-part test for determining

whether a substance had a currently accepted medical use:

     (1)  the drug's chemistry must be known and reproducible;

     (2)  there must be adequate safety studies;

     (3)  there must be adequate and well-controlled
          studies proving efficacy;

     (4)  the drug must be accepted by qualified experts; and

     (5)  the scientific evidence must be widely available.

57 Fed. Reg. at 10,504-10,507.  After reviewing the evidence in

the record, the Administrator found that marihuana could not

satisfy a single one of these criteria.  <i>Id</i>. at 10,507.  These

findings, as well as other findings of fact and conclusions of

law, resulted in the denial of the marihuana rescheduling

petition.

                                4
<HR>
<B>II.  THE CURRENT PROCEEDINGS</B>

     On July 21, 1992, the petitioner sent a letter to then-

Administrator Robert C. Bonner in which he raised several 

questions about the Administrator's final order.  In the letter, 

the petitioner appeared to agree with the Administrator's finding

that marihuana, as a plant, failed to satisfy the first part of

the test for determining a currently accepted medical use because

a plant such as marihuana is not a scientifically established

compound capable of reproduction in standard dosages.  A. 1.<A HREF="#3">3</A>

The petitioner's letter then asked why coca and opium plants (the

sources of cocaine, morphine, and heroin) were placed in Schedule

II.  <I>Id</I>.  If, the petitioner reasoned, coca and opium plants are

subject to the same scientific variances as marihuana plants,

then DEA is "treating marijuana unfairly."  <I>Id</I>.  The petitioner

suggested either removing all plants from the CSA schedules

because they "will never fit into your definition of drugs" or

treatment of the different plants.  <I>Id</I>.

     On August 17, 1992, Administrator Bonner sent the petitioner

a response to his letter.  A. 5.  In the response, the

Administrator rejected the petitioner's attempt to analogize

marihuana plants to coca and opium plants.  <I>Id</I>.  The

Administrator explained that when Congress placed coca leaves and

opium plant materials in Schedule II, it was aware that these

plants had been recognized historically as the source for a

variety of accepted and useful medications.  <I>Id</I>.  The plants

contain medically active alkaloids that can be extracted and used

to produce pharmaceutical compounds capable of reproduction in

standardized doses.  <I>Id</I>.  In contrast, the Administrator pointed

out that the recent attempts to reschedule marihuana were not

grounded on claims that medically useful compounds could be

extracted from marihuana, but rather that smoking marihuana

itself produced medical benefits.  <I>Id</I>.  Thus, the Administrator

found the scheduling decisions to be reconcilable.  <I>Id</I>. at 5-6.

     The petitioner, proceeding t)ro se, then filed a formal

request for the rescheduling of marihuana pursuant to 21 U.S.C.

811 and 21 C.F.R. 1307.03.<A HREF="#4">4</A>  A. 2-4.  In his petition, he drew

an analogy from language in the Administrator's letter of August

be placed in Schedule II because they are sources of accepted and

Additionally, the petitioner has brought numerous civil actions
seeking to obtain judicial authorization to use marihuana.  See
<I>Olsen</I> v. <I>Drug Enforcement Admin.</I>, 878 F.2d 1458, 1461-1465 (D.C.

considered a petition to reschedule marihuana from Schedule I to
Schedule II of the CSA.  See 54 Fed. Reg. at 53,767.

useful medications, then marihuana plants could be placed in

schedule II if marihuana is shown to be "a source for an accepted

and useful medication."  A. 3.  The petitioner then noted that

dronabinol, a synthetic equivalent of the isomer which is the

principle psychoactive substance in marihuana, has been

rescheduled to Schedule II.  <I>Id</I>.  Because marihuana is the source

of an accepted and useful medication, dronabinol, the petitioner

reasoned that marihuana must be moved to Schedule II of the CSA.

Id. at 4.  The petitioner then requested that the Administrator

reschedule marihuana from Schedule I to Schedule II of the CSA.

Id. at 2.<A HREF="#5">5</A>

     The Administrator initially refused to accept the

rescheduling petition because dronabinol is a wholly synthetic

substance and is not obtained from marihuana.  A. 7.  However,

after the petitioner appealed, DEA voluntarily asked this court

to remand the petition for a ruling.  This court remanded the

petition in an Order dated December 9, 1993.  See <I>Olsen</I> v. <I>Drug</I>

<I>Enforcement Admin.</I>, No. 93-1109 (D.C. Cir. Dec. 9, 1993).

     On May 16, 1994, Deputy Administrator Stephen H. Greene

issued a nine-page final order denying the petition.  A. 17.  The

final order explained that Congress placed marihuana in Schedule

I.  A. 19-20.  It rejected the petitioner's analogy, finding that

marihuana can only be moved from Schedule I if there is a finding

that marihuana has a "currently accepted medical use in treatment

in the United States."  A. 22.  The order acknowledged that (-)

delta-9-trans-THC isomer, the principal psychoactive ingredient

in marihuana, is also the ingredient in a pharmaceutical product

that has proven to be a safe and effective anti-emetic for

patients receiving cancer chemotherapy.  <I>Id</I>.  However, the order

noted that only a very specific synthetic dronabinol product was

rescheduled to Schedule II -- "dronabinol ("synthetic) in sesame

oil and encapsulated in a soft gelatin capsule" in a drug product

approved by the Food and Drug Administration ("FDA").  A. 23.

The order further stated that the regulation of plants and

chemicals under the CSA is distinct and that the CSA requires the

independent evaluation of each individual controlled substance.

A. 24.  The final order reaffirmed that marihuana plants have no

currently accepted medical use in treatment and found that the

rescheduling of one pharmaceutical product did not require DEA to

transfer marihuana plants or any other substance to Schedule II.

A. 24-25.

     The petitioner has appealed the final order to this court

pursuant to 21 U.S.C. 877.

                     <B>SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT</B>

     Congress placed marihuana in Schedule I of the CSA and this

decision has been consistently approved by the courts.  The

petitioner is incorrect in asserting that marihuana must be moved

from Schedule I to Schedule II if it is a source of an accepted

and useful medication.  The plain language of the CSA requires

that a substance itself must have a currently accepted medical

                                8
<HR>
use before it may be moved from Schedule I to Schedule II.  The

petitioner has failed to provide any evidence to suggest that the

marihuana plant itself has a currently accepted medical use.

Under the CSA, the rescheduling of synthetic dronabinol in a

pharmaceutical product has no effect on the scheduling of the

marihuana plant.  Thus, the petitioner's request for rescheduling

failed to raise any issue that justified the initiation of

rescheduling proceedings.

     The petitioner is also incorrect in asserting that

dronabinol was moved from Schedule I to Schedule II.  Only one

specific pharmaceutical product containing synthetic dronabinol

has been moved to Schedule II: synthetic dronabinol in sesame oil

and encapsulated in a soft gelatin capsule in a FDA-approved drug

product.  Although the petitioner now seeks to challenge the

legality of the rule rescheduling this pharmaceutical product and

argues that dronabinol should have been rescheduled in its

entirety, he did not raise these issues before DEA.  These

issues should not be considered for the first time by this court.

                            <B>ARGUMENT</B>

<B>I.   STANDARD OF REVIEW</B>

     Any interested person may submit a petition to DEA

requesting that DEA reschedule a controlled substance. 21 U.S.C.

811(a); 21 C.F.R. 1308.44(a).  However, a petition that is

accepted for filing "may be denied by the Administrator within a

reasonable time thereafter if he finds the grounds upon which the

petitioner relies are not sufficient to justify the initiation of

                                9
<HR>
proceedings."  21 C.F.R. 1308.44(c).  The Administrator relied

upon this provision in denying the petition in the instant case.

A. 18-19.

     In reviewing the Administrator's decision, findings of fact,

"if supported by substantial evidence, shall be conclusive."  21

U.S.C. 877.  Additionally, DEA's action may be set aside if it

was arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion or contrary to

law.  5 U.S.C. 706.  However, when reviewing an administrative

agency's interpretation of a statute, the court must give effect

to the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress.  Chevron

U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S.

837, 842-843 (1984).  If the statute is silent or ambiguous, the

court is to determine whether the agency's interpretation is

based upon a permissible construction of the statute.  Id. at

843.  The court may not substitute its own judgment for a

reasonable interpretation made by the administrator of an agency.

Id. at 844.

<B>II.  CONGRESS, DEA, AND THE COURTS HAVE ALL FOUND THAT
     MARIHUANA IS PROPERLY IN SCHEDULE I OF THE CSA AND MUST
     REMAIN THERE UNTIL IT SATISFIES THE CRITERIA IN 21
     U.S.C. 812(b).</B>

     Congress made the initial decision to place marihuana in

Schedule I.  21 U.S.C. 811(c).  This decision was made after

careful consideration.  The legislative history of the CSA

demonstrates that Congress was sensitive to the arguments of
