<h3> Research Activities  </h3>
Research focuses on aspects of the performance and processing of materials.
For example, current projects include:<br>
a) Developing methods for the analysis and design of structural adhesive joints.
Such methods allow engineers to predict the fracture strength of adhesive
joints under conditions of fatigue, sustained loading, and environmental attack.<br>
b) Understanding the basic mechanisms by which high-speed particles remove
coatings in the process of blast cleaning.  This research includes the 
development of models to predict the process parameters that most efficiently
remove a given coating.  Experiments are examining particles of glass, plastic
and wheat starch.<p>
<h3> Research Facilities </h3>
- gas gun and high-speed photographic facility for blast cleaning research<br>
- image analysis<br>
- full-size blast cabinet<br>
- a wide variety of load frames and accessories for mechanical testing<br>
- surface analysis equipment<p>
