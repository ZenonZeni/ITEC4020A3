(1) FBI Surveillance Capacity Request Fails to Meet Public Accountability 
    Requirements of Digital Telephony Bill

The Center for Democracy and Technology (CDT) and the Center for National 
Security Studies (CNSS), in comments filed Tuesday (1/16), argued that the
implementation of the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act 
(CALEA, a.k.a the 'Digital Telephony legislation") cannot proceed because 
the FBI has not justified its proposal for surveillance capacity, as required 
by law. 

CALEA, enacted in October of 1994, granted the FBI an unprecedented new role in 
the design of telecommunications networks to accommodate electronic surveillance. 
In order to protect against abuse, and to ensure that privacy and security are 
not compromised, Congress balanced the FBI's new authority with a detailed public 
process to ensure oversight and accountability.  Thus, CALEA also created an 
unprecedented opportunity for those concerned about privacy to have their say 
over law enforcement's surveillance ability.

CDT and CNSS argued that no funds should be appropriated by Congress or spent 
to fund the implementation of the Digital Telephony law until the FBI meets 
these public accountability requirements.

PUBLIC OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY -- FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS OF CALEA

The public accountability provisions of CALEA, which created a detailed public 
process for determining law enforcement surveillance capacity requirements, require 
the Bureau to disclose the factual basis for its recent capacity request. Without 
such data, it is impossible for the public and other interested parties to determine 
whether the proposed surveillance capacity is reasonable.

As Senator Patrick Leahy (D-VT), co-author of CALEA, emphasized during the August 
11, 1994 joint House/Senate Judiciary Committee hearing:

   "To allay public concern over the breadth of wiretapping in 
    America, the entire [compliance] process remains subject to 
    public scrutiny, oversight, and accountability. This bill 
    accomplishes this by requiring any standards or technical 
    requirements that industry adopts to ensure wiretap capability 
    be publicly available." (House/Senate Judiciary Committee Hearing 
    on CALEA, August 11, 1994, S. HRG. 103-1022, page 111)

As a result, CALEA contains several mechanisms to bring law enforcement's 
surveillance ability under public scrutiny, including the creation of a 
public process for determining law enforcement's surveillance requirements 
and a requirement that government reimburse telecommunications carriers for 
all modifications required to meet the requirements. 

These provisions were intended to allow privacy advocates and other concerned 
individuals to have a substantive voice in the compliance process.  The public
accountability provisions of CALEA are essential to ensuring that law enforcement 
and does not take actions that expand surveillance authority or jeopardize the 
privacy and security of telecommunications networks.  The comments filed by CDT, 
CNSS, EPIC, and industry associations such as the United States Telephone 
Association (USTA) and the Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association (CTIA), 
and other interested parties, are the strongest example yet of the public 
accountability mechanisms in action. 

CDT & CNSS ARGUE FBI NOTICE FAILS TO COMPLY WITH PUBLIC ACCOUNTABILITY 
PROVISIONS OF CALEA

In joint comments filed January 16, CDT and CNSS told the FBI that its 
October 16, 1995 proposal does not contain critical information necessary for 
interested parties to assess the reasonableness of the FBI's request. Among 
other things:

* The notice does not disclose the historical baseline data that the FBI   
  itself used to determine the proposed surveillance capacity 
  requirements. Without this information, it is impossible for the 
  public to determine whether the proposed surveillance levels are 
  reasonable.

* Has not disclosed certain details that CALEA itself requires to be 
  published, including the actual number of expected future 
  surveillances and the geographic locations where such capacity will be 
  necessary;

* Has not clearly defined "engineered capacity", a key term. The scope 
  of surveillance capacity available to the FBI varies greatly depending 
  on the definition of this term;

Until the FBI meets these public accountability requirements, no funds should be 
appropriated by Congress or spent to fund the implementation of the Digital 
Telephony law.

CDT stands ready to intervene as necessary before Congress, the Federal 
Communications Commission, the telecommunications industry standards bodies 
charged with setting technical standards for implementing the requirements, 
and at other points necessary to ensure that privacy is protected and the 
public accountability provisions are strictly enforced.  We will continue to 
update you on developments on this issue as they occur.
