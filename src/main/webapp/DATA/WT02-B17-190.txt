<h2>Super Solar Energy Saver Performance Contract Available</h2>

In September 1996, the Federal Energy Management Program, through
the Department of Energy's Golden Field Office, awarded the
first FEMP Super ESPC to expand renewable energy use and provide
cost savings at all Federal facilities across the United States
using solar energy. The contract represents a quantum leap in
making both alternative financing and renewable energy technology
available to Federal facilities for the purpose of saving energy
and cutting Federal utility costs. 
<P>
The award to Industrial Solar Technology (IST) Corporation of
Golden, Colorado will allow IST to supply solar energy and related
efficiency technologies to meet the needs of any and all Federal
facilities in the United States. The contracting method that is
used is the FEMP Energy Saver Performance Contract, or Super ESPC.
It provides for IST to add work onto the contract as individual
facilities identify their own needs and sign up for energy savings.
 This is the first of a new class of contracts which applies the
indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity contracting provisions
of the Federal Acquisition Regulations to the energy savings performance
contracting (ESPC) approach. This new approach allows any Federal
facility to "order energy savings" from the specific
solar and related efficiency technologies covered by the IST contract.
<P>
IST was selected based on its unique capabilities and performance
contracting experience to  provide energy and cost savings through
installation of large aperture, line-focusing, parabolic trough
solar collectors and associated energy conservation technologies.
This is the same technology that IST has been installing in Federal
and non-Federal facilities since the 1980s. It is a great way
for institutional facilities with large hot water loads such as
prisons, hospitals, barracks, and kitchens to expand the use of
renewable energy while meeting their mission-related energy needs.
<P>
Perhaps the best feature of the contract is that, like all other
ESPCs, it requires no money up front by the agency to start saving
on utility costs. The payment to the contractor will come from
the utility cost savings that the facility will see over the years
that IST will be delivering savings. Another benefit for Federal
sites wishing to use the contract is that FEMP, through the Golden
Field Office, has done the initial contracting and agencies can
quickly and simply use the contract without having to initiate
their own ESPC procurements. 
<P>
For Federal agencies it means no money up front, contracting already
done by FEMP, expanded renewable energy use, and quick energy
and cost savings.  No wonder these are called Super ESPCs!
<P>
<I>To get more information on this first Super ESPC call Industrial
Solar Technology Corporation at (303) 279-8108. For contracting
information call Beth Peterman at (303) 275-4719 or Tom Reynolds
at (303) 275-4747 of the DOE Golden Field Office. For more information
on FEMP's contracting plans for other Super ESPCs covering
other efficiency and renewable technologies contact the FEMP Help
Desk at 1-(800) DOE-EREC (363-3732). </I>
