<STRONG><CENTER>Burns: Clipper III Strikes Out</CENTER></STRONG>
<CENTER>New Clinton Computer "Wiretap" Plan Circulates With Few Changes</CENTER>

     WASHINGTON, D.C.   Montana Senator Conrad Burns today criticized 
the Clinton administration's latest computer security proposal as yet 
another government-driven mandate and urged swift passage of Burns' 
"Pro-CODE" bill, which addresses export of encryption technology and
prohibits mandatory decryption-key escrow.  Burns reacted to the 
circulation of a draft administration proposal entitled "Achieving 
Privacy, Commerce, Security and Public Safety in the Global 
Information Infrastructure."

     The proposal, dated May 10 and dubbed "Clipper III" by critics, 
moves toward the loosening and possibly eventual elimination of 
export controls on encryption technologies, but only if companies and 
individuals surrender a copy of their code keys to a government-approved 
third party.

     "It's three strikes and you're out at the old ball game, and I would 
say that the third version of the administration's Clipper Chip proposal 
is a swing and a miss," Burns said.  "It's time to quit relying on 
government mandates for what is truly a matter of great concern to 
the private sector: the expansion of commerce on the Internet and other 
computer networks.

     "The administration has been using export restrictions as a billy 
club to force American companies into accepting government control 
over the keys to their computer files and transmissions.  At least this 
new proposal admits that the current 40-bit limit on exports is outdated 
and a poor guarantee of electronic security and integrity, but it again
operates from the standpoint that the government, and not the private 
sector, knows best when it comes to key strength and control over 
those keys.

     "We can only stick our heads in the sand for so long.  It is important 
to point out that the criminals and trouble-makers who are apparently 
targets of this plan are unlikely to enroll in any key-escrow system.  
Law-abiding businesses and individuals would suffer at the hands of this 
misguided proposal.

     "While this may appear to be a compromise of the administration's 
earlier positions, we have to remember that an executive action can be 
reversed just as quickly after an election year.  It is crucial that we pass 
legislation to codify a solution to the administration's current outdated 
export policies, and to ensure that the government won't force anyone to 
give up the keys to their computers."
