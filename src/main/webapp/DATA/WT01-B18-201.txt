<B>
<H4>c. Fuel Cells</H4>
<BR>
</B>Fuel cells could represent a whole new era in transportation 
technology, and a significant advance over both internal combustion and 
battery-powered vehicles. NASA employed fuel cells in the Apollo 
spacecrafts and space shuttles; using them to power automobiles, however, 
could become their most important application. Fuel cells transform 
hydrogen and oxygen into electricity. In an automobile, a fuel cell's 
power train would consist of a storage tank that holds hydrogen or a 
hydrogen-carrying fuel such as methanol, a fuel cell system that converts 
the fuel into electricity, and an electric motor. Given their greater 
efficiency and lower operating costs, fuel cell vehicles are likely to 
have lower life-cycle costs than gasoline or battery-powered 
vehicles.<a href="#291" name="r291"> [ 291 ] </a>
<p>     Fuel-cell vehicles would have many advantages, including zero 
emissions, quiet operation, long range, and unparalleled energy 
efficiency. Fuel cells run on methanol, natural gas, or petroleum - and 
would dramatically reduce pollution and cut greenhouse gas emissions and 
energy consumption by at least half.<a href="#292" name="r292"> [ 292 ] </a>The greatest promise involves 
powering future fuel cell vehicles with solar-derived hydrogen.<a href="#293" name="r293"> [ 293 ] </a>
<p>     Three fuel cell buses have been built under the supervision of 
<B><I><A NAME="GeorgetownUniversity">Georgetown University<a></B></I> with funding from the U.S. DOE. All 
three are powered by methanol, a phosphoric-acid fuel cell made by Fuji 
Electric, and a nickel-cadmium battery available for peak-power needs, 
such as hard accelerations and climbing steep hills. Several smaller fuel 
cell vehicles are under construction as well. In late 1993, <B><I><A NAME="EnergyPartners">Energy Partners<a></B></I>, a start-up company in Florida, rolled out a fuel cell 
car running on compressed hydrogen. <B><I><A NAME="Daimler-Benz">Daimler-Benz<a> </B></I>unveiled a 
van running on a fuel cell and hydrogen in April 1994. <B><I>General 
Motors</B></I> is building a methanol fuel cell car to be completed by 
1996. In mid-1994, the U.S. DOE announced contract awards of $13.8 million 
to <B><I><A NAME="FordMotorCorporation">Ford Motor Corporation <a></B></I> and $15 million to <B><I><A NAME="ChryslerCorporation">Chrysler Corporation</a></B></I> to develop 
fuel cells for light-duty vehicles. Both intend to use hydrogen as the 
on-board fuel.<a href="#294" name="r294"> [ 294 ] </a><BR>

<p>     <B><I>The City of Palm Desert, California.</B></I> Palm Desert is 
participating in a $4.23 million-dollar multi-organization project to 
build and test eight fuel cell-powered electric vehicles during the next 
three years. These vehicles will run on hydrogen that will be produced by 
a solar photovoltaic array near Palm Desert's City Hall and a wind turbine 
north of the city. Unlike battery-powered vehicles, which may be 
associated with some air pollution from the electricity generation plants, 
these vehicles will truly have zero emissions.<a href="#295" name="r295"> [ 295 ] </a>

<P><A NAME="291"  HREF="#r291">291.</a> The cost of fuel-cell vehicles is sensitive to the type of fuel used. 
The life-cycle costs of fuel-cell cars powered by solar hydrogen may be 
somewhat greater than those of comparable gasoline cars, while fuel cells 
powered by natural gas probably would be cheapest. Sperling, D., <I>Future 
Drive: Electric Vehicles and Sustainable Transportation</I>, p. 93 
(Washington, D.C.: Island Press, 1995).<BR>
<P><A NAME="292"  HREF="#r292">292.</a> <I>Id., </I>p. 89.<BR>
<P><A NAME="293"  HREF="#r293">293.</a> Solar hydrogen is hydrogen made by electrolytically splitting water 
using solar cells. The technology is still expensive. However, Joan Ogden 
and Robert Williams of Princeton University have argued that rapid 
advances in solar technology make inexpensive solar electricity a 
possibility. They predict that the cost of solar hydrogen in the early 
years of the next century, including all distribution and retail mark-ups 
(but not taxes), could be between $2.25 and $3.25 per gasoline-equivalent 
gallon. Because fuel cells are more than twice as energy efficient as 
internal combustion engines, the relatively high cost of solar hydrogen 
is, from the vehicle user's perspective, more than halved, bringing fuel 
costs within a commercially viable range.<p>     

The ideal 
 place for producing solar hydrogen is in sunny locations such as the 
American Southwest. If all the cars and trucks in the U.S. were fueled 
with hydrogen in 2010, only 1 percent of U.S. deserts - equivalent to 
0.1 percent of the total U.S. land area - would be needed to produce 
the hydrogen. <I>Id., </I>p. 90.<BR>
