<H2>Statement from Rep. Christopher Cox</A></H2>

&quot;I hate to say I told you so.  But I did.  Today's ruling is no
suprise--the CDA[Communications Decency Act] is fraught with constitutional
problems.  The Cox-Wyden bill, passed 420-4 in the House, is the better
approach to cyberporn.  Perhaps now that he is in the Senate, my former
colleague Ron Wyden can convince a majority there to vote for it.  There is
no time to lose.
<P>
&quot;Because my kids will soon be old enough to surf the Internet on their own,
I don't want to waste the next five years in more litigation.  The Exon
approach, whatever else one may say of it, will be tied up in the courts
indefinitely.  It should be abondoned.&quot;

(On August 7, 1995, the House of Representatives voted 420-4 in support of
an amendment offered by Congressman Christopher Cox (R-Calif.) and
then-Congressman Ron Wyden (D-Ore.).  The amendment, empowering parents to
protect their children from pornography on the Internet, was attached to
the House telecommunications bill, which passed 305-117.  In the Senate,
more restrictive language was adopted criminalizing transmission of
"indecent" images via the Internet.  This Senate language, which became
part of the final law, was the subject of today's ruling in which the
Federal District Court in Philadelphia cited First Amendment concerns in
barring its implementation.)
