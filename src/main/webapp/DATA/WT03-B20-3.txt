<TITLE>Climate Change Fact Sheet 206</TITLE>
<P>
<H1>How UNEP and WMO<BR>
are responding to climate change</H1>
<HR>
<B>The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) is the "environmental 
conscience" of the United Nations System. </B>Together with the World 
Meteorological Organization (see below), it plays a leading role in the UN’s work on 
climate change. UNEP is a programme of the <A HREF = 
"fs205.html">UN General Assembly</A>. Established as a result 
of the 1972 Stockholm Conference on the Human Environment, UNEP has headquarters 
in Nairobi and regional offices and specialized units around the world. UNEP’s primary 
function is to promote environmental action and awareness by spurring others to act and 
by working through and with other organizations. The policies and activities of UNEP are 
determined by its Governing Council, which normally meets once a year. The Council’s 
decisions are implemented by the Executive Director, who heads the UNEP Secretariat. In 
the last few years, the issue of climate change has been increasingly high on the Governing 
Council’s agenda.<P>
<B>A number of units and programme activity centres within the UNEP Secretariat 
deal extensively with climate change.</B> The <B><I>Global Environment 
Monitoring System (GEMS)</B></I> links together some 25 major global monitoring 
networks. It provides a rigorous scientific basis for all of UNEP’s other activities as well 
as for the environmental management programmes of governments and of international 
agencies and institutions. GEMS concentrates on climate, transboundary pollution, 
terrestrial renewable natural resources, oceans, and environmental pollution. The 
<B><I>Global Resources Information Database (GRID) </B></I>was founded in 1985 
to make the findings of GEMS available to decision-makers. It uses geographic 
information system (GIS) and satellite image processing technology to present 
environmental data and analyses in easily-understood maps and print-outs. The<B><I> 
Information Unit on Climate Change (IUCC) </B></I>was set up in Geneva in 1991 
and also produces information on climate change for decision-makers. It provides 
presentations, fact sheets, videos, and other information services (WMO became a 
co-sponsor of the Unit in 1992).<P>
<B>The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) also plays a leading role in the 
UN’s activities on climate change.</B> A Geneva-based UN specialized agency, WMO 
is responsible for the world-wide coordination of meteorological activities. It ensures the 
provision of authoritative international scientific information on the state and behaviour of 
the global atmosphere, the climate it produces, its interaction with the oceans, and the 
resulting distribution of water resources on the earth. WMO also promotes research on 
climate change and supports a number of mainly science-oriented climate programmes and 
institutions. WMO’s fundamental policies and activities are determined by the World 
Meteorological Congress, which meets every four years. WMO’s Executive Council, 
meeting at least once a year, monitors the implementation of the Congress’s decisions by 
the WMO Secretariat and guarantees the continuity of work between the Congress’s 
meetings. <P>
<B>UNEP and WMO cooperate extensively on the climate change issue.</B> They 
joined forces for the first time in 1979 when, together with a number of other 
organizations, they convened the <A HREF = "fs213.html">First 
World Climate Conference</A>. Among other things, the Conference endorsed the 
establishment of a World Climate Programme (WCP) for monitoring global climate. In 
1991, the Congress of WMO decided that the functions of the WCP, which is under the 
joint responsibility of WMO, UNEP, and the International Council of Scientific Unions 
(ICSU), should be considerably broadened to allow it to respond to new developments.1 
In 1985, the two organizations and ICSU sponsored the <A HREF = 
"fs214.html">Villach Conference</A> on the scientific aspects 
of climate change. In 1988, UNEP and WMO jointly established <A HREF = 
"fs208.html">the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 
(IPCC)</A>. Both organizations subsequently followed and gave guidance to IPCC’s 
work. In 1990 they sponsored the <A HREF = 
"fs221.html">Second World Climate Conference</A> and set up 
an intergovernmental working group to prepare for negotiations on a framework climate 
treaty; this group’s activities were later taken over bythe Intergovernmental Negotiating 
Committee on Climate Change (INC). Both organizations stressed the continuing 
importance of IPCC and gave it a mandate for providing scientific support to INC. UNEP 
also recommended that the Preparatory Committee of <A HREF = 
"fs207.html">the United Nations Conference on Environment 
and Development (UNCED) </A>consider climate change as a priority area.2<P>
<B>The UNEP/WMO partnership will continue to be a leading force in the 
international response to the threat of climate change.</B> In 1991 the WMO 
Congress and the UNEP Governing Council reaffirmed the importance of the ongoing 
work of IPCC and INC and of the results of the Second World Climate Conference.3 The 
WMO Congress asked WMO’s Secretary-General and UNEP’s Executive Director to 
consider convening a third world climate conference at a later stage.4<P>
<B>UNEP and WMO plan to commit more of their financial and organizational 
resources to the climate change issue.</B> In 1991, the UNEP Governing Council 
asked the Executive Director to consider contributing financially towards the work of 
INC. It drew the attention of states and organizations to the special vulnerability of 
low-lying coastal and island states and commissioned the UNEP Regional Seas 
Programme to help such states build up their capacity for response measures.5  Climate 
change was included as a priority area in UNEP's Montevideo Programme for the 
Development and Periodic Review of Environmental Law.6  UNEP is also studying ways 
and means for implementing Agenda 21's  proposals to protect the atmosphere. 
Meanwhile, in 1991 WMO’s Congress reaffirmed a 1989 decision by the WMO Executive 
Council7 to establish a WMO Special Trust Fund for Climate and Atmospheric 
Environment Activities. This will be used for financing activities in 15 priority topic areas, 
most of which are directly relevant to developing countries.8 In accordance with a 
recommendation by the Second World Climate Conference, the Congress also decided to 
establish a Global Climate Observing System to coordinate and complement ongoing 
monitoring activities and to provide comprehensive information on the climate system.9 In 
its 1992 Resolution the Executive Council emphasized WMO's need for more funding for 
climate change work, and in particular urged states to contribute to the Special Trust 
Fund.10 <P>
