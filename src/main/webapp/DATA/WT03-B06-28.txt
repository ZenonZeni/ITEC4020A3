SOUTH AFRICA'S FLYING START FOR 1996

It has been an incredible start to the year. After Christmas financial
markets in Johannesburg stormed ahead as economic indicators and gold
all turned in the right direction. For many fund managers only now back
after the year-end sojourn on the Cape beaches, it's been a difficult
scenario to adjust to.

Gold, as always a key factor in the SA economy, is at least part of the
reason for optimism in financial markets. The price has been reaching
for $400 an ounce in recent weeks, which has led to a 17% gain in the
JSE All Gold index since Christmas. Within this have been some
phenomenal performances with certain shares rising more than 30%.

The reason for gold's surge is, as always, rather difficult to pin
down. Analysts have been pointing to the shortfall of new mined gold
when compared with supply for some time. The year end report published
by Gold Fields Minerals Services highlighted that demand reached a
record 3642 tons in 1995, while output was down with the SA mines'
production falling 10% to 523 tons - the lowest level in 40 years.

Not by gold alone

That there was such large hedging activity in 1995 probably held the
gold price back. With the massive forwards and option deals of the SA
producers now completed, the mood in the gold market has improved and
some analysts, mostly chartists, are talking a price well over $410 an
ounce for 1996 compared with the $380 level of 1995.

But it has not just been gold which has buoyed the market and led to
rather optimistic forecasts for the year ahead. During 1995 SA's
Reserve bank had notable success on the inflation front, with the rate
falling from 10% to under 7%. This contributed to a bull run in the
bond market in 1995, with rates falling from nearly 17% to 13.6%.

Foreign demand was in part behind the run. In 1995, foreigners were net
buyers of nearly R2bn of SA bonds on the JSE alone. This compares with
R1.2bn in 1994. While there has been some profit taking in January, the
demand has contributed to large capital inflows and strength in the
rand. The rand is currently trading at 3.62 to the dollar, which is
stronger than many analysts had forecast a year ago.

Further rand strength is not being ruled out, and there is growing
consensus that further relaxation in exchange control will take place,
possibly in the March budget. In the first quarter of 1995, the
government merged the financial and commercial rands and promised
further relaxation if capital inflows and inflation allowed. Later in
the year, asset swaps by local institutions were given the nod.

Economic data suggest the Bank will be comfortably able to relax
controls even further. The sharp R2.2bn rise in December's gold and
foreign exchange reserves - in a month normally characterised by
seasonal outflows  - has pushed cover on imports to nearly two months
compared with the Reserve Bank's three month target. Further inflows in
the next quarter should make three months cover possible.

This strong reserve position and inflation being under control suggest
that local institutions may be granted further leave to invest
offshore. Speculation is mounting that from March the Bank will allow
them to invest a proportion of their cashflows internationally.

Other signs for a more liberal new year come from recent government
statements about privatisation. While labour has responded angrily, it
appears that government is determined to sell some of the state's
assets to fund development. Deputy president Thabo Mbeki announced in
December the state's intention to sell off part of SA Airways, Telkom,
the airports company, Autonet and Transkei Airways.

Labour's response was one of anger at a lack of consultation. Protests
and work stoppages will probably slow the privatisation process. But
that it will go ahead is reasonably certain. At present the state is
looking at ways to cushion the impact on labour of privatisation.

With good economic news and booming markets, South Africa has entered
1996 in good spirits and with the prospect that the economy will move
further down the road of economic liberation to follow what has
happened on the political front in recent years.

The major blight on the landscape, however, is the violence in KwaZulu-
Natal and crime, neither of which seems much closer to resolution.

ZIMBABWE - STREET RIOTS AND FOREIGN JUNKETS

The year has begun with as much cheerful portent for Zimbabwe and its
economy as the soothsayer who told Julius Caesar to keep his eye on the
Ides of March.

Within days of each other, the country's most authoritative economic
periodicals , issued by the Standard Chartered Bank (SCB) and Anglo
American Corporation-owned First Merchant Bank (FMB), have expressed
disturbing misgivings over the country's deepening economic crisis, and
the government's apparent inability to grapple with it seriously.

A promising start to the rainy season, says SCB, may provide gdp growth
of at least 5%, if the wet weather holds out. But working against the
keenly-awaited rebound in agriculture, until now seen as the engine of
Zimbabwe's growth, are high real interest rates that are unlikely to
drop until, at best, the latter half of the year.

Whether the punitive lending rates - a bank  overdraft attracts 41% -
can be pulled down, depends on whether the government can reduce its
budget deficit in a sustained manner, instead of its current ad hoc
style, the bank says. State spending cuts are in force, with real
government expenditure set to drop 10% in the fiscal year to June 30,
but the main cuts have been in public sector investment, which, the
bank says , "is precisely the wrong solution for a country in
Zimbabwe's situation."

The cutbacks will add to 1995's "substantially lower"rate of
investment, and any recovery in the manufacturing sector, with
production running at its lowest in 11 years, is expected to be
"relatively weak"because of the deep-seated problems faced by the
sector.

The fundamental issue is the vigorous implementation of ESAP II, the
second phase of the country's IMF-designed economic reforms, following
the failure of the first, says the bank. At the top of the list is
macroeconomic stabilisation with critical reforms that include
privatisation of state-owned companies, the establishment of export
processing zones and an industrial strategy.

So far, the bank notes, there has not even been any hint of open debate
on reform - in the way that South Africa published white papers and
draft programmes - being offered by the government. FMB attacks the
issue of unemployment, and is rather less restrained in its comment
than SCB.

In the six years since 1990, when ESAP I began, 820 000 people with
four or more years secondary school behind them, have entered a job
market that has been able to find work in the formal sector for less
than 20% of them. By the year 2000, another 750 000 will have moved
through the same educational process, but by then there will be as many
of them with the same qualifications in the ages of 17 - 30 but who
have no work, as there are no formal sector jobs.

It is automatically assumed, says FMB, that the government is giving
the unemployment crisis its highest possible priority, but this hardly
appears to be the case.

If the jobless crisis had been caused by deliberate measures taken by a
foreign power, "we would consider them acts of war. But we are doing
them to ourselves,"the bank says.

Export processing zones could have been one way of absorbing some of
the surplus highly educated labour pool, says FMB. But it has taken the
government seven years to come up with legislation promulgating EPZs,
and now, it adds, implementation is being delayed yet again, this time
with the trivial issue of who is going to be on the boards to run the
zones. "We can already see signs of a potentially destructive course
being taken as the river of unemployed becomes a flood of angry,
disillusioned people,"warned FMB.

Mugabe shows no sign of sharing the concerns of the two bulletins.His
preoccupation this year is to stand in presidential elections, and in a
New Year interview with the state-controlled daily The Herald, spoke of
his vision in his imminent third term as head of state, of dramatically
enhanced industrial development and heavy state investment in
infrastructure and agriculture. And anyone hoping for a New Year mini
cabinet shuffle bearing a new minister of finance - three months after
the death of previous minister Aristson Chambati - to take charge of
the reforms desperately needed, was disappointed.

The last months of 1995 were marked by unprecented anti-government
street riots.   Deep fissures also appeared in the monolithic ruling
ZANU(PF) party as voters put an independent MP and mayor into office in
constituencies where the party's dominance was previously unquestioned.

The public perception of how Mugabe feels the situation is continual
junkets abroad with huge delegations of officials and members of his
family, and pay increases to himself and senior party members in the
order of around 130%.

ADVERTISING PROSPECTS FOR 1996: "MINDSETS WILL HAVE TO CHANGE"

At a time when new media opportunities continue to fragment the
channels of commercial communication, an alarming trend has appeared in
South African media consumption: people are reading, watching and
listening less.

This decline, in evidence over the last two or three years, poses the
greatest challenge facing advertisers as 1996 dawns.

Simply put, not only is the pie getting smaller, but what is left is
being cut into smaller slices. This makes it more complex and expensive
to reach the same audiences as before.

Newspaper circulations have shown an average decline of 7% (for the 26
leading urban dailies and weeklies between the first half of 1994 and
the same period of 1995.) But some have suffered significantly greater
losses and over a longer period of time.

Circulation of The Star, formerly the country's biggest daily, has
fallen 23% since its 1990 peak, from 235,000 to 182,000. Half the loss
was experienced in the last year.

Initially there was a hope that readership would not decline as well,
but would be compensated for by greater pass-along readership --a
common response to economic hardship. But when the readership survey
came in ti showed a 21% decline in "reading events" since 1993: the
number of times when somebody picks up a newspaper or magazine during
its issue period has fallen from 46.4 million in 1993 to 36.9 million
in 1995.

This is of critical concern to advertisers, who are attracted to
advertise in a newspaper primarily by the number of readers it can
offer.

TV viewing has also slumped, though recently the pace of the decline
has slowed. In the first half of 1995, peak-time audiences were 20%
lower than they had been two years earlier. More recently, they have
been running about 10% behind 1994's figures.

The blame for this has been placed on the South African Broadcasting
Corporation (SABC), which has converted its bias in favour of white
Afrikaners into one in favour of black Africans.

`What is clearly happening,' says Hennie van Deventer, chief executive
of the Afrikans publishing house, National Newspapers, "is that
Afrikaans people, estranged by the strange happenings at the SABC, are
turning to newspapers to provide them with the information they need."
His belief is supported by the fact that Afrikaans newspapers are among
the handful of exceptions to the general decline in circulations.

Adds Ken Owen, editor of the country's biggest newspaper, the 500 000 -
circulation Sunday Times: "It's hard to escape the suspicion that
rightwing newspapers, including the Afrikaans press, succeed because
they give dispossessed whites a voice."

The picture is more erratic in radio listening, with some stations
showing massive increases and others showing equally large losses.
Among the services previously positioned to appeal to whites, declines
of up to 42% have been recorded. In the SABC's English-language
channel, whose audience tends to be older and white, programmes and
announcers were changed to reflect the new political environment. The
audience fell from 643,000 to 373,000 in a year.

African language stations, on the other hand, have shown a slight but
not statistically significant fall. While some see this as evidence of
white racism, it is more constructive to view the issue in marketing
terms.

"Strong newspaper circulations depend on a strong sense of community,"
says Gail York, research manager at Times Media, one of the four big
newspaper groups. "The papers that appear to have held fast have a
sense of community. Those that have a vast demographic spread of
readers appear to be the ones that have suffered the most."

In addition to the Afrikaans newspapers, others whose circulations have
not declined include Business Day (serving the business community),
local community newspapers and newspapers targeted at the black
community.

Noel Coburn, joint managing director of Caxton, the leading publisher
of community newspapers, says declining circulations are attributable
to a failure to remain "relevant" to their consumers.

Numerous other factors probably play a part in the trend, including
disaffection with an unvaried diet of "bad" news (particularly crime),
a deterioration in news interest after the 1994 general election, an
end to costly circulation wars in which sales were boosted by
competitions and prizes and, of course, the proliferation of new media.

Satellite TV damp squib

A flood of new magazines and one new newspaper have been launched, 80
community radio stations have been licensed (of which 56 so far are in
operation), and new satellite TV channels have also come on stream.
(Although it must be said that the satellite TV era has thus far proved
a damp squib because of production problems at the factories
manufacturing reception equipment and decoders.)

What all this means is that advertisers are finding it harder and more
costly than ever to reach their markets. Says Chris Rainford, media
director of Bates South Africa, a leading advertising agency: "It used
to be possible to reach 60% or more of your target market through a
single TV channel. This is no longer possible."

"Previously high reach was always a given" says Gordon Muller, media
director of Saatchi & Saatchi Klerck & Barrett. "I am telling my
clients the party is over. You can no longer go on TV with an
objective of reaching 80% of your target market. Now we may set reach
objectives of 40%. With this lower level of exposure, marketers will
want their advertising to be more focused. Mindsets will have to
change."

The good news

There may be some considerable compensation, however. Economic growth
in 1996 is expected to be at least 4.5%, and given the end of the
devastating drought of the last six years could be even higher.

Advertising expenditure tends to be a highly volatile concurrent
economic indicator, and it is likely to rise even more strongly. "We
expect an excellent year"says Reg Lascaris, whose ad agency, Hunt
Lascaris TBWA, is the third biggest in the country.

MEDIA EXPLOSION IMPACTS ON BRAND NAMES

Cadbury's may not melt under an assault of Mars Bars, but SA hamburgers
have become hidden under Mac's and Pepsi is trying to float Coke out of
the market.

While SA consumers are facing an unprecedented barrage of foreign goods
coming onto the market, SA manufacturers - in particular top corporates
like SA Breweries and the Rembrandt group - are waking up to the need
to develop strong brand identities.

Advertising - the media it supports, and the companies that support
both, face challenging times in SA. Cape Town's 3-D advertising agency
notes that a media explosion, "unprecedented in history", is upon us.

Consumers are also confronted with interactive TV, electronic
newspapers, advertising disks, selective binding magazines and the
Internet.

But Raymond Perrier, of Interbrand-Sampson points out that this
plethora of information may lead some consumers to retire to the safety
of well-known brands, "for example, faced with dozens of new computers
and computer packages they may retreat to names they know well such as
IBM, instead of experimenting."

The value of brand equity

The value of brand equity, not well observed in SA, has increasingly
become more tangible - when Philip Morris bought Kraft it paid four
times the book value and when Nestle acquired Wilson Rowntree
intangible assets represented more than 80% of the purchase price. The
value of a brand lies in its expected future earnings.

Perrier suggests that part of the reason why SA's undervalue their
brands and rely on advertising agencies for branding, is because most
major corporates lack marketeers on their boards. " A top businessman I
recently spoke to here noted that more time will be spent in board
meetings discussing the position of a new plant, than how to advance
the brands it will produce."

Perrier says a brand is more than just packaging and advertising, it is
about the adoption of a corporate culture. He suggests that the success
of British Airways new branding was that it  not only looked at
advertising, it changed the tail design of aircrafts, uniforms and
retrained staff, with company policy reflecting that they had 2500
brand managers - or each staff member.

The 50 biggest global advertisers spent more than R130bn on the
promotion of their brands during 1993 - or the equivalent of almost a
third of SA's Gross National Product. The USA and Europe together spent
80% of that total. Europe has 20 of the world's top spending
advertisers, followed by Japan with 14, the USA with 13 - including top
ranked spender, Procter and Gamble (R16bn) - and South Korea with
three.

Perrier says SA has to avoid what happened in Eastern Europe when that
opened up and consumers quickly switched to more effectively branded
western goods. What SA could become, he suggests, is a country like
Singapore which serves as a springboard to the rest of Asia, and SA to
Africa.

3-D suggests that ads may become event or programme specific, or small
radio stations may - as some linked newspapers already do - group
together and sell advertising packages.

The big unknown, however, is the Internet or the World Wide Web, it
relays information to around 50m computers and in SA - one of the
fastest growing users of the net - there are an estimated 230 000
users. 3-D Agency points out that it "is the first and only unowned
medium in the world. It is uncensored (and uncensorable), totally
democratic and omni-directional. It is the fastest growing
communication medium in history."

But already major SA ad agency Hunt Lascaris is creating a division
solely to place advertising on the Internet for clients.

More South Africans are becoming computer literate, even schools in
remote areas have been funded by SA and foreign corporates who have
provided solar panels for the generation of electricity and computers
to advance skills of previously disadvantaged students.

Research completed last year by Microsoft and Market Research Africa
shows that one in four SA homes in major urban areas have personal
computers and at least a third of employees use a computer in the
workplace.  There is a strong awareness of the need to be techno-
literate, with 85% of those surveyed saying computer skills were
important to achieve educational and business success.

But it also showed that a third of South Africans are still intimidated
by computers, of whom over half were in the surprisingly young age
group of 18 to 34. Hewlett Packard has noted that South Africans are
turning over computers four times faster than any other nation in the
world at present.

What consumers need in the huge tidal wave of information swamping over
them, is brands they can hold onto.

INDIAN OCEAN STATES OUTSTRIP AFRICAN MARKETS

Indian Ocean states in the form of Mauritius, India, Pakistan and
Singapore offer far greater potential for South african trade in the
next few years than all its African markets.

Figures released by the Indian Consulate in Durban indicate that the
two-way trade in 1994 between India and South Africa accounted for
R900m (#160m), while in the first nine months of 1995 alone it had
soared to R780m.

Trade with Mauritius is expanding even more strongly, and in particular
exports from South Africa to this Indian Ocean island are soaring.
Exports to Mauritius have grown from roughly 1bn rupees in 1991 to 5bn
rupees in 1994 helped by the strong growth of the Mauritius economy,
the relatively low value of the rand and the elimination of sanctions.

This growth in exports is concentrated in the fields of iron, steel,
chemicals, foodstuffs and beverages, and is expected to continue
flourishing. Sharp rises in exports of building materials from South
Africa to the island are expected in view of the boom in hotel
construction in Mauritius. At present, however, the rapid growth in
trade between the two countries is overwhelmingly in South Africa's
favour, with exports to the Republic from Mauritius amounting to only
65m rupees in 1994.

On the other hand, cooperation in foreign tourism between the two
countries could emerge on a significant scale in view of the plans to
develop foreign cruise tourism in Eastern and Southern Africa recently
announced by the Port Management Associations of Eastern and Southern
Africa. It has been claimed that South Africa could double its world
market share of cruise vacations within two years.

Indian Ocean states like Mauritius and India are important to South
Africa because of their rapidly growing economies, and the scope they
provide for the sale of a broad spread of manufactured products which
is in contrast to the Republic's predominantly mineral exports to the
industrial countries.

FEAR AND RESENTMENT OVER SA'S INCREASED DUTY

The decision of the South African government to introduce high duty on
goods of other countries passing through it is expected to affect
multilateral trade between SA and its neighbours.

With suspicion growing in some trade circles of the Southern Africa
Development Community  (SADC) to which South Africa is the latest and
eleventh member, it is feared that the proposed 125% duty on customs
clearance will stifle fair competition and the trade efforts of other
countries.

The South African government has temporarily waived the introduction of
the custom duty to February , anticipating trade protests from some
SADC member countries who utilise its rail-road routes and seaports for
both their imports and exports.

In fact, the 125% customs duty proposal has come at a time when some
SADC member states are questioning the benefits they were deriving from
South Africa, which as they see it continues to pursue almost the same
trade practices as under the former apartheid regime.

For example, some SADC countries suspect that South Africa was
deliberately keeping them out of the Southern African Customs Union
(SACU) arrangement in order for it to continue dominating trade
benefits with Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia and Swaziland. The South
African government has denied that this was the case with its
traditional partners in the customs union.

However, South Africa's perceived intention to dominate the trade of
the sub-region is expected to draw a backlash from other SADC member
countries, more especially those with a comparatively strong industrial
base and economic potential for growth. Already Zimbabwe has threatened
to retaliate over the withdrawal of some trade concessions by its
southern neighbour.

According to trade statistics, customs duty on a number of goods and
services between Zimbabwe and South Africa has increased some 200 to
300% in the past six months.

For Zambia which has been dependent on South Africa for almost 66% of
its trade since the dawn of multiparty democracy and economic
liberalisation in 1991, the proposed rise in customs duty could be
extremely serious for the country's tottering economy.

The Zambia Association of Chambers of Commerce (ZACCI) is particularly
worried and said the bond requirement of 125% duty on customs clearance
which South Africa wants to impose on its trade neighbours would have
far-reaching effects on the general conduct of trade in the sub-region.

According to ZACCI executive director Mr Gideon Phiri, the trade
measure would have a negative effect on the embattled economy of his
country, more especially in the manufacturing, trading and agricultural
sectors.

Landlocked Zambia, which at the moment moves 45% of its cargo through
the port of Durban in South Africa, is likely to suffer the most should
the Pretoria government decide to stick to the new customs duty. Re-
routing its goods through other countries would be too costly for its
run down economy.

A top government official in the ministry of finance in Lusaka
expressed the local feeling that South Africa owed his country
compensation for the country's devastated economy because of the high
price that Zambia paid for South Africa's liberation struggle against
the former apartheid administration when South Africa's African
National Congress (ANC) operated its administrative office in Lusaka.

"We lost lives and properties to give freedom to our colleagues and is
this what we get in return?" the official asked.

This is the general feeling among various Front-line states (Zambia,
Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Angola, and Tanzania), that South Africa should
carry some responsibility for the damage their economies suffered in
supporting its liberation movement.

S A'S RUNAWAY TOURISM BOOM

Foreign tourism generated R7bn (#1.24 bn) in foreign exchange in 1994
and probably reached R9bn in 1995. The boom in foreign tourism is
expected to be sustained in 1996, and the South African Tourism Board
claims that the government is hopeful that this industry will overtake
gold mining within four years to become the biggest earner of foreign
exchange at around R20 bn a year.

This phenomenal growth in foreign tourism has already meant that the
South African hotel industry is enjoying a boom which is expected to
last for several years.

Hotel bookings for the first nine months of 1995 were more than 33% up
from 1994's figure of 7.6 m "bed nights" to more than 10 m "bed nights"
according to the latest figures from the Central Statistical
Service(CSS). The CSS figures indicate that the number of "bed nights"
sold will have broken all records for 1995.

In September 1995 alone, hotels in aggregate accommodated almost double
the number of overseas visitors compared with the same month in 1994,
with the figure up to 203 422 compared with 109 939. More than 50% of
the foreigners who visited the country over the nine month period to
September 1995 came from Europe, led by the United Kingdom and Germany,
followed by Africa with 17% and the Far East with 15%.

For 1995 as a whole the number of foreign tourists is estimated to have
increased by 45%.

The boom in the hotel industry has spread to the bed and breakfast
sector which has traditionally been an insignificant sector of the
market. This sector has now grown into an important segment of the
accommodation industry since the launch of John Read's pilot project in
Johannesburg in 1984. Guest houses have also mushroomed, some of which
focus on offering farm accommodation to tourists in various scenic
parts of the country.

Numerous new hotels are coming on stream, including the R180m Park
Hyatt hotel of Hyatt International which has been built in Rosebank,
Johannesburg, and opened in December 1995. In November 1995 the Don
Group launched a R35m expansion upgrading drive which will increase the
capacity of its executive apartment hotel chain by 10% by the end of
1996.

Sandton in Johannesburg is a particularly popular area for new hotel
developments. This is illustrated by the start of building by the
Hilton International group of a 324 roomed hotel costing R203m in the
area, while Stocks Hotels and Resorts plans to open the Sandton Square
Michael Angelo Hotel in May 1996, costing R130m. Rand Merchant Bank,
meanwhile, has indicated that it is conducting negotiations with local
and overseas  groups to build a hotel as part of its 8 hectare site in
Sandton.

In addition, Golden Tulip International, the 10th largest hotel group
in the world, has established a South African operation which aims to
develop and operate 20 hotels in the next two years, starting off with
the signing of a management contract for the R125 m Spier hotel complex
in the Western Cape, D'Owerse Werf in Stellenbosch and Sanbonani in
Mpumalanga.

The boom in foreign tourism is such that domestic travellers at this
stage comprise only a small part of hotel occupancy, and businessman
travelling between Cape Town and Johanesburg are finding it difficult
to book hotels.

Boost for Coaches

The boom is also giving a much needed boost to the bus coach
manufacturing industry in the Republic. The industry produced only 288
buses of more than 7.5 tons in 1993, 348 in 1994  and should have
manufactured roughly 400 in 1995.  Meanwhile , major airlines flying to
South Africa claim that they cannot keep up with the demand for seats.

Some analysts are claiming that, given the new hotel developments in
the pipeline, within a few years there will be a large oversupply of
hotels unless foreign tourism continues rising at around 25 % per
annum. The optimists claim that this is easily within reach.

The number of international airlines flying to Johannesburg has risen
from roughly 19 to 50 in the last two years, and foreign tourism is
going to continue benefiting from this trend. Caledonian Airlines is
planning to introduce charter flights to South Africa from March 1996 ,
while Virgin Airways of Britain has filed a series of applications to
the Civil Aviation Authority for permission to fly from London to
Johannesburg and Cape Town.

Alongside these developments South African Airways has indicated that
its partial privatisation will furnish new opportunities to market
South Africa to foreign tourists, and thereby  generate higher traffic.

Tourism industry spokesman have long expressed fears that crime
directed against both local and foreign tourists would have a
detrimental effect on the growth of the industry. However, in an effort
to address this problem tourist protection units have been established
in the major centres to try and ensure the safety of tourists. The
Durban hospitality  industry plans to train hotel and restaurant
personnel as police reservists to combat crime on the Durban
beachfront.

INDUSTRIAL TAKEOFF AHEAD FOR SALDANHA BAY

The Saldanha Bay area of the Western Cape is set to become a major
industrial complex following Iscor's decision to establish a large
steel mill in the area.  A series of downstream industrial projects are
likely to follow the building of the steel plant, which will transform
the area and furnish a boost to the Western Cape economy.

Iscor has finally given the go-ahead for the Saldanha Steel project
after securing a new site which is 2 kilometres inland of the
controversial Langebaan lagoon site, and after having reduced certain
capital costs of the project by R500 (#89m) with the total capital cost
now estimated to be R6.8bn.

Building will begin immediately and the plant will be commissioned
early in 1998, although it will take another 12 to 18 months before
full capacity of 1.25m tons of hot strip steel is reached, which will
be mainly earmarked for export markets.

The steel project, for which Iscor raised R1.3bn in a rights issue
earlier in 1995, ran aground a few months ago due to opposition from
environmentalists, who criticised the proposed siting of the plant near
to the wetlands in Saldanha.  This opposition led to delays in starting
the plant, and the higher costs of the project associated with the
delay  prompted Iscor to withdraw from the scheme.

The new arrangements.

Under the new arrangements the Industrial Development Corporation, an
equal partner in the project, has restructured the financing plans to
include a greater element of gearing so as to enhance the return to
shareholders.  The project has been further aided by special tax
concessions  by the government.

The Saldanha Steel project itself could still be expanded by doubling
the hot rolled coil capacity of the steel mill.  This has apparently
been allowed for in the layout of the plant.  In addition, businesses
related to the steel industry are now expected to be attracted to the
Saldanha area.  Angola Alpha is reported to be considering building a
cement factory at Saldanha, using the  Corex slag from the steel plant
as its major raw material.

A steel pipe manufacturing plant geared to exporting is also on the
cards since Iscor is prepared to make some of its steel output
available to local processors, and may indeed invest itself in such a
beneficiation project.  A separate stainless steel mill is also
envisaged.  It is also speculated that once the gas field at Kudu off
the Namibian coast is developed, this will create opportunities for
developing new gas-based direct reduction iron, steel and related
industries in the Saldanha area.

The Saldanha Steel project, together with the other potential new
projects, represents the largest industrial economic development phase
ever in the Western Cape, and the expansion at Saldanha could be even
greater in view of the tourist potential of the area.

SAA AIMS FOR NEW HEIGHTS

Nineteen ninety five was the kind of year SA Airways (SAA) would like
to frame. It left the bad years of having to cope with sanctions and a
moribund civil service attitude behind, moved from being a loss-making
local airline into profitability, and became a significant player on
the world stage. This year it will be looking for more partners.

These are some of the year's highlights:

* After four years of losses, which totalled R254m (#45m), it announced
at the end of its financial year on March 31 that it had shown a profit
of more than R217m for fiscal 1995. In terms of sales that made it the
35th biggest airline in the world, and the second biggest in terms of
profit sales.

* It was unable to cope fully with demand. From Germany load factors
averaged 91% for the year. They were higher between SA and Britain. To
provide more seats it bought a 767 and its fleet of 747-SPs, which were
on sale at bargain-basement prices, were taken off the market,
refurbished quickly and brought back into service.  And in November it
ordered two new Boeing 747-400s and nine new Boeing 777s.

* In the middle of December Deputy President Thabo Mbeke announced that
the government was looking for a strategic partner for SAA. That's
another way of saying the process of privatising the airline has begun,
which pleased the private sector, but angered the unions who translated
it into job losses. They retaliated by calling a number of strikes.

* Two days after the first strike SAA and Lufthansa, Europe's biggest
airline, announced a partnership agreement (which does not, at this
stage, include taking equity in each other's operation) in Frankfurt.
It will, says SA Airways' CE Mike Myburgh, boost his airline's bottom
line. He claims that without it SAA would have floundered before the
end of the century.

Looking for a strategic partner

Myburgh is pleased - upbeat may be a better word - government is
looking for a strategic partner for the airline, a partner that will
take equity.

He explains: "Without it we would not be able to attract share capital.
Government has been unwilling to increase its share capital in SAA. We
need more capital to help us balance our debt and make it easier for us
to pay for our new aircraft.

"In our present situation, where cash flows are high because our load
factors are very high, and we don't have enough aircraft to take full
advantage of our denser routes, it would be easy to finance the
purchase of those aircraft out of loans. But it would be very difficult
to do that in leaner times."

He thinks the timing of Mbeke's announcement was right. "We showed a
healthy profit last year and are likely to show another one this year,
which makes us attractive to investors. Had the decision been taken in
lean years we would have had to look for investors on their terms.

"We believe the economy will continue to grow for a few years and dip
only in 1998. A partnership will give us access to the finance,
technology  and expertise we were denied in the past."

On the question of who SAA would choose as partners, he said: "The
strong commercial alliances we have built up over the years with, for
example, American Airlines, British Midland, Ansett and very recently
Lufthansa, are important to us and we believe it would be advantageous
to us if we gave them preference.

"We would rather have another airline than a financial institution
become our strategic partner. An airline can get more out of a
relationship with another airline than it can with a financial
institution which, of necessity, would be interested mainly in the
growth of its shares and dividends. By working with another airline we
can do things together, we can build up routes together, even in lean
times, and we can use our combined equipment (aircraft) more
advantageously.

"We would probably also go to the SA market, give black investors the
inside track, and then go to the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE).

"We would, obviously, make shares available for our employees. I have
been working very hard at promoting emotional ownership of the airline
by getting staff involved in our gainshare scheme - we keep 70% of
super achievement (growth that exceeds a set target) and share the
remaining 30% among staff members. If we can offer financial ownership
as well we will improve staff commitment to the airline."

He understands why the announcement upset the unions. "It does seem as
if the government didn't consult sufficiently with them before making
their intention public. From what Cosatu (the Congress of SA Trade
Unions) has said it could lead to ongoing trouble, but if we talk to
the unions - and that's a very important item on our agenda for the
next few weeks - we can sort out the problem.

"They understood our reasoning for retrenching more than 2000 people
two years ago, why shouldn't they understand what government has in
mind now?'

SA AGRICULTURAL PROSPECTS SOAR

Both general morale in the nation and the country's economic growth
prospects for 1996 have ben materially boosted by the copious rains
experienced over large parts of South Africa since early in December
1995.

Many water restrictions introduced in numerous areas in October last
year affecting households have been lifted in line with the significant
boost to dam levels, with the Vaal Dam now 100% full for the first time
since 1989. Underground water reserves have been replenished,
irrigation dams boosted, and good grazing conditions in most areas are
guaranteed for the next nine months or so.

A few maize crops are waterloggied after the exceptionally heavy rains,
 but the overall picture is very promising, and if normal rainfall
occurs in the rest of January and February the national crop could well
exceed 10 tons compared with 4.23 tons last year.  A record crop,
however, is unlikely since this year's maize area is around 3m
hectares, which  is well below the past 10 year average of 3.5 m. This
reflects diversification on some farms towards sunflower seed,
groundnuts and wheat.

The 1995-96 wheat crop is now estimated to reach some 2.28m tons
compared with 1.83m tons in 1994-95. The country will, however, still
have to import some 360 000 tons to meet total domestic demand of about
2.4 m tons.

Meanwhile, the good rains should boost sugar output by about 25% to
2.1m tons this season, and the amount available for export should
roughly double this year. The country could have between 700 000 and
800 000 tons of sugar available for export this year compared with last
year's export yield of between

350 000 and 400 000 tons.  The sugar industry is indeed looking forward
to its best season in four years.

The agricultural sector now accounts for approximately 5% of the gross
domestic product, and since the output of the sector  could grow by
around 20% this year provided reasonable rains fall in the next month
or so, the overall economy could receive a boost of some 1% from this
source alone. Moreover, there are indirect benefits on top of this,
since  agriculture has a number of important forward and backward
linkages  in the economy. The purchase of tractors and fertilisers, for
instance, are boosted by a good agricultural season.

Some economists are therefore, predicting growth in excess of 4% for
1996, the best performance for 15 years. This in turn partly accounts
for the sharp advance in share prices on the Johannesburg Stock
Exchange during the first week of the new year.
