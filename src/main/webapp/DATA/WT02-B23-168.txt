<h2><a name="WHATIS"></a>What is LDA?</h2>

<p>LDA (formerly ACLD, the Association for Children and Adults with 
Learning Disabilities) was formed in 1964 by a group of concerned parents
on behalf of children with learning disabilities. 
LDA is the only national organization devoted to defining and 
finding solutions for the broad spectrum of learning disabilities.

<p>LDA is the largest non-profit volunteer organization advocating for
individuals with learning disabilities. LDA has 50 state affiliates and 
more than 600 local chapters in 50 states, Washington DC, and Puerto Rico.
Membership totals more than 50,000. The membership, composed of
individuals with learning disabilities, family members and concerned
professionals, advocates for the over two million students of school age
with learning disabilities and for adults affected with learning
disabilities. The state and local chapters, through their affiliation
with the National LDA, work continuously for individuals with learning
disabilities, their parents and the professionals who serve them.

<hr width="75%">

<h2><a name="GOALS"></a>What are LDA's Goals?</h2>

<ul>
<li>LDA seeks to educate individuals with learning disabilities and their
parents about the nature of the disability and inform them of their rights.
</li>

<li>LDA encourages research in neuro-physiological and psychological aspects
of learning disabilities. </li>

<li>LDA strives to create a climate of public awareness and acceptance.
</li>

<li>LDA works to improve regular and special education through advocacy
with the U.S. Department of Education and the State Departments of Education
in each state. </li>

<li>LDA develops and promotes legislative assistance. </li>

<li>LDA disseminates information widely. </li>

<li>LDA provides advocacy information and training. </li>

<li>LDA works to establish career opportunities. </li>

<li>LDA promotes education and training on learning disabilities for special
education and regular education teachers. </li>
</ul>

<p>LDA accomplishes its goals and objectives through its national 
<a href="committees.html">committees</a>
on advocacy, adult issues, education, legislation, early childhood, research,
communications/outreach. The board and committees are composed primarily
of volunteer parents and individuals with learning disabilities, but its
strength also springs from its close affiliation with professionals in
the field, including the Professional Advisory Board, which offers counsel
on professional and technical areas. Another source of strength is the <a
href="acld.html">ACLD Foundation</a>, which provides funds for
research, education, and broadening the base of public awareness in the
field of learning disabilities.

<h2><a name="SERVICES"></a>What services does LDA offer?</h2>

<p><b>LDA and Legislation</b><br>
LDA representatives testify at the request of Congress on matters
relating to special education. LDA holds and participates in numerous forums
on legal rights of individual students with learning disabilities. LDA
provides information and recommends action on pending legislation which
may affect individuals with learning disabilities and/or their families.

<p><b>LDA Information and Referral Network
<br></b>An inquiry to the local chapter, state office, or 
<a href="../Email.html">national LDA office</a> may be a critical first
step in providing help to a person with learning disabilities.

<p>LDA's unique information and referral system is the largest one of its
kind in the country serving individuals with learning disabilities. Other
organizations and agencies such as the National Center on Learning Disabilities,
the Orton Dyslexia Society, and state parent training centers refer inquiries
to the LDA nationwide network for in-depth education and support.

<p>Annually through the <a href="../conf/">International Conference</a>
and the state chapter conferences and workshops LDA provides a forum for
questions on learning disabilities and new technology and approaches for
teaching individuals with learning disabilities. Attendance at the conferences,
workshops, symposiums and support groups reaches 75,000 participants yearly.
Parents, teachers and other professionals and individuals with learning
disabilities are the participants that gather for education, networking,
and advocacy. 

<p><b>LDA and School Program Development
<br></b>LDA and its state affiliates are available to work directly with
school systems in planning and implementing programs for better services
for students with learning disabilities. LDA offers 
<a href="../conf/scholarship.html">scholarships</a>
annually to school principals for attendance to the International Conference.
This service has provided some 300 principals with an ongoing network of
information and support. In its national headquarters LDA maintains an
extensive <a href="../store/">inventory of books and materials</a>
covering every aspect of learning disabilities. These materials are ordered by
hundreds of schools, libraries and thousands of individuals with learning
disabilities. LDA publishes a journal, 
<b><i><a href="../Journal.html">Learning Disabilities: 
A Multidisciplinary Journal</a></i></b> twice a year.

<p>LDA and its state affiliates frequently work directly with school systems
in planning and implementing programs for early identification and diagnosis,
as well as remediation in resource and special education classroom situations.
Because of the relationship of learning disabilities to school drop-out
and delinquency, the <a href="committees.html#AI">Adult Issues
Committee</a>
works with educators, correctional authorities and jurists in order to
develop comprehensive approaches to education and employment.
