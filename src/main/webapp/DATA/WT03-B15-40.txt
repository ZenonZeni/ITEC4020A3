Most Amnesty groups have an action file. It usually concerns
someone who is a prisoner of conscience or perhaps a
disappeared person. The group will campaign, often for several
years, for the person's release or "reappearance". The campaign
will include letter writing, petitions, local area lobbbying and
press and media publicity in the local area.  The group
effectively adopts someone. We are working on a case in <a href="http://www.usis.usemb.se/human/mexico.htm">
<B>Mexico</B></a>. Please take a moment to read it and write an appeal letter.

<p><b>Manuel Manriquez San Agustin</b> is a musician and member of
the Otomi indigenous community of Rancheria Piedra Blanca,
Tutotepec in the State of Hidalgo.  He was arbitrarily arrested
without warrant by the PJDF in Mexico City on 2 June 1990.  Like
many Indian defendants in Mexico, he was allegedly detained
because of his ethnic and economic background, which the police
interpreted as precluding his access to lawyers or complaints
mechanisms.  Manuel Manriquez, who did not speak nor write
Spanish at the time remained incommunicado for four days under
police custody and was brutally tortured with beatings; near
asphyxiation with plastic bags over his head; carbonated water
with chilli forced into his nose (a method known as tehuacanazo,
which takes it's name from a popular brand of mineral water)
burns, and electric shocks to sensitive parts of his body and
was forced to "sign" papers he could not understand. 

<p>He was accused of murder and brought before a judge who, based on the defendant's "signed confession" remanded Manuel Manriquez San
Agustin to the Reclusorio Preventivo Norte on charges of murder.
 Despite the illegality of his detention, the clear signs of
torture - which were later certified by a prison doctor - and the
lack of evidence other than his signed statements without an
interpreter to support the charges   was sentenced in July 1991
to 24 years imprisonment.  The sentence was confirmed on appeal
on February 1992, despite lack of any further evidence. 

<p>His case was also presented before the National Human Rights
Commission (CNDH) which has issued a statement on his behalf
acknowledging his torture, to no avail.  Since his arrest....
has learnt to speak and read Spanish and, in September 1991,
co-founded a human rights organisation with other indigenous
prisoners: the <i>Comision de Defensa Campesina e Indigena del
Comite Ricardo Lopez Juarez</i>, which has actively campaigned
on behalf of the rights of Indians and peasants imprisoned in
the Reclusorio Preventivo Norte and other prisons in Mexico.

<p>Manuel Manriquez has become increasingly involved in campaigning
for an end to torture and other human rights violations in
Mexico. For example, on the first of April 1993 he joined a
hunger strike carried out in several Mexican prisons by more
than 50 prisoners.  The inmates were calling for an end to
torture and for fair and prompt trials in the Mexican criminal
justice system. 

<p>In March 1994 a recurso de amparo was presented on his behalf, before the Supreme Court of Justice of the Federal District in order to contest the legality of his sentence.  It was rejected in September 1994 and his sentence was confirmed.

<p>At the end of July 1994 Manuel Manriquez began his fourth hunger strike since imprisonment, calling for the release of scores of those reportedly under false charges in Mexican prisons and, in desperation at the repeated lack of effective response from the authorities, on 15 August 1994 he stitched his lips in protest and began a dry hunger strike refusing to take any liquids or solid foods for over a week.  He
gave up his hunger strike on 23 august and was transferred to
hospital where he received medical attention. 

<p>In October 1994 Manuel Manriquez solicitor submitted another recurso de amparo on his behalf, which by September 1995 had not been
responded to by the courts. 

<p> On 11 November 1994 Manuel Manriquez was transferred, without any previous warning, from the prison in Mexico City.  His transferral took place in the late hours of the night and he was deprived of his personal belongings. It was reportedly carried out in response to his
peaceful activism on behalf of prisoners' human rights .  He was
held incommunicado for four days before being allowed to see his
solicitor. In January 1995 he was interviewed in prison by an
Amnesty International delegate, who had visited him twice before
in 1992 and 1993. Amnesty International, who considers Manuel
Manriquez San Agustin to be a prisoner of conscience, continues
to call for his immediate and unconditional release.
