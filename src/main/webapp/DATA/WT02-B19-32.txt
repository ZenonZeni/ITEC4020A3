Colour images from a greyscale camera

<H1>Colour from Greyscale</H1>
I bought myself a Connectix QuickCam at the start of 1995. For those
who don't know them, they are a 320x240 4 bit greyscale camera. They
come with software to run them on a Macintosh. Using this software,
you can take grey scale still photos, or produce Quicktime movies.
<P>
With a little extra ingenuity, you can also use your quickcam to make
full colour images. These are some I've done:

This was my first really successful attempt at creating a colour image.
It was created using the program that first got me going
with this game. It's a little thing called cambot, which came on a
CD that I got for registering my camera. Basically, it's got three
buttons, red green and blue, which you click while holding
a filter of that colour in front of the lens of the camera.
<P>
Sadly, this method limited me to the small window size shown, so I
felt the need to branch out. I've now started capturing 320x240 images
direct from the camera, and then combining them over on a Unix machine.
This gives me results like these:
<P>
<A HREF=lab.colour><IMG SRC=lab.colour.jpg></A>
<A HREF=desk><IMG SRC=window.gif></A>
<P>
I'm still working on getting realistic colour balance in the images, but
these at least have fairly good white point.
<P>
<h2>In case you're interested,</h2> the filters I'm using at the moment are made
from cellophane, bought for $1 a sheet from the local newsagent. In order
to get reasonable colour balance, I'm using 1 layer of red to 2 green and
4 blue. <I>Sigh</I>, why isn't cellophane made in standard filter densities? :)
<P>
I'm combining the images using xv on a unix workstation. Basically, I'm
first applying a gamma correction to the greyscale images, then colourising
them to have the white be a fully saturated red, green or blue (whichever).
Then using the pad function to combine two images at 50% each, and then
combining that image with the third at 33%. That leaves me with an RGB image,
with 24 bits per pixel, with the actual image data in the least
significant 4 bits of
each byte (due to the way pad works). Needless to say, this makes for
rather dark images, so I then increase the brightness to compensate, and fiddle
with the colour balance if I really feel I need to.
<P>
There are noticable colour artifacts in both of these images.  The
yellowy patches in the top image are from the bad blue filter in my first
filter set. The four layers are all loose and wrinkled , and so
transmission is patchy due to reflection.
The magenta blotch in the bottom left corner of the window shot is due to there
being a little bit of masking tape in the bottom corner of the green filter
in my new filter set. Overall, the new set gives better image definition,
so I think I'll stick with it, and I'll just have to be a little more careful.
I'm also on the lookout for a denser blue cellophane. Maybe I should try my
incandescent light photographic filter?
<P>
<A HREF=http://honeybee.biz.usyd.edu.au/www/james/colourCAM/>James</A>
is doing the same thing with some bits of my cellophane, and Adobe Photoshop.
(James has more fun software than me :( ).
<P>
My next plan is to write some software to automate some of this combination,
and also to allow me to interleave four images to make one 640x480 image. Then
we'll really be cooking with gas! (I know this doesn't actually make any
sense from a signal processing standpoint, but I suspect it will produce
reasonable images anyway).
