System Alerts
Drowsy Drivers

In what has been billed as a first of its kind effort, scientists
at the Carnegie Mellon Research Institute (CMRI, 5000 Forbes Ave.,
Pittsburgh, PA 15213) are developing a comprehensive sensor system
to combat drowsy driving.

The project, which got underway in June 1995, is supported by a
two-year, $1.2 million contract from the National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration (NHTSA, Washington, DC) and will be completed
by mid-1997.  Some additional engineering support is being provided
by the Volvo/GM Heavy Truck Div. The National Private Truck Council
(Alexandria, VA) assisted in selecting the test vehicles.

The NHTSA is supporting a program to combat drowsy driving, with
particular emphasis on heavy trucks because of the severe damage
these accidents cause, and the toll in human lives they extract.
Over the years, surveys have shown that drowsiness, related fatigue
and inattention are the major causes of truck driver fatalities.

Since mid-1995, CMRI scientists have been assessing, testing and
developing effective drowsy driver sensor technologies.  At the end
of the project they hope to have available a set of functional
specifications for drowsy driver alert systems that can be
manufactured for use, first in trucks, and later in cars.

Richard Grace (Tel: 412/268-3493) of the CMRI Advanced Devices and
Materials Group, and project co-director, said this is a two phase
effort.  Phase I, now in progress, involves selection of sensors,
systems engineering and reliability testing and finally,
installation in the selected test vehicles.  Two physical
prototypes are being produced, and will, of course, be subject to
further modification depending upon the outcome of testing.

Phase II, starting in June and running until mid-1997, will consist
of data collection under actual over-the-road conditions and
relating this information to previously developed drowsiness
measurements.

Grace said the prototype system will be comprised of a black box
installed next to the driver's seat, a sensor on the steering
column, two video cameras (one to scan the driver's face along with
a video recorder to capture reactions and another pointed out the
window), a floor-mounted accelerometer, a powerful on-board
computer to store test data, and an audio warning device possibly
dashboard-mounted.

There also will be a video-based lane position sensor with a
Pentium processor.  This is the same unit that was developed by
Carnegie Mellon's Robotics Lab, and which was featured prominently
in last year's "No Hands Across America" trial (ATTN, September
1995).

These modules will communicate with each other through an Echelon
(Palo Alto, CA) LanWorks communications bus.  The several modules,
while being designed as stand-alone systems, will interact with one
another as a distributed control system.

The three main units will "decide" if the driver is drowsy, and
then relay this information to an independent warning system,
possibly an audio device that will alert the driver.  Grace noted
that the system modules are basically simple, inexpensive to
produce and could have multiple uses in the truck.

In June, with all component testing completed, the system will be
installed in two tractor trailers supplied by Averitt Express
(Cookeville, TN).  Averitt specializes in package delivery with
many of its runs taking place between midnight and 8:00 AM.  The
test vehicles will be based at the company's Charlotte, NC
terminal.

In this second phase, the sensor system's ability to alert or even
rouse drivers will be thoroughly evaluated.  As part of the
process, a camera will document lane departures, and steering
column sensors will document erratic or jerky movements.  This
information will be correlated with data obtained from the
physiological and psychological measures that relate to the
driver's state of alertness, e.g., eye movement and eye closing.

Grace added that researchers developed drowsiness "standards"
through videotapes of drivers' eyes.  In other words, the
percentage of time they are open or closed.  For example, when
someone is sleepy, normal blinks which last about a millisecond,
are extended and a person can unknowingly end up with eyes closed
about 15% of the time. Kind of scary when driving a 16-wheeler
along a crowded interstate at maximum speed.

MLANS Could
Prevent Accidents

Nichols Research Corp. (NRC, 251 Edgewater Dr., Wakefield, MA
02146) is working with a technology that could provide computer
solutions to complicated problems not likely to be solved by past
artificial intelligence approaches.

The Maximum Likelihood Adaptive Neural System (MLANS), was
originally funded by the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization
(BMDO - 7100 Defense Pentagon, Washington, DC 20301-7100) for "Star
Wars" space-based uses.  Actual work started some seven years ago
when BMDO was looking for a way to automatically recognize targets
in clutter and noise.

NRC is currently developing a number of system applications based
on this technology.  Of primary interest to the ITS universe is the
work being done on MLANS-based collision avoidance systems and
computer-assisted road navigation systems.  These were demonstrated
during a recent test of unmanned Army vehicles.

MLANS analyzes sensor data streams and adaptively classifies and
tracks objects of interest while suppressing clutter and noise.
The system used supplied object models and adapted them to changing
environments, or adaptively constructed statistical models of what
objects looked like, then refined the models as it sorted through
the stream of image data being received.  The recent tests
demonstrated the feasibility of road tracking on dirt, gravel and
paved surfaces as well as areas that were shaded and leaf covered.

According to Leonid Perlovsky (Tel: 617/246-4200), NRC's chief
scientist, the unmanned navigation vehicle technology has not as
yet been tested under actual highway conditions.  He noted that his
company's efforts are still in the development stage and any
commercial offerings are still some years away.  Perlovsky also
said this point can't be reached without significant investment and
at present, there is no way of knowing what kinds of dollars will
be required.

In taking a closer look at the technology involved, neural networks
are computer systems that can recognize an object by "learning"
from previous experiences or input.  Their design uses the
principle of brain organization--a large number of interconnected
processing elements called neurons.  Neural networks are attractive
because they can be created without the lengthy and tedious process
of eliciting rules from human experts and then coding them into a
computer.

The MLANS, as developed by NRC, solves the long-standing artificial
intelligence problem of combining adaptive learning with prior
knowledge by using a priori models in a neural architecture.  With
fuzzy logic, each piece of data is associated with the appropriate
a priori model.

MLANS has been coded in a variety of programming languages,
including FORTRAN and C, and runs on any number of systems,
including personal computers.

In addition to ITS applications, MLANS-based systems have potential
uses for law enforcement agencies and can also be used for medical
diagnostics, oil exploration, or for locating objects under foliage
and in heavy clutter.

Perlovsky cited the development, for NASA research and rescue
operations, of an MLANS-based detection algorithm to find small
aircraft that might have crashed in heavily wooded areas.

Military Technology
Makes Smart Trailers

Military communications technology originally designed to "get the
message through" in spite of jamming and other battlefield signal
interference will soon be used to locate and track trailers on
America's highways.

QUALCOMM Inc., (6455 Lusk Blvd., San Diego, CA 92121; Tel: 619/587-
1121) has signed an exclusive development and supply contract with
Elisra Electronic Systems Ltd. (29 Hamerkava St., Holon, Israel),
a subsidiary of Tadiran Ltd. (575 Lexington Ave., 21st Fl., New
York, NY 10022; Tel: 212/751-3600), for communications hardware for
Untethered TrailerTRACS, QUALCOMM's new trailer tracking system.
The "TRACS" stands for Thin Route (low data rate) Alpha Numeric
Communications System.

The agreement also gives QUALCOMM exclusive resale rights in this
country for trailer tracking applications with rights to extend
worldwide and to include other specific markets such as barges and
trains.

According to Jim Clifford, QUALCOMM OmniTRACS Div. director of new
product development, this is representative of Elisra's efforts to
introduce, into the commercial marketplace, technology originally
developed for military applications.

Untethered TrailerTRACS itself should be commercially available
during the fourth quarter this year. Standard price for a single
trailer system is expected to be $790.  The basic monitoring rate
will be about $10/unit/month.

Clifford said prototypes are now being tested and evaluated, and
one goal will be the ability to track a trailer within 1500 ft.  He
also noted that an optional GPS capability will be available to
track within 300 ft.  Designed to QUALCOMM's specifications, the
unit is about the size of a book and measures 8 in. by 4.9 in. x
2.4 in.  Enclosed in an ABS case, it can operate within a
temperature range of -40(C to +70(C.

The unit is battery powered.  When the tractor and trailer are
paired, it works off the tractor's 12v electrical system.  When
unhooked, the battery takes over.  It can be recharged from the
truck when the trailer is connected and has a 35-45 day life span
while disconnected.  The system also offers battery condition and
present charge-level monitoring.

The unit can be mounted inside a trailer wall.  Separate
omnidirectional antenna packages offer the option of mounting
either high on the "nose" of the trailer, or flat on the roof.  The
roof mounting requires approximately a half-inch clearance.

Untethered TrailerTRACS will provide two-way messaging and position
determination of any trailer while connected to or disconnected
from the tractor.  Using Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite service
from ORBCOMM (21700 Atlantic Blvd., Dulles, VA 20166; Tel: 703/406-
5310) which provides global coverage.  The OmniTRACS Division is a
reseller of ORBCOMM services to the trucking industry.

Initial service using two satellites will be "intermittent," with
three to four satellite looks per day at any point on the earth.
Near continuous coverage is expected in 1997 when ORBCOMM is
scheduled to launch an additional 24 satellites. Clifford noted
that this system essentially takes the intelligence that now
resides in the tractor and puts it in the trailer.  He explained
that Untethered TrailerTRACS offers exception-based messaging.

For example, an itinerary can be stored in the trailer unit.
Information might include appointment times, specific destinations,
layover time, trucking company involved, tractor number, or
whatever.  If the trip goes according to plan, no messages will be
sent.  If there is a delay, the unit can recalculate and if an on
time or near-on time arrival is indicated, there still won't be any
messages.

However, if a trailer didn't move when expected, or an unplanned
move took place, or the wrong trailer is connected or disconnected
to a tractor or a trailer is late for an intermodal drop, an
exception alert is triggered.

This information is sent immediately to the OmniTRACS Network
Management Center (NMC) in San Diego (CA) and then routed to the
customer for action. The center is staffed around-the-clock every
day.  And there also is a back-up center in Las Vegas (NV).

Clifford pointed out an additional feature of the system:
refrigeration system monitoring.  On an exception basis, reefer
data is sent over-the-air to alert users to an immediate problem,
e.g., wrong set point, refrigeration unit failure, unloaded reefer
running, or temperature out of range.  Wherever possible,
corrections can be made remotely, or help can be summoned.

QUALCOMM develops, manufactures, markets, licenses and operates
advanced communications systems and products based on its
proprietary digital wireless technology.

Elisra  is known for its electronic warfare systems and develops,
manufactures and markets advanced electronics products, including
sophisticated jammers, RF and microwave components, ELINT systems
and data links

Amtech to Track
Grocery Chain Fleet

Last month, Amtech Systems Corp. (17304 Preston Rd., Bldg. E100,
Dallas, TX 75252-5613) signed a $310,000 contract with H.E.B (San
Antonio, TX), the nation's 13th largest grocery store chain, to
supply a wireless system for paperless, non-stop identification of
its motor freight fleet.  Beverly Fuortes (Tel: 214/733-6059),
Amtech's director of corporate development, said the system is now
being installed and should be fully operational in March.

The wireless system will use Radio Frequency Identification (RFID)
technology to provide real-time information on the 1,500 tractors
and trailers in the H.E.B. fleet.  Equipment will be deployed at
terminal gates at the grocery chain's 262 stores throughout the
southwest.  H.E.B. will use the Amtech system to improve equipment
and inventory accuracy, as well as to eliminate paperwork and
increase employee productivity by automating the vehicle tracking
procedure at terminals.

With Amtech's SmartPass readers in place at terminal exit and entry
points, all motor fleet equipment with an RFID tag will be
identified immediately, even at unmanned terminals.  The grocery
store chain will use the Amtech system, in conjunction with its
existing system, to gather information and match it with fleet
information in the company's database.

With this real-time data in hand, H.E.B. will be able to monitor
operations, increase tracking capabilities and improve asset
management - all through wireless data communications.

Clinton Inks 1996
Transportation Bills

The fiscal year 1996 Dept. of Transportation (DOT) appropriations
bill was signed late last year by President Clinton.  The bill
includes $223 million for federal aid to ITS projects, down about
$4.5 million from $227.5 million last year.  The DOT can now
proceed with development of a plan to reorganize its surface
transportation activities.

Also part of the bill is a $17.5 billion obligation ceiling for
highways which represents a $300 million increase over present
levels.  Another $2.3 billion will be available for emergency
relief and minimum allocation programs, bringing the total for
highways to $19.9 billion, only $545 million below the Intermodal
Surface Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA) authorized level.

Generally speaking, the transportation budget was up by $1.8
billion over 1995's $35.58 billion.  But transit funding was cut by
$600 million from 1995 levels, and includes $2 billion for formula
grants and $1.6 billion for discretionary grants.  Transit
operating assistance was cut by $310 million to a level of $400
million.

According to ITS America, congress will give serious consideration
to dropping the practice of earmarking funds for ITS in next year's
bill.

Funding (in millions) breaks out as follows: $24.5 for R&D, $32.5
for operational tests, $14.5 for Commercial Vehicle Operations
(CVO), $14.0 for Automated Highway Systems (AHS), $11.3 for program
and system support, and $13.0 for crash avoidance research, for a
total of $109.8 million.

At the same time, the president signed into law the National
Highway Systems (NHS) bill.  This legislation designates a national
system of primary highways and bridges, some 160,000 miles worth,
considered essential to the country's economy and defense.

Among the bill's provisions are the controversial repeal of the 55
mph speed limit and a repeal of funding penalties for states that
fail to enact motorcycle helmet laws.  It also delays indefinitely
any federal mandates to use signs with metric measurements, and
waives until 2000, federal requirements that states convert their
plans and specifications to metric.

Fare Hikes Become
Nationwide Trend

According to a report recently released by the American Public
Transit Association, (APTA, 1201 New York Ave. NW, Washington, DC
20005; Tel: 202/898-4115), four out of 10 of this country's public
transit systems will raise passenger fares and cut back service
during 1995, mostly as a result of reductions in federal transit
aid.

APTA said a survey of 157 transit agencies showed that fare
increases during the year will average 25% and that a typical
service reduction will represent 11% of existing bus and train
service.  More than three-quarters of the responding agencies said
state and local governments are not likely to replace the lost
federal funds.

The cuts will hit hardest at lines serving small and rural areas.
For example, an urban transit system might raise fares about 20%
and a medium area about 23%.  However, small/rural area riders
could be looking at a 34% increase.  The same impact ratios prevail
in the other categories.

Transit agencies attributed about three-quarters of the fare hikes
and service cuts to past and pending reductions in federal transit
operating assistance.  In the federal fiscal year just ended,
operating grants were reduced by 11.5%, and legislation pending in
Congress could cut remaining funds by another 44% in FY 1996.  In
total, federal operating assistance will be cut in half, from $802
million in Fiscal Year 1994 to $400 million. Of the responding
agencies, 36% plan to delay expansion and 40% could cut service and
raise fares.

Recent fare increases implemented by New York City's Metropolitan
Transit Authority (MTA) are a case in point.  Not only will they
apply to subways and busses, but later in 1996, to bridges and
tunnels as well. Over the past 13 years, the MTA has spent $20
billion to rebuild and modernize its system, especially the
subways.  The results are bearing fruit and have drawn wide praise
from many of its millions of daily riders.

With state and federal subsidies being cut substantially, the MTA
has had to raise bus and subway fares by 20% from $1.25 to $1.50,
and commuter rail fares on average by 9%, making these rates among
the highest in the country. Beyond that, there is the threat of
reduced service, fewer improvements and less attention paid to
maintenance and passenger comfort.  Not a pretty picture overall.

In looking at the prospect of higher fares, one individual
concluded that even with a 20% increase, the subway still was still
a better deal than having to drive, put up with traffic and having
to pay even higher parking fees.

In light of all this, late last month, President Clinton signed
into law H.R. 2002, the Fiscal year 1996 appropriations bill for
the Dept. of Transportation (DOT).  The law cuts federal transit
aid 12.2% overall in contrast with 1995, and includes reductions of
48% in operating grants for transit agencies serving metro areas of
200,000 or greater.  Smaller systems will experience a 25% cut.

Neural Network
to Control Traffic

Nestor, Inc. (Providence, RI) and Matrix Corp. (1203 New Hope Rd.,
Raleigh, NC 27610-1474; Tel: 919/231-8000) are working with Jet
Propulsion Lab at the California Institute of Technology (JPL,
Pasadena, CA) to develop VideoTrac, an advanced traffic
surveillance system.  This effort is being administered by JPL for
the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA, Washington, DC).

According to Matrix and JPL, VideoTrac "will increase traffic
capacity on existing roads and reduce the need for new highway
construction."  Delivery of the system is expected sometime during
the fourth quarter this year.

VideoTrac will use video cameras, Matrix's Advanced Traffic
Controller (SmartATC) and Nestor's Ni1000 Recognition Accelerator
chips to recognize moving vehicles on highways and intersections.
The Ni1000 neural network chip, developed jointly by Nestor and
Intel, is at the heart of the system.  Matrix will incorporate the
chip into a compact, low cost module that will plug into advanced
traffic controllers like the Caltrans 2070 or TS3.

The system can control traffic signals, notify drivers of traffic
conditions and redirect traffic.  Unlike systems that use sensors
buried under the roadway, VideoTrac will be able to recognize
vehicles by type (car, truck, bus, motorcycle), monitor speeds,
turn and lane switching movements, travel times, and even report
accidents.

The chip simultaneously performs these functions at full-motion
video speeds across multiple lanes.  It will "see" the number of
cars heading its way and know the speed of each.  At an
intersection, a traffic control device could decide whether to
extend a green light or stop traffic because a line of vehicles is
waiting in the intersection.

David Mosier, Matrix president and CEO, said, "There are
approximately 250,000 intersections in the U.S. that would
potentially benefit from video detection technology, as well as
tens of thousands of highway locations."

Nestor, by the way, develops and markets business information
systems that extract actionable knowledge from data through pattern
recognition.  Among the company's offerings are N'Route software
that reads and distributes faxes electronically, NestorReader and
OmniTools, intelligent character recognition software, and PRISM
for identifying fraudulent bankcard transactions from subtle
patterns of purchasing behavior.  Next stop: the Interstate.

GDS Partners with
Israel's MAVIX

Graphic Data Systems Corp. (GDS, 6200 S. Syracuse Way, Suite 250,
Englewood, CO 80111; Tel: 303/741-8484) has established an alliance
with MAVIX Ltd. (Haifa, Israel).  Both entities hope to create an
interface between their respective technologies.

 MAVIX provides remote intelligence surveillance monitoring and
control systems for the transportation and security industries with
an emphasis on Automatic Traffic Management Systems (ATMS).  GDS
offers real-time Geographic Information System (GIS) solutions for
ATMS, traffic operations centers, transit information, vehicle
permitting and routing, and Intermodal Surface Transportation
Efficiency (ISTEA) management.

A GDS spokesperson said his company and MAVIX are currently working
on three joint traffic system proposals but nothing is ready to
announce at this time.

MAVIX's monitoring and control systems include color cameras with
pan, tilt and zoom remote control, vehicle loop detectors, ramp
metering devices, variable message signs, audio devices and traffic
signal monitoring devices. Signals from these devices are
transmitted via bi-directional connectivity to traffic control
centers to provide real-time, full-motion visual monitoring of
traffic conditions, as well as voice connection with traffic
control personnel and roadway SOS locations.

As a result of this partnership, traffic information processed by
the MAVIX system can now be reviewed in real-time as color coded
maps on the GDS GIS-based software system.  Maps will display the
current locations of objects, events and their relationships, as
well as current traffic conditions at any given moment.  Traffic
control operators will be able to analyze and respond immediately
to changing conditions and incidents as they happen.

Both companies look on this partnership as a way to build open
systems that "are never closed to future options but allow for
expansion of capacity and functionality in an efficient, resilient
manner."

Ford and China
Look at 'Good Earth'

Ford Motor Co. (The American Road, Dearborn, MI 48121; Tel:
313/337-2456) and researchers from the Peoples Republic of China
(PRC) have joined in a cooperative effort to develop catalytic
converters using rare earth metals for vehicle emission control.
The three-year cooperative catalyst research program got underway
at the end of last year, and will receive more than $1.5 million in
funding support from Ford and several Chinese government
organizations.

China has the largest proven reserves of these metals which can be
used in catalytic converters to cut vehicle emissions of
hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxides and carbon monoxide.  The country
recently adopted legal guidelines for auto emissions which ban
production, sale or import of cars that exceed established
pollution levels.  The joint research effort will also investigate
environmental solutions to help mitigate China's rampant air
pollution problems.

John McTague, Ford VP of technical affairs, said, "Rare earth
oxides, alone or possibly with the addition of small amounts of
precious metals, could create a robust emission control catalyst
that China can produce for its own market or for potential export."

Rare earth oxides, in particular cerium and lanthanum, combine with
other metals to improve the performance of an automotive emissions
catalyst.  During changes in driving speed and fuel mixture, the
rare earth oxides can either store or release oxygen into the
exhaust mixture and keep the catalyst performing under more
constant conditions and at a high level.

These oxides can also help in cold-start emissions control.  When
the catalyst is cold during the first few minutes of operation, it
operates inefficiently, so much so that it is during this period
that the majority of hydrocarbons are emitted.  If the catalyst
could be moved closer to the engine and be able to withstand the
higher operating temperatures, it could warm up more quickly and
reduce cold start emissions.

With a new emphasis on stricter emission standards by government
regulatory agencies, research interest in rare earth oxides has
increased.  The Chinese are looking to use these oxides as a major
component of catalytic converters for their domestically-
manufactured vehicles, while minimizing the use of precious metals,
e.g., platinum, palladium and rhodium.

$7 Billion Future for
OEM Safety Markets

A study just released by Business Communications Co. (BCC, 25 Van
Zant St., Norwalk, CT 06855-1781; Tel: 203/853-4266), explores
current markets and future business opportunities for OEM
automotive safety electronics in light vehicles assembled in this
country and Canada.

According to the study, "the average safety electronics content now
stands at $329 per vehicle, and is equivalent to 1.7% of the total
value of the average light vehicle produced in North America."  The
report goes on to predict that over the next five years, sales of
automotive safety electronics are expected to increase 8.6% per
year, reaching $7.19 billion by the year 2000.

By then, the average automotive safety electronics content is
expected to reach $485, equivalent to 2.0% of the total average
vehicle value. The future will continue to brighten as the public
begins asking for more safety features and the automobile
manufacturers begin meeting this demand with new and better
technological approaches.

The study declares that "the next five years will witness the near
universal adoption of ABS and driver- and passenger-side airbags.
Four-wheel ABS will also largely supplant two-wheel systems during
this period.  Rapid growth in side-impact and other airbags will
present strong business opportunities as will Traction Control
Systems (TCS)."  Other growth areas involve production of anti-
theft devices and collision avoidance systems.

The report calls attention to changes in the safety electronics
market.   These include lean manufacturing, just-in-time inventory
management, outsourcing, supplier consolidation, greater design and
engineering responsibility given to suppliers, and increasingly
sophisticated systems as more advanced electronic features are
added to vehicles.

With this in mind, the study goes on to say that the next five
years will see more supplier consolidation among the automobile
companies, increased electronics content and expanded supplier
responsibilities.  "This will, however, provide unique business
opportunities for those suppliers able to adapt to the new
environment," the report concludes.

Available from BCC for $2750, the report covers such technologies
as air bags and related passenger restraint systems, ABS, collision
avoidance and warning systems, electronic traction control, anti-
theft devices, and other safety electronics.  It also covers in
detail the socio-political, economic, regulatory and technological
issues that are regarded as critical to the industry's current
state of change.

Etak Realigns
Product Lines

Etak, Inc. (1430 O'Brien Dr., Menlo Park, CA 94025; Tel: 415/328-
3825) has realigned two product groups through a merger of its
Information Group, which focused on product marketing development
and sales, with its Commercial Solutions division.  The company
said this will allow it to take advantage of the fast-growing
market for highly detailed, accurate, electronic road maps and
business demographic data.

Last year, Etak created business units to better focus on the needs
of the particular markets it serves.  It found considerable
crossover development between the Information Group, which
specialized in geographical marketing products, and the Commercial
Solutions group which was involved with operations such as
facilities management, routing and scheduling, fleet management,
property risk and call-before-you-dig applications.

Since the Information Group's geographical marketing products were
also of interest to commercial customers, it made sense to
consolidate the groups, according to an Etak official.

Products previously sold thorough the Information Group in
Princeton, NJ, and now under the Commercial Solutions umbrella
include TargetView, a Microsoft Windows-based geographical
marketing system that combines Etak's digital street maps with
locations of more than nine million businesses and 85 million
households nationwide; PostalPoints, a database of Postal Service
ZIP+4 code locations, and Eagle Geocoding services which allow
rapid matching of addresses to map locations.

Key customers who use the marketing-related products include Acxiom
Corp. and Database America Companies, developers of a number of
business and industry data products. Etak's other marketing
groupings are the Automotive Products division offering digital map
and navigation software products for vehicle navigation and
information systems, and the ITS Group, offering technology and
market development strategies to the ITS market that includes major
mass transit facilities.

Intermodal EV
Trials to Continue

The National Station Car Assn. (963 Hillcroft Circle, Oakland, CA
94610) intends to "charge ahead."  According to Victoria Nerenberg,
the organization's president, "The momentum built in the National
Station Car Program is so strong that it will continue despite
changes in any of the Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) mandates."

She was referring to California's recent decision to back away from
a requirement that within two years 2% of all cars sold in the
state be electric powered.  The state's Air Resources Board asked
for a suspension of this requirement, and a final decision has yet
to be made.  There also were claims of automobile industry pressure
on state officials to make the change.  Both Massachusetts and New
York followed California with similar mandates, and a Federal
appeals court in New York recently upheld that state's right to
proceed with the California plan.  No word on Massachusetts.

(Earlier this month, General Motors announced that this fall it
would be selling an electric car, the EV1, in Los Angeles, San
Diego, Phoenix and Tucson.  A GM official said there was no
incongruity between hints of industry pressure and the marketing
announcement.  Called the first vehicle designed specifically for
electric propulsion, it is expected to sell for about $35,000.)

Nerenberg is the Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) District manager for
the San Francisco Bay Area station car demonstration (ATTN,
December 1995).  She noted that plans are already underway to
expand the demonstration "far beyond" the 40 cars that will be part
of the initial demonstration begun late last year.

The Association's executive director, Martin Bernard (Tel: 510/839-
6054), said station car demonstrations will be expanded or
initiated in South Florida, Atlanta, the New York City suburbs, New
Jersey and Northern and Southern California.

Station cars are small electric passenger vehicles driven to and
from mass transit stations by transit riders.  They are an
extension of mass transit, providing the same mobility as
conventional vehicles.  While away from the station they can be
used for any type of short trip.

Rome Adopts
GDS Software

The airport serving Rome (Italy) has purchased software from
Graphic Data Systems Corp. (GDS, 6200 S. Syracuse Way, Suite 250,
Englewood, CO 80111; Tel: 303/741-8484) to manage its
infrastructure, including facilities, the land surrounding the
airport, runways, and underground networks.

Rome Airport handles approximately 70% of all airline passengers in
Italy, or about 20 million annually.  Airport officials expect that
number to double by the year 2002.

The GDS Automated Mapping/Facilities Management (AM/FM) and
Geographic Information Systems (GIS) capabilities will be used for
the airport's expansion projects currently underway on various
areas of the airport's facilities and runways.

GDS will be used to map and manage the landbase area of the airport
and manage the thousands of construction change documents
associated with the project.  Personnel will also be able to use
the system's Computer Aided Drafting and Design (CAD) function for
2-D or 3-D drawings of the airport's physical structure and for
facility development and management.

The airport has 12 sets of GDS software running on seven Digital
Equipment Co. (DEC) Alpha workstations with support from two Alpha
servers linked by optic fiber.  One server functions as an
applications development system.  The other is split into
individual client centers where the work is divided into facilities
management, land management and runway development.

Raytheon Stars
with FAA

The Raytheon (141 Spring St., Lexington, MA 02173; Tel: 617/860-
2414) Electronic Systems Standard Terminal Replacement System
(STARS) team recently passed the Federal Aviation Administration's
(FAA) Operational Capability Demonstration (OCD), the last step in
qualifying the team to bid on the FAA STARS replacement program.
A Request for Proposal (RFP) from the FAA for STARS is expected
this month.

The STARS system will modernize and upgrade more than 240 Terminal
Radar Approach Control Systems (TRACONS) in the present FAA
National Airspace System which serves both civilian and military
installations.

This modernization program, valued in excess of $1 billion dollars,
will replace aging terminal automation equipment and will interface
with the FAA's en route system, also scheduled for modernization
under the Display System Replacement Program (which includes
Raytheon's controller workstations).

The Raytheon demonstration featured the company's AutoTrac system
for full service level functionality, Hughes (Information Systems,
Fullerton, CA) TracView system for emergency service, and UFA's
(Lexington, MA) ATCoach system for the test and training simulator.

Integrated for the STARS OCD, these open-architecture systems have
been hosted on a variety of commercial off-the-shelf hardware
platforms for terminal and en route applications in 19 countries.

In another move, Swiss Air Navigation Services Ltd. (swisscontrol)
awarded a $5.5 million contract to Raytheon Canada Ltd. (Waterloo,
Ont.; Tel: 519/895-0110) for two air traffic control primary
radars.  They are scheduled to become operational in mid-1997.
Other bidders for the project were Westinghouse, Thomson-CSF and
Alenia.

According to Richard Gaffney, president of Raytheon Canada, it is
the company's "first win in Europe against stiff international
competition."  At the present time, 27 solid-state radars are
installed worldwide, and an additional 30 are under production.

The contract calls for Raytheon to provide two ASR10SS primary
radars for the Zurich and Geneva airports.  These are the company's
latest generation air cooled, all solid-state primary surveillance
radars.  The contract also includes the production, installation
and testing of the complete system.

PR Program to
Deflect Driver Ire

There's always some pain associated with progress, or so it seems.
And when it comes to new highway construction, millions of
motorists the world over have tales of woe to tell.

 But in New Mexico, the Middle Rio Grande Council of Governments
(MRGCOG,  317 Commercial NE, Albuquerque, NM 87102) and the New
Mexico State Highway and Transportation Dept. (NMSHTD) are
embarking on a project they hope will ease the pain of a $35
million major reconstruction of I-40 scheduled to take anywhere
from two to three years to complete.  Work on the highway, which
runs right through Albuquerque, will start this spring.

In an effort to minimize the impact of the construction in the
urban area, maintain an orderly traffic flow, reduce driver
frustration and promote alternate forms of transportation, MRGCOG
and the NMSHTD decided to initiate a construction impact public
awareness program.

Holmes & Narver, Inc., (H&N, 6501 Americas Parkway, NE,
Albuquerque, NM 87110; Tel: 505/889-4100) has been named to a team
charged with developing and implementing a campaign to promote
community awareness of the construction project and how it will
impact on local streets, freeways, arterial roadways and the area's
transit system.  This public relations effort will run through 1988
or later.

Susan Johnson & Associates, an Albuquerque public relations firm,
heads the team with H&N providing advice on construction impacts,
congestion and transit concerns.  The effort, which will cost about
$300,000 is being funded partly by National Highway System
construction money along with state and local dollars.  A first
draft of the program should be ready next month.

Ron Forte (Tel: 505/247-1750), MRGCOG's director of transportation,
said there will be massive disruption where I-40 runs through part
of the city.  Also there will be considerable ramp work and very
little opportunity to divert traffic.  "We've never done anything
like this before and we're always being criticized for construction
delays and a lack of information.  So we decided to develop a
program to let drivers know what is open or closed and when, and
what progress is being made.  We want them to know what's happening
every step of the way," Forte added.

Driver information will be provided by variable message signs,
billboards with message banners that can be changed without redoing
the entire billboard when new information becomes available,
newspaper and television advertising, and standard construction
signage.

Forte said the campaign signature will be New Mexico's state bird,
the Road Runner (not the famous cartoon character).  It will appear
on signage and advertising related to the project.  While motorists
won't be able to move through construction zones with the speed of
a Road Runner, they will at least know what's ahead.

MDOT Truck Permits
Go Automatic

The Michigan Dept. of Transportation (MDOT, State Transportation
Building, 425 W. Ottawa St., P.O. Box 350, Lansing, MI 48909; Tel:
517/373-2090) has purchased Permitting and Routing Solutions (PARS)
commercial vehicle permitting automation software for
oversize/overweight vehicle operations.  The system is being
supplied by Graphic Data Systems Corp. (GDS, 6200 S. Syracuse Way,
Suite 250, Englewood, CO 80111; Tel: 303/741-8484).

MDOT is now studying ways to configure existing data to meet new
system requirements and also to determine just what data will be
needed to ensure maximum efficiency.  GDS says the software should
be in place by the second quarter this year.

MDOT issues some 120,000 trucking permits annually to enforce
compliance with motor code requirements for truck weight, height,
length and width. Currently, this is a totally manual operation
handled primarily by the Lansing office.  Each permit requires a
written application along with a permit evaluation by a DOT permit
agent.

Agency personnel fax proper documents back and forth to permit
stations around the state, and any delay in response to these
trucking permits can result in lost revenue for the state, and at
times, illegal hauling.

When PARS is in place, the entire process will be automated. Within
a matter of seconds, it will handle everything from ensuring
application compliance and determining a safe route, to issuing and
automatically faxing permits, and accounting for all transactions
involved.

David Spangenberg, MDOT engineer - utility permits, said, "Once
PARS is up and running, maximum turnaround time will decrease
instantly and we will eliminate as much paperwork as we can."

PARS, which is designed to automate a full range of operations
associated with permitting and routing oversize and overweight
vehicles, was released by GDS late last year.  The software
package, originally known as RouteBuilder, was acquired from PEAK
Solutions Inc. (Minneapolis, MN) early in 1995 (ATTN, May 1995).

Keeping BART's
Passengers Informed

Daktronics, Inc. (331 Thirty-Second Ave., P.O. Box 5128, Brookings,
SD 57006; Tel: 605/697-4300) has received a $1 million contract
from San Francisco's Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) District for
Light Emitting Diode (LED) variable message signage.

The contract calls for the design and manufacture of 44 outdoor
Destination Sign Units (DSU) for installation in five new train
stations.  BART also has the option to purchase and install an
additional $3.6 million worth of DSUs over the next five years as
funding becomes available.  These additional signs will replace
those in the other 34 BART stations.

The DSU system will consist of two-sided LED signs located over
passenger areas in the BART rail stations.  Signs will feature
full-matrix LED displays capable of showing up to four lines of 3
in. high variable text, as well as graphics and animation.  The
DSUs will communicate safety tips, BART rules, train arrival times,
train destinations, public service announcements, advertising, and
most importantly, the time.

DSUs will be controlled by BART's central control computer which
communicates via the Ethernet network.  This same computer also
operates all BART trains.

BART, a rapid transit rail system, serves passengers in the five-
county area surrounding San Francisco.  It currently includes 34
passenger stations and four routes -- about 72 miles of double
track.

Is There Maglev in
Houston's Future?

Most efforts to make Magnetic Levitation (maglev) transportation a
reality in this country are either in proposal, planning or early
prototype.  Now, added to that mix is the effort of a group of
students at the University of Alabama (Huntsville).

They have brought forth a proposal outlining the financial and
engineering feasibility of a high speed maglev transportation
system operating in a corridor between the Dallas/Fort Worth and
Houston metropolitan areas.

Maglev, a high-speed magnetically levitated ground transportation
system, offers transportation options which can augment existing
transportation systems.  The maglev vehicle can travel at speeds up
to 300 mph, carry 1200 passengers per hour per direction for the
corridor and also provide transportation for high-value, time
sensitive freight.

The proposal noted that there is a significant market opportunity
for a maglev to service the Dallas-to-Houston area.  The maglev can
expect to capture substantial portions of the air passenger and
freight markets, and 5% to 9% of the enormous automobile passenger
market.   Although the passenger rail market is extremely small,
maglev should capture significantly all of this market and 75% of
the air freight market.

A detailed financial performance indicated that a maglev project is
financially feasible.  It is projected to make money and
simultaneously provide venture capitalists with a high rate of
return and an exit mechanism from the project.

A comprehensive risk analysis, using simulation, indicated an
overwhelming probability of positive financial outcomes for the
project.  The project's projected measure of success, Net Present
Value (NPV), was predicted positive for over 95% of simulated
scenarios.  However, a significant financial commitment from the
federal government would be required to build such a system from
Dallas/Ft. Worth to Houston.

The maglev system is technologically feasible.  The actual
engineering design presented in the proposal was based on the
concept proposed by the Foster-Miller Team in their System Concept
Definition (SCD) study awarded under the National Maglev
Initiative.  It uses mature superconducting magnet technology.

Modifications to the concept were made to enhance revenue and
reduce the cost of building the system.  The proposed design
consists of an at grade, single track guideway with a passing track
in the middle and meets both the passenger capacity and light
weight freight requirements.

A major advantage of maglev is that because the vehicle operates
with almost no moving parts, maintenance requirements are
significantly reduced.  The system is anticipated to have a useful
life of 50 years.  In this design, a derailment situation is
virtually impossible.  The proposed maglev system would be safer
than air, rail or conventional road transportation.

Skycar: New PRT
from Korea

Skycar, a Korean entry in the Personal Rapid Transit (PRT)
technology race, is under development by Woobo Enterprises Company,
Ltd. (Samwon Building, 5th Floor, Nonhyun-dong 210-1 Kangnam-Ku,
Seoul, Korea; Tel: ++ 822-549-6011 or 822-549-6211/3).  Information
on how far the project has gone is somewhat sketchy.  However,
Woobo is currently looking for financial support for engineering
and testing.

Work on Skycar began in 1992 and several feasibility studies for
specific sites in Korea have been conducted.  It appears that the
Skycar PRT concept is very similar to the American TAXI 2000 PRT
concept but with important differences in the design of the
guideway and in the use of an electromagnetic switch instead of a
mechanical switch.

According to Woobo, the system would feature three-passenger
vehicles, a linear motor, and guidewheels for stabilization and
steering.  The proposed guideway is a "U" shaped steel structure
with integrated power supply, signal, communication, steering and
control equipment.

Performance specifications are based on a minimum headway of 1/2
second, maximum capacity of 7,200 vehicles per hour, average
capacity of 6,000 vph, maximum passenger capacity of 18,000 persons
per hour and average capacity of 9,000 persons per hour (at an
average occupancy of 1.5 persons per vehicle).

Average speeds are expected to range from 28-35 mph (45-60 kph).
Last year, a propulsion system development study and a
control/communication system development study were performed by an
independent company.  Woobo also established an adjunct
Transportation and Urban Research Institute to further development
of the Skycar concept.

Highway Good News,
Highway Bad News

In the short space of a week, two of this country's major daily
newspapers, The New York Times and The Washington Post carried
front page stories featuring the latest in highway technology.
However, when placed side-by-side, one article was filled with hope
and the other with considerable doubt.

First the good news.  In its January 2 edition, the Times heralded
the opening of the Riverside Freeway in Orange County, CA.  The
article commented, "In what transportation specialists say is a
bold experiment in traffic management in the state that made
traffic management both an art form and an oxymoron, a private
company has opened a brand new toll road, the most technologically
sophisticated highway ever built anywhere, smack in the median of
the old jammed road."

The existing Freeway, also known as Highway 91, is one of the most
congested in the state, carrying some 270,000 vehicles daily.
Commuters spend hours in their cars as they attempt to complete a
40 or 50 mile trip to work.

Now, for those willing to pay, the new $126 million, privately-
funded, 10-mile freeway will provide some respite from the daily
grind.  According to the Times, "California Private Transportation
guarantees that any commuter willing to pay the price will have a
delay-free, 65 mph ride through the bottleneck."

Much like telephone rates, toll charges will be based on time-of-
day usage (Value Pricing).  There will be five levels: 25 cents, 50
cents, $1, $1.50 and $2.50.  Three persons in a car ride for free.

These levels are designed to keep traffic moving by reflecting
changing traffic levels on the road.  The more traffic, the higher
the toll. Tolls are being collected electronically and there are no
toll lanes or booths.  Such familiar technologies as Automatic
Vehicle Identification (AVI) technology, transponders, and computer
billing are integrated into roadway operation.

The article noted that the Freeway's "ultimate quality control
device will be its toll schedule posted prominently for all to see
on overhead entrance signs. If at any point over the next several
months, traffic on the road becomes so heavy that delays occur,
fares will be raised for that travel hour until some of the
overload shifts to the old road, however jammed its eight free
lanes might already be."

In other comments, the story noted that, "Besides being the first
private toll road to compete with an adjacent free public road, the
new road is also the world's first fully automated toll road,
relying not just on transponders to collect fares but on other
space age devices to guarantee users a smooth safe ride."  These
include a traffic control center, remote television cameras and
"various combinations of lasers and computers to alert authorities
to problems."

Will it all work?  Only time will tell.

Now for the bad news.  In a story entitled, "Drivers Put the Brakes
on Toll Road's Promise," the December 26 edition of the Post noted
that, "The nation's first privately built highway (Dulles Greenway)
in 150 years has become an embarrassing flop, drawing only a third
of the traffic that the road owner and operator (TRIP II - 109
Carpenter Dr., Suite 200, Sterling, VA 20164; Tel: 703/729-4400)
had predicted."

Greenway traffic has been averaging 10,500 vehicles daily, and is
growing by only 1 to 2% a month, far short of original estimates of
34,000 daily customers.

(It was only last November that ATTN wrote about the Greenway being
completed six months ahead of schedule and under budget.  At that
time, congratulations were in order for those building this
privately owned and operated toll road, a 14 mi. route extending
from US Rte. 15 in Leesburg (VA) to the Washington Dulles
International Airport.  The Greenway also linked with the existing
10.4 mi. Dulles Toll Road, and opened for business last October.)

The Post article went on to say that revenue shortfalls are so
great that unless the Greenway can renegotiate loan terms or find
another source of funding, it will have to turn the road over to
its creditors.  The highway could remain in operation under such a
foreclosure, but TRIP-II could lose as much as $82 million.

In November, to stem its losses, the company laid off 19 full-time
and 20 part-time toll collectors, and to attract more drivers, it
postponed a scheduled January 1 toll increase to $2.00 from $1.75.
TRIP-II is even considering a toll reduction.  The Post noted that
this could backfire if traffic doesn't pick up enough to offset the
drop in revenue per vehicle.  The Greenway company did not release
any financial information to the Post, but the paper reported that
former company officials said first year toll revenue would amount
to about $7 million, compared with the company's targeted $27
million.

So what went wrong?  According to the newspaper account, "A review
of studies the company commissioned, and interviews with former
officials suggest that the Greenway investors made fundamental
mistakes in calculating traffic numbers." Most notably, they never
did any sensitivity studies to see if motorists would pay a $1.75
toll, they relied on outdated traffic flow research, and were
overly optimistic in selecting the first-year number of 34,000.

Also, the company struck what was termed an "ill-advised agreement
to collect for the state (VA) an extra 35 cents from Greenway
drivers getting on the Dulles toll road."  The idea was to spare
drivers the inconvenience of paying $1.75 at the Freeway toll plaza
and then stopping a half-mile later to pay the additional 35 cents.
The psychological effect, however, has been to make Greenway tolls
seem even higher than they are (a total of $2.10 for both roads).

At a mid-December meeting in New York City, Michael Crane, CEO of
the Greenway company, reportedly asked creditors to be patient
while the company conducted the marketing survey it should have
done previously and determines what changes to make in the toll.
He hoped lower tolls would attract riders who aren't using the road
now and added that changes will be made after the survey is
completed.

One Washington transportation researcher told the Post there needs
to be an off-peak discount.  "I'm surprised they haven't already
done that," he said.

MEETINGS

ITS America Ready
to Roll in Houston

The 1996 ITS America (400 Virginia Ave. S.W., Suite
800, Washington, DC 20024-2730; Tel: 202/484-4847)
Sixth Annual Meeting and Exposition is just "around the
corner."  Scheduled for April 15-18, at the George R.
Brown Convention Center in Houston, TX, the meeting
is expected to draw some 5,000 industry and government
executives, scientists and engineers, academicians,
researchers and other transportation professionals from
this country and overseas.

Featuring the theme, Realizing the Benefits, the event
will focus on the value of advanced communications,
electronic, and computer technologies in surface
transportation.

For the first time, special segments of the Annual
Meeting and exhibitor profiles will be broadcast by
satellite to local ITS decision makers around the country.
Combined with live uplinks from operational ITS sites
throughout the U.S., the broadcast will bring the national
ITS program directly to stakeholders unable to attend the
Houston meeting.

For those who will be there, a number of facility site
tours will be available, including NASA's Johnson Space
Center.  Actually, much of the ITS technology now used
in surface transportation was originally developed for the
aerospace and defense industries.

The overall program will consist of some 70 sessions
involving more than 320 panelists and presenters.


IRF Takes the
High Road

The International Road Federation (IRF) will be holding
its 13th World Meeting in Toronto from June 16-20,
1997.  The theme of the gathering is, Roads - Enhancing
the Economy, Sustaining the Environment.  While this
event will be taking place well over a year from now,
abstracts of technical presentations are due on April 1,
1996.

The program will cover the environmental and economic
impacts of transportation, transport planning, safety, road
design, ITS and innovations.  Among the more specific
discussion topics to be examined within these sessions are
High Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) programs, driver
security, Electronic Toll Collection (ETC), safety
management systems, privatization, international
standards and new pavement technologies.

More information can be obtained from Graham Jones
(Tel: 416/235-4679), manager, technical program, Ministry
of Transportation, 1201 Wilson Ave., Downview, Ontario,
