<B>Molecular Genetics Unit</B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Research in the Molecular Genetics Unit (MGU), directed by Dr. Conrad Gilliam, continues to focus on the genetics and pathogenesis of single-locus and complex heritable disorders in humans. In 1994, the MGU focused on seven major efforts: (1) continuing the gene-mapping effort to identify the spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) gene; (2) beginning studies of the pathogenesis of heritable disorders by expressing and characterizing the copper-transporting ATPase that was identified by the MGU as the Wilson disease gene in 1993; (3) beginning a collaboration with Dr. Jurg Ott's Department of Statistical Genetics on the genetic mapping of an autosomal recessive form of retinitis pigmentosa on chromosome 6, in which the lab is continuing to narrow the disease locus; (4) beginning a collaborative effort with a group in Finland to identify a rare single-locus gene for epilepsy; continuing large scale efforts to map predisposition genes for (5) bipolar affective disorder and (6) panic disorder; and (7) performing linkage studies on a small set of families with schizophrenia.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The search for the SMA gene, now in its final stage, has led to the identification in the MGU of two genes as candidates for the disease locus. These genes, along with two genes identified by others, are preferentially deleted in SMA patients. The MGU has identified a basic transcription factor sub-unit and a cell cycle regulatory protein kinase that map to the deletion region in SMA patients and has formulated a theory about the role of the protein products of the genes in forming a nucleotide excision repair complex to protect against increased oxidative metabolism that is known to damage DNA.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In the work on bipolar disorder, carried out collaboratively with Dr. Baron's Psychogenetics Division, genotyping of 100 DNA markers in 47 large families has led to detection of strong linkage to chromosome 21q22.3 in a single family. The data, which have proved to be robust to rigorous testing for a number of parameters, constitute one of the strongest linkage findings with respect to a psychiatric disease in a single family and are consistent with the presence of a single-locus gene that predisposes to bipolar affective illness in at least a small fraction of cases of this disorder.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Dr. James Knowles was recruited into the MGU as Assistant Professor to oversee the panic disorder studies and to design new strategies to identify loci for psychiatric genetics diseases.

<B>Psychogenetics Division</B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The Psychogenetics Division, directed by Dr. Miron Baron, continues its studies designed to localize and characterize susceptibility genes for bipolar and other mood disorders in a genome-wide search using DNA markers, in collaboration with the department's MGU and with Dr. Jurg Ott's Department of Statistical Genetics. Collaborating with Dr. Jean Endicott's Department of Research Assessment and Training, the Psychogenetics Division has assembled, in North America and Israel, the largest sample of bipolar families reported to date, thus affording substantial statistical power to detect or exclude susceptibility genes. As recently reported in Nature, a potentially important fruit of this labor is a possible linkage between bipolar disorder and chromosome 22 (also mentioned above under the MGU).

<B>Huntington's Disease Research Group</B>
</H3>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The Huntington's Disease (HD) Research Group, directed by Dr. Nancy Wexler, began work on the nature of the protein ("huntingtin") made by the HD gene. The protein, which has never been described, is made by both the normal gene and the HD allele, although in much larger quantity by the latter owing to the excessive number of trinucleotide repeats that made up the HD allele. Although the disease attacks a specific portion of the brain, the protein is found in all body cells. The task is to discover its normal function, as well as its altered function, in HD. The HD Research Group is collaborating with Dr. Efstratiadis of Columbia University in creating a mouse model of HD, using expanded trinucleotide repeats from children with juvenile onset HD from the large Venezuelan pedigree studied by Dr. Wexler. Use of the mouse model to "knock out" the HD gene is expected to discover the normal function of the gene and how the expanded repeat causes its lethal damage in HD. Dr. Wexler received the American Academy of Achievement's Golden Plate Award and the J. Allyn Taylor International Prize in Medicine.

<B>Keck Laboratory</B>
</H3>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The Keck Laboratory, directed by Dr. Marcelo Bento Soares, has been selected to be responsible for generating most of the cDNA libraries for a major multi-institutional, worldwide effort that has been initiated with the goal of obtaining partial nucleotide sequences from human genes. The cDNA libraries will be arrayed at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories. The information will be deposited in Genbank as well as being available worldwide for laboratories pursuing large scale mapping of human genes.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The Keck Laboratory plays a major part in the Columbia University program, funded by the National Center for Human Genome Research, which is generating a complete physical map of human chromosome 13.

<B>NIMH Genetics Initiative</B>
</H3>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The New York site of the NIMH Genetics Initiative, directed by Drs. Charles Kaufmann, Dolores Malaspina, and Jill Harkavy Friedman, continues to identify and evaluate families with several schizophrenic members. The several sites of the Genetics Initiative have ascertained 108 families with 910 individuals, making it the largest systematically acquired sample of multiply-affected schizophrenic pedigrees in the world. The study has now been re-funded by the NIMH for sample expansion, pedigree extension, and subject re-evaluation. Pedigrees from the Genetics Initiative have been genotyped in collaboration with the MGU in an effort to respond to preliminary linkage results reported by other groups. The focus has been on chromosomes 5, 17, and 22, based not only on reports by others but also on several aspects of the Psychiatric Institute investigators' own work. Linkage to chromosome 5p or chromosome 22q appears to have been excluded; analyses of possible linkage to chromosome 17q is under way.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<B>Schizophrenia Developing Clinical Research Center (SDCRC)</B>  Dr. Kaufmann, heading the Laboratory for Molecular Neurobiology, and Dr. Malaspina, heading the Laboratory of Clinical Neurobiology, have been closely involved in the establishment of the Schizophrenia Developing Clinical Research Center (SDCRC) as Co-principal Investigator and Coordinator, respectively. In conjunction with the SDCRC and the Genetics Initiative, and in several other collaborative efforts, these researchers have been engaged in tackling a large number of important problems concerned with schizophrenia. These include efforts to determine the relative importance of prefrontal versus temporal lobe dysfunction in patients from families with minimal versus heavy loading of schizophrenic relatives; examination of other features associated with high familial loading for schizophrenia; and research into a variety of other questions, such as the prevalence of schizotypal personality disorder in relatives of schizophrenic proband pairs and the evaluation of possible evidence for the phenomena of anticipation and imprinting in multiply-affected pedigrees.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Dr. Malaspina has commenced several projects in SPECT functional brain imaging, in which the dopamine 3 (D4) receptor is being quantified among groups of schizophrenic patients and normals, and brain activity during an olfactory neuroactivation task is being examined. Ongoing studies also include examination of tonic cardio-vagal tone in schizophrenia, investigation of neural pathways significant to olfactory discrimination, and study of traumatic brain injury as an environmental exposure relevant to schizophrenia.

<B>Division of Developmental Behavioral Studies</B>
</H3>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The Division of Developmental Behavioral Studies, directed by Dr. Erlenmeyer-Kimling, continued a search for pedigrees with several schizophrenic relatives in Croatia. The search is being conducted in collaboration with Dr. Endicott's Department of Research Assessment and Training, Dr. Gilliam's MGU, and Dr. Ott's Department of Statistical Genetics, as well as with a group of Croatian colleagues. Despite the difficulties of collecting these pedigrees in current circumstances in Croatia, 30 multiply-affected pedigrees have now been entered into the study. These families include 196 individuals on whom diagnostic interviewing and collection of blood samples for DNA analyses are proceeding. In addition, histories are being collected on another 194 members of these families. Efforts to expand the sample are continuing.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Dr. Erlenmeyer-Kimling's research group completed the 23rd year of the NIMH MERIT-awarded longitudinal study following offspring of schizophrenic, affectively ill, and normal parents from childhood to adulthood. Recent analyses of the adulthood psychiatric diagnoses of the first of two independently ascertained time samples in this study shows the prevalence rates of schizophrenia and related psychoses to be 18% in the offspring of schizophrenic parents, 10% (chiefly schizoaffective disorders) in offspring of affectively ill parents, and 1% in offspring of normal controls by the age of 31. Other Axis I (psychotic and nonpsychotic major psychiatric disorders) and Axis II (personality disorders) diagnoses have also been recently investigated in the first sample. Diagnostic interviews for both Axis I and Axis II are now being completed with the second sample at age 27. Analyses continue to confirm that childhood attentional dysfunctions in psychiatrically normal children of schizophrenic parents are moderately predictive of adulthood schizophrenia-related psychopathology. Childhood neuromotor, memory, and other neurobiological dysfunctions, as well as social behavior and personality characteristics, are being investigated with respect to their relationship with specific types of later psychiatric outcomes in the offspring in both samples of this study. Dr. Elizabeth Squires-Wheeler continues to collaborate in the investigation, especially in the effort to redefine the diagnostic boundaries of conditions related to schizophrenia and the genetic aspects of the schizophrenia spectrum.

<B>Cognitive Electrophysiology Laboratory</B>
</H3>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Dr. David Friedman's Cognitive Electrophysiology Laboratory is engaged in a series of interrelated investigations concerned with cognitive event-related brain potentials, memory, and attentional function in normal development and disease states. A project on cognitive development examines the maturation of the brain's electrical activity in relationship to the development of memory function during childhood, adolescence, and young adulthood. Similarly, an investigation of the effects of aging on these types of phenomena is aimed at a better understanding of these basic memory processes and how they change, in relationship to brain activity, in normal aging. An interesting and potentially important finding that has resulted from these studies is that the reduced memory function of normally aging older adults (in comparison to young adults) may be due to inefficiency in frontal lobe function. Studies of Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia (in collaboration with Dr. Gerard Bruder of the Department of Biopsychology) are also geared towards an understanding of how basic memory processes are either maintained or deteriorate in these disease states. New studies of Alzheimer's disease patients are concerned with how their memory function may be affected by disorders of attention, which also appear early in the course of this devastating illness. Drs. Friedman and Squires-Wheeler continue to collaborate on analyses relating event-related potentials collected during adolescence to the development of psychopathology in Dr. Erlenmeyer-Kimling's longitudinal high risk project described above.

<B>Psychogenetic Stress Studies</B>
</H3>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Dr. Fischman continued his long-term studies on the effects of psychogenic stress on the genetic system, begun in collaboration with the late Dr. Dennis Kelly of the Department of Developmental Psychobiology. These studies had previously shown that a wide variety of psychological stressors elicited damage in the genetic systems of rats, increasing both DNA and chromosomal damage and raising the level of Sister Chromatid Exchanges (SCEs).
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Rats subjected to repeated stress over a period of time demonstrate a reduction in behavioral and physiological responsiveness, a process known as habituation. To study whether this response also applies to genetic damage, Dr. Fischman subjected groups of rats to a variety of stressors in an unpatterned manner for 72 to 240 hours respectively. Both types of stress increased SCEs and chromosome aberrations, but the level of chromosome aberrations was lower in the 240-hour stressed rats, thus mirroring genotoxically the phenomenon of physiological habituation. SCEs, on the contrary, increased in the longer-stressed animals. Thus, SCE induction by stressors may be cumulative and long lasting, whereas chromosome aberrations are of shorter duration. An alternative explanation is that chromosome aberrations are effected by the same mechanism that accounts for habituation but SCEs are not.
