<h1><center> Biotrin: Zeroing in on organ damage</h1></center> <BR>

Biotrin Holdings Ltd. operated for its first year and a half without venture money, which meant it needed products in order to survive. Now with $2.5 million in sales in 1995 from the sale of test kits for the virology and transplant markets, the Dublin, Ireland, company is focused on creating a franchise in biomarkers that can rapidly and specifically detect damage and treatment effects in transplanted organs. <P>
The company was formed in 1992 through the merger of Syncor Ltd. and Biotrin International Ltd. Syncor was founded in 1991 to license technology from European academia and develop novel blood tests. Biotrin International was formed in 1991 as a diagnostics distribution company. <P>
<B><CENTER>First product</B></CENTER><P>

The merged company's first product was a test for parvovirus B19, which President Cormac Kilty said has become the leading test outside of the U.S. With its sales track record, Biotrin has been able to combine venture funds with sales revenues to fund further development. <P>

While parvovirus is Biotrin's cash cow, the main focus of the company is in transplantation. Biotrin markets test kits that assess tissue damage --not rejection per se --to provide clinicians with rapid information on the status of organs and their response to treatment. The biomarkers in Hepkit for the liver and Nephkit for the kidney are both based on the specificity in the liver and kidney of different forms of the protein glutathione-S transferase (GST). <P>

<B><CENTER>Rapid response</B></CENTER><P>

Because GST-based biomarkers appear rapidly in response to damage and decline equally quickly in response to treatment, and because they are highly cell-specific, the company believes they represent an improvement over standard markers used to monitor organ damage. <P>

Hepkit-alpha measures serum alpha-GST, a marker of hepatocyte injury that rises rapidly in acute organ rejection and declines rapidly in response to rejection treatment. <P>

Hepkit-pi measures pi-GST, which is found only in the cells that line the bile duct and is thus a specific marker for injury in that area. Hepkit was launched in Europe in late 1994. <P>

In a study of 55 liver transplant recipients presented in May 1995 at the European I.H.P.B.A. Congress in Athens, Greece, researchers noted that a significant rise in alpha-GST was seen with onset of rejection, which normalized within three days after the start of rejection therapy. In contrast, levels of the liver markers AST (aspartate aminotransferase) and ALT (alanine aminotransferase) failed to increase significantly with onset of rejection, and took one to two weeks to decline following therapy. <P>

Hepkit-alpha also may distinguish between rejection and hepatitis C reinfection in liver transplant, Kilty said. This is because HCV shows up in hepatocytes but not the bile duct during the initial infection. <P>

<B><CENTER>Urine biomarkers</B></CENTER><P>

Nephkit-alpha and -pi measures GST biomarkers in urine. The alpha form appears only in the proximal tubule of the kidney, an area that is damaged by toxic levels of immunosuppressant drugs such as cyclosporine. The pi form is found only in the distal tubule and is elevated in kidney rejection. <P>

In a study published in Nephron in 1994, acute rejection led to increased excretion of the pi-isoenzyme but not of the alpha form. Cyclosporine-induced toxicity led to increased excretion of the alpha form but not pi. The test therefore was able to distinguish between rejection and drug-induced toxicity. In contrast, the commonly used marker, serum creatinine, rises in connection with both cyclosporine-induced nephrotoxicity and rejection, and thus doesn't distinguish between the two. In addition, changes in the GST markers appear one to two days earlier than changes in the level of serum creatinine. <P>

"You have a much higher success rate when you detect damage early," said Kilty. "You can have 30-40 percent of kidney tubules not working before you start to see a rise in creatinine levels. So you can have a lot of damage before creatinine starts to rise." <P>

In addition to monitoring post-transplant organ function, the GST tests can be used to assess the quality of donated organs prior to transplantation. Biotrin plans to present data from a trial in the Netherlands showing a direct correlation between levels of GST in donor kidneys and graft outcomes. <P>

Biotrin targets its marketing to the specialized organ transplantation market. About 20 percent of European liver centers are using Hepkit, Kilty said. He estimated the U.S. and European hospital market for liver transplant at $15 million, and the market for kidney transplant at $20 million. <P>

<B><CENTER>Drug development use</B></CENTER><P>

The company also sees a great deal of potential in marketing to pharmaceutical companies, for use of the markers in R&D to detect drug-induced toxicity or other organ damage. Biotrin is working closely with a U.S. pharmaceutical company to develop the markers for use in drug development, Kilty said. <P>

"They're taking a couple of drugs they have on the market with known toxicities and running them in three systems: rat in vivo, rat liver slices and rat primary hepatocytes," Kilty said. "If it works, they'll use GST in all their trials." <P>

While the acute use market is relatively small, Biotrin sees its biggest potential opportunity in the home testing market, which Kilty estimates at up to $300 million in the U.S. and Europe. About 150,000 surviving kidney, liver and heart/lung transplant patients require regular monitoring, he said. Biotrin will find a partner to sell to the home testing market. <P>

The company also has acquired a pancreatitis marker, trypsinogen activation peptide (TAP), that it hopes will supplant amylase, the currently used marker. Any patient who presents at a hospital emergency room with acute abdominal pain is tested for acute pancreatitis, said Kilty. However, amylase misses 30 percent of acute pancreatitis cases. Amylase tests are currently a $50 million market, Kilty said. The company will seek a partner for TAP. <P>

Biotrin recently licensed a sepsis marker, an activatable form of serum amyloid A. The company is interested in working with companies developing sepsis products to aid in clinical trials. <P>

Finally, Biotrin has launched an alpha-GST-based product to monitor pig xenotransplants and is developing a pi version. Other products in development include assays for use in rats and dogs, for preclinical drug testing, as well as products geared to organ selection and immediate post-transplant use. The company also plans to develop tests for rejection of heart transplant. <P>

In Biotrin's viral diagnostics line, the bulk of test kit sales are in the general medicine market, but there is a growing market in blood screening, and Biotrin believes the largest potential market is in pregnancy testing. <P>

<B><CENTER>Parvovirus </B></CENTER><P>

Discovered in 1977, parvovirus is generally mild, causing a rash and joint pain. Half of adult women have immunity, having been exposed to the virus as children. But when pregnant women are infected during the second trimester, the virus results in a 5 percent rate of miscarriage. <P>

Biotrin is seeking a co-marketing partner for its parvovirus products in the U.S., where no product has been approved. <P>

Biotrin also is marketing diagnostics for herpes virus 6, adenovirus and respiratory viruses. In 1994, the company purchased its diagnostics distributors in France and Germany. <P>

Biotrin is in the midst of a funding round. The company is seeking to raise £3 million ($4.5 million), primarily to develop its U.S. business and to enter the home testing market. <P>
