ADTRANZ AND POLISH RAIL TO SIGN USD200 MILLION DEAL

from TRANSPORT EUROPE, 15 November 1996, No. 67

ADTRANZ, the joint venture between ASEA BROWN BOVERI, the Swedish-Swiss
engineering group, and Germany's motor vehicle and transport giant DAIMLER
BENZ may sign a USD200 million deal for the delivery of modern electrical
locomotives with Polish State Railways (PKP) for the delivery of
electrical locomotives. In September, the Polish Privatisation Ministry
signed an initial agreement with Adtranz on selling 75% of rolling-stock
maker PAFAWAG on the condition that the Polish firm and PKP agree on a
locomotive delivery programme. Under the agreement, Adtranz would pay
USD3.7 million for a stake in ailing Pafawag, bringing modern technology
to Poland's only rolling-stock maker, and invest USD28.1 million over the
next six years. PKP plans to invest 8 billion Zlotys for modernising its
rolling-stock over the next five years.

BRITISH AIRWAYS AND BANQUE RIVAUD TO SAVE AIR LIBERTE

from TRANSPORT EUROPE, 15 November 1996, No. 67

BRITISH AIRWAYS, in association with the French RIVAUD group, was
authorised on November 5 to salvage AIR LIBERTE, a French private airline
placed under a legal recovery procedure in September after chalking up
losses of nearly one billion Francs since 1993. Final approval for the
takeover is expected on December 15, following an observation period of 40
days. The two partners plan to inject 630 million Francs into the company,
including 150 to be committed by British Airways. With TAT and Air Liberte
under its belt, BA will control 20% of air traffic flying out of Orly
Airport, and will further increase its influence with the introduction of
new flights and more links to Nice-Toulouse and Bordeaux. BA hopes to have
Air Liberte solvent again within three years. The British plan has gone
down well with Air Liberte's employees, but not with the civilian aircraft
pilots' union, which fears job losses.

from TRANSPORT EUROPE, 15 November 1996, No. 67

The United States Department of Transportation approved, on November 5, a
cooperation alliance between SAS, the Scandinavian airline, and UNITED
AIRLINES of the US. The Department also granted anti-trust immunity to the
three-way SAS-United-LUFTHANSA alliance as part of the open sky Agreement
signed by the US and Germany last Spring. SAS and United Airlines, which
signed a cooperation accord in September 1995, have been jointly offering
66 "code-sharing" transatlantic flights since April.

AIRBUS: HISTORIC DEAL WITH USAIR

from TRANSPORT EUROPE, 15 November 1996, No. 67

The European consortium Airbus Industrie has made a significant
breakthrough into the world market by winning a contract with USAir, the
United States' fifth largest airline, for a confirmed order of 120
aircraft from the single-corridor family (A319/320/321), a to-be-confirmed
order for 120 others and an option on another 160 aircraft. This
agreement, for which a final contract must still be prepared, is worth
some USD18 billion and constitutes a victory over Boeing, Airbus's main
competitor.

For the past several months, Airbus has been running nearly neck and neck
with Boeing. Last Spring, the European consortium sold 30 A320s to China,
a market until recently dominated by Boeing and its B737. In July, Airbus
won a contract worth USD two billion to sell 45 aircraft to General
Electric's leasing company. Since their introduction in the early 1980s,
1,110 planes from the A319/320/321 family have been sold to 64 airlines
(450 of them to North American customers), of the 2,204 machines that
Airbus has sold worldwide. The diversification of a single type of
aircraft into several versions is a concept that appeals to airlines, as
it allows them to achieve operational economies. The same pilot is
qualified to fly all three aircraft, which have identical cockpits, and
maintenance, a source of considerable costs, is also similar. During the
first ten months of the year, Airbus captured 42% of the market with 125-
and 350-seat planes, the same range covered by the A319/320/321/330
twin-engine models and the four-engine A340.

AIRPORTS: PANOPLY OF INITIATIVES TO REDUCE NOISE

from TRANSPORT EUROPE, 15 November 1996, No. 67

As the European Commission launches an offensive against noise within the
framework of its November 5 Green Paper on this issue (see separate
article in Section III), European airports are up in arms. After British
authorities enacted drastic regulations on London's airports, sparking
protests from airlines, the Italian Environment Ministry introduced a
series of measures aimed at quelling noise around the country's airports
on October 21.

The Italian measures would close airports between midnight and six in the
morning and apply only to civil aviation. The international airports of
Fiumicino in Rome and Malpensa in Milan would remain open, but only for
international flights. This proposed noise reduction Decree would also
change certain flight paths, institute a noise inspection for each
aircraft every two years and require airport management companies to
present a noise reduction plan to municipalities affected by their
activities. Companies that break the rules will be fined two million Lire
for violations during the day, five million for excessive night noise and
seven million for nocturnal landings at international airports. A second
Decree concerns urban development in the areas surrounding airports and
would prohibit the construction of housing where noise exceeds 65 decibels.

IATA protests against British measures.

The anti-noise regulations published by the British Government last Summer
sets maximum noise levels for aircraft taking off from Heathrow, Gatwick
and Stansted at three decibels below international standards, effective
January 1, 1997. More frequent inspections and heavy fines for violators
are also provided for. The International Air Transport Association (IATA)
is opposed to the regulations, "the main impact of which will be to
penalise all airlines, including those with the most modern aircraft".
Parallel to its General Assembly in Geneva, the Association decided to
initiate legal proceedings against the British Government's Decree. The
new standards, which would be the strictest in the world, according to the
IATA, would prevent companies from using their planes at full capacity and
penalise even those most concerned about the environment.

OPEN SKIES STILL OVER THE HORIZON

from TRANSPORT EUROPE, 15 November 1996, No. 67

Meeting in Geneva on November 4 and 5, the member companies of the
International Air Transport Association (IATA) observed that their numbers
include both supporters and opponents of worldwide deregulation. The major
American, European and Asian companies take an ultra-liberal view, while
the smaller companies of the developing world, unsure as to whether they
can survive in an overly competitive environment and desirous of remaining
independent on issues of national sovereignty, have reservations or simply
reject the idea of global liberalisation. While not categorically opposed
to deregulation, some smaller airlines in the European Union wonder how
the process of deregulation, already largely under way within the
Community, can be enlarged to encompass non-European, i.e. American
carriers.

However, the prospect of an open sky between Europe and the United States,
which have similar attitudes to liberalisation, is still apparently some
time off, given the harsh competition on this market of 600 million
travellers, which accounted for more than half of worldwide passenger
traffic in 1995, according to the IATA. The Americans criticised the
subsidies that European carriers receive and the Community regulations
that protect them, while the European Commission's representative accused
American authorities of not considering the liberalisation of its market a
priority.

The 254 member countries of the IATA are expected to achieve record net
profits of USD5.5 billion in 1996, a return rate considered encouraging.
The main reasons are restructuring and reductions in operating costs,
although the rising price of fuel is still a concern. The next General
Assemblies of the IATA will be held in November 1997 in Amman, Jordan, and
in June 1998 in Montreal.

AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL: WILL THE EUROPEAN UNION JOIN A REVAMPED EUROCONTROL?

from TRANSPORT EUROPE, 15 November 1996, No. 67

In the wake of its March White Paper on air traffic control, the European
Commission unveiled a draft brief for the negotiation of Community
membership in Eurocontrol, which is responsible for management of air
traffic in Europe, on November 13, "so that the European sky can be
managed as a common resource, unrestricted by national boundaries".
However, the Community cannot join Eurocontrol unless its current areas of
competence and powers are reformed and enhanced. The Commission is hoping
that the Council of Transport Ministers will reach a common position on
the proposed mandate at its December 12 and 13 meeting. The European Civil
Aviation Conference (ECAC) will issue an opinion on the revision of the
Eurocontrol Convention in February 1997, within the framework of its
INSTAR strategic study.

In a White Paper published on March 6, the Commission discussed the need
to improve European air traffic control and combat growing congestion,
which causes delays and creates additional costs for carriers. The third
option set out in the White Paper, and the Commission's favourite,
provides explicitly for the EU's accession as a full member to a
"reinvented Eurocontrol", to ensure Community competence over air traffic
management and avoid any clash of competence between the two organisations
by allowing the Member States to speak with a single voice. This approach
would separate regulatory tasks (which would be the province of the new
Eurocontrol) and operational activities (the responsibility of the Member
States).

In the draft mandate it tabled on November 13, the Commission defines the
steps it considers necessary to take to implement the recommendations of
the White Paper. But two main elements must still be clarified, i.e. what
additional responsibilities and powers will be conferred upon Eurocontrol
to make the organisation capable of fulfilling its new role, and under
what procedure will the Community become a member of the reformed
organisation? Thinking strategically, the Commission plans to submit its
proposals for the Council's opinion before the end of the year (with a
view to a common position at the Transport Council of December 12 and 13),
to pre-empt any attempt by the 33 member countries of the European Civil
Aviation Conference (ECAC) to reform Eurocontrol without taking account of
the Community position at their Ministerial meeting in February.

Eurocontrol Convention review.

The EU's Transport Ministers must take a position as to whether to grant
the Commission a brief to negotiate with the non-EU members of Eurocontrol
on a revision of the Eurocontrol Convention which would expand the
organisation's role and allow the European Union per se to join. The
mandate is also expected to give the EU the right to vote and thus to
oppose any decision it considers contrary to Community interests.

Two models for Eurocontrol reform.

Meanwhile, the ECAC is working to finalise INSTAR, a strategic study on
the reform of European air traffic control. Although the Commission would
prefer the particular approach mentioned above, the White Paper left the
way open to new discussions with all concerned organisations, including
ECAC. In the intervening months, the two models have converged
significantly, although certain important points, including some related
to the competence of the future Eurocontrol, must still be settled,
including:

* the principle of a separation between regulatory functions and provision
of services;

* proposals concerning management of airspace (the Commission sees the
future Eurocontrol as having responsibility for structuring the European
airspace, defining military zones and flight paths and improving control
in border areas);

* the definition of common objectives for safety services and access to
airspace (which would devolve upon the revamped Eurocontrol under option 3
of the White Paper);

* coordination of technological research and development activities (the
ECAC would like this to be the task of Eurocontrol, while the Commission
would prefer this coordination to take place within the EU's Framework
Programmes for research);

* the creation of financial mechanisms to support common policy on air
traffic control (the Commission considers it important to allow the new
Eurocontrol to fund common initiatives).

Eurocontrol presents annual report for 1995.

In 1995, Eurocontrol had two good reasons to be satisfied with its
performance: on the one hand because it practically completed the third
and final phase of its EATCHIP programme on the harmonisation and
integration of air traffic control, and on the other as the new Central
Flow Management Unit (CFMU) took up its mission to reduce the congestion
of European airspace (becoming fully operational in March 1996).
Eurocontrol currently has 22 member countries: the EU Member States minus
Finland and Spain (accession pending), plus Turkey, Malta, Cyprus,
Hungary, Switzerland, Norway, Slovenia, the Czech Republic and Romania
(the accession of Croatia and the Slovak Republic is being formalised).
Eurocontrol also has an important role to play in the management of
European air traffic since, having been recognised as the responsible
authority by a European Parliament Resolution of November 1995, it is now
regarded by the European Commission as having an essential contribution to
make to reforming the management of Europe's skies.

BRITISH AIRWAYS/AMERICAN AIRLINES ALLIANCE ON HOLD

from TRANSPORT EUROPE, 15 November 1996, No. 67

A proposed alliance between British Airways and American Airlines, aimed
at establishing the world's largest air transport entity, is conditional
upon a number of decisions. It must be approved by London, Washington and
the European Commission, and its fate is also hinges on the outcome of
open sky pact negotiations between the United States and the UK. The
United States' approval is contingent upon the conclusion of an open sky
Agreement. The approval of the British Government is considered the most
easily overcome regulatory obstacle for BA and American, which are hoping
to get the go-ahead by the end of November. Based on a report by the
Office of Fair Trading, one of the UK's competition authorities, the
Ministry of Trade and Industry could accept the project, subject its
approval to conditions or instigate another phase in the competition
inquiry, by submitting the proposal to the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission.

The resumption of negotiations between the UK and US in Washington on
November 7 and 8 is considered a good omen for the future of British
Airways. Discussions so far have always foundered (on August 27, the
American delegation suspended talks on the ground that British proposals
were inadequate) and experts doubt that the companies will be able to
implement their agreement before the planned date of their alliance in
April 1997. Talks between the two countries could resume at Ministerial
level in early December. The main point of discussion is access for
American carriers to London's airports, including Heathrow. The proposed
BA/AA alliance sparked a strong reaction from USAir, the fifth largest
American company, which criticised a code-sharing agreement with British
Airways in protest.

NEW COMMISSION LEGISLATIVE INITIATIVES FOR 1997

from TRANSPORT EUROPE, 15 November 1996, No. 67

On October 16, the Commission adopted its work programme for 1997 which it
unveiled to the European Parliament in Strasbourg on October 22. Of the 16
legislative initiatives planned for next year, five directly concern
transport policy. These proposals cover:

* training of safety advisors for road, rail or inland waterway transport
of hazardous goods;

* the composition of boat crews, rest and navigation time;

* the measurement and control of noise in airport zones;

* the granting of certificates to air carriers;

* harmonisation measures necessary for the deployment of telematics in the
area of road transport.

The European Parliament gave the work programme a frosty welcome on
October 22, criticising the Commission for its lack of initiative in
proposing new legislation to an increasingly hostile Council of Ministers.

EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT FAVOURS BUDGET INCREASE FOR TRANSPORT

from TRANSPORT EUROPE, 15 November 1996, No. 67

The European Parliament proposed, on October 24, an increase of some ECU
800 million to the EU's draft Budget for 1997, over the amount agreed on
by the Council of Ministers in July. The additional funds would be used
for trans-European transport networks and the budget line on transport
policy, in which the Council planned to make severe cuts.

As is its right within the limits of the financial perspective, the
Parliament restored credits that the Council had dropped in July. In the
area of internal policy, the Parliament decided to create a reserve of ECU
300 million, including putting ECU 73 million in a negative reserve to
finance the 14 priority trans-European transport projects. This accounting
trick would allow it to dip into funds from heading 3 during execution of
the Budget. The Parliament also allocated more money to budget lines the
Council had cut, such as the environment, consumer protection, equal
opportunities for men and women, information and communication, the fight
against fraud and transport. Payment appropriations for transport now
total ECU 28.495 million (compared to 27.7 in the Council's proposal), but
remain well below those in the 1996 Budget (30.582 million).
