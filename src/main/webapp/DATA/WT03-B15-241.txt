<center><h1><i>Expatriate Protection Plans</i></h1></center>
<p>
<Center><h2>INTRODUCTION</h2></center>
<p>
<b>Designed specifically for British Subjects residing abroad or other foreign nationals residing outside the country for which they hold a passport.</b>
<p>
With three distinct Medical and Personal Accident Plans available, BUDGET, STANDARD and SUPER, the proposer is able to select an Insurance option best suited to his or her specific needs and requirements. An Expatriate Protection Plan is available for persons up to 75 years of age and includes cover whilst engaged in office or administrative occupations. For other occupations or for companies and groups, proposers are invited to seek tailor-made quotations which may include group discounts.
