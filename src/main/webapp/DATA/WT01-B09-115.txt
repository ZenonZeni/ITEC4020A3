<b>Project Summary:</B>
<P>
Rapid Charging of batteries extends the travel distance of electric
vehicles (EVs) well beyond the range allowed by onboard or overnight
charging systems currently available. This type of infrastructure
will play a significant role in making EVs convenient to operate
and a positive experience for users, thereby contributing to the
proliferation of EVs operating on roadways throughout the country.
This in turn, reduces harmful NMOG tailpipe emissions and improves
air quality in the region.
<P>
This project's goal is to produce a universal rapid charger that
will charge electric vehicles meeting the evolving industry guidelines
for level 3 conductive charging. At issue is the need to provide
a charging unit capable of charging multiple types of vehicles
and batteries in a way that is safe, efficient, and effective.
This project takes into account the operator interface, vehicle
interface, battery requirements, and the interface to the utility
grid with emphasis on power quality. The Advanced Rapid Charger
will be capable of providing charging current and voltage for
multiple charging regimes using constant current and/or constant
voltage, pulse charging and pulse charging/pulse discharge types
of algorithms.
