<B>MNR Minister Chris Hodgson Lifts Ban On Prescribed Burning
</B>

</CENTER><P>

Natural Resources Minister Chris Hodgson announced today that he has lifted the ban on prescribed burning in Ontario.<P>
         
"I am satisfied that the implementation of the recommendations from the review carried out last fall will result in enhanced safety procedures and effectiveness, within Ontario's prescribed burn (PB) program," said Mr. Hodgson.<P>
         
Mr. Hodgson immediately requested a review of prescribed burns and placed a ban on such burns last summer after two burns in the Wawa area escaped their boundaries.<P>
         
A Prescribed Burn Review Committee, which included representatives from the MNR, the Fire Marshal's Office, the municipality of Dubreuilville, Hearst Forest Management Inc. and the Canadian Forestry Service, presented recommendations in December for improvements in the management of prescribed burns.<P>
         
The recommendations included earlier identification of problem fires; a revised and more extensive PB planning manual for fire managers; and improved weather monitoring and long-term forecasting.<P>

This year MNR and its clients plan 35 prescribed burns involving a total area of approximately 4,500 hectares.  The burns are primarily for site preparation for silviculture, ecosystem restoration, vegetation management and wildlife habitat enhancement.  They range in size from one hectare burns for ecosystem restoration in southern Ontario, to a 1,400-hectare site preparation burn in Northern Ontario.<P> 
         
"The use of prescribed burning as an effective and efficient forest and ecological management tool is widely recognized but it is not without a degree of risk,"           Mr. Hodgson said. "However, I am very confident that with the implementation of the recommendations we have further minimized any such risks."<P>
