<B>CFIP Funding Hits Record Level, Says Hodgson
</B>
</CENTER><P>
The Ministry of Natural Resources provided $515,000 in funding to support volunteers in 242 fishery improvement projects across Ontario in 1996, announced Natural Resources Minister Chris Hodgson.<P>

"This is the largest amount MNR has ever invested in its Community Fisheries Involvement Program in a single year," Hodgson said.<P> 

MNR's Community Fisheries Involvement Program (CFIP) provides seed money and technical expertise to organized volunteer groups that have had projects approved by the ministry. Typical activities include: fish culturing and stocking projects, spawning bed restorations, stream rehabilitations, fish transfers, fish ladders and fishery assessments.  CFIP funds are generally used for materials and supplies with the volunteer group providing all the necessary labor to complete the project.<P>

 "The CFIP program facilitates worthwhile fishery projects throughout the province, but it is only possible because of the great contributions in time and energy provided by dedicated CFIP volunteers," said Minister Chris Hodgson.  "I want to heartily thank all the participating individuals and groups for their vital assistance and pledge my ministry's continued support for this important program."<P>

Aside from providing direct benefits to Ontario fisheries, CFIP projects also enrich the volunteers who take part in them. Participants contribute to the resource while also learning about the finer points of fishery management.<P>

Funding for CFIP projects now comes from the special account established last year by MNR to support fish and wildlife management activities using revenue collected from fish and wildlife licence fees, royalties and fines.<P>

Groups receiving CFIP funding in 1996 included: tourist outfitters, fish and game clubs, schools, First Nations, service clubs, lake groups, cottagers' associations and community associations. The average CFIP contribution in 1996 was approximately $2,130 per project.<P>

Interested groups or individuals should contact their local MNR District Office for further information on the program or projects in their area.<P>
