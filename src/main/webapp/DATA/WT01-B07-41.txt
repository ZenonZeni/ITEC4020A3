<H1>AIRBASE Available on CD-ROM</H1>
<HR>

<P>
<A HREF="airbase.html" >AIRBASE  </A>, the AIVC's bibliographic
database is now available on CD-ROM. Both DOS and Windows versions
are included and it is possible to either operate AIRBASE directly
from a CD Drive or download the software onto hard disk. This
new version greatly simplifies installation and operation by eliminating
the need for many compressed floppy disks.
<P>
AIRBASE presently contains over 9800 fully abstracted references
to technical papers and articles related to ventilation. Topics
cover strategies, measurement and calculation methods, energy
implications and indoor air quality. Input is derived from literature
published throughout the world and from conference proceedings
and reports from government and other laboratories. It is updated
quarterly with titles and bibliographic details being summarised
in '<A HREF="ra_cont.html" >Recent Additions to AIRBASE  </A>'.
<P>
Existing users can opt to receive the CD version as future updates
at no increase in charge. It will also be available to new users
(in <A HREF="countries.html" >Participating Countries  </A>) from
September 1996 at &#163;150 sterling plus UK VAT where applicable,
inclusive of postage and packing. Subsequent updates can be supplied
annually at &#163;60 + VAT, or four per year at &#163;120 + VAT.For
more information contact the <A HREF="address.html" >AIVC  </A>.
