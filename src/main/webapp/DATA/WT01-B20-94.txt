<FONT SIZE=+1><TT><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 in 4 black males between the age of 18 and 30 are in prison.  The leading cause of this imprisonment is the WAR ON DRUGS!
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Violence has gripped many poor black communities.  This violence is a direct result of the WAR ON DRUGS!  When so many pecple are pushed out of the legal system and courts cannot be depended on for justice, violence seems to be the only alternative.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The police have used the WAR ON DRUGS as an excuse to stop and search black males anytime they wish.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The WAR ON DRUGS has done more harm to the black community than any other.  There are many divisions separating the black and white community but this is an issue which we can unite on.  Black, white, and hispanic united to stop this war ravaging our communities.  Join us!  We all want our brothers and sisters, friends and family back!
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We advocate the legalization of Marijuana for it's peace inducing qualities and other industrial uses.  We do not advocate the use of addictive or hard drugs, but we feel that arrest and imprisonment are not proper solutions.

<P>We are coming together for a demonstration against the WAR ON DRUGS:</TT></FONT>
