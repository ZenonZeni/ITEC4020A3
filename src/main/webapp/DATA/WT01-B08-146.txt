<A NAME="flash"> </A><H2>Fertilizer at the speed of light!</H2>
<IMG SRC="FLASH.gif" ALIGN=left><P>Only nature can deliver fertilizer with more style than Whitney Farms. In fact, nature brings it to the garden in a flash­ of lightning, that is. </P>
<P>Lightning forces nitrogen in the atmosphere to combine with oxygen to form nitrogen oxides. When rain washes nitrogen oxide out of the air, it eventually produces nitrogen in the soil that plants can use for leafy growth. </P>
<P>However, Whitney Farms is far more predictable than thunderstorms, even if we
can't
match nature's dramatic display. </P>
<A NAME="myth"> </A><H2>Mucky Myth of the Month</H2>
<P>In our continuing quest to debunk gardening myths, the editors of the Dirt now turn their attention to the persistent belief that sand is a beneficial and desirable soil amendment. Like many myths, this one contains an element of truth that is the genesis of the mistaken belief. </P>
<P>First, in a man-made potting soil or in small localized areas, sand is a perfectly acceptable ingredient for promoting adequate drainage.  However, in a garden that has clay soil, sand is the last thing to add to improve drainage over a large area. Sand is a binding agent. If you add sand to most clay soils, you will end up creating a low-grade concrete.  For an acre of clay garden soil you would have to add more than a million pounds of sand to beneficially change the soil structure in the top six inches! </P>

<P>A far better solution to poorly drained clay soils is to add ample amounts of good compost. We suggest Whitney Farms Planting Mix or Mushroom Compost come to mind. In addition to improving soil structure by making the clay become granular in texture, the compost will stimulate soil organisms and add essential plant nutrients. </P>


<A NAME="fruit"> </A><H2>Fruit or Vegetable? The quandry continues</H2>
<IMG SRC="SICK.gif" ALIGN=right><P>It is prominent among life's great questions. Experts in the fields of law, science, and business have wracked their brains over it for centuries. It is the subject of heated debate at the dinner table, across backyard fences and in neighborhood bars. It has even reached the United States Supreme Court.
The question is this: Is a tomato a fruit or vegetable or what? </P>
The editors of the Dirt have found the definitive answer to this weighty matter to be as elusive as a blight-resistant  tomato. </P>
<P>As the Supreme Court decided decades ago, the tomato is generally accepted and understood, according to its common usage, to be a vegetable, and therefore should be classified and taxed as such.
On the other hand, many gardeners will insist that because it grows on a vine it must be a fruit, like grapes or kiwi. They also rightly point out that the part of a flowering plant that holds seeds is technically a fruit. </P>
<P>Webster's Dictionary takes the middle road, defining the tomato as "a widely cultivated solanaceous plant, native to South America, bearing a slightly acid, pulpy fruit, commonly red, sometimes yellow, used as a vegetable; the fruit itself." </P>
<P>Botanists go further still, and classify the fruit of the tomato plant as a berry. That¹s right, a berry, because of its fleshy pulp and numerous small seeds. </P>
<P>So there you have it. A tomato is different things to different people. What almost everyone can agree on is that they are versatile, delicious, and easy to grow. </P>
<P>Now what are we to make of rhubarb, an ornamental vegetable with poisonous leaves and roots with edible stems that are used as a fruit in pies? </P>


<A NAME="question"></A><H3>Now to address a practical question:</H3>
<H3>Where do you find a blight-resistant tomato?</H3>
<P>The insidious and rampant fungal disease known as blight is a persistent problem of tomato growing. The form known as late blight is particularly devastating, striking with little warning just as harvest begins. An airborne fungus, late blight often hits after a prolonged warm, humid spell in mid-summer.
An organic fungicide, such as copper or sulfur spray, applied before the fungus spores land on the plant, can prevent the disease from taking hold. However, once the plant is infected, the disease spreads rapidly, spoiling the entire crop. </P>
<P>Some growers find that a row cover can prevent infection, while others advocate pruning to open up the plant and improve air circulation. </P>
<P>The editors of the Dirt are anxious to know if some tomato varieties are more blight- resistant than others. Readers are encouraged to share their experience either through
<A HREF="email.htm">e-mail</A> or by letter. </P>




<A NAME="note"></A><H2>A note from the President</H2>
<H3>Fresh vegetables.</H3>
<P>I was speaking with a grouch the other morning about gardening. He claimed that he had never planted a vegetable garden because the economics didn't make sense. "Why garden when I can go down to the grocery story and buy ten ears of corn for a dollar?" he said. "I can't grow corn that cheap." </P> <P>
He misses the point. For most of us, gardening is not about dollars and cents. It's about that series of small successes we all look forward to. For the vegetable gardener, it's also about taste. There is little more satisfying than a plate of fresh  vegetables from your own back yard in the late summer. The difference in taste between store-bought and home-grown is dramatic.</P>
Grow your own!<BR>
