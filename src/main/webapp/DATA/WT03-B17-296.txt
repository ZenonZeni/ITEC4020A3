   <STRONG><H1>  The Non-Toxic Medicine Cabinet</H1></STRONG>
       It  is  surprising how many toxins one can find in our  medicine
  cabinet!   Many of our tools for healing ourselves are themselves deadly.
       Doctors  use  many  synthetic substances  with  exotic  sounding
  names.

     <H1>Here  is  a  list of recommended natural survival tools
 for  your natural  medicine cabinet.</H1>
    <STRONG><H2> Honey</H2></STRONG>
     Is an important natural healing agent. It destroys bacteria.
     Honey is an excellent high energy food source.
     Stores easily and will last indefinitely.
     H2O2, Hydrogen Peroxide
     Can be used to sterilize wounds.
     Will kill bacteria and provide oxygen to the body.
     Can  be ingested in small amounts. See "Oxygen Therapies", by   Ed
McCabe.
     He's available at 1-800-256-08372
     <STRONG><H2>Sun Chlorella or Blue-green Algae</H2></STRONG>
     A very important tools for our health and our survival.
     Here  lie  all the vitamins and minerals that our bodies  need  to
stay  healthy.  Also chlorella helps eliminate toxins while at the same
time  rebuilding  our  cell walls. It is the cell walls  that  transfer
nutrition  into a substance that our body needs. Death is  the  process
when  our  cell  walls no longer are being rebuilt. Read  "Gem  of  the
Orient" by  Bernard Jensen.
    <STRONG><H2> Chlorella</H2></STRONG>
     Is  a complete food. If you can't get either of these then use any
green algae like Spirulina, Green Magma, or wheat grass.  Chlorella  is
one  of  the  best  sources of chlorophyll, containing  100  times  the
chlorophyll of wheat grass!
    <STRONG><H2> Vit C</H2></STRONG>
     Helps  you  in many ways. By allowing a strong immune system,  and
regulating vital hormones, helping the skin, and the liver to eliminate
toxins,  and  the kidneys to do the same, helping eye sight,  and  much
more.  Promotes healing.
    <STRONG><H2> Vit E</H2></STRONG>
     Is essential for healing.
    <STRONG><H2> Beta-caratone</H2></STRONG>
     Which the body converts into Vit A.
     <STRONG><H2>Calcium</H2></STRONG>
     Is  a  natural  pain  killer and important for bone  building  and
repair
     <STRONG><H2>Golden Seal</H2></STRONG>
     Promotes healing while controlling infection.
     <STRONG><H2>Cyclone Cider</H2></STRONG>
     Will help you fight off a cold and other bacterial infections.
    <STRONG><H2> Melaleuca Oil,</H2></STRONG>
     From  Australia,  promotes healing. Excellent  for  cuts,  stings,
infections and Fights bacteria.
     <STRONG><H2>Echinacea & Goldenseal</H2></STRONG>

     <STRONG><H2>Comfrey</H2></STRONG>

    <STRONG><H2> Castor oil</H2></STRONG>
     Protects skin and cuts.
   <STRONG><H2>  Healing Clay</H2></STRONG>
     Is useful for removing toxins from system.
     Since this is not a survival book as such, I am not going into the
various  survival tools you will need to have together such  as  water,
food, shelter, first-aid, resources, etc. There are many survival books
available. For more information read "Survival into the 21st  Century",
by Victor Kulvinskas.

     One thing for certain concerning survival; it is important to stay
away  from  `quick'  chemicals. The solution is  to  stick  to  natural
products  when  ever possible. Avoid anything that will  further  upset
Nature's balance.
