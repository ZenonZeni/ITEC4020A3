THREADNEEDLE SET FOR MAJOR EXPANSION OF OPERATIONS THROUGHOUT EUROPE

THREADNEEDLE Asset Management, the fund management subsidiary of BAT
Industries, is gearing up for a major expansion of its European
activities in 1996 and 1997. It is revamping its existing product
range, expanding its distribution network and embarking on a major
recruitment campaign that will result in the appointment of 20 business
development, client relationship and marketing executives to supplement
its existing Luxembourg operation.

At present Threadneedle's European activities are based primarily
around the Global Assets Fund (GAF), a Luxembourg-domiciled Sicav with
$500 million invested in 20 subfunds. This is distributed in Belgium,
the Netherlands and the UK, although a small amount of business also
comes from Germany.

The European venture is the first significant business outcome
following BAT's decision to consolidate the fund management operations
of Allied Dunbar and Eagle Star, its two life, pensions and investment
products subsidiaries, into a separate company in June 1994.
Threadneedle currently has around #30 billion ($45 billion) of assets
under management.

The European thrust will initially be based around a revamped GAF,
which was originally offered under the Eagle Star name. "We are
relaunching GAF in Belgium and the Netherlands during March 1996," said
Alan J Ainsworth, Threadneedle's managing director (retail). "The
relaunch will incorporate a number of significant changes. We shall
also be offering Belgian investors a new guaranteed equity Sicav."

Threadneedle currently distributes GAF through two Belgian banks,
Banque Commerciale Bruxelles and Bank Unie. It has recently signed a
third - and as yet unnamed - bank distributor. In the Netherlands it
relies primarily on independent brokers for distribution, a distinction
which will be reflected in a new pricing structure for the relaunched
umbrella fund. IFAs, together with Eagle Star, have also been used in
the UK to market the fund, although Threadneedle hopes to focus
increasingly on direct media.

The German market will be targeted later in 1996. "We have a major new
product initiative for the German market," said Ainsworth. As in the
Netherlands, Threadneedle currently relies on IFAs to distribute GAF.

Other markets earmarked for development are Spain - where Threadneedle
hopes to capitalise on its links with SAFEL, a Spanish retail
investment group in which BAT owns part of the equity - and France.

The new initiative is certainly well-timed. Global stockmarkets have
been extremely buoyant during the first few weeks of 1996, and the
omens for the rest of the year are propitious. The prospect of further
drops in interest rates and greater liquidity are expected to power
markets upwards, and this should help boost demand for the product.

In addition the relaunch is likely to benefit from the momentum
achieved during 1995. "Last year we grew the Global Assets Fund by
around $100 million," said Ainsworth."We also added three new
portfolios: a Latin American fund, a Japanese smaller companies fund
and a global bond fund."

Threadneedle has already made a number of key appointments to support
its European initiative. Robin Threadgold, previously at Fidelity, has
been made head of European Business. Tina Wilkinson joined the company
in January from Gartmore Indosuez in Paris to head European Marketing.
Another major appointment is expected in the next few weeks.

UK FUND MANAGERS CHASE RETAIL INVESTORS

THE PERIOD between January 1 and April 5, the end of the fiscal year,
is open season for new - or revamped - mutual fund product launches, as
fund managers attempt to take full advantage of the opportunities
presented by the UK's Personal Equity Plan (PEP) legislation.

This enables investors each fiscal year to shelter up to #6,000
($10,000) worth of equity and qualifying mutual fund investments from
the taxman in a "general PEP", plus an additional #3,000 in a"single
company" PEP.

This year investment companies have an additional incentive to increase
their marketing efforts. During January and February an estimated #12
billion of household savings will be seeking a new home as the first
Tax Exempt Special Savings Plans (TESSAs) mature. With interest rates
falling and the UK stockmarket generating total returns of around 20
percent in 1995, compared to around 6 percent on bank deposits, mutual
funds should be well placed to increase their share of the savings
market.

So far there has been no shortage of new product announcements. Two of
the largest players in the UK market - Perpetual and M&G - have
announced their intention of launching two new low-cost investment
trusts aimed firmly at the PEP market.

M&G is launching M&G Equity Investment Trust, a split capital
investment trust offering a number of classes of share, in February. A
unique feature of this trust is that it will be completely load free,
although at 1.25 percent the annual management fee is rather high and
this, on normal criteria, would pre-empt its sale to the non-PEP
investor.

On February 20, Perpetual will launch Perpetual Income and Growth
Investment Trust plc. Managed by Neil Woodford, whose other funds have
enjoyed outstanding performance, the trust has a lower annual
management fee (0.75 percent per annum) than M&G but imposes a 0.5
percent plus VAT charge for the PEP wrapper.

Low costs are clearly seen as an important marketing tool by many
companies. Fidelity has launched a range of four no-load funds,
including an index tracker, clearly aimed at the PEP market.

The Fidelity MoneyBuilder Index carries an annual management fee of 0.5
percent, which briefly was second to only River & Mercantile in the
low-cost tracker fund stakes. One of its rivals, Legal & General,
retaliated immediately by reducing the fees on its UK tracker to
exactly the same level.

Among other companies who have announced new product launches to cash
in on the PEP season are Schroders, whose top performing UK Growth
Investment Trust is issuing new shares, Hargreaves Landsdown (Optimum
Income & Growth Trust), Flemings and Jupiter Tyndall (Jupiter High
Income Fund).

PRIVATISATION SHARES INDEX PUBLISHED

NM ROTHSCHILD, a UK-based investment bank, and Privatisation
International, a specialist magazine, have launched a new Global Index
of Privatisation shares. This will enable investors to track in a
systematic way the performance of privatised companies on stock markets
around the world.

The index encapsulates around 175 different shares, and includes most
of the large privatisations initiated by way of initial public offer
since 1980. Denominated in US dollars and weighted by market
capitalisation, it will be added to as new privatisations occur.

Calculated back to 1990, the index shows that over the medium term
privatisation shares have significantly out-performed markets
generally.

Total privatisations in 1995 amounted to $73.2 billion, a record
according to Privatisation International, with at least 45 countries
engaged in active privatisation programmes. Total proceeds were about
15 percent higher than in 1994 and were split equally between public
offers and private sales to strategic investors.

ALL CHANGE AT M&G, PRUDENTIAL AND SCHRODERS

A NUMBER of prominent figures within the UK fund management sector have
either resigned their positions, retired or announced their impending
retirement during late December and January.

At M&G, there have been two significant departures. Tony Shearer, the
company's chief operating officer, resigned following "personality
clashes" with the managing director David Morgan. The failure to
consummate a joint venture with Hong Kong-based Dah Sing would appear
to have sealed A J Oddie's fate. His post of business development
officer has been phased out, so precipitating his departure from the
company.

With events at Dunedin still fresh in the memory there is inevitable
speculation that these departures might be followed by others. There is
also mounting concern that these departures could be symptomatic of
more wide-ranging problems at the company, which pioneered unit trusts
in the UK and is the largest provider of general PEPs.

Critics have pointed to the sharp fall-off in the company's investment
performance. There is concern that M&G is increasingly being driven by
marketing as opposed to performance criteria.

These claims are countered by assertions that recent market conditions
have not been conducive to the company's investment style, which is
value-driven and focuses on small-to-medium-sized companies. Taken on a
medium-term view M&G's is still above trend.

Prudential Portfolio Managers (PPM) is searching for a new chief
executive following the departure of Hugh Jenkins, who retired on new
year's eve. Prudential, with more than #75 billion ($110 billion) of
assets under management, is one of the largest UK fund managers.

Rodney Dennis, who currently manages PPM's UK and European operations
and chairs the company's asset allocation committee, will assume
control until a successor is found.

It could be some time before a new appointment is made."We will take
whatever time is needed to ensure that the right candidate is selected
for what is a vitally important job within the group," said a
Prudential spokesman.

Schroder's long-serving Ed Mercer, one of the pioneers of investment in
Japan, is seeking pastures new at Atlantis Investment Managers. Mercer,
who managed Schroder's Japan Smaller Companies and Japan Growth
Investment Trust, is succeeded by Andrew Ross.

WHO WILL BE NEXT IN THE UK FUND MANAGEMENT AUCTION?

There was no shortage of M&A activity in UK fund management in 1995.
Given the speculation and rumours surrounding the sector, the new year
could generate substantial further activity

THE MOST intriguing - and longest running - saga in the UK fund
management industry concerns the future of Hill Samuel following the
merger of its parent TSB Group with Lloyds Bank, which became effective
on December 28.

The long-term future of Hill Samuel, a UK-based merchant banking and
asset management group, has been a subject of debate ever since it was
acquired by TSB shortly before the stockmarket crash of 1987.

Encouraged by its new owners, Hill Samuel went on a commercial
property-lending binge at the time the market broke. Bad debts were so
large that in 1992, TSB had to establish a special loans administration
unit to manage them. More significantly, Hill Samuel's debts
compromised the profitability of TSB Group during the early 1990s.

Hill Samuel, however, has important and profitable fund management
interests. Hill Samuel Asset Management and Financial Services
currently claims to manage #28 billion ($42 billion) from its London
offices and a further #10 billion in the US, where it has two
subsidiaries. It also trying to expand in the far east. Fund management
activities contributed #21 million to group profits in 1994.

These interests dwarf Lloyds's asset management activities. Lloyds
Investment Managers, the bank's main asset management vehicle, only has
around #12 billion of funds under management.

Given the emphasis which Lloyds chief executive Sir Brian Pitman is
allegedly placing on the sale of investment products within the bank,
as well as improving earnings quality generally, both units should have
a future within the enlarged group, although it is not beyond the
bounds of possibility that the merchant banking interests will be sold
off. To all intents and purposes, Lloyds has exited from this sector of
the banking market.

Some commentators are not convinced, however. A former fund manager was
very critical about Lloyds's stewardship of Lloyds Investment Managers.
"Lloyds Investment Managers was very profitable. It had to be to remain
in the Lloyds Group," he told FI. "We were set a target ROE of 20
percent which was only achieved by squeezing costs and investment. Our
performance definitely suffered as a consequence."

For the moment both investment groups will operate as separate
entities, as will the other components of the TSB-Lloyds merger.
"Everything is in the melting pot. No decisions have yet been made
concerning the future and structure of the group," said a Lloyds
spokesman. A Hill Samuel spokesman was more cryptic. "We are constantly
getting enquiries about our future from the media. We just don't know."

At the moment all options would appear to be open. The two fund
management groups could be combined to create a large integrated group.
Alternatively, one of the units could be sold off. Given the length of
time taken to dispose of John Govett (see FI 14) and uncertainties over
the sale of Gartmore, the market for UK-based asset managers may no
longer be quite so buoyant.

In the mean time, Hill Samuel Asset Management's chief executive
Richard Bernays has decided to leave the company. He is joining Jupiter
Tyndall where he will replace Leonard Licht as vice chairman, following
the latter's retirement. Jupiter Tyndall was acquired by Commerzbank in
1995.

Bernays will be replaced by Peter Axten. Axten, who is a former Hill
Samuel employee, is currently chief executive of LIM. For the moment,
at least, it looks as if the merger option is being taken but, as
usual, time will tell.

Meanwhile there has been little progress made in resolving the future
of Gartmore, following Banque Indosuez's decision to sell its 75
percent stake in the company. The bank released a statement in January
to confirm that the sale would still go ahead and that a number of
parties were still interested in acquiring the shares. There had been
speculation that the sale could have been called off following
personnel changes at Indosuez.

It is understood, however, that a number of potential purchasers, such
as BAT, NatWest and Prudential, are no longer interested in the company
which is valued at around #370 million. Bankgesellschaft from Berlin
and NationsBank from the US are apparently still interested.
NationsBank already has what is essentially a call option on part of
Gartmore's equity.

Following the fall-out at Dunedin Fund Managers (see FI 12 and 13) Bank
of Scotland, the company's majority shareholder, is rumoured to be
ready to put its stake onto the market. An announcement is expected
shortly. Before the management defections, Dunedin was thought to be
worth around #100 million.

As usual there is no shortage of potential purchasers. All the large UK
fund managers are thought to be interested in the company. In practice,
however, it may be difficult to bring the shares to market. Despite
Standard Life owning a significant proportion of the minority shares,
as well as 34 percent of the Bank of Scotland, the investment trusts
managed by Dunedin also retain significant holdings. This could yet
constitute an effective poisonous pill.

One acquisition which has been completed was the purchase of CIN
Management (CINMan) by Friends Provident, a UK mutual life company. The
purchase will make Friends Provident the tenth-largest UK fund manager,
with total funds under management of #32 billion.

"The acquisition will take Friends Provident quantum leaps forward to
its long-term goal of becoming one of the small band of financial
services companies which will dominate the sector in the new
millennium," said its chief executive Michael Doerr.

CINMan's main business focus is the management of the UK coal
industry's pension schemes. The sale of the company to a private
institution was almost a logical consequence of the UK government's
decision to privatise the coal sector. CINMan currently has around #17
billion under management.

AGROBANKA TO BUY CREDITANSTALT INVESTMENT

AUSTRIAN bank Creditanstalt is to sell Creditanstalt Investment, its
Prague-based fund management business, to Agrobanka, a privately-owned
Czech bank.

Agrobanka has also made an offer to acquire Creditanstalt Czech
Investment Fund (CCIF), one of the two funds which Creditanstalt
established in the wake of the Czech privatisation programmes.
Agrobanka is making an offer of CK780 ($25) per share to CCIF's foreign
shareholders, which own around 14 percent of the fund.

Agrobanka's initiative is the latest in a series of changes in the
Czech fund management sector which has seen local banks assume a much
greater role. (See next month's FI for a full analysis.)

FRENCH TAX CHANGES

IN CONTRAST to other European markets, where governments are trying to
encourage long-term savings, the French government is attempting to
reverse the process. Capital gains realised throughout 1996 on the sale
of Sicav monetaires - or money market funds - will be exempted from
inclusion in newly introduced tax allowances, provided the proceeds are
invested in residential property.

Until the end of June capital gains will also be exempt from tax,
provided that a minimum of Fr3,000 ($600) of the proceeds is spent on
household appliances and electrical goods. Penalty and tax regimes on
other forms of long-term saving are also being changed to encourage
greater spending.

These measures reflect the attempts being made by the government to
reboot an ailing economy through boosting consumer spending. With
confidence low about future prospects, consumers have been reluctant to
spend. Whether the strategy works - much less results in an increase in
expenditure on French manufactured goods - remains to be seen.

TAX EXEMPTION EXTENDED

FOLLOWING an amendment to the Companies Act 1990, the range of tax
exempt investment vehicles has been extended to cover closed-end
investment companies. Although closed-end unit trusts have been
available within Dublin's International Financial Services Centre
(IFSC) since 1992, the closed-ended investment company permits for the
first time the establishment in a corporate form of certain types of
funds that are generally unsuitable for open-ended vehicles.

ITALY:  MUTUAL FUND MARKET

THE MUTUAL fund sector experienced a net inflow of funds in December
1995, according to Assogestioni, an industry trade association. This
reversed a year-long trend of net outflows.

Commentators claim that this marks a change in investor sentiment. The
prospect of falling interest rates, the recognition of real value in
the stockmarket, and the hope that things cannot get any worse are all
generating greater optimism about prospects for the new year.

At year-end, despite the launch of 103 new funds, the value of funds
under management in mutual funds was 3 percent below the figure for
December 1994. Overall, the 457 mutual funds operating within the
country closed the year with L124 billion under management.

FLEMINGS USES INTERNET

FLEMINGS Fund Management (Luxembourg) SA is claiming to be the first
Luxembourg-based investment company to promote its funds on the
Internet.

Flemings's Internet pages contain details of Flemings's product range,
daily fund prices, performance history, Flemings's history, stock
market bulletins, new product and service information, and contact
details.

"Our research indicates a strong correlation between our existing
customer base and the current European Internet user profile, and we
are convinced that Internet will become one of the most important
communication links of the future," said Steen Steinke, the company's
European sales and marketing director."With connections increasing at
the rate of 13 percent per month, organisations such as ours miss
opportunities like this at their peril."

ROBECO 1995 RESULTS

ROBECO Group benefited from a more benign market environment during
1995 to increase assets under management from $39.5 billion to $46.4
billion.

Bond markets around the world recovered from the falls sustained in
1994. This was reflected in the performance of the group's bond and
fixed-income funds, which all achieved solid gains. Rorento, the
group's tax-exempt global bond fund, achieved the best return - its
share price rising by 23.1 percent. Overall, Robeco's bond funds had
total assets under management of $11.5 billion.

Although equity market behaviour was less consistent, the Netherlands
market performed strongly, and this was reflected in the performance of
the group's equity funds. RG Hollands Bezit turned in a pre-tax
(dollar) return of 25.2 percent. Robeco and Rolinco, the group's
flagship funds, which invest on a global basis, generated total returns
of 15.7 percent and 17.3 percent respectively.

Regional funds, however, especially those with an emerging market
slant, performed poorly. Equity funds accounted for $11.2 billion of
funds under management.

RUSSIA:  BARINGS OPTIMISTIC

THE SUCCESS achieved by the Communists in the December Duma elections
had largely been discounted in advance by the markets, according to
Barings Asset Management, which manages the London-listed Barings
Emerging Europe Investment Trust.

Despite President Yeltsin's response, which has seen him replace
members of his government with hardliners, Barings is still optimistic
about the future, pointing out that this strategy may enhance the
chances of a reformist victory in the June presidential elections. As a
consequence, they remain overweight in Russian securities.

STAFF CHANGES AT CREDIS AND INTRAG

CHANGES may be afoot in the way mutual funds are distributed, following
the defection of prominent marketing executives from two of the major
banks to non-bank institutions. At present, as is the case in most
mainland European markets, distribution is almost monopolised by the
banks.

At Credis, the fund management arm of Credit Suisse, Andereas Spahni
has left to join an independent fund brokerage called AWF. Spahni
played a key role in establishing Credis as an independent business.
Prior to his departure he was working on a long-term distribution plan
for the company.

Meanwhile over at Intrag, the fund management arm of UBS, Reto Diezi
has left to join Zurich Insurance, where he is expected to establish a
mutual fund distribution company. At Intrag, Diezi had responsibilities
for strategy and marketing third-party products.

NEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR GERMAN FUNDS

The Third Financial Markets Promotion Law is one of a number of new
laws which are slowly transforming the Germany's financial marketplace.
Laura Covill reports

GREATER flexibility for their domestic funds industry will be the main
thrust of Germany's Third Financial Markets Promotion Law, the latest
in a series of deregulatory reforms.

Juergen Stark, state secretary in the Ministry of Finance, has promised
that the law will provide new opportunities for mutual fund companies
in Germany, especially as far as new products are concerned.
Anticipating the proposals, many German fund companies are already
working on new products which will be unveiled as soon as the
provisions become law in the spring of 1997.

In response to a long list of demands presented by the Association of
German Investment Companies (BVI), the industry's main representative
body, the finance ministry has already pledged that draft legislation
will include the following innovations.

The opportunity for German investment companies to provide custody
services to third parties. At present, German investment companies can
only offer custody services to purchasers of their funds. This can
cause problems for investors who deal with several companies who must
open - and pay fees on - several custody accounts. Some investors have
circumvented this by going to a Luxembourg-based bank, so helping to
undermine German-based business. "The German investors who went to
Luxembourg to get custody services would be able to think about coming
back," said Manfred Laux, managing director of BVI. The change would
also open a new source of earnings for the fund companies.

Greater opportunities for mutual funds to invest in liquid instruments,
especially money market funds. The range of liquid assets in which
funds can invest is still restricted to bank deposits, certificates of
deposit and certain classes of short-term paper issued by public sector
institutions. The money-market fund sector, which has grown to around
DM100 billion ($66 billion) in the 18 months since its introduction,
offers an alternative with the same high degree of liquidity and
yields.

Equal rights for closed-end funds on depreciation, so that they can
benefit from the special depreciation rates available in eastern
Germany and real-estate markets. There would also be tax advantages for
retail investors.

Approval for open-ended real estate funds to purchase shares in
property companies and thus invest more easily in non-German
real-estate markets. This would reflect a growing willingness on the
part of real estate companies to invest in the London and Netherlands
property markets, which offer relatively low currency risks and provide
better yields than the German market. This change would also allow
German mutual funds to avoid higher taxes on foreign investment through
acquiring property holdings indirectly.

Fixed-term equity funds, with guaranteed returns. One of the finance
ministry's objectives is to encourage share ownership by individuals in
Germany. Fixed-term equity funds may encourage private investors to
invest in equities as part of a retirement savings plan. Banks have
begun to market equity funds for this purpose. Commerzbank, for
example, recently launched an advertising campaign which described
equity funds as the "fourth pillar" of an optimal retirement plan
(after the state pension, company pension, and life assurance).
Investment companies contend that the idea would be more attractive if
there was a definite wind-up date and some form of guaranteed returns.

Laux points out that fixed-term bond funds were an immediate success
when they were introduced to the German market in 1985. "There appears
to be no pressing reason for the concept to be restricted to bond
funds," he said. "On the contrary, fixed equity funds would surely be
appropriate vehicles in which to attract a large number of new
investors because - given the right hedging instruments - the investor
will get at the very least his own investment back."

Approval for funds to invest in OTC options. This is a prerequisite for
fixed-term equity funds. "The indications are that OTC options will be
allowed and thus we expect limited-term equity funds to come too," Laux
said.

However, Laux is less optimistic about the prospects for a "general
licence" which would allow mutual funds to invest across the range of
derivatives. Under the current system, each type of derivative
instrument has to be approved separately.

"The existing legislation is too inflexible and sometimes
inappropriate, so that some of the more recent innovations are not
covered, thus frustrating the introduction of many interesting fund
structures," Laux said. "If new instruments have to be expressly
sanctioned by law, then there is always the possibility of a long-time
lag between their introduction and when they can by used by mutual
funds."

But Laux has been told by the finance ministry that the "general
licence" will probably not be granted until the Fourth Financial
Markets Promotion Act, which is due in about 1998. The same goes for
the BVI's final demand of approval for feeder funds. "I can't rule out
that feeder funds won't be passed until the Fourth Act, but they are
not our highest priority, he said. "I think the ministry wants to wait
for further discussion (of this) at European level. It doesn't want to
anticipate European law."

Nevertheless, Laux is not unhappy with the results achieved from his
lobbying efforts. "We know that the Finance Ministry has problems
because of a lack of qualified personnel. You can't get everything done
at once."

The BVI chief is in no doubt about Bonn's"strong political will to help
Germany become one of Europe's leading investment centres. The Finance
Ministry is going to great lengths to promote Germany as a financial
marketplace," he said.

Though German investment companies are already creating new products in
anticipation of the new legislation, delays are likely. The Third
Financial Promotion Act will also encapsulate EU directives on
securities and bank capital adequacy, and they must be implemented by
the end of the year if Germany is to avoid sanction.

Moreover, securities and capital adequacy take priority at the finance
ministry as well as with the regulators. So while the Third Act will be
passed in the autumn, the sections relating to mutual funds will
probably not reach the statute book until the spring of 1997.

FEDERATED'S OFFSHORE DRIVE

The US's eleventh-largest fund provider, Federated Investors, has
recruited a "dream team" to aggressively target international markets.
Sterett Pope reports

FEDERATED Investors of Pittsburgh has launched an ambitious global
investment strategy designed to catapult Federated to the top ranks of
US international fund investors. The firm will launch five new
international equity funds this quarter, which it will market to both
US and European investors. It will also introduce a convertible
currency product for its three off-shore money market funds, which are
primarily marketed to institutions in Europe.

The eleventh-largest US fund provider, with some $65 billion in total
assets in over 250 funds, Federated now has just under $400 million in
international assets. In the last five years, international assets have
grown from 1 percent to 5 percent at Federated, but the firm hopes that
figure will move to 20 percent by the end of the decade.

Given the recent US boom in international investing, and the imperative
of diversification, Federated sees its new global push as a necessary
step toward its goal of controlling 5 percent of the $3 trillion to $4
trillion US fund industry by the year 2000. At the end of November,
Federated had $63.8 billion in assets, or 2.3 percent of the $2.78
trillion US fund market, according to the Investment Company Institute
in Washington.

Federated now manages two international funds and a global utility
fund, but in December, Federated registered five equity funds with the
US Securities and Exchange Commission. It expects them to be approved
by February. The new funds include a European growth fund, an
Asia-Pacific growth fund, a Latin America growth fund, an emerging
markets fund and an international small company fund. The new products
will bring Federated's total global offerings to eight and its
international equity funds to six.

Last April, Federated created a new unit, Federated Global Research
Corp., in New York, under the direction of international fund pioneer
Henry Frantzen. Frantzen, 52, who brings 25 years' experience in
international fund investing to Federated, previously worked for Brown
Brothers Harriman, Oppenheimer Management and Yamaichi Capital
Management.

Frantzen began his money management career in 1971 at the $30 billion
College Retirement Equities Fund (CREF). He built CREF's international
department from scratch, increasing the fund's international assets to
$6 billion between 1978 and 1987. During that period, he achieved
annual returns of nearly 23 percent, beating the Lipper international
fund average by almost 3 percentage points.

At Federated Global, Frantzen received a mandate to recruit a "dream
team" of international managers. The idea was to create an investment
management capability that could launch and manage any and all
international funds demanded by Federated clients.

In September, the new unit began by replacing Fiduciary Trust as
adviser for Federated's International Fund, which had $196 million in
assets under management at the end of 1995. (Federated also manages an
International Income Fund with $184 million and a Global Utility Fund
with $11 million in international assets.)

In the seven months following Federated Global's launch last April,
Frantzen hired 25 staff for his New York office, including 12 portfolio
managers, several coming from CREF.

To give his new team full international flexibility, Frantzen has
organised Federated Global along lines of geographic specialisation:
for Asia and Latin America, Federated Global hired Alexandre de
Bethman, 33, away from CREF; Mark Kopinski, 39, from Twentieth Century
Mutual Funds for Asia Pacific investing; Frank Semack, 43, from Omega
Advisors for European equities; John Kowit, 50, from John Hancock
Advisors for international fixed-income securities; Tracy Stouffer from
CREF for small-mid cap international equities; and Jolanta Wysocka from
Parametric Portfolio Associates/PIMCO Advisors LP for emerging market
securities.

Given the collapse of the peso in late 1994, early 1995 might have
seemed like an inappropriate time to launch Federated Global in New
York. But nine months later, following an excellent year on the US
stock market and two lacklustre years for international equities, US
investors are looking overseas for investment opportunities, and
Frantzen believes he is launching his new line of international equity
products at just the right time.

"The general overlay for the entire investment world today is low
inflation, particularly in Latin America," Frantzen explained. "The
trend is being driven by the entry into the world market of 900 million
Indians who have become capitalists and 1.2 billion Chinese. The
opening of Russia and its extraordinary natural resources is another
factor."

Frantzen's enthusiasm is so global that he is hard-pressed to isolate
particularly promising regional investing opportunities for 1996. Latin
America looks very good, with inflation down from 428 percent in 1993
to an estimated 33 percent in 1995 and a projected 19 percent in 1996.
The regional as a whole is reaping the rewards of democratisation and
the continuing reduction of import barriers. Brazil's import tariffs
fell from 70 percent in 1989 to 14 percent in 1995, for example.

"In Latin America, we believe the markets are presenting us exactly
with a buying opportunity," Frantzen declared. He expects Latin
America's two recessionary economies, Mexico and Argentina, to recover
by 1997. He also projects regional GDP growth at over 4 percent in
1997, up from an estimated 1996 figure of 1.3 percent.

In the Asia Pacific region, Frantzen foresees a major turnaround for
Japan, which has suffered four consecutive years of falling earnings.
But he projects these to increase by 75 percent in the fiscal year
ending in March 1996, and another 50 percent in the following fiscal
year. One of the first investment decisions Frantzen made when he took
control of the Federated International Equity Fund in September was to
shift its weighting of Japanese stocks from 18 percent to 37 percent.

Following several poor years, Frantzen believes that Asian stocks are
now relatively cheaply priced. Growth and savings rates remain
extremely robust, and continuing deregulation "in almost every country"
augurs very well for the region as a whole. But Frantzen stressed
that"we have a healthy scepticism of some of the numbers you see coming
out of China, although it is certainly a big growth area". Frantzen
expects to place major investments in India, where Federated has not
placed money so far.

Frantzen is also bullish on the European Union, where he thinks falling
interest rates, relatively high unemployment and low inflation, will
drive growth in the coming phase. He appears less enthusiastic about
eastern Europe and the Russian Federation, at least in the short term,
however.

In the US, Federated will market its five new equity offerings through
its traditional client network of broker dealers and other financial
intermediaries. The company has no direct marketing arm and relies
solely on its client network for sales. The firm will pursue a similar
strategy in Europe, where it will push its international equity
products, and particularly its Latin American investment expertise, as
European institutions generally view Latin America as the strong suit
of US international managers.

While it sees equity investing, especially in the context of
defined-contribution savings plans, as the biggest long-term
opportunity in Europe, Federated will also stress its convertible
dollar money market products.

In 1987, Federated registered two dollar-denominated money funds in the
Cayman Islands, and then redomiciled them in Dublin, after it
established an office there in 1990. It has now registered three money
market funds (with $300 million in assets) and two long-term bond funds
($100 million), all dollar-denominated, in Dublin, which it sees as a
less expensive and more flexible regulated operating environment than
Luxembourg. Federated has outsourced custody and administration to Bank
of New York's Dublin operation, which has a funds servicing joint
venture with Allied Irish Bank.

This year, Federated hopes to launch a currency product, which will
convert its dollar-denominated money market funds into 22 different
currencies, with State Street Boston handling currency swaps for the
funds.

US-managed money market products are particularly attractive to large
European banks, big US custodian institutions and US multinational
corporations in Europe, given the growing demands for money market
instruments in Germany and the UK, and the lack of fully liquid
commercial paper markets in those countries. Federated now offers
institutions in Germany, for example, an additional 1.25 points of
yield over prevailing interbank rates.

Federated's convertible approach differs from that of Fidelity
Investments, which recently launched three money market funds in
Europe, denominated separately in dollars, pounds sterling and
deutschmarks. Federated believes that its approach offers far greater
flexibility in the 15 European Union markets, combined with advantages
of scale.

As in the US, Federated will rely solely on financial intermediaries
for its retail products. The firm cited the example of Fidelity, which
attempted to market its funds directly in France in 1988, and then
relaunched its funds marketing through a wholesale distribution
strategy last year.

In France, Federated is targeting large domestic banks, which still
control some 50 percent of retail funds distribution, as well as
brokers and insurance firms. In 1994, Federated began to advertise in a
range of French and international financial publications, including
Global Investor, La Tribune des Fosses, and Le Figaro.

MAGELLAN MOVES TO STATE STREET

IN LATE December, Fidelity Investments awarded State Street Boston with
a custody contract for its flagship Magellan fund, which has $53
billion in assets. State Street will replace Brown Brothers Harriman,
which had been Magellan's custodian since the fund's inception in 1963.

State Street had previously administered four small Fidelity funds with
total assets of some $4 billion. The bank's custody clients also
include Alliance Capital, Merrill Lynch, GT Capital and Invesco.

The addition of the largest US equity fund could provide State Street
with up to $10 million in additional fee revenue, where the bank
charges two basis points on assets under custody. The bank is already
the world's largest fund custodian with some $2.3 trillion in assets
under custody at the end of 1995, up 32 percent from the previous year.
(Assets under management in 1995 stood at $226 billion, up 41 percent
from 1994.) State Street reported total 1995 fee revenue of $297
million, or 73 percent of total revenues.

In late December, State Street announced the formation of a new custody
unit, which will unite all of the bank's custody operations, including
line and support areas and State Street's corporate systems and
technology group. The unit will be run by David Spina, whom State
Street promoted to president and chief operating officer in December.

MORE US FUNDS UP FOR SALE

CLAYTON DUBILIER & RICE, a New York leveraged-buyout firm, has hired
investment bank Goldman Sachs to sell Van Kampen/American Capital, an
asset management firm with $55 billion in assets under management,
including $37.8 billion in mutual funds. Analysts said the firm could
fetch up to $1 billion.

In late 1992, Clayton Dubilier bought Van Kampen Merritt of Chicago
from Xerox for $415 million, and later merged the asset manager with
American Capital Management & Research, which it bought in mid-1994
from Travelers for $430 million. The combination of the two groups,
which sell their funds only through broker-dealers, was intended to
complement Van Kampen's bond-heavy product line with American Capital's
stock funds.

But the combined assets of the two firms have lost market share,
falling from 1.52 percent of the US funds market to 1.37 percent in the
two years ending in the third quarter of 1995, according to Financial
Research Corp. in Chicago. While Van Kampen's municipal bond speciality
has lost its appeal due to the global bond correction in 1993 and more
recent expectations of US tax reform, American Capital's equity
offerings have failed to post the high returns that attract
performance-hungry US investors.

Meanwhile, star manager Michael Price has also hired Goldman Sachs for
the purpose of selling his money management firm, Heine Securities of
Short Hills New Jersey, which owns the $13 billion Mutual Series fund
group. Heine, whose accumulation of Chase Manhattan stock in early 1995
pushed the bank to merge with Chemical Banking last year, wants to sell
out so that he can"personally rattle the cages of stodgy companies",
according to sources quoted in Business Week in early January.

But Price's investment savvy is seen as Mutual Series's greatest
strength, and some investment bankers believe his fund group could
fetch $400 million if he continues to manage its assets -as much as
double the price Heine Securities might get if he leaves.

STATE STREET ENTERS BENEFITS OUTSOURCING

IN EARLY December, State Street Boston formed a joint venture with
Washington consultancy Watson Wyman Worldwide to provide "total
benefits outsourcing" to corporate clients.

The move is primarily intended to support State Street's
defined-contribution pension, or 401(k), business, by allowing the bank
to offer its pension clients additional employee services. State
Street's cross-town 401(k) rival Fidelity Investments launched an
in-house employee benefits unit early in 1995.

Whereas defined-contribution pension plans allow corporate clients to
dispense with investment risk and all pension servicing duties, "total
benefits outsourcing" allows them to dispense with health insurance
administration and other employee services. Employees and retirees of
corporations using such a service receive convenient and integrated
service through a single toll-free telephone number.

Through its new venture with Watson Wyatt, State Street hopes to
attract more corporate pension clients and fend off the competition of
insurance firms who are leveraging their mutual fund and 401(k)
operations with integrated health insurance services.

Watson Wyatt has been in the benefits outsourcing business since 1991
and now serves some 3 million employees from US firms such as Nynex,
Rockwell International and Westinghouse. The alliance will also allow
State Street to enter the benefits outsourcing business with a full
benefits technology infrastructure in place.

State Street is now the third-largest 401(k) provider in the US, after
mutual fund giants Fidelity and Vanguard Group (which together account
for some 20 percent of the entire US defined-contribution pension
market). According to Cerulli Associates in Boston, State Street
managed $28.2 billion in 401(k) assets at the end of the third quarter
of 1995, or 4.7 percent of the total market.

GIT POSTS PORTFOLIO ON INTERNET

IN WHAT may be the most detailed disclosure initiative ever by a fund
firm, GIT Investment Funds of Arlington, Virginia has begun posting the
complete portfolios of four of its equity funds on the Internet and
updating them daily.

GIT, which manages some $220 million in stock, bond and money market
funds, plans to post daily portfolios updates for its nine other
no-load funds as well. Investors who wish to follow GIT's portfolio
postings can access the firm's home page on the World Wide Web at
http://www.gitfunds.com.

At present, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requires
fund companies to disclose their full portfolios only twice a year. The
agency also requires all funds to report daily changes in their net
asset value, meaning that they must already calculate the value of
their portfolios on a daily basis.

But the SEC is now considering a proposal to require money market funds
to disclose their holdings quarterly, and has asked for industry
comment on whether more frequent portfolio disclosure would help
investors. The advantages of more frequent portfolio disclosure were
highlighted in early December, when managers of Fidelity's flagship
Magellan fund were caught publicly praising securities they were in the
process of selling.

The Investment Company Institute (ICI), a funds trade group in
Washington, has opposed further disclosure on the grounds that it would
harm shareholders by adding a needless expense to fund management and
would reveal trading strategies to competitors. The ICI believes daily
disclosure would be especially burdensome for large fund families and
would hurt firms that must make big trades over a number of days to
avoid market turbulence.

Some fund executives have argued that GIT's daily disclosure policy is
relatively easy for a small firm, and serves primarily as a marketing
tool for attracting investor interest.

But GIT executive vice-president Charles Tennes responded that daily
disclosure serves the interests of his firm's shareholders by allowing
them to scrutinise the company's statements and strategies more closely
by evaluating them against its managers' market moves. Tennes also said
competitors cannot take advantage of disclosures of trades made the
previous day.

FIDELITY LAUNCHES JAPANESE FUND

FIDELITY Investments has launched its first domestic mutual fund for
Japanese investors, the Fidelity Japan Open-End Fund, making Fidelity
the first US firm to offer Japanese investors a yen-denominated
investment trust.

The fund was launched in late November, three weeks after Fidelity
received an investment trust licence from the Japanese government. It
is being marketed to Japanese institutions and individual investors by
Nomura Securities, which raised $400 million for the fund before the
initial offer period closed on December 20.

Fidelity said that over the next several years, it plans to launch a
variety of new Japanese investment trusts with different investment
objectives.

Fidelity's new investment trust will seek to achieve long-term capital
growth, using a bottom-up investment style. The fund's prospectus
requires that 65 percent of assets be invested in Japanese equities.
Fidelity named Shigeki Makino, who has managed the US-based Fidelity
Japan Fund since 1994, as the manager of the new investment trust.

Fidelity is positioning the new fund as a long-term investment vehicle
and has given it an unusual structure: the fund will be closed for the
first year, and will impose a 1 percent fee on redemptions in the
second and third years.

Fidelity is the second US firm to receive a Japanese investment trust
licence, following Morgan Stanley, which got its licence in October and
plans to launch a Japanese investment trust shortly. In addition, four
non-US foreign firms - SBC Warburg, Jardine Fleming, Schroders and
Invesco - have received licences and launched Japanese investment
trusts.

The new launches come at a time when Japanese investors are beginning
to look to foreign firms for superior investment returns, given the
relatively poor performance of domestically managed funds. But the
Japanese market presents foreign fund providers with some distribution
challenges.

Investment trusts are sold in Japan only on commission by
broker-dealers, a highly concentrated channel that forces foreign funds
to compete with the house products of distributors.

SMALL CAN BE BEAUTIFUL

Hong Kong has had a dreadful time since the boom of 1993. For one small
new investment partnership, however, falling markets have provided new
opportunities. Noel Fung reports

VALUE PARTNERS may be just a small Hong Kong-based fund management
boutique. But it beat the rest of the pack by grabbing the award for
best performing Hong Kong equity manager last year.

It managed to lose less money than its competitors in 1994, probably
the worst year experienced by the Hong Kong market since 1982.
According to Micropal, its flagship "A" fund fell by 11.9 percent
compared with the 30 percent sustained by the "average" fund manager
and the 31 percent fall experienced by the Hang Seng Index.

Value Partners has a single mission - value investing in Asia and
especially in Hong Kong. The key to its performance to date has been to
be unconventional. "We typically invest in weird and unpopular stocks
which people despise," said Cheah Cheng Hye, Value Partners's managing
director.

It considers itself an investment company which uses a distinct
bottom-up approach to identify undervalued companies rather than simply
following overall market trends.

Indeed Value Partners sees itself as something of an investment
pawnshop, soaking up stocks which sellers are desperate to dump. Shares
are sometimes disposed of almost discriminately by "top-down" and
"momentum" players desperate to exit the market at almost any price.
Value Partners will be only too happy to buy these stocks at bargain
basement prices and wait for the recovery, both in earnings and from
the recovery of stock prices.

Cheah Cheng Hye, a former financial journalist, has also been the Asia
head of research for Morgan Grenfell, the UK investment bank now owned
by Deutsche Bank. He quit the bank early in 1993 to establish a fund
management company with Yeh V-Nee, an executive director of Hsin Chong
International, a Hong Kong-listed construction company. Value Partners
was the result.

The ownership of the company is split three ways between Cheah Cheng
Hye, Yeh V-Nee and Holding Capital Group, a US-based association
comprised of businessmen, professionals and corporations, with offices
in New York and Florida.

Currently Value Partners operates with just six staff, including Cheah
and two analysts. "We rely exclusively on our own research to generate
stock selections," said Cheah. It searches for "bombed out stocks",
that is stocks where all the bad news has been fully discounted by the
market.

Investors in the "A" fund are typically US and Switzerland-based
investment professionals. The minimum investment is $100,000. To date
the fund has $32 million under management.

In addition to the "A" fund, Value Partners manages a number of
segregated portfolios for institutional investors and high net worth
individuals mainly drawn from the US.

The company's non-conformist style runs further than stockpicking,
however. Its own capital is also invested in the"A" fund. If its
clients lose, it will lose twice over. Not only will its fees - which
are performance-related - suffer. It will also lose its own capital.

JAPAN:  YEAR OF THE RAT

YATAKA NAKAI, an analyst at Daiwa Securities, is using more
unconventional criteria to predict Japanese market sentiment. He claims
that the start of the Chinese new year on February 19 is particularly
auspicious as it will usher in the Year of the Rat.

Mr Nakai has studied the links between the Japanese stock market and
the 12 animal symbols of the Chinese Zodiac. The average increase
sustained in the Nikkei Index during the Year of the Rat, which has
occurred three times since the end of World War 2, has been 54.6
percent. This tops the performance league table. The pig, rabbit, snake
and monkey years follow, with the ox right at the bottom of the heap.

TAIWAN:  TAX CHANGES

THE TAIWAN stockmarket, which performed poorly during 1995 as a result
of political worries, has been hit further by the government's decision
to reimpose capital gains tax on stocks and shares. A 14 percent tax
will be on imposed on capital gains realised by institutional, retail
and foreign investors. To encourage long-term investment, however, the
plan offers a preferential tax rate on capital gains realised on stocks
held for more than one year.

The re-introduction of capital gains tax, which was abolished in 1990,
has stunned many observers. Although the tax was first proposed by the
Ministry of Finance in January 1994, it was expected that no action
would be taken until after the presidential election in March.

through difficult times. Jean Claude Broustra reports

THOUGH 1995 was not the most auspicious year for French fund managers,
this did not prevent Cortal, a bank, brokerage and investment house
which distributes exclusively through direct media, from making further
progress.

During the course of the year it increased funds under management by
Fr1.1 billion ($220 million) to Fr17.5 billion, as well as expanding
its customer base. At the end of 1995 it was servicing 171,000
customers, a 10 percent increase on the previous year. Of this total
136,000 were "exclusive" to Cortal. The remainder were introduced by
its business partners elsewhere within the Paribas and Compagnie
Bancaire groups, which it is part of.

Cortal's vigorous expansion over the last 18 months is mainly due to
the speed at which it has espoused discount broking, still something of
a novelty within the French market. Its discount broking service, or
"Centrale des Placements", which was introduced in mid-1994, enables
Cortal customers to buy directly any shares or bonds listed on the
Paris stock exchange. They can also purchase Sicavs (open-end funds)
managed by any French bank, insurance company or investment house.
Overall, dealing costs and commissions are substantially lower than
those offered by conventional brokers.

The remarkable success of the Centrale des Placements shows a clear
demand for this type of facility. In just a year, the volume of funds
Cortal manages through this service almost doubled and now accounts for
Fr2.6 billion in total. Of this Fr1.8 billion emanates from securities
(shares and bonds), and Fr0.8 billion from Sicavs managed by other
asset management institutions.

But the true extent of Centrale des Placements's popularity is
illustrated by the fact that it currently accounts for almost 70
percent of all new investments purchased through Cortal. 0f these the
vast majority are for stocks and shares. These account for 50 percent
of the 70 percent. The remainder come from external Sicavs.

The main reason for the success of discount brokerage is its fee and
commission structure. Unlike other bank brokerage operations such as
Credit Lyonnais (Fr63) and Societe Generale (Fr108), Centrale des
Placements doesn't impose a fixed minimum brokerage charge. Although
the minimum fee per order charged by Cortal (Fr46) is higher than that
of Societe Generale (Fr30) - though still lower than that of Credit
Lyonnais (Fr52.28) - commission rates (exclusive of tax) are
considerably less at Cortal, especially where large transactions are
involved.

Societe Generale charges a standard 1.3 percent on all transactions,
with Credit Lyonnais charging 1.22 percent for transactions below
Fr10,000, and 1.01 percent for anything above this figure. Cortal's
customers have to pay 1.15 percent on transactions up to Fr100,000,
0.75 percent on the part between Fr100,000 and Fr500,000, and only 0.1
percent on anything above this. This "sliding" fee scale was introduced
quite recently to attract big clients.

Custody fees are also lower at Cortal than at other brokerages. The
annual fixed commission per stock (including tax) is Fr38.18 at Societe
Generale, Fr33.56 at Credit Lyonnais, but only Fr15 at Cortal. Societe
Generale charges commission of just over 0.2 percent (including tax) on
the value of each portfolio held and Credit Lyonnais 0.19 percent.
Cortal only charges 0.15 percent.

In addition to the Centrale des Placements, Cortal offers its customers
a range of other investment services. These include Sicavs, managed on
its behalf by Credit du Nord, by Cardif, another Paribas subsidiary,
and by Paribas itself.

Cortal offers a range of fund money market, bond and equity Sicavs
which incorporate the entire maturity spectrum: short-term (investments
of less than two years); medium-term (between three and five years);
and long-term (more than five years).

Short-term consists of: the Compte Optimal and the Compte a Terme.
Medium-term consists of: Obligations Convertibles, France Rendement,
Mone 40, Interets Trimestries, Eurocap, France 40, Parfrance and
Objectif Monde. Long-term consists of: Cortal Pierre, Cortal
Capitalisation, Cortal Croissance Garantie and Contrat Majeur.

Among the new services which Cortal has introduced to its customers
since is Service Optimal Placements. This keeps customers informed,
through diagrams, graphs and pie charts, about the composition and
performance of their investment portfolios. The system used is known as
the "tableau de bord de l'epargne". It also provides customers with
expert personal advice, a regular assessment of the performance of
their Sicavs, and advice about establishing a personalised savings and
investment strategy of their own.

Another service called Contrat Majeur Independant Retraite, which also
dates from 1994, is targeted at members of the liberal professions and
other groups to build up a complementary tax-free retirement pension
within the framework of the Madelin law on social protection.

A third, known as the Compte a Terme Cortal, which was launched in
1995, offers guaranteed returns to investors. The return becomes
progressively higher in proportion to the size of the investment and
the length of time it is held for.

At its inception the Compte a Terme entitled the holders to a tax
allowance of Fr8,000. This has been withdrawn for 1996, but investors
still benefit from a more favourable tax regime. Nonetheless, with
interest rates beginning to fall in France, this option is less
attractive than before.

The most recent product launch was France Rendement, a Sicav that
invests exclusively in French government securities. It replaced a
similar product called Rendement Trimestriel. A major difference
between this and the new product is that Rendement Trimestriel provided
only one distribution option - a straightforward payment of dividends.
The new product allows dividends to be reinvested or capitalised.

Cortal also has operations in France and Luxembourg. Cortal Bank
Luxembourg is a subsidiary of the Cortal and Paribas Luxembourg banks.
It was established two years ago and offers a wide range of investment
products. Its main service is the Compte Optimal International. This
offers deposit accounts in a variety of currencies, and personalised
portfolio management.

Since 1992, Cortal has also had a 49 percent minority share in the
Cortal Bank Belgium. This also offers a wide range of investment and
financial services at very low prices. The majority shareholder is
Paribas.

WHY VALUE BEATS GROWTH

Fund managers seeking consistent above-average returns should adopt a
value-focused investment strategy, according to research carried out by
David Umstead of Boston International Advisors. Ian Orton reports

THE RELATIVE merits of value and growth-orientated investment styles
have generated considerable debate among both academics and
professionals. For the moment, at least, it would appear that
proponents of the value-orientated school would appear to hold the
advantage, especially in the US.

Apart from the impressionistic evidence provided by well-known value
investors such as Warren Buffet and Peter Lynch, there is also a
substantial body of statistical evidence to confirm the view that a
value strategy will outperform a growth-orientated strategy over the
medium to long term. The value-growth spread associated with the S&P
500 index, for example, has averaged 320 basis points per year over the
last 20 years.

According to David Umstead, managing director of Boston International
Advisors, similar results can be obtained in non-US markets. He has
developed a set of value and growth indices for 20 equity markets in
Europe and the Pacific Rim and tracked their performance over the
period 1974 to 1994. The system is known as the BIA Europe/Pacific
Value, Growth and Market Indexes.

The results, which he presented at the recent Global Investment
Management '95 Conference, are emphatic. "A dollar invested in the BIA
Europe/Pacific Value Index on December 31 1974 would have grown to
$24.96 by December 31 1994 - an unhedged annualised rate of return of
17.5 per year over the 20-year period. By contrast, a dollar invested
in the BIA Europe/Pacific Growth Index grew to only $11.11, an average
return of 12.8 percent. The value index outperforms the growth index by
an average of 470 basis points per year. Furthermore the spread is
quite consistent."

Examining the year-by-year performance of the two indices, Umstead
found that the value index outperformed the growth index in 16 years
out of 20 and produced lower volatility. The value index standard
deviation is 17.61 percent compared with 18.14 for the growth index.

The largest positive value-growth spread is 17.22 percentage points in
1988, and the largest negative is 7.13 points in 1980. The other years
with negative spreads occurred in 1984, 1986 and 1991. There is no
obvious pattern to the negative spread years. One occurred in a year
with phenomenal returns (1986), two in average years (1980 and 1991)
and one in a below-average year (1984).

To provide greater insight, Umstead has divided the geographical
components of his indices into three sub-groups: Europe; Japan; and
Pacific-ex-Japan. He found that the value-growth spread is quite
uncorrelated from region to region. Value-growth spreads are, however
much greater in Japan and the Pacific than in Europe.

The end value of 3.77 for Japan meant that the value half of the
Japanese market outperformed the growth half by nearly four to one. The
value half of the Japanese market delivered a return of 20.2 percent a
year over the last 20 years, compared with 12.5 percent achieved by the
growth half.

Umstead has identified five reasons why value beats growth. The first
two are consistent with rational behaviour and simply maintain that
investors may be concerned with attributes other than pre-tax risk and
return.

"1. Value stocks have an inferior tax status. Because of this, taxable
investors demand a higher return for value stocks.

2. Value stocks have an inferior comfort-level. This also leads to the
need for value stocks to offer a higher return."

The last three relate to various types of behavioural errors which stem
from the fact that value stocks tend to be from companies with weak
balance sheets and income statements. "3. This leads to pessimistic
extrapolations of future earnings and dividends which in turn leads to
pleasant earnings surprises.

4. The weak financial statements also lead to the conclusion that the
company is a bad company and therefore the stock is a bad investment.
This in turn also leads to pleasant surprises.

5. And finally this real financial record makes value stocks much more
susceptible to Monday morning quarterbacking, It is more difficult to
externalise blame if value stocks perform poorly."

But how do active investors identify value stocks? Umstead uses an
extremely straightforward approach when it comes to constructing his
indices. The key variables are the price-to-book ratio and market
capitalisation. Companies are ranked in ascending price-to-book ratio
until their combined capitalisation amounts to half of total market
capitalisation. These are value stocks. The remainder are growth
stocks. The process is repeated annually and the indices are
reconstructed accordingly.

Within the BIA Europe/Pacific Indices, countries are
capitalisation-weighted, as are the stocks within countries.

INDIA BECKONS

India is becoming increasingly popular as a destination for both direct
and portfolio investment. Dr Shanta Acharya reviews the government's
progress in making the country more investor-friendly

THE STRUCTURAL adjustment programme begun in July 1991 by the
government of Prime Minister Narasimha Rao has been successful in
stimulating the scope of the private sector, as well as expanding trade
and attracting foreign investment in India.

The economic liberalisation of India was initiated partly in response
to structural problems in the economy. The Indian government faced
serious fiscal and external imbalances which had generated double-digit
inflation at the beginning of the decade. Despite significant
assistance from multilateral and bilateral agreements, foreign exchange
reserves had fallen to $1 billion - or two weeks of imports - by June
1991, pushing the country to the verge of defaulting on its external
debt obligations.

The reform programme precipitated by this crisis focused on the capital
intensity of India's historical growth process and was aimed at
curtailing its dependence on the unsustainable and unproductive
expansion of the public sector. The country's relatively high
investment rate had failed to show a matching, much less a sustainable,
growth in output and employment.

The aim of India's new economic reform agenda is to reverse this
vicious cycle by policies that will usher in a virtuous cycle of growth
through higher productivity and investment.

Over the past four years, we have seen a commendable improvement in
India's current and capital external accounts, accompanied by
structural reforms. To sustain the momentum of this process requires a
concerted effort to strengthen public finances, improve investment in
infrastructure, and encourage private investment to flow into crucial
areas of the economy.

It is also of crucial importance that the reform agenda filters down to
state government level. In the next stage of reform, fiscal prudence at
the centre needs to be complemented by individual states. In this
respect the forthcoming general election will be crucial in
consolidating the success of the government's initiatives to date. The
government's consensus-building approach in instituting economic
reforms will ensure that the liberalisation process, though slow, is
also irreversible.

Capital market reforms

Mr Narasimha Rao's Congress government started to liberalise the Indian
economy with an agenda for reform that attempted to address the
structural inefficiencies that militated against investment. This
focused on trade policies, the financial sector, taxation and public
enterprises.

This has resulted in a planned transformation of the Indian capital
market to enable it to assume an integral role in the allocation of
capital within the nation's growth plans for the future. Though
frustratingly slow, change is discernible.

Policy reforms covering the free pricing of new issues, the flotation
of Euroissues, foreign institutional investment in Indian companies,
the establishment of private sector mutual funds and the privatisation
of state-owned companies are starting to have a discernible impact on
the capital market and the investment environment.

The key issue of setting up a central depository to facilitate a smooth
transfer of the ownership of shares will have a dramatic impact on
trading when it is put in place. A high level of poor delivery,
issuance of duplicate shares and problems relating to share transfer
and registration, particularly after a stock market scam in 1992,
continues to plague the market. This limits confidence in the market
mechanism.

Long-standing troubles in India regarding stockmarket infrastructure
continue to thwart portfolio investment. This has made it difficult for
foreign direct investment to flow into the country.

It is inevitable that in this process of transformation of the economy,
there have been more losers than winners. Nonetheless, it is expected
that over the next five years, the newly elected government will be
more able to address the vital issue of infrastructural constraints to
facilitate the smooth flow of capital within the economy.

Any investment decision, however, is ultimately linked to the
risk-reward ratio that the individual investor determines for himself
or is prepared to tolerate over a stipulated period. This is partly
influenced by rational expectations within an economic framework that
enables the investor to identify the opportunity early enough to use it
advantageously. The need to distinguish between the performance of the
economy and that of the stockmarket requires a high level of
discipline.

While a long-term investment horizon is always desirable, it is
especially prudent to take into account the overall valuation of the
market when swimming in the rough seas of emerging markets. Overheated
markets are best avoided. Market fundamentals are often distorted by
short-term money flows. With the increasingly international nature of
capital flows, it is vital to understand the various cycles in the
movement of funds flowing into the real economy as distinct from the
stock markets.

Volatility can provide opportunities. In illiquid markets, active
trading may not prove to be such a winning strategy, however. For those
fund managers, asset allocation strategists and individuals interested
in investing in India, the critical task is understanding the economic
opportunity and timing one's entry into the market accordingly.

Poor stock market performance

While the fundamental resilience of the Indian economy is reflected in
a series of economic data - from industrial output growth, export
performance to corporate earnings - the stockmarket has been in the
doldrums due to a lack of liquidity.

The Bombay Stock Exchange 30 Index declined about 30.7 percent in
dollar terms in 1995 but at the current level is offering investors
good value. Valuations are reasonable at 12 times March 1996 earnings,
with EPS growth of 20 percent estimated for the year to March 1997. The
impending general election, which is expected to take place in April
1996 will continue to restrain market sentiment but will also provide
good buying opportunities for the long-term investor.

The economy has responded positively to the structural adjustment
programme but macroeconomic stresses pose fresh challenges to policy.

Real GDP growth recovered from 1 percent in 1991-92 to 4.3 percent
between 1992 and 1994, and over the next two years is expected to
maintain the 6 percent achieved last year. Industrial production, after
remaining stagnant in 1991-92, recovered to grow by a modest 2.3
percent in 1992-93 before surging by 8.5 percent in 1994-95. It is
expected to rise to around 9 percent to 10 percent over the next two
years.

Exports, having declined marginally in 1991-92, rose by 20 percent in
1993-94 and by 18 percent in 1994-95, and are also expected to sustain
this pace over the next two years. Imports were severely hit by
recession and the structural adjustment plan in 1991-92. Both impacted
adversely on industrial captilisation rates, leading to a contraction
of 18.8 percent. They recovered quickly to grow by 11.9 percent in 1992-
93 and by 6.5 percent in 1993-94, before surging by a further 21.3
percent in 1994-95. Imports continue to show a strong rising trend,
reflecting the recovery of demand in the economy and are expected to
rise by 25 percent in 1995-96.

India's current account deficit also improved substantially to a mere
0.1 percent of GDP in 1993-94 and 0.7 percent of GDP in 1994-95. The
deficit is expected to rise to 1.5 percent of GDP in 1995-96 but then
recover marginally in 1996-97.

At $4.1 billion, foreign investment (of which portfolio investment was
$3.13 billion) rose sharply, resulting in a rise in the foreign
exchange reserves to $15 billion by March 1994 and $20 billion by March
1995. The subsequent slow-down in foreign investment may have been a
blessing in disguise for India's policymakers, as management of foreign
exchange reserves was posing a serious challenge.

External competitiveness was beginning to be compromised. The rupee had
been virtually pegged at 31.37 to the dollar until mid-September 1995
when the authorities allowed it to rise to 33.7. The rupee rate
currently stands at 34.5.

The monetisation of reserves has produced a sharp expansion in the
money supply. This resulted in a growth rate of 22.2 percent between
March 1993 and March 1993. Coupled with increases in administered
prices, the inflation rate rose from a low of 7 percent in mid-1993 to
10 percent in March 1994. As a consequence the real exchange rate
appreciated. With industrial recovery in place, non-oil imports started
picking up at a faster rate, and the larger current account deficit put
downward pressure on the currency, leading to the devaluation of the
rupee.

The current trade and current account deficits do not pose any real
concern as foreign exchange reserves remain high at $17.5 billion in
December 1995 or approximately six months of imports. Money supply has
been running higher than planned for some time, however. It increased
by 17.5 percent during 1994-95 but the slow-down in foreign exchange
inflows helped in restraining subsequent growth. Money supply growth is
expected to amount to 16 percent for 1995-96.

Inflationary pressures have abated in the short term. Inflation is
unlikely to rise above the 10 percent level.

While the government is vigilant and the Reserve Bank of India has
responded by maintaining tighter liquidity conditions at present, the
inflationary battle can only be won by streamlining the financial
position of the states and the public sector enterprises. The
politically sensitive reforms required to address restrictive labour
laws, formulating bankruptcy laws etc can only be dealt with after the
elections.

Increased spending in an election year has forced the government to
issue ad hoc treasury bills to fund the budget deficit, however,
despite an agreement concluded with the central bank in September 1994
to end the government's automatic access to such a form of financing by
March 1997.

The planned phasing out would have significantly enhanced monetary
control and severed the link between the expansion of bank credit and
the budget deficit. This reversal of government policy implies that the
fiscal adjustment process will take much longer than anticipated.

Stabilisation policy

In July 1991 the prime objective of the government was to stabilise the
economy. This was achieved primarily through cuts on subsidies,
defence, capital expenditure and loans to states and public
enterprises. The government deficit was reduced from 8.4 percent of GDP
in 1990-91 to 5.7 percent of GDP in 1992-93.

Much of this progress was lost in 1993-94 as the fiscal deficit
escalated to 7.7 percent of GDP against a target of 4.7 percent, as a
result of revenue shortfalls and expenditure overruns. The gross fiscal
deficit stood at 6.6 percent of GDP in 1994-95 and is unlikely to
improve significantly over the next year.

The worse-than-expected fiscal performance could undermine the
credibility of the economic programme. Interest payments claim about
half of the central government's revenues. The financial sector
reforms, as well as the declared intention of the government to reduce
its borrowing from the central bank over the next three years, will
increase the rates of interest currently being paid on government debt,
further aggravating the situation.

While the reneging of its commitment to reduce its dependency on the
central bank for cheap credit for deficit financing during this
financial year may help in the short term, it does not inspire
confidence in the government's ability to contain its fiscal imbalance.
More importantly, it tends to crowd out private sector borrowing,
investment and the subsequent growth of the real economy. In addition,
a limited fiscal adjustment has passed the burden of economic
stabilisation onto monetary policy.

The government's ability to curb expenditure is seriously hampered by
the fact that interest payments, defence, wages and grants and loans
account for almost 70 percent of non-plan government expenditure.
Furthermore, these are mandated by the constitution.

The government's expectation of economic recovery in its last budget
seems to be paying off; the fiscal deficit will be lower than last
year's level. Lower excise duties and interest rates have resulted in
recovery in household consumption as is evident from a lower savings
ratio and healthy sales in consumer durables. A rise in imports
similarly signals a recovery in private sector investment. If, however,
equity-raising by companies continues to be thwarted by market
conditions, the tide of investment into the real economy may not gather
sufficient momentum over the medium term.

Taking into account the infrastructural constraints of the economy,
however, this may not be such a problem in the short term. Besides,
constant fundraising by companies via issuance of shares not only leads
to EPS dilution but investor fatigue as well.

Boosting private investment

The fiscal deficit continues to be the government's main challenge and
a real threat to India's economic prospects. The 1996-97 budget will be
Manmohan Singh's sixth. While continuing with the structural adjustment
process, his last budget emphasised a shift towards stimulating
investment so that economic recovery would help consolidate the
government's fiscal position.

To lower the user cost of capital, import tariffs on capital goods were
significantly reduced, corporate taxes were lowered and the excise duty
regime was reformed. The removal of barriers to private sector entry in
areas previously reserved for the public sector was also initiated,
although the progress achieved has been limited.

The irony is that what has withheld private investment is not so much
the high cost of capital but high idle capacity in sectors where
private investment could have been used, such as manufacturing.

Meanwhile in areas where there is mounting urgency to expand capacity
(this is particularly the case in relation to infrastructure), a policy
and institutional framework supportive of private investment has yet to
fully evolve. While Indian firms have raised capital through GDR
issuance and convertibles, not all the amounts raised have found their
way back into the real economy to stimulate output and employment.

As these funds get invested slowly, the recovery of the economy to the
6 percent to 7 percent GDP growth level is sustainable only as long as
policy continues to attract and stimulate investment. There is little
scope for the Finance Minister to accelerate the pace of reform until
after the election.

While the budget in February will provide an excellent forum for the
Congress to highlight its achievements since 1991, politically
sensitive policy decisions cannot be taken in an election year.

Although India's saving rate is running at around 20 percent of GDP,
the heavily regulated financial system has meant that savings have not
necessarily flown into the most productive sectors. The government has
taken steps to address this issue by reducing the extent to which
commercial banks are forced to hold government debt, rationing
subsidised credit to priority sectors
- so bringing it more in line with market rates - and relaxing controls
over banks' lending decisions.

The inflationary impact of the fiscal deficit is the key issue for the
government. Thus any savings made by the central and state governments,
together with nationalised industries, will not only help contain
fiscal imbalance but reverse the anti-investment bias of the fiscal
adjustment programme. This has produced a declining trend in public
investment since 1991-92, the year in which the programme commenced.

As a result, the generation of employment opportunities by the public
sector has not been feasible and, as mentioned earlier, the private
sector has not been investing as a result of excess capacity in
industry. Gross domestic capital formation declined from 24 percent of
GDP in 1991-92 to 20.4 percent of GDP in 1993-94.

While the annual growth rate between 1981 and 1991 was 16.3 percent per
annum, gross domestic capital formation grew at only 4 percent per
annum between 1992 and 1994. The whole question of labour reform can
only be addressed seriously when the government is in a position to
generate greater investment and employment.

Investing in India

A country's economic performance is usually judged over decades rather
than the over latest business cycle. A nation's economic strength is
gauged not only by its macroeconomic performance and the profitability
of its corporations but by the overall prosperity of its people. With
population growth at 2 percent and an annualised real growth in
national income of around 4 percent since independence, growth in
Indian per-capita income has lagged behind that of other East Asian
countries.

In the Indian context, the investment case rests on the fact that past
performance provides no true guide to future prospects. India is poised
to enter a phase of sustainable GDP growth of around 6 percent to 7
percent a year. With population growth expected to decline further from
the current 1.9 percent per annum, per capita income should rise
substantially over the next decade.

With 20 percent of the world population and the sixth-largest economy,
India cannot be ignored. Her democratic ideology, the availability of
existing legal and accounting infrastructure along with the prevalence
of English as a common language provides for a level of investor
comfort not to be found in either China or Russia, for example.

No shortage of funds

THERE IS no shortage of investment funds which provide foreign
investors with equity exposure to India. According to Micropal, there
are 37 funds which invest in India and nine which invest in the Indian
sub-continent. Within the last six months these have been joined by
another six funds. With one or two exceptions most funds are
denominated in dollars.

Indian funds have benefited from the emerging markets boom of 1993.
Prior to 1993 there were only four specialist India funds, two of which
- India Fund A and India Growth Fund Inc - were managed by Unit Trust
of India, the largest domestic investment manager owned by the Indian
government. Morgan Stanley and ANZ Bank were the other institutions
which managed India funds with the India Magnum Fund and Second India
Investment Fund respectively.

Batterymarch (Commonwealth Equity Fund), Indosuez (Himalayan Fund) and
Jardine Fleming (Jardine Fleming) offered Indian Subcontinent Regional
funds.

Most management companies with global investment management pretensions
either offer India funds or are set to offer them in the near future,
although both Fidelity Investments and Templeton are currently notable
by their absence from the listings.

The largest players currently active in the market include Advantage
Advisors (India Fund Inc.), Morgan Stanley (MS India Investment Fund,
India MagnumFund and India Investment AG (with Bank Julius Baer),
Foreign & Colonial Emerging Markets (Indian Investment Company),
Indosuez (Himalayan Fund) and Jardine Fleming (JF India Fund Inc. and
JF India).

As a result of poor Indian stockmarket performance none of the funds
has provided outstanding returns, especially over the last 12 months.
The two GT funds which concentrate on the smaller company sector have
provided the best - albeit negative - returns.
