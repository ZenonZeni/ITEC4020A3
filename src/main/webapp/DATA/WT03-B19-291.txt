<p><br>
<BODY>
<FONT SIZE="+2">
The Latrobe Region comprises the Latrobe Valley, known for
its pulp, paper and electricity generating industries, and the
highly productive farmlands of South Gippsland. It is Victoria's
most important resource-rich area, and its list of assets is impressive.
</FONT>
<P>

</center>
<P>
<H2>The region:</H2>
<UL>
<LI>produces 85 per cent of the state's electricity and has brown
coal reserves of over 200,000 million tonnes;
<LI>has 63 per cent of Australia's crude oil reserves;
<LI>has nearly 34 per cent of thecountry's natural gas reserves;
<LI>is the site of the largest pulp and paper plant in Australia;
<LI>is home to the largest power-station in the Southern Hemisphere;
<LI>has 15 per cent of Victoria's water resources;
<LI>has 12 per cent of Victoria's dairy herd
<LI>has 9 per cent of Victoria's beef herd.
</UL>


<P>
The Latrobe Region has a number of substantial population
centres, including Morwell, Traralgon, Moe and Churchill in the
Latrobe Valley; Sale, next to the Gippsland Lakes; and the South
Gippsland towns of Yarram and Foster.
<P>
Three major employers operate in the region; the public electricity generation companies,
employing 2,500 people in five power stations; Australian
Paper, employing about 900 at its Maryvale mill; and Esso, employing
over 800 at Longford and on the offshore rigs in Bass Strait.

<P>
<H2>Primed for industrial diversification</H2>
<P>
The Latrobe Region is going through a period of transition.
In the past it relied on few major industries for its economic
well being, but now the economic catch cry in the region is industrial
diversification.
<P>
The catch cry is catching on. Businesses are establishing
in the region in many industries including flower growing, emu
and ostrich farming, dairy processing, education services, computer
services, image processing, energy research, transport services
and tourism.
<P>
The region offers companies the type of competitive strengths
that make it attractive to establish a business there. It has
strong energy industries based on the abundant local coal, oil
and gas, and extensive metal engineering and other manufacturing
operations. The region has an excellent infrastructure servicing
these industries.
<P>
The Latrobe Region has a highly trained workforce experienced
in all types of enterprises, from heavy industry to farming.
It has excellent communication and extensive road and rail transport
services.
<P>
<img src="gifs2/latroad.gif" align=right>
The region is intersected by the Princes Highway, giving it
direct links to both Sydney and Melbourne.  The latter is only
two hours'drive away.
<P>
Three airports: the Latrobe Valley Airfield, West Sale and
Port Welshpool, provide scheduled passenger and chartered flights
within Victoria and interstate.  Fast, efficient and frequent
passenger and freight rail services operate in the region.
<P>
Extensive water and sewerage systems can be easily augmented
for further large users.  Natural gas is available in the main
towns of Moe, Morwell, Traralgon, Sale, Churchill, Rosedale and
Trafalgar.  Industrial electricity is readily available, because
85 per cent of Victoria's electricity is generated within the
region.
<P>
Great potential exists for industry and horticulture to tap
geothermal energy.  Good quality water between 60 and 70 degrees
Celsius is available from geothermal aquifers in the Gippsland
Basin, at a depth of about 500 metres.  Warm water, a bi-product
of the Hazelwood Power Station, is already used in horticulture.

<P>
<H2>Plentiful services</H2><P>Major educational institutions including
Central Gippsland College of TAFE, East Gippsland Community College
of TAFE, Monash University Gippsland Campus and Latrobe Valley
Business College amply serve the region.  They work closely with
business and industry to design programs specifically for major
new companies setting up locally.<P>The region has excellent health
services, including four hospitals.  Recreational facilities cater
for most needs and interests, and include three provincial racecourses
at Moe, Traralgon and Sale, an all-weather athletics track in
Moe and nine golf courses.<P>The Latrobe Region supports seven newspapers,
its own commercial television stations, a major arts complex,
five art galleries, a network of state and private schools and
dozens of restaurants.  More than 1,300 retail outlets cater for
most shoppers'needs and provide services to business.<P>The rapid
development of Melbourne into Gippsland has opened up new business
opportunities, as has the growth of East Gippsland.  The west
of the region is one of the fastest growing areas in Australia.
<P>

<H2>Major projects: no problem</H2><P>The Latrobe Region has unequalled
experience in planning and accommodating major projects.  In the
past ten years the following multi-billion dollar major projects
have been accomplished:


<UL>
<LI>Blue Rock Dam
<LI>Thomson River Dam
<LI>Loy Yang Power Station
<LI>Jeeralang Power Station
<LI>Brown Coal Liquefaction (Victoria) Pilot Plant
<LI>Australian Paper, Maryvale extension
<LI>Esso Bass Strait developments
<LI>Australian Securities Commission National Data Processing
Centre
</UL>

<H2>Reliable and skilled workforce</H2>
<P>
<img src="gifs2/latcoal.gif" align=right>
The region boasts a 45,000-strong workforce that offers firms
a wide variety of skills. Over 13 per cent have vocational training,
a substantially higher proportion than the state average of 10
per cent.
<P>
Labour turnover in the manufacturing industry is perhaps the
lowest in Australia, and studies conducted by Monash University
show a productive and concentrated labour force. Many industries
operate around the clock, so shiftwork is seen locally as a normal
employment practice.
<P>
<H2>Assistance to business</H2>
<P>
Tailor-made programs and packages are available to assist
new and existing businesses wishing to establish or expand in
the area.
<P>
Services include:

<UL>
<LI>Business advice and assistance;
<LI>Assistance in identification of a suitable site and its development;
<LI>Help in organising, training, education, and selecting personnel;
<LI>Troubleshooting to ensure that the development of a new site
works for the company; and
<LI>Assistance with marketing and promotion.
</UL>
<P>
Assistance was provided to the Australian Securities Commission
(ASC), to design and construct a purpose-built building suitable
for the complex needs of an image processing operation. Appropriate
staff training and ongoing work with the organisation has helped
it run smoothly.
<P>
A five-year research program has commenced to examine the
commercial feasibility of generating power from ceramic fuel cells,
which has a potential world market estimated at billions of dollars.
Another local initiative was establishing a centre for engineering
excellence, which aims to market the region's collective expertise.

<P>
The local development body identified that water from the
Hazelwood Power Station was available and suitable for use in
horticulture, and has attracted two businesses to take advantage
of the opportunity. A 32-hectare site was secured from Generation
Victoria, and Hazelwood Flowers now produces a variety of flowers
there. Another company grows vegetables for the local and Victorian
markets.
<P>
<H2>Diversification: a top priority.</H2>
<P>
In addition to pulp and paper, oil, gas, brown coal and electricity
generation, the Latrobe Region is diversifying its economy into
new areas including data and image processing.
<P>
The establishment of the Australian Securities Commission
Information Processing Centre, employing 400 people, is a prime
example and represents the beginning of large scale information
processing in the region.
<P>
Improvements in communications systems have made it viable
for information industries such as this to locate outside capital
cities.  The ASC's data, for example, can be accessed via terminals
at any ASC Business Centre throughout Australia.
<P>
New industries can tap into the region's rich human resources.
About 95 per cent of the ASC's staff are from the Latrobe Region.
Its establishment in 1991 has helped create flow-on jobs in service
industries such as computer software and the legal profession.
Lower property costs and a sophisticated telecommunications infrastructure
also help give the Latrobe region a strategic advantage.
<P>
<H2>Opportunities based on exceptional natural advantages</H2>
<P>
Gippsland has extensive forests, both hardwood (128,600 ha)
and softwood (52,200 ha).  Opportunities for furniture production
and the expansion of pulp and paper manufacturing are being pursued
to take advantage of this valuable regional resource.
<P>
The region also has a rich agricultural heritage, the result
of natural endowments such as high quality soils and a temperate
climate that allows for a lengthy growing season.  This climate
is ideal for most agricultural ventures, including grazing, dairying
and horticulture.  Intensive agriculture provides opportunities
for value added food processing.
<P>
The Latrobe Region enjoys a significant tourism industry that
has expanded over recent years.  The region's attractions include
the Gippsland Lakes, Australia's largest inland lakes system.
The Great Dividing Range and the Strzelecki Ranges are known
for their natural, rugged beauty.  Wilson's Promontory offers
unspoilt wilderness, surf beaches and seascapes.  The 90 Mile
Beach and the river system, which includes the Thomson, Latrobe
and Macalister Rivers, are outstanding natural features.
