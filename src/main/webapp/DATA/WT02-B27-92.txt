One method that is frequently employed when working in inclusion settings is to team a child with a disability with a child without a disability as his or her helper or peer tutor. Advantages of this for the child with a disability are that it allows the child to develop trust with one particular peer, thus making it more likely that questions will be asked, and it gives the child access to someone when the teacher is unavailable. For those who have read the works of Vygotsky, this is very much in keeping with his theory of a "more capable other" to guide the child through to the next level of understanding. In addition to benefits to the student with a disability, teaming has the potential to allow the more capable peer to practice material over and over as he or she teaches the student with a disability, thus reinforcing the peer's own knowledge.<BR>
<BR>
While this may seem like a very good solution in theory, in practice there are several problems that may arise if teaming is not handled correctly. Classroom observations have shown that the more capable peer may simply gives answers to the student with a disability, or allows the student with a disability to become overly reliant on him or her (Baker, 1995; Zigmond, 1995).<BR>
<BR>
One way to more effectively use teaming involves planning and teaching prior to teaming. According to Webb, Troper, & Fall (1995), students learn best when they construct their own knowledge. Students who are given a verbally labeled explanation of how to solve a problem are much more likely to engage in actual problem solving and constructing of knowledge than students who are given the answer. Therefore, prior to teaming students, it might be best to educate all students on the most effective ways to give and receive help. Then, when the student with a disability asks a peer for assistance, the peer can help the student to understand the concept, rather than simply giving the answer. The student with a disability should then be encouraged to try the problem on his or her own.<BR>
<BR>
In addition to planning and teaching prior to teaming, then, the teacher should also be actively monitoring team interactions, and conducting periodic reviews of teaming procedures. In this way, the effects of teaming can be optimized.<BR>
