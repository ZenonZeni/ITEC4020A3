<I>Santa Barbara, CA, February 12, 1996</I> -- Computer Motion,
the world's leading supplier of medical robots, announced the
hiring of Gene Wang as the company's new Chief Executive Officer
and President. Formerly, Gene was Executive Vice President at
Symantec Corporation, where he managed product development. Gene
takes over for his brother and founder of Computer Motion, Dr.
Yulun Wang, who becomes the company's Chief Technical Officer
and Executive Vice President. The company's flagship product AESOP
(pronounced &quot;eesop&quot;) is used by surgeons performing
laparoscopic surgery. AESOP gives surgeons direct control over
the movement of the laparoscope and provides a steady, reliable
and consistent image of the operative site.<BR>

<P>
&quot;Computer Motion combines the vision of enhancing a surgeon's
ability to perform successful surgeries, with a proven track record
of delivering high quality robotic products that surgeons like,&quot;
said Gene Wang, CEO of Computer Motion. &quot;We have the first
and only FDA cleared medical robot today, and many exciting new
products in the pipeline for 1996. This company is defining new
ways of empowering surgeons, while reducing costs in the operating
room.&quot;<BR>

<P>
Computer Motion was founded in Santa Barbara, California by Dr.
Yulun Wang and company chairman Robert W. Duggan in 1989. The
company's core development team has worked together for over ten
years. They have designed and built some of the world's most sophisticated
and successful robotic systems. <BR>
</P>

<P>
&quot;I am delighted that Gene is joining the team here at Computer
Motion to manage the growth of this company,&quot; said Yulun
Wang, Chief Technical Officer. &quot;Gene's presence will allow
me to focus on conceptualizing and creating the next generation
of surgical tools using robotics.&quot;<BR>
</P>
<P>
Computer Motion first introduced AESOP 1000 in October 1994, and
has successfully installed over 130 units in hospitals and surgery
centers in the U.S. and around the world. Over 12,500 minimally
invasive surgeries have been successfully assisted by AESOP (which
is an acronym for Automated Endoscopic System for Optimal Positioning).
Response from both surgeons and hospitals has been positive. 
<BR></P>

<P>
&quot;I love it [AESOP] for laparoscopic surgeries because AESOP
gives me complete control over the operating field,&quot; said
Dr. Carlos Gracia, a leading laparoscopic surgeon at San Ramon
Regional Medical Center. &quot;Visualization is superior with
AESOP due to the steadiness of the picture.&quot;<BR>
</P>
<P>
Computer Motion is currently developing robotic devices for new
surgical applications, which leverage off the technology developed
with AESOP 1000. <BR>

<P>
&quot;What Computer Motion has developed will become a cornerstone
for nearly all future robotic surgery,&quot; said Dr. Richard
Satava, General Surgeon for Walter Reed Army Medical Center in
Washington D.C., and Program Manager at the Advanced Research
Projects Agency (ARPA).<BR>

<P>
Computer Motion is the leader in medical robotics. Its technical
staff has over 50 years of combined experience in robotics, and holds several
key patents in robotics for medical applications. The company's website is at http://www.ComputerMotion.com. Computer
Motion is privately held and is based in Goleta, near Santa Barbara
in California. <BR>
