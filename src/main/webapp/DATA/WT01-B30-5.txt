<font size="2">GAO identified programs in the Defense Department's (DOD) future funding
plans for fiscal years 1995-99 for the following 13 categories:
environmental cleanup and restoration, defense conversion, DOD
dependents schools and Junior ROTC, basic research, counter-drug
efforts, humanitarian and foreign assistance programs, civilian
separation pay and military temporary early retirement authority, grants
to colleges and universities, operation of the 89th Military Airlift
Wing at Andrews Air Force Base, medical education and noncombat-related
medical research, support for foreign military sales, antiterrorism
activities, and pay and allowances to jailed military personnel.  GAO
notes that DOD planned to fund about $13 billion to $15 billion annually
for programs in these 13 categories when the President submitted his
fiscal year 1995 budget in February 1994.  More than half of the funds
are in the operations and maintenance account, which traditionally has
funded combat training and other readiness-related items.  The largest
part of the remaining funds are in the research, development, test, and
evaluation account.

B-260307

February 17, 1995

The Honorable John Kasich
Chairman, Committee on the Budget
House of Representatives

The Honorable Charles E.  Grassley
United States Senate

At your request, we identified programs in the Department of
Defense's (DOD) future funding plans for fiscal years 1995-99 for the
13 broad categories you selected.  The categories are

environmental (includes environmental cleanup, compliance, and
restoration);

defense conversion (includes funding to advance manufacturing and
other technologies, to encourage the development of dual-use
technologies, and for other programs;

DOD dependents schools and Junior ROTC;

basic research (includes programs to advance basic and applied
research in universities and DOD laboratories);

counter-drug programs;

humanitarian and foreign assistance programs;

civilian separation pay and military temporary early retirement
authority;

grants to universities and colleges;

operation of the 89th Military Airlift Wing at Andrews Air Force
Base;

medical education and noncombat-related medical research;

support for foreign military sales;

antiterrorism activities; and

pay and allowances to incarcerated military personnel. 


   RESULTS IN BRIEF
------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :1

DOD planned funding of about $13 billion to $15 billion annually for
programs in these 13 categories when the President submitted his
fiscal year 1995 budget in February 1994.  Program estimates may have
changed as a result of congressional action and subsequent
adjustments to the Future Years Defense Program.\1 We list the
programs included in these categories in appendix I and describe the
programs in appendix II. 

Over half of the planned funds for these programs are in the
operations and maintenance account, which traditionally has funded
combat training and other readiness-related items.  The largest part
of the remaining funds are in the research, development, test, and
evaluation (RDT&amp;E) account. 


--------------------
\1 DOD was unable to provide us the fiscal years 1996-2001 Future
Years Defense Program in time to include more current estimates in
this report. 


   PLANNED FUNDING FOR THE
   CATEGORIES
------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :2

The planned funding estimates for 12 of the 13 categories for fiscal
years 1995-99 are shown in table 1.  DOD was unable to provide
planned funding estimates for pay and allowances to incarcerated
military personnel, so we discuss this category separately.  We also
present data reported by the Congressional Research Service on
programs that were earmarked by Congress.

      PAY AND ALLOWANCES TO
      INCARCERATED MILITARY
      PERSONNEL
---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :2.1

DOD could not provide future funding estimates for its pay and
allowances to incarcerated military personnel.  However, the Defense
Finance and Accounting Service estimates that DOD currently pays
about $1 million monthly to over 750 prisoners. 

Most military personnel in confinement continue to receive pay and
allowances while awaiting trial or other disposition.  Some
incarcerated military personnel continue to receive pay and
allowances after a sentence has been rendered.  Any forfeiture of pay
is determined by court members or military judges within prescribed
guidelines.  Under Section 857 of Title 10 of the United States Code,
forfeiture may not be applied to any pay or allowances accrued before
a convening authority approves the sentence. 


      FUNDING FOR PROGRAMS
      EARMARKED BY CONGRESS IN THE
      FISCAL YEAR 1995 BUDGET
---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :2.2

In October 1994, the Congressional Research Service reported on
programs in the fiscal year 1995 defense legislation that were not
requested by DOD but were earmarked by Congress.\2 While they may not
be programmed in DOD's future funding plans, some of these programs
would qualify for inclusion in the environmental and medical research
categories.  For example,

Congress earmarked $103 million for environmental cleanup,
conservation, or compliance at a number of military activities. 

Congress earmarked $307 million for medical research.  This included
$150 million for breast cancer research, $50 million for cooperative
DOD and Veterans Administration medical research, $40 million for
women's health research, and $34 million for bone marrow research. 


--------------------
\2 &quot;Items in FY 1995 defense legislation that may not be directly
related to traditional military capabilities&quot; (Oct.  31, 1994). 


   SCOPE AND METHODOLOGY
------------------------------------------------------------ Letter :3

Funding projections through fiscal year 1999 were drawn primarily
from the 1995 Future Years Defense Program published in February
1994.\3 Program descriptions were taken primarily from the DOD Future
Years Defense Program Structure Handbook.  We verified our data with
the Office of the Comptroller, DOD.  In addition to our work at DOD,
we interviewed officials and reviewed pertinent reports from the
Congressional Budget Office and the Congressional Research Service. 
Data on payments to incarcerated military personnel were obtained
from the military services and the Defense Finance and Accounting
Service in Crystal City, Virginia.  We did not obtain written agency
comments.  However, we discussed a draft of this report with
responsible agency officials and have included their comments as
appropriate. 

We conducted our review in January and February 1995 in accordance
with generally accepted government auditing standards. 


--------------------
\3 Program estimates in DOD's Future Years Defense Program are
expressed in total obligational authority.  Total obligational
authority is the sum of (a) new budget authority provided for a given
fiscal year; (b) any balances brought forward from prior years that
may remain available for obligation; and (c) any other amounts
authorized to be credited to a specific fund or account during that
year, including transfers between funds or accounts. 


---------------------------------------------------------- Letter :3.1

We are providing copies of this report to appropriate House and
Senate Committees; the Secretaries of Defense, the Air Force, the
Army, and the Navy; and the Director, Office of Management and
Budget.  We will also provide copies to

DETAILED ESTIMATES FOR SELECTED
CATEGORIES OF DEFENSE FUNDING
(FISCAL YEARS 1995-99)
=========================================================== Appendix I

Tables I.1 through I.10 provide more detailed program estimates for
10 categories.  The support for foreign military sales and the cost
of operating the 89th Military Airlift Wing categories are single
program categories and are therefore not broken down in more detail
in this appendix.  Table totals may not add due to rounding.
