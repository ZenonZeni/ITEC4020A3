<STRONG>
<A NAME="house">In the House. </A></STRONG> Representative Bill Goodling (R-PA), Chairman of the House Committee on Economic and Educational Opportunities, and Rep. Frank Riggs (R-CA) have indicated that working on the reauthorization of IDEA will be one of their first priorities once the 105th Congress reports to work early next year.  Congressman Riggs is expected to assume the chairmanship of the House Subcommittee on Early Childhood, Youth and Families.  According to Riggs' office, he traded positions with Rep. Randy "Duke" Cunningham (R-CA), who was chair of the subcommittee in the 104th Congress.  Cunningham will now serve on our appropriations subcommittee (Labor, HHS, and Education). The switch will not be official, however, until Congress officially votes on it early next year.<P>

It is not known whether the new Congress will simply pick up where the 104th left off in the reauthorization process, or whether completely new bills will be introduced. Since the House passed its version of the bill last year, it's possible that it will attempt to pass an identical or very similar bill.  If that occurs, the pressure would be placed back in the Senate, where its reauthorization bill never came up for a vote in the last Congress.<P>

Rep. Riggs' office said the subcommittee tentatively plans to introduce a House bill to reauthorize IDEA on January 7, which is the first day of the 105th Congress. In addition, two hearings are tentatively scheduled to obtain input on several issues, including discipline, disruption, and cessation of services for students with disabilities.  No provisions concerning cessation of educational services for students with disabilities who violate school rules on weapons and drugs are planned to be included in the initial legislative language.  Riggs' office did not say whether a separate bill will contain these provisions. A full committee mark-up has been planned during the second week of March, 1997.<P>

  CEC has heard that the Senate will no longer have a Subcommittee on Disability Policy. This subcommittee has long had jurisdiction over such pieces of legislation as the Rehabilitation Act and the IDEA.  This means that, when IDEA reauthorization is taken up in the Senate, the full Committee on Labor and Human Resources will be initially responsible for working on the bill.  This would decrease the number of hurdles for the bill to clear and would increase the number of members who will be working on this bill early next year.  Following is a list of Senators who sit on the Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources.  If your senator is on this list and you have not yet developed a relationship with his or her staff member responsible for education issues, CEC recommends that you to make an initial contact as soon as possible.  If you do have a relationship, it's not too late to send a holiday greeting card!<P>
