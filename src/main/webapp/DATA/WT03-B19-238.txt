<B><I>Australia</B></I>
<P>
The Australian automotive industry is concentrated in Victoria and South 
Australia. It is increasingly focusing on exports ($1.3 billion in 1993-94), 
given the small scale of the domestic market (around 300,000 units per annum). 
The Commonwealth Government Export Facilitation Scheme has been a significant 
factor in the large increase in automotive exports and imports over the past 
decade.
<P>
Under the current arrangements, the effective rate of protection on 
Australian-made motor vehicles and parts will fall from 25% in 1996 to 15% by 
2001. Tariff and related arrangements for the passenger motor vehicle industry 
post 2000 are to be reviewed in 1996 for decision during 1997.
<P>
The automotive industry has a well-established hierarchical structure of car 
makers, component producers and a third layer consisting of the suppliers to 
the component producers.
<P>
The automotive sector is a major contributor to Australian research and 
development. In 1992-93, spending on R&D was $166 million, equivalent to 6% of 
total business spending on R&D and the third largest sectoral component after 
computer software and electronic equipment. A significant proportion of 
spending was on tooling up to new models.
<P>
The industry provides leadership to the rest of the manufacturing sector in the adoption of new manufacturing technologies such as robotics and computer-aided design and engineering.
<P>
Industry conditions and profitability improved in 1994. Motor vehicle sales have increased since mid-1993 and this has lifted domestic production.
<P>
<B><I>Victoria</B></I>
<P>
Victoria accounts for 65% of Australia's automotive industry production. Ford 
Australia and Toyota Australia are based in Victoria as are the majority of 
component manufacturers. General Motors-Holden Australia has its headquarters, 
engineering design and development activities in Melbourne.
<P>
Automotive sector output in Victoria has performed strongly during 1993 and 
1994. In order to secure its future, the industry is increasingly looking to 
exports as the world industry restructures and niche markets become more 
important. Exports of automotive products rose to $695 million in 1993-94, some 
54% of national automotive exports. Exports of motor vehicles were $430 million 
and exports of components increased to $265 million.
<P>
Productivity has increased as a result of better work practices and more 
efficient organisational structures. Compared with the 1980s, output levels 
have increased while employment is 20% lower.
<P>
Components produced in Victoria include pressed metal components, aluminium 
engine castings, upholstery leather, vehicle security systems, panel 
instrumentation, air conditioners and plastic mouldings as well as more 
elaborately transformed products such as complete engines, instruments, drive 
shafts, lighting and braking systems.
<P>
Almost $1.5 billion of new investment has recently been commenced or announced by Ford, Holdens Engine Company and Toyota, along with components manufacturers Venture Asia Pacific, Air International and Robert Bosch (Aust.).
<P>
<B><I>Prospects</B></I>
<P>
The trend in the world automotive industry for niche markets will give Victorian manufacturers increased opportunities to compete internationally. Under the tariff phase-down policy, automotive exports are expected to double by 2000.
<P>
The Bureau of Industry Economics projects Australian motor vehicle and parts exports to average growth of 8% through to 2005-6. Domestic sales are expected to be static and employment is projected to fall slightly over the period.
