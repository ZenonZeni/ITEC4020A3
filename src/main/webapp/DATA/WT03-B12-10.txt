LinkStar Offers
Integrated Service

LinkStar Communications Corp. (662 S. Military Trail, Deerfield
Beach, FL 33442) has introduced LinkStar directory, an integrated
solution for finding, publishing and promoting businesses and
people on the Internet. The directory allows anyone to have an
instant, free, entry-level presence on the World Wide Web that is
accessible and searchable by any other World Wide Web user.

LinkStar Communications has signed several well-known companies as
charter advertisers, including c 5/8net, Digital Consulting Inc.,
and Success Magazine Conferences. LinkStar is also beginning an
aggressive Partners Program to recruit Internet Service Providers
(ISPs) and Internet Presence Providers (IPPs) to share in
advertising revenue generated from an innovative new technology
developed by LinkStar. The company claims that "LinkStar is
designed to publish your presence on the Web, promote that
presence, and allow you to search for people, organizations and Web
sites with pinpoint accuracy."

The heart of the LinkStar Directory is its free electronic business
card (e-Card) system. Any Internet user with an email address can
easily fill out an e-Card that is accessible and searchable by any
other World Wide Web user. The e-Card includes standard business
card information, as well as a variety of options which allow users
to describe their companies' products and services, and index their
description in a wide range of categories. In addition, the e-Card
provides an automatic hot link to the entrant's email address
and/or World Wide Web home page.

The LinkStar directory includes search capabilities allowing users
to locate listings based on a range of criteria. Searches can be
executed for names, companies, cities, countries, states,
provinces, postal codes, subject categories, key words, or
combinations of these criteria, by direct input into an entry
screen, without the need for Boolean logic entries. Search results
return in order of a proprietary match rating index, display the e-
Card as entered, and link the searcher directly to the information
provider's email and Web locations.

LinkStar users can have their search results sent to them by email
so that they can create their own targeted mailing lists, and
listed organizations will receive monthly statistics via email on
how many times their e-Cards have been viewed by LinkStar users. To
prevent tampering, LinkStar Communications provides each
organization listed in their directory with a security password to
control editing of their listings.

LinkStar claims that their directory is receiving more than 100,000
hits per day and its stock of e-Cards and Web pages have grown to
more than 20,000 since an unpublicized beta version was put on the
Internet last October.

For more information, contact Kevin Rudden or Derek Lane (Tel:
508/369-2100, email: 3566721@mcimail.com), visit the company's home
page at http://www.linkstar.com or send a request to:

Free Site for
Senior Surfers

Millions of seniors already surfing the Internet now have free
access to Grand Times (El Cerrito, CA), a magazine edited for
adults aged 55+. The magazine was launched in its print edition
format in November 1992 and is distributed to older adults in the
San Francisco Bay Area. Reece Halpern, publisher and owner,
recognized that "it is a complete myth that seniors do not use the
information highway or that they are afraid of technology," and
decided to launch the first weekly online magazine for active older
adults.

According to Halpern, a recent survey conducted by Secure Horizons
of 1,750 seniors aged 64+ revealed that 24% of all seniors now use
personal computers at home. Another survey found that approximately
four million seniors use the Internet on a regular basis. Microsoft
reports that 16% of all people who have used a computer are
retirees.

To ensure immediate exposure, Grand Times will have live links with
several online groups including SeniorCom (a senior network
averaging 70,000 visits per month from computer users aged 55-75)
and SeniorNet (a 17,000-member organization of computer-using
seniors).

For more information, contact: Reece R. Halpern of Grand Times
Publishing Inc. (Tel: 510/527-4337, email: mags@grandtimes.com, or

Ads Delivered
In Real Time

c/net: the computer network (150 Chestnut St., San Francisco, CA
94111) has unveiled new technology that allows advertisers to
deliver custom ad messages to different customers in real-time
based on specific demographic information. The new technology,
called DREAM (Delivery of Real-Time Electronic Advertising
messages) was made available to c/net's advertisers beginning
December 15 on c/net's two World Wide Web sites: c/net online
(http://www.cnet.com) and shareware.com (http://www.shareware.com).
Three direct marketing advertisers, Insight, Internet Shopping
Network, and MicroXperts are the first to utilize the new
technology.

Developed by c/net's technology group, c/net's DREAM software gives
c/net advertisers the opportunity to filter choices for banner ad
delivery based on specific demographic information, such as:
    age
    gender
    zip code
    system platform (Macintosh, PC, Unix, etc.)
    connection speed (14.4 modem, 28.8 modem, ISDN line, etc.)
    browser type (Netscape, Mosaic, NetCruiser, etc.)
    affiliation (AOL, Prodigy, CompuServe, Netcom, etc.)
    domain (EDU, GOV, COM, etc.)
    CD-ROM drive owner or not
    connect from home or office

The program allows advertisers to determine who sees a particular
banner advertisement and who doesn't. For example, a direct
marketing firm such as Internet Shopping Network or Insight, can
deliver one banner to Macintosh users and another banner to PC
users. Similarly, a modem manufacturer can send messages to people
connecting from a slower modem, suggesting they upgrade to a faster
modem. Or a CD-ROM distributor with many different titles could
target only people with CD-ROM drives and, then, further narrow
their target to men or women depending on the title.

Since October of last year, c/net also has offered ARM (Advertising
Response and Monitoring) software, a set of tools that allows
advertisers to evaluate audience response to their messages. Using
ARM, c/net online, advertisers can determine the audience most
responsive to a product or message and compare advertising usage
and response rates against system-wide averages. This technology
has helped c/net to attract more paying advertisers than almost any
site on the Internet, including Microsoft, Intel, IBM, MCI,
Hewlett-Packard and others.

c/net's advertising rates are based solely on actual impressions or
CADs (Confirmed Ads Delivered), with all advertising banners
rotated dynamically through the service. Through c/net's unique
dynamic ad delivery system, advertising is more seamlessly
integrated into the site. Only one advertising banner appears per
page, and always in the premium position--at the top of the page.

For more information, contact: Patrick Toland (Tel: 415/395-7800,
ext. 535, email: patrickt@cnet.com).

Internet Marketing
Excellence Awards

The 1995 Tenagra Awards for Internet Marketing Excellence were
awarded to Federal Express, Ragu, Yahoo!, NetPOST, Software.Net,
and Virtual Vineyards.

According to Cliff Kurtzman, president of The Tenagra Corp. (1100
Hercules, Suite 120, Houston, TX 77058), "these awards provide peer
recognition to significant Internet marketing successes over the
past year. Each success makes our industry more credible in the
public's eye, and recognition of these successes strengthens the
industry." Award nominations are made by an international panel of
Internet marketing experts and final awardees are selected by
Tenagra.

    Federal Express (http://www.fedex.com/) was selected for their
online information center that provides immediate tracking of
package status.

    Ragu Spaghetti Sauce (http://www.eat.com/) was selected due to
their online marketing and brand awareness campaign that is both
fun and entertaining while allowing them to gather customer
opinions and collect valuable information about market trends.

    Yahoo! (http://www.yahoo.com/) has facilitated Internet
marketing by making it possible for users to easily find online
resources.

    As the first Media Relations firm on the Net, Eric Ward and
his NetPOST service (http://www.netpost.com/) pioneered the concept
of a company specifically devoted to Internet online and media
awareness campaigns.

    By driving costs down and sharing the savings with customers,
"Software.Net" (http://www.software.net/), a service of CyberSource
Corp., is a true global business success that could only have
happened on the Internet, electronically shipping over 5,000 pieces
of software weekly to customers worldwide.

    Virtual Vineyards (http://www.virtualvin.com/) has built a
profitable business selling wines and gourmet foods online.
Focusing on small producers, they have demonstrated the potential
of the Net to take limited-distribution products to a worldwide
market.

Thomas Online
Corporate Purchasing

Thomas Publishing Co.'s Electronic Purchasing Information Corp.
(EPIC, One Penn Plaza, New York, NY 10001) has introduced an
electronic corporate purchasing network for industrial products.
Called CONNECTSUS, it is targeted to provide timely information on
a potential universe of over one million Maintenance, Repair and
Operations (MRO) products, reducing purchasing time from weeks to
hours and cutting transaction costs by 90%.

The service is made possible by EPIC's new alliance with GE
Information Services (P.O. Box 6403, Rockville, MD 20849-6403).
Companies using CONNECTSUS not only have a large number of products
to choose from, but they can also compare product features and
prices at a glance. Using CONNECTSUS' Windows-based software,
buyers have the ability to research and compare products, negotiate
prices, and, through the alliance with GE, enter orders and make
purchases online with a purchasing card number via the system's
link to Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) standards.

Buyers using CONNECTSUS are assured of privacy, ease of use, and
greater control over the purchasing of industrial supplies, a
market which accounts for $400 billion in expenditures annually.
The high margin of error and costs associated with the traditional
order process, as much as $150 per purchase, are dramatically
reduced.

Suppliers using CONNECTSUS have the opportunity to show to their
target markets a wider number of products, with a capability of
50,000 product classifications to date, in greater detail than ever
before. CONNECTSUS' reach to corporate purchasers is wider than
available through print catalogues or even CD ROMs. CONNECTSUS
allows suppliers to continually add to their listings, and to
update that information more cost effectively than available
elsewhere.

For more information, contact: Lynthia Romney or John Johmann of
Padilla Spear Beardsley (Tel: 212/752-8338) for Thomas Publishing
Co.

Excessive Fees Block
I'Way Construction

Teleport Communications Group (TCG, New York, NY) has released its
latest "Info Bit" dealing with the roadblocks facing local
telephone competition. This information addresses a key issue now
under discussion by the conference committee working on federal
telecommunications legislation.

Competitive access providers and competitive local exchange
carriers are helping to pave the "Information Superhighway" with
optical fiber. To install such telecommunications infrastructure,
new entrants need access to public 'rights of way'. But, the report
finds, "excessive franchise fees imposed by municipalities retard
infrastructure investment."

Both federal and state courts have supported the principle that
municipalities may not use their police powers over the public
rights of way to generate excess revenue. TCG states that "not only
are excessive franchise fees often illegal, they are always
anticonsumer." Since incumbent providers typically pay nothing for
the privilege of constructing in, under, or over the public rights
of way, a franchise fee charged only to new telecommunications
providers is a barrier to entry. It deprives consumers of state-of-
the-art infrastructure and new telecommunications services at
reasonable prices.

Thus, the report calls for "municipalities charging franchise fees
should do so on a nondiscriminatory basis. All local exchange
carriers, including the incumbent, should be subject to those fees,
which should recover only the actual cost of providing access to
public rights of way. Other states and the U.S. Congress should
follow the lead of Connecticut, Florida and Texas which recently
legislated nondiscriminatory access to public rights of way."

For more information, contact TCG, Gail Schwartz (Tel: 718/355-
2892).

1996 Slowdown in
Electronic Marketplace

International Data Corp. (IDC, Five Speen St., Framingham, MA
01701) has predicted 1996 to be a year of disappointment as
investors and corporations suffer through the discouragingly slow
development of a significant consumer base. By the end of the year,
IDC predicts 20% of the Fortune 500 companies that have commercial
Web sites will close or stop maintaining them, resulting in ghost
sites. The leading online information service providers will derive
more than one-half of their revenue from providing access to the
Web by mid-1997.

IDC predicts that "In 1996 ... the Internet/World Wide Web
phenomenon will shift from today's 'intoxication' stage to a
'hangover' stage. The high-flying Internet suppliers will have
disappointing financial results, while technical capabilities of
the Internet are stretched to the breaking point." Although IDC
predicts the overall growth in online subscribers will continue to
be very strong, they expect 1996 to show a high turnover rate as
users disappointed by the content on the Web cancel their online
subscriptions.

But, they also predict that during the next five years, the number
of online users will rise to more than 200 million, and by 2010, it
will exceed 1 billion. Industry revenues will jump from $500
billion to more than $2.5 trillion by 2010, and corporate spending
will rise from 2 to 2.5% of revenues to more than 5%. In addition,
IDC believes online commerce volume will hit $150 billion or more
by the year 2000 and more than $1 trillion by 2010.

A full copy of IDC's 1996 predictions can be found on IDC's home
page. The address is http://www.idcresearch.com. Interested parties
are welcome to share views and insights with Frank Gens, senior VP
of research at IDC, via email at fgens@idcresearch.com. For more
information, contact Hillary DeMello (Tel: 508/935-4282, email:

AT&T Changes
Online Strategy

AT&T Corp. (550 Madison Ave., New York, NY 10022) has signaled an
important strategic change in its computer online services,
planning to abandon the proprietary software required to use its
online services: the Imagination Network, PersonalLink, and
Interchange. Instead, AT&T will reshape its online services around
the technical standards of the Internet, giving them Web-like
hypertext links. The company stated that "the Interchange platform
as we know it will phase out over a year or so, to be dissolved
into the World Wide Web." AT&T bought Interchange from Ziff Davis
in December 1994 for a widely-reported but unconfirmed $50 million.


AT&T said it would be able to take advantage of the best electronic
commerce and navigation software for the Internet, most of which
are not compatible with Interchange. In doing so, AT&T is following
the lead of Microsoft, which in December changed tack to open its
online service for free to Internet users. Most of AT&T's
publishing partners already have their own Web sites. Some analysts
questioned whether they would need AT&T at all in that case.

At the moment, subscribers to AT&T Business Network pay $24.95 a
month for up to 10 hours of use. With this they get free
Interchange software and a Netscape Web browser. AT&T has not
decided if or how it will charge for the service when it is web-
based.

More information on AT&T's new policy can be found at the company's
home page: http://www.att.com/press.

Enriched Internet
Software by InterGo

TeacherSoft Inc. (TeacherSoft, Inc., 903 East 18th Street, Suite
230, Plano, TX 75074) has announced the worldwide availability of
InterGO, termed "the industry's first enriched Internet software."
This new multimedia product combines browsing, searching, email,
file transfer, Telnet, news and extensive reference content, virus
scanning, and screening for objectionable material through a fully
integrated series of familiar scenes.

InterGO's interface uses scenes including an office, library, news
room and treasure map to provide graphic options for users as they
access the Internet. InterGO's library is equipped with The
Columbia Encyclopedia, Fifth Edition; The American Heritage
Dictionary of the English Language, Third Edition; Roget's
Thesaurus; a world factbook and atlas; an Internet guide; and
hundreds of literary works which are hyperlinked to the
encyclopedia. Key words within articles in the encyclopedia are
hyperlinked to relevant information sources on the Internet.

The company claims that "TeacherSoft's exclusive search technology
allows InterGO users to retrieve information from Internet sites
instantly on virtually any subject. TeacherSoft has replaced the
bookmark of traditional Internet browsers with a graphically-rich
library, enabling users to create bookcases filled with virtual
books of information." InterGO also simplifies the process of
obtaining an Internet account. During the easy installation
process, InterGO searches for an Internet connection on the user's
computer. If an online service provider is not located, InterGO
lists Internet providers and assists the user in setting up an
account.

In addition to making the Internet easier to use, InterGO
incorporates TeacherSoft's exclusive KinderGuard security screen
and the SafeSurf rating system. These features allow a parent or
administrator to set parameters defining the types of materials
which will be accessible to children or employees. KinderGuard
screens material from Web and gopher sites, ftp archives, news
groups, and even mailing lists. When used in the home, the
screening mechanism enables parents to prevent children from
accessing inappropriate material. In the office, the screening
device can be used to prevent employees from accessing
objectionable sites via a corporate Internet account.

First Web-based
Workflow Program

Action Technologies Inc. (1301 Marina Village Pkwy., Suite 100,
Alameda, CA 94501-1028) has announced Action Workflow Metro, the
first workflow solution available for the Internet. Metro brings
the functionality of Action's workflow technology to the Web,
allowing companies to use the Internet to coordinate enterprise
business processes through any standard Web browser product,
including Netscape.

Metro provides customers with workflow functionality, enabling them
to reap business benefits from their Internet investment, including
improved customer satisfaction, reduced product delivery cycle
time, and lowered costs for delivery of products and services.

Metro allows any standard Web browser product to become a client
for Action's work management services. The product includes 20
customizable applications, such as customer service, sales and
marketing, human resources, finance and accounting, and engineering
applications. These applications leverage both a corporate Intranet
for internal enterprise applications, such as human resources, and
the Internet for extended enterprise applications, such as customer
service. Metro is one of the first WWW product offerings to utilize
Netscape's published APIs, allowing Metro to leverage Netscape's
security features.

Metro also includes easy-to-use document publishing capabilities.
Users can create and post documents via the ActionWorkflow Metro
interface and distribute them without having to use HTML code. For
more complex document publishing, structured HTML documents can be
easily incorporated into a Metro workflow process.

Additional information is available on Action's home page located
at http://www.actiontech.com, or by contacting Sumi Shohara of
Action Technologies (Tel: 510/748-1045, Fax: 510/769-0596, email:

Lotus Changes
Notes to Fit the 'Net

Lotus Development Corp. (55 Cambridge Pkwy., Cambridge, MA 02142),
responding to competitive pressure caused by new Internet
technology, has demonstrated major changes to its hallmark Notes
program that allow it to both read and create information for the
World Wide Web.

Most of the changes are included in a new version of Notes that
went on sale on January 1, 1996. This includes the possibility to
click onto the Web while reading email sent by a colleague in
Notes, or create Web pages using Notes. The steps are designed to
keep Lotus as the leading seller of messaging and groupware
programs, which combine electronic mail and sophisticated
databases.

Lotus has been increasingly threatened by technical standards
related to the Web that allow documents to be linked easily
regardless of the computers involved, something that Notes first
made popular. Those technical standards occur in Web programs, such
as browsers, that are less expensive than Notes.

Thousands of companies are incorporating Web standards in
communications programs not just for the Internet but on their
internal computer networks, something that's become known as an
"intranet." The new products put Lotus at the forefront of major
software producers who are changing their goods to embrace the
global data network. Pricing for Notes server software starts at
$495.

More information can be found at Lotus web site
(http://www.lotus.com).

Internet Watchdog
Monitors Users

Charles River Media (P.O. Box 417, 403 VFW Dr., Rockland, MA 02370)
has announced Internet WatchDog for PC and Macintosh computers, a
monitoring tool for the Internet and personal computers. Internet
WatchDog does not censor what is being displayed; rather it makes
a record for later viewing by authorized individuals.

Using this utility on any PC or Macintosh, parents, teachers and
employers will be able to view the activities taking place on their
computers without arbitrarily limiting access to the Internet or
creating a false sense of security by simply "blocking" certain
sites or keywords. As new sites are added to the Internet everyday,
it is impossible to "block" unsuitable Internet activity. Internet
WatchDog allows the user to monitor computer use, much like a
telephone bill enables the caller to see a listing of phone
numbers.

Internet WatchDog functions by capturing screen and other
information "intelligently" while the computer is running. The user
will be able to review a grid-like screen with a series of
thumbnail screen captures. For a closer look, any screen capture
can be seen full-size. In addition, Internet WatchDog records usage
of all software applications whether Internet related or other
computer activity. A password is required to access the monitoring
capabilities of the program, and any attempt to circumvent or
tamper with the Internet WatchDog is also recorded.

Internet WatchDog, priced at $29.95, is available from computer
software stores, bookstores, mail order catalogs, and Charles River
Media, Order Desk (Tel: 800/382-8505, email: chrivmedia@aol.com).

'Super Spider'
for the Web

Digital Equipment Corp. (111 Powdermill Rd., Maynard, MA 01754) has
introduced the Internet's first "super spider" software for the
World Wide Web. It conducts a comprehensive search of the entire
Web text at speeds up to 100 times faster than spiders used in
conventional information search services. The technology promises
to surpass the limitations of current information services by
delivering the most complete, precise, and up-to-date information
of the Web's entire text. The technology's super spider and super
indexer employ next-generation software and advanced networking,
powered by the highest-performing 64-bit Alpha computers.

The super spider creates and dispatches a "brood of spiders" that
crawls the entire Web. Second-generation scalable software
simultaneously locates and indexes text as it finds Web pages. A
search engine enables Web users to conduct precise searches for
specific information by looking for phrases, specifying key words,
using case-sensitive matches, and restricting searches to titles or
other parts of a document. Network connectivity is provided through
Digital's fiber optic and high-speed network switching
technologies. Ultra-high-speed search and indexing is enabled by
Digital's 64-bit servers.

Digital made the "beta" version of this technology available on
December 15, 1995. Users can test the super spider's Web index and
provide feedback through Digital's Internet address at:
http://www.altavista.digital.com. For more information, contact: Ed
Canty (Tel: 508/264-6672), Sarah Miller (Tel: 508/264-6673), Tom
Madden (Tel: 508/264-6675), or Don Bradley (Tel: 508/264-6678).

Connect Schools
to Internet Now

The Advisory Council on the National Information Infrastructure, a
panel appointed by president Clinton has recommended that
communities should push schools and libraries onto the information
superhighway by the year 2000. Connecting each public school to the
Internet by the year 2000 would cost 1.5% to 2% of schools'
budgets, or about $11 billion, the report estimated. That assumes
putting about 25 computers per school into a special classroom, or
lab, where a school's teachers can bring classes once a day.

But schools often remain leery of making big computer purchases,
worried they will buy the wrong thing or spend thousands on quickly
obsolete equipment, the panel noted. Poorer school districts and
those in rural areas face special problems. Often, schools must do
extensive renovations simply to get modern phone lines into
buildings constructed 50-70 years ago.

The panel found success stories others can follow:

    In Chester Ridge School District in Fishertown, PA, teachers
each year seek corporate grants that provide free Internet access,
then use the time to train colleagues and help students.
    A radio station in Lansing, MI, formed a partnership with
seven schools to help students email questions about current events
to the news staff, the White House, the governor and people around
the world.
    At Rosa Parks Interparish Elementary in Baltimore, MD, a
corporate grant helped students talk via computer with the school's
namesake, the legendary civil rights activist.
    In Taos, NM, students and adults use a university's computers
to look for jobs, visit a virtual library, get health information
or send email to lawmakers. The town, the state, local businesses
and corporations help pay.

The report found that parents with technical knowledge often are a
school's best resource. But it encouraged schools to seek help
anywhere: from corporations, state agencies, colleges or even by
switching money in their own budgets. About 1.3% of public schools'
spending is now devoted to technology, the study found.

Plug And Play
Security Solution

Digital Secured Networks (DSN) Technology Inc. (New York, NY) has
previewed its Net G-1 security device, a hardware unit that
provides an economical plug-and-play solution for absolutely secure
data transmission over the Internet and other internal and external
networks. Incorporating DSN's patent-pending "Electronic Privacy
Switch" technology, the Net G-1 offers transparent security,
authentication and encryption for network users.

The company claims that "Net G-1 is part of a bold new core
technology which greatly enhances the level of security for users
of the Internet, LANs and WANs, and will eventually be included in
other telecommunication applications."  The product is not a
firewall but can complement, support or replace a firewall or other
security software solutions.

The Net G-1, which resembles a small black-cased desktop computer,
provides a distributed security mode that cannot be entered or
decoded. With Net G-1, encryption does not take place over network
lines. So hackers, intruders or unauthorized personnel cannot
intercept, log onto, subvert or decode messages.

The Net G-1 is a completely plug-and-play device. The user plugs in
three cables and requires no further maintenance or support. Once
connected, the unit self-configures to PC or server's IP and
Ethernet address. It then automatically uses sophisticated
handshake mechanisms and authentication procedures and generates
unique public key encryption. These are combined with the private
keys on the receiving Net G-1 unit and establish a common secret
key connection between each pair of nodes.

Pricing for the Net G-1 will be "around $5,000.00 per unit" and
units will be available for sale in the first quarter 1996. DSN
officials are offering free evaluation/testing units to those
interested.

Associates (Tel: 212/366-5060, Fax: 212/366-5922).

Microsoft Proposes
I'Net Digital Signature

Microsoft Corp. (One Microsoft Way, Redmond, WA 98052-6399) has
proposed an Internet digital signature initiative to provide a
safer environment for executable code on the Internet. To address
concerns about potentially malicious code or viruses, this
technology will enable users to verify that a program's integrity
is free of third-party tampering. Browsers will be equipped with
the ability to automatically download applications from a list of
vendors approved by the user. If the author is not on the user's
pre-approved list, the browser can display the signature of the
executable code and allow users to make an informed decision on
whether to proceed with the download.

Microsoft plans to propose the Internet digital signature
specifications to the W3 Consortium (W3C) and the Internet
Engineering Task Force (IETF) as an open Internet standard. The
technology will be an open, proposed specification available to the
entire Internet community. In addition, as part of the Open Process
Design Review, Microsoft will host a digital signature design
preview to solicit feedback from the Internet community.

For more information, contact: Kira Sorensen (Tel: 206/882-8080) or

Medicine Cruises
Info Autostrada

Remote-controlled surgery, dietary advice and prescriptions for
yoga or antibiotics should soon be coming down the information
autostrada to a place near you, experts have predicted at a
telemedicine conference in Adelaide, Australia.

Futurist Dr. Peter Ellyard said communications technology offered
a great new chance for people to control their own health and well
being. People would be able to enter their own health profile into
personal computers and receive information to help them tailor
their own personal diet, exercise, stress control and health
programs and diagnose and manage some illnesses at home.

Dr. Ellyard said telemedicine should teach people about yoga,
shiatsu, traditional Chinese medicine, Ayurvedic medicine and other
complementary medicine as well as conventional treatments so people
could focus on creating health instead of ignoring their bodies
until they got sick.

Australia has a long tradition of telemedicine from the first Royal
Flying Doctor Service pedal radios brought to remote settlements in
1927 to a 1961 emergency operation in Antarctica directed through
telegrams by a brain specialist in Melbourne, to today's
telepsychiatry. And experts at the South Australian Health
Commission and Northern Territory Health Services conference say a
revolution is on the way, with Australia aiming to be at the
forefront of Asian telemedicine.

Design Your Own
Home Page on the 'Net

Recently, more and more services are being offered on the net for
individuals as well as businesses to design their own home page,
requiring a minimum of technical expertise as well as little or no
cost. Below is a sampling:

Home Page Wizard. CompuServe Inc. (500 Arlington Centre Blvd.,
Columbus, OH 43220) is expanding access to its Web page creation
and publishing tools, now also being available for businesses.

The "Home Page Wizard" can be used to build a page of up to one
megabyte and place it in CompuServe's Our World area
(http://www.ourworld.com). The Home Page Wizard and "Publishing
Wizard" are currently available for free to CompuServe members (GO
HPWIZ). While CompuServe is developing more advanced features to
create a specialized business-oriented service, businesses are
invited to start now in Our World and upgrade to the more advanced
corporate service when it becomes available. CompuServe said that
to date, more than 17,000 personal home pages have been posted in
the Our World area by CompuServe members. The Home Page Wizard
software package was downloaded from the CompuServe Information
Service over 35,000 times in the first ten days of availability.
For more information, contact Jeff Shafer of CompuServe, Tel:
614/538-4632 or visit CompuServe's home page at
http://www.compuserve.com.

Instant Home Page. Web Communications (Santa Cruz, CA) is offering
an online service that allows anyone to instantly create a World
Wide Web site simply by filling out forms in their Web browser. The
"WebCom Instant Site Service" offers reference and overview
information and five individual page creation forms. The overview
takes clients through a step-by-step process of creating pages,
where they can select the pages they wish to create, and enter
information into the automated form. They are then presented with
forms for five standard Web pages, including a home page, feedback
form, sign guestbook form, guestbook page, and a hotlist page.
After the file name is confirmed, clients can view their completed
web page.

Web Communications provides a guest account which can be used by
anybody on the Internet to try out the WebCom Instant Site Service.
The guest account can also be used by visitors to create their own
custom Web pages, or modify the pages created by the WebCom Instant
Site Service.

Web Communications was founded in May 1994 by Chris Schefler and
Thomas Leavitt to provide tools, resources, and services designed
to assist individuals and organizations to publish and communicate
effectively and affordably over the Internet. The company currently
hosts 1357 individual Web sites. For more information, contact Web
Communications, Chris Schefler (Tel: 408/457-9671).

WebWho. Scientific Research Management Corp. (1714 Ringwood Ave.,
San Jose, CA 95131) offers WebWho (http://webwho.com), which allows
users, for a nominal charge, to create a mini-home page,
approximately 150 words in length, with up to two hyperlinks, and
to define and control their directory listing even if they don't
have an existing Web site, email address or Internet connection.
Web explorers can immediately use WebWho, at no charge, as a Web
navigation directory to locate businesses and individuals on the
Internet. In addition to determining their directory listing, home
page owners will be able to specify up to 20 keywords to further
define their Internet presence. Unlike other Internet navigation
tools, home page owners will be able to dynamically change their
description, hyperlinks and keywords at any time and as often as
they desire.

Customers who already have an Internet presence, can also reap the
benefits of WebWho, by complementing and enhancing their existing
home page. Home page owners can choose the search category,
keywords, description text, and hyperlinks to their existing home
page or emailbox. The probability that Internet explorers will find
them should be greatly increased.

For more information, contact: Skeeter Wesinger, or Peter Bowen,
both of SRMC (Tel: 408/437-1813, email: info@webwho.com).

CA Real Estate
Online

Many California real estate agents are now able to tap into what
could be the largest online offering of information about homes and
condominiums to date. Members of the Greater Inland Valleys
Multiple Listing Service Inc. (MLS) will be offering their home
listings via the Internet on a system that ties in listings
throughout Southern California. The Homeseekers Web
(http://www.homeseekers.comsite) brings together up to 40,000 home
listings across Southern California, many offering photos and
specific addresses. Homeseekers is the creation of Visual Listings
Inc. (Brea, CA), which is operating kiosk-based New Home Search
systems in shopping malls.

The service has about 3,200 members from several local boards of
Realtors. The site already contains thousands of listings from
regional MLS systems covering Orange County, the Los Angeles area
and the Greater South Bay region. Real estate agents at boards in
the Coachella Valley and High Desert are expected to join the
network soon. And board-operated MLS systems in San Diego County
and elsewhere in the state may also join soon.

The system allows consumers to narrow their search from a wide
selection of criteria, including city, price range, home style
(single-family, condominium) number of bedrooms and baths, size of
garage, and by other features, including formal dining room, pool,
spa, fireplace and family room. Consumers also can limit the search
to only homes where open houses are scheduled so they only are
shown houses they can go and see that day.

Each property listing also has room for one color photo of the
property. Brokers or agents may add up to three more photos per
listing for an additional cost. A 20-second soundtrack also can be
added at extra cost. Many of the listings include the property's
address so consumers can drive by the listing first. Agents also
can have a link to their own Internet home page added to each
property listing. The home page includes a photo and brief resume
and other properties the agent has to offer. They also can add
electronic mail and fax-back capabilities for consumers to use. The
home page costs the broker or agent $50 a year.

Homeseekers joins a growing list of Internet sites offering
property listings. Indeed, there are an estimated 4,800 such Web
sites across the U.S. Unlike other Internet sites, the Homeseekers
and California Association of Realtors Internet sites allow real
estate agents to list their properties for free--they pay no
advertising fee for the service other than the listing rates
already paid to be part of their local MLS. The systems make money
through other companies that sponsor or advertise on the networks.
These "sub-advertisers" pay from $250 to $500 a month to be on the
network, but also must agree to promote their company's presence on
the Internet.

Internet World
Trade Center

A new business-oriented web site (http://www.internetWTC.com)
designed as the virtual equivalent of a skyscraping world trade
tower has opened for business on the World Wide Web. With over 100
floors and a marble-walled lobby, the Internet World Trade Center
(iWTC, Box 5474, Route 46 East, Parsippany, NJ 07054) offers
visitors hundreds of features including investor services; trade
show listings; news and weather updates; hyperlinks to 20 major web
search engines; a medical information facility; an entertainment
and gaming center, and, from its observation deck, downloadable
views of New York's skyline and harbor that are always
spectacularly clear.

Visitors to the Internet World Trade Center enter through its lobby
where a newsstand offers USA Today, Time Magazine, the Financial
Times and many other publications. A tenant directory can be
searched by company name or by product or service. Companies are
grouped by industry. For example, electronics firms are located on
the 11th floor, insurance companies on the 19th and software
developers on the 29th. Government  offices occupy the 15th floor
where visitors can drop in on Congress, the CIA, FBI, and over a
dozen other federal agencies. Those stopping at the 22nd floor
Medical Information Center can gather background on everything from
rhinoplasty to organ transplants. A major feature of the iWTC is
immediate access to 20 major web search engines including Web
Crawler, Yahoo, Gopher and Lycos. There is also a package tracking
center for users of Federal Express, DHL and UPS.

iWTC provides potential member companies all necessary services to
get started including design of online advertising and
communications, support of order entry and electronic data
interchange (EDI) and database integration. Companies lease space
in the Internet World Trade Center by purchasing various-sized
units of online pages. These range from inexpensive one-page
business cards to 60-page areas capable of housing multimedia
annual reports, executive overviews and interactive advertising.
iWTC installations also enable advertisers to process orders and
transactions, maintain catalogs and provide customer support.

Firms already established on the Internet may opt for a welcome
page that offers visitors a description of their products and
services and a direct connection to their home page via hyperlink.
Retailers can set up shop on the iWTC's mezzanine mall. The
classified advertising section accommodates real estate, help
wanted, used equipment and legal listings.

For more information, contact: Kenneth Browne at IWTC (Tel:
800/579-8656 or 201/244-1785).

IRS Promotes
Internet Filing

With the official start of tax filing season, the Internal Revenue
Service has said it is expanding its electronic services. The IRS
is putting more information on the Internet, rolling out a
telephone filing system nationwide and laying plans to expand
filing of tax returns on personal computers.

To reach more taxpayers, or at least those who are computer-
literate, the IRS is improving its online information network, such
as the "Fedworld" Internet home page at http://www.irs.ustreas.gov,
with answers to frequently asked questions and forms that taxpayers
can download. Also this year, taxpayers can file another form that
will direct-deposit refunds into a savings or checking account.

The agency is planning a project called CyberFile that would allow
taxpayers to file electronic returns directly. At present, the IRS
requires that electronic filings be sent via a middleman, such as
a professional tax preparer. The project will start with a test in
six states, but IRS officials say they haven't decided just where
yet.

Complete Internet
Commerce Package

SBT's (1401 Los Gatos Dr., San Rafael, CA 94903) Internet Div. has
announced that its electronic storefront package, WebTrader 2.0,
will integrate Checkfree's (8275 North High St., Columbus, OH
43235) credit card processing service providing a complete, secure
Internet commerce solution. The combination allows any company to
sell products on the Internet, automate order entry and fulfillment
and receive credit card payments electronically. WebTrader has a
suggested retail price of $1,295.

The Internet commerce solution process will be initiated by a
merchant contacting an SBT Internet Business Consultant (IBC) who
will install and configure WebTrader and provide the client with
the Checkfree Merchant Application package. The IBC will arrange
for a Checkfree account manager to be assigned to the account who
will assist with the application process. The IBC will then
customize and modify the WebTrader application, and tailor
Checkfree's processing to the merchant's specific needs. Once the
application has been processed and approved, the IBC will
coordinate site testing for credit card transactions. At that point
the merchant is equipped to conduct business on the Internet.

WebTrader allows businesses to create an electronic storefront with
order forms for products or services on the Web. It automatically
processes the orders and sends the customer confirmation via email.
WebTrader initiates and completes the sales process by providing a
direct, instantaneous connection between vendor and customer.
WebTrader also includes RSA Data Security's (100 Marine Pkwy.,
Suite 500, Redwood City, CA 94065-1031) encryption software which
keeps credit card numbers and other sensitive data private once it
is received by the vendor's Web server.

WebTrader can be used as a stand-alone Internet application or in
conjunction with SBT's Pro Series 3.0i accounting software. System
requirements for WebTrader users are minimal: A 486 66Mhz or higher
computer, 12 Mb of RAM, an account with a major Internet provider,
Windows 3.1 or higher, a 14.4 modem, and an Internet mail
connection.

Visa's New
Electronic Services

Major U.S. financial institutions are implementing a fully
electronic back-end bill-payment system developed by Visa
International (San Francisco, CA), linked to remote-banking
services offered by a growing number of financial institutions.

Visa is commencing electronic bill-payment programs with major U.S.
financial institutions, including Banc One Corp., Barnett Banks,
The Chase Manhattan Bank, Crestar Bank, First Bank System, First
Interstate Bank, First Chicago, First Tennessee Bank, First Union
National Bank, Mellon Bank, Norwest Banks, Star Bank and U.S.
Bancorp. Teaming up with major billers, such as utility companies,
additional financial institutions are expected to utilize Visa's
new turnkey system in first quarter 1996.

In addition to enhancing front-end, remote-banking programs by Visa
Interactive, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Visa International, and
other providers, Visa's newly U.S.-patented, back-end standard is
expected to significantly reduce remittance-processing
inefficiencies for participating financial institutions and
organizations that bill for goods and services. Visa's back-end
system also enables billers to electronically send invoices to
their customers who pay bills online, expected to be available in
mid-1996, aimed at reducing the cost of printing and mailing
statements.

Many financial services providers and commercial billers currently
offer electronic bill payment systems that are only partly
electronic. Visa estimates that more than 60% of "electronic" bill
payments are converted to paper to complete the payment process.
The Visa solution is fully electronic, improving efficiency for
billers and financial institutions. Future enhancements are
expected to include multi-currency, cross-border payment
settlement.

Sterling Software (Dublin, OH) worked with Visa to enhance
electronic connectivity between financial institutions and billers-
-the final link--to create a turnkey, member-controlled payment
system.

For more information, contact: Greg Jones (Tel: 415-432-2753) or

Investment Advice
on the Net

INVESTools, (http://INVESTools.com), developed by Tabula
Interactive Inc. (3905 Bohannon Dr., Suite A, Menlo Park, CA
94025), now offers a total of 21 publications. Among the
newsletters and research recently added are Zacks Earnings
Estimates, Al Frank's The Prudent Speculator, John Dessauer's
Investor's World, Individual Investor's Special Situations Report,
George Putnam's The Turnaround Letter and the No-Load Fund Analyst,
produced by the Litman/Gregory investment management firm. Reuters'
Corporate World News Service will also soon be integrated into the
site.

INVESTools brings together a selection of top-performing investment
newsletters and research, providing top advisors' analyses,
including useful recommendations such as model portfolios.
Investors can either browse through INVESTools' collection of
impartial advisory information, or quickly perform searches on
specific stocks.

INVESTools offers free access to newsletter excerpts, headlines,
searches, sample issues, discussions and educational materials.
Paid publications are available by subscription or a la carte
pricing. When users read the contents of investment letters,
earnings estimates and other paid services, they are charged only
for the elements they choose. Payment is by credit card or
CyberCash. Most reports and articles fall into the $3-$10 price
range, and new registrants currently get a $25 user credit.

INVESTools is part of a broad trend toward investor self-help. More
individuals are taking control of their investment activities using
PCs and online information, because they realize that if they don't
plan for their own financial security, no one will. This growing
number of self-reliant investors has fueled the explosion of
discount brokerage firms, 401K savings and mutual funds. Computer
technology has become a key tool that allows these investors to
choose and track their holdings. Sources of commodity information
like stock quotations and historical charting have become
widespread. Now investors are looking more for qualitative,
advisory material to help guide them.

DATA POINTS

Liberty Financial Companies Inc. (125 High St., Boston, MA
02110) has introduced the WebSaver Annuity on the World Wide Web
(http://www.websaver.com), the first financial product specifically
designed and priced for the Internet. By exploiting the
efficiencies of the Internet, Liberty Financial says, the WebSaver
Annuity lowers its sales and operating costs and then passes those
savings on to the online customer in the form of higher guaranteed
rates. The WebSaver Annuity is a guaranteed return annuity that
allows customers to order a policy online, while funding the policy
with a check sent through traditional mail to avoid potential
security concerns. However, because of local laws, the annuity
product is only available in 24 states.

    Prudential Insurance Co. of America has launched an
interactive World Wide Web site at http://www.prudential.com.
Prudential claims that their site is different from others because
it is 'needs-based,' meaning that it provides consumers with tools
and calculators that can help them figure out, and plan for, their
short-and long-term financial needs. Prudential says it has no
intention of offering actual sales through the Internet.

    According to the Kansai Employers Assn., some 2,000 companies
will start exchanging information via the Internet on both vacant
positions and employees they plan to transfer to other companies,
possibly as early as March 1996. Under the human resources exchange
network project, western Japan-based companies will seek to help
employees being encouraged to look for work elsewhere as a result
of corporate restructuring. The network would allow both companies
and employees who are subject to restructuring to access a database
on human resources and available positions. Proponents of the
system would also like to include companies in Tokyo and Nagoya to
use it. The new system would provide such data as employees'
skills, job careers and annual salaries, while protecting their
privacy.

    The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) will soon
go live on the Internet, with a computer database that offers
information on everything from sex to business, to provide material
on its member-nations. The ASEAN home page will give information on
each ASEAN country, reports from their ministerial and security
meetings, documents on the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA), economic
cooperation and investment policies of its members. No dates were
immediately available on when ASEAN goes live on the Internet.
