<B>WASHINGTON - In the midst of their Christmas rush, many holiday shoppers
pause to make sure that the garment, appliance or toy they want to purchase
has been made in the U.S.A. Unfortunately, the Library of Congress has not
shown the same sort of concern about where its own products are manufactured
- despite being required to do so under federal law. This flagrant disregard
for the Buy America Act has led the Made in the USA Foundation, American
Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) Council 26,
and two local AFSCME unions to file a lawsuit today against the Library of
Congress.</B>
<P>
<B>In 1990, the Library of Congress initiated the American Memory Project,
a pilot project to digitize important works maintained by the Library. Since
that time, the American Memory Project has become a part of the new National
Digital Library. But the Library of Congress chose to ignore the Buy America
Act by entering into contracts for the American Memory Project which called
for work to be performed in Jamaica and the Philippines. The Buy America
Act mandates that government agencies use American goods and services whenever
possible.</B>
<P>
<B>Joel Joseph, chairman of the Made in the USA Foundation, stated: "The
Information Superhighway has been sold to the American public as a great
engine of job creation. But to be successful, the information highway must
not be a freeway encouraging job transfers to the lowest cost workers overseas.
If the Library of Congress has to go to the Philippines to create the National
Digital Library of the United States, then the Internet is doomed to be a
one-way road to the unemployment lines for millions of Americans." </B>
<P>
<B> Automated Sciences Group and Systems Integration Group, Inc. were contracted
to produce a CD-ROM containing two collections for the American Memory Project
as well as a digital product of various texts for the National Digital Library.
Today's lawsuit charges that both contractors falsely submitted documents
to the government for payment under contract, by intentionally and willfully
violating that contract. The suit also claims that the two companies made
misleading assertions that they would comply with the Buy America Act.</B>
<P>
<B>Congressman James Traficant (D-OH), a strong supporter of the Buy America
Act, said that the Library of Congress should have worked harder to use American
workers for the project. Traficant also said that the existing contracts
should be inspected carefully by Congress.</B>
<P>
<B>"Having spent the better part of my Congressional career fighting to ensure
that federal agencies comply with both the letter and the spirit of the Buy
America Act, I find this latest incident quite disturbing," he said. "The
manner in which this contract was awarded should be closely scrutinized by
Congress and the Library's own procurement personnel. If procurement rules
and Federal laws regarding Buy American were violated, then the contract
should be null and void."</B>
<P>
<B>"More importantly," Congressman Traficant continued, "the Library of Congress
should've made a better effort to reach out to American firms and ensure
that all of the work on this contract would be done in this country."</B>
<P>
<B>The suit filed by the Made in the USA Foundation and AFSCME places blame
not only on the contractors, but also on the Library of Congress. Made in
the USA and AFSCME charge that the Librarian of Congress either knew or should
have known that the work was performed outside the United States and that
the U.S. content of the final product was minimal.</B>
<P>
<B>Joel Stern, president of Local 2477 of the American Federation of State,
County and Municipal Employees, explained why the Library's actions should
serve as warning to workers throughout the U.S. "Seeking bargain basement
wage rates overseas is bad for everyone. It depresses wages here at home
and exploits sub-human wage rates abroad. The saving s realized by the
subcontractor in this situation didn't save American tax-payers any money;
it just boosted his own profit margin. It's wrong for the Library of Congress
to be associated with this kind of profiteering. Everyone comes out ahead
when people get a real living wage for the work they do."</B>
<P>
<B>The Made in the USA Foundation is a non-profit organization with 60,000
members nationwide. The Foundation is dedicated to promoting American products
and seeks the enforcement of laws meant to improve U.S. balance of payments,
like the Buy America Act. The two AFSCME locals that are joining the Made
in the USA Foundation in filing the lawsuit are AFSCME Local 2477 and Local
2910, which both represent Library of Congress Employees. AFSCME Council
26 represents employees in a number of federal agencies, including the Library
of Congress. </B>
