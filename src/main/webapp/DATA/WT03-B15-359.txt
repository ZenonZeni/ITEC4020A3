<HR>
<H1><A NAME="HDRCIDSYSL" HREF="icsur007.html#PToC_66">Appendix A. Installing with SystemView</A></H1>
Installing with SystemView
<P>You can use SystemView to install the Internet Connection Server on
unattended workstations using the statements included in
two files called a <I>software profile</I> and a
<I>response file</I>.
A software profile is used by SystemView to
invoke an application installation program.
A response file is used by the installation program to get all of the
data it needs during the installation process.
<P>
Using SystemView, you specify the information for the software profile
and response files when you customize the application definition
file, which defines how to install and configure the Internet Connection Server.
This file is shipped with the Internet Connection Server.
<P>Refer to the SystemView documentation for a complete description
of software profiles and response files.
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Header_67" HREF="icsur007.html#PToC_67">Overview</A></H2>
<P>To install the Internet Connection Server on server workstations
using SystemView, you need to:
<UL>
<P><LI>Copy the Internet Connection Server files to the code server
<P><LI>Add the Internet Connection Server information to the SystemView software library
<P><LI>Configure the Internet Connection Server in the SystemView software library
by placing it into the catalog at the distribution server
<P><LI>Distribute and install the resulting software object
using SystemView on target server workstations
</UL>
<P>These tasks are described in the following sections.
If you need additional assistance to perform these
tasks, use the online help or refer to
<CITE>SystemView Up and Running&#33;</CITE> for more information.
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Header_68" HREF="icsur007.html#PToC_68">Copying the Internet Connection Server to the Code Server</A></H2>
<P>
To set up the code server so that you can install the Internet Connection Server
using SystemView, enter the XCOPY command.
<P>
For example, to copy the files from the CD-ROM located in the
E&#58; drive to the D&#58; drive, you would enter this command:
<PRE>
XCOPY E&#58;\*.* D&#58;\CID\IMG\WEB /S
</PRE>
<P>
This command copies the files from the root directory
on the CD-ROM in the E: drive to the D: drive,
putting the files under the directory \CID\IMG\WEB.
<P>
The /S indicates that all of the subdirectories and their contents
and the contents of the root directory should be copied.
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Header_69" HREF="icsur007.html#PToC_69">Adding the Internet Connection Server to the Software Library</A></H2>
<P>
To add the Internet Connection Server to the software library, do the following steps:
<UL>
<P><LI>Start SystemView.
<P><LI>Double-click on the <B>SystemView Service Manager</B> icon.
<P><LI>Double-click on the <B>CID Software Preparation</B> icon.
<P><LI>Double-click on the <B>Software Library</B> icon.
<P><LI>Select <B>Software</B> from the menu bar
on the Software Library window.
<P><LI>Select <B>New&#46;&#46;&#46;</B>.
<P><LI>Select <B>Find...</B>.
<P><LI>In the Find definition file window, select:
<UL COMPACT>
<LI>The drive letter, where the CD-ROM is located,
in the <B>Drive</B> list
<LI>\ in the <B>Directory</B> list
<LI>www.adf in the <B>File</B> list
</UL>
<P>
This copies the remote installation files (.ADF, .VAR, and .MRF)
from the CD-ROM to the subdirectory where SystemView resides (\SWLIB).
<P><LI>Select <B>Add</B> to associate the application
definition file with the Internet Connection Server.
</UL>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="HDRCONFSR" HREF="icsur007.html#PToC_70">Configuring the Internet Connection Server</A></H2>
<P>To configure the Internet Connection Server, do the following steps:
<UL>
<P><LI>Double-click on the Internet Connection Server icon in the Software Library window.
<P><LI>Select <B>Configuration</B> from the menu bar on the
Software Configuration window and then select
<B>New&#46;&#46;&#46;</B> from the pull-down window.
</UL>
<P>
The Settings notebook is displayed.
You need to define how the Internet Connection Server will be installed
on the target server workstation.
<P>On each page of the notebook,
select each of the items in the <B>Variables</B>
list and choose the setting.
A description of each variable is displayed in the
<B>Explanation</B> field of the notebook page.
When you have completed all of the pages of the notebook,
click on <B>OK</B>.
If you are ready to distribute the Internet Connection Server, select <B>Yes</B>
when asked <B>Do you want to catalog the database?</B>.
<P>
Here is an overview of just a few of the pages you will fill in.
<DL>
<P><DT><B>Configuration Page
</B><DD>
Use to define both an identifier needed to catalog
the Internet Connection Server uniquely and a name that is a short description
for the configuration you are creating.
For example, the identifier may be <TT>EUROSERV</TT>
and the name may be <TT>Definition for the servers in Europe</TT>.
<P><DT><B>Code Server Page
</B><DD>
Use to associate the configuration with the redirection
mechanism to be used during CID installation.
Define the code server aliases and the CID directory
aliases that let the target workstation (where you want to
install the Internet Connection Server) access the code server images.
You also indicate whether an existing or new response
file will be used.
<P><DT><B>Response File Page
</B><DD>
Use to specify the name and directory where the existing
response file is located.
</DL>
<P>The remaining pages of the Settings notebook configure
the Internet Connection Server at the target server workstation.  SystemView uses
the information from the notebook to create the settings
for the Internet Connection Server variables in the response file.
Refer to the comments in the response file itself
(websrvr.rsp.) for more information about response file keywords.
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Header_71" HREF="icsur007.html#PToC_71">Installing the Internet Connection Server on a Remote Server Workstation</A></H2>
<P>
To install the Internet Connection Server on a workstation, you can either use
the Event Scheduler or the Remote System Manager.
Refer to
<CITE>SystemView Up and Running&#33;</CITE> for
information on how to use the Event Scheduler
and the Remote System Manager.
This book also contains information about changing
variables at installation time.
