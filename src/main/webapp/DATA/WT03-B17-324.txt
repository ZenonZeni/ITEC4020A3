<HR>
      For Immediate Relief:  First do the obvious,
         1..... is the tree being watered properly?
         2..... is it being fed properly?
         3..... is it under stress?
         4..... is it damaged?
         5..... is a bug attacking it?
         6..... is a disease attacking it?
         If any one or more of the above is a yes then we have a path to follow in
healing the tree(s).<BR>
<HR>
1...... If it needs watering give it a good slow  soaking. Use a soaker hose
 or a drip system. Give it  a good slow watering for 10 hrs if possible.
        Use a garden filter  if possible.
         2.......Feed it compost or a thin layer of rock dust and
                 mulch well. Avoid chemical fertilizers.

         3.......What is causing this stress? Look around the tree,
                 is it in a bad place? are dogs peeing on it?

         4.......Does it have car damage? Look carefully.  Try to remove the
 problem.

         5.......If you know that a bug is attacking it, leave me email
and I will get  back to you (IGA members only).

         6.......If you know its disease, attack,  then leave email and I will get back
 to you (sorry IGA members only). Non members can send in their questions and
 I will post it in FAQ

     Remember this is only temporary, if you are a IGA member,
                    you should

          1....read  Tree  facts in my book
          2....read  Tree  chapter in book "Natural Pest Control" which you
          recieved free when joining. If you do not have this book you can
          obtain it either by joining IGA or buying the book for $20.00
