<h2>SJR 8, Mello: Controlled substances cannabis/marijuana </h2>

<p>This measure would memorialize the President and the Congress
of the United States to enact appropriate legislation to permit
cannabis/marijuana to be prescribed by licensed physicians and to
ensure a safe and affordable supply of cannabis/marijuana for
medical use </p>

<p>WHEREAS, Scientific and medical studies by the National
Academy of Science have shown cannabis/marijuana to be a safe and
effective medicine with very low toxicity compared to most
prescription drugs and it has been shown to be effective in the
treatment of glaucoma, epilepsy, muscle spasticity, arthritis,
the nausea, vomiting, and appetite loss associated with
chemotherapies;anxiety and depression and the symptoms of
withdrawal from alcohol and narcotics and </p>

<p>WHEREAS studies show that one-third of all cancer patient
discontinue potentially life-saving chemotherapy due to the
severe and debilitating side effects and the same is true for
many AIDS patients receiving AZT or other similar therapies and </p>

<p>WHEREAS, Most physicians surveyed said that they would
prescribe cannabis/marijuana if legally available, and one-half
of all cancer specialists surveyed said that they have already
encouraged at least one of their patients to break the law and
use cannabis/marijuana to ease the violent nausea and vomiting
associated with their current treatments and </p>

<p>WHEREAS, In May of 1991, the United Nations Narcotic Control
Board voted overwhelmingly to reclassify cannabis/marijuana,
placing it back on Schedule II, and making it availabIe by
prescription, and, the United States representative to this board
voted in favor of the rescheduling and </p>

<p>WHEREAS, Despite a federal court order recognizing the
&quot;clearly established medical valuc&quot; of
cannabis/marijuana, and mandating that it be reclassified to
Schedule II and made available by prescription, the federal
government continues to deny access to this safe and effective
medicine and </p>

<p>WHEREAS, By its own admission, the federal government
continues to deny access to cannabis/marijuana for political
rather than medical reasons, and are using patients as pawns in
the ever-escalating war on drugs by following current policies
which place message before medicine, convenience before
compassion, and politics before patients now, therefore, be it </p>

<p>Resolved by the Senate and Assembly of the State of
California, jointly, That the Legislature of the State of
California respectfully memorializes the President and the
Congress of the United States to enact appropriate legislation to
permit cannabis/marijuana to be prescribed by licensed physicians
and to ensure a safe and affordable supply of cannabis/marijuana
for medical use; and be it further </p>

<p>Resolved, That the Secretary of the Senate transmit copies of
this resolution to the President and Vice President of the United
States, to the Speaker of the House of Representatives, and to
each Senator and Representative from California in the Congress
of the United States. </p>
