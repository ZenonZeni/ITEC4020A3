<p><i>(Gus Hall is national chairman of the Communist Party USA. 
The following article is taken from his report to the 
CPUSA's national board Nov.23-24.)</i></p>

<p>The activities, role, relations and achievements of the 
Party in the 96 elections call for a new estimate and a 
whole new concept of the Communist Party in our country.</p>

<p>We need a revised concept of the Party in order to 
realistically set our sights, our goals, our plans for the 
post-election period. We should base it on all that is new, 
emerging and developing in the Party, within the framework 
of a new situation in the country and in the class struggle.</p>

<p>Otherwise, we will not see, and therefore not realize, the 
vast new potential in just about every area of life and 
struggle, especially in our working and fraternal relations 
with the trade union movement, the AFL-CIO, but just as 
important the individual unions, their leadership and rank 
and file. Our mass relations are on a new level.</p>

<p>We are in the process of building a mass Communist Party. 
New developments, especially as a result of the elections, 
add new dimensions to our consideration of a new mass party, 
especially the much greater possibilities of recruiting 
workers, trade unionists and mass leaders.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most exciting and most potentially explosive 
developments are the responses to our People's Weekly World 
events by unions, leaders and activists and to our electoral 
role. These are very much interconnected.</p>

<p>Our electoral policy - especially our emphasis on the lesser 
evil approach and our singular contribution in educating, 
agitating and organizing against the fascist danger - 
greatly enhanced the respect of the trade union movement for 
our Party and opened up doors to winning workers and trade 
unionists to our politics and ideology. Our trade union 
relations are on a new level.</p>

<p>The electoral work of our our state organizations, 
especially in working with labor to defeat the ultra-right 
candidates, has gained the Party broader acceptance and 
influence. Some have won new respect in helping to build 
electoral coalitions. Some have achieved new mutually 
beneficial working relationships with local, city and state 
labor bodies, trade union activists and leaders. The base of 
support of many of our state and district organizations has 
significantly widened among all sectors of the people.</p>

<p>Our efforts in building support of the Martinez public works 
jobs bill, especially on the West Coast and in the trade 
union movement, has also raised our standing. In the post-
election period this movement has the makings of a 
successful national, mass campaign.</p>

<p>We will have a special meeting on the bill to discuss its 
status and lay plans for our role in helping to build a 
nationwide movement that unites labor and people's movement 
in support of massive jobs legislation. The impending cuts 
in welfare, that will throw millions of poor and oppressed 
peoples and especially disabled and poor children into 
deeper destitution and despair, are fast becoming an 
emergency crisis.</p>

<p>The special racist and anti-children impact, the anti-
immigration attacks and the workfare issue make the creation 
of millions of new, public works jobs an emergency, 
immediate priority. Parallel with this struggle, we must 
also help build a movement to compel Clinton to keep his 
promise to review and work to undo the damage of the 
Republican welfare bill he signed.</p>

<p>The ultra-right danger has been blunted. This is a 
tremendous achievement. The American people have rejected 
the Contract on America.</p>

<p>The Republican Party, calling for "cooperation" instead of 
"confrontation," is sounding more and more like phony 
liberals trying desperately to change its image because of 
the elections. They know they cannot return to the new 
Congress displaying the same reactionary bluster, arrogance 
and pushing openly anti-people policies. But everything has 
changed.</p>

<p>The trade union movement will never be the same. The 
communities of the racially and nationally oppressed will 
never be the same. The mass movements will never be the 
same. All labor and people's forces are in a new, more 
powerful position. The challenge now is to build on these 
changes and to continue moving in a positive direction to 
win new victories and further defeat the ultra-right in the 
New Year.</p>

<p>In light of our new achievements, to enable us to grow and 
to deepen our unique contributions to the class struggle and 
mass movements, I propose we adopt five main challenges for 
the immediate period ahead.</p>

<h3>1. We have to grow</h3>

<p>In many ways the biggest challenge is how to continue to 
recruit, how to make winning people to our Party a part of 
our everyday activities. And, how to consolidate all the new 
members.</p>

<p>The main approach to consolidation must be how to activate 
new members. The challenge is how to involve new members in 
mass struggles and actions, how to draw them out, onto 
picketlines, to distribute our newspaper on the streets, to 
hold forums that are relevant to their lives and, 
especially, conduct social affairs that will bring people 
out and together.</p>

<p>Club meetings should be a part of the activating process, 
but not the only approach. By now experience has proven that 
invitations to meetings alone are doomed to failure.</p>

<p>Consolidation and activization should be a single process. 
We cannot consolidate without activating new members.</p>

<h3>2. Winning workers</h3>

<p>The base of our Party is, and must be, industrial workers. 
Recruiting and consolidating workers cannot be achieved in 
the same way as mass, street recruiting. It is different and 
in some ways more difficult.</p>

<p>Thus, the second challenge we face is the re-establishment 
of our policy of industrial concentration. This must include 
regular distribution of the People's Weekly World at 
shopgates, the regular publication of special, industrial 
issues of the paper, the publication of regular shop papers. 
It includes drawing up district and club industrial 
concentration plans of work.</p>

<h3>3. The Party and labor</h3>

<p>The third challenge is how we can be more helpful in helping 
the trade union movement with its new challenges and 
problems.</p>

<p>For example, while there is some successful organizing of 
the unorganized, the majority of the working class remains 
unorganized. At the same time, the basic corporate policy 
remains the destruction of the trade unions. The 
corporations are especially committed to this goal because 
they are well aware that they will be forced to deal with a 
new, class struggle oriented trade union movement.</p>

<p>We have to play a role in helping to build labor's political 
independence. The potential is now tremendous. However, it 
is problematic whether the Labor Party can play a leading 
role in establishing labor's political independence in light 
of their non-involvement during the presidential elections. 
We should work to convince the Labor Party that their policy 
is wrong and help move them into electoral activities, if 
possible. Without some basic changes, the labor movement 
will not accept the Labor Party as a viable channel for 
labor's political independence.</p>

<p>We have to continue the correct tactic of building the 
united front that we pursued during the election campaign. 
The differences that mainly dissipated should not be the 
basis for post-election differences.</p>

<p>In fact, one of our immediate tasks should be to build unity 
with all progressive political forces. Everything is 
different now. We must reach out, seek for common ground and 
build unity in struggle with all forces, including those we 
may have had differences with during the election period. 
That is over now. There is a new situation.</p>

<p>Post-election tactics must be based on unity in struggle. 
This should include post-election unity of the trade union 
movement; post election unity in the area of independent 
political action; post-election unity in the struggle 
against racism, against chauvinism; post-election unity in 
the struggles of the unemployed and the homeless; post-
election unity in building a movement to win the Martinez 
Public Works legislation; post-election unity in the 
struggles against privatization to save public education and 
the environment.</p>

<p>We also face a challenge in building on the higher level of 
working relations we have developed especially with trade 
union forces, but also with many communities and people's 
organizations.</p>

<p>There is a new openness, a new willingness to work openly 
with, accept and respect Communists as part of coalitions, 
alliances and campaigns.</p>

<h3>4. Renewed struggle vs. racism</h3>

<p>A fourth challenge is to find ways to stimulate and activate 
the struggle against racism. We have to find ways to 
refresh, replace and restore the affirmative action programs 
that have been destroyed and play a role in the fight 
against the implementation of proposition 209 in California. 
In the struggle against racism, we have to intensify the 
struggle against police brutality, criminalization and the 
horrendous, racist cuts in welfare programs, at the same 
time fighting for jobs, not workfare.</p>

<p>We have to play a leading role in the struggle against the 
vicious, chauvinist, racist and anti-immigrant campaigns 
raging in many states. We have to take on the new level of 
anti-Semitism, especially in New York.</p>

<p>We have to convince and help the trade union movement become 
a more effective, powerful instrument in the struggle 
against racism, especially in the shops. We must raise the 
level of educational work within the Party as part of the 
struggle against racism, chauvinism and anti-Semitism.</p>

<h3>5. Financial questions</h3>

<p>In order to continue and increase our role and work, to 
build the Party and the movements, we have to accept a fifth 
main challenge - to change our attitude toward party 
finances.</p>

<p>Most wrong attitudes are fed by a main misconception that 
there are really no limits to our funds. Therefore, at times 
we make political decisions without any consideration about 
whether we can afford to carry them out. Making politically 
correct decisions does not mean our decisions are 
financially correct.</p>

<p>As a result of this discussion we must make concrete plans 
for a new advanced gift and wills campaign and a whole new 
set of attitudes toward our overall finances and building 
our "advanced gift" funds.</p>

<p>We are now in a position to set the stage for a successful 
campaign and to show potential contributors and investors 
that we have proven our ability to invest and secure their 
money in accord with their wishes and needs, and at the same 
time to benefit the Party and the paper.</p>

<p>Based on our great achievements, I am confident that we can 
meet all the challenges. I am confident that we can and will 
make all the adjustments and changes necessary to accomplish 
everything we set out to do in the coming post-election 
period.</p>
