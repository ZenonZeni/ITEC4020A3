<p><strong>Fort Sam Houston Demonstration Evaluates Performance of 
York International Triathlon Heat Pump</strong>

<p><em>Triathlon features inherent load matching capability</em>

<p>The York International Triathlon was installed in a single family 
home at Fort Sam Houston, San Antonio, Texas, in June 1994, and 
monitored for both cooling and heating performance through June 
1995.  The Triathlon is a three-ton, gas-engine-driven heat pump.  
A single-cylinder, four stroke 5-hp engine fueled by natural gas 
drives the heat pump's compressor.  A distinctive feature of the 
technology is an inherent load-matching capability.  The heat pump 
can vary engine speed and blower fan speed, and thereby dynamically 
control capacity to balance with thermal loads.  The balance 
minimizes the need for cycling and reduces the associated thermal 
losses, fluctuations in room temperature and humidity, and equipment 
wear.  

<p>

<p>In the heating season, the gas heat pump provides supply-air 
temperatures warmer than conventional heat pumps because of 
waste-heat recovery from the engine.  The waste heat is delivered 
via a water-glycol loop to a separate radiator in the indoor unit.  
This feature eliminates the uncomfortably cool supply air produced 
by electric heat pumps during defrost cycles and periods of low 
outdoor ambient temperatures.  The heat recovery also improves 
heating capacity.  Compared to electric heat pumps, the gas heat 
pump has nearly twice the heating capacity at 0 F.  Recovered heat 
can also be used for domestic hot water heating.  On summer days, it 
can meet up to 100% of water heating needs, though water heating 
performance was not specifically monitored during the demonstration.

<p>In the demonstration, the Triathlon was compared to three units 
representing the range of HVAC systems at Fort Sam Houston, from the 
best available (pulse-combustion furnaces and air conditioners with 
scroll compressors) to the oldest of the Fort's conventional air 
conditioners and furnaces.  Through life-cycle costing methods, the 
cost-effectiveness of the Triathlon was measured for five other 
federal sites:  Naval Air Station Willow Grove, Fort Irwin, Fort 
Dix, Fort Drum, and Fort Stewart.

<p><em>Triathlon proves reliable during demonstration</em>

<p>Findings from the summer-cooling test demonstrated the Triathlon 
gas heat pump to be a reliable system.  There were no forced outages 
during the cooling test, giving the unit a 100% reliability record 
during the summer.  However, during the heating season the 
availability of the unit was less than 100%, with two downtimes due 
to a discharge flange gasket leak and a failed starter motor; 
pre-production design deficiencies leading to the component failure 
have been corrected in all Triathlon production units.

<p><em>Triathlon meets needs for occupant comfort</em>

<p>The occupants concluded that the gas heat pump provided good 
comfort levels with acceptable levels of operating noise.  
Monitoring of indoor humidity during cooling operation showed nearly 
identical average humidity levels (and associated comfort) by the 
Triathlon and comparison air conditioners during the summer test.  
Monitoring of indoor temperatures during heating operation showed 
the variable-speed gas heat pump to provide better temperature 
control than the comparison systems.

<p><em>Triathlon demonstrates superior energy performance</em>
<p>The Triathlon demonstrated a thermal coefficient of performance 
(COP) of 1.128 during the summer-cooling test and 1.278 during the 
winter-heating test, operating at the manufacturer's anticipated 
performance levels, and demonstrating performance levels slightly 
above those established in the Phase I Field Test program conducted 
by the unit's developers.  

<p>The Triathlon yielded a reduction in cooling-energy costs over 
the conventional air conditioners at Fort Sam Houston.  In a normal 
summer at the San Antonio test house, it uses 41.5 kcf of gas and 
864 kWh of electricity.  This amount of fuel costs $224 (based on 
internal commercial gas and electricity rates established at Fort 
Sam Houston) and corresponds to a savings of $37 to $59 over the 
three comparison air conditioners in this field test.  The savings 
relative to the best of the comparison units (10.45 seasonal energy 
efficiency rating or SEER) was $37 (14.2%).

<p>The gas heat pump demonstrated a reduction in heating-energy 
costs from those recorded for the condensing furnaces existing at 
the base.  In a normal winter at the San Antonio test house, it uses 
27.9 kcf of gas and 510 kWh of electricity.  This amount of fuel 
costs $147 and corresponds to a savings of $33 (18.3% of Unit 1 
consumption; annual fuel utilization efficiency or AFUE = 97.0%) to 
$101 (40.6% of Unit 3 consumption; AFUE = 69.2%) over the costs 
recorded for the three comparison furnaces in this field test.

<p>However, on a total operating cost basis, the Triathlon does not 
offer annual savings at Fort Sam Houston when compared with the most 
efficient of the three systems in the field comparison.  Lower than 
national-average electricity prices, $100 higher maintenance costs, 
and a mild winter climate all contribute to higher annual-operating 
costs for the gas heat pump, compared to the other units monitored 
during the demonstration.

<p><em>Life-cycle cost comparison shows Triathlon's potential for 
some federal sites.</em>

<p>The life-cycle cost (LCC) of the Triathlon was compared to the 
LCC of three commercially available AC/furnace systems at six 
federal bases.  The assumed system costs are provided in the table 
below:

<pre>
		Triathlon	System A	System B	System C
SEER, Btu/wh	-----		10.2		15.6		12.2
AFUE, %		-----		 97		 97		 80
Annual
Maintenance	$175		$75		$75		$75	
Installed Cost	$8000		$4018		$5917		$3500	

</pre>

<p>The goal of the LCC was to take the thermal performance results 
established at Fort Sam Houston and project them to several 
commercially available AC/furnace systems and make an LCC comparison 
under different fuel pricing and climate situations.  The six 
locations were therefore chosen to reflect the division of fuel 
pricing and climates at U.S. federal facilities.

<p>Of the six bases analyzed, the Triathlon was found cost-effective 
at two:  Willow Grove Naval Air Station in Philadelphia and Fort 
Irwin near Barstow, California.  Both bases had high energy-cost 
savings mainly because of relatively high gas and electric prices.

<p>Willow Grove NAS has an ideal combination of energy-cost saving 
indicators for yielding high gas heat pump savings.  Electricity 
rates are structured to have low base rates with  high demand 
charges.  This results in a large difference in the effective costs 
between gas and electric cooling.  As a result, relatively 
low summer thermal loads yield high cooling energy savings for the 
Triathlon.  Also, low base-rate electricity charges reduce the 
performance penalty the Triathlon receives from having higher fan 
electricity than furnaces during the winter.  Finally, a strong 
winter coupled with higher than average gas prices yields good 
heating season savings.

<p>The Triathlon at Fort Irwin also achieves high energy-cost 
savings with a somewhat different combination of fuel-price and 
thermal-load indicators in comparison to those at Willow Grove NAS.  
The ratio between effective electricity prices and gas prices is 
high for electric systems at Fort Irwin as they are also at Willow 
Grove NAS.  However, the emphasis on demand charges is less.  

<p>The result, when compared to Willow Grove NAS, is slightly higher 
cooling energy savings, but they are achieved because an increase in 
thermal cooling loads compensates for the reduction in price 
advantage.  The lower winter thermal load, lower gas prices, and 
higher base-rate electricity all cause a significant reduction in 
heating-energy-cost savings.  The net result is that the gas heat 
pump shows less LCC advantage over the high-efficiency AC/furnace 
system at Fort Irwin than at Willow Grove NAS.

<p>At a lower price ($6,000 installed) and lower annual maintenance 
cost ($150), Fort Drum (Watertown, NY) and Fort Dix (Trenton, NJ) 
are also shown to be cost-effective locations.  Although the 
standard Triathlon evaluated in this analysis is generally not 
selling at single-unit prices below $6,000, a two-pipe version 
(using electric-resistance back-up heat in substitution for the 
standard gas-boiler auxiliary heater) can offer as much as a $1,000 
reduction in price.  This version is potentially less efficient in 
the heating mode (no engine waste-heat recovery) but could be the 
cost-effective choice in locations with mild heating seasons.  This 
substitution potentially reduces LCC for the Triathlon to a level 
competitive at the remaining two bases, Fort Stewart (near Savannah, 
GA) and Fort Sam Houston (San Antonio, TX).
