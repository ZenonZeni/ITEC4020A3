<H1>Vietnam and climate change</H1>
<HR>
<B>Global warming is likely to change the weather and climate of Vietnam.</B>  
<A HREF = "fs014.html">Climate models</A> can offer useful 
scenarios of climate change at the global level, but they are still unable to make reliable 
and credible <A HREF = "fs018.html">regional and national 
forecasts</A>.  Nevertheless, researchers can determine the likely effects of global 
warming on a particular country by considering its sensitivity to current climatic extremes, 
variations, and trends.  Like other developing countries, Vietnam is heavily dependent on 
natural resources, and any change in the prevailing environmental conditions is likely to 
have serious consequences.  If economic development plans are to prove sustainable over 
many years, policy-makers must take the potential impacts of long-term climate change 
and <A HREF = "fs102.html">sea-level rise</A> into 
account.<P>
<B>Population pressures make Vietnam highly vulnerable to global warming.</B>  
With a current population of around 64 million that is likely to expand to around 80 
million by the year 2000, Vietnam is already densely populated.  The country’s long, 
narrow shape has been likened to a length of bamboo with a basket of rice carried at each 
end - an apt image for an agricultural nation whose two main population and farming 
centres are connected by a narrow, mountainous central region that is unsuitable for 
intensive farming.  The northern Red River Delta and the southern Mekong Delta regions 
will come under increasing pressure if climate change has its predicted effects.<P>
<B><A HREF = "fs102.html">Sea-level rise</A> would 
pose a serious threat to Vietnam’s extensive coastline.</B>  The sea level along parts 
of Vietnam’s coastline of over 3,000 kilometres has already risen by around five 
centimetres over the past 30 years.  With more than half of Vietnam’s people living in the 
low-lying delta regions, any further rise would seriously threaten the nation’s farming, 
fishing, transport, and industrial activities.  Many of the rich natural resources and 
ecosystems on the coast would also be threatened.  In particular, the destruction of 
mangrove forests, which afford natural protection to low-lying areas, would exacerbate 
the consequences of sea-level rise.<P>
<B>Climate change could lead to an increase in weather extremes throughout the 
country.  </B>Vietnam has a tropical, monsoon-influenced climate with marked 
variations in temperature and rainfall.  With its long, narrow land mass stretching from 
north to south, Vietnam’s various regions have mean annual temperatures ranging from 
13 C to 28 C.  The strongest variations in temperature and rainfall occur in the northern 
plains of the Red River Delta and in the coastal areas of central Vietnam.  These areas are 
already vulnerable to weather-related disasters such as typhoons, flooding, and cold spells.  
Drought too can be a problem, particularly in the south.  All of these weather variables 
could change, particularly if, as computerized climate models suggest, global warming 
affects the strength and location of monsoons.  If the monsoons shift northward, for 
example, the rainfall in northern Vietnam would increase.  In the south, meanwhile, water 
availability would probably decline as warmer temperatures encourage evaporation 
losses.<P>
<B><A HREF = "fs101.html">Agriculture</A> is the most 
vulnerable sector of the economy.  </B>Around 80% of Vietnam’s population is rural.  
Rice is the main food crop and contributes significantly to the national economy, 
particularly since increased production in recent years has turned Vietnam into one of the 
world’s major rice exporters.  The nation’s fertile agricultural lands, located in river basins 
and dependent on irrigation, are highly vulnerable to fluctuations in water levels.  The Cuu 
Long Delta in the south already experiences frequent droughts and, every seven years or 
so, severe flooding.  The flow of the great rivers that bring water to Vietnam’s farmlands 
would be affected by changes in temperature and rainfall, as well as by measures taken by 
neighbouring nations in response to water shortages.  This could result in lower crop 
yields and growth rates, the weakening or extinction of particular crop species, increased 
activity by pests and viruses, and a loss of soil fertility.  As the sea-level rises, the intrusion 
of saline water into fresh-water aquifers would affect the availability and quality of water 
resources vital for irrigation and human consumption.  All of these impacts would further 
stress Vietnam’s already limited area of intensively farmed agricultural land.<P>
<B>A National Climate Action Plan has been established by the 
Hydrometeorological Service at the request of the Vietnamese government.</B>  The 
Action Plan aims to balance development needs with environmental protection.  Its 
priorities include strengthening the collection of data on climate, weather, and hydrology; 
assessing greenhouse gas emissions and strategies for reducing them; and raising 
awareness of the causes and likely impacts of climate change.  These activities would 
promote the formulation of policies for improving Vietnam’s ability to withstand the likely 
impacts of climate change and to reduce its own emissions of greenhouse gases.<P>
<B>Vietnam’s greenhouse gas emissions are low by world standards but they are 
likely to rise.</B>  The country’s major source of emissions is deforestation and other 
changes in land use which, according to one estimate, produced some 60 million tonnes of 
carbon a year during the late 1980s.  This was ten times more than the quantity released by 
its <A HREF = "fs025.html">burning of fossil fuels</A>.  
Massive deforestation resulted from the doubling of the population from the 1940s to the 
1980s as well as from the ravages of war.  In response, the government has initiated a 
National Conservation Strategy for limiting population growth, encouraging agro-forestry 
and reforestation, and establishing more nature reserves.  But while greenhouse gas 
emissions from deforestation are likely to start declining, economic growth and 
industrialization will increase emissions from energy use, perhaps by a factor of three by 
the year 2010.<P>
