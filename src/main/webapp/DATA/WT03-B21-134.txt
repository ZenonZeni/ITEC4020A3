				<TD ALIGN=LEFT><B>The Casa Berardi mine is located in northwestern Quebec, 100 kilometres north of the town of La Sarre. The mine produced 61,200 ounces of gold in 1995 compared to 100,100 ounces in 1994 primarily as the result of increased emphasis on the development of new mining stopes. Cash costs increased to $449 per ounce in 1995, because of the reduced production, the higher development costs and emphasis on backfill.</B>

		<P><IMG SRC="/images/CasaBerardi1.jpg" ALT="Casa Berardi Mine" ALIGN=right WIDTH=350 HEIGHT=476 BORDER=0>TVX Gold has a 60% interest in Casa Berardi and is the operator. The remaining 40% interest is held by Golden Knight Resources Inc. The property covers approximately 15,000 hectares over a 35 kilometre stretch of land along the Casa Berardi fault. Mining occurs on a 5 kilometre strike length encompassing the Est and Ouest mines and the Principale orebody which is located between the two mines.
<P>Proven and probable reserves at Casa Berardi at the end of 1995 contained approximately 1.3 million ounces of gold. A major underground drilling program is expected to upgrade and increase reserves, especially in the Principale Zone which is currently estimated to contain over 600,000 ounces in geological resources. This deep exploration program will continue throughout 1996 and 1997.
<P>Located within the Abitibi greenstone belt of the Canadian Precambrian Shield, the Casa Berardi gold deposits lie within a 1-2 kilometre thick sequence of intermixed volcanic flows and pyroclastics, coarse to fine classic and chemical sediments, which are bound to the north and south by iron formation. These volcanic and sedimentary rocks appear to thicken and contain a higher proportion of volcanic units to the east, suggesting that an ancient volcanic centre may be located in that direction.
<P>Economic gold mineralization occurs within quartz-carbonate vein complexes and stockworks and in zones of silicification, and sericite-carbonate wallrock alteration. Gold is present as fine free gold in quartz veins or in intimate association with disseminated pyrite and arsenopyrite in the zones of silicification and wallrock alteration.
<P>The Est and Ouest mines located about five kilometres apart, are currently being mined at Casa Berardi. Sublevel longitudinal longhole mining with delayed backfill is the main mining method and ore from both mines is treated in a common carbon-in-leach milling facility located at theEst mine. The mill is capable of processing 2,400 tonnes of ore per day.
<P>With the acquisition by the joint venture partners in July 1994 of a full 100% interest in a property containing part of the Principale ore zone, the Casa Berardi joint venture embarked on a major $22 million deep development program. The objective of the program is to allow for more efficient and expeditious mining of the Principale zone as well as providing for exploration at depth and expansion of production. The new 340-metre shaft sunk near the existing Est mine surface plant was commissioned in December 1995 and is currently providing access to the Est mine. The 4.5-kilometre tunnel being developed at the 300-metre level to link the Est and Ouest mines with the Principale orebody is expected to be completed in April 1996. This will allow ore and waste from all operations to be rail hauled underground and hoisted to surface instead of being trucked up each mine's ramp. The complete development program, when finished, will allow Casa Berardi’s annual production to increase to 800,000 tonnes annually.
<P>Development of the Principale deposit from the 300-level tunnel began in February of 1996 with production expected during the second quarter of 1996.
<P>Total production from Casa Berardi in 1996 is planned to be 100,000 ounces of gold.
