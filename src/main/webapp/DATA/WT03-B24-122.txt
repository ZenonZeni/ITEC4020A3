<H1>NIS&T Key Escrow Export Meeting Information</H1>
<h2>The NIS&T meeting on key escrow export</h2>
The Clinton Administration is revising parts of the 
ill fated Clipper initiative. The key action was a two day long
meeting on key escrow and export regulations that took place
September 6 and 7, 1995.

<li><a href="./nist/tis.html"> TIS's comments on the criteria</a>
<li>During the first breakout session, in the technical discussion
of criteria # 5 and #6, an authorless (presumably government issued)
"Example Potential Solutions" paper was distributed. It caused a lot
of grumbling amongst the attendees, as they were supposed to discuss it,
without any prior chance to read or react to it. Here are two versions
of it, First,
<a href="./nist/sample_solutions.html"> 
Anonymous Sample Solutions (HTML by PDF)</a> 
and a simple ASCII version <a href="./nist/sample_solutions.txt">
Sample Solutions (ASCII text by John Young)</a>
<p>
I have not seen an electronic version of the paper that I received. It
contains the following paragraph:
<p>
"Example Solutions to export criteria 5 and 6 are identified below to help
give a better feel for approaches that implementors may take to satisfy the criteria. The information in
this paper is not intended to represent fail-safe, cookie cutter solutions to
the criteria, but only to 
generate more detailed discussions."
<p>
It is also interesting to note that John Young has an electronic document
with all of the sample solutions (a solution for each of the ten criteria).
I never saw a paper document with all ten solutions. The one that was 
handed to me had only two criteria, #5 and #6. I talked to attendees
of other breakouts, and they had received nothing.
