<h2>Appendix A<br>
Evolution of the Civilian Radioactive Waste Management Program</h2>
<hr>
<em>Appendix A </em>describes the genesis of this Nation's efforts to resolve the radioactive waste
management problem, the development of an international consensus on geologic disposal, the
key provisions of and revisions to the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, and the oversight and
system components of the Civilian Radioactive Waste Management Program.
<p>
<h4>Development of Radioactive Waste Management Policy
</h4><p>
<strong>United States' Efforts Begin</strong><br>
The strategy of geologic disposal for the long-term isolation of spent nuclear fuel and high-level
radioactive waste dates back several decades. In the mid-1950s, the National Academy of
Sciences considered the disposal of defense-related high-level radioactive waste. In 1957, the
Academy concluded that radioactive wastes could be disposed of safely in a variety of geologic
media within the United States. The Academy noted, however, the technical and institutional
uncertainties involved in implementing a geologic repository strategy, and assumed that
significant research would be necessary and substantial costs incurred before a final conclusion
could be reached on the feasibility, reliability, and safety of geologic disposal. At the same time,
the nationwide screening for suitable repository sites began and continued through the early
1980s.
<p>
<strong>International Consensus on Geologic Disposal</strong><br>

In parallel with the evolution of the United States' policy, geologic disposal also emerged as the
international community's consensus strategy for managing the permanent disposal of highly
radioactive wastes.
<p>
In 1985, the Nuclear Energy Agency of the Organization of Economic Cooperation and
Development,  an international organization of 23 countries (including the United States)
cooperating in the development of peaceful uses of nuclear energy, reported a high degree of
confidence worldwide that disposal systems in deep geologic structures can be designed and
operated safely to assure long-term isolation of spent nuclear fuel or high-level radioactive waste.
In 1995, the Nuclear Energy Agency reaffirmed the international consensus in its report <em>The
Environmental and Ethical Basis of Geologic Disposal: A Collective Opinion of the Radioactive
Waste Management Committee of the OECD.</em> The Agency asserted that:
<p>
<em>". . . our responsibilities to future generations are better discharged by a strategy of final disposal
than by reliance on stores which require surveillance, bequeath long-term responsibilities of care,
and may in due course be neglected by future societies whose structural stability should not be
presumed."
</em>
<p>
<strong>Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982
</strong><br>
In 1982, Congress passed the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, which established the Office of Civilian
Radioactive Waste Management within the Department of Energy. The Act adopted geologic
disposal as the Nation's long-term strategy for the safe isolation of radioactive waste and
confirmed the Federal Government’s responsibility for managing and disposing of commercial
spent nuclear fuel. The Act directed the Department to identify three potential sites for the first
repository and to conduct a multi-year evaluation, known as site characterization, of each of the
three sites. This provision was later amended to terminate  site characterization at all sites except
the Yucca Mountain site in Nevada.
<p>
Following site characterization, the Secretary of Energy may decide to recommend a site for
development as a repository. If the President accepts the Secretary's recommendation, the Act
directs the President to submit a recommendation of the site to Congress. The site designation
becomes effective 60 days after the President's recommendation, unless in the interim a notice of
disapproval is submitted by the Governor and legislature of the State in which the site is located,
or by the governing body of an Indian tribe on whose reservation the site is located. If such a
notice is submitted, the site would be disapproved unless within 90 days of the submittal
Congress passes a resolution of siting approval. If the President recommends a site and it is not
disapproved, the Act directs the Department to submit an application to the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission for a license authorizing repository construction. If the application is approved and
construction proceeds, the Act requires the Department to apply to the Commission for additional
licensing authority to begin accepting waste into the repository, and ultimately to close the
facility permanently when waste emplacement is completed.
<p>
The Act limits the quantity of waste to be stored in the first repository to 70,000 metric tons of
heavy metal until a second repository is in operation. The Act provides for the disposal of
defense-related high-level radioactive waste, contingent upon a Presidential determination that
such waste could be disposed of in a geologic repository along with commercial waste. In 1985,
the President found no basis to conclude that a defense-only repository was required, and
therefore, under provisions of the Act, the Department is to proceed with plans and actions to
dispose of defense waste with commercial spent nuclear fuel in a single repository.
<p>
The Act directs that activities associated with the management and disposal of civilian spent fuel
conducted under the Act be funded through a fee on the commercial generation of nuclear power.
The fee was set initially at 1.0 mil per kilowatt-hour, to be deposited into the Nuclear Waste
Fund. The Secretary of Energy is directed to review the fee amount annually to determine its
adequacy to meet Federal Government costs of managing civilian spent fuel, and to propose
adjustments as needed to ensure full cost recovery. Costs associated with the disposal of
high-level radioactive waste from defense activities are to be paid by the Federal Government.
<p>
The Act authorized the Secretary to enter into contracts with utilities for the acceptance and
disposal of spent nuclear fuel. These contracts, which came to be known as the Standard
Contracts for Disposal of Spent Nuclear Fuel and/or High-Level Radioactive Waste (10 CFR Part
961), were promulgated through rulemaking and provide that the Department will:
<p>
<ul>
<li>take title to the spent nuclear fuel as expeditiously as practicable following
commencement of operation of a repository, and
<li>in return for the payment of fees, beginning not later than January 31, 1998, dispose of
such spent nuclear fuel.<a href="./foota.htm">[1]</a>
</ul><p>
The Act directed the Department of Energy to study the need for and feasibility of a monitored
retrievable storage facility for the purpose of storing nuclear waste on an interim basis prior to
disposing of it permanently in an underground repository and to submit to Congress a
site-specific proposal for such a facility. It also required the Federal Government to transport
spent nuclear fuel to a Federal storage facility, utilizing private industry to the fullest extent
possible. 
<p>
The Act defines certain units of government as "affected" because of their jurisdiction over the
site of a proposed geologic repository or monitored retrievable storage facility, and permits the
Secretary of Energy to designate additional units of local government as "affected" because of
their proximity to such sites. It requires the Department to provide financial assistance to support
participation of parties with "affected" status.
<p>
The Department was directed to issue general guidelines for the recommendation of sites for
repositories, which were finalized in December 1984 as <em>General Guidelines for the
Recommendation of Sites for the Nuclear Waste Repositories</em> (10 CFR Part 960), and to
characterize multiple sites for possible development of a geologic repository. The Department
selected nine sites to study as candidates for the first repository. In May 1986, the Secretary
nominated five sites as suitable for the first repository, and recommended three of the sites to the
President for approval for site characterization. The President approved three sites: Yucca
Mountain, Nevada; Deaf Smith County, Texas; and the Hanford Site, Washington. The
Department also began the process of identifying sites for a second repository.
<p>
<strong>Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act of 1987</strong><br>

Motivated in part by concern about program costs, Congress reassessed the need to characterize
three potential repository sites. Through passage of the Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act
of 1987, Congress redirected the Department to focus its site characterization activities only at
Yucca Mountain, Nevada, and report on the need for a second repository on or after January 1,
2007 but no later than January 1, 2010. 
<p>
The Department's proposal to locate a monitored retrievable storage facility at a site at Clinch
River in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, with two alternative sites in Tennessee, was nullified in the
Amendments Act. Congress directed that the need for a monitored retrievable storage facility be
examined by a commission before the Department could proceed and restricted the Department's
ability to site and develop such a facility by prohibiting:
<p>
<ul>
<li>selection of  a monitored retrievable storage facility site until the Secretary of Energy
recommends for Presidential approval a site for development as a repository;
<li>selection of a site within the State of Nevada; and
<li>commencing facility construction until the Nuclear Regulatory Commission issues a
license for the construction of a repository.
</ul>
<p>
The Amendments Act established the Office of the Nuclear Waste Negotiator to seek a volunteer
host site for a respository or monitored retrievable storage facility and also expanded external
oversight of the Department of Energy by establishing the Nuclear Waste Technical Review
Board, authorizing on-site oversight representatives of host jurisdictions, and providing for
increased local government participation.
<p>
Finally, the Amendments Act required that packages for transport be certified by the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission, and that the Department provide technical assistance and funds to
States to train transportation public safety officials.
<p>
<strong>External Oversight and Regulation</strong><br>

Recognizing the far-reaching implications of national radioactive waste management policy,
Congress mandated that oversight and regulation of the Department's civilian radioactive waste
management activities be provided by a number of external organizations. 
<p>
The Nuclear Regulatory Commission was made responsible for overseeing the safety of the
Civilian Radioactive Waste Management System through its process of licensing waste
management facilities and certifying other system components, such as waste containers. The
Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board was directed to evaluate the technical and scientific
validity of program activities. The Environmental Protection Agency was charged with
promulgating generally applicable standards for protection of the general environment from
off-site releases from radioactive material in repositories.
<p>
Additionally, the National Academy of Sciences has provided analysis and recommendations
regarding waste management system issues at various times, sometimes at specific Congressional
direction. For example, the Energy Policy Act of 1992 directed the Environmental Protection
Agency to contract with the Academy for a study to provide recommendations on standards for
protection of the public from the radioactive waste that might be disposed of in a geologic
repository at the Yucca Mountain site. A special Academy committee completed its report, and
the Environmental Protection Agency is currently developing revised regulations in light of  the
committee's recommendations.
<p>
The Nuclear Waste Policy Act also gave specific rights to the State of Nevada and affected units
of local government to oversee the development of the system. Since its inception, the Program
has also solicited external expertise and opinion through its own initiatives, and has sought the
involvement of a broad range of stakeholders, including State and local officials, nuclear utilities
and their regulators, environmental groups, labor unions, and the general public to contribute to
its decision-making process. 
<p>
<strong>Civilian Radioactive Waste Management System</strong><br>

As directed by the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, as amended, the Department of Energy's Civilian
Radioactive Waste Management Program initiated the development of  a waste management
system consisting of three components: a geologic repository for permanent disposal of spent
nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste; a monitored retrievable storage facility for
temporary waste storage (if Congress approves the Department's proposal for the construction of
such a facility or facilities); and a system for transporting the waste from commercial reactor sites
to the temporary and permanent facilities. <a href="./fig12.gif"><em>Figure 12</em></a> on the following page illustrates the waste
management system as contemplated in the Act. 
<p>

		          As Originally Envisioned<br></strong>

</pre><p>
<strong>Geologic Repository</strong><br>

The strategic endpoint of the Civilian Radioactive Waste Management System is the
emplacement of spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste in special packages in a deep
geologic repository to isolate the waste for at least tens of thousands of years. The waste isolation
performance of the repository will rely on multiple barriers, both natural and engineered. The
natural barrier will be the rock formations of the repository site. The principal engineered barrier
will be the waste package, which consists of the waste form, a disposal container, and any
supplemental barriers such as backfill surrounding the waste package. Waste emplacement
activities at the repository will incorporate multiple back-up safety systems and equipment to
protect workers and the public.
<p>
<strong>Monitored Retrievable Storage Facility</strong><br>

Congress directed that a proposal be developed for the construction of one or more facilities for
the monitored retrievable storage of spent fuel. As originally conceived, a monitored retrievable
storage facility was to be deployed to provide back-up storage only if development of a geologic
repository were significantly delayed. The facility would duplicate the spent fuel receiving and
consolidating functions of the repository, and would be phased out of operation when the
repository was in operation and had significantly reduced the backlog of spent fuel at the
reactors. The facility would include a building with equipment for spent nuclear fuel reception,
inspection, disassembly, and consolidation into storage packages; a large storage yard; and the
necessary support facilities.
<p>
After a subsequent reassessment of the monitored retrievable storage concept, the Department
concluded that the facility should be deployed as an integral part of the waste management
system, with expanded capabilities, rather than serve as a back-up to be constructed only in case
of repository development delays.
 <p>
The Department's current strategy for implementing a near-term interim storage program, if and
when interim storage authorization is enacted, is for a less-complex facility to be developed and
licensed in two phases. The first phase of the facility would be limited to the receipt and storage
of spent nuclear fuel in sealed canisters or casks, and could thus be brought into operation
relatively quickly. The second phase of the facility, which would require more time to develop,
would include the capability to receive uncanistered spent fuel assemblies and transfer them to
sealed canisters for on-site storage. Phased development would facilitate timely implementation
of the interim storage facility.
<p>
<strong>Transportation Sub-system</strong><br>

The Civilian Radioactive Waste Management System also includes the development of  a
transportation sub-system to provide waste acceptance at reactor sites and shipment to an interim
storage facility or directly to a repository. Under previous plans, development of the
transportation sub-system had been paced to support waste receipt at a geologic repository. Those
plans had included development through Federal contracts of special casks for truck, rail, and
barge shipment of waste. 
<p>
Under the sub-system now envisioned, multiple contracts would be awarded to competing
contractors to arrange waste shipments; acquire, maintain, and inspect equipment; plan and
schedule operations; and train personnel. Transportation routes would be identified following the
selection of interim storage and repository sites, and the technical assistance and funds would be
provided to States for training public safety officials of local governments and Indian tribes
through whose jurisdiction waste will be shipped. 
<p>
Shipments will be made by truck, rail, or barge, or a combination of these modes. From an
interim storage facility, the spent nuclear fuel will be transported on dedicated trains to the
repository. In vitrified form, defense-related high-level radioactive waste is planned to be shipped
by rail directly from storage sites to the repository. The planned schedule, activities, and products
have been redirected under the revised Program Plan, as described in<a href="./ch22.htm"> <em>Section 2.2</a> and <a href="./appc.htm">Appendix
C.</a></em>
<hr><hr>
<h3><em>Footnotes:</em></h3>
<em><strong>[1]</strong> In May 1995, the Department published a finding that it has no legal obligation under the Act
or the Standard Contract to begin disposal of spent nuclear fuel by January 31, 1998 in the
absence of a repository or interim storage facility constructed under the Nuclear Waste Policy
Act, as amended.
