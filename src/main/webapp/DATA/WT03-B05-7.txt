CAMEROON-ENVIRONMENT:  FACING UP TO THE EUCALYPTUS MENACE

By Tansa Musa
   NKAMBE, Cameroon, Dec. 31 (IPS) -- The view from the third floor
of the Central Hotel in this small town tucked away in Cameroon's
North West Province is dominated by dense forests occasionally
broken by rooftops.
   It looks good, especially in a country which has been losing its
tree cover at an annual rate of about 0.6 per cent.
   But province officials are worried. The trees around Nkambe and
other areas in the northwest are eucalyptus, noted for the large
amounts of water they absorb.
   "We are dealing with an unnoticed crisis," says Raphael Kongor,
an environmental officer in Nkambe. "People have been growing
eucalyptus without regard for their water and food needs. Today we
are having unusually harsh dry seasons because the eucalyptus trees
are draining our waterways."
   Area residents confirm that water is becoming increasingly
scarce here. "Our streams are now dry most of the year and our
women and children have to travel long distances in search of
water," says Chona Patrick, a farmer in Nkambe. "And they also have
to go far, sometimes 15 to 20 kilometers away, to find fertile
farmland."
   Eucalyptus was first introduced in the hilly grasslands of the
North West Province by colonial administrators to meet their wood
and fuel needs and protect their homes from windstorms during the
rainy season. Local villagers followed suit.
   Since independence, Cameroon's government has encouraged the
regulated growth of eucalyptus, according to Nelson Chomba, a
forestry technician with the National Office for the Development
of Forests.
   "We encourage the planting of eucalyptus on barren, marginal
land, usually hilltops, far away from water catchment areas and the
sources of streams," Chomba told IPS. "We recommend that farmers
plant the trees at least 50 to 100 meters away from such areas."
   But it has proved hard to limit the planting of eucalyptus.
   Unlike coffee, the main cash crop in the area, growing
eucalyptus requires little labor and few supplies. "Plant it even
on rocky soil and it grows," says Kongor. "All you need to do is
clear a tract around the plantation to protect it from dry-season
brush fires."
   Moreover, it has a variety of uses. The branches make good
fuelwood. Mix the dried leaves with lime juice and you have a cheap
cough mixture, while the trees themselves act as windbreaks and can
also be used to mark the boundaries of farms.
   More importantly, however, there is money in eucalyptus. Its
wood can be sold and, with the prices of traditional cash crops
like coffee and cocoa fluctuating on the world market, there is
hardly a family in the districts of Donga-Mantung division, which
includes Nkambe and neighboring Bui, that does not have a
eucalyptus plantation or at least a few trees.
   It has also spread southwards to the Western province and is
gaining ground in the drier northern provinces of Adamawa and the
north, especially since there is quick cash to be made by selling
eucalyptus poles to the national electricity corporation, SONEL,
and the local telephone utility.
   "Every year I make about 100,000 CFA francs (about $220) from
selling poles to SONEL alone,"says Chona. "I've been producing
coffee for a long time but I don't get so much money from that."
   Patrick Bui, a farmer in Bui district, vows that nothing will
stop him from growing eucalyptus. "Look," he says, pointing to
bundles of firewood stacked along the main highway. "Do you know
how much I make every day from these?"
   "This gives me about 1,500 to 2,000 CFA francs (between $3.30
and $4.40) every day, which I use to pay the fees for my three
children in secondary school, buy (cooking) oil, soap and other
things for my family and to contribute to my 'njangui' (informal
savings and loan cooperative)."
   But the cost to the environment is high, says Kongor, who
explains that the eucalyptus has roots that go deep into the soil
to find water, which is why it should be grown on dry marginal
land.
   "Though the plant can help raise the water level, its
destructive nature cannot be overlooked," he adds. "It drains the
soil of valuable nutrients and water that other plants and crops
need to grow."
   However, "It would be useless to call on farmers not to plant
eucalyptus trees, considering the importance of such a plant
species in non-forest areas," says Kongor.
   "Our only weapon is to educate the farmers about proper forestry
techniques and the need to diversify economic activity to other
productive areas, like bee-farming."

LATIN AMERICA-HUMAN RIGHTS:  STILL PENDING AFTER ALL THESE YEARS

By Daniel Gatti
   MONTEVIDEO, Dec. 31 (IPS) -- "Your children are here, what pride
you must feel," exclaimed Hebe de Bonafini, leader of the
Argentinean Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo, speaking in the name of
the thousands who disappeared during the military dictatorship of
1976-83.
   For the first time in years, the annual Resistance March
organized by the group on Dec. 7 filled the central Plaza de Mayo
to capacity.
   "Three generations marched together," read the headline in
Argentinean daily Pagina 12 the following day, as grandmothers,
mothers and the children of the disappeared marched together.
   "We children are here," declared a young member of Children for
Identity and Justice against Oblivion and Silence (HIJOS).
   "For years they wanted us to be nobody's children. Today we are
fighters. Our parents march with us," he added.
   "Two decades later, the wound opened by the military
dictatorship and its atrocities is still open, and the question has
not been resolved," said one protester.
   Official and unofficial estimates state that between nine and
thirty thousand people disappeared under the military dictatorship
that began with Lt. Gen. Jorge Rafael Videla.
   Human rights issues were front and center in Argentina in 1995,
with one leading army officer, Martin Balza, admitting his guilt
and distancing himself from the abuses of the military regime.
Balza's gesture was preceded by confessions from several members
of army personnel involved in the violations, and was followed by
more gentle "mea culpas" from the navy and air force leaders.
   The human rights issue also resurfaced in Chile, Brazil,
Uruguay, Central America and Colombia.
   In Chile, the ghost of the dictatorship reared its ugly head
once more as the issue of army power returned to the fore.
   The public also followed the progress of the case of Gen. Manuel
Contreras and a parliamentary proposal to suspend the prosecution
of 600 military officers accused of assassinations, abductions and
torture during the 1973 to 1990 period.
   In May, General Contreras and Brigadier Pedro Espinosa were
found guilty of masterminding the murder of former Chilean foreign
minister Orlando Letelier in Washington, in 1976.
   This verdict led Chilean human rights organizations to believe
the end of military impunity might be in sight, but when it took
three months to get Contreras into prison it became clear that the
armed forces still held great sway.
   Former dictator Augusto Pinochet is currently Chilean military
Chief of Staff.
   Suspicions were further confirmed when a parliamentary proposal
suggested putting a "full stop" to the prosecution of army
personnel accused of human rights offenses, and the Senate voted
earlier this month not to release information on the disappearances
and killings.
   Brazil also saw a resurfacing of human rights cases from the
sixties and seventies, and the current sitaton there earned the
nation the title "the nation of impunity."
   Around mid-year, Fernando Cardoso's government approved
compensation payments to the families of the dozens of people who
disappeared under the dictatorship of 1964-85. Most of these cases
were never investigated and no one was ever punished.
   Meanwhile, the group Human Rights Watch criticized the nation,
saying that the climate of impunity was encouraging the Military
Police and other security forces to commit "systematic breaches of
human rights."
   The group condemned the possible executions of dozens of common
criminals, militant rural workers and street children, especially
in cities like Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo, and areas with land
use and ownership disputes.
   "This country has a culture of impunity which it has dragged
along for decades, which feeds on the worsening social inequalities
which lead the most powerful to use soldiers and the police against
the 'dangerous classes'," said one member of the Landless Movement.
   This same "culture" is alive and well in Central America, where
the dictatorships are disappearing within a generalized situation
of civil violence. A report from the Committee for the Defense of
Human Rights in Central America (CODEHUCA) condemned the resurgence
of death squads who target either their political opponents or
"common criminals."
   The situation which permits the incalculable number of
extra-judicial executions and the impunity of the murderers wears
away at the official legal system and corrupts the political
structure the report said.
   It said that the increasing regional crime rate feeds on
poverty, unemployment, and the fact that thousands of civilians
still possess their weapons, often from when they fought in the
civil wars.
   CODEHUCA calculated that there were around two million firearms
loose in Honduras, 300,000 in El Salvador and 250,000 in Guatemala,
concluding that the isthmus nations "are sitting on a social time
bomb without knowing when or how it's going to explode."

MOZAMBIQUE-ECONOMY:  POLITICIANS FIRE AWAY AT BRETTON WOODS

By Gustavo Mavie
   MAPUTO, Dec. 31 (IPS) -- Mozambique's politicians, divided for
decades by ideological differences and war, have now united against
economic policies they blame for increasing poverty in one of the
world's poorest nations.
   "The (International Monetary Fund) IMF and the World Bank are
not interested in the economic development of Mozambique," charges
Antonio Palange of the opposition Democratic Union (UD), one of
three parties that won parliamentary seats in the country's first
ever multiparty elections, held in October 1994.
   Palange recently joined other parliamentarians from the UD, the
Mozambique National Resistance (RENAMO, the largest opposition
group), and the ruling Front for the Liberation of Mozambique
(FRELIMO) in lashing out at the government's "marriage" to the
Bretton Wood institutions "at the expense of the Mozambican
people."
   This development is astonishing since Renamo has traditionally
been considered an ally of the West and FRELIMO was once avowedly
Marxist.
   Hoping to keep afloat an economy battered by prolonged civil war
and a socialist experiment that kicked off with the end of
Portuguese rule in 1975, FRELIMO opted for a market economy in 1987
at the behest of the international finance houses.
   But instead of recovery and prosperity, the structural
adjustment program (SAP) has brought most Mozambicans only more
misery, critics note. Even the government is uneasy about some
recommendations of the Bretton Woods pair, such as selling state
companies to curb government spending.
   Most of the 500 parastatals sold so far have passed into foreign
hands as few locals have the capital to purchase them, a fact which
has convinced many here that privatization threatens national
sovereignty.
   The IMF and World Bank are urging a reluctant government to sell
off the national carrier, LAM, the water and electricity companies,
the national railways and ports, customs and the post and
telecommunications' utility.
   But the government considers these enterprises of strategic
importance and prefers to turn them into financially autonomous
public companies with private management.
   In the meantime, the tariffs these utilities charge have soared,
especially for energy. In state housing projects, for example,
monthly electricity bills are more than 100 times as high as
rentals.
   Many here wonder exactly whom the policies touted by the Bretton
Woods institutions are aimed at helping, and not just because of
their social cost.
   When Trade and Industry Minister Oldeniro Baloi announced that
the World Bank had threatened to cut off funding unless Mozambique
exported its cashew nuts unprocessed, this was perceived here as
a bid to smash the many well-equipped factories that process the
nuts, Mozambique's second largest export after prawns.
   "There's no doubt that it's the wrong strategy to
de-industrialize Mozambique in exchange for a fistful of dollars,"
says Teodata Hunguana, a FRELIMO deputy who has held various
ministerial posts. He believes selling its few products cheaply is
a luxury Mozambique can ill afford.
   The IMF is "the new ministry of colonies," quipped fellow
FRELIMO deputy Sergio Vieira, also a former cabinet minister. "Let
the IMF keep its money. We should develop and modernize our
agriculture and protect our industry."
   Fruits of the program remain so elusive that it has been
extended five years beyond its original duration of three years,
leaving most people here with their "belts tightened right to the
bone," notes Carlos Cardoso, the outspoken editor of Mediafax, an
independent daily.
   Perhaps the bitterest pill for the 16 million inhabitants of
this southern African state is the dramatic fall in their money's
buying power, while prices and inflation gallop out of control.
   In the last eight years, the value of the national currency, the
metical, has plunged dramatically. In 1987, one U.S. dollar was
equivalent to 40 meticais at the official exchange rate and forty
times more on the black market. Today it is worth 10,826 meticais
officially and 11,500 on the black market.
   Unemployment is rife but those with jobs are scarcely better off
than the jobless. Many earn little more than the $20 monthly
minimum wage, which is barely more than half the $34 needed to buy
a 50 kilogram bag of rice, a staple here.
   At least 70 per cent of Mozambicans live below the poverty line,
yet for years the government kept the minimum wage at 78,000
meticais (seven U.S. dollars) in keeping with a wage freeze
recommended by the Bretton Woods institutions. It only raised it
three months ago after trade unions threatened a general strike.
   The pay hike infuriated IMF representative Sergio Leite who
slammed it as "completely unrealistic" and "inopportune." Leite
attacked waste by the government and warned at a press conference
that "we are going to order more cuts in government expenditure."
   Stung by what they deemed Leite's arrogance and disrespect for
their country's sovereignty, local newspapers said he had insulted
Mozambique's workers and wondered how much he earned at the IMF.
   Palange slammed "constant interference in Mozambique's economic
development by the World Bank" and urged the government to end its
"dependence on the IMF" as other African states have done after
realizing that its programs "do more harm than good to their
economies and social fabric."
   Later, another IMF official said it was up to individual
governments to fix minimum wages, but few here were placated.
   While critics call for a more independent stance by the
government, Planning and Finance Minister Tomas Salomao said
recently in parliament that it would be suicidal for Mozambique to
cut ties with its backers. The Paris Club injected $1 billion into
the country in 1995 and foreign aid accounts or around half of the
1996 budget, which totals slightly more than $605 million.
   Of the 1996 budget, $316 million will go towards rehabilitating
infrastructure destroyed during the civil war (1975-1992).
Recurrent costs should swallow up $287 million.
   The government's dependence on aid could be reduced if it
tightened up on illegal exports, which rob the treasury of millions
of dollars and in which many state officials are allegedly
involved.
   Official statistics show that between January and September,
$600 million was spent on imports and only $126 million worth of
goods were exported. But according to investigations by Mediafax,
illegal exports topped $800 million, most of which was banked
abroad.
   Salomao maintains that IMF's programs appear to be fruitless
only because "they are difficult to put into practice," but critics
insist that government members have been adhering to these programs
rather than slash their own salaries and other benefits derived
from co-operation with the finance houses.
   Neither the IMF's threats nor public disgruntlement have stemmed
the largely unchecked corruption and opulent lifestyles of those
in power and their associates. Almost all present and former
members of government hold shares in privatized companies and new
ones that are being set up. Many have built luxury houses in posh
city neighborhoods in addition to country houses to which they
retreat on weekends and holidays.
   Pajeros, Mercedes Benz, BMWs and other luxury vehicles litter
the streets, and yet "machibombas," minibuses on which the public
relies for transport, are scarce.
   Prime Minister Pascoal Mocumbi says an independent authority is
to be set up to combat corruption, but most people here feel this
is empty talk.

PALESTINE-HUMAN RIGHTS:  EDITOR JAILED FOR DEFYING ARAFAT'S WISH

By Deborah Horan
   JERUSALEM, Dec. 31 (IPS) -- The release of a Palestinian
newspaper editor detained for six days after failing to prominently
display a flattering article about Yasser Arafat has not eased
fears of a further clampdown on freedom of speech in liberated
Palestine.
   Maher al-Alameh, night editor of the Jerusalem-based Arabic
daily al-Quds, was freed yesterday after a week under interrogation
in the Palestinian self-rule enclave of Jericho. He had been
detained Dec. 25 by the Palestinian Preventive Security (PPS).
   His crime was failing to give enough prominence to flattering
comments about Arafat made by the Greek Orthodox Patriarch of
Jerusalem. The Patriarch, greeting Arafat in Bethlehem on Christmas
Eve, had compared him to the revered second Caliph of Islam, Omar
bin el-Khatab, who captured Jerusalem in AD 638.
   All Palestinian newspapers received orders from Arafat's advisor
Nabil Abu Rudeineh to emphasize the Patriarch's comments on their
front page. When al-Alameh put it on page 8 instead he was summoned
to Jericho and detained.
   After a week in detention, during which time al-Alameh, 50, says
he was treated well, he was taken to Ramallah to meet Arafat
yesterday morning. "He (Arafat) asked me why I did not put the news
(on page one) concerning the Patriarch and the description of
Arafat as Caliph Omar," al-Alameh told IPS.
   Al-Alameh said he told Arafat that the reason was purely
practical. Eight per cent of the front page was election
advertising and the rest -- "four columns and a color picture" --
was all about Arafat and the full text of his speech in Bethlehem.
   "I didn't mean to hurt his feelings. It was only because I
didn't have space," he said. "We can't publish all the news of
Arafat on the front page. He (Arafat) was very polite. He said 'I'm
sorry' and kissed my head. He said, 'I don't like to arrest any of
my brothers.'"
   But the detention was seen as another serious blow to press
freedom under Arafat. Members of the Paris-based media rights NGO
Reporters Without Borders tried to visit al-Alameh in Jericho but
were refused entry on the orders of PPS head Jibril Rajoub.
   "I don't think it is a crime. It is a very, very silly pretext
to arrest a person and the timing is very, very bad," said al-
Alameh. "It comes on the eve of elections and of our claim we are
building a democratic entity."
   "They must respect human rights," said Bassem Eid, the
Palestinian representative of Reporters Without Borders. "The PPS
cannot go around kidnapping people."
   "If you don't respect the freedom of the press," added
al-Alameh, "how can you build a democracy?" Arafat officials
declined to comment; Rajoub would merely confirm to IPS that
al-Alameh had been released.
   Arafat has been making an effort to improve his troubled
relations with the Palestinian Christian community and to reassure
wary Christians that they are welcome to stay under the newly
emerging Palestinian government in the West Bank and Gaza.
   To further his initiative, Arafat asked all Arabic newspapers
in Palestine to prominently display the comments of the Patriarch
as evidence of the sympathy and support he was getting from
Christian leaders.
   Al-Quds, published in east Jerusalem, is the largest Arabic
daily and has a circulation of 25,000. Its circulation in the West
Bank has been stopped several times in the past after it published
articles critical of the Palestinian Authority's activities.
   In August 1994, Arafat ordered the daily an-Nahar closed after
it ran a story entitled "I Am A Jordanian From Hebron" at a time
when the Authority was experiencing strained relations with the
Hashemite Kingdom over the role each will play in Jerusalem.
   Last May, Arafat closed down the opposition Hamas newspaper
al-Watan for three months and jailed its editor for two years for
printing material that "harmed national unity." A recent press law
enacted by Arafat makes it a crime to print anything determined to
be damaging to "the national cause."
   "The Palestinian Authority maintains that if you are criticizing
them, you are harming 'national unity,'" said Eid, who is opposed
to the press law. "All we can hope for is that public opinion will
force them to change the policies."
   "He (Arafat) doesn't have the right (to arrest members of the
press)," said al-Alameh, "but...we are a non-democratic system so
he has the ability to order the newspapers to print whatever he
wants them to because they are afraid of action from Arafat. All
of them are in a cycle of fear."
   On several occasions, newspapers have been prevented from
distributing in Gaza after printing articles perceived as
unfavorable to Arafat or the Palestinian Authority. Security men
have also visited an-Nahar and allegedly threatened staff.
   The Palestinian Authority has also been criticized by human
rights organizations for arresting prominent figures in Gaza for
speaking out against government measures that have curbed speech.
   Nine months ago, prominent Palestinian human rights activist
Raji Sourani was arrested for producing a document that criticized
the government's handling of human rights issues.
   Earlier this month, Gaza psychiatrist and leading local activist
Eyad Sarraj was arrested in connection with criticisms of the
Authority's human rights policies made in an address to an
international seminar on journalists and the peace process
organized by Inter Press Service under the European Union's
PeaceMedia program. The seminar had also been addressed by senior
Palestinian Authority officials and the editor of al-Watan.
   Like al-Alameh, Sarraj was not formally arrested but was
"invited" to go for "discussions" with security officials. The
discussions turned into de facto detention.
   "I was treated very well. It was not under the conditions of a
prison," said al-Alameh, who was worried enough about the summons
from Rajoub to take a foreign journalist with him when he went.
   "I was treated respectfully, kindly -- maybe because they knew
I am famous and the international media covered my story. I think
this had pressure on them." But he was sure that had he refused the
summons he would have been forcibly taken. "I was threatened that
if I didn't go on my own they would kidnap me and put me in a car
or they would tear me to pieces."
   The article was politically sensitive for Arafat as it came on
the heels of a Catholic conference that focused on the state of
Christians in the Holy Land and amid accusations from several
Christian groups that their communities are afraid to stay in the
West Bank once it comes completely under Palestinian self-rule.
   To counter these claims, which the Palestinian Authority
dismisses as propaganda propagated by pro-Israeli or pro-Zionist
Christian groups, Arafat has been sprinkling his speeches with
comments aimed at making the Christian community feel more at ease.
   He attended the Christian mass at the Church of the Nativity in
Bethlehem, where Christians believe Jesus Christ was born, and has
set a quota for Christian candidates running for seats in the
Palestinian Council (parliament), to ensure they are represented.
   Arafat's wife, Suha, a Greek Orthodox Palestinian Christian who
converted to Islam to marry her husband in 1990, has also been
making an effort to quell Christians' perceived fears.
   She visited the Church of the Nativity two days before Christmas
and had their five-month-old baby girl blessed. Christians, who
make up about three per cent of the population of the West Bank,
steadily left during the seven-year uprising against Israeli rule
in search of better living conditions -- as did many Muslims.
   But since the Oslo accord establishing Palestinian self-rule was
signed two years ago, some 40 prominent Bethlehem Christian
families have chosen to leave, increasing the feeling that they do
not feel welcome under the Palestinian Authority.
   Many Christians who left earlier, however, have said they plan
to return once the Palestinian enclaves attain full independence
from Israel.
   For Palestinians the most acute problem is the forthcoming
elections on Jan. 20. The view here is that even if serious
campaigns are mounted against Arafat's candidacy, Arafat's control
of the media will deny them equal space.
   In the longer term the media controls are undermining the
democratic system here, says al-Alameh.
   "We haven't freedom of the press. We do not have the press which
forced (President Richard) Nixon to resign. We do not have the
press which forced (then Israeli prime minister Yitzhak) Rabin to
resign." Rabin resigned after journalists uncovered the fact that
his wife had a then illegal foreign bank account.
   "We haven't the press to make the Authority afraid of it. We
have an Authority that makes the press afraid. It's a disaster.
It's a catastrophe."

CHILE:  GDP GROWTH BEATS INFLATION FOR THE FIRST TIME

By Gustavo Gonzalez
   SANTIAGO, Dec. 31 (IPS) -- Among Chile's economic achievements
in 1995, a rate of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth that
exceeded the rate of inflation is a particular source of pride for
Treasury Minister Eduardo Aninat.
   The Chilean GDP grew 8.2 per cent -- 8.3 per cent over the 1994
level to $62 billion, while the consumer price index (CPI) grew by
an estimated 8.1 per cent or a maximum of 8.2 per cent.
   This is the first time since Chilean statistical records have
been kept that GDP grew as much or more than the CPI under
conditions of economic expansion and low inflation.
   The 1995 growth in production "means that production has almost
doubled over the past 10 years," a satisfied Aninat told
journalists as he presented economic data for the year on Dec. 28.
   "Chile is included among the ten emerging economies with the
best records in the world this year," the minister added, and
pointed out that investment amounted to 26 per cent of GDP.
   Aninat's briefing ratified the findings of an Economic
Commission for Latin America (ECLA) report released last week that
listed Chile as the region's best growth performer in 1995.
   ECLA and other international organizations attribute the Chilean
success to a combination of fiscal discipline, incentives for
domestic saving and foreign investment, and protection against
short-term capital flows.
   The Chilean stock market experienced only "a slight dizziness"
in the first trimester of 1995 as a result of the so-called
"tequila effect" that originated in Mexico's financial crisis and
hit other countries hard, especially Argentina.
   Chilean foreign investment is concentrated in production
activities, mostly in the mining sector, and the country is host
to relatively little of the short-term or "volatile" capital whose
flight precipitated the Mexican and Argentinean crises.
   It is true that Chile's strong economic performance this year
was aided by good international market prices for the country's
principal exports, including copper, fish meal, and cellulose.
   But this doesn't take credit away from Chile because prices rose
this year for almost all major Latin American exports, with the
exception of soybeans and beef.
   Although it confronts the same problems of inequality and
inequity as does the rest of the region, Chile can also claim a
real increase in GDP per capita, which Aninat says is between five
and six per cent.
   ECLA reports that Chilean GDP per capita grew 2.4 per cent in
1994 and rose to 6.4 per cent this year, while the rest of Latin
America and the Caribbean suffered a decline in per capita GDP of
1.1 per cent.
   While the regional unemployment rate rose from 6.4 per cent last
year to 7.4 per cent in 1995, Chile succeeded in reducing its rate
from 6.3 per cent to 5.6 per cent, which still remains high
compared to the 4.1 per cent rate in 1993.
   Real wages -- after factoring in inflation -- either fell or
stagnated in almost all of the countries in the region in 1995 but
they rose by 4 per cent in Chile.
   While offering this successful 1995 accounting, Aninat promised
the poorest Chileans that "the economic model will continue
incorporating a high level of equality and equity."
   At the other extreme, the minister displayed the caution typical
of a government reluctant to engage in confrontations with business
by inviting the high-income sectors "to continue contributing to
the country's economic efforts."
   Is Chile's economic success the product of a continuation of
neo-liberal policies inherited from General August Pinochet's
dictatorship (1973-90) or is it the fruit of combining a market
model with social redistribution policies?
   This question continues to be debated, especially by the
Pinochet supporters on the right wing, who insist that the present
government is merely profiting from the military regime's "sowing"
and that business enterprise is to be credited for the economic
growth.
   To measure the reestablished democracy's economic performance,
Aninat presented comparative statistics for the 1991-95 period
derived from ECLA and the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
   Chile's average annual GDP growth rate over the period is 7.4
per cent, the highest in Latin America and far above the comparable
figure for the region (2.8 per cent), all developing countries (5.8
per cent) and the rest of the world (2.6 per cent).
   Chile's average annual inflation rate over the period was 12.1
per cent compared to 284.4 per cent for Latin America and 35.4 per
cent for all of the developing world.
   Finally, real wages grew 4.3 per cent in Chile during the five-
year period, while they increased by an average of only 1.9 per
cent in Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Mexico and Peru.

MALAYSIA-LABOR:  MIGRANT WORKERS EXPLOITED

By Kalinga Seneviratne
   KUALA LUMPUR, Jan. 1 (IPS) -- Malaysia's rapid economic growth
has made it a magnet for migrant workers but exploitation by
employers has dashed many of their hopes of earning a decent
living.
   Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad plans to make Malaysia a fully
developed nation by 2020, and economic expansion has led to a
serious labor shortage which as prompted the country to open its
doors to workers fleeing poverty and unemployment in other parts
of Asia.
   There are now an estimated two million guest workers in this
nation of 19.6 million people. Half of these migrants hold legal
work permits while the rest entered illegally, mainly through
Thailand and Indonesia.
   Indonesians initially dominated the market with cheap labor but
Bangladeshis are now a force to be reckoned with. There are now at
least 200,000 Bangladeshi workers in the country -- more than half
of them working in plantations and factories.
   Malaysia has reached an agreement with Bangladesh to recruit
50,000 skilled and semi-skilled workers -- including nurses and
doctors -- every year.
   Increasing numbers of middle-class Malaysians are employing
domestic helpers mainly from the Philippines, Sri Lanka and
Bangladesh. Deputy Home Minister Ong Ka Ting has admitted the
immigration department has a backlog of at least 10,000
applications for work permits for foreign maids.
   Unscrupulous employers, however, are exploiting the desperation
of many of the Asian workers fleeing from poverty at home.
Bangladeshis, who come from one of the world's poorest countries
with a per capita income of $180 a year, are the most vulnerable.
   "Recruiting agencies promise them $300 a month if they come to
Malaysia," says welfare worker S. Sinnappan. He says that many
young university graduates, lured by promotional photos and videos,
end up getting only half this amount.
   Most of the Bangladeshi plantation workers with whom Sinnappan
works had been promised jobs as technicians or engineers. They had
never worked in plantations and were not used to the heavy work in
the palm-oil plantations.
   "They paid the agencies as much as 6,000 ringgit (about $2,400)
to come here. Many raised the money by mortgaging their land or
house," he adds.
   G. Rajasekaran, secretary-general of the Malaysian Trade Union
Congress, says they do not object to migrant labor, provided the
government makes sure there are still jobs left for Malaysians.
   The government has drawn up regulations, but enforcement is very
weak, he says. "It has become so chaotic," he observed, "because
recruitment is done through recruiting agents."
   Rajasekaran says such agencies have mushroomed in recent years
because it is an easy way to make big money without any capital
outlay. "You just bring a person here, collect money from the
person who wants to work, and collect money from the company that
wants to employ him."
   He says exploitation happens at both ends and has led to
corruption involving, for example, the forging of work permits and
other documents. He favors government-to-government deals but is
worried that an unregulated labor influx will undermine working
conditions.
   "Despite impressive economic growth rates in the last five
years, wage levels and living standards of Malaysian workers --
especially industrial workers -- have not gone up as much as they
should have," he says, and the flood of foreign workers has
affected the bargaining power of trade unions.
   "If the government didn't allow foreign workers to come in, even
without collective bargaining, wage rates would have gone up
because of supply and demand ," argues Rajasekaran.
   He says that because of the comparatively low wage rates in
Malaysia, as many as 60,000 Malaysians cross the border each day
to work in Singapore, where a factory worker gets about $380 per
month compared with $160 a month for the same job at home.
   A task force on foreign labor has recommended a monthly wage of
$140 but some firms pay only $110. Locals refuse to work for such
wages, and companies use this as an excuse to turn to foreign
workers. The government this month warned it would no longer
tolerate such exploitation.
   Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, who heads the cabinet's
Committee on Foreign Workers, is concerned about the impact of
foreign workers on employment opportunities for Malaysians.
   "We will not accept foreign workers at the expense of
Malaysians, especially the younger generation, who are entering the
employment market. We want to ensure that priority is given to
Malaysians for all employment opportunities," he said.
   In his 1996 budget Anwar, who is also Minister of Finance,
increased the levy on foreign workers by 100 per cent. He also
announced in August that foreign job seekers can now be recruited
only as domestic helpers or shop assistants.
   P. Arunasalam, secretary-general of the Electrical Industry
Workers Union, urged the government to gradually phase out its
labor-intensive industries and instead train Malaysians to overcome
the shortage of skilled labor suited for high-technology
industries.
   He warns an increase in foreign labor will put more demands on
the government schooling system to take care of the workers'
children. He says many foreign workers have already forced small
traders in Malaysia to give up their trade at night markets.
   "Huge sums of money remitted by the foreign workers to their
respective countries of origin are a big drain on our country's
economy," says Arunasalam. "In 1994 alone, $960 million was sent
out of the country by one million workers."
   Rajasekaram argues that because of the low wage rates cushioned
by foreign labor, many Malaysian women are not encouraged to join
the workforce. He cites an official report last year saying
Malaysia would have 729,000 more workers if more women were
encouraged to work.
   Many Malaysians are now questioning the pace of development in
their country, while others think the problems of illegal migration
and exploitation of foreign labor should be addressed first.

POPULATION:  MEXICAN EMIGRATION UNAFFECTED BY NAFTA

   MEXICO CITY, Jan. 1 (IPS) -- The North American Free Trade
Agreement (NAFTA), now two-years-old, has not had the expected
spectacular effect on the flow of migrants between Mexico and the
United States, according to demographic experts.
   Manuel Alva Hernandez, a researcher with the Colegio de Mexico,
told IPS that "population movements generally follow very complex
and slowly evolving trends, so that -- except in wartime -- they
don't happen suddenly."
   He noted that NAFTA -- the trading block linking Canada, the
United States and Mexico inaugurated on Jan. 1, 1994 -- has 374
million inhabitants and an annual product of $7 trillion but "only
ratified an existing process of integration."
   Alva Hernandez explained that there already had been a
privatizing trend in Mexico, along with significant productive and
speculative capital investment from the United States and other
countries, and that neither phenomenon had increased dramatically
in the two years the treaty has been in effect.
   Nor is there evidence, despite the economic crisis that has
battered Mexico since December 1994, of a major increase in Mexican
migration to the United States as it is often stimulated by family
or friendship ties along with work incentives, Alva Hernandez
added.
   International migration into Mexico did not play a major role
in the country's demographics during the first half of this
century, nor did large numbers of Mexicans emigrate, although there
was a constant outflow, mostly to the U.S.
   But a large increase in Mexican migration to the U.S. has been
evident in recent decades, especially the last 20 years, although
there has been no significant rise in migration into Mexico.
   Hence, Mexico shows a negative migratory balance sheet with the
outside world and has lost 290,000 inhabitants annually in recent
years. This has reduced its internal population growth rate by an
estimated 0.32 per cent.
   Significant migration to the U.S. began in the middle of the
nineteenth century after the U.S. occupied more than half of what
was then Mexico and rose during the revolutionary period (1910-
1919).
   During these years, about 200,000 Mexicans moved to the border
states of Texas, Arizona and California to work in agriculture, on
railroad lines and, to a lesser extent, in industry.
   The first world war (1914-1918) and the international economic
crisis that broke out in 1929 and lasted through the following
decade diminished the migratory flow, which rose again during the
second world war (1939-1945), when labor was needed to replace
workers enlisted in military service.
   The documented and undocumented migration of Mexicans living in
the United States in 1950, 1960, and 1970 was 630,000, 834,000 and
1,399,000, respectively.
   Beginning in the 1970's, this number rose rapidly. In 1980, it
was over 2,500,00 and it reached 4,500,000 in 1990, a number
equivalent to slightly more than 5.4 per cent of Mexico's census
population that year.
   During this entire period, the relative proportion of urban
migrants, non-agricultural workers and women within the total
population of migrants increased.
   This has changed the old U.S. stereotype of the Mexican migrant
as a poorly educated rural laborer seeking seasonal or temporary
work.
   A major contributor to this demographic change was the Mexican
economic crisis that began in 1980 and has become chronic since
then, with only a partial interruption during the first half of the
present decade.
   A change in the U.S. economy that affected the magnitude and
composition of demand for migratory labor also had an effect.
   Yet another influence was the 1986 reform of U.S. immigration
law, which encouraged some migrants to seek U.S. residence and
provided for the employment of migrants in some production
activities.
   According to some Mexican analysts, including noted
anthropologist Soledad Gonzalez Montes, "the development of
functional social networks that link places of origin with
destinations" played a special role in the new migration.
   This analysis suggests that once the Mexican population in the
United States reached a certain threshold, growing social networks
lowered the costs and risks associated with international migration
and increased the probability that potential migrants would make
the move.
   All of these factors gave the migratory movement a powerful push
even as regional economic development created new departure points
throughout Mexico's territory and increased the number of migrating
women and children.
   The number of entire families and those seeking family
reunification also rose among migrants.
   Gonzalez Montes pointed out "a growing concentration (of
migrants) in the states of California and Texas and in the
metropolitan areas of these and other (U.S.) states."
   Statistics show that the length of stay of Mexican migrants in
the United States has grown and that almost two thirds of those
covered by the 1986 legal residency program had been living in that
country for more than a decade.

U.S.-TRADE:  NAFTA ASSAILED ON SECOND ANNIVERSARY

   WASHINGTON, Dec. 31 (IPS) -- U.S. fans of the North American
Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) are not celebrating.
   Two years after the highly-touted accord between the United
States, Canada, and Mexico, NAFTA has become a political liability
and given ammunition to critics of similar free trade agreements.
   Symptomatic was a cartoon appearing in today's New York Times
which depicted two men in a seedy-looking room in an urban
neighborhood. Across the street a decrepit apartment house is being
consumed by flames. One of the men is seated on a sofa reading a
newspaper's help-wanted classified advertisements. The page is
lined with the logos of fast-food joints like McDonalds and
Wendy's.
   His friend, who has just walked in the door with a bottle of
tequila, shouts, "Good news! Tequila is a dollar cheaper." The
caption below reads "NAFTA finally pays off."
   "Our predictions have proved correct; if anything, the situation
has worsened," declared William Bywater, president of the main U.S.
Electronics Workers' Union (IUE) and one of NAFTA's staunchest foes
on the pact's first anniversary.
   "The collapse of the Mexican economy, the increase in drug
traffic, the flood of illegal immigrants, the loss of jobs in the
U.S., and now the most recent specter of unsafe Mexican trucks on
our highways have proved that we were right (in opposing NAFTA),"
he said.
   He was referring to the latest, and biggest, roadblock in the
implementation of NAFTA, the mid-December decision by the
administration of President Bill Clinton to indefinitely delay the
liberalization of trucking rules that would have permitted U.S. and
Mexican truckers to operate more than 30 kilometers beyond each
others' borders.
   The new rules were to have taken effect this month but pressure
from the powerful Teamsters Union apparently persuaded the
administration to place "greater emphasis on safety and security"
for U.S. roadways. The administration has not yet indicated when
those concerns might be cleared up.
   Citing trade experts, the Washington Post said the decision, the
first major failure of NAFTA's implementation, showed "how eager
the administration is to reduce NAFTA's unpleasant political
fallout, even by circumventing rules of an accord President Clinton
championed."
   But it's not only Clinton's political base that is unhappy.
Pulled by television pundit and presidential hopeful Patrick
Buchanan, Republicans, too, have moved against NAFTA.
   Historically one of the most devoted free trade advocates in a
free trade party, Republican presidential front-runner Sen. Robert
Dole came out three months ago against the consideration of any new
trade pacts this year. With that remark, he effectively buried 45
years of staunch Republican support for any measure that would open
up foreign markets to U.S. goods and investment.
   He also buried the hopes of Caribbean Basin nations of achieving
parity with NAFTA benefits and of Chile for becoming the first
non-North American nation to be admitted to NAFTA this year. Given
the sensitivity of the issue in next year's presidential election,
those hopes are probably dead for next year as well.
   NAFTA supporters say all this is unfair. During its first year,
NAFTA had produced unprecedented gains in two-way trade for both
the United States and Mexico which, after all, was the reason for
its approval.
   The problem, they insist, was something completely unrelated to
the trade pact: the melt-down of the peso which began last December
when the incoming administration of Mexican President Ernesto
Zedillo botched a devaluation.
   "Nonsense," say the foes, many of whom had warned that the peso
was kept deliberately overvalued during the NAFTA debate in the
U.S. Congress in late 1993 so as not to give ammunition to critics
who warned that inevitable devaluations would spur the flight of
capital and factories southwards.
   Whatever the relationship between the peso's collapse and NAFTA,
critics are now having a field day pointing to all of the broken
promises made by NAFTA's boosters two years ago.
   Clinton, for example, predicted that NAFTA would create 200,000
U.S. jobs in its first two years. In fact, Gary Hufbauer of the
Institute for International Economics, the economist on whom the
White House relied for Clinton's estimate, now admits that the
United States has probably lost about 225,000 jobs net.
   Indeed, Mexico is expected to end up with a trade surplus with
the United States this year of around $20 billion. U.S. exports to
Mexico have fallen to about their pre-NAFTA levels and, as yet,
show few signs of levelling off.
   Similarly, a new report to be released by the consumer group
Public Citizen and the Mexico City-based Red Mexicana de Accion
Frente al Libre Comercio (RMALC) finds that another major promise
of the NAFTA campaign, that public health and environmental
problems along the U.S.-Mexico border would be improved as a result
of NAFta, have been dashed.
   The 85-page report finds that "NAFTA has intensified severe
problems of water and air polution, hazardous waste dumping and
increased the incidence of certain diseases and birth defects in
the border region," according to Joan Claybrook, Public Citizen's
president.
   In spite of administration predictions that NAFTA-related
investments would disperse industry in Mexico away from the border
to other regions, the maquiladoras which dominate border
enterprises have been one of the few sectors to experience a major
boom over the past two years.
   The maquiladora workforce has grown 20 per cent since NAFTA took
effect, according to the new report, at the same time that an
estimated 1.6 million Mexicans have lost their jobs as a result of
the economic crisis. More than 85 per cent of the maquiladora
workers were employed near the border.
   Worse, the economic crisis in Mexico has greatly reduced the
ability of the country's state and federal health and environmental
authorities to deal with the increased industrial concentration
ccording to the report.

HONG KONG:  COUNTDOWN TO HANDOVER ENTERS CRUCIAL PHASE

Analysis by Yojana Sharma
   HONG KONG, Jan. 2 (IPS) -- The countdown to the handover of Hong
Kong to China has entered what is arguably its most crucial phase
with Beijing having handpicked its team to steer the colony through
the final 18 months of British rule.
   A preparatory committee of Hong Kong businessmen, academics,
politicians and other public figures was officially approved by
China's Parliament, the National People's Congress, last week.
   Together with high-ranking Chinese officials, led by foreign
minister Qian Qichen, they are expected to move quickly to set in
place an embryo administration that will take charge on July 1,
1997, when this vibrant economy becomes a Special Administrative
Region of China.
   The formation of the Preparatory Committee, which has the
blessing of Britain under the terms of the handover treaty signed
by Britain and China in 1984, "signifies the formal start of giving
up power by the British administration here," says Terry Cheng,
editor of the daily Hong Kong Standard.
   From now on, says Cheng, "things will move very fast and the
political environment will be quite changed by the end of the year
(1996)."
   The Committee is expected to begin its work almost immediately.
Its most important task is seen as the election by mid-year by a
committee executive of Hong Kong's first post-1997 governor, to
replace Chris Patten, the 28th and last British governor of Hong
Kong.
   A short-list of names is already thought to have been drawn up
by the Chinese authorities. The naming of the Governor-designate
will be an important milestone, analysts say.
   The governor-in-waiting will then pick his Executive Council,
bringing out into the open the nature of the first post-1997
government. "The candidates will have an important bearing on the
future running of the territory," noted Cheng.
   However, some analysts say there will be few surprises with such
a small number of Hong Kong people appointed to the Committee. Hong
Kong figures wanting to be appointed to the Committee are already
jockeying for position.
   In particular, several delegations of business tycoons, many of
them with business interests in China, visited Beijing in recent
weeks to meet top Chinese officials and lobby for a place on the
Committee. Many of them succeeded, sparking strong criticism that
the Committee is heavily skewed towards the business sector with
entire sectors of the Hong Kong population completely
unrepresented.
   No members of Hong Kong's pro-democracy Democratic Party, which
swept the Legislative Council polls in September, have been
appointed, leading to criticism that the Committee is packed with
"yes-men" who will do Beijing's bidding rather than stand up for
Hong Kong's interests.
   Hong Kong legislator Dr. Leong Che-Hung wonders how many Hong
Kong representatives on the committee "can claim to represent Hong
Kong people? How many have actually spoken the mind of Hong Kong
people in the past? Paradoxically, records have shown that many of
them have spoken or even acted against the wishes of Hong Kong
people."
   Defending China's decision to exclude the Democrats, Hong Kong
legislator and Committee member David Chu said the Committee needed
to work smoothly.
   "The Chinese government will appoint people who can work with
China. There is just over a year to prepare the transition (to
Chinese rule) and the volume of work is quite big and some of the
work quite controversial," he said.
   The vast majority of appointees have already sat on a
consultative body set up by China known as the Preliminary Working
Committee (PWC), which wound up in early December to make way for
the Preparatory Committee. The PWC was seen as having little
credibility with the Hong Kong public.
   Meanwhile public opinion polls by three universities conducted
by sociologist Lau Siu Kai, himself appointed to the Committee,
found that Hong Kong people were quickly losing faith in the
political establishment pre- and post-1997.
   Lau said the survey showed people had declining trust in
political institutions and leaders during the transition. "The
power of the British authorities is waning and the legitimacy of
the incoming Chinese authorities has yet to be established," he
said.
   Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten, who angered the Chinese with
his democratic reforms for the Colony also criticised the
Committee. "I think that...the lack of representativeness (of the
Committee) expresses China's attitude towards the territory.
   "I think there will inevitably be quite a lot of feeling in Hong
Kong that it's a great pity that China didn't show more trust for
opinion in Hong Kong and wasn't prepared to tap as wide a section
of opinion as possible," Patten told the British Broadcasting
Corporation (BBC).
   Analysts say that China still has its work cut out for it
shoring up Hong Kong's confidence in the post-1997 government, with
some predicting a mass exodus in 1996 if the future governor and
his team appear to be a self-serving group who will not stand up
to Beijing hardliners.
   "As for the ordinary people...their perception of future travel,
freedom, autonomy and rule of law will determine what course they
will take to cope with the changeover," said Cheng. "Some who have
already secured a right of abode elsewhere will leave next year if
they do not perceive the developments positively."
   Patten also warned: "If Chinese officials of the Preparatory
Committee go on delivering the same sort of shocks that Hong Kong
suffered in the last few months...if people start to doubt whether
Hong Kong really will have a high degree of independence after 1997
then they may decide to go abroad."
   Patten said there was little Britain could now do to reassure
people about the future. "The closer we get to 1997 the more people
will focus on the reality which is that more and more reassurance
is needed from China."
   Indirectly, Patten was also referring to Britain's declining
influence in the last days of its rule, with the Preparatory
Committee expected to be an important power center competing with
the Colonial administration in the final months.
   "The Chinese will have far greater influence on government
decision-making," noted Cheng.
   In particular once the name of the first post-1997 governor is
announced at mid-year, Patten will increasingly be seen as a lame
duck. As Cheng explained, while the post-1997 Governor-designate
and his team "will have no executive power...their views will be
much sought after...for any policy directions for post-1997 Hong
Kong."
   Hong Kong Liberal Party legislator Allen Lee, who was among
those appointed, admitted "at times the authority of the Hong Kong
government would be affected (by the Committee) whether the Hong
Kong government likes it or not."

PHILIPPINES:  NEW YEAR'S REVELRY FATAL FOR SCORES OF FILIPINOS

By Johanna Son
   MANILA, Jan. 2 (IPS) -- Not only do Filipinos observe the
world's longest Christmas season, they may well have the bloodiest
brand of New Year revelry too.
   For days after Filipinos welcome the New Year with
super-strength firecrackers like "Judas' Belt" and "Hiroshima",
newspapers and television stations keep a tally of people killed
or maimed by pyrotechnics at the height of holiday revelry.
   "Tradition dies hard, as does the stupidity of some people,"
commented Isyu, a popular tabloid that ran a picture of a doctor
working on the mangled hand of a firecracker victim grimacing in
pain.
   By this morning, newspapers reported that at least 23 persons
died and more than 800 persons were injured by firecrackers.
   Holiday fever in the Philippines begins as early as in October
and ends the first Sunday of January, on the Roman Catholic Feast
of the Three Kings. But yuletide celebrations reach their deafening
height on the midnight of Dec. 31.
   On New Year's Eve, emergency rooms of hospitals fill up with
blast and burn victims. Parts of Manila turn into mini-war zones,
where venturing out for a walk or drive is risky. Visibility dips
as smoke from exploded firecrackers engulfs the city.
   At least six people were killed by stray bullets fired by New
Years revellers into the sky, and scores more across the country
hurt by bullets.
   Thirteen fires broke out in the Philippine capital of Manila
during the early hours of Jan. 1, at least three of them started
by firecrackers falling on roofs or into storehouses.
   "Our insistence on exploding big firecrackers and firing guns
to welcome the new year must make other people wonder if we are
really a suicidal and homicidal race," said the Philippine Daily
Inquirer in its editorial today.
   "Or perhaps it is our desire to be the winner in the pyrotechnic
and noise Olympics: the bigger, the noisier, the deadlier, the
better. We do everything to excess, in the process injuring and
sometimes killing ourselves or other people," it added.
   But though the casualty count remained sizable, government
officials took some comfort in that it was considerably lower than
last year's toll.
   Some 4,500 persons were injured last year, many of whom lost
fingers or hands that were blasted away in accidents, by defective
firecrackers or by those powerful enough to sound and hurt like
small bombs. Health department officials attributed the lower
casualty toll to a national campaign to get Filipinos to use other
noisemakers instead of firecrackers.
   "The casualty toll has gone down by up to 50 per cent. Our
program for people to use horns has paid off somewhat," said Health
Secretary Hilarion Ramiro, who went on television to appeal to
people to avoid lighting firecrackers.
   Newspapers and radio stations reminded people to "be merry, not
sorry" during the New Year celebrations. TV stations tried to drive
the message home by running graphic footage of bloodied victims
maimed by firecracker blasts or burns.
   The government in fact made arrangements with more than 50
hospitals to treat up to 5,000 victims, with one hospital
designated as the National Registry for Firecracker-Related
Injuries.
   Largely unable to keep watch over firecracker factories, the
government has in recent years tried to dampen demand for
pyrotechnics by promoting the use of horns and other noisemakers
instead. But one of the most commonly-cited, and perhaps effective,
reasons for the lower casualty count this year has been the rising
cost of pyrotechnics, some of which are smuggled into the country.
Fancy firecrackers can cost well over $35 apiece.
   Members of the Martinez family say its supply of firecrackers
during this New Year's eve was good for only 30 minutes of revelry.
"We cut down because they're really getting expensive," said Danny
Martinez, a businessman.
   "While Filipinos rich and poor have been known to burn their
money, this becomes harder to do and easier to avoid when the
choice gets down to having a good dinner or a few noises," remarked
the Manila Times newspaper.

VENEZUELA-DRUGS:  CRIME BY WOMEN AND CHILDREN INCREASES

By Wilmer Poleo Zarpa
   CARACAS, Jan. 2 (IPS) -- Carmen Victoria lives in a marginal
neighborhood west of Caracas. She had her first child when she was
16 and her second child two years later. The fathers disappeared.
   Now in her early thirties, Carmen Victoria is an inmate of the
Los Teques women's prison 30 kilometers southwest of the capital.
Her oldest son, Juan Carlos, 16, is also imprisoned in a youth
reformatory. Both are charged with drug-related crimes.
   There are many cases in Venezuela like those of Carmen Victoria
and Juan Carlos, especially in the largest cities such as Caracas,
Maracay, Valencia, Barguisimeto and Maracaibo.
   The phenomenon has begun to cause concern but reliable
statistics about its incidence are not yet available.
   Nerio Rengifo, chief of the Judicial Technical Police's
Anti-Drug Division, acknowledges that the participation of women
and adolescents in criminal activity has grown significantly,
especially in the lower rungs of the illegal drug industry.
   Maribel Rodriguez, a sociologist with the Venezuelan Ministry
of Education, explained that "the country's economic crisis has hit
the population with the fewest resources especially hard."
   "In many families, children and youth find themselves compelled
for one reason or another, to leave school," she added.
   Lack of opportunity for poor children, youths and adults lead
to idleness which may encourage drug consumption or trafficking,
she said. Rodriguez noted the absence of education, sports and
cultural programs to help combat the problem.
   Rengifo agreed with the sociologist and added that much depended
on a child's upbringing and the ties created between parents and
child.
   "The situation is usually worse in poor neighborhoods where the
majority of children grow up parentless or where mothers have
children with different fathers," Rengifo said.
   The police chief said, "The mother must leave the children alone
for the better part of the day while she looks for sustenance."
   To this he added "the dearth of paternal role models to follow"
and a repressed desire for betterment which he says makes the poor
adolescent easy prey for any kind of criminal activity, with role
models found on every street and corner.
   Guillermo Romero, president of the National Commission Against
Illegal Drug Use (Conacuid) and the government's leading authority
on the issue agrees that the nuclear family is the basis for
education in every sense, including learning to reject drugs.
   For that reason, the National Plan for Prevention and Control
of Drug Production, Trafficking and Consumption emphasizes
prevention and the paramount need to actively include the
community, Romero explained.
   Community participation is given priority when developing
information, training and education programs directed toward
preventing drug trafficking and consumption, Romero said.
   The government, police and sociologists all agree that
prevention is the best tool. Commissioner Rengifo insisted that the
problem "will never be solved with repressive policies."
   Police believed that the solution lies in "confronting the lack
of family planning and fighting idleness by increasing activities
in poor neighborhoods," he said
   Conacuid has proposed reformulating all educational programs to
include specific objectives referring to the prevention of drug
trafficking and consumption.
   Romero announced plans for an epidemiological study that will
serve as the basis for the National Plan because it will provide
a better understanding of the general problem and specific
conditions in each neighborhood.
   "Nevertheless, we have to be clear that this is an ethical and
moral problem, a problem for everyone, and that consequently the
solution should be supported by everyone," Romero opined.
   Sociologist Ruth Taborda, who is also with the Ministry of
Education, added that the involvement of minors with drugs requires
stronger action for "preventive intervention in the family, school,
and community."
   Taborda said that she had developed concrete initiatives and
strategies that are broadly divided into a teacher training program
and a program to develop youth activists.
   "Using specific projects, we're seeking to train teachers in
preventive activity and also to develop youth leaders in the
schools," Taborda explained.

PAKISTAN-AFGHANISTAN:  PROXY WAR TESTS DOMESTIC POLITICS

By Nasim Zehra
   ISLAMABAD, Jan. 2 (IPS) -- Determined to be seen as a big player
in Afghanistan, Pakistan has urged President Burhanuddin Rabbani
to smooth the way for talks on resolving the protracted war,
ignoring Rabbani's own unconditional offer for peace parleys.
   Foreign Minister Sardar Assef said in a televised interview over
the weekend that the "prime responsibility" for restoring peace in
Afghanistan rests with Rabbani, and had nothing to say about the
sudden raising of hopes for peace in Afghanistan.
   Afghanistan's beleaguered president last month surprised Afghan
watchers by offering to travel out of his fortified capital to the
strongholds of his rivals for talks to end the fierce battle for
power that has devastated the country.
   The Taliban student militia, who are Rabbani's biggest
challengers, are reported to be considering the offer. After an
expected initial rebuff, they now say they will make a decision
after receiving details.
   Commentators in Islamabad think Assef's silence on Rabbani's
offer may be the result of disquiet in Pakistan over the softening
of rigid stands by Rabbani and the Taliban. In Afghanistan's ethnic
power struggle, Pakistan is on the side of the Taliban who swept
out of seminaries in Pakistan in 1994 to threaten Rabbani's control
of Afghanistan.
   Islamabad's support for the student militants has strained its
previously cozy relations with Iran, which has thrown its
considerable weight behind Rabbani. Afghanistan is at the center
of a regional proxy war between neighbors bent on increasing their
presence in the strategic area.
   The Taliban control 11 of Afghanistan's 32 provinces, and since
October have laid siege to Kabul. Afghanistan's historic capital
has been nearly completely destroyed in the war that erupted a few
months after mujahiddin forces ousted the pro-communist government
of Najibullah in April 1992.
   Rival factions trained on each other the stockpiles of
sophisticated arms and ammunition supplied by the United States via
Pakistan during the mujahiddin's 12-year war with the Afghan
government.
   Now fighting for control are the Persian-speaking
Tajik-controlled government of Rabbani ranged against the Uzbek
warlord General Rashid Dostam, the ethnic Pushtoon Hizbul Islami
chief Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, and the Taliban student warriors.
   On Dec. 30, eight Afghan civilians were killed and 41 injured
when a deadly new wave of shells and rockets smashed into Kabul
from Taliban positions on Kabul's fringes. The International
Committee of the Red Cross estimates factional fighting in and
around Kabul has killed more than a quarter million people.
   Tens of thousands of civilians have fled Kabul and many are
living in refugee camps in Pakistan's north and northwest.
Tolerated earlier, they are increasingly being viewed as a threat
to internal security in Pakistan.
   A wave of bomb attacks in Pakistan -- the worst being the blast
in Peshawar on Dec. 21 and the bombing of the Egyptian Embassy in
Islamabad on Nov. 19 -- are believed to be the fallout of
Afghanistan's lingering civil war.
   Political observers warn of worsening law and order because of
Pakistan's proxy military intervention in Afghanistan. While there
is no conclusive evidence, the involvement of the Rabbani regime
in master-minding some attacks is also suspected. In September,
Pakistan's embassy in Kabul was razed to the ground.
   Hardliners are campaigning for a military retaliatory attack on
the Afghan government. "Pakistan should attack Rabbani's military
target to teach a lesson," said Nawabzada Nasrullah Khan, chairman
of the Kashmir Committee, at a press conference.
   In his opinion, this would be acceptable to the world community
which has not demurred when Israel's military attacked Hezbollah
targets in south Lebanon. They are not attacks of aggression but
for the protection of its citizens, he explained.
   However, as its response, Pakistan has only expelled the
Peshawar-based member of the Afghan Council, Moosa Khan, and
ordered that all foreign non-governmental groups working with
refugees must be staffed either by their own nationals or by
Pakistanis.
   Pakistan is awash with weapons and explosives, and it is
virtually impossible for the security forces to control the flow
of arms and men across its borders. Many militant Islamic groups
abroad have originated in Pakistan.
   Like the Taliban who have learned their lessons in warfare in
southwestern Baluchistan province, Islamic groups from Algeria to
Sudan and Egypt have roots in Pakistan's religious seminaries.
During the war conducted by Afghan mujahiddin against the
Soviet-backed Kabul regime, they received training in warfare and
the handling of explosives.
   Meanwhile, the Benazir Bhutto government in Islamabad has been
cracking down on the religious right to change Pakistan's image
abroad as a breeding ground for Islamic militants. Islamic radicals
last week expressed their outrage by calling a nationwide strike
against the government, accusing it of being un-Islamic.
   Liberal Pakistanis worry about an Islamic takeover. The fears
were heightened by disclosures about an abortive coup planned in
September last year by a group of fundamentalist officers in the
Pakistan army.

CAMEROON-AGRICULTURE:  FARMERS AND CATTLE-OWNERS CLASH OVER LAND

by Tansa Musa
   BAMENDA, Jan. 2 (IPS) -- The administrator of Wum, in
north-western Cameroon, had barely settled down to a day's work
when 150 women from a neighboring village began chanting protest
songs outside his office demanding the release from detention of
one of their kith and kin.
   Ekom David Achuo, the husband of one of the demonstrating women,
had earlier caught four cows that had devoured three-quarters of
his crop and marched them to the local police station, demanding
an investigation and compensation from the animals' owner. Instead
the police beat him up and detained him the whole day.
   Rather than freeing Achuo, the administrator ordered the women
away. Angrily they tore off their clothes, a common form of
ultimate protest among African women, at which the official fled.
   "We've had enough of this," fumed the leader of the group of
women. "They (the administration) have taken all our land and given
it to the Bororos (mainly cattle grazers in the region)."
   "Now we have no more land to farm on. Even when we grow crops
on what is left, they send their cows to destroy everything. And
each time we complain, the administration does nothing about it,"
she added.
   Wum, like most of the province, has been the scene of
increasingly violent conflicts over the past two decades between
farmers and immigrant cattle grazers.
   The competition has been inflamed by unregulated farming and
grazing, rapid population growth, and alleged bias on the part of
the local administration.
   Cattle rearing was first introduced to this primarily farming
area by Nigerian Fulani nomads (also known as Bororos) in the
1930's. In time, cattle became a sign of wealth even among locals.
   Northwestern Cameroon is mainly rough, hilly terrain and only
five per cent of the land is arable. The problem has been
compounded by shifting cultivation, a common practice among local
farmers whereby they exploit an area of land for three years, then
move onto another, leaving the first one fallow.
   In an area with no industries where 95 per cent of the
population of 1.8 million depend on subsistence agriculture, the
pressure on the land has reached the point of violence between
cultivators and cattle owners.
   According to Ali Tal, an agricultural expert here, farmer-grazer
disputes are a headache for both agricultural and veterinary
(livestock) services.
   Amos Chanji of the provincial livestock service in Bamenda
believes the solution lies in better land use by farmers and better
ranching by cattle breeders. But Ali says efforts to teach
sustainable farming and land use for high altitudes have failed.
   "We are quite aware that there is a shortage of land here," says
Dr. Idrissou Bapetel, veterinary officer for Wum. "We have tried
to demarcate grazing land from farm land. But nobody, neither the
farmer nor the grazer, respects the demarcation line. So we're
caught in between the two. We just don't know what to do."
   The clashes here have occasionally led to loss of property or
even life.
   Three months ago, a man stabbed during a fight with a
cattle-owner near his farm died in the hospital; in Ndu, part of
the neighboring Donga-Mantung Division, a herder burned down a hut
holding a farmer's harvest for the whole year when the farmer's
children stoned his cows for eating their crops.
   The violence has been attributed to the way in which
administrators have resolved the clashes. Often the Bororos, who
are usually richer than the farmers, bribe administrators in cash
or cattle to rule in their favor.
   Residents of Wat in Donga-Mantung say one major cattle-owner
comes before the courts at least six times a year, but always
emerges victorious.
   "All he needs to do is give the divisional officer one of his
many cows and the case is settled," a resident told IPS. But
administrators vehemently deny this.
   "You know, in this situation it is difficult to satisfy the two
sides. We try to let them understand that the two communities must
live together. The society needs the crops of the farmers as well
as the cattle the grazers raise. So the two must cohabit," says
James Yega, deputy divisional officer for Wum.
   Yega blames most of the problems on farmers who consider
themselves the original owners of the land: "They say the Bororos
are strangers encroaching on their land...But these people
(Bororos) are also Cameroonians and have equal access to land."

EAST ASIA-POLITICS:  IN JAPAN, SOUTH KOREA, PUBLIC LOSING FAITH

Analysis by Suvendrini Kakuchi
   TOKYO, Jan. 2 (IPS) -- Corruption at the highest levels in
politics and business in Japan and South Korea is nothing new, say
analysts. It was ignored or tolerated by East Asian populations
riding a wave of more than a decade of rapid economic growth.
   Not so anymore. In a less economically vibrant Japan and a more
politically open South Korea, corruption is no longer viewed as a
necessary evil. Indeed, it is seen as an obstacle to future
development -- hence the emphasis on change by the government
leaders of both countries in their New Year messages yesterday.
   "Setting straight the historical record in order to rectify past
wrongs will be a starting point in which we should take pride and
it will also signal the birth of a new society," said South Korea
President Kim Young Sam.
   He has vowed to leave no stone unturned to bring the guilty to
justice with regard to corruption and coup-related incidents for
which two former presidents and several leading businessmen have
been arrested and indicted over the past few months.
   In Tokyo, where the government has been rocked by a series of
financial scandals, Japanese Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama spent
much time on his government's plans to deregulate the economy in
such a way that bureaucrats would no longer have carte blanche over
the disbursement of public funds.
   "By promoting structural reform, deregulation and
liberalization, the outlook for the economy will be bright this
year," Murayama said in his New Year message yesterday.
   Both leaders urged public understanding as they try to make up
for past mistakes. They have to, say analysts, who feel the
scandals have threatened to undermine years of economic
development.
   The Japanese population is just about fed up with the political
establishment, commented Japan's Yomuiri Shimbun newspaper in an
editorial after last month's arrest of former labor minister Toshio
Yamaguchi.
   He faces charges of using his former position to secure 1.9
billion yen ($19 million) in illegal loans from the now defunct
Tokyo Kyowa Credit Association and Anzen Credit Bank to help
relatives set up businesses that until recently raked in huge
profits.
   Not surprisingly, the Japanese public reacted with outrage when
the 60-year-old Yamaguchi refused to answer questions from
prosecutors and even evoked his special parliamentary immunity,
forcing the government to endorse his arrest at the last moment.
   Yamaguchi, deputy secretary of the reformist New Frontier Party,
continues to deny any wrongdoing, but in the eyes of a public tired
by reports of impropriety regarding present and former government
officials he is already deemed guilty, noted the newspaper Asahi
Shimbun.
   Asahi Shimbun also expects that an even bigger scandal,
involving the New York branch of the Daiwa Bank, will also see
those accused found guilty of mismanagement.
   Last week, that bank's former manager Masahiro Tsuda was
indicted by a New York court on charges of defrauding the U.S.
Federal Reserve by concealing $1.12 billion of trading losses.
   In November, Federal and New York State banking regulators
ordered Daiwa to close its operations in the United States after
a grand jury accused banking officials of illegally covering up
huge trading losses.
   The scandals have dealt a severe blow to Japan's image and much
of the heat has in turn been focused on the finance ministry for
failing to put adequate controls in place to preempt the illegal
activity.
   The resignation of the ministry's top-ranking bureaucrat,
administrative vice-finance minister Kyosuke Shin, is a reflection
of the turmoil caused by the bad-loan scandals, including the
mammoth bad debt problem faced by housing loan companies.
   "I have decided to step down to let some fresh air into the
ministry as 1996 starts, at a time when the morale of ministry
officials has been shaken by a series of incidents," he said in his
resignation letter, which was accepted Dec. 29 by Finance Minister
Masayoshi Takemura.
   Shinozawa, whose resignation becomes effective on Dec. 29, said
his resignation should not be seen in the light of a failing on his
part with regard to any particular "incident."
   Last month, the ministry unveiled a plan to spend billions of
dollars in public funds to shore up bankrupt housing loan
companies. Economic analysts applaud the initiative, but the
taxpayers are not enthusiastic about having to foot the bill for
the ministry's mistakes.
   Observers expect the government will try to put a lid on the
scandal by announcing reshuffles within the ministry. This,
however, may not be acceptable in today's Japan where unemployment
hit a post-war high of 3.4 per cent in November.
   According to Tokyo Business Today, a leading magazine on Japan's
economy, politics and business have deep-rooted bonds in Japanese
society -- ties forged for mutual gain.
   "Money is not the only reward enjoyed by politicians who do
favors for companies," said the magazine. "Electoral support also
plays a major part in the relationship. At election time companies
mobilize people, materials and money in support of the right sort
of politician."
   The business magazine says corruption goes deeper, with
politicians campaigning for large budget allocations for certain
ministries "expecting in turn to be accommodated (by bureaucrats)
when they put in a word for a favored company at contract time."
   Analysts in Seoul say that in South Korea corruption is
similarly rampant, adding that the political upheavals now rocking
the country should not be viewed only in the context of the coup
trials now taking place.
   The coup trials involve former South Korean president Roh Tae
Woo and his predecessor, who led the nation in the 1980's. They
have been arrested and charged for crimes ranging from bribery to
insurrection.
   Roh, South Korea's first elected president and often considered
the main instigator of democratic reform after decades of military
rule, is under arrest for accumulating a $6.5 million slush fund
from top business leaders.
   But just as in Japan, those arrested remain defiant in the face
of public disenchantment. Such is the case with Chun, one of the
nation's most formidable military dictators, who went on a hunger
strike to protest his arrest. He is now in hospital.
   Japanese and South Korean leaders find it difficult to accept
fault for their actions because they have become so accustomed to
a system which has earlier been considered part and parcel of East
Asian economic development.
   South Korea's now dynamic conglomerates enjoy state protection
through subsidies and regulations. In return it has been the
practice to handsomely reward politicians, who use the money to
finance their political campaigns.
   Meanwhile the economy has prospered, creating jobs -- one reason
why no fuss was made. Another reason is that the political
establishment used to be less open to criticism.
   "The power of a democratically awakened people has a lot to do
with the impending fate of the two former presidents awaiting
justice," South Korean analyst Mary B. Kim wrote in The Korea
Herald.
   Both Roh and Chun have been indicted on charges of corruption
and instigating a 1979 military coup that eventually carried them
to power.
   "To see these politicians in prison garb is a tremendous blow
to the nation's confidence," said Mary B. Kim. "The only way South
Koreans can redeem their loss is by hoping the current crisis will
clean the bad, old system."

DEVELOPMENT:  THIRD WORLD GROWTH SLOW OVER LAST DECADE

   WASHINGTON, Dec. 30 (IPS) -- Despite a decade of reform, most
Third World economies grew at a per capita rate of only one per
cent or less from 1985 through 1994, according to the latest
edition of the World Bank's annual Atlas.
   Considered as a region, African economies performed the worst
over the decade, with Cameroon claiming last place with a per
capita growth rate of minus 6.6 per cent. But Nicaragua's economy
also declined dramatically, at a rate of minus 6.4 per cent.
   Declines in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union were in
many cases even more dramatic, with growth rates ranging from minus
0.9 per cent for Hungary and Poland to minus 18.6 per cent for
Georgia.
   Western industrialized economies, on the other hand, grew at a
fairly consistent rate of between one and two per cent, although
Sweden turned in zero per capita growth over the decade and
Finland's economy dipped at a 0.3 per cent per capita rate during
the ten years.
   As expected, the decade's star performers were Asian, with
Thailand turning in the strongest per capita growth rate of 8.2
per cent, followed by South Korea at 7.8 per cent, and China and
Singapore both at 6.9 per cent.
   Botswana, the African leader, was next with a rate of 6.6 per
cent. Highest in Latin America was Chile, with a 6.2 per cent per
capita growth rate.
   The Atlas, a yearly publication which contains a wealth of
statistical data on education, health, environmental quality,
energy use, and economic performance, notes wide disparities
between rich and poor nations.
   For example, the average citizen of Luxembourg, rated as the
world's richest country and with a per capita gross domestic
product (GDP) of $39,845, is almost 500 times richer than his
Mozambican counterpart, whose per capita GDP share of $80 is the
world's lowest.
   Using a different criterion called purchasing power parity (PPP)
which measures the purchasing power in each country in equivalent
U.S. dollars, the gap comes out somewhat smaller. Luxembourg's per
capita PPP is $31,090, while Mozambique's is about $550.
   In 1993, Luxembourg's energy consumption was 9,879 kilograms of
oil equivalent per person. That was about 1,400 times more than the
energy usage in the country at the other extreme, Somalia, whose
citizens consumed the equivalent of only seven kilograms of oil
that year.
   Indeed, Africa remains by far the poorest continent in the world
in almost every respect. Sierra Leone has the highest infant
mortality rate, with 164 children of every thousand succumbing
during their first year of life. In Japan and Sweden, which have
the lowest rates, only four and five children of every thousand,
respectively, die before their first birthday.
   Sierra Leone also had the lowest average life expectancy at
birth -- only 39 years. A cluster of other African nations and
Afghanistan averaged in the mid-40s. In contrast, the average life
expectancy for people in developed countries rose from 71 in 1970
to 77 in 1993.
   The Atlas argues that education and high economic growth are
linked. Botswana, China, Indonesia, Korea and Singapore -- all with
growth rates of over six per cent over the past decade -- have 96
per cent or more of their primary-age children enrolled in school.
   Despite Africa's relative poverty, child malnutrition is
generally worse in South Asia. As measured by the percentage which
is found to be underweight, 68 per cent of the children in
Bangladesh are malnourished, as are 63 per cent of Indian children;
50 per cent of Nepalis and 40 per cent of Pakistanis fall into the
malnourished category.
   Forty-six per cent of the children of Indonesia, one of the
Bank's star performers, were also found to be malnourished, as were
42 per cent of Vietnamese children.
   But the Bank does not have similar statistics on most of the
world's countries, including much of Africa, the Middle East, and
the former Soviet republics.
   The Atlas also discloses that in most parts of the world women
make up more than 30 per cent of the formal work force, but that
in 20 predominantly Muslim countries, they amount to less than 20
per cent. In Bangladesh, women make up only eight per cent of the
work force.

ENVIRONMENT:  GREEN CONVENTIONS YET TO PROVE EFFECTIVE

By Pratap Chatterjee
   WASHINGTON, Jan. 2 (IPS) -- The good environmental news for 1996
is that industrialized countries yesterday halted the production
of chloroflourocarbons (CFCs), the chemicals that destroy the
mantle of ozone which surrounds the planet, protecting it from the
sun's harmful ultra-violent radiation.
   The bad environmental news for 1996 is that the production of
carbon dioxide, another major contributor to the warming of the
planet, is much higher than predicted.
   Does this mean that the ozone layer is improving even as global
warming is getting worse? Not so far. Preliminary data for 1995
show that both the ozone layer and the global climate have fared
worse than expected.
   This is despite the fact that two international environmental
laws, the 1987 Montreal Protocol for Substances that Deplete the
Ozone Layer and the 1992 Framework Convention on Climate Change,
have been in place for some time to prevent these very
environmental disasters .
   "In an ideal world, the good news would be just so. But climate
change and ozone depletion are not isolated phenomona. More carbon
dioxide warms the lower atmosphere and causes higher ozone
depletion," says Kalee Kreider from Ozone Action, a
Washington-based environmental group.
   Many companies have substituted ozone-depleting CFCs with
hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs). But both chemicals contribute to global
warming.
   "Conventions work to eliminate specific chemicals.
Unfortunately, the real world is complex and interactive so
progress on one chemical can be canceled out by increased
production of another chemical," adds Kreider.
   Scientists from the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Agency
(NASA) say that the data from 2,000 land-based weather-monitoring
stations around the world show that 1995 was the hottest year of
the 130 years for which information is available.
   Meanwhile, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) reported
in September that the seasonal "hole" that opens up in the ozone
layer over Antarctic at the winter's end was roughly the area of
Europe, twice the previous year's size.
   This is about the same size as the hole that was opened up the
year that Mount Pinatubo erupted in the Philippines. Scientists
blamed a rapid increase in the size of the ozone hole that year on
the ash and gases released by the volcano and predicted that the
hole would soon return to a more normal size.
   Scientists say that the problem with any prediction is that
there are numerous assumptions involved, many of which often turn
out to be wrong.
   Activists say that the latest data also show that global
conventions are useless without effective regulation and
enforcement.
   Take global warming. In 1992, governments signed an agreement
in Rio de Janiero to voluntarily cut back on the burning of fossil
fuels, which produces carbon dioxide, to bring national emission
levels down to those of 1990.
   That relatively modest goal fell far short of the 60 per cent
cut in greenhouse emissions that scientists have warned is the
minimum necessary to stabilize the global climate.
   But even this target has proven elusive. Preliminary data for
1995 shows that the United States produced 1,418 million metric
tons of carbon emissions, 5.5 per cent more than it produced in
1990.
   Skip Laitner, of the Virginia-based American Council for an
Energy Efficient Economy, wrote recently that much of the target
could have been met easily if U.S. consumers had invested more in
energy-efficient appliances and vehicles.
   "The lagging efficiency gains are all the more ironic since
earlier studies have shown that meeting the international goals
will increase both employment and economic productivity," he says.
   But energy efficiency alone is not enough to check carbon
emissions. Although fuel efficiency for U.S. cars rose from 5.7
kilometers to 8.9 kilometers to the liter between 1969 and 1990,
auto carbon emissions failed to come down.
   Partly because of the associated cost-saving, U.S. drivers drove
2.4 trillion kilometers in 1990, 50 per cent more than the
1.6.trillion kilometers they logged in 1969. That pushed total fuel
consumption from 242 billion to 273 billion liters.
   The United States is not the only country to miss the targets.
Analysts say that Japan's carbon emissions will exceed their 1990
levels by 5.75 per cent in the year 2000.
   The Canadians have already announced that they will miss the
target by 10 per cent, while unpublished memos from the European
Union show that it expects to be off by six to eight per cent.
   The problems with fulfilling the climate change convention are
two-fold. First, the convention is voluntary; second, governments
continue to pay out large subsidies to industries that rely on
fossil fuels. The United States estimates that its subsidies for
fossil fuels amount to between $10 billion and $15 billion
annually. Estimates for global subsidies range as high as $230
billion a year.
   Or take the depletion of the ozone layer. Yesterday, companies
in industrialized countries officially stopped all production of
CFCs to comply with the Montreal protocol.
   The problems with fulfilling this convention are also two-fold.
First, the ban does not cover consumption. The result is a thriving
smuggling racket.
   CFC smuggling is already making headlines. Last month, the
United States asked Costa Rica to extradite former Miami resident
Bruce Burrell, who was arrested in San Jose for allegedly trying
to smuggle 19,000 cylinders of CFCs into the U.S.
   U.S. government spies working on a covert operation called
"Operation Cool Breeze" discovered that an estimated five to ten
thousand tons of CFCs are being smuggled in to this country each
year.
   Second, CFC substitutes, like HFCs, which are favored by
industry, also have an ozone-depleting effect.
   This means that companies like Maytag and Sanyo continue to
market refrigerators that deplete the ozone. It also means that
companies like Dupont can buy and stockpile CFCs from
non-industrialized countries, which have another ten years to
phase-out CFCs under the Montreal accord.
   "What this shows is that nothing short of a global ban and
strong regulation will work," says Kreider.

U.S.-MEXICO:  CITIZENS' GROUP DEPLORES NAFTA FAILURES ON BORDER

   WASHINGTON, Jan. 2 (IPS) -- Citizens' groups in both the United
States and Mexico are criticizing the failure of the North American
Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) to improve public health and the
environment along the two countries' border.
   In a new report released here today, the Washington-based Public
Citizen organization and the Red Mexicana de Accion Frente al Libre
Comercio (RMALC) of Mexico City claim that promises by backers of
the two-year-old free trade deal that the border would be cleaned
up under the agreement have been betrayed.
   "Not only is NAFTA not meeting these promises," said Public
Citizen president Joan Claybrook, a top consumer official in the
administration of former president Jimmy Carter. "It has actually
made conditions worse than before it took effect two years ago."
   The 100-page report, entitled "NAFTA's Broken Promises: The
Border Betrayed", provides data on trends in the concentration of
maquiladora industries in the border area, air and water pollution,
hazardous waste, and birth defects attributable to environmental
causes over the past two years.
   Based on published records and interviews with more than one
hundred experts and government officials, the report says that the
promise of improved border conditions relied on three developments.
   It was expected that the maquiladoras would move away from the
border area into Mexico's interior, and that citizens and state
and local governments in the area would become wealthier given the
expected increase in two-way trade enabling them to devote more
money to environmental clean-up and better health enforcement.
   The optimistic predictions were also based on the belief that
strong agencies created under NAFTA would also improve enforcement
of environmental laws.
   But none of these assumptions has been realized, according to
the report.
   The dispersion of maquiladora industries was, according to the
administration of President Bill Clinton, one of the principal aims
of the accord. These industries, mostly assembly plants, not only
bring workers into already-crowded areas, but they also put strains
on natural resources, like water, and use chemicals which
contribute to water and air pollution.
   "If NAFTA is not implemented incentives will continue under the
maquiladoras to locate facilities in the border areas, thus
exacerbating environmental pressures on the border, such as loss
of habitat, adverse impacts to endangered and threatened species,
and reductions in groundwater levels," according to one
administration briefing paper.
   But contrary to that prediction, the new report says that the
maquiladora work force has actually grown by 20 per cent over the
last two years, from 546,000 to almost 700,000.
   The increase in maquiladora employment, according to the report,
is especially remarkable, given the fact that over the past year
some 1.6 million Mexicans have lost their jobs as a result of the
peso's collapse and the tight, anti-inflationary policy followed
by the government of President Ernesto Zedillo.
   "As NAFTA opponents had predicted, the increased industrial
concentration has only intensified air and water pollution, dumping
of hazardous waste, and, most tragically, the rate of disease
associated with environmental degradation, including Hepatitis-A,
cholera and birth defects," said Lori Wallach who directs Public
Citizen's Global Trade Watch.
   As to the improvement of resources to deal with the pollution
and better regulate industries in the border area, the collapse of
the Mexican peso has meant huge cutbacks in spending by both
Mexico's federal and local governments. Mexican Foreign Secretary
Jose Angel Gurria has said that Mexico has put on hold
participation in border environmental projects because of the
economic crisis, according to the report.
   At the same time, the Republican-led U.S. Congress has also cut
funding for border programs, while the World Bank has rearranged
its loan portfolio to Mexico to the detriment of environmental
programs.
   The result is that while private investment in the border area
has risen sharply since NAFTA took effect, both public investment
and the resources needed to ensure that the public's interest in
the environmental quality of the area and the health of its
citizens have fallen, according to the report.
   Nor have the new NAFTA-related institutions, mainly the
Commission on Environmental Cooperation, the Border Environmental
Cooperation Commission (BECC) and the North American Development
Bank (NADBank) even begun to fill the vacuum.
   The Commission, for example, has not yet heard a single case
involving the failure of the Mexican government to enforce its
environmental laws, while the NADBank, established to provide
low-interest loans for water and waste-treatment in border
communities, has yet to make its first loan.
   Nor is its director, Alfredo Phillips Olmedo, very optimistic
that the situation will change soon. "We have come to the
conclusion that it will be a more difficult process than originally
expected for the bank to engage in substantial lending operations
in the short term," he recently told a public meeting.
   Public Citizen is calling for passage of the NAFTA
Accountability Act, a bill recently introduced by two prominent
Democratic foes of the trade pact. It calls for renegotiating key
parts of NAFTA.

CUBA-ECONOMY:  NO READJUSTMENT WITHOUT BANKING REFORM

By Dalia Acosta
   HAVANA, Jan. 2 (IPS) -- The tidal wave of radical change in Cuba
will go full steam ahead in the new year with government plans for
deep banking reform to consolidate the economic readjustment.
   The renewal, cooked up by the National Bank of Cuba (BNC), would
do away with the state monopoly on banking, resurrecting structures
which were seen as "un-socialist" for more than 30 years.
   BNC president Francisco Soberon said a banking system is needed
to offer rapid, secure and effective payment, channeling savings
to where they can be most efficiently used and guarantee the
functioning of the economy.
   Specialist sources said that the market economy, adopted
gradually, will force the nation to play a competitive financial
game which will be impossible to win if all the power is in one
pair of hands.
   The decentralization process began to gain ground two years ago
when the currency reserves reached rock bottom, forcing the
government to search around for loans and financing for the
investments.
   The first sign of the process really getting underway was the
creation of the International Bank of Commerce Ltd. (BICSA), in
January 1994, which took over the commercial arm of the BNC and is
today at the core of a budding corporation called New Bank Ltd.
   BNC vice president Jose Rodriquez declared in November that the
new banking group was affiliated to the chain of currency
exchanges, CADECA S.A., the financial novelty with the most impact
for the average Cuban.
   The National Financier Ltd. (FINSA) was also created to provide
more flexible financing for businesses in Cuba, above all in
short-term loans.
   However, the fact that all the new bodies will ultimately be
under the control of the New Bank has raised suspicions among
observers.
   Soberon and other authorities defend the need to separate the
functions of the Central Bank and the Commercial Bank. They want
to see the creation of a Central Bank to control national financial
activity, alongside organisms like the Ministry of Finance and
Prices.
   Specialist sources state that the national banking system has
been forced to diversify its structures in order to respond to
similar changes taking place in the economy.
   The few large state-owned companies which dominated agricultural
production have given way to a mass of more than 3,000 cooperative
basic production units, 1,161 agricultural cooperatives and 86,000
private agricultural producers.
   Any way you look at it, the banking reform will have to plan its
action in order to support the tendency towards self-employed
workers, small, medium-sized and private businesses.
   For the time being, most of the pressure in Cuba is coming from
the changes in foreign trade: the desperate need for credit opened
the nation up to foreign investment and commercial autonomy was
granted to more than 240 national businesses.
   The presence of representatives from 11 foreign banks on the
island has introduced the important ingredient of competition and
revealed the increasing interest awakened by the Cuban economic
changes.
   However, the government is trying to keep control of a chunk of
the internal market of banking business, just as they did with
foreign investment.
   Rodriguez said that "the foreign banks are not authorized to
carry out any banking activity in the country."
   Their role is limited to "promoting the business of the island's
banks," he said, and for the present, "there is no possibility of
giving licenses to any foreign bank to offer other types of
services in Cuba."
   The Spanish Bilbao Vizcaya Bank (BBV) recently opened a branch
in Cuba, offering financing for the Las Tunas area sugar
production, in association with the PEMBA.
   The Netherland Caribbean Bank is also there, along with the
Spanish Exterior Bank, the Sabadel Bank and the Royal Bank of
Canada.
   A party to celebrate the 45th anniversary of the Central Bank
recently was attended by representatives of 120 banks from 45
countries, showing that despite the operative limitations, the
foreign banks are very interested in the Cuban economy.
   BNC workers said that this meeting opened new perspectives for
a solution to the problem of the national foreign debt.
   In the opinion of local economists, foreign debt is one of the
main obstacles to the country entering fully into the capital
market and achieving economic growth. Not counting the money owed
to the former Soviet Union, the foreign debt runs to $8.6 billion.

PANAMA:  THE UNSETTLED ISSUE OF RETRIBUTION

By Silvio Hernandez
   PANAMA CITY, Jan. 2 (IPS) -- Six years after the bloody U.S.
invasion in December 1989, the Panamanian people are still pressing
Washington for financial settlement for the death of some 2,500
civilians.
   "We will never forget," reads a notice erected in central Panama
City by the relatives of the dead.
   On Dec. 20, 1989, the United States launched a surprise attack
on Panama City and Colon, with more than 30,000 soldiers, planes,
helicopters and warships, in order to overthrow General Manuel
Noriega.
   The United States has invaded Panama fourteen times since 1856
on the pretext of protecting "vital interests" or U.S. citizens in
the nation.
   President of the Omar Torrijos Foundation, Alma Montenegro,
described this attack as "the most bloody of all (U.S.) invasions
of Panama," and the Secretary General of the National Workers
Center, Elberto Cobos, said that it left "deep wounds in the
national consciousness."
   Demands for justice against the United States, proclamations,
vigils and demonstrations each Dec. 20 "show that those deep wounds
are not healing and will not heal until the US military presence
is ended."
   The 1977 canal treaties dictate that all U.S. troops must be
withdrawn by Dec. 31, 1999, when all the military bases will be
handed over to Panamanian jurisdiction along with the canal itself.
   A controversial petition drawn up by President Bill Clinton last
September, and sent to Panamanian President Ernesto Perez
Balladares proposed "exploring" the possibility of the bases
remaining active.
   Cobos said that "the lesson" the Panamanians received on Dec.
20, 1989 "is that they must strengthen their independence and
consolidate their sovereignty on the basis of the strict fulfilment
of the (1977) treaties."
   Representative of the Committee for the Rescue of Sovereignty,
Paola Herrera, told IPS that "the United States has a
responsibility for the events of Dec. 20 (1989) that cannot be
by-passed."
   Around 200 tradespeople, whose businesses were destroyed by the
invading army, and families of the victims, presented the U.S. with
a demand for $300 million two years ago. Herrera said the demand
had not even been recognized by Washington, and that the amount
claimed was only a fraction of the cost of damage to the Panamanian
State and infrastructure.
   She stressed that the government of former president Guillermo
Endara, who took over the post in a U.S. base in the canal zone
only hours before the invasion, along with the present leader, "are
also responsible for not demanding war reparations."
   She said the U.S. army stole "millions of dollars of equipment
from the old National Defense Forces (once they were defeated),
destroying buildings, offices, and other state structures, and the
government passivity means they have never paid anything back."
   The local justice system, "never called to trial the U.S.
soldiers who committed crimes against unarmed Panamanian civilians,
even though many of them were duly identified."
   Meanwhile, "several members of the old National Defense Forces
are being tried for the death of two gringos (U.S. civilians)," who
died in the invasion.
   The father of Carlos Puga, who died in the invasion, said, "I
have not seen justice for my son...(he) died unarmed at the hands
of the invading forces in an open violation of human rights."
   He described the invasion as "genocide, for which the United
States must be made to pay reparations."
   The 135,000 member National Federation of Public Servants
(FENASEP) has called for the trial of Endara and his vice
presidents, Ricardo Arias Calderon and Guillermo Ford, for being
"accomplices of the 1989 invasion."
   FENESEP spokesman, Maximo Gomez accused the trio of being "the
creators and accomplices of this invasion, proved by the fact that
they took over power in a U.S. base."

MEXICO:  SUBCOMMANDER MARCOS ANNOUNCES ZAPATISTA POLITICAL FRONT

By Eduardo Molina y Vedia
   MEXICO CITY, Jan. 2 (IPS) -- Yesterday's announcement that the
Zapatista National Liberation Army (EZLN) will become a national
political front will not necessarily mean an end to guerrilla
tactics, said local experts in Mexico today.
   Zapatista leader "Subcommander Marcos," addressed "the civil,
indigenous, worker, rural worker, religious and non-party
organizations and civil society," in "an act for the transition to
democracy."
   The video was released to coincide with the second anniversary
of the Zapatista uprising two years ago yesterday.
   Political analyst Maria Luz Casal, from the Independent National
University, told IPS that the rebel declaration would mean the
renovation of the Zapatista's political arm the Zapatista National
Liberation Front (FZLN).
   "What has, until today, been the institutional role of the
National Democratic Convention (CND), which was made up of two
assemblies with 6,000 representatives in the insurgent zone, will
now go over to the FZLN," she said.
   The CND had been criticized by the insurgents for its internal
divisions and squabbles, along with its inability to manage mass
mobilizations.
   The CND brought together the smallest left-wing groups along
with the "Church of the poor" and the radical wing of the
Revolutionary Democratic Party (PRD) - a group which won 17 per
cent of the national vote in 1994.
   It also included representatives of indigenous, human
rights,feminist and environmental non-government groups, along with
independent sympathizers.
   Casal said, "the social base will not change when the FZLN
substitutes the CND but they will try and minimize the role of the
preexisting political organizations and strengthen the
organizational function of the rebel leadership."
   Christian Ahuerma of the Workers Movement Studies Center said
the guerrilla declaration "is a new political gesture to indicate
that they are prepared to maintain the situation of detente and
look for new institutional solutions."
   "In fact," he said, "the Zapatistas have been more a political
than military force since they began, though they were
spectacularly catapulted onto the scene in a guerrilla outburst.
   Ever since they came into the public eye on Jan. 1, 1994, in the
southern Mexican state of Chiapas, the Zapatistas had been calling
for a democratic national front.
   After two months of military confrontations in the conflict
zone, the guerrilla and the government agreed to a ceasefire and
an armed truce which led to an arduously slow peace process, still
underway.
   Yesterday's declaration, dubbed the "Fourth Declaration from the
Lacandona Jungle," called for a "peaceful, civil, independent and
democratic, national Mexican organization."
   The FZLN will be part of the year-old National Liberation
Movement (MLN), defined as "a broad opposition force," which
recently established its first principles and plans of action.
   The FZLN "will not be a political party, because it will not
fight to take power, but a civil political force in opposition the
State party system."
   The Zapatistas particularly object to the ruling Institutional
Revolutionary Party (PRI), which has been in power since 1929 and
has suffered a series of scandals in the last year.
   The rebels see the government attitude as "prepotent, racist and
humiliating," and have called for former president Carlos Salinas
to be tried for "treason to the nation."
   They criticized the "defrauding of popular will, the imposition
of the neoliberal model which has plunged the population into
poverty and desperation, the sale of the nation to foreigners and
the close links with narcotraffic."
   The proposal for a political front was established by popular
vote in September when some 300,000 people voted in the "National
poll for peace and democracy" organized by non-governmental groups.
   One of its first actions will be to arrange an "intercontinental
summit against neoliberalism," among the Zapatistas' international
supporters and sympathizers.

JAMAICA-TOURISM:  WINTER SEASON GETS OFF TO BAD START

By Corinne Barnes
   KINGSTON, Jan. 2 (IPS) -- It has been only three weeks since the
winter tourist season began but already hoteliers here are wringing
their hands in despair.
   Smaller hotels are on the verge of closing their doors unable
to compete with the might and efficiency of the larger
all-inclusive resorts.
   But the landscape is not bright for all-inclusives either. They
had to offer discounted rates in order to attract the tourist
dollar as competition among the islands in the region becomes more
intense.
   For Jamaica, the winter tourist season means valuable foreign
exchange needed to service external debts and pay the country's
high import bill. Tourism earns this northern Caribbean island some
one billion U.S. dollars each year.
   "Business is bad," says Gale Elmore, owner of a 17-room hotel
in the country's northcoast resort town of Montego Bay.
   Elmore's 40 year old Richmond Hill Hotel is struggling this
season.
   So far this season while all-inclusives are registering
occupancy levels over 70 per cent, the smaller, more intimate
facilities have bookings of 25 per cent.
   One hotel has reported that only four of its 24 rooms are
currently occupied.
   "I have no projections to March, nothing confirmed," says
Anthony Thompson, general manager of the Carib Isle hotel in
Runaway Bay on the north coast.
   "(Business) has not got any better in 15 years," says Thompson.
"Maybe we should really close our doors."
   The non-all inclusive hoteliers complain that they have not been
able to carry out the necessary renovations and advertise their
product effectively to meet this year's winter season as they were
unable to borrow money as interest on loans are becoming
unbearable.
   Interest on loans now stand in the region of 47 per cent.
   President of the Jamaica Hotel and Tourist Association (JHTA)
Lionel Reid who was optimistic at the start of the season says he
is also concerned that unless the situation changes these smaller
hotels may be forced out of business.
   "They (small hoteliers) are operating on bank borrowings and are
now at the wall," he says.
   Reid says it is impossible for these hotels to remain viable
when room rates being charged are what obtained 20 years ago.
   As for Elmore, in order to keep her business open she has had
to strike a deal with the all-inclusive hotels in the area to allow
their guests to eat at her hotel.
   Reid says the situation now existing in the tourism industry is
of concern to the wider population as the ripple effect will be
felt throughout the entire economy.
   If the small hotels are forced to fold, laid off workers are
likely to add to the unemployment level which is hovering at 15
per cent.
   The list of those affected is a long one and includes small
farmers who supply fresh fruits and vegetables to these hotels, and
restaurants and vendors who depend on the non all-inclusive hotel
trade.
   But the fight is not only between the small hotels and the
all-inclusive. Intra-regionally, each island is struggling to fend
off the determined challenge mounted by its neighbors.
   Jamaica, with its high crime rate (779 persons were murdered
last year), is being bypassed by tourists for other islands
perceived as unspoiled and safer.
   The public relations department at the Jamaica Tourist Board
says countries such as the Cayman Islands and Aruba which did not
have a presence in the market three years ago have increased their
profiles through lavish advertising.
   And Cuba which was not considered a serious competitor up to two
years ago has been pumping millions of dollars into its tourism
industry and is expected to lure many visitors to its shores this
year.
   Between January and September 1995, some 68,000 tourists visited
Jamaica. In 1994 the figure stood at 1.5 million, earning some $915
million although projections for that year had been for 1.7 million
with net earnings of $1.1 billion.

BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA:  SERB SEIZURES TEST NATO'S PEACEKEEPING ROLE

By Jim Clark
   SARAJEVO, Jan. 2 (IPS) -- NATO appeared to be in danger of
failing its first major test of effectiveness in holding the
fragile peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina, as concern grew for the safety
of a group of Bosnian Muslim civilians seized in a Serb-held suburb
of Sarajevo.
   The incident also showed up a potential gap between the
responsibilities of NATO's heavily armed forces and a putative
U.N.-led independent police force in the country. Both forces are
being deployed in the country under the terms of the Dayton Accord
supposed to herald a permanent settlement to the conflict.
   The Bosnian Serbs still control the western districts of
Sarajevo, from where they bombarded the city during the 44 month
war, but which must be handed over to the control of the Muslim-led
Bosnian government. The ten all disappeared yesterday in the suburb
of Ilidza, where opposition to the Dayton pact is strongest.
   Bosnian civilians started to use the main roads out of the city
through the suburbs after members of the 60,000-strong NATO
implementation force (IFOR) removed Serb checkpoints on the
roadways. The seizures stopped the movements.
   "We can confirm that 10 people are missing and we are pressing
the Bosnian Serb authorities to confirm their present location,"
said Colonel Vladimir Ribnikov, chief of the U.N. civilian police
force soon to deploy in Sarajevo.
   Bosnian government minister Hasan Muratovic said the U.N.
figures did not include four others seized yesterday by "Serb
terrorists" on the road from Kiseljak through Ilidza to Sarajevo.
   IFOR officers said they were concerned about the report but said
the responsibility for their safety was a matter for the civilian
authorities.
   NATO is limiting itself to implementing military aspects of the
agreement and plans to leave routine policing to an international
police force intended to tackle civilian problems. The force is yet
to be deployed, and will be under the direction of the High
Representative for Bosnia-Herzegovina, former Swedish prime
minister and European Union peace envoy Carl Bildt.
   But who should be responsible when paramilitary forces commit
criminal acts, such as the weekend seizures, has not been defined
as international efforts to grapple with the political aspects of
the accord fall behind schedule.
   NATO officers conceded that they are supposed to ensure freedom
of movement, but still did not consider the activities of
paramilitary groups seizing travellers moving about the city as
their responsibility.
   "We are not a police force, we are not mandated to take police
action," British IFOR spokesman Brigadier Andrew Cumming told a
news briefing in the rebel Bosnian Serb headquarters in Pale.
   He attempted to play down the significance of the incidents,
describing today as "another extraordinarily quiet day" in the
(IFOR) theatre of operations. "The parties are continuing to
demonstrate great cooperation and willingness to achieve the goals
of the Dayton agreement," he added.
   The Bosnian Serbs, along with the Muslim-led government promised
to allow full freedom of movement to all citizens throughout Bosnia
when they signed the Dayton peace accord in Paris last month.
   Muratovic told Bosnian TV that an appeal for the unconditional
release of the detained had been issued at a meeting attended by
Serb, government and IFOR officials.
   U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry said the former combatants
had not yet learnt how to deal with each other face to face. "They
have not yet been confronted with dealing with each other. That's
still ahead of them," Perry said at an Italian airbase as he
prepared for a tour of new U.S. encampments in Bosnia-Herzegovina.
   Yet this kind of face to face confrontation is expected to
increase in frequency, especially as members of different
communities try to return to their homes in areas controlled by
former enemies, as specifically guaranteed by the Dayton accord.
   The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) today kicked
off their program of refugee return by announcing a top-level
meeting of 40 countries designed to marshal support and assistance
for a massive two-year scheme to see the first of 1.3 million
displaced persons back home in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Nearly two
million more have sought refuge in neighboring Croatia, Serbia and
other European countries.
   In theory, IFOR is supposed to ensure that the returns can be
organized in peace, and the U.N. police force is supposed to ensure
general order while they are carried out. IFOR will not step in
unless there is a military threat to civilians.
   An IFOR media briefing in Sarajevo was told yesterday that "the
essence of the IFOR commitment to this theatre, is to wrest
authority away from military, and into the hands of the civilian
authorities."
   However NATO briefing papers say the IFOR mission will "help to
create a secure environment" which includes "assisting in the
observation and prevention of interference with the movement of
civilian populations, refugees and displaced persons."
   The U.N. Security Council approved a U.N. civilian police force
for Bosnia-Herzegovina last month. The 1,700 strong unit of
civilian police officers from around the U.N. member nations will
be responsible for the control and recruitment of local police and
providing them with operational assistance.
   Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali has said the force will
cost about $90 million in the first six months, will to him but
will "subject to the coordination and guidance" of Bildt.
   Bosnian Foreign Minister Mohammed Sacirbey told a press
conference in Brussels last month that his government was working
out a detailed plan with IFOR for the policing of the Serb suburbs
of Sarajevo.
   "The Bosnian government wants to do all it can to reassure the
people in these areas," he said. "There will be joint police
patrols with the United Nations. There have always been Serbs,
Croats and others, as well as Muslims, in our police force.
   "But," he added, "we have agreed to increase the proportion of
Serbs to 30 per cent or more of the entire police force." It is
expected to be months before this combined force is effectively
operating.
   Until then the informal arrangements must continue, even though
they are already failing in Sarajevo.
   "IFOR was too quick to decide that security was satisfactory,"
said Amir Hafdziomergaic, Muratovic's deputy. "Acts of Serb
terrorism are not going to stop implementation of the Dayton peace
accords, but they risk undermining the conditions in which it takes
place."
   Muratovic said he may order Bosnian police to stop civilians
using the roads unless escorted by IFOR troops. There are no plans
for IFOR convoys to see Sarajevans safely about their own city, as
were sometimes run by the U.N. during the war.

SRI LANKA:  CONSERVATIONISTS BATTLE ECO-TOURISM

By Rita Sebastian
   COLOMBO, Jan. 2 (IPS) -- An unsuspecting deer nibbles at a
plastic bag caught on a prickly bush in Horton Plains, a
picturesque reserve in Sri Lanka's central hills.
   The animal does not know that it is flirting with death. The
non-biodegradable plastic could choke its intestine, leading to a
painful death.
   Jagath Gunewardene of the non-governmental Environmental
Foundation blames the government policy of promotion of eco-tourism
in Sri Lanka for the new problems that park officials are being
forced to contend with. At all times of the year, Horton Plains is
swarming with tourists both local and foreign.
   Dismissing them as nothing but "pleasure seekers," he says that
90 per cent of visitors to the park and similar sanctuaries in Sri
Lanka are insensitive and out to destroy what they have travelled
from far and near to see.
   The authorities have laid down strict rules to prevent visitors
from disturbing the plant and animal life in the park. Photography
at close range is prohibited, but that has not stopped tourists
from hounding the deer for a good shot.
   And by the time the last day tripper goes home, the nature
reserve is littered with the remains of lunch and empty packets of
potato crisps and soft drink bottles.
   Conservationists say Horton Plains was created to preserve a
part of Sri Lanka's tropical beauty for future generations, but the
authorities did not fully take into account man's carelessness and
ability to destroy.
   "There has to be proper policing of tourists and their numbers
must be limited," says Deepthinka Kankanige of the Colombo-based
Society for Environmental Education. On an average some 60 people
visit the park, but even that has been found too many for the staff
whose main job is to safeguard the park.
   About 100 kilometers east of Colombo is Adam's Peak, a mountain
top that is venerated by Sri Lanka's Buddhist people, drawing
millions of devotees on a yearly pilgrimage. Many foreign tourists
to Sri Lanka also scale the peak to catch spectacular views of the
sunrise and the distant blue of the Indian Ocean.
   But the beauty of Adam's Peak may be its ruin. Unregulated camp
sites have sprung up in the wilderness and trees are being stripped
for firewood for bonfires, which are a constant threat specially
during the dry season.
   Kankanige says policing by Forest Department officials would
help, but it is imperative tourist officials educate visitors.
   Buses and private cars reaching Horton's Plain are beset by
souvenir sellers. While a lot of what is sold is bric-a-brac, rare
and endemic fauna and flora from the park are also being peddled
by enterprising locals.
   Knowledgeable buyers to eco-tourism destinations in Sri Lanka
can pick up rare species of plants, fish, butterflies and beetles,
Gunewardene confirms. The poaching by locals if unchecked could
seriously endanger wildlife species, he adds.
   Tourism officials in Colombo can only see the money eco-tourism
is bringing in. "Wildlife sanctuaries, nature reserves and
waterfalls are a great tourist attraction," an official of the
Tourist Board says.
   Asked if officials were taking adequate safeguards to protect
the areas from mass tourism, he admits that not enough has been
done but the authorities are aware of the importance of maintaining
the ecological balance.
   A firm critic of the government's promotion of eco-tourism is
Dr. Ranjan Fernando, president of the Wildlife and Nature
Protection Society. He feels the authorities are unwisely
exploiting the natural resource.
   "The way the idea is being promoted in this country seems to be
merely exploiting the natural resources of the island," he
underlines.
   Fernando cites the promotion of tourism in the catchment areas
of reservoirs as evidence of official shortsightedness. The
catchment areas are protected under Sri Lanka's Fauna and Flora
Protection Act, but officials have thrown them open to tourists.
   The government is motivated by short term interests in its
promotion of tourism, he thinks. Foreigners may bring in precious
foreign exchange now, but tourism in the long term will destroy the
environmental balance, he believes.
   "Tourism will disturb the ecological balance, which will take
thousands of years to heal," he states.
   In his opinion, eco-tourism is a contradictory concept and time
and again it has been shown that tourism is geared to changing the
natural way of life.
   But officials in Colombo think otherwise. They think eco-tourism
will attract discerning visitors who are sensitive to nature and
its importance in the cycle of life.
   Eco-tourists are not looking for just the sun, sea and the sand,
a Tourist Board official here said. Sri Lanka has earned notoriety
as a destination for pedophiles. An influx of foreign tourists to
Sri Lanka's famed beaches, mostly from the west, has been seen as
the main reason for the spread of the Aids virus among the local
population.

CHINA-ENERGY:  WIND HELPS POWER BOOMING ECONOMY

By Gao Fengfeng
   BEIJING, Jan. 2 (IPS) -- China, whose coal-fired power plants
have sent pollution levels soaring, has turned to a cleaner
alternative to help fuel its flourishing economy: wind energy.
   The use of this environment-friendly and renewable energy in
China has already passed from the experimental stage to far-ranging
application, especially in the grasslands for nomadic herdsmen and
some remote areas beyond the reach of the national power grid.
   The country now has 130,000 small and medium-size wind-driven
generators with a capacity of 17,000 kilowatts. More than 30
factories produce 100-200 watt generators nationwide. Three
quarters of these small generators are installed in the Inner
Mongolia grasslands.
   Wind-driven generators enable people in remote areas to use
electric lamps, television sets, radios and other modern
facilities. Since wind power became available, more students from
backward regions are said to have gone to university to receive
higher education.
   For larger application of wind power, there are 14 wind power
stations in China. They are equipped with 99 generators with a
total capacity of 14,600 kilowatts.
   The country's wind power application is concentrated mainly in
the provinces of Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia, Guangdong, Liaoning and
Fujian.
   As China has not yet mastered the modern technology of
manufacturing large wind-driven generators it has to import them,
mainly from Denmark, Germany, the United States, Belgium and
Sweden.
   Officials say wind power will play an important role in China's
effort to redistribute power across the country.
   There are about 120 million Chinese who still have no access to
electricity. Most of them live in the remote mountainous or
pastoral regions where the installation of wind-driven generators
will be less expensive than the extension of long-distance power
transmission lines from major power plants.
   The Chinese power industry is currently dominated by coal-fired
power plants, which are blamed for much of the smog that hovers
over the country's industrial regions.
   "China's coal reserve is largely distributed in the west, while
most of giant power plants are located in the more prosperous
east," says Yin Lian, a senior energy ministry official.
   About one-fifth of railway freight volume is devoted to coal
consumed by thermal power generators. This puts a heavy burden on
the already clogged national rail transport system.
   In this context, it makes both economic and ecological sense to
develop wind power in China. "As wind power demands less investment
and has far more flexibility in operation, it suits China
particularly well," says Yin.
   And China claims a rich wind power reserve of about 253 million
kilowatts which can be harnessed, according to long-range
investigations conducted by meteorological experts.
   Although the annual output of wind power still makes up only a
tiny portion of the country's total electricity output, the energy
ministry has worked out an ambitious plan that will enhance the
total capacity of wind-driven generators in China to one million
kilowatts by the end of the century.
   To meet this goal, the state has approved a provisional
regulation to give a more favorable price on wind power to the
consumers. And energy officials say the government is considering
a reduction of value-added tax, income tax, and import tariff in
the case of buying facilities from abroad.
   "The rapid development of wind power cannot succeed without
support from government, and it is particularly the case as wind
power traditionally drew far less attention than conventional power
sources," says Yin.
   China hopes to raise public awareness of the importance of this
form of energy by hosting an international conference in Beijing
in May. Local and foreign experts will discuss ways to give China's
fledgling wind power industry a further push.
   China mainly imports giant and middle-size wind-driven
generators ranging from 200 to 500 kilowatts. The conference is
expected to help China cut production cost and introduce technology
to produce its own generators.
   Denmark tops the list of donors in this field, supplying 13 sets
of 150 kilowatt wind-driven generators and one 100 kilowatt
generator for the Dabancheng wind power station in Xinjiang.
   In 1994 it provided loans worth $16 million for building four
wind power projects in Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia, Dalian in
Liaoning, and Guangdong. Up to now, China has made use of a total
of $26 million worth of loans from the Danish government.
   "We welcome and encourage foreign funds to flow into China in
this regard, as China claims a great potential in developing wind
power," says Yin, adding that the country's target for overall use
of wind power is set for eight million kilowatts by 2020.

ANGOLA-POLITICS:  BRINKMANSHIP CONTINUES

By Chris Simpson
   LUANDA, Jan. 2 (IPS) -- U.N. Special Representative Alioune
Blondin Beye says this should be Angola's year of "definitive
peace" following steady consolidation seen in 1995.
   But Beye is almost alone in his optimism. Even the Christmas
period in Angola was dominated by fresh allegations of offensives
and stiff warnings from both sides, while mediators struggled to
keep things in perspective.
   The U.N., with some 6,200 blue helmets in Angola to monitor
military demobilization under a year-old peace agreement, had been
hoping for a rapid post-Christmas breakthrough.
   Visits by government officials and Beye to the Bailundo
headquarters of the opposition Union for the Total Liberation of
Angola on Dec. 21 and Dec. 23 respectively, were meant to pave the
way for a resumption of military talks between the government and
UNITA and a summit with President Jose Eduardo dos Santos and
opposition leader Jonas Savimbi early in the New Year.
   Beye took to the airwaves on Dec. 27 to give a generally upbeat
resume on the peace process to date. He warned, however, that any
ceasefire violations at this stage were unacceptable. He reserved
particular criticism for the media, warning that "hostile
propaganda" was continuing to sour the atmosphere.
   Ironically, Beye's criticisms coincided with a fresh outburst
of allegations from UNITA's radio station, Vorgan, whose "northern
correspondent," Felix Miranda, alleged that a major government
offensive in the province of Uige had killed 40 people. Quoting
local UNITA commanders, Miranda claimed heavy artillery and tanks
had been deployed by the government.
   As envoys from Russia, Portugal and the United States arrived
in Bailundo the same day for what was meant to have been a routine
meeting with UNITA, they were immediately confronted with news of
renewed fighting.
   Vorgan's accusations were later strongly backed by UNITA's
secretary-general, Paulo Lukamba Gato, in interviews with the BBC
and Voice of America. Gato stressed that the government's actions
ruled out any prompt resumption of military talks given the lack
of a "climate of confidence."
   Vorgan repeated the allegations, claiming that government troops
had massacred civilians in areas it had occupied. But UNITA's
claims were firmly denied by government spokesman Gen. Higino
Carneiro. Interviewed on local radio on Dec. 28, Carneiro accused
UNITA of indulging in cheap propaganda, adding that all UNITA's
current concerns were meant to have been addressed at the meeting
with the government in Bailundo a week earlier.
   Subsequent visits by Beye and U.S. ambassador Donald Steinberg
to the central highlands town of Bailundo on Dec. 28 and 29 were
aimed at winning UNITA over. They both met with Savimbi who had
been absent from the previous round of meetings.
   Meanwhile, a Joint Commission delegation, including military
representatives from the government and UNITA, travelled to Uige
on Dec. 29 to investigate the movement's allegations.
   The delegation has yet to publicize its findings, but U.N. and
diplomatic sources have hinted that UNITA's version of events is
greatly exaggerated and that UNITA is simply looking for another
pretext to stay away from military talks with the government and
keep its troops out of the quartering areas.
   UNITA's latest allegations have focused on the region of
Quitexe, 50 kilometers southwest of UNITA's northern stronghold of
Negage in the province of Uige. While the government holds the
provincial capital of Uige, UNITA controls most of the rest of the
province, including the frontier with Zaire.
   Uige has been tense throughout the peace process, despite U.N.
efforts to improve free movement between government and UNITA
areas. Sporadic clashes have been reported in the north, while the
civilian population has complained of harassment by the armies of
both sides.
   The United Nations is hoping to convene a new Joint Commission
meeting as soon as possible. But as of Jan. 2, UNITA's
representative in Luanda was still in Bailundo, with no word yet
from the movement on the resumption of the military talks, which
have experienced a series of interruptions over the past few
months.
   According to diplomatic sources in contact with UNITA, the
current problems should not be overstated. "UNITA is still in
problem-resolving mode," IPS was told. "But UNITA is worried about
the current crisis of confidence."
   The government however is likely to react very critically to
further delays. In an explicit warning to UNITA, a senior military
source in Luanda warned recently that the current rate of progress
was unacceptable.
   "It has gone extremely slowly. The only positive development so
far has been the deployment of U.N. forces and the construction of
the quartering areas."
   The same source accused UNITA of carrying out military actions
countrywide, of continuing recruitment campaigns and rearming. "We
have more information than anyone else and we are always asking
ourselves 'What is the reason for this behavior'?" he said.
   The government military is still denying having used mercenaries
at any stage, stressing that the South African security firm
Executive Outcomes fulfilled the kind of training role also
performed by Portuguese instructors under the terms of the Bicesse
peace accords of 1991, a peace agreement overturned when UNITA
returned to war a year later.
   Military sources have also emphasized that "absolutely nothing"
has happened in Uige, beyond a routine confrontation between two
rival patrol groups. The government maintains that its actions in
Zaire province in November and December were a legitimate response
to persistent provocation by UNITA.
   Looking forwards, senior generals remain publicly committed to
the Lusaka Protocol, the peace agreement signed in November 1994,
but accept major disagreements persist, particularly on the issue
of a new national army.
   The Bicesse accords provided for 20,000 UNITA troops in a
unified army. Some 2,500 came in and stayed in, leaving places for
only 17,500 more, many less than UNITA now wants. Government
proposals for a "social reconstruction" wing focussing on
rehabilitation and public works has met with little support from
UNITA, although it could provide employment for thousands more
soldiers.
   In his New Year's address to the nation, dos Santos called for
greater diplomatic pressure on UNITA to force compliance with the
Lusaka protocol. There has been no explicit warning yet of what
military action might be taken if UNITA does not show more
cooperation.

IRAQ-SANCTIONS:  MIXED SIGNALS CONFUSE SANCTIONS RENEWAL ISSUE

Analysis by Dilip Hiro
   LONDON, Jan. 2 (IPS) -- The United Nations Security Council's
routine 60-day renewal of sanctions against Iraq grows steadily
more problematic. The next reimposition, due on Jan. 8, must now
take account of mixed signals on the subject coming from the
region.
   A communique issued on Dec. 6 at the end of the six member Gulf
Cooperation Council (GCC) summit in Muscat, Oman, backed
continuation of the embargo until Iraq complied with all Security
Council resolutions on the Gulf War. But some of the Gulf states
are in flexible mood.
   Qatari ruler Sheikh Hamad ibn Khalif al-Thani, who pointedly did
not attend the summit closing ceremony, had brought to the GCC a
message of reconciliation from Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
   And in October, United Arab Emirates President Sheikh Zaid ibn
al-Nahayan publicly called for a relaxation of the embargo against
Iraq. The ruler of Oman, Sultan Qaboos ibn-Said, was also reported
to be favoring mending fences with Baghdad.
   King Fahd of Saudi Arabia and Sheikh Jaber ibn Ahmad al-Sabah
of Kuwait, the countries most affected by Saddam's disastrous
invasion and rapid defeat in 1990/1991, predictably remained
staunchly opposed to any relaxation of the sanctions against Iraq.
Firmly behind them was the United States. The three prevailed.
   However there are some signs of a split within the Saudi ruling
establishment. Following his meeting with Egyptian president Hosni
Mubarak in Cairo on Dec. 14, Prince Khalid ibn Sultan al-Saud, the
joint coalition commander during the 1991 Gulf War, declared that
the U.N. sanctions had strengthened rather than weakened the Iraqi
regime, and needed to be eased.
   Signals coming from Amman are equally mixed. In this instance
Jordan is uniquely placed. It is the only one of Iraq's neighbors
allowed by the U.N. Security Council to have limited economic
relations with Baghdad. It is permitted to import 67,000 barrels
of oil per day from Iraq, which the latter sells at a discount
price and supplies by truck. The Iraqi government uses the income
to buy food and medicine for its citizens.
   In mid-December a Jordanian delegation visited Baghdad to
negotiate an increase in supplies of oil for 1996. Though the Saudi
monarch has by now forgiven King Hussein of Jordan for not joining
the Gulf War against Iraq and has mended fences with Amman, he has
yet to offer oil supplies to Jordan.
   But while the Jordanian king is unable to end his country's
dependence on Iraqi petroleum, he has recently taken to shoring up
the exiled opposition leaders of Iraq. In December he addressed
them at a meeting in Amman.
   He proposed a federal set-up in Iraq which, in his view, would
satisfy the three main groups in the country: Kurds, Shias and
Sunnis. Since there are no clear geographical lines that divide
Sunni Muslims from Shia Muslims, the idea has been a non-starter.
   What lies behind this move by King Hussein? Pressure by the
United States. Having repeatedly failed to see Saddam overthrown
by his own people, Washington has now seemingly opted for a fairly
long-term strategy of toppling his regime through a combination of
economic and political measures.
   Since Jordan is the only overland gateway into and from Iraq,
a country cut off from foreign air links, it has a key role to play
if the U.S. plan is to succeed. And given Jordan's economic and
diplomatic dependence on Washington, it is imperative that its
monarch must be seen to be doing something on this front.
   Nonetheless, Saddam is taking King Hussein's move seriously.
Just after Christmas Baghdad announced that Iraq's direct
international telephone links are being cut on the ground that it
does not have enough foreign exchange to pay the bills.
   Baghdad has also reduced the duration of its exit visa from 12
months to one month, thus restricting further foreign travel for
Iraqi citizens.
   And Saddam launched a new austerity campaign on Dec. 31 to halt
the decline of the Iraqi currency. He called for tax increases and
a cut in the amount of bank notes in circulation. The dinar has
plunged to 2,500 against the dollar on the black market, against
an official rate of one dinar to $3.20.
   As for the U.N. sanctions, Iraq's state-run newspapers yesterday
exuded confidence. Al-Thawra, the daily paper of the ruling Baath
party, as quoted by the state-run Iraqi News Agency, said sanctions
would be lifted in 1996 thanks to "friends and brothers" who were
aware of what it called Iraq's "real commitment" to U.N. Security
Council resolutions.
   In this decision the final report of the U.N.'s chief inspector
in Iraq, Rolf Ekeus, will carry great weight. Just before
Christmas, Ekeus revealed that, tipped off by the Iraqi government,
his inspectors had salvaged some crates from the Tigris river in
Baghdad.
   These contained gyroscopes for long range ballistic missiles,
which are banned by the Security Council Resolution 687 of April
1991. A preliminary study showed that the crates had been under
water for about three months.
   The Iraqi government's explanation was it had caught an
individual who had brought these machines into the country and when
he could not ship them out of Iraq he decided to dump the crates
into the Tigris. Ekeus is investigating the matter, and it will be
some weeks before he reaches a conclusion.
   The U.N. has offered to allow Iraq to sell a limited quantity
of oil to pay for medicine and humanitarian supplies, but Baghdad
refuses, saying U.N. conditions infringe on its sovereignty. Oil
exports used to account for 90 per cent of Iraq's foreign revenues.
   Ekeus's final report on Iraq's demolition of its weapons of mass
destruction and long range missiles is unlikely to materialize
before the Security Council review of the sanctions by Jan. 8. The
chances are they will be renewed for another 60 days.
   Thus the major losers in this 65 months old saga remain the
Iraqi population, who are suffering untold economic hardships,
widely expected to culminate in a famine in the spring.
   The average monthly wage is just 5,000 dinars, equivalent to two
dollars and inadequate to cope with prices. Currently Iraqis pay
up to 60 dinars for bread, 1,200 dinars for a kilo of flour, and
5,000 dinars for a kilo of meat. Most now survive on state rations.

ENVIRONMENT/LITHUANIA:  NUCLEAR PLANT SAFETY RECORD WORRIES MANY

By Edvinas Butkus
   VILNIUS, Jan. 2 (IPS) -- Even its senior management regards
Lithuania's troubled Ignalina nuclear plant as being at risk of
suffering a serious technical breakdown with potentially lethal
consequences.
   "Despite the complexity of reactor technology, in the Ignalina
atomic power plant certain tasks are carried out with very
primitive means," admits Dr. Povilas Vaisnys, director of the
Lithuanian state atomic energy security inspectorate (VATESI).
   The reactors at Ignalina, 130 kilometers northeast of the
capital Vilnius, are of the same RBMK design as those used at the
Chernobyl plant in Ukraine, site of the world's worst nuclear
accident in 1986. It produces 80 per cent of Lithuania's
electricity.
   The plant is scheduled for closure by 2010 when alternative
power sources must be in place. Yet despite extensive safety
improvements at the plant, funded in part by the European Union and
the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), a
series of accidents at the plant in late 1995 raised new concerns.
   In the last incident, staff were routinely calibrating devices
to measure electron flow on Nov. 30, when engineer Vladimir Rusinov
from the plant's atomic security center was forced against
regulations to enter an irradiated area when the measuring device
failed to fit through its regular aperture.
   Rusinov was said to have suffered no serious aftereffects. "Such
a level of radiation does not cause any reaction in the human
organism and has no practical effects which can be measured by the
modern medical devices at our disposal," Vaisnys said.
   On Nov. 22, 12 tons of water from the pressurized tanks of the
emergency core cooling system were accidentally released. Although
emergency steps were taken at the time, the reactor was shut down
the next day after an automatic safety system failed.
   Eleven days prior to that leak, there was a small fire in the
machine room of Unit 1 after a pipe in the hydraulic system
cracked, also leading to a 24-hour reactor shut-down.
   In August, two cranes became entangled during refueling at Unit
2, and several days later a spent 150 kilogram fuel rod broke while
being lowered into the cooling pond and sank to the bottom. Earlier
in August staff had to leave the reactor hall while a damaged fuel
element was removed from the core. No radiation was leaked into the
atmosphere in any of the incidents.
   But this series of minor accidents has impelled Vilius
Kazanavicius, former deputy prime minister of Soviet Lithuania, to
voice his concern that minor accidents now may lead to major ones
later.
   In an article for a national daily at the beginning of December,
Kaanavicius said the plant was still dependent on Russian-speaking
and trained Russian migrant staff.
   He said that in five years since independence from the Soviet
Union, Lithuania had not trained new staff for the plant, which is
run now as it was when it opened by Russian engineers. Most of the
3,300 staff at the plant are Russian.
   "The Ignalina plant is ours, but it is run by others," said
Kazanavicius. He saw another danger if the Russian staff had to
leave the plant. He proposed that the plant be closed down as soon
as possible.
   There is also the danger that emergency procedures might not be
able to counter deliberate sabotage bids. In November 1994,
Lithuanian Kestutis Mazuika threatened to bomb the plant in the
name of a fictitious terrorist group, NUC-41 W, unless the Swedish
government paid him $8 million. He was arrested and jailed when he
turned up to collect the money.
   A range of projects to improve safety at Ignalina have been
completed or are still under way, including a 33 million ECU
program funded by the EBRD. The plant is 200 kilometers from Minsk,
500 from Warsaw, and 660 from Moscow or Stockholm.
   Ignalina itself contributed the equivalent of a further $5
million a year to the program, and aid has also been promised by
Sweden, Canada, Japan and the United States. The total being spent
on safety improvements at the site is now around $100 million.
   The managers of the plant are short of funds. They have even
tried to file a law suit against the national Lietuvos Energija
electricity company a few months ago to force the latter to pay
debts for energy already generated and sold. Last year's forced
suspension of two of the country's commercial banks has also held
up salary payments to plant staff.
   According to a U.S. Department of Energy's report on "Most
Dangerous Reactors", published this summer, Ignalina could be even
more dangerous than Chernobyl. Lithuania, however, denies this.
VATESI safety expert Alexander Aleyev told IPS last month that they
regarded the U.S. report technically inaccurate and out of date.
   Nevertheless Lithuania has set up a fund for the phased closure
and decommissioning of Ignalina by 2010 which it is estimated will
cost $600 million. Closure will not be easy and Deputy Power
Minister Saulius Kutas has said that Lithuania may consider
constructing a new nuclear plant to replace Ignalina, which has
allowed Lithuania to export power to Belarus and Russia.
   Under an agreement signed with the Russian state power company
Energiya, the Lithuanian State Power System is also exporting
electricity to Russia in return for supplies of nuclear fuel. The
total value of the contract, which ends on May 1, 1996, is
estimated at $60 million.

BURUNDI-HUMAN RIGHTS:  END TO CYCLE OF POLITICAL KILLINGS SOUGHT

By IPS Correspondents
   PARIS, Jan. 2 (IPS) -- More than 1,000 people are killed by
government forces or paramilitary groups each month in Burundi, but
the world continues to turn a blind eye to such atrocities, say
NGOs working in the strife-torn country.
   Most of those killed by the Tutsi-dominated security forces are
members of the Hutu ethnic group from which the majority political
party, Front for Democracy in Burundi (FRODEBU), of President
Sylvestre Ntibantunganya, draws its support.
   "FRODEBU demands that the international community intervene, in
whatever form it can, including military or economic," said a
spokesman for the party in Paris.
   Ntibantunganya appealed for an end to the unrest in a New Year's
Day radio broadcast yesterday. He said Burundi faced "total
collapse" unless the violence is stemmed and blamed "fanatics" from
the Hutu majority, Tutsi minority and the Army.
   "The new year must be a year in which all these phenomena are
swept away and defeated," said Ntibantunganya, speaking on state
radio monitored by the British Broadcasting Corporation.
   Over 100,000 people have been killed in Burundi since the
current civil conflict broke out in October 1993. More than 1,300
have been killed since the start of November 1995, but the
international community has persistently failed its victims by its
silence and inaction, Amnesty says.
   Amnesty believes that many more massacres have gone unreported
in the inaccessible provinces of Bubanza and Cibitoke where
fighting between government forces and rebels has intensified
during 1995. Most victims are unarmed women, children and the aged.
   "The government has shown itself incapable of preventing its
security forces from unlawfully killing unarmed civilians and
carrying out other human rights violations," said a spokesman for
the human rights NGO before the New Year holiday.
   "The first thing to do is to send the Army back to the
barracks," said the FRODEBU spokesman, "because it is the source
of instability in the country and made to respect the results of
the 1993 elections (which produced a Hutu president). Otherwise,
we are off to an interminable cycle of massacres and carnage."
   "It is a tragedy that the international community -- including
foreign diplomats and representatives of the U.N. and the
Organization of African Unity -- has become a powerless spectator,"
added Amnesty.
   In Paris Christian Raggioli, chief of operations in Burundi for
the French NGO Medecins du Monde said that they and other
humanitarian organizations have also been the target of attacks.
   The International Committee of the Red Cross and several other
aid agencies suspended their activities in Burundi last month. The
U.N. World Food Program said food distribution to the north and
northeast had been suspended again today.
   "Whether the armed people are bandits or para-military groups
of which side, we don't know," said Raggioli. "But we are worried
about the security of our volunteers." Some 150,000 Rwandan
refugees and 80,000 Burundians in Burundi depend on food aid.
   "Our objective is come to the aid of victims, whoever is the
aggressor," he said, but if their staff were prevented from
reaching victims, it would have to consider quitting the country.
"We won't endorse the massacres," he said. "Today, the situation
is almost untenable and it is possible that we will leave."
   But the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said today that the
violence appeared to be easing slightly. There were no reports of
violence over the weekend, spokesman Ron Redmond told reporters in
Geneva.
   Amnesty has been collecting data on recent attacks. They cited
an attack by government forces surrounding Gasarara in Kanyosha
district, Rural Bujumbura province, on Nov. 14 and killed at least
430 unarmed civilians, virtually all of them Hutu.
   The soldiers also looted property and set houses on fire. There
are reports that some civilians were lured to assemble in a school,
ostensibly for their own protection, and then shot or bayonetted
to death.
   In a letter to the provincial governor dated Nov. 20, the
Kanyosha district administrator said he had counted 421 dead: 40
men, 73 women, 165 boys and 143 girls. An inquiry carried out by
security officials reportedly established that at least 430 people
were killed, while other sources claim that at least 500 people
were extrajudicially executed and many others "disappeared." The
results of the inquiry have not been made public.
   "One must put an end to the impunity of killers." said the
FRODEBU spokesman. "As soon as those responsible are identified,
they must be tried.
   "The silence of the international community?" added Raggioli.
"Maybe they are waiting for more massacres. For them to react, they
are probably waiting for the killings to surpass those in Rwanda.
In Rwanda, the killings already had to come to such proportions
before the international community stirred."
   Nearly 300 unarmed civilians, most of them Hutu, were reportedly
killed by government forces Dec. 6-7 in the suburbs of the capital
Bujumbura. At least 270 of the victims were killed in the suburban
area of Sororezo Hill by soldiers using automatic weapons, rockets
and helicopter gunships.
   The killings took place in the wake of what the Burundi
authorities said were clashes between government forces and rebels
belonging to the Hutu-dominated, National Council for the Defense
of Democracy (CNDD).
   The CNDD has denied involvement in the attacks. Some of the
attacks by government forces appear to be a continuation of
attempts by the Tutsi-dominated security forces to rid Bujumbura
of its Hutu population.
   Hutu armed groups have also killed scores of Tutsi. For example,
an armed gang attacked Campazi camp for displaced members of the
Tutsi ethnic group in Muruta district, Kirundo province and killed
about 40. Some of the killings by Tutsi militia have also been
carried out with the support or connivance of the security forces.
   Further killings were reported in Kanyosha district on Nov. 26
when soldiers attacked a group of youths playing football at
Nyamaboko primary school.
   Some soldiers reportedly accused one youth from Rumonge of being
a member of a gang which sabotaged a power station in Rumonge. They
beat and then shot the youth dead. Other youths fled in panic and
were pursued by the soldiers. Soldiers then went on the rampage in
the area and killed as many as 500 people.
   Although most of the killings are carried out by government
troops, Burundi authorities complain that the Tutsi-led army is
being demonized, a Bujumbura-based observer told Amnesty
International.
   Hutu-dominated and Tutsi armed groups appear to be almost in
competition to see who can kill the most members of rival groups,
say Amnesty. On the nights of Nov. 1 and 2 at least four people
were shot dead and about 20 wounded by an armed gang in Buyenzi,
a suburb of Bujumbura, said Amnesty researchers.
   Prominent citizens continue to be targeted by members of the
security forces and armed groups. On Dec. 2 at least five Hutu were
taken away by soldiers in Mutanga-Nord suburb of Bujumbura.
   They included Elie Ndikumana, an official of the Ministry of
Public Works and Equipment, Dr. Gaspard Nzikobanyanka, Nestor
Katihabwa, a Burundi University student, Sylvestre Niyonzima and
a nightwatchman named Donatien. Their bodies and the body of
another person were found near Bujumbura airport several days
later.
   And during a counter-insurgency operation on Dec. 6-7 government
forces also attacked the homes of several Hutu officials, including
that of Augustin Nzojibwami, the Secretary General of FRODEBU,
Fabien Sagatwa, Secretary of State for Security, and Antoinette
Bazikwankana, a former presidency official.

CONGO-LABOR:  SALARY PAYMENTS A BIG SURPRISE FOR PUBLIC SERVANTS

By Nana Rosine Ngangoue
   BRAZZAVILLE, Jan. 2 (IPS) -- If you had gone a year without pay
and then got a windfall lump sum, how would you feel? Exuberant
say Congo's long-suffering but for now happy civil servants.
   Bar owners and shop keepers are also smiling as traffic jams in
downtown Brazzaville attest to the booming following the
government's payment in December of four months back pay owed to
public workers.
   "They treated us like beggars. We'd become beggars. Now I'm
happy that we got four months salary in the space of a month,"
rejoices Augustin Elenga, a journalist at the state-owned Congolese
Information Agency.
   Paid irregularly for nearly five years and not paid at all for
more than twelve months, civil servants were on the cutting-edge
of Congo's economic and political malaise.
   After multiparty polls in 1993 swept away an oppressive single
party system, this central African state's new government, led by
technocrat president Pascal Lissouba, claimed their predecessors
had drained the state's coffers and run up a foreign debt of $5
billion.
   Economic recovery was further hampered by ethnic-based political
conflict that pitted government supporters against the opposition,
killing 2,000 and displacing 20,000 other people at its height.
Congo, with a population of just 2.5 million, seemed irretrievably
lost to chaos.
   "We endured the toughest of Calvaries. We were no longer living,
we were surviving. When I think that my landlord evicted me and
that my children lost a year of schooling as we were unable to meet
the fees, I tell myself that I passed through a terrible time in
my life," recalls Kengue Cyr, a public servant.
   For many, however, hope has returned with the big pay envelope
and a commitment to the regularization of salaries by the
government, one of the aims of a new three-year structural
adjustment program (SAP) agreed to in December by the government
and the International Monetary Fund.
   There has also been a series of talks between the government and
opposition to ease the political crisis.
   Congo's adjustment program comprises several measures to
stimulate growth in a country where gross domestic product (GDP)
registered minus 4.6 per cent in 1994, and to increase employment.
From January, salaries and pensions of civil service are to be paid
on time.
   Economic recovery has also been shored up by new contracts
between the state and oil production firms, increasing the state's
stake in the sector. Official statistics reveal that in 1996 oil
is expected to bring in $315 million.
   The effect of the public servants windfall is evident throughout
the capital, with bars and other places of entertainment chock
full.
   "There's a mad crowd here today because of the money circulating
in the capital. Before, we couldn't expect so many people," says
one barman here.
   In people's homes there is also a tangible psychological relief.
   "You can't tell how much we've relaxed now. We've paid all our
debts, that's a great relief to me," says Honorine Samba, a
teacher's wife.
   But the sudden circulation of a great deal of money has also
triggered inflation. In the city's markets, vendors are marking up
prices and the cost of clothes in particular have soared.
   "If this goes on, we won't be able to manage. Vendors don't
realize that the money we've just been paid is to pay our debts,"
says Elenga, whose joy is tainted with apprehension about the
future.
   "It's true that I'm smiling, but this happiness is limited as
we're afraid they'll stop the payments and we'll be back at square
one," the journalist confides. "I hope that this good fortune
lasts, but above all that we're paid all the outstanding salaries."
   Prime Minister Jacques Joachim Yombi Opangault recently promised
that regular salaries were back to stay. How far the promise will
hold remains to be seen. Meanwhile, Brazzaville has once again
become a sociable and happy town.

NIGERIA-MEDIA:  ABIOLA'S NEWSPAPER BACK ON THE STREETS

By Toye Olori
   LAGOS, Jan. 2 (IPS) -- "You missed me because I was severely
Abachalized," explains a cartoon man in plaster on the back page
of the Concord, an independent newspaper which hit the streets
today after an 18-month ban.
   Owned by jailed Nigerian opposition politician Moshood Abiola,
who is widely believed to have won Nigeria's 1993 presidential
elections, the paper was shut down in August 1994 by Gen. Sani
Abacha.
   The Guardian and Punch, also privately-owned, were also closed
at the height of protests intended to force the military out of
power and bring about installation of Abiola, jailed on treason
charges after declaring himself president on the anniversary of the
annulled election.
   An unreserved apology to the head of state for any transgression
against either the government or the person of Abacha from the
paper's management brought the Guardian a reprieve in July 1995.
   "I hope unlike the Concord and Punch that the Guardian will show
genuine remorse and reciprocate the government's gesture of
goodwill," Abacha told the paper's management and members of the
Newspaper Proprietor's Association of Nigeria.
   But the Concord and Punch, among the largest circulation papers
before the ban, refused to give in and remained proscribed until
October 1995.
   Physical damage to its printing machines hampered the Concord's
resumption of operations, sources close to the newspaper say. But
its first issue back on the streets was as fearless and provocative
as ever.
   Today's lead story focused on democracy and the war between the
military government and the international community, while the back
page carried a six-column headline "Ogonis to Mourn Saro-Wiwa,
others" a reference to the recent execution of the minority rights
campaigner that triggered international outrage.
   The front page editorial announced: "We do not regard the
unbanning as a special favor to be reciprocated with a show of
remorse and contrition, but as a belated undoing of what should not
have been done in the first place."
   "If the Concord and other newspapers that were peremptorily
banned had breached the laws of the country, the authorities should
have prosecuted them in the law courts, unless they have no faith
in the judiciary," the editorial reads.
   The editorial thanked "all men and women of goodwill, at home
and abroad, whose appeals, according to General Sani Abacha, moved
him to lift the ban." But it notes that the appeals, however
well-intentioned, are ultimately subversive of the rule of law and
democracy.
   "They invest in persons to whom they are directed powers that
they do not posses and ought not to possess, powers that, in
effect, set them above the constitution," the editorial insists.
   The paper's tone has rekindled fears that it may be heading for
a fresh collision with Abacha's regime.
   "The Concord has to be tactical in its criticisms of this
government or it might incur the wrath of the military and its
security operatives as is happening to some opposition newspapers
now," says Biola Alagoa, a journalist.
   "If they (military government) cannot close the papers down
because of the negative impact it will have on their image, they
can at least burn their buildings and equipment down to prevent
them from publishing," Alagoa continues.
   This seems an oblique reference to the fires that gutted the
premises of the newly-opened Guardian two weeks ago and the News
Magazine on New Year's Eve.
   The finger has been pointed at security agents as both
publications were ardent critics of government. "This is the
beginning of new tactics to force opposition papers out of
circulation. It is government of thuggery," Alagoa alleged.
   Revealing that the fire at the News Magazine caused extensive
damage to vital documents, computers and other electronic
equipment, editor-in-chief Dapo Olorunyomi shares Alagoa's
suspicions.
   "Though nothing was stolen, put in the context of the Guardian
fire about two weeks ago, we suspect arson. Only our own floor was
burnt in the four-story building," Olorunyomi said.
   Tell, another combative privately-owned news magazine has also
repeatedly run afoul of the government. On Dec. 17, 55,000 copies
of the magazine were seized at the printers by security agents. Six
days later, another 50,000 copies were seized six days later
editor-in-chief Nosa Igiebor was arrested and detained.
   The Dec. 25 edition of the magazine was titled "Abiola's
Freedom: The World Waits for Abacha" while the New Year's Day
edition seized on Dec. 23 bore the title: "Abacha is Adamant;
Terrorizes the Opposition".
