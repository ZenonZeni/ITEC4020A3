<STRONG>NYLIAC's Variable Universal Life Insurance</STRONG> 
<P>




<STRONG>Protection Plus Investment Opportunity</STRONG><BR>
All life insurance offers financial protection.  And all permanent life insurance generates a
cash value
that you can use to finance personal goals.  But there's one thing most life insurance plans
don't offer:
choice in how your money is invested.  New York Life Insurance and Annuity Corporation
(NYLIAC)
offers a plan that does: Variable Universal Life (VUL).<SUP><FONT SIZE="-1"><A
HREF="#1">1</A></FONT></SUP>
<P>
Variable Universal Life puts you in control of your life insurance.  You can adjust your
payments to suit
your
changing needs. 
And you can even decide how your dollars will be invested - which means you have a say in how
your
money may grow.  Few traditional life insurance plans offer this kind of freedom.  With VUL,
you get both
the protection of life insurance and the potential for growth of investments.
<P>

<STRONG>Flexible Protection and Flexible Payments</STRONG><BR>
With NYLIAC's Variable Universal Life, you have the freedom to choose the amount of life
insurance
protection that best suits you.  As your needs change, you have the option of increasing or
decreasing
your coverage.<SUP><FONT SIZE="-1"><A
HREF="#2">2</A></FONT></SUP> You can also control the
amount and frequency of your payments.  For example, if you're looking to accumulate as much
as you
can for the future, you can make a lump-sum contribution or increase your payments.  That
extra money
can help increase the cash value of your policy, so when a personal or business opportunity
presents
itself, you'll have access to those funds.<SUP><FONT SIZE="-1"><A
HREF="#3">3</A></FONT></SUP>
Or if you need to temporarily cut back on your payments, you
may be able to pay less premium than usual and let the policy's accumulated cash value cover
the rest. 
Flexible payments let you make the choices.
<P>

<STRONG>Flexible Investment Features</STRONG><BR>
With Variable Universal Life, you control how your money works for you.  You can choose among
several
funding
options, including stock, bond, balanced, or money-market accounts.  There's also a Fixed
Account with
a minimum guaranteed rate of 4%.
<P>
By contributing at regular intervals through "dollar cost averaging," you may get a lower
overall cost on
the units in which you're investing, without having to time the financial markets.<SUP><FONT
SIZE="-1"><A HREF="#4">4</A></FONT></SUP> What's more, you're never locked into your
investment choices - you can change them.  You can also secure any gains you may make by
transferring them into the Cash Management portfolio or, on a limited basis, the Fixed
Account.<SUP><FONT SIZE="-1"><A HREF="#5">5</A></FONT></SUP>  Those earnings can then
remain there tax-deferred.  Whatever options you select, you control the investment choice.
<P>

<STRONG>Customized Policy Design</STRONG><BR>
You can customize Variable Universal Life to fit your lifestyle.  Ask your NYLIFE Securities
registered
representative how you can add different policy features that can help you provide financial
protection
for your spouse and children, keep the policy in force during disability, increase the
benefit if you die
accidentally, or tailor the plan to cover other needs.
<P>

<STRONG>Earnings That Grow Tax-Deferred</STRONG><BR>
Earnings on VUL grow tax-deferred and are re-invested, so your money may grow a lot faster
than it
would in a taxable investment.  And don't forget the benefits of compounding: earnings may
grow year
after year - tax-deferred - and this could magnify your ultimate return!

<P>
<STRONG>Reliable, Professional Management</STRONG><BR>
The professional fund managers at MacKay-Shields Financial Corporation Financial Corporation
and
Monitor Capital
Advisors, Inc. manage VUL's portfolio accounts.  Both are New York Life affiliates and are
premier
financial advisors with proven track records in investment management.  The Fixed Account is
managed by NYLIAC - and backed by this New York Life subsidiary's superior financial strength
and
stability.

<P>
<STRONG>At Your Service</STRONG><BR>
Your NYLIFE Securities registered representative is always ready to help you and answer any
questions. 
You can call a
toll-free number to transfer funds between accounts or get up-to-the-minute information about
your
policy. 
You'll also receive quarterly statements to give you a summary of your policy activity.

<P>

For more complete information, including charges and expenses, contact your NYLIFE Securities
registered
representative for a free
NYLIAC Variable Universal Life prospectus package. 
Read it carefully before you invest or send money. <P>

Neither New York Life nor the New York Life Insurance and Annuity Corporation guarantees the
investment
performance of the variable accounts, which will fluctuate with market conditions.
