</H2>
<BR>
* * * Babies born to mothers who use marijuana during <BR>
pregnancy have eleven times the risk of getting childhood leukemia. These
<BR>
children are the innocent victims of their parents marijuana use. Based
on <BR>
research by Dr. L. Robison in the publication Cancer and Dr. J. Buckley
in <BR>
Cannabis: Physiopathology, Epidemiology, Detection.<BR>
        <BR>
* * * Marijuana smoke produces airway injury, acute and <BR>
chronic bronchitis, lung inflammation, and decreased pulmonary defences
<BR>
against infection. Smoking one marijuana cigarette leads to airway <BR>
deposition of four times as much cancer-causing tar as does tobacco smoke.
<BR>
Based on research by by Dr. D. Tashkin as reported in the Western Journal
of <BR>
Medicine.<BR>
        <BR>
* * * Cases of cancer, including cancer of the mouth, <BR>
tongue, larynx, jaw, head, neck, and lungs have been reported in young <BR>
marijuana smokers that would not occur in tobacco smokers until much later
<BR>
in life. Based on research by reported in Otolaryngology, Head &amp; Neck
<BR>
Surgery, the Journal of the American Medical Association and Southern <BR>
Medical Journal. <BR>
        <BR>
* * * A 1995 study of blood samples taken from one <BR>
thousand four hundred and forty-one dead or impaired drivers across Canada
<BR>
found marijuana present in 38% of these samples. Based on research by of
Dr. <BR>
Wayne Hindmarsh, Dean, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Manitoba and Wayne
<BR>
Jeffery, R.C.M.P. Police Forensic Laboratory.<BR>
        <BR>
* * * Marijuana has long been known to trigger attacks <BR>
of mental illness, such as bipolar (manic-depressive) psychosis and <BR>
schizophrenia. It has been shown that marijuana users are six times more
<BR>
likely to develop schizophrenia than are non-users. Based on research by
of <BR>
Dr. S. Andreasson published in Britain's The Lancet.<BR>
        <BR>
* * * The use of marijuana leads to the use of other <BR>
drugs. Of those who use marijuana 3 to 10 times, 20% go on to use cocaine.
<BR>
Of those who use marijuana one hundred or more times, 75% go on to use <BR>
cocaine. Based on research by as reported in the Journal of Clinical<BR>
Psychiatry.<BR>
<BR>
* * * Marijuana causes both dependence and addiction. <BR>
Addictive use is defined by compulsive repeated use in spite of adverse
<BR>
consequences. Marijuana's effects include tolerance leading to dependence
<BR>
and inability to cease use. Based on research by of Dr. Mark Gold published
<BR>
in his book Marijuana.  <BR>
<BR>
* * * It's not just alcohol that caused impaired <BR>
accidents. A roadside study of reckless drivers who were not impaired by
<BR>
alcohol, showed that 45% of these drivers tested positive for marijuana.
<BR>
Based on research by of Dr. Dan Brookoff, published in the New England <BR>
Journal of Medicine.<BR>
        <BR>
* * * The effects of marijuana persist much longer than <BR>
the effects of alcohol. Using a computerized flight simulator, an experiment
<BR>
on pilots showed that their ability to land a plane was still impaired 24
<BR>
hours after smoking one marijuana cigarette. Based on research by of  Dr.
V. <BR>
Leirer in Aviation, Space &amp; Environmental Medicine.<BR>
        <BR>
* * * Children exposed to marijuana prenatally have <BR>
increased behavioural problems, and they have decreased visual perception,
<BR>
language comprehension, attention span and memory. These children are the
<BR>
innocent victims of their parents marijuana use.  Based on research by of
<BR>
Dr. Peter Fried of the Ottawa Prenatal Prospective Study.<BR>
        <BR>
* * * In males marijuana use diminishes testosterone <BR>
production and lowers sperm count. In females, marijuana use disrupts <BR>
hormone cycles.  Marijuana is mutagenic, fetotoxic (poisonous to the fetus)
<BR>
and impairs RNA and DNA synthesis.  Based on research by of Dr. Mark Gold
in <BR>
his book Marijuana and Drs. Latour and Nahas in the Medical Journal of <BR>
Australia.<BR>
        <BR>
* * * Marijuana impairs the white blood cells which <BR>
fight infection. Marijuana also causes decreased resistance to diseases
such <BR>
as herpes. Marijuana smokers have increased outpatient visits for <BR>
respiratory illnesses, accidents and other illnesses. Based on research
by <BR>
of Drs. Spector, Djeu, Watzl and Cabral in Advances in Experimental Medicine
<BR>
&amp; Biology and the Western Journal of Medicine.<BR>
        <BR>
* * * Children prenatally exposed to marijuana <BR>
experienced more than two times the number of sleep arousals at night and
<BR>
more awake time after each sleep arousal than children not prenatally <BR>
exposed to marijuana. Based on research by published in The Archives of
<BR>
Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine.<BR>
        <BR>
<BR>
* * * Cases of cancer from marijuana use are now well <BR>
documented. In one California study 90% of young cancer patients are <BR>
marijuana smokers compared with 40% of young people in California as a <BR>
whole. Based on research by by Dr. P. Donald in Otolaryngology, Head and
<BR>
Neck Surgery .<BR>
<BR>
* * * HIV positive marijuana smokers have increased <BR>
incidence of bacterial pneumonias in comparison to non-smokers. HIV positive
<BR>
smokers develop full-blown AIDS twice as fast as non-smokers. Based on <BR>
research by in the journal, AIDS Weekly 1993, and Dr. Neiman, in the <BR>
journal, AIDS 1993.<BR>
        <BR>
* * * In a survey of one hundred and fifty marijuana <BR>
using students, 59% surveyed report they sometimes forget what a <BR>
conversation is about before it has ended. 41% report that if they read
<BR>
while stoned they remembered less of what they had read hours later. Based
<BR>
on research by of Dr. Richard Schwartz, Vienna Pediatric Associates in <BR>
Psychiatric Annals. <BR>
        <BR>
* * * Long-term use of marijuana may cause irreversible <BR>
memory problems. Marijuana users find it more difficult to separate <BR>
irrelevant information from the relevant, their reaction times are longer
<BR>
and electrical activity of the brain is slowed. Based on research by from
<BR>
Macquarie University, Sydney in conjunction with Australia's National Drug
&amp; <BR>
Alcohol Research Centre.<BR>
        <BR>
* * * Marijuana impairs perception, judgment, thinking, <BR>
memory and learning. Memory defects may persist for 6 weeks after last <BR>
marijuana use. Based on research by of Dr. Richard Schwartz, Vienna <BR>
Pediatrics Associates in the American Journal of Diseases of Children.<BR>
        <BR>
* * * There are significant negative effects of <BR>
prenatal marijuana exposure on the performance of children in standard <BR>
intelligence tests. On average children exposed prenatally to marijuana
will <BR>
have a lower IQ compared to children who are not exposed. Based on research
<BR>
by of Dr. Day et al, in Neurotoxicology and Teratology.<BR>
        <BR>
* * * A cannabis (marijuana)-state-dependent effect in <BR>
users includes weaknesses in analytic and synthetic skills. This includes
<BR>
having difficulty sorting out information, synthesizing and classifying
<BR>
information correctly and understanding subtle shades of meaning. Based
on <BR>
research by of Dr. Lundqvist in Life Sciences.<BR>
        <BR>
* * * Fetal Marijuana Symptoms are similar to Fetal <BR>
Alcohol Syndrome are two diseases children are born with that are totally
<BR>
preventable. One of the leading specialists in cellular heredity, Dr. Akira
<BR>
Morishima of Columbia University, has said that in his 20 years of research
<BR>
on human cells he has never found any other drug, including heroin, which
<BR>
comes close to the DNA damage caused by marijuana.<BR>
        <BR>
* * * Saying nobody ever died from smoking marijuana is <BR>
like saying nobody ever died from smoking tobacco. Marijuana contains the
<BR>
same cancer causing chemicals as tobacco. Marijuana contains acetone, <BR>
hydrogen cyanide, ammonia, carbon monoxide, benzene, benzo pyrene, <BR>
nitrosamines and many other cancer causing pollutants. Based on research
by <BR>
of G. Huber in Pharmacology Biochemistry and Behavior.<BR>
<BR>
* * * Who is really killing our rain forests? The <BR>
United Nations reports that in Jamaica growers of marijuana plant their
<BR>
crops on isolated mountain slopes disturbing fragile forest soils. Growers
<BR>
clear cut and destroy the forests exposing fertile soil to runoff and <BR>
erosion causing permanently damages forests. <BR>
        <BR>
* * * Marijuana causes many mental disorders, including <BR>
acute toxic psychosis, panic attacks, flashbacks, delusions, <BR>
depersonalization, hallucinations, paranoia, depression and &quot;uncontrollable
<BR>
feelings of aggression&quot;. Based on research by of Dr. Richard  Schwartz,
<BR>
Vienna Pediatrics Associates in Pediatric Clinics of North America.<BR>
