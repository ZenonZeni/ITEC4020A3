Frozen dessert year in review

Tea-flavored ice creams and ice cream pizza pies
proliferated in 1995, but the sudden flurry of
competition in these segments ran second to the
developments in another product category, that of
sorbets, where Ice Cream Reporter's top story for the
year is the decision by Haagen-Dazs to proceed with a
national rollout of its sorbet line.  The move by the
world's leading superpremium frozen dessert marketer is
significant on several levels.  Most importantly, a large-
scale advertising and promotion campaign by Haagen-
Dazs created an awareness of sorbets among masses of
consumers who were previously unaware that this type
of product even existed.  But the Haagen-Dazs blitz also
focused attention on the disparity between the marketing
power of the industry's deep-pocketed leaders and the
precarious position of the smaller frozen dessert
companies that struggle along on a shoe-string to
maintain their hold on hard-won market niches.  Some of
those smaller companies felt the pinch as soon as the
Haagen-Dazs rollout began, losing distribution and shelf
space as retailers opted for the big-name brand.  But
other sorbet marketers argued that the public awareness
created for the category by Haagen-Dazs would help all
participants.  Because of its impact on the market,
Haagen-Dazs Sorbet is not only the story of the year for
1995 but also the product of the year.

Encouraged by the entry of Haagen-Dazs, or at least not
discouraged by it, was The Mattus Group, which
introduced a line of sorbets under the Monterey label
(ICR 11/95).  Admitting to being encouraged by the
Haagen-Dazs entry was International Yogurt, which is
now offering its Sorbet...by Yo Cream to its foodservice
customers (ICR 10/95).  Looking for a slightly different
niche is Lafayette Foods, which introduced Frubet, an
ultra-rich sorbet that is being positioned as an upscale
competitor to single-serve Italian ices rather than going
head-to-head with the pint-packed sorbets (ICR 12/95).

Domestic Moves:  The most important event in the
domestic frozen dessert industry, after the Haagen-Dazs
sorbet rollout, was the decision by Brice Foods to end its
traditional franchise practice and switch to a royalty-free
franchise plan for is 200-unit I Can't Believe It's Yogurt
chain (ICR 11/95).  The progress of the new plan, which
will have franchisees purchase their goods from the
franchisor on an as-needed basis, is sure to be watched
closely by other frozen dessert chain operators.

Also making franchise news was TCBY, which announced
in December that it was planning to trnansform all its
company-owned units to franchisees (ICR 12/95).  The
move was part of an overall reorganization of the frozen
yogurt marketer.  Increasing its presence in the
foodservice arena was Dannon, which launched a turn-
key, modular vending concept under the name Yogurt
Cravings (ICR 4/95).

Other major stories on the domestic front included the
return to the black of Ben & Jerry's, after suffering the
first loss in the company's history in the 3rd quarter of
1994 (ICR 12/95); the agreement by the International
Dairy Foods Association and the Dairy and Food
Industries Supply Association to join forces and create a
new International Food and Dairy Show (ICR 2/95); and
the elimination of package size restrictions on frozen
desserts by the National Conference on Weights and
Measures (ICR 8/95).  Also noteworthy was the decision
by Grand Metropolitan to close Haagen-Dazs' long-term
headquarters in Teaneck, NJ and consolidate the
company's operations with those of Pillsbury in
Minneapolis (ICR 10/95).

Product Trends: Following on the flood of coffee-flavored
frozen desserts that hit the market in 1994 came a slew
of tea-flavored products beginning with a line of Iced Tea
Pops produced by H.P. Hood under a licensing agreement
with the highly popular tea marketer Celestial Seasonings
(ICR 3/95).  Also in March was the announcement of a
Lipton Original Iced Tea Bar from Good Humor-Breyers,
with Unilever synergizing two of its most popular brands.
Next up was Frozfruit, which joined the tea party with a
Lemon Iced Tea fruit bar (ICR 4/95).  In another bit of
synergy, Nestle borrowed from its popular tea brand to
create the Nestea Iced Tea Bar (ICR 9/95).

If three makes a trend, then ice cream pizza became a
trend in 1995.  Good Humor-Breyers kicked off the
movement with its Freeza Pizza novelty (ICR 3/95), then
Dairy Queen upped the ante with a full-sized ice cream
pie which it called the DQ Treatzza Pizza (ICR 5/95).
Baskin-Robbins weighed in a few months later with its
Polar Pizza (ICR 9/95), available in both single slices
and whole pie form.

New Products: The Good Humor-Breyers items
mentioned above were part of a massive 50-product
launch by the company this past spring (ICR 3/95) which
also included Romantica, a follow-up to the company's
Viennetta ice cream cake, and Reese's Peanut Butter Ice
Cream Cups, made under a licensing agreement with
Hershey Food Co.

Eskimo Pie made several new product announcements
that involved licensing agreements, beginning with a deal
with Nabisco to create a line of frozen desserts based on
the four most popular cookie brands in the country (ICR
1/95).  The next licensing deal called for Eskimo Pie to
take over the poduction and marketing of the popular
Weight Watchers frozen desserts (ICR 2/95), and a third
saw Eskimo Pie entering into a long-term agreement to
manufacture, distribute, and market Realfruit Sorbets
(ICR 4/95).

In other new product news, Clarke Ice Cream licensed the
A&W root beer brand for a line of novelties (ICR 11/95);
and Healthy Choice added a superpremium low-fat line
under Special Creations label (ICR 3/95).  Also
noteworthy was the launch of Haagen-Dazs Cordials, a
line of liqueur-flavored ice creams (ICR 1/95).

One other new product of significance announced in 1995,
though not due out on the market until 1996, is the
coffee ice cream from Dreyer's and Starbucks (ICR
11/95).  This launch caps the coffee ice cream trend that
began in 1994 by pairing two market leaders in a joint
venture that goes beyond the usual licensing agreement.

Pricing Down:    Two other product introductions of
interest were the Blue Ribbon line of ice cream cakes
from Carvel (ICR 10/95) and the Chiqui i.i. ice creams and
sorbets from Out of a Flower (ICR 11/95).  The two
launches shared a common importance in that they were
both lower-priced versions of products the companies
were already marketing.  In the case of Carvel, the lower-
priced introduction reflected pressure from competing
products; while Out of a Flower was looking to broaden its
distribution to outlets that would not handle its primary
ultra-high-priced line.

Mergers & Acquisitions:    No deal in 1995 came close
to 1994's story-of-the-year, the acquisition by Nestle of
22% of Dreyer's stock.  But among the more interesting
moves in 1995 were the acquisition of Bresler's
Industries by the Canadian marketer Yogen Fruz World-
Wide (ICR 7/95); the acquisition of the rights to the
Colombo frozen yogurt brand by Integrated Brands
(formerly Steve's Homemade) (ICR 9/95); the
management buyout of Nestle Dairy Sytems, renamed
Norse Dairy Systems (ICR 11/95); and Pfizer's sale of its
Food Science Group to the Finnish ingredient company
Cultor, Ltd. (ICR 11/95).

Following upon its acquisition in 1994 by Kohlberg,
Kravis, & Roberts (ICR 9/94), Borden announced that it
was planning to sell its dairies east of the Mississippi in
order to focus on its western dairy operations (ICR 6/95).
The first sale took place shortly thereafter, with a Borden
unit in West Virginia going to United Dairy, Inc. (ICR
7/95).  Later in the year Borden amended its policy
slightly with the sale of one of its key western units, its
Houston frozen dessert plant, to Dreyer's (ICR 12/95).
The acquisition helped strengthen Dreyer's expansion into
the Southwest.

International News:  U.S. frozen dessert marketers
continued to find room for expansion overseas in 1995.
Bresler's Industries reached two licensing agreements in
China (ICR 1/95 and 5/95), and one in Brazil (ICR 6/95);
Baskin-Robbins opened its first shop in Vietnam (ICR
2/95) and expanded its existing operations in Russia (ICR
12/95); TCBY expanded its franchising into India and the
Cayman Islands (ICR 10/95) and Russia (ICR 11/95); and
Brice Foods licensed manufacturing rights for its products
to companies in Europe, Brazil, and Australia to facilitate
supplying of its overseas ICBIY shops (ICR 12/95).

While not contracting in terms of business, Haagen-Dazs
did shrink its overseas operations, closing its Paris
headquarters and consolidating its management into that
of parent Grand Metropolitan (ICR 1/95).  This
anticipated a similar move noted in the Domestic Moves
section above.

People in the News:    Among the people making news in
the frozen dessert industry in 1995, the most prominent
was Bob Holland, who won the job of replacing company
founder Ben Cohen as CEO of Ben & Jerry's following a
much-publicized search and contest (ICR 2/95).  Holland,
who was also named president of the company, is given
much of the credit for getting Ben & Jerry's back on track
in 1995.

Steve Herrell, one of the founding fathers of the
superpremium movement, was also in the news this past
year as he began to expand his latest chain of ice cream
shops (ICR 3/95).  Making news of a less positive nature
was Robert Peltz, former chairman of Chipwich, who was
accused of using almost $700,000 in company funds for
personal expenses (ICR 10/95).

BST:    The battle over the use of the synthetically-
produced growth hormone bovine somatropin (BST)
continued in 1995.  Early on, the pro-BST forces claimed a
number of victories by blocking legislation in states
across the country (ICR 5/95).  In June, Ben & Jerry's, one
of the most prominent foes of BST use, resigned from the
International Ice Cream Association in protest against the
group's pro-BST stance (ICR 6/95).  Later in the year the
pro-BST movement suffered a setback when a Vermont
judge rejected a request for an injunction against the
state's mandatory BST labeling law (ICR 8/95).

Advertising & Promotions:    With reduced-fat, low-fat,
and fat-free frozen desserts claiming a growing share of
the market in 1995, Unilever introduced a new labeling
format for its Good Humor-Breyers light alternative
products, with logos reminding consumers to "Eat
Healthy, Eat Well" and "Eat Better, Eat Well" (ICR 12/95).

 ...And a look at the year ahead

As with many other facets of American life, legislation
now pending in the 104th Congress could have a
significant impact on the frozen dessert industry in 1996.
As explained in an article further on in this issue, there
could be a major increase in frozen dessert prices if
Congress makes changes in current dairy policy.  But, as
the article also explains, it is simply too early to know
whether the changes will be made and, if they are, how
big they will be.

An increase in frozen dessert prices could have the effect
of making it easier in 1996 for the larger companies in
the industry to use discounting and other forms of price
promotion as competitive weapons against smaller
players.  Price competition has been an ongoing factor,
albeit to a relatively small degree, in the frozen dessert
industry.  But it would not be surprising to see more
companies do what Carvel did this past year, i.e.,
introduce a lower-priced line in the face of price
competition from its rivals.

Something that will definitely be lower in 1996 will be
the fat content of more and more frozen dessert products.
Sales of light alternative products were up significantly in
1995 and the trend will continue into 1996.  More and
more marketers will follow the Good Humor-Breyers
example and add logos or other labeling marks that will
make it easier for consumers to identify these products.
The desire for light alternative frozen desserts, coupled
with the rollout of the Haagen-Dazs line of sorbets, our
1995 story of the year, should lead to increased sales for
the sorbet category.

In last year's look ahead we predicted, for the second
time, that Unilever would make a bid for Haagen-Dazs.
With Grand Metropolitan pulling the reins in on Haagen-
Dazs's management this past year, it seems less likely
than ever that the British comglomerate would be willing
to let the superpremium marketer go.  So instead, we'll
focus on the Nestle-Dreyer's connection and suggest that
if the frozen novelties marketer does not make an
outright move to acquire the Oakland-based Dreyer's, it
will definitely seek to improve on its 22% holding.  And if
it doesn't go for Dreyer's, Nestle could make a bid on
Eskimo Pie, perhaps even finding itself in a bidding war
with Unilever for the Virginia-based novelties marketer.

Haagen-Dazs testing cafe concept


Testing of a broader, cafe-type menu concept is
underway in a handful of Haagen-Dazs shops around the
country.  The shops, all franchise operations, have
expanded their offerings beyond the traditional line of
frozen desserts to include such items as sweet baked
goods, sandwiches, and salads.  A Haagen-Dazs
spokesman told Ice Cream Reporter that Rthe company is
interested in seeing how the extended menu will affect
the shops' business.S  He noted that the test is open-
ended, with no specific time-table as to when or whether
additional units will be converted to the cafe concept,
despite some published reports that 25 out of the 250
Haagen-Dazs shops in the U.S. would eventually be
changed over to cafe.

The testing of the cafe concept began last May with a
single shop in Boulder, CO.  A second franchisee
introduced the concept in October at a single unit in
Coconut Grove, FL.  Conversion of a third unit has just
been completed in Tysons Corner, VA.

The new unit has 1,300 square feet of floor space.  The
Haagen-Dazs spokesman explained that the cafe concept
would only be introduced in shops that were between
1,200 and 1,500 sq. ft.  The aim, he noted, was to create a
Rcozy environment,S but that any shop smaller than than
the 1,200 sq. ft. minimum would not be able to
acommodate any tables comfortably or provide enough
floor space for the self-service customer traffic.

The responsibility for the menu expansion rests with the
franchisees who are testing the cafe concept.  The
Haagen-Dazs spokesman indicated that the company
considered the introduction of baked goods as the top
priority with sandwiches, salads, and other foods
secondary.  He reported that the company has not given
the franchisees strict guidelines as to what foods they can
offer, but would draw the line if someone tried to
introduce a line of fried chicken, to use one example.
RThe main parameter,S he explained, Ris whether it
enhances the Haagen-Dazs concept.S

Dairy legislation remains in turmoil


The new year begins with U.S. dairy policy in a state of
flux.  Efforts to reach a decision on whether to retain,
drop, or in some way alter price supports for dairy
products remain unresolved as the larger issue of the
overall budget continues to be worked out.  Despite the
uncertainty, one strong possibility is that the price of
milk will be allowed to go up, sending the price of other
dairy products, including frozen desserts, up with it.

According to the International Dairy Foods Association
(IDFA), a plan proposed by Rep. Steve Gunderson (R-WI),
and supported by the National Milk Producers Federation,
could Rdramatically increase the prices consumers now
pay for milk and other dairy products by billions of
dollars.S  The Gunderson plan is described as a
RcompromiseS because it allows for both an increase and
decrease of government control of dairy at the same time.

The plan follows the current political trend of reducing
government interference in the marketplace by
eliminating price supports for some dairy products.  But
the IDFA points out that what it takes away with one
hand it gives back with interest with the other by locking
in higher minimum price levels to producers for fluid
milk.  These higher prices would be paid by dairy
processors and food manufacturers and then passed along
to consumers.  The government would also be paying the
higher price when purchasing milk and dairy products
for needy citizens.  With budget allotments fixed, this
would result in smaller purchases and fewer people
helped.

An IDFA representative told Ice Cream Reporter that the
Gunderson plan is on the table as a result of President
Clinton having vetoed the budget passed by Congress in
November.  In that budget, dairy policy was to remain
unchanged, a compromise between those conservative
idealogues who wanted to eliminate all government
agricultural supports, including dairy, and
representatives from dairy-producing regions, led by
Jerry Solomon (R-NY), who were defending the interests
of their constituents.  The presidential veto opened the
door to further legislative discussion and the
development of the Gunderson plan.

The IDFA representative noted that passage of the
Gunderson plan was far from being a certainty.  For one
thing, there are strong regional disagreements, chiefly
between producers in the West and the Northeast over
whether the benefits would be distributed equitably.  In
addition, the loss of price supports might lead to the
"dumping" of some U.S. dairy products on world markets
which could be in violation of U.S. trade agreements.
With so many details such as these to be worked out, it is
possible that the budget compromise plan of November,
i.e., leaving current dairy policies in place, will once again
be chosen.

Baskin-Robbins continues convenience store expansion
drive


Baskin-Robbins has announced that it is expanding its
convenience store operations through an agreement with
H.N. Funkhouser, operator of the Virginia-based Handy
Mart chain.  The franchise co-branding agreement, which
also includes Baskin-Robbins' sister company Dunkin'
Donuts, calls for Funkhouser to retro-fit seven of its 14
units to accomodate the frozen dessert and donut
operations.  The Handy Mart units to be converted are
located in Frederick, Warren, and Clarke counties.  The
first unit is expected to be ready by late February, with a
150-square-foot space devoted to the sale of a full line of
Baskin-Robbins ice creams and frozen yogurts, including
pre-packed and hand-packed items, frozen dessert cakes,
and the fountain items typically available in a Baskin-
Robbins shop.  Table space is included, as well.

The Handy Mart deal is the latest in a series reached by
Baskin-Robbins with regional gas station/convenience
store operators over the last two years.  It also continues
the company's ongoing co-franchising effort with Dunkin'
Donuts.  Each of the two companies, owned by the British
conglomerate Allied Domecq, is the largest franchisor
worldwide in its category.  By teaming up, they offer
convenience store operators and other franchisees the
opportunity to offer products that complement each other
seasonally.  In addition, operators can cross-train
employees for both operations.

Funkhouser president Robert Claytor explained that his
company wants to attract a more diverse clientele to the
convenience stores through the addition of the
nationally-known brand name chains.  The Handy Marts
started out as gas stations when they opened in the
1930s, with auto parts sales added in the 1970s, and the
convenience stores in the 1980s.  The inclusion of the
Baskin-Robbins and Dunkin' Donuts operations is in
keeping with a national trend that has seen about 2,000
gas stations across the country add some type of fast food
operation in recent years in order to attract more
travelers to stop at their locations.

Pascobel makes U.S. push

Looking to develop a niche in the U.S. market for frozen
dessert ingredients is the Pascobel Corporation.  An
offshoot of the Montreal-based Pascobel, Inc., the
company offers natural, highly functional milk protein
products that are designed to replace non-fat dry milk
and skim milk powders in a variety of processed dairy
products including ice creams and frozen yogurts.

The products, marketed under the Nollibel and Belcover
labels, have been used for many years by over 300 food
manufacturers in Canada and more than a dozen
European nations.  The long-term acceptance of the
products in Europe is due, in part, to the fact that the
technology for producing the dairy proteins was
developed on the continent over 25 years ago by the
French dairy company Bel Cheese.

Ted Fisch, National Sales Manager for the New Jersey-
based Pascobel, explained that the company had launched
a major effort to acquaint American manufacturers with
its products through an appearance at the 1995
MegaShow in Chicago.  At the show, Pascobel conducted a
blind taste test using a 3% low fat vanilla ice cream.  One
sample was made using skim milk powder while in
another, 50% of the skim milk powder was replaced with
the company's Nollibel 1450 functional milk protein
product.  According to Fisch, over 65% of those who tried
the ice creams preferred the one with the Nollibel.

Fisch noted that the particular variety of Nollibel used in
the taste taste, the least functional in the line, sells for
about half the typical price of skim milk powder.  The
top-of-the line products offer savings closer to 10% off
the typical price of skim milk powder.  Fisch pointed out
that in addition to being less expensive than non-fat dry
milk or skim milk powder, the Pascobel milk protein
products, because of their processing, have greater
consistency and more body and texture than the
competing products.

The company makes a variety of standard products
specifically intended for use in economy ice creams,
premium ice creams, and reduced-fat ice creams and
frozen yogurts.  It also reports that it can customize
products at the manufacturer's request to suit them to
specific applications.

Last Licks


o       Borden has released some additional information on
the sale of its Houston ice cream plant to Dreyer's, which
we reported on in the December ICR.  Under the terms of
the agreement, which became effective December 31,
about 100 hourly workers and 29 salaried employees will
be given severance packages and assistance in finding
new work.  Approximately 35 distribution workers will
be retained by Borden and will continue to be involved in
delivering the company's branded frozen desserts which
will be co-packed by Dreyer's.  Borden also reports that it
will supply the distribution area previously served from
the Houston plant with products manufactured at other
Borden plants in the region.

o       Another item from the December ICR, on the
expansion of Baskin-Robbins operations in Russia,
requires amending.  We reported that the company's
production facility in Moscow would not be open until the
spring.  The day after we went to press, we were
informed that the plant had become operational on
December 11th.  In addition, the facility will serve the
company's Russian stores only, although deliveries to
other countries may follow in the future.  ICR had
indicated that the plant would begin serving East
European countries immediately.

o       In another follow-up on our December issue, the
December 4 issue of Crain's Cleveland Business reports
that Pierre's French Ice Cream has followed its Lysteria-
related product recall of late October/early November
with a major coupon campaign intended as a Rthank youS
to loyal customers.  The $2-off coupons appeared on
November 29th in The Plain Dealer, The Beacon-Journal,
and some 20 newspapers throughout northern Ohio and
western Pennsylvania.

o       Back in October, ICR reported that Denver-based
Meadow Gold Dairies was scoring big with its Colorado
Rockies Ice Cream, named for the city's baseball team.
Now it has followed up with another sports-related line,
this time named for the local National Hockey League
team, the Colorado Avalanche.  Individual flavors feature
such rink-related names as Slap Shot Vanilla, Hat Trick
Sundae, and Chocolate Power Play.

o       The December 8 Financial Times reported that
Nestle Philippines would be taking a greater role in the
operations of Magnolia Nestle, its ice cream company joint
venture with San Miguel, the largest food company in the
Philippines.  Magnolia holds a 56% share of the ice cream
market in the Philippines, but that represents a
significant loss from previous years.

o       Catching up on some other overseas news, the
September 12 edition of Euromarketing reported that
Unilever subsidiary GB-Glace Sweden is withdrawing
from the Norwegian market after failing in its efforts to
take share away from frozen dessert market leader Norsk
Iskrem.  GB-Glace has accumulated about $8 million in
losses since entering that market in 1991.  Norsk Iskrem
holds a 49% share of the Norwegian market, with Hennig
Olsen second at 34%, and Drammens Is third with a 13%
share.

o       And catching up on some domestic news from the
same month, the September 22 edition of the
Birmingham News reported that newly-arrived Blue Bell
Ice Cream had taken the lead in that city's ice cream
sales, surpassing Barber Dairies, a hometown favorite for
75 years, by garnering a 32.3% market share.  Texas-
based Blue Bell had expanded distribution into the
Birmingham market only a few months earlier, as
reported in the February 1995 ICR.

o       Jerseymaid Dairies announced on December 14 that
it was recalling half-gallon containers of the Select brand
Light Rocky Road Ice Cream it co-packed for the Safeway
supermarket chain following the discovery of Listeria
contamination during a sampling of the product.  The
containers had been distributed from the company's base
in City of Commerce, CA to stores in northern California,
Arizona, Nevada, and Hawaii.

o       Happier news on that same date of December 14
cmme from TCBY which  announced that its board of
directors had declared a $0.05 per share dividend
payable on January 15 to all shareholders of record as of
December 29.

o       The Sealright Company has announced third quarter
results for the period ending September 30, 1995 with
sales of $76.2 million, down 4.5% from the same period in
1994.  Net income was $1.05 million, down almost 77%,
