<TITLE>Message from Symposium Technical Chairmen</TITLE>
<H1>Message from Symposium Technical Chairmen</H1>
<P>The Technical Program for IGARSS'94 reflects the symposium theme -
"Surface and Atmospheric Remote Sensing: Technologies, Data Analysis and
Interpretation."  The program includes papers covering a wide spectrum
of research in remote sensing science and techniques in the traditional
Earth science disciplines of oceans, atmospheres, land, and cryosphere. 
Also well represented are papers on topics of special interest to
membership of the sponsoring societies: the IEEE Geoscience and Remote
Sensing Society, the Optical Society of America, and the International
Union of Radio Science.  To achieve balance in the program,
approximately half of the technical sessions were organized as special
sessions comprising both invited and contributed papers.  In addition,
three plenary sessions were organized to highlight the integrating theme
of the symposium.  The first plenary session on Linkage Between Earth
System Modeling and Remote Sensing provides perspectives on the need for
global and long-term observations in understanding the Earth's diverse
geophysical processes.  The second plenary on New Developments in Remote
Sensing Systems and Technologies presents some key trends shaping future
applications of remote sensing.  A third plenary, Policy Forum: Issues
of Mission Coordination and Data Availability, focuses on how remote
sensing missions and data are being coordinated at the international
level, and how this affects opportunities for new science and
applications.  Also included in the program are sessions on results from
recent space missions and previews of future missions.  In its breadth
and depth this promises to be a very exciting symposium indeed!
</P> 
<P>The response to the IGARSS'94 Call for Papers was overwhelming.  The
Technical Committee faced difficult choices in paper allocations and,
unfortunately, not all submissions could be accommodated.  In all, the
full program consists of 70 technical sessions and 30 interactive
sessions for a total of approximately 1000 papers.  Special thanks are
due to the members of the Technical Program Committee, and to the
organizers of the special sessions and plenaries who devoted
considerable effort to ensuring the high quality of the solicited
papers.</P>
