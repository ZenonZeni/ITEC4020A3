Joint Space Management Board finalized

      Defense Secretary William J. Perry and Director 
of Central Intelligence John M. Deutch agreed late 
last month to the shape and scope of the long awaited 
but oft-delayed Joint Space Management Board 
(JSMB). 
     In an agreement signed Dec. 13th, Perry and 
Deutch established the JSMB as a "board of 
directors" for defense and intelligence-related U.S. 
space programs. The board will provide executive 
management for the various military and civilian-
controlled space programs with intel functions, as 
well as direct oversight of the newly created National 
Space Architect post. 
     The board's first task is to integrate policy, 
requirements, architectures, acquisition strategies and 
funding needs.

**DoD, CIA to share leadership roles

      The Pentagon announced direction of the board 
will be provided by a co-chairmanship of 
Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition and 
Technology Paul G. Kaminski and Deputy Director 
of Central Intelligence George J. Tenet. 
     This management team will be backed by an 
executive committee empowered to act by the 
secretary of Defense and the director of Central 
Intelligence, giving it broad executive powers within 
the charter of the JSMB. That committee will be 
comprised of the two co-chairs, plus the vice 
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the 
executive director, Intelligence Community Affairs.

**Part of a three-phase reorganization

      The DoD had previously placed the formation of 
the JSMB as the third element of a reorganization 
plan for defense space programs.
     In the first phase, an undersecretary of Defense 
for Space was created Dec. 10, 1994. Consolidations 
of space requirements and acquisition plans began 
last year under that new office, now held by former 
Capitol Hill staffer Bob Davis. 
     Next Kaminski's office created a Space Architect 
post to be responsible for acquisitions for military 
space programs, from satellites and ground elements 
to launchers. Last fall that post was filled by Air 
Force Brig. Gen. Robert Dickman.
     While Dickman and Davis report to Kaminski, 
Davis remains in overall charge of U.S. military 
space policy. With the JSMB in place, a new defense 
space use directive and a National Security Policy for 
Space are expected to emerge this year. 
     Space chief Davis told Military Space last fall that 
new policy documents were in preparation and 
constituted his first priorities, along with program 
consolidations. 

**Details of JSMB membership

      Other JSMB members include the Pentagon's 
controller; Vice Chief of Staff of the Army; Vice 
Chief of Naval Operations; Vice Chief of Staff of the 
Air Force; Assistant Commandant of the Marine 
Corps; the acquisition executives of the Army, Navy 
and Air Force; Assistant Secretary of Defense for 
Command, Control Communications and 
Intelligence; Director, Program Analysis and 
Evaluation; Deputy Undersecretary of Defense for 
Space; Commander-in-Chief U.S. Space Command.
     Also Executive Director Central Intelligence 
Agency; and the directors, National Security Agency, 
National Reconnaissance Office, Defense 
Intelligence Agency, National Imagery and Mapping 
Agency (ex-officio until agency is formally 
established by act of Congress), and director, Bureau 
of Intelligence and Research Dept. of State.

**Charter lays out specifics

      Other details of the JSMB charter as agreed to by 
Perry and Deutch include:
     * Overall policy and program guidance for 
defense and intelligence space programs, including 
review function and approval of all trade-offs among 
requirements, programs and resources.
     * Review and approval of all defense and 
intelligence space policies, architectures and program 
plans for consistency with current JSMB policy and 
program guidance. 
     * Develop and make recommendations regarding 
defense and intelligence space program budget 
matters to the Expanded Defense Resources Board.
     * Establishment the integration of defense and 
intelligence space architectures under a single 
National Security Space Architect, with authority to 
design implementation of programs and 
architectures.
     * Provide recommendations to the secretary of 
Defense and the director of Central Intelligence on 
any issue with impact upon defense and intelligence 
space programs or other such matters as referred to it 
by either the secretary of Defense or the director of 
Central Intelligence.
     * Provides authority to establish Integrated 
Product Teams as deemed necessary to accomplish 
its functions.
     * Authority via the co-chairs or at the request of 
any member to call meetings, but at least quarterly.

A Milspace Policy Brief
Defining Missile Defense: What missile, which 
defense?

     President Clinton's veto of the fiscal year 1996 
Defense Authorization bill, which the Congress 
failed to override last week, was focused on 
accelerated funding for a National Missile Defense 
(NMD). 
     The White House said that, in addition to being 
unnecessary, NMD was a potential violation to 
START agreements.

**Bill increases funding

     Under the bill, funding for ballistic missile 
defense research, development and testing would 
soar to more than $3 billion, a massive $598.9 
million increase over the Clinton administration's 
requested $2.44 billion. That high- point in missile 
defense history would mark the first time the 
Ballistic Missile Defense Office budget request was 
either fully funded or increased. 
     Of the $3 billion, some $820 million -- a $450 
million increase -- will go for acceleration of NMD 
"at the earliest possible date," in about four to six 
years, the bill said. Clinton objected to this provision.

**Senate boosts SMTS schedule

     While the House increased missile defense 
funding, the Senate poured more funds into missile 
tracking. The Senate Armed Services Committee 
authorized $249 million in FY 1996 monies for the 
Space and Missile Tracking System program, 
formerly Brilliant Eyes. 
     The SMTS is the low-Earth orbit segment of the 
Space-based Infrared Sensor System. The programs 
are part of the NMD. The Senate committee also 
boosted funding for cruise missile programs, and 
called for the establishment of a Cruise Missile 
Defense (CMD) Initiative. 
     The bill called on Defense Secretary William 
Perry to ensure existing air defense systems "are 
upgraded to improve capabilities" against cruise 
missiles. Perry was also directed by the Senate to 
make CMD a priority to support deployment of 
future systems that are effective against advanced 
and stealth cruise missiles. 
     The initiative must lay out a comprehensive plan 
of organizational changes within DoD that could 
strengthen CMD activities. But within the Pentagon, 
the intelligence agencies, and the Washington policy 
establishment, the issue of what type of missile 
threat -- what ballistic missile system with what 
attributes and coming from what geographic threat 
arena -- has come to the forefront of the missile 
defense debate: What missile? Which defense? And 
if the United States faces near-term ICBM threats, is 
the technology available to provide protection?

**Core of the debate

     At the center of the debate are two issues: what is 
the nature of the threat(s) facing the United States, 
and what kind of defensive system could or should, 
if any, be deployed as counter measures? 
     On the issue of the existence or emergence of a 
new strategic threat, two wholly different views are 
held by many who frame the issue. 
     One view holds that the threat of ballistic missiles 
is a real and growing one, with a cast of rogue 
nations racing toward early deployments and 
searching the world's arms markets for the most 
advanced technology available. The other, sees a 
minimal threat from any Third World missile 
deployments, which such a view finds is not the 
most likely delivery system for nuclear weapons in 
any case. And, where such weapons already exist or 
are likely to be developed, this view finds 
development and deployment of a strategic defense 
system facing unsolved technical risk and uncertain 
countermeasures -- and cost.
     To put the issue of missile threats and defenses in 
focus, Military Space here details the work of two 
groups that have exhaustively researched the subject, 
the Missile Defense Study Team of the Heritage 
Foundation and the scientist members of the Union 
of Concerned Scientists. 
     In this part, we will look at the missile threat; in 
part II the types of defenses proposed and how space 
elements are factored in each scenario.

**I. What Missile?

     The Heritage study looked at the existing 
documentation from unclassified and grey-literature 
sources. The team concluded that ballistic missiles 
"represent a major threat to civilian populations and 
military forces." 
     To back up that claim, the team reviewed the 
CIA's 1995 report of its Nonproliferation Center. 
That report stated 20 nations, by conservative 
estimate, currently have or are developing weapons 
of mass destruction and ballistic missile delivery 
systems. 
     Half of these nations, the CIA reported, were in 
the Middle East and South Asia. Five countries, 
North Korea, Iran, Iraq, Libya and Syria, posed the 
greatest danger to the West based on what the agency 
described as "the aggressive nature of their weapons 
programs." 
     All five nations either had ballistic missiles or 
were in the process of developing them.
     This program of missile deployment was 
proceeding so briskly, the Heritage team said, 
through a combination of indigenous technology 
development as well as the purchase of space launch 
vehicles for reportedly civil uses. Much of the 
technology of payload launchers has applications to 
carry weapons such as warhead reentry vehicles. In 
addition, the flight hardware of space boosters and 
ballistic missiles were common to each other. 

**A viable missile threat?

      The Union of Concerned Scientists also looked at 
the emergence of the rogue missile threat. But as 
summarized in a July 7, 1995 letter to the members 
of the Senate, the Union's scientists said that the 
threat of foreign missiles "do not justify deployment 
of national missile defenses." The group said that it 
found no nation currently hostile to the United States 
"possesses ballistic missiles capable of reaching the 
United States." 
     The Union listed four types of potential ballistic 
missile attacks that should be addressed. They 
consisted of accidental launch of Russian or Chinese 
ICBMs, a deliberate nuclear attack by Russia or 
China, deliberate attack by another country or a 
deliberate missile attack by a terrorist organization. In 
all cases, the Union determined a deployed NMD 
system as "not an appropriate or effective response" 
to counter such threats. 
     The Heritage group did not agree. It found the 
evidence of missile development abundant. First, it 
cited the purchase by Saudi Arabia of Chinese CSS-
2 missiles, each with a 2,000- mile range. This was 
proof enough, it claimed, that missile technology 
was proliferating. Next the group cited Iraqi tests of 
ICBM configurations, and the United Nations' belief 
that prior to the Gulf War Iraq was 18-months away 
from having atomic weapons. 
     Most troubling, and contentious, was the issue of 
the viability of the North Korean Taepo Dong 2 
ICBM, the most advanced system being developed 
by a Third World nation.
     Heritage quoted then-Deputy Defense Secretary 
John  Deutch as telling Congress in August 1994 
that the TD2 "may be able to strike U.S. territory by 
the end of the decade." Such a capability, it was 
noted, would come less than five years after its 
discovery by U.S. intelligence.

**Scud or no Scud?

      The Union's scientists were also mindful that 
actual deployment of the TD2 was speculative at 
best, and even under the most optimistic timetable 
would not actually threaten U.S. soil for years. The 
CIA confirmed such estimates last summer. 
     The Defense Intelligence Agency reported last fall 
that the TD2 would have a range only of 4650 miles, 
using a nuclear warhead sized for its lifting power. 
But the DIA also said a smaller yield warhead 
mounted on the missile would extend its range to 
more than 6,000 miles. It was just this modified 
configuration that Arizona Republican Sen. John Kyl 
quoted South Korean intelligence as detecting. 
     The intel sources, Kyl said, have discovered 
North Korea was furiously making technical 
improvements to both missile and warhead designs 
in configurations that could reach all major U.S. 
cities on the west coast plus those of Europe. 
     Others in the U.S. intelligence community 
dismissed both the TD2 and any accelerated 
program. The missile was still "basically a glorified 
Scud," one analyst said, and without a guidance 
system or upper stage can't threaten any specific site. 
     The CIA and the DoD considered the accuracy of 
the TD2 so poor many within the agencies wondered 
what the fuss was about. 
     But other pointed out that if proliferation was as 
prevalent as feared, missile programs like the TD2 
would not stay static. "Even the V-2 became a 
launch vehicle", one industry source told Military 
Space.
     Part II Which Defense? Will compare the types 
of NMD systems under study, along with their 
ground, air and space-based elements, and the risks 
the Union of Concerned Scientists saw associated 
with each.
     Editor's Note: a full document bibliography will 
follow part II for subscribers' files.

Milstar sends first crosslinked message

      Less than six weeks after the second Milstar 
satellite was orbited, the pair of advanced military 
communications satellites were crosslinked to 
transmit a history-making test message from the 
chairman, the Joint Chiefs of Staff. 
     That successful space exchange ranks as an 
important a space milestone as the first use of an 
orbiting ECHO satellite to transmit greetings to 
Earth by President Dwight D. Eisenhower on the 
afternoon of Aug. 13, 1960.

**Satellite-to-satellite crosslinks

      The military space "handshake" took place when 
the written message, signed by Joint Chiefs 
chairman Gen. John M. Shalikashvili, was uplinked 
to Milstar 1 from the National Military Command 
Center, Fort Belvoir, Va., at 10:52 p.m. EST Dec. 
15. 
     Milstar 1's crosslink dish antenna was used to 
process and relay the message signal to Milstar 2 
orbiting in the same plane. Milstar 2 then 
downlinked the message to the U.S. Pacific 
Command, Camp Smith, Hawaii, and to the U.S. 
Atlantic Command, Norfolk, Va. 
     Each Milstar spacecraft incorporates two 
crosslink dish antennas located at opposite ends of 
the rectangular satellite bus. These will eventually be 
used to connect the four operational Milstar satellites 
to form a self-contained, secure space constellation 
that can be controlled from a single fixed- or mobile-
site.

**Unique Milstar technologies

      The Milstar system remains unique to military 
space communications technology. The signals 
processing system operates in the extremely high-
frequency (EHF) and super high -frequency (SHF) 
bands. Technologies in on-board signal processing, 
on-board signal routing, on-board resource control, 
crossbanding and crosslinking are space-born 
capabilities unique in the Milstar series. 
     The satellites are designed to display immunity to 
jamming and signal interception, possible in part by 
the satellite's ability to move transmissions from 
frequency to frequency across the full 2 GHz 
bandwidth.

**Block II satellites planned

      The first in the series was launched Feb. 7, 1994 
with the second orbited Nov. 6, 1995, both aboard 
Titan IV boosters. Air Force launch plans call for full 
operational use of the Block I units now in space, 
with the second satellite completing testing and 
becoming fully operational later this year.
      But in 1999 a Titan IVB is scheduled to launch 
four additional Block II satellites that will feature 
both the low data rate system now on the first 
generation as well as a medium data rate, tactical 
communications payload package. The four Block II 
vehicles will eventually replace the pair of Block Is 
now in service. 
     Each Milstar spacecraft, the largest military 
satellites ever launched, has an on-orbit life of 10 
years.

AIA's Fuqua: Aerospace recovery under way

     Despite falling sales in 1995, the Aerospace 
Industries Assn. sees the industry riding toward 
growth in 1996. 
     If this forecast is correct, it would mark the first 
year of positive numbers for the aerospace industry 
since 1991. "The light we see at the end of the tunnel 
is not an oncoming train," AIA president Don Fuqua 
said last month at the group's annual year-end review 
in Washington. "It is the light of a new dawn for the 
aerospace industry, the herald of an era of stability 
and exceptional promise," he said. 

**1996 sales to rise-but DoD dollars will drop

      AIA anticipates industry sales will rise 3.2% to a 
total $111 billion this year. The jump will come from 
a surge in airline sales, projected to be about $7 
billion. 
     Sales to the DoD will continue to decline, 
however, with a $3 billion drop in 1966. Also sales 
to other federal agencies will drop by $213 million. 
     The turnaround overall will be led by a rise in 
civil aircraft, engines and parts, with a 24% growth 
expected in 1996 to $5.6 billion. 
     Civil helicopter sales will also grow, AIA said, 
some 18% to $268 million. But the biggest increase 
expected in this year will be in space-sector sales, 
with a whopping $1 billion rise, to annual sales 
projected of $28 billion. 
     American space launchers and satellites are 
driving that growth, Fuqua said. 

**Declines continue in military weaponry

      As in years past, cuts in defense acquisitions will 
cause weapons procurements to drop. Missiles sales 
will fall 23% to $5.7 billion, military aircraft will 
drop $1.4 billion to annual sales of $30 billion, and 
overall aerospace/defense employment will decline 
2%, from its 1995 totals, to 763,000 workers. 
     Production workers will number 243,000, a loss 
of 6,000 job. Scientist and engineer slots fell in 1995 
by 6%; technician slots declined by 7%. 
     Overall industry net profit after taxes fell 20% to 
$4.5 billion following a 1994 record high. Despite 
these reductions, Fuqua said aerospace profits are 
expected to surpass the margins generated by all 
manufacturing industries combined.
     Since 1989, total aerospace industry employment 
has dropped a staggering 42%. The pattern of these 
declines was cited by outgoing Lockheed Martin 
CEO Daniel Tellup. He told a Washington press 
briefing, prior to the release of the AIA numbers, he 
expected the decline of the aerospace/defense 
industry to slow in 1996, but a full upswing was still 
waiting in the wings. 
     Tellup, as did Fuqua, said the best areas for 
profits in defenses were in servicing existing 
systems and weapons programs, with tailor-made 
upgrade programs and small, system-by-system 
enhancements. Production of replacement systems 
won't involve major operations. 
     For 1996, the Clinton administration had plans to 
buy no new tanks, only four new warships and only 
127 military aircraft, including helicopters and 
transport planes.
     Military space dollars were concentrated in the 
final phases of large programs like DSCS and Titan 
IV and the beginnings of SBIR, EELV and SMTS. 
     Jointness as a policy element, and widening 
awareness of the need for using space assets fully in 
the battlefield environment, also were strong drivers 
for space in the defense sector -- although not in the 
size of dollar numbers as say military aircraft or 
missiles. 
     But total R&D proposed as a part of the DoD 
new budget authority in fiscal year 1996 shrank to 
14%, dropping more to 11% by 1999. 
     The Congressional Budget Office reports the 
administration remains about $101 billion short of 
the amounts needed for a fully modernized Bottom-
Up Review force, a fact not addressed by either 
Clinton or the Republican Congress. 
     From FYs 1996 through 2002, defense budgets 
projected by both side decline an average of 20% 
from FY 1995 spending.

The Editor's Notebook: Issues and answers in 
defense & space ...
Remembering a warrior's legacy

      When all has been written about the defense 
policies of the late 20th century, what will be the 
issues that will linger to stir America?
     One that will likely remain is the question of a 
Revolution in Military Affairs, and the exact form 
that such an RMA might take. A second is likely to 
be the endless debate over ballistic missile threats, 
defenses, and the costs and timetables for each, real 
or imagined, needed or not. 
     A third issue likely to remain to haunt some 
future defense secretary is the cost of space launch, 
and the many ways to make space transportation 
affordable and accessible to military spacecraft and 
public researchers. 
     If it is true that the resolution of these latter issues 
will shape the security and viability of America's 
industrial base and its future as a great power, then 
history will surely remember the life and legacy of 
Daniel O. Graham, who died New Year's Eve at 70.

**He saw the 'High Frontier'

      Graham will most likely be remembered as the 
founder of High Frontier, the association of 
scientists, scholars and strategists determined to craft 
a comprehensive ballistic missile defense against the 
Soviet Union at the Cold War's climax. 
     In his role as High Frontier's director, Graham 
became a familiar figure in Washington meetings, 
hearings and press conferences, urging American 
policymakers to marshall the technological will to 
banish forever the dread of nuclear attack. 

**The legacy of 'Team B'

      But much less known to the public - and more 
important to history - was the reason behind much of 
Graham's determined support for what became later 
the Strategic Defense Initiative. 
     Some 20 years ago a great debate raged within the 
defense establishment over the strength and purposes 
of Soviet military intentions. To forge what was 
considered by some to be a more realistic picture of 
the Russian bear's embrace, the CIA chartered a team 
of government and industry experts and thinkers to 
see what the USSR might do with military 
superiority. 
     Graham, who was then the director, the Defense 
Intelligence Agency, was a member of that "Team 
B" group. He gathered what he would call later 
"exhaustive" documentation of the depths of the 
unmatched threat from Soviet weapons programs 
flourishing under "detente." He knew then what the 
risks were to an unprotected America, exposed in the 
late 1970s and early 1980s to the threat of Soviet 
missiles.
     Graham's later concept of a "defense that 
defends" was an effort to repel that threat. 
     A quarter century after the Team B report, the fall 
of the Soviet state, the rise of Russian Communism 
and missile proliferation, there is still no consensus 
on how to defend the nation against missile attack. 
And Graham's idea of a space-born shield of 
protection remains, for the time, only on paper.
     So, too, does languish the idea of truly affordable 
space transportation, with more studies than 
spaceships the product of America's labs. Here, too, 
Graham played a key role in defining the issue. In 
1990 he founded the Space Transportation 
Association to push the military and NASA to look 
anew at a bold concept for a single stage launcher, a 
true spaceship. 
     He haunted the halls of the Pentagon and 
Congress, calling for a rational review of America's 
launch capabilities. His work finally paid off in the 
unique Delta Clipper, single-stage prototype vehicle, 
started first by the Strategic Defense Initiative 
Program, and later by NASA, that awarded Graham 
its Distinguished Service Award last year for his 
work on space launch. 
     But the Clipper remains only a test program, and 
the follow-on X rockets mired in budget woes and 
acrimony. Like the issue of strategic defense, 
promising beginnings, made possible in part by 
Graham's advocacy, have not been followed by a 
matching vision of policymakers -- at least not yet.
     But when the moment finally comes, early in the 
21st century, when a single-stage spaceship returns 
to a free port from orbit, it will have been powered, 
in part, by the ideas of that retired Army General 
who would not take "no" for an answer. 
     And there will also come a time when missiles no 
longer threaten American skies. When ballistic 
missiles will have but one purpose: to launch small 
satellites, not warheads. When that age comes to 
America, her children will owe the peace that comes 
with stability to Graham's vision of SDI, an idea for 
which time might finally have come. 
     A stampede to orbit, and quiet in the heavens: 
fitting legacies to Daniel Graham, who gave 
testament to relentless truth. It took, not an admiral 
of the seas or an aviator of the skies but an Army 
General to, not unquietly, find security by sailing

     He will be remembered ... and missed.

Milspace Launch Notes

      OSC says that tests of the Pegasus XL/Rex II on 
Feb. 10 will determine the final launch date of this 
return to flight mission. But it won't be earlier than 
Feb. 15, OSC spokeswoman Elania Furhman told 
Military Space.
     The Russian military launched the IRS-1C Dec. 
28 aboard a Cosmos booster. Along with the 
primary payload the Skipper satellite was also 
inserted into orbit. 
     A joint project of the BMD program office and 
the Moscow Aviation Institute, Skipper will simulate 
ICBM reentry vehicles and will test aerobraking 
technology. 
     The payload's instrumentation was built by Utah 
State University's Space Dynamics Lab. It will be 
deorbited over Kwajalein Island in about a week.
     A Delta booster lifted the NASA-Goddard XTE 
science satellite into orbit December 30 from Cape 
Canaveral, Fla. 
***
     The Navy reported that it has completed testing 
the UHF F6 satellite and has moved it to its 
permanent orbital slot at 105.3 degrees WL. 
According to Harvard scientist Jonathan McDowell, 
who compiled the data, the original test location was 
at 171W.

Mission Control

      Rescissions are rippling across the full range of 
military space and related programs as the fiscal year 
1996 budget battle continues into mid-January ... In 
retaliation for an additional $7 billion in unrequested 
spending contained both in the earlier-signed FY 
1996 Defense Appropriations Bill and the vetoed FY 
1996 Defense Authorization Bill, Defense Secretary 
Perry has ordered cuts of nearly $2 billion to 
approved programs as partial offsets.      Some 
rescission cuts have already been imposed on such 
projects as military satellites (SBIR, SMTS and 
Milstar), launchers (Titan IV), and weapons (ASAT 
studies and other BMD work). 
     Although not significant reductions, the 
rescissions will, nonetheless, play havoc with 
program schedules planned for the New Year.
***
     Remembering a legend ... In the aftermath of the 
passing of Adm. Arleigh Burke, many in 
Washington remember the "sailor's sailor" as a 
major, driving force behind the Navy's Polaris 
missile program -- but in a measured way typical of 
the crafty old salt. 
     Burke supported Polaris, but remained 
determined that the Navy never become totally 
dependent on sub-launched missiles. His Naval 
Warfare Analysis Group also moved to use Polaris 
to put the Navy at the heart of strategic issues, a 
firefight at the time with the Air Force. 
     He was adroit at using his political power 
carefully, cementing a "place in the strategic sun," as 
one author described him, for the newly nuclear 
Navy.
