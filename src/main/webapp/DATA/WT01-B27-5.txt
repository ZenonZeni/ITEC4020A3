<p><b>HON. GERALD B.H. SOLOMON OF NEW YORK</b> </p>

<p>in the House of Representatives </p>

<p>Thursday, March 2, 1995 </p>

<p><b>A Note to Readers: </b>If you want some current
information, direct from Europe, to compare with Mr. Solomon's
statements here, take a look at <a

<hr>

<p>Mr. SOLOMON. Mr. Speaker, let me commend to you the following
article written by a distinguished doctor and chairman of the
International Drug Strategy Institute, Eric A. Voth, M.D. Dr.
Voth advocates retaining tough drug laws to guard against rising
crime and experimentation. Citing Holland as an example, the
legalization of drugs has resulted in greatly increased crime and
addiction. The only way to combat the increase of drug use in
this country is to stand firm against recent attempt by prodrug
groups to mute public awareness. These groups attempt to disguise
the dangers of drug abuse and consequently jeopardize future
generations. </p>

<p>REPEATING HISTORY'S MISTAKES </p>

<p>The international drug policy debate rages regarding decisions
whether to fundamentally change drug policy toward legalization
or decriminalization of drug use, or to remain with restrictive
policies. If we examine two examples of softening of drug policy,
we will find ample reason to continue with restrictive policy. </p>

<p>In the mid to late 1970's during the Carter administration,
drug policy visibly softened. Several states decriminalized
marijuana, and in fact Alaska legalized marijuana. Drug policy
`specialists' in their infinite wisdom supported the flawed
concept called `responsible use' of drugs as a way that users
could maintain personal use of drugs and avoid the ravages of
addiction and physical problems. </p>

<p>Permissive drug policy originated with organizations like the
National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws. President
Carter's drug policy advisor Peter Bourne, as well as others like
Arnold Trebach, Mathea Falco, Peter Reuter, Mark Kleiman helped
to press for the lenient policy. </p>

<p>Interestingly, during that time the use of marijuana and other
drugs drastically increased. Use also increased in adolescents
despite the fact that drugs never become legal or decriminalized
for that age group. The use of marijuana among high school
students in Oregon during decriminalization was double that of
the national average. National averages of marijuana use among
high school seniors increased to 50% of seniors having used in
the previous year, and 10.7% used daily. </p>

<p>Ultimately, parents began to object to the rampant use of
drugs , especially marijuana, among their children. In the early
1980's the `parents' anti-drug movement began. Because of the
drastic failure of lenient drug policies, steady pressure was
exerted at national and local levels for restrictive drug
policies. A huge national wave of high quality research,
grassroots prevention organizations, and tightening of drug laws
began. </p>

<p>Predictably, the use of drugs among `recreational' users
dropped. High school seniors use of marijuana dropped to 23% of
seniors using within the last year and 2% using on a daily basis.
The use among hard addicts did not drop. Strangely the cry has
been sounded by some that the drug war did not work. That outcry,
however, was almost exclusively being sounded by individuals who
favored legalization or decriminalization back in the 1970's. The
same individuals who called for soft policy in the earlier era
are calling for the new harm reduction policy today. Hidden
within such policy is the intent to gain decriminalization of
drugs . </p>

<p>Holland has decriminalized drugs and tried harm reduction.
Since the softening of drug policy there, shootings have
increased 40%, robberies 62%, and car thefts 62%. This experiment
which was meant to decrease organized crime has resulted in an
increase in organized crime families from 3 in 1988 to 93 today. </p>

<p>The number of registered marijuana addicts has risen 30% and
the number of other addicts has risen 22%. </p>

<p>The major difference between today and the 1970's is that the
prolegalization effort is more organized and better funded. The
millionaire Richard Dennis from Chicago has given millions to the
drug legalization effort. Billionaire George Soros has given $6
million to the Drug Policy Foundation to help seek legalization
of drugs . He created the Open Society Fund which in turn funds
Mathea Falco's Drug Strategies organization. Steadily, these
groups put a happy and acceptable face on the idea of drug
legalization or decriminalization. </p>

<p>Their public relation campaign has softened public attitudes.
Moves such as full page ads in national newspapers suggesting
alternatives to drug policy are examples. Organized efforts at
such ideas as hemp as a fiber alternative, medical marijuana,
needle exchanges, therapeutic LSD, and others pervade the media.
The Internet is bristling with pro-drug talk groups discussing
recent drug experiences and how and where to obtain drugs . </p>

<p>In the face of these facts, the holdovers from the 70's drug
policy makers are still asking for lenient drug laws. A
substantial number of today's addicts started their use under the
lenient policies of the 1970's. We have had our experience with
decriminalization, and it is time that we recognize it and put
that concept to bed. </p>

<p>The only hope for drug policy is a concerted effort of drug
prevention which upholds the notion of no drug use, drug
interdiction, and drug treatment. If we soften our hold on an
already vexing problem, we will lose the war. </p>
