<TITLE>Climate Change Fact Sheet 201</TITLE>

<H1>How policy-makers<BR>
are responding<BR>
to global climate change</H1>
<HR>
<B>The first time climate change was recognized as a serious problem by a major 
intergovernmental meeting was in 1979.</B> <A HREF = 
"fs213.html">The First World Climate Conference</A>, held in 
February of that year, was an important scientific event. It issued a declaration calling on 
the world's governments "to foresee and prevent potential man-made changes in climate 
that might be adverse to the well-being of humanity."<P>
<B>A large number of international conferences on climate change have been 
convened since then.</B> Attended by government policy-makers, scientists, and 
environmental groups, they have addressed both scientific and policy issues. Important 
meetings have been held in <A HREF = 
"fs215.html">Toronto</A>, <A HREF = 
"fs217.html">the Hague</A>, <A HREF = 
"fs218.html">Noordwijk</A>, <A HREF = 
"fs220.html">Bergen</A>, and elsewhere.  <A HREF = 
"fs221.html">The Second World Climate Conference</A>, held 
in 1990 in Geneva, was a particularly crucial step towards a binding global convention on 
climate change. Some of these meetings have taken place under the auspices of the United 
Nations and its specialized agencies. Others have been held within regional and global fora 
such as the European Community, the Commonwealth, and the South Pacific Forum, or 
have been convened by individual governments. A number of meetings have been 
dedicated to <A HREF = "fs203.html">the particular concerns 
of small island states</A> and of <A HREF = 
"fs204.html">developing countries</A>.<P>
<B>The <A HREF = "fs250.html">1992 UN Framework 
Convention on Climate Change</A> is the first binding international legal 
instrument to address the issue specifically</B>.1 Adopted after 15 months of intensive 
negotiations within the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee for a Framework 
Convention on  Climate Change (INC/FCCC - see fact sheet 209), it was opened for 
signature in Rio de Janeiro at the June 1992 <A HREF = 
"fs207.html">UN Conference on Environment and Development 
(UNCED)</A>. The INC negotiators drew on the First Assessment Report of the <A 
HREF = "fs208.html">Intergovernmental Panel on Climate 
Change (IPCC)</A>, a body established jointly by the <A HREF = 
"fs206.html">United Nations Environment Programme 
(UNEP)</A> and the <A HREF = "fs206.html">World 
Meteorological Organization (WMO)</A>. They were also influenced by the Ministerial 
Declaration issued by the Second World Climate Conference and by policy statements 
adopted by numerous other climate conferences. The Convention incorporates a number 
of <A HREF = "fs202.html">newly emerging legal 
principles</A> that had been developed or affirmed by various climate conferences.<P>
<B>The Convention will provide a general framework for addressing the climate 
change issue . . .</B> The Convention was signed by 154 states and the European 
Community during UNCED. Other states have signed since then, and some national 
legislatives have ratified.  It will enter into force after it has been ratified by 50 states. In 
the meantime, states are expected to start working towards the aims set by the Convention 
on a voluntary basis.<P>
<B>. . . but much work remains to be done.</B> States must now strive to ensure that 
the Convention enters into force as soon as possible. At the same time, government 
experts must decide whether to adopt additional measures in future annexes and protocols 
to the Convention. These protocols may set out more specific commitments, such as 
timetables for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.<P>
<B>Even before the Convention was adopted, some countries had already taken 
unilateral action at the national level.</B> Most OECD member states have set 
national targets for stabilizing or reducing their emissions of greenhouse gases.2 In 1990, 
the <A HREF = "fs211.html">Council of the European 
Communities (EC)</A> adopted a policy that provides for stabilizing the emissions of 
carbon dioxide - the most significant greenhouse gas - at 1990 levels by the year 2000. 
A strategy to limit carbon dioxide emissions and to improve energy efficiency is currently 
being elaborated by the EC Commission.<P>
<B>In addition, two other international environmental treaties address climate 
change indirectly.</B> The amended 1987 Montreal Protocol on Substances That 
Deplete the Ozone Layer legally obliges its parties to phase out chlorofluorocarbons 
(CFCs) by the year 1996 (fact sheet 224). Although inspired by concern over the 
destruction of the ozone layer, this protocol is significant also for climate change since 
CFCs are greenhouse gases. Similarly, the <A HREF = 
"fs225.html">1979 Geneva Convention on Long-Range 
Transboundary Air Pollution</A> and its protocols regulate the emission of noxious 
gases, some of which are precursors of greenhouse gases. These treaties, however, do not 
address the complex set of inter-related climate issues.<P>
