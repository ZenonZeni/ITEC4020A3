CONGRESSIONAL MEMBER ORGANIZATIONS ARE VALUABLE INFO SOURCES

Congressional member organizations-including caucuses and 
informal groups-can be valuable information resources for the 
savvy business researcher, yielding wealths of foreign and 
domestic industry, regional, and other intelligence.
 
Currently 165 such groups grace Capitol Hill and although the 
member Senators and Representatives themselves are generally tough 
to approach, all have at least one-often several-staff members 
who are highly approachable.
 
The level of cooperation with which you'll be greeted will vary.  
In many cases you'll encounter an open-door to virtually all the 
information on hand and available to members themselves.
 
In other cases, your caucus staff contact may simply be a 
launching pad, referring you to his stable of information 
resources on Capitol Hill, in government agencies, and in private 
sector organizations.
 
In some cases, you'll find that the group from which you're 
soliciting information will have actually published reports.  
While these were likely prepared for internal distribution, modest 
persuasion can often pry them loose.
 
On pages 4-5 of this issue of THE INTERNATIONAL INFORMATION REPORT 
you'll find a directory of "Congressional Member Organizations with 
International Focus."  We've divided the entries into two categories:
 
Those with direct foreign interests, such as a focus on a specific 
foreign country or region, and 
 
Those with indirect foreign interests, such as industry-oriented 
caucuses that are concerned with-for example-competition from 
abroad.
 
For each, we provide contact information including at least one 
staff member directly concerned with caucus interests.

MEXICO CHANGES TELECOMMUNICATIONS LAW

Mexico has revamped its telecommunications regulatory authority and 
laws governing telephone and broadcasting companies.  The changes 
have major impacts on U.S. and other firms seeking to participate in 
these service industries.  An increase in foreign ownership limits 
and authority to privatize the satellite industry are but two of many 
key changes.
 
A FREE report on the changes, SPECIAL REPORT ON MEXICO:  1995 FEDERAL 
TELECOMMUNICATIONS LAW AND REORGANIZATION OF THE SECRETARIA DE 
COMUNICACIONES Y TRANSPORTES, is available from the Planning and 
Negotiations Division, International Bureau, Federal Communications 
Commission, 2000 M Street, N.W., Washington, DC  20554, 202-418-2150.
