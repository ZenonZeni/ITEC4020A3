<B>Project Title:  Brush Testing for Magnetically Levitated Trains<p>
Performing Organization:  American MAGFV Technology, Inc., Parker Kinetic Designs, Inc.; University of Texas at Austin, Center for Electromechanics</B><p>

<P>POC: Tony Morris, Telephone (404) 428­2900</P>

<P><B>Program Summary: </B></P> 


<P>The purpose of this project is to design and construct a high speed (300 mph) commutated brush
tester using as much existing hardware as possible at UT/CEM Next. we were to measure brush wear
rates and characterize brush behavior of a commercial brush material (from Morganite CMIS). of
advanced fiber brushes (from Dr. Doris Kuhlman-Wilsdorf, University of Virginia), and of homopolar
pulsed consolidated copper/graphite brush material (from UT/CEM) under commutated current
conditions and speed similar to predicted operating conditions on a Magler Train. The goal of the
project was to determine what set of brush material and operating conditions should be used as design
parameters for future rush commutated Maglev trains to provide acceptable wear life. </P>

<P>The potential benefit of conducting this test program, and carrying it further as recommended above, is
to enable the advanced cost effective magnetically levitated train concept currently under development
by American Maglev to come to fruition. Additionally, advances in brush wear behavior resulting from
this testing program will substantially improve the behavior and efficiency of other brushed electrical
machines such as continuous duty homopolar traction motors for electric vehicle applications. </P>

<P><B>DELIVERABLES:</B></P>

<P>The deliverable for this program is a final report detailing the design, construction, and testing results of
the high speed commutated brush test system.</P>

<P><B>SCHEDULE:</B>
</P><P>The project is complete as proposed (8/95).
