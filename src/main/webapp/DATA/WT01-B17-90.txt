Gammalin-olenic acid (GLA) from borage seed taken in capsule form,
reduced tenderness in joints by 36% and other key pain indicators
in rheumatoid arthritis by 28-45% compared to zero improvement
in patients taking a placebo. GLA is an essential fatty acid in
the omega-6 and omega-3 oil families which are gaining a reputation
for treating inflammations. Dosage for GLA was 1.4g daily which
produced noticeable reduction in pain and swelling within 6 weeks.

A survey of 13,981 elderly residents of an upper-income retirement
community in California revealed that those who kept  high levels
of beta-carotene and vitamin C in their diets developed less bladder
cancer during a 4 year period.  Researchers studied what the elderly
(average age 74, 75% women) were eating; they all started out
cancer-free and relatively healthy.
<P>
After 4 years, about 10% of the study group developed cancer,
but for the other 90% who didn't, researchers found that dietary
vitamin C from fruits and vegetables had a preventive, anticancer
effect against all forms of cancer in women. For men, it was effective
against colon cancer alone.

A 1985 Japanese study showed that daily injections of lentinan,
a component of shiitake mushrooms, resulted in rapid improvement
in many of the conditions associated with chronic fatigue syndrome
(CFS). A follow-up study of 23 CFS patients ages 14-77 showed
that lentinan treatment brought one key immune system indicator
back into normal range within 6 months. Physicians had the same
results using oral lentinan in quantities of 5 mg per dose, which
is about 5 times the intravenous dosage.
<P>
Fresh and dried shiitake mushrooms are widely available in natural
foods stores and as supplements. For therapeutic purposes, it's
advisable to use dried or powdered isolate shiitake as lentinan
represents only 0.88 to 1.17mg per 6-8 grams of shiitake.

Studies show that if, the minute you feel a cold or flu coming
on, you take the herb 
<I>
Echinacea purpurea 
</I>
extract at the daily
rate of about 900mg for the next 10-14 days, you greatly reduce
your chance of having the full-blown condition.  
<P>
In a study of 180 volunteers, ages 18-60, all of whom had influenza,
those taking 900mg of Echinacea extract every day had a reduction
in their flu symptoms including weakness, low energy, chills,
sweating, sore throat, muscle aches, and headaches.  In another
study, with 108 subjects taking Echinacea for 8 weeks had a decreased
frequency of colds and flu. They had a greater length of time
between infections (40 days versus 25 days for placebo), and for
78% of them, when they did get another cold, their symptoms were
milder.

Mrs. A. was a 90 year old resident of a nursing home who started
to get necrotic ulcers on her toes. Her skin was turning green
from gangrene from her toes to her ankle. Some years before she'd
had one leg amputated below the knee for diabetic gangrene and
her doctors told her it was happening all over again and she might
have to have the other leg severed, too. Lucky for her a skilled
aromatherapist named Paul Emeny took up her case.
<P>
Emeny applied tea tree oil directly to the skin ulcers by way
of light dressings soaked in the oil.  Almost at once Mrs. A's
pain diminished and some of the greenish coloration went away.
Then, during 3 week intervals, Emeny applied tea tree oil mixed
with olive oil in reducing percentages (10%, 5%, 3%) to keep her
skin moist and to ensure slow absorption. After 9 weeks, the discoloration
went away and life returned to the foot that previously had been
cold to the touch. 
<P>
Six months after the start of treatment, Mrs. A's surgeon was
astonished to see that the gangrene had cleared up and no surgery
was needed.

It's estimated that 10% of American children have some form of
behavioral or learning disability. For these unfortunate children
the routine answer is Ritalin or Dexedrine, a kind of biochemical
straightjacket that is now taken by hundreds of thousands of children.
<P>
But homeopathy has an alternative treatment for kids who bounce
off the walls and act up in class, says homeopath Judyth Reichenberg-Ullman,
N.D., M.S.W, director of the Northwest Center for Homeopathic
Medicine in Edmonds, Washington.
<P>
Ben, age 5,  was worse than rambunctious. He was disobedient and
defiant; he often got hysterical and would shout, cry, yell,
throw things, hit children, push them around, get suddenly violent,
and he always had to be in charge. His bones ached, he had painful
warts, he often had ear infections and had taken a lot of antiobiotics
by the time his homeopath treated him.
<P>
A single dose of homeopathic Cina, made from the flower wormseed,
completely turned Ben around. Almost overnight he became a model
boy: &quot;He is terrific, as perfect as a boy can be,&quot; declared
his mother.
<P>
Jimmy, age 9, was an abused boy. His parents were alcoholics who
either beat him or ignored him; most of the time he lived in a
foster home. In school, his teachers described him as a disruptive
trouble-maker. He constantly hummed, sang, and twiddled; at night,
he tossed and turned; he was always impatient, over-active, and
restless.
<P>
Yet a single dose of homeopathic Veratrum album, made from the
flower white hellebore, changed all this in 2 days. It was as
if he were a completely new boy.

For this life change, the hot flashes of menopause are one of
the most unpleasant symptoms, but homeopathy has effective remedies
as these two cases show.
<P>
A woman, age 47, started having irregular menstruation and very
troubling hot flashes at night. They woke her up every 2 hours
with a crawling sensation in her nose, hotness in her cheeks,
and sticky perspiration all over her chest. Sometimes she felt
she would faint from the nausea that the flashes brought.  
<P>
Belgian homeopath Henny Heudens-Mast gave her one  strong dose
of homeopathic Kali 
<I>
bichromicum 
</I>
(made from potassium and chromium)
that immediately eliminated the symptoms. Six months later they
returned but were much milder; but after one more dose of this
remedy they went away for good.
<P><A NAME="Lache"> </A>
Another woman, age 46, complained of hormonal imbalance, mood
swings, and severe hot flashes. She broke out in drenching sweats,
was depressed, exhausted, and prone to crying. Her menstrual cycle
first became irregular then stopped.
<P>
After Corinne Rovetti, M.S.N., a nurse-homeopath, prescribed one
dose of homeopathic Lachesis 200c which is made from Bushmaster
snake venom, her symptoms disappeared and colleagues at work found
her a changed woman. Over the following year, her menstruation
gradually returned as she occasionally took more 
<I>
Lachesis, 
</I>
as prescribed.

Belgian homeopath Guy Kokelenberg treated a young boy with a stammering
problem with one dose of homeopathic Baryta carbonica 200C (a
carbonate of the mineral barium). The next day the boy's mother
brought in a glass jar with a one yard long roundworm that her
son had evacuated the previous evening in his bowels. He never
stammered again.

St. John's Wort (Hypericum perforatum), a lovely plant with yellow
flowers that has been used medicinally for 2000 years, now emerges
as an effective agent in reducing mild to moderate depression. In one study, 
105 patients under care for depression took 900mg
of St. John's Wort daily for 4 weeks, then were evaluated according
to standard psychological tests. The results showed that the herb
had reduced the amount and intensity of depressive symptoms including
sadness, headache, poor sleep, exhaustion, and a sense of worthlessness.
