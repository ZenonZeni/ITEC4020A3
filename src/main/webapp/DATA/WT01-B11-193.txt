<B>New Partnership for Fur Management in Ontario

</B>

</CENTER><P>
Natural Resources Minister Chris Hodgson today announced that MNR will officially recognize the Ontario Fur Managers Federation (OFMF) as the provincial organization representing the interests of licensed trappers.<P>

"The Ministry will begin immediately to develop and negotiate a new business relationship with the Federation," said Mr. Hodgson.  "Partnerships such as this are an example of the government's new way of doing business.<P>  

"This partnership will continue to position Ontario as a leading jurisdiction in resource management in North America," added Mr. Hodgson.<P>

"We represent the interests of 10,500 licensed trappers in Ontario and we are committed to establishing this new business relationship with the Ministry," said Murray Monk, president of the OFMF.  "Fur harvesting in one of the oldest industries in North America, and this partnership will enable us to move fur management into the next century," Mr. Monk added.<P> 

The OFMF is a grass-roots organization made up of individual trappers, local trapper councils and a board of directors elected by trappers across the province.  The federation is committed to educating and training trappers, harvesting at sustainable levels and working with other groups to ensure the future of the trapping industry.<P>

"We want to ensure that trapping remains a vibrant and sustainable industry in Ontario, one that will continue to be naturally renewable," said Mr. Monk.<P>

"I have assigned Ron Lessard, Sault Ste. Marie District Manager to work with the federation as General Manager to assist in development of the new business relationship," Mr. Hodgson said.  The federation's head office will be in Sault Ste. Marie.<P>
