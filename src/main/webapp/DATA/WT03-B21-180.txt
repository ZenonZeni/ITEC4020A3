<P>Toronto, Ontario, February 15, 1995 ... TVX GOLD INC. ("TVX") announces that it has entered into a letter agreement to form a joint venture with SANTA FE PACIFIC GOLD CORPORATION ("Santa Fe", NYSE: GLD) to explore and develop TVX's Gurupi gold property located in the State of Maranhão, Brazil.

<P>Santa Fe can earn a 50% equity interest in the property in consideration of exploration expenditures totalling US$2 million over the next twenty-two months and property payments totalling US$1.8 million over the same period. TVX will contribute additional property payments totalling US$0.6 million.

<P>The property, which comprises approximately 31,700 hectares, is located some 350 kilometers south east of the city of Belém along the Gurupi river forming the border between the States of Pará and Maranhão. Gencor's Aurizona Property, soon to be in development, lies 120 kilometers to the north east of the property, in another trend but in a similar geologic setting. Gold occurrences in the area have been known since the early 17th century with the most recent mining and exploration activities occurring in the last fifteen years.

<P>The Gurupi shear belt is two kilometers wide and extends through the property for over twenty kilometers.  Gold is contained in volcano sedimentary rocks (tuffaceous rocks, graphitic phyllites, and volcanic conglomerates) intensely hydrothermalized and cut by sheared bands, quartz veins and veinlet zones. Two typological deposits are evident in gold works: quartz vein high grade and disseminate low grade. Channel sampling, geochemical sampling and two diamond drill rigs are ongoing on the property.

<P>Samples taken along strike over one kilometer of the shear zone in previously mined areas include 17 meters grading 1.75 gpt Au; 1 9 meters grading 1.08 gpt AU; 1 0 meters grading 1.90 gpt Au; and 19 meters grading 1.21 gpt AU - all open on both ends. Grades of 1 meter samples ranged from <0.05 gpt to 9.75 gpt.

<P>TVX Gold Inc. is a Canadian based growth oriented multinational mining company with significant existing production of precious metals from interests in six producing gold mines located in North and South America. TVX maintains its head office in Toronto, Canada, with major offices in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil and Santiago, Chile.
