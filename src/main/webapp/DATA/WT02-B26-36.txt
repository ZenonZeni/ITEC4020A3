<A NAME = "apers"><H2>A PERSONAL EXPERIENCE IN RESEARCH</H2></A><A HREF = "#top">[Return to Top]</A><br>

<P>

I am a partner in research, but not in the usual sense.  I am the research--a volunteer subject at the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), living for a year at their clinical center in Maryland.  I'm in the biological psychiatry research unit for affective disorders and participate in everything from medicine trials to PET scans, from memory and neuropsychological testing to blood and spinal-fluid testing, from MRIs to activity monitoring, from magnesium infusion studies to sleep and sleep-deprivation studies. 

<P>

Because I am a research subject, I am not given information that might affect the research results.  Most test results are blinded.  There are similarities in the patients who are selected.  We have all suffered with a bipolar I, bipolar II, or unipolar mood disorder and have tried standard treatments including medications, psychotherapy, and ECT.  Many are rapid cyclers; that is, the ups and downs of the illness cycle many times a year.  For a few, they actually cycle a couple of times a day.  Otherwise, we are all healthy people.

<P>

It would be misleading to tell you we have volunteered purely for research and the advancement of science.  Even though most of us would say, "I'm trading my time and body for research in exchange for the treatment I can't get back home," we are not as self-centered as that statement suggests.  I've seen patients go through a great deal of discomfort for research studies that will not benefit them directly.  

<P>

While NIMH allows us to refuse any test, patients try very hard to participate in them all.  For example, one patient with a phobia about small places successfully completed an MRI after several very scary attempts.  Her comment:  "I really wanted to do this because I know it's an important piece of research data."

<P>

I am 48 years old, married with no children.  I have a Masters degree and, when well, I hold a responsible marketing position with a large manufacturer of computer systems in New England.  I consider myself to be quite successful.  I also play hard whether I'm whitewater canoeing, skiing, or, before my illness, flying a small plane. 

<P>

The other patients in my group range in age from their early 20s to their mid-50s.  There are men and women--some single, some married--from all over the country.  They are well-read, bright, and knowledgeable about their illness.

<P>

Because the group is highly motivated, we've taken advantage of the resources at NIMH to learn more about our illness, particularly the weekly meeting led by our unit's research director.  After delivering the week's research schedule, he discusses research topics of interest to us, including recent discoveries.  Believe me, we get as excited as the researchers with every discovery.  Because our data are included, we take pride in the findings.  We helped, and maybe someday our help will in turn help us. 

<P>

One of the hard parts is remembering that in research some of the most exciting discoveries involve simply understanding the right questions to ask and investigate.  Many results will not become useful in treatment for a long time.

<P>

We do learn much about ourselves.  That's part of the return for volunteering.  Many of us are initially taken off meds for a "washout period."   While uncomfortable, it's often the first time in many years we've been medication-free, and it therefore provides an opportunity to re-observe our symptoms.  Sometimes it even results in a change in our diagnosis. 

<P>

Throughout the year we do ratings of mood, symptoms, and side effects several times a day.  We wear activity monitors to measure motor activity so it can be correlated with mood.  A life chart is prepared to record each participant's major life events as well as the course and treatment of the illness.  A life chart can be an eye-opener.  Some of us discover that the onset of our illness occurred much earlier than we thought, a fact that then becomes grist for future treatment.

<P>

About the future:  I anticipate leaving the program in close to a balanced state.  In my months here I've seen a number of patients discharged, and all of them were doing well when they left.  Some have had relapses, but their ups and downs aren't as intense.  With the NIMH data, their doctors at home are making treatment modifications that are generally working for them. 

<P>

And best of all, NIMH follows each of us for life; and our at-home doctors can consult with the NIMH doctors about our treatment.  We have access to the best of the best and the newest of the newest all the time.  I'm hopeful about what lies ahead.  I may not be able to continue with the demanding job I had; but I can still be productive, still be a good wife, and best of all, use the best treatments science has to offer for what looks like a lifelong illness for me.

<P>

<P>

Though the results are only preliminary, research has identified a potential new treatment for children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) that is just as effective as the controversial stimulant Ritalin and has few side effects.  The blood pressure drug Tenex significantly improved symptoms of ADHD in thirteen children and young adults, according to a study published in the January 1995 issue of the Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry. 

<P>

Parents reported significant improvements in their children's overall behavior as well as in the specific symptoms of hyperactivity, inattention, and immaturity, after one month of Tenex treatment.  Tenex had few side effects.  The children were not sedated or impaired in their functional ability. 

<P>

They became significantly less restless, frustrated, and anxious, had less excessive energy, and were better able to finish projects.  They were more attentive, able to work with less supervision, and improved in some aspects of social skills.  Patients with the highest levels of irritability and hyperactivity seemed to benefit more from Tenex treatment.  For more information, call Mickey Nall at the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, 202/966-7300.
