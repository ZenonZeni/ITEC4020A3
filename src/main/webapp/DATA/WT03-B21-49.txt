<h2> Start Your Holiday Season at Redwings </h2>

</CENTER>


<p>Redwings is having its second annual Holiday Party on Saturday, Dec. 7, 1996 at the Sanctuary. Festivities begin at 1 p.m. and last until 4 p.m.</p>

<p>Open your holiday season at Redwings. Come participate in the wine tasting, enjoy the entertainment, and taste the hors d'oeuvres. If you haven't completed your holiday shopping, we'll have a few new items along with our  fabulous line of gifts and merchandise. And, for your convenience, many of our items will be pre-wrapped! What could be easier?</p>

<p>We even offer the solution for that person or persons on your list who have it all. Consider adopting a horse, pony, or donkey in their name. We'll send a letter, certificate, and photo in time for the holidays. 
Our surprise guest of honor will arrive wearing a brilliant red suit and he isn't camera shy. For more information, call (408) 624-8464.</p>
