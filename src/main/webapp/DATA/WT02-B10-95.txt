Spectral Sciences, Inc. (SSI) is a small R&D company located in Burlington, Massachusetts which performs research, technology development, and modeling in optics and related fields. SSI's specialties include Gas Analysis Instrumentation, Laser Applications, Advanced Sensors, Atmospheric Studies, and Aerospace Experiment Planning and Data Analysis.<P>

With support from the SBIR program, SSI has developed new, patented diode, laser-based technology for sensing gaseous species. SSI has licensed this DiRTiGAS technology to Monitor Labs for pollution monitoring applications, and the two companies are jointly developing a variety of sensors for process streams and the open air.<P>

One new Monitor Labs/SSI product is an in situ monitor designed for installation in smokestacks or ducts, and is presently undergoing beta testing. For this application, the combination of diode laser spectroscopy and in-stack placement offer a unique combination of fast response, high sensitivity, and absence of interferences, and long-term, unattended operation.<P>

Several additional sensing technologies including gas-correlation, Raman, and conductive-polymer, have been developed by SSI for process control, health and safety, and meteorological applications.<P>
