(MP).- Bolivia became an associate member of Mercosur and the
official integration will take place as of next May once the
different parliaments ratify the agreements reached in the
presidential summit held in the Brazilian city of Fortaleza</strong>.
Last minute negotiations opened the doors to an understanding
which in the previous days seemed hard to reach because of the
differences with Argentina over a long list of products the
Bolivians wanted to privilege with a long term reduction of
tariffs such as textiles and agricultural commodities. &quot;<em>We're
happy with what was agreed, otherwise we wouldn't have signed</em>&quot;,
said Bolivian president Gonzalo Sánchez de Lozada, in spite of
having to step back in many of his country's original demands.
After Chile last October, and Bolivia in May, the next candidate
for an association with Mercosur is oil rich Venezuela, which has
already requested to become a member and is quiet advanced in the
negotiations. Brasilia is particularly interested in Venezuela
since Mercosur so far has only benefited the southern states of
Brazil next to Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay. With Venezuela,
(in the north of South America), many of the poor states of
north-east Brazil could have direct access to an important market
for industrial goods. Brazil is aggressively promoting industrial
investments in the area to combat poverty and also wants to
diversify its oil dependency by increasing imports from
Venezuela. </font></p>
