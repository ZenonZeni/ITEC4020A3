PRESIDENT ERNESTO ZEDILLO ANNOUNCES
CONTROVERSIAL CABINET CHANGES

    On Dec. 29, President Ernesto Zedillo announced the fifth
cabinet reshuffle of his short tenure in office.  Among the
changes is a controversial decision to appoint Arsenio Farell
Cubillas--a close ally of former president Carlos Salinas de
Gortari--to head the comptroller's office (Secretaria de la
Controlaria Nacional de la Federacion y Administracion,
Secodam).
    Farell replaced Norma Samaniego, who was in the midst of
an investigation into the financial affairs of Raul Salinas de
Gortari, the brother of ex-president Salinas.  Raul Salinas is
accused of using high-level positions in government to
illegally amass US$100 million in secret bank accounts in
Switzerland and other countries in Europe and the Americas.
Some of the allegations also tie Raul Salinas to prominent
Mexican narcotraffickers (see SourceMex, 12/06/95).
     The new charges of corruption against Raul Salinas come
on top of previous allegations that the former president's
brother masterminded the assassination of Jose Francisco Ruiz
Massieu, a high-level official of the governing Institutional
Revolutionary Party (PRI) in October 1994.  In fact, Raul
Salinas was already in federal custody, awaiting trial in the
Ruiz Massieu case when the new charges brought by Secodam and
the Attorney General's Office (PGR) were announced.
     However, Farell's appointment to replace Samaniego has
created strong skepticism that the full extent of corruption
alleged against Raul Salinas and other members of the family,
including the former president himself, will ever be known.
     As expected, Farell's appointment to head Secodam
attracted immediate protests from members of opposition
parties and independent legislators in the Chamber of
Deputies.
     "Now, with Farell, it is going to be practically
impossible for us to get the information," said Deputy Adolfo
Aguilar Zinser, an independent legislator.  "It is clear that
we will face extraordinary obstacles to carry out the
investigation."
     This charge was echoed by Juan Guerra, a deputy for the
opposition Democratic Revolution Party (PRD).
     "I think Farell is being moved into the comptroller's
office to cover up the tracks of the ex-president and his
brother in the illicit enrichment scandal," said Guerra.
     Farell served as labor secretary and as head of the
controversial government security commission under Salinas,
and he remains very close to the president.
     Some political commentators suggested that Farell was
chosen for the post to heal a split between Salinas and
Zedillo and within the PRI itself.  A major source of the
conflict has been Zedillo's willingness to publicly blame ex-
president Salinas for the devaluation of the peso in December
1994.
     Farell is said to have played a key role in trying to
sooth a public dispute between Salinas and Zedillo early in
1995, hosting a dinner for the two after Salinas ended a brief
hunger strike in March.
     Salinas has not only expressed strong resentment against
Zedillo for linking him directly to the peso devaluation, but
is also said to be very angry at the President for approving
the arrest of his brother Raul in the Ruiz Massieu case.
     Indeed, some political columnists suggest that as part of
the truce between the current and former president, Zedillo
agreed to back down on his vigorous investigation of the
Salinas family.
     "Raul Salinas has heard in prison that his family has
received guarantees of no further persecution," said columnist
Jose Urena in the daily newspaper La Jornada.  Urena, however,
gave no further details of the alleged guarantees.
     Some political columnists suggest that Farell's
appointment to Secodam, while easing tensions within the PRI,
will also further erode Zedillo's credibility.
     "This is a monumental error," said prominent columnist
Miguel Angel Granados Chapa.  "Apart from signifying a
revalidation of the Salinas system, there seems to be no logic
in his appointment."
     Despite all the criticisms, the Zedillo administration
attempted to cast a positive light on Farell's appointment.
     "The new head of Secodam, with his ample knowledge of the
law and ample government experience, will expedite the
modernization of the federal government and take stronger and
more efficient action toward preventing and combating
corruption," the administration said in a prepared statement.
     The controversy over Farell's nomination as head of
Secodam appeared to overshadow Zedillo's appointment of
economist Jesus Reyes Heroles to head the Energy Secretariat
(SE), replacing Ignacio Pichardo Pagaza.  Unlike the Farell
case, this appointment was met with very little opposition,
and in fact was applauded by opposition legislators because of
Pichardo's departure from office.
     Pichardo, who was considered a member of the so-called
"dinosaurs" or "old guard" of the PRI, will be reassigned to
a yet-to-be-determined diplomatic post.
     Reyes Heroles, who leaves his post as director of the
national public works bank (Banco Nacional de Obras Publicas,
BANOBRAS), obtained a degree in economics from the
Massachussets Institute of Technology (MIT).  According to an
official statement, Reyes will "oversee the expansion and
modernization of Mexico's energy sector."  Among other things,
Reyes will play a key role in the privatization of the
country's petrochemical plants, which are currently operated
by the state-run oil company PEMEX.
     Among other minor changes announced by Zedillo in the
December cabinet reshuffle was the appointment of Carlos
Almada Lopez as his chief government spokesperson, replacing
Carlos Salomon Camara.  This was partly seen as a move by the
president to spruce up his image.  Salomon was widely
criticized for rocky relations with the Mexican news media.
Meantime, Samaniego, who left the post as head of Secodam, was
named as a special adviser to Zedillo.
     With the changes announced in late December, Zedillo has
replaced almost one-half of his original cabinet.  The most
prominent departure was Jaime Serra Puche as finance
secretary, who received a large share of the blame for the
devaluation of the peso (see SourceMex, 02/08/95).
     Another major departure last year was that of Zedillo's
close ally Esteban Moctezuma, who left the post of interior
secretary in mid-1995.  According to political analysts,
Moctezuma had proven ineffective in dealing with a number of
crisis situations affecting the government, such as the lack
of progress on talks with the Zapatista National Liberation
Army (EZLN) in Chiapas and the failed efforts to reach
agreement with the two largest opposition parties on political
reforms.
     The resignation in mid-1995 of then-public education
secretary Fausto Alzati also proved to be a major
embarrassment to the Zedillo administration.  Alzati was
forced to leave his post after admitting he lied about his
educational background.  The departures of Moctezuma and
Alzati were announced in July of last year (see SourceMex,
07/05/95).
     Political analysts suggest that the latest cabinet
changes announced in December are expected to greatly benefit
Interior (Gobernacion) Secretary Emilio Chuayffet Chemor, who
is close to many of the appointees.
     "Chuayffet must be smiling from ear to ear," said Reforma
columnist F. Bartolome.  "His team and influence are expanding
in the midst of the current administration."
     Indeed, Zedillo's new spokesperson, Carlos Almada, is a
close ally of Chuayffet.  Almada left a high-level post in the
Interior Secretariat (Secretaria de Gobernacion, SG) to take
over his new post.  (Sources: Agence France-Presse, 12/30/95;

ZEDILLO'S FIRST YEAR: PRESIDENT,
OR PRISONER OF CRISIS? (Part 1)

                 By John Ross
[The author is a freelance journalist who has written on
Mexican political and economic affairs for many years.]

     When outgoing president Carlos Salinas affixed the sash
with the colors of the Mexican flag--red, white, and green--
across Ernesto Zedillo's chest on Dec. 1, 1994, Mexico
appeared to be on the rebound after a nightmare year of Indian
rebellion and political assassination.  The new president
inherited an economy that appeared to hold great promise for
Mexico due to the enactment of the North American Free Trade
Agreement (NAFTA).  Additionally, his long-ruling (66 years)
Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) managed to win with
50% of the votes in national elections in August 1994.
     However, less than three weeks after his installation,
massive capital flight and the time bomb of short-term debt
obligations left behind by Salinas, forced Zedillo to devalue
the peso, triggering a chain reaction that quickly plunged
Mexico into an economic and social crisis which has colored
every minute of the new president's first year in office.
     Since the so-called "December errors," Zedillo has
staggered from one crisis to the next, like a shipwrecked
soul, overwhelmed by the flood of events.  In February, as the
economy crashed in flames, Zedillo bowed to the military and
ordered a full-scale offensive into the Lacandon Jungle base
of the popular Zapatista National Liberation Army (EZLN),
setting off a worldwide tide of protest.
     At the end of February, as public disdain for Salinas
began to soar, Zedillo gave the green light to arrest the
former president's brother for masterminding the murder of the
PRI's secretary-general, Jose Francisco Ruiz Massieu.
     For his part, Salinas took umbrage, declared a hunger
strike, and flew off into self-exile in Canada, from where he
has unremittingly sniped at Zedillo's fumbling administration
ever since.
     Meanwhile, the PRI was losing state elections to the
center-right National Action Party (PAN) by lopsided margins
and the bottom continued to fall out of the economy.  Indeed,
a drop of 10.5% in the GDP during the second quarter was a
64-year low.  So desperate has the economic slide become that
when the GDP tumbled only 9.6% in the third quarter, the
numbers were hailed by Zedillo's Finance Secretary Guillermo
Ortiz Martinez as a sign that "the crisis was over."
     In September of 1995, when Zedillo went before the nation
to deliver his annual state of the union message (the shortest
ever), the words most used to describe Mexico's current state
of affairs were "grave" and "crisis."  These terms were used
a total of 27 times.
     From 1981 through 1989, Mexicans endured versions of "La
Crisis."  These were actually a series of crises associated
with short-term debt obligations and the falling price of oil.
Lyable.
Moratoriums, led by debtors' unions like El Barzon, have so
constricted liquidity that some bankers admit privately their
only cash flow comes from money linked to narcotrafficking.
     Zedillo's crisis is also a monetary crisis.  Since the
"December errors," the peso has lost 55% of its worth and some
analysts predict the exchange rate will soon reach 10 nuevo
pesos per US$1.00.  Indeed, Mexico's currency has become
extremely vulnerable to speculators, forcing the Banco de
Mexico (central bank) to intervene by spending hundreds of
millions of dollars loaned last February by the US and the
International Monetary Fund.
     Despite the interventions, the peso is buying less and
less every day.  Inflation is expected to reach 50% in 1995,
a seven-year high, and it now takes two and one half minimum
salaries to buy the basic food basket.
     Zedillo's crisis is not yet a debt crisis as was the case
with La Crisis of 1982.  However, default remains a strong
possibility in the near future.  The nation's combined public
and private debt ended 1995 at close to US$162 billion, 36% of
the GDP and the highest dollar amount ever.  Mexico, which is
now banking export oil revenue in the US Federal Reserve as
collateral for the US-IMF bailout, transfered US$19 billion to
the exterior in debt service in 1995.  In 1996, the government
is expected to pay out another US$25 billion to service the
debt.
     Zedillo's crisis is a also a crisis for the super-rich.
The economic boom under the Salinas administration created 24
Mexican billionaires, but during 1995 only 10 of those
billionaires remained in the rankings of Forbes magazine.
     But Zedillo's crisis is mostly a crisis for the poor and
the extremely poor.  According to the Social Development
Secretariat (Sedesol), 2.5 million poor are at risk of falling
from poverty to extreme poverty, which is defined by the
United Nations as an inability to earn enough to meet one's
nutritional needs.  Under Zedillo, nearly one-fifth of the
population is going to bed hungry every night.  (Cont.)

ZEDILLO'S FIRST YEAR: PRESIDENT,
OR PRISONER OF CRISIS? (Part 2)

     Zedillo's crisis is a nutritional crisis for many
Mexicans.  The price of tortillas has risen three times this
year, for an accumulated 50% increase.  The government's
national nutrition institute (Instituto Nacional de Nutricion)
reports 41% of all births in public hospitals are low weight,
due to poor maternal nutrition.
     The crisis is also one of health care.  Mexico has
registered more cholera cases in 1995 than in any other year
since reporting began.  A regional epidemic of dengue fever is
wracking poor southern Mexican villages.
     Zedillo's crisis has impacted education as well.
According to one organization that advocates for the rights of
families, 150,000 students have had to transfer from private
to pubic schools, straining facilities and exhausting school
lunch programs.
     Zedillo's crisis is also an emotional crisis.  According
to statistics from Mexico City authorities, a record 40 people
have flung themselves before subway trains in the capital this
year.  Meantime, El Barzon claims that 400 of its members,
including its leader in Coahuila state, have committed suicide
since the crisis began, due to financial troubles.
     Indeed, Miguel Garcia, a psychologist who runs a Mexico
City suicide hot line, established after the devastating 1985
earthquake, says that La Crisis has taken a more severe toll
than the earthquake.  "For many, an economic crisis quickly
becomes an emotional one," Garcia said.
     Zedillo's crisis has been worsened by natural disasters.
As the peso skidded last January, the Popocateptl volcano
belched black smoke outside of Mexico City, causing thousands
to flee in panic.  Mexico has also sustained severe damage
from two hurricanes in 1995, one of which knocked out 90% of
off-shore oil production in October.  In addition, the country
has had to cope with a series of frightening earthquakes,
including a temblor on Oct. 10 that measured 7.2 on the
Richter scale, and which leveled hotels and other tourist-
related infrastructure in some areas of Mexico's Pacific
Coast.
     Unlike the debt crisis of 1982, Mexicans have not quietly
accepted the sacrifices imposed upon them.  Rebellion and
social protest are thriving.  Indeed, Mexico City authorities
recorded an average of eight marches a day in 1995.
Demonstrators daily block boulevards, banks, and even the
Mexican Stock Exchange (BMV), curtailing activity on the
trading floor.  When recruiters failed to appear for a job
fair this September, 20,000 professionals battled riot police,
using their briefcases as weapons.
     While the capitan president to consider stepping aside.
     For some, such as the PAN, Zedillo's crisis has created
unprecedented opportunities in municipal and gubernatorial
elections.  Indeed, Guanajuato's PAN Governor, Vicente Fox,
describes the crisis faced by Zedillo and the PRI as a
"pinata" for his party.  The PAN unseated the PRI from a
gubernatorial post in Jalisco in 1995 and managed to retain
the gubernatorial posts in Baja California and Guanajuato
states.  In addition, the PAN won a number of municipal races
in several large cities in Mexico, including Guadalajara and
Puebla.
     The crisis has also proven a boon for some in the US and
Mexico, including investors in Mexican mutual funds, foreign
travelers, and consumers who can afford to take advantage of
the growing number of bargains offered by supermarket chains
and department stores.
     Another major beneficiary of the recent economic
situation in Mexico is La Crisis editor Carlos Ramirez, who
notes sales of his bulletin have continued to grow steadily
since he started publication earlier in the year.
