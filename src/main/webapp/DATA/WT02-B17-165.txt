<h2>Economic Benefits of BioPower</h2>

<img border=0 align=left hspace=10 vspace=5 src="images/crops.gif">

<p>Economic activity associated with biomass currently supports 
about 66,000 jobs in the U.S., most of which are in rural regions. 
It is predicted that by the year 2010, over 13,000 megawatts of 
biomass power could be installed, with over 40% of the fuel 
supplied from 4 million acres of energy crops and the remainder 
from biomass residues. This would support over 170,000 U.S. jobs 
and would substantially revitalize rural economies.

<p>Biomass energy crops can be a profitable alternative for 
farmers, which will complement, not compete with, existing crops 
and thus provide an additional source of income for the 
agricultural industry. It is envisioned that biomass energy crops 
will be grown on currently underutilized agricultural land.

<p>In addition to rural jobs, expanded biomass power deployment 
will create high skill, high value job opportunities for utility 
and power equipment vendors, power plant owners and operations, as 
well as agricultural equipment vendors.
