<h4>Evaluate Your Child's Pre-School Skills</h4>

<p>Often it is the parents who first have concerns when their toddlers
are not &quot;on target&quot; in their development. Sometimes delayed development
is first detected in the doctor's office. </p>

<p><b>Warning signs are just that... Warnings.</b> They don't necessarily mean
there are problems, but they should be discussed with your pediatrician
or family physician at your next visit. If your toddler is developing normally,
your doctor will be able to reassure you. </p>

<p>Early intervention with a child who is behind in social, cognitive,
fine motor, gross motor, and/or language development can make a world of
difference. If you see some of these signs in your child, you may want
to contact your school district, primary physician or the local, state
or national LDA office for information. They can guide you on where to
start in determining whether your child has a developmental delay. </p>

<p>Federal Law, the Individuals with Disabilities Act (IDEA), provides
for a free and appropriate education for all children with disabilities.
This includes early intervention for pre-school children who need special
education services. </p>

<p>The Learning Disabilities Association of America (LDA) is a national
non-profit volunteer organization whose members include individuals with
learning disabilities, their families and professionals, There are state
and local LDA chapters throughout the United States. For more information
and to locate the LDA chapter nearest you, call or write: </p>

<h4>OTHER RESOURCES</h4>

<p><b>Your Local School District:
<br></b>Ask about their early childhood screening program and their early
childhood education program. </p>

<p><b>Your State Department of Education:
<br></b>Ask about your state's plan for early childhood intervention and
special education. </p>

<p><b>Your State's Parent Training and Information Center:
<br></b>Ask about what steps you should take to request an evaluation for
your toddler.
