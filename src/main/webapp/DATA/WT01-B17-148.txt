<br><br>



Successfully treating severe and chronic autoimmune diseases and “the real heavy hitters” of today’s illnesses such as AIDS, chronic fatigue, and cancer is the specialty of Solstice Clinical Associates in Tucson, Arizona, says director Jesse A. Stoff, M.D. Here they regularly treat patients with multiple sclerosis, lupus, scleroderma, chronic inflammatory nerve degeneration, leaky gut syndrome, debilitating allergies, and environmental illness.<p>

<br>

<b>THE EMPHASIS IS BALANCE.</b><br> Since 1991, this multifaceted holistic health clinic has been employing everything—nutrition to homeopathy, Chinese herbs to Anthroposophic medicines, relaxation and guided imagery to massage—to help restore energy, life, and health to thousands of patients. And this health is restored to the whole patient, not just the body, says Dr. Stoff. <p>
Patients at Solstice often experience major life course corrections through healing. “Metaphorically, this parallels the profound personal transformation that can occur in people’s lives through therapies offered at our center,” Dr. Stoff explains. <p>
The goal is to help each client achieve a working balance between physical healing and emotional, mental, even spiritual aspects of their life. “We will assist and encourage you, the patient, to take an active role in your healing process,” says Dr. Stoff.<p>

<br>

<b>A FULL DAY’S DIAGNOSIS.</b><br> Coming up with the diagnosis and treatment plan is a full day’s task at Solstice Clinical Associates. It’s a round-robin of evaluations of a patient’s blood, urine, and stool,  consultations with staff physicians and specialists, and an assessment of a client’s innate healing resources and state of mind.<p>
The new patient will spend an hour with Dr. Stoff, who is an M.D. specializing in homeopathy and, in fact, a world-acknowledged expert in holistic protocols for chronic fatigue. His 1988 book, Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: The Hidden Epidemic, still in print, is recognized as a standard work in the field of alternative medicine solutions for this illness.<p>
Next, the patient meets with George B. Olson, Ph.D., an immunologist and expert in the application of guided imagery for the treatment of infectious diseases. Dr. Olson often prepares instructional tapes for clients, taking them through the stages of generating mental images of healing. Then comes nutritional assessment and counseling with Lance J. Morris, N.M.D., a naturopathic physician trained in acupuncture, herbs, homeopathy, and structural/energy work.<p>
Finally, the new patient talks with one of several staff psychologists. Here the psychologist assesses the patient’s self-image and attitude about the illness, whether there are psychological or unconscious factors—“secondary gain and codependency”—that make it advantageous for the patient to remain sick. As Dr. Stoff puts it, “Most importantly, we want to know: what are this person’s perceived roadblocks to healing?”<p>
Through close collaboration among our staff members, we provide an individualized and comprehensive treatment program based on an in-depth understanding of each of our patients,” Dr. Stoff explains. Quite often, Stoff’s team gets a patient who has received the “proverbial million-dollar work-up” from conventional medicine, but still has no clear diagnosis. <p>

<br>

<b>NEVER A COOKBOOK PRESCRIPTION.</b><br> Dr. Stoff wants lots of details about a patient’s immune system and the status of its different cells such as lymphocytes. The results of a test for levels of T and B immune cells, for example, tell Dr. Stoff whether the person’s system is fighting a chronic virus and, if so, which type. <p>
Dr. Stoff checks the patient’s organic acid levels (found in the urine) as a gauge of how well their system can detoxify itself. “Our extensive lab tests show us where the patient’s problems lie. That way I can tell, for example, if the person has an underlying autoimmune problem.” <p>
Not infrequently—at the rate of nearly 2 patients per month now—Solstice doctors discover that a patient actually has cancer, misdiagnosed as chronic fatigue. Often, conventional doctors fail to do a complete series of tests and come up with a chronic fatigue diagnosis because it seems to fit the symptoms, says Dr. Stoff. But this can be misleading and sometimes simply wrong. “As much as possible, we try to approach the patient without any blinders on. I don’t just rubberstamp another doctor’s diagnosis.” <p>
Nor is the final prescription out of a therapeutic cookbook. “We may see 100 women with breast cancer, but the treatment protocol will be different for each. We don’t have any canned protocols that we take off the shelf just because a person has a presumed diagnosis.”<p>
Solstice staff meet to discuss their findings and to come up with an overall treatment plan. “We don’t miss a trick,” says Dr. Stoff. “That’s how we consistently get good results.” At the end of the 2-day evaluation, patients get a little bonus from Dr. Stoff—a warm, insightful, affable, even jolly healer who chuckles a lot. “Almost always I give them a hug.”<p>

<br>

<b>FEELING BETTER IN 10 DAYS.</b><br> Usually a patient stays in Tucson for 2 days for a complete evaluation and initial treatment prescription. If the patient has cancer or a serious autoimmune problem, it may require staying in town for a month to receive daily intravenous treatments. Patients, incidentally, come from all over: Singapore, Thailand, England, Switzerland, France, Colombia, and the continental U.S. <p>
Typically, a patient with an autoimmune disease starts to feel improvement within 5-10 days of starting the full supplement program, reports Dr. Stoff. More energy, less pain—this indicates their system is absorbing the health-restoring nutrients. Then there may be a period lasting several weeks to months in which their improvement waxes and wanes; this means their immune system is “doing battle” with the illness and restoring health. <p>
Most often, the immune system wins the day, even against AIDS. “We have a large, long-term survivor population. I don’t have a cure for AIDS, but what we do stabilizes our AIDS patients and keeps them stable for many years.”<p>

<br>

<b>PAUL’S CASE: DOWN-AND- OUT WITH CHRONIC FATIGUE.</b><br> Paul came to Dr. Stoff’s clinic suffering from chronic fatigue. A former missionary, at 39 he was so exhausted that some days he lacked the energy even to get out of bed. Paul had a constant sore throat, swollen glands, recurrent low-grade fever, muscle and joint aches, headaches, chronic indigestion, sleeping disorders, depression, and problems with memory, concentration, and focus. He was tired all the time, took frequent naps, and often could not keep his eyes open in the mornings. <p>
During his time as a missionary, Paul had often skipped meals even though he was doing strenuous physical work; so his body had become undernourished and the continual stress regarding money problems further depleted his system, Dr. Stoff learned. “Paul crashed and burned from this lifestyle and, as a result, he was down for the count by the time I met him.”<p>
Although Paul’s work had been in the back country of South America, Dr. Stoff’s blood, urine, and stool tests did not reveal the presence of any exotic tropical or parasitic  infections. But Paul did have high levels of Epstein-Barr virus, commonly associated with chronic fatigue. His inadequate diet, high physical demands, and stress had left his system seriously deficient in many amino acids and essential fatty acids, says Dr. Stoff. <p>
Even more serious, Paul’s basic biological rhythms and hormonal cycles were out of balance. For example, his levels of ACTH (adreno-cortico-tropic hormone, secreted by the pituitary gland, vital for adrenal gland health) were undetectable; his DHEA (an adrenal hormone) was almost negligible; his cortisol (another adrenal hormone) levels were way too high; and he had multiple enzyme failures (based in his pancreas), which made his system unable to absorb nutrients from foods or supplements. “Paul’s immune system wasn’t working properly because his body could no longer regulate these natural, deep-set cycles,” explains Dr. Stoff.<p>
Dr. Stoff’s treatment program had many facets. First, he gave Paul a series of Anthroposophic remedies (Echinacea Argentum, to stimulate the immune system; Apis Belladonna, to work against inflammations; and Cardus Marianas, to detoxify the liver) through a single injection every day for 10 days. Next, Dr. Stoff put Paul on a multivitamin and acidophilus.<p>
To help regulate his biological cycles and promote sleep, Dr. Stoff put Paul on  melatonin (a brain hormone from the pineal gland) at the initial rate of 9 mg at bedtime, then gradually lowering it to 3 mg daily. Dr. Stoff also started Paul on a commercial amino acid formula called Amino-virox™ (2 capsules, 3 times daily, taken 30 minutes before meals) and a multinutrient supplement called Immune Boosters (3 capsules daily, with meals).<p>
To reduce Paul’s depression, Stoff gave him 5-hydroxy-tryptophan, a form of the amino acid L-tryptophan (100 mg at bedtime), to promote sleep, increase levels of serotonin (a key brain chemical), and to counter the depression. To restore depleted levels of dopamine, another important brain chemical, Dr. Stoff prescribed Catemine, a form of the amino acid L-tyrosine, and activated vitamin B6 (peridoxyl-s-phosphate). <p>
The goal was to balance the relationship between two vital brain chemicals (serotonin and dopamine) which in turn would reset Paul’s biocycles. To address Paul’s enzyme deficiencies and to increase his nutrient absorption, Dr. Stoff prescribed an enzyme formula called Absorbaid. After 3 days, Paul began to feel much better and experience more energy; this was evidence that his body was resetting its biological clock. A month later, Dr. Stoff added a natural form of the adrenal hormone DHEA (100 mg, taken at dinner) to Paul’s program. <p>
In all, it took about 18 months before Paul was fully recovered. Normally, chronic fatigue patients recover faster, “but Paul was so nutritionally depleted that it took much longer.” As Stoff sees it—and he has successfully treated some 1500 cases of chronic fatigue—the return to health involves 3 stages. First, you put the virus into remission. Second, you have to repair the cellular and systemic damage. <p>
Third, the patient must “learn the lessons of the disease” so the same lifestyle and emotional patterns are not repeated in the future. Paul had to learn how to pace himself, maintain his priorities, and “gain insight into the deeper significance” of his illness. To further this, the Solstice staff taught Paul guided visualization techniques and gave him stress reduction counseling.<p>
The goal, says Dr. Stoff, “is to get the person feeling 110% improved without taking any supplements, but this third stage, when they’re fully functional, feeling great, and without symptoms, is the longest. Then things slowly, but progressively improve.” In general, most of Dr. Stoff’s chronic fatigue patients “do well fairly quickly if they follow our directions.” As for Paul, he recently left for Russia to do missionary work.<p>

<br>

<b>THEODORE’S CASE: PUTTING HIS LEUKEMIA INTO REMISSION.</b><br> Theodore, aged 50, came to Solstice Clinical Associates with a diagnosis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia. His conventional doctors were urging a bone marrow transplant and high-dose chemotherapy, but Theodore wanted none of that. Dr. Stoff’s blood test showed that Theodore’s bone marrow was being attacked by cytomegalovirus, a herpes virus which is often active in people with a compromised immune system. <p>
This virus was triggering malignant changes in Theodore’s bone marrow, thereby producing the leukemia, Dr. Stoff explains. But rather than treating the cancer (leukemia), Dr. Stoff focused his treatment on the virus. <p>
He gave Theodore a series of injectable  remedies, most notably a preparation used in Anthroposophic medicine called Iscucin (made from Viscum album, or mistletoe) to stimulate the Natural Killer cells of his immune system. Next, he gave Theodore once daily intravenous infusions of nutrients, including vitamin C (50 g), calcium chloride (5 g), vitamin B12 (1000 mcg), vitamin B6 (300 mg), magnesium (2 g), vitamin B complex, adrenal cortex extract, and licorice extract.<p>
In addition, Dr. Stoff prescribed a series of oral supplements including Aminovirox™ (2 capsules, 3 times daily), Immune Boosters (3 daily, one after each meal), Super Colloidal Silver (one teaspoon, twice daily), folic acid (400 mcg daily), and acidophilus (3 daily doses). Dr. Stoff rotated Theodore through acidophilus brands, including powders, liquids, and capsules, to give him the broadest spectrum of microorganisms.<p>
Next it was necessary to give Theodore’s system high nitrogen amino acids, such as arginine (500 mg, taken 3 times daily), to “feed” the Natural Killer cells so they could neutralize the cancer. A Green Tea Extract (2 capsules, taken 3 times daily) also helped here. Further supplements included Super Antioxidant Formula (2 tablets, 3 times daily), borage oil (as gamma linolenic acid, or GLA 240, 2 capsules, twice daily), and Super EPA fish oil (to replenish Theodore’s essential fatty acid reserves; 2 capsules, twice daily), and a balanced multivitamin.<p>
The synergistic formula paid off. Theodore’s lymphocyte count (a measure of white blood cells, elevated during disease) eventually dropped from an extreme high of 60,000 to a more manageable 11,000, but it took the first year to get it down to 20,000. At that point, Dr. Stoff stopped Aminovirox™ and substituted Aminoplex®, a  different amino acid formula. <p>
After 6 months on this program, “the virus was gone and Theodore was in remission,” says Dr. Stoff. Theodore  would remain on the Iscucin injections for 6 weeks twice a year and continue with the supplements. “He still has leukemia, but it’s no longer active and shows no signs of threatening to come out again.”<p>

<br>

<b>LOIS’ CASE: THE AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE THAT MADE HER NECK SPASM.</b><br> When Lois, aged 35, first walked into Solstice Clinical Associates, she brought a diagnosis of spasmodic torticollis. This is a debilitating disease in which certain neck muscles go into spasm, causing the neck to turn sharply and stay fixed in one direction. She had suffered with this for 9 years.<p>
Lois’ conventional doctors had her on Botox injections, which is the botulism toxin, injected into the neck muscles as a relaxant; they also had her on a series of painkillers, anti-inflammatory medications, and muscle relaxants. “They had no treatment for her anymore because she had failed every therapy they had tried,” says Dr. Stoff. “Ironically, Lois had never had a decent medical evaluation.” He performed blood tests and found her immune system was making antibodies typical of an autoimmune disease. Lois’ neck spasms were only a symptom of something deeper. <p>
Dr. Stoff put Lois on a supplement program beginning with Aminoplex® and Sof Gel EFA (an essential fatty acid formula in soft gelcaps to work as a natural anti-inflammatory). He gave her  vitamin C (2000 mg, 3 times daily), a natural multivitamin, melatonin (3 mg, at bedtime), and acidophilus (3 daily doses, rotating the brands). <p>
Next, Dr. Stoff prescribed a remedy special to Anthroposophic medicine: Erysidoron 2 (containing Carbo vegetabilis, from birchwood, and sulphur) to counter her neck inflammation. He also gave her another Anthroposophic remedy (containing, in part, homeopathically prepared stibium and quartz) in liquid form to soothe her hyperactive neck muscles. Finally, he started her on a course of myotherapy to eliminate the pain. <p>
It took only 3 weeks of myotherapy sessions to remove the pain, but about one year to completely undo the inflammation and reduce the neck spasms so she could freely turn and straighten her head. These conditions improved steadily and today Lois  “looks fine and has a job as a supermarket comptroller.<p>
