<H2><A NAME="_Toc370012897"><TT>Immigrants in Midwestern Meatpacking</TT>

</A></H2>


<P>

<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">The cover story of the September 23,

1996 US News &amp; World Report, &quot;The New Jungle,&quot; focused

on the use of immigrant workers in Iowa's meatpacking industry.

The story emphasized the role of meat packing companies in recruiting

immigrant workers to move to Iowa, and said that &quot;perhaps

no industry is so dependent on this low-wage labor as the nation's

meat and poultry companies.&quot;</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">A July 1996 Changing Face of Rural America

conference of social scientists, by contrast, emphasized that,

in most midwestern meat packing plants, Latinos work alongside

US-born Blacks and whites. Latinos are less than half of most

plants' work force, and many of them are US-born citizens.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">Many Latinos move to the Midwest because,

in contrast to seasonal farm jobs in California, where workers

average 1,000 hours per year at $5 to $6 per hour, in meat packing

plants, workers average 2,000 hours at $6 to $8 per hour, enough

to support a family. The Changing Face report is available at:

http://migration.ucdavis.edu</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">The US News &amp; World Report story

focused on Storm Lake, Iowa, a town of 8,700 that has an IBP plant

that slaughters 13,000 hogs each day. Education costs and crime

are up. Almost half of the kindergarten class in 1996 is non-Caucasian.

Many of the workers are from Santa Rita, Mexico, 100 miles southeast

of Guadalajara; some allegedly buy false documents from IBP employees

who sell them on the side. </FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">About $5,000 worth of money orders are

mailed from Storm Lake to Mexico each week.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">IBP bought the Storm Lake packing plant

for $2.5 million in 1981, and it received $1.9 million in tax

incentives and a $9.5 million revenue bond from the city. Turnover

in the plant is high; an average of 183 workers had to be hired

to keep every 100 jobs filled in 1990, according to one IBP manager.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">There are about 500,000 children in K-12

schools in Iowa. The number of Limited English Proficiency children

in K-12 Iowa schools has increased from 3,107 in 1989 to 6,931

in 1996, including 21 percent of the Storm Lake students.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">Meat packing is a $95 billion per year

business dominated by three companies, IBP, Cargill's Excel Corp.

and Con-Agra's Monfort Inc. IBP had sales of $12 billion in 1995,

and profits of $257 million.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">The INS district director for Iowa and

Nebraska estimated that 25 percent of the 50,000 workers who dis-assemble

animals in the 222 meat packing plants in the two states are unauthorized

aliens. INS inspections of the workers in 15 plants since 1992

have led to 1,000 workers being detained, and the INS is opening

an office in Cedar Rapids, Iowa in January 1997.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT COLOR=#000000 FACE="Courier">On August 24, 30 INS inspectors

surrounded a Monfort-Swift plant in Marshalltown at the end of

a work shift, detaining 147 of the 900 employees as they left.

Most were flown to Mexico within 48 hours.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT COLOR=#000000 FACE="Courier">Another 24 workers were

apprehended at an IBP facility in Waterloo, Iowa. After an April

1996 raid on All-State Quality Food, 47 apprehended workers pled

guilty to working in the US illegally, making them subject to

criminal penalties if they are apprehended in the US again.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT COLOR=#000000 FACE="Courier">Most of the meatpacking

plants are constantly hiring new workers to replace workers who

quit, and many of the Hispanic workers employed in meatpacking

plants use fraudulent documents to obtain their jobs. Meatpackers

say that they can only ask job applicants if they are &quot;legally

entitled&quot; to work in the US, and close scrutiny of worker

documents can lead to charges of discrimination. The INS, however,

estimates that 85 percent of the &quot;documented illegals&quot;

are &quot;knowingly hired&quot; by employers.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT COLOR=#000000 FACE="Courier">Meatpacking companies offer

starting wages of $5 to $7 per hour. According to OSHA, about

36 percent of meatpacking workers are injured on the job each

year. </FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT COLOR=#000000 FACE="Courier">Newly-hired workers are

not eligible for health insurance benefits for off-the-job injuries

for their first six months of employment, and then they share

the cost of the premium on an 80-20 basis (workers pay 20 percent).</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT COLOR=#000000 FACE="Courier">Rural Oklahoma is also

attracting Hispanic immigrants for meat and poultry processing

jobs. Commerce, OK, a town of 2500, increased its Hispanic population

from 150 in 1990 to 800 in 1996.</FONT></TT>
