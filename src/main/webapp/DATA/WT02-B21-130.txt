<B><I><FONT SIZE=5>Snorkel and Dive Alert - </I></B></FONT><BR>
Don’t make other plans for January, 1998!  We are planning both a snorkel and a dive expedition in the new Micronesian nation of Palau.  Just recently autonomous from the US Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, Palau is often refered to as the most beautiful of Micronesian destinations.  Only nine of the 343 islands are inhabited, and the area is renowned by scuba divers and snorkelers worldwide.  Five full days of our snorkel expedition will be spent on a live-aboard yacht, to allow us to move easily amongst the islands and concentrate on the fantastic marine life.  Another five days will be devoted to cultural exploration of Palau, with continuing daily opportunities to snorkel as well.<BR>
In addition to our snorkeling expedition, we will offer a separate diving trip for "hard core" divers to the seldom-visited islands southwest of Palau.  Eleven days will be spent on our chartered yacht exploring the waters surrounding Tobi, Helen, Metur and Sonsorol islands.<BR>
Both trips will include three days on the traditional, hospitable islands of Yap, where a highlight will be swimming with manta rays.<BR>
Zegrahm co-founder Jack Grove will be the expedition leader for our Micronesia expeditions.  Look for his scouting report in a future edition of Zegrahm News, but in the meantime, give Tony a call if you want to be added to our interest list - Each expedition is limited to just 17 participants.<BR>

Arctic explorer John Dunn tells the story of his 1994 traverse of Baffin Island - by ski, kayak and hiking boots - in the October 1996 issue of National Geographic.  The article is accompanied by John’s stunning photographs taken during the expedition.  John will be a part of the expedition-leading team on our first-ever Circumnavigation of Baffin Island expedition in August 1997.  For those booked on this voyage, and/or those who are interested in Arctic adventure, his article and photographs should not be missed!<BR>
<B><I><FONT SIZE=5>1997 Last Chance for Wind Song in Polynesia!</FONT></I></B><BR>
Our Polynesia Under Sail voyages have been extremely popular and presently two of our three spring expeditions in 1997 are waitlisted, with very limited space available on our third departure.  Furthermore, we have been advised that the Wind Song will leave the waters of the South Pacific by the end of 1997.  This is therefore truly a Last Chance notice:  We have chartered the Wind Song for two more voyages through the Tuamotus & Marquesas archipelagos in October of 1997.  Brochures for these voyages are ready to go but, judging from the response to our spring programs, space will soon be in short supply.  If you are interested, give Wendy or Nadia a call.<BR>

<B><I><FONT SIZE=5>Birders’ Corner</FONT></I></B><BR>
The Seychelles:  Cast adrift in mid-ocean, a millennia of isolation has created here a feathered fantasia of some of the rarest birds on the planet.  Of special interest is the endemic Seychelles bare-legged scops owl.  Only a handful remain and to date no eggs or nest have ever been found.<BR>
Even rarer, at one time at least, was the Seychelles warbler.  In 1959 there were just 26 left on earth.  Careful management has now brought this bird back from the brink of extinction and there are now over 400 individuals.  Less fortunate is the fate of the Seychelles magpie robin, which today numbers just 42 birds.<BR>
These are just a few of the birds that can be seen on our Indian Ocean expeditions in 1997.  If you would like to see the "rarest of the rare" give Lynne a call.<BR>
