<P>&nbsp; 
<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;My patients frequently ask me about the risks involved in
taking weight loss medication. They are especially concerned with a lung
disease called primary pulmonary hypertension that has been mentioned on
some of the tabloid TV programs. &nbsp;There was a study published in the
New England Journal of Medicine earlier this year and then updated on August
29, 1996 that is the basis for all the negitive publicity on weight control
drugs. The purpose of the study was to try and find out what are the factors
that lead to this rare disease. It was found to occur most frequently in
women in their twenties and thirties. Recent pregnancy may have a causitive
role. There is a genetic susceptibility involved because it runs in certain
families. Outside factors are suspected also. These outside factors include
cocaine use, HIV infection, use of birth control pills , cirrosis of the
liver, and smoking. Obesity itself is associated with primary pulmonary
hypertension. 
<P>
<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The study did not mention the dosages of weight control
medication used by their patients. The most common symptom was severe shortness
of breath. In most cases the diagnosis was not made until more than a year
after the symptoms started. If the diagnosis can be made earlier and the
medicine stopped, the condition can improve. This is one reason we closely
monitor our patients on weight control medication.
<P>
<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In the same issue of the New England Journal of Medicine
an editorial was published by JoAnn Manson MD of Harvard Medical School that
puts the study in perspective. &nbsp;She states that obesity is now recognised
as a chronic disease that requires long-term treatment. Obesity is the second
leading cause of preventable death in the United States, exceeded only by
cigarette smoking. It is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease,
diabetes mellitus, and some cancers. It contributes to 300,000 deaths every
year in the United States. Even small amounts of weight loss are associated
with improved risk profiles. Dr. Manson states that at least 280 deaths per
million obese people could be prevented with weight loss medication. In addition
more than 400 non fatal heart attacks and strokes could be prevented. The
risk of pulmonary hypertension from &nbsp;weight loss medication is about
28 cases &nbsp;per million person years of exposure. This is approximately
the same as the risk of dying from penicillin, &nbsp;birth control pills,
or aspirin. She also states that several biasis may have inflated the estimates
of risk in the study.
<P>
<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;From this data we find a <B>benifit to risk ratio
of &nbsp;20 to 1</B>
<P>
<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Dr. Manson concludes that the risk of pulmonary
hypertension associated with weight control medication is small and appears
to be outweighed by the benifits when the drugs are used appropriately.
