<H1>Climate variability in Brazil:<BR>
What can it tell us about tomorrow’s<BR>
climate change impacts ?</H1>
<HR>
<B>Global climate change could cause Brazil's current climate extremes to occur 
more often.  </B>Most scientists believe that man's emissions of <A HREF = 
"fs002.html">greenhouse gases</A> will affect the average 
global climate.  However, they are still <A HREF = 
"fs018.html">unable to predict how climate change will impact 
particular regions</A>. To provide national policy-makers with some early insights into 
the potential regional impacts of future climate change, researchers can study <A HREF = 
"fs017.html">present-day climate variability</A>, especially <A 
HREF = "fs105.html">extreme events</A> such as droughts and 
floods.  This can enable them to draw conclusions about the relative vulnerability of 
different sectors of the population to climate change and about what policy responses may 
be needed.  It was with this goal in mind that a recent climate study was undertaken in 
Brazil.1<P>
<B>Brazil's semi-arid Northeast is highly vulnerable to the effects of droughts.  
</B>This region is one of the country's poorest.  In normal years agriculture is a major 
source of employment.  However, the already dry climate means that droughts can have a 
very serious impact on production, with recorded losses sometimes exceeding 60%.  Such 
dramatic drops reduce employment opportunities on large commercial estates and destroy 
the livelihoods of subsistence farmers.  Sometimes, when shortfalls in production cause 
food prices to rise, the only way for much of the rural population to avoid destitution is to 
migrate to the cities in search of low-paid jobs or to seek relief from the government.  
During the drought of 1983, for example, one million people - representing 48% of the 
total state labour force - were employed in public works programmes in the state of 
Ceara.  Such programmes entail a huge cost to the economy and, while they enable people 
to survive, they cannot fully compensate for lost production or prevent increased hunger 
and malnutrition.<P>
<B>Floods create problems throughout Brazil but cause particular devastation in 
the major cities.</B> In areas such as the Pantanal (Great Swamp) of Eastern Brazil 
moderate flooding is vital for restoring vegetation and for destroying certain weeds.  
However, exceptional floods can result in great hardship, displacing people from their 
homes and causing severe damage to the cattle ranching business. In 1988 floods killed 
20% of the total herds and caused massive damage to infrastructure.  In the same year, 
300 people were killed and over 1,000 injured in floods in Rio de Janeiro.  In some areas 
the equivalent of three months' rain fell in under twenty-four hours and caused hundreds of 
landslides, especially in the densely populated slums (favelas) on the hillsides surrounding 
Rio.  Thousands of people were made homeless, health and sanitation problems worsened 
dramatically, and the World Bank estimated that damages, including lost production, were 
close to US$1 billion.  Despite the approximately US$400 million now being spent on 
rehabilitation, the lack of basic infrastructure and drainage in the city means that it remains 
extremely vulnerable to future climatic  extremes.<P>
<B>Unusually high or low temperatures cause extensive <A HREF = 
"fs101.html">damage to crops</A>.  </B>Coffee, which is 
Brazil's principal export product, is particularly sensitive to temperature fluctuations.  Its 
ideal growing range is a narrow 16 C to 23 C.  In 1981 a frost affecting all of Brazil's 
coffee growing states reduced overall production by 54%.  Growers have traditionally 
been protected from the worst effects of such shortfalls by government intervention but, 
with the economy undermined by the debt crisis, support has been withdrawn.  Citrus, 
another important cash crop, is also at great risk from frost.<P>
<B>Deforestation is increasing Brazil's vulnerability to climate variations.  
</B>Using <A HREF = "fs014.html">computerized climate 
models</A>, researchers have tried to model the regional climatic consequences of 
replacing rainforest with degraded pasture.  The results of such regional modelling are 
considered uncertain, but they suggest that surface temperatures would rise by 1-3 C and 
rainfall would decrease by 20-30%.   This hotter and drier climate would encourage more 
forest fires, further raising atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide, an important 
greenhouse gas. But tree-cutting doesn't only affect climate.  It reduces the ability of 
forests to act as protectors of bio-diversity; the Amazon is host to around one-half of the 
world's species. Furthermore, cleared land erodes more easily.  The cycles of flood and 
drought in the Amazon region have become notably more severe since massive clearing 
began; a ten-year drought that began in 1963/64 was followed by fourteen years of 
floods.<P>
<B>The same policies that can improve society's ability to cope with climate 
variability today could also be critical to dealing with climate change tomorrow.   
</B>While most areas of Brazil suffer adverse weather conditions from time to time, they 
do not all experience equal degrees of social upheaval as a result.  For example, the effects 
of drought in the Northeast are particularly severe because of the endemic poverty in the 
region.  Since 60% of the population has a year or less of schooling, employment 
opportunities are hard to find, suggesting that educational and jobs programmes would 
help to reduce the region's vulnerability to climate.  Similarly, energy planning in the area 
must take climate hazards into account.  Because the Northeast relies heavily upon 
hydroelectric power from the Saõ Francisco river, rationing is required in drought years.  
This can put close to 16% of the manufacturing workforce of the state of Ceara out of 
work.  Diversification of power sources is thus essential.  The benefits of policies for 
adapting to climate variability have already been demonstrated in the agricultural sector, 
where research has led to the development of several new crop varieties more resistant to 
climate extremes.  If global climate change causes today's climate extremes to become 
more frequent, such policy approaches will become ever more essential.<P>
