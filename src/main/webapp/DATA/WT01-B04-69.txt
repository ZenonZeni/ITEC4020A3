<h2 align=left><font color="#000000">2. How would I post to these forums?</font></h2>
<p align=left><font color="#000000">First you need to subscribe to the Ethiolist Services by sending a request e-mail to 
Ethiolist-Request@Ethiolist.com. Once the subscription is processed, then posting 
to any one of the above forums is simple and direct. For example, to post to 
EthioMusic subscribers are requested to send their mails to 
EthioMusic@Ethiolist.com. And, to post EthioCulture the address to use is 
EthioCulture@Ethiolist.com. The domain name for all the forums is the same - 
@Ethiolist.com. The only thing that changes is the forum name. So, the format 
[forum name]@Ethiolist.com works for all postings. </font></p>

<h2><font color="#000000">3. Why all these forums, is it not going to be 
confusing for subscribers?</font></h2>
<p><font color="#000000">The forums were designed to reflect different interest areas. For example, those 
interested in discussions of sports may send their messages to sports forum, and 
those interested in the Ethiopian culture will direct their postings to the EthioCulture 
forum. Having such kind of setup really benefits subscribers. As more Ethiopians 
get e-mail access, more postings will show, and it will be time consuming for a 
subscriber to sort through all the incoming mails. The current set-up can be used as 
a preliminary sorting method. If a subscriber does not want to get mails from a 
given forum he/she would unsubscribe from that particular forum while still being 
able to get information in other areas of interest (other forums). </font></p>

<h2><font color="#000000">4. What do I need to do to archive files?</font></h2>
<p><font color="#000000">Postings sent to Ethiolist server are automatically archived and can be accessed by 
sending a request to the request alias. The request alias for the Ethiolist services is : 
Ethiolist-Request@Ethiolist.com Since the archiving is done for each forum 
separately different commands should be used for each forum. However, all 
requests can be made in a single request mail. The following example shows how to 
use the request alias to get archive mails. The first thing you need to do is address 
your request to the proper alias. In the case, the request would be addressed to 
Ethiolist-Request@Ethiolist.com , so, the mail header would look like this: </font></p>

<h2><font color="#000000">5. If I send the an e-mail to all the forums at the 
same time, would subscribers get that many 
duplicate mails - provided that they have 
subscribed to all the forums?</font></h2>
<p><font color="#000000">If a mail is sent to ALL the forums at the SAME time, subscribers should not be 
getting multiple copies and , the incoming mail shows the tags indicating which 
forum the mail was sent to. If mails are sent at time intervals, then, subscribers might 
get multiple copies. So, if you want to reach ALL Ethiolist subscribers without 
sending duplicate mails, then, what you really need to do is, address your e-mail to 
one forum and carbon copy all the remaining forums. Since it is one mail 
composition, the server should not send SAME mail to the same person more than 
one time. </font></p>

<h2><font color="#000000">6. Are there other commands that subscribers 
may use?</font></h2>
<p><font color="#000000">We are currently working on a set of commands that would grant list maintainers 
access to the Ethiolist server. As the needs comes we will be adding more 
commands that could also be utilzed by subscribers to get more information on their 
subscrption and also allow them to access the archives in a better efficient way. By 
design, the Ethiolist server would allow us to add more commands as the needs 
come in the future. </font></p>

<h2><font color="#000000">7. What is the objective of Ethiolist?</font></h2>
<p><font color="#000000">Our objective is to open and strengthen an open electronic forum for Ethiopians 
and those who promote the interests of Ethiopians. We sincerely believe that open 
communication and exchange of diverse ideas is a prerequisite for a consensus on 
issues at hand. Hence, we encourage discussions on different issues to be open and 
sincere. The Ethiolist managing team has no political partisanship, however, we 
sincerely believe that our strength rests on our unity. </font></p>

<h2><font color="#000000">8. Who pays for all these service? Is there any 
plan to share the cost?</font></h2>
<p><font color="#000000">This question was raised by a number of subscribers. Ethiolist is maintained by the 
postmaster and managed by a team of Ethiopians. There is a monthly fee that is 
paid to the service provider for access to their machine. That fee is ONLY for a 
limited use of the service provider's resources. For instance every time we exceed 
the limitation (disk space) we are required to pay extra money. This can happen 
very frequently considering the increasing number of subscribers. Every activity on 
the Ethiolist server is logged in addition to the actual e-mails that are also saved on 
the server. And that eats-up disk space. Ethiolist requests subscribers to share the 
burden. We will be asking for small contribution to continue the service. The 
subscription and start-up fee is a little over $2 per month per subscriber for a total 
of $25/year. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">Some files on the Ethiolist Server can be accessed via the FTP mechanism. To 
download files via FTP, use ftp ftp.netcom.com directory /ftp/pub/tx/txt4. From the 
'txt4' directory you would more subdirectories for the forums we maintain. Go to 
the forum of your choise and check tha available file out (if any) </font></p>

<h2><font color="#000000"><i>WITHOUT FTP</i></font></h2>
<p><font color="#000000">Ethiolist also has an E-mail based File Transfer service for binary files. These files 
can be saved on the server via e-mail remotely and can also be retrieved via e-mail 
remotely. Files and programs can be saved to AAU on the Ethiolist system and 
people in Ethiopia can access these files via e-mails. To use this feature interested 
parties need to contact the postmaster (txt4@Ethiolist.com). Due to limited disk 
space, this feature may not be available to all at this time. However, interested 
parties are encouraged to contact the postmaster. This feature is what was talked 
about on the AAU connectivity project. Well, it is here now. </font></p>

<h2><font color="#000000">13. What is new?</font></h2>
<p><font color="#000000">-Three more forums have been added! </font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">Ethio-Art Ethio-Humor EthioNews </font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">The managing team has just added three more forums - Ethio-Art and 
Ethio-Humor. Ethio-Art is intended to enhance discussions related to Ethiopians 
arts, and Ethio-Humor serves as a forum for discussions regarding Ethiopian 
humors. Jokes that are not based on ethnicity and that are not divisive are very 
welcome. Homor and/or jokes that undermine the integrity of ANY of the 
Ethiopian ethnic groups are NOT allowed! EthioNews is a news forum that is 
directly from Ethiopia. Ethiolist has made arrangement with news providers in 
Ethiopia and the postings to this forum are obtained directly from these news 
sources. In the future the sources will be expanded and not limited to sources in 
Ethiopia only. EthioNews is a moderated forum. </font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">****** Ethiolist has aquired its new domain name - Ethiolist.com - in January 
1996. In addition to the new domain name Ethiolist also has its own Wbe page on
