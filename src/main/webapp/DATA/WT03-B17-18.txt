<font size=+3><b>VNPT's Ingenious "108" Girls"</font></b>

<img src="../caps/acap.gif" align=left border=0 alt="A">n old joke in the US is to call "information" and ask how to bake a cake. Only in the past few years have Western entrepreneurs carved a niche in their native countries by offering horoscope readings, stock quotes, and wake-up-calls, with most services starting at about $3.00 per minute.<p>

The Vietnam Post and Telecommunications Corp. (VNPT) has them beat by a mile. For 300 dong (about three cents) per minute, this local service provider offers the well-known "108 Girls." Reachable by dialing 108 nationwide, they will tell you how to bake that cake. They will also recommend the tastiest restaurants, provide train information, and recommend films and then tell you the theater and show-times. In fact, 108 girls are obliged to try to answer any question at all. (They also provide addresses and phone numbers). For 500 dong, they'll even call and wake you up.<p>

State-owned VNPT introduced 108 service in 1992 in response to increased demands for social and general information. It reflects the telephone's changing role and is enforced by a clever "value-added" scheme. The Hanoi service started with just five employees; today there are 100, working in three shifts around the clock, including a French speaker, two Russian speakers, and ten who speak English. 108 advertises in newspapers and on television.<p>

According to Ms. Pham Thy Nga, manager of the recently introduced international service (in Hanoi, 84 4 108 000), 108 doesn't track the number or length of calls, although she has noticed more tourists calling and fewer children.<p>

Located in a single cavernous room in the rear of the International Post Office compound on Hoan Kiem Lake, 108 is as cacophonous and eclectic as one might expect. Bookshelves line one entire wall, hosting dog-eared books and periodicals on history, finance, foreign relations, tax, fashion, as well as dictionaries. There is a full-time data collector who programs the computers facing each operator. Recently, a doctor was even retained to field medical questions.<p>

Uniforms of beige, well-cut blazers are worn by the 108 girls, who Ms. Nga said are "all university-educated with sweet voices." While she and postal colleague Vu Manh emphasized the increase in tourism, business, and overseas calls, 108 is also a well-known stand-by source of entertainment for the idle.<p>

Most requests, reported a 108 girl by telephone, are for a story to be read or song sung. "Many children also call to say, 'Do you like my dad? He's single.' Sometimes the dad calls. Many men call to chat." For this reason, all employees go by the name, "Thuy Tien."<p>

Says one operator, who plans to become a teacher, "It's very funny and a chance to talk. That's why we're here."<p>
