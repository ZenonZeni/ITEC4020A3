BANK OF HAWAII ADDS SERVANTIS CASH MANAGEMENT SOFTWARE

     Bank of Hawaii, headquartered in Honolulu, has licensed InfoVue
treasury management software from Norcross, Ga.-based Servantis
Systems Inc.  The bank hopes the system boosts its product offerings
for corporate accounts.   
     InfoVue provides corporate accounts with on-line treasury
management, account balance reporting, stop payments, E-mail and other
financial reporting services.  (Lynn Busing, Servantis Systems Inc.,

INNOVATIVE STRATEGIES FOR BUSTING FRAUD

     Credit card institutions must be more proactive in their fraud-
fighting strategies or risk significant losses from fraud, risk
management experts say. 
     To nip fraud losses in the bud, credit card departments must be
on the lookout for current fraud schemes, such as account boosting,
account takeover and counterfeit cards, say anti-fraud specialists. 
Issuers also should implement new procedures and programs for the
entire lifetime of an account to prevent these new forms of fraud.  
     Increased transactions are translating into an uptick in fraud
losses (Visa estimates that for 1994, it had $409 million in fraud
losses in the United States out of $290 billion total sales;
MasterCard's fraud figures are believed to be similar to Visa's).  

Reactive vs. Proactive

     The banking and credit card industries have, historically, had
more of a "reactive stance" to fraud, taking action only once the
cardholder alerts the bank to some fraudulent activity, such as a
stolen card or a charge-back item on a bill, said one consultant.  
     The more effective way to keep fraud losses down, however, is to
identify fraud schemes before they reach the individual cardholder. 
"Don't wait until the cow is out of the barn," advised Larry Hay, vice
president of risk management at Plainview, N.Y.-based Cardholder
Management Services, a firm specializing in card marketing, processing
and consulting.
     How can you become more proactive instead of reactive about
fraud?  Consider these strategies, offered by credit card fraud
experts:

Beware of Account Boosting

     Card executives need to be attuned to every kind of new fraud
scheme because they're faddish -- one form of fraud may be popular
today and virtually non-existent tomorrow, card industry observers
say.  Fraud schemes change 
frequently as law enforcement groups, card associations and financial
institutions devote attention to one type.  Subsequently, criminals
will look for new methods.
     Visa has begun to alert its member institutions about "account
boosting," a scheme where criminals obtain legitimate credit cards,
accrue balances, then send issuers, via overnight courier services,
stolen or counterfeit checks 
that exceed the balance amount, "boosting" the account's credit line. 
Federal law requires banks to post credit payments before checks
clear, so, the next day, the fraud perpetrators go to an automated
teller machine (ATM) and withdraw the excess amount on that card
account and the check later bounces.
     Visa has been helping the U.S. Secret Service and the U.S.
Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) track down one large account
boosting case in Los Angeles, which resulted in 41 arrests recently,
said Allan Trosclair, vice president of fraud control for Visa.  
     Some account-boosting cases also are being linked to bankruptcy
fraud -- individuals accrue massive card debt knowing they will file
for bankruptcy and have no intention of repaying the card debt.  

TIP:  Card executives should be wary of any payments coming in through
overnight services, Trosclair warned.  They also should watch for
large payments or payments that exceed what a cardholder owes.  

     "If I send in a $6,000 check, and my credit limit is only $5,000,
there's something wrong," he said.  Banks may also want to monitor for
bankruptcy fraud behavior, by keeping track of accounts that suddenly
have high purchase volumes or uncharacteristically extravagant
purchases.  "There are several systems available which develop a
profile of normal purchasing activity of an individual cardholder and
when that [behavior] is severely changed and warrants some attention,"
said Hay.  

Prevent Account Takeovers

     MasterCard has been alerting its member institutions to watch for
an increase in "account takeover" fraud in which a criminal obtains a
cardholder's basic information (address, phone number, account
number), sometimes through old receipts, records or by stealing the
real cardholder's mail.  
     The criminal calls the card issuer, assuming the cardholder's
identity, and requests that a new card and personal identification
number (PIN) be sent to a new address because the card was lost or
stolen and the cardholder has moved.  "What happens is that the [real]
cardholder may not get a statement for a couple of months, the
criminal may pay off the minimum balance [to avoid detection] and then
start [using the card]," said Nancy Elder, a MasterCard spokesperson.

TIP:  To reduce account takeover fraud, issuers can include a three-
digit code, determined by the bank, on the back of a credit card next
to the account number.  

     Account representatives should be trained to be suspicious for
the three characteristics of account takeover:  a request for a new
card, a new PIN and a change of address.  Representatives should ask
for the three-digit code.  "If they say they don't have the card on
them, respond by saying 'call us back when you have the card in
hand,'" said Elder.

Use Technology, Training To Stop Fakes

    Issuers also must be alert for another kind of fraud: 
counterfeit cards.  These illegal products declined in the early 1990s
with the advent of the hologram; however, fake cards recently have
gained in popularity as holograms have become easier to replicate,
according to James Steel, regional vice president of security and risk
management at MasterCard.  
    To prevent more counterfeit card fraud, both MasterCard and Visa
have implanted secret card validation algorithms in each card's
magnetic stripe.  MasterCard calls it a card validation code (CVC) and
Visa calls it a card verification value (CVV).  
    When a merchant swipes the card through an authorization
terminal, the code enables the issuer to detect if there has been any
alteration of the stripe, and if so, to deny authorization for the
transaction.  
    An increasing number of transactions, however, are suspectable to
counterfeit card fraud because of purchases made at retail locations
that don't have on-line authorization terminals, or by telephone where
cards cannot be checked.

TIP:  One of the best ways to reduce counterfeit card usage is to
ensure that merchants are adequately trained in counterfeit card
detection, fraud experts say.  

    MasterCard's Holiday Fraud Prevention Seminar Program, for
example, helps merchants understand different types of credit card
crime by touring U.S. malls and educating merchants.  Acquiring
institutions also should require that their merchants offer training
to telephone operators, clerks and sales associates to help them learn
how to detect credit card fraud schemes.

Implement a Review Policy

    Issuers can use proactive strategies even after the fraud has
occurred by having a purposeful chargeback review methodology, said
Hay of Cardholder Management Services.  

TIP:  Review a charged-off account for improper authorization codes
and irregular activities, such as major purchases.  

    Improper authorization codes may indicate merchant collusion,
experts say. Irregular activities also may offer leads to criminals --
a purchase of a piece of furniture, for example, may have an address
where the furniture was delivered.  (Nancy Elder, MasterCard, 914/249-
5439; Larry Hay, Cardholder Management Services, 516/576-0404; Gail
Murayama, Visa, 415/432-3645.)

                         Fraud Detection Tool

     Here's just one of the many proactive anti-fraud products
available:

     Wheb Systems Inc. of San Diego, offers FraudAlert as a module to
its Intelligent Forms Processing System (IFPS).  FraudAlert is
designed to reduce errors and fraud before data is entered into
databases.  
     The module, based on technology licensed from Security Software
and S.G. Schoggen and Company, can be updated quarterly or monthly. 
Detection capabilities include:

 *  whether a Social Security number (SSN) has ever been used;
 *  whether the SSN was issued at a time approximating the 
          individual's stated birth date;
 *  if the SSN matches the specified state of birth; and
 *  if the SSN belongs to someone deceased.

     IFPS scans hand-printed or machine-printed forms, extracts the
relevant data and automatically enters it into a database.  Costs of
the system were not disclosed.  (Julie Drake, Wheb Systems, 619-586-

BANK MITIGATES RISK WITH ASSET/LIABILITY SOFTWARE

    U.S. Bancorp of Portland, Ore., says  asset/liability management
software cut in half the time it takes for the bank to run monthly
analyses and simulations, thereby increasing by two weeks the time the
bank has each month for forecasting and strategic analysis.
    The system also allowed the bank to more than double the number
of random interest rate scenarios it can create and reduced the time
needed to meet regulatory reporting requirements, Bancorp executives
say.
    Asset/liability management software uses computer simulations
under random rate scenarios to monitor interest rate sensitivity,
liquidity position and capital adequacy.  Although such services are
offered by banks as part of their corporate services package, some
large companies have purchased asset/liability software for in-house
treasury management, consultants say.
    However, treasurers largely have shown lukewarm interest in the
software as systems can be costly, tough to maintain and difficult to
use, consultants note.

System Reduces Analysis Cycle

    Bancorp installed RADAR, a UNIX-based asset/liability management
application from Risk Management Technologies Inc., of Berkeley,
Calif.
    RADAR simulates up to 100 randomly generated, interest rate
scenarios and presents a statistical and graphical view of each
potential outcome.  Companies can use this data to look at statistical
probabilities and begin to generate strategies for the best balance
sheet mix.
    The system also analyzes product risks.  For example, banks can
use the system to look at commercial lending across their subsidiaries
and provide information to various business managers on optimal fee
structures and interest rates, explained Rick Simpson, asset/liability
manager at Bancorp.
    In addition, RADAR reduced by two weeks Bancorp's time needed to
conduct rate analysis and issue reports for different business lines. 
"Today we are performing the same reporting in two weeks, which gives
us the second half of the month to [plan] how to use the information,"
Simpson explained.
    Although Bancorp hasn't calculated the interest rate savings
RADAR has provided, trimming just one basis point on the spread
between assets and liabilities means an additional $1.8 million to the
corporation, he noted.
    Bancorp also can run a full balance sheet analysis for one of its
banking concerns in two minutes.  Simpson estimated it takes a few
hours for the bank to run a hundred different scenarios. 
    RADAR uses RAM-resident, interactive modeling and supports both
value-at-risk (VAR) and risk-adjusted return on capital (RAROC)
analytical approaches.

Software Not a Hit with Corporations

    Sumitomo Bank Ltd., of Osaka, Japan, the world's fourth largest
bank, plans to implement a RADAR system for asset-liability
management, interest rate risk management, transfer pricing, strategic
and product planning and product and customer-service performance
management, its executives say.  
    Sumitomo will create a bank-wide data warehouse for use by the
system.
    National Computer Systems of Minneapolis offers DataWriter,
another software application for asset/liability management.  
    The Windows-based system generates detailed reports on any aspect
of an asset management operation, including specialized asset
management.  Treasurers can use DataWriter to produce multiple reports
simultaneously. 
    In addition, the system allows treasurers to use point-and-click
features to define data and maintain libraries for storing and
indexing reports.
    Asset/liability software is not widely used by corporate treasury
managers, notes consultant Jim Sagner of Sagner-Marks in West Orange,
N.J.  
    "Even the most popular software which does account analysis has
been purchased by only a few corporations.  Many of them use their
systems just once or twice a year, and probably are sorry they spent
the money," he said.
    Most treasurers use asset/liability software provided by banks as
part of their information systems and balancing and reporting
services, Sagner said.  He believes treasurers are reluctant to buy
custom asset/liability systems because banks are providing adequate
services at competitive prices.  "Banks usually cut deals on these
services to win other business with corporations," he explained.
    However, only banks with sophisticated treasury workstation
products offer asset/liability services as part of their standard
software package for corporations, notes Henry Waszkowski, head of
treasury consulting at Wachovia Corp. in Atlanta.  The packages
generally feature debt modules, funds need forecasting and investment
modules, which do little analysis, Waszkowski said.  
    He said corporations often have to buy asset/liability modules
from vendors to implement on existing treasury workstations.  Many
other companies gather rate forecasting information from consulting
firms or by polling banks they do business with and subscribing to
economic services, Waszkowski noted.
    "Full-blown" workstations that include asset/liability management
software make the most financial sense for corporations with more than
$1 billion in sales annually and operations expanding overseas,
Waszkowski said. 

Treasurers Scared Off by Price of Software

    Sagner said another reason asset/liability software gets a
lukewarm reception from corporations is that treasurers are afraid
vendors won't be able to provide long-term support for the systems. 
He also believes treasurers are turned off by the $10,000 to more than
$100,000 price tag for the software.  
    "The little bit of money treasurers have as discretionary budget
is used for industry conferences or visits to vendor or bank sites,"
he noted.
    Sagner recommended treasurers avoid asset/liability systems that
are not bank-supported.  Otherwise, there is a chance that the
software vendor will go out of business and its system will become
obsolete and tough to maintain.
    TIP:  If you are keen on buying custom software, get a handle on
vendor
installation costs, which inflate greatly the price of off-the-shelf
software.

Look for Flexible Asset/Liability Software

    Jeffrey Wallace of Greenwich Treasury Advisors in Greenwich,
Conn., suggests treasurers also avoid asset/liability systems that use
static gapping models, which compute debt-equity ratios without
factoring in the yield curve.  "The real issue is how the yield curve
impacts bucket limits," Wallace said.
    "[Treasurers] won't care if they are long on the three-month side
and short on the six-month side if the yield curve is relatively
flat," he said.  "But if the curve is inverted, they might be
concerned about their gap restrictions." 
    Wallace suggested treasurers look for asset/liability software
management software that allows them to simulate a variety of interest
rate scenarios.
    TIP:  Keep in mind that PC-based asset/liability packages are
limited by the PC's processing capacity, memory and storage capacity. 
To compensate, they use aggregated data, which is not as accurate,
Simpson cautioned.  (Jeffrey Wallace, Greenwich Treasury Advisors,
203/531-0835; Jim Sagner, Sagner-Marks, 201/243-1144; Rick Simpson,
U.S. Bancorp, 503/275-7277; Kib Shorey, National Computer Systems,

MECA SOFTWARE GAINS MORE FINANCIAL BACKERS

    Banks looking to support personal financial management (PFM)
software may have to consider another major player.
    Competition in the PFM software business continued to heat up
last week as three new bank-investors pledged their moneys to
Fairfield, Conn.-based Meca Software's Managing Your Money PFM
product.
     FirstBank Systems, Fleet Financial Services and the Royal Bank of
Canada all bought stakes in Meca, which is co-owned by San Francisco-
based BankAmerica Corp. and NationsBank Corp..  Each of the five
institutions will own a 20-percent share of Meca.
     The five Meca partners have a combined customer base of more than
40 million customers and represent more than $655 billion in assets,
giving Meca -- whose software is used by more than 600,000 consumers
and small businesses in North America -- a significant competitive
boost, industry analysts say.
     However, some banks do not believe the Meca partners will be able
to work together and create a competitive product.
     The overwhelming market leader for PFM software, with more than 8
million copies sold, is Intuit's Quicken.  Microsoft's Money PFM
product -- launched earlier this year -- is a distant third to Meca.

PFM Maneuvering

     The Meca deal continues a six-month trend, which has seen PFM
manufacturers aggressively seeking out bank partners to offer on-line
home banking.  Both Microsoft and Intuit have struck agreements with
more than 19 banks across the United States.  Many of these
institutions including Chemical Bank, CoreStates Bank and Wells Fargo
Bank will offer both Money and Quicken to its customers.

Advantages

     Meca's owners said the deal gives them an advantage in the PFM
marketplace over the Microsoft and Intuit banks because institutions
now can customize their PFM software packages.  Minneapolis-based
FirstBank, Providence, R.I.-based Fleet and Royal Bank of Toronto all
will create a branded Managing Your Money product with different
functionality.
     "This investment will enable Fleet to develop its own branded PC
[personal computer] product, designed to meet the specific needs of
our customers while providing them convenience and privacy," said
Michael R. Zucchini, vice chairman and chief technology officer at
Fleet.
     Fleet's version of Managing Your Money will provide Fleet
customers with an on-line link to open accounts, check and transfer
balances, apply for loans, track their investments and buy stocks and
mutual funds.

Avoiding Conflict

     Meca critics question whether the five large institutions can
agree on one software product.  
     "I just don't see why these banks, who compete against each
other, would want to join forces," said one Southeast banker.  "The
egos of the executives at these large institutions are bound to cause
problems."
     However, allowing each bank to customize may allow Meca to
sidestep any controversy.
     "I don't see a lot of potential conflict," said Stu Bloom, a
partner at the Hackensack, N.J.-based consultancy, Carmody & Bloom. 
"Banks are going to do what banks do -- offer basic financial products
to their customers.  There should be no great conflict in what will be
developed."
     Royal Bank of Canada will use Meca to launch a PC computer
banking system.  Its customers will connect directly to the bank's
host computer to pay bills, receive account balances, transfer funds
and access account information.  Royal will roll out Managing Your
Money nationally in late 1996 to its 10 million customers at more than
1,600 branches, according to Royal Bank officials.

The Future

    Industry analysts expect the strategical maneuvering of PFM
software providers to continue throughout 1996.
    In fact, Intuit recently announced its plans to provide on-line
banking over the Internet.  This is a change from its recent strategy
of signing up financial institutions.
    Intuit said it is developing a direct connection to the Internet
that will allow consumers to pay bills, check account balances and
transfer funds over the Internet.  Banks working with Intuit will have
the choice of offering customers Internet banking or banking solely
through Quicken.  

PFM Landscape

    The Intuit decision earlier this week proves that the PFM
landscape is changing on a daily basis.  
    PFM manufacturers will most likely continue to strike deals with
financial institutions.  
    However, do not expect banks to support solely one PFM product. 
Industry watchers believe banks want to offer their customers the most 
 choice  and   will   offer any  alternatives on the marketplace.  
    "It wouldn't be surprising for a bank to take an open systems
approach to these types of [PFM products]," said Bloom.  "In some
ways, it would be advantageous.  It won't surprise me [if some Meca
institutions offer Quicken or Money] even though they have taken an
equity position in Meca."  (Stu Bloom, Carmody & Bloom, 201/671-1700;

FIRST INTERSTATE BANK TAPS IMAGE-LOCKBOX PROCESSING

     First Interstate Bank, of Los Angeles, says it's the first bank
in the Western United States to offer image-based retail lockbox
processing.  It also claims to be the only bank to fully exploit the
opportunity to initiate true interstate banking.
     "We have installed a common lockbox image platform at all of our
banks which gives our customers the same consistent functionality,"
said Julie Stephens, product manager at the $56 billion asset-bank.
     A common platform allows First Interstate to offer same-day
automated clearing house settlement (ACH) across its Western state
affiliates or same-day cash concentration for customers who require
separate accounts, officials say.
     The bank's image-retail lockbox provides customers with
streamlined workflow, higher quality processing and improved customer
service, she said.       In addition, the system includes intelligent
character recognition (ICR), which allows matching payments and
coupons to be read by the system and processed without keying.  This
improves the speed and quality of processing.  
     Phase 2 of First Interstate's image-retail lockbox project will
include the ability to provide transaction images to customers for
receivables posting.
     The image system is expected to capture about 11 million items
per month.     

First Interstate Offers Common Platform  

     First Interstate also completed recently a multimillion-dollar
project to install common cash management systems across the bank's
13-state domain.  
     A provision of the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking Act allows
affiliated banks to act as "agent" for one another, and act as an
agent itself.
     First Interstate offers common direct demand accounts (DDA),
account reconciliation processing (ARP) and account analysis
capabilities.  Customers can use the products to make same-day
deposits to a single account from deposit acceptance points in 13
Western states.  With fewer accounts to manage, customers can
determine cash positions faster and easier, bank officials say.
     "Many companies with multi-state operations will no longer have
to concentrate or reconcile funds," said Jan Cloyde, the bank's
executive vice president and manager of cash management.  She claimed
that competitor banks are well behind First Interstate in developing
multiple interstate banking options.
