<B>WORKING AROUND WATER?<BR>
What you should know about <BR>the Lakes and Rivers Improvement Act
<P>
FACT SHEET</B></CENTER><P>
The Lakes and Rivers Improvement Act gives the Ministry of Natural Resources the mandate to manage water-related activities, particularly in the areas outside the jurisdiction of Conservation Authorities.  The purpose of the Act is to manage the use of the waters of the lakes and rivers of Ontario, to regulate improvements in them, and to provide for:<P>
<UL>
<LI>preserving public rights in or over water;

<LI>protecting the interests of riparian owners;

<LI> management of fish, wildlife and other natural resources dependent on such waters;

<LI>preserving natural amenities; and

<LI>ensuring the suitability of the location and nature of improvements.
</UL>

The waters in front of your property are important fish habitat.  To maintain the shoreline waters so that fish may continue to thrive in these areas, water-related structures should be built with care.<P>

This Fact Sheet provides important information for planning and building the types of "projects" that <B>require</B> a permit under the Lakes and Rivers Improvement Act.<P>

For situations where a permit is <B>not required</B>, this Fact Sheet outlines some best management practices.  It also identifies several reference documents to aid in carrying out work in an environmentally sound manner.  If these practices are followed, fish and wildlife habitat as well as riparian interests can be protected.<P>

<B>PERMITS</B><P>

The Lakes and Rivers Improvement Act applies to both private and public lands covered by water.  In the past, the LRIA required approvals for any dam built on this land; i.e. a work permit from the MNR.  Recent legislative changes removed the permit requirements for some types of projects, but not for others.  Table 1 indicates what does and does not require an approved work permit under the Act.<P><BR>

If you plan to build the structures identified in Table 1 as requiring a work permit, you will need approval under the Lakes and Rivers Improvement Act.  You can obtain a work permit application form by contacting your local MNR office.<P>

Projects that require a work permit, can pose a potentially significant risk to the environment.  MNR may visit the site to assess the habitat in the area, as well as other environmental concerns.  This takes time, so submit your application early in the planning process.<P>

Keep in mind that you may need additional approvals.  For example, property fronting on the Rideau Canal or the Trent-Severn Waterway, is under Federal jurisdiction; for in-water and shoreline works approval, contact the Department of Canadian Heritage, Parks Canada.  Bridges and large culverts may require Canadian Coast Guard approval under the Navigable Water Protection Act.<P>

It is also important to remember that approval from one government agency does not guarantee that you will be able to obtain approval from another agency.<P>

<B>BE ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY</B><P>

Construction activities in water disrupt water flows and cause changes to water quality and fish habitat.  The federal Fisheries Act provides for the protection of fish habitat.  Under this Act, no one may carry out work that harmfully alters, disrupts or destroys fish habitat, unless there is specific project authorization.  Also, no one is permitted to deposit a harmful substance in water frequented by fish.  A conviction under the Fisheries Act can result in fines of up to $1,000,000 and/or imprisonment, and you may be required to cover the costs of restoring the site.<P>

Construction activities in water can affect fish habitat in three ways:<P>
<UL>
<LI>placement of fill or building in-water structures can cover important spawning beds or feeding areas;

<LI>digging and filling in water introduces sediment that can be transported downstream a considerable distance. Sediment can kill fish, destroy spawning beds, and cover food sources (4); and

<LI>an improperly placed culvert can block fish migration routes if there is insufficient water depth, or if stream flows are too fast.
</UL>
If you suspect your property is adjacent to or upstream from a spawning or nursery site for species such as lake trout, brook trout, walleye, pike, or muskellunge, your activities could place important fish habitat at risk.  You should either talk to staff at the local MNR office, or have your project reviewed by an environmental consultant.  The destruction of a single spawning or nursery site can result in a reduced fish population in the waterbody.  Such destruction of habitat could lead to charges under the federal Fisheries Act.<P> 

At certain times of the year, fish are more vulnerable to harm from sediment than at other times.  The risk of killing newly laid fish eggs can be reduced considerably by timing construction outside the fish spawning, incubation, and fry emergence times.  This occurs at different times for different fish species.  The local MNR office can provide information on times to avoid working in the specific waterbody you are located on.<P> 

Being environmentally friendly requires understanding the consequences of your actions, the use of designs engineered to perform the function intended, reduction of short term construction impacts to the lowest level possible and elimination of any long term damage to the ecosystem.  A reference source that sets out good design and construction practices for the installation of bridges and culverts is the "Environmental Guidelines For Access Roads and Water Crossings3. " <P> <BR> 

<B>BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES</B><P>

The following examples of best management practices will help you ensure that your project will not harmfully alter or destroy fish or wildlife habitat.  Following these practices will reduce the chances of violating the Fisheries Act.  It is also a good idea to talk to a biologist and an engineer to ensure that the design and construction aspects of your project are completed properly.<P>
<UL>
<LI>Waterways must not be blocked so as to impede the free movement of water and fish.<P>
 
<LI>Culvert and bridge openings must be sized to pass flood flows expected during the life of the structure.<P>
 
<LI>Mitigation measures for erosion and sediment control must be used to reduce sediment entering the water to the lowest level practically achievable.<P>
 
<LI>Fill material placed below high water level within the floodplain of water bodies must be erosion resistant.<P>
 
<LI>The use of heavy construction machinery on stream or lake beds is discouraged during spawning and incubation periods and must be kept to an absolute minimum at other times.<P>
 
<LI>Fill slopes and waterway banks disturbed during construction must be trimmed to a stable angle of repose and protected from erosion.  Upon completion of the project, any temporary fill, surplus culverts, refuse, etc. must be removed from the construction area and disposed of in a satisfactory manner.<P>
 
<LI>Measures must be taken to prevent contamination of waterbodies by foreign materials such as lumber, nails, logs, brush, fuel, oil, lime, cement, asphalt, calcium chloride, sodium chloride, oil base wood preservatives, and herbicides.<P>  
 
<LI>Minimize the duration of construction, and stabilize exposed soils as soon as possible after final grades are established.<P>
 
<LI>Stabilize the site by encouraging the re-establishment of vegetation as quickly as possible:  Avoid late fall or winter construction for works requiring vegetative stabilization.<P>
 
<LI>Avoid winter construction where soil compaction is critical to the structural integrity of the works (e.g. dams and culverts).<P>
 
<LI>Avoid construction on streams during high flows or periods when a spring flooding may occur.<P>
 
<LI>Protect existing vegetation as much as possible - it is nature's erosion control cover.<P>
 
<LI>Select a structure which minimizes disturbance to the river or lake bottom:  For example, cantilever, floating and post-supported dock structures minimize disturbance to river or lake bottoms, and allow the movement of water near the shore.  These structures can actually improve fish habitat by providing fish with extra shelter from predators. From a fish habitat perspective, these structures are preferred.<P>
 
<LI>Limit the area of disturbance:  For example, a crib dock can be built with bridging between the cribs to enable water circulation.  Small cribs are preferred. Construction which restricts water movement is not recommended.  Remember, if the total surface area of your cribbing exceeds 15 square meters on the lake/river bottom, including existing or old cribs, you will need a permit from the MNR.<P>
 
<LI>Use clean granular materials or rock fill, taken from dry land:  Materials that are coarse, with few particles of sand size and finer, will minimize sediment transport and provide a stable structure resistant to erosion.  Material must not be taken from the lake or river bottom or the shoreline, unless it has been specifically authorized by MNR.<P> 
 
<LI>Plan construction operations and materials to minimize impact on water quality:  For example, if you are planning to use pressure treated lumber in a project, all cutting, end sealing, staining, etc. should be done well back from the water. <P> 
<LI>The treated surface should be completely dry before being placed in the water.  These practices will help to reduce the amount of contaminants released into the waterbody.<P>
 
<LI>Avoid in-water dredging:  Dredging may be harmful to fish and their habitat.  If your project involves dredging, you will need a permit.<P>
 
<LI>Avoid critical spawning and nursery periods:  In-water construction activity should not occur during the spawning and nursery period for those fish species in the waterbody at the project site.  It could kill eggs and young fish.<P>
 
<LI>For high risk projects, develop a Sediment Control Plan to guide the builders:  These plans set out the construction sequence, expected operations that could cause sediment to enter the waterbody, and measures that will be taken to control erosion and sediment.<P>
 
<LI>Learn about potential impacts of construction and techniques to minimize the impacts:  Information is available in the following MNR publications:<P>
