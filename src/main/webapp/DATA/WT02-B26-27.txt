<h4 align=center><font color="#000080"><b>I Can See Tomorrow--A Guide For Living with Depression by 
Patricia L. Owen, Ph.D.</b></font></h4>
<P>
Review by William Zaccagnino, Froma Lippman, and Marianne Thomas
<P>
	<I>I Can See Tomorrow--A Guide For Living with Depression</I> by 
Patricia L. Owen, Ph.D., is a very complete book on depression with 
informative addenda that include resources and agencies throughout 
the nation to help people with depression and bipolar disorder.
	<P>
Dr. Owen has provided a helpful guide for those who recognize or 
suspect that they have depression.  From the start, readers who may 
only suspect they have depression can hold themselves up against 
the measures of the types and symptoms of depression to make that 
first judgment about obtaining appropriate treatment, whether that 
is medications, psychotherapy, or both.  The book is especially 
valuable for those who also are recovering alcoholics or substance 
abusers. 
<P>	
Dr. Owen offers an assortment of information about the defining 
features of depression, the causes of depression, therapy, 
medications, relationships with family, and the spiritual 
dimensions of this disorder.  Each of her chapters discusses a 
topic and includes questions readers may ask about themselves 
relative to the topic and what they may do to help themselves.
	<P>
Because stigma still surrounds depression as it does other 
psychiatric disorders, Dr. Owen's discussions about common 
misperceptions and myths may be particularly helpful.  This 
information can be central to readers' accepting their depression, 
the causes of depression, selecting a psychotherapist, accepting 
the need for using an antidepressant, and finding a comfortable 
position in the family, with friends, and in organizations like 
Alcoholics Anonymous.  The battle against depression is formidable, 
but the barrier of stigma significantly magnifies it.
	<P>
Owen also has complied an appendix listing some of the common 
antidepressants.  She includes information about how the 
medications work, side effects, dosages, and specific pointers for 
recovering alcoholics and substance abusers.
<P>
	Dr. Owen comments on the theoretical nature of chemical 
imbalance as a cause of brain disorders and on persons with 
depression having the right to contribute to treatment decisions 
about their own care.  The reviewers believe, however, that putting 
too much emphasis on the empowerment of the person as opposed to 
the value of the medication may lead to some depressed persons 
deciding against needed medication, temporarily or permanently, 
because of their depressed mood.  They may act out of simple 
dislike of taking medications rather than out of clear thinking 
about the therapeutic value of the prescribed drug.
<P>
	Overall, Dr. Owen provides valuable information about 
depression and offers individuals and their families or significant 
others support and hope for future recovery and relief from 
illness.

Their Parents by Harold Koplewicz</b></font></h4>

<P>
Reviewed by Harriet Bladwin, NAMI Literature Committee, and Brenda 
Souto and Dee Mukherjee, NAMI staff
<P>
	It's Nobody's Fault could not have been written 25 years ago. 
<P>
 It reflects the monumental change that has taken place in 
understanding all mental illnesses--that they are brain disorders, 
disturbances in brain chemistry, and nobody's fault.  This work 
deals with serious brain disorders in children and adolescents.  
Its author is an experienced clinician, Chief of Child and 
Adolescent Psychiatry at the Long Island Jewish Medical Center and 
Associate Professor of Psychiatry at the Albert Einstein College of 
Medicine.  Koplewicz is upbeat, authoritative, and empowering.  And 
his book is interesting and readable.
<P>
	It's Nobody's Fault has three parts.  "Living with a Child's 
Brain Disorder" sets out Dr. Koplewicz's general views: that 
parents don't cause serious mental disorders, but they are 
responsible for getting their ill children into treatment.  "DNA 
Roulette and the Role of Medication" explains the role of genetics 
in brain disorders in children and adolescents, the ways in which 
those disorders affect brain chemistry, and the role of medications 
in treatment.  "No-Fault Brain Disorders" discusses 13 specific 
disorders commonly found in children and adolescents--symptoms, 
diagnosis, brain chemistry, treatment, and parenting.  There are 
three appendices.  The first reviews technical terms used in the 
book; the second lists organizations that provide educational and 
support services; and the last consists of charts that summarize 
the medications (by brand and generic names) used in treating the 
discussed disorders as well as their possible side effects.
<P>
	Koplewicz is "must reading" for parents who feel guilt and 
remorse about the brain disorder of a child.  The author emphasizes 
that child and adolescent disorders are the result of genetic 
predispositions and that medications, often offered with 
psychotherapy, sometimes transform lives and usually make disorders 
more manageable.  This is one book every NAMI family will wish it 
had discovered when a child first showed symptoms of abnormality.  
It belongs in every affiliate library and every public library.
<P>
	Many NAMI families report that the professionals they meet 
often deny that prepubertal children can have serious brain 
disorders.  Such families face not only stigma, lack of services, 
and inappropriate education settings, but they also face great 
difficulty in finding professionals who are in touch with current 
research and treatment practice.  Furthermore, they are perplexed 
by misinformation about using medications in treating childhood-
onset brain disorders.  For such families, It's Nobody's Fault will 
bring refreshing good news.
<P>
	The only shortcoming of It's Nobody's Fault is that the 
chapters about specific disorders are necessarily brief. 
Suggestions about supplementary reading would have been a welcome 
addition.  NAMI readers are encouraged to consult the new NAMI's 
Young Family Reading List for further reading.  (For a copy, call 
Brenda Souto at 70/524-7600.)
