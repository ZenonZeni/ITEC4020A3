<H2>The Development of the Future: A Better Way</H2>

<H4>E Pluribus Unum</H4>

<I>by Clarence J. Sundram, chairman, New York State Commission on 
Quality of Care for the Mentally Disabled</I>
<HR>

	On May 1, we celebrate Law Day in this country.  This year, 
the American Bar Association selected as a theme for Law Day 
activities "E Pluribus Unum," the Latin phrase we see on our 
currency that means "Out of many, one."  As I reflected on this 
theme, it occurred to me that this motto has application as well to 
the field of mental health.
<P>
	For the past twenty years, I have been involved with mental 
health services as a counsel to the governor of New York, as the 
head of the oversight agency, as the administrator of the 
protection and advocacy system for New York, and as a court monitor 
and expert witness in class action lawsuits in several states.  For 
all of that time, the mental health community has been fragmented 
and as lacking in cohesion as the mental health system itself.  
Institutional providers disparage the work of community agencies 
that reject challenging clients; community agencies dismiss the 
role that institutions have played and continue to play; state 
agencies and local governments squabble over which of them is 
evading responsibility for the care of vulnerable citizens; private 
providers and governmental providers argue over the relative value 
of their services; families decry the unresponsiveness of service 
providers in an hour of need and urge easier access to services; 
primary consumers rail against the pervasive coercion of the mental 
health system and give compelling testimony of the harm they have 
suffered at its hands.  And so on.
<P>
	From my vantage point, there is a kernel of legitimacy to all 
of these claims, but the vehemence with which they are pressed 
emphasizes the disagreements and dissonance among the various 
constituency groups and gives scant voice to areas of agreement.  
Legislators and policy makers, who respond most effectively when 
they hear constituency groups speak with one voice, instead hear a 
Tower of Babel.
<P>
	This point came to me powerfully two weeks ago while attending 
a conference in New York City on "The Carey Years" that reviewed 
the governorship of Hugh L. Carey from 1975-1982.  A member of the 
audience at a panel discussion on human services noted that one of 
Governor Carey's most notable accomplishments was signing the 
Willowbrook Consent Decree, which ended litigation over the 
wretched conditions in an institution that once housed more than 
5,000 people with mental retardation.  In the ensuing years, the 
state transformed the service system for mental retardation, 
spending tens of millions of dollars to replace institutions with 
an array of community residences and day programs.  Why, he asked, 
had the Governor not done the same for the mentally ill?
<P>
	A panelist responded that early in his administration Governor 
Carey had appointed a widely representative 36-member task force to 
advise him on mental health issues.  But instead of speaking with a 
single voice, he said (with some exaggeration, I suspect) the task 
force came back with 36 opinions, ensuring that nothing would be 
done.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(T)here is no dearth of profound challenges that could keep us all 
constructively occupied in improving a shameful history of 
treatment of persons with mental illness.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
	If there is a single overarching challenge for the future of 
the American mental health care system, it is to learn to build 
consensus where there are broad areas of agreement about what needs 
to be done and to rid ourselves of the bad habit of focusing upon 
and magnifying the areas where there is disagreement.
<P>
	Despite the modest progress that has been made in recent 
years, there is much that is fundamentally wrong with mental health 
services in most parts of this country.  A few of the most glaring 
include:
<P>
	•	Thousands of citizens are locked away in psychiatric 
institutions long after there is any demonstrable 
clinical need for hospitalization, even in the opinion 
of the hospital staff.  They live in conditions of daily 
indignity that robs them of privacy and a sense of 
personal identity and segregates them from the rest of 
society, often with little constructive activity.  Many 
spend weeks and months with less access to the outdoors 
for fresh air and exercise than is afforded to convicted 
criminals in prisons.  Scientific advances in the 
treatment of persons with mental illness are painfully 
slow in trickling down to the institutions that confine 
them.
<P>
	•	Thousands more, who have been discharged from 
psychiatric institutions, live in conditions of 
unspeakable neglect in boarding homes, shelters, or in 
the streets of our communities.
<P>
	•	Despite the billions of dollars spent annually on mental 
health services, both consumers and families often find 
services unavailable in a time of need or unresponsive 
to their concerns.
<P>
	•	Patients with mental illness are unique among all 
patients in lacking the protection of informed consent 
to treatment, and they are the only group of citizens 
who can be volunteered by others for participation in 
experimental treatment that is of no direct benefit to 
them.
<P>
	•	While there is broad acceptance of the principle of 
patient participation in treatment planning and of the 
value of family involvement, practices are often widely 
at odds with this.
<P>
	My point is not that any or all of the proceeding problems are 
the ones around which all the mental health constituencies should 
galvanize their advocacy efforts (although that would not be a bad 
idea).  Rather, it is that there is no dearth of profound 
challenges that could keep us all constructively occupied in 
improving a shameful history of treatment of persons with mental 
illness.  The key to effective advocacy is for all of us to learn 
to speak in harmony rather than in dissonant voices.  This may 
require that we each truly listen to one another's points of view 
about potential solutions and be willing to forego the "solos" for 
a stronger chorus of effective advocacy.  When we have done so, we 
will be able to accomplish dramatic changes.  The recent passage in 
New York of a community reinvestment law that transfers a portion 
of the funds saved by closing institutions to localities for 
community services and that targets another portion for the care of 
the homeless mentally ill is an example of what cohesive advocacy 
efforts can achieve when the many voices speak as one.
<P>	E pluribus unum.
