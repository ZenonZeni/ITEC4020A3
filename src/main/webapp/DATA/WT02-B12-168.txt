Caribbean Migration to the US </h2>

<ul>


<p>

The 15 independent Caribbean nations, plus several dependencies,

have total population of about 36 million and some of the highest emigration

rates in the world.  The largest four sources of immigrants to the US from the

Caribbean are Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Jamaica and Haiti.<p>

There are also US-citizen migrants to the mainland US from Puerto

Rico--migrants from Caribbean islands who cannot get to the US sometimes

migrate to Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands.<p>

Caribbean island immigrants in the US are concentrated along the East

Coast, especially Miami and New York City.<p>

Some 125,000 Cubans embarked from Mariel for the US in a "freedom flotilla"

after Castro released them from the Peruvian Embassy on April 1, 1980.  About

2,500 others were added: criminals released from Cuban jails and mental

patients.<p>

Most Marielitos have integrated successfully.  Some 1,400, however, are in

US jails for crimes they committed in the US.  Incarcerating Marielitos who

committed crimes in the US has cost the US government an estimated $500 million

since 1980.<p>

In 1984, there were an estimated 2,700 hard-core Marielito criminals in the

US and the US persuaded Cuba to accept the return of 1,300 Marielitos.<p>

New York City says that several hundred Dominicans wanted for crimes

committed in the United States have returned home and the US wants some of them

extradited to the US for trial.  There are one million Dominicans in the US,

most in the New York City area.<p>

One candidate for New York City mayor, Ruth Messinger, took a trip to the

Dominican Republic and Haiti to increase her appeal to newly-naturalized US

citizens from these countries in New York.<p>

In Broward County in South Florida, there are an estimated 170,000

Hispanics, 12.5 percent of the county's residents.  In nearby Palm Beach

County, Hispanics number 95,282, or 9.8 percent of the population.

Sociologists say that in these diversified communities, Hispanic parents trying

to instill their cultural values in their children run into many pressures to

assimilate.  The pressures include the demand for conformity  to US culture and

anti-immigrant sentiment encountered by the children. <p>

Many Hispanic children end up living in two different worlds, each with a

different set of values.  Recent studies have found that children of Hispanic

parents lose that culture by the third or fourth generation.  The adjustment

patterns, says one intercultural expert, are no different from those of

European immigrants of the past century.  <p>

The church is one of the institutions which is a refuge from pressure to

conform.  Hispanics, who make up 35 percent of the parishioners in Coral

Springs, celebrate Mass in Spanish and the holidays of every Latin American

country.  <p>
