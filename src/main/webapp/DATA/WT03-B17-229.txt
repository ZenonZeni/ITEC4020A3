<STRONG><H2>COMPOSTING</H2></STRONG>
     The Secret  to Growing Organically is Compost. Making good compost
is  a  special  art that we all must learn if we are to  become  Master
Organic Gardeners.

<STRONG><H2>GREEN  COMPOSTING</H2></STRONG>
     30%  of  our landfill materials come from this area of our wastes.
Grass  clippings, leaves, etc. make great additions to  our  composting
system. A shredder will help to speed up the composting process.

<STRONG><H2>KITCHEN COMPOSTING</H2></STRONG>
     It  pays  to  be able to save all of your kitchen wastes. A  small
container  would  be  useful  to have  in the  kitchen  area  for  this
purpose.  Make sure it has a lid. We compost all of our kitchen  wastes
and  recycled paper wastes as well as the wood from the matches we use,
etc.,  any thing that will compost  is saved. Learning to make  compost
is  a great way to take something that is being thrown away and turn it
into  food  for the soil,  for the plants, and  food for us..  This  is
recycling  at  its best! Make sure that you empty the  container  every
day. I suggest that you can compost the kitchen wastes by layering into
your  compost.  You can also bury the kitchen wastes into  your  garden
allowing the worms a meal. Adding some rock dust to kitchen waste  will
help reduce smells and flys,and will also increase microbial activity.
