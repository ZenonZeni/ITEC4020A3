THE GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN 

THE GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN dragged on this week, with 
congressional and White House negotiators still exchanging 
philosophical barbs on Wednesday, Jan. 3, but offering no 
real retreat from hard-line positions for public view.  The 
Wall Street Journal summarized:  "Success is not at hand."  
The EPA parking lot was at least half full, however, begging 
the question as to whether a plethora of regulations and 
proposals would drop into the hopper once the government 
reopens.  More than a handful of "non-essential" workers were 
sneaking into their offices anyway.  Unlike past involuntary 
"furloughs," questions were raised as to whether employees 
would get their paychecks, half a paycheck or none at all.  
The questions were even more pressing for government 
contractors, who were looking at the possibility of layoffs.

DELANEY CLAUSE 

DELANEY CLAUSE decisions by EPA's OPPTS were among the key 
matters left hanging by the government shutdown.  EPA must 
decide whether to cancel some pesticide tolerances because 
of the anti-cancer provision of the law and whether to apply 
the clause to dried agricultural products under a definition 
which considers drying to be "processing."

A CHEMICAL SPILL 

A CHEMICAL SPILL in Bogalusa, La., in October is attracting 
dozens of lawyers, according to a Jan. 2 Fox-TV presentation 
"A Current Affair," with 50 cases already filed.  
Prominently featured was Johnnie Cochran of O.J. Simpson 
case notoriety, who accused EPA and the community of 
negligence in their emergency plan and said "somebody is 
going to be held responsible" (See Dec. 6, Page 2).  Gaylord 
Chemical Corp., the company involved in the freight train 
spill of nitrogen tetraoxide, was said to be holding 
transportation officials responsible.

UNKNOWN ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARDS 

UNKNOWN ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARDS are unlikely to be the cause of 
elevated breast cancer mortality rates in the Northeast, two 
Maryland epidemiologists wrote in the Dec. 20 Journal of the 
National Cancer Institute.  "Further reassurance is provided 
by the near absence of regional differences among younger 
women, plus the convergence of breast cancer rates across the 
country over time," wrote William Blot and Joseph McLaughlin 
of the International Epidemiology Institute in Rockville, Md.  
Their conclusion was based on an NCI statistical analysis of 
the regional distribution of breast cancer mortality in 1987.  
More research is needed to determine the role of genetic 
and/or environmental factors in breast cancer development, 
they said.

MONSANTO's ROUNDUP 

MONSANTO's ROUNDUP was noted in the Jan. 2 Wall Street 
Journal as having continued success and even dominance, 
despite the growth of competition.  The journal said 
Monsanto plans to introduce "Roundup-ready" soybean seeds 
for plants resistant to the herbicide during the 1996 spring 
planting season.  It was also noted that the firm 
aggressively cut prices during 1995.

TRICHLORFON, AN ORGANOPHOSPHORUS INSECTICIDE, 

TRICHLORFON, AN ORGANOPHOSPHORUS INSECTICIDE, has been 
suggested as the cause of such congenital abnormalities as 
Down's Syndrome among a small Hungarian population who ate 
fish contaminated with the substance in the late 1980s, said 
researcher Andrew Czetzel of the World Health Organization 
in a letter to the editor in the January 1996 issue of 
Epidemiology.  According to Czetzel, of 15 births in a small 
village in Hungary in 1989-90, 11, or 73%, were affected by 
congenital abnormalities.  Several of the women who gave 
birth had consumed fish contaminated with 100 mg per kg of 
dichlorvos, which is slowly released in fish treated with 
trichlorfon, he said.  In the study, researchers ruled out 
teratologic factors, familial inheritance and consanguinity.  
Czetzel added that the cluster ceased when the chemical 
treatment of farmed fish with trichlorfon was banned in 
March 1991.

METHYL BROMIDE AND PENTACHLOROPHENOL STUDIES 

METHYL BROMIDE AND PENTACHLOROPHENOL STUDIES by the 
California EPA Department of Pesticide Regulation are not 
yet complete, and giving manufacturers additional time to 
complete them "is a question of process and fairness, not a 
health and safety issue," said department director James 
Wells.  Wells said that California Gov. Pete Wilson Dec. 29 
called a special legislative session to consider legislation 
in the state that would allow DPR to grant manufacturers of 
the two pesticides additional time to complete the last of 
several required toxicology studies.

EPA FACING MANDAMUS WRIT REQUEST ON SEWER GROUT

EPA is faced with an inability to answer as the U.S. Court 
of Appeals for the District of Columbia considers a request 
for a writ of mandamus to compel an agency response on its 
proposed ban of acrylamide sewer grout (See Oct. 25, Page 
9).

The court on Dec. 14 upheld a mandamus request from the 
National Association of Sewer Service Companies, ordering an 
EPA response within 21 days to a NASSCO demand for an EPA 
answer.  EPA then filed a request for additional time, citing 
the furlough imposed by the government's budget impasse.

NASSCO attorneys Lynn Bergeson and Lisa Campbell opposed the 
extension in a Dec. 22 briefing that traced the chronology 
of the proposal and argued that EPA has had plenty of time.  
Among the statements by the attorneys for Weinberg, Bergeson 
& Neuman were:

-- "EPA issued the proposed rule at issue over four years 
ago.  The proposed rule seeks to abate human health risks 
that, despite the passage of time, EPA continues to 
characterize as 'unreasonable.'  These human health risks 
are apparently not unreasonable enough for EPA to take 
action, however.

-- "The Office of Management and Budget rejected the draft 
final rule and returned it to EPA on Oct. 18, 1995.  EPA 
informed NASSCO on Oct. 30, 1995, that it would not be 
withdrawing the rule by the end of October, nor would EPA 
commit to withdrawing the rule at any time in the future.  
Within 24 hours of being so advised, NASSCO submitted the 
petition on Nov. 1, 1995.

-- "Respondent (EPA) was served with the petition by first 
class mail on Nov. 1, 1995, a full seven weeks ago.  
Counsel for respondent, Jon Lipschultz, called on or about 
Nov. 15, 1995, five weeks ago, to state that he had 
received the petition and would be working on it.  Indeed, 
NASSCO notified EPA that it intended to bring court action 
to compel the issuance or withdrawal of the proposed rule 
last summer, long before respondent was actually served 
with the petition on Nov. 1, 1995.  

-- "Respondent's claim for the need for time beginning with 
the court's Dec. 14, 1995, order thus inaccurately reflects 
the amount of time that respondent has had to work on its 
response to the petition....




-- "Respondent claims that the current furlough of federal 
workers affects it ability to prepare its response.  As 
stated above, respondent had ample time before the court's 
order was issued and before the furlough commenced to 
prepare its response to the petition...."

NASSCO  concluded that "every day of continued delay in the 
issuance or withdrawal of the proposed ban harms NASSCO 
members." ((6PTCN 1002, 8 pages, $6)

INDUSTRY CALLS PROPOSED WPS DECONTAMINATION CHANGES TOO 
COSTLY

EPA's proposed modifications to Worker Protection Standard 
decontamination rules would place an economic hardship on 
growers, industry groups and trade associations said in 
comments submitted to the agency.  

Requiring decontamination facilities even after a crop has 
been harvested would be "an unjust and unduly burdensome 
economic expense to the producer," the Coalition for 
Sensible Farmworker Protection said.  

EPA published proposed WPS decontamination changes in the 
Sept. 29 Federal Register (See Aug. 23, Page 2; Sept. 27, 
Page 19).  The agency proposed to shorten the amount of time 
in which growers must provide decontamination facilities to 
between one and 15 days for most pesticides.

It would cost $4,400 to provide decontamination sites for 
1,000 acres, the coalition said, criticizing EPA's estimate 
of compliance costs as "quite low."  

"[T]he undersigned organizations continue to believe that it 
is inappropriate for the agency to require decontamination 
facilities at the end of the restricted entry interval," the 
coalition said.  The group includes state departments of 
agriculture, university agriculture departments and several 
trade associations.  Decontamination facilities should be 
required only when workers are present and have contact with 
pesticide-treated surfaces, it said.   

The coalition also criticized EPA's proposal to require 
decontamination sites for pesticides with REIs longer than 
four hours.  Such determinations should be based on a risk-
based, sound science standard, not solely on length of 
exposure, it said.

The Yuma (Ariz.) Vegetable Shippers Association also said it 
would be expensive for growers to comply with the proposed 
decontamination requirements.

The Society of American Florists asked EPA to apply the 
proposal to all pesticides, instead of only to those with 
REIs of four hours or longer.

In its comments, the American Farm Bureau Federation 
proposed a zero-day decontamination period for all 
pesticides with REIs less than four hours.  A zero-day 
decontamination requirement for these pesticides would 
encourage the use of low-toxicity pesticides, it said.  
"This makes lower-risk products more cost competitive."  
Like the Coalition for Sensible Farmworker Protection, the 
federation called the cost of decontamination kits 
"significant."

The federation also asked EPA to:

-- "eliminate the requirement for a decontamination site 
after crops are harvested; 

-- "eliminate the decontamination requirement when the REIs 
expire, and

-- "allow field workers to bring decontamination kits into 
treated areas as early entry.  EPA should allow growers to 
make similar arrangements for provision of decontamination 
kits for all types of agricultural workers."

The Georgia Department of Agriculture asked EPA to simplify 
the proposed changes by limiting the number of exceptions to 
the WPS.  "[T]here are already too many 'if/then' statements 
or exceptions....  Regulations that are simple, easily 
comprehended and have few exceptions are more likely to be 
followed....  More exceptions usually mean more complexity 
and the more likely the regulated community is to be 
confused, which adversely affects enforcement," it said.  
GDA proposed a seven-day decontamination site requirement 
after the REI expires.

Columbia, Md., resident Louis True Jr., a former EPA 
official, said EPA failed to indicate why the agency plans 
to depart from its 1992 WPS regulations.  He asked the 
agency to repropose a WPS standard instead of modifying the 
current one.  "Absent such a step, there will have been no 
reasonable opportunity for public comment on a rational 
presentation of the basis for the proposed changes, and any 
conclusions drawn by EPA would be arbitrary and capricious," 
he said.

The WPS changes EPA seeks can be achieved by a case-by-case 
review of labeling requirements rather than revising the 
1992 regulation, he said.  ((6PTCN 1001, 24 pages, $10)

EPA, HEALTH CARE PRODUCTS ARGUE OVER TIMING ISSUES

Arguments over minute details, particularly concerning 
timing, continued in the EPA FIFRA case against Health Care 
Products as EPA filed -- just before the furlough clamped 
down on the government -- an extensive brief with the Office 
of Administrative Law Judges (See Dec. 6, Page 20).

EPA noted its earlier request to have the hearing proceed 
under the name Smartel Communications instead of Celltech 
Media or Health Care Products, noting that ALJ Daniel Head 
had not allowed the filing and had ordered a schedule of 
motions from both parties.

Following the end of a first furlough last November, EPA 
said, attempts were made to contact Health Care Products 
attorney James Piccozi to set up the schedule, but to no 
avail.  EPA's problems with the later and current furlough 
were described in the agency's brief:

-- "Judge Head's Nov. 14, 1995, order, which was filed 
following a feverish and pointedly irregular flurry of 
telephonic and letter writing attempts by counsel for 
petitioner/respondent to circumvent established agency 
procedures, clearly set forth the mechanism by which 
petitioner/respondent's requests for any schedule changes 
were to be decided.

-- "In anticipation of federal shutdown which loomed and 
which in fact occurred on the very day that the judge issued 
his order, Judge Head directed that the parties consult with 
one another concerning the schedule and any alternative 
dates to be set immediately following the end of the federal 
shutdown.  It was clear from the judge's order that no 
responses to pending motions should be filed during the time 
period between the judge's order and the reopening of the 
federal government and the parties' taking the steps ordered 
by the judge.

-- "In flagrant disregard of the judge's Nov. 19, 1995, fax-
served order, on Nov. 19, 1995, petitioner/respondent 
dispatched its response to the Oct. 23, 1995, motion.  It 
did so even with the knowledge that complainant/respondent 
intended to file an amendment to its motion and could not do 
so at the time of the still-crippling federal shutdown....

-- "Petitioner/respondent appears to have attempted to 
exploit the absence of counsel for complainant/respondent 
and their inability to take any actions in this litigation 
to its unfair advantage.  It filed a document which was 
affected by the judge's order and which it should have known 
should have only been filed following the ordered 
consultation with counsel for the agency and the parties' 
subsequent report to the judge."

The brief pointed out that in addition to the controversy 
over use of the name "Smartel Communications," Piccozi had 
raised an issue as to whether the company should be called 
"Health Care Products" or "Health Care Products, Inc."  
Accusing Piccozi of demanding changes in EPA's work 
schedule, agency counsel Philip Ross, Bret Williams, Carl 
Eichenwald, Davina Pujari and Scott Garrison complained:  
"... Counsel for petitioner/respondent seems to think that 
the agency should 'drop everything' to meet the needs and 
convenience of complainant/respondent and its counsel.  
Though counsel for complainant/respondent may have 
difficulty realizing that the agency has other matters to 
which it must attend other than business that pertains to 
his client, such is indeed the case."

INDUSTRY, ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS DISAGREE ON IMPACT OF TAKINGS 
BILL

A broadly worded bill in the Senate that would compensate 
property owners and businesses adversely affected by federal 
regulation is drawing widely different reactions from 
environmental and business groups. 

The so-called takings bill could weaken pesticide 
regulations by making it prohibitively expensive for the 
government to impose usage restrictions, environmentalists 
said.  Business groups said the measure would give growers 
and landowners much-needed regulatory relief.  Either way, 
both agreed it could have a far-reaching impact on pesticide 
regulation.

Both the Senate and the House are working on so-called 
takings bills.  But while the House bill targets wetlands, 
endangered species and water use, the Senate version, 
recently approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee, 
contains broad language that could subject any regulatory 
agency to takings claims from private citizens, according to 
environmentalists. 

"Some restriction on the application of a particular 
pesticide that has the effect of reducing the yield of the 
land and therefore the short-term or long-term real estate 
values could be a taking under the definition of takings in 
this bill," said John Echeverr, general counsel for the 
National Audubon Society.  "As written, S 605 is 
extraordinarily broad and applies to any type of 
governmental regulation under any federal law," he said.

"The one exception to the bill is that if an activity 
constitutes a nuisance, then regulation on the activity does 
not constitute a taking.  But pesticide application as a 
nuisance generally doesn't have strong roots in common law," 
Echeverr said.

Agricultural Groups Support Bill's Implications

Jim Egenrieder, director of regulatory affairs for the 
Agricultural Retailers Association, said his group supports 
the broader implications of the takings bill.  "The growers 
are prohibited from using certain materials in certain areas 
without any recognition of the financial impact of some of 
those initiatives, and without going through any cost-
benefit analysis," said Egenrieder.  "I think this takings 
legislation is asking 'Should a person be compensated when 
he or she can no longer use that land because of regulatory 
or legislative action?'"

Floyd Gaibler, vice president of governmental affairs for the 
Agricultural Retailers Association, said a broad group of 15 
agricultural associations and companies signed a Dec. 5 
letter supporting the bill.  "We say it would clarify the 
takings standards that courts have not been able to clearly 
articulate," said Gaibler. 

The letter says, "The agriculture community increasingly is 
impacted by regulations which prohibit ordinary land uses 
just as effectively as if a highway were built across 
private land."  The letter goes on to say that farms are 
often collateral for operating loans, and that the 
accumulated value of land is often a landowner's primary 
source of retirement income.

Sierra Club Calls Measure Anti-environmental

The Senate takings bill "is a radical anti-environmental 
bill," said Roni Lieberman, media director for the Sierra 
Club.  "The bill distorts the meaning of American property 
rights.  In the case of pesticides, corporations could say 
they should be compensated for having to add environmental 
controls to their properties," he continued.

Lieberman also said the bill would subject agencies to 
costly review to determine possible takings effects of new 
regulation.  "This is not about property rights, which are 
protected under the constitution," said Lieberman.  "It is 
about boosting profits," he said.

Clinton Vows to Veto Senate Takings Bill

The Clinton administration charged that the Senate bill 
would create "one of the most expensive new federal spending 
programs in recent history" and block new laws to protect 
public health and safety.  In a Dec. 14 letter to Senate 
Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), Clinton 
said he would veto S 605 or any similar legislation.  This 
drew a quick response from Hatch. 

Hatch Says Regulators Would Need to Step Lightly Around 
Property Rights

"President Clinton astonishingly says this bill does not 
protect legitimate private property rights," said Hatch, who 
added that the bill creates a "system of incentives for 
agencies to reduce the number and size of the takings they 
commit." 

Hatch said a Congressional Budget Office report released in 
October suggests that the bill will not burden federal 
regulatory agencies with a lot of takings actions.  "That 
estimate concludes that the bill will have only minimal costs 
and will achieve the stated goals of the bill by encouraging 
agencies to change their behavior," said Hatch, adding that 
the provisions in the bill come out of current case law.  "So 
when we debate this bill, let's remember that many of the 
provisions of the bill are simply codifying what the Supreme 
Court has said the Fifth Amendment requires," he said.

SORGHUM PRODUCERS GROUP CHALLENGES GRANULAR CARBOFURAN 
CANCELLATION

The National Grain Sorghum Producers Association is 
preparing oral arguments in its challenge of EPA's decision 
to cancel sorghum uses for granular carbofuran.  Oral 
arguments in the case are scheduled for Feb. 22 before the 
U.S. Court of Appeals for Washington D.C.

The association said in its Nov. 22 pleading that EPA has 
no basis in the record for its conclusion that granular 
carbofuran poses an unreasonable risk to birds.  It also 
contended that EPA failed to hold a hearing on its final 
decision.

"EPA relied solely on avian mortality as the basis for its 
decision not to allow the continued use of granular 
carbofuran," the association said.  "After more than 10 
years of study, there is no evidence of birds killed by 
granular carbofuran applied in sorghum in accordance with 
its label."

The pleading charges that EPA "misapplied" data allegedly 
supporting its conclusion about avian deaths.  For 
instance, the agency referred to 41 incidents of alleged 
bird kills attributable to direct granular carbofuran 
poisoning, 25 of which were water fowls in rice fields in a 
single area in California, the pleading says, adding that 
this data is not relevant because new agricultural 
practices have eliminated water fowl deaths in rice fields.

EPA also emphasized alleged raptor kills by granular 
carbofuran without strong evidence that reported raptor 
incidents were the result of exposure to the chemical, the 
association argued.

"Not only was the analysis EPA employed deeply flawed, the 
agency ignored studies that did not support its desired 
conclusions," the group said, claiming that EPA ignored 
Maryland and Florida field studies suggesting that granular 
carbofuran, when used properly, did not cause bird deaths.

The association also accused EPA of denying its request for 
a hearing before the pesticide was canceled.  "A trial-type 
hearing would have allowed petitioner to more fully 
demonstrate the lack of evidence supporting cancellation of 
granular carbofuran on sorghum," it said.

The association claimed that cancellation of granular 
carbofuran would cause hardship on farmers who would not be 
able to find an affordable alternative to control chinch 
bugs.  "An alternative to granular carbofuran for 
controlling chinch bugs, flowable carbofuran, is more 
expensive and requires different equipment for 
application," said the pleading, which adds that the 
additional expense of this application equipment is too 
expensive for sorghum producers farming fewer than 250 
acres.  ((6PTCN 1003, 39 pages, $14)

BIOLOGICAL PEST CONTROL AGENTS  MINOR-USE PROGRAM SOUGHT

Beyond Integrated Pest Management, biological control 
methods development needs much more research, more 
government coordination and a program similar to the minor-
use pesticide development program.  These were major 
recommendations this week of a committee of the National 
Research Council's Food and Nutrition Board.

The report, "Ecologically Based Pest Management -- New 
Solutions for a New Century," was developed by the Food and 
Nutrition Board's Committee on Pest and Pathogen Control 
through Management of Biological Control Agents and Enhanced 
Cycles and Natural Processes, headed by Ralph Hardy of the 
Boyce Thompson Institute, Ithaca, N.Y.

The committee saw an "urgent need for an alternative 
approach to pest management that can complement and 
partially replace current chemically based pest management 
practices."  Noting the introduction of synthetic chemical 
pesticides in the 1940s, the committee said:

"It is now clear that their use has some unfortunate 
consequences.  Many consumers believe that trace residues of 
synthetic chemicals in food are undesirable and represent a 
significant food safety risk.  In some cases, undesirable 
environmental impacts of synthetic pesticides have caused 
consumers to oppose the use of these materials in 
agriculture and caused governments to regulate or outlaw 
their use."

Ecologically based pest management (EBPM) as proposed by the 
committee would go beyond Integrated Pest Management's 
reliance on synthetic controls and "rely primarily on inputs 
of pest biological knowledge and secondarily on physical, 
chemical and biological supplements for pest management."  
The description continued:

-- "The EBPM systems will be built on an underlying knowledge 
of the managed ecosystem, including the natural processes 
that suppress pest populations.  It is based on the 
recognition that many standard agricultural practices 
disrupt natural processes that suppress pests.

-- "In contrast to standard practices that disrupt and 
destabilize the agrosystem, agricultural practices 
recommended by EBPM will augment natural processes.  These 
practices will be supplemented by biological-control 
organisms and products, resistant plants and narrow-spectrum 
pesticides."

As to EBPM's improvement over integrated pest management, 
the committee said:  "Early IPM innovators should be 
recognized for conceiving a framework for an integrated 
approach to arthropod, weed and pathogen pest management....  
The practice of IPM, unfortunately, is not always consistent 
with the theory of IPM.  The focus of early IPM programs was 
devoted to control of insects, setting a precedent for the 
focus of IPM on arthropod pest management.  In many cases, 
this management was limited to pest scouting and precise 
applications of insecticides.  Consequently, this focus has 
been at the expense of IPM of weed and pathogen pests."

The three fundamental goals of EBPM were outlined as:  "(1) 
safety, (2) profitability and (3) durability."

The acute and chronic toxicities associated with synthetics 
generally have not been found with biological-control 
organisms, the committee said, elaborating on the second and 
third goals with:

-- "For EBPM to be successful, it must also be profitable for 
the grower....  Because producers will implement only those 
pest control methods that lower economic risks and enhance 
profits, they will insist on assurances that biologically 
based tools are cost-effective and provide consistent 
responses....

-- "EBPM strategies also must be long-lasting to have a 
positive impact on crop protection....  Decreasing the pest's 
rate of development of resistance to new inputs is essential 
for the durability of EBPM."

Noting a "large annual research and development investment 
of more than $500 million" for the production of organic 
pesticides, the committee said, "... An increased investment 
in research of biological processes will be needed to 
support the development of EBPM."

Monitoring, Certification Seen as Needed

Following an extensive description of biological control 
programs to date, the committee outlined implementation 
steps for EBPM as including:

Small-market support -- "Some of the most effective 
biological-control organisms and products in EBPM are 
projected to have modest uses or small markets, and will 
require public-sector support for regulatory approval as 
well as for research....  [T]he costs associated with 
obtaining registration can discourage commercialization of 
biological-control organisms, as is the case now for minor 
use chemical pesticides, products needed on small acreage or 
in such small markets that they lack commercial appeal.  In 
the same way that public funds help with approval processes 
of minor use chemical pesticides by regulatory agencies, 
public investment can ensure continued progress for 
biological technologies."

Certification -- "Organized efforts to increase distribution 
of high-quality biological tools will facilitate grower 
acceptance of EBPM.  The procedure of crop seed 
certification by state agencies guarantees that new 
cultivars are genetically pure and that noxious weeds, 
arthropods and pathogens are below detection limits.  Each 
certification board tests, increases, releases and 
distributes new field crops according to predetermined 
standards....  Such a process of release benefits the 
individual grower with valuable information on product 
performance and quality, lowering the risk of adoption."

Monitoring pests -- "Monitoring for the potential development 
of resistance by pest organisms is key to managing the long-
term viability of ecologically based systems....  The 
importance of monitoring pest populations in individual 
fields is critical to the accurate assessment of tactics 
aimed at delaying pest resistance to biological control."

Emphasizing the importance of "durability" of biological 
solutions, the committee said it "must be managed through 
collective action" and continued:

-- "An effective mechanism currently used to delay pest 
resistance is the coordination of pest control activities 
among growers (National Audubon Society, 1994); sharing pest 
monitoring activities and collected information is useful in 
developing countermeasures that will limit additional crop 
losses.

-- "Practices, comparable to the use of mixtures and multilines 
to conserve the durability of plant resistance genes, can be 
developed and put into practice in order to enhance the 
durability of valuable biological-control organisms and 
products.  Efforts to do this can be coordinated by industry, 
perhaps modeled on such organizations as the fungicide 
resistance working group, which is dedicated towards 
developing practices and implementation recommendations to 
enhance the long-term use of fungicides.  Cooperative efforts 
among researchers, industrial suppliers and growers can 
increase the durability of these biological tools."

Gaps and Inconsistencies in Public Oversight Listed

After devoting 19 small-type pages to research priorities 
and methods of accelerating research, including changes in 
institutional approaches, the committee's report delved into 
public oversight.  Listing "gaps and inconsistencies in 
current oversight" programs, the committee said in part:

-- "... The complexities and anomalies of the current system 
may be attributed to the overlapping jurisdiction of several 
agencies and the diversity of organisms to be regulated, and 
the attempt to make the decision-making 'template' developed 
for registration of conventional chemical pesticides 
applicable to biologically based controls.

-- "Current federal oversight generally evaluates the risks 
of biological-control macroorganisms using the procedures 
developed for exotic plant pests under the Federal Plant 
Pest Act (FFPA); microbial biological-control agents are 
subject to oversight procedures developed for chemical 
pesticides under (FIFRA).  Neither set of procedures is 
tailored for registration of biological-control agents; 
therefore, both pose unnecessary barriers to registration of 
biological-control organisms."

 'Dual Review' at EPA

Noting that EPA reviews killed products under TSCA and 
others under FIFRA, the committee said the situation 
"results in a dual review process within EPA, with the 
manufacturing portion of the process reviewed separately 
from the field release of the killed microbial pesticide."  
The distinctions in TSCA and FIFRA for review of "chemical 
intermediates" is irrelevant for microbial pesticides, the 
committee said.  The discussion of oversight continued:

-- "The existing fragmented oversight process employs 
different assessment criteria to biological-control 
organisms that pose similar human or environmental risks, 
resulting in unnecessary scrutiny of some low-risk organisms 
and almost complete lack of regulatory review of others.

-- "The most important inconsistency is the differential 
treatment of macroorganisms by USDA/APHIS under FFPA and of 
microorganisms by EPA under FIFRA.  For example, neither EPA 
nor APHIS regulates nonpathogenic nematodes, whereas both 
agencies regulate microorganisms.  In addition, microbes are 
exempt from oversight if vectored by a nonpathogenic, 
indigenous macroorganism (such as a nematode).  There is no 
clearly defined process for risk assessment of biological-
control macroorganisms that are not plant pests, resulting in 
indecisiveness in granting permits for field release....

-- "To provide appropriate oversight of biological-control 
organisms and products, USDA, EPA and other federal and 
state agencies with oversight authority should jointly 
develop criteria and protocols specifically for the testing, 
registration and use of living control organisms, 
biological-control products or plants resistant to pests or 
diseases.

-- "No formal oversight structure exists for traditionally 
bred resistant plants, whereas genetically engineered 
resistance will, it appears, be subject to close scrutiny.  
A question confronting policy makers is whether host plant 
resistance accomplished through genetic engineering should 
receive a higher degree of scrutiny than resistance achieved 
through traditional plant breeding.  Such a distinction 
embedded in regulatory practice would not necessarily 
reflect differences between actual human or environmental 
health risks posed by the two technologies."

Options for Improvement Outlined

Calling for departure from current oversight practice, the 
committee said agencies' criteria for risk assessment must 
vary with the possibilities presented by each organism, 
product or resistant plant.  Suggesting the desirability of 
Technical Advisory Groups, the committee characterized these 
as "a consortium of representatives from government and 
research established to provide advice to the government on 
the safety of biological organisms for weed control."  The 
committee emphasized:

"The U.S. EPA and the USDA, currently responsible for 
oversight of pesticide regulations, should develop and 
publish a guide to risk criteria, data requirements and 
oversight procedures that apply to importation, movement, 
introduction, testing and release or registration of 
biological-control organisms or products."

The 89-page report concluded:

-- "... Principles of ecology that lay the foundation of EBPM 
must be incorporated into implementation and oversight.  An 
important goal of EBPM is to restore and preserve balance to 
the managed ecosystem by duplicating natural processes to the 
maximum extent possible.  

-- "Risk assessment also should reflect that principle.  
Biological-control products must be developed and implemented 
in ways that complement managed ecosystems and facilitate the 
biological and natural controls already existing to suppress 
pests.

-- "Monitoring of new products and processes is key.  The 
resultant information will lead to early identification of 
durability problems.  The knowledge gained from this 
monitoring of the dynamic interactions among organisms will 
increase the understanding needed to manage old and new pests 
in a safe, profitable and durable way."
