<P>The new report<I> Motor Vehicle Emission Regulations and Fuel Specifications
in Europe and the United States-1995 update </I>(report 5/95) is available
from CONCAWE. For the first time, the report restricts itself to events
in Europe and the United States in view of the large amount of information
to be reported. A worldwide update is planned for 1997 (meanwhile report
4/94 should be retained for information on countries outside Europe and
the United States).<br>

<B>EUROPE</b></CENTER>
<P>The update includes an account of the European Auto/Oil Programme, the
EU Commission initiative that resulted from Directive 94/12/EC which required
the submission of proposals for further reductions in exhaust emissions
by 1 June 2000. It also covers the regulatory regime of European countries
that do not comply with European Union (EU) regulations. Recent EU members
Austria, Finland and Sweden are undergoing a four-year transitional period
after which their regulations will either be harmonized with those of the
EU or further renegotiated. Austria has adopted EU directives for passenger
cars and light- and heavy-duty vehicles but not those for mopeds and motorcycles.
Finland has adopted those for cars and heavy-duty vehicles, and Norway has
adopted all relevant EU directives. A number of countries from central and
eastern Europe are expected to join the EU by the year 2000 (Poland and
Hungary have already applied), by which time they plan to have brought their
environmental legislation in line with that of the EU. It is thought that
the Czech Republic has conformed to EU regulations since 1992/93 and that
these regulations also apply in Slovakia.<BR>
<BR>
Although a benzene content of no more than 5 per cent by volume is specified
for all gasolines in EU countries, several countries have or are about to
have lower limits. In Italy, for example, a 3 per cent limit was adopted
on 1 January 1993. In 1995, voluntary agreements were made with oil companies
to further limit benzene content (e.g. 1.8 per cent). A ministerial decree
passed in September 1995 requires that from 1 July 1997 a 1.4 per cent limit
will apply to all Italy's gasolines, and will reduce to 1 per cent from
July 1999.<br>

<P> In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA) has issued a Final Rule that will apply California Air Resources Board
(CARB) low emission standards (LEV) for light-duty vehicles to members of
the Ozone Transport Commission (OTC, which comprises the District of Colombia
and 12 eastern states) with effect from the 1999 model year. The rule will
allow, but not require states to adopt zero emission levels (ZEV). The EPA
has proposed an alternative national LEV schedule which will involve a phased
introduction of the Californian LEV, with all states adopting Californian
LEVs by the model year 2001. Under the Clean Air Act, the EPA has no authority
to promulgate such standards, which can thus only be adopted by voluntary
agreements<BR>

<p>.The OTC states are working towards a voluntary agreement with
motor manufacturers but the desire of some states to adopt ZEVs has been
a stumbling block. The EPA has assured the oil industry that it will not
impose nationwide gasoline standards as part of a national LEV programme,
unlike the Californian programme which will require very low-sulphur (30
ppm) reformulated gasoline.<br>
The report highlights the growing intricacies of US legislation. CONCAWE's
summary of the 'complex model' for certifying reformulated gasolines runs
to some twelve pages, incorporating 21 tables. Similarly, the regulations
controlling the mandatory use of deposit control additives in gasoline has
been distilled down to four pages, including two tables. The implications
of these changes, in terms of the administration burden alone, cannot yet
be estimated. What is clear, however, is that a vast array of records must
be kept accurately, since missing data, any misclassification of gasoline,
inconsistency between blending and shipping records, or other record-keeping
problems all constitute a violation of the regulations. The associated penalty
is up to $25 000 per day, per violation.<br>

<TABLE border=0 cellspacing=2 cellpadding=6> <tr>
<td valign="top" align="left">

<p>In the area of heavy-duty vehicles and buses, the EPA, CARB and members
of the automobile engine industry have signed a Statement of Principles
on how to achieve a NOx emissions limit of 2.0 grams per brake horse power
per hour (g/bhp.h) by the year 2004. The EPA is expected to make a final
rule on alternative limits of non-methanic hydrocarbons (NMHC) + NOx of
2.4 g/bhp.h or NMHC+NOx of 2.5 g/bhp.h plus a maximum NMHC of 0.5 g/bhp.h.
The automobile industry has agreed to meet these standards on the understanding
that the EPA will not further reduce particulate standards for diesel engines
nor CO emissions requirements for spark-ignition engines. Furthermore, the
EPA is required to assess the effects of fuel parameters on emissions so
that any needed changes in fuel quality can be legislated by October 2003.
It is calculated that the NOx reductions in the Statement of Principles
will reduce emissions by 900 000 tons a year by the year 2020 (by which
time the truck and bus fleet will have been entirely replaced).<BR>

CARB has published the specification for a reference diesel fuel (see table)
against which suppliers have to measure the performance of their products.
Any fuel is allowed that has equivalent emissions to this reference fuel.
A number of Californian suppliers have produced alternative composition
fuels which testing shows meet these criteria overall, although most have
a much higher cetane number and somewhat more aromatics than the reference
fuel. Thus the strict limits specified in the table do not necessarily have
to be complied with on all points.
