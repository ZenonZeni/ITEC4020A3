<H1>Third Stage of Radionuclides Release.</H1>
<HR>
     The next, the third stage of the accident is characterized by 
fast increase of the release power(<A HREF = "rstages.gif">picture of stages</A>), at first with predominance  of 
the  volatile  component,  especially  of  iodine,  and  then  the 
composition became again close to the fuel one. The  approximation 
of the release power in this period is the following: 
<P> 
           Q(t) = 0.09.exp(0.35.(t-5)), day  .           (2) 
<P> 
     The release at this stage was attributed to fuel heating over 
2000 C  by  the  residual   heat   release.   As   a   result   of 
temperature-dependent migration of  decay  products  and  chemical 
conversions of uranium dioxide, the decay  products  were  released 
in the form of aerosols or of the particles  of  graphite  burning 
products.
