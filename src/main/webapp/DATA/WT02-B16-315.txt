<B>Development of a Fiber-Optic Sensor for Hydrogen Leak Detention;<br>

<P>

Because there are both real and perceived risks associated with using 
hydrogen fuel, 

particularly in passenger vehicles, we will have to take extensive 
safety precautions in designing 

vehicle systems, including such features as hydrogen leak detectors.  
Conventional hydrogen gas 

sensors require electrical wiring and may be too expensive to install in 
many different places 

within a vehicle.  In this project, we are developing a reversible, 
thin-film, chemochromic sensor 

that can be applied to the end of a polymer optical fiber.  The presence 
of hydrogen gas will 

cause the film to become darker.  A light beam transmitted from a 
central instrument in the 

vehicle along the sensor fibers will be reflected from the ends of the 
fiber back to individual light 

detectors.  A decrease in the reflected light signal will indicate the 
presence and concentration of 

hydrogen in the vicinity of the fiber sensor.

<P>

The principal of this detection scheme has already been demonstrated by 
scientists in 

Japan.  However, our goal is to optimize the basic sensor design to 
speed up the response time 

and avoid false readings.

Photocatalytic compounds in particulate form are being employed

in a dual-bed configuration to effect the solar-driven decomposition

of water to its constituent elements, particularly hydrogen. 

The system advantages are low manufacturing cost, safe evolution

of H<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> in separate vessels, and more 
efficient use of the

solar spectrum.  Having tested numerous redox couples against

InP and TiO<sub>2</sub>, we may have found two redox couples that can 
effect

O<sub>2</sub>-evolution in one system and H<sub>2</sub>-evolution in the 
other.  They

are iodide/iodate (T/IO<sub>3</sub>) and bromide/bromate 
(Br/BrO<sub>3</sub>).  These

are intrinsically alkaline systems, since they will conproportionate

at neutral pH and below to form the respective halogen gases:

<P>

The characteristics of these two mediators exemplify what is desired

in a redox mediator.  High solubility, rapid charge transfer kinetics,

optical transparency for both oxidized and reduced forms, and

intermediate redox potential.  The oxidized form (Ox) of the mediator

was run against TiO<sub>2</sub>, while the reduced form (Red) was run 
against

InP.  Now we are testing a more realistic situation, where 
H<sub>2</sub>-evolution

will need to proceed against some background concentration of

Ox, and O<sub>2</sub>-evolution will need to proceed against some 
background

concentration of Red.  Development is under way of methods for

monitoring reaction progress via the mediator instead of H<sub>2</sub> 
or

O<sub>2</sub> gas evolution.
