<H3>Looking Forward </H3>
<HR>

<P>
This project was the result of two separate activities: the interpretation
of landcover disturbance from satellite data and the integration
of these interpretations with ancillary data.
<P>
A satellite data-set was used because it was contemporary, objectively
acquired, and digitally malleable.
<P>
The ancillary data-sets were used to interpret (landcover, tenure),
enhance (feral animals and fire), and report (ILZ, ELZ, States
and Territories) the interpreted satellite data.
<P>
The objective was to present an assessment of the landcover disturbance
for the continent, and to interpret this assessment in terms of
present and potential loss of biodiversity.
<P>
The acceptance of the findings presented here is largely determined
by the credibility of the interpretation of landcover disturbance
from satellite data because it underpins all else. The interpretation
that was finally used was one of many that were exhaustively tested
during the lifetime of this project.
<P>
Errors of commission and omission were unavoidable. We strove
to minimise both. Nonetheless, uncertainty remains: most critically
with the assessment of clearing. Where possible, we tested our
findings against other estimates to indicate the direction and
magnitude of error.
<P>
The results are presented in a pragmatic spirit of applied science
- to present the best continental picture possible at this time.
This is the same spirit and intent that motivated the publication
of the Atlas of Australian Resources series; in particular, the
most recent Vegetation volume; <A HREF="refs.htm">AUSLIG (1990)</A>.
Australia is, as the result of considerable effort, a well-mapped
continent. This raft of resource knowledge supports not only government
policies but also public debate about those policies. We hope
that this work will also contribute to a better understanding
of the Australian continent.
<P>
Five significant points emerged at the end of this study. The
first was that the level of thinning and clearing was high. Even
allowing for an omission error as high as 20%, the area was much
larger than has been generally appreciated. Most of this unrecognised
clearing was in the traditional pastoral areas of Queensland and
Northern NSW where areas of sown pastures have expanded at the
expense of open eucalypt and acacia woodlands. Also, to a much
smaller extent, we suspect that there has been a loss of large
remnants within the core areas of the croplands. This speculation
will only be tested by a continental study of the rate of change
over the last few decades.<HR>

<P>

<HR>

<P>
The aggregate tables of clearing and the graphics illustrating
fragmentation of clearing do not convey the same impact as the
view from space. The established cereal cropping areas of southern
Australia present a particularly bleak panorama: especially those
of Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia. They are extensively
cleared. As habitats, they are irreversibly altered. Those remnants
remaining are both small and isolated.<HR>

<P>
<A HREF="photocd/0648_032.gif"><IMG SRC="photocds/0648_032.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></A>
<HR>

<P>
The second point was that the ELZ was, in contrast to the ILZ,
much less disturbed by grazing landuse on a continental scale.
This reduced level of disturbance owes more to the intrinsic resilience
of the more extensive landcover types, the grasslands and low
shrublands, than to the conservative management of pastoral landuse,
past and present.<HR>

<P>
<A HREF="photocd/1864_061.gif"><IMG SRC="photocds/1864_061.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></A>
<HR>

<P>
Considered together, the disturbance of clearing and grazing must
have been, and will continue to be, a significant driver of the
process of biotic erosion. The landcovers that have been most
disturbed are the best country; those that enjoy the highest rainfall
and therefore have the highest productivity. While we do not yet
have the quantitative functional relationships to support this
conclusion, we believe it must be so. Between them, the landuses
of agriculture and pastoralism have 'taken the eyes of the land'.
The case studies support this view.<HR>

<P>
<A HREF="map/adelaid.gif"><IMG SRC="maps/adelaid.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></A>
<HR>

<P>
The third point was the exacerbating impact of feral animals.
Where landuse disturbance was high, so also was the density of
feral animals.
<P>
The next point was not illustrated by data in this report but
it bears heavily on any conclusions that can be drawn from it.
Simply: Of the two drivers of future biotic erosion, the contribution
of landuse, from clearing and poor grazing management is manageable
while that from feral animals is not; or not yet, although concerted
efforts are underway to achieve this goal.
<P>
Finally, the basic premise of this project - that there is a relationship
between disturbance and biodiversity - remains qualitative and
the limiting factor in translating this or any other measure of
landcover disturbance into quantitative estimates of biotic erosion.
While we hold that habitat destruction by clearing or grazing,
and habitat invasion by feral species are the two most significant
drivers of biotic erosion, we cannot translate the assessments
we have compiled here into any action.
<P>
Why not?
<P>
Two key relationships are missing. These are for any landcover
type, the relationship between species abundance and disturbance,
and between the level of endemism and the level of disturbance
threat.
<P>
These two relationships are considered sequentially. The <B>first
relationship</B>, displays species abundance within a landcover
type as a function of its use of landcover geography; ie in space
and time (x, y, z, t). While this relationship is strictly a multidimensional
surface, and not necessarily continuous, three hypothetical responses
are presented. Whatever the shape of the curve, it represents
a means of evaluating the current level of Threat. That is, given
this general relationship and actual measures of the current state
of landscape disturbance dimensioned in (x, y, z, t), then the
species response to Threat, in terms of its abundance in time
and space, can then be estimated.<HR>

<P>
<IMG SRC="chart/chap6/fig61.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> 
<P>
<I>An idealised framework for relating species abundance in time
and space to the time and space dimensions of habitat disturbance.
Three plausible response relationships are presented: a species
declines in linear proportion to the degree of disturbance (1);
a species shows resilience, then catastrophe (2); a species is
highly sensitive to disturbance (3).</I><HR>

<P>
The <B>second relationship</B> is between threat to a landcover
type and the level of endemism within that species complement.
We presume that endemism is the ultimate measure of irreplaceability.
Landcover types will be distributed within this two dimensional
space as indicated by hypothetical examples. The purpose of mapping
this relationship is to determine priority for action. Even the
simplest partition of this space into two levels, low and high,
would be more informative than our current understanding.<HR>

<P>

<P>
<I>Hypothetical relationships between the overall level of species
endemism for landcover types and the level of Threat to which
each landcover type is exposed. By partitioning this space into
high and low, priorities for management can be rationally determined.
For example, landcover types 2 and 7 score the highest priority
for conservation management.</I><HR>

<P>
In closing, we bring attention to the issue of the location and
rate of landcover change; the dynamics of disturbance that was
outside the scope of this project.
<P>
Obviously, clearing was an essential part of agricultural development.
However, land degradation is an unnecessary consequence of poor
pastoral management.
<P>
The expansion of these two agents of landcover disturbance has
been driven and controlled by social forces, both local and international.
<P>
These forces are dynamic. Highly favourable commodity export prices
for wool, grain and beef come and go: those for the first two
are unlikely to ever be quite so favourable as in the past.
<P>
In the last two decades, changes in the values society attaches
to all the resources that land has to offer have found political
expression with most State Governments altering legislation, or
its management expression, relating to clearing and to pastoral
management. The motivation has been a long-term concern about
sustainability, and the expensive experience that the past approaches
were not perfect.
<P>
Given these changes, what are the dynamics of landcover change?
<P>
It is surprising, given the pivotal role of this question, that
it cannot be accurately answered; see <A HREF="refs.htm">Biodiversity Unit (1995)</A>.
<P>
An aggregate, non-spatial summary from data held by the ABS has
been compiled but not yet published by Bullen (F. Bullen, personal
communication). This time series shows the great expansion of
clearing post-World War II. This clearing was both for cereal
crops (WA, SA, NSW and Qld) and for pastures (principally Qld).
<P>
Noting that these ABS figures report less than 50% of the area
that we have found to be thinned and cleared, they also suggest
that clearing is slowing. However, non-systematic sampling surveys
using satellite data show the loss of uncleared remnants within
the core agricultural land continues; <A HREF="refs.htm">Graetz et al (1992), Sivertsen (1994)</A>.
In terms of biotic erosion, the loss of these remnants is far
more critical than indicated by their small areas.<HR>

<P>
<IMG SRC="chart/chap6/fig63.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> 
<P>
<I>The historical time course of clearing for crops and pastures.
Since the beginning of this century, the area cleared for pastures
has exceeded that for crops culminating in a marked expansion
from 1950 onwards.</I><HR>

<P>
Land management decisions at the level of the individual and of
governments will continue to influence the rate and direction
of the process of biotic erosion. The objective of this project
was to provide a contemporary assessment of the landcover condition
of the continent. This assessment in a small way will support
that decision making.<HR>
