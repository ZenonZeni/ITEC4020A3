ABSTRACT Describes the new, 6.3 million pounds John Cabot City
Technology College near Bristol. The school, which houses 900
pupils, had to meet design criteria laid down by the Department
for Education's (DfE) Design Note 17 plus certain requirements
from Cable and Wireless, such as information technology links
with its own recently completed training college in Coventry.
Deals with the service strategy of avoiding complex equipment,
using systems of proven technology with low maintenance requirements
and maximising the use of natural light and ventilation. Notes
the use of blinds, cross-ventilation with ventilating 'chimneys'
at ceiling level, and heating by radiators with low temperature
hot water and underfloor heating for the main hall. Describes
the heating plant and electrical services, with lighting above
DfE guidance levels. Illustrates diagrammatically the environmental
strategies for different parts of the building and summarises
important facts about the building in a table.

ABSTRACT Presents an overview of the design of the building with
about 100,000m2 of accommodation, which provides new laboratories
for electrical and mechanical engineering students plus general
teaching spaces and two auditoria. Located at the heart of the
city centre campus, conventional wisdom would suggest that much
of the building should be mechanically ventilated, if not air
conditioned. However nearly all the laboratories and teaching
spaces are naturally ventilated and daylit, including the two
150-seat auditoria. Describes the development of the design and
the environmental strategy incorporated within it from an early
stage.

ABSTRACT A new university classroom building was subject to numerous
complaints of poor indoor air quality during the first eight months
of occupancy. This study was conducted in response to those complaints.
The object was to determine how well the ventilation system performed
by measuring levels of metabolically augmented carbon dioxide.
Carbon dioxide levels were measured by a direct-read infrared
analyser in each of nine classrooms and three hallway corridors.
Tests were conducted during six sampling days in the spring of
1985 and seven sampling days in the autumn of 1985. The performance
of the ventilation system, based on measurements of carbon dioxide
levels, appeared to be relatively poor during the first three
sampling days of April 1985. In some classrooms carbon dioxide
levels were close to or exceeded 2500 ppm. These sampling dates
coincided with complaints of poor indoor air quality being received
by physical plant personnel the variable air volume HVAC system
was subject to numerous mechanical and operating problems at the
same time. However, in late spring and early autumn carbon dioxide
levels were observed to be consistently below the new ASHRAE ventilation
standard of 1000 ppm. This performance indicates that a variable
air volume HVAC system can be operated to provide a consistently
adequate level of ventilation in a classroom building.

ABSTRACT In September 1988 a unique Swedish building research
project will have passed the half-way mark of a three year project
assessment. The User-Healthy Day Nursery has been designed and
built to minimise the risk of indoor climate problems. The materials
have been carefully chosen and inspected, and wherever possible,
low-risk materials and construction methods have been chosen.
The Nursery is equipped with a very flexible heating and ventilation
system to facilitate various combinations of operating mode and
settings. The resulting ventilation efficiency, indoor air quality,
thermal climate and acoustic properties are measured according
to a detailed time schedule. The staff at the Nursery is regularly
interviewed regarding their impression of the indoor climate.
Results from the evaluation of this on-going full-scale experiment
are gratifying.

ABSTRACT Low-mass, light structures, such as many recent school
designs can become uncomfortably warm in hot weather, and correction
by mechanical air conditioning can be costly. The problem was
studied some time ago by the Hungarian Institute for Building
Science by means of computer calculations and model tests, described
here. The results show the importance of careful design and of
orientation, and the potential for adiabatic control, namely where
heat entering the system is balanced by ventilation. The results
of different directional ventilation arrangements are outlined.

ABSTRACT The optimal and permissible limit values of indoor temperatures
associated with the mental performance of students have been the
subject of tests for several years all over the world. This problem
is of great importance economically as well because of the need
for building techniques and/or climate technology to influence
indoor climates. It is necessary to know the temperature limit
values of the room and the important data associated with the
influence of these values exerted on the mental performance of
the students. The results of a simulation test (which were made
at the Hungarian Institute for Building Science) are elaborated

ABSTRACT The design of many institutional HVAC systems is such
that the sensible cooling load is met in the occupied zones before
the system is able to remove the excessive moisture from the air,
resulting in humidity levels in the occupied zones at or just
slightly below that of the outside humidity during periods of
peak humidity levels. The problems encountered in the occupied
zones of these buildings can result in a significant cost from
damage to the building structure and furnishings and to the health
of the occupants. Three school buildings were investigated to
examine the effect of a lack of humidity control in school buildings.
Each of the school buildings had HVAC systems that provided insufficient
humidity control. In each of the schools, a majority of the occupants
complained of respiratory illnesses.

ABSTRACT An elementary school in Pennsylvania was tested in the
spring of 1990 and discovered to have elevations ranging from
5.5 to 76 pCi/l in 25 different rooms. The school is divided between
an older wing that is a slab on grade with an access tunnel around
the perimeter and a newer wing that has half the classrooms over
a slab and the other half over a walk out multipurpose room, kitchen
and maintenance room. Although typically the operation of a univent
heater will reduce radon concentrations in a room because of the
introduction of outside air, it was discovered however that in
the older wing of the school, the heaters were responsible for
a significant portion of the radon entering the classrooms. This
paper is a review of the operation of the univent heaters and
alterations to the units and the operation of the building in
order to determine the radon pathways and how they might be controlled.

ABSTRACT Uncontrolled airflow, including duct leakage, pressure
imbalances caused by closed interior doors, and exhaust/intake
airflow imbalance, was characterized in 70 commercial buildings.
In 18 of these buildings, uncontrolled airflows were repaired
and energy savings from these repairs were monitored. In most
buildings, the retrofit was duct repair. In other cases, outdoor
airflow was reduced and return air transfers were provided. Cooling
energy use was reduced by an average 15.1% in these 18 buildings.
With an average repair cost of $455 and average cooling energy
savings of $195 per year, uncontrolled airflow retrofits proved
to be very cost-effective. Various factors indicate that greater
energy savings could be achieved in the future.

ABSTRACT An investigation was conducted of the effect of decreasing
the air leakage area across internal partitions of a typical modern
high-rise apartment. The objective of this work was to study the
practicality of increased compartmentalization or separation of
the living units from each other and from the corridors and vertical
shafts in the building. Typically, the main barrier to air movement
through a high-rise apartment building is the exterior skin or
envelope. Walls and doors between corridors, units and elevator
shafts and stairwells are much less airtight, and significant
volumes of air can move between these different areas of the building
interior under relatively small pressure differences. Some disadvantages
of this arrangement are that individual occupants can affect air
movement through the entire building by leaving windows or balcony
doors open in their units, odours and pollutants produced in one
area of the building may be transferred to other areas, exterior
walls and windows have large pressure differences across them
which drives air and rain through any defect, and special measures
to control smoke migration during fires must be provided. The
objectives of this study were to measure the actual pressure differences
across various separations within a high-rise apartment building,
to generate and analyze potential ways of reducing the air leakage
through these separations, and to draw conclusions on their effects
on air movement in the building, including changes in operation
of typical current ventilation strategies and fire and smoke control
measures.

ABSTRACT This study deals with the modeling of air pollution in
apartments from laboratory measurements of source strengths, using
formaldehyde and Total Volatile Organic Compounds (TVOCs) as model
pollutants. The sources in two test apartments were grouped into
two building-related sources and occupant-related sources. The
measured source strengths and ventilation rates were used for
the prediction of concentrations expected in the apartments. These
predictions were compared to measurements in the apartment over
12 months. The conclusions were that the model predictions based
on emission rates measured in the laboratory can be used to predict
the long-term concentration of the two model pollutants in the
apartments. Considering the measured differences in ventilation
between the apartments, and occupant emission rate of between
0.2 and 0.3 mg/h/kg body weight could be estimated. Based on previous
suggested limits of acceptable exposures of humans to VOCs, an
acceptable average emission rate of VOCs from building materials
in general was estimated to be about 30 ug/m2/h. The modeling
showed that during the first 200 days, building materials dominated
the emissions. After this, sources relating to the occupants dominated.
On average about half of the VOC pollution originated from the
building materials.

ABSTRACT Heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning (HVAC) operation
can play a crucial role in controlling indoor radon concentrations.
Both the introduction of fresh air and the pressurization of an
indoor radon concentration levels. Using an in-house computer
model, this paper examines the impact of configurational and operational
parameters of a building and HVAC system on indoor radon concentrations
in a large building. To achieve this, a three-phase approach was
followed. Based on the results of the parametric analysis, inferences
are drawn about the influence of the parameters on indoor radon
concentrations and the efficacy of radon mitigation strategies
is examined. Results indicate that building ventilation rate and
the OA/EA ratio are significant parameters that affect indoor
radon concentration.

ABSTRACT Air velocities in the occupied zone were measured in
a full-size, slot-outlet and slot-inlet ventilated (SOSIV), unoccupied
room. The measurements were taken at different room heights with
two outlet/inlet locations, five levels of outlet jet momentum,
with and without floor heating. the near floor air-flow in the
SOSIV room possesses velocity and turbulence profiles similar
to those of a fully developed wall jet. The velocity and turbulence
profiles measured at the rooms mid-length are similar, with each
representing the mirror image of the other. A full model was proposed
to predict the floor-level air velocity in the SOSIV room. For
a given room aspect ratio and a given outlet/inlet location, the
floor-level air velocity can be uniquely determined by the jet
momentum ratio under isothermal conditions and is determined by
both the jet momentum ratio and the thermal buoyancy under nonisothermal
conditions. The outlet and inlet locations and the room aspect
ratio can significantly affect the floor-level air velocity. The
results can be applied to industrial plants and agricultural buildings.

ABSTRACT This paper presents the results of a series of laboratory
measurements of room air and contaminant distribution in a full-scale
test room with mixing ventilation. The measurements were performed
to investigate how parameters such as air change rate, supply
air temperature, contaminant source location, and contaminant
density would influence the distribution of room air and contaminants
and to what extend complete mixing was achievable. The results
are also useful for validation of computational fluid dynamics
(CFD) calculations of both room air and contaminant distribution.

ABSTRACT Proper distribution of conditioned air plays an important
role in both the comfort of the occupants and the air quality
of ventilated or air-conditioned spaces. Conditioned air should
be supplied in proper quantities and temperatures to meet various
thermal requirements of occupied spaces. Large air velocities,
temperature gradients, and turbulence intensities should be avoided
since these factors, either individually or combined, may cause
draft, which is undesirable for occupants. The main objectives
of this study were to evaluate the air distribution performance
index (ADPI) based on measured centerline data and determine the
effect of turbulence on ADPA. The data were collected in a large
test room (24 by 16 by 9ft) with a high sidewall grille. The air-flow
characteristics at the centerline of the room for 21 test cases
under both isothermal and nonisothermal flow conditions were investigated.
The results showed that ADPI results were strongly dependent on
the room heat load and the airflow rate. The effect of turbulence
on ADPI was investigated using a comfort model, and a modified
ADPI model was presented. The results showed that the turbulence
intensity strongly affected ADPI values at high airflow rates.

ABSTRACT The air flow characteristics induced by discharging air
into a climate chamber with and without a high sidewall grill
were studied experimentally. Over five hundred and thirty thousand
values of the air speed were collected at positions above the
floor level, near the supply inlet and the exhaust outlet. The
thermal comfort indices due to temperature and air speed were
measured under five flow conditions, two with a diffuser and three
without a diffuser. An evaluation of thermal comfort using the
air diffusion performance index (ADPI) and percentage dissatisfied
(PD) was made. Macroscopic numbers describing the air flow studied
were, the Archimedes number, the Reynolds number and the jet momentum
number. The Reynolds number and the jet momentum number increased
as the total supply flow rate increased. However, the Archimedes
number decreased with increasing flow rates. The Archimedes number
was found to be correlated with the Reynolds number, which might
be because they are defined by parameters related to the air velocity
V and temperature difference. The ADPI was found to be linearly
related to the jet momentum number and related directly to the
PD. The throw of the diffuser was found to be related to the corrected
Archimedes number. The jet momentum number and Archimedes number
are related to the air speed, the root mean square of the air
speed and the turbulence intensity.

ABSTRACT The test results are presented from three Reynolds-stress
models (two isotropization of production models and a quasi-isotropic
model) and the standard k-e model for predicting typical airflow
in a room. The flow patterns studied are natural convection, forced
convection and mixed convection in a room and an impinging jet
flow. Experimental data from the literature is used for validation.
The results show that the computations and the experimental data
are in agreement for the mean air velocities, but less satisfactory
for the turbulent quantities. The performance of the three Reynolds-stress
models is similar, they all predict anisotropic turbulence and
secondary recirculation existing in a room airflow for which the
k-e model fails. However, the Reynolds-stress models require additional
computing effort compared to the k-e model.

ABSTRACT The technique of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) was
used to study the indoor air flow field in mechanically ventilated
and air-conditioned spaces. Numerical experiments were performed
in six test sites of different sizes and ventilation configurations.
Typical mechanical ventilation or air-conditioning systems were
installed in those sites so that the evaluation of results of
the system performance would be useful for assessing other similar
systems. The predicted results were analysed and compared with
experimental measurements. More importantly, the potential use
of the predicted results was illustrated. Correlation relationships
between the flow field characteristics and the macroscopic design
parameters were established.

ABSTRACT Fluid mass and energy flows in air-conditioning systems
vary with the changing output demand. In lengthy or complex ductwork
and pipework, the accuracy in simulating the dynamic network behavior
is greatly affected by the accuracy in modeling the radial energy
losses and the axial transport lag. Transport delay consideration
is also vital in the study of heat exchanger dynamics. This paper
reviews the development of transport delay models in fluid conduit
flow. A new numerical model is recommended in which the thermal
behavior of fluid elements can be traced per physical distance
traveled in unit time step. Justifications by sensitivity and
frequency response analyses were performed. The results of analytical,
experimental, as well as intermodel comparisons demonstrate the
promising accuracy of the numerical model introduced.

ABSTRACT The 1994 Great Energy Predictor Shootout II (GEPS) sponsored
by ASHRAE Technical Committees TC 4.7, Energy Calculations and
TC 1.5, Computer Applications, involved modeling/predicting heating,
cooling, and electric energy consumption in two large institutional
buildings in central Texan (an engineering center and a business
school building). This paper describes the methodology used by
one of the winning GEPS entries. Energy consumption in a large
commercial building is a complex function of climatic conditions,
building characteristics, building use, system characteristics,
and type of heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning (HVAC)
equipment used. Therefore, multiple linear regression (MLR) models
and non linear modeling approaches, such as artificial neural
net work (ANN) models, tend to provide better modeling capabilities
than simple linear regression modeling approaches. The heating
and cooling energy consumption in both buildings is modeled using
the MLR approach. The electric energy consumption at both sites
is weather-independent and is a function of only the buildings
operating schedule; therefore, it is modeled using a daytyping
algorithm. At the engineering center, the coefficient of variation
(CV) for electric energy end-uses varied from 1% to 6% while the
CV for cooling energy consumption and heating energy consumption
varied from 10% to 33%. At the business school building, the CV
for electric energy end-use varied from 5% to 14% while the CV
for Ec and Eh consumption varied from 27% to 36%.

ABSTRACT A second predictor shootout contest has been developed
and conducted to evaluate the most effective empirical or inverse
models for modeling hourly whole-building energy baselines for
purposes of measuring savings from energy conservation retrofits.
This second contest utilized two sets of measured hourly pre-retrofit
and post-retrofit data from buildings participating in a revolving
loan program in Texas (Claridge et al 1996), The accuracy of the
contestants models was evaluated by determining their ability
to predict data that were carefully removed from the training
(or pre-retrofit) period. A comparison of the savings predicted
by the models is also presented. The results from the contest
show that neural networks again provide the most accurate model
of a buildings energy use. However, in contrast to the first contest
(Kreider and Haberl 1994a), the second contest results show that
cleverly assembled statistical models also appear to be a accurate
or, in some cases, more accurate than some of the neural network
entries. When these models were used to forecast the baseline
use into the post-retrofit period, large variations in the predicted
savings occurred among the models, particularly for the cooling
energy savings in one of the case study buildings. These variations
appear to be due to the ability of the models (or inability) to
capture certain energy performance characteristics and the modelers
assumptions about the post-retrofit energy use.

ABSTRACT The principle of good design for natural ventilation
is to &quot;build tight - ventilate right&quot;. A building cannot
be `too tight', but it may be under-ventilated. There is considerable
scope for making UK buildings tighter. However, simpler techniques
need to be developed (especially in large non domestic buildings)
to identify envelope tightness and associated leakage paths. Also
guidance needs to be provided on constructing tighter envelopes.
Studies necessary to assess the implication of tighter buildings
are described. Sufficient information is available on ventilation
requirements necessary to satisfy safety and health criteria.
However, criteria relating to comfort, especially those associated
with odour, metabolic CO and summer overheating need to be investigated.
The paper also discusses minimising the effects of tobacco smoke
and controlling other internally generated pollutants. Guidelines
for natural ventilation design may conflict with other design
or climate-responsive strategies, future work should address this,
and address issues such as ventilation openings (to provide both
&quot;background&quot; and &quot;rapid&quot; ventilation) and
design for deeper, naturally ventilated buildings.

ABSTRACT In many cases natural ventilation may be sufficient to
ensure acceptable comfort levels in occupied buildings. In these
cases, installation of energy-intensive active environmental control
systems will not be necessary. This will result in considerable
energy and cost savings and also indirectly in a reduced burden
on the environment, since the use of energy is always associated
with the production of waste materials. This paper describes the
development of a new model to predict natural ventilation flow
rates in buildings. The model is based on the concept of a flow
network where openings are represented by non-linear flow resistances.
It takes into account the effect of both wind-induced pressures
and pressures due to thermal forces. The model draws on a healthy
balance between purely theoretical equations and empirical data.
The new flow model was linked to an existing thermal model to
produce a new integrated design tool for naturally ventilated
buildings. It takes into account the important interaction between
the flow model and the thermal model and can therefore be used
to predict the natural ventilation flow rates as well as the resulting
indoor air temperatures. The applicability of the new tool is
illustrated through a case study. From this it is clear that the
tool can be used successfully to optimize passive building design.
The optimized design illustrated here not only results in minimum
initial cost, but also in improved passive thermal comfort in
summertime and a reduction in winter heating energy consumption.
