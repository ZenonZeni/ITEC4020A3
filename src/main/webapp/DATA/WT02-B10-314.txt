After being hospitalized for the second time in five years for hypertension,
Sammy Blackmon Jr. underwent tests that showed him to be "borderline
diabetic with high cholesterol", an enlarged heart and blood pressure
so high it could cause a stroke.  The doctors were considering surgery.
After carefully following his doctor's recommeendations and supplementing
his diet with Diamite vitality products, his check up revealed that his
blood pressure has greatly improved, his heart has normalized, his
cholesterol count is down, and he has continued to use the products to
help his body heal itself.

Fifteen years ago, I went into the hospital for a minor operation. And 
although I came out of it fine, from that moment on I had a weight problem.
Eventually, I got up to 300 pounds and a size 48 suit. Along with the
excess weight came fatigue, high cholesterol, headaches and continuous body 
aches and pains. I felt left out, forgotten and depressed because of my
weight.
Then I began using the Night Trim and soon added the Fiber Tablets.
I quickly lost 20 pounds and went on to steadily lose an additional
25 pounds. Soon I was wearing a size 44. My clothes are hanging on me now
and I need smaller ones still. I haven't had to change the foods I eat, but
thanks to the Fiber Tablets, I'm able to control my appetite so I'm eating
less. I feel fantastic physically and have much more self-esteem. I've
still got some weight to lose and I know I can do it. I'm getting a lot
of compliments from the ladies so I'm not about to stop until I reach my
weight loss goal.

After several years of being overweight, I started controlling my eating
habits and began using the Night Trimming System because I was so
uncomfortable with my appearance. At 155 pounds, I was always the
overweight person in the group. I decided it was time for a change. I
wanted to be happy and proud of my figure. So I began eating two sensible
meals a day drinking plenty of water and using the Night Trimming. In just
6 weeks, I was able to lose 30 pounds. I'm down to 125 pounds and am still
losing.

I've had problems with asthma for as long as I can remember. As a
hairdresser, it is aggravated especially when I work with chemicals. I have
started the Herbal Respiratory System. In just a few days, I could feel
a definite improvement. I am not wheezing as much.

I have been using the Diamite Products for approximately three years.
Since that time, I have never felt more healthy and full of life! Since
the introduction of the Herbal Alternatives, I feel even better! The
Feminine Herbal Complex have helped balance my monthly cycle. Coupled
with the Optimal Life Formula, it gives me the energy boost I need!
