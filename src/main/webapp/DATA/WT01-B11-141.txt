<H2>Discourage Raccoons From Moving In
</H2>
</CENTER>
Wild animals belong in the wild.  For their protection and your own, they should not be allowed to take up residence inside or near your home.  <P>  

Although some mammals are more susceptible to some strains of rabies, any animal can be infected by any strain of rabies.  A strain not found Ontario and which is spread by raccoons, is approaching the province.  Those areas where Ontario is linked to New York State, such as the Niagara Region or at international bridges along the St. Lawrence are the most vulnerable.<P>

<B>Keep raccoons away</B><P>
<UL>
<LI>Do not provide food or shelter for raccoons or other wild animals.  It is against the law to keep wildlife, including raccoons, as pets.<P>

<LI>If your pet's food is usually left outside, bring it in at the end of the day.
</UL>
<B>Raccoon-proof your home</B><P>

You may want to contact a professional for advice, or raccoon-proof your home yourself:
<UL>
<LI><B>Cover up potential entrances</B>, such as uncapped chimneys, loose shingles and openings in attics, roofs and eaves.  If you're not sure where raccoons are getting in, sprinkle flour around potential entrances and check for footprints later.  You can also stuff a rag or ball of paper in a suspect hole and check later to see if it has been removed.<P>

<LI><B>Make a raccoon den unlivable.</B>  Sprinkle naphtha flakes around the area or hang ammonia-soaked cotton rags near the entrance and keep the area brightly lit.  Raccoons dislike loud noises, bright lights and strong smells.  Use the same methods in your garden or in the area where you keep your garbage or composter.<P>


<LI><B>Always cover composters and garbage cans.</B>  Use a bungie cord or a heavy weight to keep the lid in place.<P>

<LI><B>Make sure that all raccoons or other animals have left before sealing up holes in any part of a building. </B> This is especially important between May and July when there may be young.<P>

<LI><B>Block the entrances to a raccoon den</B> once you're sure all the animals have left.  You can use sheet metal.  Repair siding and holes in buildings, and use heavy rustproof screening to cover open air vents or chimneys.<P>

<LI><B>Trim all overhanging tree branches</B> or any other structure that animals might use to get on to the roof of a residence or detached building.
