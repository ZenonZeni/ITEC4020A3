<b>Sorption-Enhanced Reaction (SER) Process for Production of 
Hydrogen;<br>

Madhu Anand, Principal Investigator,<br> <a 
href="http://www.airproducts.com/">Air Products and 

Chemicals, Inc.</a></b>

<P>

Sorption-enhanced reaction (SER) is a new process being developed for 

the production of low-cost hydrogen through steam-methane reforming.  In 
this process, 

the reaction of methane with steam is carried out in the presence of a 
mixture of a catalyst 

and a selective adsorbent for CO<sub>2</sub>.  As a result, the 
reformation reaction occurs at a 

significantly lower temperature (300-500&#176;C) than that of 
conventional steam-

methane reforming processes (800-1100&#176;C) while achieving the same 

conversion of methane to hydrogen.  In addition, the product hydrogen is 
more 

than 99% pure directly from the SER reactor and only 70-75% pure from 
the 

conventional reactor; the new process thus eliminates or substantially 
reduces 

the traditional downstream hydrogen-purification step.  The SER process 
is 

expected to make small, low-cost plants more economical, facilitating 
the growth 

of hydrogen delivery and service infrastructures.

<P>

Our efforts have focused chiefly on developing a sorbent that will 

adsorb/chemisorb CO<sub>2</sub> in the presence of H<sub>2</sub>O, 
methane, CO, and H<sub>2</sub> at 300-500&#176;C 

and a total pressure of 5-20 atmospheres.  Early work also includes 
demonstrating 

the SER concept in a state-of-the-art, bench-scale test.  Later work 
will include building a 

pilot plant to scale up the technology and develop engineering data.  If 
successful, this 

technology will be commercialized by Air Products and Chemicals, Inc., 
and used in its 

current hydrogen business.

<b><I>Recent Advances:</I></b><p>

Material E4 was reported last month to meet the target CO<sub>2</sub>

sorption capacity at 400&#176;C.  Tests have been completed on

(I) dry sorption-desorption cycling of the sorbent and (ii) exposure

of E4 to process levels of steam and CO<sub>2</sub>
at 400&#176;C for one month on the Hydrothermal Stability Testing

Unit (HSTU).  The data show that after 60 sorption-desorption

cycles and exposure to steam, the CO<sub>2</sub> sorption

capacity is retained at &gt; 0.60 mmol/g at 400&#176;C, a very

significant result.  Analysis of the sorbent after exposure to

30 days of steam at 10 atm pressure showed the formation of a

3-phase crystalline product mixture.  Laboratory preparation and

analysis of one of the products resulting from this 30-day steaming

test, E8, indicates that it contributes only a minor component

to the overall observed capacity of this material.  B2 was shown

to have a CO<sub>2</sub> desorption capacity intermediate

between those of C31 and E4 under process levels of steam and

CO<sub>2</sub> as measured on the Binary Desorption

Unit (BDU).  A laboratory hydraulic extruder was set up for the

extrusion and pelletization of sorbents for the H<sub>2</sub> SER 
program.

 The testing of sorbents in the BDU or the HSTU will require the

use of formed materials.  Pelleted sorbents will be used in the

reaction process.  An invention disclosure was filed covering

the preferred adsorbents for the H<sub>2</sub> SER process.

Sorption and desorption characteristics of  CO<sub>2</sub>

at 400&#176;C on pelleted E4 sorbent were carried out in the lab

process equipment.  CO<sub>2</sub> sorption was carried

out at different flow rates, and the length of the mass transfer

zone (where the CO<sub>2</sub> composition in the

effluent changes from zero to the feed condition) measured.  The

data showed that at an industrial G-rate of 10 
lb-mole/hr/ft<sup>2</sup>,

the length of the mass transfer zone was only 11&quot;, indicating

that the sorption kinetics are fast and acceptable for the SER

process.  Desorption experiments were also carried out with hot

nitrogen at 400&#176;C to regenerate the sorbent.  Different 
N<sub>2</sub>

flow rates were used in the regeneration experiments.  A plot

of (total CO<sub>2</sub> in the effluent) vs. (the

total effluent out) showed that the desorption is independent

of the flow rate.  The desorption profile, calculated from local

equilibrium theory, matched experimental profiles at different

flow rates.  These data show that the kinetics of desorption is

local-equilibrium-controlled and fast.

A novel condensing vapor shell-and-tube reactor was designed for

SER-SMR.  The heat required for the reaction is provided by the

condensation of a heat transfer fluid vapor.  The reactor operation

is nearly isothermal; heat is provided where it is needed (in

the moving reaction-mass transfer zone) in the reaction tubes.

 Also, a process flow diagram was prepared for the SER-SMR process

using the condensing vapor reactor.  Heat and mass balances were

carried out.  An economic analysis was done by the APCI H<sub>2</sub>

business area for this process, which showed that the SER-SMR

process can lower the H<sub>2</sub> production cost

by 20% compared with conventional SMR.  Two patent disclosures

on the SER-SMR process were filed.
