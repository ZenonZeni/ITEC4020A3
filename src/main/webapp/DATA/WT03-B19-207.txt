<H2>Australia</H2>
The national consumer market for clothing, fabrics and footwear is $15 billion.  Domestic production employs around 70,000 people and contributes 0.5 % of GDP.
<P>

The Australian textiles, clothing and footwear (TCF) industry is becoming more export-oriented.  Wool processing and textiles have benefited from increased foreign investment and the associated increase in value-added exports.  Total TCF exports from Australia are around $1.4 billion.
<P>
Global trade in textiles and clothing has been growing rapidly and this is forecast to continue with the phased abolition of the Multifibre Agreement and increased demand in Asia for final and intermediate textile, clothing and footwear goods.
<P>
The clothing and footwear sector continues to rationalise in response to reduced tariffs and increased overseas competition.
<P>
<H2>Victoria</H2>
Victoria dominates national production of textile, clothing, footwear and leather products.  The 1,500 TCF establishments in Victoria produce half of the national output, and generate about 1 % of Victoria's GSP.  Employment is around 35,000.
<P>
The clothing and footwear sector has adjusted since the late 1980s to lower protection and has lifted its productivity.
<P>
The industry situation has stabilised during the current economic upturn due to a lift in the domestic market and growth in exports.  Exports have increased strongly in the 1990s, to be worth around $600 million. The main exports are leather, fabrics and clothing.
<P>
Recent investments have reinforced Geelong as a major wool processing centre supplemented by other investments by Godfrey Hirst (carpet manufacturer) and Geelong Wool Combing.  Other investments include a $90m polyester and fibre filament plant by Leading Synthetics.
<P>
<H2>Prospects</H2>
The Department of Employment, Education and Training projects growth in the sales of Australian TCF manufactures over the period to 2005/6 to average 1 %.
<P>
Exports are expected to grow strongly with most of the increase in the textiles industry as a result of continuing foreign direct investment into the Australian wool-processing industry.
