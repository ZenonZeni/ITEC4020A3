<p><br>
<p><br><p>
<H2>Purpose</H2>
<P>
To improve the effectiveness of the Victorian Industrial Supplies
Office through reforms recommended by an independent review.
<H2>Background</H2>

<P>
The Victorian Industrial Supplies Office has a significant influence
in replacing imported inputs with those produced locally.
<P>
A review of the Victorian Industrial Supplies Office was conducted
in 1994. The Industrial Supplies Office was found to be efficient,
effective and providing demonstrable and comparative value for
funds invested; with a higher benefit-cost ratio than similar
organisations. However, areas of opportunity and improved performance
were identified.
<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
The Victorian Industrial Supplies Office will increase its effectiveness
through:
<UL>
<LI>A more strategic focus, and concentration on strategic industry
sectors identified by Government
<LI>The Board's developing a stronger industry focus
<LI>Setting performance targets.
</UL>
<P>
<H2>Users</H2>
<P>
Firms purchasing imports and exporting into major offshore projects.
<H2>Funding</H2>
<P>
Funding of $700,000 per annum will be provided for the next 3
financial years.
<P>
The Government will also match on a dollar for dollar basis revenue
raised by  the Victorian Industrial Supplies Office subject to
agreed annual limits.
<H2>Outcomes</H2>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Better coordination of export and import replacement efforts in
Victoria, and concentration on key strategic sectors.
<LI>The Victorian Industrial Supplies Office should achieve 20 per
cent self-funding  within two to three years.
