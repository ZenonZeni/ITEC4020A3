Recently read books include:
<ul>
<li>Primary Colors, Anonymous. recommended.
<li>Beach Music, Pat Conroy. recommended.
<li>Magic Kingdom for sale/sold. Terry Brooks. not great.
<li>The Black Unicorn. Terry Brooks. Skip it.
<li>The Calvin and Hobbes Tenth Anniversary Book, Watterson. This is much more
than a simple collection of great comic strips, even though any collection
of Calvin and Hobbes' strips is wonderful. This book contains wonderful
introductory material from Watterson, including why there are no
stuffed "hobbes" tigers at Toys-r-us. Probably the neatest part is the
running commentary, where Watterson gives us a peek into his thinking
while he worked on particular strips. Highly recommended. Too bad there 
won't be an eleventh anniversary edition.
<li>All the Troubles in the World, PJ O'Rourke. (Not nearly his best work.)
<li>Learning Perl and Programming Perl. These hardly count as books that
are read.
<li>I Sing the Body Electronic, Fred Moody. An interesting book about
how Microsoft writes software. If this is accurate, why are they rich?
<li>Software Metrics, A rigorous approach, Norman Fenton
<li>Rivethead, Ben Hamper
<li>Showstopper. On how Windows NT came to be. Same comment as for "I sing..."
above.
<li>The  Mythical Man-month, Fredrick Brooks. (I read it 20 years ago,
and just found a fresh copy. It is still an interesting book. A special
20th anniversary edition is now available. Strongly recommended.)
<li>Microserfs, Douglas Copland
<li>The Proud Tower, Barbara Tuchman. The description of anarchists
and crypto-anarchists is interesting in contrast to today's cypherpunks.
As TCMay says, today's cryptoanarchists are "not your grandfathers's 
anarchists."
<li>Contact, Carl Sagan
<li>Night Over Water, Ken Follett
<li>Apocalypse Watch, Robert Ludlum
<li>Pronto, Elmore Leonard
