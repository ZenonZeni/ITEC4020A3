<b>Auditory Training for Spatial Orientation in Children with Visual Impairment</b> <br>
GRANT NUMBER: H023C40107 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  9/01/94 <br>
ENDING DATE:  8/31/97 <P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  The project will study how children with visual impairments can use naturally
occurring auditory information to maintain their spatial orientation while moving about.<P>

METHOD:  For the first project area, staff will conduct a functional assessment of sound
localization.  A practical, standardized test for the precision of sound localization will be
developed for use by mobility instructors.  This test will be assessed for its ability to predict
problems with travel skills.  For the second component, staff will study the guidance of
locomotion via sound fields.  A training procedure will be developed to enhance sensitivity to
reflected sound and "sound shadows" in a safe environment allowing repeated practice.  The
procedure will be standardized and made available to mobility instructors using inexpensive
materials.  For the third component, staff will focus on spatial orientation from dynamic
listening. <P>
A procedure will be developed for training children about room layout by listening to moving
sound sources.  The procedure draws on recent advances in audio recording for
three-dimensional
playback.  The sample will be children with visual impairments (N=200) and children without
visual impairments (N=16) aged 6 to 12 years.  For the assessment, the 16 children without
visual
impairments will participate.  The classroom-based procedure will use portable equipment
designed to be easily moved, and will produce computer-generated speech noise.  The testing
procedure will require children to judge the position of a sound relative to a reference position
that is straight ahead at ear level.  Staff will later use results of these studies to explore a
procedure for making an audio tape recording that will portray the spatial layout of the training
room when played back over earphones.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  This project will produce two standardized assessment and
intervention procedures to contribute to the orientation and mobility training of children with
visual impairments.  Results will be published in professional journals, workshops, and
manuals.<P>

<b>The Development and Evaluation of an Early Intervention Program for Nonreaders and
Nonwriters</b><br>


GRANT NUMBER: H023C50089 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  8/16/95 <br>
ENDING DATE:  8/15/99 <P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  This project will collaborate with teachers on the development, implementation, and
evaluation of an integrated curricular approach designed to teach the self-regulated use of
comprehension and composition skills and strategies to primary grade students with mild
disabilities.  The project will focus specifically on those who are nonconventional readers and
writers in grades 1-4. <P>

METHOD:  In the first study, comparative and normative data will be collected on
primary-grade
students with mild disabilities in order to provide baseline information for measuring effects of
the
experimental curriculum.  Over the course of three years, 13 teachers and their 130 students with
mild disabilities will participate.  Analyses will focus on the short-term and multi-year effects of
the curricular approach on teacher's instructional practices, and their special education students'
reading and writing achievement, and metacognitive and strategy knowledge.  Staff will also
study
whether gaps between students in the experimental group and their nondisabled peers diminish
over time.  In the second study, the experimental curricular approach will be embedded in
language arts and content area subjects to evaluate the effectiveness of the curriculum when it is
presented as part of the regular education curriculum.  Four regular education teachers in the
primary grades, their 16 mainstreamed students with mild disabilities, and all associated regular
education students will participate in this study.  The performance of mainstreamed students will
be contrasted with that of students who continue to receive the curricular approach in special
education settings.  Pretest and posttest data will be analyzed to determine the effects of the
experimental curriculum on the achievement of students with learning disabilities, metacognitive
and strategy knowledge, and self-perceived competence.  Specific consideration will be given to
data providing information on the extent to which cognitive strategies in the experimental
curriculum can be incorporated as part of the "regular" curriculum, and the relative effectiveness
of the curriculum employed in regular education versus special education settings.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  At the conclusion of this research project, a disseminable
curricular approach will be available to advance teachers' knowledge and practice related to the
improvement of literacy instruction and the learning of young students with mild disabilities. 
Annual reports will be prepared and disseminated to academicians and teaching professionals. 
An
ongoing series of executive summaries will be distributed to administrators and other key
personnel of schools in the local service area. Project staff will be present findings through
conference presentations and journal articles.  They will also be available for consultation with
local school districts.<P>

<b>PROMISE: Practitioners and Researchers Orchestrating Model Innovations to Strengthen
Education</b> <br>

GRANT NUMBER: H023G50005 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  9/01/95 <br>
ENDING DATE:  8/31/99 <P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  This project will develop, validate, and disseminate a model for
practitioner-researcher collaboration and staff development, resulting in cutting-edge, successful
practices that are implemented and sustained in schools. <P>

METHOD:  Research will conduct two "generations" of research activity aimed at developing
instructional procedures that help teachers accommodate students with disabilities during
mainstream reading activity.  In Years 1 and 2, staff will implement the PROMISE collaborative
research model with one school and a traditional "expert" model with a second school.  Both
qualitative and quantitative methods will be used to examine the effects of these two contrasting
research models on teacher beliefs and values, school culture, teacher practice, fidelity of
treatment implementation, and student outcomes.  In Years 3 and 4, staff will study the effects of
the research model in participating schools in terms of whether (and if so, how long) these
innovations are sustained.  In addition, staff will replicate the process initiated in Years 1 and 2
and contrast collaborative versus expert models in two additional schools.  Again, the project
will
generate information about the efficacy of further refined reading instruction.  In replication of
Year 1 and 2 research, teachers in the first generation of schools will be responsible for staff
development in the second generation of schools.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  PROMISE is expected to have national impact through the
development of otherwise unavailable products and knowledge including: (1) the creation of a
model for school-university research collaboration that bridges between practice       and
research;
(2) a manual and videotape designed to disseminate this model; (3) validated methods for
including students with disabilities in general education for reading instruction; (4) a training
manual and videotape explicating and illustrating the reading methods; (5) research reports on
the
relative effects of collaborative versus expert research models, on reading treatment components,
and on specifying a model for school-university research partnerships.<P>

<b>Project BRIDGE: Bridging Research and Instruction through Dynamic and Ground
Exchange</b> <br>

GRANT NUMBER: H023G50021 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  9/01/95 <br>
ENDING DATE:  8/31/99<P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  The project will develop, field-test, and evaluate a model of elementary literacy
education that is: (1) considerate of and sensitive to the regularities, routines, and resources of
individual schools; (2) grounded in the dynamic and equitable exchange between professionals
practitioners and researchers; (3) sufficiently defined to generalize to other schools and produce
replicable findings; and (4) sustainable by faculty most proximal and responsible for bringing
about change.<P>

METHOD:  Research will be conducted over a four-year period.  Forty general education
teachers, 8-10 special education teachers, and four school principals will participate along with
four university faculty.  All students with identified reading disabilities, two children identified
as
at risk for reading failure, and two average-achieving peers will participate from each classroom
for a projected total of 280-300 children over the four year funding period.  Each school will
establish two teams per school that will be responsible for developing specific mechanisms and
strategies of the BRIDGE model for their respective sites.  One of these teams will represent K-2
classes, the other grades 3-5.  A modified multiple-case replication design will be used to
evaluate
the effects and sustainability of the model.  School culture, climate, and student literacy
achievement, engagement,
and attitudes will be assessed through a framework of measures to be determined at the local
school level.  In addition to technical adequacy criteria, these measures will be proximal to
school
culture and climate and will provide a cadre of common assessment instruments across
schools.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  Research reports from the first two project years will examine
the
reading literacy growth of students with disabilities within the context of several bridging
mechanisms and options at the school-building level.  Curricular materials and reports from
Years
3 and 4 will provide the theoretical base and practical implications for designing and
implementing
a model for bridging research and practice that benefits students with disabilities and those at risk
for reading and academic failure.<P>

<b>PROJECT RILT</b> <br>

GRANT NUMBER: H023G50033 <br>
BEGINNING DATE: 10/01/95 <br>
ENDING DATE:  9/30/99 <P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  This project will develop, implement, and evaluate the Research Instructional Lead
Teacher (RILT) system, a model for bridging the gap between research and practice in the
education of children with disabilities in general education classrooms.<P>

METHOD:  The RILT model will address implementing effective, research-based instructional
strategies for teaching students with learning disabilities, mild behavior disorders, and students
with mild, moderate, severe, and profound disabilities in regular education elementary
classrooms. 
Using an AB design, three time series experiments will be conducted to assess: (1) procedural
reliability of implementation of the RILT model, (2) procedural reliability of teacher
implementation of selected strategies, (3) learning of students with disabilities during
implementation of the RILT process, (4) learning of students without disabilities who receive
remedial educational programs, and (5) teacher instructional and student responding
(ecobehavioral) variables during implementation.  Three ethnographic case studies will be
conducted from the emic perspective to identify influential belief systems impacting selection
and
use of instructional strategies.  Five studies using single subject experimental designs will be
conducted to study the effectiveness of RILT.  Results
of a school climate survey will be examined to determine differences (if any) on variables
measured in schools after participation in RILT. The RILT model will then be replicated in
another school using local resources and action research data collection procedures.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  The project will develop: (1) an RILT model implementation
module describing module components, roles of key research teachers, procedures for
implementation and training, and results of implementation in various settings; (2)
"teacher-friendly" intervention modules describing research-based interventions, step-by-step
procedures for implementing interventions in general education classrooms, adaptations made in
different classrooms, and manageable data collection procedures. The project will also develop
disseminable materials for professional journals and conferences.  These reports and modules
will
be made available to a variety of professional institutes, clearinghouses, and technical assistance
organizations.<P>

<b>Visual Involvement in Literacy: Reading and Discussing Books with 3- to 8-Year Old
Students 
Who are Deaf and Hard-of Hearing</b> <br>

GRANT NUMBER: H023N40040 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  8/01/94 <br>
ENDING DATE:  7/31/97 <P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  The purpose of this project is to perform a sociolinguistic study of successful
involvement strategies in a visual modality that are used by teachers of varying backgrounds and
styles.  The subject of the study will be equally divided between both hearing and deaf users of
Manually Coded English (MCE) and American Sign Language (ASL).<P>

METHOD:  The project initially involves transcription and analysis of 10 videotaped reading
activities by teachers and 10 videotaped discussion activities by teachers and students.  First, five
teachers (three hearing and two deaf) will be asked to read with their class one of two picture
books, "Too Much Noise," which uses many words connected with sounds.  Second, they shall
be
asked to involve their students in discussing the first book after hearing the story.  The same five
teachers will then read a second book, "Five Chinese Brothers," which uses many words
connected with vision, again followed by a
discussion of the story with the class.  The total number of students will be 52, and students shall
be videotaped as well.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  This project will provide an empirical basis for the transcription
and analysis of successful involvement strategies; the transcription and analysis of teachers' and
students' interaction in discussion; and an understanding of how the involvement strategies are
impacted by the teacher's target language and audiological background.  The result will be a
research-based model for developing inservice training for teachers, parents, and others who
wish
to read and discuss with students, to develop or enhance techniques for creating interpersonal
involvement as well as more involvement in discussion in a visual modality.<P>

<b>Is Learning Disabilities Nothing More than an Oversophistication of Low Achievement? A
Quantitative and A Qualitative Synthesis</b> <br>

GRANT NUMBER: H023E50004 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  9/01/95 <br>
ENDING DATE:  8/31/97<P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  The project will develop a definitive statement of whether, and to what extent,
students with learning disabilities differ from peers who are low-achieving and who do not have
learning disabilities.<P>

METHOD:  A meta-analysis will be conducted, addressing the following questions: (1) In terms
of standard deviations, how does performance by low-achievers compare to that of students with
learning disabilities?  (2) What magnitude of difference separates the two groups in terms of
social
acceptance and classroom behavior? and (3) Are student grade levels, race, and socioeconomic
factors relevant to intergroup differences?  A comprehensive review of published and
unpublished
literature will be conducted.  These studies will then be coded along various methodological and
demographic dimensions and critiqued for technical quality.  The staff will then calculate
individual
effect sizes for comparisons between the two groups of students (learning disabled/low
achieving)
and analyze individual effect sizes along dimensions such as academic performance,
achievement/
performance discrepancies, social acceptance, and school behavior.  In addition to the
meta-analysis, staff will analyze a subset of studies meeting the highest standards of scientific
rigor
as part of a qualitative, best-evidence synthesis approach.  Finally, findings will be submitted to a
panel of experts for formative feedback, followed by further analyses based on their
feedback.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  Project findings will be made available as quickly as possible
through submission of prepublication reports to the Educational Resource Information Center
(ERIC).  Results will also be published in relevant journals, including a possible special issue on
the subject to include both the meta-analysis and the best evidence synthesis.  The final report
will
be published as a monograph, and presentations will be made to scholarly audiences at national
gatherings.<P>

<b>Accommodating Student Diversity in General Education Classrooms: A Downward
Extension of
Class-wide Peer Tutoring</b> <br>

GRANT NUMBER: H023N30003 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  9/01/93 <br>
ENDING DATE:  8/31/96<P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  This project will reorganize 1st- through 3rd-grade reading instruction to enhance
regular educators' abilities to accommodate a wider range of academic diversity in the
mainstream.<P>

METHOD:  In Year 1, staff will develop and pilot Class-wide Peer Tutoring (CWPT) strategies
for beginning readers in six 1st grade classrooms in two schools.  Procedures will make use of
strategies and principles of effective reading instruction.  The impact of these procedures will be
carefully monitored by means of curriculum-based measurement.  In Year 2, staff will examine
experimentally the effectiveness and feasibility of the downward extension of the strategies with
different types of students in mainstream 1st-grade classrooms.  Participants will include 20
1st-grade teachers and 120 children, half of whom will be either at risk for or already involved in
special education services.  In Year 3, the downward extension of the program will be used to
permit teachers to tailor CWPT experiences to student's individual needs.  Decisions about
CWPT
placement will be aided by computer-managed curriculum-based assessment, which will be
implemented class-wide.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  Concrete products of the program will include a new, validated
tutoring system in reading suited to needs of various levels of readers and a manual for training
teachers and support staff to use the methods developed through the program. <P>

<b>Investigation of Sequence of Reciprocal Interactions within Behavioral Episodes of Problem
Behavior</b> <br>

GRANT NUMBER: H023N50004 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  9/01/95 <br>
ENDING DATE:  8/31/98<P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  The project will develop and validate a conceptual model of the sequence of
reciprocal interactions within behavioral episodes (explosive escalating sequence of behaviors)
of
problem behavior.<P>

METHOD:  Project staff anticipate gathering data on 500 to 600 behavioral episodes of problem
behavior exhibited by a stratified sample of 100 to 110 elementary-aged students diagnosed as
seriously behaviorally disabled, learning disabled, and/or developmentally disabled.  Prior to
direct
observations of behavioral episodes, a scatterplot analysis will be completed by educators on
each
student to identify those times in which there is a high probability that behavioral episodes will
occur.  Data will be summarized descriptively for the entire sample through simple univariate
statistics.  Logistic regression techniques will be conducted to explicate the sequence of
reciprocal
interactions within behavioral episodes of problem behavior.  These techniques will also be used
to explore the conditional probabilities among the behaviors associated with each interaction.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  The project expects to develop products such as: presentations at
national, state and regional conferences; professional articles, book chapters, and manuscripts;
and
dissemination through electronic networks to reach parent and practitioner networks.<P>

<b>Deaf Students as Readers and Writers: A Mixed-Mode Research Approach</b> <br>

GRANT NUMBER: H023T30006 <br>
BEGINNING DATE: 10/01/93 <br>
ENDING DATE:  9/30/96<P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  This project will examine the acquisition of reading and writing skills in deaf and
hard-of-hearing children based on a quantitative study of child characteristics and a qualitative
study of the classrooms they attend.<P>

METHOD:  The quantitative study of student outcomes will include measures of student
language, reading and writing skills, in two age-matched groups of deaf and hard-of-hearing
students in two schooling settings.  This study will also include institutional variables of the
settings where they receive their schooling, and analyses of associations between the students'
performances and these institutional variables.  The qualitative study of instructional practices
will
examine two distinct settings which exemplify different modes of communication during reading
and writing instruction.  This study will be coupled with analysis of deaf and hard-of-hearing
students' responses to instructional language as documented in their interaction and engagement
with instruction, in their reading and writing practices, and in their written products.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  Key research personnel will include activities to disseminate
project findings through their writing and publishing.<P>

<b>Synthesis of Intervention Research </b> <br>

GRANT NUMBER: H023E40014 <br>
BEGINNING DATE: 10/10/94 <br>
ENDING DATE:  9/30/96 <P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  The purpose of this project is twofold: (1) to analyze through a meta-analysis and a
synthesis of single-subject research, as well as a narrative, instructional programs that have
produced data on populations with learning disabilities; and (2) to integrate research findings
across a diverse study of instructional interventions for students with learning disabilities.<P>

METHOD:  For the first phase of the project during Year 1, a search of the relevant literature
will
include at least four on-line databases including: (1) the Educational Research Information
Center
(ERIC); (2) Psych Lit, a review of psychological journals; (3) Med-line, a review of all medical
literature; and (4) Comprehensive Dissertation Abstracts.  Search descriptors will include
learning
disabilities, reading disabilities, and dyslexia.  In the second phase of Year 1 all group design
intervention studies will be analyzed via a meta-analytical procedure.  Analysis will primarily
consist of individual study units and careful selection of studies for inclusion on methodological
and conceptual criteria.  Analysis will include: (1) the collection of published studies; (2) coding
of study characteristics; (3) calculation of effect size as common measures of study outcomes;
and
(4) search for relations between study characteristics and study outcomes.  Studies used in the
intervention synthesis will include students with learning disabilities in the sample who receive
intervention over a minimum period of time; will be retrievable from university libraries, ERIC,
or
from University Microfilms International; will measure treatment outcomes quantitatively; and
will show no severe methodological flaws.  For the group design studies, meta-analysis will be
conducted through five methods: (1) outcomes will be transformed to a common metric; (2) the
study will be used as a unit of analysis and dependent measures will be analyzed separately; (3) a
meta-analysis will be performed using a probability method; (4) all studies will be pulled
together
to test for homogeneity; and (5) studies will be pulled to look for sampling errors. The final
phase
of Year 2 will focus on hypothesis testing, data analysis, writing and presenting the outcomes of
the quantitative analysis.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  This project will provide a comprehensive analysis of all
published intervention research with students with learning disabilities and will clarify and
integrate relevant research findings across diverse study characteristics.  The analysis developed
from this project will be incorporated in textbook chapters, disseminated in articles, and
presented
to state departments and professional conferences.<P>

<b>The Development and Use of Cheremic, Graphemic, and Phonological Coding in Deaf High
School-Aged Readers</b> <br>

GRANT NUMBER: H023B50050 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  9/01/95 <br>
ENDING DATE:  8/31/96 <P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  The project will determine the short-term memory (STM) strategies used by deaf
individuals in contrived and real-world reading situations, and to explore the correlation of these
strategies with (1) individual factors such as reading level, level of hearing loss, and age of onset,
and (2) with educational and family characteristics, including communication mode and
language,
parent adaptation, involvement, permissiveness and expectations, and early reading, sign, and
speech experiences.<P>

METHOD:  Subjects will include 20 high school students who are severely or profoundly
prelingually deaf high school students, half of whom will be poor readers.  Half of each reading
group's subjects will have hearing parents, the other half having deaf parents.  Deaf subjects will
be compared to 20 hearing students who have scored below-average on STM and reading
comprehension tasks.  Subjects will complete two measures of STM, designed to elicit confusion
among like stimuli and to thus reveal preferred coding strategies.  Semi-structured interviews
with
deaf subjects and their deaf or hard of hearing parents will be videotaped.  Student interviews
will
include role-play, reporting of everyday strategies, review of test results and examiner
observations, and discussion of word-play materials.  Parent interviews will focus on parent
attitudes, expectations, and the child's early communication and education experiences.  Analysis
will determine if there are significant differences between coding strategies used by the different
groups of subjects on readers on STM tests.  Correlations will also be explored between deaf
readers' primary coding strategies and their scores on three informal speech-related measures, age
of onset, and levels of hearing loss.  Finally, staff will correlate coding strategy and reading
group
to the interview data from subject and parent interviews.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  The information to be gained from this research will have
significant impact on both programming decisions and philosophies as well as on strategies for
teaching reading.  Project staff will disseminate findings in writing and through presentations at
conferences and workshops.  Journal articles are planned for submission to several journals
related to reading and special education.<P>

<b>Synthesizing and Communicating a Professional Knowledge Base on Positive Behavioral
Support</b> <br>

GRANT NUMBER: H023E50001 <br>
BEGINNING DATE: 10/01/95  <br>
ENDING DATE:  9/30/97<P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  The purpose of this project is to synthesize and broadly disseminate current research
on positive behavioral support for students whose behaviors include self-injury, aggression,
tantrums, property destruction, and self-stimulatory behavior.<P>

METHOD:  Based on a literature review resulting in an anticipated sample of 100-150 papers,
staff will prepare a monograph which will include: (1) a list of articles composing the final
review
sample; (2) dimensions of functional analysis and assessment reported; (3) proactive nature of
intervention; (4) aspects of change in social systems; (5) ecological validity of intervention agent
and setting; (6) types of interventions employed and degree of skill improvement; (7) outcome
effectiveness with respect to initial reduction in problem behavior; and (8) dimensions of social
validity.  This monograph will also address trends across time, factors related to intervention
effectiveness, and gaps in the literature base.  The research synthesis monograph will be
translated
into four monographs summarizing "what works".  The four monographs, as well, will be written
with the following audiences in mind:  (1) federal, state and local policy makers and general and
special education administrators; (2) teachers, families, and related service provides; (3) students
with problem behavior; and (4) friends, peers, and community citizens.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:    Following the development of the  monograph and manuals, a
forum on Positive Behavioral Support will be convened, with members of all stakeholder groups
invited to attend. <P>

<b>Integrative Synthesis of Instructional Grouping Practices for Reading Instruction for
Students
with Disabilities</b> <br>

GRANT NUMBER: H023E50005 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  8/15/95 <br>
ENDING DATE:  8/14/97 <P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  The project will examine the types of within-class grouping patterns that general
and
special education teachers use for reading instruction for students with disabilities and the social
and academic outcomes associated with these grouping practices.<P>

METHOD:  The project will implement a systematic, objective, integrative review incorporating
best practices for integrative reviews and meta-analysis procedures.  Research from a broad
spectrum of grouping practices will be synthesized, and studies of instructional practices
imbedded in specific in-class grouping patterns (such as peer tutoring and cooperative learning)
will also be incorporated into this review.  Research in both general and special education
settings
will be examined, as will both academic and social outcomes of grouping patterns.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  The project will develop disseminable products including: (1)
papers and monographs to inform the research community of the state of current knowledge on
this topic; (2) brochures for parents; and (3) professional development materials for inservice and
preservice special and general education teachers providing instructional guidelines for
procedures
and activities for within-class grouping practices for students with disabilities.<P>

<b>Research on Grouping Practices for Mainstreamed Special Education Students</b> <br>

GRANT NUMBER: H023C30013 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  8/15/93 <br>
ENDING DATE:  8/14/96<P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  This project will conduct an investigation of academic, social, and instructional
outcomes as they relate to literacy instruction for students with learning disabilities
mainstreamed
in regular education classrooms organized either homogeneously or heterogeneously.<P>

METHOD:  The first study year will include a comprehensive survey of teachers', parents, and
students' perceptions of grouping practices.  Subjects will include 300 elementary teachers in
grades 3 through 5, as well as one student with learning disabilities, one low achieving, one
average achieving, and one high achieving student for each teachers' classrooms, as well as one
of
the parents of each of these students.  Years 2 and 3 of the study will consist of longitudinal
studies to follow third-graders from each of the four student groups.  In addition to quantitative
analysis of data, individual students and teachers will be identified for more in depth case studies
using qualitative methodology.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  This study will result in the following benefits: (1) a more
comprehensive understanding of grouping practices as they relate to academic and social
functioning of mainstreamed students; (2) a better understanding of teachers' beliefs and
knowledge relating to the literacy instruction of students with disabilities; (3) a more complete
picture of parent and student attitudes toward grouping practices; and (4) a better understanding
of grouping practices that effectively meet the needs of all students without inhibiting the
progress
of other students.<P>

<b>Interpretation of Narrative Theme and Students with Learning Disabilities</b> <br>

GRANT NUMBER: H023C30126 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  9/01/93 <br>
ENDING DATE: 10/31/96 <P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  This project will investigate the ways in which students with learning disabilities,
compared with peers who are not disabled, comprehend complex text that focuses on a content
domain of fundamental importance, namely, human social interactions. The project will also
determine what types of instruction are effective in promoting comprehension and generalization
of comprehension. <P>

METHOD:  The general methodology to be followed will be modeled on the general strategy of
clinical interviews, using sets of 20 students with learning disabilities and equal numbers of
age-matched and reading-ability-matched students who are not disabled.  Initial questions will be
open-ended and students will be encouraged to talk freely.  Detailed probe questions will be
employed to extract further information.  A coding scheme will be developed for the analysis of
the resulting protocols. Statistical analysis will use primarily analysis of variance and
covariance.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  The project expects to generate the following products: selected
and evaluated reading materials that focus on a small set of issues that are interesting, important,
and useful for students with learning disabilities; guidelines for effective instructional strategies;
an
instructional program developed on the basis of these guidelines; and an evaluation of the
instructional program. <P>
