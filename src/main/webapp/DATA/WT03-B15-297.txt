<H1>UK CONSTRUCTION PROSPECTS</H1></CENTER>
<P>This new report examines the construction industry's prospects in the short
and long term. The detailed forecasts and analysis address the following issues,
of key interest to everyone involved in the construction industry and related
sectors:</P>
<UL>
<LI>The benefits to the construction industry of service-led growth</LI>
<LI>The construction industry after the General Election</LI>
<LI>Strong and weak construction markets in the short and long term</LI>
<LI>The factors driving long-term growth to 2003</LI>
<LI>The impact of a shift towards environmentally sustainable growth</LI></UL>
<P>The approach focuses on the prospects for investment spending by sector (eg
retailing, finance and business services), the key determinant of construction
demand. The prospects for the construction industry are therefore set in the
context of the economy generally, and investment spending in particular.</P>
<P>A special supplement focuses on the impact on the aggregates industries of a
shift towards policies to promote environmental sustainability, and suggests
strategies to respond to this shift. Specific policies examined include the
introduction of the landfill tax and the slowdown in roadbuilding. The author of
the supplement is Paul Ekins, Senior Lecturer in Environmental Policy at Keele
University, director of Forum for the Future and a senior consultant at
Cambridge Econometrics</P>
<P>Detailed forecasts and analysis are provided for the 10 types of work - 6
new work and 4 repair &amp; maintenance - as published by the DoE in its
construction industry statistics. Detailed forecasts are also provided for the
38 categories of investment in buildings and works as published in the UK
National Accounts.</P>
<P>The short-term outlook (1996, 1997 and 1998) is separated from a longer-term
outlook (1998-2003). Charts and tables convey the information in an
easy-to-comprehend format.</P>
