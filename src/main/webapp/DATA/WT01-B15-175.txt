The <A HREF="/waste/tec.htm">Transportation External Coordination Working Group (TEC)</A> held its ninth semiannual
meeting July 16-18, 1996, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. TEC, a partnership between the
Department of Energy (DOE) and its stakeholder organizations, works to identify and resolve
significant issues related to DOE's transportation of radioactive materials. TEC's members
include personnel from various DOE program and project offices, including the Office of
Civilian Radioactive Waste Management (OCRWM) and the Office of Environmental
Management; national and regional organizations representing State, Tribal, and local
governments; professional associations; and industry organizations.<P>
<P>
The first day of meetings included a series of plenary sessions updating participants on various
DOE transportation activities. OCRWM presented an update of Program activities along with its
market-driven transportation strategy, and the Office of Environmental Management provided
updates on its spent nuclear fuel program, the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant, and its transportation
re-engineering effort. The market-driven strategy generated many questions about the role of
OCRWM versus the planned role of a transportation contractor. Other plenary sessions provided
an update on the TEC training subcommittee's work and member perspectives on current TEC
initiatives. Several members raised additional points for the TEC training subcommittee to
consider, such as potential training differences for responding to a rail versus a highway accident
and the role railroads play in training for a potential emergency.<P>
<P>
The second day was comprised of a series of breakout sessions designed to further discussion,
problem-identification, and problem-solving relating to various DOE transportation issues. These
sessions focused on transportation-related public information activities conducted by the Office
of Environmental Management and OCRWM's <cite>Federal Register</cite><a href="/pages/resource/fedreg/180c.htm"> Notice of Proposed Policy and
Procedures for Section 180(c)</a> of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, as amended. The breakout
groups discussed, among other issues, the appropriate uses of Section 180(c) funds, such as
whether the program should cover personnel costs, emergency-response equipment, and risk
assessments. The Transportation Operations session discussed developments in DOE's
transportation operations, including a discussion about the status of State authority to stop and
inspect trains, whether the Nuclear Waste Fund could be the source of funds for infrastructure
improvements, and whether DOE can streamline the transportation analysis for National
Environmental Policy Act documents while maintaining the integrity of the process. This
breakout also included presentations about OCRWM's market-driven transportation strategy and
safe dry storage of spent nuclear fuel.<P>
<P>
The breakout groups also discussed the results of a survey of TEC members that asked about
TEC's usefulness and how it might be improved. One of the results of this discussion was the
formation of Topic Groups that will work throughout the year to discuss issues in more detail
than the larger TEC breakout sessions would allow.<P>
<P>
The second day also featured a plenary session presentation by University of New Mexico staff
on the results of a national survey on public perceptions of transportation risks.<P>
<P>
On the final half-day, participants attended a plenary session and a summary of the breakout
sessions. During the plenary discussion, external agency representatives provided presentations
on their emergency response training programs. Representatives of the Federal Emergency
Management Agency, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Transportation,
the Department of Agriculture, and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission participated.<P>
