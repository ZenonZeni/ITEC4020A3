<CENTER>Inclusive Placements on the Increase; <BR>
Most Students Are Served in the Regular Classroom</B><BR>
</CENTER><P>
     States saw the largest increase in the number of students with disabilities they served under IDEA during the 1993-1994 school year, while reporting that there continued to be a great shortage of teachers and teacher aides.  A greater number of these students are being served in the regular classroom.<P>
     This and other data are reported in the recently published U.S. Department of Education's <I>17th Annual Report to Congress on the Implementation of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA)</I>, which reflects the state of education for the 1993-94 school year.<BR>
     Selected highlights from this year's report include:<P>
<CENTER><B>Students Served, Placement and Exiting Patterns,<BR>
and Personnel Shortages</B><BR>
</CENTER><BR>
The number of individuals from birth through 21 receiving special education or early intervention services in the 1993-94 school year increased by 4.2% -- the largest yearly increase since the inception of IDEA in 1976.  The distribution of specific disabilities for children age 6-21 is:<P>
&iuml;     Specific learning disabilities -- 51.1%<BR>
&iuml;     Speech/language impairments -- 21.1%<BR>
&iuml;     Mental retardation -- 11.6%<BR>
&iuml;     Serious emotional disturbance -- 8.7%<BR>
<BR>
Although students with traumatic brain injuries (TBI), other health impairments, and autism still account for less than 3% of all students with disabilities, these are the most rapidly growing categories.  The size of the increase in the number of students with TBI and autism is probably related to the fact that these reporting categories were only recently established.  The increase in the number of students with other health impairments appears to be the result of growth in the service population.  Specifically, the number of students identified as having attention deficit disorders (ADD) appears to be increasing.<P>
     <B>Part H</B>.  The number of eligible infants and toddlers receiving early intervention services on December 1, 1993 rose to 154,065, or 1.3% of the entire birth through 2 population.  This is an increase of 7.4% over the previous year.  FY 1993 was the first year all States and jurisdictions were required to assure full implementation of the Part H program in order to receive funding.  The program was appropriated $213.2 million, up 23% from the previous year. Among all eligible infants and toddlers, the home remains the most frequent service site, followed by outpatient services and early intervention classroom settings.  The 1991-92 data shows that 1) family training, counseling, and home visits; 2) special instruction; and 3) speech and language pathology were the services most often provided.<P>
     <B>Section 619 Preschool Grants Program</B>.  In FY 1994, $339 million was appropriated for this program, 4% more than the previous year.  However, during the 1993-94 school year, almost 500,000 preschoolers with disabilities received services, 8.3% more than in 1992-93.<P>
<B>     Services Provided in Integrated Settings</B>.  During the last five years, regular classroom placements for students age 6 through 21 have increased by almost 10%.  The use of resource rooms 
has decreased, and all other placement settings have remained stable.  In part, these changes may be attributed to improved data collection and reported methods in several states.<P>
     In 1992-93, 95% of students with disabilities were served in regular school buildings.  Students age 6 through 11 are most likely to be served in regular classroom settings.  This continues the trend of placing more children in inclusive settings.<BR>
<B><BR>
     Graduation Data</B>.  The graduation rate for students with disabilities as a whole has been essentially unchanged over the past five years.  Rates for students with mental retardation are slightly higher than those for students with learning disabilities or serious emotional disturbance.<P>
     Thirty percent of students with disabilities who had been enrolled in 9th through 12th grades left school by dropping out.  An additional 8% left school before 9th grade.  <P>
     Almost all youth with disabilities had access to some form of vocational education in secondary school.  Data indicated that vocational training contributed significantly to the probability of competitive employment.<P>
     Freshmen with disabilities entering college made up a much larger portion of all freshmen with disabilities, tripling between 1978 and 1991 from 2.2% to 8.8%. <BR>
<B><BR>
     Demand for Special Educators</B>.  The number of teachers employed to serve children and youth with disabilities age 6 through 21 from 1991-92 and 1992-93 increased 0.7%.  The largest special education teacher category in school year 1992-93 was the specific learning disabilities category.<P>
     Teacher aides accounted for over half (55.7%) of all staff other than special education teachers employed to serve students with disabilities age 3 through 21.  However, states also reported that the area of greatest need was teacher aides, reporting a need of an additional 5,000 full-time equivalent teacher aides to fill vacancies and to replace personnel who were not fully certified or licensed.<BR>
<B><BR>
     Funding</B>.  During FY 1994, $2.149 billion was distributed to states for the provision of special education to children with disabilities through IDEA, Part B.  The average per-child allocation has remained relatively stable over the past three years, and was $413 in FY 1994 -- an increase of only $2 over the previous year.<BR>
<B><BR>
     Serving Students with Disabilities in Rural Areas</B>.  Rural districts serve a greater percentage of students with disabilities in regular classrooms than do non-rural districts.  In rural areas, only 14.6% of students with disabilities were in full-time special education programs, while in non-rural areas 25.3% were in these types of programs.  The data also indicates that both rural and non-rural districts serve 5.5% of students with disabilities outside of their home districts.<P>
     Rural districts serve a larger percentage of children living in poverty (22.9%) than non-rural populations (20.6%).The geographic isolation common to rural districts can impede every aspect of the special education process, including identification and assessment, service delivery, and availability of adequate personnel.<P>
     Recruiting and retaining staff qualified to serve students with disabilities is particularly difficult in rural areas.  Many professionals feel socially, culturally, and professionally isolated.  <P>
