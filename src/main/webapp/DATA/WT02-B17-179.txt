<P><B>ABSTRACT</B>
<br>Wind technology has been developing rapidly over the last decade.  The 
experience gained in the wind farms of California is being used to design 
and develop advanced systems with improved performance, higher reliability, 
and lower costs. During the past several years, substantial gains have 
been made in wind turbine designs, lowering costs to an average of $0.05 
per kilowatt-hour (kWh) for utility-scale applications at 13 mile-per-hour 
(mph) average annual wind speeds.  Further technology development is 
expected to allow the cost of wind-generated electricity to drop below 
$0.04 per kilowatt-hour by 2000. As a result, wind is expected to be one 
of the least expensive forms of new electric generation in the next 
century.  With global efforts already underway to curb energy-related 
emissions of carbon dioxide, the current availability of this low-cost 
technology means that the use of wind systems will likely increase 
worldwide throughout the 1990s for both utility-scale applications and 
remote, small-village applications. This paper will present the 
technology developments for both utility-scale wind turbines and remote,
small-village wind turbines that are currently available or in development. 
The authors describe future technology improvements and likely wind turbine 
configurations in 2000.
<P>Technology innovations are being adapted for remote and stand-alone power 
applications with smaller wind turbines. Hybrid power systems using smaller 
1- to 50-kilowatt (kW) wind turbines are being developed for non-grid-connected 
electrical generation applications. These village power systems typically use wind energy, 
photovoltaics (PV), battery storage, and conventional diesel generators to supply power for 
remote small-village communities. In remote locations, transportation costs can make 
fuel-powered generating systems extremely expensive. Smaller wind turbines are also being 
explored for application as distributed generation sources on utility grids to supply power 
during periods of peak demand, avoiding costly upgrades in distribution equipment.
<P>New turbine designs now account for turbulence-induced loads, unsteady aerodynamic stall 
effects, and complex fatigue loads, making use of new technology developments 
such as advanced airfoils tailored for wind turbine applications. These 
new airfoils increase the energy capture and improve the operating 
efficiency of turbine rotors by increasing the power for a given rotor 
thrust, and reducing the sensitivity of the airfoils to roughness which 
naturally accumulates during operation. Technology has been developed 
which uses power electronics to allow variable rotor speed operation to 
improve efficiency. Aerodynamic control devices, such as ailerons and flaps, 
are being explored to aerodynamically modulate power or stop the rotor in high-speed 
conditions. These technology trends and future turbine configurations are being explored 
through research and development activities sponsored by the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE's) 
Wind Energy Program.<P><B>UTILITY SCALE-SYSTEMS</B><br>In the United States, utility-scale wind turbines are the primary 
focus of new technology development. By 1996, U.S. manufacturers will have introduced seven 
new turbines (with capacities ranging from 250 to 500 kW) for the utility market. 
Five of the turbines are being developed by members of the U.S. wind industry with direct 
funding support from DOE. Cannon Energy Corporation and Kenetech Windpower are each developing a
 utility-scale wind turbine independently. Two of the utility-scale wind turbines sponsored 
by DOE are commercially available: the Advanced Wind Turbines AWT-26 and Zond Systems Z-40. New 
World Power Technology Company, New World Grid Power, and Flowind Corporation are expected 
to introduce their turbine designs within the next two years.

<P><b><i>Advanced Wind Turbines AWT-26</i></b><br>The 275-kW AWT-26 is a 
downwind, stall-regulated, free-yaw machine incorporating an innovative 
two-bladed teetered rotor. The AWT-26 is based upon the ESI-80, a turbine 
developed in the United States during the mid-1980s which had many 
promising features, but never reached commercial maturity. The designers 
of the AWT-26 have taken advantage of the substantial operating history of 
its predecessor, retained components that were reliable, and improved the 
remainder.<P>The larger 26-meter (m) rotor incorporates aerodynamically 
efficient, wood-composite blades using National Renewable Energy Laboratory
(NREL) designed airfoils. The new blades improve the turbine's energy 
capture from 20% to 70%, depending on wind speed and the degree of blade 
soiling from dirt and insects. The AWT-26 also features a redesigned 
high-speed shaft brake and new aerodynamic tip vanes. The tip vanes serve 
two important functions on this turbine: as a fail-safe (emergency) brake 
and as an active brake for normal shut-down operations. Mounted on a hinge 
at the tip of each blade, the vanes are held closed by electromagnets. 
The vanes are activated by control system command, which releases the 
electromagnets. A redundant caliper disk brake can also stop the machine 
under normal or emergency conditions.
<P>The AWT-26 has been selected for a 
commercial 25-megawatt (MW) power plant to be installed in late 1995 in Washington 
state by a consortium of public utilities called CARES (Conservation and Renewable 
Energy Systems) as a project under the Bonneville Power Administration's Resource Supply 
Expansion Program (RSEP). The RSEP program was a competitive solicitation to add wind 
generation capacity to the Bonneville network.<p><b><i>New World Power Technology Company North Wind 
250</i></b><br>The 250-kW North Wind 250 is a two-bladed, teetered, upwind machine that has 
been scaled up from the company's North Wind 100 turbine.  The new turbine features an 
integrated drive train, aileron controls, and an innovative rotor that is fabricated as a single unit. The &quot;flow-through&quot; rotor eliminates the blade root joints, which are expensive, complicated, and subject to high stress during turbine operation. The unique, flow-through, teetered-rotor design eliminates structural discontinuities at the blade/hub interface by fabricating the rotor as one continuous 
structural element.  Fatigue tests were conducted on the full-scale rotor 
joint at NREL to qualify this element of the rotor for field testing and to 
provide information needed to improve its structural design.<P>The hub 
incorporates teeter dampers and an active teeter brake.  The rotor is made 
of a hybrid composite material. The hub saddle captures the blade center 
section in a wrap-around elastomeric blanket. The new rotor also 
substitutes aileron control for the full-span pitch control system used in 
the earlier North Wind model.
<P>Ailerons, which work like flaps on an 
airplane wing, are the most important development featured in the North 
Wind 250. When deflected in the downwind direction, they reduce lift and 
power output.  When power modulation is needed, the ailerons can be 
deflected through small angles to either increase or decrease power. 
Upwind deflections increase lift, causing the power to increase. 
Wind tunnel tests at Wichita State University have confirmed the ability of 
ailerons to control power and prevent the rotor from over-speeding.

<P><b><i>Zond Systems Z-40</i></b><br>The 500-kW Z-40 wind turbine is 
being developed by Zond Systems, Inc., with support from NREL. Zond is 
building two versions of its prototype turbine, a three-bladed, upwind, 
rigid hub machine with active yaw drive. One turbine prototype employs a 
full-span pitch control system and sits atop a tube tower. The other 
turbine uses aileron controls to provide aerodynamic braking and peak power 
modulation and sits atop a low-cost, free-standing open truss tower. Zond 
plans to compare the two turbine control strategies during prototype 
testing.<P>Both designs capitalize on the company's extensive experience
operating wind power plants using similarly designed turbines. Each 
prototype incorporates NREL-designed airfoils and an integrated gearbox 
design that minimizes the number of parts and simplifies load paths. Based 
on blade structural and fatigue testing at NREL, design changes were made 
that will improve the final design of the blades.<P><b><i>Flowind EHD
</i></b><br>Unlike the other turbines discussed in this paper, Flowind's 
300-kW EHD (<B>E</B>xtended <B>H</B>eight/<B>D</B>iameter ratio) is a 
Darrius (eggbeater-shaped) vertical-axis wind turbine. Its three blades 
spin about an axis perpendicular to the ground, capturing energy from 
winds blowing from all directions. The drive train and generator are 
located under the rotor near the ground for easy maintenance and inspection.
<P>The EHD series will use tall, high-performance 17- to 21-m rotors incorporating 
advanced airfoils designed specifically for the series. Flowind's prototype turbine 
rotor, which has a height-to-diameter ratio of 2.78, is taller and thinner than the 
19-m rotor on Flowind's existing vertical-axis turbines. The shape allows the larger rotor 
to be placed upon existing turbine bases, if desired. This design also makes it easier to 
bend the turbine blades into the desired shape and makes better (and more profitable) use of available sites in a wind power plant.<P>The EHD's low-cost blades are manufactured using a new, automated pultrusion technique, in which fiber-resin blades are pulled through a die. The blades incorporate natural laminar flow airfoils developed at Sandia National Laboratories to keep air flowing smoothly over the blades and increase energy capture. The rotor should effectively double the annual energy output of Flowind's current vertical-axis turbines which use aluminum blades and are about half as tall.
<P><b><i>New World Grid Power 500-XST</i></b><br>New World Grid Power 
will develop the 500-XST (e<B>X</B>perimental <B>S</B>ynchronous 
<B>T</B>urbine) based on the company's experience operating European 
turbines of this size. The 500-kW, upwind, three-bladed 500-XST will 
include active yaw control, a full-span pitch control rotor and a 
free-standing tubular tower. One of its most innovative features is a 
unique integrated drive train system which uses variable-speed operation. 
Therefore, it can provide a unity power factor without requiring 
capacitors for reactive power control.
<P><b>REMOTE AND VILLAGE SYSTEMS</b>
<br>Technology innovations are being adapted for remote and 
stand-alone power applications with smaller wind turbines. Hybrid power 
systems using smaller 1- to 50-kW wind turbines are being developed for 
non-grid connected electrical generation applications. These village power 
systems typically use wind energy, solar, photovoltaics (PV), battery 
storage, and a conventional diesel generator to supply power for remote, 
small-village communities. In areas without electric utility service and 
with good wind resources, a single wind turbine can provide electricity at 
lower cost than diesel generation for individual homes, schools, clinics, 
water pumping, or small industries. Larger &quot;mini-grid&quot; village 
power systems incorporating multiple wind turbines and other generation 
sources are often more economical than transmission line extension for 
communities in remote, but windy regions. Smaller wind turbines are also 
being explored for application as distributed generation sources on utility grids 
to supply power during periods of peak demand, avoiding costly upgrades in distribution 
equipment.<P>Hybrid systems comprising wind turbines, PV, batteries, and diesel generators 
have been used successfully to meet direct-current electric loads in remote international 
telecommunications markets.  These systems are now an emerging technology for generating 
alternating-current electric power for remote communities. Assisting the U.S. industry in 
developing and demonstrating hybrid systems, NREL has embarked on a program of collaborative 
technology development and technical assistance in the area of hybrid systems for village-power 
applications (Flowers <I>et al.</I> 1994).
<P><b><i>Atlantic Orient Corporation AOC 15/50</i></b><br>The 50-kW AOC 15/50 is an improved and simplified version of the Enertech 44/60 wind turbine developed in the United States in the early 1980s. The downwind, stall-regulated, three-bladed turbine features passive yaw control, wood epoxy composite blades incorporating NREL-designed airfoils, 
aerodynamic tip brakes, an electrodynamic brake, and an integrated 
drive train. Blade-fatigue testing was conducted at NREL. This turbine is 
well-suited for remote, stand-alone applications, village power systems, 
and small wind power plants.
<P>The AOC 15/50's integrated drive train 
eliminates many critical bolted joints found in conventional turbine 
designs and creates an efficient load path from the rotor to the tower top.
A cast-steel, tower-top plate further improves the efficiency of the load 
path.  The new drive train design weighs less than conventional drive trains 
and eliminates maintenance-prone couplings between the gearbox and the 
generator. Other design features include tip brakes and an optional yaw 
damper. The optional yaw damper, a passive hydraulic system that limits 
yaw rates (and gyroscopic loads), is available for turbulent wind sites.

<p><b><i>Bergey Windpower Company BWC Excel</i></b><br>Bergey Windpower 
Company (BWC) turbines use passive controls, fiberglass blades, 
direct-drive permanent-magnet alternators, and integrated structures to 
provide mechanically simple turbines between 0.85 and 10 kW. The Bergey 
BWC Excel is a 10-kW, three-bladed, direct drive, upwind wind turbine with 
passive blade-pitch control.  To achieve overspeed protection, the rotor 
yaws out of the wind.  The rotor diameter is 7 m. The BWC Excel wind 
turbine is designed to supply most of the electricity for an average 
all-electric home in areas with an average wind speed of 12 mph. In remote
locations, it can charge batteries 
for stand-alone applications or pump water electrically without the need 
for batteries. More than 1400 BWC wind turbines have been installed in a 
total of more than 60 countries. BWC, under subcontract to NREL, is 
developing a 15-kW high-frequency link, full-digital-control inverter to 
provide high reliability at low cost for its stand-alone AC systems.

<P>In 1992, a Bergey system was installed in Xcalak, Mexico, with funding 
and technical support from NREL and Sandia National Laboratories in 
cooperation with the Instituto de Investigaciones Electricas (a Mexican 
utility research organization). The system includes six Bergey 10-kW wind 
turbines, an 11.7-kW PV array, an inverter, and a battery bank. The hybrid 
system is operated without use of any backup diesel generation.

<P><b><i>Integrated Power Corporation</i></b><br>Integrated Power 
Corporation (IPC), a subsidiary of Westinghouse Electric Corporation, has 
installed PV/wind hybrid systems in Mexico and Indonesia. IPC, in 
collaboration with a Mexican utility and a rural-development organization, 
has installed PV/wind hybrid systems in two Mexican villages. The two 
systems (one with 45kWh/day capacity and the other at 125 kWh/day) were 
installed to meet commercial and residential loads and accommodate 
load growth. Anemometers were recently installed at the sites so that the 
system performance data can be analyzed collaboratively among IPC, NREL, 
and the appropriate Mexican agencies.<P>IPC has also installed PV/wind 
hybrid systems in two neighboring villages on an island near Bali, 
Indonesia. These systems were each sized for 15-kW peak power and energy 
delivery of 100 kWh/day.The two systems have been operated successfully 
in parallel, demonstrating capability to meet load growth with modular 
additions to existing systems. These installations have remote monitoring 
and control capability through a direct link to a low earth-orbit satellite 
that permits uploading and downloading system status and performance data, 
and remote diagnostics and control.<P><b><i>New World Power 
Corporation</i></b><br>New World Power Corporation (NWPC) is using its 
experience in wind, solar, and hybrid power systems, primarily in remote 
telecommunications and small, isolated power applications, to develop the 
balance-of-system components required to reliably integrate renewables 
into remote mini-grids. NWPC is in its second year of a 5-year program to 
develop and commercialize renewable-based, packaged hybrid-power systems 
with peak power capacities of 50 and 100 kW. They are using a novel rotary 
converter which eliminates the need for electronic inverters in large 
sizes. NWPC has installed its system in southern California for Southern 
California Edison Company. Additional systems are currently being 
installed in Alaska, Argentina, and Brazil.

<P><b>TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENTS</b><br>The DOE Wind Energy Program is 
supporting a robust applied research program through NREL's National Wind 
Technology Center. These applied research activities also involve Sandia 
National Laboratories, universities, and industry subcontractors. The 
highlights from these technology development and research activities are 
covered in the following paragraphs.

<P><b><i>Airfoils</i></b><br>The development of special-purpose airfoils 
for horizontal-axis wind turbines began in 1984 as a joint effort between NREL, 
formerly the Solar Energy 
Research Laboratory, and Airfoils, Incorporated. Prior to that time, 
turbine blade designers used airfoils developed for aircraft wings. Since 
1984, seven airfoil families have been developed.  NREL airfoil families 
are used on replacement blades and wind turbines developed by Atlantic 
Orient Corporation, Advanced Wind Turbines, and Zond Systems. Annual 
energy improvements from the NREL airfoil families are projected to be 23% 
to 30% for stall-regulated turbines, 8% to 20% for variable-pitch turbines, 
and 8% to 10% for variable-speed turbines (Tangler 1994). The energy 
improvement for stall-regulated turbines has been verified in field tests.

<P><b><i>Structural Testing</i></b><br>NREL's structural test facility, 
in operation since 1990, provides blade designers with information useful 
in blade development.  Wind turbine blade designs have complex geometries 
which make blade design difficult. As well, wind turbine blades comprise 
composites which have superior structural properties but 
require sophisticated analysis methods. In addition, the manufacturing 
methods allow more variability than with metals, and require careful 
quality control. Structural testing is therefore useful to help designers 
validate design assumptions, and make corrections, if necessary, in the 
prototype phase rather than discovering design problems after installation.

<P>The structural test facility is used primarily for structural testing 
of full-scale wind turbine blades for NREL's subcontractors and wind 
industry partners. Testing that has recently been performed includes 
fatigue testing, ultimate strength static testing, and several 
non-destructive techniques such as photoelastic stress analysis. Fatigue 
tests use a closed-loop servo-hydraulic system to apply cyclic loads to 
blades up to 20-m long. Under repeated loading, fatigue failures help wind 
turbine blade designers evaluate design assumptions, manufacturing 
techniques, and complex failure modes under normal and extreme operating 
loads. Blades tested at the structural test facility include the Kenetech 
Windpower 56/100 and 33-M/VS, the AOC 15/50, the New World North Wind 250 
(Musial <I>et al.</I> 1994), and the Zond Z-40.

<P><b><i>Power electronics</i></b><br>New technology has been developed 
which uses power electronics to allow variable-rotor-speed operation to 
improve efficiency, control structural loads, and improve power quality. 
Today variable-speed operation is estimated to increase energy capture by 
up to 15%, which is about the same level as the cost increase 
(Lucas <I>et al.</I> 1989). However, it is thought that 
variable-rotor-speed operation can reduce the cost of wind-generated 
electricity by reducing structural loads (allowing a lightweight, low-cost 
configuration), and improving power quality.<P><b><i>Aerodynamic control 
devices</i></b><br>Aerodynamic control devices provide two benefits: they 
are used for overspeed control and power modulation. Significant damage to 
the turbine can occur as a result of high wind or loss of generator load 
unless control of the rotor is maintained. In addition, natural wind-speed 
variations, insect-impact accumulations, or minor blade damage can result 
in off-optimum rotor rotation speeds and less-than-desired power output. 
Incorporated into turbine blades, aerodynamic control devices (also called 
trailing-edge control devices) can adjust the rotor aerodynamic driving 
forces and thus optimize energy capture, control loads, and control rotor 
speed. These aerodynamic controls are often compared to the ailerons used 
on aircraft.  Various trailing-edge control devices have been incorporated 
in wind turbines that are in development or commercially available.  NREL is
working with subcontractors and wind industry representatives to further 
study improved trailing-edge control devices. These trailing-edge control 
devices are thought to offer some cost and control advantages over pitch 
control and tip controls which are typically used on existing designs, 
although these advantages are yet to be proven.<P><b><i>National Wind 
Technology Center Hybrid Power Test Facility</i></b><br>A wind hybrid test facility 
is planned for NREL's National Wind Technology Center that will allow researchers 
to study hybrid power systems, developed by the U. S. industry, that combine wind turbines, 
photovoltaic arrays, backup generators, and storage systems (Thresher <I>et al.</I> 1994). 
The key function for the hybrid test facility will be to test small wind and hybrid power 
systems that are nearly market ready and provide a system development user's facility for 
U.S. industry.<P><b><i>Hybrid System Modeling</i></b><br>NREL is currently developing computer 
simulation codes to allow modeling of the full range of hybrid power technologies being 
considered for village power in the 1990s. Building on existing wind/diesel models, 
a new advanced hybrid systems simulation model is being developed which will accommodate a 
wider array of technologies and system architectures now being considered for hybrid village 
power systems.<P><b><i>Renewable-Hybrid Configurations</i></b>
<br>In 1994, DOE initiated a 5-year, cost-shared research collaboration 
with the U.S. Department of Agriculture to investigate a range of 
wind/diesel system configurations. The goal of this collaboration is to 
develop systems powered entirely from renewable sources (e.g., wind power, 
solar power, and use of vegetable oils in place of diesel fuel) that would 
be reliable and cost competitive. The experimental study will focus on 
performance and stability for various system configurations and will 
identify necessary controls.  This research will be performed in a 
wind/diesel test facility at the U.S. Department of Agriculture research 
laboratory at Bushland, Texas.
<P><b><i>Future Technological 
Improvements</i></b><br>The advancement of wind turbine technology is 
leading to next-generation wind turbines which promise significant 
improvements in performance, reliability, and cost. In general, each of 
these competing turbine designs will probably incorporate many of the 
following advanced features.
<p><ul><li><i>Advanced airfoils.</i> For 2000, 
structurally tailored blades made of soft, flexible materials may be 
possible. Such blades would change shape in response to wind conditions, 
increasing energy capture and reducing loads as wind speed controls 
blade shape.<br><br><li><i>Aerodynamic controls.</i> Ailerons, spoiler flaps, and 
double-split-flaps (deployed from both sides of a blade's trailing edge) 
are being examined for future use as effective rotor-speed brakes.<br><br>

<li><I>Advanced generators. </I>Using low-speed, direct-drive generators 
could eliminate the need for the gearbox, thereby reducing turbine weight 
and costs. This generator is likely to be used in combination with 
variable-speed operation to take advantage of the benefits of power 
electronics.<br><br>
<li><I>Advanced control systems. </I>Advanced, expert control 
systems capable of controlling a single wind turbine, an array of turbines, 
or an entire power plant should be commonplace in the future.  Smart 
systems can detect wind-speed changes and adjust individual turbines 
throughout a power plant.<br>
</ul><p><b><i>Advanced Wind Turbine 
Configurations</i></b><br>Two likely configurations for advanced HAWT 
designs were first suggested in a configuration study by Swift, Hock, and 
Thresher (1992). The first configuration represents a low-risk design 
path incorporating the more conventional three-bladed rotor. Innovations 
include a larger rotor diameter using advanced airfoils and 
trailing-edge flaps for overspeed control. This design is rated at 800 kW, 
which is twice the size of current machines.<P>The second machine 
incorporates higher-risk design options, including a 50-m-diameter, 
two-bladed, teetered downwind rotor. The stall-controlled rotor also has 
actively controlled ailerons for power clipping in response to gusts. The 
use of a variable-speed generator will allow increased energy capture over 
a broad range of wind speeds.  While this design philosophy is perceived as 
high risk because of its innovations, it offers high potential for reduced 
weight and therefore cost.<P><b><i>Vertical-Axis Wind Turbine (VAWT) 
Configuration</i></b><br>For 2000, the hypothesized VAWT will almost 
certainly retain one aspect of its current strength: simplicity. The key 
to future success with this configuration, however, will be cost-effective 
manufacturing techniques (primarily for blade production) that will 
produce significantly less expensive blades, based on cost per unit length 
(Dodd 1990). VAWT blades are not geometrically complex (e.g., no twist or 
taper), thus making manufacturing processes such as extrusion and 
pultrusion viable candidates to reduce costs.  In addition, the inherent 
advantage of the VAWT configuration, having all drive train and generator 
parts at ground level, creates opportunities for using components with 
high weight or large physical size. Of recent interest in this regard is 
the direct- or linear-drive generator, which eliminates the need for a 
gearbox and provides the advantages of variable-speed operation at a very 
competitive price.<p><b>SUMMARY</b><br>Significant progress has been made 
in wind energy technology over the last decade. Today's advanced systems 
offer improved performance, higher reliability, and lower costs. Turbine 
designs now make use of new technical developments such as advanced 
airfoils, information from structural blade testing, variable rotor speed 
operation, and aerodynamic controls. These developments have been 
incorporated into wind turbines that are, or will soon be, commercially 
available at a cost of energy at, or below $0.05/kWh. Further cost 
reductions are expected as the technology evolves and moves toward larger 
scales, and mass production.<P>Technology innovations are being adapted 
for remote and stand-alone power applications with smaller wind turbines. 
Village power systems using wind energy, photovoltaics, battery storage, 
and a conventional diesel generator are successfully providing power in 
remote locations.  These systems can compete economically due to the high 
cost of either utility grid extension or the cost of delivered fuel and 
maintenance for a diesel unit alone.
