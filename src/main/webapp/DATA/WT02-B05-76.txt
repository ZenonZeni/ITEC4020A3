(1) TESTIMONY ENDS IN COURT BATTLE TO OVERTURN THE CDA - CLOSING ARGUMENTS SET
    FOR MAY 10

Hearings ended today in the constitutional challenge to the Communications
Decency Act with the cross-examination of government witness Dan Olsen. The
court also announced today that closing arguments in this landmark case
will be heard on May 10 (the hearing had originally been scheduled for June
3).

Dan Olsen, Chair of the Department of Computer Science Brigham Young
University, testified on Friday April 12 about a scheme he developed two
weeks ago for rating sexually-explicit content on the Internet.  Olsen's
proposal would require content providers to label their sites with an
"-L18" tag if the site contains sexually oriented material.  During cross
examination on Friday and again today, CIEC and ACLU lawyers criticized
Olsen's proposal as inflexible and extremely difficult to implement.

All three judges presiding over the case -- Dolores Sloviter, chief judge
of the U.S. Third Circuit Court of Appeals, and the U.S. District Judges
Stewart Dalzell and Ronald Buckwalter -- questioned Olsen for almost 45
minutes about his proposal, and seemed unconvinced by his presentation.

At one point, Judge Sloviter asked, "I am wondering if whether in essence
your scheme requires some material to be blocked in advance, and if you can
think of any time in our history when we have blocked material in advance
in an organized fashion?"

Olsen replied that he believed newspaper editors did this routinely.  In
response to another question from Judge Sloviter, Olsen admitted his plan
would "make it easier for the government to censor material" on the
Internet if it one day chose to do so directly.

GOVERNMENT RESTS ITS CASE AFTER CALLING ONLY TWO WITNESSES

The government rested its case today after calling only two witnesses in
defense of the Communications Decency Act.  The CIEC and ACLU cases called
a total of 13 witnesses. Interestingly, over two days of hearings, neither
witness offered testimony explicitly defending the CDA as written. Instead,
the testimony appeared designed to convince the court that the CDA is
narrowly drawn and therefore satisfies the "least restrictive means" test.


In short, the government witnesses testified:

* That sexually explicit material is available to minors on the Internet
  (a claim that neither the CIEC nor the ACLU challenges dispute).

* Requiring content providers to label content will prevent minors from
  accessing sexually explicit material on the Internet.

CIEC and ACLU attorneys argue that the content labeling scheme proposed by
Olsen is would not be a "good faith defense" under the CDA, and is
therefore irrelevant, and that the Government has not proven that the
Communications Decency Act is the "least restrictive means" of protecting
children from inappropriate material on the Internet.

Speaking to reporters at the end of today's hearing, CIEC lead attorney
Bruce Ennis summarized the last two days of testimony by saying, " ... in
the final analysis parents have the ability and the technology to control
what kids see ... without reducing all content on the Internet to the level
appropriate for an eight-year-old."  Ennis added, "This law is
unconstitutional."

CLOSING ARGUMENTS SET FOR MAY 10

On May 10, the plaintiffs and the government will each present two hours of
closing arguments.  A decision is expected from the three judge panel in
mid-June. Any appeal of the ruling will be made directly to the Supreme
Court under expedited review provisions of the Telecommunications Reform
Act.
