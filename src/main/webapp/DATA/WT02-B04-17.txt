<H3>DECISION IN INTERNET CHALLENGE HAILED AS VICTORY FOR PARENTS, CHILDREN
AND AMERICAN TRADITION OF FREE SPEECH</H3>
PHILADELPHIA, Pennsylvania -- Parents, librarians, online companies, publishers,
newspaper reporters and others challenging government censorship of cyberspace
today hailed an historic decision by a federal court enjoining the government
from enforcing portions of a new law which violate constitutionally protected
free speech. <BR>
<BR>
But plaintiffs in the American Library Association v. U.S. Department of
Justice suit warned that the battle against the Communications Decency Act
may not be over if the government appeals today's decision to the Supreme
Court. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;This is a victory for the Internet and for everyone who values free
speech,&quot; said Jerry Berman of the Center for Democracy and Technology
and a co-founder of the Citizens Internet Empowerment Coalition that organized
the suit. <BR>
<BR>
In their 175-page decision, the three judge panel of the U.S. District Court
for the Eastern District of Pennsylvnia found the law unconstitutional on
grounds that it violated rights of free speech. All three judges -- Dolores
K. Sloviter, chief judge of the U.S. Third Circuit Court of Appeals, and
U.S. District Judges Ronald L. Buckwalter and Stewart Dalzell wrote individual
opinions supporting the panel's unanimous decision to enforce an injunction
against the government. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Our findings of fact -- many of them undisputed -- express our understanding
of the Internet. These Findings lead to the conclusion that Congress may
not regulate indecency on the Internet at all,&quot; wrote Judge Dalzell,
referring to the extensive study of the Internet. <BR>
<BR>
The Judges concluded: the &quot;plaintiffs have shown irreparable injury,
no party has any interest in the enforcement of an unconstitutional law,
and therefore the public interest will be served by granting a preliminary
injunction.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
The 27 plaintiffs in the case, which was joined by the court with another
suit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union, complained that the law
imposed criminal penalities on speech in cyberspace that is otherwise entirely
lawful. It was the first time in American history that criminal penalities
had been placed on the exercise of free speech. <BR>
<BR>
The result of the unconstitutional law was that books legal on library shelves
could land a librarian in jail if posted on-line. The terms used in the
law were so vague that they encompassed vast amounts of material with literary,
artistic, political, cultural and medical value, and threatened to penalize
people who did not realize they were violating a law. <BR>
<BR>
The law was not aimed at curbing obscenity or child pornography on the Internet,
which already are against the law. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;We are ecstatic. Librarians can continue to provide ideas and information
to the public regardless of the format, without concern about fines or jail
terms,&quot; said Judith Krug from the American Library Association. &quot;This
is victory for anyone who uses the public libraries.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
In addition, the law would fail in its goal of protecting children since
large amounts of material on the Internet originate overseas, beyond the
reach of U.S. law. <BR>
<BR>
During five days of hearings, plaintiffs showed the court the unique nature
of the new medium and demonstrated software that allows parents to easily
monitor and control the material coming into homes and schools. Plaintiffs
argued that such technology was more effective than any law, empowered users
to make their own judgements about what they wanted to see and protected
Americans' First Amendment rights to free expression. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;The court today did for children and adults what Congress did not
-- It decided that parental control tools combined with user education and
enforcement of existing laws is a more effective and constitutional way
to protect children and safeguard our freedoms,&quot; said Bill Burrington,
Assistant General Counsel of America Online. <BR>
<BR>
Other countries were watching the outcome of the case closely. Many nations,
such as Germany, France and Japan, are just beginning to grapple with Internet
issues. Other nations, such as China and Saudi Arabia, already have imposed
strict controls on the medium, which Judge Dalzell referred to during the
hearings as &quot;the most democratic medium yet devised by the imagination
of man.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&quot;This court is the first to fully grapple with and grasp the unique
nature and potential of the Internet. The court's decision today to afford
communications over the Internet heightened protections recognizes the value
of this new medium in a democracy,&quot; said Bruce J. Ennis, lead attorney
in the case. &quot;This decision will help define the legal framework for
future decision related to the Internet.&quot; <BR>
