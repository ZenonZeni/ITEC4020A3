ANNUAL EXHIBITION OF INVENTIONS

from TRADEWINDS' INDUSTRY WEEKLY, September 23-29, 1996

The annual exhibition of inventions in Taiwan has always been a
good place to find newly-developed products that haven't yet
appeared in the market-place. This year was no exception.

The 1996 show attracted more than 100,000 people to the exhibition
hall in Taipei's domestic airport from August 22-25. The show moved
to Taichung from August 29-September 1, and closed in Kaohsiung
from September 5-8.

"Many Taiwan inventors are small entrepreneurs that don't know how
to cross the bridge to international markets from the home or
office," said Johnson Huang, an engineer with Gwo Yann Enterprise
Co., and recipient of the China International Invention Award.

"The show tries to match buyers and sellers of products, and
particularly aims to help inventors to get their ideas in to the
market," he said.

The flavor is local as the show guide is in Chinese, and over each
product table is a poster with a photo of the inventor and the
product, a product description, and contact information. The text
is in Chinese, however, and international traders that don't read
or speak Chinese may need a translator.

Many of the products shown have been patented but not yet launched
locally or overseas.

Taichung inventor, Long Yu-chen was showing a model of a
lightweight plastic shaft with a clamp on the bottom that can be
used to pick up shoes.

"It's very useful for pregnant women that find bending over
uncomfortable," she said. It's also suitable for obese individuals
that have trouble bending down, she said.

Mr. Long, who was at the exhibition in search of agents that would
export the product, was taking orders for the product at NT$150
each.

Other inventors present had already launched products in Taiwan and
were looking to expand their overseas channels.

Liou Tian-an, for example, displayed shoes that contain air vents
that allow odors to escape. "I hope to eventually cooperate with
Nike on this," he claimed. Mr. Liou, vice president of Liou Tian An
Trade Co., said that he got the idea from an interest in massage
products, and in search of a way to reduce sweat and odor in his
own shoes.

Machinery products were also displayed. You Lian Machinery Co.
displayed a powered grease applicator. It applies grease quickly
without air compression. It has already been successfully sold in
Taiwan, said W.H. Liu, a sales manager.

Sheng Wu Fu Co. displayed an "autocraft power maximizer," which the
company says boosts mileage by 15 percent in urban driving, by
reducing waste connected to air conditioner use.

Chai Thou Industrial Corp. displayed automatic car cigarette
lighters with music. The product can be plugged into cigarette
lighters in cars. Customers insert the cigarette head and it is lit
automatically.

ISO 14000: CONSIDERABLE BENEFITS, COMPANIES URGED TO JOIN PILOT SCHEME

from TRADEWINDS' INDUSTRY WEEKLY, September 23-29, 1996

Singapore companies can reap considerable benefits by adopting
environmental controls under the ISO 14000 Environmental Management
System (EMS) standards.

The benefits include:

  Improved operational efficiency;

  Better utilization of materials and resources;

  Reduced costs and wastage;

  Increased access to world markets;

  Improved staff morale and working environment;

  Assurance to customers, stake-holders and regulators;

  Enhanced corporate image.

These benefits would be reflected in companies' "bottom lines,"
said the Minister for Trade and Industry, Yeo Cheow Tong, at the
launch of the Productivity and Standards Board's (PSB) ISO 14000
EMS Certification Scheme.

Mr. Yeo cited as an example an MNC in Singapore, which saved nearly
US$1.5 million a year by recycling its packaging materials.

Urging local companies to join the certification scheme, Mr. Yeo
added: "Apart from material benefits, companies can also gain
goodwill with the community and their customers. Being seen as a
respectable corporate citizen enhances a company's image."

Mr. Yeo announced that the government would provide financial
assistance to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) for ISO
14000 consultancy and certification.

Grants to cover 70 percent of consultancy costs (up to a maximum of
US$40,000) and for 50 percent (maximum US$6,000) of certification
costs will be funded through the PSB's Local Enterprise Technical
Assistance Scheme (LETAS).

"Singapore has always been conscious of maintaining a `clean and
green' environment," said Mr. Yeo. "From the early days of
industrialization, the government has been mindful of the need to
protect Singapore's minimal natural resources and ensure that
industry is not developed at the expense of the environment."

He said that with the setup of the Ministry of the Environment in
1972, Singapore became one of the first countries in the world to
create a ministry specifically for environmental protection.

"Our sustained efforts at government, corporate and individual
levels have earned Singapore international recognition as a `clean
and green city' but we cannot be complacent," said Mr. Yeo.

"A growing population and continued economic and industrial
development will impose further demands on our fragile
environment," he said.

Mr. Yeo urged Singapore companies to seriously consider the
adoption of ISO 14000 in view of the many benefits that can be
gained.

Meanwhile, to help Singapore companies to adopt ISO 14000, the PSB
has started a pilot certification program open to all companies
until the end of this year.

So far, seven companies from the manufacturing and service sectors
have joined the pilot program. They will receive feedback on their
EMS implementation, and will undergo trial assessment at no cost
before formal certification by the PSB.

"I would urge more companies to join the pilot program," said Dr.
Steve Lai, PSB general manager for Standards and Technology, when
the PSB ISO 14000 EMS Certification Scheme was launched on May 28.

The objective of the pilot program is to provide a partnership
arrangement between Singapore-based companies and the PSB to ensure
smooth implementation of ISO 14000, he said.

The launch, which was organized jointly by the PSB and the
Singapore Confederation of Industries (SCI), and supported by the
Ministry of the Environment (ENV), was followed by a seminar in
which experts in environmental management and certification from
Japan, the United Kingdom and Singapore shared their experiences
with local industry leaders and executives.

The seminar speakers included Mr. Kimihiro Torisaki, director of
planning and coordination, Japan Accreditation Board (JAB) for
Quality System Registration, Japan; Mr. Clive Mason, deputy
director of the Regional Institute of Environmental Technology

U.S. MACHINE TOOL COMPANIES LEAD THE INDUSTRY IN NEW IDEAS

from TRADEWINDS' INDUSTRY WEEKLY, September 23-29, 1996

BY MOIRA NIELD

After realizing that being number one in the machine tool industry
is no longer the easy job it used to be, U.S. manufacturers have
faced up to their competition. Companies like Ingersoll Milling
Machine Co. based in Rockford, IL, were showing off their technical
innovations to the 120,000 visitors of IMTS '96. Its newest
product, the HVM 600, a grinding machine used in the automobile and
aircraft industries, is powered by linear motors. Linear motors are
faster than traditional rotary motors and don't need the bearings,
worm screws and gear boxes that rotary motors require. It is all
magnetic.

U.S. companies are coming up with innovative ideas that are moving
the machine tool industry forward. The average machinist today is a
computer expert and a math wizard. Skilled tool and parts makers
are hard to find in today's job force. Virtually all the machinery
at the IMTS show is computerized and automated. That is the future
of the business.

Most forecasters expected the machine tool market to be off last
year's strong pace, but the Association for Manufacturing
Technology is quite enthusiastic about the first half of 1996.
Orders for U.S. industrial tools rose 18.74 percent in June from
the previous month to reach 2.9 million. Orders dropped slightly in
July down to 2.7 million. The outlook for the rest of the year
continues to show a bright picture, especially for exports.

U.S. machine tool companies realize they have to keep up the good
work and innovative technology to keep up with the competition.

TAIWAN MACHINE TOOL COMPANIES EXCEL AT IMTS '96

from TRADEWINDS' INDUSTRY WEEKLY, September 23-29, 1996

BY DAN ANDERSON

Chicago, Illinois  This year's International Machine Tools Show
(IMTS) brought together another diverse and impressive group of
exhibitors from Taiwan. Taiwan companies continue to show why they
are leading players in the machine tools industry with their wide-
range of quality products at competitive prices. The products on
display included: machinery parts and components, ball screws,
grinding machines, milling machines, electric discharge machines
(EDM),  lathes, and machining centers. It is important to note that
almost all of these machines are of the highest CNC control-type.

With these Taiwan manufacturers increasing their penetration into
the European and U.S. markets it is important that they meet the
stringent standards in place, and this is where Taiwan companies
have greatly increased their overall standing. Over 70 percent of
the Taiwan companies exhibiting at this year's show hold ISO 9000
certification or the new European CE standard. These increased
quality standards combined with Taiwan companies' innovation and
entrepreneurial abilities may provide the best answers as to why
Taiwan companies are expected to increase their market share over
the next few years.

Awea Machantronic Co., Ltd. is a perfect example of a Taiwan
company using indigenous Taiwan technology to successfully compete
with the strong competitors from Germany, Japan, Switzerland, and
the United States. Awea has taken technology that was first
developed at the Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI), a
Taiwan government sponsored technology institute, and incorporated
this technology into their Double Column Machining Centers. This
product is competitively priced and Awea has already sold over 20
of these machines during the first half of this year. It is also
utilizing a marketing outreach program by advertising in most of
the major machine tool trade publications in order to further
promote the company and its products.

Another strong example comes from Corisma Machine Tool Co., Ltd.
Corisma has only been in business for six years but has already
developed a strong foothold in the machine tools market utilizing
its high technology expertise. The company is a three time winner
of Taiwan's Symbol of Excellence (1993, 1995, 1996) and this year
it was awarded the prize of Outstanding Enterprise in Taiwan.
During this year's IMTS, Corisma is finding positive responses to
its newly developed CNC Wire-Cut EDM. According to a Corisma
representative, it was the first maker in Taiwan of such a product
with almost all of their competitors coming from either Japan or
Switzerland. Though competition is well-based, the company still
expressed optimism that because of its stringent quality standards
(it has CE qualification) and competitive pricing, it will enjoy a
positive penetration into this market segment.

Another area where Taiwan companies are looking to excel is the
development of strategic partnerships. By utilizing Taiwan's
relatively low production costs but still maintaining high-quality
standards, Taiwan companies are increasingly looking to develop
alliances with their Japanese, European and U.S. competitors,
providing both sides with a more competitive product.

For instance, Leadwell CNC Machines Mfg., Corp., a leading Taiwan
machine tools company, has developed, in conjunction with the U.S.
company Wes-tech, Inc., an automatic CNC lathe using robotic gantry
technology. Leadwell is very optimistic about this new product and
has expressed a positive opinion towards its partnership with Wes-
tech. They think it is a good way to utilize each company's
individual strengths to develop a better product. In yet another
example, Yeong Chine Machinery Industrial Company, a maker of
machining centers, CNC lathes, and milling machines, is working
with both Japanese and German companies to sell new machinery to
the global market. By developing alliances they feel confident that
their competitiveness can only get better.

As Taiwan companies continue to achieve better quality and stronger
marketing ties they can expect a better position in the global
machine tools market.

BIG BICYCLE MAKERS SUFFER LOSS IN SALES

from TRADEWINDS' INDUSTRY WEEKLY, September 23-29, 1996

Several of Taiwan's listed leading bicycle manufacturers suffered
declines in sales in August this year, with some plummeting more
than 20 percent, according to Economic Daily News report.

Giant Manufacturing Co., Ltd., Taiwan's biggest bicycle maker,
netted more than US$15 million in August, a drop of 23.36 percent
compared with the same month of last year. The accumulated revenues
in the Jan.-August period stood at US$118 million, a reduction of
24.68 percent compared with the corresponding period a year
earlier.

The second largest bicycle manufacturer, Merida Industry Co., Ltd.,
suffered a reduction of 22.66 percent in August sales to reach US$9
million. In the first eight months of the year, Merida's sales
decreased 25.39 percent to reach US$59 million.

The two bicycle giants attributed the sales reduction to less
orders this year from the U.S. due to inventory kept from last
year.

KAOHSIUNG LOOKING FOR WAYS TO EXPAND ITS INDUSTRIAL BASE (I)

from TRADEWINDS' INDUSTRY WEEKLY, September 23-29, 1996

This article is reprinted from the Free China Review. The second
part will be continued in the same column next week.

"You'll find us rough," Pegotty told David Copperfiield, "but
you'll find us ready." Pegotty might have been a Kaohsiung man.
Students of city polarity will recognize the scenario at once.
Paris and Marseilles regularly trade insults. London scoffs at
Liverpool and gets as good as it gives. And New York looks down on
everyone. In the blue corner, a bunch of effete, white-wine-
imbibing nincompoops wearing silly, overpriced clothes who pretend
to run things while messing them up. In the red corner, beer-
swilling urban peasants good only for making steel, or whatever it
is that they make these days in those nasty, smelly factories. On
the one hand, Taipei, Taiwan's center of commerce and culture. On
the other, Kaohsiung, the island's second largest city, an
industrialized behemoth on the southwestern coast that belches
forth smoke, has more container ships than you can shake a stick
at, generates money twenty-four hours a day, and is home to 1.4
million citizens who are not afraid to call a spade a spade.

People who study this power-house for long enough sometimes come to
the conclusion that Kaohsiung may be the island's second city but
it ought to be the first. The industries located within its 153
square kilometers contribute as much to Taiwan's prosperity as
Taipei. It enjoys clear, sunny weather on an average of 270 days a
year, as opposed to about 180 in Taipei. It has mountains, the sea,
great seafood, cheaper rents and real estate, and better traffic
conditions than Taipei. Question: Why, then, do so few people want
to live and work there?

The answers are complex. For all its merits, Kaohsiung still has
serious problems: a lack of cultural facilities, a standard of
living well below Taipei's, and the worst pollution on the island.
"It's not pleasant having your living room invaded by some noxious
chemical stench while you're trying to enjoy a quiet evening at
home," says Chang Tiao, an architect who has lived in Kaohsiung for
eighteen years. Another resident, Wu Chiu-hui, shudders as she
talks about the tap water. "After you boil it you're left with this
white, foamy scum on the inside of the pot," she says. "I don't
know anybody who dares drink the stuff. We all use filters or drink
mineral water." Local burghers hope to make Kaohsiung into an
international city, and with luck and a lot of hard work it might
one day eclipse Taipei as Taiwan's business hub. But, absent some
fairly dramatic changes in living conditions, the odds are that
those who make these dreams come true will want to commute from
afar.

Kaohsiung is one of Taiwan's oldest cities, and its development has
always been inextricably linked to the sea. In the mid-seventeenth
century, fishermen from the mainland recognized the harbor's
potential as a fishing port, offering an ideal shelter from storms,
and began to settle there. During their respective rules over
Taiwan, both the Dutch (1624-1662), and the Japanese (1895-1945),
understood Kaohsiung's potential as a fishing center and fostered
its growth. Today, it is the hub of Taiwan's deep-sea fishing
industry and its fleet brings in more than half the island's annual
catch.

Kaohsiung Harbor is also an ideal deep-water port. Because Taiwan
lacks natural resources, heavy industries that rely on imported raw
materials have tended to establish themselves in Kaohsiung. Chinese
Petroleum set up a refinery there in 1946, and China Steel and
China Shipbuilding both came in the 1970s.

Export processing zones

Export industries also took advantage of the harbor. The Japanese
had developed the city as an export center for Taiwan's sugar
industry, and in the 1960s two export processing zones were set up
to help send goods made in Taiwan to world markets.

This industrial city was not born by chance. It was the policy of
the Japanese colonial government to develop commerce in northern
Taiwan and industry in the south, a policy that was maintained
after Taiwan's return to Chinese control. And it was a policy that
paid off: Kaohsiung's industries fueled Taiwan's transformation
from an island of fishing and farming villages to the world's
third largest container shipping port.

But whether discussing the city with residents or pounding its
wide, relatively uncluttered streets, the visitor always comes back
to pollution. It is a problem that goes well beyond mere
inconvenience. Kaohsiung's pollution positively discourages white-
collar professionals from moving to the city, while driving out
some who are there already. As a result, Kaohsiung has never been
able to develop the kind of service industry base that has helped
Taipei become the island's wealthiest city. Hence Kaohsiung's
reputation as a city populated primarily by blue-collar workers
whose career opportunities are limited to industries such as
shipping, fishing, steel, and petrochemicals.

When Chang Tiao was interviewing architects for a company he used
to work for, he found that very few of them were willing to move to
Kaohsiung. "Young people always opted for Taipei first, then
Taichung or Tainan," he says. "Many Kaohsiung natives wouldn't work
here if they had the choice." The result is a Catch-22: a shortage
of white-collar jobs means a shortage of white-collar
professionals, which discourages service industries from setting up
in Kaohsiung, leading in turn to a shortage of white-collar jobs.
"If we're going to attract the people we need to develop this city,
we have to improve its living environment," Chang Tiao says.
"Cleaning up pollution must be our first priority."

Human nature being what it is, people want to know who to blame for
Kaohsiung's ills. Government is invariably the first to be
fingered. When the R.O.C. took control of Taiwan in 1945. Kaohsiung
was administered from Taipei by the Taiwan High Commissioner's
Office. In 1947, it became a provincial municipality under the
jurisdiction of the provincial government, and in 1979 it was
designated a special municipality, like Taipei. But that didn't do
much for the place. Some people even believe it hindered the city's
development. Architect Chang Tiao explains that, unlike provincial
municipalities whose mayors were popularly elected, mayors for
special municipalities were appointed by the central government, a
practice that ended only in 1994. "The less they did, the less
chance they had of making mistakes, and the brighter their
political future," he says. "So no mayor tried to develop the
city."

But many Kaohsiung residents, including Wu Den-yih, its present,
popularly elected mayor, say it's not fair to put all the blame on
previous city administrations. Central government policies that
focus on the development of northern Taiwan at the expense of the
south are equally guilty. Mayor Wu talks about Taipei as Taiwan's
brain, and Kaohsiung as the island's heart. The brain gives the
orders, but the heart keeps the blood flowing. Since they are of
equal importance, therefore, the central government should treat
them as such. But according to Mayor Wu, while the central
government has taken good care of the brain, it has neglected
Taiwan's heart. He points out that the annual budget allocation
from the central government to Kaohsiung is only a third of
Taipei's.

City officials and residents agree that Kaohsiung has suffered
grievously from this arrangement, particularly in the development
of its infrastructure, service industries, educational system, and
standard of living. "Since there are only two special
municipalities in Taiwan, most people take it for granted that
Taipei is number one and Kaohsiung is number two," Chang Tiao says.
"In terms of population, Kaohsiung is indeed Taiwan's second
largest city, but in terms of family income and standard of public
education, Kaohsiung barely makes the to five."

COMPANY INTRODUCING NEW AUTOPARTS, ACCESSORIES YEARLY

from TRADEWINDS' INDUSTRY WEEKLY, September 23-29, 1996

BY SEAN GRIFFIN

When the 30 employee strong Outie Company, Ltd. of Changhua began
as a manufacturer and distributor of auto mirrors in 1993, company
officials had no idea that the company would grow so large, so
fast.

Today, less than three years later, the company is producing more
than 300 types of car parts and accessories, and has earned a
reputation as a company to be reckoned with in this incredibly
competitive business. With plans to introduce nearly a dozen items
yearly, the company's current IDFR brand accessories range from key
chains and car body decorations to mirrors, fog lights, mufflers
and reflectors.

Utilizing PVC, stainless steel, aluminum and woven carbon fiber
combined with chrome, gold, wooden and assorted finishes, Outie
Company is able to produce a host of quality items for its
customers.

The company's latest products include a cigarette lighter adapter
which allows for three sockets to be created from one plug. The
company's walnut-grain veneer manufacturing technology  imported
from Japan  gives this product a unique finish. A newly designed
lightweight car rack has also recently been introduced to the
company's roster of products, as have a variety of finely finished
car interior accessories.

While Taiwan accounts for about 50 percent of the company's current
market, the Middle East and the U.S. are the focus of the company's
export sales and stand at about 30 and 20 percent respectively.

Outie plans to continue introducing new and innovative car
accessories in the future and hopes to expand sales into larger
markets such as Europe and South America. Outie is currently
looking for agents worldwide.

Samples are available from the company upon request. Regular orders
are available within one month and a minimum order of one container
