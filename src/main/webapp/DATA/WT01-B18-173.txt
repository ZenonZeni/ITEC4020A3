<H2><I>F. </I>Industrial Efficiency Services Will Exemplify Efficiency Programs 
in a Restructured Industry</H2>

<BR>
Implementing effective industrial efficiency programs requires specialized 
expertise. By far, the greatest energy-efficiency savings are gleaned from 
changes in the industrial process. Process equipment and manufacturing 
configurations account for a whopping 90 percent of a typical industrial 
firm's overall energy use. <BR>
<p>     Many utilities hesitate to invest the time and effort required to 
locate trained assessors capable of evaluating different types of 
manufacturing operations. Utilities, however, have a compelling reason to 
target industry: industrial firms consume roughly 25 percent of all energy 
consumed in the United States.<a href="#130" name="r130"> [ 130 ] </a><BR>
<p>     A number of case studies demonstrate that utility-industry 
partnerships can deliver efficiency improvements to the industrial process 
which save money, increase production, while reducing emissions. By 
bundling energy-efficiency <I>services</I> with power sales to their 
largest customers - services that include assistance with process 
manufacturing improvements that streamline operations and save on utility 
bills<a href="#131" name="r131"> [ 131 ] </a>#139;industries stay put, jobs remain in the local area, and 
utilities improve their customer relations. Industrial DSM programs will 
be a key component of utility restructuring. As the following examples 
attest, successful industrial DSM programs are already underway in several 
regions.<BR>
<BR>
<B><I> <p>     <A NAME="WesternMassachusettsElectric">Western Massachusetts Electric<a>.</B></I> Western 
Massachusetts Electric serves 810 industrial customers, which make up 27.1 
percent of its load. The utility, strapped with high rates due to the cost 
of bringing a nuclear power plant on line, had, on average in 1992, the 
third-highest electrical rates in Massachusetts - 8.9 cents per 
kilowatt-hour for industrial customers. But Western Massachusetts Electric 
now works directly with its industrial customers to find solutions to its 
high rates and to enhance customer competitiveness.<a href="#132" name="r132"> [ 132 ] </a>
<p>    <p>      For example, <B><I><A NAME="GreenfieldIndustries">Greenfield Industries<a>,</B></I> a machine tool 
manufacturer and a Western Massachusetts Electric customer, had to cut 
costs and improve competitiveness if it was to remain in business. The 
utility stepped in with technical advice, and partnered with Greenfield to 
restructure the production line. The utility first offered to pay for a 
walk-through assessment of the plant, and subsequently subcontracted out a 
more detailed energy assessment, and it split the costs with Greenfield. 
Most of the measures recommended in the assessment were then implemented 
by the subcontractor, including new vacuum furnaces and monitoring plans. 
The utility paid an incentive rebate based on an avoided cost of 5 cents 
per kilowatt-hour. The rebate was enough to ensure that Greenfield's 
expenses for the retrofits paid for themselves from energy savings over 
just two years. Greenfield spent roughly $2 million on the new furnaces 
and plant reorganization, which included moving from a production process 
design that used 300,000 square feet across nine floors to one that 
utilized only 60,000 square feet an one floor. As a result of the 
improvements, Greenfield's production has risen 25 percent, market share 
has expanded, product quality has improved, and scrap rates have declined 
sharply. The firm estimates that 90 percent of its improved outlook is due 
to the process efficiency improvements - made possible by Western 
Massachusetts Electric. Greenfield's annual energy costs have fallen from 
$1 million to less than $400,000. The two new vacuum furnaces alone cut 
electricity consumption by 82 percent; the old furnaces consumed 1.8 
million kilowatt-hours annually, while the new furnaces use 314,300 
kilowatts per year, which means that carbon dioxide emissions decreased by 
984 metric tons annually.<a href="#133" name="r133"> [ 133 ] </a>
<p>    <p>      The process efficiency improvements also eliminated 
manufacturing steps required by the old system, which necessitated the use 
of chlorofluorocarbons as well as cyanide. In fact, the utility 
partnership helped the company essentially eliminate hazardous waste 
generation. Productivity is up; managers have hired two new employees and 
expect to hire 12 to 16 more in the near future. In sum, the 
utility-industry partnership increased dramatically the facility's energy 
efficiency, reduced its generation of hazardous wastes, and improved 
productivity substantially. Equally important, employees are committed to 
continuous process improvements in production and in reducing waste. The 
change in employee outlook builds an enhanced pride in the company, and 
further spurs productivity.<a href="#134" name="r134"> [ 134 ] </a><P>
<B><I> <p>     <A NAME="WisconsinElectric">Wisconsin Electric<a>.</B></I> Wisconsin Electric's "Smart 
Money for Business" program offers commercial and industrial customers 
zero-to-low interest loans or cash rebates for installing qualifying 
energy-efficiency measures. Prescriptive rebates are available for 
lighting, motor, HVAC, and refrigeration measures, while custom incentives 
are available for process-related improvements and are negotiated with 
each participant (between 15 and 30 percent of a custom project's total 
costs are typically covered by the incentive). Utility engineers 
communicate with process-level plant personnel, marketing the program to 
them; larger projects involve senior management of both the utility and 
customer simultaneously. More than half of all Wisconsin Electric's 
industrial customers have received rebates or loans through the Smart 
Money program. The utility has found that personal, one-on-one contact 
with the customer while providing technical expertise is essential to 
successful process-oriented programs. The program has reduced the 
utility's sales to industrial customers by 2.5 percent, at a levelized 
cost of 2.1 cents per kilowatt-hour saved. From 1987 through October 1993, 
Wisconsin Electric's cumulative electricity savings were 357,600 
megawatt-hours, deferring 71.7 megawatts of capacity and cutting carbon 
dioxide emissions by 217,778 metric tons.<a href="#135" name="r135"> [ 135 ] </a>
<B><I> <p>     <A NAME="BonnevillePowerAdministration">Bonneville Power Administration </a>. </B></I> Bonneville's 
decentralized, flexible "Energy $avings Plan" seeks to form partnerships 
with industrial customers and tailor process efficiency improvements to 
their needs. For example, the <B><I><A NAME="HolnamCompany">Holnam Company<a>,</B></I> a cement 
manufacturer in Seattle, sought to reduce its rising energy costs to 
compete in an increasingly competitive market for cement in the Pacific 
Northwest. Based on an assessment and plant evaluation sponsored by 
Bonneville, Holnam carried out four energy-efficiency projects, at a total 
cost of $248,232. Bonneville reimbursed the company $115,615 to account 
for the saved energy. The four projects, all of which targeted the 
production process, included kiln drive motors, kiln stack gas 
precipitators, cooler grate drive motors, and cooler fan motors. They will 
save a projected 1,782 megawatt-hours, or 3.4 kilowatt-hours per ton of 
cement, annually - improving productivity. These savings cut carbon 
dioxide emissions by 248 metric tons annually.<a href="#136" name="r136"> [ 136 ] </a>Most important, the 
partnership has established a flexible mechanism for future process 
efficiency improvements.<BR>
