<P>Whether the EV1 is in itself a--marketing success is any-one's guess--and undoubtedly the subject of plenty of 
computer and meeting time throughout the entire GM organization, all the way to the top (it is the cover shot of the 1995 GM annual report; it is the first vehicle in the corporation's history--and realize it was established in 1908--to carry a &quot;GM&quot; designation). Robert C. Purcell, Jr., executive director, GM Advanced Technology Vehicles, GM North American Operations, admits that the $350-million investment in development made since 1990 &quot;will not be recovered in the sale of the vehicle.&quot; He states, unequivocally, however, &quot;This car is the first. It is not the last.&quot; So there will be a generation of products from GM that will be, in effect, the offspring of the just-born EV1: different types of battery-power units; combination fuel cell-electrics, and so on. The EV1 is not an experimental vehicle. It is a production car.

<P>Maureen E. Midgley, plant manager for EV1 Manufacturing at the Lansing Craft Centre in Lansing, Michigan, won't say how long it takes to build an EV1. There are presently 54 hourly craftspeople at work building the cars (yes, &quot;craftsman&quot; is the job designation; further classification is based on whether they are in materials, production, or quality). They are working one shift. Should there be a strong demand for the car, a second one can be added. And she admits that the production layout is such that capacity can be added in short order. Bob Purcell says that in terms of direct assembly hours, the EV1 &quot;sets a new standard.&quot;

<P>What is the EV1? It is a car. Two doors. Two seats. Four wheels. It is fast: 0 to 60 mph in under 9 seconds. Like 
a Saturn or a Corvette, it has plastic body panels. In its case, the front and rear fascias, front fenders and rear 
quarters are reinforced reaction injection molded (RIM) polyurethane; the doors, roof, hood, and decklid are 
fiberglass-reinforced low-density sheet molding compound (SMC). There are other panels on the EV1 that are unlike those found on other production vehicles: structural reaction-injection-molded (SRIM) polyurethane bellypans. Put these components together, along with specially-developed Michelin tires and the glass, and the result is an aerodynamically slippery shape: 0.19 drag coefficient, which makes the EV1 the most aerodynamic production vehicle being made.

<P>When you get to the frame, things become somewhat different: it is an all-aluminum space frame that is more 
like something from the aerospace industry than the auto industry. The assembled frame (165 parts are put together 
with rivets, welds and adhesives) weighs 290 lbs--just 10% of the curb weight, which is 2,970 lbs.

<P>The real difference, of course, is that there is no internal combustion engine. The drive unit, which contains a 
two-stage gear reduction and differential, weighs 150 lbs., which is less than a third of the weight of a four-cylinder 
engine and transaxle, and provides 137 hp. The real weight of the vehicle is represented by the T-shaped pack of 26 Delco VRLA (valve-regulated, lead-acid) batteries that provide the energy to move the machine. Each battery weighs 41.4 lbs. Combine the batteries and all of the necessary mounting and wiring components, and the total package weighs 1,175 lbs.

<P>So once the whole thing is ready to go, it will go from 70 to 90 miles (depending on driving conditions) on a charge. Recharging is done through an inductive system developed and manufactured by Delco Electronics. The Magne-Charge system is the first-ever electric vehicle charger to be UL listed by Underwriters Laboratories; SAE adopted J1773, the Recommended Practice for EV Inductive Charge Coupling, in January 1995, which this system conforms to. There are two types of chargers. One is a 6.6-kW, 220-volt module (for installations in garages and in public places) that provides a full charge in about three hours. There is a 1.2-kW, 120-volt unit that's a standard feature in the truck of the EV1; it can be plugged into an ordinary household outlet and will recharge the vehicle in 12 to 14 hours.

<P>But what about the claim that the EV1, whether or not it is a success, will change the way cars are built? Consider: This was designed and engineered to be a super-efficient vehicle. Bob Purcell thinks that a good part of the 
return-on-investment that GM will realize from the EV1 program will be found through what the engineers have done to 
achieve the efficiency in terms of componentry: &quot;The components represent an opportunity to improve the efficiency of <I>any</I> class of vehicle that GM makes--internal combustion engine vehicles, too.&quot;

<P>For example, consider the instrument panel (IP). Because the objective is to have a vehicle with longevity, instead of using a vinyl over a foam, which is a common practice, the EV1's IP and center console are two fiberglass reinforced urethane moldings covered with a sprayed urethane skin. There are several ramifications. One is that the longevity 
factor is addressed: the engineers reckon that the IP will handle sun loads for 10 years without problem (and given 
that the initial markets are in Arizona and California, that is not a trivial consideration). The IP has a mass that's 50% 
less than that of comparable vehicles. The moldings are self-supporting, which means that extra trim plates and attachments aren't necessary, which means fewer parts are required for assembly, and squeaks and rattles are consequently minimized.

<P>The steering wheel frame is a single magnesium diecasting rather than a steel fabrication, which is the norm. 
&quot;This is a smart way to use premium materials,&quot; Michael W. Liedtke, chief engineer, Vehicle Systems, GM 
Advanced Technology Vehicles, points out: the part consolidation is an advantage, as is the fact that magnesium has a mass one third lighter than steel. Magnesium is also used for the bucket seat base; extruded aluminum tubing is used for the upper seat frame. Add the foam and the one-piece seat cover (which means no seams) and a bucket seat weighs 23 
lbs., or about 20% less than a conventional seat.

<P>The 14 &#215; 4.5-in. aluminum wheels are made for GM with a squeeze casting process, which eliminates porosity. 
At 8.5 lbs. each, these wheels are said to be the lightest used on any product vehicle. Squeeze casting is also used for 
the steering knuckles. Working with aluminum casting became both an art and science: EV1 development resulted in 
23 patents, three of which are related to aluminum casting.

<P>All of these things--and more--have the applicability to other types of vehicles.

<H2>
Making It Happen
</H2>
<P>The EV1 isn't assembled like most production vehicles. Consider the fact that the vehicle's structure is a 
weld-bonded aluminum space frame. Which means there is a combination of structural adhesives (nearly 500 ft of epoxy per vehicle) and welds (approximately 2,000) employed to put the various components together. (There are also 150 structural rivets employed in areas where there is restricted access or the attachment of dissimilar materials: like the cast shock tower to the sheet space frame component.) Weight was a critical consideration. In fact, Liedtke says they were 
&quot;fanatical&quot; about weight during the development to the extent that all components were measured in grams. Since the goal was to make things as light as possible, not only was aluminum selected as the material, but light component forms were developed. For example, in addition to stamped aluminum components (e.g., a single-piece door ring), which are fairly common in aluminum based vehicles (e.g., the Acura NSX), extrusions and foldings are also employed on the EV1. 
For example, the windshield header is an extrusion that's run through an NC bender in order to obtain the required curvature. Liedtke points out that had this component been stamped, there would have needed to be several more expensive dies involved in fabrication, as well as two pieces to process rather than a single extrusion. An example of a folded, or press brake-processed part, is the battery tunnel that runs down the center of the vehicle.

<P>Maureen Midgley points out that the extrusions and foldings are less expensive to produce than stampings, particularly as regards the cost of tooling. But welding these aluminum components can be somewhat more tricky, especially as there is the additional factor of the epoxy sandwiched between two pieces of aluminum. The welding 
is performed with manual spot guns. To help assure weld quality, a touch-sensing system was developed to assure 
that the electrodes are properly seated before welding commences. This system, in addition to providing better 
process control, also has an operator safety-related benefit by helping assure the appropriate fitup. Midgley says that GM 
engineers are working with engineers from Alcan Rolled Products Co., the supplier of the aluminum for the frame, 
to develop an artificial intelligence system for weld process characterization.

<P>The size of the weld guns is bigger than that which are the norm. One reason is because whereas spot welding 
guns on conventional assembly lines do a few welds, the guns being used at EV1 Manufacturing within the Lansing 
Craft Centre are being manually employed by people who are doing a whole lot of welds per operation.

<P>Although the vehicle is ultrahigh tech, the manufacturing operation in many ways blends the latest with the 
most-traditional of manufacturing processes. &quot;Whereas most assembly plants have gone automated, we're really a 
manual operation,&quot; Midgley says. The setup is such that there are seven stations in the body shop and eight stations in general assembly. As a result, individual workers perform numerous tasks while a vehicle is in station. Midgley estimates that compared to what a worker does in a conventional assembly plant, the craftspeople in Lansing have 50 times more job content. She knows a little something about this first-hand, as she spends a day a month working in the plant. Whereas a car is usually in station at a typical assembly plant for 60 seconds or less, cycle time at EV1 Manufacturing is, in some cases, 45 minutes. These well-trained workers are represented by UAW Local 1618.

<P>One of the consequences of the fewer stations is a different build approach, which can have benefits on the 
vehicles' quality. For example, it is common for certain key fasteners in an auto assembly to be torqued to a 
computer-controlled level. That's the case for all of the EV1 fasteners. Midgley explains that since there are a multitude of jobs performed at each of the stations, far more than is the norm in an assembly plant, the cost of instrumented equipment is not prohibitive. Since an operator will be making some torque-controlled attachments and therefore has the instrumented torque gun at hand, using it for all applications becomes a sensible and effective use of the equipment.

<P>In order to assure that the operator doesn't have to be concerned with setting the appropriate torque for a 
given fastener, it is done automatically. Once the necessary tool is removed from the tooling fixture, the system 
recognizes which tool has been selected, then sets the appropriate torque curve for the fastener type.

<P>The 100,000-sq. ft. assembly plant was actually a mothballed facility. In June 1994, Bob Thompson was 
named director of manufacturing for EV1 and was given a target nine months later for prototypes off the line. There was no line. No plant. No workers. What had been the Buick Reatta Craft Centre became the EV1 Manufacturing 
operation. Thompson and his colleagues hit the target. Midgley says that during the development period, 
when equipment was being acquired, one initiative was taken by &quot;young, energetic manufacturing engineers.&quot; They went searching through various &quot;basements&quot; of GM plants to find unused but usable tools that could be acquired for the EV1. &quot;We've got a Cadillac side frame tool, and a large trunnion base from another plant and...&quot; Midgley comments.

<P>Which is not to say that there isn't contemporary technology being used, like the weld guns and the torque guns. Like other auto assembly plants, there is robotic technology. Unlike other auto assembly plants there is only one robot. This robot, developed by GM North American Operations Engineering, is used for glass sealant application. In most robotic sealant application arrangements, the robot manipulates the sealant application equipment through space while the glass is stationary. In the 
EV1 setup, the robot manipulates the glass through space while the sealant application equipment is stationary. According to Midgley, who is a chemical engineer and who spent 15 years in painting operations (Saturn, Reatta, GM Wentzville), this arrangement provides the ability to use a better sealing material because there isn't a need to push the sealant through tubing as far as is necessary when 
the sealant application nozzle is on a robot arm, several feet away from the container.

<P>One other interesting fact about the plant. Station five in general assembly is where the glass is installed. There are also fluid fill and power up. For the remaining stations, there is no need for any kind of conveyance: no moveable line; no AGVs. The car is started up and is driven to the following stations. There are no exhaust or flammable fuels to worry about.

<H2>
Where Can You Buy an EV1?
</H2>
<P>You can't buy one. They will be available only on three-year leases. Saturn retail facilities in the greater Los Angeles, San Diego, Phoenix, and Tucson metro areas will be handling the vehicles. Why in those places? The EV1 works best in places that are flat and warm. (The vehicle will be valued in the mid-$30s.)

<P>But realize that the GM Advanced Technology Vehicles 
operations are in Troy, Michigan, where it is flat and cold. Within 10 years, GM engineers anticipate, they'll have cold-temperature electric vehicles.
