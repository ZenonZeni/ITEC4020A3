<h3><a name="definition">I. Definition</a></h3><p>
     Industrial hemp means those parts of the Cannabis sativa
plant which contain less than 1.00% tetrahydrocannabinols (THC).
THC is the psychoactive chemical found in Cannabis sativa.
Industrial hemp is not to be confused with marijuana.  Marijuana
comes from the flowers of the Cannabis sativa plant and contains
more than 1.00% THC.<a href="#1">1</a>  Industrial hemp has no psychoactive
properties.
<p>

     Industrial hemp can be grown as a profitable, high-quality
fiber crop without producing marijuana. Registered seed varieties
that produce hemp containing less than 0.3% THC even in the
flowers are available throughout Europe.<a href="#2">2</a> Farmers in the European
Community have been growing hemp for over 20 years without any
problems related to marijuana.<a href="#3">3</a>
<p>


<h3><a name="abroad">II.  Hemp Production in Other Countries</a></h3><p>
     Industrial hemp is grown as a profitable fiber crop in many
countries.<a href="#4">4</a> Industrial hemp crops have been subsidized in the
European Community since before 1988.<a href="#5">5</a>  In 1993, England began to
produce hemp for fiber.<a href="#6">6</a>  In 1994, Canada harvested its first
crop of industrial hemp after more than 50 years of prohibition.<a href="#7">7</a>
The re-emerging world hemp industry is growing steadily, and
farmers are excited and enthusiastic about the potential of hemp
crops.
<p>

<h3><a name="us">III. Hemp Production in the United States</a></h3><p>
     Hemp has been valued throughout this country's history as an
important raw material.  Until the late 1800s, almost all of our
cloth was made from hemp, and virtually all of our paper was made
from hemp rags.<a href="#8">8</a>  From 1631 to the early 1800s, hemp was such a
valued commodity that it was considered legal tender (money).<a href="#9">9</a>
Regions of Kentucky and Wisconsin were among the largest hemp
producers.<a href="#10">10</a>
<p>
     Hemp production seemed destined to increase dramatically in
the 1930s, when an invention called the decorticator began
getting wide attention.<a href="#11">11</a> The decorticator strips the hemp fiber
from the stalk. This had been the most labor-intensive and
expensive part of producing hemp.<a href="#12">12</a>  The decorticator was to hemp
what the cotton gin was to cotton.  The invention prompted a 1937
Popular Mechanics magazine to call hemp the "New Billion Dollar
Crop"<a href="#13">13</a> and Mechanical Engineering magazine to call it "The Most
Desirable Crop That Can Be Grown."<a href="#14">14</a>
<p>
     However, the 1937 Marijuana Tax Act dealt a fatal blow to
the promising hemp fiber industry.  The Act established a
prohibitive tax on hemp manufacturers and distributors as well as
on hemp transactions.<a href="#15">15</a>  It was modeled after a similar tax that
was enacted to prohibit machine guns.  The transfer tax of
$1.00/ounce effectively ended all hemp production in the United
States by making commerce in hemp prohibitively expensive.
<p>
     Restrictions on hemp production were eased briefly in the
United States during World War II when Japan invaded the
Philippines, cutting off the supply of abaca (Manila hemp).<a href="#16">16</a>
The U.S. Navy desperately needed a domestic supply of hemp to
provide the lines and rigging for its fleet.  The U.S. Department
of Agriculture encouraged farmers to produce hemp for the war
effort by distributing a film called "Hemp for Victory!".<a href="#17">17</a>
<p>
     After World War II, the hemp industry declined as the
federal government again began to restrict hemp production.<a href="#18">18</a>
Farmers continued to produce hemp on a limited scale until the
1950s.<a href="#19">19</a>  However, legislation eventually came to treat
industrial hemp crops as marijuana (drug) crops, and hemp fiber
production was no longer promoted.
<p>
     Currently, hemp production is treated as a felony in the
United States because it is assumed that all hemp crops will
produce marijuana. With the advent of industrial hemp and low-THC
seed varieties, this is no longer true. Hemp can now be grown as
a profitable fiber crop in the United States with absolutely no
danger of increasing marijuana use.
<p>

<h3><a name="raw-product">IV.  Raw Materials and Products from Hemp</a></h3><p>
     Hemp consists of three principal raw materials:  fiber,
seeds, and hurds.  Hemp is principally grown for the bast fiber
it produces from its stalk.  However, the seeds and hurds are
also important economically.
<p>
<ol><li><h4><a name="raw-product.1">Fiber:</a></h4><p>
  The hemp stalk is composed of 20% fiber.<a href="#20">20</a>  Hemp is the
strongest natural fiber in the world.<a href="#21">21</a>  It is valued for its
strength and durability when used for textiles, cordage, and
paper.
<p>
<ul><li>  Textiles:  The fiber can be made into any type of cloth, from
     the finest linen to the coarsest canvas.<a href="#22">22</a> The word canvas
     comes from the Arabic word for hemp.<a href="#23">23</a>  Cloth made from hemp
     fiber is stronger, warmer, more durable, more absorbent, and
     softer than cotton.<a href="#24">24</a><p>
  <li>Cordage:  Hemp rope has been valued throughout history for its
     superior strength and  resistance to deterioration in salt
     or fresh water.<a href="#25">25</a><p>
 <li> Paper: Paper made from hemp is known as the "archivist's
     perfect paper" because it lasts much longer than tree pulp
     paper and does not harden, crack, yellow, or crumble with
     age.<a href="#26">26</a>  Hemp  fiber can be used to make every grade of
     paper.<a href="#27">27</a><p>
</ul>
<li><h4><a name="raw-product.2">Hurds:</a></h4><p>
  The hemp stalk is composed of 80% hurds.<a href="#28">28</a>  The hurds are the
woody inner portion of the hemp stalk that are separated from the
hemp fiber.<a href="#29">29</a> The hurds are 50% - 77% cellulose,<a href="#30">30</a>  which makes
them ideal for use in paper and plastic products.
<p>
<ul><li>  Paper:  One acre of hemp hurds can make as much pulp for paper
     as four acres of trees.<a href="#31">31</a>   Hemp paper can be whitened
     without producing dioxins and lasts much longer than paper
     made from trees.<a href="#32">32</a><p>
<li>  Particle Board:  Hemp hurds can be pressed and injected with
     phenolic resin to make a particle board that is resistant to
     fire and water.<a href="#33">33</a>  The board also makes a good insulation
     and thermal barrier.<a href="#34">34</a><p>
 <li> Plastic:  Plastics were first made from plant cellulose (i.e.,
     cellophane, celluloid).<a href="#35">35</a>  The  hemp hurd is one of the
     richest sources of plant cellulose,<a href="#36">36</a> a building block of
     modern industry.  Plastics made from hemp instead of
     petroleum would be biodegradable.<a href="#37">37</a><p>
 <li> Animal Bedding:  The hurds make an excellent animal bedding
     because they absorb more liquid and compost faster than wood
     shavings.<a href="#38">38</a><p>
</ul>
<li><h4><a name="raw-product.3">Seed:</a></h4><p>
  The hemp seed is composed of two raw materials: the seed oil
and the seed cake.<p>

<h5>Seed Oil:</h5>  The hemp seed is composed of 30% oil.<a href="#39">39</a>
<p>
 <ul><li> Food:  Hemp seed oil contains over 70% cholesterol-fighting
     essential fatty acids, the highest of any seed oil.<a href="#40">40</a><p>
 <li> Fuel:  Hemp seed oil can be chemically combined easily with
     15% methanol to provide a  premium diesel fuel substitute.<a href="#41">41</a><p>
     This hemp bio-diesel fuel burns 70% cleaner than petroleum
     diesel in soot and particulate pollution.<a href="#42">42</a><p>
<li>  Paints and varnishes:  Hemp seed oil dries quickly and leaves
     a thin elastic film.<a href="#43">43</a><p>
<li>  Lubricant:  Hemp seed oil makes an ideal all-purpose
     lubricant.<a href="#44">44</a><p>
</ul>
<h5>Seed Cake:</h5>  The seed cake is the solid part of the seeds that
remains after the oil is expelled.<p>
<ul>
<li>  Food:  Hemp seed cake makes a nutritional, high-protein
     supplement to wheat flour.  It contains 25% protein.<a href="#45">45</a>
</ul><p>
<h5>Whole Seed:</h5>  The whole hemp seed contains 20% high-quality
digestible complete protein.<a href="#46">46</a>
<p>
 <ul><li> Food: The hemp seed can be eaten as a nutritious snack,  like
     sunflower seeds.<p>
 <li> Bird Feed:  Birds like hemp seed because of its nourishing,
     oily content.<a href="#47">47</a><p>
</ul>
</ol>

<h3><a name="econ">V.  Economics of Hemp Production</a></h3><p>
<p>
A hemp crop could be sold for at least $860 per acre.  Since a
  hemp crop produces three different raw materials each year,
  the total value of hemp far exceeds other crops grown for a
  single material.<p>
The chart below compares yields of hemp and comparable crops.
  Since there are currently no domestic hemp crops being sold in
  the United States, the prices for comparable crops were used
  to estimate the prices for domestic hemp fiber, hurds, and
  seed.<p>
Hemp fiber is compared to cotton for textile production. Hemp
  hurds are compared to wood chip prices and Douglas fir yield
  for paper production.  Hemp seed is compared to soybeans for
  oil seed production.<p>
Production costs were not factored into this estimate, although
  hemp would be considerably less expensive to produce than
  cotton (see Section VI -- Hemp Cultivation).<p>

     * The hemp yields are based on historical and limited
current figures.  These are conservative estimates; the actual
yields will probably be 2 to 3 times higher.  Hemp prohibition
has stifled contemporary research in the field of hemp
production.

<h3><a name="cultivation">VI.  Hemp Cultivation</a></h3><p>
Hemp is easy to grow.<a href="#50">50</a> Hemp is an annual herbaceous crop that
  grows from 5 to 16 feet tall in a season of four months.<a href="#51">51</a>  It
  will grow in all 50 states.<a href="#52">52</a>  It is a good rotation crop.<a href="#53">53</a>
  Hemp has long roots that penetrate and break the soil to leave
  it in perfect condition for the next crop.<a href="#54">54</a><p>
Production costs for hemp would be considerably lower than
  cotton's. Herbicides are not needed because fiber hemp is sown
  thickly and chokes out competing weeds.<a href="#55">55</a> Pesticide use is
  limited because hemp has few insect enemies.<a href="#56">56</a><p>

<h3><a name="market">VII. Current Hemp Market in the United States</a></h3><p>
Hundreds of entrepreneurs are now selling imported hemp products.
  However, they are stifled by high prices and uncertain
  availability since all of the hemp is imported from overseas.
  Demand for hemp products in the U.S. is enormous. Hemp
  clothing and accessories have become a fashion trend.<a href="#57">57</a> Tree-
  free hemp paper is also in demand.<a href="#58">58</a> The market has a
  potential of as much as $15 to $30 billion a year.<a href="#59">59</a>
<p>

<h3><a name="jobs">VIII.  Potential for New Jobs</a></h3><p>
Hemp production in Colorado would create new farming
  opportunities and make Colorado farmers competitive in the
  global market against countries that already grow hemp for
  fiber. It would also create thousands of processing and
  manufacturing jobs in such industries as textiles, plastics,
  pulp paper, energy, timber, construction, and food.  The
  retail market for tree-free paper and building materials, for
  biodegradable plastics, for soft and durable natural clothing,
  and for other hemp products has huge potential.
<p>

<h3><a name="benefits">IX.  Benefits of Hemp Production</a></h3><p>
Hemp will be a profitable crop for farmers because of the volume
  of hemp each crop produces, the number of different products
  that can be made from hemp, and the demand for hemp products.<p>
Not only is  hemp profitable, but it is a desirable crop to grow
  for other reasons.  Hemp is a renewable and sustainable
  resource.  It will help shift our economy away from dwindling
  non-renewable petroleum resources and help preserve our forest
  resources.<p>
Hemp is the strongest natural fiber.<a href="#60">60</a>  It has an extremely high
  cellulose content.<a href="#61">61</a>  It is biodegradable.<a href="#62">62</a>  It requires no
  herbicides to grow.<a href="#63">63</a>  It can be used to make paper, cloth,
  rope, particle board, plastic, paint, varnishes, linoleum,
  dynamite, fuel, food, and cardboard. It will create new jobs
  and make Colorado competitive with other countries.  It is the
  fiber of the 1990s.<p>
