<P>The following overview provides a first description of our work carried out in the area of Automation and Production Technology. For further information please reply to us the form at the end of this document or contact us <a href="../ecm/lage_e.htm">directly</a>.

<HR>
Based on the results achieved in the research areas of robot systems and sensorics, individual solutions for customers coming from such different areas as automobile industry, ship building or television assembly are realised. The spectre includes the integration of simple sensors into existing production lines for process optimisation up to the conception, realisation and commissioning of complete workcells. 
<p>The infrastructure of the European Centre for Mechatronics thereby provides adequate testing and demonstration floors not only ro present the know how of the institution to the industry but furthermore to organise training courses for personel working with the equipment.
