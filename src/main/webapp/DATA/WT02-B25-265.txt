<H2>DR. TORREY ON NAMI'S FUTURE</H2>

<hr>
Future efforts of NAMI should focus on working toward solutions
to three major problems that have created the current mental illness
mess:  ideological, economic, and legal.
<P>
The ideological problem arose from the fact that serious mental
illnesses--which are now known to be diseases of the brain in
exactly the same way as multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease,
and Alzheimer's disease are diseases of the brain--were subsumed
early in this century under the spectrum of mental health.  The
mental health spectrum includes a vast array of personal problems
and social issues with serious mental illnesses being merely one
end of the spectrum.  Mental health includes the problems of Woody
Allen, in psychotherapy for 33 years, and also the problems of
individuals who believe they have been abducted by space aliens
and are being treated by Harvard psychiatrist John Mack.
<P>
Mental illnesses have suffered significantly from being linked
to mental health.  Because of its interest in social reform, mental
health is strongly associated with liberal political causes and
carries with it heavy political baggage.  Seen most clearly during
the Nixon and Reagan administrations, such politicalization has
inevitably spilled over to mental illnesses.  In fact, there should
be no more political connotations to schizophrenia, severe depression,
or obsessive-compulsive disorder than there are to Parkinson's
disease.  These brain diseases affect individuals irrespective
of political beliefs.
<P>
Mental illnesses have also suffered from being linked to mental
health because treatment and research resources that were originally
allocated for mental illnesses have been usurped by mental health.
 This reallocation is why the Community Mental Health Center (CMHC)
program, originally conceived as an alternative treatment system
for individuals in state mental hospitals, has been such a failure.

<P>
Only about 25 of the 789 federally funded CMHCs have focused their
resources on individuals with serious mental illnesses.  Usurped
resources is also why the National Institute of Mental Health
(NIMH), which was originally funded to find the causes of serious
mental illnesses, has spent so much of its research resources
on social problems.
<P>
One part of the solution to the ideological problem is for NAMI
to withdraw from the mental health community and instead join
the mental illness community.  NAMI's natural allies are groups
associated with brain diseases, such as the Parkinson's Disease
Foundation, not with groups associated with personal or social
problems. 
<P>
Another part of the solution is for NAMI to take the lead in combining
the research resources of the National Institute of Mental Health
and the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke
into a new National Institute of Brain Research.  Research on
serious mental illnesses would progress much faster in such a
milieu.
<P>
The final part of the solution to the ideological problem is for
NAMI to support reimbursement parity for all brain diseases, but
not for all mental disorders.  Professional and treatment resources
that treat serious mental illnesses--including rehabilitation
service--should be reimbursed under private or government medical
insurance in exactly the same way it is for other brain diseases.

<P>
Reimbursement parity for all mental disorders, as recommended
by President Clinton's Mental Health Work Group, includes individuals
who have been abducted by space aliens (they qualify under the
diagnosis of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder, DSM-IV 309.81) and
is a bottomless pit.
<P>
The economic problem is not, as many people assume, that too little
money is available.  That is a problem in some states, but a bigger
problem in all states is cost-shifting.  Cost-shifting arose from
the increasingly large role that the federal government has played
in funding mental health services.  In 1963 state dollars constituted
approximately 96 percent of all dollars for support and services
for individuals with mental disorders. 
<P>
Then Medicaid, Medicare, SSI, SSDI, food stamps, HUD housing,
and other federal programs were implemented.  In 1993, state dollars
had decreased to approximately 40 percent of the total while federal
dollars had increased to at least 50 percent.  A huge federal
carrot had been created, and it encouraged states to shift their
costs to the federal government.
<P>
The consequences of cost-shifting have been inappropriate discharges
of patients from state mental hospitals with homelessness and
jailing for many; the forcing of readmissions of seriously mentally
ill patients to psychiatric wards in general hospitals, many of
which are neither adequately staffed for nor interested in this
patient population; the transinstitutionalization of thousands
of mentally ill individuals from state hospitals to nursing homes.
 
<P>
Many of which offer less care and are more restrictive than the
hospitals; disjointed and uncoordinated aftercare with revolving-door
readmissions because of reimbursement rules; the inappropriate
placement of thousands of emotionally disturbed children onto
SSI; and demands by states that parents relinquish custody of
their mentally ill children so that states can be federally reimbursed
for residential care.  In short, the federal fiscal carrot, not
patients' needs, is driving the system.
<P>
The solution to the economic problem is some type of single-source
funding.  This can be partially accomplished through Medicaid
waivers, but it ultimately will require federal block grants or
a Canadian-style health system.  Managed care is likely to make
things worse because it merely puts a lid on costs without addressing
the underlying economic problems.
<P>
Finally, the legal problem arose because we have trained too many
lawyers, but given them too little education.  Those who have
specialized in mental health law have made it difficult to get
seriously mentally ill individuals involuntarily hospitalized
and easy for these individuals to refuse medication. 
<P>
The lawyers have ignored evidence of brain diseases and the fact
that approximately half of seriously mentally ill individuals
have impaired insight or understanding of their need for treatment.
 Legal initiatives have also changed confidentiality statutes
so that families, who are the main care providers, often are not
given needed information about treatment.  In short, the legal
profession has successfully established and defended the right
of mentally ill individuals to remain ill.
<P>
Solutions to the legal problem involve educating state legislators,
judges, and lawyers about mental illness.  NAMI should take the
lead in establishing a right to get well and should encourage
state AMIs to challenge outmoded laws in the courts.   AMIs at
all levels should use the media to publicly confront mental health
lawyers with the frequently tragic consequences of their legal
actions.  Indeed, if it were known how many homeless mentally
ill individuals or premature deaths have been directly attributable
to the actions of civil liberties lawyers, they would be forced
to close their doors.
<P>
In summary, a better way for NAMI's future is aggressive advocacy
on ideological, economic, and legal issues that contribute to
the current mental illness mess.  Hope and patience alone are
not going to change the system.  We have been quiet for much too
long.

NOTE:  Dr. Torrey is a research psychiatrist and author of Surviving
Schizophrenia, among other books.  His newest book, The Mental
Illness Mess, will be published in 1996. 
<P>
NOTE:  In fact, there should be no more political connotations
to schizophrenia, severe depression, or obsessive-compulsive disorder
than there are to Parkinson's disease.  The lawyers have ignored
evidence of brain diseases and the fact that approximately half
of seriously mentally ill individuals have impaired insight or
understanding of their need for treatment.
