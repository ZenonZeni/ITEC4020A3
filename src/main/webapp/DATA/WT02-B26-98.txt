<P>
<B>Q. Why Rainforest herbs?</B>
<P>Imagine a chunk of real estate the size of the United States and you get an idea of the immensity of the Amazonian Rainforest.  Imagine a virgin tropical environment hundreds of miles from the nearest road or source of pollution.  Think of the Rainforest soil, rich in minerals and trace elements as the forest continuously recycles in a virtually closed ecosystem.  Imagine over 200,000 species of plants thriving in this tropical paradise.
</P>
<P>When you think of herbs, you've got to think of the Amazonian Rainforest as the mother of botanical resources.  Many plant, though known and used for centuries in the Rainforest, are just beginning to get the attention they deserve as the world begins to focus on the treasures of Amazonia.</P>
<B>Q.  How did the actual formulas evolve?</B>
<P>These formulas are based on traditional combinations that have been used by Indigenous Peoples for many years.  Each individual herb has a long history and has been used thousands of times.  For two years the Company worked exclusively with Health Care Practitioners, including medical doctors, chiropractors, acupuncture physicians, nutritionists and athletic trainers.  Through this experience and in cooperation with these professionals, we have refined and fine-tuned these formulas to address the nutritional needs facing the health conscious person living in today's modern environment.</P>
<B>Q.  How do I use the products?</B>
<P>Rainforest Bio-Energetics are food products in the form of a concentrated herbal beverage.  As an herbal drink, we suggest placing 10 to 30 drops into one ounce of pure water.  As there are many body types, some will use less and some will use more.  For children, elderly people, pregnant women or people who are dealing with serious health challenges, we suggest beginning with 3 to 5 drops.  Although we prefer mixing  the product in water, any liquid can be used such as your favorite juice, etc.  To make an excellent hot tea, simply use hot water.  By using Rainforest Bio-Energetics on a daily basis, you will find the way you most enjoy using the products.</P>
<B>Q.  How can I use the products together?</B>
<P>All the formulas are natural food products and are synergistic in nature.  We suggest that you use the products separately in the beginning so you may experience their nutritional benefits individually.  As you gain experience with the formulas you will know when is the best time to use each formula and which combinations you like best.
</P>
<B>Q.  Could I have a 'reaction' to the products?</B>
<P>It is unlikely that anyone would experience a 'reaction'.  However, as with any change in your diet that possibility exists.  If you do experience a reaction, it will be temporary in nature and we suggest discontinuing the product for three days.  Then resume, using one half as much.  As your body acclimates, you may increase to the level that is best for you.</P>
<B>Q.  How is the product manufactured?</B>
<P>Herbs used in the Company's Rainforest Bio-Energetics line are harvested in the sanctity of their natural environment.  Whenever possible, our raw materials are acquired directly from the custodians of the Rainforest--its Ingenous Peoples.  Phyto-sanitary certificates are secured to ensure the quality and purity of each plant.  The botanicals are packed and shipped to the United States with all appropriate documentation.  All shipments are cleared through U.S. Customs, Agriculture and FDA inspection.  Note:  All Rainforest Bio-Energetics herbs are imported, processed and sold as food and nutritional supplements.  No drug claims are made.  As such these products fall into the food (dietary supplement) category of the Food and Drug Administration regulations. </P>
<P>All formulas are processed under exacting standards.  After clearing the company's in house quality control checks, these materials are sent to a special FDA registered lab for further processing and bottling.  This lab is experienced in processing according to the ancient spagyic principles.  We consider this extraction method which emphasizes the 'whole' as simply the finest for preserving and potentizing the full natural energies of the botanicals.</P>
<P>Great care is taken at every step from harvesting in the Rainforest through extraction and bottling to safeguard the quality and ensure the integrity of our products.  A lot number and expiration date is printed on each label and batch samples are retained on deposit.  When processing and bottling is complete, the finished product is returned to our marketing and distribution center in Jupiter, Florida.</P>
<B>Q.  What is the spagyric extraction process?</B>
<P>The spagyric method of botanical preparation, sometimes referred to as "plant alchemy," is based on ancient bio-energetic principles.  The details are proprietary information (trade secret)
but the basic theory involves three important steps.</P>
<P>First the raw material is run in a solution and separated into its three active components.  The essential components are: an oil fraction, a clear volatile fraction and a mineral fraction.  Next, there are special techniques used to purify each of these fractions which enhances the bio-availability of the water soluble, oil soluble and mineral essentials.  The third step is recombining these three fractions into 'whole' again.  Because of the intricacies of this process of this process and the celestial cycles we adhere to, it takes approximately three weeks to manufacture and bottle one batch of product.  This process is an integral part of our objective to deliver to you the full and complete bio-energetic properties of the Rainforest. </P>
<B>Q.  Why are liquid supplements preferable to capsules?</B>
<P>Unlike capsules, the liquid supplement is available for absorption into your system without having to be digested first.  This bio-availability means that you receive the full strength benefit of all the herbal ingredients right away.</P>
<B>Q.  I see there is ethanol on the label.  Why is the alcohol used?</B>
<P>Ethanol is a natural alcohol distilled from grains.  It is in Rainforest Bio-Energetics for several reasons.  In our extraction process, it is the preferred solvent for breaking down the oil and tannin components of the botanicals.  Secondly, alcohol acts as a stabilizer holding all the active essential components of the botanicals in solution for an indefinite period of time.  Ethanol also serves as a carrier for the solution, further enhancing its bio-availability.
</P>
<P>For those who may be alcohol sensitive, we suggest enjoying your herbal beverage as a hot tea.  Placing the drops into warm or hot water will evaporate the alcohol.</P>
<B>Q.  What is used to color and flavor the products?</B>
<P>We do NOT add any colorings or flavorings to any of our products.  The color and flavor of the product is simply the full synergistic compliment of all its natural ingredients.</P>
<B>Q.  What is the shelf life of the products?</B>
<P>As the products are processed and labeled, the lot number and expiration date are printed on each label.  Generally speaking, from the time of manufacture to the expiration date is four years.</P>
<B>Q.  What does Bio-Energetics mean?</B>
<P>Bio-Energetics simply translated means life-energy.  Our name, Rainforest Bio-Energitics exemplifies our commitment to bring you the finest botanical life-energy from the greatest concentrated source of life energy on Earth---the Amazonian Rainforest.
</P>
<P>The Rainforest people have a conscious awareness of the life-enegy of the plants living in their environment.  Sometimes they sing to the plants to create a correct 'resonance' before harvesting.</P>
<B>Q.  What about product claims and the FDA?</B>
<P>As liquid herbal food concentrates, our products come under the Food (dietary supplement) category of the Food and Drug Administration Regulations.  The FDA monitors the import of our raw materials, inspects the manufacturing facility on a regular basis, and determines necessary labeling information.  Since the products are foods and not drugs, it is prohibited to make any claims that the products will treat or cure any disease.
</P>
<P>We believe most everyone can benefit from proper nutrition and diets that include organic minerals and trace elements.  We do not make therapeutic claims.  We are confident that people will have a positive experience with our products and all of our products come with a guarantee of satisfaction.
</P>
<B>Q.  How does using plants from the Rainforest help to preserve the Rainforest?</B>
<P>We advocate the preservation of the Rainforest by promoting the use of sustainable and renewable botanical resources.  By creating an income stream for the herbs, we make the Rainforest more valuable alive than dead (clearcut).</P>
<P>The Indigenous People have an intimate understanding of their ecosystems and have responded very favorably to our approach.  This provides a morally and ecolologically balanced framework to support their need for currency and our need for the mineral rich botanicals of the Rainforest.  We believe this type of exchange, born of correct intent, spawns a greater sharing and understanding between cultures.  Building these channels of trust and mutual respect with a common goal of individual and planetary health is an ongoing endeavor and our corporate mission.</P>
<P>In addition to the way we conduct our business securing our raw materials, we return 1% of all net sales to the Rainforests through our Rainforest Rescue Fund.  Each distributor in the Rainforest Bio-Energetics network can feel satisfaction knowing that a part of each purchase goes to preserve our planet's natural resources.</P>
<P>All of our literature and correspondence is printed on recycled paper.  We use soy-based ink and encourage recycling all bottles and packaging material.</P>
