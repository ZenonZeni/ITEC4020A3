&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Cari showed an early penchant for expedition travel when, in her mid-twenties, she left her home in eastern Washington for the Shumagin Islands in Alaska.  There, she lived in an Aleut community of 500 people and worked for the fishing industry for five years.  Cari’s adventurous spirit thrived on her experience in the wilderness.  Also, as winters are typically the industry’s off season, she was able to devote several weeks each year to globetrotting - exploring in Jamaica, Australia, New Zealand, Tahiti, Fiji and Costa Rica.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<IMG SRC="cbcanoe.gif" ALT="cbcanoe.gif" ALIGN="RIGHT" WIDTH=270 HEIGHT=170 BORDER=2>Cari’s job responsibilities required that she spend several months a year in Seattle, so when she decided to move from fishing to real estate she had already put down some significant roots in this city.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As it turned out, Cari and Zegrahm have a mutual friend.  While this friend said to Cari: "You should really give Zegrahm a call, they are right up your alley!"; she said to us: "If you ever need a hard working team player with a lot of spirit and a great sense of humor, talk to Cari Barron."  We met Cari just at the time we were trying to decide on a Program Manager for our new 1995 South Pacific voyages.  We were immediately impressed with her attitude and poise and, when we learned of her experience in the South Pacific, decided that she would be a great addition to our team.  Cari joined us enthusiastically, and even signed up for a scuba diving course in preparation for her familiarization trip to Polynesia.  However, a staff change in the fall of 1994 required that we quickly find a replacement Program Manager for our upcoming Botswana expeditions.  It did not take long to convince Cari to join a Botswana expedition instead.  Her resulting love for southern Africa, and devotion to these programs, and her has made her quite an African expert.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In addition to her African responsibilities, Cari assists with our Galapagos expeditions, and combined a trip to the "enchanted islands" in 1995 with a vacation/research trip to Peru, where her experience and research has come in handy in the planning of our 1997 Peru expeditions.  In 1997, Cari will add another Program Manager “hat” to her collection, when she operates our India: Realm of the Tiger expeditions.  In preparation, she departs in a few weeks for a familiarization trip to that country.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Like so many of us at Zegrahm, Cari is an outdoors enthusiast, and enjoys hiking, camping and fishing.  She has a new interest in cross country skiing, which she credits to Zegrahm’s annual winter ski retreat.  Another hobby is collecting antiques.  A few months ago, Cari turned this interest into a small business when she and two friends decided to start a small retail shop.  As Cari says, "it was a way that I could continue to peruse estate sales and poke into small antique shops without having to buy a bigger apartment for my purchases !"<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As you can imagine, this all keeps Cari rather busy.  While her scuba lessons are still on hold, there is no doubt in Cari’s mind that one of these days she will return to the South Pacific.<BR>
