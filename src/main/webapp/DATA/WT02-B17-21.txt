<strong>System Comparison of Hydrogen with Other Alternative Fuels<br>

in Terms of EPAct Requirements;<br>

<P>

The analysis of vehicle performance with various alternative fuels

has been completed.  The direct hydrogen fuel cell is the most

efficient alternative (close to 70 mpg).  The amount of fuel,

as well as the amount and type of primary energy and high-quality

energy feedback, has been calculated for each of the analyzed

pathways.  A need for a common denominator became obvious.  Potential

candidates are money, eMergy, or land area.  Land area has been

estimated for each of the analyzed pathways.  Surprisingly, 
PV-electrolysis-hydrogen

has been found to be the least land-area-intensive of all the

pathways based on renewable energy sources.
