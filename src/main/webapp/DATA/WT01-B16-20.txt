<H3><A NAME="A1"><B>L.1 FAR 52.215-16 Contract Award (OCT 1995)
DEVIATION</B></A></H3>
<P><OL><OL><LI TYPE=A VALUE=1>The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) reserves the
right to make one or more award resulting from this Solicitation to the responsible Offerors
whose Offer(s) conforming to the Solicitation will be most advantageous to the DOE.
<P><LI TYPE=A VALUE=2>DOE may: 1) reject any or all Offers if such action is in the public
interest; 2) accept other than the lowest Offer; and 3) waive informalities and minor irregularities
in Offers received.
<P><LI TYPE=A VALUE=3>DOE may award a Contract on the basis of initial Offers received,
without discussions. Therefore, each initial Offer should contain the Offeror's best terms.
<P><LI TYPE=A VALUE=4>A written award or acceptance of Offer mailed or otherwise
furnished to the successful Offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the Offer shall
result in a binding Contract without further action by either party. Before the Offer's specified
expiration time, DOE may accept an Offer, whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt,
unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. Negotiations conducted after
receipt of an Offer do not constitute a rejection or counter offer by DOE.
<P><LI TYPE=A VALUE=5>If the resulting Contract contains a clause providing for price
reduction for defective cost or pricing data, the Contract price will be subject to reduction if cost
or pricing data furnished are incomplete, inaccurate, or not current.
<P><LI TYPE=A VALUE=6>DOE may determine that an Offer is unacceptable if the prices
proposed are materially unbalanced between line items or sub-line items. An Offer is materially
unbalanced when it is based on prices significantly less than cost for some work and prices which
are significantly overstated in relation to cost for other work, and if there is a reasonable doubt
that the Offer will result in the lowest overall cost to DOE, even though it may be the low
evaluated Offer; or, it is so unbalanced as to be tantamount to allowing an advance payment.
<P><LI TYPE=A VALUE=7>DOE may disclose the following information in post-award
debriefings to Offeror(s):
<P><OL><LI VALUE=1>Overall evaluated price and technical rating of the successful Offeror;
<P><LI VALUE=2>Overall ranking of all Offerors, when any ranking was developed by DOE
during source selection;
<P><LI VALUE=3>Summary of the rationale for award; and
<P><LI VALUE=4>For acquisition of commercial end items, the make and model of the item to
be delivered by the successful Offeror.
<P></OL></OL></OL>

<P>The Government contemplates award of firm-fixed price contracts resulting
from this solicitation.

<P> It is anticipated that there may be one or more awards resulting from this RFP, each initially
covering all four regions.

Quotations</B></A></H3>
<P> Unnecessarily elaborate brochures or other presentations beyond those sufficient to present a
complete and effective response to this Solicitation are not desired and may be construed as an
indication of the offeror's or quoter's lack of cost consciousness. Elaborate art work, expensive
paper and bindings, and expensive visual and other presentation aids are neither necessary nor
wanted.

by the Government after receipt at the Government installation.
<P><LI TYPE=A VALUE=4>The only acceptable evidence to establish the date of mailing of a
late proposal or modification sent either by U.S. Postal Service registered or certified mail is the
U.S. or Canadian Postal Service postmark both on the envelope or wrapper and on the original

proposal, quotation, or modification shall be processed as if mailed late. &quot;Postmark&quot;
means a printed, stamped, or otherwise placed impression (exclusive of a postage meter machine
impression) that is readily identifiable without further action as having been supplied and affixed
by employees of the U.S. or Canadian Postal Service on the date of mailing. Therefore, offerors

wrapper and on the original receipt from the U.S. Postal Service. &quot;Postmark&quot; has the

hand cancellation bull's eye postmark on both the receipt and the envelope or wrapper.
<P><LI TYPE=A VALUE=7>Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this provision, a late
modification of an otherwise successful proposal that makes its terms more favorable to the

(including mailgram) received at any time before award. If the Solicitation authorizes facsimile
proposals, proposals may be withdrawn via facsimile received at any time before award, subject

may be withdrawn in person by an offeror or an authorized representative, if the representative's
identity is made known and the representative signs a receipt for the proposal before award.

Government processes so that technical proposals cannot be received at the office designated for
receipt of technical proposals by the exact time specified in the Solicitation, and urgent
Government requirements preclude amendment of the Solicitation or other notice of an extension
of the closing date, the time specified for receipt of technical proposals will be deemed to be

Representation (APR 1984)</B></A></H3>
<P> The Section of this Solicitation which describes the work to be performed also sets forth
DOE's known requirements for technical data. The <I>Additional Technical Data
Requirements</I> Clause, if included in this Solicitation, provides DOE with the option to order
additional technical data, the requirements for which are not known at the time of contracting.
There is, however, a built-in limitation on the kind of technical data that may be required. This
limitation provides that the Contractor may withhold delivery of proprietary data. Accordingly, it
is necessary that the Offeror's proposal state that the work to be performed and the known
requirements for technical data as set forth in the Solicitation have been reviewed, and either
state that, to the best of its knowledge, no data will be withheld, or submit a list identifying the
proprietary data which, to the best of its knowledge, will likely be used in the Contract
performance and will be withheld.
