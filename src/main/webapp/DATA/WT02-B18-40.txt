<STRONG>Rapid Assessment Program (RAP)</STRONG>
<P>
Conservation International's Rapid Assessment Program (RAP) was launched in 1987 to address the lack of scientific knowledge of Latin America's quickly disappearing tropical rain forests.  RAP was designed to be fast and inexpensive way to accurately define conservation priorities.  
<P>
RAP works by assembling teams of experienced, internationally recognized field biologists who work closely with host-country scientists to generate fast, on-the-ground assessments of areas suspected to be important biodiversity conservation sites.  To assess its biological importance, team members examine the area's biological diversity, degree of endemism, ecological uniqueness, and risk of extinction.  As a conservation tool, RAP precedes - but does not preclude - long-term scientific study.

<LI>The Conservation Biology Department contributed funds from the Parker-Gentry Memorial
Fund toward the creation of Bilsa Reserve, a new biological reserve and station in Ecuador
managed by the local organization Fundac&iacute;on Jatun Sacha.
<P>
<LI>A RAP expedition to the dry forest in eastern Bolivia was recorded on film by Kurtis

<P>
<LI>The first ever <A HREF="aquarap.htm">Aqua RAP</A> expedition  took  place in September, 1996 near Cobija, Bolivia.  An International RAP Team with scientists from Bolivia, Peru, Brazil and the United States spent three weeks surveying the systems of the Tahuamanu and Manuripi rivers.
