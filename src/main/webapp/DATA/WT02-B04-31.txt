<BR>
                                          COUNSEL FOR ALA PLAINTIFFS<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
       Amici National Law Center for Children and Families, et al. (&quot;NLCCF&quot;)
avowedly<BR>
played a &quot;central role in the development and passage&quot; of the
Communications Decency Act<BR>
(&quot;CDA&quot;).  NLCCF Mot. for Leave to File at II.  It is particularly
significant, therefore, that<BR>
amici effectively concede that the challenged provisions are unconstitutional
as written, and<BR>
devote much of their 83-page amicus brief to urging the Court to construct
a much different<BR>
statute.  Their arguments are unpersuasive.<BR>
       1.     Statutory Reconstruction.   Like the Government, amici urge
the Court to<BR>
interpret the CDA to focus narrowly (if not exclusively) on &quot;pornography.&quot;
 See, e.g., NLCCF<BR>
Br. at 4, 21, 22, 39, 53, 83.  As we have shown, this is not a plausible
reading of the CDA's<BR>
text and legislative history.[1]  Indeed, amici implicitly acknowledge that
the CDA as written<BR>
applies to much more than &quot;pornography,&quot; and that as written it
would suppress and chill<BR>
a great deal of constitutionally protected speech, for amici urge this Court
to engage in &quot;hard<BR>
construction work&quot; to save the CDA.  NLCCF Br. at 23; see id. at 18
(observing that<BR>
&quot;statutory construction can sometimes take on a substantial scope&quot;).[2]<BR>
       The &quot;hard construction work&quot; amici ask this Court to perform
is not the work of<BR>
interpreting a statute; it is &quot;constructing&quot; a new regulatory
regime quite different from the<BR>
one Congress enacted.  For example, although Congress considered and rejected
a &quot;harmful<BR>
to minors&quot; standard, see Conf. Rep. at 189, some amici now ask the
court to confine the<BR>
CDA to material that is &quot;harmful for minors,&quot; see, e.g., NLCCF
Br. at 16; but cf. id. at 73<BR>
at 73 (amicus Morality in Media disavowing that standard).  And amici spend
many pages<BR>
arguing (unsuccessfully) that the CDA should be understood to contain an
implicit &quot;prurient<BR>
appeal&quot; element and an implicit &quot;serious value&quot; exemption
-- elements clearly not part of the<BR>
FCC standard Congress adopted.  See ALCU Resp. to NLCCF at 6-8 (discussing
FCC<BR>
precedent on which amici rely). <BR>
       Amici contend that courts have engaged in similarly ambitious &quot;construction
work.&quot;<BR>
See NLCCF Br. at 9-10, 18-20, but the cases they cite only reaffirm the
impossibility of a<BR>
&quot;saving construction&quot; here.  In each of those cases, there was
a principled way to draw a line<BR>
between the portion of the statute that was invalid and the portion that
could be &quot;saved&quot; --<BR>
whether by reference to the statutory text itself or to rules of constitutional
law established<BR>
in prior judicial decisions, or both.   Thus, in Hamling v. United States,
418 U.S. 87 (1974),<BR>
the Court construed a federal prohibition against mailing &quot;obscene,
lewd, lascivious, indecent,<BR>
filthy, or vile&quot; matter narrowly to comport with the obscenity test
laid down in Miller v.<BR>
California, 413 U.S. 15 (1973).  See also United States v. 12 200-ft. Reels
of Film, 413 U.S.<BR>
123, 130 n.7 (1973).  Similarly, in United States v. 37 Photographs, 402
U.S. 363 (1971), the<BR>
Court construed a statute authorizing forfeiture of obscene materials to
include procedural<BR>
safeguards (time limits for access to judicial review) articulated in Freedman
v. Maryland,<BR>
380 U.S. 51 (1965) -- and did so only after concluding that the Freedman
time limits were<BR>
fully consistent with congressional intent and would not embroil the Court
in &quot;issues of policy<BR>
appropriately left to the Congress.&quot; 37 Photographs, 402 U.S. at 371-72.
 And in Brockett<BR>
v. Spokane Arcades, Inc., 472 U.S. 491 (1985), the Court excised a single
overreaching word -<BR>
- &quot;lust&quot; -- from an obscenity statute that was otherwise completely
consistent with Miller. <BR>
See id. at 505-06.<BR>
       Amici do not advocate the only &quot;saving construction&quot; these
Supreme Court decisions<BR>
arguably do support -- confining the CDA to communications that are obscene
under Miller. <BR>
See ALA PH Br. at 51 n.56.  They contend, instead, that this Court has a
license to do<BR>
whatever &quot;construction work&quot; is necessary to ensure that the CDA
remains in effect as a<BR>
sanction for online &quot;pornography.&quot;  But a &quot;limiting construction&quot;
is appropriate only if the<BR>
statute is &quot;subject to,&quot; and &quot;readily susceptible of,&quot;
such a construction,  New York v. Ferber,<BR>
458 U.S. 747, 769 n.24 (1982); Virginia v. American Booksellers Ass'n, 484
U.S. 383, 397<BR>
(1988).  That is emphatically not the case here.  <BR>
       Amici cannot identify any basis in the CDA's text for their proposed
&quot;construction&quot;<BR>
project.  The &quot;hard construction work&quot; amici urge would require
this Court to &quot;rewrite [the]<BR>
statutory scheme and `create distinctions where none were intended.'&quot;
 Consumer Party v.<BR>
Davis, 778 F.2d 140, 146-47 (3d Cir. 1985) (citation omitted).  See also
Blount v. Rizzi, 400<BR>
U.S. 410, 419 (1971).  Although child pornography is a recognized juridical
category, see<BR>
Ferber, 458 U.S. 747; 18 U.S.C.  2252, &quot;pornography&quot; simpliciter
is not.  This Court would<BR>
have to invent any such category from whole cloth, and amici themselves
cannot articulate<BR>
a coherent formulation for the &quot;narrowing construction&quot; they urge.[3]
 <BR>
       Transforming the CDA into a &quot;pornography&quot; statute would
require the Court to<BR>
resolve such fundamental questions as how to define &quot;pornography,&quot;
whether to include a<BR>
&quot;pandering&quot; element, see NLCCF Br. at 40, 43 n.21, 46 &amp; n.23,
81, and how to frame the<BR>
&quot;serious value&quot; exemption which amici describe in only the vaguest
terms, e.g., id. at 16, 51. <BR>
But such &quot;issues of policy,&quot; 37 Photographs, 402 U.S. at 372,
are for Congress to resolve. <BR>
&quot;[D]rawing one or more lines between categories of speech covered by
an overly broad<BR>
statute, when Congress has sent inconsistent signals as to where the new
line or lines should<BR>
be drawn, involves a . . . serious invasion of the legislative domain.&quot;
 United States v.<BR>
National Treasury Employees Union, 115 S. Ct. 1003, 1019 n.26 (1995) (&quot;NTEU&quot;).[4]
 This<BR>
is not the case in which to invent a new First Amendment category called
&quot;pornography.&quot;[5]<BR>
       Finally, even limiting the CDA to &quot;pornography&quot; would not
save the statute, because<BR>
(among other reasons) &quot;pornography&quot; is constitutionally protected
for adults, and the statute<BR>
would still operate as a complete ban of such speech for many speakers.
 Amici appear to<BR>
recognize that the compliance measures they enumerate, see NLCCF Br. 50-51,
are not now<BR>
available for noncommercial speakers.  Indeed, they ultimately rest on a
plainly incorrect<BR>
argument the Government has not endorsed, i.e., that even a ban on online
&quot;pornography&quot;<BR>
would be constitutional.  See id. at 23; ACLU Resp. to NLCCF 1-5.  In short,
this Court<BR>
should reject amici's request to &quot;redraft the statute,&quot; NTEU,
115 S. Ct. at 1003.<BR>
       2.     Least Restrictive Means.  Amici misinterpret the &quot;least
restrictive means&quot; prong<BR>
of the strict scrutiny standard and, in so doing, misstate plaintiffs' position.
 NLCCF Br. at<BR>
24-37.  Plaintiffs' position is that Congress could select less restrictive
alternatives than those<BR>
enacted by the sweeping provisions of the CDA.[6]  Congress could subsidize
or otherwise<BR>
support the further development and availability of user-based blocking
systems.  See ALA<BR>
PI Mem. at 40-41; ALA PH Br. at 32-33.  Congress could enact a more carefully
constructed<BR>
law that -- without the need for &quot;hard construction work&quot; by the
judiciary -- does not<BR>
effectively ban vast quantities of clearly protected speech for a wide range
of speakers.  See<BR>
ALA PI Mem. at 41; ALA PH Br. at 33.  And the Government could vigorously
enforce<BR>
existing obscenity and child pornography laws.  See ALA PI Mem. at 38; ALA
PH Br.. at<BR>
25-26 &amp; n.29.[7]<BR>
       Amici assert that &quot;[a] less restrictive means must be just as
effective as the means at<BR>
issue in accomplishing the asserted interest.&quot;  NLCCF Br. at 24.  As
this court recognized<BR>
in rejecting an identical argument in Fabulous Assocs. v. Public Utility
Comm'n, 896 F.2d<BR>
780, 788 (3d Cir. 1990), this is clearly not the law in strict scrutiny
cases.  If it were, any ban<BR>
on speech that served a compelling governmental interest would be constitutional,
because<BR>
any more narrowly tailored alternative would almost always be less &quot;effective.&quot;
 Yet the<BR>
Supreme Court in Sable Communications, Inc. v. FCC, 492 U.S. 115, 130-31
(1989), struck<BR>
down such a ban because of the mere possibility that less restrictive alternatives
might exist,<BR>
even though it acknowledged that these alternatives would likely be less
effective than the<BR>
challenged ban.  See Fabulous Assocs, 896 F.2d at 788. <BR>
       The Court has frequently invalidated content-based laws because less
restrictive<BR>
alternatives existed, without finding that the alternatives were &quot;just
as effective&quot; as the<BR>
challenged speech restriction.  For example, in striking down portions of
a state statute<BR>
regulating charitable solicitations in Riley v. National Federation of the
Blind, 487 U.S. 781<BR>
(1988), the Court noted the availability of less restrictive alternatives
-- including the State's<BR>
pre-existing law requiring disclosure of information to it, see id. at 795,
publication of that<BR>
information by the State, see id. at 800, or vigorous enforcement of the
State's pre-existing<BR>
antifraud laws, see id. at 795, 800 -- without finding that those alternatives
would be equally<BR>
effective.  To the contrary, the Court stated that even if the alternatives
are &quot;not the most<BR>
efficient means of preventing fraud, we reaffirm simply and emphatically
that the First<BR>
Amendment does not permit the State to sacrifice speech for efficiency.&quot;
 Id. at 795 (citing<BR>
Village of Schaumburg v. Citizens For a Better Environment, 444 U.S. 620,
639 (1980);<BR>
Schneider v. State, 308 U.S. 147, 164 (1939)).  In short, under strict scrutiny,
there is no<BR>
requirement that alternatives be &quot;just as effective&quot; as the challenged
law.[8]<BR>
       In any event, as plaintiffs have demonstrated, the use of parental
control methods is<BR>
more effective than the CDA in preventing minors from gaining access to
&quot;indecent&quot; or<BR>
&quot;patently offensive&quot; online communications, and those methods
do not interfere with adult<BR>
access to such communications.  See ALA PH Br. at 26-32; ALA PI Mem. at
38-41.  Amici<BR>
assert, however, that plaintiffs &quot;should agree&quot; that the combination
of the CDA's content-<BR>
provider restrictions with user blocking would be more effective than &quot;either
alone.&quot; NLCCF<BR>
Br. at 37.  But this too is not the law, for it will almost always be true
that the combination<BR>
of a speech restriction with its less restrictive alternative would be more
effective than &quot;either<BR>
alone.&quot;[9]  Surely, for example, the combination of the challenged
statute regulating charitable<BR>
solicitations in Riley and the state's pre-existing antifraud law would
have been more effective<BR>
in combatting fraud in charitable solicitations than either alone, see 487
U.S. at 795, 800,<BR>
yet the Court did not count this &quot;combination&quot; as a separate &quot;least
restrictive alternative.&quot; <BR>
       3.     Foreign Postings.  In response to one of the most glaring
flaws in the CDA,<BR>
amici can point only to a 1911 treaty committing the United States to share
information with<BR>
other signatory nations to aid in the enforcement of their respective obscenity
laws and<BR>
statutes forbidding the importation of obscenity and child pornography,
NLCCF Br. at 65-67<BR>
&amp; n.56.  The existence of these measures does nothing to change the
fact that the CDA will<BR>
be completely ineffective at reaching the very large proportion of &quot;indecent&quot;
or &quot;patently<BR>
offensive&quot; material posted on the Internet overseas.  The Government,
whose burden it is<BR>
to show that the CDA will directly and materially advance its asserted interest,
has not<BR>
suggested that the CDA will in fact reduce the amount of such material posted
overseas and<BR>
available in the United States.[10]  Neither it nor amici can point to any
content-based<BR>
restriction of speech that has survived strict scrutiny in the face of undisputed
evidence that<BR>
it will have such a marginal effect on the problem to be addressed.[11]<BR>
       4.     &quot;Tagging&quot;.  Amici have a sharply different view
from the Government of the<BR>
role of &quot;tagging&quot; as a &quot;potential mechanism of compliance&quot;
under the CDA.  See NLCCF<BR>
Br. at 50; id. at 51 (proprietor of a sexually explicit site could comply
by &quot;add[ing] an<BR>
appropriate tag (&quot;-L18&quot;), and requir[ing] some form of adult verification&quot;)
(emphasis added). <BR>
Indeed, amici admit that tagging alone &quot;is a magnet that attracts,
rather than repels, children.&quot; <BR>
Id. at 51.  The disagreement between amici, who played a &quot;central role&quot;
in the CDA's<BR>
enactment, and the Department of Justice, charged with enforcing it, over
whether tagging<BR>
alone would be a defense, illustrates the intolerable vagueness of the 47
U.S.C.  223(e)(5)<BR>
defense for ordinary speakers who are at risk of imprisonment, see ALA PH
Br. at 13-14,<BR>
and counsels against judicial &quot;construction&quot; of a tagging defense.
   <BR>
       5.     The Cigarette Advertising Analogy.  Amici are far off the
mark when they<BR>
compare the CDA to restrictions on cigarette advertising directed to children.
 See NLCCF<BR>
Br. 60-61 &amp; n.48.  Here again, amici seek to redraft and then defend
a statute altogether<BR>
different from the one before the Court.  Although the Government has relied
upon &quot;teaser&quot;<BR>
ads by commercial sellers of sexually explicit material,[12] the CDA is
clearly not a<BR>
&quot;commercial speech&quot; restriction and the Government has not defended
it as one.  Restrictions<BR>
on online advertisements would also raise serious constitutional issues,
see Virginia State<BR>
Bd. of Pharmacy v. Virginia Citizens Consumer Council, 425 U.S. 748, 762
(1976), but those<BR>
issues would be entirely distinct from those posed by the far more sweeping
CDA.<BR>
       6.     Time, Place, and Manner.  In a desperate attempt to escape
strict scrutiny,<BR>
amici argue that the CDA is merely a time, place, and manner restriction.
 See NLCCF Br.<BR>
at 58-62.  That argument is clearly wrong.  Time, place, and manner restrictions
must be<BR>
content-neutral, see Consolidated Edison Co. v. Public Serv. Comm'n, 447
U.S. 530, 536<BR>
(1980); Erznoznik v. Jacksonville, 422 U.S. 205, 209 (1975).  The CDA by
its terms is content-<BR>
based.  Nor can amici resort to the &quot;secondary effects&quot; rationale
of Renton v. Playtime<BR>
Theatres, Inc., 475 U.S. 41, 47-49 (1986).  Amici's own description of the
purpose of the<BR>
statute -- restricting minors' access to material that is &quot;harmful&quot;
for them, NLCCF Br. at 16<BR>
-- makes clear that the CDA is justified by the alleged effects on recipients
of the content<BR>
of the speech itself, not by any &quot;secondary effect.&quot; Such a statute
is content-based, and<BR>
therefore subject to strict scrutiny, which the CDA cannot survive.[13]<BR>
       In conclusion, plaintiffs respectfully submit that the challenged
provisions are<BR>
unconstitutional and request the Court to grant their motion for a preliminary
injunction.<BR>

<STRONG>FOOTNOTES</STRONG><BR>
<BR>
1. See ALA Post-Hearing (&quot;PH&quot;) Br. 19-24.  Amici's argument that
the CDA focuses<BR>
narrowly on &quot;pornography&quot; is undercut by their apparent recognition
that the CDA covers<BR>
the non-&quot;pornographic&quot; use of profanity.  See NLCCF Br. at 39
(Americans already know<BR>
&quot;what types of words and pictures are `indecent' in such mass communications
media&quot; as radio<BR>
and TV); id. at 69 n. 63 (&quot;`The man who swears in a street car is as
much of a nuisance as<BR>
the man who smokes there.'&quot;) (citation and quotation omitted; emphasis
added by amicus<BR>
Morality in Media).  Amici have an amorphous yet very broad understanding
of the term<BR>
&quot;pornography.&quot;  See ALCU Resp. to NLCCF at 6-8.<BR>
2. Although the Government and amici both attempt to make the CDA seem narrower
than<BR>
it is, their views of what the CDA provides are often inconsistent.  For
example, amici<BR>
contend that, for liability under the CDA, a CDA violator must &quot;act
`knowingly' by knowing<BR>
of the indecent character of the communication and know that it is going
to or is available<BR>
to children.&quot; NLCCF Br. at 7 (emphasis added).  The cases amici cite
do not support their<BR>
apparent view that the CDA requires proof that a content provider knew his
communication<BR>
was legally &quot;indecent&quot; or &quot;patently offensive.&quot;  E.g.,
Hamling v. United States, 418 U.S. 87,<BR>
123 (1974) (knowledge of content of material is enough).  The Government
has not taken<BR>
this position, just as it also has not relied on the Conference Committee's
statement that<BR>
Subsection (d) liability requires &quot;intention to be offensive,&quot;
H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 458, 104th<BR>
Cong., 2d Sess., at 189 (&quot;Conf. Rep.&quot;).  See ALA Preliminary Injunction
(&quot;PI&quot;) Mem. at 70-71. <BR>
These inconsistencies between the CDA's creators and its enforcers with
regard to the<BR>
essential elements of the offense vividly illustrate that the CDA is hopelessly
vague.  See<BR>
ALA PH Br. at 37-44.<BR>
3. Amici propose a standard that merely begs the question, except insofar
as it incorporates<BR>
the &quot;harmful to minors&quot; standard Congress specifically rejected;
they say the Court should<BR>
&quot;narrow the scope of the CDA to reach only the type of patently offensive,
indecently<BR>
pornographic sexual exploitation that is unprotected and harmful for minors.&quot;
 NLCCF Br.<BR>
at 15-16 (emphasis added).  They alternatively refer to their newly coined
indecency standard<BR>
as reaching only &quot;hard-core pornography&quot; or &quot;soft-core pornographic
indecency,&quot; id. at 21-22,<BR>
never defining either.  At other times they suggest mere &quot;nudity&quot;
is indecent.  Id. at 39.<BR>
4. This Court would face weighty constitutional problems as well, see NTEU,
115 S. Ct. at<BR>
1019, including how to avoid vagueness problems.  The entire statutory repair
project amici<BR>
urge is constitutionally dubious because it would diminish Congress's &quot;incentive
to draft a<BR>
narrowly tailored law in the first place,&quot;  Osborne v. Ohio, 495 U.S.
103, 121 (1990)<BR>
(paraphrasing Massachusetts v. Oakes, 491 U.S. 576, 586 (1989)), and &quot;substitute
the Judicial<BR>
for the Legislative Department.&quot;  United States v. Reese, 92 U.S. 214,
221 (1876).<BR>
5. Amici rely extensively on Sections IV.A. and IV.B. of Pacifica (NLCCF
Br. at 14-15, 77,<BR>
79 n.11), which were joined by only three justices, express a view that
has never commanded<BR>
a majority, and do not espouse the &quot;pornography&quot; standard amici
urge.<BR>
6.     Although plaintiffs have posited several alternatives, the Government
must show that<BR>
the CDA is the least restrictive means.  See Pltfs. Joint Burden of Proof
Mem.  Even if the<BR>
CDA did embody the least restrictive means, the Government would still have
to show that<BR>
the &quot;benefit gained outweigh[ed] the loss of constitutionally protected
rights.&quot;  Elrod v. Burns,<BR>
427 U.S. 347, 363 (1976).<BR>
7.  As amici's own example shows, see NLCCF Br. at 29 n.11 (citing United
States v.<BR>
Thomas, 74 F.2d 701 (6th Cir. 1996)), these laws apply to online communications.<BR>
8. Dial Information Services, upon which amici rely for the contrary proposition,
see NLCCF<BR>
Br. at 24, cites no case in support of its statement, see Dial Info. Servs.
v. Thornburgh, 938<BR>
F.2d 1535, 1541 (2d Cir. 1991), cert. denied, 502 U.S. 1072 (1992).  If
it is based on Sable,<BR>
its reliance is misplaced.  See Fabulous Assocs., 896 F.2d at 788.<BR>
9. Here, however, the CDA is unlikely to cause any actual reduction in minors'
access to<BR>
&quot;indecent&quot; and &quot;patently offensive&quot; material beyond
what the unregulated market for<BR>
screening technologies would produce.  The factual premise for amici's &quot;combination&quot;
theory<BR>
is flawed because there is no reason to assume (and the Government certainly
has not<BR>
shown) that parents will obtain and deploy user blocking systems as often
if they know a<BR>
system of government content-provider regulation is in place as they would
in an unregulated<BR>
world where parents clearly understand they have primary responsibility
(indeed, it is far<BR>
more reasonable to assume the contrary).  And to the extent the CDA's existence
reduces<BR>
demand for user blocking options, the statute will be counter-productive,
because user-based<BR>
blocking is undisputedly the only effective means of reducing minors' access
to the very ample<BR>
store of &quot;indecent&quot; and &quot;patently offensive&quot; material
that is posted overseas.<BR>
10. See Olsen Test. Tr. Vol. V, at 44:14-16 (&quot;we would have to rely
on SurfWatch or Net<BR>
Nanny technology for foreign speakers&quot;).  Nations ordinarily will not
extradite a person unless<BR>
the charged offense constitutes a serious crime in both the requesting and
requested nation,<BR>
see 1 Restatement (3d) of the Foreign Relations Law of the United States
 476.  See also<BR>
Schmidt Test., Tr. Vol. IV, at 131:14-24 (other nations have more lenient
standards).<BR>
11. Indeed, laws with such a marginal effect are struck down even under
intermediate<BR>
scrutiny.  See Bolger v. Youngs Drug Products Co., 463 U.S. 60, 73 (1983)
(law prohibiting<BR>
unsolicited mailing of contraceptive advertisements &quot;provides only
the most limited<BR>
incremental support&quot; for the government interest because &quot;parents
already exercise substantial<BR>
control over the disposition of mail once it enters their mailboxes.&quot;).<BR>
12. See US Resp. to ACLU TRO/PI Mem. at 11 (quoting Senator Exon's comments,
141<BR>
Cong. Rec. S8340 (June 14, 1995)).  Most of the photographs located and
described by the<BR>
Government's witness Howard Schmidt consisted of such &quot;teaser&quot;
photographs offered as<BR>
advertisements by commercial providers.  See Schmidt Test. Decl.  8-10,
15-23, 25, 31, 32,<BR>
34, 38 and exhibits referenced therein. <BR>
13. See, e.g., Forsyth County v. The Nationalist Movement, 505 U.S. 123,
134-35 (1992). <BR>
The portion of Young v. American Mini-Theatres, Inc., 427 U.S. 50 (1976),
quoted by amici<BR>
did not command a majority of the Court.  See NLCCF Br. at 61 (quoting Young,
427 U.S.<BR>
at 70, 71).  And amici cite two pre-Forsyth County Court of Appeals decisions,
both of which<BR>
relied on Young.  See NLCCF Br. at 60-61 (citing M.S. News v. Casado, 721
F.2d 1281, 1288-<BR>
89 (10th Cir. 1983); Upper Midwest Booksellers Assocs. v. Minneapolis, 780
F.2d 1389, 1395<BR>
(8th Cir. 1985)).<BR>
