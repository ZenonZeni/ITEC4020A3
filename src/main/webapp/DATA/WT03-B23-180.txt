<P>
Tax-exempt funds invest in municipal securities
for tax-free income. Income dividends are usually paid monthly.
National tax-free funds are generally tax exempt at the federal
level, but not at the state level. State specific tax-free funds
are exempt from <I>both</I> federal and state taxes and are therefore
considered double tax-exempt.

<UL>
<LI><B>Short-Term / Intermediate Municipal
Bond Funds</B> --- invest in tax-exempt
debt maturing, on average, in less than five years, while intermediate-term
funds have an average maturity of five to 10 years.</LI>
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI><B>General Municipal Bond Funds</B>
--- invest at least 65% of their assets in municipal bonds carrying
any of the top four credit ratings.</LI>
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI><B>Insured Municipal Bond Funds</B>
---at least 65% of the fund's holdings have been insured
for timely payment of interest, but not against the loss of principal.
Even though a bond is insured, it will fluctuate in price before
maturity just like any other bond.</LI>
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI><B>Single-State Municipal Bond Funds</B>
--- since there are no federal taxes on municipal bond fund distributions,
and no state and local taxes for investors who live in the municipality
that issues the bond, single-state &quot;muni&quot; funds limit
their investments to tax-exempt securities in a particular state.
For example, New York City investors can buy triple tax-free New
York funds and keep all of their earnings &quot;tax free.&quot;</LI>
