<H2>Viewing And Downloading Files</H2>

Most of the files on the DOT Web server are stored in one 
of the 3 following formats:

<UL>
<LI>	<B>Native HTML</B> - These files are formated in HTML and are viewable
	only with a Web browser.  With HTML we can format text and insert
	graphics in our documents.  <P>

<LI>	<B>ASCII Text</B> - These files have no formatting and can be viewed
	on any system.  This of course is the simplest way to ensure
	that anybody can read a file, but it's the least attractive. <P>

<LI>	<B>Adobe Acrobat</B> - Acrobat is an application that will take print
	output and save it in a format that can be recreated at will.
	Using the Acrobat reader, you can view, search, and print the
	document in it's original form complete with graphics, color,
	and original fonts.  You can't view these documents on-line
	(yet) without having a seperate viewer program, but it's 
	the best way to download really graphically intense documents.  <P>

</UL>

Some of our documents (mostly found on our gopher links) are stored 
in native word processer (ie: MS Word or WordPerfect) or other application 
formats (ie: MS Excel, PK ZIP, etc).  This is occasionally unavoidable.  
To download these files without attempting to load an associated program, press the &lt;SHIFT&gt; key then click on the document pointer.  This should (on most browsers) force the browser to save that document to your local disk.<P>  
 
<H3>Movies</H3>

We have adopted Apple's Quicktime format for any digital movies we distribute.
Why?  It works better, and it's compatible with both Mac and DOS based systems.
You will need to download Apple's Quicktime for Windows software in order to
play these movies on Windows.  Mac systems should already have the Quicktime
software. Windows users will need the <A HREF="http://quicktime.apple.com/winlicense.html">QuickTime for Windows</A>
software from Apple.<P>
