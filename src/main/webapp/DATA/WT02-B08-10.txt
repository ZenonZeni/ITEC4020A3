<B>STUDY DEMONSTRATES OXYFUELS' ABILITY TO SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCE CARBON MONOXIDE</B> 
</CENTER>
<P>
A comprehensive analysis completed by Systems Applications International (SAI) for the Renewable Fuels Association (RFA) and the Oxygenated Fuels Association clearly demonstrates the ability of oxyfuels to substantially reduce carbon monoxide (CO) concentrations.  The study augments a study conducted earlier this summer by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which also demonstrated a significant and sustained reduction in CO attributable to oxyfuels. 
<CENTER>
<HR WIDTH=450>
&#34When wintertime oxyfuel is used, the corresponding<BR>
 ambient CO concentrations are reduced by approximately<BR>
 14 percent.&#34
<HR WIDTH=450>
</CENTER>
<P>
The SAI study reports a substantial (14% reduction) and statistically significant (+4%) association between the use of oxyfuels and monitored CO concentrations.
<P>
<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="112196a.gif">
</CENTER>
<P>
More importantly, the analysis notes that as the EPA estimates that on-road vehicles contribute only 62 percent of total CO emissions, oxyfuels are  &#34reducing mobile CO emissions by as much as 
20 percent. &#34  
<P>
&#34 This study answers many of the critics of the oxyfuels program by clearly demonstrating the effectiveness of oxygenated fuels in reducing carbon monoxide levels, &#34 said Eric Vaughn, President of the RFA. 
<P>
The SAI study analyzed raw CO data from over 1,000 sites across the country.  The analysis utilized bimonthly (Dezcember-January for winter and June-July for summer) average hourly CO and average daily eight-hour maximum CO observations retrieved from the Aerometric Information Retrieval System.  The use of data from both December and January is significant given that the highest CO concentrations are typically recorded during these two months.  The study also includes June and July data as a control, as oxyfuel programs are not in place during the summer months.
<P>
The study was conducted in response to a National Research Council peer-review of the Office of Science and Technology Policy's study of the effectiveness of the winter oxygenated fuels program, which suggested only minimal reductions in CO attributable to the oxyfuel program.

<CENTER><B>ENVIRONMENTAL MESSAGE RINGS LOUD AND CLEAR IN FALL ELECTIONS</B></CENTER>
<P>
One of the obvious messages coming from the election is that environmental policy has become a potent issue in electoral politics today.  Of the 19 Republican incumbents defeated, 16 were on an environmental hit list.  Environmental groups were successful in defeating about 60 % of the Members that were targeted.  
<P>
<U><b>House Renewable Energy Caucus</b></U><BR>
The Renewable Energy Caucus, formed last February, is a bipartisan organization comprised of Members who support the research and development of renewable energy sources.  The Caucus has increased awareness of renewable energy issues on Capitol Hill, and members have successfully maintained funding for renewable energy programs at the Department of Energy.
<P>
The anticipated addition of freshman Members to the House Renewable Energy Caucus will likely raise membership to over 100 members.  90 members of the Caucus were reelected, including 46 Republicans, 42 Democrats, and 2 Independents. 
 
&#34 The Renewable Energy Caucus will assume a more prominent role in the 105th Congress as Members are extremely aware of the potency of environ-mental issues today,&#34 said Eric Vaughn, President of the RFA.  &#34 We look forward to continuing to work with the Caucus to educate Members about the importance of an abundant, affordable and domestically produced energy supply. &#34

<U><B>Congressional Alcohol Fuels Caucus</B></U><BR>
The Alcohol Fuels Caucus has been a highly effective voice for the ethanol industry for more than 12 years.  Under the leadership of Rep. Dick Durbin (D-IL) and Jim Leach (R-IA), the Caucus has helped to build strong bipartisan support for the increased production and use of fuel ethanol.
<P>
With two members having been elected to the U.S. Senate, and several others having retired or been defeated, the Caucus will be seeking new membership.  The RFA will work to build membership as the 105th Congress convenes, and we urge all ethanol supporters to encourage their Member of Congress to join.

<U><B>President Clinton on Ethanol</B></U><BR> 
(responding to a question posed by the National Corn Growers Association):
<P>
&#34 I am committed to ensuring that ethanol continues to be an important part of America's energy future and will vigorously support the continued development of the ethanol industry.  Ethanol production increases farm income, decreases deficiency payments, creates jobs in rural America, and reduces American reliance on foreign oil.  While it has experienced tremendous growth in the last few years, the ethanol industry barely existed 15 years ago, and is still not a mature industry.  I believe Congress and my administration must work together to provide the foundation for the ethanol industry's continued growth.  I am strongly opposed to efforts to reduce or repeal the alcohol fuels tax incentives. &#34

<B>PEKIN ENERGY COMPANY EXECUTIVE OUTLINES FUTURE ROLE FOR ETHANOL</B></CENTER>
<P>
<I>The following is excerpted from a speech by Ron Miller, Vice President - Ethanol Marketing and Logistics, Pekin Energy Company, Williams Energy Group, and Chairman of the RFA Board of Directors, to the Governors' Ethanol Coalition</I>
<P>
If one were to describe ethanol's role in America in one sentence, it might go something like this: "An economic investment in domestic renewable energy designed to reduce this nation's dependence on imported energy while addressing the environmental need for cleaner-burning motor fuels with the added benefit of providing consistent and secure markets for an ever expanding agricultural base."  This troika of agriculture, national energy and environmental policy is key to continued public support for ethanol.  The economic investment is made by the private sector.
<P>
This year's corn production is about 9.4 billion bushels.  The ethanol industry consumes about 600 million bushels per year, or about 6%.  Some estimates forecast a 30-40% growth in corn production within the next decade.  Today there is not existing market demand for that production.  While export markets have been strong, the rest of the world is on a higher production curve like the United States.  Also, export markets can be extremely volatile creating significant risks to grain producers.  Ethanol, perhaps more than any other market for grain, has the potential to grow with increased output.  Today, ethanol represents only slightly over 1% of this nation's gasoline supply.  The market potential is unlimited.
<P>
Of all components in gasoline only ethanol is renewable.  From a carbon cycle perspective, it is the only component that has a positive impact on global warming.  Ethanol's clean burn tendencies reduce ozone forming tailpipe emissions.  More and more, the &#34 good science &#34 of automobile emissions is focusing on the tailpipe as the generator of the more reactive compounds that create ozone.  That is why I believe that as the clean air science moves forward, the better ethanol will look.  And most importantly, I believe the global warming issue is right around the corner.
<P>
Where does the future of ethanol lie in my perspective?  I think it lies in that partnership of public and private interests.  Organizations like the Governors' Ethanol Coalition will help shape the public focus on ethanol.  Private interests can only make economic investments based upon public policy.  
<P>
Today, tax and environmental policies drive ethanol demand.  Will those policies change in the post 2000 time frame?  I really don't know.  But I do know that ethanol is good from an agricultural, domestic energy and environmental perspective and it creates domestic economic activity.  On that basis, I believe appropriate public policies will continue to maintain and probably expand ethanol's role in the United States energy mix.

<B>ETHANOL INDUSTRY PROMOTES COOPERATION WITH BIOMASS POWER AUDIENCE</B></CENTER>
<P>
At the joint annual meeting of the National Biomass Industries Association and the United BioEnergy Commercialization Association, Bob Dinneen, Legislative Director of the RFA, presented to the biomass power industry an outlook on alliances with liquid fuel groups, including the domestic ethanol industry.
<P>
&#34 We need to make support for renewable energy an environmental imperative,&#34 challenged Dinneen.  Noting that 85% of the electorate now considers themselves &#34t environmentalists, &#34 Dinneen stated that the same percentage would like to see U.S. dependence on oil reduced, and federal programs to encourage increased use of alternative fuels and renewables expanded.  
<P>
While Americans by and large see renewable energy as an environmental issue, that link is not supported in Washington.  Political support for renewable energy among the House Renewable Energy Caucus &#34 is found predominately among those Members who recognize the economic benefit to their community from the development of a particular alternative energy resource.&#34  Dinneen challenged the group that &#34 we need to make support for renewable energy part of the environmental lexicon and make it an inextricable part of the environmental agenda.&#34
<P>
Concerned with rising oil imports that threaten our nation's energy independence, Dinneen stated that energy policy must assume a more prominent role on the political agenda.  & quot Nobody discusses energy policy until there is a crisis... we need to make energy independence a part of the political discourse,& quot said Dinneen.
<P>
Finally, Dinneen encouraged the liquid fuels and biomass power groups to work together.  & quot Clearly, there are political synergies [between fuel ethanol and biomass power].  But there very well may be marketplace synergies in the future as technology matures and markets grow.  We need to be acutely attentive to those opportunities, and work together for our mutual benefit. &#34
