Reston, VA -- President Clinton has sent a letter to Congressman Newt Gingrich
(R-GA),
Speaker of the House, urging the House to quickly enact several important health
reform
provisions that were passed by the Senate last week.  One that is of extreme
importance to 
children with exceptionalities is entitled the Mental Health Parity Act of 1996 (S. 2031). 
Sponsored by Senators Pete Domenici (R-NM) and Paul Wellstone (D-MN), the
provision
would prohibit health plans from establishing separate lifetime and annual limits for
mental
health benefits than those limits that exist for physical health services. This provision
has been
added to the HUD/VA appropriations bill that is currently being considered by
Congress.<P>

<b>Original Parity Provision Dropped in Conference</b><P>

A previous mental health parity provision was originally included in the Senate's version
of
the health insurance reform bill that was recently signed by President Clinton.  The
original
provision would have prevented insurers from imposing any cost-sharing requirements
or other
limitations on mental health coverage that they do not impose for physical illnesses.
Business
groups complained that the cost of this change would make it impossible for them to
afford
health coverage for their workers. Senator Domenici, one of the primary sponsors,
offered a
compromise to prohibit lifetime caps or annual limits, which was supported by the
mental
health community. Yet even this compromise was unacceptable to the business
community.  It
was passed by the Senate, but then stripped off the health insurance bill by the
House/Senate
Conference Committee. <P>

Since the House expressed strong opposition to the previous mental health parity
amendment,
it will probably be extremely difficult to keep this new provision from being stripped from
the
HUD/VA bill as well, even with President Clinton's written support of the proposal. <P>

Stay tuned!<P>
