<p>The 1996 presidential race is well on its way. It is taking 
place at a time when the danger from the right is very 
great, when tens of millions of working-class families are 
experiencing hard economic times, at a time when the rights 
and well-being of all working people, especially the 
racially oppressed, are under attack.</p>

<p>Alienation from the two dominant capitalist parties is at an 
all-time high. A majority of the 18-and-over population is 
not voting. Millions of American voters are electorally 
homeless. Over one-third are presently registered 
independent, and the idea of a third party is supported by a 
majority of the people. Among African American voters 
support for a third party is in the high 70-percent range 
and growing. In most polls well over a majority of trade 
unionists think we need a pro-working-class third party.</p>

<p>Putting aside right-wing third-party forms, there are 
presently numerous efforts by progressive forces -- 
nationally, regionally and locally -- to bring about and 
build third-party formations. Tens of thousands vote for and 
have joined various left-wing and progressive third-party 
formations. National parties like the Greens and the New 
Party are successfully fielding candidates for office. Labor 
Party Advocates (LPA) has signed up tens of thousands of 
supporters, mostly trade unionists, and are planning to hold 
a founding convention in 1996. This movement has real 
support, but is struggling with the question of whether to 
run candidates and how to build in the communities as well 
as among trade unionists. Other groups are busy organizing, 
networking and calling conferences.</p>

<p>There are also many independent forces that are active 
within the Democratic Party who want to see a third party 
come about and are ready to cooperate with such a formation. 
They have seen the way the right wing took over the 
Republican Party in state after state and gained dominance 
in Congress by working in the grassroots, outside as well as 
within the Republican Party structure. They appreciate the 
positive impact that an active, viable, labor-based, multi-
racial people's party pushing from the left would have. They 
don't quite see how to bring it about, but are ready to help 
if they can. At the same time they are concerned that this 
not take away from their efforts to defeat the ultra-right 
danger and the effort to put the best possible people into 
elected office today.</p>

<p><strong>Real vs. phony independence</strong> - Real independence means more 
than independence of the parties of big business -- it must 
include independence from the policies of big business first 
and foremost. That is why conservative forces such as those 
associated with the Patriot Party and Ross Perot -- though 
he received a lot of legitimate independent votes in 1992 -- 
do not represent real independence. Similarly with the 
prospect of a bid for the presidency by Colin Powell -- 
while he speaks of being independent he is closely tied in 
with monopoly capital, particularly the military-industrial 
complex.</p>

<p>Rather, we're talking about labor forces, elected officials 
and active voters in the African American, Mexican American 
and Puerto Rican communities. We are talking about peace, 
anti-racist, senior, women, youth and student, environmental 
activists -- these are the real independents who want an 
alternative to an electoral system dominated by the two 
parties of big business. They want a party that's on the 
side of the people, where they can elect progressives and 
fight on issues in an honest and principled way. They must 
be seen as progressive independents.</p>

<p>Communists are active in the various progressive third-party 
formations. We see the need for a broad, national, mass 
electoral party where diverse progressive trends can 
increase their strength, work together and win.</p>

<p>At the same time, such a formation does not and cannot 
replace the Communist Party. The Communist Party has a long 
and heroic history of running candidates nationally and in 
localities across the country -- and in some cases being 
elected. There is a Communist electoral constituency in 
America that can be built on and expanded. The Communist 
Party, however, has a revolutionary working-class program 
that transcends electoral struggles and deals with the need 
to change society as a whole. Its candidates not only 
present immediate solutions to today's problems but bring 
forward a Marxist-Leninist outlook and present more 
fundamental class solutions up to and including socialism.</p>

<p>We are a contributing stream in the mighty river of 
progressive politics in America today. We have good working 
relations with numerous independent grassroots political 
formations around the country who are involved in building 
independence from the ground up.</p>

<p>Communist Party Chairman Gus Hall recently pointed out, 
"Building a nationwide mass progressive peoples party is 
going to happen sooner or later."</p>

<p>The U.S. body politic is pregnant with the idea of the need 
to build a third, people's party. The deeper the crisis of 
capitalism, the fewer solutions the capitalist parties have 
and therefore the stronger the third-party trend becomes.</p>

<p>While a united third party may not be immediately 
realizable, we believe a united progressive third-party 
movement is realizable now. And it must be worked for now. 
The question is, what needs to be done in order to help 
guarantee the best preconditions so that the birth will be a 
success, and that what is born is what the people need and 
want, and not another form that is basically running 
interference for the ruling class?</p>

<p>For one thing, what is needed is greater working unity of 
the progressive independent forces. No one trend is strong 
enough or diverse enough to meet the national challenge 
alone. Finding the forms for broad working unity is key.</p>

<p>A proposal is circulating -- Presently there is a lot of 
discussion taking place on how to unite independents. There 
is a proposal for action that comes from friendly 
independent forces and that we are circulating and 
discussing. It requires the fullest input from our Party 
membership and leadership. It is an important proposal.</p>

<p>We favor it because it calls for bringing together all of 
the independents -- including those still within the 
Democratic Party -- based on issues, and to struggle 
particularly against the right-wing danger and around the 
growing economic and civil rights emergency in the country. 
We favor it because we think independents should come 
together to support progressive jobs legislation, like the 
Martinez public works jobs bill (HR 1591), and agree to run 
candidates all across the country based on a progressive 
program.</p>

<p>We think independents should end their rivalries and pledge 
to cooperate and not oppose each other. We think 
independents should agree to launch a united national effort 
to democratize the electoral system by making it easier to 
get on the ballot and by eliminating the influence of big 
corporate money through campaign finance reform -- 
conservative independents are also involved in this fight. 
We think independents should come together to agree on a 
list of ultra-right elected officials to run united 
independent candidates against (labor can play a big role in 
this regard). Independents should come together to defend 
motor voter legislation and promote more democratic methods 
of elections like proportional representation. We are for 
grassroots local, statewide and regional conferences, as 
well as a national conference called together on the basis 
of action not philosophy. All of this has to be related not 
only to the goal of a people's party but also to the need to 
defeat the ultra right in the '96 elections.</p>

<p><strong>Role of the Communists</strong> - Our party has a role to play in 
this historic process of building towards a people's party. 
In local areas we are running as Communists for public 
office. But we must not rule out a presidential ticket -- 
which I will discuss later.</p>

<p>Besides running our own candidates, we must contribute to 
advancing the broad movement for political independence 
overall. Independent forces also have a role to play in the 
immediate 1995 and '96 elections. Like a lot of other 
forces, Communists must help figure out how to move things 
forward and positively affect short-term and long-term 
developments.</p>

<p>This is a difficult challenge, especially when 14 months 
from now we face a presidential election with such a strong 
danger from the right.</p>

<p>We must enter this 1996 electoral struggle in a very active 
way. Our role is very much needed. We must help clarify the 
issues and link them to mass fightback. We must help build 
unity and increase the confidence of those involved in the 
fight. For example, the fight for the Martinez bill would 
not be complete without having candidates strongly advocate 
it.</p>

<p>We are in a very complicated situation tactically. The level 
of organization and unity of the people's independent forces 
is far behind what is needed. The sentiments among the 
working-class masses at the grassroots are beyond the 
policies of not only the Democratic and Republican parties, 
but beyond most progressive independent organizations as 
well.</p>

<p>In reading ultra-right and Republican Party material, it's 
clear that the enemy is fully aware of the potential for 
change and is out to block and misdirect real independence. 
They are well financed, well organized and in motion.</p>

<p>While different independent forces might agree on basics, 
there are real differences -- real contradictions between 
those working on various levels of the broad progressive 
movement for independence. Our role is very much needed to 
help find the ways to build unity and help move things 
forward. We must move quickly.</p>

<p>Danger from the right -- As we said, the 1996 election 
struggle is well on its way. The right-wing Republicans are 
out not only to hold their own but to win the White House 
and increase their majority position in the Congress. They 
are working for a situation where they will control the 
judicial, legislative and executive branches of government. 
Powerful forces in the ruling class want a situation where 
passage of their reactionary program is virtually 
guaranteed. That's why we must accelerate the fight to 
advance political independence.</p>

<p>Just recently William Bennett, himself a reactionary 
Republican, accused presidential candidate Pat Buchanan of 
"flirting with fascism." Buchanan is more than flirting in 
my view. We must not forget that there is a fascist element 
out there -- not just the KKK, skinheads and Nazis, but 
forces with a powerful influence in the Republican Party.</p>

<p>As it is, the right-wing measures already being proposed and 
implemented have created an economic as well as a civil 
rights emergency in the nation.</p>

<p>The recent racist Supreme Court decisions against 
affirmative action sounds the alarm. This needs to be seen in 
relation to the anti-immigrant Proposition 187, the effects 
of a long-term racist propaganda campaign against 
affirmative action as well as all entitlements, and the 
vicious attempts to eliminate welfare. These decisions 
codify the blame-the-victim big lie and open the floodgates 
-- not only for more racist attacks but attacks on labor's 
right as well. The ruling class is out to split the working 
class to make it easier to further worsen our conditions of 
life.</p>

<p>As their real program is being exposed, the right-wing 
Republicans who now dominate the Senate and House are losing 
mass support, but they remain confident they can defeat 
Clinton in '96 because they do not count on the grassroots 
of working people being mobilized and organized.</p>

<p>Clinton's tendency is to cooperate with the Contract forces. 
Efforts like his joint appearance with Gingrich in New 
Hampshire are his preferred direction. However, he can be 
moved.</p>

<p>His speech supporting affirmative action shows that despite 
his politically conservative outlook he can be forced in a 
better direction. But if he continues to push his balancing-
the-budget and other conservative programs, his chances of 
building a winning electoral coalition by November '96 are 
slim. For one thing he will build the abstention trend among 
democratic voters.</p>

<p>We want to score a major defeat of the right in '96 because 
the alternative is unacceptable. As bad as it is now, it 
could get worse. A right-wing dominance of all three 
branches of government would mean a terrible road ahead for 
the people.</p>

<p>Advocating the third-party option alone is not an adequate 
answer. We should not use efforts towards future strategic 
goals to run away from present tactical challenges. The 
economic and civil rights emergency of today has to be top 
priority in all we do.</p>

<p>Lesser Evil -- As the right gets stronger, the lesser-of-
two-evils dilemma becomes stronger too. Basically it is 
structured into all politics under capitalism. After almost 
a year of the 104th Congress, the idea of the lesser evil is 
influencing many voters today. Its impact cannot be ignored; 
it will influence the 1996 elections.</p>

<p>A lot of people are suffering and want relief. The best way 
to achieve long-term relief is to build a powerful 
independent movement and party -- yet such a party cannot be 
built devoid of struggle against the right danger. The best 
way to meet the lesser-evil problem is to establish a 
"better good" alternative. The big tactical challenge is how 
far we can go down the road to advancing the building of a 
"better good" as we meet the challenges of today.</p>

<p>Simply tailing the Democrats is not the way. The pressures 
to do that, especially in the presidential race, are very 
great because the prospects of building a viable national 
"better good" are more difficult.</p>

<p>But in local and congressional races there are signs that 
many real independent challenges can be initiated and won. 
Real victories are possible in 1996 if we understand that, 
even with the lesser-evil problem most sharply expressed on 
the level of the presidential race, it is still possible to 
pressure that election to the left, defeat many right-wing 
candidates and programs on a local, state and congressional 
levels, and that these local fights can have a positive 
impact on the whole electoral struggle. Finding tactics that 
will move the people is key.</p>

<p>New Independent Trends -- There are some new trends out 
there that show that independence is gaining strength. Along 
with the positive results experienced by those building 
third-party formations -- especially those who are building 
from the bottom up -- there are signs that political 
independence is gaining support among organized strategic 
forces. The willingness to defy the Democratic Party 
hierarchy, reject the machine and move outside the two-party 
system is gaining broader acceptance. The idea of running 
candidates as independents, including for president, is 
widely accepted now; it's not considered a "way out" thing 
to do anymore.</p>

<p>After Clinton's latest budget betrayals which undermined the 
whole fight against the Contract in Congress and 
strengthened the right, many progressive forces in the 
Democratic Party were enraged and openly talked about a 
break with Clinton.</p>

<p>The pressures for Jesse Jackson to run have gotten very 
strong. At the recent Rainbow meeting in Atlanta, the slogan 
"Run Jesse Run" reemerged. At a July '95 meeting sponsored 
by Essence magazine in New Orleans, according to the Wall 
Street Journal the African American leaders there were 
generally of the opinion that if President Clinton continues 
moving to the right with such initiatives as his balanced 
budget and affirmative action review, distancing himself 
from the leadership of minority and women's organization and 
other liberals, "Mr. Jackson will feel obligated to run. And 
if the president fights for their agenda, he won't run ..." 
The same article quoted Jackson as saying, "We will not sit 
idly by and watch the great gains of the past evaporate."</p>

<p>Jackson's aides say that they are studying their options, 
including the possibility of running as an independent in 
the general election. This idea is getting a lot of support, 
including among some Congressional Democrats. Incumbents are 
saying that among their constituents, Jackson's being at the 
top of the ticket would help them more then sharing a ticket 
with Clinton. As of this writing, Jackson has not committed 
himself. The main tactic at this point seems to be to apply 
maximum pressure from the left. That is a good tactic and is 
having an impact on Clinton.</p>

<p><strong>Labor</strong> - In the labor movement there is growing alienation 
from the Democrats. Of great importance is the fact that in 
the platform of both groups vying to replace Kirkland as 
head of the AFL-CIO, there is a totally new position 
regarding support of political independence of labor. This 
trend is all over the labor movement.</p>

<p>At the recent Coalition of Black Trade Unionists (CBTU) 
convention, First Vice President Willie Baker said that 
Black workers are no longer the "plow horse" for the 
Democratic Party. They are saying, "no more carte blanche." 
Candidates will be supported based on issues and "let the 
chips fall where they may."</p>

<p>In labor, especially in the leadership circles, there is 
strong pressure that says labor must support Clinton, 
despite the disappointments, due to the danger from the 
right. Such pressure is enormous on the level of the 
presidential race; at the same time, many more top trade 
union leaders today are ready and willing to break with the 
machine on the level of local and congressional candidates.</p>

<p>The continued anger in the ranks of labor over the 
Democrats' betrayal around NAFTA, GATT and the Worker 
Replacement Bill is creating a more favorable climate, 
especially for the Sweeney slate. The pressure for change in 
basic policy in the AFL-CIO is enormous right now. This 
could be a decisive factor in the coming elections if 
mobilized.</p>

<p>The platform of the Sweeney group calls for a "new labor 
movement" and states, "While we must reach out and embrace 
other progressive forces for change, we must above all build 
our own power by creating a strong grassroots political 
voice for working people in this country." Sweeney says that 
the labor movement needs to "exact a price" from candidates 
before endorsing them for public office. This view was 
frantically attacked by Al Shanker, showing a growing 
desperation among conservative labor leaders.</p>

<p>Speaking at the recent Jobs with Justice conference, George 
Becker, president of the United Steelworkers, called for 
shifting labor's money to elect workers to Congress. Can 
these openings be a basis for building local coalitions of 
independent forces around supporting united labor candidates 
for Congress?</p>

<p>The power that the new mergers will bring to the labor 
movement cannot be overemphasized. Greater clout in 
political action is one of the important reasons given for 
the merger of the Textile unions and the mega-merger of the 
Auto Workers, Machinists and Steelworkers. These are new 
openings for approaching labor.
</p>
<p>Another challenge is around the recent racist Supreme Court 
decisions against redistricting. Can independent forces help 
build broad-based coalitions of all the independent forces 
in response? Why not coalitions that would work to guarantee 
the re-election of Congresswomen Cynthia McKinney and Nydia 
Velazquez? This could be linked to establishing a national 
list of 20 to 30 extreme right-wing Congressmen to target 
for defeat.</p>

<p><strong>The Abstention Factor</strong> - More and more, the ruling class 
relies on the abstention of millions of working-class voters 
to guarantee the election of reactionaries. The abstention 
factor is determining the outcome of most elections today. 
As we said, tens of millions of voters do not identify with 
either the Republican or Democratic parties.</p>

<p>In the 1992 presidential election no candidate received a 
majority. Clinton received a plurality. Over 19 million 
voters -- about 19 percent -- voted for the "independent" 
candidate and billionaire businessman Ross Perot.</p>

<p>In the 1994 mid-term elections only about 38 percent of the 
electorate came out. While they won a lot of races, the 
Republicans actually won by default. The overwhelming 
majority of voters decided not to vote, leaving the field 
open for the more conservative section of the electorate, 
and those most taken in by right-wing demagogy, to determine 
the outcome. In that and other elections the right has a 
power far beyond its actual numerical strength.</p>

<p>Increasingly with the capitulations and moves to the right 
by the Democratic Party, the working-class majority of the 
electorate is opting for a "no confidence, no vote" tactic. 
The danger of this approach is that, by default, it is 
leaving the field open to domination by a minority of voters 
who are wealthy reactionaries.</p>

<p>The answer cannot be simply to work harder to get folks to 
register and vote. The abstention trend is not only a vote 
against the two dominant parties but is rooted in the 
growing lack of confidence in capitalism itself. The answer 
must include advancing the struggle for peace, jobs, justice 
and equality. It must include the struggle to promote 
people's candidates, to create a democratic progressive 
alternative to build the greater good, so that the people 
will have something to vote for. It's becoming clear that 
constant, defensive appeals to come out to vote do not hold 
a lot of sway with large numbers of voters. More is needed.</p>

<p><strong>The Class Issue Is Key</strong> - According to a recent survey 
conducted by Curtis Gans of the Committee for the Study of 
the American Electorate, 60 percent of persons with incomes 
of $50,000 or more voted in 1994, up from 59.2 percent four 
years prior. Only 19.9 percent of those with incomes under 
$5,000 came out, down from 32.2 percent. For voters making 
$5,000 to $10,000 a year, only 23.3 percent voted compared 
to 30.9 percent previously.</p>

<p>The study found that while 46.9 percent of whites said they 
voted, which was an increase from 1990, only 37 percent of 
African-Americans and 19.1 percent of those classified 
Hispanic came out. In each case that was a decrease from 
1990.</p>

<p>As our Party has said, the outcome in the '94 elections was 
not due to an ideological shift to the right by the working-
class majority, as some continue to claim, but rather 
because the active electorate in 1994 tended to be high-
income conservative voters.</p>

<p>Yet some use the same results to keep pushing the "angry 
white men" notion. This idea is pushed in order to hide the 
class issue and encourage and justify racism. The aim is to 
take the justifiable anger of white workers toward the 
system and its ruling class, and misdirect it towards non-
white workers.</p>

<p>Most opinion polls show that there has been no rightward 
shift by working people. As I said earlier, as the class 
essence of the right wing's program is more and more 
exposed, those who advocate the Contract are losing support. 
Helping to popularize a class understanding is key to unity 
in advancing political independence and in defeating the 
ultra right in the coming elections.</p>

<p>For example, while a majority supports a balanced budget and 
lower taxes, they do not support or trust the likes of Newt 
Gingrich. And when you get to the specifics of what is to be 
cut to "balance the budget," a majority do not support the 
anti-working-class, racist measures proposed by the right 
wing to achieve it. To support these measures is to support 
more massive giveaways to the rich at the expense of the 
people. There is a strong class revulsion against these 
policies.</p>

<p>Cutting the military budget, cutting "wealthfare" 
(entitlements for the rich) and taxing the rich are all 
popular, majority ideas among masses of working people.</p>

<p>Even among Republicans, those presidential candidates who 
continue to emphasize the right-wing economic proposals in 
the Contract are falling behind those who have shifted to 
so-called moral issues.</p>

<p><strong>How To Proceed</strong> - Basically what is needed is greater unity 
of the independent forces working on all levels of the 
movement for independent politics. This includes sections of 
labor, African Americans and Latinos, third-party movements, 
those working to democratize the electoral process and 
forces who are still organizationally inside the Democratic 
Party but whose politics are independent and to the left of 
the dominant forces in the party. This includes grassroots 
activists, leaders of mass organizations and elected 
officials.</p>

<p>In the proposal that our Party is in agreement with, there 
are a number of ideas to build on. For example, independents 
could come together to agree on a program to convince 
candidates to run on. One of the most exciting ideas would 
be that everyone -- no matter whether they support the 
Greens, LPA, the New Party, or if they are a reform Democrat 
or a Communist -- all agree to support the same candidates 
for public office.</p>

<p>The proposal projects holding a series of local meetings or 
conferences to help lay the basis for building for a 
national conference. The purpose of local conferences is to 
develop local action programs around the economic and civil 
rights emergency. They could be organized around targeting 
particular extreme-right candidates for defeat.</p>

<p>Take Connecticut, where there have been some excellent 
examples of successful grassroots electoral independence. It 
is a state where the economic emergency is very severe, and 
where Governor Rowland is trying to destroy welfare and 
privatization is high on his agenda. There are municipal 
elections this year and most independent forces are 
involved. In New Haven they are working to put a jobs bill 
referendum on the ballot. In other cities they are working 
on the municipal elections. They are organizing for a real 
fight this year. Can there be a coming-together of 
independent forces to organize and coordinate their efforts?</p>

<p>In New Mexico a very important national Green Party 
conference was held. Our party's presence was welcomed by 
the many independent activist who were there. Virginia 
Brodine, chair of our environmental commission, took part in 
a workshop and on a panel of third parties representing our 
party. She was very well received. We also set up a very 
successful Party literature table.</p>

<p>Our comrades who attended the Green Party conference in 
Washington D.C. last month were also warmly welcomed by its 
organizers. In general, our presence at third-party movement 
events is appreciated and often openly acknowledged. Many 
forces may not agree with us on every issue but they respect 
our contributions, our experiences and our outlook for a 
socialist future.</p>

<p>In California, defense of motor voter laws, defeating the 
affirmative action referendum and the ongoing struggle to 
overturn Proposition 187 are at the center of the electoral 
struggle. With so many third-party forces there, it would 
seem that some form of getting together around a concrete 
issue is possible.</p>

<p>In Oregon there will be a referendum on proportional 
representation on the Eugene ballot. In New York, the 
economic emergency is very severe with the presence of a 
right-wing Republican mayor in New York City and a right-
wing Republican governor in Albany -- the elections must be 
linked to the growing fightback. Certainly in Ohio -- not 
only with Rick Nagin in Cleveland but in Youngstown/ Warren 
in particular -- we ought to have a Communist candidate to 
offer all those households who received our message during 
the homecoming activities a chance to vote for the party of 
Gus Hall.</p>

<p>Thus, all around the country the question is: what can be 
initiated among various independent forces on a local level 
to use the elections to advance the fightback? What can be 
done to strengthen the fight for the Martinez bill vis-a-vis 
the coming elections? This must be a period where hundreds 
of labor, African American, Latino, youth, women and senior 
progressive independents are challenging for public office. 
The real independents must come to the fore.</p>

<p><strong>Communist Candidates</strong> - As I said, we must be prepared to 
launch Communist candidates for public office in the 1996 
elections in as many states and districts as possible. At 
this point, a goal should be for at least one candidate in 
every Party district. I think the time is ripe for running 
Young Communist League members for office as well. Youth 
candidates have a special appeal, particularly when voter 
alienation is so high.</p>

<p>We also must not rule out running for president. In fact we 
must examine all the technical requirements for running a 
presidential slate. The Jackson forces say that it is fairly 
easy in 27 states. What should we do? For one thing, we 
could at least go for a number of key states in order to 
have a voice in the very important national debate.</p>

<p>In the course of these electoral activities, the 
opportunities are very great to build our party and press, 
and broaden the Party's contact with independent forces, 
elected officials and especially rank-and-file activists. 
Electoral activities have always been an excellent way to 
build the Party. This could accelerate our mass recruitment 
in the streets.</p>

<p>The situation calls for a higher level of unity of the 
independent forces and a more coordinated relationship 
between them. With such unity it will be much more possible 
to defeat the right and build towards a mass national 
people's party. While we favor political independence all 
the way up to the presidential race, if there is not a mass 
united independent candidate for president we will still be 
building pressure from the grassroots.</p>

<p>We should keep in mind that while an independent progressive 
presidential challenge may be difficult to realize in 1996, 
by the year 2000 -- after electing a lot of independents on 
the local and Congressional levels especially -- it would be 
a natural.</p>

<p>The objective possibility is that by that time, we could be 
in a position to build a strong coalition people's party, 
greatly democratize the electoral process in America and 
launch a formidable challenge to the old parties of big 
business -- not only at the point of production, on the 
street and on campus, but at the ballot box as well. So let 
us take today's challenge very seriously, and take it to 
others, and help make the breakthroughs that are so possible 
in this period a reality.</p>
