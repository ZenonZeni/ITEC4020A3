The U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management (OCRWM) has produced a number of videotapes about the Nation's civilian radioactive waste management system.  OCRWM videos are available to the public free of charge through the OCRWM National Information Center.  You may order videos by calling 1-800-225-6972 (202-488-6720 in the Washington, D.C., area), or by <A HREF="/comments/compage1.htm">sending us a message</A>.<P>

<CITE>Geologic Disposal: Yucca Mountain Project (August 1996, Playing Time: 9:30)</CITE><P>
<P>
Presented in this video is an overview of the history of the Yucca Mountain Project and the geologic and engineering studies being conducted in the vicinity of Yucca Mountain, Nevada, and in the Exploratory Studies Facility.  The results of this scientific research will demonstrate whether Yucca Mountain could serve as the Nation's first geologic repository for spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste.  The video concludes with an explanation of the government approvals that must be obtained before a repository could become operational, and the periods of time required for repository construction, emplacement of the waste, and closure.<P>

<CITE>OCRWM 1996 Compilation Videotape (May 1996, Playing Time: 2 Hours)</CITE><P>
<P>
Eight videotapes have been compiled onto this one video to offer a wide view of various elements of the Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management Program.  The video segments include "Managing the Nation's Nuclear Waste," "Why Study Yucca Mountain?  To Solve an Environmental Problem," "Sample Management Facility," "Hydrology Research Facility," "Five Full-Scale Cask Tests," "Cultural Resources Program," "Radiation: Fact or Myth?", and "Traces of the Future" (listed below).<P>

<CITE>Traces of the Future: Lessons from Nature for Waste Disposal (Playing Time: 52:00)</CITE><P>
<P>
In this video, scientists explain how they are able to learn about the movement and transport of radionuclides in different types of rock and ground water by observing and studying naturally radioactive materials, such as uranium ore deposits, which have existed for millions of years.  International collaboration among scientists in conducting these natural analog studies, combined with laboratory studies, add confidence to the concept of deep geologic disposal.<P>

<CITE>Yucca Mountain Project New Work Update (August 1996, Playing Time: 8:00)</CITE><P>
<P>
This videotape presents an overview of the scientific activities made by the Yucca Mountain Project since January 1996.  Information is presented on tunneling and test alcove construction for the Exploratory Studies Facility, moisture patterns and dormant volcanoes in the Yucca Mountain area, and the progress being made toward completing the most significant elements of the Yucca Mountain study by 1998.<P>
<P>
<CITE>Yucca Mountain Project 1995 Year in Review (Playing Time: 9:00)</CITE><P>
<P>
This Year-in-Review videotape presents an overview of the significant progress made by the Yucca Mountain Project during 1995.  Highlights cover the Exploratory Studies Facility, the surface-based testing program, development of an Environmental Impact Statement for a potential repository at Yucca Mountain, and public outreach efforts.<P>
<P>
<CITE>Yucca Mountain Project Update: 1994 Year in Review (Playing Time: 7:00)</CITE><P>
<P>
This video reports on the recent scientific studies conducted during 1994 at Yucca Mountain, Nevada, to determine its suitability as a high-level radioactive waste repository.  Included is footage of the Tunnel Boring Machine that is being used to gather information on rock structures expected to be encountered in the Tunnel Boring Machine's pathway, seismic studies, and investigation of perched water.  The video also explains management initiatives at Yucca Mountain to ensure that studies stay on schedule and budget, and focus on information necessary to determine suitability and complete a license application.  Increased efforts to involve and inform the public about the scientific studies being carried out at Yucca Mountain are also described. <P><P></BODY></HTML>
