<p><b>VI. THE 1950's: HARSHER PENALTIES AND A NEW RATIONALE-THE
&quot;STEPPING STONE&quot; THEORY</b> </p>

<hr>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The 1950's witnessed the advent of an extremist legislative
policy with respect to drugs generally and marijuana in
particular. For the first time in our national history, there was
public interest in narcotic drugs. Apparently there had been an
increase in narcotic drug abuse in the late 40's, and the public
mind was ripe for the FBN propaganda. In the paranoid atmosphere
of the times, the call for harsher penalties was soothing.
Unfortunately, marijuana was caught in the turbulence of this
era. Although the pharmacological facts about the drug were
beginning to emerge, congressional furor was aroused by the novel
assertion, rejected by Commissioner Anslinger in 1937, that use
of marijuana led to use of harder drugs. This new plateau of
misinformation was to provide the base for continual escalation
of penalties and proliferation of offenses throughout the decade.
</p>

<hr>

<p><b>A. The Boggs Act and Its Progeny: The First Escalation</b> </p>

<p>In 1951 Congress passed the next major piece of federal
narcotics legislation-the Boggs Act .2 The importance of this
legislation is that provided much harsher penalties for all drug
violators. Also, for the first time on the federal level,
marijuana and other narcotics were lumped together as a result of
the Act's provision for uniform penalties for violators of either
the Narcotic Drugs Import and Export Act3 or the Marihuana Tax
Act.4 This indiscriminate treatment of marijuana as just another
narcotic drug flew in the face of contemporary testimony
challenging the assumption that the hemp drugs were addictive,
crime-producing, and likely to lead to insanity and death. New
testimony that marijuana was unlikely to be addictive was buried
under the new rationale for harsh penalties against offenders of
the marijuana laws-that the drug inevitably is the stepping stone
to heroin addiction. Eventually, the states followed the federal
lead in striking out against drug violators with the same
mindless fervor that characterized their anti-communist
campaigns. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>1. The Problem: Increased Narcotics Use</b> </p>

<p>The hearings before the Subcommittee of the House Ways and
Means Committee and the floor debate show that the primary reason
for passage of the Boggs Act was the increase in narcotic use in
the period 1948-1951. Testimony and evidence from a wide variety
of sources indicated an abrupt and substantial increase in
addiction, especially among teenagers, between 1947 and 1951.5
Young people under 21 who had rarely been addicts suddenly became
a predominant group involved in addiction and narcotics crimes.6
Representative Boggs, speaking during the congressional debates
on his bill, enunciated a concern which was reflected in many
other quarters. After noting that there had been a 24 percent
increase in arrests for narcotics violations between 1949 and
1950 and a 77 percent increase between 1948 and 1950,
Representative Boggs stated: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>The most shocking part about these figures is the fact
    that there has been an alarming increase in drug addiction
    among younger persons. In the first- 6 months of 1946, the
    average age of addicted persons committed . . . at Lexington,
    Ky. was 37.5 years. Only 3 patients were under the age of 21.
    During the first 6 months of 1950, only 4 years later, the
    average had dropped to 26.7 years, and 766 patients were
    under the age of 21.... [I]n New York City alone it has been
    estimated that 1 out of every 200 teenagers is now addicted
    to some type of narcotics.7 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Later he said, &quot;We need only to recall what we have read
in the papers in the past week to realize that more and more
younger people are falling into the clutches of unscrupulous dope
peddlers . . . .&quot; 8 </p>

<p>Representative Boggs then proceeded to insert in the record
eleven newspaper and magazine articles dated between May 2 and
July 16, 1951.9 The Washington Evening Star of July 16 (the day
of the debate) carried a story on the results of a mayor's
committee report on drug addiction in New York City. According to
the newspaper, &quot;between 45,000 and 90,000 persons in New
York City are using illicit dope.... Based on the city's
population of 7,835,099, that would be 1 out of every 87 or 1 out
of 174 persons.&quot; The paper indicated that the report showed
an increase in addiction among teenagers, and it called for
&quot;more severe penalties for dope sellers, and for wholesale
revisions of Federal and State penal statutes relating to
sale.&quot; </p>

<p>An article in Time magazine of June 25, 1951, inserted by Mr.
Boggs, related New York City School Superintendent William
Jansen's statement that one out of every 200 high school students
in the city was a user of habit forming drugs. The article went
on to describe the alarming increases in dope consumption&quot;
in other major cities and the ease with which school children
obtained narcotics. Another article, in the Washington Evening
Star of June 12, 1951, contained statements by a member of the
staff of the Attorney General of New York to the effect that
between 5,000 and 15,000 of New York City's 300,000 high school
students were drug addicts. To supplement the stock figures,
these articles included the testimony of witnesses who described
their own acts of prostitution and thievery, the loss of
educational opportunities, the death of addicts from &quot;hot
shots,&quot; the horrors of withdrawal, and a wide variety of
other aspects of drug abuse. </p>

<p>This evidence of increasing use of narcotics, especially among
the young, and the fear that narcotics use would continue to
spread, presented a problem that Congress felt needed a quick and
effective solution. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>2. The Solution: Harsher Penalties</b> </p>

<p>In the same way that the congressional hearings,
investigations and debates reflect the impetus for enactment of
the Boggs Act, they also reveal the official and public consensus
as to the solution-harsher penalties. Perhaps Commissioner
Anslinger best described the prevailing climate when he stated: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Short sentences do not deter. In districts where we get
    good sentences the traffic does not flourish.... </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>There should be a minimum sentence for the second offense.
    The commercialized transaction, the peddler, the smuggler,
    those who traffic in narcotics, on the second offense if
    there were a minimum sentence of 5 years without probation or
    parole, I think it would just about dry up the traffic.10 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This statement before the Committee was quoted by
Representative Boggs during the congressional debate on his bill,
along with the Kefauver Committee's recommendation that
&quot;mandatory penalties of imprisonment of at least 5 years
should be provided for second offenders.&quot; 11 Representative
Boggs indicated that his bill was to incorporate the Kefauver
Committee recommendations of mandatory minimum sentences for drug
peddlers and had as its principal purpose ... to remove the power
of suspension of sentence and probation in the cases of second
and subsequent offenders against the narcotics and marijuana
laws, and to provide minimum sentences .... 12 </p>

<p>Moreover, Representative Boggs and others supported the
mandatory minimum sentences because they felt some federal had
been lax in enforcing the narcotic laws 13 and because they
believed harsher penalties had reduced crimes, particularly
kidnapping and the white slave trade, in other areas.14
Representative Edwin Arthur Hall of New York urged substitution
of his bill, which provided for minimum sentences of 100 years
for dope peddlers.15 Although there was some opposition to the
Boggs Act, notably by Representative Celler, who thought that the
mandatory minimum sentence provision would be unjust for
addicts,16 the majority opinion was clearly that mandatory
minimum sentences were necessary to insure punishment of
peddlers.17 In response to Mr. Celler's contention that young
addicts could be subjected to long prison terms because of the
loss of judicial discretion in sentencing, Representative Jenkins
stated: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>The enforcing officers will always have sympathy for the
    unfortunate consumer, especially if he is harmless. These
    enforcing officers are going to protect the little boys and
    little girls. They are not going to drag the high school boys
    and girls before the criminal courts until they know that
    they are collaborating with the peddlers18 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Mr. Boggs presented a more reasonable justification for
mandatory minimums: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>[I]t is not the intention of this legislation to affect a
    teen-ager or any such person who has possession of narcotics.
    But the gentleman also knows that if we try to make a
    distinction between possession and peddling that we
    immediately open the law to all types of abuses.19 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Act as passed provided uniform penalties for violations of
the Narcotic Drugs Import and Export Act and the Marihuana Tax
Act. The penalties prescribed were: </p>

<p>First offense 2 - 5 years </p>

<p>Second offense 5 - 10 years </p>

<p>Third and subsequent offenses 10 - 20 years </p>

<p>Fine for all offenses $2,000.00 </p>

<p>The relatively low fines reflected a congressional belief that
monetary penalties were an insignificant deterrent.20 An
essential provision of the Act removed judicial discretion in
sentencing by providing that upon conviction for a second or
subsequent offense the imposition or execution of the sentence
could not be suspended nor probation granted. As in the nontax
predecessors of the Boggs Act since 1909 and the Marihuana Tax
Act, possession of a narcotic drug was sufficient for conviction
unless the defendant could explain the possession to the
satisfaction of the jury.21 </p>

<hr>

<p><b>3. Marijuana and the Boggs Act</b> </p>

<p>Congressional and public attention was clearly focused on hard
narcotics use, primarily the opiates. Judging from the recorded
proceedings, especially the floor debate in the House, marijuana
seems to have been along for the ride, much as it had been during
enactment of the Uniform Narcotic Drug Act. However, here there
was a conscious decision to include marijuana violations in the
new penalty provisions. Underlying this decision were
determinations that marijuana use had also increased during the
later 1940's, that it too was spreading to white teenagers, and
that the drug's dangers, warranted the harsh treatment
contemplated by the Act. </p>

<p>(a) Increased Use.-To test the allegation of an increase in
marijuana use during this period, we have used the seizure and
enforcement figures used by the proponents of the legislation.
These figures tend to sustain the hypothesis that marijuana
traffic increased from 1948 to 1951, following a decline
throughout the early 40's. However, the figures are also
consistent with other hypotheses, for example that improved
enforcement techniques and increased state-federal cooperation
had increased arrests. </p>

<p>Federal agents of the Narcotics Bureau began vigorously
enforcing the Marihuana Tax Act almost as soon as President
Roosevelt signed it into law. From October 1 to December 31,
1937, alone, the FBN made 369 seizures totaling 229 kilograms of
the drug.22 </p>

<p>Moreover, state officials made extensive seizures either in
conjunction with FBN agents or in pursuance of their newly-passed
state controls over marijuana's Marijuana seizures by federal
authorities hit their low point in 1945 when only 257 kilograms
were taken, 128 of which were seized by the FBN and the rest by
United States Customs agents .24 At this time the FBN had
approximately 180 agents.25 This low seizure figure suggests a
decrease in marijuana use throughout the early 1940 's.26 </p>

<p>Beginning in about 1948, however, the arrest and seizure 27
figures rose dramatically, the arrest figures rising 33 percent
from 1947 to 1948. These figures tend to corroborate the
Commissioner's assertion that there was a drastic increase in
narcotics use between 1948 and 1951 28 and to justify the
simultaneous calls for amendment of the narcotics and marijuana
laws.29 On the other hand, these figures could reflect increased
or I improved enforcement. For example, in 1949 the FBN had begun
to encourage the largest cities to form special narcotics squads
to deal especially with the drug problem.30 By 1951, however,
only New York and Los Angeles had formed the separate police
detail the FBN had requested .31 Thus even if one were tempted to
try to correct for improvements in the law enforcement machinery,
the seizure figures for the late 40's and 50's do sustain the
notion that the traffic in marijuana increased from 1948 to 1951.
</p>

<p>(b) Youthful Users.-As with the hard narcotics, Congress was
especially alarmed by the alleged spread of marijuana to white
teenagers and school children. Militating against this
proposition is evidence that marijuana use was not widespread
among the young as late as 1944. In that year, the famous La
Guardia Report reached the following conclusions among others:
Marijuana use was widespread in the Borough of Manhattan but
tended to be limited to certain areas, notably Harlem; the
majority of marijuana smokers were Negroes and Latin-Americans,
and marijuana smoking was not widespread among school children
.32 </p>

<p>The La Guardia study portrays marijuana use in this period as
a rather casual adjunct to ghetto life. Since it was not costly,
this euphoriant was well within the reach of ghetto residents. It
appears that throughout the early 40's marihuana use in the West
as well as in the East continued to be associated with the ethnic
minorities, especially in the inner city.33 </p>

<p>The fear that marihuana use would spread to white teenagers is
one that has recurred since the earliest legislative cognizance.
In fact, it was probably a factor in the early opium laws .34 We
have been unable to confirm whether the fear was justified at
this time, but in light of the documentation of increased
narcotics use among the young, we shall presume the same use
patterns to be true of marihuana. </p>

<p>(c) The Danger: A New Rationale.-The FBN had begun its
educational campaign for harsher marihuana penalties immediately
after passage of the Tax Act.&quot; In the early years, the
campaign was particularly effective with judges. For example, in
one of the first cases under the Tax Act, a Colorado judge
stated: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>I consider marihuana the worst of all narcotics-far worse
    than the use of morphine or cocaine. Under its influence men
    become beasts, just as was the case with [the defendant].
    Marihuana destroys life itself. I have no sympathy With those
    who sell this weed. In the future I will impose the heaviest
    penalties. The Government is going to enforce this new law to
    the letter.36 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The crime, pauperism and insanity rationale was accepted
unquestioningly as late as 1951.37 Under this rationale, harsher
penalties were certainly as imperative for marijuana offenders as
they were for opiate offenders. However, in a paper filed as an
exhibit to the hearings38 on the Boggs Act, Dr. Harris Isbell,
Director of Research at the Public Health Service hospital in
Lexington, Kentucky, exploded the traditional rationale. He
stated that marijuana was not physically addictive.39 Although he
postulated a definition of addiction which amounts to nothing
more than chronic intoxication 40 and noted the possibility of
&quot;temporary psychoses&quot; in &quot;predisposed
individuals,&quot; Isbell's description of marijuana was
extraordinarily favorable. Before the Kefauver Committee he
testified: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Marijuana smokers generally are mildly intoxicated,
    giggle, laugh, bother no one, and have a good time. They do
    not stagger or fall, and ordinarily will not attempt to harm
    anyone. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>It has not been proved that smoking marijuana leads to
    crimes of violence or to crimes of a sexual nature. Smoking
    marijuana has no unpleasant after-effects, no dependence is
    developed on the drug, and the practice can easily be stopped
    at any time. In fact, it is probably easier to stop smoking
    marijuana cigarettes than tobacco cigarettes. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>In predisposed individuals, marijuana may precipitate
    temporary psychoses and is, therefore, not an innocuous
    practice with them.41 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Dr. Isbell's statements that marijuana does not cause a
physical dependence were supported by other doctors, 42 prison
officials,43 and perhaps most significantly by the statement of a
number of narcotics addicts .44 </p>

<p>Despite this testimony the legislators approved greatly
increased penalties for marijuana users. The crucial reason for
this severe treatment can be seen in the following colloquy
during the House subcommittee hearings: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Mr. Boggs. From just what little I saw in that
    demonstration, I have forgotten the figure Dr. Isbell gave,
    but my recollection is that only a small percentage of those
    marijuana cases was anything more than a temporary degree of
    exhilaration .... </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Mr. Anslinger. The danger is this: Over 50 percent of
    those young addicts started on marijuana smoking. They
    started there and graduated to heroin; they took the needle
    when the thrill of marijuana was gone.45 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Many others -doctors ,46 crime prevention experts,47 police
and narcotics bureau officials48 -testified to the link between
marijuana use and ultimate heroin addiction. Representative Boggs
himself summed up this novel danger of marijuana in one of the
few statements even to mention marijuana in House floor debate: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Our younger people usually start on the road which leads
    to drug addiction by smoking marijuana. They then graduate
    into narcotic drugs-cocaine, morphine, and heroin. When these
    younger persons become addicted to the drugs, heroin, for
    example, which costs from $8 to $15 per day, they very often
    must embark on careers of crime . . . and prostitution . . .
    in order to buy the supply which they need.49 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The passage of this new Federal Act marked a significant shift
in rationale for the illegal status of marijuana; that status
became more entrenched by the indiscriminate lumping of marijuana
with the other narcotic drugs. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>4. The State Response: Mindless Escalation</b> </p>

<p>While the Boggs Act was still pending in Congress, the Bureau
of Narcotics encouraged the states to modify their existing
narcotic and marijuana legislation to enact &quot;penalties
similar to those provided for in the Boggs bill [which] would be
of material assistance in the fight against the narcotic
traffic.&quot; 50 Seventeen states (including Virginia) and the
Territory of Alaska responded by passing &quot;little Boggs
Acts&quot; by 1953, and eleven other states increased their
penalties by 1956. </p>

<p>In 1951, seven states and the Territory of Alaska passed
penalty provisions similar to those contained in the Boggs
Act.,51 In addition, nine other states amended their drug laws to
provide for more severe penalties, but the provisions were
neither uniform nor identical to those provided for under the
federal measure. 52 In 1952, four more states, including
Virginia, amended the penalty provisions of their drug laws to
bring them in line with the Boggs Act.53 Six more states followed
suit in 1953.54 Finally, in 1955 and 1956 two states, Ohio and
Louisiana respectively, enacted penalty provisions which were
substantially more severe than those passed previously in any
Jurisdiction.55 </p>

<p>The Virginia &quot;little Boggs Act&quot; was signed into law
on April 1, 1952 ,56 after having passed both houses
unanimously.57 The measure was regarded as routine, and as one of
the &quot;less controversial&quot; proposals to come before the
legislature during the 1952 session.58 It cleared the House on a
day when bills were being passed &quot;at the rate of about one a
minute during some periods&quot; 59 and won Senate approval
during the final rush to complete business in the waning hours of
the 1952 General Assembly. </p>

<p>The Act produced three basic changes in Virginia's scheme of
narcotics control. It added marijuana to those drugs whose sale
was forbidden under the state's version of the Uniform Narcotic
Drug Act; it created the new substantive crime of sale to a
minor; and it provided for harsher penalties for violations of
the drug laws.60 </p>

<p>Prior to 1952, the Virginia anti-marijuana provision was
separate from those provisions governing the sale of
&quot;hard&quot; drugs. But the 1952 Act repealed this provision
and included marijuana under the state's general narcotic control
law. As a result, a person illegally selling marijuana became
subject to the same penalties imposed upon a person legally
vending such drugs as heroin, morphine and cocaine .61 </p>

<p>The heart of the 1952 Act was the provision for stiffer
penalties for the violation of Virginia's general narcotic laws
prohibiting the sale of drugs without a prescription. For the
first offense, the penalty was imprisonment in the penitentiary
for not less than three nor more than five years plus a fine of
not more than $1,000. For the second offense, the penalty was
imprisonment for not less than five nor more than ten years and a
fine of not more than $2,000. For the third and succeeding
offenses, the penalties were fines of not more than $3,000 and
imprisonment for not less than ten nor more than twenty years. </p>

<p>The 1952 Act also made it a felony to sell, barter, peddle,
exchange or otherwise dispense marijuana or any other narcotic
drug to a minor. Any person found guilty of such offense was
subject to imprisonment for a term of not less than ten years nor
more than thirty years, no part of which could be suspended, and
a fine of not more than $ 1,000 for the first offense, $2,000 for
the second offense and $3,000 for the third and subsequent
offenses. Such a provision exemplifies the increased
sophistication of anti-narcotic legislation during the 1950's.
Thus, the continued escalation of penalties for drug law
violators was followed in Virginia. Moreover, despite the public
concern and attention in the national media, in Virginia it is
plain that the 1952 amendments to the narcotic laws passed
virtually unnoticed in the press .62 </p>

<hr>

<p><b>B. The Late 1950's: Another Escalation of the Penalties</b>
</p>

<p>Whether because use had decreased or because the propagandists
had accomplished their main mission, the narcotics problem
dropped almost entirely from public view after the Boggs Act was
passed. Nevertheless, state and federal police authorities, armed
with data suggesting that the strengthening of the drug laws had
at least halted the increase in drug use, pressed for further
increases in penalties in order entirely to root out the drug
menace. 63 Without significant debate or public interest,
Congress responded by passing the Narcotic Control Act of 1956
.64 </p>

<p>Although the legislators paid even less attention to marijuana
than they had in 1951, the precedent there established of
classifying marijuana with hard narcotics resulted in a
proliferation of marijuana offenses and a further increase in
penalties. In some ways, this legislation represents the
high-water mark of uninformed public policy regarding marijuana.
In almost every respect, the provisions of the Act and the
legislative motivation bear absolutely no rational relation to
marijuana's pharmacology and to the drug's actual use and traffic
patterns. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>I. Provisions of the Narcotic Control Act of 1956</b> </p>

<p>Public Law 728, an act intended to make more effective control
of the narcotic drugs and marijuana, was approved on July 18,
1956. It amended the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 and the
Narcotic Drugs Import and Export ACt65 primarily in the direction
of increasing still further the penalties for violation of those
acts and proliferating the scope of federal control over the use,
possession and sale of narcotic drugs and marijuana. </p>

<p>The new law raised the potential fine for all narcotics and
marijuana offenses to $20,000 66 and increased the mandatory
minimum sentences for offenses in the prescription, registration
and possession categories to two, five and ten years for
successive offenses.67 No distinction was made between addicts
and traffickers with regard to these types of violations.
Violations of the sale, transfer and smuggling provisions of the
Act carry a minimum sentence of five years for first offenses and
ten years for all subsequent offenses. 68 In this connection the
Act created a new offense by prohibiting illegal importation of
marijuana and forbidding knowing receipt, concealment, purchase,
sale, and facilitation of transportation or concealment of such
illegally, imported marijuana .69 Simple possession was by
statute sufficient evidence of guilt to convict.70 This
provision, now 21 U.S.C. § 176a, paralleled a similar
importation provision for narcotics originally passed in 1909. </p>

<p>In addition, any sale or transfer of any drug by an adult to a
was made punishable by a minimum ten-year sentence.71 Finally,
the Act made suspension, probation and parole unavailable to all
offenders except those convicted of a first offense for
possession, prescription or registration.72 </p>

<p>In addition to the increases in offenses and penalties, the
law contained wide variety of provisions relating to enforcement.
Customs and Narcotics Bureau agents were authorized to carry
weapons and to make arrests without a warrant on belief that a
drug violation had been committed .73 The Government was allowed
to appeal unfavorable decisions suppressing evidence74 and to
compel testimony from witnesses by a grant of immunity.75 In a
concession to those legislators who favored a wiretapping
provision, the new law created a category of offense based on the
use of communications instrumentalities in violation of the drug
laws.76 This provision carried penalties of a minimum two-year
sentence and up to a $5,000 fine. The Act required that citizens
who are drug users and drug law violators must register with the
immigration authorities upon entering or leaving the United
States .77 The Act also amended the Immigration and Nationality
Act to provide for deportation of alien drug users and drug law
violators .78 </p>

<hr>

<p><b>2. Marijuana-Along for the Ride</b> </p>

<p>The Narcotic Control Act of 1956 was premised on the same
beliefs as was the Boggs Act. Few if any of the legislators
recognized that marijuana was in any way different from the
physically addictive narcotics.79 The stepping stone concept was
now so widely accepted that only once during the extensive
congressional debates on the House and Senate versions of the
bill was the subject of marijuana as a separate substance even
raised. In a statement reflecting both ignorance of the basic
characteristics of marijuana and naive acceptance of the stepping
stone concept, Senator Daniel, Chairman of the Senate
subcommittee that investigated the drug problem, described
marijuana: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>That is a drug which starts most addicts in the use of
    drugs. Marihuana, in itself a dangerous drug, can lead to
    some of the worst crimes committed by those who are addicted
    to the habit. Evidently, its use leads to the heroin habit
    and then to the final destruction of the persons addicted.80 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because Congress bought the FBN's propaganda lock, stock and
barrel, it is not surprising that there was no dissent from the
proposition that harsher penalties were the means to eliminate
illicit use and sale of all drugs.81 </p>

<hr>

<p><b>3. Trafficking Patterns</b> </p>

<p>The 1956 Act reflected an unsupported conception of the nature
of the marijuana traffic. Under the assumption that
&quot;peddlers&quot; of all drugs, marijuana included, are
controlled by organized crime, the Act assessed extremely heavy
penalties for sale, especially to minors. For example, the House
Ways and Means Committee report noted that &quot;narcotic
traffickers ... are in most cases well organized professional
racketeers.&quot; 82 Similarly, in recommending prohibition of
probation or suspension of sentence for first-offender peddlers,
the House subcommittee had asserted that if the first offender
peddler problem was not solved, there would eventually be
&quot;large scale recruiting of our youth by the upper echelon of
traffickers.&quot; 83 </p>

<p>While the reference to organized crime was undoubtedly valid
with respect to hard drugs, the assumption that marijuana traffic
was controlled by large-scale racketeers was completely
unsupported. The marijuana distribution pattern today is far
different than the distribution pattern for &quot;hard&quot;
drugs. On college campuses today, the marijuana seller is likely
to be a smoker who has a small amount he wants to sell. Unless
one is to believe that organized crime has abdicated a
distribution role to &quot;amateurs,&quot; it is difficult to
imagine that it controlled the distribution of marijuana in 1956.
Accordingly, the 1956 Act's widely divergent treatment of sale
and use of marijuana may not have been justified at the time of
enactment, and it certainly makes little sense today. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>4. Origin and Use</b> </p>

<p>A related misconception about the marijuana trade concerns the
new importation offenses. Underlying the presumption of knowing
concealment of smuggled marijuana arising from possession are two
findings that the mainstay of marijuana traffic is imported from
Mexico and that possessors are likely to be aware of that fact.
Even in 1956, such findings were dubious.84 As to the presumption
of importation, Commissioner Anslinger's estimate that 90 percent
of all marijuana seized by federal authorities had been smuggled
from Mexico85 was grossly misleading. The Federal Bureau of
Narcotics had practically abandoned the responsibility for
marijuana control to increasingly effective state narcotics
squads and to the Customs agents.86 Of course, federal figures
taken alone would suggest a high percentage of importation.
Furthermore, the Commissioner's conclusion was inconsistent with
an essential premise of the Tax Act87 and with other materials
before the Congress,88 all of which emphasized the large degree
of domestic cultivation. </p>

<p>As to the possessor's knowledge, the underlying assumption
again was that there was an organized trade pattern so that each
user knew where his drug came from. As we know, marijuana was
then a casual adjunct to ghetto life. It was a social, rather
than an economic, phenomenon limited almost exclusively to
unemployed or menially employed members of racial minorities in
the center cities.89 As applied to such a class of people, the
presumption is farcical.90 </p>

<hr>

<p><b>5. Enforcement Patterns</b> </p>

<p>Although the proliferation of federal offenses suggests on its
face that state enforcement was inadequate to cope with marijuana
trade or that increased use of the drug presaged increased
narcotics addiction, nothing could be farther from the truth.
Considering marijuana alone, the 1956 legislation was passed in
response to no need at all. The enforcement statistics confirm
our hypothesis that marijuana was simply &quot;along for the
ride.&quot; </p>

<p>First, as we noted above, federal arrests declined continually
after 1952.91 Although attributable in part to increased state
enforcement92 and to a conscious FBN decision to concentrate on
narcotics, the figures do suggest a decline in or at least a
stabilization of marijuana use by the middle fifties, even in
areas in which narcotics use continued unabated. Second, the
class of users does not seem to have changed at all during this
period. Arrest statistics still indicate that use was centered in
the ghetto areas of major cities93 in California, Texas,
Louisiana, Michigan, New York, and Illinois.94 However, because
statistics were not refined according to race, age, sex and often
even the drug used,95 we cannot state categorically that there
was no change in use patterns. 96 </p>

<hr>

<p><b>6. The Epitome of Irrationality: Virginia's 1958 Amendment</b>
</p>

<p>In 1958, Virginia's Uniform Drug Act was further amended to
make the &quot;possession of illegally acquired narcotic drugs
[which included marijuana] in any quantity greater than
twenty-five grains, if in solid form, or eight ounces, if in
liquid form,&quot; a crime punishable by a fine of not more than
$5,000 and imprisonment for not less than twenty nor more than
forty years .97 The effect of this enactment was to provide a
penalty for illegal possession that was more than twice as severe
as the penalty for unlawful sale and one and one-half times more
stringent than that for sale to a minor. It is incredible that
despite the extreme <a name="last">harshness of this penalty, the
measure passed both houses of the General Assembly with but one
dissenting vote, and no mention was made of it in the Richmond
Times-Dispatch during the period of February 14 to April 7, 1958.</a>
</p>

<p>In conclusion, the Federal Narcotic Control Act of 1956 and
subsequent state legislation reflect the same basic congressional
and public misconceptions about the nature and dangers of
marijuana that characterized the early fifties. Even more
unchanged, and in fact strengthened by results under the Boggs
Act, was the assumption that the key to the solution of the
narcotic drug problem was the imposition of harsher penalties on
both users and traffickers in illicit drugs. Classification of
marijuana with narcotic drugs was now a foregone conclusion. In
fact, legislators seemed less aware that marijuana was a distinct
substance than they had been in 1951. </p>

<p>32 The conclusions of the <a href="../lag/lagmenu.htm">La
Guardia Report</a> are discussed in THE MARIHUANA PAPERS 277-410
(D. Solomon ed. 1966). The thirteen conclusions on the sociology
of marijuana use are so significant we include them in full: </p>

<p>From the foregoing study the following conclusions are drawn: </p>

<p>1. Marihuana is used extensively in the Borough of Manhattan
but the problem is not as acute as it is reported to be in other
sections of the United States. </p>

<p>2. The introduction of marihuana into this area is recent as
compared to other localities. </p>

<p>3. The cost of marihuana is low and therefore within the
purchasing power of most persons. </p>

<p>4. The distribution and use of marihuana is centered in
Harlem. </p>

<p>5. The majority of marihuana smokers are Negroes and
Latin-Americans. </p>

<p>6. The consensus among marihuana smokers is that the use of
the drug creates a definite feeling of adequacy. </p>

<p>7. The practice of smoking marihuana does not lead to
addiction in the medical sense of the word. </p>

<p>8. The sale and distribution of marihuana is not under the
control of any single organized group. </p>

<p>9. The use of marihuana does not lead to morphine or heroin or
cocaine addiction and no effort is made to create a market for
these narcotics by stimulating the practice of marihuana smoking.
</p>

<p>10. Marihuana is not the determining factor in the commission
of major crimes. </p>

<p>11. Marihuana smoking is not widespread among school children.
</p>

<p>12. Juvenile delinquency is not associated with the practice
of smoking marihuana. </p>

<p>13. The publicity concerning the catastrophic effects of
marihuana smoking in New York City is unfounded. Id. at 307. </p>

<p>33 The New York trend was also typical of Los Angeles.

Narcotic Menace, April 11 1940, at 12. See also Note, Youth and
Narcotics, 1 U.C.L.A. L. Rev. 445, 453 (1954) (reporting a
breakdown by race of narcotics arrests by the Oakland police
department). </p>

<p>34 For example, in 1895 New York had passed a statute, ch.
1041, 5 1, [1895 ] N.Y. Laws 972, requiring instruction in public

the House Comm. on Ways and Means. 82d Cong., 1st Sess. 147
(1951) [hereinafter cited as Boggs Act Hearings). </p>

<p>39 Dr. Isbell's paper stated: </p>

<p>Any definition [of addiction] which makes dependence an
essential feature will also not include intoxications with such
substances as cocaine, marijuana, and amphetamine. because
dependence on these substances is no more marked than is
dependence on tobacco and coffee and yet, in some ways,
intoxication with cocaine or marijuana is more harmful than is
addiction to morphine. Furthermore, definitions which exclude
cocaine and marijuana from the list of addicting drugs would
cause endless confusion because, in common parlance and legally,
both drugs arc regarded as addicting. </p>

<p>49 97 CONG. REC. 8197-98 (1951). The linkage of marijuana use
to heroin was also supplied by sonic of the testimony by addicts
themselves. Of 27 addicts interviewed in part 14 of the Kefauver
Committee Hearings, 15 testified that they had started their drug
use with marijuana. This figure is misleading because a
substantial majority of the 12 who had not used marijuana were
addicts because of illness or were older addicts who had begun
using drugs before marijuana was readily available. See Kefauver
Committee Hearings, pt. 14, at 11, 29, 54, 62, 71, 84, 93, 99,
104, 108, 153, 157, 160, 162, 167, 171, 182, 189, 194, 203, 211,
216, 220, 367, 380, 432, 436. Approximately 5 of the addict
witnesses indicated that marijuana did in fact lead to the use of
the harder drugs but only one gave definite reasons why he
thought this transition inevitably took place. One male addict,
after stating that the average age of marijuana smokers was 13 or
14, stated: </p>

<p>You would very seldom find a person smoking marijuana who does
just that, he keeps on, and he gets to the point where he does
not have the same drive or feeling that he first had, and it is
like a stepping stone, he graduates to heroin. Kefauver Committee
Hearings, pt. 14, at 199-200. </p>

<p>Note that among many of these addicts curiosity and peer group
pressure was the primary factor in starting them into the use of
hard drugs. Id. at 12, 32, 94, 109, 254. Moreover, Representative
Boggs introduced some mystery into his statements during the
House debates by stating: </p>

<p>A study in February of 1950 of 602 case reports indicates that
53 percent . . . started their addiction to drugs by reason of
association with other addicts, and 7 percent of them started on
marijuana. </p>

<p>97 CONG. REC. 8197 (1951). This study is cited on the same
page with Representative Boggs' statement that our young people
usually start on the road to drug addiction by smoking marijuana.

so testified before a state legislative committee. For more of
the same, see W. OURSLER &amp; L. SMITH, NARCOTICS: AMERICA'S
PERIL 266 (1952). The Missouri case parallels the Virginia data
in that great public concern is expressed about the possible
spread of narcotics addiction but little if any separate notice
was given marijuana. Everywhere the narcotics evil was linked by
veiled references to international communism, especially that of
China, the traditional home of the opium habit. </p>

<p>79 The House Subcommittee on Narcotics, which produced what
became the essentials of the Narcotic Control Act of 1956,
revealed its knowledge of the distinction between marijuana and
narcotics solely by a footnote to the major heading
&quot;Narcotics&quot; which stated in fine print that the term
narcotics included marijuana. See U.S. CODE CONG. &amp; Am News
3294 (1956). </p>

<p>80 102 GONG. REC. 9015 (1956). </p>

<p>81 Representative Boggs, father of the Boggs Act and Chairman
of the Subcommittee on Narcotics of the House Ways and Means
Committee, stated that '[e]ffective steps to eliminate the
unlawful drug traffic requires ... the imposition of severe
punishment by the courts.&quot; Id. at 10689. The subcommittee,
which had set out to determine the effect of the Boggs Act on
narcotics traffic, U.S. CODE CONG. &amp; AD. News 3291 (1956),
began its recommendations with calls for further increases in the
penalties for narcotics law violations. Id. at 3309. In fact, the
subcommittee felt that this was the only way to eliminate the
drug menace, and recommended that educational programs on the
evils of narcotics not be instituted in the schools for fear of
exciting the curiosity of young people. Id. at 3305. Both the
House Ways and Means Committee report and the subcommittee report
are filled with statements to the effect that harsher penalties
are the most effective weapons in the war against illicit
narcotics. Id. at 3281-3303 passim. The Ways and Means Committee
conclusion was succinct: &quot;Experience with the Boggs law . .
. has clearly demonstrated the efficacy of severe punishment in
reducing the illicit commerce in drugs.&quot; Id. at 3286. </p>

<p>Finally, Senator Daniel, speaking for the Senate subcommittee
investigating the drug situation in the United States, found
&quot;it absolutely necessary for the Congress of the United
States to strengthen the hands of our law enforcement officers
and provide higher penalties if we are to stop the narcotics
traffic in this country.&quot; 102 CONG. Rec. 9014 (1956). His
subcommittee also recommended the kind of across-the-board
increases in penalties that the Act eventually contained. </p>

<p>82 U.S. CODE CONG. &amp; AD. News 3283 (1956); see id. at
3302. </p>

<p>83 Id. at 3304. </p>

<p>84 In holding unconstitutional the presumption of knowledge
that marijuana was smuggled, the Supreme Court in Leary v. United
States, 395 U.S. 6 (1969), relied on the change in use patterns
from 1959 to 1967. We think the presumption was unconstitutional
when passed in 1956, both as to importation and knowledge. </p>

<p>85 Daniel Committee Hearings 18. </p>

<p>86 The decline in the number of FBN arrests and seizures is
directly related to the increase in local and state enforcement
personnel. This thesis is supported by data from California where
statewide arrests soared while federal arrests remained stable.
Bureau of Criminal Statistics, California Dep't of Justice, Crime
in California (1956). See also A. LiNDESMITH, THE ADDICT AND THE
LAW 238 (1963). One commentator has suggested that except for the
years immediately after the passage of the Marihuana Tax Act,
when the Bureau wanted to concentrate on its newly acquired
enforcement field, the FBN arrest data show clearly its emphasis
on the hard narcotics. Mandel, Problems with Official Drug
Statistics, 21 STAN. L. REV. 991, 1019-20 (1969). </p>

<p>87 See note 20 at p. 1053 supra. </p>

<p>88 Written materials inserted into the record of the Senate
hearings included the testimony of an experienced federal Customs
official that high quality marijuana was being grown near the
Texas cities of Laredo and Brownsville. Daniel Committee Hearings
3488-89. In addition, the Attorney General of Ohio noted that
marijuana may grow unnoticed along roadsides and vacant lots in
many parts of the country.&quot; Id. at 4814. Also, a bulletin
issued by the Philadelphia Police Academy recited that
&quot;[plenty of marijuana is found growing in this city.&quot;
Id. at 599. </p>

<p>89 Blum, Mind-Altering Drugs and Dangerous Behavior: Dangerous
Drugs, in THE PRESIDENT'S COMMISSION ON LAW ENFORCEMENT AND
ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE, TASK FORCE REPORT: NARCOTICS AND DRUG
ABUSE 21, 24 (1967); Bouquet, Cannabis, 3 U.N. BULL. ON
NARCOTICS, Jan. 1951, at 22, 32-33. </p>

<p>90 This is especially true with respect to the young and black
minorities. The presumption has validity only as applied to
recently immigrated Mexicans. Cf. Chein, The Status of
Sociological and Social Psychological Knowledge Concerning
Narcotics, in NARCOTIC DRUG ADDICTION PROBLEMS 146, 155 (R.
Livingston ed. 1963). Mr. Chein reports a shift in drug use from
1930-1960 from old to young and a continued increase in the
percentage of drug users who are Black or Spanish-speaking. </p>

<p>91 The number of federal arrests for marijuana violations fell
from 1288 in 1952 to 169 in 1960. TRAFFIC IN Opium 26 (1952); id.
at 69 (1960). </p>

<p>92 By 1954, many major states and cities had special narcotics
squads. See Daniel Committee Hearings 13 -14, 1 10. </p>

<p>93 Cf. TRAFFIC IN Opium 66 (1956); id. at 41 (1959). The FBN
charts show clearly the extraordinary incidence of drug abuse
among Blacks, Mexican-Americans and other minority communities. </p>

<p>94 Daniel Committee Hearings, exhibit 7, at 267-71. Local
arrests in those six states accounted for 2,822 of the 3,205
marijuana arrests made by local law enforcers in 1954. </p>

<p>95 For example, the statistics in TRAFFIC IN Opium seldom even
distinguish among the drugs involved, and the FBI Uniform Crime
Statistics frequently report all drug related arrests together,
with no delineation of the type of drug used or the nature of the
offender. </p>

<p>96 Chein, supra note 90, at 152, suggests that whatever
patterns of drug use existed in the fifties were merely
continuations of patterns observed in the thirties. </p>
