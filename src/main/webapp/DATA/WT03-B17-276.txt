<PRE><STRONG><H2>  Understanding The Soil</H2></STRONG>
     When you understand the type of soil in which your lawn is to grow
or  is  already growing, then you can begin to create a soil  structure
which  is  better  suited for proper plant growth. Soil  supplies  air,
water,  nutrients,  and  physical support to plants.  Soil  also  needs
organic  matter to keep it alive. Each type of soil needs  a  different
amendment.  Sand,  clay,  and silt, in varying amounts,  determine  the
texture of the soil. Compost will help to bind soil particles and  hold
water  to the soil. Water is also important for productivity. Too  much
or  too  little  water hinders proper plant growth.  In  addition,  the
presence of earthworms aids in maintaining good soil structure.
     Use only organic materials. Increase organic matter. Use manure as
a  top  dressing.  Use organic fertilizers. Lawns love compost... 1.  Lawns
love rock dust. Blend the two together for best results.

             <STRONG><H2>  "There are two ways to sterilize the soil
                                by Heat
                           and  Chemically"</H2></STRONG>
     Chemical  fertilizers kill off the beneficial  soil  bacteria,  as
well as killing off earthworms and therefore should not be used, should
be  avoided  at all costs!   In this environment, the lawn  and  its  bio-
system  will  be  operating under stress. Stress is the most  important
factor in pest control.
     Whenever  the lawn is under stress, several things have  occurred:
1:  Proper Food is not being made available to the lawn.   2: The Humus
levels have dropped below optimum.   3: Water effects stress. Too  much
or  too little water will cause stress in the lawn (chlorinated water is
bad for the soil). 4: High nitrogen fertilizers kill the soil and cause
a great deal of stress. Avoid using Urea at all costs.
Understanding The Environment
     More than any other element of climate, temperature will determine
which  type  of  lawn  will grow where. Available  sunshine  and  water
(either  in the form of rain or humidity) round things out.   An  example
of  this  is: if irrigation is unavailable, only certain desert species
of  lawns  can be grown. It is a good idea to consult a gardening  book
which  has a map broken into climatic zones. This will help to simplify
the process of deciding which grasses you should consider.
