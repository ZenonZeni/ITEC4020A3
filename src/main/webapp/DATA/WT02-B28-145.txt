<STRONG>Government</STRONG><BR>
The Government Portfolio seeks a high level of current income consistent with
safety of
principal. It
invests primarily in U.S. Government securities, including Treasury bills, notes,
and bonds,
and
obligations of the U.S. Government or its agencies. Although the securities held
within this
portfolio are
guaranteed by the U.S. Government or an agency, the value of the portfolio's shares
is not
insured and
will fluctuate. Choose this investment alternative if you seek a conservative
investment with
relatively low
risk. (Managed by MacKay-Shields Financial Corporation)
<P>

<STRONG>Bond</STRONG><BR>
The Bond Portfolio invests primarily in investment grade, fixed-income securities
including
U.S.
Government bonds, U.S. Government agency obligations and corporate bonds. This fund
may also
invest in lower-rated securities, convertible debt, and preferred stock. By
investing in
various grades of
debt securities, this portfolio seeks to earn long-term income while preserving
capital. You
should
consider this investment option if you want a relatively conservative approach to
income and
capital
preservation and are willing to accept some market risk. (Managed by New York Life
Insurance
Company)
<P>
<STRONG>Total Return</STRONG><BR>
The Total Return Portfolio seeks to realize current income consistent with
reasonable
opportunity for
future growth of capital and income. It invests in a combination of stocks, bonds,
or money
market
instruments, depending on market conditions. By investing in a broad range of
securities,
this portfolio
seeks to reduce the risks associated with market volatility. This investment
alternative may
be right for
you if you want the opportunity for attractive growth and income while accepting
some risk
exposure.
(Managed by MacKay-Shields Financial Corporation)
<P>
<STRONG>Value</STRONG><BR>
The Value Portfolio seeks to realize maximum long-term total return from a
combination of
capital
growth and income investments. It invests in common stocks that are, in the
portfolio
manager's
opinion, undervalued at the time of purchase. The portfolio typically invests in
dividend-paying stocks,
but will also invest in non-dividend paying stocks. This portfolio may be right for
you if
you are seeking
an equity investment that focuses on growth from both capital appreciation and
dividend
income, and if
you are willing to assume the associated risks. (Managed by MacKay-Shields
Financial
Corporation)
<P>
<STRONG>Socially Responsible</STRONG><BR>
The Socially Responsible Portfolio seeks capital growth through investment in
enterprises
that make a
significant contribution to society through their products, services, and the way
they do
business. The
portfolio seeks to achieve a total return above the rate of inflation through an
actively
managed portfolio
of stocks and bonds of socially responsible companies plus money market
instruments. You
should
consider this investment option if you are seeking growth which may outpace
inflation and if
you prefer
to invest in companies that show a concern for social issues. The Socially
Responsible
Portfolio is not
a portfolio of the MFA Series Fund, Inc. (Managed by Calvert Asset Management
Company,
Inc.)<P>
