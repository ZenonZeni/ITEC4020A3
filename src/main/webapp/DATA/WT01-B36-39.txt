<h4>CHAPTER TEN</h4>

<h3>THE CAPITAL OF KINGDOM COME</h3>
</center>

<hr width="50%">

<h4>1969</h4>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The anti-diluvian DC-9 swam through a sea of milk
all the way from Delhi. It was only just before landing that the
clouds cleared for an instant and I saw the magical city of
Kathmandu cradled by the snowy ranges of the Himalaya&#151;a
non-euclidian landscape of terraced paddy fields surrounding a
dream form of pagoda-like temples and golden palaces, rising into
view and spinning from the horizon as the plane circled to land. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I was thirty-eight, on my first visit to Asia with
New York left well behind, carrying a typewriter, some
hand-baggage, a few hundred trips of Californian 'sunshine' acid
which a friendly psychiatrist laid on me, and about $1000 left
from a colour video movie I made about tripping to the moon. It
was July 16, 1969, and my pilgrimage was destined to begin at the
precise moment of the Apollo 11 blast-off for man's first landing
on the moon. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; At a more ordinary level, it was, I gathered later,
absolutely the wrong time to visit Kathmandu, as the monsoon was
imminent; the air was stifling with humidity and the bumpy taxi
ride from the airport made me sick; and I longed for some
air-cooled Manhattan bar where a couple of iced lagers could
revive a sorely tried spirit. Whatever expectations of romance I
had nursed had been shrivelled in the heat by the time I reached
my hotel. I had the insane urge at this point to drive straight
back to the airport and continue to Bangkok, settle down to a
routine English-teaching job, get rid of my beard and long hair,
become super-straight, like my friends Al Cohen and Richard
Alpert, and maybe continue to Australia &#133; but as the beauty
of the valley began to exercise its subtle magic through the
windows of my room, I just knew that this was indeed the one
place in or out of this world where I wanted to be. I took a
bath, changed into a Tibetan shirt and Indian <i>dhoti</i>&#151;a
sort of bin cloth you wrap around yourself&#151;smoked a couple
of chillums of good Afghani dope; and nearly fainted in dream of
dreams. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The view through my window was brilliant with the
afternoon sun. Amazement was the first element of my muted
delight at these bright green paddyfields between myself and the
snowcapped ranges still visible through the shimmering heat; and
mystery, of what lay beyond them, unseen&#151;the distant
half-chartered ranges of Tibet, home of the fable-seeking
imagination. The spell of the Himalayas was upon me. The beauty
of my surroundings began to penetrate a hardened carapace, for
these mountains had begun to exercise a magic thraldom all their
own. And now I was part of it. In some way which I could not
rationally explain, I just knew that I was gazing at the
mysterious container of the history of the world, the magical
amphitheatre in which Siva dances with Nataraja. I was a visitor
in the ancient land of gods and abode of <i>rhishis, tapaswis,
sadhakars,</i> saints and philosophers who come to meditate in
glacial deserts to make their beings as pure as the snow which
covers the tops of their sacred mountains and their minds as
clear and transparent as the water of the holy lakes... they
offered their adherents a way of life, a path to happiness: <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'In the body as it is in reality are contained all
worlds, mountains, continents and seas, the sun and the other
constellations . . . ' says the <i>Pretakalpa</i> of <i>Garuda-Purana.</i>
I also had a sense of what was meant in the passage from the
Hindu epic <i>Ramayana:</i> 'He who but thinks of the Himalayas
does greater things than he who is destined to tarry in Benares'.
And, by implication, he who tarries in Canterbury, Rome, Salt
Lake City, Belfast, and Jerusalem. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I realised with an immediacy akin if not identical
with revelation that I had travelled halfway across the world to
find in Kathmandu what I sought in vain throughout my wanderings
in the West. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There were certain immediate needs, however, like
scoring some local hashish, for which Nepal was rightly famed.
And some more suitable clothes. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It was still early, and even if it was like a
furnace outside, I decided to venture forth into the maze of
dusty streets and alleyways, all somewhat reminiscent of the
imaginary Baghdad of <i>The Arabian Nights.</i> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The city is not very large and within a matter of
minutes I found myself in the central square. It was like
something out of the Middle Ages, with street vendors sitting by
their piles of cloth and vegetables and boxes of cheap ornamental
beads, with enough activity going on to keep the eye fully
occupied. A huge bull emerged suddenly from the crowd, sedate and
reasonable, wandering with the scores of shoppers, even
defecating without so much as a pause, unnoticed, except, that
is, by myself. The houses were of red brick, all built in a
strange pagoda style which eliminated straight lines, with
latticed windows and overhanging balconies, many with hanging
potted plants. There were temples and delicate <i>stupas</i>,
huge sculptured statues, beautifully proportioned by some
anonymous race of master artists. The faces of these deities seem
self-absorbed in contemplation; sharp cheeks and supple chins in
the case of the male gods, and sweetly smiling lips, sensitively
sloping fleshy cheeks with elegant curves in the case of the
females. Some of the faces had been almost worn away through the
passage of time, which gave them a special mystery. Yet each
one&#151;and there were hundreds&#151;was strangely complete in
itself and fostered the message of the divine. But what was
interesting was to see how they were still objects of veneration
and worship by the people. There was one in particular that
caught my eye, a sculpture of the god Vishnu, the divine ruler of
the <i>Hindu Triad;</i> the face looked serious, with just the
right degree of rectitude and probity as befitted his position.
He had ear ornaments hanging above his shoulders and had all the
traditional attributes or <i>ayudas</i>&#151;the crown, the
necklace, the garland of flowers and the hip-belts, all
exquisitely shaped; the upper garment, the sacred thread or <i>yajnopavita</i>,
and the <i>dhoti</i> were emphasised with oblique lines through
the chisel-marks. In front was a rounded platform, a stone, for
rubbing and making <i>chandana</i> paste from sandalwood. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It was a glimpse of this Other World, of something
that I had seen and read about but had never had direct
experience of before. Here I could actually feel this something. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I still had to score some hash and get a Tibetan
shirt or two and a <i>dhoti.</i> I also wanted to discard my
shoes. I remembered that someone had told me that Rana's teashop
was a good place to score so along I went. It was up a tiny
alley, dustbin dirty and smelling of cow shit and urine. Outside
sat a small boy, a beggar, and I gave him a handful of rupees
before I went inside. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Rana's was an extraordinary place. There was pop
music on twin speakers, very loud, and a few stone-topped tables
at which were gathered a group of perhaps fifteen young
Westerners, silent, smoking chillums, and oblivious. They were
dressed in a gay medley of Indian, Tibetan and Nepalese costumes,
bedecked with beads and beards. One of them looked up, smiled,
and handed me a chillum, which I smoked. The effect was
instantaneous&#151;I almost passed out, and had to sit down. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I don't know how long I remained seated at the
table, perhaps an hour, perhaps two. The hash was the strongest
I'd ever had and completely immobilised me. Rana, the dapper
young Nepalese owner of the place, would come over every now and
then and ask if there was anything more I wanted. 'Tea?' or
'Porridge?' I merely shook my head and continued just sitting in
my utter stupor.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Finally, I was able to stand up, and I indicated to
Rana that I'd like to buy some of his hashish. He brought out a
simple handheld set of scales and weighed a <i>tola</i>&#151;about
one-third of an ounce&#151;which cost me about four shillings.
Then I split. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I was still in somewhat of a daze when I got back
to my hotel, and had to lie down again. It was dark when I
awakened. I decided to undress and go to bed. It was only eight
o'clock, but there was really nothing I could or wanted to do. I
was completely stoned. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I awoke at daybreak. The bright yellow sun flooded
through my windows and I felt wonderful. Today would be a good
day. And, as things turned out, it was. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I made a telephone call to the Royal Palace to talk
to Narayan Shrester, private secretary to the Crown Prince, who I
had known in Cambridge, Massachusetts, about one year ago. He
seemed pleased to hear that I was in Kathmandu, and said he'd
drop by the hotel to see me. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Narayan dropped by for lunch. He showered me with
smiles and greetings and love. And we had a great reunion,
recalling our past meetings at Harvard and lots of questions
about why I had come to Kathmandu. 'Why Kathmandu ? Surely there
must have been somewhere else?' was a characteristic question,
for I'm sure his own dream fantasies of paradise cities were
directed towards Paris or even San Francisco. I told him I'd come
in order to sort out 'my priorities', to gain a new amplitude, to
enjoy the experience of living in a foreign country, things like
that. I told him that even in the short space of twenty-four
hours I could not only see but actually <i>feel</i> that
indigenous and elusive quality in Nepalese life. It was that
quality, which hitherto I had only been told about but could
never really experience, which indeed has yet to be expressed
outside the occasional rare poem. He thought I should write a
book about Nepal. Then we laughed. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; During the lunch I brought up the matters of my
visa. I had, I told him, about $1000, and lots of enthusiasm
about starting a poetry magazine in Kathmandu. I had even got the
title&#151;<i>Flow.</i> I reminded him that one of the things we
had chatted about in America was the phenomenon of hippies and
how I had taken him around the various colleges and to private
homes so that he might better understand the new life-styles now
emerging in America and in Europe&#151;many tied into oriental
religions. Narayan&#151;who has a degree in English from Leeds
University had been tutor to the Crown Prince (now King Bihrendra
of Nepal), and I had been anxious for the Crown Prince to also
appreciate that, if these developments were to continue, new
possibilities for religious-minded Westerners would have to be
developed in India and Nepal, the two Asian countries which had
perhaps most to teach. Hippies were not long-haired layabouts in
most instances, but had chosen to spend some time in the East
living with and through the ordinary people, or in <i>Ashrams</i>
or monasteries; they had come to learn, as seekers, not as
tourists with lots of dollars to spend. And I was one of them. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He said that he'd discuss the matter of my stay
with the Crown Prince, and that I would be hearing from him the
next day. He envisaged no difficulty. As it turned out, I
received a year's visa, extendable at any time should I wish to
stay on in Nepal. It was something I had cause to be very, very
grateful for indeed, as visa formalities can and usually do
involve a certain amount of hassle with the authorities, with
something like six weeks considered to be about the average
length of stay permitted at that time. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Narayan had a little Volkswagen and offered to drop
me somewhere. I said I'd like to see one of the museums, so he
drove me a mile or two outside the city to the National Museum
near SwayambhuNath, one of the Holy Buddhist Centres of Nepal. He
himself had to get back to the Palace. He had given up his job as
English Lecturer at Tribhuvan University and was now private
secretary to the Crown Prince&#151;which meant he had to work
that much harder! <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The exterior of the museum was in the traditional
Nepalese style of architecture and beautifully preserved. And as
I walked around inside, gazing at the sculptured Hindu Gods, the
bronze figures of the Goddess Curga, prayer necklaces of <i>Rudraksa</i>
beads, incense burners shaped as the tree of life, and paintings,
I was glimpsing into a past that was still very much a living
present, for here was a highly developed, sophisticated art
tradition that had reached perfection when Nepal had been the
flower of a great Asian civilisation. I looked at the statue of
Vishnu, this one dating from the fifteenth or sixteenth
century&#151;it was very massive and majestic, standing
completely erect on a bold-relief lotus-flower, and flanked on
either side by his two female consorts. The female deity at his
right hand held a chalara or 'fly-whisk' (I suppose that even the
most powerful of Gods were not totally immune to the ubiquitous
valley mosquito) and a lotus flower. The female at his left
carried a lyre in her hands pressed closely against the breasts
and the belly. But the real beauty was in the faces and forms of
Vishnu's consorts&#151;their slender waists and exceptionally
beautiful and delicate breasts conveyed their profound feminine
frailty.... <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; At closing time I stepped out once more into a
daytime present 'when the mountains were again the mountains; the
clouds were again the clouds'. A car sped by on the tiny road in
front of the museum. I suppose I <i>could</i> have been run over.
For what I was still experiencing was this profound sense of
somehow living the continuation of a glorious past in the
present&#151;which is something that no Western museum had ever
done for me, being, for the most part, 'dead' places. I don't
think I shall ever again experience anything more radiant than my
visions of that afternoon in my life. I just knew that I should
no longer feel 'alone', which is to live in my own naked
spiritual reserves, that the body-mind was capable of being
filled up again with the light through the simple process of
looking. How easy it all seemed. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I ambled along the road like an old priest,
stopping now and again to observe the view, the bloom of a wild
rose, a particularly wondrous cloud structure. And since I was
walking in the direction of the Buddhist temples of Swayambhu, I
decided to proceed into the village. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But first a stop at the <i>chi</i> or teashop.
There was a group of heads sitting on a bench outside, chewing
the breeze, smoking the indigenous chillums, and several more
inside, in the cavernous half-light. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; No one was talking much; it was considered a
'downer'&#151;bad form&#151;to use words, but communication was
no less intense for all that. The young Nepalese owner came
outside with a mug of thick tea, dark brown and very sweet, and
asked if I'd like anything. I shook my head. He smiled, and
disappeared into the dark interior of his teashop. The fellow
sitting next to me passed me a joint. His eyes stared at me
widely, his mouth still hung open as if to keep the last word of
his sentence in mid-air. Everyone here believes in all the magic,
I thought. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I took a couple of deep tokes. 'Good grass,' I
said, handing him back his huge seven-skin joint. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He looked at me. And I was reminded of a French
poem I'd read somewhere &#133; 'in the depths of a dilated pupil
shines the lamp of the poor'. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As I got up to leave, he asked whether I'd been to
the <i>Bakery Ashram</i> yet, and he pointed to a small
passageway between two buildings. 'Just follow the path and take
a left when you get to the temple. They've got a new sound
system.' <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Since I was stoned anyway, and since I had nothing
particularly to do, I decided to follow the path to the <i>Ashram.</i>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I heard the electronic music quite clearly through
the natural sound of Buddhist chanting outside the temple, and,
following the path, came suddenly upon a compound garden filled
with lots of young Western heads, all dressed in their <i>dhotis</i>
and Tibetan shirts and Indian silks. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The <i>Ashram</i> comprised two principle
buildings, one, a former factory of the now bankrupt SwayambhNath
Bakery concern, and the other, a long shed. And it was from the
shed that the sounds came. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Inside, seated quietly in a circle round a central
fireplace, were about twenty people, mostly male. There were
several chillums being passed around simultaneously. Room was
quietly made for me to join this charmed circle. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The two five-feet Sony speakers made all verbal
communication impossible. It was like sitting on stage with the
Stones. The sound of the music eclipsed all cognitive function.
It was like a river into which you had been plunged. And all you
need do was float, float, F-l-o-a-t. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Hours&#151;maybe even days&#151;passed in an
instant. Time ceased to exist for those of us who sat stoned in
our mystical ring round the fire. And it was with this insight
that I was born into a new world. A new form of consciousness had
taken over, that we were somehow all together because in some
strange way we had been <i>brought</i> here. It was as though a
gust of wind had come from another existence, and had plucked us
from the streets of Rome and London and Detroit, and propelled us
to this Himalayan valley; our new myth-mother. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It had grown dark outside, and the people who had
been in the garden, now crowded inside the <i>Ashram.</i> The
smell of food from the far-end, invisible through the haze of
wood-smoke and hashish reminded me that I had not eaten all
afternoon. Soon there were people sitting around with plates on
their laps eating rice and vegetables with chopsticks. I saw a
line of people with empty plates in their hands, so I got up and
joined them. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The <i>Ashram</i> provided one sensible meal a day,
in the evening which cost one rupee to anyone who could afford
it, otherwise it was free; tea was a few cents extra. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; After we had eaten dinner, the poet Kristof walked
across to the record player and switched it off. He returned to
his place in the circle. There was a hush, a stillness, a sense
of expectancy. Kristof announced that he was going to read a
'love poem', which he had just finished writing. Everyone looked
up smiling when Kristof finished; he was assuredly one of their
verbal magicians. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It was a strange place this salamandrine <i>Ashram</i>
of glassy eyes staring from fiery lake beside the sound of music
through my leafy dreams &#133; but soon the speakers were back on
again at full blast, so I decided to make my way back to the
hotel. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It was dark when I stepped outside, and it was with
great difficulty that I found my way down and on to the road
again. Swayambhu is about two miles from the city, and I walked
slowly, savouring the stillness; no sound from anywhere; even the
dogs were quiet as I made my way through the maze of tiny streets
and alleyways. The city was almost deserted, yet it could not
have been much later than ten o'clock. It reminded me of the City
of London at night or downtown New York, after the crowds of
office workers had long since gone, the same sort of eerie
stillness. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Back in my hotel room, I smoked a nocturnal chillum
and then got into bed with a manuscript translation of some poems
by the Nepalese master poet, Bhanubhaka Archarya, which Narayan
had left with me. There was an interesting description of
Kathmandu a century or so back which the poet compared with the
Celestial City of Alaka (the god of wealth); he also noted its
resemblance to Lhasa, Lucknow and <i>London.</i> And it was with
these images in my mind that I fell asleep. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I was awakened in the morning by a knock at the
door. I stumbled out of bed and opened the door, expecting to
find a cleaning-woman. But, no, it was a young, handsome man who
introduced himself in perfect English as Madhusudan Thakur from
Northern India, a Brahmin, and former English lecturer at
Tribhuvan University, Kathmandu, and a Sanskrit scholar. He had
been given my name by Narayan, who had suggested we might have
much in common. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I apologised for the state of my book-strewn room
and invited him in. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Madhu, as he called himself, began to tell me a bit
about his life. He had studied English in Canada for three years,
and was now into translating Nepalese poetry into English. He was
also working on some Sanskrit translations. But what fascinated
him most was the increasing number of young Westerners living in
Kathmandu, and their impact on the cultural life of this city.
For Kathmandu was the 'third eye' of Asia, and the eye that gets
in when reality gets out. It had a special place and played a
special role in Asia. In fact, he had written an article on young
Western visitors for the leading intellectual monthly magazine <i>The
Rising Nepal</i> and wanted me to look over the manuscript. It
was entitled 'Kathmandu: A Coincidence'. Would I like to hear
bits of it ? Sure, I said He began to read: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>'It happened only the other day by what is called in
    northeastern India a Samyoga, fair coincidence. At a public
    place in Kathmandu, two elderly gentlemen debated, and I
    overheard them in spite of myself. They were discussing
    whether the large group of young unkempt visitors from the
    West now in Kathmandu had any principles guiding their visit
    to the East. The gentleman whose tone of voice caught my
    attention first was saying &quot;Iniharuko kehi pani
    siddhanta chhai na&quot;, meaning &quot;These people have no
    principles at all, you know''. He seemed to be informing his
    friend, who, however, paid little attention to his
    companion's tone and presented his view of a whole ideology
    motivating and guiding these young people and their venture
    abroad. They were, he said, on a very important mission
    indeed. Life in the West had lost its meaning for them and
    they had come out here to seek and find new meanings, fresh
    perspectives, among the cultures of the East in art,
    religion, philosophy, in traditional, time-honoured ways of
    living, in forms of life and manner still untouched by the
    sick hurry and commercialism of modern Western civilisation:
    indeed, they were true seekers. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 'A cross-section of the people under discussion
    sat close by, blissfully unconscious of the conversation that
    went on around them. I sat between them and wondered. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 'In fact, I continue to wonder. Personally, my
    time in the West, my memories of looks and words after every
    talk I gave on religious texts, philosophical questions and
    so forth, convince me that the Western youth today is truly
    seeking. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 'The scene in Kathmandu, despite our cynical
    gentlemen, remains positive and exciting. Potentially, here
    is a situation which is a counterpart of a movement to
    preserve and promote our ancient heritage such as the ideal
    of a new Sanskrit University. The readiness with which
    Western youth is willing to accept and undergo, even though
    temporarily, extreme physical hardship is simply amazing if
    one considers the conditions in which they have grown up.
    Living in a world without plumbing and central heating can
    indeed be for the group under discussion a &quot;spiritual
    experience&quot; in itself. It is hard to believe that the
    sacrifice this entails could be motivated simply by the
    desire for cheap travel around the world. The passionate
    interest in religious cultures not their own is a fact about
    young people today which should be given immediate
    recognition. A new faith is arising and demands, even in its
    present rudimentary forms, that we try and understand
    ourselves in terms of the traditions in which others have
    been nourished. The prejudices aroused by the long hair and
    beards notwithstanding, it is evident to those who look and
    listen that there are a certain number of genuine Sadhakas,
    seekers, among these people. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 'Even if life in the West has not lost its
    point for some, one can see and feel what some of the major
    political events of the past few years must have done to the
    more sensitive and intelligent youth of the countries
    involved and responsible for these events. No one who has
    observed for himself the mass madness let loose by alcoholism
    and sexual licence in Western cities, all part of the vast
    and complex money game, can help looking at the psychedelic
    movement in a new light. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 'I have no wish to saddle our friends with a
    &quot;philosophy&quot; not because I think there is no
    philosophy motivating them, but because the quest is still
    very much on. The gains of the last few years are still in
    the process of being recorded, the story is yet to be told.
    We might indeed be living right in &quot;the middle of
    things&quot;, to use a Jamesian image, since Kathmandu
    promises to become, for some of the characters in the play,
    the capital of the new world.' </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I was very impressed, and said so. I told Madhu
that I thought we were all on some kind of sort of quest and had
found in Kathmandu the perfect place to start. Kathmandu was a
city of refugees, the new Jerusalem of the <i>Sadhakas,</i> who
had come to savour of the fruits of Paradise. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; We ordered dinner in our room, and were now
perfectly relaxed in each other's company. I liked him. He was
open and honest and a man for whom the invisible world was
obviously visible. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I told him that I was planning to bring out a
poetry magazine, but needed more material, especially modern
Nepalese poetry. I proposed to include material from the West
dealing especially with the nature of the spiritual quest,
including some essays by myself on the phenomenon LSD. I said it
would serve a two-fold purpose. First, it would introduce
Nepalese poetry to Western readers and second, it would enable
Nepalese readers to orient themselves to the psychology and
background of their young visitors. I had a little money, and
since printing was cheap in Kathmandu, I already had enough to
cover costs. Madhu said he'd be very interested indeed to help in
any way, and that he was already working on the English
translations of several poems. And thus began a partnership that
resulted in the publication of <i>Flow One</i> several months
later. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; One thing led to another, and before long we had
also agreed to start a centre for both Western and Eastern
seekers, especially those who wanted to learn Sanskrit. Madhu
emphasised the importance of Sanskrit amongst the intellectual
artistic circles as well as in the higher levels of Government
and at the Palace. Sanskrit played the same role here as Latin
did in the Catholic Church in the Middle Ages, it was a sort of <i>lingua
franca</i> of any philosophical discussions. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He said that Narayan would almost certainly be
interested in hearing about such a project, and maybe could even
get the Crown Prince as its patron. Could we draft an outline
proposal, since he would be seeing Narayan for dinner later that
evening, and would like to have him put it before the Crown
Prince ? The sooner we acted, the sooner the project could get
official sanction. I would also need permission from the Prime
Minister to publish, but he didn't foresee that there would be
any problem. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Madhu went downstairs to make a few telephone
calls, and I cleared the desk and prepared a chillum to
facilitate the creative processes. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; When Madhu returned, he looked very excited. Yes,
Narayan would like to see the proposal this evening. And he had
had some luck. He had called Balakrishna Sama, the Vice-President
of the Royal Nepalese Academy, who wanted us to come over to his
house for afternoon tea and for a chat. Madhu said that
Balakrishna was one of the truly great poets of Nepal, and
certainly of international stature. The problem was that
Balakrishna wrote his poetry in Nepalese or Sanskrit, though of
course his English was perfect. As a result, he was virtually
unknown outside his own country, a situation Madhu planned to
rectify by translating into English all his work written over the
past sixty years. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He brought up a chair to the desk, and we began to
formulate the proposal. Madhu didn't smoke hash himself, but had
no objection if anyone else did. After a couple of chillums and
an hour's discussion, we had agreed upon the main details, and
all that now remained was to write it. We addressed it to His
Royal Highness, The Crown Prince of Nepal. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; When we finished, Madhu suggested that we should go
round to see Balakrishna Sama who lived at the other end of town,
not far from the Chinese Embassy. We took a taxi and within ten
minutes were walking up the drive of his house; with Hindu
statues in the garden and a huge <i>Garuda</i> bird painted on
the door. I was already impressed. The house itself was large,
half-timbered like a medieval manor, two or three storeys high,
and painted white. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A servant let us in and ushered us into one of the
downstairs living rooms. He said his master would join us in a
moment. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The room was like a miniature museum with statues
of stone and bronze of the various Hindu pantheon, paintings and
early Nepalese iconography; books in Nepalese, Sanskrit, English
and French, and, nicely laid out on a silver-topped table, a
Victorian tea-service. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; We had to wait only a minute or two before the poet
entered. He made a short bow and shook hands with us and
apologised for keeping us waiting. His English, like so many of
the cultured Nepalese, was almost entirely without accent, and he
spoke it with feeling, spontaneously, and without affectation. He
was perhaps seventy years of age, delicate and radiant with
health, and had the face of a man who had obviously lived a life
of the mind, very sensitive and aristocratic, as though his inner
and outer worlds matched. He was dressed in shiny blue silk in
the traditional Nepalese dress, and I felt that I was in the
company of an exceptional, rare person, perhaps even a saint but
certainly a wizard of some sort. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He seemed very pleased to see us, especially Madhu,
whom he embraced warmly as he beckoned us to the tea-table. His
servant appeared with a silver tea-pot, and a plate of cakes and
toasted scones. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Madhu then started to talk about the Himal Centre
project, and to read him bits of our afternoon's work.
Balakrishna was most attentive and sympathetic and said that he
would certainly encourage a centre such as we had outlined. The
only problem he thought was the financial one. He made a few
calculations on a sheet of paper and said that for the
scholarships alone we would need $595,000. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Madhu said that although $500,000 might sound a
like a lot of money, in reality it was not too much if one
considered the possibility of help from some of the larger
American Foundations, who were used to giving away much larger
sums for less realistic projects. I remained silent, though I
nodded in agreement with Madhu's analysis. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; We then began to discuss the envisaged poetry
magazine, <i>Flow,</i> which Madhu briefly described. Nepal,
being a country in which poetry was highly esteemed, had a lot to
offer, and it would make sense to make available some of the best
Nepalese poetry in English, as well as make available
contemporary Western poetry to Nepalese poetry lovers.
Balakrishna then turned to me and asked in his quiet, pleasant
way, what the editorial policy might be and whether I thought
Nepalese poetry was sufficiently good to warrant translation into
an international language like English. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I was pretty stoned and my mind was already soaring
into giddy heights of inspiration. <i>'Flow</i> is essentially a
magazine of poetry, art and religion, and we should dedicate it
to the man of tomorrow who has understood the burden of his dim
past, synthesised the heritage of his many cultures, solved the
crises of the present age and lives according to his genius!' <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Balakrishna smiled broadly, and said that Camus,
the French Existentialist, had probably meant something similar
when he had noted somewhere that 'Real generosity towards the
future lies in giving all to the present'. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I then asked the poet whether he would read some of
his poems, but he demurred, saying his English was not really
good enough to express his meaning, though Madhu could read
something if he wished. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Madhu pulled out a fistful of manuscripts from his
briefcase. </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>'I think I'd like to read a verse from your most recent
    poem, which I have just finished translating&#151;<i>To Soma,</i>
    which was, I believe, inspired by the recent Apollo 11 manned
    trip to the moon. But I think I ought to explain for the
    benefit of Michael here, that the word <i>Soma</i> in
    Sanskrit also means &quot;moon&quot; as it is also associated
    with the sacred elixir of the gods of Vedic times. It was the
    fruit from the mystical tree of knowledge which, when taken,
    loosened the &quot;Tongue of the Way&quot; and in this sense
    would correspond to the Greek ambrosia, the elixir of
    immortality from the stream of Castalia under the Temple of
    Diana. ' </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Madhu stood up, bowed graciously to the poet, who
sat silent, his face grave and serious &#133; </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>'Sweetly, O Soma, do I remember you again today, <br>
    Over the last half-century have I been<br>
    Drinking you in, drop by drop, unceasing, ecstatic! <br>
    Once again, O Soma, I grind your vine,<br>
    Grind it with my heart, filter it through my viens, Mingle it
    with my vision and my breath,<br>
    To fill the amphora of my heart to the brim! <br>
    O Soma, soaked am I to the very depths<br>
    In the sweet shower of your beams<br>
    Drawn deeply by your gravity,<br>
    Exhilarated, breathless as I swing <br>
    And go steadily gliding, gliding,<br>
    I too fly upwards with Apollo Eleven! &#133; ' </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It was a long poem followed by a long silence, and
we all looked as if something very special had happened, like the
shock following upon a great discovery. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Impatient or unwilling to remain silent, I finally
broke the spell by saying that it was one of the most incredible
poems that I had ever heard, and that I wanted to put it into the
magazine for the world to read. I also added, by way of a
comment, that I had arrived in Kathmandu on the very same day
that Apollo 11 had blasted off for the moon. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Balakrishna then said, looking at me straight in
the eyes, though centred in the middle of my forehead: 'A most
auspicious omen for you.' </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; It was time to go, and we stood up, bowed and
took our leave. Madhu danced down the driveway, obviously pleased
by our reception. There were no taxis in sight and I told Madhu
that I'd really prefer to walk back to the hotel, which was fine
with him. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The evening breeze made the walk bearable, and I
felt very good indeed. We talked a lot on the way about the
magazine, the shape it should take, who might be able to print it
in English, things like that. But my mind was strangely
elsewhere, as if the experience with Balakrishna Sama had been
more than simply meeting a master poet. I felt very close to the
man in some odd, unaccountable way. Perhaps in him I had at last
found my 'guru'? <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; We soon reached the centre of the city, and taking
Madhu back into my confidence, I asked him whether he could find
me a house to rent, somewhere nice, perhaps on the edge of the
city, and with many rooms. Madhu said he'd look into it
immediately. We said goodbye at Kanti Path, and I cut across the
park in the direction of my hotel. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It was a beautiful evening, cool and pleasant in
the evening light, the mountains still visible as silhouettes in
the far distance. I again experienced that expansion of feeling,
a new mental amplitude, difficult to describe but quite intense.
It was my own self reborn out of the vibrations of this holy
city; it was my own self which warms in the sun, refreshes in the
evening breeze, glows in the stars, and blossoms in the trees....
In the distance I heard the sound of a temple flute and bell and
the song of the cicada as it sung itself &#133; utterly &#133;
a-w-a-y. Why grasp so earnestly after hallucinations and flowers
in the air when it was all here, at one's feet ? For as one's
sense of reality deepends, which it does with age, one's need to
integrate with the world is very great indeed. And I felt that at
least here, in this Paradise city, I should make myself yet one
more dwelling place. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Back in my hotel room, after a light dinner of rice
and vegetables, contentedly I prepared a chillum, and poured out
some fruit wine. How otherwise shall we take our pleasure here
&#133; and if ever I am asked again 'What for the future?' it
will be with a finger pointed to the moon that I shall reply.</p>

<p>&nbsp; </p>

<h4>Three months later &#133;</h4>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The monsoon was over. The air was as clear and
fresh as Vichy water. I had rented the lower two floors of a
large house called 'Shangri-La' in Bijuswari, a secluded suburb
of Kathmandu close to Swayambhu. The house belonged to the
Nepalese Director of Tourism, Tirtha Raj Tuladhar, a Buddhist and
a man of great personal charm and sensitivity, who had translated
many of King Mahendra's poems into English. And from my window I
had a clear view across the valley to the distant snow-capped
peaks of the high Himalayan range. The house stood by itself in a
narrow lane which was really a cul-de-sac and was thus unvisited
by motorised transport, except once in the morning and once in
the evening when a chauffeur-driven car came to pick up and
deliver the Tourist Director. It was a haven of stillness, and
the only sounds you heard were natural ones&#151;of birds, or
animals or passing people. There was a large meadow extending
across the lane; and a large well-kept garden immediately in
front of the house, which seemed forever ablaze with flowers,
especially roses, which the tourist director would tend for hours
at a time, removing by hand, bugs from the petals and leaves, one
at a time, never killing them, but putting them on a sheet of
paper and every now and then blowing them off into the winds of
fate or fortune. A typically Buddhist gesture. An orchard of pear
and apple trees flanked either side of the house and at the very
rear, beyond the back garden was a small <i>stupa</i> of
exquisite design. It was an ideal place to be. This was my
landscape, the one that absorbed me, with joy, into the hot blood
of myths and gods, back into the roots of total being in which,
at times I could truly believe that there was no longer any 'I'
or 'me' but that I was somehow the All. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And in the mornings, with my rooms filled with
bright sunlight and the sound of temple bells opening the well of
my ears, I could feel that inexpressible peace &#133; as: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Unseen today<br>
    In brightest sunlight, and yet<br>
    Today how beautiful, Mother Nepal. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I was learning that man is born in ignorance of his
element, and must somehow find it, like the cygnet finds the
water. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; My mornings would usually start early, shortly
after daybreak. I had a small paraffin burner on which I would
make my breakfast, usually a plate of porridge made from
water-buffalo milk, and several cups of tea, followed by a
chillum. I usually took this in the garden. I'd then try to work
a little on the magazine manuscripts before Madhu would arrive,
usually at about ten o'clock. It was an idyllic existence. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Kris, the poet, would usually join us for lunch,
and after lunch we would be joined by five or six other
Westerners for some Sanskrit lessons, which Kris had arranged. He
had a degree in Sanskrit from Oxford, and was a very patient,
clever teacher, who used his skill to get us to learn this
amazing language. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But mostly my time was taken up with the manifold
problems of getting the magazine together. We had found three
printers and had decided to parcel the material out as three
separate sections, which we would then assemble into the final
magazine. Already the shape of the magazine was discernible, if
in silhouette only, but the energy was there&#151;my slight
paranoia was that with the unlimited amount of hashish and LSD we
had, all this energy would dissipate before completion, for with
psychedelics the impetus to 'attend to business' is not always
present! So it was something of an effort of will, for I was
determined to get the damn thing published, even if it killed me,
which, as it turned out, it very nearly did through what you
would call over-indulgence in drugs (though other matters played
their part, like rising costs and two of the printers refusing to
print or return the manuscripts entrusted to them). <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The least of my difficulties, surprisingly enough,
was obtaining official permission from the Prime Minister to
publish the magazine. I had been told by various people,
including the French Ambassador, that no foreigner had ever
received such permission, 'not even the Americans'. And the
British Embassy was equally sure that I would be refused, though
in every other way they were most encouraging. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I needed, of course, someone who had access to the
Prime Minister and who was also a poet. And I found my man in the
person of Soorya Bahadur Singh. He was an extraordinary gentleman
in his late thirties, who worked in the Singha Durba, the
parliament building, and who wrote poetry in English. He came
round to see me one day with a pile of poems about one foot deep,
which he wanted me to publish. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Mr. Singh had connections inside the
Parliament&#151;his brother was private secretary to the King. So
I asked him to arrange for me to see the Prime Minister. This he
arranged in a matter of a few hours for the following day, which
didn't leave me much time to find something suitable to wear. My
normal dress was a Tibetan shirt and dhoti, a piece of coloured
Indian cloth wrapped around my waist, and my shoes had long since
been given away to a Tibetan Buddhist priest, who had wanted them
for his Rimpoche (a High Lama) as a gift. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Accordingly, as soon as Singh told me that I had to
be at the Singha Durba at eleven o'clock the next morning, I went
into town to buy an outfit. I settled for what I was told was a
traditional Nepalese costume for formal occasions. It was made of
silver cloth and the trousers were right up to the knees and
opened up at the top like jodhpurs, together with a long jacket
nearly down to the middle of the thigh. The collar was tied by
means of ribbons. I also got a pair of cheap Indian sandals. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I spent most of the night preparing my brief, and
felt able to answer any questions the Prime Minister might put to
me. Mr. Singh came with a taxi at 10.30 to take me to the Singha
Durba. He seemed to be almost as nervous as I was. I had
difficulty getting dressed in my new Nepalese clothes&#151;the
legs were too tight, but I finally managed to get into them, and
off we set. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The Singha Durba was an impressive building, huge
and in the style of architecture of the British Raj. The taxi
dropped us off at the main entrance. The entire building seemed
to be a labyrinth of corridors, and we walked rapidly, moving
through this maze, up stairways, down small corridors, along long
ones until we stopped before two huge polished mahogany doors
with a sparkling brass curved doorknob. Mr. Singh knocked, and we
entered. This was the Secretary's office. The secretary was a
pleasant young man, who smiled broadly when he saw me, and said
that the Prime Minister was expecting us. He disappeared for a
moment through another set of huge doors, and then came out and
indicated that we were to enter. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The Prime Minister sat at a desk at the far end of
a palatial room. He was wearing a white open-necked shirt with
the sleeves rolled up. When he stood up to greet us, I noticed
that he was wearing ordinary Western-style navy blue trousers and
a belt. It was quite a distance from the door to his desk, but
already I sensed a <i>faux pas</i> on my part. The Prime Minister
began to smile as we approached and the smile gradually broadened
into a grin. By the time we reached his desk he was almost
uncontrollably shaking with suppressed laughter. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of course I didn't know it then, but the costume I
had bought ready-made from one of the tourist shops was from a
period around about 1890&#151;as though in the West I had gone to
meet an official dressed up in a Dickensian outfit. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But the broad grin was infectious, and I, too, was
laughing when we shook hands. Tears streamed down the Prime
Minister's face as he took the form that Singh handed him and
which he had to sign before we could officially go ahead with the
publication of Flow. He hardly glanced at it, and signing it with
a flourish, managed to say between giggles, 'I hope you don't
write anything bad about Nepal.' <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Mr. Singh then bowed and said that was all and that
we now had permission to print. I said I thought the Prime
Minister was an exceptionally jolly fellow. And Singh merely
nodded. He then asked me whether I'd like a tour of the building,
to which I readily assented. We must have walked three or four
miles through the endless lengths of corridors, and somehow ended
up walking along a subterranean corridor, lit by light coming
through tiny iron-barred windows. Singh said he had to see
someone for a moment, and we went into an incredibly small room
that seemed to be littered everywhere&#151;on the shelves, on the
floor, on the desks, with bundles of envelopes. There was a very
old man sitting at one of the desks, who barely glanced up as we
entered. 'This is the censor's office and this is the chief
censor. I think I will show him the Prime Minister's signature on
our document, just in case.' Singh said something to the Censor
and gave him the signed piece of paper. The Censor removed the
thin wire spectacles which he had been using to read the letters,
and produced a magnifying glass, and read the paper Singh had
handed him. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He nodded, dug out a stamp from a drawer, and after
putting some ink on to the pad, stamped the document. 'Now it's
completely official. We can publish anything we want.' <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I was glad to get out of the building with its
associations of prison and other large institutions, and I
welcomed Singh's suggestion that we should go somewhere and
celebrate, which for Singh meant getting very drunk. I called an
American teacher friend and asked him if he could let me have a
bottle of whisky, explaining the purpose, for it was still not
yet noon. No problem. And by mid-afternoon we were both reeling
about the centre of Kathmandu singing songs and reciting poetry.
Finally we got to Rana's teashop, and stumbled in. All the heads
turned as we noisily entered. And on many of the bearded faces
was a look of disapproval. Rana's was a place for chillums and
pop music, not a bar. Singh insisted on having the music turned
off, then climbed on to the top of a table and, with tears
streaming down his face, said that never in his entire life had
he met such a great poet as Michael Hollingshead, and that it was
his wish that everyone in the teashop should stand up and sing
'God Save the Queen'. A few heads split immediately, sensing a
scene. And Rana just stood there watching, not knowing quite what
to do. Finally, I managed to pull Singh off the table and out
from the teashop into the yard. I then carried him to a taxi and
paid the driver to take him back to the Singha Durba to sleep it
off. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; And thus the days passed into weeks and then
into months. By now we had a lot of material ready for the
printers. I had also got a translation of one of the King's
poems, which I decided to print in red. It was called <i>A
Self-Portrait</i> &#133; </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>'Like the dark night I am <br>
    Whose moon has strayed away; <br>
    Like the wild withered tree <br>
    That all its leaves has lost. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>With rotten, hollowed roots, <br>
    Ready I am to fall; <br>
    A faded flower I <br>
    With none to care for me. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>A blind man I who gropes <br>
    Fumbling the stark mid-path; <br>
    And such a burning fire<br>
    That has no warmth to give. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Ever am I in the mid-stream <br>
    About to sink beneath the waves; <br>
    I am a drowned soul, <br>
    Whose shore lies far away.' </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It was a very fine poem, and modest, considering
that King Mahendra was the supreme ruler of Nepal, and also
recognised as an incarnation of the Hindu God Vishnu. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I had also had quite a few acid sessions during the
time I had been there was a constant stream of visitors coming to
'Shangri-la' to score some 'sunshine'. There was quite a bit of
acid in the city, mostly brought in by Californians or some of
the bigger dealers, who would exchange acid for hashish. I
believe LSD was known by the few Nepalese who used it as 'Western
hash'. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It was traditional to take LSD at full moon, and
people would congregate at the <i>Bakery Ashram,</i> and drop it
in the late evening so that they could listen to music during the
night, followed by a climb up to the Buddhist temples to join the
monks for early morning service. It was very rare that anyone
ever freaked out' or went berserk, though it could happen. I
remember a young Dutch boy who, when he got to the temple, took
off all his clothes and began running amok, knocking over prayer
bowls and trying to climb up on to the head of a huge bronze
Buddha. There was nothing we could do to quieten him down, and we
felt it had all gone a little too far. The monks, who had been
chanting during all of this had seemingly not paid any attention,
that is until the statue began to sway and it looked as if it
would come crashing down. About six monks suddenly moved across
to grab him, and gently they carried him back to the circle of
other monks. They then tied him up and gagged him and placed him
in the centre, and continued their <i>mantras</i> as if nothing
had happened. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But perhaps the thing that disturbed local people
the most was that, on average, one girl a month would flip out on
acid and insist on walking through the centre of the city
completely naked. I think the Nepalese were terribly shocked by
this, for often the girl would be extremely beautiful. I think
the syndrome, as far as one can say anything about human
behaviour, is connected with the notion of total freedom, the
freedom to walk naked being merely a manifestation of this wish.
Throwing off your clothes is an act of liberation. Or so someone
once told the young Californian girl whom I saw briefly just
before she was put on the plane to India, having been found by a
policeman wandering naked through the main street. I think there
was also a great fear on the part of the authorities that one day
King Mahendra might see such a spectacle, and that would create a
major incident, for the king had a habit of cruising the streets
at odd hours behind the wheel of his Ferrari. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In fact, although I was not held directly
responsible in the case of the American girl, it had not escaped
the notice of the authorities that I was somehow involved with
the LSD-cult, as they called it. At first it had seemed innocent
enough, merely another religious group, who used something
similar if not identical to hashish, which had a place in certain
forms of Eastern worship. But this thing about girls taking off
their clothes every now and then had them worried. Consequently,
I was approached by one of the editors of the English language
daily, <i>The Rising Nepal,</i> who asked whether I would write
an article for the paper about what young Westerners were doing
in Kathmandu. 'It would help relations with the public very much
indeed; yes, really, very, very much. Thank you.' <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I did so, and called the article 'The Divine
Mutants' which was sufficiently obscure I thought, with still a
slight religious or spiritual bias. </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>'THE DIVINE MUTANTS </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>'The term, &quot;hippy&quot;, if a recent journalist can
    be believed was invented by the media so that ordinary people
    would have something to pray for salvation from. If so, and
    if the phenomenon &quot;hippy&quot; is the unholy invention
    if sub-editors and people with mass circulation magazines to
    sell, we ought to be able to look at the matter more
    objectively and see what myths and legends have sprung up
    around this strange creature. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 'One thing is certain, however, there is an
    increasing acceleration of young people &quot;dropping
    out&quot; of our Western sort of society, who prefer to
    &quot;stand on their own two feet&quot; rather than have
    their lives directed from without, by the system
    (economic-political-social). This group, variously estimated
    (<i>Time</i> magazine) to be between seven and ten million
    under the age of twenty-six, has claimed new areas for its
    own. It has developed a new life-style or an existential mode
    of being which, if still lacking proper articulation, seems
    nonetheless to be an attraction for some of the most gifted
    and sensitive minds of our modern generation; there is
    something vital and energetic and intelligent about what
    these young people are doing. In the words of their
    &quot;High Priest'', Timothy Leary, who also coined their
    slogan <i>Turn On</i> (to your own nervous system) <i>Tune in</i>
    (to the energy within your own mind) <i>Drop out</i> (of the
    socioeconomic system): &quot;The generation born after 1945
    is perhaps the wisest and holiest generation that the human
    race has ever seen &#133; and, by God, instead of lamenting
    derogating, and imprisoning them, we should support them, all
    turn on with them.&quot; <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 'Yet for those so identified by Leary, the
    &quot;dropping out&quot; foreshadows social developments
    which are bound to take place in Western society as a whole,
    for as automation increases and when only a small percentage
    of the people will do most of the work, leisure will be the
    problem or, rather, too much leisure, for the old ethic of
    work and salvation cannot survive in a society where perhaps
    only five per cent of the top executive and administration do
    all of the work- indeed, within the foreseeable future, <i>the
    big reward in life will be to be allowed to work.</i> <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 'Meanwhile, we are living in a strange
    confusing period of transition from one life-style to another
    quite different one. From the philosopher's point of view, I
    think, we are seeing a change in the nature of Western man
    due to a shift of emphasis away from a theological revelation
    to an ontologist mysticism, that is, authority of a Divine
    Person to the more individually &quot;free&quot; belief in
    absolute Nature. In either approach to God, we are reminded
    that we are summoned to a deeper spiritual awareness, far
    beyond the level of subject-object. One of the attractions of
    Central Asia for some of the young seekers is that the
    religions here see man's unity with God in an ontological and
    natural principle in which all beings are metaphysically <i>one.</i>
    Here there is unity in Absolute Being <i>(Atman)</i> or in
    the Void <i>(Sunyata).</i> <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 'It is one way that still remains for Western
    man to save himself from becoming Reality's dupe, that is,
    the slave of some external control (which we see as an
    inevitable result of television, which keeps millions of
    minds literally imprisoned by invisible lines of pull and
    force, and soon there will be more sophisticated hardware,
    such as 3-D holography, where images will literally appear to
    be actually <i>present within you inside your living-room.</i>
    If you want to see an elephant, plug in the tape marked
    &quot;elephant&quot;and one will appear, hovering in your
    drawing-room and safe too. And it won't leave any mess to
    have to clear up afterwards. For such people, the cinematic
    world of labour-saving devices and the good health that goes
    with it is probably the best place to be.) &quot;A lifetime
    of freedom! Why, no man alive could stand it; it would turn
    his life on earth into a complete hell&quot;, says Bernard
    Shaw. And for the older, conservative members of society this
    is a fair observation. Freedom is too difficult for most
    people to bear, and for those who have lived a lifetime of
    conformity and spiritual neglect, freedom is impossible, that
    is, short of mystical revelation. The young man or woman is
    aware that as the political inhumanity of this century
    increases (with a corresponding erosion of certain liberal
    and humanist values) so too will the illegality of our
    various legal actions that seek to keep bodies of men
    pressing down on other bodies of men, and all for so little
    reason. Society, to such a young educated thinking person
    seems to be growing infertile, devoid of a living culture, no
    longer productive of any personal form, abstract, lifeless in
    the face of machine-made interpretations about the self, the
    world, and the other people in it. No wonder, then, if modern
    man sees himself as nothing but a cipher on the face of a
    moral and spiritual void. And as the knowledge of his own
    disorientation cannot be handled quantitatively, he turns
    more and more to his brave world of machines. And through the
    power of his machines he acts out the uncomprehended tragedy
    of his inner disruption. He is therefore cut off from any
    reality except that of his own processes, which he cannot
    understand, and his machines, which he can understand, but
    which cannot provide answers or even directions which would
    enable him to regain the former lost paradise of close
    contact with nature and the world of living things, including
    himself. As the Ancient Chinese sage, Shuang Tzu, discovered
    some 2500 years ago, dependence even on a simple kind of
    machine causes man to become uncertain of his own inner
    impulses, and he may even forget how to master his own world.
    Naturally, the advance of science and technology during the
    past 150 years is irreversible, and modern man now has come
    to terms with himself in his new situation. Yet he cannot do
    so, it seems to many modern thinkers, if he builds an
    irrational and unscientific faith on the absolute and final
    objectivity of a <i>scientific</i> knowledge of nature. For
    the study of man is also concerned with the core of the
    unknowable at the heart of man which cannot by its nature
    become the subject of finite analysis like a plant or animal
    species but is an area of human experience accessible through
    the intervention of a sacrament, which is whatever it is that
    helps make God present in man. (A sacrament is something that
    engenders in those who use it certain spiritual resonances
    which defy exact analysis and cannot be accurately described
    to one who does not experience authentically in himself.) <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 'And perhaps the start of any process of the
    personality towards independence, self-direction, and control
    must start with question and the search for an answer; with
    the question which again and again implies a calling in
    question the destruction of accepted ideas and stereotyped
    world-pictures and rote-learning and imprints&#151;in a word,
    revolution; the question that both cost Socrates his life and
    made it of such value. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 'So perhaps we ought to look more kindly on the
    youthful pioneers who see our future world as one in which
    there is none but one, and each person owns nothing but the
    whole. And the phenomenon of so many young people who think
    this way is all the more significant if you take Kathmandu as
    an allegory of the possibility of conformity, not merely of
    one young growing person to one particular communal place or
    social development, but of a whole generation to a complete,
    if at times imperfect, greater society.' </p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; The editor seemed very pleased with the article and
asked whether I'd like to write more for them. I then wrote a
series on Tantra called 'Old Art in the Hands of New Artists
(Notes on the relevance of Tantra to Modern Western Art
Movement)' which they wanted to serialise over twelve issues. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Tantra, in fact, had interested me a lot during my
stay in the East, and I had consulted both Lhasa-trained Buddhist
<i>tantrikas</i> as well as Hindu masters. There was also a
Western Hindu monk called Bhagawan Dass, from California, who
practised Tibetan Tantra vitally and who had a lot to tell me
about its left-handed aspect. It was also Bhagawan Dass who first
took Richard Alpert to his guru in India, Neem Karolli Baba.
Richard was converted into orthodox Hinduism and given the name <i>Baba
Ram Dass,</i> or 'servant of God'. He claims to be able to
maintain a 'forty per cent hashish high' <i>without</i> the use
of drugs or sex, which is admirable. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; My talks with both Bhagawan Dass and Baba Ram Das
confirmed that their guru had used LSD: in fact, the first time
he did so was when Bhagawan introduced him to Ram Dass. The story
of what happened is now part of LSD lore, but is worth repeating,
even so. The guru asked about LSD, and Ram Dass said that it did
something equivalent to what he had read about in the writings of
the mystics, both Eastern and Western. The guru asked Richard, as
he then was, if he had any. Richard said he had six
'whitelightning' pills left, and that they were very powerful
indeed. The guru asked Richard to give them to him. And promptly
swallowed them. Richard sat silent watching for any sign. An hour
passed. Finally, Richard asked the Baba what effects he was
experiencing. 'None', exclaimed the guru. And Richard was
immediately impressed and declared his allegiance to the guru,
and gave him his Land Rover. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There was very little interest in LSD amongst the
Nepalese, however, with one notable exception, Rama Prasad
Manandhar, who had been the Nepalese Ambassador in London for
seven years (he had once entertained Queen Elizabeth to dinner at
his London Embassy). Rama Prasad was a tantrika, a poet, and a
philosopher, a man of wide learning and culture, who lived in one
of the oldest and most beautiful houses in the city. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He came round to visit me one day, and a friendship
sprang up. One thing led to another and finally he asked me one
day whether he could try some LSD. We arranged a session at
'Shangri-la', and I told him the strength or dosage, and he
selected a dose of about 300 gamma, which was quite a lot for a
first trip. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The session was very quiet, meditative, and
serious. Rama Prasad did not talk very much. I remained totally
silent. About midway through the session, Rama Prasad complained
about being indoors, and said that he would like to go into the
garden. We walked into the garden together. It was a beautiful
afternoon of bright sunlight, and everything looked absolutely
radiant and perfect. Rama walked over to one of the roses upon
which a gorgeous butterfly had just alighted. And exclaimed: 'We
must try to expand the &quot;moment&quot; into infinite
duration!' He asked for a pen and paper and then wrote a poem,
which I reproduce exactly as he wrote it and as I published it
later in <i>Flow One.</i> It is called <i>The Moment</i> and <i>The
One-Ment.</i> </p>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It was shortly after the Ambassador's session that
Rama Prasad came round to see me about arranging a meeting with
the celebrated Buddhist monk and saint, His Holiness&#151;Gyalwa
Karmapa, who was visiting Kathmandu and staying with the monks at
SwayambhNath. Rama knew Karmapa quite well, and had even
entertained him once at a reception in his town house. I was
naturally very interested in having an audience with Karmapa, for
I had heard and read much about him. He was the head of the
Kagyudpa Order of Tibetan Mahayana Buddhism, and recognised as
the sixteenth Karmapa incarnation. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The audience was arranged for dawn on the following
morning, and Rama Prasad said he'd pick me up at my house in his
car. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I stayed up all that night, preparing myself for
the temple meeting, and performing chillum and acid Sadhana. When
Rama Prasad collected me, I was very stoned indeed, and could
hardly find my way out of the garden into the Mercedes. Then we
sped off into the blackness and reached the top of Swayambhu just
as the first light of dawn appeared through the gaps between the
surrounding mountains. It was a glorious sight. And I felt a very
special sense of reverence; there was a holiness about the place,
more intense than I had ever experienced there before; my head
and heart were open to anything. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; We were taken up some stairs to the top floor and
shown into an antechamber where a monk tied a piece of orange
cloth around my neck. He then indicated that I should follow him,
and he led me from the chamber into a huge <i>sal</i> brilliant
with <i>tankas,</i> and murals, and statues. At the far end,
seated on a throne, sat Karmapa; and next to him, seated on a
cushion in the full lotus position, was Rama Prasad. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I approached Karmapa slowly, my eyes to the floor,
with short bows every few steps. When I reached the throne, I
looked up and saw a beam of bright light issuing from the centre
of his silver crown or it may have been a beam of sunlight
catching a reflection through the lattice-work windows. But the
effect was quite startling. It really could seem that he was
emitting light from his 'third eye' in the centre of his
forehead. I recovered from this startling hallucination,
sufficiently anyhow to hand him the white silk scarf I had
brought as a present. Karmapa then spoke to me through an
interpreter: 'According to the tradition since the Buddha, it has
been customary to preserve the record of gifts, as a token of
one's inner sense of benevolence. This is so that it may serve as
a historical record of the <i>Dharma</i> too. Your name will
therefore be added to the names of people contributing to this
tradition.' <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I was then asked to say anything I wished to
Karmapa. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; What I wished to say was for the future: to see
many of the Lamas and families of the esoteric <i>Dharma</i> move
to the West. And, how this work could be furthered by the lamas
opening a dialogue with the Chiefs and Elders of the North
American Indian Tribe called the <i>Hopi</i> whose villages I had
once visited in Arizona. The lands of the North American Indians
stretch from parts of Canada down to the Mexican border and
comprise some of the most beautiful countryside in the world,
parts of which are remarkably similar to Tibet, particularly in
Colorado and New Mexico. But these lands are now under siege
again, for, as the indigenous Indian population is encouraged to
leave the reservations and accept an alien white
culture&#151;which is happening in the case of the young Indians
at a truly frightening rate&#151;these holy lands will be taken
over in a few years by the U.S. Government, and then by the
builders. Yet potentially they could provide a sort of 'spiritual
backbone' for a future, more spiritualized America. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Karmapa remained silent throughout all this. When I
had finished, he beckoned me closer and, as I bent my head, his
hands touched the centre of my head, and suddenly, unaccountably,
like a bolt, I experienced <i>Samadhi</i> one of the most
extraordinary moments of consciousness of which man is capable.
And I felt utterly and completely cleansed, as though the divine
thunderbolt had gone through me like a million volt charge. It
was a feeling that was to remain with me for quite some days. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The memory of this great Initiation persists. I
believe that on that special morning when I met Karmapa my life
was changed and in ways that I am only now beginning to
understand, which I have yet to assimilate, and, in time, express
outwardly and through my being. For if ever there were a living
god, Karmapa is it: of this I am utterly convinced. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Ninety-five per cent of all Buddhists, from Ladakh
to NEFA (North Assam) belong to the <i>Kargyudpa</i> esoteric
sect, of which Karmapa is the spiritual leader. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Like all the other Karmapa incarnations, His
Holiness is famous for his erudite scholarship, integrity of
character, and excellence in yogic practices. The embodiment of
compassion, in human form, Karmapa cares for and loves all human
beings, and takes pains for their spiritual salvation. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He is equally well-honoured and followed by Kings,
Lamas and laymen, in Tibet, China, Mongolia, India, Nepal,
Sikkim, Bhutan, as also throughout south-east Asia, Japan,
Ceylon, Burma, Thailand, Canada, Great Britain, U.S.A., Sweden,
Denmark, Spain, etc., etc. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And daily now Karmapa prays for the world &#133;
'May all spiritual leaders enjoy long lives and prosperity. May
the <i>Singha</i> multiply and fulfill their duties. May the
blessings of the <i>Dharma</i> liberate all departed souls. In
the world may sickness, poverty, wars and all evil influences be
cut at the root and destroyed. May all things of the <i>Kali Yuga</i>
(Black Age) be dispersed.' </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Finally, of course, the first number of <i>Flow</i>
appeared, minus about half the material, which two of the
printers had kept after I refused to pay increased printing
costs, which I considered to be very unfair. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And the dedication read:</p>

<p> <center> TO HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS<br>
THE CROWN PRINCE OF NEPAL<br>
AND HER ROYAL HIGHNESS<br>
ON THE OCCASION OF THEIR MARRIAGE<br>
KATHMANDU &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
FEBRUARY 27, 1970 </center> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The days drifted lazily. I had made a number of
friends in Kathmandu, both Nepali and Western, and would often
spend pleasant afternoons walking around the city, occasionally
venturing forth to BoudhiNath, a small Tibetan settlement just
outside Kathmandu, with a characteristic huge <i>stupa</i> or
temple in the centre of the village, with three large eyes
painted on the top, which were visible from afar&#151;one of the
silent sentinels of Kathmandu Valley. It was a colourful
place&#151;the old Tibetan women slowly circumnavigating the
temple, spinning the eternal prayer-wheels, the men hanging
around in change shops, a few Easterners buying Tibetan ornaments
and clothes in the inevitable string of tourist shops. One of the
large houses around the <i>stupa</i> belonged to the Chini Lama,
and, having heard that the stupa had been recently struck by
lightning, I decided to pay him a visit one afternoon, for the
Chini Lama was like the unofficial mayor of BoudhiNath and the
guardian of the <i>stupa,</i> which he generously endowed. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; According to local gossip the Chini Lama had been
doing a good trade moving <i>tankas,</i> Tibetan rugs, and
hashish and the lightning thunderbolt had struck the <i>stupa</i>
as art obvious warning from above. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The Lama received me hospitably with the
traditional salt-and-butter tea, brought in by a lovely girl. As
we sat and talked, I was impressed by his incredible outfit,
which included orange-red robes in various silks, a fur hat, from
underneath which his smiling eyes looked at me with a penetrating
curiosity. I finally asked him about the lightning matter,
whereupon he told me that it was indeed an auspicious omen as he
had found a <i>Garuda</i> egg embedded in the <i>stupa</i> just
afterwards. I beheld in my stoned mind's eye a vision of a
mythical bird, for the <i>Garuda</i> is a familiar creature to
the readers of Hindu mythology, not unlike the phoenix in
appearance, whose wings are made of gold studded with diamonds;
so I suggested that I could arrange for an incubator to be sent
out to the <i>stupa,</i> if there were any real possibility of
hatching such an unusual bird as the <i>Garuda.</i> The Chini
Lama looked at me wistfully for what seemed like a long time and
finally said: 'I am afraid it is too late. I have already sold
the egg to a Hong Kong businessman. The shell is famed throughout
China as a great aphrodisiac. ' <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; We parted on the best of terms and he suggested
that I visit the monastery of Ogmin Chang Chub Choling,
established by a former Miami beauty Queen, Princess Zinaide de
Rachevski, who had been ordained into the Tantric Buddhist Order
by His Holiness, the Dalai Lama, who had also shaved off her head
of hair; and it was rumoured she was the first incarnation of
Madame Blavatski&#133; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It was a two-mile walk from the village, and I made
the ascent of the hill with some difficulty; the path was fairly
steep and narrow and I had to avoid occasional flocks of
descending goats and the occasional water-buffalo led by tiny
Nepalese children. The hill levelled out and soon I was inside
the gates of the monastery. The Abbess was sitting on the lawn in
a circle of beautiful girls with the occasional male <i>sadhu</i>
seated quietly within their midst. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I sat down next to Zina, as she liked to be known
by old friends (we had known each other briefly in New York, in
the mid-sixties, during her time there as a stunning East Side
socialite), and she told me many interesting things about the
training people received at the monastery, the essence of
transmission being telepathy or more exactly <i>darshan</i>&#151;a
kind of 'flash' or vibration that is transmitted in the <i>guru-gela</i>
relationship. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; One of the resident Lamas, who had received his
training in Lhasa, now spoke a little English, and during the
course of the conversation I asked him about the Chinese invasion
into Tibet. The Lama gave me a curious answer: From one point of
view the invasion had been an historical tragedy, certainly for
the Tibetan people who were now scattered as refugees throughout
the Indian continent. Yet from another vantage point, the
'cosmic' one, this was all somehow necessary in order to spread
the <i>dharma</i> and make of this planet earth a Heaven for all
living creatures. 'The seven seals of silence were broken and a
new epoch would come.' <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Now my time in this tiny Himalayan Kingdom had come
to an end. I had lived in Kathmandu for one year and had seen and
experienced many new things, and much had been given, more,
indeed, than I could ever hope to repay. But some inner
restlessness was calling me back to the West, and I decided to
follow its prompting. Thus it was on one sun-drenched morning in
August that I boarded the tiny DC-9 to Calcutta and thence by
connecting jet to London, arriving back in the metropolis the
next day as though in a foreign city, lost, and not a little sad
for what I saw&#133; . What had I really learned in my decade of
bizarre psychedelic trips? That it takes a great deal of acid to
produce even a little elevation of consciousness? That there are
times we can know more than we can tell? That reality must still
count for something? That it is impossible to become what one is
never not? That the future lies in a Tantric vision of cosmic
sexuality combined with a cult of ecstasy? That we can make of
the planet earth a Holy Land yet? Or is it with a finger pointed
to the moon that I should reply? But one thing is certain: that
there is no need to mean by a 'culture of humanity' anything more
than the liberation of the higher faculties. Whoever has any
experience in this matter will know how right Cato was when he
said: &#133; 'Never is he more active than when he does nothing,
never is he less alone than when he is by himself.' <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; What at last is left for the psychedelic theorist ?
Must he honour the extreme doctrine of individualism and concede
that, after the elimination of radical evil and the provision of
material abundance, people must be left alone, simply to be and
do what they want ? <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Our mind craves dreams, those magical realms, for
ever present between somewhere and nowhere, which beguile us with
a thraldom all their own and help keep our sense of wonder alive.
And if the new 'matter-of-factness' encroaches on our brain to no
other end than to make of our life a thing and not, as it longs
to be, an instrument of self-transcendence, we feel distressed by
our inability to dream as once we did; and all delight is gone,
our life somehow diminished, which is the cause of most of the <i>angst</i>
in the self- the knowledge that what is most human in our life is
being determined not by our 'true' needs, which are divined from
the centre of our being, opening like the petals of the lotus and
are beyond thought, beyond intellect, 'beyond striving', but are
on the contrary, determined entirely by external forces, through
no choice of ours. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; We are at once the victims and the beneficiaries of
modern technological advances. Reality is now the new myth-making
substance. We are manipulated by man-made dreams which develop
artificial wants: frozen and tasteless foods, bland, homogenised
lives; clich-ridden beliefs and standardised rituals;
conspicuous consumption; the 'pooled self-esteem' our Western
forms of nationalism make possible; mechanical gadgets; devotion
to science and the 'preality-principle'; and the abandonment of
any religious revelation, so that even our religious leaders and
intellectuals do not use words like 'spiritual' and 'idealistic'
at all freely, for they are themselves quite happy with their
material comforts and the labour-saving world of gadgets and good
health that goes with them, and would consider those who preached
that the happiness people want should be sought for in any kind
of <i>nirvana, mystic ecstasy, theoria, transcendence,</i> as
certainly other-worldly. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; What the spread of technological culture has done
is to push the boundaries of the literal miracle, the
'other-world', the magical far outside the range of ordinary
everyday human happiness. Miracles, our politicians tell us, do
not originate in some supernatural religious state but must be
realised in this world and have their basis in the familiar facts
of technological progress, in communication, education,
transportation, public health, etc., etc. But those who have
found a source of happiness in a life of the spirit are of the
opinion that there has been a retrogression in our aim for a true
culture of humanity. While we are busily pouring ever-increasing
intellectual efforts into improving our means, we have forgotten
the ends they are intended to achieve. Do we really know what we
want ? <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; This question is more likely to be answered in the
Alternative literature of protest, the theme of vagabondage, and
the exploration of individual human consciousness via drugs, Zen
Buddhism, Yoga, esotericism, Buddha, the Hermetic arts, alchemy,
visionary experience, Tantra, <i>hesychast</i> methods,
hypostatic union of Christ and man, and all the charismas of the
spirit. Those who affirm that the real truth and source of all
human joy and happiness lies wholly 'within' must try, with
whatever means they can get, to break the hold of that view of
life which has replaced the potentialities of the human mind with
the perspective of its mechanical extensions, the extensions of
transportation and social planning and mass conditioning which
are now turning on the body and strangling it as the serpents did
at Laocoon. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Modern society is growing infertile, devoid of a
living culture, no longer productive of any personal form, an
abstract, lifeless, cinematic world of machine-made
interpretations about the self. It is not surprising therefore if
we tell ourselves that all revelatory experience is foolishness,
so much so that man sees himself increasingly as nothing but an
'energy slave' or a cipher on the face of a moral and spiritual
void. And as the knowledge of his own disorientation cannot be
handled within the framework of so-called normality, he turns
more and more to his brave world of machines. And through the
power of his machines he acts out the uncomprehended tragedy of
man's inner disruption. Yet it was the Ancient Chinese Sage,
Huang Tzu, who proposed some 2500 years ago that dependence even
on a simple kind of machine causes man to become uncertain of his
own inner impulses; and further, the result may lead him to
forget how to master his own world. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; So we have learned instead how to master our
machines, because machines do not serve us unless we service
them, but in the process we have had to adjust our human
organization to our equipment. We tend to get what the machine
can best give us rather than what is most desirable. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For the rest &#133; I have tried to write this book
as an inwardly conceived and inwardly coherent work of fiction
that isn't exactly fiction, and only those who read it as a novel
will discover its real meaning. I hope that those who are
prepared to read the book in this spirit will catch a glimpse,
not so much of a utopia possible in theory, but rather of an
attitude of mind capable of attainment in practice, in which all
problems of modern technological existence will appear to be
solved, that irreconcilable contradictions will pass away, and a
newer and fuller significance of individual human existence will
be revealed. In this connection, I can do no better than to refer
the reader to Aldous Huxley's last novel, <i>Island</i> (1962),
which is a very imaginative effort to protect a way of life based
in nature, that is lived organically as a flowing growing
process. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; According to his brother, Sir Julian Huxley, Aldous
took LSD eleven times, gaining thereby 'new extensions of his
perception of beauty and transcendence'. Huxley believed that
from LSD the individual could achieve what the poet Cowper called
'a closer walk with God'. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For myself, I believe I have investigated the
phenomenon LSD&#151;these words!&#151;as much towards this same
spiritual end as my intelligence and faculties permitted me to
go. And perhaps the long, arduous, oppressive decade I passed
through came to benefit at least one creative effort. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And how do I now think of LSD <i>et al.?</i>&#151;as
certain truths about the nature of my inner self came to be
manifest in my conscious mind, my interest in psychedelics began
to wane proportionately, so that today I do not believe that LSD
can help me towards self-realisation. It had never been more than
preliminary, one may say, a pretext to me to explore inwardness
and unfamiliar mental states for whatever they might reveal. But
LSD has nothing more to give me. And I am therefore determined to
return to the world, and in time, to integrate myself with it. In
relation to any religious beliefs I now hold, I am a confessed
Franciscan, though I freely admit that I have a very long way to
go before I shall be able to express this outwardly&#151;with my
entire being&#151;the love Saint Francis of Assisi showed was for
all living creatures, and in respect to love of this kind, I must
to this extent be regarded as clumsy. Yet in Saint Francis
evolved Love of the very highest order for his delicate and
feminine sensibility offered Love a unique possibility of
manifestation. And thus, in the light of this knowledge, I can no
longer take my psychedelic trips seriously. I know that many
readers, and by no means the worst among them, would disapprove
of such measures as taking LSD; one should be strong enough, they
say, to exist by faith without the aid of drugs. Yes! One should
be, but what if one is too weak? <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And the impulse which now drives me back into the
world is precisely the same as that which drives so many into
monasteries or to keep the offices of prayer&#151;the desire for
self-realisation. <br>
