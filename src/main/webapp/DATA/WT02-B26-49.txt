<A NAME = "antip"><H2>ANTI-PSYCHOTICS UNDER DEVELOPMENT</H2></A>

<P>

The following anti-psychotic agents are presently in various stages of development and trial for approval.  (Information from NARSAD Research Newsletter, summer 1994.)



<P>



Seroquel (dibenzothiazepine)



<P>



Seroquel is a novel anti-psychotic agent intended for treatment of schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders.  It exhibits a high affinity for brain serotonin type 2 (5-HT2) receptors and a low affinity for D2 receptors, a profile similar to that of clozapine.



<P>



In early clinical trials, Seroquel appears to be a safe an well-tolerated agent with low EPS (extra pyramidal syndrome).  Like clozapine, Seroquel does not appear to cause increase serum prolactin levels.  (Elevated serum prolactin levels are frequently associated with standard anti-psychotic agents and can result in unwanted side effects in women such as breast tenderness and milk discharge.)



<P>



The most frequently reported adverse effects in initial clinical trials include somnolence, dizziness, agitation, insomnia, and headache.  Unlike clozapine, agranulocytosis has not been observed on Seroquel, and  it is hoped that routine monitoring of the white blood cell count will not be required.  Zenaca Pharmaceuticals expects Seroquel to be available in the marketplace in late 1995.



<P>



Lanzac (olanzapine)



<P>



Olanzapine possesses anti-psychotic activity with a low tendency to evoke EPS.  In its early trials, Lanzac is showing promise a an atypical anti-psychotic.



<P>



Unlike standard anti-psychotics, which improve mainly positive symptoms, patients taking Lanzac exhibited fewer positive and negative symptoms.  Thus far, no agranulocytosis and only transient increases in prolactin levels have been reported.  Eli Lily is in phase III of its clinical trials for Lanzac.



<P>



Sertindole



<P>



Sertindole has been shown in animal studies to have selectivity for the dopamine neurons that project to the limbic system (thought to be involved in the production of psychotic systems) rather than the dopaminergic neurons that project to the basal ganglia (believed to be involved in the production of EPS).  It has been suggested that clozapine acts in a similar way.



<P>



Serindole has been found to be generally well tolerated with minimal EPS side effects during the phase II trials just completed.  Discovered and patented by H. Lundbect A/S (Copenhagen, Denmark), Serindole is licensed to Abbott Laboratories for development in the United States and Canada.  A new drug application is expected to be filed in 1995.



<P>



Ziprasidone (CP-88,059)



<P>



Ziprasidone, a combined 5HT2/D2 antagonist (meaning it blocks these particular receptors), bears some pharmacological similarity to respiridone, a newly approved anti-psychotic with a low incidence of EPS when taken at low to moderate doses.  Ziprasidone is an inhibitor of norepinephrine reuptake, a property it shares with some antidepressant medications.  Pfizer has just initiated phase III trials in the United States and Europe.

<A NAME = "antid"><H2>ANTIDEPRESSANT CLEARED FOR U.S. USE</H2></A>



<P>



Nefazadone HCI (Serzone), a new antidepressant that blocks presynaptic reuptake of serotonin that has been reported to be unlike currently available SSRIs was cleared recently by the FDA.  Already approved for routine clinical use in Canada and the United Kingdom, nefazadone's dual mechanism of action could be related to the fact that it poses a reduced risk of an array of side effects that have been associated with increases in postsynaptic 5-HT2 stimulation. 



<P>



These include the agitation now associated with a number of SSRI agents, the sleep disturbances associated with both depression and use of SSRI agents, and suicide ideation, which has also been associated with an up-regulation of 5-HT2.

What You Need to Know About Benzodiazepines



<P>



Common benzodiazepines:

 Ativan ..... lorazepam<br>



 Azene ..... chlorazepate<br>



 Centrax ..... prazepam<br>



 Clonopin ..... clonazepam<br>



 Dalmane ..... flurazepam<br>



 Halcion ..... triazolam<br>



 Librium ..... chlordiazepoxide<br>



 Paxipam ..... halazepam<br>



 Restoril ..... temazepam<br>

 Valium ..... diazepam<br>



 Xanax ..... alprazolam<br>



<P>



Everyone experiences anxiety at one time or an other --



"butterflies in the stomach" before giving a speech, sweaty



palms during a job interview, or occasional sleeplessness. Other



symptoms of anxiety include irritability, uneasiness, jumpiness,



feelings of apprehension, tight muscles, rapid or irregular



heartbeat, stomach ache, nausea, faintness, and breathing



problems.



<P>



Anxiety is often manageable and mild. But some times it can



present serious problems. A high level or prolonged state of



anxiety can be very incapacitating, making the activities of



daily life difficult or impossible.



<P>



A number of treatments are available to people who suffer from



anxiety disorders and insomnia. Physicians most widely recommend



either an anti-anxiety medication or behavioral therapy, or



both.



<P>



The most commonly prescribed drugs for anxiety disorders are



benzodiazepines. They are also used as muscle relaxants, to



treat insomnia, and to control severe epileptic seizures. They



are effective in treating some forms of depression, and anxiety



associated with depression and schizophrenia.



<P>



What are benzodiazepines?



<P>



Benzodiazepines are a class of medicines with a similar chemical



structure. There are a number of brand name medicines within the



benzodiazepine category(e.g. Ativan, Halcion, Restoril, Valium



and Zanies). Each of the brand products has slightly different



properties.



<P>



Benzodiazepines are relatively fast-acting drugs. Most begin to



take effect within hours, some in even less time. Dosage



generally starts at a low level and is gradually increased until



symptoms diminish. Dosage varies a great deal depending on



symptoms and an individual's body chemistry.



<P>



What do they do to the brain?



<P>



People with serious forms of anxiety demonstrate chronic



overactivity in the areas of the brain associated with fear or



nervousness. An inhibitory neurotransmitter, gamma



aminobutyricacid (GABA) works in these areas to diminish this



excessive nerve cell activity.



<P>



There is evidence that benzodiazepines cause an increase in



the activity of GABA, thereby returning the system to a normal



level and reducing the associated symptoms of anxiety.They are



also believed to decrease the turnover rate of the



neurotransmitters, serotonin and norepinephrine.



<P>



Are they also useful in treating muscle spasms and epileptic



attacks?



<P>



Yes. And they've been successful in treating the toxic psychoses



caused by hallucinogenic drugs. They have many possible safe



medical uses.



<P>



Are they also effective in treating Insomnia?



<P>



Yes. However, sleeping problems are often a symptom of other



medical conditions. It is important that the cause of poor sleep



is diagnosed so that appropriate treatment can be given. Once



diagnosed and treated, sleep generally returns to normal.



<P>



Are benzodiazepines used effectively to treat major mental



illness?



<P>



Benzodiazepines may be useful, in low doses, for patients with



schizophrenia who are beginning to show signs of relapse, and may



help to avoid the necessity of major in creases in neuroleptic



medication. They may also be useful in treating mania.



<P>



What are common side effects of benzodiazepines?



<P>



Benzodiazepines generally have few side effects. Drowsiness and



loss of coordination are sometimes reported. Most common is



daytime fatigue that many people find subsides within a week or



two.



<P>



Other less frequent side effects include headache, loss of



concentration and memory problems, nervousness, depression,



dizziness, dry mouth and nausea.



<P>



Benzodiazepines are not recommended during the first three months



of pregnancy. If side effects are severe or persistent, see your



physician.



<P>



Is there a potential for dependence on these drugs? What about



addiction to benzodiazepines?



<P>



Dependence on benzodiazepines has been reported when they have



been used continuously for many months or years. This does not



mean that patients are "addicted" to their medication. 



<P>



Addiction is a pattern of drug abuse characterized by an



overwhelming preoccupation with the use of a drug, including



buildup of a physical tolerance to the drug's effects and intense



drug-seeking behavior.



<P>



Addiction to benzodiazepines is considered rare, except among



persons who have been addicted to other sub stances, such as



cocaine or alcohol.



<P>



Evidence indicates that the great majority of patients who use



benzodiazepines appropriately for long periods do not tend to



increase their doses, do not use medicines for recreational



purposes and do not be come dependent on them.



<P>



In some cases, patients requiring long-term benzodiazepine



therapy can become dependent on their medication to function



normally, in the same way a diabetic patient is dependent on



insulin to function normally.



<P>



What If the drug is abruptly stopped?



<P>



It is important to know that a sudden stop in taking the drug can



produce a seizure. Patients should discontinue the medicine



gradually, under a doctor's supervision.



<P>



When the dosage is tapered off gradually, the effects are



minimal. Discontinuation symptoms are frequently con fused with



rebound symptoms and relapse. Consult with the doctor before



discontinuing a benzodiazepine.



<P>



What are the symptoms of withdrawal?



<P>



Withdrawal symptoms include anxiety, shakiness, head ache,



dizziness, sleeplessness, loss of appetite, and in more severe



cases, fever, seizures, and psychosis. A withdrawal reaction may



be mistaken for a return of the anxiety, since many of the



symptoms are similar.
