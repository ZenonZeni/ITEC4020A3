<IMG SRC="images/rules/linecolo.gif"><p>
I've got huge plans for this place, but nowhere near the time accomplish it all.<br>

<p>
I'd really love some <a href="mailto:scottyo@stoned.org">input</a> as to what people would like to see. But first let me give you some ideas as to where <i>I'd</i> 
like this site to go. I'd like to make <a href="index.html">Stoned.Org</a> <em>the</em> web site devoted to the joys of smoking, eating and otherwise ingesting marijuana. 
I figured that there are tons of sites commited to <a href="legalize.html">the legalization struggle</a>, <a href="hempedu.html">education about hemp</a>, and
<a href="commercial.html">commercial hemp products</a>, but I wanted to be about just plain getting stoned.
<p>
One of the things I'd like to do is develop the largest collection of ganja food recipes on the net. Look for the beginnings of that project soon. 
I'd love it if people would <a href="mailto:submissions@stoned.org">submit to me</a> any and all recipes they may have, along with any
comments about the preparation, and whether or not you'd like to be listed as the submitter.
<p>
Another project I'm working on is an online glass pipe museum/gallery. If you have a glass pipe and access to a scanner, then why not take a picture and send it to me?
Some suggestions, colored pipes will look best when photographed against a black background, and daylight is the best way to bring out the colors. You can 
<a href="mailto:submissions@stoned.org">send them to me</a>, but I may soon have an ftp upload directory for anonymous submissions. Either send the files as gifs or jpegs,
but I'll probobly compress them to jpeg for the pages. Again, please tell me whether or not you would like to be listed as the submitter.
<p> 
Finally, for now, I would like to offer free hosting for any related material in need of a home. If you have anything , anything at all , I'm willing to consider it.
Pictures, icons, cursors, waves and especially midi's will all be glady rewarded with a home for all to access and enjoy. Original web pages (comics, poems, art, etc...) having to anything to do 
with getting high (marijuana only !) will be happily placed in the <a href="index.html">stoned.org</a> domain.
I beg , please help me ! <a href="mailto:submissions@stoned.org">Send me stuff !</a>
