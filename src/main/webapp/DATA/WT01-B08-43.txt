        BLOCK BEEF IMPORTS </b></font><img

        width="200" height="148"><p><font face="Arial"><strong>SANTIAGO</strong>.
        The Chilean Appeals Court ruled favourably a demand from
        local cattle farmers virtually blocking the import of
        beef from Mercosur countries mainly Argentina.<br>
        Chilean cattle breeders have openly opposed Chile's
        association with Mercosur arguing that imports of
        agricultural commodities from these countries would ruin
        farmers.<br>
        The judicial decision, only once month after Chile's
        association to Mercosur, came as a shock to Argentine
        exporters who so far this year have sold 75 million US
        dollars of beef to Chile and were rapidly becoming a
        dominant force in the local market.<br>
        Chilean farmers claim that the Argentine beef does not
        comply with local typification regulations and is below
        quality standards.<br>
        Argentina described the decision as &quot;<em>inadmissable</em>&quot;
        in commercial terms, and said Chilean cattle farmers were
        complaining simply because they can't compete with
        Argentine beef, which has lower costs and higher quality.<br>
        &quot;<em>Chilean supermarkets and consumers only have
        praise for Argentine beef which so far has captured 30%
        of the top market</em>&quot;, said Felipe Solá, the
        Argentine Agriculture Minister.<br>
        The appeal was filed against the Chilean government by
        the ultraconservative National Agricultural Society
        (SNA), which has a strong backing in the Chilean
        Congressional opposition.<br>
        Although President Frei's administration can appeal to
        the Chilean Supreme Court, the ruling can block beef
        trade for weeks upsetting Mercosur partners.<br>
        In spite of the fact that the Frei administration has
        promised farmers 500 millions US dollars in compensation
        funds over several years, which was part of the deal for
        the Chilean Senate to vote the association agreement, the
        SNA has consistently rejected Mercosur and has also self
        excluded itself from all the main agricultural shows.<br>
        According to SNA officials Mercosur beef imports so far
        this year have caused losses of over 100 US million
        dollars because of the drop in cattle and land prices.</font></p>

        &quot;EFFICIENCY&quot; OF MERCOSUR</b></font><p><font
        face="Arial">&nbsp;<strong>WASHINGTON</strong>. A
        continental controversy literally exploded when a report
        by one of the main economists of the World Bank described
        Mercosur as &quot;an artificial world of growth, where
        inefficient industries prosper behind a wall of trade
        barriers&quot;.<b><br>
        </b>The first critical report was followed by a second
        praising Mercosur as a &quot;positive and important
        initiative similar to the first steps given by the Common
        Market&quot;, and letters of apologies to officials of
        the 4 plus one block.<br>
        But far from discrediting Mercosur, the reports revealed
        a strong struggle inside the World Bank where experts and
        economists seem to be divided concerning trade block
        policies.<br>
        On the one side are the fundamentalists who preach
        complete free market and private enterprise, and
        elimination of trade tariffs to all commercial partners,
        while on the other are those who believe that economic
        block associations can be moderately inefficient but
        compensate as the market consolidates, gains in
        credibility and reduces risks to foreign investments.<br>
        Besides the first report was leaked when the World Bank
        officially recommended foreign investors to consider
        &quot;Mercosur a serious option&quot;, and also revealed
        that in the last five years the multirateral institution
        has loaned 32 billion US dollars to Latinamerica.<br>
        To make things worse the World Bank as part of a
        decentralization program has moved its Mexican Department
        to Mexico City and is planning something similar with
        Brazil, one of the main clients of the bank.<br>
        Nevertheless the fundamentalists received some help since
        their critical report was almost simultaneous with an
        official claim before the World Trade Organization from
        the United States and Japan, against Brazil and Argentina
        for their closed automovile industry regimes.<br>
        The controversy which happened to take the Mercosur block
        as an example is expected to be one of the main issues of
        the December meeting of the World Trade Organization to
        be held in Singapur.<br>
        Meantime for the World Bank, &quot;in the context of
        growing regional globalization, Mercosur promises with
        time, to improve competitivity and therefore is still
        considered a positive and important initiative&quot;. </font></p>

        The lack of an &quot;<em>active industrial policy</em>&quot;
        and the risks of the &quot;<em>Brazil dependency</em>&quot;
        have become the main topics of debate between the
        Argentine government and certain industries who feel they
        are rapidly loosing ground to a more aggresive and
        pragmatic Brazilian trade partner.<br>
        The first shots were fired by one of the main industrial
        tycoons of Argentina with important interests in
        automovile manufacturing.<br>
        &quot;<em>We are running the risk of becoming a Brazilian
        province, not necessarily because that is the aim of our
        northern neighbours but because we lack an active
        industrial policy</em>&quot;, said Francisco Macri who
        assembles Fiat and Peugeot in Argentina.<br>
        The Argentine administration immediately replied with
        statistics of industrial exports which have more than
        doubled during the last twelve months.<br>
        But in spite of the controversy trade between Argentina
        and Brazil in the framework of Mercosur, is booming with
        record Argentine oil and agrobusiness exports, while
        Brazilians are effectively taking the upper hand of the
        market in several industries.<br>
        Analysts also point towards the vulnerable political
        moments the two main Mercosur partners are going through:
        Argentina is still suffering the consequences of a severe
        recession and unemployment, and the Brazilian government
        is under pressure from strong local industrial
        protectionist groups which are showing their muscle just
        when President Henrique Cardoso is discussing with
        Congress a constitutional reform which should open the
        door for his reelection and the continuity of the present
        economic development program. </font></p>

        Mexico in the mid term will be discussing a block
        association agreement which will substitute the bilateral
        treaties with the four full members of Mercosur.<b><br>
        </b>Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo made the
        announcement during the official dinner to host Uruguayan
        president Julio María Sanguinetti who is visiting Mexico
        with a numerous business delegation.<br>

        impressive progress in recent years</em>&quot;, remarked
        Zedillo.<br>
        Both Mexico and the Mercosur countries are limited in
        their possibilities of further regional understandings
        unless all members agree.<br>
        So far Mercosur has a main block of countries with a
        basic common external tariff, Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay
        and Paraguay; a 4 to 1 association with Chile and next
        December in Fortaleza during the regular biannual
        presidential summit, Boliva and Venezuela are expected to
        sign association agreements.</font></p>

        genesis</em>&quot;, according to the president of the
        Latinamerican Committee of the European Parliament.<br>
        Spanish representative Gerardo Galeote, on a short visit
        to Argentina and Brazil, remarked that Europe was most
        interested in the political aspects of the Mercosur
        association and in promoting trade in certain areas such
        as fisheries.<br>
        &quot;<em>Our European experience indicates that in an

        background, a joint foreign affaris expression, and a

        The European representative also indicated that Mercosur
        has better prospects than Nafta (North American Trade
        Agreement) since Mexico is suffering serious financial
        and political difficulties.<br>
        Finally Galeote underlined that in spite of the fact that
        Europe has become the main economic block of the world
        and is working towards a common currency and Central
        Bank, &quot;<em>we're advancing according to our
