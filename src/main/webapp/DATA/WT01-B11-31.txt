<H2> Mazda Weighs Plans </H2>

<BLOCKQUOTE> Mazda is weighing plans to market a hydrogen fueled auto
said to outperform electric vehicles. One of the biggest remaining
questions is when to start. Mazda says timing of the launch hinges on a
government program to develop a hydrogen fuel distribution
network. Japan's MITI reportedly aims to have infrastructure in place to
support widespread use of hydrogen as a transport fuel by 2010. Mazda
claims its hydrogen vehicle - based on a Wankel rotary engine - has a
range of 230 km and a top speed of 150 km/hr. By comparison, the
automaker says, electric vehicles typically can travel no more than 180
km without recharging and achieve top speeds of 130 km/hr, while
gasoline fueled cars have ranges as high as 590 km and top speeds of 183
km/hr. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<H2> <A NAME = "test"> The Search for Low-pollution Vehicles Continues </H2>

Mazda has begun a two year trial period for its experimental
low-pollution hydrogen rotary engine (RE) vehicle.  The Cappella Cargo
van model vehicle will burn a hydrogen fuel that when burned will not
emit carbon dioxide.  <A HREF = "mazda.html">Mazda</A> will lend the
vehicle to the Hirohata Steel Mill for use as their company van and
driven for at least 20,000 kilometers.

From: monito@ (<A HREF="../index1.html">Alan Marr</A>)
Subject: Hydrogen Rotaries: the facts
</PRE>

<P> Mazda Hydrogen fueled cars have all been rotaries:

<PRE>
HR-X1  not hydride, 2 seat, spacy commuter look.
HR-X2  metal hydride, 4 seat, dowdy.
MX-5   metal hydride, Miata body, front twin rotor, rear drive.
</PRE>

<P> Hydrogen has a low ignition temperature so the standard four stroke
engine is prone to pre-detonation and backfiring through the intake
ports.  The <A HREF="rce.html">rotary engine</A> separates the intake
ports from the combustion area so there are no hot spots in the intake
phase.

<P> The hydrogen Miata is 400 kg (880 lb) heavier than the standard car.
This is partly because a 300 kg (660 lb) H2 fuel tank replaces the
standard 50 kg (110 lb) for a full gasoline tank.
Thus it is encouraging that it performs as well as it does.
Intriguingly, the prototype has a left side driver (US).  Mazda also
has an electric prototype using fuel cells, also with a 400 kg
increase in weight.  MX-5 is the international designation of Miata.

<PRE>
			Gasoline	Hydrogen	Electric
Power (HP)              120             110
Top Speed kmh (mph)	183 (114)	150 (93)	130 (81)
0-40 kmh (25 mph) sec	  2.5		  2.9		  4.2
0-100 kh (62 mph) sec	  9.4		 13.0		 21.5
Refueling time            3 minute?      15 minute       hours?
</PRE>

<P> The view from the driver's seat:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
    Inside the hydrogen car, everything is standard apart from a small
    pressure instrument - the fuel gauge...  Starting the hydrogen car
    is no different from starting the petrol model, and engine noise
    sounds familiar too.
</BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE>
    ... the intake system combines a pre-mix air/fuel system for light
    load driving...  There is also a direct-injection system through a
    dedicated hydrogen port which opens when the air intake port is
    closed.  This is effective in increasing available power for
    higher speed driving...
</BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE>
    When the fuel pressure gets low, the power drops noticeably and
    the car slows dramatically.  Changing down the gears makes little
    or no appreciable difference and even with 20 percent pressure
    available, the car is effectively unable to carry on.  Refuelling
    these prototypes takes about 15 minutes from start to finish.
</BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE>
    The electric car is completely different...  There is very little
    engine braking so you have to start using the brakes much earlier
    than normal.  And the engine is virtually silent, which make tire
    and wind noise much more apparent.
</BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE>
    Battery technology is holding up the whole electric car movement:
    development has failed to produce a satisfactory alternative to
    nickel cadmium batteries (like those in the Mazda) or the standard
    lead acid type which cause so many of the problems.  They make
    electric cars heavy, expensive, and poor performers, with very few
    miles possible between each lengthy charge-up.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P> Mazda is investing much more heavily in hydrogen research than
electricity.  Seiji Tanaka, head of Mazda R&#38;D, says

<BLOCKQUOTE>
    Our first objective is to use available fuels more efficiently by
    producing better engines.  At present we are researching the
    Miller cycle and developing lean-burn technology.  Our second
    objective is to investigate alternative fuels such as natural gas
    and methanol and electric cars.  But this will not cut pollution.
    Hydrogen offers many advantages over all these, especially
    electric cars, and with the rotary fuelled by hydrogen,
    performance is very close to the petrol engine.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P> Japan's MITI is sponsoring the New Sunshine Project.  The goal is to
use hydrogen power "to replace 3 percent of electrical power, 10
percent of city gas use and 5 percent of transportation energy supply
by 2010".

<P> Mazda is trying to convince the California Air Resources Board to
admit the hydrogen rotary as a Zero Emission vehicle.  The issue is
the tiny amounts of hydrocarbon output because of the engine
lubricant.

<P> Hydrogen faces infrastructure hurdles and public concern over safety.
Metal hydrides are a safe mobile storage method.  Hydrogen is in some
ways safer than gasoline since the vapour rises into the atmosphere
and doesn't collect on the ground.

<H2> <A NAME="HRX-2"> HRX-2 at 30th Tokyo Motor Show </H2>

<P> Mazda's HRX-2 "is powered by a hydrogen burning rotary engine and
has a virutally 100% recyclable body structure.  It's been developed
with the potential to use liquid-crystal polymer fibre-reinforced
plastic.  This plastic is in the process of further research for
practical use.  The plastic-made upper-body can be easily detached from
the metal chassis.  The electrical and control systems are integrated
into one area.  Therefore, this structure makes it easier to disassemble
the body and to sort, by material make-up.  The HRX-2 is an updated
version of the HR-X which was exhibited at the 29th Tokyo Motor Show.
it has improvements in driving performance and cruising range."

<P> Mazda Motor Corp is already bench-testing a Miata equipped with a
hydrogen-powered rotary engine as part of its bid to be the first
automobile manufacturer to market a hydrogen-powered vehicle.  Mazda
expects the vehicle to have a one-tank range of 248 miles, which is
twice as long as that of the HR-X concept car shown at the 1991 Tokyo
Motor Show.  The hydrogen-powered rotary engine is also being tested in
Mazda's Capella Cargo wagon.

combustion engines, but makes no specific mention of the RCE.

<H2> Mazda Advances Environmentally-Correct HR-X:  Powered by Hydrogen </H2>

<P> The refined Mazda HR-X shown above is a concept car that runs on
pure, renewable hydrogen, and emits primarily only water vapor.  It has
been improved since its original debut in 1991 by Mazda engineers to
improve its performance and increase its fuel efficiency. The Mazda
vehicle shows that hydrogen can be safely used as a fuel.

<P> The metal hydride tank is shown being fueled below, with one
hydrogen fuel line, and two lines which run cooling water through the
tank.  During refueling, the metal hydride in the tank warms as it
absorbs hydrogen, and the water cools it to allow more to be
absorbed. When the engine is running, the warm engine coolant water is
circulated through the tank to warm the metal hydride, causing the
hydrogen fuel to be released.

<P> Unlike piston-engines, the rotary engine has separate intake and
combustion chambers.  This allows the rotary engine to avoid the
backfiring and preignition problems that other engines have experienced.
The rotor draws the air and hydrogen in as it passes the top of the
cycle, then moves the mixture to the lower right and compresses it,
where it is ignited to drive the engine.

<P> The HR-X hydrogen car's rotary engine delivers 100 horsepower, which
is nearly the same as the <A HREF = "rx-7.html">original RX-7</A>.  This
concept car, shown at the Tokyo Motor Show, and auto shows in New York
and Los Angeles, has generated much excitement and public awareness of
hydrogen as a fuel with today's technology.  Mazda's break ahead of the
other auto companies is truly an advancement to the solar hydrogen
industry.

<H2> Remarks at Solar Hydrogen Industrial Workshop at UCLA, Ca, Feb. 8,
1993 </H2>

<P> Vahe Kluejian, Manager of Research, Mazda Motor Company:

<P> Mazda developed the hydrogen fueled rotary engine as an option to
meet new emission standards.  The rotary engine is more difficult to
reduce emissions in, except with hydrogen.  With the oncoming ZEV,
hydrogen is the future fuel.  Mazda plans to use metal hydrides or any
nonliquid for safety.  Their main problem has been convincing regulators
that hydrogen is viable.  Mazda has built three test vehicles, and more
are being built for real-world standards for fleet testing and
demonstration.  Mazda's hydrogen car can be made commercial in 1998-2000
per the ZEV specification.
