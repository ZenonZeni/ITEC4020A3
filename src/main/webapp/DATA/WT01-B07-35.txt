<H1><B>AIRBASE</B> Bibliographic Database</H1>
<HR>

<P>
<B>AIRBASE</B> is the Bibliographic Database of the International
Energy Agency's Air Infiltration and Ventilation Centre. It contains
abstracts of articles and publications related to energy efficient
ventilation. Topics include:
<UL>
<LI>ventilation strategies,
<LI>design and retrofit methods,
<LI>calculation techniques,
<LI>standards and regulations,
<LI>measurement methods,
<LI>indoor air quality and energy implications.
</UL>

<P>
Entries are based on articles and reports published in journals,
internal publications and research reports, produced both by university
departments and by building research institutions throughout the
world.
<P>
<B>AIRBASE</B> has grown and evolved over many years. It is now
available on floppy disk or <A HREF="cdrom.html" >CD-ROM </A>
to organisations in <A href="countries.html" >participating countries  
</A>of the AIVC. It runs on IBM-compatible Personal Computers
under either of the DOS or MS Windows environments.
<P>
Based on easy-to-use IDEALIST software, from Blackwell Scientific
Publications, <B>AIRBASE</B> is extremely user-friendly. It allows
access to relevant bibliographic information within minutes. It
is an essential aid for anyone wishing to undertake ventilation
research and design.
<P>
Features of <B>AIRBASE</B> include <EM>free text</EM> searching,
combined with search narrowing or widening. It is also possible
to search individual fields, such as <EM>keywords</EM> or <EM>authors
</EM>.<BR>

<P>
For example, if you were to search for 'radon' or 'energy conservation',
<B>AIRBASE</B> would then put together a list of abstracts which
concern either of those topics. Full instructions for the extremely
straightforward <B>AIRBASE</B> are included in the documentation
accompanying the product.
<P>
<B>AIRBASE</B> requires at least 20 MB of available hard-disk
space, DOS 3.1 or above and an INTEL 286 processor or better.
This means that it should work on almost any of the common IBM
clones. It will also work well on portable PCs, making it ideal
for mobile use.
<P>
<B>AIRBASE</B> is updated on a regular basis, every three months.
Copies of all abstracted publications are available through the
International library service of the <A href="address.html" >AIVC  
</A>.
<P>
To receive more information about <B>AIRBASE</B> please fill in
<A href="/cgi-bin/aivc/airform.pl" >this  </A>order form. Alternatively,
download a <A href="sample.zip" >free demo version  </A>(contains
only a small subset of the records). This version works on PCs
with Windows 3.1 or later. The cost is &#163;150 UK pounds (plus
UK Value Added Tax (VAT) at 17.5%, where applicable). Available
to participants only.
