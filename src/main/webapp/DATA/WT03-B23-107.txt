<P>
<B><h3>INTRODUCTION</h3></B>
<P>
A previously unreleased report by Victoria Police
on the Impact of Equal Opportunity on Policing in Victoria , obtained
by the Federation of Community Legal Centres under Freedom of
Information legislation, reveals that Victoria Police unlawfully
discriminate against women.  This discrimination contravenes equal
opportunity legislation. 
<P>
The purpose of this report, <I>`Brute Force - The
Need for Affirmative Action in the Victoria Police Force'</I>,
is to identify recruitment policies and practices that prohibit
equal participation by women in the police force.  `Brute Force'
recommends crucial changes to the recruitment and promotion practices
that have historically institutionalised unlawful discrimination
within the force and promoted a work place culture out of step
with community expectations and attitudes.   
<P>
The preamble to the <I>Victorian Equal Opportunity
Act 1984</I> states that it is `An Act to render unlawful certain
kinds of discrimination, to promote equality of opportunity between
persons of different status...and for other purposes.' 
<P>
Discrimination against female applicants to the police
force and female police officers takes the form of discrimination
in recruitment and promotion along with sexual harassment and
inequitable working conditions.
<P>
Unlawful discrimination in recruitment denies those
women in Victoria who wish to join the force a fair chance of
gaining such employment. It ensures that those women who are successful
in obtaining such employment remain only a small minority unable
to challenge a status quo that largely excludes female experience
and perspectives. The marginal position of women in the police
force is reinforced by discrimination in promotion which contributes
to the small number of women in the higher ranks of the force.
<P>
The small number of female officers and females in
senior positions combined with the attitudes that underlie discrimination
in recruitment and employment has implications for the type of
service women in the community receive from the police force.
 It also has implications for policing practices generally.
<P>
It is essential that the issue of discriminatory
recruitment and promotion practises be addressed immediately in
light of the coalition government's election promise to increase
the number of police by one thousand.   
<P>
<B><h3>MEN AND WOMEN IN THE POLICE FORCE</h3></B>
<P>
As at June, 1992, women made up 14.4% of the 10,025
members in the Victoria Police. Of the 447 police who are of the
rank of Inspector or higher, only 8 (or 1.8%) are women. As in
1991, there were 6 Inspectors and 1 Chief Inspector and 1 Assistant
Commissioner.
<P>
In the Metropolitan area women make up about twenty
per cent of police but in the country they make up less than ten
per cent of police numbers. The small number of female police
in country areas, maternity leave and other forms of leave that
female officers take, result in vast geographical areas not having
access to female officers.  The implications of this are discussed
further on in this report. 
<P>
Female police are largely confined to welfare, domestic
and administrative roles within the police force.  While women
make up the majority of members within the Community Policing
Squad (CPS) they are not represented, or very poorly represented,
in what are considered `real' policing areas, such as the Criminal
Investigation Branch (CIB), The Homicide Squad, The Special Operations
Group and Search and Rescue.  It is no coincidence that the squads
that exclude women altogether are considered the elite in the
police force.  The Homicide Squad which has never had a female
member is described as the `elite of the elite' within the force.
 The Special Operations Group has always been an all male squad
 and is also know as the `Sons of God'. A name that signals that
the squad is both elite and for men only.
<P>
At least one former police officer has commented
publicly that the integration of female police into operational
duties has had a bad effect on morale in the force.
<P>
The report predicts that based on trends over the
previous five years, the proportion of females in the Victoria
Police in 1993 will be in excess of 17% of total strength.  This
prediction has not proved accurate.
<P>
Given that in the last four years, the proportion
of females in the force has increased from 14% to only 14.4%,
the estimate was unduly optimistic particularly given the decline
in the success of female applicants to the force since 1988, as
discussed below.<BR>

<P>
<B><h3>RECRUITMENT</h3></B>
<P>
The report acknowledges that women who apply to join
the police force are more likely to fail to gain admittance than
males who apply to join. There are four tests required to be taken
by applicants to the force each of which must be passed in order
for the applicant to be admitted. These four tests are an education
test; an agility test; an interview with a selection panel; and
a medical examination.  <BR>

<P>
<I><B>The Agility Test</B></I>
<P>
The major reason so few women are recruited is that
they fail to pass a physical agility test. A new agility test
was introduced in January 1989. The report states that since the
introduction of this test the female pass rate dropped 24% from
57% in 1988 to 33% in 1989, while the male pass rate remained
at 88%.  The report does not provide any explanation as to why
the test was introduced.  The agility test discriminates against
women in a number of ways.
<P>
The agility test includes a fat test.  The current
body fat measures allow males 21% body fat and females 24% body
fat.  The  body fat rates for an average male is 18% and a female
is 28%. Women naturally have greater than 10% more body fat than
men.  Women have more fat cells than men, and the cells are larger.
  The test requires that females must have four per cent <I><B>less</B></I>
body fat than the average female while males who pass are allowed
three per cent<B> <I>more</I></B> body fat than the average male.
 In other words women need to be leaner than average to pass the
force's fat test while men can be flabbier than average and still
pass. However, the report erroneously states that the allowable
body fat ratios accurately represent the physiological differences
between men and women.  The fat test requirement is clearly discrimination
within the definition of discrimination in the <I>Equal Opportunity
Act 1984</I> in that it is more difficult for females to pass
such a test than males and it is not a reasonable test.
<P>
In addition the agility tests has a pronounced emphasis
on upper body strength.  Just over two-thirds of female applicants
fail the part of the agility test which requires great upper body
strength.  Only 11% of male applicants fail these tests.
<P>
Women, relative to men have more strength in their
lower body than upper body. Women's leg strength is significantly
closer to men's than is their arm strength.  Whilst a test that
looked at overall strength would fail more women than men, because
on average men are stronger than women, a test which primarily
tests upper body strength will fail significantly more women than
men. 
<P>
The report comments that applicants who fail the
test can go away and build themselves up and apply for the test
again.  This does not address the question of discrimination but
amounts to advising those people who fail, mainly women, to go
away and work to make themselves more like men. The agility test,
like the fat test, discriminates unlawfully against women.<BR>

<P>
<I><B>Selection Panel Interviews</B></I>
<P>
An interview before a Selection Panel assesses the
applicants character, background, motivation, capability, maturity,
social attitudes and general suitability for a police career.
 More female applicants than male fail this test.
<P>
Forty-four per cent of female recruits surveyed for
the report claimed to have experienced sex discrimination in the
interview, including sexist language, disparaging comments, questions
of marital status and comments on female ineffectiveness or their
physical limitations, despite the fact that these women had already
passed the agility test.  No males claimed that they had experienced
sex discrimination in the interview. Selection panels have been
predominantly all male and there is no policy on gender composition
of panels, unlike the Public Service which requires mixed-gender
panels. The report claims that these problems have now been addressed.
 However there is no indication that there is a policy in place
which requires women on the selection panels. Given the problems
with the panels in the past such a policy is obviously necessary
to ensure that women applicants are not discriminated against.
 Such a policy is also necessary to ensure that men with inappropriate
attitudes toward women are not accepted into the force.   <BR>

<P>
<I><B>Education and Medical Examinations</B></I>
<P>
These two tests appear to be fair and not to involve
discrimination against female applicants.
<P>
<B><h3>PROMOTION </h3></B>
<P>
Those women who become police are less likely than
men to be promoted in the force. As stated previously, the report
found that females are proportionately under represented in the
higher ranks of the Victoria Police. It also found that a much
higher proportion of females with more than ten years service
had not attained the supervisory ranks of their male counterparts.
 There has been virtually no change in the representation of women
in the higher ranks in the past ten years.
<P>
When a police officer is eligible for promotion,
selection for a position involves a procedure of application and
screening. A selection panel is usually convened to assess the
relative efficiency and suitability of applicants for appointment
to a position. The panel then recommends the most suitable applicant.

<P>
A selection panel <I><B>must</B></I> be convened
for appointment to all officers positions, and all positions of
Senior Sergeant in charge of a police station.
<P>
Selection panels comprise a convenor, who must be
at least two ranks senior to the vacant position and have management
responsibility for the position; an independent member appointed
from outside the district, who is at least one rank senior to
the position; a third member at least one rank senior to the position,
and should be in the immediate line supervisor/commander of the
position; and where appropriate, an additional member where the
position involves specialist or technical skills.
<P>
The guidelines stipulate that where a female member
is an applicant for the position, one member of the selection
panel, <I><B>where practicable</B></I>, should be a female member
at least one rank senior to the position.  However, the report
also makes it clear that the boards have usually been made up
of all male police officers.
<P>
 The report noted that there was evidence that female
applicants for promotions have been questioned on their marital
status, ability to combine policing with family commitments, and
their general capability to deal with male subordinates.  The
physical capabilities of females has also often been challenged.

<P>
The report found that across all ranks, but particularly
Sergeant rank and below, there was a degree of gender discrimination
in promotions boards and transfers. These factors no doubt contribute
to the low number of female high ranking policewomen.
<P>
 The <I>Equal Opportunity Act 1984</I> makes it unlawful
to discriminate in promotion.  Section 21(2) of the Act states:
<P>
  &quot;It is unlawful for an employer to discriminate
against an employee on the ground of status or by reason of the
private life of the employee -
<P>
  (a) by denying the employee access, or limiting
access by the employee, to opportunities for <I><B>promotion</B></I>,
transfer or training or to any other benefits connected with employment;&quot;
 
<P>
The report recommends that promotional board members
be given instructions and guidelines on the provisions of the
Equal Opportunity Act. This would include guidelines in interviewing
techniques incorporating Equal Opportunity issues being provided
to all potential promotion board members.
<P>
It is clear that there is a need for promotional
boards to be comprised of both males and females and the report
recommends this. However it waters down this recommendation by
including the words &quot;wherever possible&quot;, stating that
including males and females on these boards and panels may not
always be feasible with the low number of policewomen of officer
rank at present. This is a `Catch 22' situation. Women have been
discriminated against in promotion as a result of all male panels
and this has contributed to their small numbers in the higher
ranks of the force.  Because there are few women in the higher
ranks of the police force, panels will continue to be all male,
when their are not sufficient women of high enough rank to be
on them.  The absence of a clear affirmative action guidelines
on the composition of promotion boards will result in the continued
small number of policewomen of high rank.
<P>
In order to break this vicious cycle and to ensure
that there are more female police represented in higher ranks
there needs to be an adoption of affirmative action in the selection
of police for promotion.
<P>
Such a policy would go some way towards recognising
that there has been discrimination against women in the past and
that an increase in the number of female senior police is necessary
to ensure that female experience and perceptions are taken into
account in the implementation and formulation of police policy
and practise.   
<P>
<B><h3>FEMALE POLICE</h3></B>
<P>
<I><B>Employment conditions</B></I>
<P>
The report noted the absence of a number of key employment
conditions resulted in problems in staff retention. These conditions
included: part time policing, parental leave, job sharing and
the availability of child care facilities.  The lack of these
job conditions has a greater effect on female police than male
police.  As a result women are less likely to stay in the force
and further their policing careers. In addition  women will be
more likely than men to be discouraged from applying to join the
police force due to the lack of these employment conditions.
<P>
<I><B>Sexual Harassment</B></I>
<P>
The report found that sexually harassing behaviour
was quite common throughout the Victoria Police. What the report
describes as &quot;more serious incidents&quot; such as touching
and sexual advances, were believed to occur relatively infrequently.
However, more common behaviour such as displays of magazines and
pictures of a sexual nature and sexual jokes were viewed as &quot;part
of police culture&quot;, in spite of the fact that a large proportion
of both male and female police found such behaviour to be offensive.
  
<P>
An example of the sexist perceptions of gender roles
within the force appeared in the March 1992 edition of <I>Police
Life</I>, an official police force publication.  An article titled
`Not Just a Pretty Face', described the first  female policewoman
to receive a valour award as &quot;attractiv&quot;'. In a subsequent
<I>Police Life</I> edition, the editor admitted that had the subject
of the article been a policeman, the author (a male) would not
have used these descriptions, but still denied the use of these
descriptions amounted to sexism. 
<P>
The report found that 20% of police officers reported
having subordinates come to them with complaints of sexual harassment.
The most commonly reported complaint was of male supervisors harassing
junior females.   Women suffering sexual harassment within the
police force may find it difficult to complain about their treatment
within the force given that they will have to complain to someone
more senior who, in the overwhelming majority of cases, will be
a man and it is likely to be a superior who is the perpetrator
of the harassment.  
<P>
Sexual harassment is unlawful under section 20 (1)
(a) of the Equal Opportunity Act 1984.
<P>
In July, 1992, five Victorian policewomen lodged
a complaint with the Equal Opportunity Board. They claimed that
they had notified the police force but that no action had been
taken. The five women alleged that they were physically and sexually
harassed at a police station.
<P>
An article in <I>Police Life</I>, quoted the then
Assistant Commissioner, Bernice Masterson, on the subject of sexual
harassment. Former Assistant Commissioner Masterson said &quot;it
is exacerbated by our rank structure. Vast attitude changes would
be required for the problem to be completely wiped out. As the
more junior members come up through the ranks, possibly it will
be less of a problem as women are becoming far more accepted in
the force.&quot;  
<P>
Given the low representation of women in the ranks
of Sergeant, Senior Sergeant, Inspector and above, and the little
growth in the numbers of women in these ranks over the last ten
years, (see footnote 20) it is most probable that the problem
will remain for quite some time unless the force ensures that
affirmative action is practised in recruitment and promotion.
  
<P>
<B><h3>WOMEN'S EXPERIENCE OF POLICING</h3></B>
<P>
<I><B>Criminal Assault in the Home</B></I>
<P>
Criminal assault in the home is an extremely serious
and wide spread crime.  Women and children are largely the victims
of this crime and men the perpetrators. A woman is far more likely
to be assaulted in her home by a man she is or has been in a relationship
with than by a stranger.  By far the largest category of reported
homicides consist of those classed as `domestics' and in about
half of these homicides there had been at least one prior incident
of physical abuse, almost always involving the wife or defacto
partner as victim.<BR>

<P>
Police consistently fail to treat criminal assault
in the home as `real' police work and fail to enforce the law
to protect women and children.  Their inaction when it comes to
arresting violent offenders when the crime is assault in the home
places women and children in danger and serves to reinforce the
myth that violence against people in the home is not a crime.
 
<P>
Research undertaken into the behaviour of police
when dealing with domestic violence has found that the majority
hold sexist and stereotyped views about men and women. Attacks
by men upon women in the domestic context are excused by police
officers, on the basis that women ask for it, deserve their beating
or like violence. The violence against women in these situations
is trivialised and officers frequently identify with the man.
Women victims of assault are often perceived as hysterical and
mentally unstable. 
<P>
As one researcher put it, police cast women &quot;as
failures or oppressors and men as heroic victims&quot;.  These
attitudes are sometimes excused or explained on the grounds that
they only reflect attitudes in the community. While it is true
that surveys have found that an alarming significant minority
of the general public find domestic violence acceptable research
has shown that the <I><B>majority</B></I> of police have attitudes
which condone or excuse such violence.  Research comparing the
attitude of police and other professionals to domestic violence
found that police saw domestic violence as a less severe problem
than did any of the other professionals, showed the least sympathy
for the victim and held the most stereotyped view of women.  
The police are a public service paid to enforce the law. It is
unacceptable that these public servants are unable to offer services
to women in a non discriminatory fashion.  Most incidents of family
violence reported to the police occur outside normal business
hours.
<P>
Often the police are the only available service.
&quot;Research findings all over the world point universally to
the crucial role the police play in being the first and in many
cases the only point of contact for a victim of family violence.
 At the same time we read about the reluctance of police to act,
to assist and/or to follow through with the protection and advice
desperately needed by the victims who report abuse to the police.&quot;
 The failure of police to provide a proper service to women in
domestic violence situations clearly endangers women's lives.
 A family law solicitor told a Victorian Committee inquiring into
community violence that &quot;if police responded actively to
calls for assistance in situations of domestic violence by laying
criminal charges...some homicides may be prevented&quot;.2
<P>
Female victim/survivors of domestic violence are
clearly unhappy with the police service they receive and report
deep disappointment and frustration at police inaction.
<P>
Recent research indicates that one of the reasons
women do not seek police assistance in domestic violence situations
is that the overwhelming majority of police are male.  Women who
participated in this research found the CPS, which is made up
mainly of women, to be more responsive to their needs. 
<P>
<I><B>Rape</B></I>
<P>
Like victims of domestic violence female victims/survivors
of rape cannot depend on police assistance or sympathy.  It is
well known that the police treat with suspicion women's reports
of rape. One study of rapes reported to Victoria police found
that 34.5% of reports were not proceeded with due to police assessments
that there was insufficient evidence or a false report had been
made.  The now disbanded Victorian Police Complaints Authority
undertook a study on police response to victims of sexual assault
after receiving many complaints that police treated victims of
rape as if they were guilty of something themselves.  Their discussion
paper contains a number of case studies which illustrates this
point. The Police Complaints Authority paper comments that &quot;the
attitudes of some members of the police remain sexist, stereotyped
and judgmental, ... unnecessarily distressing and alienating those
female victims who come forward, and discouraging others from
reporting crimes.&quot;
<P>
A recently held Victorian sexual assault phone-in
found that two-thirds of callers had never reported the assault
to police. The report on the phone-in concludes that: &quot;The
reasons callers gave for not reporting these assaults indicate
a significant lack of faith in the legal system, and widespread
cynicism about police responses&quot;.   Many of those who reported
rapes felt that reporting had been `a waste of time' and that
they had been let down by the legal system. Dissatisfaction related
to attitudes and comments expressed by individual police officers,
as well as to more general police procedures and methods of investigation.
 The victims who were dissatisfied found the police to be unsympathetic.
 They said the police asked inappropriate and irrelevant questions
and made them feel disbelieved, uncomfortable, devalued, guilty
or blamed. 
<P>
Victims were more likely to make positive comments
about the police when female officers were involved, and a significant
number of callers made a distinction between their positive experiences
with members of the CPS and more negative ones with members of
the CIB.  They felt there was greater sympathy and support offered
by members of the CPS in contrast to the CIB. The CPS has about
85% female membership while the CIB is predominantly male.
<P>
<I><B>Women in police custody</B></I>
<P>
One in four people arrested by the police are female.
 Apart from the general psychological and physical abuse which
sometimes takes place in police custody, women are often subject
to abuse of a sexual nature.  The very fact that the overwhelming
majority of police officers are male puts women in a vulnerable
position when they enter police custody.  
<P>
A survey done by the Federation of Community Legal
Centres on police mistreatment of young people included a number
of reports of police sexual assault of women. One woman reported
the following:
<P>
 &quot;A police car pulled up, asked me what I was
doing, and told me to get in the car.  I was taken back to the
police station, through a back door, and told to strip.  I was
questioned whilst I was naked, and police tried to insert an instrument.
They then hit and kicked me.&quot;  
<P>
The Coroner investigating a number of fatal shootings
by police was told by a woman that she witnessed police sexually
assault her friend with a gun and later found another friend deeply
distressed in another room saying that the police had sexually
assaulted him.  The woman gave evidence at the Coroner's Court
that:
<P>
 &quot;... at about 10.45pm when the police sledge
hammered the door down and came running through the place... Doug
ran out the back.  The police went out the back and fired three
shots, and then they came back in laughing and said,  &quot; We
put one in him&quot;.  We were crying.  They said that would not
help.  They punched Diane and  put a long barrelled gun between
her legs... There was a young kid about eighteen,... who was staying
in the front room... They punched him, pulled down his pants and
put a gun up his behind.  He was screaming and crying.  Afterwards
he told us what happened.  He had marks on his neck and all over
him.&quot;  
<P>
Aboriginal women are massively over represented 
amongst women who are arrested.  They are not only subject to
racist abuse but also sexual abuse by police.  The Inquiry Into
Racist Violence heard that Aboriginal women were physically abused
by police, raped and threatened with rape.    Given that sexual
assault is almost exclusively perpetrated by men, women and children
would be far less likely to suffer sexual threats and abuse at
the hands of police if more police officers were female.
<P>
<I><B>Country women</B></I>
<P>
As a result of the low numbers of female police officers
in the country women who are raped or assaulted are less likely
than city women to be able to act on any preference to speak to
a woman about such crimes.  Country women face particular problems
when the perpetrator of the violence against them is a `mate'
of the local police officer or worse still when it is the local
police officer himself. These factors combined with other more
general issues involved in living in small rural communities such
as  isolation, distance, lack of privacy and being economically
dependent on family enterprises, makes it less likely that country
women will report violent crimes against them. Strip searching
of female suspects will more often be carried out by male officers
in the country because of lack of female officers and more female
suspects will be interviewed, detained etc in an all male environment.
     
<P>
<I><B>Pornographic materials in police stations</B></I>
<P>
Community legal centres have received a number of
complaints from people about the display of pornographic posters
in police stations. Display of such materials in police stations
is totally unacceptable and demonstrates that there is little
understanding or concern amongst police that such materials are
likely to distress women who enter police stations.   
<P>
<B><h3>STYLES OF POLICING</h3></B>
<P>
It is the perception of legal centres, based on the
reported experience of their clients, that police officers frequently
engage in violent and unlawful attacks upon members of the public.
It is clear that the most vulnerable members of the community
including aboriginal people and young homeless people are more
likely than others to be subjected to police violence. It is reported
that police officers often respond to any perceived affront to
their authority with physical force. Young people, in particular,
report that if they attempt to assert their rights in dealings
with the police they are often physically assaulted or threatened
with physical assault.
<P>
It appears that some police provoke confrontations
between citizens and themselves by approaching their duties in
an overly aggressive and hostile manner.  It is our view that
many young people at eighteen and a half (the minimum age for
recruitment) are too immature to properly undertake the responsibilities
and powers that go with the provision of police uniform and weapons,
including guns.  It is our perception that this is particularly
true of young men who too often bring to the job the desire to
test their manhood through physical confrontation with others.
 The fact that the police force is overwhelmingly male contributes
to a culture within the police force whereby physical strength
and confrontation is glorified and other perspectives which include
alternative methods of conflict resolution are undervalued or
dismissed.
<P>
<B><h3>CONCLUSION</h3></B>
<P>
The emphasis on brute force in recruiting defines
the policing ethos as one of physical confrontation rather than
service to the community.  
<P>
The former Minister for Police, Mal Sandon, publicly
stated that the community are the police and the police are the
community.  This is clearly not the case.  Over half of the community
are female whilst only 14.4% of the police force is female.  If
we are to have a police force that is more truly representative
of the community then it is imperative that the number of women
as a proportion of the police force increase.  
<P>
Such an increase will only occur if there is a removal
of discrimination in recruitment combined with affirmative action
both in recruitment and in promotion.
<P>
A commitment to affirmative action requires the recognition
that the current male domination of the police force is to a large
part responsible for a culture of violence within the force and
the inadequate response to female victims of crime.
<P>
An increase in the number of women in the force should
be accompanied by a fundamental change in the nature of policing
away from confrontation and brute force and towards a more conciliatory
style of policing.
<P>
If the police are genuine in their commitment to
community policing they must ensure that the force is more representative
of the community and capable of giving appropriate service to
all of the community, including women.
