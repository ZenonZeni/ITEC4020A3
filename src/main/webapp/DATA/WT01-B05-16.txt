GREENFIELD, Mass.-June 15-The Northeast Sustainable Energy Association 
(NESEA) has
received national recognition for its role in public education. The award

Organization (NERO). NERO, based in the nation's capital, provides
opportunities for government leaders, U.S. industry and others to work
together on the development and use of energy. Each year, the 
organization
presents awards for public education and conservation efforts related to
energy use.<P>

        NESEA was honored specifically for its role in organizing the 
annual
American Tour de Sol electric and solar electric vehicle championship. 
NERO
cited the event's ability to reach "more than 125 million people via TV,
radio, news media articles and exhibits." NESEA was also cited for its
efforts which have involved "thousands of students ... in projects that
combine transportation, energy and environmental issues."<P>

        Past award recipients have included Amory Lovins, well-known 
author and
founder of the prestigious Rocky Mountain institute; the National 
Geographic
Society; the United States Agency for International Development; and the

Department of Energy.<P>

        "We're very pleased to be recognized for our work in public 
education," said
Nancy Hazard after accepting the award from master of ceremonies 
Congressman
Ralph Hall, D-Texas. "Public education has been the prime motivation for
NESEA in developing programs and events over the past twenty years. NESEA

believes that providing information to decision makers and the general 
public
is the key to effecting change on energy and environmental issues."<P>

        The Northeast Sustainable Energy Association (NESEA) is the 
nation's 
leading
regional association involved in promoting awareness, understanding and
development of non-polluting, renewable energy technologies.
