<I>The Weekly Money Report (continued)<BR>
February 29, 1996</I>

<P>

When President Clinton attacked the Republican Congress for rejecting his plans to nominate Felix Rohatyn as vice chairman of the Fed, he said that he wanted to encourage a debate about whether the U.S. economy can sustain a higher growth rate. The persistence of low inflation will undoubtedly encourage such a debate at some point but as of today the American forecasting community continues to perceive that the economy's potential growth rate is only about 2.0-2.5%. If the economy's growth rate dips below that range, they believe that the Fed will ease further in order to hold unemployment close to its current level of 5.7%. If, by contrast, the economy suddenly rebounds to a 3.0-4.0% growth rate and the unemployment rate drops below 5.5%, they expect that the Fed will tighten.
<P>

In his recent Humphrey-Hawkins testimony, Fed chairman Alan Greenspan addressed the issue of the economy's potential growth rate. He admitted that recent breakthroughs in technology should increase the economy's optimal growth rate but he was reluctant to offer any higher estimates of the economy's optimal growth rate. He said,
<P>

 <I>"In light of the quickened pace of technological change, the question arises whether the U.S. economy can expand more rapidly on an ongoing basis than the 2 to 2 1/4 percent range for measured GDP forecaster for 1996 by government agencies and most private forecasters without adding to inflationary pressures, which in turn would undermine growth. The Federal Reserve would certainly welcome faster growth-provided that it is sustainable."
<P>

 "The particular rate of maximum sustainable growth in an economy as complex and ever-changing as ours is difficult to pin down. Fortunately, the Federal Reserve does not need to have a firm judgment on such an estimate, for persistent deviations of actual growth from that of capacity potential will soon send signals that a policy adjustment is needed. Should the nation's true growth potential exceed actual growth, for example, the disparity and lessened strain would be signaled in shorter lead times on the delivery of materials, declining overtime, and ebbing inflationary pressures. Conversely, actual growth in excess of the economy's true potential would soon result in tightened markets and other distortions which ,as history amply demonstrates, would propel the economy into recession. Consequently, we must be cautious in reaching conclusions that growth in productivity and hence of potential output has as yet risen to match the evident step-up in technological advance."
<P>

 "The hypothesis that advancing technology has enhanced productivity growth would be more persuasive if national data on productivity increases showed a district improvement. To a degree, the lack of any marked pick-up may be a shortcoming of the statistics rather than a refutation of the hypothesis. Faulty data could be arising in part because business purchases are increasingly concentrated in items that are expensed but which market prices suggest should be capitalized. Growing disparities between book capital and its valuation in equity markets may in part reflect widening effects of this misclassification. If this problem is indeed growing, we may be underestimating the growth of our GDP and productivity."
<P>

"While the Federal Reserve does not need to establish targets - and definitely not limits - for long-term growth, it is helpful in coming to shorter-run policy insights to have some judgments about the growth in potential GDP in the past and what it is likely to be in the future. Judgments of potential, quite naturally, are based on experience. Through the four quarters of 1994, for example, real GDP, pressed by strong demand, rose 3 1/2 percent. If that were the true rate of increase in the economy's long-run potential, then we would have expected no change in rates of resource utilization. Instead, industrial capacity utilization rose nearly 3 percentage points and the unemployment rate dropped a percentage point. Moreover, we began to see signs of strains on facilities; deliveries of materials slowed appreciably and factory overtime rose sharply. These signs of developing pressures on capacity suggest that the growth rate in economic potential in 1994 was below 3 1/2 percent. In general, as we get close to presumed potential, we are required to step up our surveillance for inflation pressures."</I>
<P>

While Greenspan was unwilling to offer any bold new estimate of optimal GDP growth, there should be little doubt that he will reduce interest rates further if the U.S. economy's growth rate appears likely to remain in a range of 1.0-2.0% or less. The sharp drop in the price component of the purchasing agent survey indicates that there is little cost pressure in the industrial sector. It is true that average hourly earnings have recently began to move higher but this development reflects changes in the composition of new job creation, not wage cost-push. Employment in the highest paid managerial and professional workers group has increased by 4% during the past year while employment has fallen elsewhere. As the managerial group has a wage level about 60% above other groups, its growing share of the workforce is boosting the overall level of compensation. In the fourth quarter, there also was an uptick in the employment cost index to a 0.9% rate of change compared to 0.6% previously, but most of this gain occurred in the benefit component while wage growth remained steady.
<P>

As the unemployment rate is below 6.0%, any further Fed easing will continue to be cautious but the excellent performance of cyclical inflation measures such as the purchasing agent index will cause policy makers to retain a bias towards promoting growth. <B>The geographic composition of the economy's current weakness also will give the Fed a bias towards ease because of how the votes of Federal Reserve district presidents are allocated on a regional bias.</B> The current boundaries of the Federal Reserve district banks were established in 1914 and designed to permit commercial bankers to reach their Federal Reserve regional bank for ready cash after a train ride of less than twenty four hours. As a result the boundaries of the Fed's regional banks no longer correlate well with the current distribution of economic activity and population in the U.S. Because geographic boundaries of the Federal Reserve's twelve districts were created in 1914, the east coast is over represented on the FOMC compared to the west (see Table 25). The San Francisco district accounts for 18% of national employment but is still allowed to cast a lone vote only once every three years. The Cleveland district accounts for 6.3% of total employment and is allowed to rotate with Chicago (15.1% of national employment) in voting every two years. There are also independent Federal Reserve districts with only 4.0-5.0% of national employment in Philadelphia and Boston while the Minneapolis Federal Reserve Bank has the same voting power as San Francisco despite the fact that its district accounts for only 3.3% of national employment. At present, the west coast is experiencing a steady but belated upturn in business activity while Cleveland and Philadelphia have slowed after buoyant growth two years ago. Regional district presidents do not vote solely on the basis of their local economies but their perceptions of the business outlook are influenced in part by what is happening in their district. The over-representation of the eastern and central states at the expense of the western states during recent years probably encouraged monetary policy to be too restrictive during the early 1990's (when California was in a severe recession) but may now have the reverse effect because the eastern and central states are suddenly experiencing more weakness than the west.
