<H2>At NREL, the Research Goes On</H2>
<P>
Research happens on a daily basis at the National Renewable Energy
Laboratory (NREL). Research that interacts with and supports the
work of NREL's subcontractors (such as Battelle Columbus Laboratory)
is of particular relevance to the success of projects such as
the gasifier scale-up at the McNeil Generating Station. NREL has
played an important role by working with Battelle to develop the
catalyst (DN-34) that will be used for biogas conditioning at
the McNeil site.
<P>
When biomass is gasified, the resulting gas contains trace amounts
of tar (which is a collective term for generally high molecular
weight hydrocarbons). Steve Gebhard, NREL chemical engineer, explains
the problems that can result: "Many of the chemical compounds
that make up the tar are not very volatile, so even small amounts
of tar will eventually "plate out" on downstream equipment, gradually
fouling it in the process. If you've got tar in a gas that's running
down a pipe, for example, it will end up coating cooler sections
of the pipe," says Gebhard. "Even worse, you can imagine
what would happen if you put that tar in a gas turbine, which
has internal workings much like those in a jet engine--a lot of
damage could be done to a very expensive piece of equipment."
<P>
Gebhard describes the work leading to the development of the tar-cracking
catalyst DN-34 as a complementary effort by Battelle and NREL.
"We would do catalyst development work, catalyst characterization...
We would see certain behavior out there [in Ohio], and would come
back here in the lab and do experiments on a small scale and figure
out what was going on in terms of the chemistry."
<P>
This practical approach makes sense--it costs much more to run
Battelle's pilot-scale plant than NREL's lab-scale equipment.
It also adds flexibility to the process, says Gebhard. "Testing
only 10 to 20 grams of catalyst at a time allows us to try new
ideas--like doubling up catalysts, changing temperatures, adjusting
how much steam is used, raising or lowering the flow rate of gas
over the catalyst. We can also try experimental designs to see
if potential catalysts or processes look promising before Battelle
tests them." 
<P>
This pairing of the two laboratories has proven its worth with
this development of a valuable new catalyst. "In one pass
over the catalyst bed, the majority of the chemical compounds
that make up the tar are reduced in concentration by better than
80%," says Gebhard. "And the good news is that the DN-34
catalyst doesn't deactivate nor does it simply trap the tar--it
chemically converts it into additional fuel gas for the turbine."
<P>
The research process was markedly enhanced by the use of a new
analytical tool developed by NREL--the transportable molecular
beam mass spectrometer, or TMBMS for short. Its compact size and
transportability are major assets--assets that allowed this $300,000
instrument to be used on site at the Battelle laboratory, helping
to ascertain just how well the DN-34 catalyst was performing.
Gebhard offers a simplified explanation of how the TMBMS works:
"It separates the molecules in the gases and vapors in the
biogas according to weight, which, because each molecule has a
unique molecular weight, allows us to determine the chemical compounds
that are present in the gas."
<P>
The TMBMS can directly sample biogas coming straight out of the
gasifier or out of the DN-34 catalyst reactor. Biogas in both
cases is very hot (up to 1500 F), which makes the use of other
sampling methods difficult. The TMBMS operates in real time, taking
"snapshots" of biogas composition as fast as once per
second. These capabilities allowed the NREL researchers to take
data fast enough to see any fluctuations in the flow and get a
full chemical analysis at the same time.
<P>
"When we looked at the raw gas, we saw a lot of different
chemical compounds in the tar--when we looked at the gas after
one pass over DN-34, we saw that a large number of these could
no longer be detected," says Gebhard. "The decrease
was quite dramatic, and told us that gas conditioning with DN-34
was lowering the concentrations of some tar compounds down into
the low parts-per-million range."
