From:      R. Dean Wright, Department of Sociology

Subject:   Your invitation

Date:      July 17, 1995


Dear Carl,

Thank you for your letter of July 1, 1995, inviting me to become an active
member of Iowans for Medical Marijuana. I fully support your effort, but I
have over-committed myself and am in danger of not doing several things
that I have promised as well as I want. At the current time I cannot be an
active member of your Board, but would like to assist you in more focused
(time - centered) rather than general ways. Please do not consider this a
rejection of your efforts, but only a postponement of my efforts.

Thank you for thinking of me. I hope to be able to work with you on
specific projects.


Sincerely,


R. Dean Wright, Ph.D.
Professor
