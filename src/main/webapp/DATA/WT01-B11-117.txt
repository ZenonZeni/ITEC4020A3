<B>MNR Introduces Red Tape Changes
</B>
</CENTER><P>
Natural Resources Minister Chris Hodgson today proposed changes to reduce Red Tape that will protect more than $11 million annually for forest renewal and improve a number of planning regulations.<P>

"MNR's proposed red tape changes will ensure that $11 million in forest renewal money continues to be dedicated to our forests," said 
Mr. Hodgson.  "Another key red tape change will improve MNR's planning on Crown land.  We will maintain our ability to manage natural resources sustainably."<P>

MNR will protect forest renewal funds by amending the Crown Forest Sustainability Act to clarify that funds dedicated by the forest industry to the provincial Forest Renewal Trust fund are Crown assets for forest renewal.  This amendment avoids the risk of these funds being subject to federal taxation.  All the money in the renewal trust fund will be available for forest renewal.  This is consistent with the original intent of the Crown Forest Sustainability Act.<P>

"MNR's Red Tape changes will affect 17 pieces of legislation and eliminate unnecessary regulations.  The changes are part of the government's commitment to reduce the costs of government while improving public services," Mr. Hodgson said.<P>

Changes to the Public Lands Act will improve MNR's land-use planning process for Crown land.  MNR will set clear rules for appropriate, environmentally sensitive development and give industries working on Crown land more certainty about making business decisions.<P>

Changes to Ontario Parks legislation will increase the maximum fine for damaging park natural and cultural heritage and other offences to $25,000, from $5,000.  Changes will also allow MNR to enforce clean-up and repair orders.<P>

Lakes and Rivers Improvement Act changes emphasize public safety, increase the level of fines, streamline the approval process for construction and repair of dams, and add the ability to issue a 
stop-work order consistent with protecting public health and safety.<P>

MNR will streamline forestry legislation by reducing 11 Acts to five and by repealing outdated legislation.  Key elements of five Acts will be consolidated into a proposed new Forestry Act that will cover MNR's commitment to assisting forestry on private land.  To help protect valuable private forests, fines are being increased for improper cutting of trees.<P>

Changes to the Forest Fires Prevention Act remove red tape from declaring Restricted Fire Zones during serious periods of forest fires.  Restricted Fire Zones are a tool MNR uses to help protect public safety during forest fire emergencies.<P>

MNR proposes changes to the Conservation Authorities (CA) Act to follow up on the province's earlier introduction of changes that clearly identify flood control and the protection of provincially significant conservation lands as the provincial interest in CA matters.  Participating municipalities will determine the other work of CAs.   New changes to the CA Act remove the province from unnecessary intrusion into local decision-making.<P>

Changes in surveying legislation will transfer the responsibility for developing standards for monumentation to the Association of Ontario Land Surveyors, whose members have the expertise and experience to administer the activity.  Changes to the Mining Act will allow for the consolidation of three regulations covering the disposition of 
Crown-owned oil and gas into one regulation.<P>

MNR will post all its proposed Red Tape amendments on the Environmental Bill of Rights (EBR) registry for 45 days for public review and comment.  The names of people to contact are included with each posted amendment.  MNR will consider comments it receives before finalizing proposed amendments.<P>
