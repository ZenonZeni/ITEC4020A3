<p><b>Indian Hemp Drugs Commission Report</b> </p>

<p><b>NOTE BY MR. G. A. GRIERSON, C.I.E., MAGISTRATE AND
COLLECTOR, HOWRAH, ON REFERENCES TO THE HEMP PLANT OCCURRING IN
SANSKRIT AND HINDI LITERATURE</b></p>

<hr>

<p>I have the honour to state that I have searched through all
the Sanskrit and Hindi books accessible to me, and to forward the
accompanying note on the references to the hemp plant occurring
in the literatures of those languages.<br>
</p>

<p>I have met the hemp plant in Sanskrit and Hindi literature
under various names. The principal are:<br>
</p>

<p>(1) Bhanga. </p>

<p>(2) Indracana. </p>

<p>(3) Vijaya or Jaya<br>
</p>

<p>The earliest mention of the word ganja which I have noted is
dated about the year 1300 A.D.<br>
</p>

<p>Whenever the word vijaya is used, it is doubtful whether the
hemp plant is meant, or the yellow myrobolan, as the words means
both. <br>
</p>

<p>The name Bhanga occurs in the Atharvaveda (say, B.C. 1400).
The hemp plant is there mentioned simply as a sacred grass.
Panini (say, B.C. 300) mentions the pollen of the hemp flower
(bhanga). In the commencement of the sixth century we find the
first mention of vijaya which I have noted. It is a sacred grass,
and probably means here the hemp plant.<br>
</p>

<p>The first mention of bhanga as a medicine which I have noted
is in the work of Sucruta (before the eighth century A.D.), where
it is called an antiphlegmatic. During the next four centuries
bhanga (feminine) frequently occurs in native Sanskrit
dictionaries in the sense of hemp-plant.<br>
</p>

<p>In the tenth century the intoxicating nature of bhang seems to
have been known: and the name <i>Indracana</i>, Indra's food,
first appears, so far as I know, in literature. Its intoxicating
power was certainly known in the beginning of the fourteenth
century. In a play written in the beginning of the sixteenth
century, it is mentioned as being consumed by jogis (Caiva
mendicants). It is there named &quot;Indra's food.&quot;<br>
</p>

<p>In later medical works it is frequently mentioned under
various names.<br>
</p>

<p>I append a more detailed account of the passages in which I
have noted the uses of the Indian hemp.<br>
</p>

<p>I may add that I have not traced in literature any difference
between the uses of the word ganja and the word bhanga, though
modern <i>kavirajas</i> tells me that they are distinct plants. <br>
</p>

<p>Cir. B.C. 1400. In the <i>Atharvaveda</i> (cir. 1400 B.C.) the
bhang plant is mentioned (11, 6, 15) once:<br>
</p>

<p>&quot;We tell of the five kingdoms of herbs headed by Soma;
may it and <i>kuca</i> grass, and <i>bhanga</i> and barley, and
the herb <i>saha</i> release us from anxiety.&quot;<br>
</p>

<p>Here reference is evidently made to the offering of these
herbs in oblations.<br>
</p>

<p>The grammarian Panini (5, 2, 29) mentions <i>bhangukata</i>,
the pollen of the hemp flower, as one of his examples.<br>
</p>

<p>Cir. B. C. 300.<br>
</p>

<p>The fact that the pollen of this special flower was quoted is
worth noting.<br>
</p>

<p>Varahamihira in his <i>Brihatsamhita</i> (XLVIII, 39),
mentions <i>vijaya</i> as used with other grasses in the rotes of
the <i>Pusya</i>, bathing festival.<br>
</p>

<p>A.D. 504.<br>
</p>

<p><i>Vijaya</i> is this passage certainly means some plant or
other. The word may mean either the Indian hemp-plant or be a
synonym of <i>haritaki</i> (the yellow myrobolan). Dr. Hoernle
informs me that in the oldest medical words the word is explained
by commentators in the latter sense. It is doubtful what meaning
we are to adopt here. The word <i>may</i> mean the hemp-plant <i>bhanga</i>.
In the passage from the Atharvaveda, already quoted, amongst the
five plants special honoured as oblations, <i>bhanga</i> is
closely connected with the herb <i>saha</i>. So also in the
Brihatsamhita, <i>vijaya</i> is mentioned as one of a long list
of plants to be used in the offering, and the very next plant
mentioned is <i>saha</i>, which is apparently the same as <i>saha</i>.
This would encourage the theory that the <i>vijaya</i> of the
Brihatsamhita was more probably the same as the <i>bhanga</i> of
the Atbarvaveda. <br>
</p>

<p>In Sucruta (Ut. XI, 3) <i>Bhanga</i> is recommended together
with a number of other drugs as an antiphlegmatic.<br>
</p>

<p>Before the eighth century.<br>
</p>

<p><i>Vijaya</i> is mentioned in the same work as a remedy for
catarrh accompanied by diarrhea (Ut. XXIV, 20, and Ut. 39, page
415, 20), as an ingredient in a prescription for fever arising
from an excess of bile and phlegm. In these two passages,
however, <i>vijaya</i> is probably an equivalent of <i>haritaki</i>,
the yellow myrobolan, and does not mean hemp.<br>
</p>

<p>In the various <i>kosas</i>, or dictionaries, <i>bhanga</i> is
frequently mentioned as meaning the hemp-plant. Thus,<br>
</p>

<p>(1) <i>Amarakosa</i>, 2, 9, 20.<br>
</p>

<p>Cir. A. D. 500. (2) <i>Trikandacesa</i>, 3, 364.<br>
</p>

<p>Tenth or eleventh century(3) <i>Hemacandra's Anekarthakosa</i>,
2, 37.<br>
</p>

<p>Twelfth century. (4) <i>Hemakandra's Abhidhanacinlamani</i>,
1179. <br>
</p>

<p>The <i>Sarasundari</i> (date not known to me), a commentary on
the Amarakosa mentioned above, </p>

<p>Twelfth century by Mathureca, and quoted in the
Cabdakalpadruma, mentions that the seed of the <i>bhanga</i>
plant is the size of that of millet (<i>kalaya</i>).<br>
</p>

<p>Cakrapanidatta is said to have flourished under Nayapala, a
prince who reigned </p>

<p>Cir. 1050 A.D. in the eleventh century A.D. In his <i>Cabdacandrika</i>,
a medical vocabulary, he gives the following Sanskrit names for
bhang:<br>
</p>

<p>(1) <i>Vijaya</i> (victorious), (2) <i>Trailokyavijaya</i>
(victorious in the three worlds), (3) <i>bhanga</i>, (4) <i>Indracana</i>
(Indra's food), (5) <i>Jaya</i> (victorious).<br>
</p>

<p>These names seem to show that its use as an intoxicant was
then known.<br>
</p>

<p>The <i>Rajanighantu</i> of Narahari Pandita adds the following
names to those given by </p>

<p>A.D. 1300. Cakrapanidatta in the <i>Cabdacandrika</i> above
mentioned: <br>
</p>

<p>(6) <i>Virapattra</i> (hero-leaved or the leaf of heroes), </p>

<p>(7) <i>Ganja</i>, </p>

<p>(8) <i>Capala</i> (the light-hearted), </p>

<p>(9) <i>Ajaya</i> (the unconquered), </p>

<p>(10) <i>Ananda</i> (the joyful), </p>

<p>(11) <i>Harsini</i> (the rejoicer)<br>
</p>

<p>and adds that the plant possesses the following qualities:<br>
</p>

<p>(1) <i>Katulva</i> (acridity); (2) <i>kasayatra</i>
(astringency); (3) <i>Usnatva</i> (heat); (4) <i>tiktatva</i>
(pungency); (5) <i>vatakaphapahatva</i> (removing wind and
phlegm); (6) <i>samgrahitva</i> (astringency); (7) <i>vakpradatva</i>
(speech-giving); (8)<i>balyatva</i> (strength-giving); (9) <i>medhakaritva</i>
(inspiring of mental power); (10) <i>cresthadipanatva</i> (the
property of a most excellent excitant).<br>
</p>

<p>The <i>Carngadhrasamhita</i>, a medical work by Carngadhara,
the date of which is unknown, </p>

<p>Say A.D. 1500. but which must have been compiled during the
Muhammadan </p>

<p>period of Indian History, specially mentions (1, 4, 19) <i>bhanga</i>
as an excitant (<i>vyavayin</i>). In the same passage it mentions
opium.<br>
</p>

<p>The <i>Dhurtasamagama</i>, or &quot;Rogues' Congress,&quot; is
the name of an amusing if coarsely </p>

<p>A.D. 1550. written farce of about the year 1500 A.D., the
author of </p>

<p>which was one Jyotirica. In the second act two Caiva
mendicants came before an unjust judge, and demand a decision on
a quarrel which they have about a nymph of the bazar. The judge
demands payment of a deposit before he will give any opinion. One
of the litigants says:<br>
</p>

<p>&quot;Here is my ganja bag; let it be accepted as a
deposit.&quot; <br>
</p>

<p>The Judge (<i>taking it pompously, and then smelling it
greedily</i>): &quot;Let me try what it is like (<i>takes a pinch</i>).
Ah! I have just now got by the merest chance some ganja which is
soporific and corrects derangements of the humours, which
produces a healthy appetite, sharpens the wits, and acts as an
aphrodisiac.&quot; <br>
</p>

<p>The word used for ganja in the above is <i>Indracana</i>
(Indra's food).<br>
</p>

<p>The <i>Bhavaprakaca</i>, another medical work written by
Bhavadevamicra (cir. A.D. 1600), has as follows:<br>
</p>

<p>Cir. A. D. 1600.<br>
</p>

<p><i>Bhanga ganja matulani madini vijaya jaya<br>
</i></p>

<p><i>Bhanga kaphahari tikta grahini pacani laghuh<br>
</i></p>

<p><i>Tiksosna pittala moha -mada vag vahni vardhini<br>
</i></p>

<p>&quot;Bhanga is also called <i>ganja, matulani, madini</i>
(the intoxicating), <i>vijaya</i> (the victorious), and <i>jaya</i>
(the victorious). It is antiphlegmatic, pungent, astringent,
digestive, easy of digestion, acid, bile-affecting; and increases
infatuation, intoxication, the power of the voice, and the
digestive faculty.&quot; <br>
</p>

<p>&quot;The <i>Rajavallabha, a materia medica</i>, by
Narayanadasa kaviraja, the date of which I </p>

<p>17th century. do not know, but which is quoted in the <i>Cabdakalpadruma,
and</i> is believed to be ancient, has the following:<br>
</p>

<p><i>Cakra-canam tu tiksno-snam moha-krit kustha-nacanam<br>
</i></p>

<p><i>Bala-medha-gni-krit-clesma -dosa-hari rasayanam<br>
</i></p>

<p><i>Jata mandara-manthanaj jala-nidhau piyusa-rupa pura<br>
</i></p>

<p><i>Trailokye vijaya-prade 'ti vijaya cri-devaraja-priya<br>
</i></p>

<p><i>Lokanam hita-kamyaya ksiti-tale prapta naraih kamada<br>
</i></p>

<p><i>Sarva-&quot; tanka-vinaca-harsa-janani yaih sevita sarvada.
<br>
</i></p>

<p>&quot;Indra's food (i.e. ganja) is acid, produces infatuation,
and destroys leprosy. It creates vital energy, the mental powers,
and internal heat, corrects irregularities of the phlegmatic
humour, and is an elixir vitae. It was originally produced, like
nectar, from the ocean by the churning with Mount Mandara, and
inasmuch as it gives victory in the three worlds, it, the delight
of the king of the gods, is called <i>vijaya</i>, the victorious.
This desire-fulfilling drug was obtained by men on the earth,
through desire for the welfare of all people. To those who
regularly use it it begets joy and destroys every anxiety.&quot;<br>
</p>

<p>The <i>Rasapradhipa</i>, a work, the date of which is unknown
to me, and which is quoted in </p>

<p>? Date. the <i>Cabdakalpadruma</i> mentions <i>jaya</i> as a
remedy for indigestion:<br>
</p>

<p><i>Ksaratrayam sutagandhou pancakolam idam cubham<br>
</i></p>

<p><i>Sarvais tulya jaya bhrista tad-ardha cigruja jata<br>
</i></p>

<p>Natron, saltpetre and borax, mercury and sulphur, and the
prosperous five spices (long pepper, its root, <i>piper chaba</i>,
another pepper, and dry ginger). To these add an equal amount of
parched <i>jaya</i> and half of that amount of horse-radish (<i>moringa</i>)
and <i>jata</i>.<br>
</p>

<p>It is not certain whether <i>jaya</i> here means bhang or <i>Haritaki</i>
(yellow myrobolan). The word has both significations. The latter,
perhaps, suits the formula best.<br>
</p>

<p>In the <i>Rasaratna-samuccaya</i>, a work written in the south
of India, <i>jaya</i> is classified as a semi-poison,<br>
</p>

<p><i>Langoli visamustic ca karaviro jaya tatha<br>
</i></p>

<p>? Date<br>
</p>

<p><i>Tilakah kanako rkac ca vargo hy upavisatmakah.<br>
</i></p>

<p><i>Langali</i> (Vanguiera spinosa), the root of the Nerium
odorum, <i>jaya</i> (Symplocos racemosa) <i>kanaka</i> and <i>ak</i>
(a kind of Euphorbia), are semi-poisonous.<br>
</p>

<p>Bhang is frequently mentioned by vernacular poets. The oldest
instance with which I </p>

<p>1400 A.D. am acquainted is the well-known hymn by Vidyapati </p>

<p>Tbakur (1400 A.D.), in which he calls Civa &quot;<i>Digambara
bhanga</i>,&quot; in reference to his habit of consuming that
drug. According to an old Hindu poem, on which I cannot now lay
my hands, Civa himself brought down the bhang plant from the
Himalayas and gave it to mankind. Jogis are well-known consumers
of bhang and ganja, and they are worshippers of Civa.<br>
</p>

<p>In folk-songs, ganja or bhang (with or without opium) is the
invariable drink of heroes before performing any great feat. At
the village of Bauri in Gaya there is a huge hollow stone, which
is said to be the bowl in which the famous hero Lorik mixed his
ganja. Lorik was a very valiant general, and is the hero of
numerous folk-songs. The epic poem of Alha and Rudal, or
uncertain date, but undoubtedly based on very old materials (the
heroes lived in the twelfth century A.D.), contains numerous
references to ganja as a drink of warriors. For instance, the
commencement of the canto dealing with Alha's marriage, describes
the pestle and mortar with which the ganja was prepared, the
amount of the intoxicating drink prepared from it (it is called <i>sabzi</i>)
and the amount of opium (an absurdly exaggerated quantity) given
to each warrior in his court.<br>
</p>

<p>That the consumption of bhang is not considered disreputable
among Rajputs may be gathered from the fact that Ajabes, who was
court poet to the well-known Maharaja Bishwanath Singh of Riwa,
wrote a poem praising bhang and comparing <i>siddhi</i> to the
&quot;success&quot; which attends the worshipper of
&quot;Hari.&quot; Here there is an elaborate series of puns. The
word <i>siddhi</i> means literally 'success,' and <i>hari</i>
means not only the god Hari, but also bhang. </p>

<p>NOTE BY BABU ABHILAS CHANDRA MUKERJI, SECOND INSPECTOR OF
EXCISE, BENGAL, ON THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF TRINATH WORSHIP IN
EASTERN BENGAL.<br>
</p>

<p><i>Date of origin</i>._In 1867 Babu Ananda Chandra Kali or
Kailai, of Dhamrai, a village in thana Sabhar of the Dacca
district, first started the worship at the house of his
father-in-law at Fattehpur in the Atia pargana of the Mymensingh
district (sub-division Tangail). <br>
</p>

<p><i>Antecedents of the originator</i>._Dhamrai is an important
village in the Dacca district noted for its car festival, which
is annually held in honor of a local idol named <i>Madhab Thakur</i>,
and which is witnessed by a large gathering of people.<br>
</p>

<p>Ananda Chandra received education at the Dacca Normal School.
After leaving school he served for some time as a pundit
(schoolmaster), and then entered the Police Department, but was
there only a short time. He is a Barendra Brahman and belongs to
a respectable family. He learnt to smoke ganja when he was only a
boy. His present age is 60 years. He has the reputation of being
a versifier. He smokes two pice worth of ganja every day.<br>
</p>

<p>He married at Fattehpur in the Mymensingh district. There he
introduced Trinath worship 27 years ago. A <i>panchali</i> (poem)
reciting the praises and exploits of Trinath was first published
at Dacca in 1871 and the first edition (1,000 copies) was sold in
a few months.<br>
</p>

<p><i>The circumstances under which the worship was first started</i>._Ananda
Chandra Kali was at the time living in the house of his
father-in-law. He was thinking of introducing the worship of a
common god, who might be worshipped by all classes, rich and
poor, Brahman and Chandal, and by all creeds, Saktas, Baishnavas,
and Shaivas, and the idea occurred to him of having the present
worship at which ordinary and inexpensive things, such as ganja,
oil, and betel-leaf, were alone to be used.<br>
</p>

<p>Trinath (from Sanskrit <i>Tri</i>, three, and <i>Nath</i>,
lord) is represented to be Brahma, Bishnu and Shiva, the Hindu
Trinity in one.<br>
</p>

<p>Being a ganja-smoker himself, Ananda Kali may have also
thought that by introducing the worship he would be able to save
the ganja-smokers from disrepute, as then ganja could be consumed
in the name of a god and under colour of doing a religious or
pious act.<br>
</p>

<p><i>Religious aspect of the worship</i>._The following
translation of the Introduction to the <i>Trinath Mela</i>
Panchali gives some idea of the subject:<br>
</p>

<p>&quot;The universe consists of the earth, the heaven, and the
nether world, and Trinath is the lord of these three worlds.<br>
</p>

<p>&quot;There was an incarnation of God in the form of Gour
(Chaitanya), who delivered the sinners by preaching the name of
Hari, but the Lord was not satisfied with this, and became
concerned for the created, and soon he became incarnate again.
Brahma, Bishnu and Shiva, gods in three forms, manifested
themselves in one form. The one God, the Lord of the universe,
seeing the miseries of mankind, came to their deliverance. Ananda
(Ananda Chandra Kali, the originator) declares that the true and
sincere worshippers of Trinath are sure to obtain salvation.
Brahma, Bishnu, and Shiva met together and expressed their desire
to come to this world in one form to receive worship.<br>
</p>

<p>&quot;He is a truly pious man who worships Trinath, and
blessings are showered on the worshipper.<br>
</p>

<p>&quot;The worship should be made in a form in which the rich
and the poor may equally join and may perform it easily.<br>
</p>

<p>&quot;Only three things, each worth one pice, are required for
this <i>puja</i> (form of worship). The things which please all
must be selected. The offering should consist of <i>siddhi</i>
(ganja), <i>pan</i> (betel-leaf), and oil, each worth one pice. <br>
</p>

<p>&quot;The votaries should assemble at night and worship with
flowers. The ganja should be washed in the manner in which people
wash ganja for smoking. The worshipper must fill three <i>chillums</i>
with equal quantities of ganja, observing due awe and reverence.
When all the worshipers are assembled the lamp should be lit with
three wicks, and the praises of Trinath should be sung. As long
as the wicks burn, the god should be worshipped and his praises
chanted. The god should be reverentially bowed to at the close of
the puja. When the reading of the <i>Panchali</i> is finished,
those that will not show respect to the <i>Prasad</i> (the
offering which has been accepted by the god), <i>i.e. chillum</i>
of ganja, shall be consigned to eternal hell, and the sincere
worshippers shall go to heaven.&quot;<br>
</p>

<p><i>How the worship spread</i>._Ananda Kali commenced the puja
with the aid of some ganja-smokers in the village of Fattehpur. A
large number of people consume ganja in the Dacca. </p>

<p>NOTE BY MR. J.M. CAMPBELL, C.I.E., COLLECTOR OF LAND REVENUE
AND CUSTOMS AND OPIUM, BOMBAY, ON THE RELIGION OF HEMP<br>
</p>

<p>To the Hindu the hemp plant is holy. A guardian lives in the
bhang leaf. As the wife of Vishnu, the preserver, lives in the
hysteria-curing <i>tulsi</i>, or Holy Basil, and as Shiva dwells
in the hysteria-curing <i>bel</i>, Ægle marmelos, so the
properties of the bhang plant, its power to suppress the
appetites, its virtue as a febrifuge, and its thought-bracing
qualities show that the bhang leaf is the home of the great Yogi
or brooding aascetics Mahadev.<br>
</p>

<p>So holy a plant should have special rearing. Shiva explains to
his wife, Parvati, how, in sowing hemp seed, you should keep
repeating the spell 'Bhangri,' 'Bhangi,' apparently that the
sound of that guardian name may scare the evil tare-sowing
influences. Again, when the seedlings are planted the same holy
name must be repeated, and also at the watering which, for the
space of a year, the young plants must daily receive. When the
flowers appear the flowers and leaves should be stripped from the
plant and kept for a day in warm water. Next day, with one
hundred repetitions of the holy name Bhangri, the leaves and
flowers should be washed in a river and dried in an open shed.
When they are dry some of the leaves should be burnt with due
repeating of the holy name as a <i>jap</i> or muttered charm.
Then, bearing in mind Vagdevata, or the goddess of speech, and
offering a prayer, the dried leaves should be laid in a pure and
sanctified place. Bhang so prepared, especially if prayers are
said over it, will gratify the wishes and desires of its owner.
Taken in the early morning such bhang cleanses the user from sin,
frees him from the punishment of crores of sins, and entitles him
to reap the fruits of a thousand horse-sacrifices. Such
sanctified bhang taken at daybreak or noon destroys disease.
Before the religious user of bhang stand the Ashtadevata or Eight
Guardians with clasped hands ready to obey him and perform his
orders. The wish of him who with pure mind pours bhang with due
reverence over the Ling of Mahadev will be fulfilled.<br>
</p>

<p>Such holiness and such evil-scaring powers must give bhang a
high place among lucky objects. That a day may be fortunate the
careful man should on waking look into liquid bhang. So any
nightmares or evil spirits that may have entered into him during
the ghost-haunted hours of night will flee from him at the sight
of the bhang and free him from their blinding influences during
the day. So too when a journey has to be begun or a fresh duty or
business undertaken it is well to look at bhang. To meet some one
carrying bhang is a sure omen of success. To see in a dream the
leaves, plant, or water of bhang is lucky; it brings the goodness
of wealth into the dreamer's power. To see his parents worship
the bhang-plant and pour bhang over Shiva's Ling will cure the
dreamer of fever. A longing for bhang foretells happiness: to see
bhang drunk increases riches. No good thing can come to the man
who treads under foot the holy bhang leaf.<br>
</p>

<p>So evil-scaring and therefore luck-bringing a plant must play
an important part in the rites required to clear away evil
influences. During the great spirit time of marriage in Bombay
among almost all the higher classes of Gujarat Hindus, of the
Jain as well as of the Brahmanic sects, the supplies sent by the
family of the bride to the bridegroom's party during their seven
days' sojourn includes a supply of bhang. The name of the father
who neglects to send bhang is held in contempt. Again, after the
wedding, when the bridegroom and his friends are entertained at
the house of the bride, richly-spiced bhang is drunk by the
guests. The Gujarat Musalman bride before and after marriage
drinks a preparation of bhang. Among the Pardeshi or North Indian
Hindus of Bombay bhang is given not only at weddings, but the
Pardeshi who fails to give his visitor bhang is despised by his
caste as mean and miserly. Another great spirit time during which
bhang plays an important part is the time of war. Before the
outbreak of a war and during its progress the Ling of Mahadev
should be bathed with bhang. Its power of driving panic
influences from near the god has gained for bhang the name of
Vijaya, the unbeaten. So a drink of bhang drives from the
fighting Hindu the haunting spirits of fear and wariness. So the
beleagured Rajput, when nothing is left but to die, after loosing
his hair that the bhang spirit may have free entrance, drinks the
sacramental bhang and rushing on the enemy completes his <i>juhar</i>
or self-sacrifice. It is this quality of panic-scaring that makes
bhang, the Vijaya or Victorious, specially dear to Mahadev in his
character of Tripur, the slayer of the demon Tripurasur. As Shiva
is fond of <i>bel</i> leaves, as Vishnu is fond of <i>tulsi</i>
leaves, so is Tripuresvar fond of bhang leaves. He who wishes to
obtain his desires must constantly offer bhang to Tripuresvar.<br>
</p>

<p>Bhang the cooler is a febrifuge. Bhang acts on the fever not
directly or physically as an ordinary medicine, but indirectly or
spiritually by soothing the angry influences to whom the heats of
fever are due. According to one account in the Ayurveda, fever is
possession by the hot angry breath of the great gods Brahma,
Vishnu, and shiva. According to another passage in the Ayurveda,
Shankar or Shiva, enraged by a slight from his father-in-law
Daksha, breathed from his nostrils the eight fevers that wither
mankind. If the fever-stricken performs the Viraya abhishek, or
bhang-pouring on the Ling of Shankar, the god is pleased, his
breath cools, and the portion of his breath in the body of the
fever-stricken ceases to inflame. The Kashikhanda Purana tells
how at Benares, a Brahman, sore-smitten with fever, dreamed that
be had poured bhang over the self-sprung Ling and was well. On
waking he went to the Ling, worshipped, poured bhang and
recovered. The fame of this cure brings to Benares sufferers from
fever which no ordinary medicine can cure. The sufferers are laid
in the temple and pour bhang over the Ling whose virtue has
gained it the name Jvareshwar, the Fever-Lord. In Bombay many
people sick of fever vow on recovery to pour bhang over a Ling.
Besides as a cure for fever bhang has many medicinal virtues. It
cools the heated blood, soothes the over-wakeful to sleep, gives
beauty, and secures length of days. It cures dysentery and
sunstroke, clears phlegm, quickens digestion, sharpens appetite,
makes the tongue of the lisper plain, freshens the intellect, and
gives alertness to the body and gaiety to the mind. Such are the
useful and needful ends for which in his goodness the Almighty
made bhang. In this praise of the hemp the Makhzan or great
Greek-Arab work on drugs joins. Ganja in excess causes abscess,
even madness. In moderation bhang is the best of gifts. Bhang is
a cordial, a bile absorber, an appetiser, a prolonger of life.
Bhang quickens fancy, deepens thought, and braces judgment. <br>
</p>

<p>As on other guardian-possessed objects, the cow, the Vedas, or
the leaf of the <i>bel</i> tree, oaths are taken on the bhang
leaf. Even to a truthful witness an oath on the bhang leaf is
dreaded. To one who foreswears himself the bhang oath is death. <br>
</p>

<p>So holy a plant must play a leading part in temple rites.
Shiva on fire with the poison churned from the ocean was cooled
by bhang. At another time enraged with family worries the god
withdrew to the fields. The cool share of a plant soothed him. He
crushed and ate of the leaves, the bhang refreshed him. For these
two benefits bhang is Shankarpriya, the beloved of Mahadev. So
the right user of bhang or of ganja, before beginning to drink or
to smoke, offers the drug to Mahadev saying, lena Shankar, lena
Babulnath: be pleased to take it Shankar, take it Babulnath.
According to the Shiva Purana, from the dark fourteenth of Magh
(January-February) to the light fourteenth of Asbadh (July-July),
that is, during the three months of the hot weather, bhang should
be daily poured over the Ling of Shiva. If not every day, bhang
should be poured at least during the first and last days of this
period. According to the Meru Tantra on any Monday, especially on
Shravan (July-August) Mondays, on all twelfths or <i>pradoshs</i>,
and on all dark fourteenths of <i>shivratris</i>, still more on
the Mahashivratri or Shiva's Great Night on the dark fourteenth
of Magh (January-February), and at all eclipses of the sun or
moon, persons wistful either for this world or for the world to
come should offer bhang to Shiva and pour it over the Ling. Not
every devotee of Shiva makes offerings of bhang. Such rites in
Bombay are seldom performed except in the Bhuleswar and Babulnath
temples and there only on special occasions. The bhang offered to
Mahadev is without pepper or other spice. It is mixed with water,
water and milk, or milk and sugar. It is poured over the Ling.
According to some authorities the offerer should not touch the
offered bhang. Temple ministrants Atits, Tapodhans, Bhojaks,
Bhopis, Bharadis, Guravas alone should drink it. If there are no
ministrants the remains of the offering should be poured into a
well or given to cows to drink. Other authorities encourage the
offerer to sip the bhang, since by sipping the bhang reaches and
soothes the Shiva-Shakti or Shiva-spirit in the sipper. On
certain special occasions during failures of rain, during
eclipses, and also in times of war libations of bhang are poured
over the Ling.<br>
</p>

<p>Vaishnavas as well as Shaivas make offerings of bhang. The
form of Vishnu or the Guardian to whom bhang is a welcome
offering is Baladev, Balaram, or Dauji, the elder brother of
Krishna. Baladev was fond of spirits, not of bhang. But Banias,
Bhatias, and other high class Hindus, not being able to offer
spirits, instead of spirits present bhang. In Bombay the offering
of bhang to Baladev, unlike the special offerings to Shiva, is a
common and every-day rite. Without an offering of bhang no
worship of Baladev is complete. Unlike the plain or milk and
sugared bhang spilt over the Ling, Baladev's bhang is a
richly-spiced liquid which all present, including the offerer,
join in drinking. Such social and religious drinking of bhang is
common in Bombay in the temple of dauji in Kalyan Kirparam lane
near Bhuleshwar. As in the higher class worship of Baladev the
liquor offering has been refined into an offering of bhang so it
is in the worship of Devi, Shiva's early and terrible consort. On
any Tuesday or Friday, the two weeks days sacred to Devi, still
more during the Navratra or Nine Nights in Ashwin or
September-October, those whose caste rules forbid liquor make a
pleasing spiced bhang. And as in the worship of Baladev all
present, worshipper and ministrant alike, join in drinking.
Shitaladevi, the Cooler, the dread goddess of small-pox, whose
nature, like the nature of bhang, is cooling, takes pleasure in
offerings of bhang. During epidemics of small-pox the burning and
fever of the disease are soothed by pouring bhang over the image
of Shitaladevi. So for the feverishness caused by the heats
especially to the old no cure equals the drinking of bhang.
Unlike spirits the tempter to flesh bhang the craver for milk is
pleasing to the Hindu religion. Even according to the straitest
school of the objectors to stimulants, while to a high caste
Hindu the penalty for liquor-drinking is death, no penalty
attached to the use of bhang, and a single day's fast is enough
to cleanse from the coarser spirit of <i>ganja</i>. Even among
those who hold stimulants to be devil-possessed penalty and
disfavour attach to the use of hemp drugs only when they are
taken with no religious object and without observing the due
religious rites.<br>
</p>

<p>At the other extreme of Hindu thought from the foes to
stimulants, to the worshippers of the influences that, raising
man out of himself and above mean individual worries, make him
one with the divine force of nature, it is inevitable that
temperaments should be found to whom the quickening spirit of
bhang is the spirit of freedom and knowledge. In the ecstasy of
bhang the spark of the Eternal in man turns into light the
murkiness of matter or illusion and elf is lost in the central
soul-fire. The Hindu poet of Shiva, the Great Spirit that living
in bhang passes into the drinker, sings of bhang as the clearer
of ignorance, the giver of knowledge. No gem or jewel can touch
in value bhang taken truly and reverently. He who drinks bhang
drinks Shiva. The soul in whom the spirit of bhang finds a home
glides into the ocean of Being freed from the weary round of
matter-blinded self. To the meaner man, still under the glamour
of matter or <i>maya</i>, bhang taken religiously is kindly
thwarting the wiles of his foes and giving the drinker wealth and
promptness of mind.<br>
</p>

<p>In this devotion to bhang, with reverence, not with the
worship, which is due to Allah alone, the North Indian Mussalman
joins hymning the praises of bhang. To the follower of the later
religion of Islam the holy spirit in bhang is not the spirit of
the Almighty. It is the spirit of the great prophet Khizr or
Elijah. That bhang should be sacred to Khizr is natural. Khizr is
the patron saint of water. Still more Khizr means green, the
revered colour of the cooling water of bhang. So the Urdu poet
sings 'When I quaff fresh bhang I liken its colour to the fresh
light down of thy youthful beard.' The prophet Khizr or the Green
prophet cries 'May the drink be pleasing to thee.' Nasir, the
great North Indian Urdu poet of the beginning of the present
century, is loud in the praises of his beloved Sabzi, the Green
one. 'Compared with bhang spirit are naught. Leave all things
thou fool, drink bhang.' From its quickening the imagination
Musalman poets honour bhang with the title <i>Warak al Khiyall</i>,
Fancy's Leaf. And the Makhzan or great Arab-Greek drug book
records many other fond names for the drug. Bhang is the
Joy-giver, the Sky-flier, the Heavenly-guide, the Poor Man's
Heaven, the Soother of Grief.<br>
</p>

<p>Much of the holiness of bhang is due to its virtue of clearing
the head and stimulating the brain to thought. Among ascetics the
sect known as Atits are specially devoted to hemp. No social or
religious gathering of Atits is complete without the use of the
hemp plant smoked in ganja or drink in bhang. To its devotee
bhang is no ordinary plant that became holy from its guardian and
healing qualities. According to one account, when nectar was
produced from the churning of the ocean, something was wanted to
purify the nectar. The deity supplied the want of a
nectar-cleanser by creating bhang. This bhang Mahadev made from
his own body, and so it is called <i>angaj</i> or body-born.
According to another account some nectar dropped to the ground
and from the ground the bhang plant sprang. It was because they
used this child of nectar or of Mahadev in agreement with
religious forms that the seers or Rishis became Siddha or one
with the deity. He who, despite the example of the Rishis, uses
no bhang shall lose his happiness in this life and in the life to
come. In the end he shall be cast into hell. The mere sight of
bhang cleanses from as much sin as a thousand horse-sacrifices or
a thousand pilgrimages. He who scandalises the user of bhang
shall suffer the torments of hell so long as the sun endures. He
who drinks bhang foolishly or for pleasure without religious
rites is as guilty as the sinner of <i>lakhs</i> of sins. He who
drinks wisely and according to rule, be he ever so low, even
though his body is smeared with human ordure and urine, is Shiva.
No god or man is as good as the religious drinker of bhang. The
students of the scriptures at Benares are given bhang before they
sit to study. At Benares, Ujjain, the other holy places yogis,
bairagis and sanyasis take deep draughts of bhang that they may
centre their thoughts on the Eternal. To bring back to reason an
unhinged mind the best and cleanest bhang leaves should be boiled
in milk and turned to clarified butter. Salamisri, saffron, and
sugar should be added and the whole eaten. Besides over the demon
of Madness bhang is Vijaya or victorious over the demons of
hunger and thirst. By the help of bhang ascetics pass days
without food or drink. The supporting power of bhang has brought
many a Hindu family safe through the miseries of famine. To
forbid or even seriously to restrict the use of so holy and
gracious a herb as the hemp would cause widespread suffering and
annoyance and to the large bands of worshipped ascetics
deep-seated anger. It would rob the people of a solace in
discomfort, of a cure in sickness, of a guardian whose gracious
protection saves them from the attacks of evil influences, and
whose mighty power makes the devotee of the Victorious,
overcoming the demons of hunger and thirst, of panic fear, of the
glamour of Maya or matter, and of madness, able to rest to brook
on the Eternal, till the Eternal, possessing him body and soul,
frees him from the haunting of self and receives him into the
ocean of Being. These beliefs the Musalman devotee shares to the
full. Like his Hindu brother the Mussalman fakir reveres bhang as
the lengthener of life, the freer from the bonds of self. Bhang
brings union with the Divine Spirit. 'We drank bhang and the
mystery I am He grew plain. So grand a result, so tiny a sin.'<br>
