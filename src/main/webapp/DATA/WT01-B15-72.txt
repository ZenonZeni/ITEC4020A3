The US Presidential Elections are over, with incumbent President Clinton winning by a substantial margin. The US markets have rocketed in the last couple of days, showing that the World's investors have embraced a Democrat President and a Republican Congress, the first re-elected Republican Congress since 1930. Unfortunately, voter turn out was the lowest in 72 years, speaking volumes for the perceived qualities of the candidates. 55% of polled voters said that they did not consider Mr. Clinton to be "trustworthy."<p>In late July, I directed you to two "market reversal day" signals and commented that the market was oversold and ripe for a multi-month rally. Well, we're here. Now that many more investors now believe that it's a great market, it's time to get cagey, not complacent. Enjoy the rally while we've got it, <i>the trend is your friend</i>, but remember, the honeymoon always ends sometime.<p>My expectations from four months ago were for better performance from biotechnology and Nasdaq high tech stocks. Unfortunately, some Biotech stocks have lagged a bit, but high tech., plus the NYA, S&P 500 and the blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average have done equally well since. The Dow has reached into my target zone of 6200-6400 points mentioned in the September letter, but as said then, it may go higher. I wish that I had the skill to tell you when to bail out. Personally, I'm going to stay with the trend for as long as I dare. US stock market historian Yale Hirsch says that a re-elected President usually spells trouble for the stock market, especially if the markets were very strong before the Presidential Election. Yale says that after re-election the markets have fallen by an average of 11% with the worst drops down to about 20%. exception and had a bull market to support him?
