<A NAME="mosaic"></A>
<H2>Using the Hypertext Interface - NCSA's Mosaic</H2>
<P>NCSA's Mosaic is a World Wide Web client which provides a hypertext
user interface to HyperText Markup Language (HTML) files, as well as
other file types.  Depending on the file type, Mosaic will either
display it appropriately, such as HTML or plain text, or launch an
external viewer such as xv, Adobe Acrobat(TM) Reader, etc.
</P>
<P>Words, phrases, or images which are <A HREF="aboutcd.htm">hot</A>
are hyperlinks and will be underlined, highlighted, or both.   Clicking
on a hyperlink will activate it.  Once it has been activated, it will
display in a different or subdued color, depending on your  Mosaic
client.
</P>
<P>When you choose a paper title from any of the methods listed above,
the abstract will be displayed to you.  From here, you can choose a
hyperlink to view the paper (see the next section) and/or any of its
attached materials. </P>
<P>Within Mosaic, you may search for a string within any currently
displayed document by selecting Find In Current from the File menu.
(Typing an s often gives you access to this capability.)  If you are
presented with a long list of paper titles, you may want to  use this
capability to locate a particular paper.
</P>
<A NAME="adobe"></A>
<H2>Using the Adobe Acrobat(TM) Reader</H2>
<P>If a paper is available in Portable Document Format (PDF), you will
see the following display when viewing its abstract.  </P>
<HR><IMG  WIDTH=303 HEIGHT=126 SRC="vwpaper.gif">
<HR>
<P>Clicking on this hyperlink will launch Adobe Acrobat(TM) Reader.
</P>
<HR><IMG  WIDTH=692 HEIGHT=68 SRC="acroicon.gif">
<HR>
<P>Once in Acrobat, you may use the icons and options  to view the
pages of an individual paper.  You may enlarge or reduce the size of the
page on your screen, using the + and - icons, view thumbnail images of
the pages, move from one page to the next, or print the paper.  (Be sure
to specify that you want the page to "scale to fit.")
</P>
<P>Some PDF files may have embedded hypertext links that will take you
to other pages in that same PDF file.  Click on these links to make the
hypertext jump.  They look like the following.</P>

<A HREF="convhist.htm">conversion history</A>.
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Papers that were converted directly from Postscript files using
Adobe's Distiller may load more slowly, but will display  images better.
</LI>
<LI>Papers that were scanned from hardcopy will lose grayscale and will
only display black and white.  These may also display artifacts from the
scanning process. 
</LI>
<LI>Papers that were submitted as Postscript files but could not be
converted directly using Adobe's Distiller, will lose grayscale and will
only display black and white.
</LI>
</UL>
<P>Exit Adobe Acrobat (TM) from the File menu to return to NCSA Mosaic.</P>
<A NAME="attach"></A>
<H2>Viewing Attachments provided by the Author</H2>
<P>If there is a list of attached materials, you will see the following
type of display.  Note the icons for viewing images and non-image files.</P>
<HR><IMG  WIDTH=268 HEIGHT=200 SRC="attach.gif">
<HR>
<P> If you select an image, you must have an image display program on
your local machine to display them.  NCSA Mosaic will try and launch
certain default image display programs based on your platform.  If you
need to change these defaults to launch the program of your choice, this
can be done by:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Selecting the Options/Helper Applications menu on the Mac
</LI>
<LI>Updating the .mailcap and .mime.types files on Unix platforms
</LI>
<LI>Updating the mosaic.ini file on the PC
</LI>
</UL>
<P>Once an image display program has been launched, you must exit this
program to return to NCSA Mosaic.  Otherwise, you may experience memory
problems (especially Mac users).  In some cases, you must click on the
image to activate the menu of the display program.</P>
