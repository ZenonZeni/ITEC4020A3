<BR>
<P><B>Repair and Calibration</B><BR>
GTS Instrument Services' facility provides reliable, high-quality repair and calibration services for virtually all makes of radiation monitoring, counting, and sampling equipment.  With an extensive parts inventory, the facility's staff has established a solid track record for fast turnaround, keeping its clients' equipment in service and minimizing downtime.  GTS' U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) license allows staff members to perform instrument calibrations, radiological surveys, and sealed radionuclide source leak tests.<BR>

<P><B>Equipment Rental</B><BR>
GTS maintains a large inventory of state-of-the-art equipment for both short-term and long-term rental to those organizations that find rental more cost-effective than buying and maintaining their own instruments.  The GTS rental program enables its clients to ramp up and ramp down their instrument outfitting levels to match their project needs.  And "brand name" equipment enables clients to match specific instruments to their technical specifications and other requirements.  With the full support of repair and calibration services, the GTS rental program also assures that the instruments will be calibrated and operating properly when they are needed.<BR>

<P><B>Rigid Adherence to Quality Standards</B><BR>
GTS instrument technicians rigidly adhere to the facility's quality assurance program, which meets all applicable federal regulations, codes, and standards.  All calibrations are traceable to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).  The GTS staff's attention to detail enables them to repeatedly pass NRC and client QA audits.

<P><B>More Service for Your Money</B><BR>
GTS basic calibration is three points on each range, up to four ranges per instrument.  Additional ranges are calibrated for a nominal charge.  GTS also includes as-found readings on calibration certificates and can tailor calibrations to meet its clients' specific requirements.
