HEALTH INSURANCE - AIDS COVERAGE
EEOC Settlement: Mason Tenders District Council Welfare Fund

EEOC has announced that it has negotiated a $1 million settlement
of its complaint against the Mason Tenders District Council
Welfare Fund, a union-administered health insurance plan.

The Fund's plan, which covered more than 10,000 workers and their
families, specifically excluded health insurance coverage for
illnesses related to AIDS and HIV infections.

EEOC had filed claims contending that the exclusion violated the
Americans With Disabilities Act on behalf of a number of union
members who were denied health insurance coverage for AIDS and
HIV-related medical problems.

Mason Tenders had argued that as a self-administered, self-funded
health insurance plan, it was not subject to ADA. Its claims were
rejected by a federal district court, which held that ADA
applied. Rather than litigate the issue further, Mason Tenders
elected to settle the case with EEOC.

In response to Mason Tenders claim that "it had to limit AIDS
benefits because of losses from huge health care bills," EEOC
said that limitations on benefits are permitted where the
employer demonstrates that there were actuarial reasons for
treating classes of employees differently. Here, however, EEOC
attorney James Lee said that Mason Tenders was "paying for every
other high-priced condition" but was excluding AIDS and HIV-
related medical expenses.

EDITOR'S NOTE: In McGann v H&H Music Company, 946 F2d 401, the
U.S. Supreme Court ruled that an employer's self-insured health
plan that limited benefits paid for AIDS and HIV-related medical
expenses did not violate the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. The
application of ADA to  self-insured health plans has yet to be
considered by the high court.

APPLYING FOR EMPLOYMENT
Kemer v Johnson, USDC SDNY, 93-Civ, 6965

Must an employer assist a mentally ill job applicant in filling
out a job application or be in violation of the Rehabilitation
Act of 1973? Not if the applicant fails to inform the employer of
his or her disability, according to the federal district court
decision in Kemer v Johnson.

The Court decided that Eric N. Kemer, an applicant for
employment with the General Services Administration (GSA), did
not make a prima facie case that he was "otherwise qualified" for
the position because he failed to complete his application form.
The Court held that "filing an application is an essential
prerequisite for any position [with GSA]."

GSA had told Kemer that his application was incomplete. It had
sent him another employment application form, inviting him to
properly complete it and resubmit it to the agency. The Court
said this constituted a reasonable accommodation.

Kemer represented himself as having a "depressive neurosis and a
schizotypical personality disorder." He contended that GSA should
have accommodated his disability by providing him with assistance
in completing the application form.

The Court noted that people with such mental conditions are
entitled to protection under the Rehabilitation Act. But, the
Court said, "employers are only required to make reasonable
accommodation to the known mental and physical limitations of a
qualified applicant." Kemer never notified GSA of his disability.
Also, Kemer offered no evidence that his disability interfered
with his ability to successfully complete the employment
application form.

PARKING FOR DISABLED WORKERS
Lyons v Legal Aid Society, CA2, 95-7030

An employer may be required to provide a disabled employee with a
parking space as a reasonable accommodation or be in violation of
the Americans With Disabilities Act, according to a ruling by the
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeal, Second Circuit [NY].

Legal Aid Society attorney Beth Lyons charged the Society with
violating ADA when it rejected her request for a paid parking
space. Lyons said that she needed a parking space near her office
because her ability to walk had been seriously impaired by a car
accident. Paying for parking, according to Lyons, cost her about
20% of her salary - approximately $400 a month.

Although a federal district court judge dismissed her claim as
being outside the scope of ADA, the Second Circuit Court of
Appeals reinstated it.

The Court said that "an essential aspect of many jobs is the
ability to appear at work regularly and on time." Accordingly,
providing a parking space may constitute a "reasonable
accommodation" required by ADA under certain circumstances.

In the Circuit Court's view, "there is nothing unreasonable [in
terms of legislative intent] in requiring an employer to furnish
an otherwise qualified disabled employee with assistance related
to her ability to get to work."

In response to the Society's argument that parking and other
forms of "commuting assistance" were not provided to other
employees, the Circuit said that "Congress envisioned that
employer assistance with transportation to get the employee to
and from the job might be covered" and EEOC guidelines
specifically mention "reserved parking spaces" as a reasonable
accommodation.

The Circuit Court remanded the matter to the district court with
the observation that "Legal Aid may be able to develop evidence
prior to trial showing that [Lyons'] request is unreasonable."

HEALTH INSURANCE GUIDELINES
Federal Register, 60 FR 60720

The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has announced that it
will publish proposed guidelines concerning the Americans With
Disabilities Act's impact on health insurance. The proposed
guidelines are expected to be issued in September 1996.

EEOC said that the guidelines will "reduce confusion and
uncertainty on the part of insurers, employers and individuals
with disabilities regarding the applicability of the Act to
various health insurance provisions."

ADA IN DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS
Mohamed v Marriott International, DC SDNY, 94 Civ 2336

The Mohamed decision suggests that a deaf person must be provided
with a sign interpreter at all stages of a disciplinary
investigation or proceeding. In addition,  the decision strongly
implies that ADA's reasonable accommodation mandates requires the
employer to provide a sign interpreter at other meetings that a
deaf worker attends, including meetings involving an evaluation
of his or her work performance.

Ahmed Mohamed, a deaf person, performed maintenance work for
Marriott Marquis Hotel's engineering department. A native of
Egypt, Mohamed  communicated in American Sign Language although
he had a limited ability to read and write English.

Mohamed found a coworkers handbag containing $480. Although
Marriott policy required employees who found money to turn it
over to a guard, Mohamed put the money in his locker.

The loss was discovered and Mohamed was immediately interviewed
by three members of Marriott management concerning the money. One
manager had some minimal training in sign language, but it proved
insufficient for the occasion. After more than an hour the
meeting was terminated. Mohamed was advised that a second meeting
at which an sign interpreter would be present would be scheduled.

At the second meeting, at which the interpreter was present,
Mohamed related the same story that he had earlier attempted to
communicate -- he could not find his supervisor and therefore he
placed the money in his locker. Marriott terminated Mohamed
because he failed to follow Marriott's policy of turning money
found in the hotel to a guard.

Mohamed sued, claiming (1) the absence of an interpreter at the
first meeting violated ADA's requirement that employer's provide
disabled workers with a reasonable accommodation and (2)
disparate treatment in that he was terminated because of his
deafness.

Marriott, on the other hand, argued that regardless of any
disability, Mohamed would have been dismissed because he violated
hotel policy.

The Court rejected Marriott's claim that providing an interpreter
at the second meeting met ADA's reasonable accommodation
requirement on the grounds that the lack of an interpreter at the
first meeting "set a tone of mistrust of Mohamed that inalterably
led to his discharge." This, said the Court, warranted a trial to
determine whether providing an interpreter at the second meeting
was sufficient to satisfy ADA's reasonable accommodation
requirements.

According to the ruling, the need for the accommodation arose not
in the course of the termination per se, but "in the course of a
meeting with an employee to review the disappearance of something
of value."

As to ADA's requirement that employer provide workers with a
reasonable accommodation, the Court said that "the fact that the
meeting eventually led to termination makes it no less an element
of Mohamed's job performance than a staff meeting, a performance
evaluation or a salary review," indicating that a sign
interpreter would be required at those meetings as well.

Nevertheless, the Court, dismissed Mohamed's claim based on
disparate treatment, finding that Marriott's decision to fire him
"did not result from his deafness." On this point the decision
states:

Although Mohamed's discharge may have ... resulted from his
deafness, Marriott's decision to discharge him was not motivated
by his deafness. It is true that a hearing person would not have
found himself in the same predicament as Mohamed. It is not true,
however, that Marriott's decision to fire Mohamed was based on
his deafness. In other words, Marriott's firing Mohamed based on
his actions [handling the money] were not a pretext for
discharging him because he was deaf.

MODIFYING JOB DUTIES
Kuehl v Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., DC Colo 95-S-393

Vicke Kuehl was employed as a "greeter" by Sam's Wholesale Club,
a Wal-Mart store. According to Wal-Mart, standing was critical to
serving as a greeter.

Kuehl was diagnosed as having chronic tibula tendinitis. While
she was being treated for the condition Wal-Mart reduced her work
hours and allowed her breaks every two hours. When she returned
to work, Kuehl asked to be allowed to sit on a stool while on
duty as a greeter. Wal-Mart refused to allow Kuehl to use a
stool, but offered her the opportunity to work a split-shift or
working as a cashier.

Kuehl sued, contending that Wal-Mart violated ADA by refusing to
accommodate her request to use a stool while working as a
greeter.

A federal district court judge granted Wal-Mart's motion for
summary judgment. The Court ruled that Kuehl's impairment was not
severe enough to constitute a disability since it limited only
her ability to perform one particular job -- door greeter.

However, even if Kuehl was disabled within the meaning of ADA she
would have lost. The Court said that Wal-Mart had shown that
standing was an essential part of a greeter's job and that it had
reasonably accommodated Kuehl by offering her alternative
employment. Further, the Court said that employers are not
required to modify the actual duties of the job in order to make
an accommodation, citing Daugherty v El Paso, 5 EDR 86.
