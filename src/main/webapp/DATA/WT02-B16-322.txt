<B>Annex 10 -- Photoproduction</B>
<P>
The objective of this International Energy Agency annex is to investigate 
and develop 
processes for producing hydrogen by direct conversion of solar energy.  
These processes have 
the potential to be efficient, economically competitive, and 
environmentally benign.  The annex will address photoconversion processes 
by which solar energy can be stored and transported as chemical energy in 
the form of hydrogen.  The focus is primarily on water splitting, but 
some non-oxygen-evolving systems will also be considered.  Attention will 
be given to the possibility of combined hydrogen production and waste 
treatment.
<P>
Two types of processes will be investigated:  photoelectrochemical 
hydrogen 
production and photobiological hydrogen production.  In addition, efforts 
will focus on the 
standardization of methods for measuring calculating, and reporting 
efficiencies.  Participating countries include Canada, Japan, Norway 
(Operating Agent), Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, and the United States.

<I>Recent Activities:</I>
<P>
An Experts Meeting was held in conjunction with the Autumn Hydrogen 
Technical Advisory Panel Meeting in Honolulu, Hawaii, on September 25-26, 
1995.  
The meeting included a discussion of the status and progress of ongoing 
work 
since the last meeting and discussions in which participants were asked 
to review 
and redefine the task and work plan, including subtask activities, 
objectives, and 
results.  Dr. Bolton's "state-of-the-art" paper on photobiological 
production was 
discussed and reviewed, and the meeting consensus was that it would be 
advantageous to have the paper rewritten without recommendations and 
rankings.  
The meeting also included technical presentations on recent research.
