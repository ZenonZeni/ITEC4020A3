Ocean Optics Inc., was founded in 1989 to develop environmental sensors. OOI won two Small Business Innovation Research grants from the U.S. Department of Energy to develop an instrument to determine the ocean¹s role in global warming. In the process of designing the instrument, OOI researchers developed a breakthrough technology - a miniature fiber - optic spectrometer that is 1000 times smaller and 10 times less expensive than conventional systems.

In April 1992, OOI introduced the S1000, "The World¹s First Miniature Fiber-Optic Spectrometer." Since then, Ocean Optics has sold thousands of spectrometers to customers world-wide and won four major industry awards, including the "Best New Product of the Year" (1992) by Fiber Optic Product News and Photonic Spectra¹s Circle of Excellence Award.<P>

Today Oceans optics is a leading manufacturer of low-cost, miniature fiberoptic spectrometers, probes, light sources and accessories for industrial process control, environmental monitoring, medical, and research applications. The company¹s revolutionary line of UV, VIS and NIR spectrometers includes PC plug-in, benchtop and notebook platforms, available in 12 different diffraction gratings and five standard input fibers for configurement to a wide range of application needs. All Ocean Optic spectrometers can be optimized to measure spectral characteristics such as absorbency, transmission, reflection, irradiance and fluorescence. (2)<P>
