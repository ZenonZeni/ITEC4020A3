<H1><B> American Beer and Wine</B>


</H1><P>


<P><B>The American market for beer and wine is one of the most open in the

world. The U.S. charges a relatively small duty-  13 cents a case- on imported


beer. Other nations charge a great deal more. For example, Holland, Germany

and England charge U.S. companies $2.93 a case to export beer into their


countries. China charges U.S. exporters an extraordinary duty of $14 a case.

For years, our Canadian neighbor refused to allow U.S. beer to be sold in

its provinces. Wine duties are similarly discriminatory against American


products. </B>


<P><B>So every time you order or purchase beer or wine, think about the unfair


treatment U.S. brewers receive overseas and choose American.</B>


<P><B><HR></B>


<H2><B>Great (and Good) American Beers</B>


</H2><P>


<P><B>One of the most exciting developments in the U.S. beer industry has

been the arrival within the past 10 years of several dozen so-called


"micro-breweries," most of which are wholeheartedly devoted to producing

quality beers that can compete with the top offerings from Germany, Holland,


England, Ireland and Belgium. </B>


<P><B>Many of these micro-breweries make their beers under contract with

already existing breweries. Once the brand is established, however, many

of these initially mom-and-pop operations graduate to their own facilities.


Indeed, two of the finest producers, Boston Brewing Co., the producer of

Sam Adams beers, and New Amsterdam Beer started as contract breweries, but

have since opened up their own breweries. </B>


<P><B>Like the rest of the world's beers, American beers can be divided into

two major types. Bottom fermenting beers, which include the familiar pilsener,


ambers and bocks, are made from yeasts that settle to the bottom during


fermentation. Top fermenting beers, which include ales, porters and stouts,

are made from floating yeasts and tend to be fuller and heartier and deeper


colored than bottom fermenters.</B>


<P><B>Though there are vast numbers of American beers worth trying, the following


is my list of standouts, in order of quality. (The type of beer and location

of brewing are indicated in parentheses.)</B>
