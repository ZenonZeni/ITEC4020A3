From: Massimo Antoninetti <P>


I'm a 42 years old geologist, research scientist at the Remote Sensing Dept. 
of the Institute of Research on Seismic Risk, located in Milan, Northern 
Italy. The Institute forms part of the National Research Centre (CNR) of 
Italy in the frame of the Ministry of University and Scientific Research.
The Department has been created in beginning of '70 to study and apply the 
remote sensing techniques on the environment.<P>

My research activities in high mountain are related to the application of 
enhanced and classified satellite data for geo-structural studies, snow and 
ice investigations including the glacial and periglacial phenomena, such as 
the permafrost. I use the fuzzy set theory in a Decision Support System 
knowledge-based to classify the images, I'm also working on the settle-up of 
the GIS of EV-K2-CNR Project. <P>


In the Mountain Forum I would like to represent this project sponsored by 
CNR and located in the Himalayas, I'm working on a EV-K2-CNR Web page at the 
following address: <BR>
http://www.tel-irrs.mi.cnr.it/ <BR>  
This is the home page of my Dept., here you can follow the Ev-K2 project 
address.<P>

Let me, finally, briefly describe the Project.<P>

The EV-K2-CNR Project<P>

The EV-K2-CNR Project born in 1987 as an expedition aimed to the measurement 
of the height of Mount Everest and K2, after the sensational announcement in 
the USA press that K2 was supposed to be higher than Everest. Prof. Ardito 
Desio, the geologist who led the first ascent to K2 in 1954, was the project 
promoter.
These initial operations were the starting point for further checks and 
researches in the geodetic, geophysical and geological fields in the 
Himalayas and Karakorum ranges.
In 1989, two Italian industrial groups offered the project with a "Pyramid" 
of glass and aluminium to host the scientific laboratories with the special 
and delicate equipment necessary to the researches.<P>

Because of a cooperation agreement signed between the Italian National 
Research Centre (CNR) and the Royal Nepal Academy of Science and Technology 
(RONAST), the Pyramid has been installed at 5,050 m of altitude in the 
Sagarmatha (Everest) National Park above the mountain pasture of Lobuche, 
near the Base Camp, starting point to climb Everest.
The "Laboratory of studies and research at high altitude" is a three-storied 
glass and aluminium pyramid, measuring 13 m at the base and 9 m in height.
Due to laboratory's unique position, the power generating system was 
conceived to be highly reliable, easy to install, simple to conceive, and 
environmental friendly: micro-hydraulic unit, photovoltaic panels, and wind 
generator.<P>

During the last years of activity, the Pyramid hosted more than 300 
researchers coming from different countries who produced hundreds papers, 
articles and specialised publications.
More, climbers and backpackers had the possibilities to used the medical 
facilities of the laboratory to cure the mountain sickness, it is also the 
only centre supplied with satellite telephone in this area.
The Pyramid can offer an unique possibilities for researches in different 
fields: Medical, Environmental, Earth Science and Technological studies.
The same researchers are also involved in similar research activities in the 
European Alps, in Antarctica and North Pole.
The Project signed international agreement with: RONAST, Nepal; Himalayan 
Research for Science and Technology NGO, Nepal; Centre for Integrated 
Mountain Research, Pakistan; Tibetan Academy of Social Science, Tibet. <P>

Reconfirming, if necessary, my complete availability to provide any other 
information regarding the project and thanking you for the kind attention, I 
remain.<P>

Dear readers:<P>

Hi! I am Ricardo Ayala and I am a Civil Engineer with specialty in
hydraulics; I am pleased to participate with all of you in this
list.<P>

I have fulfilled the post of Director of Water Basins, from the
Ministry of Sustainable Development and Environment in Bolivia,
since october 1995 until now.<P>

35% of Bolivia's territory is mountain zone (1,100,000 km2) and 65%
of the population (7,000,000 inhab. approx.) lives on this part. As
you well understand, the majority of the people live  in  the
mountain zone, where one can find the city of La Paz and El Alto
(1,800,000 inhab.). This is why I am so interested in being
acquainted with experiences in the management of natural resources
on mountain zones.<P>

Since 1992, in Bolivia we have stared to work with pilot
experiences in water management on mountain zones, which are found
now on an inplementation and evaluation phase. Once I have the
final results from these  experiences, I will be delighted to
share them with you all.<P>

I will be most grateful if anyone can provide me  references from
experiences on water management on similar mountain zones.<P>


Thanks!  <P>

Dear Participants in the Mountain Forum<P>

Please allow me to briefly introduce myself, my name is Lee Porter Butler
and I am a practicing  architect with thirty three (33) years of experience
designing and building sustainable Ekosea homes, all over the world.
Ekose'a is an ancient Greek word defining "the essence of being", family,
food and shelter. The Ekosea homes described in my book reflect that
philosophy.<P>

I would define "sustainable mountain development" and mountain conservation
as building designs which do not require resources or produce pollution.
These are the designs we should all be seeking to develop. Once they are
being manufactured by the same techniques we use to create automobiles,
airplanes and ships, they will be affordable, flexible and permanent.<P>

The new global utility will utilize "technology" or knowledge to take the
place of resources.<P>

I believe a major source of pollution as well as stress, work and the
conversion of fossil resources arises from trying to stay warm in cold
mountainous
climates. What could be more relevant that a simple concept for eliminating
heating energy requirements in areas where there is nothing left to burn.
Is this not the very definition of sustainability, where we live. If these
designs also allowed for the production of the family's food supply, would
it not further raise the standard of living of all people.<P>

The Ekosea home integrates solar, gravity and geothermal energy in a unique
patented design, to bring the interior state of the home into thermal and
environmental equilibrium. <P>

The design is especially easy to adapt to mountain regions.<P>

Please contact me for more information.
With best wishes for the success of the forum,
I am sincerely yours,<P>

<P>

     Hi everyone,<P>
     
     My name is Steve Caicco.  I'm a botanist/plant ecologist 
     interested in mountain biodiversity and conservation.  I did my 
     graduate research on the classification and ordination of high 
     elevation plant communities in the Rocky Mountains of Idaho 
     (USA).  That was over a dozen years ago.  Since then I've worked 
     in many fields mostly related to conservation.  Most recently 
     I've been studying riparian ecosystems.<P>
     
     My present job is with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in 
     Portland, Oregon, where I work in the endangered species arena.  
     Although I currently have no active research in mountainous 
     areas, I retain my interest in mountain environments worldwide.  
     I am particularly interested in the high mountains of tropical 
     Africa and have visited Mt. Kenya twice over the past several 
     years.  Thank you for taking the time to read this.  I look 
     forward to discussing our common interests in the mountain forum.<P>
     
     Sincerely,<P>

My name is Olivier Chave.<P>

I am presently working in Hanoi, Vietnam, as Deputy Resident
Coordinator, Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC).<P>

My previous assignement with SDC was in the field of Multilateral
Cooperation. In this capacity I took part in the entire Rio
(UNCED) process and in its follow-up. It offered me the great
opportunity to cooperate closely with the fantastic constituency
advocating the "Mountain Agenda" (Agenda 21, chapter 13).<P>

My present activities are essentially to develop an extensive SDC
program in Vietnam - which is a new "focus country" for Swiss ODA.
I am especially in charge of the "green sector", with two major
(but not exclusive) components: sustainable land resources
management and
environment monitoring.<P>

Since SDC decided not to work in the two large delta zones (Red
River and Mekong) we are active in the hilly/mountainous regions
of Vietnam - which represent around 75% of the national territory.
Our entry point
was "social forestry" but, given the forestry situation in the
country, we are rapidly reorienting toward a much more
comprehensive and integrated conception of land resources. We also
decided recently to focus on the general question of "training for
extension", at all levels, with a strong emphasis on participatory
approaches.<P>

We are promoting national and regional networking and partnership.
In this context we try e.g. to valorize the activities of regional
Centers such as IBSRAM (International Board for Soil Research and
Management)
and its program "Asialand-Slopingland" - a new partner of ICIMOD
and CIP within CGIAR's Mountain Initiative - or RECOFTC (Regional
Community Forestry Trainig Center) or Asian Institute of
Technology's SERD (School of Environment, Resources and Development).<P>

<A NAME="MCohen">
Date: July 20, 1996<BR>
From: steenbok@iafrica.com<P>

First let me express my gratitude to all who are participating in the
list.  I have found the contributions to be of great interest and
value.<P>

As introduction - I am Mike Cohen from the new Eastern Cape Province,
South Africa. The new province was formed after the first democratic
elections of 1994. Until six weeks ago, I occupied the post of
Director
of Nature conservation in the new province. I have since resigned this
position and opened a consulting business attached to a
Community Based Organization, Community Environment Network,
which was established during the struggle against apartheid. The idea
of the consultancy is to generate funds for the CBO and to provide
training for young scientists and environmentalists from the formally 
disadvantaged community. We are becoming involved in a series
of community based projects ranging from urban agriculture through
environmental impact assessments to assisting the new
provincial government with certain restructuring problems.<P>

My interest in mountains is as follows. many of the mountainous areas
of the Eastern Cape are heavily infested with alien plants, mainly
the alien acacias from Australia that were introduced to South Africa
over the years. These aliens have had a tremendous negative impact
on the water production from the catchments. The hard engineering
option in rectifying the problem is to build more dams. The soft
option
is to involve communities in the clearing of the aliens. A project
has 
commenced here which has established several hundred jobs
for people clearing alien vegetation and at the same time is leading
to a better management of the catchment area. This is especially
important in that we are suffering for a 70 percent unemployment in
parts of the province.<P>

A further problem that we are faced with is the establishment
of a comprehensive system of protected areas and the funding of
such a system. Here I am interested in learning more about Trust
Funds and Debt for Nature Swaps as well as other mechanisms
for the funding of protected areas. I would also like to learn more
of how protected areas are managed in other parts of the world.
For example here in South Africa, each of the Provincial
conservation agencies are establishing their own nature conservation
organization. These will take the form of full government
departments or statutory boards. There is also a statutory
national parks board which is responsible for the national parks
system.<P>

There are therefor 10 organizations looking after the protected area
estate in South Africa and competing for a slice of the same cake.
Linked to these 10 nature conservation organizations which are
either statutory boards or full government departments are a further
environmental protection components which look at the
broader environmental issues of waste management, pollution control,
development planning etc.<P>

I should be glad if participants in the list could let me have
reference
material on the funding of protected areas, mountain or other, and
examples of the administrative structures that have been
established to 
manage the protected area system. Please bear in mind that we are
fairly 
isolated in the Eastern Cape and that it is not always easy to obtain
obscure reference material.<P>

Many thanks<P>

Hi,<P>

My name is Ana Cordova. I am an MS/PhD student in the Natural Resource
Policy and Management program at Cornell University. I am currently studying
the viability of stakeholder involvement in natural resource decision-making
in the Copper Canyon region of Chihuahua, Mexico (Sierra Madre Occidental
Mountain Range). Citizen/public involvement is particularly relevant at this
moment, where various government agencies are independently proposing
different regional plans for this area (Tourism Master Plan, Sustainable
Forestry Plan, a possible Protected Area) and could perhaps benefit from
input from a wide range of stakeholders.<P>

This is the first time I am participating in an electronic discussion group. <P>
 
Ana.<P>

Dear Subscriber and Members of Mountain Forum,<P>
I have just subscribed and become a member of your "group", I would 
like to present myself to all of you.  My name is Agostino Da Polenza 
and my life and my work have always been and still are related to 
mountains.<P>

I started my relation with mountain as a visitor, then as an alpinist (I
reached the peak of K2 in 1983 from the chinese face) and last years as,
coordinator, leader or organisator of many mountaineering and scientific
expeditions in the Himalaya and Karakorum range.<P>

I am now managing Ev-K2-CNR Project, a multidisciplinary project related to
high altitude which base of research is the Pyramid Laboratory-Observatory
installed at Lobuche, at an altitude of 5050m nearby the base camp of Mt.
Everest.  I hope that this is enough for the moment and that my presence will be
useful and fruitful for you all and for myself.<P>

Thanks and best regards.<BR>

I'm Gary Garriott and have been involved in international development
work in one way or another for the past 27 years, including a
four-year
Peace Corps stint in Ecuador where just being in and around the Andes
was an incredible yet in some ways mystical experience. I've also
spent
a week trekking in Nepal and someday hope to figure out a way to
get to
Bhutan!
<P>
My main interest is seeing how to provide useful lowcost
communications
technologies to help preserve/protect mountain environments. My
employer
VITA (Volunteers in Technical Assistance) has been involved with low
earth orbiting satellites for the past 13-14 years which has the
capability of supplying Internet email connection for tough
environments
like mountain valleys.<P>

My I-don't-want-to-grow-up dream is to take one of these small
boxes that
can do email from a battery pack and climb Mt. Kilimanjaro! Maybe it
could be part of a general fundraising
effort/consciousness-raising event
about the fragility and importance of mountain environments in
general.
Ideas along these lines are welcome.<P>

Good luck on the conference(s).<P>

Greetings Mountain Forum Members!<p>

My name is Mark Haberle and I am a resident of the United States living
in the Green mountain State of Vermont.  I am currently employed with
the Vermont Center for Geographic Information as  GIS Data Technician. 
You may visit the site at <A HREF="http://geo-vt.uvm.edu ">http://geo-vt.uvm.edu </A> and further visit my
staff page under the "more about VCGI and its staff" link.<p>

I have been interested in the mountains of Northern New England since I
was a child.  Particular enjoyment stemmed from the open Alpine summits
of the White, Green, and Adirondack mountains.  I also have fond
memories of the sweet smell of decaying hardwood leaves from Connecticut
where I grew up.<p>

In December of 1996 I graduated from the University of Vermont with a
degree in Environmental Studies from the School of Natural Resources.  I
earned the degree from the multi-disciplinary Environmental Program with
a focus in Ecological Restoration and Monitoring.  To complete my
studies I designed and implemented a monitoring protocol for the summit
ridgeline of Mount Mansfield in Vermont.  This protocol, Photographic
Inventory Monitoring System, is designed to provide a quantifiable data
set on trends in the alpine communities directly adjacent to the highly
traveled trail treadway.<p>

Current work in the GIS field has me curious about the applicability of
GIS technology to the small scale for impact trend analysis and
monitoring.  I would love to begin a dialogue specific to trail treadway
trend analysis and monitoring techniques including the use of
photography as a monitoring tool.<p>

I look forward to participating in the Mountain Forum.<P>

Due to my
inexperience with working with mountain issues, I wanted to observe
more than 'participate', but would partake in any discussion that I could
contribute to. I am the assistant to the Vice President and Senior
Economist, in WRI's economics program. We are working on various
environmental economic issues, including carbon taxes, capital markets,
pesticides, productivity measuring, structural adjustment, and other
policy issues. I have lived in the Rockies and the Alps and am interested
in how natural resource economics analyses could benefit sustainable
mountain development. I have read some reports from ICIMOD and
receive the quarterly journal from the UNU.<P>

From: irenaha@dale.uek.cas.cz<P>
Hello in Mountain Forum,<P>

I would like to join the discussion on PFM.<BR>
My  name is  Irena Hanouskova.  Subject of  my work  is landscape
ecology.  I  am  improved  in  natural  sciences.  Nowadays, I am
oriented  particularly  to  historical  development  of landscape
structure, land use forms of Sumava Mts.<P>

Following contribution describes one way of long-term development
resulting in  area sustainability. Landscape  ecology approach is
used for the description. I am convinced, that the conditions and
constraints, gathered in Sumava case study might be considered in
analogies to similar areas with similar trajectory of land-use.
Information  is  elaborated  in  the  study  "Future for Sumava",
Institute of Landscape Ecology in 1995(-1997.)<P>


Information, which I consider as important for further contacts:<P>
(1) Project  "Biodiversity of Sumava" is  solved on the Institute
of Landscape Ecology, Czech  Republic. Sustainable development of
the  Sumava region  (Sumava Mts,  Central Europe,  large area was
declared as  National Park) is focussed  in social and economical
context. Groups  of economically and  ideologically active people
are  classified  and  assigned  to  their  roles  for  innovative
financial mechanisms in the area. For detail information contact:
Biodiversity  project, manager,  Institute of  Landscape Ecology,
Academy of Sciences, Na sadkach 7, 370 05 Ceske Budejovice, Czech
Republic.<P>
(2)  The  National  Park  Administration  is  the  most important
controlling  subject  of  Sumava  area.  Park  is responsible for
nature protection, scientific research, education and instruction
of public (particularly local  inhabitants and tourists). Park is
supported  from  national  level,  has  its  own  production  and
investments. The  important tool for  nature protection and  self
maintainig of undisturbed environment is the legacy which has the
long tradition  in Czech Republic.  Presently the possibility  of
accepting  a  special  law  for  National  Park  Sumava  is being
discussed. It might state better  condition for park economy. For
detail  information  contact:  National  Park  Sumava,  director,
Namesti 84, 341 92 Kasperske Hory, Czech Republic.<P>

<STRONG>INTRODUCTION</STRONG><P>

Tourism has become the world's largest industry, generating US $3.4 trillion in gross annual output, attracting $693 billion in capital investment, and providing over 200 million jobs globally (The World Travel and Tourism Council, 1996)   Travelers that enjoy and appreciate nature represent between 40% and 60% of the 500 millions that cross international boundaries every year, and for a growing number of countries, tourism based on natural attractions is a top earner of foreign exchange.  Given its economic power, tourism provides powerful incentives to government policy makers and local people to conserve natural and cultural resources which attract outside visitors.  Nevertheless, the immensity of the tourism industry and the possibility of its explosive growth in a region can overwhelm natural resources and community infrastructure.<P>

For the last 15 years ecotourism has been heralded as one of the most promising tools for the conservation of natural habitats.  These high expectations have not been fully realized and critics claim that many ecotourism ventures are simply a  Trojan horse--marketing tourism as environmentally friendly, but in fact destroying the very ecosystems they claim to protect.  Attaching the "ecotourism" label to poorly planned projects provides local populations with little besides social tension and environmental degradation, while leaving the tourist dissatisfied and cheated.  However, Conservation International (CI) believes that when planned and implemented properly, ecotourism can be both an effective conservation tool and a successful community development model.<P>

<STRONG><CENTER>Conservation International's mission in ecotourism is 
  to develop and support ecotourism enterprises that contribute to conservation; and
 to influence the broader tourism industry towards greater ecological sustainability.</CENTER></STRONG><br>
The CI Ecotourism Program pursues these objectives through the following activities:<P>

<STRONG>National/Regional Ecotourism Strategies</STRONG>--To maximize the conservation impact of ecotourism, CI is involved with evaluating the conservation potential of ecotourism on a national/regional level, developing ecotourism policy through a regional consensus building process, and assisting policy implementation.  Currently, the ecotourism program is working to develop an ecotourism strategy for the <STRONG>Inka Region </STRONG>in Peru.<P>








<STRONG>Capacity Building</STRONG>--The Ecotourism Program uses a local capacity building approach to ensure that ecotourism benefits communities and merges with traditional practices and conservation.  The Ecotourism Program provides effective training for both CI-local staff and community members to help them understand and manage ecotourism enterprises.  In addition to conducting training workshops, the Ecotourism Program supports capacity-building by helping to organize local ecotourism societies and disseminating detailed information on model ecotourism projects in the form of case studies.  Highlights of the Program's capacity building efforts include the <STRONG>Brazil Train-the-Trainers Workshops </STRONG>and the development and support of <STRONG>INDECON (Indonesian Ecotourism Network.)</STRONG>  Important case studies on CI s ecotourism efforts in <STRONG>Brazil, Guatemala,</STRONG> and <STRONG>Ghana </STRONG>will be developed in 1996.<P>

<STRONG>Ecotourism Product Development</STRONG>--An ecotourism product is a combination of resources, activities, and tourism services which are sold and managed through professional tour operators.  The Ecotourism Program seeks to develop ecotourism products which benefit local communities and meet conservation objectives in design, implementation, and management.  Special ecotourism product development highlights are the <STRONG>Scarlet Macaw Trail</STRONG> in Guatemala, the <STRONG>Canopy Walkway</STRONG> in Ghana, the <STRONG>Chalalan Lodge</STRONG> in Bolivia and <STRONG>Makira Island</STRONG> in the Solomon Islands.  <P>

<STRONG>International Marketing</STRONG>--To ensure the business sustainability of the ecotourism products, the Ecotourism Program actively markets CI destinations to both international tour operators and directly to ecotourists.  Ongoing marketing efforts have contributed to the success of the        Eco-Escuela in Guatemala and a new marketing highlight for the Ecotourism Program is the development of the <STRONG>Ecotravel Center</STRONG>, an Internet home-page dedicated to providing information for the ecotourist.  <P>



<STRONG>CURRENT PROJECTS<P>

<STRONG>BOLIVIA</STRONG><P></STRONG>

The Alto Madidi Region of northwestern Bolivia is located in a belt of high biodiversity which runs through western South America where the Andes meet the Amazon basin.  CI's work in the region in the early 1990s started with a Rapid Assessment Program (RAP) Expedition which reported the region as being of great significance, with extremely high levels of biodiversity.  The government of Bolivia has recognized the importance of the Madidi area by establishing the Madidi National Park in 1995 and is now looking to ecotourism as a means of generating income for the people living in and around this important ecosystem.  <P>

<STRONG>Ecolodge at Chalalan</STRONG>--CI is in a unique position to demonstrate the potential of ecotourism through the development of a model ecolodge at Chalalan.  With full support from local CI project managers, a small group of entrepreneurs from the Quechua-Tacana community of San José de Uchiapomonas constructed a few buildings in the local thatched-hut style at Lake Chalalan, a site located 2 hours by boat down river from the village.  These facilities were constructed for the existing backpacker market in Rurrenabaque.  With the help of a grant from the Inter-American Development Bank, CI has worked with experts in the field of landscape architecture from Design Workshop Inc., to ensure that the lodge will serve as a prototype for ecotourism sustainable technologies and architecture. The CI Ecotourism Program will work to ensure the effective training of community members in tourism planning and management.  This will enable them to successfully assume responsibility and ownership of all aspects of the operation by the year 2000.<P>


<STRONG>BRAZIL</STRONG><P>

Brazil is a country of continental proportions in both land mass and population.  Although recognized as the nation with the world's highest level of terrestrial diversity, each of the five major biomes of Brazil--the Amazon, the Atlantic Forest, the Pantanal Wetland, the Cerrado and the Caatinga--are significantly threatened by a variety of human activities.  The development of ecotourism as an alternative to destructive land-use practices has been a priority for the CI-Brazil Program since 1992.<P>

<STRONG>Ecotourism Train-the-Trainers Workshops</STRONG>--In 1992, CI developed a strategy for a series of ecotourism workshops for Brazil.  A 10-day train-the-trainers workshop was conceived in order to build local capacity and to adapt relevant procedures and technology to Brazilian culture and circumstances.  With a consortium of NGOs and The Ecoplan:net Institute, CI has been holding a series of  workshops since 1994.  These workshops trained tourism professionals from 8 Brazilian states to be interactive instructors (called facilitators) capable of conducting a 5-day regional ecotourism workshops.  From an original group of 35 facilitators, more than 600 individuals throughout Brazil have participated in 20 workshops.  Sixteen of the original train-the-trainers workshop participants continue to assist CI-ecotourism initiatives in Brazil as members of a Group of Specialists, and have been invited to implement the training portion of  Brazil's new National Ecotourism Plan. In December 96, further training of the original facilitators will enable them to become consultants for sustainable tourism and ecotourism developments, and to train other trainers who will disseminate the methodology  in the nine States of the Brazilian Legal Amazon. With 58 additional workshops planned for 1996, this initiative continues to meet the CI's objective of  increasing local capacity to develop and implement ecotourism ventures.    <P>

<STRONG>The Atlantic Forest</STRONG>--In the southern portion of this highly endangered rain forest, the Ecotourism Program is working to guarantee buffer zones around the Biological Reserve of Una, in Southern Bahia.  In an effort to counteract threats from logging interests in the area, the Ecotourism Program has been discussing the benefits of ecotourism to private land-owners in the area who are looking for alternative revenue sources.  One of these land-owners has been convinced that ecotourism is more lucrative than logging in the long run, and CI will be working with him to develop the tourism potential on his land.  Additionally, the Ecotourism Program is cooperating with our local partner, Instituto de Estudos Socioambientais do Sul da Bahia (IESB,) to develop a wildlife rehabilitation and visitor center for a nearby 250-room resort. <P>

<STRONG>National Marine Park of Abrolhos</STRONG>--The National Marine Park of Abrolhos, located off the coast of Southern Bahia, is the first and only marine park in Brazil.  Unfortunately, irresponsible tourism has seriously threatened seabird nesting colonies and marine fauna in and around the park boundaries.  To counter these threats, CI will be leading a consortium of NGOs in an effort to devise a management plan.  A large component of this plan will be focused on more effective regulation of tourism.<P>


<STRONG>GUATEMALA</STRONG><P>

The Maya Biosphere Reserve in Northern Guatemala is the largest remaining tract of intact tropical rainforest in Central America.  Its high level of biodiversity, and its remarkable cultural heritage contribute greatly to its ecotourism potential.  The northern lowland tropical forests provide an extensive, but highly threatened, ecosystem which makes up the Department of the Petén.  The Petén was once the center of Maya civilization and is home to the ancient city of Tikal, which draws hundreds of thousands of visitors each year.  However, travel to the Petén region has traditionally consisted only of one to two day excursions.  This has meant that local communities have received few benefits from tourism and visitors have missed opportunities to explore ecological, cultural, and other archaeological riches that the Petén has to offer.  In an effort to address these issues CI is working to develop community-based ecotourism projects which will encourage visitors to explore the other attractions of  the Petén.  <P>

<STRONG>The Scarlet Macaw Trail</STRONG>--With the support and participation of local communities, CI Guatemala (ProPetén) and the Ecotourism Program have been developing ecotourism infrastructure to help curb the destruction of  forests within the Maya Biosphere Reserve.   As a result of three years of development, the Scarlet Macaw Trail Tour was launched in May 1996, and is being marketed internationally by many respected ecotour operators.  Led and managed by the inhabitants of the Centro Campesino and El Cruce a Dos Aguadas communities, the ecotour is an ecologically-sensitive excursion through the tropical forest surrounding the El Perú archaeological site.  Visitors on the tour will enjoy local interpretation of natural and cultural attractions, including stays with the communities, and sightings of howler monkeys, imperial woodpeckers, and the endangered scarlet macaws.  Besides providing alternative livelihoods for the communities, it is hoped that the presence of tourists along the trail will deter looting of the El Perú archaeological site, prevent further agricultural encroachment into the reserve, and eradicate poaching of young scarlet macaws from nesting areas.<P>

<STRONG>The Eco-Escuela de Espanol</STRONG>--Located in the small town of San Andrés on the shores of Lake Petén-Itzá, the Eco-Escuela is a Spanish language school with an ecological curriculum for tourists.  Students of the school stay with local families and are encouraged to work on various volunteer activities within the community.  After three years of operation, nearly 700 students have participated in the program, the Eco-Escuela has become fully independent, and is managed by a cooperative of teachers, homestay owners and administrators .  With limited promotional aid from CI, the Eco-Escuela is now a model for an independent community-based ecotourism enterprise.<P>

<STRONG>Center for Information on the Culture, Nature and Arts of the Petén (CINCAP)--</STRONG>Located in the hub of Flores, the region's capital, this center serves as an information clearinghouse for tourists seeking low-impact alternative attractions in the Petén.  CINCAP exhibits local natural and cultural history and highlights regional arts and crafts.  As a center for regional environmental education and training in tourism, the center will work with local communities as well as with tourists. In October 96, it housed a Workshop for CI's enterprise project managers from 14 different countries. <P>

<STRONG>El Mirador Trail</STRONG>--ProPetén has been working with the community of Carmelita to develop infrastructure for tourists visiting the immense ruins of the Maya city of "El Mirador."  Located in northern Petén, the project was initiated to generate sustainable economic alternatives for the community which conserve the natural resources of the area.  An association of local guides has formed a committee to direct tourism activities around Carmelita, including leading expeditions along the El Mirador Route.  The community has recently constructed an eco-camp to host arriving visitors for this five-day interpretive trip.  The camp provides environmentally friendly showers and self-composting toilets to ensure minimal impact on the ecosystem.  The Ecotourism Program will work to link this product with a larger market to increase revenues and jobs and thereby provide even greater protection for the Petén forests.<P>


<STRONG>PERU</STRONG><P>

The tropical forests of Peru contain an enormous variety of habitats and organisms making it one of the world's centers of biological diversity.  Combined with unique cultural attractions such as Machu Picchu, the nation has the potential to be one of the world's premier ecotourism destinations.  Unfortunately, lack of strategic planning to take advantage of these incredible resources has left them open to rapid degradation by environmentally destructive industries, including poorly managed tourism.<P>

<STRONG>Ecotourism Strategy for the Inka Region</STRONG>-- With the support of the Peru United Nations Development Program, CI's Ecotourism Program is working to develop a sustainable tourism development plan for the Inka Region.  Utilizing a unique consensus building approach, the Ecotourism Program is working with stakeholders in the departments of Cusco, Madre de Dios, and Apurimac to produce a practical strategy for ecotourism development in the region. The strategy will include necessary first steps for policy implementation, as well as the identification of  alternative sites, trails, and attractions to ensure that tourism revenues are distributed throughout the region.<P>


<STRONG>SURINAME/GUYANA</STRONG><P>

Located on the northeastern coast of South America, the adjacent countries of Guyana and Suriname still maintain 80% of its surface covered with uninterrupted expanses of tropical forest in the northern reaches of the Amazon Basin.  Due to low population density and shifting political fortunes, there has been virtually no pressures on these forests until recently.  New logging and mining concessions, road construction, insufficient protected areas systems and policies, and lack of economic opportunity, are now posing tremendous threats to the incredible biodiversity of these nations.  
Ecotourism is already a budding economic activity in both of these countries and has tremendous potential to improve income opportunities for local people and promote conservation.  Both Suriname and Guyana have tremendous ecotourism potential due to the cultural diversity of Maroon and Amerindian communities and an array of unique and fantastic natural attractions. Although obstacles to effective development of ecotourism must be overcome, growing political stability creates a situation where tourism can generate considerable foreign exchange and job opportunities. <P>

All CI projects for ecotourism in these nations are in the initial stages.  The Ecotourism Program will work with both Guyana and Suriname in government planning efforts to establish ecotourism policies and guidelines.  Additionally, the Ecotourism Program will be working with the design of facilities and business opportunities in the communities of Kwamala and Asindopo in Suriname, and the development of a unique cultural and rain forest tour with the Nappi community in the Kanuku mountains of Guyana, where scientists have detected the highest population density known for the endangered Harpy Eagle. <P>



<STRONG>BOTSWANA</STRONG><P>

CI's program in Botswana focuses exclusively on the Okavango Delta.  As the world's largest inland delta, protection of the Okavango ecosystem is critical for both the wildlife and the people in the region.  In order to ensure both environmental protection and enhanced economic stability, the CI-Botswana Program is seeking to develop community management of the increasing numbers of tourists coming to the delta.<P>

<STRONG>CI-Botswana Expedition</STRONG>--CI is working with an ecotour operator, Explorers, to develop an unique eco-safari to the Okavango for 1997.  Individuals on the tour will have the opportunity to not only enjoy the wonders of the delta, but will be able to visit project sites with CI-Botswana Director, Karen Ross, and witness first-hand Conservation International's efforts to protect this important ecosystem. New staffing for the program will expand the possibility for ecotourism products. <P>

<STRONG>GHANA</STRONG><P>

The Upper Guinean rainforest block in West Africa is one of the most diverse ecosystems on the continent.  The forest zone in Ghana contains the eastern fifth of this important ecosystem. The CI-Ghana Program is presently focused in the Kakum National Park whose forest elephants, seven species of primates, high antelope and bird diversity provide tremendous potential for ecotourism.   The park will serve as a model in West Africa  for integrated conservation and economic development by combining sound scientific analysis and ecotourism as a sustainable enterprise.   To achieve this goal, CI provides technical assistance for the planning and development of Kakum.  <P>

Early in 1995, CI and the American Society of Landscape Architecture organized a charette for the conceptual design of the Kakum Conservation Area to be developed within the framework established by the Tourism Development Scheme for the Central Region (TODSCER.)  The workshop resulted in designs for a canopy walkway system and a visitor center to enhance tourist experience and understanding of the natural and cultural history of Ghana. <P>

<STRONG>Kakum Canopy Walkway</STRONG>--The first of its kind on the African continent, the Kakum canopy walkway was completed and opened to visitors on Earth Day 1995. Seven suspended walkways extend over some 1,000 feet, attached to six platforms in tall trees, and  allow visitors to experience the rainforest where its biodiversity is at its highest, at heights up to 100 feet . The walkway has greatly increased the numbers of national and international tourists coming to the park: in 1992, fewer than 2000 people visited the park, whereas in 1996 more than 30,000 visitors are expected.   This increase in visitation, while still far below the 70,000 annual visitor capacity, has brought jobs and revenue into the area and demonstrated to local communities the profitability of protecting the park. CI is working in several nearby villages to develop other business alternatives for the population. <P>

<STRONG>Kakum Visitor Center</STRONG>--Although a temporary center currently displays culture and nature exhibits, the planned Kakum Visitor Center will become model for protected areas throughout Ghana and West Africa.  Highlights of  the facilities at Kakum include the innovative use of local materials and crafts in its design, and creative educational exhibits.  Combined with the canopy walkway, this world-class visitor center will attract ecotourists and thereby preserve cultural and natural resources.<P>


<STRONG>MADAGASCAR</STRONG><P>

Madagascar is often considered the highest biodiversity conservation priority on earth.  Its unique evolutionary history has resulted in exceptional species numbers and endemism (species that exist only in a specific ecosystem.)  Because of this fascinating natural history, Madagascar could rival the Galapagos Islands as a natural tourism attraction.   Unfortunately, the island has yet to live up to its promise as an ecotourism destination.  As threats of further deforestation increase, the CI Ecotourism Program is working to develop ecotourism in Madagascar as a means of protecting this natural heritage.<P>

<STRONG>Ankarafantsika Reserve</STRONG>--Located in northwestern Madagascar, the Ankarafantsika Reserve plays a vital role in protecting watersheds and directly supports nearly 20,000 Malagasy whose daily lives depend on the region's rice crops for sustenance.  CI believes that an ecotourism industry focused on Ankarafantsika's rich wildlife will not only promote conservation within the region, but could also be a major source of foreign exchange for Madagascar.  Many of the reserve's lemurs (a primate endemic to the island) are found nowhere else on earth; yet only a handful of lemur watching sites are visited regularly.  Additionally, the reserve houses a research station for an endangered tortoise which is also rarely visited.  The Ecotourism Program is conducting a market survey to determine the best strategies for developing ecotourism in the reserve's buffer zone.  The objective is to provide local communities with a sustainable means for subsistence which will not endanger the natural resources of the reserve, as part of a broader Integrated Conservation and Development Project. <P>

<STRONG>INDONESIA</STRONG><P>

Despite occupying only 1.3% of the earth's land surface, Indonesia has a level of biodiversity which rivals that of Brazil.  The more than 17,000 islands which make up the nation contain the world's largest number of mammal species, over 20,000 plant species, and 17% of the world's bird species.  This natural diversity is matched by Indonesia's cultural diversity.  The population of 180 million have hundreds of distinct cultures and languages.  As the nation experiences rapid economic growth, CI's efforts in Indonesia are focused on strengthening the capacity of Indonesian organizations and establishing successful enterprises to promote the conservation of marine and forest ecosystems.<P>

<STRONG>Togian Islands</STRONG>--The Togian Islands of Central Sulawesi have extraordinary potential in ecotourism and an unique opportunity to promote an integrated conservation program for both terrestrial and marine ecosystems.  Diving and snorkeling options in the Togians are exceptional, and the islands themselves host a wide array of endemic fauna attractions.  As large-scale tourism development is a realistic threat, CI has been working with the District Tourism Agency to ensure sound planning of conservation areas and tourism zones.  In 1996, the Ecotourism Program will be working on capacity building, product development, and international marketing for the Togian Islands.<P>

<STRONG>INDECON</STRONG>--The Indonesian Ecotourism Network (INDECON) was established in 1995 by the Institute for Indonesian Tourism Studies, in association with Bina Swadaya tours and CI.  This non-profit organization publishes a newsletter on Indonesian ecotourism issues and hosts monthly seminars which are attended by a variety of local NGOs, the Indonesian government, USAID,  and in-county tour operators.  The Ecotourism Program continues to act as a special advisor to INDECON, and will aid them in their efforts to support Indonesian ecotourism projects and develop different training modules for guides, tour operators, and developers of ecotourism products. <P>

<STRONG>Gunung Gede Pangrango National Park</STRONG> --Located only an hour away from Jakarta, Gunung Gede park receives hundreds of thousands of annual visitors, and offers a tremendous opportunity to disseminate information to both visiting locals and tourists on issues important to conservation in Indonesia.  The park protects two mountainous formations with unique fauna and flora, and CI is working with a consortium for the development of tourist infrastructure at the site, including a canopy walkway and a visitor center.<P>


<STRONG>PAPUA NEW GUINEA</STRONG><P>

Papua New Guinea (PNG) is the largest country in Melanesia, and is one of the most biologically and culturally diverse nations in the world.  It contains the Old World s greatest expanses of forests, mangroves, and reefs that still thrive in a largely pristine condition.  PNG's wealth in biological diversity is matched by an unrivaled cultural diversity with over 700 distinct languages. <P>

Over the past five years, the PNG highlands have developed into one of the most popular cultural ecotourism destinations in the world.  However, if ecotourism in PNG is to prosper, the  Ecotourism Program believes that it is the responsibility of all tourism operators and other stakeholders involved in tourism to ensure that their products are environmentally sensitive and contribute to the conservation of the natural and cultural resources.  To meet this objective, the Ecotourism Program seeks to increase local capacity to improve existing ecotourism and to develop additional sites outside of the PNG highlands.<P>

<STRONG>Community-based Ecotourism Planning Workshop</STRONG>--In collaboration with the Ecoplan:net Institute and the PNG Tourism Promotion Authority, CI held an ecotourism workshop in July of 1996.  The workshop effectively introduced thirty PNG tourism professionals to the essential components that are required to develop a successful ecotourism venture.  Based on the model provided by the ecotourism workshops in Brazil, this process will provide participants with relevant ecotourism planning skills and the ability to share these skills with other communities and members of the travel industry.<P>

<STRONG>Lakekamu Basin</STRONG>--The Lakekamu Basin, an incredible tract of lowland rain forest surrounded by hills and high mountains, supports approximately  2,000 people in several village settlements near the basin's major rivers.  Most of this area is rarely, if ever, visited, and thus constitutes a near-pristine natural destination with high conservation potential. Timber agents continue to look at the area for large-scale logging.  Working with all four of the major land-owning peoples, CI has been developing tourism enterprises in the Basin.  A trek through the spectacular gorge county up to the Kuper Range field station has been mapped out and maps for shorter hikes along an old World War II road next to the beautiful Avi-avi river are being developed for a softer ecotour.  CI is working with the Biara and Kovio peoples to develop two simple lodges for tourists to the Basin.  With natural attractions including tree kangaroos, the southern cassowary, and numerous species of birds of paradise, these ecotourism initiatives provide the first promise of a sustainable alternative in the Lakekamu Basin.<P>


<STRONG>PHILIPPINES</STRONG><P>

Although over 95% of its forested area has been lost, the Philippine archipelago has the highest levels of endemism in the Indo-Malayan realm.  CI's efforts in the Philippines focus on preserving the last remaining tracts of forest on the islands of Luzon, Palawan and Mindanao, and on protecting the incredible marine richness along the coast of the nation.  Due to the fact that subsistence use is a major cause of  destruction in both of these ecosystems, along with destructive technologies like dynamite and cyanide fishing, CI's work in the Philippines emphasizes the development of  conservation enterprises such as ecotourism.<P>

<STRONG>St. Paul's and El Nido National Parks, Palawan</STRONG>-- Both St. Paul's National Park and El Nido National Park receive thousands of tourists, attracted by the unique underwater river that runs along the coast of Palawan and the haunting limestone formations that characterize the coast.  However, tourists to the area currently come with city tour operators for day visits, resulting in little or no benefit for the local communities.  To address this issue, the Ecotourism Program will be working to build the local capacity for tourism and develop ecotourism products to help the communities around St. John National Park and El Nido National park benefit from the tourism coming to their area.<P>

<STRONG>Tubbataha Reefs National Marine Park, Palawan</STRONG>--The Tubbataha Reefs National Marine Park is a World Heritage site located in the open sea, close to the island of Palawan, and its conservation is already a priority for the local diving community.  Keidenren, a Japanese foundation, is funding a broad conservation plan to be developed by a presidential Task Force with CI as a leading member.  <P.

<STRONG>Palanan</STRONG>--In 1992, CI identified ecotourism as a potential sustainable enterprise in Palanan, located in the Sierra Madre Mountains of Northern Luzon, northern Philippines.  This area was rated by consultants from Mountain Travel/Sobek and The Ecoplan:net Institute as an attractive regional and international destination.  The consultants then developed a carrying capacity plan and itineraries for varying interests were for Palanan.  The Ecotourism Program has been involved with training of nature guides and other tourism service providers, and is looking to expand its efforts in facilitating Palanan's entry into international ecotourism markets.<P>


<STRONG>SOLOMON ISLANDS</STRONG></STRONG><P>

The Solomon Islands are a double chain of islands which extend eastward from Papua New Guinea and presently maintain 80% of the land covered in tropical forest.  The country sustains high levels of endemism due to its remote location, however, forest and marine ecosystem degradation caused by the timber industry are becoming significant concerns for the islands biodiversity conservation.  As the majority of tourists to the Solomon Islands are divers, the Ecotourism Program strategy involves developing an ecotourism product which would highlight the forest ecosystem and island culture as an additional attraction for a stay on the islands.<P>

<STRONG>Makira Island</STRONG>--Working through the Solomon Islands Development Trust, CI has developed a model of community-based ecotourism.  Tours to Makira Island include a trek through the cloud forest of the highlands, a visit to the rural community at Hauta,  and a stay with the hill top people of Hunama.  Only four trips a year are planned, as the communities would like tourism to provide them with much needed currency, but not impact their daily routines.  In 1996, the Ecotourism Program will be looking to link the local tour operator with a greater international market, to increase the revenues from the enterprise and thereby provide an alternative to destructive logging and unsustainable harvesting of marine products. <P>

social
anthropologists and geographers involved in all aspects of Himalayan
studies (Nepal, India, Tibet, Bhutan). In the recent years, we
completed
two multi-disciplinary research progammes on the interactions of
societies
and environment in Nepal, one at the village level in the middle
mountains
of Nuvakot district, the other in the low mountains of Gulmi and
Argha-Khanci districts. Our main focus is on historical as well as
regional
comparisons. In this respect, we have begun a new project on "Past and
Present Changes of Landscapes in the Himalayas". Our aim is to
understand
the wide diversity of landscapes in this area which may not be
exclusively
justified either by natural or human factors. The historical
perspective
may help to go beyond the current assumptions concerning the
degradation of
Himalayan environment in the recent years.<P>

Much of my work presently focusses on alleviating people-wildlife conflict
due top crop or livestock damage. TMI and ISLT have sponsored training
workshops for park staff in places as diverse as Tibet, Pakistan and

enhanced means of income-generation, such as ecotourism, nature viewing and
photography, using participatory resource management as a foundation for
conserving species, ecosystems and communities in remote mountains.<P>

Hi,<P>

I'm Dwayne Knox and I work with the Newton County Resource
Council, in 
the Boston Mountain Range of the Ozark Mountains of Northern
Arkansas, on 
the headwaters of the Buffalo River. We are located on the highest 
uplands between the Rocky Mountains and the Appalachians, and have
the 
highest waterfall between them too. Most of our county is managed
by the 
U.S Forest Service as the Buffalo Ranger District of the Ozark
National 
Forest, or by the National Park Service as the Buffalo National
River. 
The entire river is undamned and free flowing, and is in under
federal 
management from the headwaters to the mouth. We have a large Elk
herd and 
a large number of Black Bear. The more remote southern half of our
county 
has a population density of about 7 people per square mile, and
contains 
four Wilderness Areas. The Census Bureau considers our county 100%
rural.<P>


The Newton County Resource Council and the Ecotourism Project <P>

The Ecotourism Project is a program of the Newton County Resource 
Council, (NCRC), a nonprofit community development corporation.
Since 
1987 NCRC has worked to improve the quality of life in Newton County 
while preserving and enhancing the county's traditions, values and 
natural resources.  NCRC's other current projects include Harmony
House, 
a shelter for victims of domestic violence, Project Care, an adult
day 
care center, Bradley Park, a ten acre park on the Little Buffalo
River, 
Summer Youth Program, a six week-day camp for elementary aged
children, 
Healthy Families Arkansas providing information for new parents,
and the 
Newton County Single Parent Scholarship Fund.<P>

NCRC is committed through grassroots organizing, training, and
leadership 
development to empowering low-income people to be part of the
solution to 
the pervasive poverty in Newton County.  The county's $10,406 per
capita 
income rates last of the 75 Arkansas counties, per capita retail
sales 
are $750 and 52% of the county's workforce are employed outside the 
county.  The Ozark National Forest and the Buffalo National River
manage 
59% of the county's 822 square miles.<P>

In late 1991 NCRC began the VISTA community economic development
project 
to study sectors of the economy which would stimulate job
opportunities 
for low-income families.  Ecotourism was chosen in 1993 as it
combines 
magnificent scenery, bountiful natural resources, rich cultural
heritage 
and the diverse backgrounds, talents and knowledge of local people.  
Ecotourism seeks to preserve the qualities of life that make Newton 
County unique.<P>

Establishing ecotourism in Newton County calls for dialogue, 
experimentation, imagination, collaboration and alliances.
Ecotourism  
funding is provided by The National Corporation for Community
Service, 
the Winthrop Rockefeller Foundation, the Campaign for Human
Development, 
and the Foundation for the Mid-South.  The  Ozark National Forest, 
Buffalo National River and Arkansas Game and Fish resource
managers are 
committed partners.  Ozark Ecotours gives you an opportunity to
become 
part of a community economic development that filters out the harmful 
side effects of irresponsible tourism while striving for job creation 
that is economically viable, ecologically sound and socially just.<P>

Ecotourism, Newton County style uses the skills, talents and
knowledge of 
local people to promote activities that share the county's natural 
resources and cultural heritage.  The number of visitors is kept
to no 
more than fifteen, and activities are dispersed throughout the
county and 
throughout the year, ensuring that fragile ecological and historic
sites 
are not "loved to death."   Ecotour sites are monitored for the 
accumulated impact of tourism and collected data is shared with
federal 
and state resource managers.  Job creation barriers are removed by
the 
project providing land use permits, liability insurance, access to 
transportation, advertising and booking and one-on-one assistance
in tour 
development.  Already existing small businesses providing lodging,
arts 
and crafts,  food and retail services are utilized and promoted.<P>

The project staff and VISTA volunteers are assisted in
implementing the 
program by the Ecotourism Advisory Team which meets bi-monthly and
its 
steering committee of nine meets monthly to:<BR>
* plan and develop goals which meets low-income needs. <BR>
*assure that the program conforms to the values of ecotourism and 
preservation of cultural and natural resources.<BR>
*evaluate the program and report to the NCRC board on its progress.<BR>
*foster involvement and leadership skills of project participants. <BR>
*reach out to the community to inform and involve county residents. <P>

The Ecotourism Project of NCRC is community economic development
which 
strives to be economically viable, ecologically sound and socially
just 
in a NCRC's Ecotourism Project is seeking to filter out the
harmful side 
effects of irresponsible tourism while preserving what it has to
offer 
visitors to the benefits of its residents.  We hope that you will
come 
and share what is a very special place in the natural state.<P>

NCRC carries out its activities on a very low budget derived from 
foundation, church, corporation, federal state and individual donors.<P>

I am currently looking at Mt Kinabalu in Sabah

mountain. There is also a huge copper mining operation operating
nearby in
the same vicinity. Both Mt Kinabalu and the copper mine operation
have the
disctinction for being the highest and largest in South 
East Asia respectively. The people around that area are suffering
(have been
suffering since 1976) from some kind of health difficulty. We have
tried to
identify the source of this problem for years and it could be from the
overuse of pesticides used for farming to heavy metal poisoining. It 
is anybody's guess. By the way, Mount Kinabalu is a tourist
attraction with a 
growing number of tourists hiking up the mountain every year. It is
also
known as the Mountain of Gods by the natives here. I hope that I

I am a 30 year old Environmental Studies undergraduate student at the 
University of Vermont in Burlington, Vermont, USA.  My background is in 
the field of backcountry human waste management.<P>

1) I am a 1995 and 1997 National Security Scholar and will be returning 
to Nepal for continued language study and research of water and 
wastewater issues.  In the Spring of 1995, I completed a report on human 
waste management in Mt. Everest National Park.  This report included 
analyzing two solar-assisted toilets located in the Park.  The report is 
available in full-test (and with photos) at my web site below.<P>

In the Spring of 1997, I plan to conduct a watershed sanitary survey (as 
outlined by the American Water Works Association, AWWA) in Mt. Everest 
National Park to analyze potential water quality problems and recommend a 
management plan.<P>

2) In the summer and fall of 1996, I worked with the United States Forest 
Service Technology and Development Center in San Dimas, California 
designing a passive solar cooker to pasteurize the compost removed from 
backcountry toilets at Yosemite National Park, California, USA.  We 
demonstrated that the end-product from these toilets could be safely 
treated on-site and that all Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 
regulations could be met.  I also have experience dealing with 
high-altitude treatment and disposal of human waste including field work 
at Mt Rainier National Park, Washington, USA studying techniques for 
human waste dehydration and the current blue bag policy (for climbers to 
pack-out their waste).  <P>

3) Following a literature search and field site visits of various waste 
treatment systems, I designed a working composting toilet system at Crag 
Camp on Mt. Adams, NH, USA (el. 4,270 ft).  This facility is located in 
the alpine zone of the Presidential Range in the Appalachian Mountains 
and is subject to extreme weather conditions.<P>

I am happy to share information about my experiences with sanitation in 
mountain environments and would appreciate guidance to any available 
information regarding my up-coming research in the Mt. Everest region 
relating to past water quality issues in the Park.<P>

Hello, my  name is Charles Little. I am a civil engineer working
in the
field of 
rural area water supply and sanitation for the Navajo people in
southwestern 
United States. Surprisingly, many Navajo people are without adequate 
drinking water.  I have worked at this position for both the
Navajo and 
Tohono O'dham people, of southern Arizona,  since 1984. Before that I 
studied at Pennsylvania State University for four years.<P>

The highlight of my life so far, hence the interest in sustainable
development 
for mountain ecosystems, was a two year Peace Corps experience in
Nepal. 
In 1977, I was with the first and last group of rural area water
supply 
surveyors for Peace Corps Nepal. Peace Corps later decided that it
was a 
good position for an extended volunteer instead of a new volunteer
because 
the position required good language skills and also was a rather
rewarding 
position.  The position was rewarding because the villagers,
hoping to get 
water piped near their home, always would treat the Saab surveyor
well; 
feeding them either chicken meat, eggs, raksi, or yogurt. Besides
that, the 
surveyor got to travel quite extensively as I did through most of
eastern 
Nepal. I also spent three weeks in Argakanchi District southwest
of Pokhara.<P>

Nowadays, we live in Flagstaff, Arizona,  a mountain community in
northern 
Arizona. The community is nestled among a Ponderosa Pine forests
which 
used to have logging as one of the main industries. Since then and
for a
variety 
of reasons, logging is no more a viable industry. Flagstaff is now
a bustling 
university, Northern Arizona University, and tourist town.
Tourism is 
popular especially during the summer because its proximity to the
Grand 
Canyon and the Native American reservations. <P>

Thank you to the Mountain Institute in their efforts to extend the
dialogue to 
all of us out here. <P>

Hello, namaste to you all from Kathmandu, Nepal.
My name is Usha Little.  I live in Flagstaff, Arizona and have been
working with the Navajo American Indian communities of  Northern
Arizona as a rural development specialist.  I recently returned to
Nepal to share my  forest ecosystem management and economic
development experiences with the Nepali rural communities.<P>
The major areas of my interest while I was in Northern Arizona has been
introduction of community based natural resource management based on
community forestry principles and establishment of cultural and
ecotourism in the Navajo Indian Reservation communities.
At present, Navajo communities, similar to the many communities of
developing nations, are concerned with local empowerment, cultural
preservation, and sustainable development.  The Arizona American
Indian Tourism Association have been established to  promote
community based environmentally acceptable, culturally appropriate,
and economically sustainable tourism programs.  One of the main
challenges faced by the native communities of Northern Arizona is
how to promote tourism industries that promotes local community
empowerment while maintaining highest priority to the preservation of
natural wonders and endangered native traditions.<P> This is all for now
and I hope to share more discussions pertinent to tourism development
in natural resource depended indigenous communities soon.<P>

I have been working for the Florida Division of Historical Resources,

The most significant of these were: (1) a management plan for Florida's
Submerged Cultural Resources (shipwrecks and other inundated heritage sites), funded by the Coastal Zone Management Program; and (2) a study of US Navy shipwrecks in Florida waters, funded by the U.S. Dept. of Defense Legacy Program. Although my work has had little to do with mountain preservation, I have been gradually broadening my natural and cultural heritage management perspective! The recent IUCN World Conservation Congress in Montreal, provided me with an excellent overview of developments in many fields of heritage preservation. There were many excellent presentations concerning mountain preservation at the Congress.  Dr. Larry Hamilton, and his wife Linda, of the Islands and Highlands Environmental Consultancy, tirelessly organized the mountain preservation sessions at the Conference. They also organized a delicious "mountain preservation" dinner which was well attended! I hope to continue to develop my career in heritage management, such as with World Heritage Sites and historic parks. I would like to follow on-going developments with heritage corridors, greenways, and mountain preservation, as part of my career growth. I look forward to being a part of the Mountain Forum.<BR>

Re: wolf depredation case study<P>

  My

long-term contract for the Peace Corps in Mongolia, setting up a new
program in envrionmental protection.  We currently have 3 volunteers
working in protected areas here, and 6 more should be coming this
summer.<P>

I am trying to put together a two week inservice training course for
the volunteers and their counterparts, (Mongolian biologists, and
resource specialists working for the Protected Area Bureau here).  I've
been thinking that an intensive case study in setting up and
implementing a monitoring program might be a good exercise, if it
involves a lot of practical field work.  One of the common management
issues at all three protected areas, is livestock depredation by
wolves.  The park service here needs lots of assistance with carrying
out scientific studies, planning monitoring activities, and
predator-prey ecology.  If you have the time, and would be interested
in giving me some advice, let me know, and I'll send you some info on
what I'm considering doing.  We are looking for technical assistance on
designing and planning the training.  If you or your organization would
be interested, let me know also.  The training would probably be held
in early May of this year.<P>

Greetings.<P>

I am Don Messerschmidt, a PhD Anthropologist (Univ. of Oregon
1974), who has 
worked extensively in the Himalayas both as a social science
researcher and 
development adviser and consultant. <P>

My anthropological interests in mountains are partly demonstrated
in a 
2-part article in Mountain Research and Development entitled "Hindu 
Pilgrimage to Muktinath, Nepal" (in 2 parts; 1989, v.9,
no.2:89-118). (I am 
also on the editorial board of this journal.)<P>

I have also published a book on the Gurungs, a Himalayan ethnic
group, and 
on many subjects dealing with the culture and societies of mountain 
peoples... Two collections are now out from Bibliotheca Himalayica
(EMR 
Publishing House, Kathmandu): one on development studies, the
other on 
ethnic groups.<P>

My development/consulting interests are focused on natural resources 
management, especially social forestry. I have a number of
publications in 
this field. My most recent sojourn to the Himalayas was on a
consultancy for 
the Australian Government (which funds one of the finest community
forestry 
development projects in the Himalayan mid-hills), to determine the 
feasibility of extending the community forestry/user group management 
approach to the highest altitude forests. I led the team of
foresters and 
social scientists over a 4-months period. Great high altitude
trekking and 
research! The work was conducted using rapid and participatory
assessment 
techniques (both for forest profile transects and village
interviews and 
observations). I have developed a special expertise in the use of
rapid 
appraisal for such purposes.<P>

I was raised in the mountains of SE Alaska at Juneau. I currently
live on 
the fringe of the Cascades, in Vancouver, Washington (near
Portland, OR).<P>

Howdy! <P> I am Roger Morefield, and I teach economics in a small
private 
university in Houston, the University of Saint Thomas.   I don't have 
strong environmental credentials, as my PhD. work in economics
relates 
more to applied microeconomics and history of political economy.  
However, in the past year I have been working to develop some
areas of 
research interest in environmental economics, and business and the 
environment.  I tend to lurk on some of these environmental
discussion 
lists, not contributing much but actively monitoring the threads of 
discussion.  I am a native of the mountains of Southwestern
Virginia, so 
my interest was piqued when I saw the post announcing this list.  For 
those of you with some knowledge to share, what are the "hot" issues 
right now?  What special attention or expertise is required by
mountain 
ecosystems that distinguishes them from other kinds of systems?<P>
Thanks 
in advance for your responses - I look forward to reading and
learning 
from them.   <P>

Dear forumnites,<P>
I am a 36 years old researcher. I am working at the University of Turin and
I am a forester.<P>
My scientific interest are in three topics strictly related:<P>

- Forest-wildlife relationships in the mountain forests. Wild ungulates
impact on the forest regeneration process and on the dynamics of the
subalpine forests, wildlife requirements relative to forest stands.<BR>

- Silviculture and Ecology of the mountain forests. Disturbance history,
regeneration process, silvicultural methods in alpine subalpine forests. <BR>

- Dendroecology at upper forest limits.<P>

I am working in the Italian alpine environment both in the western and in
the eastern Alps and I'm involved in regional and European projects. I am
looking for connections with people that work on the same subjects in other mountain areas (especially Himalaya and  Andes) for information exchange, visits and new projects.<P>

I am Malcolm (Mac) Odell, with The Mountain Institute's Makalu-Barun
National Park & Conservation Area Project (MBCP), working with Brian
Peniston (Nepal) and Bob Davis and Gabriel Campbell(US) from whom
Forum members have already heard.  My duties now are to support field
operations, particularly those related to community development, cultural
conservation, and eco-tourism.  These are three areas that we see as integrally
related to our tasks of advancing mountain cultures and protecting mountain
environments.  Personally, I also see these to be three key components in
addressing the issues at the heart of this dialog on 'paying for the mountains.'<P>

 Previously I served as a Peace Corps volunteer in Nepal, 1962-67,
including two y ears when I was fortunate enough to be the first
volunteer posted in the high mountains, living for 2 years in Solu-Khumbu
when it was an exceedingly poor, remote, and seldom visited area.  I think
some 65 travelers made it to Namche during the year I lived there. Seeing the
potential for tourism, and believing that it should be controlled directly
by the local people, I also helped arrange training in Switzerland
for the first Sherpa eco-tourism entrepreneur, who later started the first
Nepali-owned trekking agency.<P>

Hello everyone,<P>

My name is Bikash Pandey. I am currently a student at the Energy &
Resources
Program at UC Berkeley. I am from Nepal and have been working
there for the
last ten years to promote rural electrification through village level
micro-hydro schemes. I first worked with the Development and
Consulting
Services out of Butwal and later with the Intermediate Technology
Development Group in Kathmandu. Recently, I was also involved as
part of an
NGO "Alliance for Energy" in campaigning against the Arun III
hydroelectric
project proposed in Eastern Nepal.<P>


I am interested in ways to help mountain communities (in the
Himalayas and
else where) become self sufficient in clean, renewable energy. One key
aspect of this is finding creative funding mechanisms to make this
happen;
another is encouraging government policies that are conducive to
this; and
yet a third is having access to appropriate technologies. I am
interested in
all three and would particularly like to hear the experience of
others that
work on issues of energy in mountain communities.<P>

From: pob266@pobox.infomark.it <P>

I am a 27 years old geomorphologist graduated in Milan (Italy) in July 1994. 
Since I graduated I have been working in geoenvironmental topics in mountain
areas; in particular my interests are in geoenvironmental hazards forecasting
and geomorphological mapping. These interests have roots both in my passion
in mountain, snow, alpinism, and in my concerning in nature observation. <P>

During my master thesis research I spent two years in the Central Alps. The
aim of the research was to assess and map permafrost occurrence in mountain
regions. To achieve this aim I made use of several methodologies employing
both direct (e.g. holes) and indirect (e.g. geophysics, Basal Temperature of
Snow cover measurements, temperature of springs...) measurements. The
research was conducted both in winter and in summer time. I spent long
periods at altitude higher than 2500 a.s.l. in glacial and periglacial
environment where, with a colleague of mine, I carried out field
measurements in and around several rockglaciers. <BR>
This direct contact with such environment led me to go further in
geomorphological research and in exploration in mountain regions of  other
countries, and I seized the opportunity to work with Professor Petru Urdea
of the University of Timisoara, Romania, thanks to a grant provided by the
Italian Foreign Affairs Ministry. In Romania I faced a culture with
different cultural and historical tradition; there I projected and carried
through a research designed to find a relation on regional scale between air
temperature annual trends and ground temperature in the Carpathians. In
spite of the poor resources available I achieved successful results
cooperating with local scholars in a friendly and highly motivated team with
whom I am still in contact. <P>

>From April to October 1996, I worked in Belgium within the research team of
the Agricultural Engineering Land Management Laboratory (RVL) in Gent. At
RVL I computed a model for soil erosion assessment making use of GIS
technologies, whose final report on the complete procedure followed I can
send on request. This experience allowed me acquire skills in mastering
ARC/INFO, ARC/VIEW, IDRISI and some database software systems as DB IV and
ACCESS. <BR>
During November, December and part of January I collaborated with Remote
Sense Data Engineering, a company which develops a specific GIS software
package called Cartha and which makes use of remote sensed data.<P>

I am particularly eager to widen my experience in geoenvironmental hazards
assessment in mountain regions making use of GIS techniques, remote and
field data capture. I would like to be involved in a long-term research
within a research team.<BR>
My sojourns in both European and non-European countries have fostered my
enthusiasm in collaborating with different cultures I and have strengthened
my collaboration skills. <P>

That's all!<BR>
Best Regards, Jacopo.<P>

Hola!<P> I am writing from Quito Ecuador. I am an anthropologist from 
Peru, working in Ecuador since January 1994 as coordinator of the 
"Programa en Sociadades de Montan~a y Desarrollo Sustentable" at the 
Facultad Latinoamericana de Ciencias Sociales (FLACSO-Ecuador). I 
work as part of a 6 persons team that works in mountain sites in 4 
protected areas that include large portions of high altitude 
mountains. Our team works in each one of these site as part of larger 
consortiums and programs of research and development.<P>

Before coming to Ecuador I worked for the International Potato Center 
(CIP) in Lima, Peru, in a project devoted to promoting potato 
seed multiplication schemes for small farmers in different Andean 
regions of Peru.  For my doctoral dissertation I had 
the fortune of working in a gorgeous mountain region of 
southeastern Peru (3,500 - 4,500 masl), close to the Bolivian border, 
studying the connections between traditional agriculture and off-farm 
income produced by migration to gold mines.<P>

I was born in the FLAT lands of the Peruvian desert but I have now 
spent most of my professional life at high altitudes enjoying these 
great skies and views... Looking forward to join the discussion 
group,<P>

From: Jamie Ross  3jdr6@qlink.queensu.ca
<P>
My name is Jamie Ross and I'm a Master's student in the Department of
Geography at Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario, Canada. My work is
centred on an analysis of the processes and rates of sediment transport
and deposition in a middle mountain watershed in the Nepal Himalaya. I
have spent two field seasons in the Phewa Tal watershed over the past year
looking at the impacts of monsoon vs. non-monsoon weather conditions on
processes of sediment mobilisation, transport and delivery to the
reservoir. The study has involved the collection of numerous sediment core
samples, discharge data, and lake water column data in order to determine
the relationships between climate, river discharge, suspended sediment
loads, lake stratification and mixing patterns and sedimentation.<p>

Aside from research, my interests in mountain environments lie in
recreation in the form of climbing, trekking etc. I am
fortunate in that I will be able to combine these interests in an 
"environmental expedition" to Mt. Everest in the spring of '98. The
purpose of the expedition will be to remove much of the waste accumulating
at base camp and those camps above it, that has been left by previous
expeditions. Work will also be aimed at assessing the current situation at
base camp and implementing alternatives that will help to mitigate the
presently severe ecological impacts that arise as a result of large
numbers of climbers and trekkers visiting each year.<p>

I look forward to becoming involved in discussions with other forum
members and would welcome anyone who is interested to contact me regarding
research, recreation or both.<p>

Sincerely,<p>

Jamie Ross

From: paul@dobrich.uspc.bg <P>
                                         
I am a US Peace Corps volunteer working on business development in
Bulgaria.
I do extensive work with the tourist industry here and have
numerous contacts.

Before you fumble for an atlas, Bulgaria is located north of
Greece, west of
Turkey, south of Romania and east of Yugoslavia (but no wars
here). It has a
lovely coastline on the Black Sea. It has spectacular moutains. It
has a
communist past, for those interested in politics. It has a much
older and more
forgotten past dating to 6,000 BC. It has played a significant
though little
studied part in all civilization, including if not especially
Western Civ.
It has a fascinating culture, varied geography and unique place in
history.
It has a stable political situation with no threat of armed violence.
It is seeking cooperation with the Western world in many ways. It
has an
unstable economy but that serves you well as it makes dollars and
other hard
currency *very* attractive and very strong. Stronger every day.

There are many tourism possibilities here, from conventional
vacations at
seaside resorts to truly wilderness excursions to cultural and
academic trips.
In the first instance, I cannot sugar-coat the resorts: this is
not Club Med,
though Club Med does own a resort very near where I work and sends
thousands of
French tourists here every year. Bulgarian resorts are nice but a
little dated
in their accoutrements. If you want the Hyatt, don't come here.
But if you want
to see someplace truly interesting on many levels -- and on the
cheap --
book your flights now. As far as other options, these become ever more
attractive as those interested in somewhat more adventurous
tourism are less
likely to mind missing a few stars in the rating. Some ideas for
which I have
*real* contacts ready to do business:<P>

-- archeological tours. the oldest necropolis in the world (I am
told) is
within a 20-minute drive from my office; there are Turkish, Roman,
Thracian
and older ruins dating to civilizations the layperson does not
understand.
there are expert academics waiting to show off their treasures.<BR>
-- wilderness trips. from canoe trips (on fairly placid rivers
through grand
gorges, past castles and amongst charming villages) to hunting
trips (gun, bow
and photo) to survival camps, there are excellently trained people
here calling
me weekly to find out what we can arrange. make a suggestion and
we can find
a way.<BR>
-- cultural tourism. this country is officially more than 1,300
years old.<P>
Though there are aspects of life here that are frustrating, there
are also
things to see and learn. fascinating details stemming from
700-plus years of
occupation (Bulgarians shake their heads for "yes" because the
Muslim Ottoman
Turks used to question the Bulgarians' faith by asking if they
were Christian
while holding a sabre pointed up beneath their chins; nodding
"yes" was not
a survival strategy) make this a trove of discoveries of which
Westerners
know little. if you like, we can send you off the beaten path to
villages
and hamlets where the way of life hasn't changed in hundreds of years,
despite numerous conquerors.<P>

I could go on and I will if you like but I am pushing both space
limits and
your attention spans. Suffice to say if you are interested in
something out
of the ordinary that will teach you more than you imagined and at
little
real cost, this is an excellent opportunity. And not as blind a
lead as it
might sound because I will do what I can to guarantee these
arrangements are
all safe, legitimate and worthwhile. I am trying to help development;
my carelessness for a moment could undo years of work and I know that.<P>

Curious about any of the above? Feel free to write early and often.<P>

Thanks for your patience,<BR>

Since 1990, I have been working as Academic Officer at the 
United Nations University headquarters in Tokyo, Japan. I am 
in charge of planning and management of the University's 
esearch and training programme in the field of environment.
One of UNU's major projects in this field is 'Mountain Ecology
and Sustainable Development,' implemented jointly with the
International Mountain Society (IMS) since 1978.  More 
information on this, as well as other UNU initiatives in 
environmental fields, can be found on our homepage.<P>

A native of Finland, I received my B.Sc. (1981) and M.Sc. (1982) 
in Geography from the University of Helsinki, and my Ph.D.
from the Department of Social and Economic Geography at the
University of Lund in Sweden (1989). From 1984 to 1987
I worked at the International Fund for Agricultural Development
(IFAD) and after that at the Scandinavian Institute of African
Studies. I've also acted as a consultant to Scandinavian aid
agencies, as well as IFAD, working in Zambia, Kenya and Nepal.<P>

My recent publications include:<P>

'The Salween River: Is International Development Possible?"
 Asia Pacific Viewpoint, Vol. 37, No. 3, 271-284 (1996)
 [co-authored with Glen Paoletto]<P>

Here's a few words about myself.<P>

I am currently asst. prof. ('adjunkt') at the Department of 
Ethnography and Social Anthropology at Aarhus University in Denmark. 
A Dutch citizen, I received my Ph.D. this spring from Cornell 
University for a dissertation on contemporary Ladakhi politics and 
development entitled 'Identity Fetishism and the Art of 
Representation'.<P>

Since 1985 I have been engaged in research and have worked with NGOs 
in the Ladakh region of Jammu and Kashmir in the Western Himalaya. My 
current research interests continue to focus on issues related to 
social and economic change, 'sustainable development', and the 
politics of identity in Ladakh and the wider Himalayan region.<P>

More specifically, I am interested in the implications of the 
changing location of Ladakh (as locally and externally perceived, 
through infrastructural and 'virtual' linking, positioning, and 
embedding) for processes and practices of development and livelihoods in 
general, and local and extra-local responses to and involvement in such 
changes (e.g. through politics, representation, formulations of 
demands and strategies, etc.).<P>

I strive to combine my academic pursuits with more immediately 
engaged and policy-oriented practices, generally of a less formal 
nature.<P>

I look forward to participating in discussions and activities related 
to the Mountain Forum.<P>

I was born in Taiwan but have been living in the U.S. for 16 years.  I
am just finishing up a master's program in Natural Resource Planning at
the University of Vermont.  Future plans may lead me to China to pursue
project implementation or grassroots work.  My favorite mountains (so 
far) are in the Sierra Nevada in California.<P>

Dear Mountain Forum Members,<P>

My name is Tom Warren. I am an American living in Norway, and I am the
director of the University of Oslo/University of Bergen's Mountain Research
Station at Finse in the central part of southern Norway. <P>

My interest in mountains began in the Appalachian Mountains of North
Carolina (USA) where I grew up, continued in the Rockies in western Montana
(USA) where I completed my B.Sc. in wildlife biology at the Univ. of
Montana, and is now focused primarily on the mountains of Northern Europe,
especially those here in Norway, where I've completed an M.Sc. and Ph.D. in
terrestrial ecology and zoology, respectively.<P>

Much of my work/interest is in the area of resource management, which of
course includes many human dimensions. I've worked mostly on predation on
livestock by large carnivores (in Norway that means brown bear, wolverine,
wolf and lynx), as well as conflicts between wild reindeer hunters/managers
and sheep grazing interests in the mountains of southern Norway. As the
director of the mountain research station, I am fortunate to live and work
for long periods above the treeline (which in Norway at 60 degrees N is
"only" 1000-1200 a.s.l.).<P>

I look forward to participating in the Mountain Forum.<P>

Hi,<P>
I'm a PhD student at the Energy and Resources Group, UC Berkeley. I'm
interested in natural resource management and meeting rural energy
needs in mountainous areas, particularly in Tibetan areas of the PRC.
I'm interested in finding out what the current debates are; and also
just getting  a better grasp on who is doing what work, where (since
this is all kind of new to me) <BR>
