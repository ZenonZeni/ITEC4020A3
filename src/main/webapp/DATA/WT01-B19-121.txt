<br>
Patients Out of Time is pleased to announce that the American
Nurses Association (ANA), has taken action towards recognizing
the right of patients to use CANNABIS as medicine. Access to
theraputic CANNABIS is already endorsed by numerous professional
health care organizations.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The American Nurses Association, The United
States member of the International Council of Nurse, has informed
the Virginia Nurses Association that a position paper submitted
by the Virginia Nurses Association titled &quot;Theraputic Use of
Cannabis&quot; has been favorably reviewed by the ANA's Congress
of Nursing Practice.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The theraputic CANNABIS resolution which was
followed by a position paper were initiated by Mary Lynn Mathre
RN, MSN, Carn the senoir nurse consultant for addictions
treatment services at the University of Virginia's Medical Center
in Charlottesville. &quot;The position paper on theraputic CANABIS&quot;
was submitted to the ANA from a patient advocacy position, which
is a primary function of the nursing profession. Once made aware
of the theraputic potential of CANNABIS and it's relative safety,
Nurses readily support the right of Patients to access this medicine&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="4">The twofold motion adopted by the Congress of
Nursing Practice calls for the education of all RN's regarding
current evidence based on theraputic uses of CANNABIS; and the
investigation of the theraputic efficacy of CANNABIS in controlled
trials. Mathre added that this is a defacto statement by the ANA
that marijuana has medical value; a way of showing support for
similar resolutions passed by other US health care organizations;
and should be recognized by the US government as a polite way of
calling the denial of marijuana as medicine for the sick and dieing
as illogical. With one out of every 40 registered voters a nurse
we should expect the politicians might pay close attention to
what the Nurses of America are demanding.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The State nursing association of Virginia,
Mississipi, Colorado, New York, and California as well as the
American Public Health Association, the National Nurses Society
on Addictions and some two dozen other groups have all voiced
their demand for the administration of theraputic cannabis to be
allowed by primary care providers rather than denied to the sick
by prosecuters and their laws. Patients Out of Time, a nonprofit organization
comprised of five of the eight legal marijuana patients and experts
in the theraputic Cannabis field, either crafted or was a consultant
to these organizations.</font></p>
