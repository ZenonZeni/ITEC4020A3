<H3><CENTER>Analysis of S.1726, the &quot;Promotion of Electronic Commerce
<BR>
in the Digital Era (Pro-CODE) Act of 1996&quot;</CENTER>
</H3>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=+1><B>Summary.</FONT></B>  S.1726, the encryption bill authored
by Senator Conrad Burns (R-MT) and others, offers the electronic commerce counterpoint
to S. 1587, the pro-privacy encryption bill offered earlier this session
by Senator Burns, Senator Patrick Leahy (D-VT), and others. 
<p>
S.1726 would:
<UL>
<LI>Relax current export controls by lifting restrictions on all encryption
hardware and software, regardless of key length, that is &quot;generally
available&quot; or in the public domain in the United States. Hardware and
software not available in the mass market or public domain would fall under
an export scheme that would currently allow up to roughly DES-strength (i.e.,
56-bit key length) security.<P>
<LI>Give the Commerce Department exclusive jurisdiction over encryption
exports, rather than the State Department.<P>
<LI>Affirm domestic use and sale of encryption and explicitly prohibits
mandatory key escrow.<P>
<LI>Prohibit Commerce Department standard-setting activities on encryption.<P>
<LI>Present broad new Congressional finding on the negative impact of current
encryption regulations on electronic commerce.
</UL>
The bill does not contain any of the key holder standards found in S.1587,
or the criminal provisions found in S.1587 and its House counterpart H.R.
3011. Taken together, the provisions of S.1726 are designed to make strong
encryption products more widely available and remove many of the competitive
barriers facing U.S. industry and individuals.<BR>
<BR>
<HR WIDTH=50%>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=+1><STRONG>Major provisions.</FONT></STRONG> The &quot;Promotion
of Commerce On-Line in the Digital Era (Pro-CODE) Act of 1996&quot; would
substantially change current encryption controls in the areas of export
controls, domestic use and distribution, and Commerce Department standard-setting.<BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Export Controls:  </STRONG><BR>
<BR>
	Under the Arms Control Export Act and subsequent ITAR regulations, encryption
products and technology are classified as &quot;munitions&quot; subject
to a complex export licensing scheme involving the State Department and
Commerce Department. Currently, products with encryption keys over 40 bits
long -- a level of security increasingly viewed as inadequate for many uses
-- generally cannot be exported. The Administration has used these regulations
to support policies whereby moderately stronger systems could be exported
if they guarantee government access to encryption keys through government
or third-party key escrow systems. Moreover, due to the need for international
interoperability and the difficulty of creating domestic and international
product lines, the export controls have had the effect of preventing the
widespread availability of strong encryption products within the United
States.<BR>
<BR>
S. 1726 would relax these export controls:
<UL>
<LI>Any encryption software, or hardware incorporating such software, that
is &quot;generally available, as is, and designed for installation by the
user or purchaser,&quot; or that is &quot;in the public domain,&quot; would
be exportable, regardless of key lengths. &quot;Generally available&quot;
software includes encryption software distributed over the Internet, widely
offered for sale or transfer in the U.S. (including software disseminated
as shareware or freeware), or preloaded on computer hardware. The government
would retain the ability to regulate encryption under the more narrow national
security standards of the Trading With The Enemy Act or International Emergency
Economic Powers Acts. <BR>
<BR>
The category of freely exportable encryption products appears to cover a
broad class of hardware and software. Many of the popular web browsers,
PGP, or encryption in other widely available software would all be exportable
with unlimited key lengths once made publicly available in the U.S. The
basic premise appears to be: If encryption is available in your local software
store, via mail order catalogs, or widely distributed over the Net, then
it should be freely exportable.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>Other encryption hardware and software products would be exportable
under license to countries &quot;in which exports of computer software of
similar capability are permitted for use by financial institutions ... not
... controlled in fact by U.S. persons.&quot; Currently,  this scheme makes
non-mass market hardware and software exportable with up to roughly DES-strength
(i.e., 56-bit key length) security. (This represents a minor change from
S.1587, which had the same standard for software but permitted export of
non-mass-market hardware if products of similar security were commercially
available abroad.)<BR>
<BR>
The Secretary of Commerce would be empowered to deny such exports where
there is &quot;substantial evidence&quot; that the products in question
would be &quot;diverted to a military end-use&quot; or &quot;modified for
military or terrorist end-use.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<LI>The Department of Commerce would receive exclusive jurisdiction over
export controls for encryption hardware, software, and technology, except
such encryption technology that is specifically designed or modified for
military use.
</UL>
<STRONG>Domestic Use and Sale of Encryption:</STRONG><BR>
<BR>
No restrictions on sale or distribution of encryption in interstate commerce - 
S.1726 would prohibit the Federal government, or any State, from restricting
or regulating the sale of encryption products in interstate commerce.<BR>
<BR>
Prohibits mandatory key escrow - the bill would also prohibit the Federal
government, or any State, from imposing any key disclosure requirements
as a condition of sale in interstate commerce.<BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Commerce Department Standards Activities:</STRONG><BR>
<BR>
The bill restricts Commerce Department standard-setting activities on encryption.
 The Department, through the National Institute of Standards or otherwise,
may not &quot;promulgate, or enforce regulations, or otherwise adopt standards
or carry out policies that result in encryption standards for use by businesses
or entities other than Federal computer systems.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The Commerce Department would also be prohibited from promulgating regulations
that impose government-designed encryption standards on the private sector
by restricting exports.<BR>
<BR>
<HR>
<H3><CENTER>Comparison of S.1726 with S.1587 (the Leahy-Burns encryption
bill) and H.R. 3011.  </CENTER>
</H3>
<BR>
S.1726, the Pro-CODE, provides the electronic commerce equivalent to S.1587,
the pro-privacy encryption bill introduced by Senator Leahy, Burns, Dole,
Pressler and Murray two months ago, and S.1587's House counterpart, H.R.
3011, introduced by Rep. Goodlatte and others.  Pro-CODE would relax export
controls in a roughly similar way, but contains none of the key holder provisions,
and no new crime for using encryption to obstruct justice. Where S.1587
is more narrowly applicable to only wire or electronic communications, S.1726
applies to encryption of both communications and other information such
as stored files. Pro-CODE also contains a new provision to prohibit the
Commerce Department from imposing encryption standards.<BR>
<BR>
Major areas for comparison include:<BR>
<UL>
<LI>Encryption of stored information: The definition of encryption in S.1587
applies only to &quot;wire and electronic communications,&quot; while S.1726
includes &quot;wire and electronic communications and information.&quot;
S.1726 would thus appear to protect encryption hardware and software for
non-communicated information, such as encryption of locally stored files
or disk media.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>Export provisions: S.1587 and H.R.3011 have very similar export provisions
to S.1726.  In all three, software and hardware that is &quot;generally
available, as is, and designed for installation by the user or purchaser,&quot;
or that is &quot;in the public domain,&quot; would be exportable, regardless
of key lengths. Other encryption hardware and software would be exportable
using the &quot;currently exportable to  foreign financial institutions&quot;
standard (i.e.,  roughly DES strength; see explanation above) under S.1726.
The same standard is used for other software in S.1587 and H.R. 3011, but
hardware is subject to a more liberal test of what is already &quot;commercially
available&quot; abroad.  <BR>
<BR>
<LI>Key holder provisions:  S.1726 and H.R. 3011 contain none of the extensive
provisions in S.1587 regarding the responsibilities of third-party encryption
key holders, or standards for release of keys to law enforcement.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>Use of encryption to obstruct justice: S.1726 does not contain the provision
found in S.1587 and H.R.3011 that would criminalize the use of encryption
to obstruct communications from law enforcement officials in furtherance
of a felony.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>Personal use exemption: S.1726 does not contain the broader personal
use exemption for U.S. users of encryption traveling abroad, found in S.1587.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>Commerce Department Standards activities: S.1726 prohibits any actions
by the Commerce Department that have the effect of imposing government designed
encryption standards. S.1587 has no analogous provision.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>New findings: S.1726 contains a broad new set of findings emphasizing
the importance of encryption to the development of electronic commerce.<BR>
