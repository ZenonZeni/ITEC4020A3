Fed seen raising rate by -1/4-point

from BUSINESS TIMES (Singapore Press Holdings Ltd), 23 Sep 96

By Leon Hadar in Washington

But some expect rate rise only after presidential polls

THE consensus among Fed watchers is that policymakers at the US central bank
will decide when they meet tomorrow to raise the federal fund rate, now 5.25
per cent, by a quarter point.

If this happens, it would be the first increase in 19 months.

Economic data issued on Thursday that showed stronger-than-expected housing
starts and shrinking claims on jobless benefits bolstered arguments that the
Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) would boost interest rates to keep the
economy from overheating.

Some experts, however, think the Fed may refrain from raising rates during a
presidential election campaign. They think the FOMC may instead decide on a
half-point rate hike at its next meeting, which will be after the November
poll.

Those who expect an immediate increase in the federal fund rate, which is what
banks charge each other for overnight funds, note that a majority of the 12
Federal Reserve district banks are now reportedly in favour of a quarter-point
hike.

There are signs that some of the inflation doves in the Fed, including
Governor Janet Yellin, are now concerned about the growing signs of inflation
and support a tighter monetary policy.

The FOMC consists of the six governors of the Federal Reserve and the 12
regional bank presidents.

Wall Street has been perplexed by the mixed messages in recent days about the
economy, with stock and bond prices falling at signs of inflation (and a
possible rate hike) and then rising as threats of inflation (and a rate
increase) seemed to dissipate.

Lowest take-up for new homes in eastern S'pore

from BUSINESS TIMES (Singapore Press Holdings Ltd), 23 Sep 96

By Michelle Low and Agnes Wee

Leasehold status, prices said to be among reasons for highest proportion of
unsold units

[SINGAPORE] The Geylang and East Coast areas have the highest proportion of
unsold new apartments, a BT survey shows.

And for new houses, the lowest take-up rates are in the Kew Drive area in
Bedok. BT looked at private housing projects of at least 50 units now under
construction and which are not yet fully sold. Data was divided into
sub-regions according to postal districts.

Geylang has the highest percentage -42 per cent -of unsold new apartments.
Next comes the East Coast (28 per cent).

In contrast, only 2 per cent of new apartments are still unsold in Pasir Ris.
In the Orchard/Bukit Timah area, 12 per cent are unsold, and in Upper Bukit
Timah, 13 per cent.

Market watchers offered several reasons for the varying take-up rates.

Geylang, for instance, was only recently turned into a residential corridor
with a series of new launches last year, and still suffers somewhat from its
reputation as Singapore's red-light district.

But location and pedigree are not the only reasons why people buy property.

The East Coast is a well-established residential district and yet 28 per cent
of the 2,949 newly-marketed apartments there have not found buyers.

Said one consultant: "The East Coast already has a high concentration of
freehold private housing estates and the new ones are mostly leasehold, which
may be less popular."

Also, prices of new leasehold East Coast projects are typically a shade higher
than equivalent freehold Upper Bukit Timah properties.

The Bukit Timah stretch (districts 11, 21 and 23) has seen a flurry of new
launches over the past year, and these projects generally saw strong take-up.
About 400 new units are still on the market.

But supply in this sector is growing -1,300 new condominium units being built
by Far East and City Developments in Bukit Batok (district 23) have just come
on the market.

In landed properties, projects in familiar landed territory (like Serangoon)
fared well, while those in new areas (like Kew Drive and Jurong West) sold
slowly.

In the East Coast area, more than half of the houses in three Kew Drive
projects have not been sold. Consultants say, though, that buyers' resistance
to these 99-year lease houses, launched last year, is slowly wearing down.

Far East still has 18 of its 31 Kew Gate units and 20 of 37 Kew Residencia
houses to sell. Nearby, CityDev has yet to sell 46 of its 76 Villas at Kew
units.

In district 22 (Jurong West), United Overseas Land still has 98 houses up for
sale in Westwood Park after phase one (170 units) was launched about a year
ago.

In the prime Holland Road area, a third of Far East's 113 Holland Grove
(99-year lease) are unsold.

The biggest developer, Far East, has not yet sold 27 per cent of its new
houses and 29 per cent of its apartment or condo units unsold.

Far East is by far the biggest supplier to Singapore's private housing market,
marketing thousands of new units every year. Recent projects which are now
fully sold include the Kew Vale houses and Westcove condos. Another big-league
developer, CityDev, has 21 per cent of its condos and 60 per cent of its new
houses still unsold. Earlier this year, the Kwek-controlled company sold out
its 928-unit Signature Park.

DBS Land, meanwhile, still has 30 per cent of its condos on the market. It has
sold out Casuarina Cove in Tanjong Rhu and the 159-unit Richmond Park near
Orchard Road.

Chavalit, Amnuay ahead in race for new Thai PM

from BUSINESS TIMES (Singapore Press Holdings Ltd), 23 Sep 96

By Loh Hui Yin in Bangkok

Markets likely to be cautious until outlook becomes clearer

THE Thai government's six coalition partners are in intense behind-the-scene
manoeuvring following Prime Minister Banharn Silpa-archa's resignation and
ahead of a meeting tomorrow.

Mr Banharn's Chart Thai Party, with 92 seats in parliament, remains the core
of the coalition and its Members of Parliament have indicated they want a say
in who becomes the next premier.

Mr Banharn, who is being blamed for Thailand's economic slowdown, has said the
next prime minister must be competent in economic affairs.

The two front-runners are Chavalit Yongchaiyudh, leader of the New Aspiration
Party, and Amnuay Virawan who heads the Nam Thai Party. Both men are deputy
prime ministers in the current cabinet.

Dr Amnuay, formerly a respected bureaucrat, finds more favour with the
business community. He was executive chairman of Thailand's largest bank,
Bangkok Bank, from 1983-1992.

While Dr Amnuay might be preferred by the business community, his Nam Thai
Party has only 18 seats in parliament and this would make it difficult for him
to govern.

General Chavalit, a former army chief who quit to join politics, has been
bolstering his political base with the just-announced military reshuffle. He
has been promoting big commercial projects, like a new bank, for the military.

Mr Banharn announced on Saturday he would resign in seven days' time. But it
is not clear if Mr Banharn will take any position in the new cabinet.

His departure will be greeted with relief by the business and financial
community, but the financial markets are likely to be cautious until the
political outlook becomes clearer in the next few days.

Photipong Lamsam, chairman of the Board of Trade, said the new cabinet should
be formed quickly because the prolonged political problems have affected
business.

Mr Banharn's hand was forced on Saturday morning when New Aspiration Party,
Nam Thai Party and Muanchon Party banded together and threatened to vote
against him on the no-confidence motion if he did not agree to quit before the
vote.

During the blistering three-day censure debate, Mr Banharn was accused by the
opposition of economic mismanagement and corruption.

An upset Mr Banharn, whose 14 months as prime minister has been stormy, said:
"I have been very tired after working for slightly over one year. I am proud
of what my government has done so far."

Thailand's exports have slumped this year and economic growth is at its lowest
in a decade. Speculation is rife that the Thai baht will be devalued to
stimulate exports, and the currency has been under attack with Thai stocks
sinking to three-year lows.

Top Asian groups to join US$200m Yangon project / Wharf Holdings, Jardine
Matheson Holdings, Salim Group, Pidemco Land,

from BUSINESS TIMES (Singapore Press Holdings Ltd), 23 Sep 96

By Loh Hui Yin in Bangkok

Jardine, Salim and Wharf to take stakes in industrial project promoted by
S'pore

THREE of Asia's biggest conglomerates are joining a Singapore-promoted US$200
million (S$280 million) industrial development project in Myanmar.

They are Wharf Holdings and Jardine Matheson Holdings of Hongkong; and the
Salim group of Indonesia.

Singapore's Pidemco Land will also become a shareholder of Sinmardev
International which is promoting the project.

Sinmardev International's original shareholders are architect-businessman
Albert Hong and his firm, RSP Architects, Planners and Engineers, and building
materials producer PD International of Singapore.

The project calls for the development of a 12 square kilometre industrial park
and a port for bulk cargo on the outskirts of Yangon. It is a much scaled-down
proposal from the ambitious $4 billion township that Sinmardev mapped out two
years ago.

The Myanmar government, which has a 40 per cent stake in the project, will
provide land in Thanlyin-Kyauktan, about 18 km south-east of Yangon. The bulk
terminal will be located in Thilawa where another Singapore firm, C&P
Holdings, has been given permission to build and operate container berths.
Thilawa is 16km inland from the Yangon river.

Having the three big business groups, which are likely to be minor
shareholders, will help Sinmardev market the project to potential investors.

A Singapore businessman active in Myanmar said the three big groups are most
likely using the Sinmardev project as a testing ground for future investments.
He added that Singapore-backed projects are held in good esteem by the Myanmar
authorities.

Singapore's Pidemco is not new to Myanmar as it is building a hotel there. The
Port of Singapore Authority is also exploring an investment in a Thai-backed
township project in Yangon.

Ex-head of derivatives trading at Barings to sue

from BUSINESS TIMES (Singapore Press Holdings Ltd), 23 Sep 96

By Neil Behrmann

LONDON

He claims FT, authors of new book have defamed him

RON BAKER, former head of derivatives trading at Barings, is suing the
Financial Times and authors of a new book on the collapse of the bank.

Mr Baker has featured in alleged transcripts of taped telephone conversations
at Barings. They were obtained by FT reporters John Gapper and Nicholas Denton
and have been published in the newspaper's serialisation of their book, All
That Glitters.

Mr Baker, who was in charge of Nick Leeson when the rogue trader brought down
the bank, has been trying to clear his name for some time. He contends that
the serialisation and book to be published today have defamed him by quoting
conversations out of context.

Moreover, he claimed the FT has prejudiced a forthcoming hearing before the
Securities and Futures Authority. Several months ago, Mr Baker sought a
hearing before an SFA tribunal to defend himself and reverse a proposed
three-year ban and [pound]10,000 (S$22,000) fine.

"The implication of what is said in the Financial Times is that I somehow
contributed to the collapse of the bank and this is untrue," Mr Baker told BT.
"The cause of the collapse was a fraud in the segregated client accounts of
Barings' agency broking business; it had nothing to do with house trading
which I ran in 1994."

Mr Baker added that he became head of the derivatives desk at the beginning of
January 1995, less than two months before the bank collapsed.

"Nothing in the SFA allegation against me relates to the collapse of Barings,"
Mr Baker said. He added that by the time he was made Leeson's manager, the
trader's fraud was well advanced and Barings' losses ran into millions of
pounds.

"The publishing of taped telephone conversations in its own right does not
bother me, although they are a dangerous medium for establishing the facts
upon which to draw conclusions," Mr Baker said. "Isolated telephone
conversations do not provide the full story (my telephone wasn't taped) and
they give no context."

"However, in this case, they have cut and pasted a number of different
conversations, omitting large areas, in a manner which creates a picture
totally at odds with the facts."

The FT will be defending the case because it believes that the book has strong
evidence.

All set for invasion of Normandy / Microsoft Corporation

from BUSINESS TIMES (Singapore Press Holdings Ltd), 23 Sep 96

By Toh Han Shih

BusinessIT

Microsoft plans landing of its first Internet platform in the Asia-Pacific

[SINGAPORE] Microsoft is planning to invade the Internet of entire nations in
the Asia-Pacific with Normandy, its Internet platform with capabilities in
Internet commerce and the Intranet.

Normandy is Microsoft's first platform for commercial Internet services
specifically designed for Internet service providers (ISPs), network operators
and Internet content providers. It has several servers including Merchant
Server, Microsoft's Internet commerce server that allows customers to set up
Internet malls; tools to build Intranets; and security features for Internet
commerce.

"The Internet war is not over browsers because both companies (Microsoft and
Netscape) are giving away browsers (free). The war is over Internet servers.
It is the servers that makes money for these companies," said Ray Chang, chief
executive officer of AsiaConnect, Malaysia's largest provider of Internet
sites. AsiaConnect is Asean's first Normandy user.

Analysts predict that Intranets will generate many times more revenue than the
Internet. Mr Chang said Normandy would be one of the platforms for a broad
bandwidth Intranet consisting of fibre optic cables and microwave networks
that will cover the whole of Malaysia in two years.

Though Netscape now dominates the Internet server market, Mr Chang predicted:
"A fairly large portion of Malaysian Web sites will use Normandy. Normandy
will command a substantial market share worldwide rapidly."

He said this is because the money Microsoft is putting into research and
marketing, running into billions of dollars and exceeding Netscape's turnover,
is "mind-blowing".

Chinese organisations, Indosat (Indonesia's only international
telecommunications company), NTT (Japan's national telecommunications
carrier), Datamat (a Thai ISP), Singnet and Singapore Cablevision are
evaluating Normandy. Analysts believe NTT will take up to half of Japan's
Internet market in future.

SAP, one of the world's largest software firms, will integrate its enterprise
software with Merchant Server.

However, Mr Chang qualified: "I would not write off Netscape."

He noted the high quality of Netscape's Applications Foundry, a suite of
Intranet tools. AsiaConnect deploys both Netscape's servers and Normandy.

Ben Yeo, a deputy manager with Sembawang Media, pointed out that Normandy
works only with Microsoft NT. This means organisations running Unix servers
cannot use Normandy for their Internet applications. Mr Yeo said that as long
as Unix remains, Normandy cannot totally replace Netscape. Sembawang Media is
a Netscape distributor.

However, Microsoft network manager Chong Yoke Sim said: "With Normandy, it
will accelerate the adoption of NT, not only for corporations, but also ISPs."

Netscape regional manager Casey Ong said Normandy is not so open. He
explained: "Merchant Server works closely with ActiveX, which makes Windows an
indispensable component in the Internet. That rules out Internet appliances
which do not use Windows, and future versions of Windows will include Explorer
(Microsoft's Internet browser).

"Microsoft, in trying to promote Explorer, will make it such that there are
certain sites that Netscape Navigator cannot get into. The only access to
non-Microsoft databases like Oracle is through ODBC, which is not conducive to
massive exchange of information or mission-critical applications."

Ms Chong said future versions of eshop, an Internet commerce technology now
incorporated into Merchant Server, will be compatible with NT only, whereas in
the past eshop worked with Unix software and Silicon Graphics hardware.

Netscape's Mr Ong pointed out that computers not using Windows or NT, users
with Netscape browsers, and millions of future Internet appliances like
handphones and TV will not access Normandy easily. And AsiaConnect's Mr Chang
said Sun hardware cannot work with Normandy.

"For Internet commerce to take off at full speed, we need to embrace open
systems. Even if Netscape doesn't do well, there are third parties to build
applications, based on open standards," he said.

Internet malls are coming your way

from BUSINESS TIMES (Singapore Press Holdings Ltd), 23 Sep 96

BusinessIT

[SINGAPORE] It's been great to send and receive e-mail. It's been mind-blowing
to surf the ever-expanding world of the Internet. And soon, Singaporeans will
have a new cyber treat -- they will be able to shop at Internet malls.

These "malls" allow users to virtually inspect goods, shop, order goods, bank
and conduct financial transactions via the Internet.

Contact, a subsidiary of the Sembawang Group, and AsiaOne, a subsidiary of
Singapore Press Holdings (SPH), will set up the Internet malls early next
year. Both companies will set up infrastructure for the malls and from there,
their customers can set up as many shopping "precincts" as they want.

The concept is part of the Electronic Commerce Hotbed, a National Computer
Board initiative.

Contact general manager Gary Koh said last week: "We will have customers
running their malls by early next year. Some people have committed
themselves."

He declined to reveal who these Internet shopkeepers will be, but said most of
the organisations which expressed interest in the cyberspace malls are local
banks and local merchants. He added that Contact would have regional customers
setting up Internet malls soon.

There has been similar enthusiasm, too, for AsiaOne's Internet mall scheme.
Low Huan Ping, general manager of AsiaOne, said local parties had committed
themselves to setting up shop. It will also, in future, have stores from the

Contact's parent company, Sembawang Media, offers a service whereby customers

HP cautious over home PC push into Asia-Pacific market / Hewlett-Packard

from BUSINESS TIMES (Singapore Press Holdings Ltd), 23 Sep 96

By Jennifer Lien in Palo Alto

BusinessIT

Company V-P tells why it's better to be safe than sorry

US-BASED computer giant Hewlett-Packard is taking a cautious approach in
bringing its home PC product, the Pavilion, to the Asia-Pacific market, a
senior official said.

"Just because it's been successful in the US, it doesn't mean it will be
successful elsewhere," said vice-president Duane Zitzner, who heads HP's
worldwide personal information products group.

"We have to be very careful to balance that business with our return on
investment," he said.

He gave several reasons why the home PC space is difficult to compete in -poor
margins ("They're terrible. Sometimes they even go the other direction") and
the existence of "garage shops" or clone-makers which sell PCs at cut-throat
prices.

The product's launch in Asia has also been slowed by some "supply-chain
difficulties", director of South-east Asian sales and distribution Philip Chua
told a press conference in Singapore earlier this month.

Despite these difficulties, the home PC market is important for HP as a
springboard for HP's entry into other emerging home technologies, such as a
"home server" which manages household appliances and information -a product
about "a year away" from being launched, estimated Asia-Pacific marketing
manager Steve Haslett. Mr Zitzner said: "Being in the home market gives us
knowledge and understanding of the consumer and where that business might go."

HP also already has several other non-PC products in the home space, including
printers and calculators.

After a successful 1995 pre-Christmas launch in the US, HP decided to launch
the product in Europe and test the Asia-Pacific market, starting with
Australia and New Zealand. The countries were chosen for their similarity to
the US, said Mr Zitzner. Launched in April, the Pavilion has quickly moved to
become one of the top seven home PCs in those markets.

"We need to make sure the business model works well -supply chains, sales and
distribution model, retail channels. As we become more sophisticated with
that, then we'll look at expanding the market," said Mr Zitzner.

Singapore could see the launch of the Pavilion as early as the second quarter
of next year, according to Mr Chua.

Features customers can look forward to, based on HP's new October models,
include Pentium microprocessors of between 120 and 166 MhZ, 3D accelerated
video graphics, an 8X CD-ROM drive, pipeline burst cache and up to 2.5 GB hard
drive.

The products will also have a suite of imaging features as well as built-in
Internet access.

Eutech sets global sights with software consortium / Eutech Cybernetics

from BUSINESS TIMES (Singapore Press Holdings Ltd), 23 Sep 96

By Annette Pau

BusinessIT

[SINGAPORE] Home-grown Eutech Cybernetics has initiated an Asia-wide virtual
corporation that it hopes will vault the high-tech company into the ranks of
global IT players.

Hari Gunasingham, scientist-turned-entrepreneur and managing director of
Eutech Cybernetics, told BusinessIT in an interview: "We want to be the
standard for enterprise systems, the Windows 95 of the enterprise game."

Eutech Cybernetics is the main driving force in the formation of the
Eutech-Asia Software Consortium, which currently comprises six member
companies, including five publicly-listed Indian software companies. It hopes
to add other IT companies over time.

Eutech-Asia is a software consortium which aims to deliver IT products and
services aligned with business systems through an architectural model to set
new standards in the fast growing area of enterprise computing.

The consortium will be officially launched tomorrow, based on a Memorandum of
Understanding signed early this year. Members include Eutech Cybernetics,
Microland, Infosys Technologies, Macmet India, Ashok Leyland Information
Technologies, BFL Software.

"Today, the whole paradigm is about enterprise systems. People are
increasingly looking at corporate networks and systems, and as more corporate
Intranets are connected up, they will want new ways of doing business, new
business systems, new concepts. These are the areas that we as a consortium
want to tackle," Dr Gunasingham said.

Consortium director Arun Abraham explained how the consortium helps pool
resources: "Eutech provides the systems knowledge, management and marketing
infrastructure in Singapore, while our Indian counterparts have the technical
skills and expertise, and the human resource."

One of the central aims of the consortium is to create an architectural
standard for both IT and business systems. Eutech has in fact developed an
architecture as a framework for building enterprise systems and for delivering
both products and services to businesses. This, says Dr Gunasingham, is both
userand network-centric, allowing business objects to communicate with each
other using "intelligent agents".

It also seeks to join forces in R&D, focusing on wireless communications and
agent-based technology. Collective R&D spending so far has amounted to some
$15 million.

According to Dr Gunasingham, response to the consortium has been good. Many
regional companies have asked to join the consortium, and it intends to take
in more members to increase their pool of IT professionals to a lofty number
of 100,000 in the year 2000.

"We expect to grow faster than the current 70 per cent average growth of the
(Indian) members of the consortium," said Dr Gunasingham.

Eutech Cybernetics was founded in 1990, a spin-off from research scientists
from the local university. Staff has grown from five to 140 now.

Eutech's revenues for FY95 were some $11 million. In FY96, Dr Gunasingham
reckons modest revenues of $16 million. This is expected to double the
following year, with the launch of Catseye, described as the embodiment of
Eutech architecture.

Canon Singapore sales surge with whopping printer demand / Canon Singapore

from BUSINESS TIMES (Singapore Press Holdings Ltd), 23 Sep 96

BusinessIT

[SINGAPORE] Sales by Canon Singapore, which oversees the electronics
manufacturer's operations in Asia outside Japan, grew almost three times more
than projected, thanks to strong demand for its printers.

Canon Singapore last week posted a 35 per cent increase in sales to US$493.3
million (S$690 million) in the first half of this financial year from US$366.4
million in the same period last year. The steady growth of the office
automation industry and the introduction of a new range of printers are
believed to have contributed to this.

Actual sales have far surpassed the projected growth of 13 per cent, the
group's managing director, Mr Kohtaro Miyagi, said. "It is certainly a boost
for the group's operations, especially in the emerging Indian and Indo-China
markets," he added.

Sales of printers accounted for most of the increase in sales, with a 118 per
cent jump in demand for Laser Beam printers. Bubble Jet printers also
registered a 20 per cent increase, with brisk sales of low-cost-high-output
models such as the BJC-610 and the BJC-210.

Calculators also sold well, with a 56 per cent growth in sales due to an
expanded range of products. Sales of facsimile machines and cameras increased
by 9 per cent and 0.9 per cent respectively.

Parent company Canon Inc also did well, recording a 89.2 per cent increase in
consolidated net income in the first half, compared with a 20.7 per cent rise
in net sales in the same period last year. Canon Singapore's results were the
foremost contributor to this increase. Projected consolidated net income and
net sales for Canon Inc this year are US$727 million and US$22.7 billion
respectively.

Hopes of Windows NT surge overstated : Analyst

from BUSINESS TIMES (Singapore Press Holdings Ltd), 23 Sep 96

By Kenneth James

BusinessIT

But Smith Barney's Bosak still sees 18 to 20 per cent PC growth

[SINGAPORE] For months analysts have been predicting that the launch of
Microsoft's Windows NT 4.0 operating system will light a fire under the
personal computer industry.

Won't happen, says Smith Barney Inc's computer research chief Barry Bosak.

But Mr Bosak, managing director of the New York securities major's research
division, adds that PC growth should still hit a respectable 18-20 per cent
this year. "Business isn't bad," the veteran analyst says. "Demand, especially
corporate demand, is steady."

Mr Bosak, a former head of the Computer Industry Analysts group in the US,
tracks computer and related stocks for Smith Barney, the second-largest
securities firm in the US. Speaking to BusinessIT last week, he gave his
perspective of the state of the industry.

The softening in the PC and related industries is because "too much electronic
capacity has been put on line", he says. Part of the reason has been the
doubleor triple-ordering of components and peripherals by PC makers, and
resultant cancellations.

Add to that an overhang of PC supply from last year. He cites a finding by
research group Dataquest that as much as six million PCs were made in excess
of demand last year. That will have to be cleared this Christmas quarter.
Still, he doesn't expect a repeat of last year's December quarter which was
characterised by "whimsical purchases by consumers who had a lot of money".

But demand in both corporate and consumer markets is healthy, Mr Bosak
emphasises. Only don't expect last week's launch of Windows NT 4.0 to spark
off a resurgence in PC sales. That's "overstating the case" and there will be
"no big wave" of NT-induced buying, he says. "I don't think corporations are
running out to buy Pentium and Pentium Pro PCs."

He explains that corporations are "more methodical" in their computer
purchases now. And they have had plenty of time to build up their PC armoury
in anticipation of a switch to Windows 95 and Windows NT.

He cites the case of a large financial institution that has been buying
Pentiums and Pentium Pros steadily since March. "It's not something that's
happening all at once."

So who are the likely winners and losers among computer stocks? For a start,
Mr Bosak zeroes in on a largely unheralded group: data storage providers.

He offers this insight on the changing nature of computing: "I don't think
computing is about computing, it's about information, either getting it or
sending it."

So storage companies will be engines of the new information age. Which is why
countries like Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand, which succeeded in attracting
the major players, "are going to feel very fortunate".

His pick of the winners in this category: EMC Corp in high-end disk arrays;
Seagate, IBM and Western Digital in disk drives.

Among PC companies, he is upbeat about beleaguered Apple Computer. "They are
doing the right things to shore up the company, and they have some exciting
machines coming out," he says. Apple rates a "buy, with speculative risk" in
his book. But leader Compaq is an "underperform, high risk" stock: "High
margins gone; near term bounce over," he says.

In networking, "Cisco is doing a phenomenal job" while Sun "has a lot of
potential". And the star of stars? Analysts mention HP, Sun, Microsoft, Intel,
he notes "but IBM probably makes it to the top of the list". The computer
giant is sitting on a US$7 billion cash hoard and "cash might be king in a
technology stock correction".

Also, its various divisions are in good shape, with mainframe sales "steady",
storage manufacturing "growing very nicely" and its US$15 billion PC business
"finally looking like a contender".

What could go wrong? Mr Bosak, who's seen it all after 30 years in the
business, admits to a "greatest fear": recession.

Indeed the official line at Smith Barney is that "the slowdown (of the US
economy) is coming, it's just taking its sweet time".

The securities house expects real GDP growth to slow to 2.6 per cent in the
second half of this year, down from the 3.4 per cent of the first half; and to
decelerate further to between 1.0 and 1.5 per cent in the first half of next
year.

But if the slowdown tailspins into a recession, then all bets are off.

Internet takes centre stage at trade show: Novell unveils new products and
strategies at Networld

from BUSINESS TIMES (Singapore Press Holdings Ltd), 23 Sep 96

By David Welcher in Atlanta

BusinessIT

THE most recent major networking trade show, Networld+Interop, has just ended
here, with more than 60,000 participants seeking definitive networking
solutions from over 600 vendors, but largely finding them elusive.

Grown from an extremely modest event in 1986, when only 300 people attended,
it today represents a must-visit constellation in the galaxy of networking
events. Not surprising, then, that Novell chose this venue to introduce
IntranetWare, the latest, Internet-empowered version of NetWare.

IBM, showcasing its server families, anti-virus tools, and Internet abilities,
was also there, as was Lotus, promoting the new, Internet-capable Notes
Version 4.5. Microsoft, despite a highly publicised challenge from Novell
about whose network directory services were superior, essentially ignored the
Utah contingent and continued to promote Windows NT as the ideal network
server.

Industry professionals could also take a guided tour of the InteropNet, a
state-of-the-art network which tied together all exhibitors at the show.
Featuring ATM, FDDI, Fast Ethernet and the latest in diagnostic and monitoring
tools, it provided an operating, production-scale demonstration of the
industry's latest advances.

InteropNet runs TCP/IP, IPX and AppleTalk, uses twisted-pair copper, fiber
optic cable, and wireless connections, and contains nearly 200 km of cabling
to connect the show's 6,000 on-line devices.

Although it could safely be stated that the future of networking technology
was clearly represented on the show floor, choosing the winner of that
sweepstakes was not quite that simple. In fact, although the usual candidates
competed for attention and claimed superiority, it remained for the visiting
professional to determine the questions at the show, and resolve the answers
carefully over time.

In the broadband arena, there was no clearly superior solution. While numerous
vendors proclaimed that ATM and Frame Relay were available now, and costly
FDDI (fibre) begged for continuing attention, most professionals seemed to be
taking the cautious track. Many continued to look towards the proposed
1-gigabit Ethernet standard, perhaps because it does not seem to require such
a radical change in direction. The Novell caveat -that the best solution is
one that leverages existing technology without requiring that everything be
replaced -appeared to be right on the mark.

With relatively little truly new in the hardware arena, software took centre
stage, prominently featuring the Internet. The commercial future of the
Internet, hampered by security concerns, remains some distance down the road.
But corporate networks, featuring smooth integration of Internet access, are
readily available now, especially in the GroupWare and e-mail categories from
Lotus, Microsoft and Novell.

While professionals struggled to determine the best solutions to network
planning problems with global impact, and vendors invested millions in trying
to promote their message, a few unusual items stood out from the crowd; not
because of their gravity, but rather because they were different.

One of the most fascinating is a log-in authentication system from National
Registry Inc (NRI), of Reston, Virginia. Combining NRI's imaging software with
fingerprint recognition touchpads, NRIdentity Scanners come in two models, a
mouse-like pad which connects to a Enhanced Capabilities Parallel (ECP) Port,
and one built into a keyboard.

Together, they provide any Windows-based computer system with a biometric
scanning and identification system to control computer access, by comparing a
user's scanned fingerprint to an image previously placed in a database.

Current pricing is about US$400 (S$560), still a bit costly, but down
significantly from the US$1,000-US$2,000 of a few years ago. The company
anticipates significant further price drops with volume production, said
Robert Leamy, vice-president, Product Development. More info is available on
the World Wide Web at http://www.nrid.com.

Those who missed the show and would like an opportunity to draw their own
conclusions about the industry's future, can visit local versions next year.
In Singapore, Networld+Interop is scheduled to run from April 7 to 11.

Novell unveils new products and strategies at Networld: Internet takes
centre stage at trade show / Novell

from BUSINESS TIMES (Singapore Press Holdings Ltd), 23 Sep 96

By David Welcher in Atlanta

BusinessIT

NOVELL Corporation, long seen by many industry observers as lacking a coherent
corporate marketing strategy, has apparently been listening to its critics. At
the just concluded Networld+Interop in Atlanta, Novell rolled out
IntranetWare, the latest iteration of its flagship NetWare product, and also
described a cohesive mission knitting together the strengths of its various
product groups.

Novell has been seen by many industry experts as marching to the wrong
drummer. This is because NetWare uses the IPX protocol, while most of the
industry, including the Internet, uses TCP/IP. In a move to correct this,
IntranetWare adds new services to Novell's NetWare 4.11 operating system to
provide a complete Intranet platform.

The defined mission, according to senior company officials, is to combine
NetWare, groupware, Internet browsing and Java development into a
comprehensive solution for providing corporations with Intranets.

As corporations seek to maximize the Internet's business potential, there is a
growing interest in Intranets, said William Donahoo, Novell's Director of
International Marketing. "Intranets are business networks used for corporate
information needs, which also utilise Internet technologies," he said.

IntranetWare provides both IP and IPX access to its Intranet resources, which
include Web servers and browsers, FTP servers, and Internet connections. The
arrangement provides a natural security firewall, Novell officials explained,
since unauthorised access from the Internet cannot penetrate the NetWare IPX
gateway to access corporate NetWare servers.

Novell's installed customer base includes 3.5 million servers and 55 million
users. The new strategy is intended to capitalise on its core networking
strengths, as well as leverage its 55 million-strong user base. The "glue"
intended to cement together this new corporate strategy is Novell Directory
Services (NDS), which is widely considered to be one of Novell's strongest
assets. NDS allows users to see other file servers as directories, and will
now be able to do the same for Internet sites.

Novell is not only targeting its own installed base, but is promoting NDS to
vendors of competing operating systems. "Other operating system vendors want
to use NDS," said Michael Simpson, Director of Novell's Internet
Infrastructure Division. "It is, in fact, intended to be OS portable. Only 9
per cent of the code is platform specific."

Novell expects to see considerable revenue from this new initiative, Mr
Simpson said.

Heading off the obvious question of whether NetWare's future was questionable,
Mr Simpson emphatically stated: "This is a new revenue potential, not a hedge
in case NetWare slips." SCO released an NDS-aware version last January, and
negotiations are under way with numerous others, he said.

The upgrade needs of Novell's existing customers have also been carefully
considered, said Denice Gibson, Novell senior vice-president, at
IntranetWare's formal rollout last Tuesday. "Customers are looking to
implement Internet solutions, and they need to seamlessly turn existing
technology into Intranets with minimum disruption and cost," she explained.
"They are not interested in a solution which requires them to rip out
everything they have."

"To both do this and give them best of breed technology, we are partnering
with other companies to provide this," she added.

Major partners who have signed on with Novell in the effort include Netscape,
whose browser will give NetWare users access to the Internet, and UUNet, which
has the network in place to deliver the necessary information.

Although all this comes too late for ex-CEO Robert Frankenberg, who resigned
in August, it seems to directly echo his previously stated vision of Novell's
future. Frankenberg's address at the November, 1995 Comdex, envisioned a
"Smart Global Network, incorporating NetWare, the Netscape browser, and Sun's
Java language as the core of a global data communications network."

IntranetWare will be available on Oct 7, and carries no increase in price from
previous versions. Limited time incentives are being offered to encourage
existing users to upgrade.

Summing up Novell's message that its customers need not look elsewhere for
answers, Ms Gibson concluded: "To our 55 million users, we say tonight: Look
at what you've got."

Microsoft NT 4.0, Workstation 4.0 hit the market

from BUSINESS TIMES (Singapore Press Holdings Ltd), 23 Sep 96

By Toh Han Shih

BusinessIT

[SINGAPORE] Amid analysts' predictions that Microsoft NT will gain market
share from Novell NetWare, Microsoft last week launched its latest software
server, the NT 4.0, as well as its client operating system, Workstation 4.0.

Microsoft is giving the NT 4.0 Internet and Intranet features, as is Novell
with its latest NetWare, as both try to outdo each other in the software
server market.

Microsoft back office manager Yong Yun Seong said NT 4.0 has Intranet
capability, in addition to the application's support, file and print
capability of earlier versions.

NT 4.0's new Intranet features include Microsoft FrontPage 1.1, which allows
users to publish Web pages easily; Microsoft Index Server; an Internet search
engine; and Internet security. NT 4.0 is optimised for broad bandwidth
networks like Fast Ethernet and allows users to make local calls for remote
Internet access to their corporate LANs.

Dataquest industry analyst Janardan Menon said Novell would continue to lose
market share to NT at an even more accelerated rate than last year.

He attributed this to the growing popularity in the corporate world of
Microsoft Workstation as a client operating system, which is designed to fit
in with NT. He said that although NetWare is compatible with Workstation,
people would prefer to have the same operating system from the same company on
both the client and server.

Mr Menon added that Intel would promote NT because NT requires Intel's Pentium
Pro chips to run.

"It's not only the product that matters, but the marketing around it," he
said, adding that NetWare's network directory services are superior to NT's
equivalent.

Ray Chang, chief executive officer of AsiaConnect, a Malaysian company that is
one of Asia's largest providers of Internet Web sites, offered a more extreme
opinion. "I don't think Novell stands a chance against NT," he said.

"NT is scaleable, cheap, seamlessly integrated to the Internet and easy to
implement. NetWare does not seamlessly fit into the Internet as well as NT."

Now, over 60 per cent of the world's PC LANs use Novell NetWare, and it is
easier for these NetWare users to upgrade to future versions of NetWare than
to NT, according to Novell Asia-Pacific marketing manager Jason Pan.

Microsoft's Mr Yong said NT 4.0 is compatible with NetWare, so companies that
deploy NetWare can add NT 4.0.

Microsoft has also provided tools to allow users to migrate from NetWare to NT
4.0.

Workstation is part of Microsoft's plan to target the corporate market. Mr
Menon said corporate users would prefer Workstation to Windows 95 because the
former is pure 32-bit and more robust.

Microsoft marketing manager Natasha Kwan said PCs with Workstation would be
powerful enough to move into the workstation market. However, Microsoft
Singapore managing director Paul Lovell admitted Workstation consumes so much
power that notebooks need a power cable to operate Workstation.

Wing Tai net earnings jump 73% to $145m / Wing Tai Holdings, DNP Holdings

from BUSINESS TIMES (Singapore Press Holdings Ltd), 23 Sep 96

By Michelle Low

Result beats market forecasts by $20m; more project profits booked than
expected

[SINGAPORE] Wing Tai Holdings has reported a 73 per cent rise in net profit to
$145 million for the year to June 30, higher than market forecasts by about
$20 million.

Wing Tai, which started out making garments but now makes its money from
property, said it would wind down its loss-making garment manufacturing
business in Singapore. But it will continue profitable garment-making
operations in Malaysia through associate DNP Holdings.

Space vacated by the manufacturing operations at its Tampines headquarters
building will be leased out. The site may be redeveloped in future -its
location in a housing district and near a proposed MRT station makes it ideal
for a residential project.

Almost all of 1996 (and 1995) earnings came from Singapore property projects
sold in the early '90s.

In the second half, the group earned almost $100 million more than it did in
the first half. Analysts said forecasts were off the mark as Wing Tai booked
more profit from development projects than they had provided for.

In the period under review, the group recognised 40 per cent of total bookings
from Maplewoods, 29 per cent from Palm Springs and 30 per cent from the
Hougang Mall it sold to NTUC Income. Pre-tax profits came to $238 million, up
68 per cent from last year. Turnover rose 53 per cent to $573 million.

Earnings per share jumped to 25.7 cents from 14.9 cents. Net tangible assets
went up to $2.06 per share from $1.84 per share. Directors recommended a
dividend of 20 per cent, the same as last year.

Sales of its new housing projects here are steady. The just-launched Sunrise
Gardens sold 50 per cent of its 252 units in a week. The Bedok apartments were
priced at $580 per square foot and marketed just after the "Ghost Month"
ended.

Sales at the 251-unit Duchess Crest improved to 65 per cent, up from 45 per
cent in July. Analysts say sales improved after Wing Tai took the $1,000 psf
project to Hongkong to sell.

Between now and mid-1997, Wing Tai will sell four more projects -one
commercial (Bencoolen Street) and three residential.

Another 400-unit Bukit Timah project on the Rothmans site will be sold only in
1998.

50% of profit to come from overseas / Wing Tai

from BUSINESS TIMES (Singapore Press Holdings Ltd), 23 Sep 96

By Michelle Low

[SINGAPORE] By the turn of the century, half of Wing Tai's profits will come
from overseas property projects in Hongkong and Malaysia.

The largest single project on Wing Tai's plate now is the massive Airport
Railway Kowloon Station Development in Hongkong. Wing Tai leads a consortium
in developing the HK$7.7 billion (S$1.4 billion) residential project, phase
one of a seven-phase project.

The first phase will have about 1.6 million square feet of built-up area. Wing
Tai, which has a 30 per cent interest in the project, declined to give profit
estimates.

But analysts suggest that at a conservative selling price of HK$7,000 per
square foot, the first phase could generate revenue of close to HK$12 billion.
Subtracting a cost of close to HK$5,000 psf, profit could be more than HK$3
billion.

The group was mostly silent on China, except to say that activities were "at a
relatively low level" but "longer term prospects are positive". Wing Tai is
involved in the Suzhou Industrial Park and is also building apartments in
Suzhou's New District.

In Malaysia, associate DNP has "started to make property development and
investment a core business".

DNP owns 14.3 million sq ft of commercial and residential land in Kuala Lumpur
and Penang.

As part of its regional focus, Wing Tai is also planning a chain of high-end
service apartments under the Lanson Place brand.

Some 700 units in four projects are being built in Singapore (Winsland House
II), Kuala Lumpur and Jakarta. Two developments start operating next year.

The China hand

from BUSINESS TIMES (Singapore Press Holdings Ltd), 23 Sep 96

Column:  Hang Seng Insight

By Quak Hiang Whai

Two separate events may share a common link

WHAT has Tung Chee Hwa's candidacy for the post of chief executive of the
Special Administrative Region government and the settlement of a long-delayed
container terminal project have in common? On the surface, the link is
shipping. Mr Tung is chairman of Orient Overseas International Ltd, which owns
shipping firm Orient Overseas Container Line.

But hidden beneath the waves, the link could well be China, extending a
"guiding hand".

Mr Tung's declaration puts to rest months of speculation about the intention
of the hottest favourite for Hongkong's top post-1997 job. Pro-China and
pro-business parties will be relieved by his declared interest, while liberals
will see the development as part of a staged competition. After all, the
low-key shipping tycoon has been tipped to be China's prefered candidate and
is expected by many to toe the "make money, not democracy" line.

His candidacy may even provide comfort to some pro-British elements since he
was also a member of the Governor's advisory body. As for those without a
stand, Mr Tung has at least widened the field for a contest which has so far
yielded only two other candidates.

Yet, all is not rosy. Is a businessman with huge interests in Hongkong and
China and business partners like Li Ka-shing right for the job? To reassure
doubters, Mr Tung plans to resign from all his key positions and stay away
from the selection committee which will elect the chief executive. He will
also transfer his business interests to other family members.

More importantly, however, is whether the selection process will be fair and
transparent. To many people here, the choice of the chief executive has
already been made by Beijing.

Meanwhile, Secretary of Economic Services Stephen Ip called a press briefing
with the major port operators Hutchison Whampoa, Jardine, Wharf and Sealand to
announce the breakthrough in the agreement on CT9 (Container Terminal Nine).

He had difficulty assuring and reassuring the media that the CT9 agreement was
a purely commercial deal and no political pressure was made to reduce
Jardine's role.

Despite his efforts, it seemed that none of the journalists who attended the
briefing came away convinced. As far as the media was concerned, the British
hong was clearly the loser. After four years of highly-charged political
wrangling between the British and Chinese, Jardine's participation has been
reduced from a lead role in a new terminal to a secondary stake in a
restructured consortium which will take over two existing berths at CT8. The
group gets no part at all in CT9.

Optimists say, however, that the two berths will ensure that Jardine still has
a role in the thriving port business here. Also, Hongkong finally gets to
expand its port capacity and the government can now move on to tendering CT10
and CT11.

As for China, it now badly needs to show the world that the impasse over CT9
was an isolated case and no such wrangling will happen again in future
"commercial" deals.

Do we see a show of hands?

SembCorp may inject transport and logistics into SML / Sembawang
Corporation, Sembawang Maritime, SML

from BUSINESS TIMES (Singapore Press Holdings Ltd), 23 Sep 96

By Rahita Elias

[SINGAPORE] Sembawang Corp (SembCorp) has confirmed that it is considering
transferring some of its transport and logistics (T&L) businesses into
takeover target Sembawang Maritime Ltd (SML). This was revealed in SembCorp's
offer document to SML issued over the weekend.

"In line with the on-going restructuring of the SembCorp group's business
activities into five business groups, SembCorp may consider transferring
certain transportation and logistics businesses held by other companies within
the SembCorp group into SML."

SembCorp T&L president Billy Lee, who is also president of SML, told BT
earlier that the T&L division would be placed under one entity but declined to
name the umbrella company. Market watchers had speculated that SML would be
that entity.

SembCorp also said in its offer document that SembCorp, which owned 35.8 per
cent of SML's issued and paid-up capital as at Sep 16, may transfer some of
SML's business outside the transportation and logistics field to other
companies within the group. Such businesses could include the shiprepair
business.

Its voluntary conditional offer for SML will close on Oct 14, 1996, at 3.30pm.

Electronics : fall in export growth

from BUSINESS TIMES (Singapore Press Holdings Ltd), 23 Sep 96

Column:  Eye on the Economy

By Genevieve Cua

Trade

GROWTH of domestic exports of the top three electronics items slowed
considerably in August, with the key disk drives segment expanding just 7.9
per cent after growth of as much as 50 per cent in January.

Integrated circuits made its worst showing this year with a year-on-year
contraction of nearly 18 per cent. Manufacturers exported $748 million worth
of ICs, compared to $912 million last year.

Data processing components and peripherals slipped 1.1 per cent, after a 20
per cent rise in January. The three items accounted for about 35 per cent of
August's non-oil domestic exports.

The latest trade figures released last Friday showed a worse-than-expected
fall in non-oil domestic exports of 6.3 per cent in nominal terms, and
detailed data on the major electronics items reflect manufacturers' woes.

HG Asia economist Song Seng Wun said: "The hard disk drive segment is showing
some stability but the semiconductor segment is under a heavy cloud. Product
prices are falling..."

He said checks on the local industry revealed a pick-up in orders ahead of
Christmas. "But these are hopeful purchases. Should there be signs of
inventory piling up again and weak sales, customers will turn around and
cancel orders."

"People are placing orders in anticipation of being able to flog them ahead of
Christmas, but if the US numbers remain depressed and demand is weak from
Europe, those orders will be cancelled," he said.

He said month-on-month numbers might look encouraging, but year-on-year
numbers were not.

"You're seeing the sharp impact of the decline in product prices."

In the personal computer segment, he said demand was growing by 20 per cent
while supply was rising by between 40 per cent and 50 per cent. "Something has
to give."

Economists expect the slowdown to last until the first quarter of 1997.

MIT to build integrated system to speed up production for chip firms /
Manufacturing Integration Technology Pte Ltd

from BUSINESS TIMES (Singapore Press Holdings Ltd), 23 Sep 96

By Clarissa Tan

MANUFACTURING Integration Technology (MIT) will be making life simpler for the
electronics industry.

The company intends to build an integrated system that will speed up the
manufacturing process for semiconductor companies, as well as allow
manufacturers to meet customer demands with greater accuracy.

"The integrated system will basically cut the time needed for the
manufacturing process," said MIT managing director Tony Kwong.

"The system does in half a day what others now do in six or seven.

"Also, at the packaging end, the system is an intelligent one and can place in
each package the exact amount that the customer requires."

Mr Kwong feels that this will help the related electronics industry to avoid
problems such as oversupply and the consequent fall in prices for electronics
goods.

When completed in about one and a half to two year's time, MIT's automated,
integrated system for semiconductor processing will be the first in South-east
Asia. The project, called the Fully Automated EOL Process, is being helped by
the Economic Development Board which has given MIT a $1.5 million grant.

Semiconductor firms need processing equipment at various stages of
manufacturing, such as testing, laser marking and packing. What MIT will do is
to integrate all these processes into one automated system. It will also
reduce labour.

Incorporated in 1992, MIT designs and builds processing equipment for
semiconductor firms. A family-owned company, it intends to be listed by
end-1998 or early-1999. Turnover for the company has been doubling every year
until this year, when it rose 20-30 per cent due to the slowdown in
electronics sector. Mr Kwong, expects turnover to start doubling again in the
next year.

Academic defends tender system: Housing cost not up as much as property
prices

from BUSINESS TIMES (Singapore Press Holdings Ltd), 23 Sep 96

By Chuang Peck Ming

EXCESSIVE demand, not the tender system, is the culprit that has pushed up
property prices in recent years, academic Jennifer Mao told the Cost Review
Committee on Friday.

"It is an over-demand problem," she said, fuelled by the opening of the HDB
resale market and the liberalisation of HDB and CPF for the purchase of
properties.

The tender system is only used as a convenient scapegoat by its critics, said
Ms Mao, a lecturer from the Department of Finance and Banking at the National
University of Singapore. "If the tender system is not used, whatever other
mechanism employed will be similarly blamed."

The tender system, she said, is superior to any other system to determine
prices -- especially when the true or fair value of land is hard to assess.

Ms Mao also defended the government's high reserve price in tendering out
land. "As the land belongs to all Singaporeans collectively, it is the
government's responsibility to capture as much as possible the full economic
value of the land," she said.

Housing cost not up as much as property prices: Academic defends tender
system

from BUSINESS TIMES (Singapore Press Holdings Ltd), 23 Sep 96

By Chuang Peck Ming

Chief statistician: consumption and investment distinct

THE cost of accommodation for home owners has not increased as much as the big
jumps in property prices would suggest, said government chief statistician
Paul Cheung on Friday.

His submission to a Cost Review Committee hearing, embargoed to be released
today, showed that the proxy measure of changes in housing cost -the annual
assessed value (AAV) estimated by the Chief Valuer of the Inland Revenue
Authority of Singapore -rose by single-digit figures, and not the double-digit
rises witnessed in the property market in recent years.

He said: "The owner-occupied housing sub-index (of the Consumer Price Index)
has increased by 5.1 per cent between 1992 and 1993 and 0.9 per cent during
1993-95. However, it declined by 0.2 per cent during January-June 1996."

A distinction has to be made between consumption and investment when the
buying price of a house or flat is considered, said Dr Cheung. The CPI, which
tracks price changes in consumption, is only interested in the shelter service
that is consumed. It does not take into consideration the house or flat as an
asset which can be sold for capital gains. Ordinarily, the CPI needs only to
track the changes in rentals to get a measure of the price changes in
accommodation, or user cost. But since most Singaporeans are owner-occupiers,
the rentals have to be imputed. And the AAV provides the best imputation. "The
rental equivalence approach for treatment of owner-occupied housing is
conceptually and methodologically sound," he said. "The same approach is
adopted in the compilation of national accounts statistics."

Electronics slump hits Singapore most : report

from BUSINESS TIMES (Singapore Press Holdings Ltd), 23 Sep 96

By Anna Teo

AMONG the region's economies, Singapore has probably been the hardest hit by
the global electronics slump, says Consensus Economics Inc, noting that the
average 1996 growth forecast had been cut to 7.4 per cent from 8.5 per cent in
the last two months.

The London-based firm's latest gross domestic product (GDP) growth average is
derived from 17 forecasters in early September, including NatWest Markets
which heads the list with an 8.5 per cent projection.

But NatWest has since sliced its 1996 Singapore growth forecast to 7 per cent,
which brings the Consensus Economics average down to 7.3 per cent.

A separate BT list of 19 GDP growth forecasts for 1996, ranging from J P
Morgan's 6 per cent to Nomura Research Institute's 7.6 per cent, produces an
average of 7.1 per cent.

Consensus Economics polls financial and economic forecasters around the world
every month for their estimates of key variables.

Its findings for Singapore show a GDP growth average of 5.3 per cent in the
third quarter (compared to a BT average of 4.6 per cent) and 6.4 per cent in
the fourth quarter (BT average: 6.1 per cent).

Manufacturing growth is expected to reach a trough of 4.5 per cent in the
third quarter this year, according to Consensus Economics' poll.

"Consumer sentiment, and thus spending, has also been badly affected by the
subsequent job-cutting in the manufacturing sector," it says, noting the
sluggish consumer demand reflected in weak retail sales.

Retail sales grew about 2.9 per cent over the first half of the year, and 4.3
per cent in July. The poor retail performance has reduced price pressures,
with inflation below 1.5 per cent in the last few months.

The government remains on course to reach its year-end inflation target of 1.5
per cent, says Consensus Economics.

But while most of Singapore's recent indicators show signs of an economic
slowdown, investment growth remains strong, rising by 23 per cent in the
second quarter. This has been reflected in an upward revision to the consensus
investment forecast to 11.9 per cent for 1996.

Boosted by robust investment growth, GDP growth is expected to recover by the
second quarter of 1997, says Consensus Economics.

[KUALA LUMPUR] Leader Universal Holdings Bhd has proposed to issue up to
US$125 million (S$175 million) Euro bonds to take advantage of its
substantially lower interest cost over local bank financing.

Commerce International Merchant Bankers Bhd said in a statement on behalf of
Leader Universal that proceeds from the issue would be used to repay bank
borrowings, additional investment in subsidiaries and the settlement of
expenses for the proposed exercise. The bonds will mature in seven years.

The proposed issue is not expected to have any effect on the company's net
tangible assets per share and earnings until such time when the bonds are
converted.

The bonds will be listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange. -NST

Inchcape first-half profit down 23% to $24m / Inchape Bhd

from BUSINESS TIMES (Singapore Press Holdings Ltd), 23 Sep 96

By Rahita Elias

Decline due mainly to loss of contribution from Rolex

[SINGAPORE] Inchcape Berhad's net profit fell 23 per cent to $23.8 million for
the six months to June 30, 1996.

The trading firm said over the weekend that the loss of contribution from
Rolex Singapore Pte Ltd was the main reason for the fall. A 47 per cent rise
in interest expense to $4.4 million also dragged down its interim performance.

The fall was offset partially by a 29 per cent decline in taxes to $11.4
million.

Earnings per share (EPS) fell 23 per cent to 14.5 cents. Analysts polled by
The Estimate Directory have pegged Inchcape's full-year EPS at 30.7 cents,
down 14 per cent.

Group turnover was down 2 per cent to $643.8 million.

Profit before interest dropped 5 per cent to $39.3 million. This included
contributions from associates.

Of the total, its "motors business stream" generated some $21.1 million -down
25 per cent year-on-year.

The "marketing business stream" fared better with profit rising 61 per cent to
$8.4 million. Its consumer division did particularly well, with profit
tripling to $6.4 million. It had benefited from the rationalisation of loss
makers last year and the disposal of the office automation business.

Meanwhile, Inchcape's shipping business incurred a loss of $200,000 compared
to a $200,000 profit in the same period last year.

Its financial services business saw profit before interest rose 25 per cent to
$9.5 million. IRB Finance, which mainly finances retail car purchases in
Brunei, had benefited from the higher value of car sales financed.

Directors declared an interim dividend of 10 cents per share before tax,
unchanged from the same period last year.

On current year prospects, they said the second half would be a challenging
time for the group, especially in the motor industry. "Notwithstanding that,
(we) believe that, excluding the discontinued Rolex business, the group will
be able to maintain a similar level of profit as in 1995."

State-owned BNI's IPO on track / Bank Negara Indonesia, BNI

from BUSINESS TIMES (Singapore Press Holdings Ltd), 23 Sep 96

By S N Vasuki in Jakarta

Bank's massive float next month seen bringing investors back into market

STATE-OWNED Bank Negara Indonesia (BNI) has filed a registration statement
with Indonesian regulators, paving the way for its massive initial public
offer next month. BNI is the first state-owned bank to be privatised in
Indonesia.

The bank said over the weekend that it would float 25 per cent of its paid-up
capital in the IPO and is awaiting formal approval from the Indonesian Capital
Markets Supervisory Agency (Bapepam).

Analysts had earlier speculated that the size of the issue would be around one
trillion rupiah (S$608 million) with market capitalisation of four trillion
rupiah.

BNI shares will be listed on the Jakarta and Surabaya stock exchanges though
the bank said that it is also open to international investors. The IPO will be
underwritten by Danareksa Securitas while Lehman Brothers will act as the
international adviser.

The BNI issue comes at a time when sentiment on the local stock market has
turned bearish. Foreign investors, who dominate trading on the Jakarta bourse,
have pulled out of the market over political succession concerns.

The July 27 riots that rocked Jakarta have further eroded confidence.

Not surprisingly, this has not been a particularly good year for IPOs.
Analysts have revised downwards earlier estimates of US$1.5 billion (S$2.11
billion) being raised through new offerings in 1996. Nevertheless, the BNI
offer is expected to bring investors back into the market.

The BNI issue will be the only Indonesian state-owned firm to go public in
1996. Besides BNI, the government originally had ambitious plans to float
three other state firms this year.

These are toll-road operator PT Jasa Marga, steel firm Krakatau Steel and
international carrier Garuda Indonesia. But the flotations have been delayed
because of international perception that these state firms are not performing
well and hence the government would not be able to set an attractive price.

BNI, which is the largest of Indonesia's seven state-owned banks, is also the
healthiest. At end-June, the bank had assets of 32 trillion rupiah and
reported revenue of 17 trillion rupiah.

The bank said that between 1993 and 1995 its net earnings rose from 245
billion rupiah to 378.7 billion rupiah. BNI has a capital adequacy ratio of
9.1 per cent and a loan-deposit ratio of 86.3 per cent.

BNI proposes to use the IPO proceeds to fund its investment and development
programme. The bank operates 489 branches in Indonesia and six overseas. Its
core business is corporate and retail banking.

Extending trading net into retail / EasyKnit International Holdings Ltd

from BUSINESS TIMES (Singapore Press Holdings Ltd), 23 Sep 96

By Quak Hiang Whai in Hongkong

COMPANY VISIT EasyKnit Int'l Holdings

Easyknit defies narrow margins and competition to launch its own fashion brand

AT A time when many garment retailers are facing intense competition and
narrowing margins, Matthew Koon is doing what some analysts here would imagine
to be the unthinkable -launching his own fashion brand name and chain of
retail stores in the region.

The founder of listed Easyknit International Holdings is also planning for a
secondary listing in Singapore to help finance his new venture.

About 80 million shares or 20 per cent of the existing capital would be
issued. The Singa pore offer is expected within the next two weeks. Analysts
expect the company to raise up to HK$250 million (S$46 million) from the
issue.

The funds will help Easyknit develop its own fashion brand name, Library. The
company plans to open 10 Library outlets here by the first quarter of next
year, before penetrating Taiwan and China's markets.

Mr Koon says: "We have a very strong design team and we have a very strong
supplier network. We can offer many styles at lower costs."

In fact, much of Easyknit's success in recent years had been attributed to the
group's unusual relationship with its 16 or so suppliers. Years ago, Mr Koon
parcelled out production functions to his employees and helped them set up
their own businesses.

Now they are his suppliers, helping him to source for cheap materials from
around the world while he focuses on expanding his export markets.

"I lent them money and now I'm taking my money back. Some are my long-time
friends. Some are my ex-employees," said Mr Koon.

"They only concentrate on working for me. We both make money together. My
material costs are about 10 per cent lower than my competitors."

Easyknit's links with its suppliers are further stamped by exclusive contracts
which last for 10 years each.

Mr Koon, who won the Young Entrepreneur of the Year award in 1994, employs a
small number of staff compared to his listed rivals. Easyknit has only about
70 employees, dealing in marketing and merchandising. Still, turnover for the
year ended March 31, 1996 came to HK$1.2 billion and net profit, HK$104.6
million.

In comparison, Glorious Sun Enterprise, which employs more than 1,000 people,
has a turnover of about HK$1.6 billion.

Mr Koon is confident that the new retail business would be profitable by the
first year. "It is because we don't keep inventories. We don't do the
production. We can test market first and then we make bulk orders. We don't
get stuck with inventories."

Besides going into the retail business, the company is also expected to
generate property income from its investment in a new building.

Easyknit recently bought a plot of land and is developing its new 27-floor
headquarters on the Cheung Sha Wan site in Kowloon. The property investment
will help to diversify its earnings base from 1998.

The recent diversification into retail and property has gone down well with
analysts. Analysts expect the company's rental income to hit HK$10 million a
year and the retail business to contribute about 20 per cent of turnover from
next year.

As for its core trading business, the company will continue to enjoy low
material costs, quick turnaround times and strong profit margins, thanks to
its exclusive contracts with suppliers in low cost countries such as
Indonesia, China and Honduras.

Analysts expect Easyknit's net profit to grow by at least 20 per cent in the
current year to about HK$146 million and to HK$174 million in the following
year.

GIC, DBS Land among S'pore groups vying for HK$7b project

from BUSINESS TIMES (Singapore Press Holdings Ltd), 23 Sep 96

By Quak Hiang Whai in Hongkong

SINGAPORE's interest in Hongkong's real estate market remains unabated as
several of the republic's biggest property groups joined in the territory's
latest land tender for a HK$7 billion (S$1.3 billion) airport-railway station
property project.

At the close of the Mass Transit Railway Corporation (MTRC) tender on Friday,
the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation (GIC), the Hong Leong Group
and DBS Land were among the over 30 companies which formed 12 consortiums to
bid for the second phase of the Tung Chung MTRC project.

With previous MTRC tenders attracting only five to six consortiums each, the
latest tender for Tung Chung will be the hottest contest ever for an MTR site.
The Tung Chung site is the first station linked to the proposed airport at
Chek Lap Kok island.

Hong Leong and GIC, which were unsuccessful for the prestigious HK$40 billion
Central MTR tender earlier this year, joined Hongkong China and HKR
International for the contest.

DBS Land, which has teamed up with Ng Teng Fong's Sino Land for several
Hongkong property projects, was part of the consortium which includes Sino
Land, Tai Cheung Holdings and Great Eagle Holdings.

Last year, DBS Land joined the winning consortium led by Sino Land for the
HK$12 billion Tai Kok Tsui MTR mixed project. DBS Land is expected to join
Sino Land for phase three of the same project.

The MTRC has so far awarded six contracts along the airport railway line,
including phase one of the HK$70 billion Kowloon project which was won by a
Singapore-dominated consortium. That consortium was led by the Wing Tai Group
with participation from Singapore Land, Straits Steamship Land and Temasek
Holdings. Property developers like airport railway projects because of the
mixed features and proximity to the railway line.

Analysts say the record numbers of bids for the second phase of Tung Chung
project reflects the reviving bullish sentiment in the Hongkong residential
property market. Analysts also attributed the strong response to the smaller
size of the development.

East Asian gold demand slumped in first half

from BUSINESS TIMES (Singapore Press Holdings Ltd), 23 Sep 96

By Neil Behrmann in London

Consultancy says China leads region in falling demand

GOLD demand in East Asia, particularly China, slumped in the first half of the
year, according to a London-based consultant.

Gold Fields Mineral Services, a respected and well-connected consultancy,
estimated that fabrication demand from East Asia, including Japan, slid to 485
tons in the first six months of the year from 572 tons in the same period in
1995.

Consumption in China contracted to only 69 tons from 128 tons in the same
period. Hoarding of gold in East Asia shrank to 61 tons from 140 tons and in
China the amount was only two tons in the first half, compared with 13 tons in
the same 1995 time-frame.

In the early part of the year when gold touched a year-high of US$418 an
ounce, there was resistance to higher prices, the consultant said.

"But China's slump in gold purchases is also the result of a prolonged
austerity campaign, the stabilisation of the currency and a growing preference
for jewellery set with diamonds and other gems," said Stewart Murray, chief
executive of Gold Fields Mineral Services.

In contrast, Middle Eastern gold jewellery consumption and hoarding, jumped to
271 tons in the first six months from 230 tons the previous year. Consumption
and hoarding in India rose to 321 tons from 296 tons and good weather for
farmers points to a continuation of this trend, forecast Mr Murray.

Despite a sound market in the Indian sub continent and the Middle East, global
gold demand fell 8.3 per cent to 1,727 tons in the six months to end-June
1996. In the major European nations, spending on gold jewellery fell because
of a worsening economic climate and rising unemployment. Gold prices,
presently languishing around US$383 an ounce, down 8 per cent from their
January peaks, have also fallen because of an increase in supply.

Year-on-year global mine production rose 3.2 per cent to 1,120 tons in the
first of the year and gold scrap recycling by 15 per cent to 338 tons.
Disenchanted investors who had bought at high prices in 1995 and early 1996
off-loaded 160 tons between February and the end of June.

Central bank sales dipped to 108 tons in the first half of 1996 from 196 tons
in 1995, but the timing of the supplies contributed to the market depression.
Mr Murray said he believed there were secret sales over and above this amount.

He expects gold consumption to improve in the coming months ahead of Christmas
and Chinese New Year in late January. Yet, the price will only rise if there
is lower producer and central bank sales. The market is uncertain about the
psychological impact of potential International Monetary Fund sales of 155
tons.

Fed seen staying its hand

from BUSINESS TIMES (Singapore Press Holdings Ltd), 23 Sep 96

Column:  Simex Weekly Roundup

By Collum Henderson

Interest rate differentials still hold key to strength of greenback

[SINGAPORE] Will they or won't they? It's definitely a close call. On balance,
however, MMS expects the Fed to continue to stay its hand -the Reuters story
notwithstanding.

Fed governors have proved less hawkish this time than their regional Fed
colleagues and are notably more reluctant to simply fight growth, particularly
when inflationary pressures remain very muted.

Granted, the Philly Fed price component rise is a concern, but the latest
Producer Price Index, and more importantly Consumer Price Index, data suggest
that there continues to be no inflation problem as yet.

Some might see the upcoming US presidential election as an obstacle to any Fed
tightening. However there is surely no question that Alan Greenspan would hike
now if he thought it was warranted, whether or not he was ever invited to sit
next to Hillary again.

We expect steady Fed policy this week -followed by a 50 basis point tightening
at the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting just after the election.
So what does this mean for the US dollar?

The forex market is pricing in a Fed tightening this week, resulting in the
dollar trading higher. No Fed rate hike means the US dollar is likely to see
those gains eroded very quickly.

The Fed statement, if there is any, will be important. Going forward, the key
will be consequent rate expectations -the dollar will not suffer as much if
the market continues to expect the Fed to hike.

Interest rate differentials, rather than trade fundamentals, remain the key
for now. Near term, we do not expect any change in the official interest rate
differential between the US, and Germany and Japan. Thus, the dollar should
soften near term from here.

Aside from the FOMC, we have a full slate of data this week. First off, today,
is the Italian September CPI data. Though most attention is focused on
government attempts to bring forward a credible 1997 budget, this data should
confirm that inflationary pressures in Italy are continuing to decline
-leaving the Bank of Italy room after the budget to ease rates further.

German COL and Import Price data for September and August respectively is due
tomorrow. MMS expects these to show price pressures remaining equally muted in
Germany.

Also coming out tomorrow is the UK's Q2 Gross Domestic Product data. The
market has already priced in steady Bank of England policy from here given the
extent of the rebound.

Column:  Warrant Watch

By R Sivanithy

THE KL Second Board is now at dangerously high levels and if it cracks,
speculative money will channel itself into other areas. One prime candidate is
of course the KL main board, so it might make sense for punters to quietly
position themselves in warrants listed on the main board.

One possibility is the Johan 1999 warrant which is also traded
over-the-counter here on Clob International. This is one of the few warrants
that's out-of-the-money -the exercise price is M$2.50 compared to the shares
at M$2.26.

As such, regular readers will know that the conversion premium must be high
and at M$1.01 per warrant, this works out to 55 per cent. Gearing is slightly
above average at 2.24 times and the instrument has about 28 months left to
run.

To be honest, the numbers are not convincing as a 55 per cent premium for time
is a lot to pay for. But the stock is way off its 52-week high of M$3.28, it
has proven in the past to be a favourite among punters and the warrant is
cheap in absolute terms. If the Second Board does undergo its much needed
correction, this warrant could benefit. -By R Sivanithy

All eyes likely to remain on KLSE's Second Board

from BUSINESS TIMES (Singapore Press Holdings Ltd), 23 Sep 96

By R Sivanithy

Liquidity in S'pore stocks improving but sobering trade figures will rein in
further rises

STOCK MARKET COMMENTARY

[SINGAPORE] Anyone who raised the possibility at the start of the year that
the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange's Second Board would be occupied by
billion-ringgit companies before the year-end would probably have been scoffed
at.

Not now, of course. Not when the Second Board Index has more than doubled and
it's hosting two counters that have crossed the M$100 level.

Last week, the index set four record highs and, as usual, dominated the market
-more than M$1 billion was traded daily, which is significantly more than the
$325.71 million average chalked up by the entire local market comprising the
main board, Clob and Sesdaq.

Brokers here tell of harrowing sessions every day as excited clients, lured by
the double-digit gains, call constantly to place huge orders, for which few
actually have the funds to pay. One stressed dealer at a foreign brokerage
said: "Clients buy in the morning, sell before lunch and buy again after
lunch. This goes on throughout the day, and all in minimum lots of
30,000-50,000 and all on a contra basis. I've actually had to talk them out of
some trades."

If retail punters here are minting money on the Second Board, then imagine
what the impact has been on the personal wealth of some of the people who own
significant stakes in Second Board companies. Take, for instance, Wan Adli Wan
Ibrahim, a relatively unknown Berjaya group executive director who currently
chairs two Second Board companies, Transwater and Bridgecon.

Having just bought 50.84 per cent of Transwater's capital for M$15 per share
or M$99.1 million last month, Mr Wan Adli's stake is now worth M$100 per
share, or about M$661 million. On paper, he is sitting on M$561.82 million of
profit.

As for Bridgecon, he raised his stake to 20 per cent just before the shares
were suspended last week. The stock jumped 68 per cent to M$32 when trading
resumed on Friday. Wan Adli's stake is now worth M$127.68 million, bringing
the combined value of his Transwater and Bridgecon shares to M$788.68 million.

Along the way, Transwater said it had submitted a M$1.1 billion bid to the
government to rebuild the Johor-Singapore Causeway, while Bridgecon announced
an increase in its rights issue, an acquisition of land costing M$463 million,
and an acquisition of its shares by SAP Holdings managing director Raduan
Taib, who bought a 36 per cent stake at M$20 per share. Both Wan Adli and Mr
Raduan have Vincent Tan's Berjaya Group to thank for their instant wealth --
the conglomerate is believed to be the main contender for the Causeway's
reconstruction and is the party which sold the land to Bridgecon.

Transwater, whose shares traded at M$5 last November and M$15 in August, is
now capitalised at about M$1.3 billion. No doubt if Bridgecon continues to
make similarly exciting announcements as it did last week, it too will join
Transwater in the billion-ringgit club.

The Second Board, no doubt, will continue to dominate trading but it is
uncertain which direction it would take. Most analysts are now calling for a
long overdue correction and hopefully, when this happens, it won't be too
painful for those involved.

As for the local market, it would be unfair to say that interest is
non-existent as liquidity has improved. However, although the Straits Times
Industrials Index managed to break 2,200 during the week, its inability to
hold onto its gains and Friday's sobering trade figures will probably rein in
any further rises.

On the external front, the US Federal Reserve meets tomorrow for its regular
interest rate meeting. The long bond yield on Friday was largely unchanged at
7.05 per cent, suggesting that any forthcoming rate hike has already been
factored into prices.

According to NatWest Markets, the market has "already priced in a rate hike of
25 basis points and should not encounter a substantial gyration even if the
Fed were to raise rates. A major surprise would be a larger hike, say 50 basis
points, or "rate inaction".

Whether or not the Fed acts or not remains to be seen. Meanwhile, all eyes
will still be on the Second Board.

Banking reforms end era of profligacy: Uncertain future for Laotian
T-bonds

from BUSINESS TIMES (Singapore Press Holdings Ltd), 23 Sep 96

By Harish Mehta

[SINGAPORE] Before 1976, Lao guerillas ran their own parallel economy. The
zone, controlled by guerillas of the Lao Patriotic Front, had its own
currency, and its own mechanism for distributing money in provinces it
occupied.

The zone under the US-leaning Vientiane government consisted of a central
bank, and six private banks.

After liberation, the existing banks were nationalised by the Lao Patriotic
Front which committed the deadly mistake of consolidating all commercial
banking activities into the central bank, the National Bank of Laos.

Soon afterwards, the name of the central bank was changed to State Bank, and,
as its name suggested, the bank extended loans primarily to state firms, while
retaining the exclusive right to issue currency. The State Bank established a
network of 96 branches across the country. It was only in 1988 that autonomous
state-owned commercial banks were allowed to start.

When the late strongman Kaysone Phomvihane launched reforms under the New
Economic Mechanism the same year, the central bank was restructured into a new
entity, the Bank of the Lao People's Democratic Republic, and a two-tier
banking system introduced to separate central banking from commercial
functions.

First signs that the government would relax entry rules for foreign banks came
with the establishment of a semi-private bank in 1989 in which both the state
and private firms held shares.

These reforms put an end to an era of profligacy when state firms had
unfettered access to central bank funds at negative interest rates. The
government, for the first time, in 1991 introduced minimum and maximum
interest rates. Interest rate controls were scrapped in mid-1993. The only
controls left were a minimum savings deposit rate, and a maximum lending rate.

It was the reformed banking sector that introduced bonds and T-Bills. Now with
Laos set to join Asean, it has set its sights on issuing long-term bonds.

Uncertain future for Laotian T-bonds: Banking reforms end era of
profligacy

from BUSINESS TIMES (Singapore Press Holdings Ltd), 23 Sep 96

By Harish Mehta

Inflation deflates euphoria that came with launch of short-term bonds in 1991

[SINGAPORE] WHEN Laos launched its first government bonds five years ago,
residents of the capital, Vientiane, were delighted by the novelty of earning
interest at double-digit rates.

The euphoria accompanying the introduction of short-term bonds in 1991 is
over. Bond issues have been hit since last year because inflation runs at more
than 19 per cent.

Things are just as bad this year. As a result, the government has stopped
issuing long-term bonds. For now, it offers only six-month bonds that earn
half-yearly interest of about 10 per cent.

Laotians venture into the bond market as their kip-deposits in banks earn
lower annual interest of 16 per cent. But even so, interest gains are being
wiped out by inflation. Many Laotians, in the days of single-digit inflation
in 1994, were able to save a small part of their salary, and happily parked
what they saved in short-term bonds. But since last year, as prices of
essential goods rose, the choices for the man on the street, with an average
annual income of US$331 (S$463), were clear: food came before all else.

Sharp price rises between March and September last year triggered substantial
depreciation of the kip, which lost about 27 per cent of its value as the
currency plunged to about 1,000 to the US dollar in September last year from
734 six months earlier.

Pany Yathotou, the governor of the Bank of the Lao People's Democratic
Republic (PDR), the central bank, said: "When inflation was low, even
foreigners bought bonds through their relatives living in Laos. But with
higher inflation, they're not buying them anymore."

Bonds issued by the central bank and the Ministry of Finance look like a cash
certificate, and come in a maximum denomination of 10 million kips (about
US$10,520).

Laotians fret about three issues -the climbing rate of inflation, constant
danger of kip devaluation, and the lack of a secondary market.

So kips are often converted into Laotians' favourite currencies -US dollar and
Thai baht.

Although the future of bonds is hobbled by a lack of a secondary market, Ms
Pany said bond holders could redeem them at the central bank.

Her predecessor, Bousbong Souvannavong, said before a secondary market could
be created, it was necessary for the central bank to issue sufficient paper in
the primary market. "Once the market is sufficiently liquid, will it make
sense to talk of a market price," he added.

Until a secondary market can develop, Laotians will have limited opportunities
of converting their bonds into cash.

Mr Bousbong said the underdeveloped state of the financial markets was due to
errors of the recent past. The government handed over the power to issue
currency to the governor of the central bank as late as in 1990. That ended a
period when the government extended interest-free loans to state companies.

Laotian bonds also have a strategic difference from bonds issued by other
developing countries: the Bank of Lao PDR issues bonds as a monetary
instrument to mop up excess liquidity in the economy, not to raise capital.

"For infrastructure development we would need a long-term maturity of bonds,"
Ms Pany said, "but we have issued only short-term bonds."

Three years after the bonds came on the market, the Laotian Ministry of
Finance began issuing Treasury bills to soak up a very liquid economy. The
first auction took place in March 1994, and auctions of one billion kip are
held once every two weeks.

The government now needs bonds and T-bills more than ever as the threat of
inflation is growing, and the economy is skidding.

Mr Bousbong explained that since Laos introduced financial reforms in 1988,
one of the main objectives was to "curtail liquidity expansion that had
resulted from the easy access state-owned enterprises had to bank credit at
negative interest rates". To tackle the crisis, the government adopted a
positive interest rate policy in August 1989. It ensured interest rates would
be higher than the inflation rate, lending rates higher than deposit rates,
and long-term rates higher than short-term rates.

In time, the central bank will be compelled to create a variety of riskier
instruments such as corporate bonds and equities. Perhaps, the electricity and
water utilities should be encouraged to issue their own paper. A next logical
step would be the creation of financial institutions such as pension funds and
insurance firms.

ShipRepair 96 : a chance to find out what competitors are doing

from BUSINESS TIMES (Singapore Press Holdings Ltd), 23 Sep 96

Column:  Dockyard

By David Hughes

THIS time of the year is always marked by a flurry of conferences, conventions
and exhibitions. This year is no exception with the normal northern autumn
crop of events, on everything from Ship's Agency and Crime at Sea to Arresting
Ships.

Being somewhat the Cinderella of the shipping industry, despite its crucial
importance, there is not much of interest to the repair and conversion sector.
But it does have one annual gathering, at London's Olympia, in early November.
The organisers of ShipRepair & Conversion 96 have just put out the publicity
for the two-day conference and exhibition.

Once again Alan Thorpe and Ronald Sim have put together a well thought-out
programme. The conference covers a wide range of topical issues, though with
perhaps some emphasis on tankers and dry bulk carriers.

The conference, as ever, tackles a mixture of technical and commercial
subjects.

The first session looks at something that ought to be dear to every yard
managers' heart, money. The initial paper looks at how repairers can help
themselves by getting contracts right to start with. Solicitor Mike Lax,
partner with UK law firm Lawrence Graham, provides "A Practical and Legal
Guide to Enforcement under Shiprepair Contracts".

There will be more than enough to keep those who go to ShipRepair mainly for
its technical content happy. The only reservation in this regard is that the
organisers make use of "technical workshops" which take place in parallel with
the presentation of the main papers on both mornings.

Having more than one presentation at a time has its drawbacks. Firstly it
assumes that people interested in, for example, listening to a paper on
Pollution-free Sterntube Seals will not be just as keen to attend the
presentation on Planning for Special Surveys.

To be fair, the organisers have to weigh up all sorts of practical
considerations and still try to pack in as much as possible. Probably the main
problem is that two days is not really long enough to do justice to the
shiprepair and conversion industry.

And there is certainly is a terrific amount packed into this programme. But
most of the presentations are from representatives of European-based companies
and organisations.

There is, though, one Singapore-based speaker. Sigurd Gude, executive
vice-president of Kvaerner Ships Equipment, will be presenting Service
Agreements -Predictable Maintenance Cost True or False. Also from this region,
Hongkong United Dockyards managing director Chris Pooley will present The
Future of Hongkong's Repair Industry after 1997.

The European emphasis should not deter anybody from the Asia-Pacific region
from attending. This is the one annual opportunity to find out what
competitors are doing, and thinking, especially what they think about
competition from Asian yards.

ShipRepair ventures into the area of competition between the major
shiprepairing countries. On the first day there is a panel discussion on the
European shiprepair market. This focuses on competition within Europe and
particularly on the impact of the yards in what was the Eastern Bloc.

Polish yards already have a formidable reputation for cheaper steel repairs.
Now they are moving into technically more complicated areas. That worries the
repairers in western Europe, whose views should be well represented in the
debate.

The European yards are also worried by competition from this region for
conversion contracts. So the second day will see Peter Fetton from the UK's
A&P Group asking: "Is the European conversion industry competitive against the
Far East?"

Since Mr Fetton's paper is preceded by two about current FPSO conversions in
European yards, the answer to his question seems self-evident. After all
Singapore yards, for example, are not inexperienced with, or slow to bid for,
FPSO conversion work.

The reality is that much of the world's repair and conversion business is
subject to intense competition, driven by severe overcapacity, and winning
contracts depends on providing dependable quality at a keen price. That
applies wherever your yard happens to be.

Lumut port expects cargo volume to double

from BUSINESS TIMES (Singapore Press Holdings Ltd), 23 Sep 96

[KUALA LUMPUR] Lumut port in Perak has projected an 80-100 per cent increase
in cargo throughput to 600,000 tonnes by the end of this year from the level
achieved in its first year of operations which ended in July 1996.

Lumut Maritime Terminal (LMT) general manager Kwek Chee Wah said the projected
cargo handling for the port during July to December 1996 will be higher than
the 400,000 tonnes achieved during the one-year period (July 1995 to July
1996).

"Port operations took off after the second half-year (January-June 1996) of
its operations, with a 230 per cent increase in cargo handling to 295,170
tonnes as compared with the first half-year of business," he said recently.

Dry bulk cargo remains the principal cargo type handled, with 190,010 tonnes
or 64 per cent of the total volume handled during January-June.

The port also handled 99,760 tonnes of breakbulk cargo such as iron and steel,
project cargo, asbestos and hydrated lime which made up 34 per cent of total
throughput.

Mr Kwek said the port's growth reflects the users' growing confidence and the
increasing number of manufacturing industries in Perak.

He reiterated that Lumut port is not competing against Port Klang or Penang
port for cargo but will play a complementary role.

LMT is owned by Perak Development Corp and Halim Rasip Holdings Sdn Bhd, each
holding a 30 per cent stake, and Ipco International, 40 per cent. -MBT

Apply aviation's approach to safety, conference told

from BUSINESS TIMES (Singapore Press Holdings Ltd), 23 Sep 96

By Felix Chan

MARTECH '96

Speaker urges pro-active investments in accident prevention

[SINGAPORE] The aviation industry's emphasis on proactive investments in
accident prevention as opposed to reactive investments in accident cost
reduction should also be applied to shipping, delegates at the Martech '96
conference were told.

Speaking on the final day of the international conference on Maritime Safety
and Environmental Protection, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)
professor E G Frankel said that emphasis should be placed on a limited number
of important maritime issues, instead of casting the "current wide net" of
largely unimportant regulations which dilute the effectiveness of existing
regulations.

Many of the existing regulations address mainly short-term effects or isolated
incidents and are more oriented to publicity and political gain than longer
term improvements in maritime safety and environmental protection, he noted.

He also noted that although the world's maritime community agreed to adopt
certain safety and environmental protection agreements, and introduced port
state control as an enforcing mechanism, the resultant enforcement is
generally quite "lax or non-existent".

"Differential enforcement of international conventions is self-degrading as
ships always gravitate to the flag of lowest enforcement," he told delegates
at the conference on Friday.

Prof Frankel stressed the need for an institution that could act like a world
maritime court with enforcement powers -something akin to a "worldwide UN
coast guard".

"Ocean shipping is an international industry and ships in international waters
should be accountable to international conventions independent of their
national laws. National sovereignty should not extend beyond national
borders," he added.

Other speakers on the final day of the conference include Lloyd's Register of
Shipping's deputy chief surveyor JM Ferguson, who spoke on bulk carrier
safety; and ABS Pacific Singapore's head of safety and environment system
certification R N Chandha, who spoke about auditing to ISM.

Joint bunker venture all set to go / KMP Coastal Oil Pte Ltd, M Zain Wakil
Penghantaran Sdn Bhd

from BUSINESS TIMES (Singapore Press Holdings Ltd), 23 Sep 96

By Yong Mei Fong

KMP Coastal Oil and M Zain Wakil Penghantaran waiting for licence

[SINGAPORE] A bunkering joint-venture between Singapore operator KMP Coastal
Oil Pte Ltd and Malaysian freight forwarding company M Zain Wakil Penghantaran
Sdn Bhd is now awaiting the final step -a licence -before starting to supply
bunkers in Port Klang.

KMP Coastal Oil, a major bunker operator in Singapore handling about one
million tonnes of bunkers a year, holds a 40 per cent stake in the
joint-venture set-up Straits Energy Sdn Bhd.

Its Port-Klang based partner holds the majority share of 60 per cent through
its subsidiary, Fasa Prestij Sdn Bhd.

According to M Zain Wakil Penghantaran director Jason Goh, the joint-venture
company has an initial paid-up capital of M$100,000 (S$56,290). He said the
new company was expected to start operations in the first quarter of next
year.

When licensed, Straits Energy will be among the small handful of about eight
approved operators in the port, of whom only about two are said to be active.

Currently, the volume of bunkers lifted in Malaysia is low, at an estimated
volume of about 200,000 tonnes last year.

Industry sources say because of customs duty imposed on bunkers for ships
plying the domestic trade, Malaysian shipping lines found it uneconomical to
lift bunkers at home and turned to Singapore for their needs.

However, the Malaysian government recently abolished bunker taxes, as part of
an incentive package to promote Port Klang as a cargo load centre. With the
tax lift-off, more shipowners are expected to take bunkers at Malaysian ports,
particularly Port Klang.

No intention to compete with S'pore, but it aims to cut price difference

[SINGAPORE] Despite what the industry says, Port Klang is not likely to be a
major bunker centre like Singapore, nor does it aim to compete with Singapore
on bunkering services, says M Rajasingam, general manager and chief executive
of Klang Port Authority (KPA).

"We have to develop the marine services here and our strategy is to see if we
can provide bunkers at prices which will not make ships calling here look for
another site," he told Shipping Times.

Convenience to the ship and costs were issues that the authority was tackling,
said Mr Rajasingam.

South Korea is already giving Singapore -currently the top bunkering port in
the world -a tough run for its money by offering lower bunker prices. Industry
players say Port Klang is a potential competitor too because it has been
attracting more international lines.

Disputing this, Mr Rajasingam said: "A lot of ships go to Singapore, not for
cargo handling but just for bunkering. I don't think Port Klang will be like
Singapore, a bunker centre, because of the differences in location."

Referring to the port's position next to the Straits of Malacca, he said: "The
sheltered water area is very limited. I don't think we can afford the luxury
of ships coming here just for bunkers."

Given this, the authority was in fact encouraging ships to take bunkers
outside the port limits, under the Malaysian Bunkering Procedure, which would
be issued soon, he said.

Mr Rajasingam also said that bunker prices at Port Klang -at about US$12
(S$16.90) to US$14 more per tonne than at Singapore -were a lot higher. He
hoped to narrow the difference.

"I am not even thinking of matching the price at Singapore, but to bring it
down to about US$3-US$4 more," he said.

"Though it may still be higher, it is better for the ship operator than having
to make an extra trip to another port for bunkers. This will keep the cost of
calling at Port Klang reasonable," he added.

Likewise, said Mr Rajasingam, Port Klang would also work at putting other
support services in place, such as ship chandling, supplies, water, shiprepair
and even professional services like banking and insurance.

Some of land along the port was already alloted by the government for
shipyards, he disclosed. "The idea is that we must provide services to ships
that will make the ship operator say that if I go to Port Klang, there will be
facilities that would take care of my needs."
