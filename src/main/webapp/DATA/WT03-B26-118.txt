<H3>Disturbance By Clearing </H3>
<HR>

<P>
A summary of the relative (%) distribution of the total area of
this landcover type among the four classes of clearing disturbance
is reported in the following table.<HR>

<P>
<B><A NAME="table13"></A>Table 13</B>: A summary of the areas
(km2) in each of the three key disturbance classes for each of
the landcover types of the ILZ. The index Loss was calculated
as the percentage of the total area of each landcover type that
was thinned and cleared. The disturbance score was assigned thus:
no clearing (-); &lt;10% (*); 11-30% (**); &gt;31% (***).

<P>
Only the three critical classes, uncleared, thinned and cleared
are displayed. Where all one landcover was classified as indeterminate,
such as for the grasslands (xG), its disturbance rating was determined
by visual interpretation and reported in <A HREF="chap4c.htm">Disturbance by Grazing</A>.
<P>
For each type, the simplest index of Loss was calculated as the
aggregate area that was either thinned or cleared. This index
was arbitrarily rated and scored thus: &lt; 10% was low (* );
10-30% was moderate (** ); &gt; 30% was substantial ( ***).
<P>
A second index of habitat loss was derived from a measure of the
fragmentation of the remaining uncleared landcover patches. There
are many published indices of landscape pattern and fragmentation;
eg <A HREF="refs.htm">Turner (1990)</A>. However, since robust
relationships between the rate of biotic erosion and landcover
type and degree of fragmentation are lacking, there was little
point in computing complicated measures of landscape pattern;
eg <A HREF="refs.htm">Cale and Hobbs (1994), Hobbs (1994), Murcia (1995)</A>.
<P>
The calculation of the index of fragmentation comprised both objective
and subjective parts. The objective basis was, for each landcover
type, a graphical comparison of the cumulative distribution of
patch size between that mapped in Natural Vegetation, by definition
uncleared, with its contemporary fragmented condition measured
by satellite. This specimen fragmentation chart illustrates the
principles involved.<HR>

<P>
<A NAME="fig4_2"></A><IMG SRC="chart/chap4/specfrag.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM">

<P>
<I>A comparison of the cumulative distribution of proportional
uncleared patch size for the baseline (undisturbed) and contemporary
(fragmented) states. The degree of fragmentation was rated and
scored by the comparison of three curve attributes: ordinate,
slope and asymptote. This example is for the closed forests.</I>
<HR>

<P>
For this landcover type, there are 40 separate occurrences within
the ILZ. These patches are sorted by size, converted to a proportion
of the total area and plotted as a cumulative baseline curve.
The largest patch size alone constituted approximately 25% of
the total area (the ordinate); the next largest patch adds approximately
10% and so forth until the asymptote of 100% is reached with the
last and smallest patch.
<P>
The ordinate (proportion occupied by the largest patch) and the
shape of the curve as it approaches the asymptote express the
size ranks within the ILZ. In this example there are many small
patches; the last twenty patches accounting for just the remaining
20% of the total area.
<P>
The process was repeated for the contemporary uncleared patches.
With clearing, there will be more patches of smaller size than
the baseline set. Sorting these by size and plotting only the
first 40 patches, the same as the undisturbed yields a very different
shaped curve.
<P>
Three comparisons of the two curves indicate the degree of loss
and fragmentation: the ordinate (comparative size of the largest
uncleared patch); the shape of the curve; and the difference in
asymptotes, in this example 70% compared with 100%.
<P>
This simple objective comparison was quite insightful. A highly
cleared and fragmented landcover type will show large ordinate
differences; a flat curve generated by many small patches; and
a large disparity between the endpoints of the two curves. Conversely,
a little fragmented landcover type would return a curve similar
to the baseline. The first three case studies in the <A HREF="content5.htm">Case Studies</A>
are good illustrations of the nature of fragmentation. The graphical
comparison was subjectively rated and scored as either low ( *),
moderate (** ) or substantial (*** ).<HR>
