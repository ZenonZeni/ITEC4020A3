<tr><td> <P>
You are invited to become a member of The Council for Exceptional 
Children (CEC), the largest international professional organization 
dedicated to improving educational outcomes for individuals with 
exceptionalities.  If you are committed to creating positive change in 
the lives of those who have disabilities and/or are gifted, CEC 
membership offers you a wide range of personal and professional benefits you can't
afford to be without.<P>
As a CEC member, you receive:<P>  
<ul><li> <I>TEACHING Exceptional Children</I>, a classroom-oriented magazine that
reports on the latest methods, materials, and programs.<p>
<li><I>Exceptional Children</I>, a research journal that gives you an early 
look at the findings and trends that will change both thinking and 
practice in the years ahead.<P> 
<li><I>CEC Today, </I>a member newsletter that provides news on special 
education at the local, state/provincial, national and international levels.</ul> <P> 

When you join CEC, you also gain access to an active network of more than 52,000
members strong who are special education teachers, administrators, college faculty,
education consultants, students, and parents.  It is easy to connect with others who
face the same challenges that you do.  Whether you are seeking answers to tough
professional problems, or just want to relax with people who understand what you go
through each day, CEC membership puts you in touch with colleagues and friends in
your local area. <p>

CEC helps you boost your skills with networking and career development opportunities.
Members attend CEC professional development programs at special rates, and receive
early notice and special invitations to the annual international conventions, topical
conferences, and workshops. The CEC Annual Convention alone features more than
650 sessions.  Special projects managed by CEC provide essential training programs,
materials, planning, and continuing education opportunities. <P>

Only CEC membership affords the opportunity to join one or more of the <a href="/dv-menu.htm">17 CEC Divisions </a>, allowing members to tailor participation to their
particular area(s) of expertise.  CEC Divisions publish their own journals and
newsletters, and offer a variety of unique activities and workshops, as well as sessions
at the CEC Annual Convention. <P>

As a CEC member, you advocate for the rights of children and youth with
exceptionalities, as well as the special needs of those who teach them.  CEC's
volunteer activists and Headquarters staff are the major voice in Congress, the courts,
and the U.S. Department of Education.  CEC was instrumental in passing such
important legislation as The Education for All Handicapped Children Act (presently
known as IDEA), the Javits Gifted and Talented Students Act, and The Americans with
Disabilities Act (ADA).   <P>

The professional resources, discounts, and
career advancement opportunities CEC dues bring are priceless and translate to just
pennies a day!
