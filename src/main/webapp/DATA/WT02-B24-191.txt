<P>
<H3>How long have you been in business?
</H3><P>The Center for Surrogate Parenting &amp; Egg Donation, Inc. has been
in business since 1980.
<P>
<H3>How many births have you had?
</H3><P>The Center is proud of the hundreds of births we have been involved
in since 1980. &#160;At any given time, we have dozens of surrogates pregnant
with their couples eagerly awaiting the birth of their children.
<P>
<H3>What programs do you offer?<BR>
</H3><UL><LI>Traditional Surrogacy (AI)
<LI>Gestational Surrogacy (IVF)
<LI>Egg Donation (ED)
</UL><P>
<H3>Will I meet my couple?
</H3><P>The Center runs an "open" program. &#160;This means that you will
meet your couple prior to any medical procedures being undertaken. &#160;In
our program, you will choose your couple and the couple will choose you.
&#160;You couple participates in the pregnancy as much as is comfortable
for you, e.g. going to doctor's appointments, attends the birth, and sends
photos to you after birth.
<P>
<H3>Have you ever had a surrogate mother change her mind and keep the baby?
</H3><P>No. The actual number of cases in the entire country that have gone
to court are a tiny handful (actually less than 17). None of these have come
from our program.
<P>
<H3>Has a couple ever refused to take their child?
</H3><P>No. &#160;We have had three cases where the child was born with birth
defects. &#160;No couple has refused to take their child, despite the birth
defects.
<P>
<H3>Are couples medically and psychologically screened?
</H3><P>Both couples and surrogate mothers are medically and psychologically
screened in our program.
<P>
<H3>How do I know my couple can afford the costs involved?
</H3><P>The Center is very concerned about protecting our surrogate mothers
and their families against any unpaid bills. &#160;The Center holds full
trust funds sufficient to cover your fees and expenses throughout the pregnancy.
&#160;These funds are&#160;deposited into your trust account before you begin
working together.
<P>
<H3>How many staff members do you have?
</H3><P>Eight staff members plus four full time independent counselors.
