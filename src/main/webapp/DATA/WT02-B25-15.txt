	DSN ANNOUNCES UPGRADES TO THE NETFORTRESS INTRANET SECURITY SOLUTION
	</font>
	<p>
	New release with fully automated policing capabilities, increased speed and
	improved protection to be demonstrated at Fall Internet World 96.
	<P>
	December 11, 1996, Englewood Cliffs, NJ.  Digital Secured Networks
	Technology, Inc. (DSN) announces speed and protection upgrades, and the
	addition of some key automated firewall capabilities to its new Intranet
	security solution, the NetFortress.  DSN will demonstrate the enhanced
	NetFortress at Fall Internet World 96, December 11-13, 1996 in the New York
	City Javits Convention Center, booth 1537/1545 near America Online.
	<P>
	The NetFortress is an easy to install and fully automated hardware solution.
	It automatically seals off all unwanted communications to a corporate LAN
	while encrypting and authenticating all authorized communications to other
	NetFortress protected hosts.  Scrambled streams of data are generated with
	complete transparency to users and administrators, and with no cost to
	network performance.  
	
	New features of the enhanced NetFortress include:
	<ol>
	<li>Some built in firewall functionality.  The Segmented NetFortress allows
	users to surf the web or email outside the Intranet to non-NetFortress
	protected hosts.  While allowing access outside the Intranet, the Segmented
	NetFortress denies all unauthorized access to the Intranet.  Only an
	authorized NetFortress protected user can initiate contact to another
	NetFortress protected user.
	<p>
	<li>Encryption/decryption integrity checking:  The NetFortress ensures data
	integrity in transit and proper encryption and decryption of messages.
	<p>
	<li>Throughput speed increased to 2.5 times T1 speed:   The NetFortress now
	uses a new Pentium board for faster processing.  
	</ol>
	<p>
	"Everyday market demand grows for security solutions that offer improved
	protection, speed and ease of use," said DSN's chief executive officer, Mr.
	Raymond Weadock.  "The announced upgrades demonstrate DSN's superior
	understanding, commitment and ability to supply corporate clients with
	leading-edge security solutions that meet their needs."
	<p>
	DSN technical engineers will be available at Internet World to demonstrate
	and discuss the upgraded NetFortress.  To schedule an appointment, please
	contact DSN public relations manager Jo Lee at 201-568-3232 or <a href="mailto:jo@dsnt.com">jo@dsnt.com</a>.

	Established in 1995, Digital Secured Networks Technology, Inc. (DSN) is a
	privately held company with breakthrough technology for securing corporate
	Intranets.
