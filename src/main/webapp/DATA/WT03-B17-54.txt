<H2><center>Controlled Drinking, Relapse, and Sobriety:  Where do We Start?</center></H2><p>
A recent survey of 270 young people and 300 parents conducted by the Hazelden Institute revealed that 79 percent of teenagers indicated that they drink or use drugs because they like the feeling of being drunk or high.  Sixty-seven percent of the teens said they drink or use because it helps them forget their problems.  While new drugs hit the market every day, alcohol still appears to be the number one choice of substances that teens use and abuse.  Some treatment providers and researchers suggest that young people who experiment with alcohol are more likely to get hooked on harder drugs such as cocaine.<p>
		Substance abuse -- be the substance alcohol or any other drug -- is a common problem among college students.  While some students do develop the abuse patterns in college, many students enter college with substance abuse behaviors.  Once in college, those behaviors may be exacerbated by social pressures in peer groups.  However, once in college those behaviors might also be stopped.  College provides a unique experience whereby students live with peers.  Peers who identify friends with substance abuse behaviors can intervene and help the friends stop unhealthy behavior patterns. <p>
		Jack Mullin, aftercare specialist at Hanley Hazelden Center at St. Mary's in West Palm Beach, FL, points out that  "Chemical dependency is chronic."   He contends that substance abuse treatment is effective, but those with chemical dependency problems must first admit that the dependency is beyond their control.  Some substance abusers think they can work toward controlled drinking, rather than ceasing drinking all together.  Many treatment providers in the substance abuse field suggest that controlled drinking is a myth;  the symptoms of the chemical dependency will return if someone who is chemically dependent tries controlled drinking.   "The idea that somehow, someday he [she] will control and enjoy his [her] drinking is the obsession of every abnormal drinker"  says Mike Schiks, executive vice president of Recovery Services for Hazelden in Center City, MN. <p>
		How do you decide if someone is a problem drinker or an alcoholic?  There is no test that will delineate when someone has crossed the fine line between problem drinking and alcoholism.  Sometimes that crossing is obvious.  More often, a comprehensive assessment will be needed to determine if an individual is abusing, having problems with, or is addicted to a substance. Mike Schiks points out that  "We can say that heavy drinking episodes may be symptomatic of the early stage of alcoholism or that they are symptomatic of other life issues that need to be resolved or they will put the person at risk for alcoholism."  <p>
		What do you think?  Can you drink moderately?  How about your friends ... can they?  If you identify that at times you near the line between problem drinking and addiction, respect yourself enough to acknowledge it and seek help.  The Counseling and Student Development Center is always available to help.  Our number is 726-3849;  we're located in 310 Briggs.<br>

<H3><CENTER>DSM-IV Diagnostic Criteria for Alcohol Abuse</CENTER></H3><p>
A.	A maladaptive pattern of alcohol use leading to clinically significant impairment or distress, as manifested by one (or more) of the following occurring within a 12-month period:<p>

1)  	recurrent drinking resulting in a failure to fulfill major role obligations at work, school, or home<br>
2) 	recurrent drinking in situation in which it is physically hazardous<br>
3) 	recurrent alcohol-related legal problems<br>
4) 	continued alcohol use despite having persistent or recurrent social or interpersonal problems caused or exacerbated by the effects of alcohol.
<p>
B.	The symptoms have never met the criteria for alcohol dependence.<p><p>
<H3><center>What is a "Standard" Drink?</center></H3><p>
		Not all drinks are created equal. The alcohol found in beer, wine, and distilled spirits is <I>ethanol</I>.  A standard drink contains one-half ounce of ethanol -- the amount you would find in a 12-ounce beer; a one-ounce shot of 100-proof distilled spirits, or a four-ounce glass of table wine.  Generally, this is the amount of ethanol which an individual can metabolize in about an hour.<p>
		This is important information because some drinks may have more than one-half ounce of alcohol,  meaning that some drinks are equivalent to more than one drink.  For example, some wine coolers have nearly twice the alcohol content of a "standard" drink.  This is good to keep in mind as you set the number of drinks you will consume in an time period.  It's also good to remember as you compute how much ethanol you can metabolize given your body size!<p>
		Also, it is important to remember that experts recommend sipping drinks as opposed to gulping them or "slamming" them.<br>

<H3><center>Can You Afford to Drink and Drive?</center></H3><p>
<ul>
<li>The legal limit of blood alcohol concentration (BAC) when operating an automobile for persons age 21 and over is 0.10 in Tennessee and most other states.  <BLINK>If you are under 21, the legal limit for BAC is 0.02.</BLINK>  One "standard" drink can put your BAC at or above 0.02!
<li>In Tennessee ( and many other states) if you are stopped and requested to take a sobriety test, you can lose your license by refusing to take the test.  Yes, you will get your license back, but you'll have to pay some high fees to do so.
<li>Get this:  the cost of your first DUI  (and remember DUI doesn't just mean BAC over 0.10, it also can mean driving while under the influence of any intoxicating substance), could run more than $6,000.  Not to mention time out of school/work for court appearances, time in jail, and increased insurance costs!  
<li>On your first DUI, your insurance rates could double your current rate.
<li>Repeated arrests for DUI can result in your permanent loss of a driver's license.  Each subsequent DUI conviction carries higher penalties and increased jail time.
<li>U.S.A. penalties for DUI are mild compared to some other countries.  In Turkey, drunk drivers are taken 20 miles outside of town and forced to walk back under police escort.  In South Africa, a DUI conviction could result in a 10-year prison sentence or $10,000 fine, or both.<br>
