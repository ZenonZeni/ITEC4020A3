When she was almost 40, Designing Women star Annie Potts known to fans over the show’s 7-year run as the pragmatic Mary Jo Shively wanted to have another baby, but discovered she couldn’t get pregnant.  She worried that she might be infertile. No problem. After a few false starts with conventional doctors, she’d find that alternative medicine could help her out again as it had so many times before.<p>
Ever since she broke nearly every bone below her waist in a dramatic car accident when she was 21, Annie Potts had been designing her health using the best that alternative medicine had to offer, from reflexology to chiropractic, yoga to Pilates Method physical therapy, herbs to Chinese medicine. Annie’s faith was well-placed because, 4 months after consulting Dr. Y.C. Chiang, O.M.D., master acupuncturist of El Cerrito, California, she was pregnant. That baby was Jake; when Annie was 43, she gave birth to another child, again with the aid of Chinese herbs from Dr. Chiang.<p>
In this last pregnancy, I used Chinese medicine the whole time,” says Annie, in her trademark  Kentucky twang. “I bounced back so quickly. I was back at the gym only 3 weeks after my baby was born. I’m only 5 pounds over my weight before I got pregnant, and I feel great.” When you know the Annie Potts story, which is a 23-year odyssey toward health, using alternative medicine against considerable odds, you’ll appreciate how much dedication “feeling great” has taken.<p>

<br>

<b>MENDING AN ACTRESS’ BROKEN BONES</b><br>
Annie is no stranger to the process of finding her own answers to her health problems. Just before her 21st birthday, on her way to perform at a high school assembly as part of her work with the New Mexico State Theater, drag-racing drunk drivers ran full speed into her car. When Annie woke up in the hospital, she found that, with one exception, every bone in her body below the waist was broken.“That accident almost obliterated my legs,” says Annie. <p>
Her budding acting career now in doubt, Annie left the hospital happy to be alive, but had to ask herself a hard question. “What do I do with this old person’s body that I have suddenly inherited at 21?” Doctors had put her in traction for 2 months in an attempt to get her thigh bone to reknit as the accident had created a 2-inch gap in her femur. When this didn’t work, they did a bone graft, harvesting the bone from her pelvis by cutting through the muscles of her lower back. This created another set of problems, but at least she could walk. <p>
From that moment onward, keeping her body functioning became a lifetime process for Annie. It didn’t make her acting career a breeze, either; she just had to work twice as hard. With chronic pain and traumatic arthritis caused by the injuries, her task has been formidable. “Every day I wake up and it’s ‘Houston, we’ve got a problem,’” comments Annie wryly. “It takes me half an hour to work all the kinks out of my body.”<p>
Over her years of productive acting, Annie designed and continually updated the maintenance program that keeps her injuries from ruling her life. Early on, she turned to yoga, which is well known for its therapeutic benefits. “For me, yoga is medicine,” Annie says. “I had a wonderful teacher—it was like finding a good doctor.” In the years following her accident, Annie relied on yoga and swimming to keep her flexible and strong<p>. 
Then she broadened her scope of therapies,  seeing a chiropractor, massage therapist, reflexologist, and acupuncturist. But it was Annie’s difficulties in getting pregnant in her late 30s and her frustration with conventional approaches that completely affirmed her allegiance to alternative medicine. <p>
By this time, Annie Potts had made a name for herself. To fans of Designing Women, a highly popular CBS show that ran from 1987-1994, she was like family. Arriving in Los Angeles in 1975 with a road production of “Charlie’s Aunt,” starring opposite Vincent Price and Roddy McDowall, Annie went on to appear in such films as King of the Gypsies, Ghostbusters I and II—she played the sardonic secretary—Pretty in Pink, and Texasville—here she stole the show as Jeff Bridges’ sassy spouse. Annie won a Genie Award (Canada’s Oscar) for “best performance by a foreign actress” for her role in the film, Heartaches. When Designing Women closed up shop, Annie landed the lead female role in another CBS sitcom, Love and War, for which she received an Emmy nomination. <p>
Throughout her public success, few of her fans knew how much daily effort it required or to what degree alternative medicine had eased Annie’s way.<p>

<br>

<b>ANNIE’S FERTILITY NIGHTMARE</b><br>
Even though she had given birth to a son named Clay 15 years earlier, somehow in the intervening years Annie had become seemingly infertile. At 39, she wanted another child. She spent a year trying to conceive, but was unsuccessful. When she consulted conventional physicians, they put her on Clomid (clomiphene citrate, a drug prescribed to reverse “ovulatory failure”). They reassured her that only 2% of women experience the negative side effects of abdominal discomfort, uterine bleeding, breast tenderness, depression, dizziness, and about 14 others. Annie found she was one of the unlucky 2%. <p>
I nearly went insane,” Annie reflects. “I never had PMS in my life before this. Suddenly I became somebody I didn’t recognize. I had terrible mood swings, weeping, and hot flashes in the middle of the night. I’d wake up and the sheets would be soaked from my sweating. It was awful.” Annie wanted a baby so much that she endured this state of nonstop PMS for 6 months. But still she wasn’t pregnant. Her  doctors had an even more upsetting drug for her to try—Pergonal®. In effect, it would be a bizarre form of urine therapy. <p>
Pergonal is an injectable drug containing gonadotropins (hormones for the gonads—in this case, ovaries) purified from the urine of postmenopausal women. Annie’s doctors believed this drug would stimulate her system to produce multiple eggs which could then be fertilized in a test tube. They told her that of the 7 or 8 eggs that would be incubated, usually only 2 take; if 3 or more took, then they would eliminate the surplus by  “selective reduction.”<p>
That phrase chilled me,” Annie says. “In my heart I felt that surely there must be another way to achieve the same end.” There was, but she wouldn’t find it until she gave up on conventional doctors and went in search of alternative medicine. Then she finally got the baby she wanted. <p>

<br>

<b>CHINESE HERBS MAKE THE DIFFERENCE</b><br>
Dr. Chiang had a reputation for solving health problems against which others had failed. During their first consultation, as he sat with his fingers on her wrist reading her pulse, Annie waited anxiously for his analysis. Finally she asked him, “Do you think I can have another baby?” Dr. Chiang’s answer was yes, and it should take only about one month to get pregnant.<p>
It actually took 4 months because Dr. Chiang first had to balance and strengthen Annie’s organs and energy pathways with acupuncture. Then he gave her a combination of fertility herbs in pill and powder form, including, among others, white peony root, plantain seed, wolfberry fruit, licorice root, raspberry fruit, and glossy privet fruit. When she <p>
didn’t get pregnant in the first few months, Dr. Chiang put Annie’s husband, TV director Jim Hayman, on herbs as well. Then Annie was pregnant in a month. <p>
After Jake’s birth, Dr. Chiang gave Annie another herbal preparation to strengthen both her and the nursing baby. This formula contained white peony root, licorice root, and glossy privet fruit, along with lily bulb, codonopsis root, pinellia rhizome, ginger, citrus peel, and black jujube date. Dr. Chiang’s herbs helped her recover quickly, but carrying the extra weight of a 9-pound baby had taken its toll on Annie’s legs. It was time to consult alternative medicine’s natural pharmacy for a new remedy. <p>

<br>

<b>RESTORING LOST BONE DENSITY</b><br>
Annie found the answer to her declining leg strength in the Pilates® Method, a form of physical therapy and conditioning. Practicing its exercises eased the arthritic stiffness and improved her stooping posture. Ever since her accident, one leg had been 2 inches shorter than the other; that and having had her back muscles cut down to the bone on the same side had put a stoop in her gait. <p>
The Pilates exercises strengthened Annie in the ways she needed. From here, her renewed strength allowed her to start lifting weights. Knowing that women over 40 tend to lose bone density, Annie was concerned that, with all her broken bones, this would likely be a big problem for her. When she learned that weight lifting helps increase bone density, Annie headed for the gym. <p>
One of her leg fractures had never healed; worse, she had reinjured it. Yet, after hoisting weights for 18 months, her bone density was actually increasing, which meant her leg was healing—and she had an X-ray to prove it. “My medical specialist was stunned,” reports Annie. “He’d never seen anything like that. I’m going to pump iron for the rest of my life.” Recently, she added boxing to her regimen of physical exercises as a way to keep her weight trim and stay light on her legs. <p>
When you have a body with a history like Annie’s, health care can take a lot of your time. “My body is definitely a high maintenance proposition,” she admits with a laugh. But that high-maintenance body has kept her open to alternatives that work, such as Chinese medicine. <p>
Since her pregnancy success, Annie has become something of a missionary for alternative medicine. She spends a couple of hours every week on the phone with women her age who are trying to get pregnant. “I always send them to the doctors of Chinese medicine because conventional medicine has made them ‘insane.’ The drugs are so harsh.”<p>
Meanwhile, Annie keeps consulting with Dr. Chiang. “I talked to him last night,” she confides. Her arthritis was acting up under the rainy winter weather of Southern California at the same time she was getting ready to start filming a new show. <p>
I told Dr. Chiang I was still nursing my baby,” says Annie, “and as I would be working 15 hours a day, I needed lots of energy. He said, ‘That’s okay, I will send you some herbs.’”<p>
