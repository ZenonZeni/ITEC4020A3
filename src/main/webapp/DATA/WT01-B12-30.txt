 <IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> IMPORTANT NUTRIENT </H2>

<P>  Maintaining good levels of both calcium and magnesium is essential. They may be the most important nutrients required by man yet they are quite often deficient. In every muscle of our body, calcium and magnesium enjoy a reciprocal relationship.  Calcium stimulates the muscles to contract and magnesium helps them relax. When we are deficient in calcium, we can borrow from vast reserves in our bones, but when we get low in magnesium we obtain it from our muscles. As magnesium  disappears from the muscles, calcium rushes in and the muscles tend to become tense or cramp and we feel tired.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> MULTIPLE SOURCES</H2>
<P>Different individuals  absorb different kinds of magnesium better than others. HYDRO MAG is formulated in such a way that it contains a unique combination of various, most highly bio-available forms of magnesium.</P>
<P>  Magnesium  deficiencies  result  in  excessive stress, high blood pressure, muscle cramps and spasms, fatigue, restlessness, irritability, depression, apathy, tremors, migraine headaches in pregnant women, asthma in young adults, severe tetanus and heart disease.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> RECIPROCAL RELATIONSHIP</H2>
<P>  Many researchers believe a lack of magnesium may cause muscles of the arterial and venous walls to contract, causing high blood pressure, heart attacks and strokes.</P>
<P>  A prominent researcher has found that magnesium helps to prevent migraine headaches in pregnant women. There is a tremendous demand for magnesium for the developing fetus. It has been estimated that these women only get 50 to 60 percent of the RDA of magnesium in their diets.  Research  has  also  shown  that  women experiencing PMS had lower levels of magnesium in their  red  blood  cells  and  concluded  that  many premenstrual symptoms may be caused by a magnesium deficiency.</P>
<P>We are inundated with large amounts of sodium in our diets.  It is a hidden "nutrient" in just about all processed foods, since many times we don't even know it is present. Even though we need a small amount of sodium, excesses are well known to contribute to atherosclerosis and high blood pressure.  Research in Scandinavia has recently been published that proves that the addition of magnesium to the diet can offset some of the damaging effects of sodium.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> WHY WE ARE DEFICIENT</H2>
<P>  Every step in the chain of modern chemical farming and food processing depletes our food of magnesium.  Chemical fertilizers used in agriculture today do not replace the lost magnesium. Unfortunately, nearly forty percent of the magnesium content of our foods leaches out when they are cooked.</P>
<P>  Some foods such as meat, ice cream and other "high fat" foods can cause a phenomenon known to scientists as "the magnesium trap."   These foods are low in magnesium themselves, but the primary problem is that they actually impair absorption of magnesium through the intestinal wall.</P>
<P>   Several medications such as certain diuretics used in the treatment of high blood pressure may cause the loss of magnesium from the body. Studies have shown that individuals with a low serum magnesium level required more anti-hypertensive drugs for the same degree of control of their blood pressure than those with normal magnesium levels. </P>
<P>  A French study found that magnesium deficiency results in calcium deposits building up in the blood vessels as well.   The researchers concluded that magnesium  deficiency  may  contribute  to  the accumulation  of fats  within  the  arterial  walls (atherosclerosis).   A leading researcher at Howard University has found that people who have had a heart attack have low blood levels of magnesium. Others have found that the heart muscle of those who have died from heart attacks have lower levels of magnesium in the heart than in other muscles in their bodies. Some foods high in magnesium include spinach, cabbage, tomatoes, bananas, and some fish such as salmon.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HOW TO TAKE HYDRO MAG</H2>
<P>  Dissolve contents of each 50 gm packet in 16 ounces of warm water and store in the refrigerator. The usual recommended amount is one or two tablespoonfuls per day.  One tablespoonful provides 100% of the RDA for magnesium. Some people seem to feel better when they take two or more.  Stir into three or four ounces of tomato or other vegetable juice. Most people prefer to take it at bedtime because they notice a natural relaxing effect.  Some individuals may notice loose stools when they take magnesium. If you do, simply stop taking it for two days and start back with one teaspoonful and build back up. It will usually go away when you adjust to it.</P>
<P>Both calcium and magnesium are very important. If you want to concentrate on calcium, you can take <A HREF="mcandy.htm">CANDY CAL</A>. If you want just magnesium. you can take <A HREF="mmag.htm">MAGNESIUM  PLUS Tablets </A> or HYDRO MAG Liquid.  If you want to take calcium and magnesium together, rely on <A HREF="mcalmag.htm">CALMAG PLUS</A>.

<p>Suggested Use: One or two tablespoonfuls once or twice a day, usually in water, tomato or vegetable juice depending on the amount of magnesium desired.</P>
