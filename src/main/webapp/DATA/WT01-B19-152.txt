<BR><DD>On May 25, 1994, an indictment by The Riverside County Grand
Jury was filed charging appellant with transporting, importing, selling,
furnishing, giving away, or offering to transport, import, sell, furnish,
administer, give away or attempting to import or transport more than 28.5
grams of marijuana.&nbsp; (Health &amp; Saf. Code, &sect; 11360, subd. (a); count one.)&nbsp; Appellant was also charged with possession of marijuana for sale.&nbsp; (Health &amp; Saf. Code, &sect; 11359; count two.)&nbsp; (CT 1-2.)
<DD>On April 11, 1995, appellant waived jury trial and proceeded by way of a court trial.&nbsp; (CF 219.)&nbsp; On May 19, appellant was found guilty on both counts.&nbsp; (CT 266.)
<DD>On July 10, 1995, appellant was granted five years probation.&nbsp; Among the terms and conditions of probation imposed, appellant was required to serve 240 days in jail, not to possess or use any controlled substances unless medically prescribed, and not to associate with any unrelated person known to be a possessor, user, or trafficker of controlled substances.&nbsp; (CT 271.)&nbsp; That same day, appellant filed his notice of appeal.&nbsp; (CT 273A.)

<CENTER><B><U><A NAME="FACTS">STATEMENT OF FACTS</A></U></B></CENTER><BR>
<DD>On March 27, 1994, appellant was driving his BMW through the Temecula
border patrol checkpoint when he was stopped at the primary inspection
area.&nbsp; (CT 19-26<SMALL><SUP><A HREF="peck-rb4.html#1"><U>1</U></A>/</SUP></SMALL>.)&nbsp; Appellant's BMW was directed to the secondary inspection area where a canine sniff was conducted.&nbsp; (CT 19-21.)&nbsp; The dog alerted to the presence of contraband.&nbsp; (CT 22.)
<DD>Appellant initially refused to provide the border patrol agents the keys to his trunk, but then relented.&nbsp; (CT 23.)&nbsp; Inside the trunk, the agents found two duffle bags containing a total of 40 one-pound packages of marijuana.&nbsp; (CT 23-24.)
<DD>Appellant told the agents he was coming front the Alpine area of San Diego County.&nbsp; (CT 26.)&nbsp; Rolling papers were found on appellant's person, and $2,350 was found under the dashcover inside the BMW.&nbsp; (CT 27, 39.)&nbsp; After appellant was given his <I>Miranda</I><SMALL><SUP><A HREF="peck-rb4.html#2"><U>2</U></A>/</SUP></SMALL> rights, he spontaneously told Joel Ontiveros, a sheriff's investigator, that the passenger in his car, Bret Corey Mixcel, wasn't involved with the &quot;stuff&quot; in his car, that it was all &quot;my stuff [i.e., appellant's].&quot; (CT 30, 35, 37, 41.)
<DD>Sheriff's Investigator Ontiveros provided his expert opinion based on his training and experience that the 40 pounds of marijuana appellant was transporting was Mexican grown and was possessed for purposes of selling. (CT 41-42.)&nbsp; He estimated the wholesale value of the marijuana to be $40,000 and the retail value at $360,000 to $3.6 million dollars.&nbsp; (CT 43.)&nbsp; It was important to Ontiveros' opinion about appellant possessing the marijuana for sale that the marijuana was broken down into one-pound increments which makes re-sale easier.&nbsp; (CT 43-44.)
<DD>Appellant testified he is a priest of the Israel Zion Coptic Church; there are only 24 members of this church in the entire state of Wisconsin and they are the members of appellant's family and the family of his friend,
Michael Matteson.&nbsp; (RT 319-320, 326-327; CT 71, 114<SMALL><SUP><A HREF="peck-rb4.html#3"><U>3</U></A>/</SUP></SMALL>.)&nbsp; His church is incorporated in the state of Wisconsin.&nbsp; (CT 71, 114.)&nbsp; Appellant estimated the total membership of the Israel Zion Coptic Church from Florida, Massachusetts, North Carolina and elsewhere (including men, women and children) as between 200-250 members.&nbsp; (CT 74.)&nbsp; The Israel Zion Coptic Church is an offshoot of the Rastafarian
movement and the Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church.&nbsp; (RT 334-342; CT 84.)&nbsp; The Israel Zion Coptic's doctrine incorporates the use of marijuana (referred to as &quot;ganja&quot;) as a sacrament used during religious services and gatherings.&nbsp; (CT 71-73, 114.)
<DD>Appellant was arrested in 1987 in Wisconsin for growing marijuana.&nbsp; (RT 392-393.)&nbsp; One of the conditions of his probation in Wisconsin was not to grow marijuana anymore.&nbsp; (RT 393-393.)&nbsp; Because of this probation condition, appellant decided to travel to San Diego to purchase
marijuana for the church's use.&nbsp; (RT 391-394.)&nbsp; About $30,000 was collected between appellant and two friends from Iowa to make the purchase.&nbsp; (RT 391, 349.)&nbsp; Appellant drove to San Diego and purchased the 40 pounds of marijuana.&nbsp; (RT 400-402.)&nbsp; He was stopped at the Temecula checkpoint while driving back to Wisconsin.<SMALL><SUP><A HREF="peck-rb4.html#4"><U>4</U></A>/</SUP></SMALL>

<B>SUBSTANTIAL EVIDENCE SUPPORTS APPELLANT'S CONVICTION ON COUNT TWO, POSSESSION OF MARIJUANA FOR SALE</B>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<DD>Appellant argues there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction on count two, possession of marijuana for sale, in violation of Health and Safety Code section 11359.&nbsp; (AOB 5.)&nbsp; More specifically, appellant argues the evidence did not show he intended to sell the marijuana, but only to give it away as a sacrament in his church.&nbsp; (AOB 5.)&nbsp; Appellant's argument should be rejected for at least four reasons: (1) "sale" includes "non-cash benefits" and appellant was seeking to obtain the non-cash benefit of new adherents to his church in exchange for giving them marijuana; (2) appellant through his own testimony revealed he was to receive an additional amount of marijuana in-kind for his actions of purchasing and delivering these pounds of marijuana; (3) appellant has failed to rebut the inference, created by virtue of the large amount of marijuana he possessed, that the marijuana was possessed for sale; and (4) circumstantial evidence (regarding packaging, and appellant's possession of $2,350 in cash) led Sheriff's Investigator Joel Ontiveros to state his expert opinion that appellant possessed the marijuana for purposes of sale.
<DD>In considering a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence, the
appellate court must review the record in the light most favorable to the
judgment below to determine whether the record discloses substantial
evidence from which a reasonable trier of fact could find the defendant
guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.&nbsp; (<I>Jackson v. Virginia</I> (1979) 443 U.S. 307, 319 [61 L.Ed.2d 560, 99 S.Ct. 2781]; <I>People v. Johnson</I> (1980) 26 Cal.3d 557, 578; <I>People v. Olguin</I> (1994) 31 Cal.App.4th 1355, 1382.)
<DD>Although the appellate court must ensure the evidence is reasonable, credible, and of solid value, it is the exclusive province of the trier of fact to determine the credibility of a witness and the truth or falsity of the facts upon which the determination depends.&nbsp; (<I>People v. Barnes</I> (1986) 42 Cal.3d 284, 303.)&nbsp; The appellate court must also draw all reasonable inferences from the evidence which support the trier of
fact's verdict.&nbsp; (<I>People v. Alcala</I> (1984) 36 Cal.3d 604, 623; <I>People v. Hernandez</I> (1990) 219 Cal.App.3d 1177, 1181.)&nbsp; The same standard applies where the People rely primarily on circumstantial evidence.&nbsp; (<I>People v. Perez</I> (1992) 2 Cal.4th 1117, 1124.)&nbsp; Although it is the trier of fact's duty to acquit a defendant if it finds the circumstantial evidence is susceptible of two interpretations, one which suggests guilt and the other innocence, it is the trier of fact, not the appellate court which must be convinced of the defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.&nbsp; (<I>Ibid</I>.)&nbsp; "If the circumstances reasonably justify the trier of fact's findings, the opinion of the reviewing court that the circumstances might also be reasonably reconciled with a contrary finding does not warrant a reversal of the judgment."&nbsp; (<I>Ibid</I>.)&nbsp; Thus, the relevant inquiry on appeal is whether any rational trier of fact could have found the elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.&nbsp; (<I>Jackson v. Virginia</I>, <I>supra</I>, 443 U.S. at p. 319; <I>People v. Lucero</I> (1988) 44 Cal.3d 1006, 1020; <I>People v. Hernandez</I>, <I>supra</I>, 219 Cal.App.3d at p. 1182.)

<P>
<DD>At sentencing, the court made the following relevant comments with regards to count two, possession for sale of marijuana:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<DD>"[THE COURT]:&nbsp; I cannot stress how significant the Court found your testimony about the whole series of transactions and thought that went into the decision to leave the state of Wisconsin and its neighboring states and journey over a thousand miles to Southern California to acquire the marijuana which you were going to transport back.
<DD>".......................
<DD>"You are going to be punished in this case [not because of] your involvement with this drug as part of your religion ... but because of your involvement with this drug as part of a commerce of marijuana users.&nbsp; <U>The amount of 40 pounds, the sum of money of $28,000 are not insignificant amounts in the Court's eyes</U>, nor do I think in the eyes of the community.&nbsp; This doesn't look like just Gregory Peck trying to practice his religion.&nbsp; <U>This is Gregory Peck supplying others with marijuana at a particular price as part of the kind of money changing</U> that another revolutionary took offense to when he picked up a whip and drove the money changers from the temple.&nbsp; There are things that occur in a religious context that are not religious, and that's how I view the evidence in this case."&nbsp; (RT 533-535; emphasis added.)
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B><A NAME="IB">B</A>.&nbsp; <U>Analysis</U></B>
<P>
<DD>Appellant's argument there is insufficient evidence to sustain his conviction of possession for sale of marijuana should be rejected for at least the following four reasons:
<DD>First, the meaning of "sale" within Health and Safety Code section 11359 has been greatly expanded after issuance of the opinion in <I>People v. Lazenby</I> (1992) 6 Cal.App.4th 1842.&nbsp; CALJIC No. 12.21 (Marijuana -- Illegal Possession For Sale) was revised in 1993 in light of <I>Lazenby</I> to define "sale" as "any exchange of marijuana for cash, favors, services, goods or other non-cash benefits."&nbsp; <I>Lazenby</I> looked back at 
former Health and Safety Code section 11008 which included "barter, exchange, or gift" within the definition of "sale."&nbsp; (<I>People v. Lazenby</I>, <I>supra</I>, 6 Cal.App.4th at p. 1845.)&nbsp; <I>Lazenby</I> noted that when former section 11008 was repealed in 1972 to bring California into substantial conformity with federal law, there was no indication the Legislature sought to prohibit only sales for cash.&nbsp; (<I>Ibid</I>.)&nbsp; The conclusion that "sale" includes transfers other than for money comports with the evident purposes of the California legislation, the commonly accepted meaning of the term and settled rules of statutory interpretation.&nbsp; (<I>Ibid</I>.)
<DD>It is clear from his testimony that appellant intended to provide at least some of the 40 pounds of marijuana to others who were not members of his church.&nbsp; (RT 356-357, 387-389, 394-399, 405-408, 412-413.)&nbsp; In return, appellant was seeking to obtain new adherents to his church because in his words there could be no faith without the marijuana.&nbsp; (RT 356-358, 385-388, 405-408.)&nbsp; Such an exchange is certainly a "non-cash benefit" within the meaning of the jury instruction.
<DD>Second, it is plain appellant was receiving physical and tangible
benefit from the exchange of the maftjuana.&nbsp; Specifically, appellant was receiving more marijuana.&nbsp; Appellant testified he took $30,000 to
purchase the marijuana in San Diego.&nbsp; (RT 391, 394.)&nbsp; Of that money, only $4,000 was his own.&nbsp; (RT 394.)&nbsp; Yet, appellant testified he was to receive <U>one-third</U> of the total amount of marijuana.&nbsp; (RT 404.)&nbsp; As the lower court noted at sentencing, appellant was "supplying others with marijuana at a particular price <U>as part of the kind of money changing</U> ..."&nbsp; (RT 534; emphasis added.)&nbsp; This exchange of marijuana had no spiritual element to it.&nbsp; A more precise definition of this transaction is probably "barter."&nbsp; It is common for drug dealers to receive payment in kind.&nbsp; Although it is sometimes difficult to tell in such situations who is the buyer and who is the seller, this type of exchange of marijuana for something of value is precisely what the law was intended to prohibit.
<DD>Third, appellant acknowledges that possession of a large amount of a controlled substance itself affords a reasonable inference of possession for sale.&nbsp; (AOB 7; <I>People v. Goliday</I> (1973) 8 Cal.3d 771, 783-784; <I>People v. Ingram</I> (1981) 122 Cal.App.3d 673, 681; <I>People v. Grant</I> (1969) 1 Cal.App.3d 563, 570.)&nbsp; Appellant then attempts to rebut this inference by pointing to his own self-serving testimony about how he intended to give the marijuana to the members of his church for their
use of it as a sacrament.&nbsp; (AOB 6-7; RT 405-407.)&nbsp; However, since "sale" is not limited to the exchange of marijuana for cash (see <I>People v. Lazenby</I>, <I>supra</I>, 6 Cal.App.4th 1842, and above discussion), appellant has failed to rebut the inference.
<DD>Fourth, putting appellant's self-serving testimony aside, there
was strong circumstantial evidence that the marijuana was possessed for
sale.&nbsp; The 40 pounds of marijuana was already broken down into one pound increments, each pound individually wrapped.&nbsp; (CT 44.)&nbsp; Moreover, appellant had $2,350 in cash (CT 27, 39) in his BMW (which he claimed was a gift from his mother, RT 392).&nbsp; The retail value of the marijuana, depending on the quality, was worth $360,000 to $3.6 million dollars.&nbsp; (CT 43.)&nbsp; These factors led Sheriff's Investigator Joel Ontiveros to testify that in his expert opinion the 40 pounds of marijuana appellant was transporting was possessed for purposes of sale.&nbsp; (CT 41-42.)<SMALL><SUP><U><A HREF="peck-rb4.html#5">5</A></U>/</SUP></SMALL>
<DD>All of these reasons demonstrate there was substantial evidence to support appellant's conviction on count two, possession for sale of marijuana.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>THE TRIAL COURT PROPERLY RULED APPELLANT'S ACT OF TRANSPORTING MARIJUANA ACROSS STATE LINES, SOME OF WHICH WOULD GO TO INDIVIDUALS NOT CONNECTED WITH HIS CHURCH, CONSTITUTED A COMMERCIAL ACTIVITY</B>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<DD>It is not disputed that by finding appellant had engaged in <U>commercial activity</U> the lower court side-stepped the constitutional issue of whether the Health and Safety Code prohibitions against possession for sale and transporting of marijuana violated appellant's First Amendment right to freely practice his religion.&nbsp; Appellant attacks his conviction on both counts arguing the lower court erred by virtue of failing to reach the constitutional issue.&nbsp; (AOB 8.)&nbsp; Appellant is wrong.&nbsp; The caselaw is clear that constitutional questions are to be avoided when a case may be decided on other grounds.&nbsp; Moreover, there is substantial evidence to support the court's conclusion that appellant's transporting
of 40 pounds of marijuana was commercial activity.
<DD>Immediately prior to finding appellant guilty, the lower court made the following pertinent findings:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<DD>"[THE COURT]:&nbsp; Because <U>this case deals with marijuana commerce, which is incidental to rather than an inteitral part of the practice of the defendant's religious beliefs</U>, the Court feels it is not necessary for this Court to determine whether the State of California has adopted the lease [sic, "least"] restrictive means in order to further these valid governmental interests that relate to commercing in marijuana."&nbsp; (RT 519; emphasis added.)
<DD>"[THE COURT:]&nbsp; It's important to note that the Court is not confronted in this particular case with an individual who possessed a small unable quantity of marijuana in the privacy of his own home or house of worship or one who was cultivating a modest number of plants for personal use with the intent to utilize them as part of religious ceremonies or rights, but rather, the amount of contraband involved and the circumstances under which it was possessed clearly indicates that on the defendant's own admission that he was -- <U>he had purchased this marijuana for the purpose of transporting it interstate commerce to the state of Wisconsin</U> to the environs near his home <U>where it would be distributed to other individuals, some of whom were not involved in the practice -- practices of the Israel Zion Coptic Church.&nbsp; The defendant candidly acknowledged that he had no control over those drugs which would go to other parties</U>.&nbsp; The amounts of money involved in the purchase and the amount of the drugs themselves are clearly set forth in the record."&nbsp; (RT 519-520; emphasis added.)
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<DD>It is a well-settled rule of appellate review that constitutional questions are to be avoided when a case may be decided on other grounds.&nbsp; (<I>In re San Diego Commerce</I> (1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 1229, 1236; <I>In re Shannon B.</I> (1994) 22 Cal.App.4th 1235, 1246, fn. 7; <I>Reed v. City &amp; County of San Francisco</I> (1992) 10 Cal.App.4th 572, 575; <I>People v.Bowen</I> (1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 783, 789; <I>Palermo v. Stockton Theatres, Inc.</I> (1948) 32 Cal.2d 53, 65.)&nbsp; This is such a case.&nbsp; It is unnecessary to the disposition of this issue that the constitutionality of appellant's use of marijuana in his religion be determined.
<DD>There is substantial evidence to support the lower court's finding that appellant was engaging in marijuana commerce which was not called for by his religion, hence not covered by any assertion of First Amendment rights.&nbsp; Appellant testified he had pooled $30,000 together between himself and two other people from Iowa to purchase the 40 pounds of marijuana.&nbsp; (RT 391, 394.)&nbsp; These two people from Iowa had been members of appellant's church in Iowa, but the Iowa church had broken up.&nbsp; (RE 394-395.)&nbsp; Appellant had no way of knowing whether these friends of his from Iowa, who were going in with him on the purchase of the 40 pounds of marijuana, were going to use it as a sacrament," use it recreationally, or sell it commercially.&nbsp; (RT 412-415.)
<DD>Prior to going into this pooled transaction to purchase the 40 pounds of marijuana, appellant and his church members had been practicing their religion by purchasing small amounts of marijuana at the going Wisconsin rate of $40-$60 for quarter-ounce amounts.&nbsp; (RT 393.)&nbsp; Appellant considered this too expensive which is why he decided to buy a bulk amount in San Diego where he knew he could buy it much cheaper.&nbsp; (RT 392-394.)&nbsp; The fact that appellant had another avenue for practicing his religion with marijuana (i.e., purchasing it in smaller retail amounts in Wisconsin) which did not involve violating California's laws against trafficking in marijuana demonstrates the lower court was correct in side-stepping appellant's constitutional challenge.&nbsp; Constitutional
questions are to be avoided when a case may be decided on other grounds.&nbsp; (<I>Ibid</I>.)<SMALL><SUP><U><A HREF="peck-rb4.html#6">6</A></U>/</SUP></SMALL>
<DD>Appellant's history also suggests his interest in the commercial aspect of marijuana is a long-standing concern.&nbsp; When appellant was arrested in 1987 for growing marijuana on his farm in Wisconsin, approximately <U>1,600 marijuana plants</U> were seized.&nbsp; (<I>State v. Peck</I> (Wis.App. 1988) 422 N.W2d 160, 162.)&nbsp; Clearly, this was more marijuana than the 24 members of his congregation (RT 326-327) could reasonably use.
<DD>Recently, the Ninth Circuit analyzed a similar constitutional challenge brought by Rastafarians on religious grounds to their prosecution under federal statutes against marijuana trafficking.&nbsp; (<I>United States v. Bauer</I> (9th Cir. 1996) 75 E3d 1366.)&nbsp; Although the Ninth Circuit
ruled that under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act the district court erred in excluding evidence in support of a religious defense as to the counts of simple possession, the district court also ruled it was <U>not error to side-step the freedom of religion issue altogether with regards to the counts beyond simple possession of marijuana</U>:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<DD>"As to the counts relating to conspiracy to distribute, possession with intent to distribute, and money laundering, the religious freedom of the defendants was not invaded.&nbsp; Nothing before us suggests that Rastafarianism would require this conduct.&nbsp; These counts stand."&nbsp; (<I>United States v. Bauer</I>, <I>supra</I>, 75 F.3d at pp. 1375-1376; emphasis added.)
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<DD>Just as Rastafarianism was not a proper defense to commercial trafficking in marijuana in <I>Bauer</I>, appellant's professed religious beliefs (which are an off-shoot of Rastafarianism; RT 334-342; CT 84) was not a proper defense to appellant's commercial trafficking in marijuana in the instant case.&nbsp; The lower cottrt was correct in side-stepping the constitutional issue of whether California's statutes against possession for sale and transportation of marijuana violated appellant's First Amendment right to freely practice his religion.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>APPELLANT WAIVED ANY OBJECTIONS TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF PROBATION BY NOT OBJECTING TO THEM AT THE TIME OF SENTENCING</B>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<DD>Appellant next argues the terms of his probation which prohibit him from possessing or using any controlled substance, and also prohibit him from associating with unrelated persons who possess, use or traffic in controlled substances unconstitutionally burden his free exercise of religion and his freedom of association.&nbsp; (AOB 17.)&nbsp; Appellant waived this issue by failing to object to these terms and conditions of probation at the sentencing hearing.
<DD>In <I>People v. Welch</I> (1993) 5 Cal.4th 228, the California Supreme Court held that the failure to object to probation conditions at the time of sentencing waives the issue on appeal.&nbsp; (<I>Id</I>., at pp. 234-237; accord <I>People v. Scott</I> (1994) 9 Cal.4th 331, 356-358; see also <I>People v. Planavsky</I> (1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 1300, 1302.)
<DD>In the instant case, the probation report which was issued on June 29, 1995, recommended probation for appellant on condition appellant comply with specified terms and conditions including:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<DD>"(1)&nbsp; Violate no law or ordinance;
<DD>"...........................
<DD>"(6)&nbsp; Not associate with any unrelated person known to be a possessor, user, or trafficker of controlled substances, nor any unrelated person on probation or parole; and
<DD>"(7)&nbsp; Not possess nor use any controlled substances unless medically prescribed; any prescribed usage to be immediately reported to the Probation Officer."&nbsp; (CT 266I-266K.)
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<DD>At the sentencing hearing held July 10, 1995, defense counsel stated appellant was "willing and able to comply with the terms of probation."&nbsp; (RT 525.)&nbsp; The court specifically addressed appellant and invited him to comment on the recommendations of the probation report:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<DD>"THE COURT:&nbsp; Mr. Peck ... I've [sic] assume you've read through the probation officer's report and understand the terms and conditions of probation they are recommending.
<DD>"You have a right at this point in time, as far as I'm concerned, to address the Court as to the decisions I'm about to make ..."&nbsp; (RT 529.)
</BLOCKQUOTE>
Despite this invitation, appellant did not object personally or through counsel to the recommended terms and conditions of probation.&nbsp; Then, the court went through each individual term and condition of probation on the record with appellant (RT 535-541) after which the court again invited any comment on the terms of probation from appellant:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<DD>"[THE COURT:]&nbsp; You understand all of these terms and conditions?
<DD>"THE DEFENDANT:&nbsp; Yes, I do.
<DD>"THE COURT:&nbsp; You have any question about anything I said to you?
<DD>"THE DEFENDANT:&nbsp; No, I don't.
<DD>"THE COURT:&nbsp; Do you accept these terms and conditions?
<DD>"THE DEFENDANT:&nbsp; Yes."&nbsp; (RT 541.)
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>IT IS UNNECESSARY TO REACH THE ISSUE OF WHETHER APPELLANT'S USE OF MARIJUANA IS PROTECTED BY THE FIRST AMENDMENT'S FREE EXERCISE OF RELIGION CLAUSE; BUT IF IT IS REACHED, APPELLANT'S ARGUMENT SHOULD STILL BE REJECTED</B>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<DD>As previously stated, respondent argues it is unnecessary to reach the constitutional issue of whether appellant's use of marijuana is protected by the First Amendment because he was punished for marijuana trafficking which was incidental to, rather than an integral part of, the practice of his religion.&nbsp; (See Argument II, <I>supra</I>, incorporated here by reference.)
<DD>However, assuming arguendo this Court reaches the constitutional issue, respodent submits appellant's convictions here for transporting marijuana and possession for sale of marijuana are not protected by the First Amendment's Free exercise of religion clause for the following reasons.
<DD>Congress passed the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (hereinafter "RFRA") in 1993 (42 U.S.C. &sect; 2000bb)<SUP><SMALL><U><A HREF="peck-rb4.html#8">8</A></U>/</SMALL></SUP> in response to the United States Supreme Court opinion in <I>Employment Division, Department of Human Resources of Oregon v. Smith</I> (1990) 494 U.S. 872, 108 L.Ed.2d 876,110 S.Ct. 1595.&nbsp; (Hereinafter <I>Smith</I>.)&nbsp; While implicitly criticizing <I>Smith</I>, the statute does not present itself as an interpretation of the Constitution overruling <I>Smith</I>; rather it consists of a command that must be followed as a matter of federal law.&nbsp; (<I>United States v. Bauer</I>, <I>supra</I>, F.3d at p. 1374.)&nbsp; The statute restored and codified the "compelling interest test" as set forth in <I>Sherbert v. Verner</I> (1963) 374 U.S. 398 [10 L.Ed.2d 965, 83 S.Ct. 1790]; and <I>Wisconsin v. Yoder</I> (1972) 406 U.S. 205 [32 L.Ed.2d 15, 92 S.Ct. 1526], for purposes of analyzing whether statutes substantially burden religious exercise without compelling justification.&nbsp; (42 U.S.C. &sect; 2000bb, subds. (a) and (b); see <I>United States v. Bauer</I>, <I>supra</I>, 75 F.3d at pp. 1374-1375.)&nbsp; The compelling interest test is set forth in the statute as follows:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<DD>"Government may substantially burden a person's exercise of religion only if it demonstrates that application of the burden to the person --
<DD>"(1) is in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest; and
<DD>"(2) is the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling governmental interest."&nbsp; (42 U.S.C. &sect; 2000bb-1, subd. (b).)
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<DD>Applying this test to the instant case, the lower court correctly found that California's laws prohibiting the transportation and possession for sale of marijuana were in furtherance of compelling governmental interests.&nbsp; (RT 519.)
<DD>Moreover, respondent submits California's statutes (Health & Saf. Code, &sect;&sect; 11360 and 11359) are the least restrictive means of furthering the compelling governmental interests.<SUP><SMALL><U><A HREF="peck-rb4.html#9">9</A></U>/</SMALL></SUP>

<P>
<DD>In the instant case, the lower court held that California's laws
prohibiting the transportation and possession for sale of marijuana were
in furtherance of compelling governmental interests:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<DD>"[THE COURT:]&nbsp; From the evidence received in this trial, the Court finds that the enforcement of laws prohibiting commercial transactions in marijuana embodied in Health and Safety Code Section 11359 and 11360 are valid and compelling public health safety, societal and governmental health interest[s] on the part of the People on [sic, "of"] the state of California."&nbsp; (RT 519.)
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<DD>The lower court's ruling was correct and should be upheld by this Court.&nbsp; In examining the reasons supporting this conclusion, it should
first be noted that two other states, Wisconsin and Iowa, have come to the same conclusion with regard to religious constitutional challenges to the marijuana laws by members of the Coptic Church.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B><A NAME="IVA1">1</A>.&nbsp; Deference Should Be Given To Decisions By
Other State Courts
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which Have Ruled On This Issue</B>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<DD>In <I>State v. Peck</I>, <I>supra</I>, 422 N.W2d 160, appellant was the
defendant and he challenged Wisconsin's marijuana laws on the same grounds he is challenging California's marijuana laws in the instant case.&nbsp; The Wisconsin court stated in relevant part as follows:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<DD>"The Wisconsin legislature, in enacting ch. 161, Stats. [Wisconsin's drug laws], expressly found that the abuse of marijuana and other controlled substances 'constitutes a serious problem foe society.'&nbsp; [Citation.] ...&nbsp; In <I>Rush</I> [<I>United States v. Rush</I> (1st Cir. 1984) 738 F.2d 497], a case involving an identical 'free exercise' challenge to federal drug laws by the Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church, the court, while recognizing conflicting opinions as to whether marijuana is a health hazard and a threat to social welfare or simply a harmless recreational drug, noted that:
<DD>"<U>Every federal court that has considered the matter, so far as we are aware, has accepted the congressional determination that marijuana in fact poses a real threat to individual health and social welfare, and has upheld the criminal sanctions for possession and distribution of marijuana even where such sanctions infringe on the free exercise of religion</U>.&nbsp; <I>Id</I>. at 512.&nbsp; [Footnote omitted.]
<DD>"A majority of state courts considering the question have reached a similar result.&nbsp; [Footnote omitted.]
<DD>".....................
<DD>"<U>Preservation of the public health and safety is the obvious purpose underlying Wisconsin's drug laws, and we see a compelling state purpose in the regulation of marijuana and other controlled substances</U>.&nbsp; On this record, and in light of the nearly unanimous rulings of other state and federal courts on the issue, we conclude that the state interest is of sufficient magnitude to override Peck's first amendment interest in using the drug as a daily continual sacrament in his admittedly sincere role as a member of the Israel Zion Coptic Church.&nbsp; [Footnote omitted.]"&nbsp; (<I>State v. Peck</I>, <I>supra</I>, 422 N.W2d at pp. 163-164; emphasis added.)
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<DD>Similarly, in <I>State v. Olsen</I> (Iowa 1982) 315 N.W.2d 1, the defendant, a priest in the Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church charged with possession of marijuana with intent to deliver, challenged the trial court's refusal of his requested instructions on the religious use of marijuana as
a defense.&nbsp; The Supreme Court of Iowa concluded:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<DD>"A compelling state interest sufficient to override Olsen's free exercise clause argument is demonstrated in this case."&nbsp; (<I>Id</I>., at p. 9.)
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<DD>Appellant testified he regularly smoked marijuana and would then drive on the streets and highways of Wisconsin.&nbsp; (RT 363-367, 373-376, 423.)&nbsp; In fact, he had smoked marijuana in his hotel the morning of his arrest.&nbsp; (RT 410.)&nbsp; Had the 40 pounds of marijuana in appellant's car not been seized, they would clearly have had a deleterious effect on the
citizens of Wisconsin, and possibly Iowa.&nbsp; Appellant, with rolling papers in his pocket, was found headed north on Interstate 13, and presumably
would have exited California within a few hours and passed through several other states before arriving home in Wisconsin.&nbsp; Because the effects of appellant driving possibly under the influence of marijuana would have been felt in the states of Wisconsin and Iowa, this Court should give deference to the decisions of those states.&nbsp; <U>Comity</U> should be given to the decisions of the sister states of Wisconsin and Iowa with regard to decisions primarily affecting the health and welfare of citizens of those states.&nbsp; (See <I>People v. Pensinger</I> (1991) 32 Cal.3d 1210, 1261.)
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B><A NAME="IVA2">2</A>.&nbsp; The Evidence In This Case Demonstrated Compelling State
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interests</B>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<DD>The testimony of expert witnesses and appellant's own testimony about the casual and continuous smoking of marijuana by members of his church demonstrated why California has compelling state interests in regulating marijuana to promote public health and safety in California.
<DD>Prosecution expert Dr. Marcelline Burns testified she had "hands-on" experience in administering smoked marijuana to individuals and then observing them as they are asked to perform a variety of tasks.&nbsp; (RT 102-107, 110-129.)&nbsp; Dr. Burns described tests she conducted with regard to attention and motor skills, particularly the driving of automobiles and flying of airplanes.&nbsp; (RT 110-129, 238-239.)&nbsp; She testified individuals smoking marijuana<SUP><SMALL><U><A HREF="peck-rb4.html#10">10</A></U>/</SMALL></SUP> were unsafe to drive a car.&nbsp; (RT 126-129, 132-135, 236, 301, 305-306.)&nbsp; Dr. Burns testified such individuals displayed tracking, concentration, and reaction time problems.&nbsp; (RT 126-129, 132.)&nbsp; She testified these symptoms would persist for four to eight hours.&nbsp; (RT 134.)
<DD>Dr. Burns noted several studies indicate marijuana use may cause short-term changes in brain structure, temporarily lowered testosterone levels, and possible "a-motivational syndrome."&nbsp; (RT 243-244.)&nbsp; Based upon the effects she has observed in those who use marijuana, and the literature she has read, she had strong concerns about providing marijuana to children.&nbsp; (RT 129, 237-238.)
<DD>Defense expert Dr. John Morgan testified he too had strong concerns about providing marijuana to children.&nbsp; (RT 189, 221-222.)&nbsp; He believed marijuana use impaired driving.&nbsp; (RT 199, 202-203.)&nbsp; Because marijuana causes a quickening of the heart rate, Dr. Morgan recommended that anyone intending to smoke marijuana should first have a physical exam.&nbsp; (RT 220-221.)
<DD>The manner in which appellant and other members of his church use marijuana takes on partictilar significance when considered in light of the above expert testimony.
<DD>Appellant testified members of his church occasionally smoke marijuana all day long.&nbsp; (RT 359; see also RT 205.)&nbsp; Appellant acknowledged marijuana is provided to children; sometimes children earlier than eight years smoke marijuana.&nbsp; (RT 319-321, 382-385.)
<DD>On a typical day, appellant stated he would start the morning by sharing a joint with his wife; sometimes smoking an entire joint by himself.&nbsp; (RT 363-367.)&nbsp; He would then leave to work in his fence installing business.&nbsp; (RT 363-367.)&nbsp; He has a mechanical hold digging machine he operates.&nbsp; (RT 367.)&nbsp; In order to get to job sites, appellant
drives on the roads and highways of Wisconsin.&nbsp; (RT 363-367.)&nbsp; If time permits, appellant smokes a joint during lunch and then drives back to
work in his vehicle.&nbsp; (RT 364.)&nbsp; In the evening, appellant smokes
marijuana again, often times sharing it with his wife and at least some
of his children.&nbsp; (RT 319-321, 363-367, 382-385.)&nbsp; The older children sometimes smoked marijuana in the evening even though they would be
going to school the next day with their homework assignments.&nbsp; (RT 384-387.)&nbsp; Appellant testified that thouagh he and his wife smoked marijuana, they were typically the only persons watching their children as they played.&nbsp; (RT 390.)
<DD>Appellant's friend, Michael Matteson, who is also a member of appellant's church does things much the same as appellant expect that he is a carpenter.&nbsp; (RT 324-328, 358-361.)&nbsp; Mr. Matteson spends a lot of time in his carpentry workshop operating electric tools including a band saw.&nbsp; (RT 369-371.)&nbsp; Nevertheless, marijuana is smoked there by
Mr. Matteson and his children.&nbsp; (RT 371-373.)
<DD>Appellant makes no effort to limit his marijuana use to certain days of the week or to specific religious ceremonies (RT 360-362, 354-355), such as Native American Church members do with peyote and marijuana.&nbsp; (RT 36, 40-41, 45-46, 51-55, 67-69.)&nbsp; Rather, he provides it to his young children and he smokes marijuana frequently before getting behind the wheel to drive on public streets and before operating heavy machinery.&nbsp; Such disregard for the health and safety of himself, his family and the public at large vividly demonstrates why California has a compelling interest to intervene and regulate such conduct.&nbsp; The lower court did not abuse its discretion in so finding.

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Furthering The Compelling State Interests In Public Health And Safety</U></B>
<P>
<DD>The least restrictive means prong of the compelling state interest test is less developed than the first prong of identifying a compelling state interest.&nbsp; The reason this is so appears to be because once a court has found a compelling state interest, it is difficult for a court to dictate how this interest might be "fine-tuned" in its application.&nbsp; Administration of a law is an executive function which must take into account such problems as day-to-day administrative mechanics, distribution of limited resources, long-term effects, and other such considerations.&nbsp; As stated by the Wisconsin Court of Appeals in <I>State v. Peck</I>, <I>supra</I>, 422 N.W.2d at page 164, footnote 3:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<DD>"Peck suggests without elaboration, that the state could accomplish its goals by developing 'reasonable time, place and manner restrictions on the use of marijuana.'&nbsp; Any such action, however, would be for the legislature, not the courts, to undertake."&nbsp; (Emphasis added.)
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<DD>Nevertheless, assuming this Court has reached this stage of the constitutional analysis<SUP><SMALL><U><A HREF="peck-rb4.html#11">11</A></U>/</SMALL></SUP>, a key distinction should be kept in mind: because appellant was convicted of marijuana trafficking offenses (Health &amp; Saf. Code, &sect; 11360, subd. (a), transporting marijuana; and Health &amp; Saf. Code, &sect; 11359, possession of marijuana for sale) rather than simple possession of marijuana, the real issue presented here is  whether Health and Safety Code sections 11360, subdivision (a), and 11359 are the <U>least restrictive means with regard to controlling marijuana trafficking</U>.&nbsp; The issue is <U>not</U>, as appellant attempts to frame it, whether California's laws with regard to simple possession of an unspecified amount of marijuana for personal religious use are the least restrictive means available so as not to infringe on the First Amendment religious freedom rights of citizens.<SUP><SMALL><U><A HREF="peck-rb4.html#12">12</A></U>/</SMALL></SUP>
<DD>With this distinction in mind, let us turn to Justice O'Connor's concurring opinion in <I>Employment Division, Department of Human Resources of Oregon v. Smith</I>, <I>supra</I>, 494 U.S. 872.&nbsp; In <I>Smith</I>, Justice O'Connor concurred in the judgment of the majority but did so by
applying the <I>Sherbert</I> test, which is exactly what Congress mandated in subsequently passing the RFRA in 1993.&nbsp; (42 U.S.C. &sect; 2000bb, subd.
(b).)&nbsp; With regard to peyote use within the context of a religious ceremony of the Native American Church, she found there was a compelling state interest in the regulation of peyote by the government and it was advanced by the least restrictive means.&nbsp; She wrote, "I would conclude that uniform application of Oregon's criminal prohibition is 'essential to accomplish' [citationj its overriding interest in preventing the physical harm caused by the use of a Schedule I controlled substance."&nbsp; (Employment Division, Department of Human Resources of Oregon v. Smith, 494 U.S. at p. 905.)&nbsp; Justice O'Connor gave two reasons.&nbsp; First, "[b]ecause the health effects caused by the use of controlled substances exist regardless of the motivation of the user, the use of such substances, even for religious purposes, violates the very purpose of the laws that prohibit them.&nbsp; [Citation.]"&nbsp; (<I>Ibid</I>.)&nbsp; Second, "in view of the societal interest in preventing trafficking in controlled substances, uniform application of the criminal prohibition at issue is essential to the effectiveness of Oregon's stated interest in preventing any possession of peyote.&nbsp; [Citation.]"&nbsp; (<I>Ibid</I>.)&nbsp; Though Justice O'Connor was discussing peyote, the same rationales apply equally with regard to marijuana.&nbsp; The health effects and dangers exist both with regard to adults and children notwithstanding the religious purpose for which appellant claims it is used.&nbsp; To permit appellant to use and distribute marijuana among friends and family even for religious purposes does not resolve state health concerns.&nbsp; Likewise, with regard to preventing trafficking in marijuana -- to accept appellant's religious defense to his trafficking convictions would put an unworkable burden on law enforcement and the courts to divine who fall into the category of a religious exemption at any given moment in time.  It was also encourage completely non-religious marijuana traffickers to raise bogus religious defenses in efforts to cloak their true nefarious purposes.&nbsp; (See <I>United States v. Meyers</I> (D.Wyo. 1995) 906 F.Supp. 1494 [district court rejected claim that self-declared "Reverend" in the "Church of Marijuana" had legitimate religious beliefs protectable under RFRA].)
<DD>Similarly, this Court in <I>Music Plus Four, Inc v. Barnet</I> (1980) 114 Cal.App.3d 113, upheld a city ordinance which prohibited the display and sale of drug and marijuana paraphernalia (pipes, "alligator" clips, etc.) to minors.&nbsp; This Court found it was a compelling state interest "of the highest priority" to "protect children from exploitation by those trafficking in drugs and drug-related products."&nbsp; (<I>Id</I>., at p. 130.)&nbsp; Likewise, this Court found that the city ordinance which required minors to be accompanied by a parent or guardian before such drug and marijuana paraphernalia could be displayed or sold to them was "<U>the least restrictive means</U> to achieve that goal."&nbsp; (<I>Music Plus Four, Inc. v. Barnet</I>, <I>supra</I>, 114 Cal.App.3d at p. 130; emphasis added.)&nbsp; If it is a compelling state interest of the highest priority to protect children from exposure to marijuana-related products, certainly it is an even higher priority to protect them from the actual trafficking of marijuana.&nbsp; Likewise, Health and Safety Code sections 11360, subdivision (a), and 11359 are the least restrictive means with regard to controlling marijuana trafficking because the threat of substantial prison incarceration is necessary as a deterrent to those who would traffic marijuana to our children and citizens in general.&nbsp; The fact that these laws also provide flexibility with the possibility of probation (such as in appellant's case) for those motivated by more benign purposes also reflects how these statutes are the least restrictive means for achieving the state's compelling interests in ensuring public health and safety.
<DD>Ultimately, in this specific case, the least restrictive means prong is not of great importance.&nbsp; Even if California had in place a system by which appellant was able to lawfully obtain marijuana for religious purposes, such a system would still not address most of the state's primary concerns.&nbsp; Appellant gets into motor vehicles and drives shortly after smoking marijuana.&nbsp; It seems relatively clear appellant does not believe marijuana smoking substantially impairs a driver or heavy machine operator.&nbsp; He gives marijuana to children.&nbsp; If the state permitted appellant's use of marijuana but forbade it to his children, appellant apparently would not follow such a law as he believes it is necessary for children to smoke marijuana once they have reached the "age of reason" in order to follow his beliefs.&nbsp; (KT 382-384.)
<DD>For all these reasons, appellant's use of marijuana is not protected by the First Amendment.
