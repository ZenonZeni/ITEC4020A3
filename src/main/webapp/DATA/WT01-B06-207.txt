<BR><B>The
Browns,
the Rustbelt
and <BR>the Future of America</B>












</H1><P ALIGN=Center>











<P><B>The Cleveland Browns, not the Dallas Cowboys, are truly America's team.





















 Cleveland symbolizes the heartland of America, its industrial center.  Native





















Clevelanders, including this author, have created the Browns Diaspora, fleeing





















their home town in search of greener, and often warmer, pastures.  I have





















relocated in Maryland, but I want the Browns to stay where they belong--in





















Cleveland.</B>












<P><B>	Cleveland is home of the most loyal sports fans in the nation.  Despite
a mediocre team over the last decade the Cleveland Browns have played nearly





















every home game on the shores of bone-chilling Lake Erie before 75,000 screaming





















fans.  Art Modell's decision to move the Browns is an affront, not only to





















Cleveland, but to the United States.  He epitomizes the lack of loyalty of





















American business owners who pick up their factories and move them to





















Mexico.</B>












<P><B>	Cleveland fans, like Cleveland and other rust-belt workers, are the





















foundation on which teams and nations are built.  Professional baseball is
now learning the hard way that without fans the game is dead, and the owner's





















wallets are lighter as a result.  Similarly, if every company picks up its





















factory and moves it to a third-world country, the entire economy will fall





















apart--few will have money to buy anything.  It is not only loyalty--it makes





















common sense to cater to your home market, employ your neighbors and develop
a sense of community.  If we have no loyalty to community, loyalty to our
country will be next to disappear.  </B>












<P><B>	The process of having cities and states bid against each other to





















subsidize sports teams, or manufacturing companies, is destined for failure.





















 Someone has to pay for all of these subsidies.  And that someone is the
American taxpayer and the American worker.</B>












<P><B>	Maryland taxpayers will pay for the $200 million dollar subsidy to
the "Baltimore Browns."  What happens in ten or fifteen years when Maryland's





















stadium become obsolete and Tucson or Pensacola or London is willing to pay
a subsidy to lure the Baltimore Browns?  Baltimore suffered this fate once
before when the Colts fled in the middle of the night for the illusive glamour
of Indianapolis.  The Colts should have stayed in Baltimore and the Browns
should stay in Cleveland.</B>












<P><B>	Mercedes-Benz decided a few years ago that it could make its vehicles
more efficiently in the United States.  Dozens of states were tripping over
each other to curry favor with Mercedes.  Alabama won the bidding war, luring
the luxury German automaker with a pledge of $253 million in tax breaks and





















incentives. </B>












<P><B>	The United States would have attracted a Mercedes plant without any





















subsidy.  We must stop this counterproductive struggle pitting one community





















against another.  Congress, under its power to regulate interstate and foreign





















commerce, can stop the bidding madness for manufacturing plants.  These subsidies





















are in essence corporate welfare that harms rather than helps the national





















economy.  It is the proper role for the federal government to referee this





















wasteful competition among the various states.</B>












<P><B>	The National Football League and the City of Cleveland have the power
to stop the insanity that allows a successful sports franchise to pick up
and move.  Current NFL rules allow it to just say "No" to Art Modell.  By
doing so the football league would be acting for its own long-term preservation,





















because ultimately the fans will rebel and fail to show up for losing teams.
 The new loyalties will only go so far--so far as their newly adopted home
team is winning.  True loyalty, as Cleveland fans have demonstrated, takes





















generations to nurture.</B>












<P><B>	The City of Cleveland, under its power of eminent domain, can seize
the Browns and pay Modell fair compensation.  This is the American way. 





















America's Team deserves to stay where it was born, where it has thrived,
where it has lost and where the fans support it.  I say to Cleveland--Seize
the Day and Seize the Browns.  Do it for yourselves and do it for America
and America's real team. </B>
