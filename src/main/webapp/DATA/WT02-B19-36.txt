<P>In a press release issued on  May 29, 1996, Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI) called upon the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) for tighter regulation of the "weight-loss" industry.  CSPI in cooperation with other health organizations, and consumer advocate groups petitioned the FTC to step up its regulation of the industry.  </P>

<P>Some of the market's largest commercial weight loss programs fail to tell potential customers about the full costs of their services, and fail to provide information about how well - or poorly - they work, according to a leading non-profit health advocacy group.</P> 

<P>The Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI) examined the nation's largest weight loss programs and found some require clients to purchase excessively priced foods, others distort the cost of mandatory fees, and none routinely disclose data on how much weight their clients actually lose or keep off.</P>

<P>In 1995, 7.5 million Americans spent more than $1.78 billion at commercial weight-loss centers.</P>
