<CENTER><B>FY 1995 RESCISSIONS</B><BR>
</CENTER><BR>
     As of June 26th, a compromise on the rescission package had not yet been reached.  While Congress continues deliberations with the White House on reaching a deal in which enough FY 1995 spending will be cut to retain the votes of Republicans and not too much to draw another veto, education advocates hope no deal will be reached that will cut education programs.  CEC applauds President Clinton for his veto of the rescission package that included $4.6 million in cuts to the Javits gifted program, and continues to oppose any cuts in education programs.  <P>
As part of our advocacy efforts on behalf of the Javits gifted program, CEC joined with the National Association for Gifted Children (NAGC) in a letter to every member of Congress.  We will continue to work with NAGC and other education advocates opposing the rescissions.  Please see the attached letter (<B>Attachment 1</B>). <P>
<CENTER><B>FY 1996 FUNDING FOR PROGRAMS FOR EXCEPTIONAL CHILDREN</B><BR>
</CENTER><BR>
     On June 22, the House and Senate agreed to a compromise budget resolution.  The budget resolution sets out a seven year blueprint for the Nation's budget.   As passed, the plan calls for a total of $245 billion in tax cuts, while reducing discretionary spending by $190 billion through program terminations, consolidations, and "returning program management back to the States".   Although discretionary funding will be cut, it is unclear at this point what the final funding level will be for "Function 500", the category that includes education, training, employment and social services.  In contrast, President Clinton has introduced an alternative budget resolution that calls for a $40 billion in increased funding  in education over seven years.  Budget resolutions are passed by both houses, conferenced and the conferenced version must be passed in each house again.  The final budget resolution does not need to be signed by the President; although the 13 appropriations bills that implement the provisions in the budget resolution, do require Presidential signature.   Please see the attached letter to Congress on the FY 1996 budget resolution (<B>Attachment 2</B>). <P>
The FY 1996 appropriations bill for labor, health and human services, and education is scheduled to be marked up in subcommittee on July 10.  The full Committee on Appropriations is expected to follow with its mark up on  July 20.  Because of the overall spending cuts outlined in the budget resolution, the subcommittee is expected to cut appropriations for FY 1996 by $10-12 billion.  This means that education programs can be expected to absorb a cut in funding of at least $4 billion in the next fiscal year!  The next two weeks will be critical in persuading House legislators to retain funding in IDEA special education programs and in the Javits gifted program.  <P>

After final House action, the Senate subcommittee will begin its mark up of the FY 1996 appropriations bill for education programs.    Please see the attached CEC letter thanking President Clinton for calling for an investment in education programs (<B>Attachment 3</B>). <P>
<CENTER><B>REAUTHORIZATION OF IDEA</B><BR>
</CENTER><BR>
     On May 9th, the House and Senate held a joint hearing to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act.  The hearing was chaired by Chairman Cunningham (R-CA) and was very well attended.  Testifying were Sen. Paul Simon (D-IL) and Senator James Jeffords (R-VT) as well as advocates, lawyers and parents that were instrumental in the passage of IDEA in 1975.  Included among those testifying was Fred Weintraub, CEC Director of Publications who was head of CEC's Governmental Relations in 1975.  Fred was able to point out the uniqueness of  the individualization of education embodied in the IEP process, and IDEA's ability to get teachers and parents to work together like never before.         <P>
<B>Senate Action.  </B>The Senate Subcommittee on Disability Policy also held hearings on May 11th and 16th.  CEC was fortunate to have Matty Rodriguez-Walling and Sharon Gonder, two former Clarissa Hug Teachers of the Year, testify on May 11th.  Both brought regular education teachers with them and testified on how special education teachers can work together with regular education teachers to benefit children with disabilities.   All the teachers did a wonderful job of letting the Senators know what is actually happening in classrooms across the country.   Their realism will no doubt assist the Senators in making positive decisions during the reauthorization of IDEA.  Please contact the CEC Department of Public Policy for a copy of their testimony.<P>
Chairman Frist has introduced a bill to extend the authorization of the discretionary programs under IDEA.  The one year extension will allow for these programs to continue to operate if the reauthorization of IDEA is not passed by October 1.   In future action, the Senate Subcommittee on Disability Policy is scheduled to hold a hearing on discipline and children with disabilities on July 11.  It is expected the Senate will have a bill to reauthorize IDEA sometime in July.  <P>
<B>House Action</B>.  On June 20, the House held its first hearing on IDEA (during this Congress).  Those testifying included U.S. Secretary of Education Richard Riley on the first panel and parents of children with disabilities on the second panel.  Secretary Riley spoke of two goals the administration has during the reauthorization of IDEA: focusing on what actually happens in the classroom rather than on the process itself, and allowing for more flexibility to parents and schools.  Within that framework he outlined six principles:  improving teaching and learning, including cutting down on paperwork and having an effective balance on safety and discipline; aligning the IDEA with state and local education improvement efforts; addressing individual needs in the LRE for the student; providing families and teachers with the knowledge and training to support students' learning, including using mediation; having high 
expectations for children with disabilities and access to regular education; and emphasizing early intervention.<P>
During his testimony, Riley stated the Department is looking to expand the so-called Jeffords amendment that amends the stay put provision in IDEA to allow for a 45 day alternative education setting for a child with a disability who brings a gun to school.  According to Riley, the Department will be recommending extending the definition of weapon to include other weapons such as knives.  Please see attached copy of Secretary Riley's testimony (<B>Attachment 4</B>). <P>
In future action, the House has scheduled an IDEA hearing for July 27.  Among those testifying will be CECer Marlise Stieglitz, a special education teacher from Spencerville, Indiana.  The House is expected to introduce a reauthorization bill sometime this summer.  <P>

<CENTER><B>REAUTHORIZATION OF VOCATIONAL EDUCATION</B><BR>
</CENTER><BR>
     On June 21, the Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources passed S. 143 which would consolidate 91 education and training programs into 1 block grant.  The committee passed the legislation by a 10-6 vote, with Senator Pell (D-RI) the only Democrat voting for the bill.  The bill would authorize $9.1 billion in FY 1996, a decrease in the overall current funding of existing programs.  Of the funds available, 93 percent would be allocated to States in block grants to Governors.  The block grant must designate a minimum of 25 percent to fund workforce employment activities and at least  25 percent for workforce education, including activities currently authorized under the School-to-Work Opportunities Act and the Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Applied Technology Education Act.  The remaining funds, 50 percent, are to be in a "flex fund" that States could decide to spend in either category.  While coordinating vocational rehabilitation with other provisions in the Act, the bill would keep the funding for vocational rehabilitation separate. <P>
The House Committee on Economic and Educational Opportunities marked up its version of job training consolidation on May 24.  The Consolidated and Reformed Education, Employment and Rehabilitation (CAREERS) Act, H.R. 1617, would consolidate over 100 federal education and training programs into 4 block grants:  a Youth Workforce Preparation Consolidation Grant, a Vocational Rehabilitation Consolidation Grant, an Adult Training Consolidation Grant, and an Adult Education and Literacy Consolidation Grant.  The bill authorizes $2.3 billion for the Youth Workforce Preparation Consolidation Grant which includes School-to-Work and the Perkins Vocational Education activities.  Of that amount, Governors must allocate 40 percent for serving in-school youth, 40 percent would be allocated for activities for at-risk youth, 10 percent for incentive grants to be used for either category and the remaining 10 percent  to be used for either purpose.<P>
CEC is concerned that any vocational education legislation require access for students with disabilities in all school-based vocational education programs.  Legislation must also include language in the Carl D. Perkins Vocational Education and Applied Technology Act that requires recipients of funds to provide the supplementary services needed to students with disabilities to make it possible for them to fully participate in programs.  We will be working with both the House and the Senate to ensure provisions are included in the final legislation that will address these concerns. <P>
