  SUMMARY :
</H3>
<P ALIGN=Left>
The company and the Canadian Inventor has achieved both a marketing and technical
breakthrough which will initiate and extend the use of Negative Ionization
Systems to clean and freshen the air in plant and office buildings.
<P ALIGN=Left>
The installations are in full compliance with all CSA and Canadian Electrical
Building codes ( Rev. 1991 ) regulatory requirements permitting the use of
the system in areas where flash off vapour or potentially explosive dust
concentrations may be present.
<P ALIGN=Left>
The "Ion Wash" system designed specifically for the paint and coating facilities
of U.S. Automotive manufacturers has overcome a long standing problem with
fine dust and dirt where a short in-line ionized section replaces plastic
screens running almost the full length of the facility.
<P ALIGN=Left>
The FORD Automotive Company obtained a significant reduction in the inclusions
experienced during the finishing of car bodies and has fully endorsed the
installations for international use.
<P ALIGN=Left>
The flexible and highly adaptable nature of the system can be applied in
all situations where fine dust and dirt is a problem during manufacture,
which according to the company' survey is not confined only to paint and
coating processing.
<P ALIGN=Left>
The Canadian Inventor ( Robertson ) has achieved a technical breakthrough
with a new layered process that is put down like a chip process hence it
is termed the "ION CHIP" invention which in conjunction with some innovations
to generate and introduce Negative Ions to increase the beneficial or remedial
effect, ensures that systems to control and inhibit bacteria can be designed
and marketed.
<P ALIGN=Left>
The advances in technology which are considered to be patentable will be
employed to provide a coordinated solution to the "Sick Building syndrome"
which is the goal of the company.
<P ALIGN=Left>
The equipment required remains simple using standard material so that highly
acceptable profit margins with increased market penetration will be realized.
<P>
  <HR>
<H3>
  1. A Technology for our Times
</H3>
<P>
The inherent capabilities of negative ionization to clean and freshen the
air is a well documented, natural phenomena. To take advantage of it in our
modern age to overcome problems we have created for ourselves with contaminated
and poor indoor air quality becomes a matter of replicating this natural
outdoor phenomena within our enclosed environments.
<P>
While this has been done by many others quite successfully on a small scale,
it is the view and contention of the Company that with the prevalence and
multiplicity of problems caused by airborne dust and biological contamination
in our buildings large scale systems should be developed utilizing all the
remedial characteristics and capabilities of negative air ionization if solutions
to such problems are to be realized.
<P>
This conclusion was reached after exhaustive feasibility studies and an
evaluation of field trials carried out both in the United Kingdom and elsewhere
over an eight year period. During this time the widespread and diverse nature
of the problems were identified and the prospects for their solutions assessed.
The Company has formulated a unique and innovative approach to apply the
technology, with a breakthrough invention about to be fully protected by
patent which will allow the implementation of a strategic core business plan
(the ion chip).
<P>
The plan coordinates a program of scientific research and experimental product
development with a marketing strategy to commercialize the technology in
stages, starting with applications in manufacturing and commercial applications
where the results will be immediately beneficial to customers and the Company.
<P>
Always moving towards the goal of providing a solution to the now universally
recognized "Sick Building Syndrome".
<P>
  <HR>
<H3>
  2. The Sick Building Syndrome
</H3>
<P>
Government agencies in both Canada and the USA rate the quality of indoor
air so bad that they consider indoor air as their Nations' largest pollution
problem and estimate between 50% to 70% of all buildings in North America
to have Sick Building Syndrome to one degree or another.
<P>
Further research indicated that people spend almost 90% of their time indoors;
either at work or in the home.
<P>
It is now generally accepted that the cause of the problem, while multi-faceted,
has its roots in the oil crisis with the sealing of buildings for energy
conservation and reducing the costs on a year round basis for heating and
air-conditioning.
<P>
The remedial action of negative ionization demonstrably can control the
circulation and re-circulation of building pollutants at the same time a
natural balance between the beneficial negative ions and the sometimes harmful
positive ions can be achieved.
<P>
Apart from the obvious benefit of clean fresh air to the building occupants
there is considerable evidence that the benefits of negative ionization extends
to decreasing fatigue, increasing alertness and relieving stress with individuals
performing complicated repetitive tasks such as computer rooms, supervisory
control rooms and air traffic control centres.
<P>
  <HR>
<H3>
  3. Scope of Indoor Pollution and Field Trials
</H3>
<P>
The problems with airborne contamination and poor indoor air quality are
a by product of our industrialized society where the demand is for increased
product quality and productivity.
<P>
The industries identified as having problems with indoor air pollution and
where field trials have proven effective with customer verification of increased
productivity and improved product quality or improved health and safety include;
<UL>
  <LI>
    &#183; Paint and Coating Facilities
  <LI>
    &#183; Plastic Industry
  <LI>
    &#183; Glass Industry
  <LI>
    &#183; Textile Industry
  <LI>
    &#183; Hog Barns/Horse Stables/Poultry Barns
  <LI>
    &#183; Food Production
  <LI>
    &#183; Printing and Silk Screening
  <LI>
    &#183; Paper Industry
  <LI>
    &#183; Additions to Clean Rooms
  <LI>
    &#183; Offices
</UL>
<P>
<P>
In most instances, the problems were so acute that the customer was quite
prepared to overlook the crude nature of the installations and any deficiencies
of an engineering or safety nature and in particular the susceptibility of
the emitter to damage during cleaning and maintenance procedures.
<P>
The adherence to some degree of clean room protocol to ensure long term results
was often suspect in a number of the trials.
<P>
  <HR>
<H3>
  4. PROFITABILITY AND GROWTH
</H3>
<P>
a) The manufacturing and installation of negative ionization systems is extremely
simple requiring only standard components and materials which are readily
available so that the company can realize very attractive profit margins.
<P>
b) Increasing the attractiveness of further investment in scientific Research
and Product Development are the innovations and adaptability made possible
by the latest "ION CHIP" invention.
<P>
c) Based on preliminary searches it is anticipated that a patent application
for the Ion Chip invention will be obtained in both Canada and the USA This
should ensure that the company retains its front edge in the embryonic technology
for many years providing a secure base for expansion.
<P>
d) The combination of the ION CHIP with the modes of operation devised to
deploy, distribute, and augment, the generation of Negative Ions will be
the major opportunities gained to commercialize the technology.
<P>
  <HR>
<H3>

</UL>
<P>
  <HR>
<H3>
  5.2 Marketing Strategy
</H3>
<P>
<B>Sales Policy</B>
<P>
Negative ionization systems must not be considered as being a substitute
or a competitor to a properly designed air handling and treatment facility
nor as having the capability to compensate for basic faulty designs in
ventilation.
<P>
Rather, the Company systems add a new dimension to conventional air treatment
to ensure that activities can proceed in any enclosed environment with assurance
that airborne contamination will be minimal and air quality otherwise improved.
<P>
Also an acceptance of clean room protocol by the customers, employees, is
mandatory.
<P>
<P>
<B>Incremental Marketing</B>
<P>
The systems will be developed and marketed on an incremental basis triggered
by the completion and success of each phase of the SR and EP development
program.
<P>
In turn, the SR and EP program will be prioritized on the basis of the simpler
requirements of the system most readily assessed results and where the customers
ROI can be most attractive. This would suggest:
<P>
Control of Dust and Static ( Dirt )
<P>
&#183; Paint and Coating Operations
<P>
&#183; General Manufacturing
<P>
&#183; Clean Room Additions
<P>
Control of Biological Contamination ( Hygiene )
<P>
&#183; Rearing of Livestock
<P>
&#183; Food Production
<P>
&#183; Medical Establishments
<P>
Control of Ion Concentration
<P>
&#183; Sick Buildings
<P>
&#183; Control Rooms
<P>
&#183; Aircraft/Buses
<P>
  <HR>
<H3>
  6. Progress To Date
</H3>
<P>
<B>Patents</B>
<P>
The ion chip device patent application, which supersedes previous designs,
has been drafted and will now be put in the hands of a patent agent.
<P>
<B>Regulatory Approval</B>
<P>
With the equipment CSA approved and installations in compliance with the
1991 revision of the Canadian Electrical Building Code for HV/extra low powered
electronically sourced, the major hurdle to marketing the systems for virtually
all applications has been overcome.
<P>
<B>Performance of Systems</B>
<P>
Control of static and dust particulate migration demonstrated by the
installations sold to the major U.S. automotive manufacturers.
<P>
<B>Control of airborne biological contamination verified by the results of
the dental surgery project.</B>
<P>
Control of air ion density for all applications can be done with the ion
chip design concept and use of the three modes: Passive; Modulation; and
Interaction to introduce and distribute the requisite volume of negative
ions to maximize the remedial ion effect in any particular situation.
<P>
  <HR>
<H3>

<P>
  <HR>
<H3>
  8. The ION CHIP Invention
</H3>
<P>
While some experience and know how is required with the understanding of
the High Voltage / Extremely Low power supplies, choice of polarity, HV threshold
levels, cold sparking, minimum ignition energy; ozone restrictions; mostly
factors concerning the safety and replicating of the outdoor "Ion Effect"
phenomenon within enclosed environments. The key to on going successful
commercialization of the technology is the design and construction of the
emission devices.
<P>
The Ion Chip invention provides this key, allowing company designers of the
future systems the opportunity to maximize all the beneficial and remedial
characteristics which result from the proper introduction of negative ionization
by one or other of three basic modes, passive, modulation and interactive
providing -
<P>
control of air borne particles
<P>
control of electro-static conditions
<P>
control of bacterial / viral growth
<P>
control of air ion mix and density
<P>
Thereby, adding a "new dimension" for consideration to upgrade the performance
of conventional air handling and treatment systems with a decided cost advantage
over alternative methodologies; with minimum energy consumption , maintenance
and capital expenditure.
<P>
<P>
In summary, the advantages of the Ion Chip device include;
<UL>
  <LI>
    simplicity with operational safety
  <LI>
    stable predictable ion output
  <LI>
    mechanical strength
  <LI>
    easily cleaned with the minimum maintenance
  <LI>
    self contained removable units
  <LI>
    accommodates all modes of operation
  <LI>
    allows emitters of almost any size and configuration
  <LI>
    provides for the development of new materials
</UL>
<P>
Based on some earlier searches, it is anticipated that the "Ion Chip"device
can be protected by patents including the products and systems which can
now be developed and commercialized by the company.
<P>
  <HR>
<H3>
  8.2 MODES OF OPERATION :
</H3>
<P>
There are Three basic methods to introduce Negative Air Ions into an air
space:
<P>
<B>Passive or Natural Mode</B>
<P>
The passive mode is where a series of strategically placed emitters mounted
at a height of 8 to 10 Ft; kept constantly energized from a High Voltage
/ Extremely Low Power source will provide a distribution or " SHOWER of Negative
Ions to cause a natural precipitation of any accumulation of air borne particles
in the air space.
<P>
Depending upon the volume of the particles already in the suspension there
will be a purge period usually between 24 to 48 hours to allow the ions to
progressively disperse this accumulation.
<P>
Subsequently a constant level of negative ions will then be available to
immediately precipitate any new particles being generated by activities taking
place below the emitters.
<P>
In situations where air borne particles must be contained in a work area,
a series of closely spaced emitters can form an "Ion Barrier" to prevent
migration to other areas.
<P>
It may be noted that particles precipitated by this passive action will be
prevented from becoming air borne again as long as the emitters remain energized
and violent air disturbances are avoided.
<P>
For industrial use, longitudinal style emitters appear to provide the most
effective distribution and concentration of ions.
<P>
With office applications the emitters could take the form of ceiling tiles
primarily for aesthetic reasons.
<P>
  <HR>
<H3>
  MODULATION:
</H3>
<P>
Modulation air passed through the body of the emitter acts upon the corona
forming element and increases the ion output proportional to the air flow.
This air also serves to clean the device and exposes additional points for
corona. Modulation can be employed in applications where it is desired to
counteract periodic dust or contamination generating activities.
<P>
Medical applications requiring relatively high ion concentration and possibly
aerosol enrichment to maximize the inhibition of bacteria and viruses.
<P>
With confinement reading of animals during feeding times
<P>
High activity manufacturing areas.<BR>
  <HR>
<H3>
  INTERACTIVE:
</H3>
<P>
The "Interactive mode" is to incorporate the emitters with conventional air
diffusers and distribution arrangements.
<P>
Part of the emitters positioned in the ventilation air stream will increase
the ions discharged as a function of the air velocity and be ideally distributed.
<P>
The lower part of the arrangement parallel to the floor will act in the passive
mode at all times independent of the ventilating air.
