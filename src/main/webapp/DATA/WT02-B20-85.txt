  What is epilepsy?<BR>
 Epilepsy is a neurological condition that from time to time produces brief disturbances in the normal electrical function of the brain. Normal brain function is made possible by millions of tiny electrical charges passing between nerve cells in the brain and to all parts of the body. When someone has epilepsy, this normal pattern may be interrupted by intermittent bursts of electrical energy that are much more intense than usual. They may affect a person's consciousness, bodily movements or sensations for a short time. These physical changes are called epileptic seizures. That is why epilepsy is sometimes called a seizure disorder. The unusual bursts of energy may occur in just one area of the brain (partial seizures) , or may affect nerve cells throughout the brain (generalized seizures). Normal brain function cannot return until the electrical bursts subside. Conditions in the brain that produce these episodes may have been present since birth, or they may develop later in life due to injury, infections, structural abnormalities in the brain, exposure to toxic agents, or for reasons that are still not well understood. Many illnesses or severe injuries can affect the brain enough to produce a single seizure. When seizures continue to occur for unknown reasons or because of an underlying problem that cannot be corrected, the condition is known as epilepsy. Epilepsy affects people of all ages, all nations, and all races. Epilepsy can also occur in animals, including dogs, cats, rabbits, and mice.<P>

  Basic information about epilepsy is provided for special education teachers.  
Epilepsy is seen as primarily a symptom and is not, by itself, a reason for 
special education placement.  Epilepsy may, however, also occur in cases where 
learning difficulties are the sequelae of generalized brain damage.  (DB)<BR>

  Epilepsy affects approximately one percent of the population, with most cases 
having onset during childhood.  School personnel can best incorporate the child 
with epilepsy into the classroom and provide support for families by becoming 
familiar with the types of seizure disorders, the issues that epilepsy presents 
for children and families, and the supports that children and families need.  
This paper provides information on: (1) seizure types, what they look like, 
first aid, and what not to do; (2) common misconceptions and negative attitudes 
regarding epilepsy that can compromise a child's ability to participate 
actively in social and school activities; (3) difficulties in diagnosis and 
medication and resulting family stress; (4) possible scholastic difficulties; 
and (5) the benefits and drawbacks of rural living and rural schools for 
children with epilepsy and their families.  Two brief case studies illustrate 
the social, emotional, and academic effects that epilepsy can have on children. 
Ways in which the school can alleviate some of the problems of students with 
epilepsy and their families are suggested, including an information seminar for 
the entire school about epilepsy and associated problems, designating one staff 
member to be a support person for the student, and maintaining frequent family 
contacts.  Information sources on epilepsy for teachers and family are noted.

  Studied relationships of age at onset, seizure syndrome, seizure type, and 
seizure frequency to classroom performance and adaptive skills of 131 children 
with epilepsy.  Epilepsy syndrome and frequency of seizures significantly 
related to some analyses.  Results suggest that seizure disorder associated 
with diffuse or multifocal brain insult can produce problems in achievement and 
school adaptation.  (Author/NB)<BR>

  The brief guide offers information on epilepsy to teachers and other school 
personnel.  Types of seizures are defined (e.g., simple and complex partial 
seizures, generalized tonic clonic seizures), and management practices in the 
classroom setting for each type of seizure are described.  Signs indicating 
that a seizure requires immediate medical attention are listed.  Specific 
suggestions for helping other children in the class understand what seizures 
are and deal with the experience of witnessing a seizure are offered.  Other 
topics addressed in the pamphlet include medication for seizure prevention and 
the school's involvement in this responsibility, symptoms a teacher might note 
in a child as yet undiagnosed with epilepsy, academic and behavioral 
expectations for the epileptic child, avoiding overprotection, and 
communicating with parents.  A list of suggested readings is included.  (JW)<BR>

and the extent to which they were exposed to uncontrollable seizures.  Results 
showed that high-resourceful epileptics exposed to lower frequencies of 
seizures coped better with their disability.  (LLL)<BR>
