End of the line for pipeline deal


Hours after the FTC entered federal court to block Questar Corporation from
acquiring a 50 percent interest in Kern River Gas Transmission Company from
Tenneco, Inc., the parties called off the deal.  In the past, the parties
would nevertheless be facing a lengthy administrative trial, the price for
having forced the FTC's hand.  But under the Commission's new enforcement
policy, the matter is now moot.

The $226 million transaction would have given Questar a monopoly over natural
gas transmission services in the Salt Lake City area, the FTC charged in its
short-lived suit.

Questar had a monopoly until 1992, the FTC said, when the Kern River pipeline
opened to provide competition in the area.  Kern River is jointly and
equally-owned by Tenneco and Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company.  Allowing Questar
to gain half ownership in Kern River would halt newly emerged competition in
the area, according to the agency.

A senior FTC official said the agency is paying "special attention" to
acquisitions in this newly deregulated industry and assigned at least 10
Competition Bureau attorneys to this investigation.  In this instance, the
official said, the staff identified an unusually strong "potential
competition" case:  although the acquired company hadn't made a single sale in
the market in which the acquiring company was selling, it had been making
offers and Questar allegedly always lowered its price and won the business.

The case, filed in federal district court in Utah, bears a striking
resemblance to the Justice Department's successful attempt to halt the
acquisition of one California natural gas company by another area company in
the 1960s.  The district court allowed that transaction to proceed.  But the
Supreme Court, in U.S.  v.  El Paso Natural Gas Co., et.  al.  (376 U.S.  651)
reversed the district court, ruling that mere attempts by the acquired company
to enter the market -- though unsuccessful -- had a "powerful influence" on
the market.

Questar's decision to abandon the transaction effectively ended the
Commission's enforcement activities in this case.  In the past, Questar could
have been facing administrative litigation.  FTC decisions on whether to
proceed with administrative litigation have been made on a case-by-case basis,
but respondents rarely escaped.

For instance, in 1991, the Commission chose not to proceed to administrative
litigation after going into court to enjoin Wiggins Teape Appleton plc from
acquiring a Vancouver, Washington paper mill owned by Boise Cascade
Corporation.  Wiggins did not abandon that transaction until 20 days after the
FTC asked a federal court for a preliminary injunction.

Under the Commission's new policy it is standard for the agency to close cases
once the acquisition in question is abandoned.  The FTC previously pursued
most cases administratively when the parties pushed the matter into court,
even if only to get an order requiring prior approval of future transactions.
Prior approval provisions in orders are now the exception, not the rule, under
the Commission's new policy.

Atmospheric gas merger challenged
Three little gases; no little substitutes


The $2 billion pairing of Praxair, Inc., America's largest industrial gas
supplier, and CBI Industries, Inc.  would likely harm competition for
atmospheric gases in several parts of the country, the FTC charged last week.
The U.S.  market as a whole would not suffer, but parts of California, the
midwest and the northeast could be hard hit in markets for nitrogen, oxygen
and argon, according to the FTC.  Praxair has agreed to divest four merchant
atmospheric gas production plants to settle those charges.

Those who stayed awake through science class know that nitrogen, oxygen and
argon are the three "atmospheric gases."  They are also very popular
commercial, or "merchant," gases and are shipped to customers either as a
liquid, by tanker truck, or in cylinders.

Nitrogen is used to create inert environments for heat treating and chemical
blanketing.  Food industries and others also use nitrogen for freezing
products.  Oxygen is used for combustion and oxidation in foundries, steel and
glass plants and for medical purposes.  Argon is used primarily for welding.
The common trait of all three gases is that they have no common traits with
other gases; there are no suitable substitutes for any of the three.

But the gases also have their differences, and the FTC's case against Praxair
carefully balances those differences.  Nitrogen and oxygen can be economically
shipped only 150 to 300 miles, for instance, while argon -- a more expensive
gas -- can be economically shipped much longer distances, up to about 1,000
miles, according to the FTC.

If Praxair were to acquire CBI, unfettered by divestiture, the Northern and
Southern California markets for nitrogen and oxygen could be hard hit, the
agency charged.  In both areas, five competitors would become four.  In
Northern California the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) would jump 431 points
to 3366, and Praxair would control 32 percent of the market, the FTC said.  In
Southern California, the HHI would take a similar jump, 440 points, landing at
2727 in a market where Praxair would dominate with a 34.8 percent share.

Nitrogen and oxygen markets in the Northern Midwest and Northeastern U.S.  --
and narrower markets therein, such as the Western Wisconsin/Southeastern
Minnesota area and Eastern Connecticut -- could also be harmed, according to
the FTC.

The same goes for the merchant argon markets in Eastern Connecticut and the
Western Wisconsin/Southeastern Minnesota area, where Praxair and CBI are "each
other's closest geographic competitor."  CBI's share of the argon market is
small, the FTC said.  But because its plant is so close to Praxair's in those
two areas, "localized unilateral anticompetitive effects are likely."

Praxair has agreed to divest four of CBI's atmospheric gas production
facilities.  Plants will be divested in Vacaville, California; Irwindale,
California; Bozrah, Connecticut; and Madison, Wisconsin.

Cranial shunt divestiture ordered
in Johnson & Johnson merger


Johnson & Johnson's $1.8 billion merger with Cordis Corporation snagged in the
market for cranial shunts last month.  Johnson & Johnson has agreed to divest
the Cordis's neuroscience business to a Commission-approved buyer within one
year to settle charges that the acquisition would place 85% of the U.S.
neurological shunt market into the hands of only two firms.

Neurological shunts are used to treat patients -- primarily children --
suffering from the potentially fatal brain disorder hydrocephalus, which
involves excessive pressure on the brain from an increase of fluid in the
skull.  The shunts, once installed, divert cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) into the
bloodstream of patients suffering from hydrocephalus.

Combining the shunt businesses of Johnson & Johnson and Cordis would raise the
Herfindahl-Hirschman Index to 4059 for the market, the FTC charged.  The
merger would likely lead to higher prices and reduced innovation in the
market, according to the agency.

Johnson & Johnson has agreed to divest the Cordis neuroscience business, which
includes shunts, intracranial pressure drainage systems and neuroendoscopy
products, tools used to install shunts.  The FTC alleged competitive problems
only in the market for shunts.  But "[significant synergies between the
products manufactured and sold by the [Cordis neuroscience business] exist,
and Cordis's shunts are sold as part of a broader product line," the FTC staff
said in its analysis.  "Therefore, a divestiture of the whole business is
necessary to maintain competition in the shunt market."

There is one potential snag to the divestiture:  a joint venture between
Cordis and Nobles-Lai Engineering, Inc.  to research, develop and manufacture
neuroendoscopy products.  If Nobles-Lai asserts contractual rights, the
divestiture could be held up, allowing Nobles-Lai to benefit from Johnson &
Johnson's marketing outlet and possibly giving Johnson & Johnson control over
Cordis, a situation the proposed order was meant to prevent.

To prevent that from occurring the proposed order includes an insurance
policy.  If Nobles-Lai asserts contractual rights, Johnson & Johnson has
agreed not to contract with Nobles-Lai to research, develop or market any
neuroendoscopy products.  Johnson & Johnson further agreed not to purchase
from or distribute for Nobles-Lai any such products.

Going public - A different divestiture


Oerlikon-Buhrle Holding AG has proposed using Wall Street to divest one of its
subsidiaries in the first divestiture by initial public offering (IPO) of
stock overseen by the FTC.  As envisioned, the company would not directly
divest to another company its turbomolecular pump subsidiary, Balzers-Pfeiffer
GmbH, but would instead offer the shares in Balzers-Pfeiffer.  After that, the
pump unit would operate as a stand-alone business.

Divestiture of Balzers-Pfeiffer is required under a 1995 order settling
charges that Switzerland-based Oerlikon-Buhrle's acquisition of Leybold AG, a
German corporation, would harm competition in the U.S.  turbomolecular pump
market.  Turbomolecular pumps are small "jet engine-like devices" which
produce high vacuum atmospheres used in the production of semiconductors.
[FTC:WATCH No.  422, November 7, 1994]

The FTC has requested public comment until February 1 on the proposed IPO,
though no details of the plan are currently available.  Oerlikon-Buhrle must
first jump through Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) hoops before
Balzers-Pfeiffer can go public, and securities law prohibits disclosure of all
but the most basic data about an IPO until a registration statement has been
filed with the SEC.  Once that statement has been filed, the Commission plans
to offer the public an additional opportunity to comment, though not
necessarily an additional 30 days.

The FTC has approved novel forms of divestiture in the past.  In March, 1994
it approved Valspar Corporation's plan to combine four of its own plants and
five plants from a company it acquired into a new company, which was then spun
off to shareholders.  That divestiture settled concerns raised when Valspar
acquired the Resin Products Division of Cargill, Inc.  [FTC:WATCH No.  408,

Merger briefs


Antitrust issues in the Time Warner - Turner Broadcasting proposed merger
remain far from resolved as the parties have yet to comply with an FTC request
for additional information.

The L'Oreal S.A.  and Maybelline, Inc.  deal is in for a tough time at the
Antitrust Division says a source familiar with the Division's investigation,
which is being "pursued vigorously."  The parties announced December 26 that
they had received a request for additional information and said they "hope to
furnish the requested information as promptly as practical."

Illinois Tool Works Inc.'s acquisition of Hobart Brothers Co.  remains stalled
as ITW searches for a buyer for assets it will have to dispose of to make the
FTC go away.

Thermo Instrument Systems is still searching for a solution to antitrust
problems the FTC raised in connection with Thermo's pending acquisition of
Fisons plc's Scientific Instruments Division.

For the next five years --
Buy your toys in Pennsylvania


Pennsylvania's attorney general has persuaded Playmobil USA, Inc.  to donate
$201,000 to 12 charities and another $50,000 to the state's litigation fund to
settle allegations that the firm and its German parent, geobra Brandstaetter
GmbH & Co.  KG have been keeping the prices of "toy figures, playsets and
accessories" artificially high through a resale price maintenance program.

The agreement, filed in U.S.  District Court for the Middle District of
Pennsylvania, also enjoins Playmobil from "entering into any contract,
combination, conspiracy, agreement or arrangement with any Pennsylvania dealer
to fix, raise, maintain or stabilize the retail prices at which Playmobil
products are sold to the public, or at which Pennsylvania dealers may
advertise Playmobil products."  [emphasis added]

Playmobil is also enjoined "from adopting or establishing any cooperative
advertising policy that denies or reduces advertising rebates or allowances to
a Pennsylvania dealer for any reason related to that dealer's advertised
prices."  [emphasis added]

The consent decree also bars Playmobil from cutting off dealers or
discriminating against them with regard to supply or credit terms "for failing
to adhere to any of Playmobil USA's suggested retail price for those
products."

On the other hand, Playmobil may continue to suggest prices.

The order terminates in five years.

Cigarettes under siege:
The tobacco industry's
two-front federal battle


While the tobacco industry dug in to fight against tobacco advertising
regulations proposed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the FTC poised
itself to attack from the rear last month.  The agency staff, responding to
suggestions from the National Cancer Institute (NCI), is busy readying a
proposal for the FTC that could change the way cigarette tar, nicotine and
carbon monoxide values are determined and how they are advertised.

An NCI panel announced it would suggest changes a year ago after concluding
the FTC testing procedures yield tar, nicotine and carbon monoxide figures
that do not accurately reflect the amount of those substances consumers
actually get from smoking.  The tobacco industry may agree with that
conclusion, according to a December 28 Wall Street Journal report.  The report
quotes an internal Philip Morris document that said the FTC testing method
"should be retained:  It gives low ratings."

Consumer Protection Bureau Chief Jodie Bernstein acknowledged that her staff
is working on a proposal based on the NCI panel's suggestions.  The NCI has
not yet released an official report of the two-day conference conducted by its
panel in December 1994 but the report is expected within the month.  The panel
itself released its findings at the conclusion of the conference.  [FTC:WATCH
No.  425, December 19, 1994]

The NCI panel recommended modifications to the FTC's testing methodology to
test the "ranges" of tar, nicotine and carbon monoxide levels in cigarettes.
Those ranges should be graphically depicted on each pack of cigarettes sold,
according to NCI, which further suggested use of "appropriate" disclaimers on
packages and in ads for cigarettes classified as either "light" or "ultra
light."  The disclaimers would inform consumers that, at best, evidence
suggests minimal health benefits from smoking lower tar cigarettes.

The FTC staff is exploring ways to change the machine testing protocols to
more accurately reflect the way smokers actually smoke, according to
Bernstein.  The staff proposal will also focus on changes in advertising that
would more accurately reflect the levels of tar, nicotine and carbon monoxide
smokers actually get from smoking.  A graphic depiction of the ranges is among
the proposals under consideration at the FTC.

The NCI panel's suggestion of a graphic depiction of the ranges on every pack
is a recommendation that could run up against the Cigarette Labeling and
Advertising Act.  That law mandates rotating health warnings on cigarette
packages and bars the FTC from requiring any alternative warning.  But the Act
does not restrict the FTC from requiring alternative health warnings in
advertising.  It is in ads, not on packages, that the FTC staff is considering
mandating the graphs of tar, nicotine and carbon monoxide values.

At the FDA

The FDA attempt to restrict tobacco advertising in the name of children is
taking heat off any FTC effort at tobacco advertising regulation.  The tobacco
industry launched a major legal strike against the FDA proposal earlier this
month, on the deadline for comments.  As the media scrambled to cover the
tobacco industry offensive, the FTC's comment to the FDA got lost in the
shuffle.

But those comments supported the FDA's goal -- to make cigarettes less
accessible and less attractive to children.  The FTC recommended narrowly
tailoring the regulations to that goal to avoid a First Amendment fight but
encouraged the FDA to "consider a coordinated regulatory enforcement approach
with state and local government agencies."

Commissioner Mary L.  Azcuenaga concurred with the FTC filing of comments at
the FDA, but only "insofar as it reflects the Commission's expertise in
analyzing advertising claims."  The constitutionality of the FDA's regulations
is not for the FTC to consider, she said.  "I would have preferred that the
Commission's comment focus on the empirical basis for the assumptions on which
the proposed regulations rest."  Azcuenaga would also have preferred that her
agency's comments have addressed those studies not contained or referenced in
the FDA notice that could "undermine the basis for the proposed regulations."
FDA will have to face that issue sooner or later if there is a First Amendment
challenge, she opined.

The FTC comments also noted that the panel's Notice of Proposed Rulemaking
linked use of tobacco products by kids with advertising but did "not indicate
that tar, nicotine and carbon monoxide ratings play any role in the decisions
of children and adolescents to use tobacco products, or to choose among the
various products."

Advertising industry associations added their voices to the FDA's mountain of
comments.  It is the FTC, not the FDA, that has jurisdiction over tobacco
advertising issues, according to the American Association of Advertising
Agencies (AAAA).  The AAAA also opposes the FDA proposal on First Amendment
grounds but was careful to limit its objections to advertising issues alone.
The ad group did not address whether the FDA has authority to regulate tobacco
products as drugs.

Lighter hand proposed for
prescription drug advertising


The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) should use a looser, less regulatory
style for direct-to-consumer (DTC) advertising of prescription drugs, the FTC
staff has advised.  Important benefits can come from DTC advertising.  But the
current structure required in ads could be limiting those benefits, said staff
members of the FTC's Economics and Consumer Protection Bureaus in comments to
the FDA last week.

Currently, disclosures that appear in ads -- known as "Brief Summaries" -- are
"highly technical, complicated and lengthy," the FTC staff said.  A better
solution might be simple disclosures advising consumers to check with their
doctors for more information.

The FDA's existing brief summary requirement may also inadvertently prevent
price advertising and the use of coupons and other price reduction devices,
according to the FTC staff.  Because price advertising can result in lower
prices, the FDA should consider whether limitations on price advertising are
"necessary and desirable."

Self-regulation may move to labels;
but NLEA not part of the plan


The current self-regulatory mandate for the advertising industry should be
extended to include claims made on product labels, a panel of advertising
industry experts has recommended.  But it is not the industry's business to
consider whether labels meet specific Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
labeling requirements, the panel said.  The National Advertising Review
Council (NARC), overseer of industry self-regulation efforts, is expected to
vote on the group's recommendations within the next few months.

The National Advertising Division (NAD) of the Better Business Bureau, the
first stop for ads in the industry's self-regulation process, has looked at
label claims in past cases.  But it has done so cautiously, admitting in a
1994 case report that "labels are not normally held to be within the
jurisdiction of the NAD."  The panel's recommendations, if accepted, would
make label inquiries commonplace.

But it is the duty of the NAD to evaluate only whether the ads are false,
deceptive or misleading, not whether the labels violate FDA or other
government regulations, the panel stressed.  The FDA maintains rules for
nutrition labeling, promulgated under the Nutrition Labeling Education Act
(NLEA), that are stricter than the FTC standards for food advertising.

In other news:

* Champion's Jogbra may be "technically unsurpassed," but the company had
insufficient evidence that its product was superior to all others in the
category "across-the-board," NAD ruled.  Champion promised to cooperate with
the NAD and "communicate more clearly" intended claims.

* John O.  Butler Company submitted test data for its Secure Denture Adhesive
Paste showing consumers preferred Secure to other denture adhesives.  The test
was flawed, the NAD ruled, and could not back claims that Secure "outholds the
leading brands."  The disputed ads are scheduled to run through January 1996,
after which they will not be repeated, the company said.

* Life Services Supplements, Inc.  agreed to modify ads for its Citri-Thin
Diet Supplement after the NAD expressed concerns that the ads might suggest
that Citri-Thin alone could help shed and keep off pounds.  The ads should
include a statement informing consumers that a proper diet and exercise should
supplement Citri-Thin.

Federalism:
Maine goes it alone
against debt collectors


Well before the GOP-dominated Congress decided to give more power to the
states, the state of Maine decided it would seek a little power on its own.
In 1994 Maine asked to be exempt from the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act
(FDCPA).  The FTC granted that request just before the new year.

The FDCPA, passed in 1978, has always allowed states the option of
independently regulating debt collectors.  In theory, the Act is a minimum
safety net -- states are allowed to pass stricter regulations, but their
regulations must be at least as strict as those outlined in the FDCPA if they
hope to be exempt from the Act.

The FTC has now ruled unanimously that Maine's laws protect consumers at least
as well as the FDCPA.  In some instances, the agency noted, the state offers
better protection.  For instance, Maine has a staff in its Bureau of Consumer
Credit Protection (BCCP) dedicated to protecting the state's consumers from
unfair debt collection practices.  The staff can pursue leads and bring
actions the federal government does not have the manpower to pursue.  And
because Maine takes a "hands-on" enforcement approach, unfair practices can be
stopped quicker, the FTC said, before much damage is done.

Civil penalties are lower under Maine's law than under the FDCPA.  But that
State has an enforcement tool the federal government does not -- revocation of
a debt collector's license.  Maine's "strengths more than offset the
weaknesses," the FTC said.  And Maine consumers may still privately sue debt
collectors under the FDCPA.

Maine is required to file a report with the FTC every two years to keep the
Commission apprised of its activities.  The FTC solicited public comments on
the State's proposal in May, 1994.  [FTC:WATCH No.  413, May 23, 1994]

Top 10 Scams:
Somethings old, nothing new


The names change and one scam may be more popular one year than the next, but
con artists continued to rely on all the old tricks last year.  As the
Telemarketing Sales Rule took effect to ring in the new year, the FTC staff
compiled its list of top 10 scams of 1995.  If this sounds familiar, it is:

1. Sweepstakes - You have not won $25,000.
2. Travel Scams - Impossible-to-meet restrictions apply.
3. Gemstones - Absolutely worthless! How much would you pay?
4. Recovery Rooms - Sorry you lost money. Want to lose some more?
5. Business Opportunities - Vending machines + a little spare time = 
disappointment.
6. Charitable Solicitations - Sometimes, a small portion of your 
contribution actually goes to a charity, but not often.
7. Advance Fee Loans - Money down for empty promises.
8. Toner Rooms - Overpriced office supplies are our specialty.
9. Work at Home Plans - Make Christmas ornaments at home; earn millions.
10. Credit Repair - Able to fix only what's not really broken.

RIP: Six more rules deep sixed


Being a consumer in the 1960s was tough.  The lucky ones dodged the
potentially fatal effects of inhaling quick-freeze aerosol glass frosting
spray and steered clear of nasty itching fits from fiberglass curtains.  But
still they were liable to succumb to shady salesman looking to make a fast
buck on non-prismatic binoculars, too-tiny sleeping bags and tablecloths, and
extension ladders that didn't quite do the job.

The FTC made some rules to stop all that.  All that stopped.  Now, those rules
have gone the way of disco, and not a decade too soon.  By repealing six more
rules, the Commission has now killed seven rules and eight guides.

* The Quick Freeze Spray Rule (1969-1995) required manufacturers of aerosol
spray products used for frosting beverage glasses to warn consumers that
inhaling the product could be fatal.  The product left the market in 1982,
according to the FTC staff, ushered out by that bastion of good taste, Ronco,
Inc., marketer of the Popiel Pocket Fisherman.  No product, no rule, the
Commission said in repealing the rule.

* The Fiberglass Curtain Rule (1967-1995) was likewise unnecessary, since
fiberglass curtains are no longer sold for consumer use.  They were popular in
the 1960s because they were fire retardent.  They were also, well, fiberglass,
which says "itchy" to anyone who knows the material.  But technology has
evolved and many fire-retardent fabrics that do not cause skin irritation have
replaced fiberglass fabrics.  No product, no rule.

* The Binocular Rule (1964-1995) required marketers of non-prismatic
binoculars to say that their product was non-prismatic.  Technology has driven
the price of prisms down since the rule was promulgated, and nearly all
binoculars today use prisms.  Those that don't -- opera and field glasses, for
instance -- are clearly marketed in a category separate from binoculars, the
FTC staff reasoned.  No product, no rule.

* The Sleeping Bag Rule (1963-1995) and the Tablecloth Rule (1964-1995) both
governed the measurements manufacturers could use when advertising, labeling
and marking their products.  The National Conference on Weight and Measures'
Uniform Packaging and Labeling Regulation, adopted by 47 states, now governs
the very same thing, for sleeping bags, tablecloths, etc.  State rules in, fed
rules out, said the FTC.

* Finally, the Extension Ladder Rule (1969-1995) set out rules for labeling
extension ladders.  Surprised?  American National Standards Institute (ANSI)
standard A14 does the same.  Industry standard in, fed rule out.

The FTC's review of old rules continues.  The initiative was started well
before President William Jefferson Clinton and his sidekick, Albert Gore, Jr.,
decided to reinvent government, but they're not complaining about "overzealous
deregulation" at the FTC, either.

Viaticals: Advice on how you can 
take it with you before you go


Terminally ill patients are increasingly cashing in their life insurance
policies and enjoying (or at least using) the money while they can.  The
viatical business is booming and the FTC is now offering a brochure to keep
the dying from going bust.

For the families of the terminally ill, instant cash for a life insurance
policy may seem like money from heaven.  "But viatical arrangements are
complicated, and must be approached cautiously and with great care," said FTC
Consumer Protection Bureau Director Jodie Bernstein.

A new FTC brochure, "Viatical Settlements:  A Guide for People with Terminal
Illnesses," explains the legal, financial and tax consequences of viatical
settlements.  Copies are available through the FTC's Public Reference Branch,
202/326-2222.

"Made in U.S.A." Workshop
scheduled for late March;
consumers reacting


Judging from the latest consumer comments to hit the public record in the
FTC's search for a "Made in the U.S.A."  advertising and labeling standard,
the Commission's old standard is still the best standard.

The FTC has historically required unqualified Made in the U.S.A.  claims to be
backed by a product made entirely, or virtually entirely, in the United
States.  Manufacturers, citing the increasingly global marketplace, have
argued that few products can nowadays meet such a stringent standard.

Consumers, however, have asked the FTC to maintain that high standard for
unqualified claims.  "If 75% of the product was made in the USA and 25% was
made in China, then state that on the label," says one commenter.  More
gruffly, another expressed the same sentiment:  "If a shoe is 20% foreign +
80% [Made in the] USA, say so -- we can handle it."

The Alabama Textile Manufacturers Association, Inc.  agreed.  "The consumer is
entitled to know where a product is manufactured.  We believe any attempt to
'fuzzy' that information is wrong," the association said in urging the FTC to
retain is standard.

The Commission will grapple with "Made in the U.S.A."  advertising and
labeling issues at a public workshop to be held March 26, 27 and possibly even
28, 1996, depending "on the number of issues raised."  Requests to participate
in the conference are due by January 16.

Commissioner Roscoe B.  Starek III dissented without comment on the 4-1
Commission decision to schedule the workshop.  Starek has consistently
resisted efforts to take "Made in the U.S.A."  claims out of the case log and
into the public policy arena.

Arizona therapist network
unlikely to cause problems


An Arizona network of physical, occupational and speech therapists is unlikely
to run afoul of the antitrust laws, according to the FTC staff.  In a December
7, 1995 letter to an attorney representing the proposed Southern Arizona
Therapy Network, Inc.  (SATNET), the FTC gave a clean bill of health to the
venture which, among other things, will rely on a messenger model when
collecting fee information and reporting that information to its members.

Under the messenger model, SATNET will act merely as a messenger of fee
information, collecting it from third-party payers and reporting that
information to its members without recommendation.  The FTC/DOJ Health Care
Statements set out a safety zone for messenger model ventures that leave up to
the venture's individual members decisions on whether to accept or reject
reimbursement levels.

SATNET's plans to collect non-fee information also fall within the safety
zones in the policy statements, the FTC staff said.  And potential future
plans for SATNET to coordinate the setting of capitation rates for its members
is unlikely to cause problems because of the low number of therapists
participating in the plan.  Only 13% of physical therapists in the area, 6% of
occupational therapists and 1% of speech therapists have signed on.

Antitrust immunity raises
international shipping rates?


Collusion is illegal in most industries, but not in the international shipping
industry.  In fact, collusion is actually encouraged in the shipping industry,
and that may lead to higher rates with few offsetting benefits, according to a
new government report.

Paul S.  Clyde of the DOJ's Antitrust Division and James D.  Reitzes, formerly
of the FTC's Economics Bureau, argue that the use of shipping conferences to
set prices for international shipping leads to higher rates when the market
share of the conference participants is high.  The Shipping Act of 1984,
overseen by the Federal Maritime Commission (FMC), grants antitrust immunity
to these conferences, which have existed since the 19th century.  While the
conferences do not act as perfect cartels, they don't promote perfect
competition either, say Clyde and Reitzes in their December, 1995 report, "The
Effectiveness of Collusion Under Antitrust Immunity:  The Case of Liner
Shipping Conferences."

Conference participants must submit rates to the FMC for review and approval.
The FMC is charged with assuring the rates are neither too high nor too low.
In some conferences, shippers are legally allowed to discount the fees they
file.  But in many others, discounting is deemed rebating, a practice that the
FMC condemns.  Between 1985 and 1989, the FMC assessed more than $12 million
in penalties for rebating, the report states, essentially charging companies
with the egregious practice of competing on price.

The evidence "indicates that conferences do not act as perfect cartels
maximizing the joint profits of their members," according to the report.
"Nonetheless, we find that the level of freight rates is significantly lower
on routes where conference members are free to negotiate service contracts
directly with shippers."

The authors note that higher prices were found "on routes where the
conference's market share is relatively high (over 80%)."  There may be
efficiencies that spring from conferences.  But "even if collective pricing is
required to encourage efficiency-enhancing investment, the associated
anticompetitive harm may still outweigh the efficiency benefits."

Care Labeling, Take Two


In November, the Commission asked whether its proposal to allow symbols in
lieu of words on garment care labels was a good idea.  While pondering that
question (until the comment deadline of January 31), consider these other Care
Labeling Rule teasers:

* Should the mention of new technologies, such as "professional wet cleaning,"
be allowed on care labels?

* If a garment can be washed or dry-cleaned, should manufacturers be required
to let consumers know how to wash the product at home?  The rule now allows
such garments to be labeled with the words "dry clean," though they may not
bear the tag "dry clean only."

* Should the FTC clarify what constitutes a "reasonable basis" for care
instructions?

* Should the definition of water temperatures be changed to reflect current
washing machine settings?

Proposed answers to those questions will be accepted until March 12 as the
FTC's review of the Care Labeling Rule continues.  The FTC proposed allowing
"care symbols" on garment tags last November in furtherance of the goals of
the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).  [FTC:WATCH No.  445,
November 20] The FTC staff reasoned that symbols cross borders between the
U.S., Canada and Mexico better than words.  ?Comprende?

Dead Animals (I):  People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) has

Dead Animals (I):  People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) has
weighed in on the FTC's review of its Guides for Select Leather and Imitation
Leather Products.  PETA, a combative animal rights group, has proposed
"ordering" manufacturers to come up with simpler labels for leather and
nonleather goods.  The group recommends that all leather products be labeled
"Animals Suffered to Make This Product."  Any non-leather good could be
labeled a "Cruelty-free Product."  In this respect, PETA differs from the
National Consumers League (NCL), which has asked the FTC to examine the use of
general claims such as "cruelty-free."  NCL believes such claims are fuzzy.

Dead Animals (II):  Leather Industries of America, Inc.  has asked the
Commission to set a minimum leather content standard -- 75% -- for products
labeled as "bonded leather."  Bonded leather is leather and non-leather bonded
together to make a consumer product.  The FTC's Leather Guides currently allow
use of the term bonded leather even if only 1% of a product is leather,
according to Leather Industries President Charles S.  Myers.

Stephen F.  Quill, President of Ecological Fibers, Inc.  suggests calling
products with a low leather content "reinforced bonded leather."  Quill's firm
makes book bindings that contain 20% leather.  That's not 100% leather, but
"we certainly believe that if you add the word 'reinforced' anyone would know
that it is not directly from the cow," Quill told the FTC.

Sunsetting:  Got an FTC administrative order more than 20 years old?  No you
don't.  Orders now automatically sunset on their 20th birthday.  January 2
marked the mass sunset of old orders under the Commission's new automatic
sunset policy.  Oly oly in free.

entities" to serve as trustees, here's your big chance.  Send your name,

Compliance Division, Bureau of Competition, Federal Trade Commission, Suite

Mobile Radio:  A federal district court judge has granted the FTC's request
for a preliminary injunction barring Falcon Crest Communications from using
false claims when selling brokerage services to consumers who hold federal
paging and mobile radio licenses.  The licenses themselves were often the
not-so-valuable fruit of a previous investment scam, according to the FTC.
Falcon Crest offered to find high-paying buyers for those licenses, a feat it
was unlikely to accomplish, the FTC charged.  The PI bars false claims and
freezes the assets of Falcon, its parent company, Republic Communications
Corp., and company officers and salesmen Joel H.  Cohen, Jordan Drew, Gary
Perry and Nicholas Vasti.  [FTC Press Release, December 27; Contact:  Stephen

Thomas says: antitrust


At the end of 1995, FTC:WATCH asked the House of Representatives computer
system how many bills involving antitrust issues had been introduced during
the year.  Answer:  96.

Here they are.  Those items having the largest concentration of the relevant
term ("antitrust") appear first in the list.

1 .  Professional  Baseball Antitrust  Reform Act  of 1995  (Introduced in the
House) [H.R.386]

2 .  To provide that professional baseball teams, and leagues composed of such
teams, shall be subject to the antitrust laws.  (Introduced in the House)
[H.R.749]

3 .  Major League Baseball Antitrust Reform Act of 1995 (Introduced in the
Senate) [S.416]

Recovery room telemarketer
must get $250,000 bond backing

The FTC accused Sherri L.  Pollock last January of participating in a scheme
that combined two of the hottest cons on the telemarketing circuit:  the
recovery room and telefunding.  Pollock last month agreed to post a $250,000
surety bond before conducting telemarketing in the future as part of a
settlement of those charges.  Pollock is the last defendant to settle in the
FTC's case against PFR, Inc.

When soliciting charitable donations or payments for prizes or awards, Pollock
agreed not to falsely represent any material facts.  Pollock further agreed to
avoid false representations when telemarketing any good or service.  She will
monitor her employees to make sure they avoid misrepresentations as well,
under the terms of a stipulated final judgment filed in federal court last
month.

The U.S.  Attorney's Office in Las Vegas, the Las Vegas office of the Federal
Bureau of Investigation and the Nevada Attorney General's Telemarketing Unit
assisted the FTC with its case against PFR.  The case was jointly handled by
the FTC's Division of Service Industry Practices and the FTC's San Francisco
Regional Office.

Indictment filed in
job promotion case


The U.S.  Attorney's Office has charged Debra Mink, sole proprietor of an
allegedly bogus job placement service operated under the name International
Services, with 45 counts of wire and mail fraud.  Ads for International
Services allegedly implied the company knew of available jobs, had ties to
Fortune 1000 companies and had an 80% placement rate, none of which was true.

The suit could land Mink in a federal penitentiary for several years if
successful, based on current Federal Sentencing Guidelines.  But first, the
government must find her.  Mink disappeared during the FTC's civil case
against her.  There is a warrant out for her arrest and the Federal Bureau of
Investigation (FBI) is involved in the search.

By accepting orders for her allegedly bogus service over the phone, Mink
committed wire fraud, according to the indictment.  Ang sending checks through
the mail or by Federal Express to pay for ads placed in newspapers across the
country qualifies as mail fraud, the indictment states.

Though ads promised significant job placement assistance, Mink's business
consisted mainly of resume preparation, according to the indictment.

Last September a federal district court judge ordered Mink to pay a
$593,206.27 judgment, the amount the court determined had been taken in the
scheme.

Calorie claims don't add up
for Mama Tish's ice cups, agency alleges


Representations for Mama Tish's Italian Specialties ice cups get a chilly
reception from the FTC.  Ads praised the benefits of Mama Tish's ice cups,
notably that they are "naturally low in calories."  But of the company's ten
regular flavors and two Nutrasweet-sweetened flavors of ice cups, none
qualified as low in calories, the FTC charged.

The Food and Drug Administration, in rules promulgated under the Nutrition
Labeling and Education Act (NLEA), defines a low calorie food as one having 40
or fewer calories per serving.  Mama Tish's regular flavor ice cups contained
between 104 and 145 calories per serving, according to the FTC, and the two
flavors sweetened with Nutrasweet contained 60 calories per serving.

Mama Tish's has agreed not to misrepresent the amount of calories or "any
other nutrient or ingredient" in any frozen dessert products.  A safe harbor
in the proposed consent order against Mama Tish's would allow any claims
permitted under FDA regulations promulgated under the NLEA.

The case was handled by the FTC's Chicago Regional Office.

"Project Telesweep" cleans up again


A telephone vending machine seller has agreed to pay a $10,000 civil penalty
and hang up some of his alleged sales practices.  Fitzgerald Lewis, president
of Quartercall Communications, Inc., was charged in July with failing to
provide his customers with disclosure documents required by the Franchise Rule
when selling telephone vending machine business opportunities.  Charges
against Lewis stemmed from "Project Telesweep," an enormous federal/state
crackdown of business opportunity fraud.

Budding entrepreneurs bought telephone vending machines from Lewis hoping to
install them in some public location where they would bring in rates of a
quarter a minute.  Lewis made claims of specific earnings, according to the
FTC.  But Lewis neither backed those earnings claims in writing, nor provided
his customers with the required disclosure documents, the FTC charged.

In addition to the civil penalty, Lewis has agreed not to violate the
Franchise Rule.  He will not misrepresent material facts when selling any
franchise or business opportunity in the future, under the terms of a proposed
consent order filed in federal court.

Training program part of
Funeral Rule settlement


A.H.  Peters Funeral Home of posh Grosse Pointe (Michigan) allegedly failed to
provide its customers with a number of price lists as the FTC's Funeral Home
Services Rule requires.  A.H.  Peters also conditioned the sale of some goods
on the purchase of other goods, the FTC charged, a no-no under the Rule.
What's the funeral home to do?

For starters, A.H.  Peters and its officers, Roy A.  Peters and David L.
Peters, have agreed to pay a $60,000 civil penalty.  To make sure they won't
make the same alleged mistake twice, they have agreed to institute a training
program for the funeral home's employees to guarantee compliance with the
Rule.

According to the FTC, the suburban Detroit funeral home failed to give its
customers a general price list as the Rule requires.  Same goes for the casket
price list.  And the outer burial price list.  And an itemized written
statement of goods and services selected.

A.H.  Peters has agreed not to violate the Rule in the future.

Columbia/HCA's oops


Read the fine print.  That's the lesson for Columbia/HCA Healthcare
Corporation lawyers, who have asked the Commission to remove a commercial
lease from the company's divestiture requirements.  The fact that the lease
was slated to be divested at all is a "minor mistake," Columbia/HCA attorneys
argue.

Columbia/HCA has asked that the lease for office space used by Infusamed, an
infusion services company, be removed from a hold separate requirement and
promises to file a second request shortly asking that the lease be removed
from the company's divestiture requirements.

Columbia/HCA is required to divest properties in several areas of the country
to settle antitrust charges arising from its acquisition of Healthtrust, Inc.
One of those areas is Salt Lake City, Utah, where Columbia/HCA has agreed to
divest a package of assets referred to as the "Utah Healthtrust Assets."  The
lease got lumped in with that package mistakenly, according to Columbia/HCA.

The public will have 10 days -- not the usual 30 -- to comment on
Columbia/HCA's proposed change.

GM order changed


General Motors has convinced the Federal Trade Commissioners to soften a 1979
order that bars the car maker from placing the name of a car division on an
engine label unless the car division also manufactured the engine (i.e., no
fair identifying Oldsmobiles as having "Rocket 88" engines when the engines
were built by, say, the Chevrolet Division and installed in Chevy's as well).

GM's corporate restructurings since 1979 have resulted in the removal of
engine production from the nameplate divisions that existed then.  This
automotive alchemy constitutes changed conditions of fact, determined the
Commission, allowing it to reopen and modify the order.  Under the modified
order in C-2966, GM can display brand nameplates on engines that are
materially different from those displaying all other brand nameplates, and
cannot display different brand nameplates on identical engines.

Schnuck supermarket divestiture


What goes around may come around, sort of.

When Schnuck Markets, Inc.  acquired supermarkets owned by National Holdings,

divesting 23 stores in that area to a newly formed company, Family Company of

of the National Holdings, Inc.  supermarket chain."

If the divestitures are allowed, Family would become the third-largest

Remembering Phil Areeda
by Robert Pitofsky


(Phillip Areeda died at the age of 65 Sunday, December 24.  1995)

With the death of Phil Areeda last month, the academic community has lost a
towering figure.  Those of us who teach law and try to engage in scholarship
know better than most that, without him, the world is a lesser place.

Much of Phil Areeda's public life was committed to antitrust scholarship and
his teaching at Harvard Law School.  I once mentioned to Phil that his
treatise was the longest in the history of Western thought not written in
German.  He enjoyed the description.  At the time he was still working on
volume six or seven, and his response was:  "you have no idea".  At his death,
he was working on volume eleven (and anxious that there would not be time
enough to complete the task) and planning volume twelve.

The treatise --unique in legal scholarship in its ambition and scope -- was
begun jointly with Donald Turner and completed with the help of Herb
Hovenkamp.

When work on this treatise started, antitrust was a jumble of conflicting
ideologies, irreconcilable cases and some diffuse and half--baked ideas.  The
goal of the authors was nothing less than to bring some order out of that
chaos and they succeeded admirably.  It is amazing the way sections of the
treatise migrated directly to Court of Appeals and Supreme Court decisions and
established the standard for competitive behavior.

Other aspects of Phil Areeda's scholarship were special.  He was endlessly
careful and meticulous -- some scholars would conclude after two or three
drafts,that they were "close enough" to being right and move on.  Phil never
quit reworking a subject until he was fully-satisfied.  There is also a
quality of "fairness" in his work -- to scholars with whom he might disagree,
to legislative intent, to prior judicial opinions -- that is all too rare in
scholarship.  It often appeared that Phil was at greater pains in stating
fairly the position of adversaries than in elaborating his own views.  He
always tried to give judicial decisions the benefit of a best rather than a
worst interpretation.  Even when he disagreed, he did so with respect and
without rancor.  Finally, Phil was comfortable with ideology but practical as
well.  He recognized that people and courts are fallible, and that life is not
invariably rational, and his interpretations and conclusions reflect that
understanding.

Much of the history of antitrust development in recent decades involves the
integration of economics into antitrust analysis.  Phil Areeda (along with Don
Turner) were among the very best in bringing economic analysis to bear without
allowing it to become overly technical or impractical.  It is common now for
legal briefs and scholarly analysis in the antitrust field to cite and discuss
economic insights as well as legal precedent.  That was not true (or at least
not as true) before Phil helped reshape the field.

While most people are aware of Phil's work through the treatise, his principal
commitment may have been as a teacher at the Harvard Law School.  He was
exceptionally popular in the classroom and invariably respected.  Some have
described his teaching (heavy with the traditional Socratic method) as
orthodox and even "old-fashioned.  That is a fair description if
"old--fashioned" means that he was rigorous in class, well organized, and
constantly courteous to his students.  Unlike the current style in some
quarters, Phil in the classroom was not there to inculcate students with his
personal views of the world, but rather to teach a subject.  He brought to the
classroom a sense that he thought his subject was interesting and important,
and an infectious enthusiasm that never waned.

Somewhere along the way, Phil developed a discriminating taste for good food,
good wine, good books and opera.  His wine cellar was the most extraordinary
private collection I have seen.  Occasionally we would have lunch or dinner at
excellent places like Lutece, the famous French restaurant in New York.  Phil
was a connoisseur and knew the best from second-best, but once the meal
started, he never discussed the food or the wine -- he enjoyed them and
discussed other interesting things.

Through his teaching, Phil influenced the attitudes and careers of thousands
of Harvard students.  The Areeda Turner Treatise and his other scholarship
were the most important and constructive influences on antitrust policy in a
generation.  Scores of scholars around the country can testify to his
generosity in offering advice, ideas, even inspiration.  Shortly before his
death, Phil said "my life has been teaching and writing."  It was a life well
lived.
