'SIGNIFICANT ENFORCEMENT HAMMER' IS NEEDED TO BACK UP HOUSE 
COMMITTEE FOOD ADDITIVE REPORT RECOMMENDATIONS:  McINTOSH AND 
SOUDER

The enforcement mechanisms for the recommendations in "The 
FDA Food Additive Review Process:  Backlog and Failure to 
Observe Statutory Deadline," the Government Reform and 
Oversight Committee's recent report, are inadequate, 
committee members Rep. David McIntosh (R-Ind.) and Rep. Mark 
Souder (R-Ind.) said in "additional views" printed with the 
report  (See FOOD CHEMICAL NEWS, Dec. 18, Page 41).

Both McIntosh and Souder are freshman legislators; McIntosh 
has been active in the House efforts to enact regulatory 
reform legislation and repeal the Delaney clause (See FOOD 
CHEMICAL NEWS, Nov. 20, Page 16).

"Currently, the Food and Drug Administration's delay in 
approving food additives is caused by inertia within the 
agency," McIntosh and Souder noted, adding:  "While that 
inertia can be somewhat alleviated through instructions to 
do better, I am convinced that it cannot be eliminated 
without a significant enforcement hammer.   I am 
particularly concerned that the recommendations include a 
relaxation of the statutory deadline for a decision on a 
food additive from 180 to 360 days.  While relaxing the 
statutory deadline makes some sense, it also makes sense to 
transform it into a meaningful one."

If the time frames in the report were expected to be 360 
days, then after a brief period -- 90 days perhaps  -- the 
statute should provide FDA with three options, the Indiana 
representatives said.  Those options are:  (1)  issue a 
regulation approving the use of the additive; (2) disapprove 
the use of the additive, but only if FDA can demonstrate 
that an additive has not been found to be safe; or (3) if 
FDA fails to do either, the additive is deemed to be 
approved.

"In this way, FDA is provided with an incentive to engage in 
a real cost/benefit analysis in the allocation of its 
resources," they added, noting:  "... unless hammers such as 
this one are incorporated into the regulatory schemes we 
have developed, we are destined to see agencies fail to meet 
statutory deadlines and justify their failures with claims 
of too much work and too few resources."

Six Report Recommendations Include Elimination of Pending 
Petitions' Backlog within One Year

The report's six recommendations were:  

-- Congress should amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic 
Act review period for food additive petitions from 180 to 
360 days for the most scientifically complex reviews, and 
the deadline should be strictly observed by FDA;  

FDA should recognize that the approval of useful and safe 
new products can be as important to the public health as 
preventing the marketing of harmful or ineffective products; 

FDA should eliminate the backlog of pending food additive 
petitions within one year by reallocating the necessary 
agency resources; 

FDA should utilize outside expertise in its evaluation of 
food additive petitions but retain authority for petition 
approval; 

the relevance of the Delaney clause should be studied in 
view of modern scientific standards so that better 
distinctions can be made between nominal hazards and actual 
risks, and 

FDA should amend the review process to prohibit anonymous 
submission of data or comments.  ((6FCN 4602, 14 pages, $8)

WEBB TECHNICAL GROUP TAKES FSIS CONTRACT DISPUTE TO SEN. 
HELMS 

Raleigh-based Webb Technical Group, Inc. urged North 
Carolina Sen. Jesse Helms (R) to step in and prevent the 
Food Safety and Inspection Service from cancelling a meat 
and poultry analysis contract (See FOOD CHEMICAL NEWS, Aug. 
28, Page 26).  

The firm alleges that FSIS made the decision without 
conducting the necessary cost-benefit analysis.

Webb said the contract cancellation would result in the loss 
of 17 jobs, waste hundreds of thousands of taxpayer dollars, 
and threaten meat and poultry safety.  


"It has been suggested that the real savings planned by FSIS 
is to eliminate this work, which would further violate the 
intent of Congress to assure a safe and wholesome food 
supply for U.S. consumers," Board Chairman Neil Webb said in 
a recent letter to Helms.

"Either FSIS has a hidden agenda, or they just don't know 
what they are doing," Webb stated.  "Either way, we would 
appreciate some help in getting to the bottom of this."

According to the firm, Webb has conducted residue and 
compositional testing for FSIS for the past 13 years -- 
specifically, monitoring the meat supply for economic fraud 
and verifying the safety of domestic and imported meat 
products.  On July 25, 1995, Webb was advised that FSIS 
would not renew the contract "due to change in the program 
requirements."  Webb said it found out that FSIS had planned 
to analyze all meat and poultry food chemistry samples in 
its Technical Services laboratories beginning next fiscal 
year.

Webb said the government never proved that such a decision 
would be fiscally sound.  In October, FSIS responded that it 
had not violated procurement regulations when it dropped the 
contract, and that FSIS would be using new technology and 
upgrading equipment at its own laboratories to increase 
efficiency.  Webb argued that USDA guidelines barred the 
North Carolina firm from using new alternate technologies. 

Webb asked for a meeting with Helms' staff on the issue, and 
asked the senator to contact USDA Secretary Dan Glickman "to 
get to the bottom of the situation."  ((6FCN 4604, 19 pages, 
$9)

USDA 'WHOLESOMENESS' SEAL SHOULD BE DROPPED, WARNING LABEL 
ADDED TO CURED MEATS, GROUPS SAY IN PETITION TO FSIS

Jeremy Rifkin's Foundation on Economic Trends and the 
Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine have filed a 
petition with USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service 
seeking removal of the "wholesomeness" seal, stronger 
language on safe handling labels and a warning label on 
cured meat products.

USDA received the petition Oct. 26 but did not place it on 
file in the hearing clerk's office until recently.  The 
groups had been considering suing USDA to stop use of the 
"wholesomeness" seal; the petition cites legal precedents 
and the Federal Meat Inspection Act (FMIA) as the basis for 
the groups' claims (See FOOD CHEMICAL NEWS, July 31, Page 
2).

The petition, written by FET's Theodore Waugh and the 
Physicians Committee's Andrew Nicholson, cites the risk to 
consumers from E. coli O157:H7 as the basis for the groups' 
requests.  "The risk of serious permanent physical injury 
and death, USDA's inability to safeguard the meat supply and 
the lack of medical preparedness indicate both the 
seriousness and extent of the E. coli problem," the petition 
said, adding, "Until effective control measures are 
developed to eliminate E. coli contamination, USDA needs to 
take further actions to protect consumers and conform with 
its statutory obligations."

The petitioners misstated the scope of USDA's declaration 
that E. coli O157:H7 was an adulterant.  The USDA 
declaration applied only to raw ground beef; the petition 
said that "USDA has determined that E. coli-contaminated 
meats are 'adulterated.'"

The petition quoted the FMIA as saying, "It is essential in 
the public interest that the health and welfare of consumers 
be protected by assuring that meat and meat food products 
distributed to them are wholesome, not adulterated ... 
Unwholesome, adulterated and/or misbranded meat and meat 
food products ... result in ... injury to consumers."

"Thus, according to USDA's own regulations, only meats 
lacking E. coli contamination can be labeled 'Inspected and 
Passed,'" the petition said, adding, "Because the FMIA 
prohibits misleading and false labeling, the USDA must 
remove the 'Inspected and Passed' labels from meat products 
until it can conclusively determine that the meat is 
uncontaminated with the adulterant E. coli."

Nicholson and Waugh said that USDA's baseline survey of 
steers and heifers found that "approximately 15% of all raw 
beef samples contain one or more species of pathogens " (See 
FOOD CHEMICAL NEWS, Feb. 7, 1994, Page 60).  They also cited 
a Sept. 22 ABC News "20/20" show that quoted "USDA doctors" 
as saying that "probably one out of every thousand 
hamburgers contains E. coli bacteria."

The petition also said that USDA has admitted its sampling 
program for E. coli O157:H7 in raw ground beef "cannot 
eliminate E. coli from the food supply."

Safe Handling Labels Inadequate, Cured Meats Should Have 
Warning Labels, Groups Say

"It is clear the number of outbreaks has remained high or 
continued to grow even with USDA's safe care and handling 
labels," the groups said, adding, "In light of the 
continuing number of E. coli outbreaks, it is necessary for 
USDA to improve the current safe handling labels."  The 
labels should state the consequences of undercooking, the 
petition said, explaining:

"How can consumers adapt their behavior to meet the 
seriousness of the health risk when they are uninformed of 
the potential consequences?  For all a purchaser knows, the 
only illness resulting from contamination is an upset 
stomach.  If individuals knew that kidney failure and death 
were potential side effects, they would take the warnings 
with the degree of seriousness that the hazard requires."

The petitioners recommended a new safe handling label that 
would begin:  "WARNING: This product may contain E. coli 
bacteria, which can cause serious illness, including:  
death, strokes, seizures, bloody diarrhea, renal failure, 

red blood cell destruction."  Anyone suffering from 
abdominal cramps or diarrhea a few days after consumption 
should consult a physician immediately, the label would 
recommend, as well as stating that the product should be 
cooked until no red color remains, to a minimum temperature 
of 155 F.  

The labels should be bigger and in larger type than the 
current ones, the petitioners said.

They called for a similar warning for cured meat products, 
noting that "it has become clear that E. coli contamination 
can survive the curing process. ... In light of this 
potential danger, USDA should warn consumers of cured meat's 
potential dangers, and at the very least, the agency must 
remove the 'Inspected and Passed' labels from cured meat 
products until it can be certain that the meat is not 
adulterated with E. coli."

"If USDA ignores this request, the agency will have acted in 
an arbitrary and capricious manner in violation of the 
Administrative Procedures Act," the petitioners said.

MOLD CONTENT OF SEVERAL TYPES OF COMMERCIAL POPCORN 
DETERMINED

Noting a general lack of information on molds in popcorn, 
researchers undertook a study of the mold content of popcorn 
in commercial channels, reporting their findings in the 
September 1995 issue of the Journal of Food Protection.

Sarath Katta and colleagues, University of Nebraska, 
Lincoln, Nebr., determined the internal mold infection 
levels of various microwave and nonmicrowave popcorn by 
direct plating of kernels on Dichloran-rose bengal-
chloramphenicol agar (DRBC), Dichloran-18% glycerol agar 
(DG-18), Aspergillus flavus/parasiciticus agar (AFPA) and 
Czapek's iprodione agar (CZID).

The total percentage of mold-infected kernels was low in 
microwave yellow popcorn (5.9%) and nonmicrowave yellow 
popcorn (7.3%), but somewhat higher in specialty popcorn 
(13.6%) and nonmicrowave white popcorn (15.1%), according to 
the report.

Of the molds found, Fusarium species predominated in the 
microwave yellow popcorn (54.2%) and nonmicrowave white 
popcorn (66.2%), whereas Aspergillus species predominated in 
the nonmicrowave yellow popcorn (43.8%) and specialty popcorn 
(52.9%).  Negligible amounts of Aspergillus flavus-
parasiticus molds were found in the samples evaluated.

No significant differences were found among media in 
enumerating total mold infection levels.  DG-18 was 
effective in enumerating Aspergillus species, but 
ineffective for Fusarium species, the researchers reported.  
They recommended that either AFPA or CZID be used to 
determine the total percentage of mold infection levels in 
popcorn.

Effects of Storage Conditions on Popcorn Mold Content 
Assessed

Also in the same issue, Katta and Lloyd Bullerman, also of 
the University of Nebraska, reported their findings on a 
study of the effects of high temperature and relative 
humidity, as well as packaging, on the mold content and 
quality of stored popcorn.

White and yellow popcorn were stored in different containers 
at high temperature (35 C) and high relative humidity (85%) 
for three months.  Gradual decreases in popping volumes with 
the lengthening of storage time were observed in both white 
and yellow popcorn, the researchers reported.

Few differences were found in total infection levels up to 
60 days of storage, except that the Aspergillus glaucus 
group became established in place of field fungi.  A gradual 
increase in mold infection levels was then observed during 
the remaining 30 days of storage.  Visible mold growth was 
also observed on the tops of some kernels by the end of 
storage studies, according to the report.

Internal mold infection in white popcorn stored in an open 
container was lower (18.3%) than in white popcorn stored in a 
closed plastic bag (75%) and closed plastic jar (85.3%), 
whereas the internal mold infection in yellow popcorn stored 
in an open container was higher (23.3%) than in yellow 
popcorn stored in a closed plastic bag (6.3%) and closed 
plastic jar (2.6%), the report stated.

Mycoflora of Various Cereal Flakes Determined

German researchers examined 12 brands of cereal flakes for 
their qualitative and quantitative mold contamination, 
reporting their findings in the July 1995 issue of the same 
journal.

M. Weidenborner and B. Kunz, of the Universitat Bonn, in 
Bonn, Germany, reported higher fungal counts in two wheat 
and one oat flake samples, while the remaining brands showed 
minor contamination rates.

The fungal flora consisted of 64 different species belonging 
to 23 fungal genera, with fungi of the Eurotium, Aspergillus 
and Penicillium predominant in most samples, according to the 
report.

To obtain a comprehensive evaluation, the mycoflora of 
foodstuffs should be investigated on at least three 
different media, the researchers concluded.

Simplified Method for Aflatoxin Extraction From Peanuts 
Reported

Also in the same issue, researchers reported a simplified 
method for extraction of aflatoxin from peanut meal and 
kernels by CO2-methanol, using a highly pressurized fluid 
extraction process.

Pei-Yin Wu, Da Yeh Institute of Technology, Changhwa, 
Taiwan, and Robin Chiou, National Chiayi Institute of 
Agriculture, Chiayi, Taiwan, used peanut kernels infected 
with Aspergillus parasiticus after milling into meals as a 
naturally contaminated material for investigating the 
efficacy of supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) as a 
technique for removing aflatoxin.  Methanol solutions (60% 
and 100%) were used to modify the properties of the 
extraction media, and extraction parameters such as 
pressure, methanol concentration, methanol/peanut meal ratio 
and holding time were extensively investigated.

Results using this technique were comparable to those 
obtained using a commercialized immunochemical method, 
according to the report.

FDA PROCEDURES FOR HANDLING OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION 
DESCRIBED IN POLICY STATEMENT

In response to inquiries concerning its use of confidential 
information in rulemaking, the Food and Drug Administration 

Dec. 27 published a "Statement of Procedures for Handling 
Confidential Information in Rulemaking."  

The cigarette and smokeless tobacco companies questioned FDA 
policy following the agency's August 1995 publication of a 
proposed rule concerning regulation of nicotine-containing 
cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products.  Noting that the 
statement was developed to address this industry's specific 
concerns, the agency said the procedures described reflect 
docket management procedures "long used" by FDA in 
rulemaking.    

According to the statement, FDA does not make available 
trade secret information, confidential commercial 
information or other information "whose disclosure would 
constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of privacy."  In 
addition, no information that would "reveal the identity of 
confidential sources" would be placed into a public docket, 
the agency noted.  

While trying to assure that "clearly proprietary 
information" is not "unwittingly made available," FDA 
advised that information submitted to a public docket does 
not carry a "reasonable expectation of confidentiality."  
The agency contends it is under "no legal obligation" to 
closely examine submitted documents to determine whether 
they "may contain proprietary information."  

FDA is aware, however, of the "sensitivity and importance" 
of such information, and has "long followed" certain 
procedures to try to ensure that "clearly proprietary 
information" is not made available, the agency said, noting 
that it scans documents for "obvious trade secrets or 
personal privacy information."  

According to the statement, information marked "confidential" 
is referred to the appropriate center's Freedom of Information 
Act officers, FDA added, for a determination as to whether it 
will be exempt under the act from public disclosure.  Before 
any documents containing such "confidential" information are 
placed on public record, the appropriate center consults with 
the person(s) who submitted the documents as to whether it was 
intended that the document be made available to the public, 
the agency said.

NCTR SCIENCE BOARD TO MEET  FOR SITE VISIT REPORT, RESOURCE 
DISCUSSIONS 

The Food and Drug Administration announced Dec. 29, 1995 
that a meeting of the Science Advisory Board to the National 
Center for Toxicological Research will be held Jan. 29 and 
Jan. 30 at NCTR in Jefferson, Ark.  

At the meeting, the board will be given a progress report on a 
recommendation resulting from its Site Visit Team Report on 
NCTR's Analytical Methods Development program.  In addition, a 
presentation will be made and the board will be asked to 
review the center's integration of the eight programs the 
board has visited.  According to the FDA notice, the 
presentation will include a discussion of the resources 
allocated to these programs, as well as their relation to 
NCTR's strategic vision and goals.  

The closed portion of the board's meeting will focus on 
"personal information" concerning individuals involved with 
NCTR's research programs, disclosure of which would 
constitute a "clearly unwarranted invasion of personal 
privacy," FDA noted.  For additional information, contact 
Ronald Coene, NCTR, 301-443-3155.

HEN STRAIN AFFECTS HOW DIET CHANGES LIPIDS IN POULTRY 
PRODUCTS

Fatty acid metabolism may vary between strains of laying 
hens, according to researchers, who observed differences in 
how several strains incorporated a specific polyunsaturated 
acid from their diets.  But the differences were relatively 
small, and in general, PUFA in the diet produced marked 
increases in PUFA in the eggs and meat of the birds, 
according to the researchers' report in the October 1995 
issue of the Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry.

Geetha Cherian and colleagues, University of Alberta, 
Edmonton, Canada, studied the effects of feeding diets high 
or low in alpha-linolenic acid on the lipid and fatty acid 
composition of the liver and subdermal fat or on products 
such as eggs, white meat and dark meat of six different 
strains of laying hens.

The researchers noted that increasing the polyunsaturated to 
saturated fatty acid ratio of egg yolk or tissue lipids would 
make poultry products more acceptable to health-conscious 
consumers.

Natural Antioxidants as Vegetable Oil Preservatives 
Investigated

Also in the same issue, Spanish researchers reported on 
their investigation into how some naturally formed oxidized 
lipid/amino acid reaction products are able to protect bulk 
vegetable oils against oxidation.

Manuel Alaiz and colleagues, Instituto de la Grasa, CSIC, 
Seville, Spain, undertook a study to determine if the reaction 
products are able to stop or slow a peroxidative process 
initiated in a vegetable oil.

Their findings suggest that some of the reaction products 
might be playing an antioxidative role in foods by delaying 
the peroxidative process at the same time that they are 
being produced, according to the report.  The researchers 
noted that special attention has been given to natural 
antioxidants in recent years because of the possible, but 
not yet proven, hazardous effects of synthetic antioxidants.

Stability of Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids in Egg Powder 
Assessed

High spray-drying temperatures led to a higher loss of many 
polyunsaturated fatty acids in egg powder, according to a 
report in the August 1995 issue of the same journal.

Francesc Guardiola and colleagues, University of Barcelona 
and CSIC, Barcelona, Spain, studied the influence of 
different factors, including spray-drying temperature, kind 
of antioxidant, antioxidant concentration and packing 
conditions on PUFA losses in egg powder stored for 10 
months.

Storage of egg powder under vacuum away from light 
effectively prevents the loss of many PUFA, according to the 
researchers, who also reported that antioxidants may be 
slightly effective in preventing PUFA losses under highly 
oxidative conditions.

The researchers recommended that spray-dried egg yolk not be 
used as a long-chain PUFA source for enriching weaning 
foods, since oxidized fatty acids "lose their essentiality 
and present several harmful biological effects."

Hydrolysis Seen as Major Cause of Deterioration in Frozen 
Trout

Also in the same issue, Swedish researchers reported that 
hydrolysis is the major cause of lipid deterioration in 
frozen farmed rainbow trout fillets.

Torbjorn Ingemansson and colleagues, SIK-The Swedish 
Institute for Food Research, Goteborg, and Karlshamns 
LipidTeknik, Stockholm, Sweden, studied the extent of lipid 
hydrolysis and oxidation in the muscle tissue of frozen 
rainbow trout to elucidate the effects of acclimatization 
temperature and storage time on these mechanisms, using 
multivariate statistical methods.

Lower water temperature during acclimatization (5 C rather 
than 12 C) resulted in reduced lipid stability during frozen 
storage, according to the report.

ACSH WANTS DELANEY REPLACED WITH FLEXIBL  NEW REGULATORY 
PROCESS

The American Council on Science and Health called on 
Congress to repeal the Delaney clause, so that regulatory 
agencies would be free to balance risks against benefits and 
use a more appropriate weight of evidence test in regulating 
food additive risks.

In a new booklet, "Modernize Our Food Safety Laws:  Delete 
the Delaney Clause," ACSH argued that the zero-risk standard 
has been a "scientifically indefensible double standard," 
and that public interest groups who support the measure 
would "lose power" if the measure were repealed.

"Strict enforcement will endanger the food supply, raising 
prices and making it even harder for Americans to consume 
the very fruits and vegetables that have been linked to 
reduced cancer rates and improved health," warned Elizabeth 
Whelan, president of ACSH.

The New York City-based group said a replacement to the 
Delaney clause should provide a flexible regulatory process, 
not a specific standard.  As part of the new process, tumors 
or cancers should not be the sole or even primary regulatory 
concern, ACSH said, explaining:  "Regulators should consider 
a broad range of possible health risks, including cancer."

It may be necessary to legislate that regulators cannot use 
worst-case assumptions in calculating risk except under 
extraordinary circumstances, the group said.  "By piling 
worst-case assumption upon worst-case assumption, regulators 
easily can overestimate risks by multiples of millions," the 
report said.

Regulators should take into account negative and "no effect" 
test results as well as positive results, the report 
recommended, noting that current law only allows regulators 
to consider the positive development of tumors.


Each substance should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, 
and human exposure and epidemiology should be taken into 
account, it added.  "A substance that is toxic to some 
animals is not necessarily toxic to humans, and vice versa," 
the report said.

Such an approach would be far from perfect, the group 
acknowledged, adding:  "But it would come much closer to 
scientific honesty and prioritization of risks than what we 
have now or would be likely to get from any bright-line 
approach."

The report also reviews past applications of the Delaney 
clause, the Environmental Protection Agency's reform 
efforts, "mouse terrorism," and the politics of Delaney 
repeal.  The group rejected the latest attempt to override 
Delaney with an amendment by Sen. Charles Grassley (R-Iowa) 
to S 343, which was one of the regulatory reform measures.  

"It leaves in place the Delaney clause and does not directly 
amend it, perhaps inviting litigation," ACSH said.  Also, 
the group said the amendment would have set a new standard 
for barring products on account of risk, regardless of its 
benefits.

CSPI RAISES NEW ISSUES WITH OLESTRA FOOD ADDITIVE PETITION

The Center for Science in the Public Interest Jan. 2 
alerted the Food and Drug Administration to new research 
showing beta-carotene's cancer-fighting ability and to the 
new Dietary Guidelines for Americans' recommendations as 
reasons to deny the olestra food additive petition.

CSPI said the latest study by Harinder Garewal of the 
Veterans Administration Medical Center in Tucson involved 
giving 50 patients a daily dose of 60 mg of beta-carotene 
for six months.  Unpublished results found 26 (52%) patients 
responded to beta-carotene, with their oral leukoplakia 
diminishing, CSPI reported. 

"The result is similar to that found in an earlier study by 
Garewal that used half as much beta-carotene," CSPI 
Executive Director Michael Jacobson said.  Garewal said his 
subjects were not deficient in vitamin A.

According to CSPI, intervention trials have demonstrated 
that beta-carotenoid causes regression of oral leukoplakia, 
which is believed to be a precursor of oral cancer.  FDA has 
stated that a critical issue regarding olestra is whether 
carotenoids, blood levels of which are depleted by olestra, 
serve any biological purpose in humans other than beta-
carotene's role as a provitamin A.

CSPI's Jacobson also took the opportunity to point to the 
newly released Dietary Guidelines for Americans, which 
emphasize the importance of carotenoids as cancer-fighters, 
as inconsistent with FDA's action in considering an additive 
that would reduce carotenoid absorption from foods.

Dietary Guidelines Special Mention Of Beta-Carotene Cited

A sister agency in the Department of Health and Human 
Services and the U.S. Department of Agriculture deemed 
carotenoids of such importance that a special box lists 
"Some Good Sources of Carotenoids," Jacobson said.

"With that level of recognition that carotenoids appear to 
offer health benefits, it would be extra ironic if the FDA 
approves carotenoid-depleting olestra just weeks after 
release of the new federal nutrition policy," Jacobson told 
FDA.  The agency is expected to issue a regulation on 
olestra in the next month  

Meanwhile, CSPI submitted lengthy comments to the olestra 
petition Dec. 21 after the group convinced the agency to 
extend the comment deadline (See FOOD CHEMICAL NEWS, Dec. 
18, Page 13).  

CSPI had asked for the deadline extension based on two new 
studies:  a study on water content of stools, and a large 
home-use study of olestra snacks.  CFSAN was aware of the 
home-use study but chose to ignore it, said FDA Deputy 
Commissioner for Policy William Schultz in a Dec. 8 letter.  
But the agency agreed to permit CSPI to submit comments on 
the newly available stool water content data.  

CSPI filed its comments focusing on olestra's depletion of 
carotenoids and gastrointestinal disturbances after 
reviewing the transcript of the November Food Advisory 
Committee meeting.

Failure to Give Advisory Committee Full Review of Carotenoid 
Data Hit

CSPI argued that the views of Procter & Gamble and "its few 
hired experts on carotenoids" were not consistent with 
experts "who share our concerns about the likely adverse 
impact on health of depletion of carotenoids, and experts 
who have expressed their concern about the likely adverse 
impact on public health of allowing olestra onto the 
market."

The advocacy group reiterated charges that CFSAN staff had 
failed to provide the working group and Food Advisory 
Committee with data needed for an informed decision on 
carotenoid's role in health protection.

"We disagree strongly with the CFSAN staff's decision not to 
provide committee members and the Commissioner with a full 
review of data on carotenoids, since several members of the 
working group and Food Advisory Committee stated that they 
found the question of carotenoids to be the most difficult 
one they faced, and all data bearing on the health effects 
of carotenoids should have been provided to the panels."  
The group added, "We trust that the in vitro, animal, 
clinical, epidemiological, and intervention-trial data will 
be reviewed by the Commissioner when he is considering what 
action he will take regarding olestra." 

CSPI also suggested that CFSAN staff not carry out the 
review, "given that staff's inadequate treatment of those 
important research data."

The group found CFSAN's report on olestra "completely 
ignored a large and growing body" of research on the role of 
carotenoids in protecting health.  Included was a study 
appearing in the Dec. 6, 1995, issue of the Journal of the 
National Cancer Institute on the link to consuming lycopene-
rich tomato products and the reduced risk of prostate cancer 
(See FOOD CHEMICAL NEWS, Dec. 11, Page 10).

"While that study did not prove that lycopene protects 
against prostate cancer, the findings are very important in 
evaluating olestra, because lycopene is the most lipophilic 
carotenoid and the carotenoid most severely depleted by 
olestra and by the sucrose polyester used in the recent 
Dutch study," CSPI commented, adding:  "Since lycopene is 
abundant in tomatoes, it is of obvious concern that savory 
snacks containing olestra may well be eaten with tomato-
containing meals."

CSPI reiterated charges that carotenoid levels are likely to 
be reduced significantly by olestra, despite claims by 
Procter & Gamble, and that between-meal consumption of 
olestra would have some impact on carotenoids.

On the issue of gastrointestinal disturbances, CSPI charged 
members of a working group on olestra and the Food Advisory 
Committee with defining "out of existence the diarrhea 
caused by olestra."  The comments added, "There was very 
little discussion of the numerous other gastrointestinal 
disturbances associated with consumption of olestra, and, 
since diarrhea was likely the most serious of the symptoms, 
by concluding that olestra did not cause diarrhea, it then 
became fairly simple for the panels to reach a conclusion of 
'no harm.'"

The group concluded that FDA should deny the olestra 
petition because evidence suggests that "depletion of 
carotenoids presents a clear risk of harm to public health, 
and there is absolutely no way that a conclusion can be 
drawn that there would be a 'reasonable certainty of no 
harm' if carotenoid absorption was reduced by olestra."

CSPI also took aim at the legal burden of proof that the 
group said has been inappropriately switched to government 
authorities who must prove olestra is harmful.  "Those 
people heard the evidence demonstrating that olestra reduces 
serum levels of carotenoids and the evidence that 
carotenoids reduce risks of cancer, heart disease and 
macular degeneration, yet because there was not proof that 
carotenoids are beneficial, many of them said that olestra 
is safe." 

According to the group, the lucky consumers will be those 
who experience gastrointestinal problems once olestra foods 
become available and stop eating such foods, so "their 
carotenoid intake would no longer be threatened."




Procter & Gamble Questions APHA Olestra Review

On a related note, Procter & Gamble criticized the American 
Public Health Association's conclusions on the pending 
olestra petition (See FOOD CHEMICAL NEWS, Dec. 4, Page 19) in 
a Nov. 28 letter to APHA Executive Director Fernando Trevino.  
"Quite frankly, the November 14 letter from APHA was a 
surprise to us, and it is unfortunate that APHA has taken a 
position on olestra's use in snack foods without a full 
appreciation of the data," the petitioner said.

The company said APHA seemed to have little interest in 
olestra before P&G had an opportunity to provide a "cursory 
one-hour overview" of the olestra research program to an 
APHA health protection analyst.  "A one-hour overview is not 
a sufficient basis on which to judge the more than 150,000 
pages of research data that comprise the olestra food 
additive petition," the firm said.  

Comprehensive clinical testing answered key concerns about 
the long-term public health impact of olestra snack foods, 
said the firm, including confirmed safety in people who are 
more likely to eat lower fat foods than the average person 
and safety in people with gastrointestinal diseases.  Procter 
& Gamble responded to APHA's concerns in the 13-page letter.

Procter & Gamble's Christopher Hassall offered to meet with 
APHA to review the research in detail. ((6FCN 4603, 103

CONSUMER COMMENTS OPPOSING APPROVAL  FLOOD OLESTRA FILE

More than 700 comments have filled the olestra file at FDA's 
dockets management branch, the vast majority from consumers 
urging the agency not to approve the fat substitute.

While many of the comments were form letters inspired by the 
Center for Science in the Public Interest's campaign to keep 
olestra out of the food supply (See preceding story), others 
were generated by press reports of the four-day FDA Food 
Advisory  Committee meeting in November held by FDA to 
consider the data on olestra (See FOOD CHEMICAL NEWS,  Nov. 
20, Pages 17 and 31, and Nov. 27, Page 3).  The comment 
period on the petition ended Dec. 21.

A letter from Terry and Joanie Davis of Eagan, Minn., for 
example, cited a wire service story of the meeting, asking 
FDA, "Why allow the sale of a food product that will 
increase the likelihood of sickness for some and increase 
health care costs for all?"

They noted that a suggested warning label should be required 
to be printed "in no less than 10 point font for the sight 
impaired," but added, "Unfortunately, this won't help the 
unsuspecting guest eater at restaurants or picnics unless 
the server has a conscience and remembers to warn them."

Phytochemical Investigator Urges Denial of Petition

A researcher investigating the anti-cancer potential of 
phytochemicals warned FDA not to approve the pending food 
additive petition for olestra, predicting that use of the 
product may have a negative health impact.

Jed Fahey, faculty research associate with the Brassica 
Chemoprotection Laboratory at the Johns Hopkins School of 
Medicine, said he was "distressed" by the data indicating 
that olestra may reduce absorption of many fat-soluble 
vitamins.  "There are a great number of other, fat-soluble 
phytochemicals, some of which we are investigating in my 
laboratory for their anti-cancer potential," Fahey said, 
adding, "Many of them have yet to even be isolated in pure 
form and are therefore unavailable for testing."

"The inclusion of olestra in commonly consumed American 
foods has a high probability of effecting the wholesale 
reduction of a multiplicity of beneficial compounds from the 
diet of a great many Americans," the letter to FDA 
Commissioner Dr. David Kessler said, adding, "Based on 
overwhelming epidemiological evidence, there is a high 
probability that the use of this product would have a 
negative health impact."

Comments from the American Diabetes Association and the 
American Heart Association took no specific stand on whether 
FDA should approve olestra.  ADA said it supports the 
development and introduction into the marketplace of food 
products that help people lose or maintain weight, but added 
that it "looks to and respects the FDA review process for 
assurance of product safety."  AHA encouraged FDA to 
continue the review of all fat replacers.  The group noted 
that many products on the market labeled as "reduced fat" 
have significant amounts of mono- and diglycerides, which 
are a source of calories and are metabolized as fat.

Comments Commend Conduct of Advisory Committee Meeting

The comments of a variety of researchers supporting approval 
of the fat substitute -- some of which were sent in by 
Procter & Gamble, the petition's sponsor --  were also 
included in the FDA administrative file on olestra.  Many of 
these letters included positive comments about the conduct 
of the four-day Food Advisory Committee meeting.

The American Dietetic Association said one of its 
representatives attended the advisory committee and working 
group meetings on olestra, adding, "We believe that the 
process allowed for a full airing of ADA's views on this 
matter.  We fully support the FAC review process, including 
its interpretation of the data and consideration of public 
comment."

A co-discoverer of olestra, Dr. Fred Mattson, professor of 
medicine emeritus at the University of California in San 
Diego, noted that as early work on the compound progressed, 
"I came to the conclusion that olestra posed no hazard as a 
food ingredient."

"Subsequent studies have served to strengthen this opinion," 
Mattson said.  He noted that olestra "is now supported by a 
much wider range of studies, and now many of these are on 
human subjects.  Moreover, the level of use is inherently 
limited by the nature of the food products in which it will 
be used."

Nutritionist Johanna Dwyer of Tufts University said her 
interest in fat substitutes such as olestra led her to 
independently review some of the studies in the peer-
reviewed literature.  Later, she was asked by P&G to review 
and edit two papers for publication on consumption models 
and use of the pig and other data for assessing human 
effects of consuming olestra.  Noting a specific interest in 
gastrointestinal effects, Dwyer said she requested and 
received additional information on GI effects, and devoted 
particular attention to what might be expected at very high 
levels of intake.

At Dwyer's request, P&G sent her blinded samples of olestra-
containing potato chips and regular potato chips in amounts 
that would constitute the 95th percentile of intake.  Dwyer 
said she ate these potato chips in a single bolus amount for 
a meal on two separate days and subsequently recorded her 
own views of signs and symptoms of GI distress.  "I felt 
more GI distress when eating the regular potato chips, and 
did not record any differences in stool consistency in this 
brief experiment," Dwyer wrote.  She noted that very high 
chronic use might produce changes in the consistency of the 
stool, but it is "inappropriate to describe these changes as 
diarrhea."

Dwyer said she concluded that the product "is safe and may 
provide a benefit to some consumers who wish to eat low fat, 
low saturated fat salty snacks."  She added that the FDA 
evaluation process and the advisory committee deliberations 
"were reasonable, thorough and helpful."

Dr. Harry Greene, clinical professor of pediatrics at 
Vanderbilt University Medical Center, said he attended the 
advisory committee meeting in November and was "extremely 
impressed with the presentations by the FDA scientists and 
the presentations by the expert consultants brought in by 
FDA in providing an unbiased and scientific approach to the 
relevant studies which have been performed with olestra."

CSPI Took Data Out of Context, Researcher Charges

Greene criticized presentations by the Center for Science in 
the Public Interest, saying much of the data "was taken out 
of context" or "completely misinterpreted due to a lack of 
scientifically acceptable statistical evaluation, and in 
many instances was anecdotal."  In contrast, he said, "the 
data presented by Procter & Gamble scientists represented 
clear examples of well controlled, scientifically credible 
studies."

Greene said the chairman of the advisory committee made sure 
that CSPI had an equal opportunity to present its 
objections.

Also charging that CSPI took data out of context, Dr. 
Michael Davidson, medical director of the Chicago Center for 
Clinical Research at Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke's Medical 
Center, noted that the clinical studies by P&G "were 
purposely designed to assess the extreme intakes of olestra 
in subjects of various body sizes and dietary habits."  
Davidson pointed out that olestra "was used to replace 
almost 50% of the daily fat intake for those in the 32-gram 
dose group," which he said "included petite young women who 
were unaccustomed to large intake of non-digestible food."

"The vast majority of subjects with gastrointestinal events 
were women who would rarely consume 32 grams of olestra on 
a single day, yet were fed 32 grams daily for eight weeks," 
Davidson added.  He noted that approval of olestra "has 
significant health implications for the entire U.S. 
population," since high fat consumption is a leading cause 
of heart disease, diabetes, cancer and obesity.

Researcher Reports Positive Response to Olestra in 
Nutrition Education Study

Dr. John Foreyt of the Baylor College of Medicine in 
Houston said he conducted a study on the use of olestra in 
a nutrition education program.  Female adults were randomly 
assigned to either an olestra or non-olestra group, and 
various food products containing olestra, including 
shortening, potato chips, oven-ready french fries, and a 
mayonnaise-type salad, were made available as part of an 
overall nutrition education program, Foreyt said.  
"Response to the product was positive," he commented, 
noting that subjects in both groups reduced their dietary 
fat consumption to approximately 30% of total calories.

 "Responses to our questionnaire suggested that subjects 
with access to the olestra products experienced less 
deprivation while reducing dietary fat intake than the 
subjects without access to the olestra products," Foreyt 
said, adding that the study is currently in press.

 "Based on our study, and my reading of the olestra 
research, I believe that olestra can help consumers lower 
overall fat intake because it gives them a choice, without 
sacrificing taste," he said.

Dr. Gail Harrison of the University of California School of 
Public Health in Los Angeles complimented the special 
consultants utilized by FDA as in-depth review experts on 
olestra, calling them "absolutely the best in the field."  
Harrison added, "Their reports can be relied upon in terms 
of scientific validity and perspective."

Recommending approval of the compound, Harrison said she is 
"quite thoroughly acquainted with the data base supporting 
the safety of olestra as it is proposed for use in savory 
snacks in the U.S. food supply, and am convinced on the 
basis of reasonable scientific judgment it is safe by the 
standard that FDA must apply."

Other letters recommending approval came from Dr. Elijah 
Saunders of the University of Maryland's School of 
Medicine, Division of Hypertension, and Dr. George Bray, 
executive director of the Pennington Biomedical Research 
Center at the Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge.

A letter from Penny Kris-Etherton, professor of nutrition 
at Penn State University, reiterated conclusions she had 
presented for P&G at the advisory committee meeting -- that 
inclusion of olestra snacks would reduce dietary 
carotenoids over a period of seven days by approximately 
10%.  The calculations assumed that all savory snacks 
included in dietary records randomly selected from study 
subjects in target groups of interest were olestra-
containing snacks, she said.

 "Obviously, in a real world setting, not all savory snacks 
consumed will contain olestra.  Nonetheless, I believe that 
our estimates are reasonable as a means to gain a 
perspective about the average impact of olestra-containing 
snacks in different free-living population groups," Kris-
Etherton added.  ((6FCN 4608, 26 pages, $11)

PETITION NEEDED TO EXPAND ENERGY SOURCES IN POULTRY FEED 
IRRADIATION RULE: FDA

A food additive petition approved recently by the Food and 
Drug Administration sought approval only of the use of gamma 
radiation from cobalt 60 for Salmonella in poultry feed, so 
a separate or supplemental petition would have to be filed 
to expand the approval to include other sources of ionizing 
radiation, the agency said recently (See FOOD CHEMICAL NEWS, 
Oct. 2, Page 42, and Nov. 6, Page 17).

The Center for Veterinary Medicine's George Graber, director 
of the division of animal feeds, discussed the petition in a 
Dec. 6 letter to Paisan Loaharanu, who is part of the 
Secretariat of the International Consultative Group on Food 
Irradiation, International Atomic Energy Agency, in Vienna, 
Austria.  Loaharanu had written to CVM in October, 
questioning why the final rule permitting the irradiation 
was limited to gamma rays from cobalt 60 and did not include 
gamma rays from cesium-137 and electrons and X-rays from 
machine sources.

Loaharanu had asked if there were scientific reasons for 
this limitation, and questioned whether it would be possible 
to include other radiation sources in the regulation.

Petition, Rule Refer Only to Cobalt 60

Graber noted that when Nordion International Inc. filed the 
food additive petition, FDA sought comment only on the use 
of gamma radiation from cobalt 60, but said "no public 
comment was received," and pointed out that the scope of a 
proceeding for issuing a food additive regulation "is 
limited by the terms and conditions of use set out in the 
filed petition."

"To the extent that a person seeks to extend the petitioned-
for terms and conditions of use, the person must do so by 
separate or supplemental petition," Graber added.  He 
thanked Loaharanu for sending a copy of the ICGFI document 
entitled, "Code of Good Irradiation Practice for the Control 
of Pathogenic Microorganisms in Poultry Feed."

Similar letters were sent to E-Beam Services, Cranbury, 
N.J., AECL Technologies, Hauppage, N.Y., and Dr. Elsa Murano 
of the Texas A&M University's Department of Animal Science.  
In objections filed following publication of the rule, all 
had questioned why the regulation limited the source of 
ionizing radiation to gamma radiation from cobalt 60.

In the letters to the companies, Graber noted that nothing 
in the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act or in FDA's regulations 
suggests or authorizes that "interested persons use the 
opportunity to object as an opportunity to expand the 
authorized use beyond those sought in the petition."

"Indeed, the records of the rulemaking (the petition and 
comments, in this case, none) only contain information 
concerning the use of cobalt 60, and thus it appears that 
there would be no support in the record for your 
objections," he said.

If FDA were to proceed to complete its evaluation of the 
objections and request for a hearing, "it is likely that the 
agency would deny the request on the basis that the request 
is beyond the scope of the petitioned action and is more 
appropriately resolved through the submission of a food 
additive petition," Graber said, adding that "the proper and 
more timely resolution is the withdrawal of the objection at 
this time and submission of a food additive petition."  He 
urged the companies to withdraw their objections, and 
offered to meet with them about pursuing a food additive 
petition.  ((6FCN 4607, 9 pages, $7 )

AFDO FLOATS PROPOSED FOOD CODE CHANGES TO MEMBERS

Proposed changes to the Food and Drug Administration's 1993 
Food Code have been sent to members of the Association of 
Food and Drug Officials by AFDO's Food Committee, with 
instructions to respond by Jan. 16.

"The impetus for this action came as a result of a 
questionnaire sent by the AFDO Food Committee to state 
officials concerning the 1993 FDA Food Code and subsequent 
workshops during the [AFDO] Annual Conference," AFDO 
President Arthur Dell'Aria said in a Dec. 8 letter that 
accompanied the proposed changes.  In addition, "an Ad Hoc 
Committee was formed to address this task immediately after 
the annual conference.  The Ad Hoc Committee included state 
officials, USDA representation, FDA assistance and 
representatives from the affected industries" (See FOOD 
CHEMICAL NEWS, July 3, Page 25).

In November, FDA issued a 1995 Food Code, which made a 
number of minor changes and clarifications to the 1993 Code; 
an FDA-er referred to the 1995 revision as the "housekeeping 
edition," intended to clean up language, etc., prior to an 
anticipated major overhaul for the 1997 Code.  FDA wanted to 
wait and do the more extensive changes after input is 
received from AFDO and from the Conference for Food 
Protection, which meets in April of this year (See FOOD 
CHEMICAL NEWS, Nov. 6, Page 22).

Potentially Hazardous Foods Subsection Would Be Removed

The subsection in Chapter 1 dealing with potentially 
hazardous foods should be eliminated, AFDO members said, 
because such a variance is unnecessary.  The original 
language noted that  a food is not potentially hazardous if 
"laboratory evidence that is the basis of a variance granted 
by the regulatory authority demonstrates that rapid and 
progressive growth of infectious and toxigenic 
microorganisms or the slower growth of C. botulinum cannot 
occur." 

In Chapter 2, AFDO members suggested adding food manager 
certification "as a means test for demonstration of 
knowledge."  The additional wording would read:  "... the 
person in charge shall demonstrate his knowledge by 
compliance with this code, by being a certified food manager 
who has demonstrated knowledge of required information 
through an accredited test or by responding to the 
inspector's questions when applicable."

The special handwash procedure outlined in Chapter 2, which 
dealt with the procedure food handlers would use after using 
bathroom facilities, should be eliminated, AFDO members 
concurred.  Instead, the section should be renamed "handwash 
procedures" and should be enforced throughout food 
operations.

The variance for recreationally caught scombrotoxin-prone 
fish and all reference to recreationally caught fish in 
Chapter 3 should be eliminated, AFDO members said, with the 
section reading that only fish that are commercially and 
legally caught and harvested may be received for sale or 
service.  Also in that chapter, the variance requirement for 
using more than one tagged or labeled container or 
shellstock at a time should be eliminated.  The handler(s) 
would still be required not to commingle differently tagged 
or labeled groups before the fish is ordered by the 
consumer.

The variance for cooking raw animal foods (such as raw 
shellfish, steak tartare, soft-cooked eggs, etc.) to 
required temperatures should be eliminated, AFDO members 
said, to remove language that grants a variance from the 
section if based on a HACCP plan.  Instead, consumers 
ordering such foods must be informed by food establishments 
of the possible dangers of eating such foods through 
labeling of menus, table tents, etc., AFDO noted, adding 
that consumer advisory requirements would be met by the 
statement:

"Thoroughly cooking foods of animal origin such as beef, 
eggs, fish, lamb, milk, pork, poultry, or shellfish reduces 
the risk of foodborne illness.  Individuals with certain 
health conditions may be at higher risk if these foods are 
consumed raw or undercooked.  Consult your physician or 
public health official for further information."

Two other suggested changes were to eliminate the 
requirement for a variance before brewing alcoholic 
beverages or using food additives as a method of flavor 
enhancement (Chapter 3) and to eliminate the variance 
requirement for utilizing a molluscan shellfish life-support 
system display tank for storage and display of shellfish 
(Chapter 4).  However, the tank system would remain part of 
a hazard analysis critical control point system that assures 
that safety and quality of the fish is not harmed through 
the use of such a tank, among other requirements, AFDO 
members noted.

Ad Hoc Committee Specific Recommendations Cover Food 
Handling, Holding Temperatures

The AFDO Ad Hoc Committee had a number of specific 
recommendations of its own, including rewording of a 
Chapter 2 section on the responsibilities of the "person in 
charge," to include food handling requirements, training 
and the explanation of responsibilities.  Suggested new 
wording included:  "Employees are preventing cross-
contamination of ready-to-eat food with their bare hands by 
properly using suitable utensils such as deli tissue, 
spatulas, tongs or single-use gloves; employees are 
properly trained in food safety; and the responsibilities, 
rights and authorities assigned by this Code are explained 
to the:  1) food employee; 2) person in charge, and 3) 
regulatory authority."

In Chapter 3, the committee suggested the addition of a 
cooking chart that includes minimum cooking times and 
temperatures for a variety of cooked meats, eggs and 
related products  -- "145 F (63 C) for 15 seconds for shell 
eggs for individual order, immediate service, fish, 
seafood, beef, veal, lamb, mutton, etc., not specified 
below; 155 F (68 C) at 15 seconds, or 150 F (68 FC) for 1 
minute, or 145 F(63 C) for 3 minutes, for pork, game 
animals, ground chopped meat and fish, injected meats and 
eggs in multi-serving batches; and 165 F (74 C) for 15 
seconds for field-dressed wild game, poultry, stuffed 
fish, meat pasta or poultry, or stuffing containing fish, 
meat or poultry."

An exemption in the cooking time/temperature requirements 
should be made for whole muscle intact beef steaks prepared 
in response to a consumer's order, the committee noted, 
adding that reheating for hot holding requirements should 
be changed so that the two-hour rapid heating requirement 
would be applied to all reheating practices.

While leaving intact the code's requirements that 
potentially hazardous foods should be stored for hot 
holding at 140 F (60 C) or above or at 41 F (5 C) or below, 
the AFDO committee suggested language be added to allow for 
45 F 

refrigerated storage of potentially hazardous food 
"provided the mechanical refrigeration unit in which the 
food is held is incapable of meeting the [41 F or below] 
requirements; is currently in place and in use; and is 
replaced with a unit that can meet the [41 F or below] 
requirement when replacement is required."

The section in Chapter 3 dealing with ready-to-eat, 
potentially hazardous food disposition would also be 
significantly changed by the ad hoc committee, the report 
explained:

"An addition here would require an automatic cut-off 
control activated by temperatures above 45 F for vending 
machines that dispense ready-to-eat potentially hazardous 
food.  Disposition of temperature-abused foods from such 
systems would be consistent with the requirements for 
other potentially hazardous food (five days or 10 days).  
The reference to manufacturers' 'sell by' or 'use by' date 
is removed, as they are not present on many potentially 
hazardous foods and are not enforced by most states."

As for time as a public health control, the committee 
recommended a change in wording so that hot food would have 
to be served or discarded within two hours from the point 
in time when the food is removed from temperature control 
(the code's four-hour rule would remain in effect for cold 
foods). 

The committee said the exception for pyrethrin-based 
compounds should be removed from the Chapter 7 section on 
application of pesticides.  Also, pesticide treatment by 
uncertified persons under the direct supervision of a 
certified person would be allowed.  The change was 
suggested so that a broad interpretation of "applicable 
law" regarding application of pesticides would be allowed.

In addition, AFDO is recommending a number of rewording, 
editing and reformatting changes for simplification or 
clarification.  ((6FCN 4601, 145 pages, $41).

FSIS IDENTIFIES REFORMS NEEDED BEFORE HACCP IMPLEMENTATION

The Food Safety and Inspection Service Dec. 29 identified 
several areas of reform it says are necessary, both as part 
of the Reinventing Government initiative and because the 
regulations in question need to be changed before the 
planned implementation of a hazard analysis critical control 
point system for meat and poultry inspection (See FOOD 
CHEMICAL NEWS, Sept. 11, Page 46, and related stories, Pages 
25 and 41).

The advance notice of proposed rulemaking lists a number of 
proposed areas ripe for modification or elimination because 
they are inconsistent with HACCP principles.  Such 
regulatory changes will be made before HACCP is implemented 
in plants, the ANPR added.

Regulations mentioned in the ANPR fall into broad 
categories, such as:  definitions; inauguration, suspension 
and withdrawal of suspension; appeals procedures and related 
administrative procedures; reinspection of product entering 
establishments, and retention and disposition of product; 
restrictive, command-and-control type regulations that 
delimit processing and treatment methods intended to 
eliminate specific food safety hazards; and recordkeeping 
and access to records under the Freedom of Information Act.

The ANPR invited comment on any of these areas, and added 
that "FSIS specifically requests comment on its efforts to 
transform regulations from heavy reliance on command-and-
control approaches to greater reliance on performance 
standards, and solicits detailed suggestions concerning 
which existing regulations need to be changed to be 
consistent with HACCP, and how those regulations should be 
changed."

Several specific candidates for revision or removal were 
presented in the ANPR.  Under "definition":

Include general HACCP-related terms and redefine inspection 
organization and activity terms.

Under "application for and grant or refusal of inspection":

Revise prior approval procedures; shift to performance 
standards.

Under "inauguration and withdrawal of inspection; inspection 
program employees":

Clarify role of inspection program.  Integrate this with 
rules for suspending and withdrawing inspection.

Assure that appeals procedures comport with enforcement 
under HACCP.

Under "facilities for inspection":

Clarify standards for essential facilities.

Convert requirements for sanitation and facilities to 
performance standards or decision criteria; supplement with 
guidelines as needed.

Simplify detailed requirements for equipment and 
cleanliness, for example; convert to performance standards 
and/or decision criteria; supplement with guidelines as 
needed.

Convert equipment and cleaning requirements to performance 
standards and/or decision criteria; supplement with 
guidelines as needed.

Remove obsolete provisions for slack barrels, similar 
containers and means of conveyance, and burlap wrapping.

Clarify decision criteria concerning employment of diseased 
persons.

Convert tagging insanitary equipment, utensils, rooms and 
compartments provisions to performance standards; clarify 
role of inspection program employees.

Update rules for temperatures and chilling and freezing 
procedures for poultry and make changes to accommodate HACCP 
(i.e., changes in addition to pathogen reduction amendments 
proposed 2/3/95).

Under "entry into official establishments, reinspection; 
reinspections, preparing and processing establishments":

Convert rules for articles entering establishments and 
product disposal to performance standards and clarify role 
of inspection program employees.

Eliminate prior approval procedures for total quality 
control systems.

Convert requirements for processing procedures and articles 
used in preparing products to performance standards, and 
clarify role of inspection program employees.

Eliminate command-and-control type requirements for the use 
of nitrite and sodium ascorbate or erythorbate in bacon; 
convert these requirements to performance standards and 
clarify role of inspection program employees.

Convert requirements for the treatment of pork and pork 
products to destroy trichinae into performance standards; 
supplement with guidelines as needed.

Convert requirements for preparing articles not for use as 
human food (e.g., dog food) to performance standards; 
clarify role of inspection program employees; eliminate 
command-and-control type requirements.

Eliminate redundancy with other provisions (i.e., mixtures 
containing products that are not classed as meat food 
products).

Convert procedure for handling product adulterated by 
polluted water to performance standards and decision 
criteria; supplement with guidelines as needed.

Convert requirements for tagging chemicals, preservatives, 
cereals, spices, etc., to performance standards; clarify 
role of inspection program employees.

Convert rules for substances such as pesticide chemical 
residues, food additives and color additives to performance 
standards and role of inspection program employees.

Make requirements for handling of certain material for 
mechanical deboning consistent with any new time-temperature 
requirements.

Convert compliance procedures for meat derived from advanced 
meat/bone separation machinery and recovery systems to 
performance standards, and clarify role of inspection 
program employees.

Convert requirements for canning and canned products to 
performance standards and clarify role of inspection program 
employees.

Under "transportation":

Eliminate obsolete provisions; focus on and clarify policies 
and performance standards.

Comments are due Feb. 27.  For more information, contact Paula 
Cohen at 202-720-7164.

IBP COMPLAINS OF RED MEAT, POULTRY EQUITY ISSUES AT HACCP 
MEETINGS

IBP, Inc. complained in a recent letter to the Food Safety 
and Inspection Service that recent meetings on the 
HACCP/Pathogen Reduction proposal should have focused on red 
meat versus poultry regulatory equity issues.

In the letter to USDA Acting Undersecretary for Food Safety 
Michael Taylor, the Nebraska firm's James Lochner said he 
attended all six of the HACCP public meetings and the Food 
Safety Forum (See Food Chemical News, Nov. 13, Page 32), but 
that there was "insufficient focus on red meat versus 
poultry regulatory equity issues." 

"There is ample published research demonstrating increased 
food safety risks with poultry as a result of current 
processes allowed by FSIS poultry regulations," Lochner 
said, questioning "why these issues have not been addressed 
in more detail."  

In the second round of comments to the proposal, IBP 
stressed the importance of microbiological testing in HACCP 
validation and ongoing HACCP verification.  The firm also 
stressed that insufficient data exist to use indicator 
organisms for a performance standard.  

"IBP believes USDA has only one choice: microbiological 
guidelines as a HACCP verification component.  This is the 
only viable solution until data is generated on an ongoing 
basis and then related to an increased risk of human 
health."   

Validation should be defined as documenting a critical 
control point that eliminates microbiological hazards, IBP 
said, and, "When possible, validation should demonstrate the 
elimination of pertinent pathogens, i.e., Salmonella and 
Escherichia coli O157:H7."  Validation, Lochner added, 
should be conducted either off-line in a research facility 
or with extensive on-line testing using indicator organisms, 
or with past reported research.

Verification Testing Based on Volume for Large Plants, Time 
for Small Plants Suggested

Verification should be defined as an ongoing demonstration 
of control with microbiological testing to verify that the 
process is in control, according to Lochner IBP's senior 
vice president, technical services.  

USDA should prescribe minimum frequencies for an acceptable 
HACCP program based on volume for large plants and time 
frame for small plants, IBP's Lochner told Taylor, 
recommending one microbiological verification test per 
species per 1,000 head increment per week for large meat and 
poultry plants and a minimum sample frequency of once a week 
for small plants.  For fresh meat and poultry plants that 
are not slaughter plants, microbiological testing as a HACCP 
verification should focus on relative change and operational 
sanitation, Lochner said.

All plants should be required to submit their ongoing HACCP 
microbiological verification results to USDA, which will 
then generate averages and baselines over a two-year period.  
USDA will need to develop details on where samples are 
taken, how they are handled, and laboratory methods for the 
information to be useful, IBP said. 

In other comments, the firm recommended that USDA develop 
criteria for a process step to be classified as an 
antimicrobial treatment, adding that a one log reduction was 
not an effective criterion.  Also, USDA should allow carcass 
cooling rates to be incorporated into HACCP programs with 
micro validation and verification to demonstrate that the 
chill rates control growth of indicator organisms or 
pathogens.  USDA must reconsider the use of immersion 
chilling in poultry "if it seriously wants to improve the 
protection of public health," IBP added.

Finally, IBP urged USDA to move quickly in implementing the 
sweeping regulations and suggested that if certain 
industries or companies are unwilling to improve the 
process, then USDA may require mandatory controls.  "These 
cannot be political decisions," Lochner added.  ((6FCN 4606,

L. MONOCYTOGENES, B. CEREUS CONTAMINATION PROMPT WARNINGS TO 
WHITEFISH, PEDIATRIC MEDICAL FOOD MANUFACTURERS

Detection of Listeria monocytogenes in processed whitefish 
roe prompted a warning letter from the Food and Drug 
Administration to a Wisconsin fish roe manufacturing 
operation.  The Dec. 11 letter from FDA's Minneapolis 
District to James Vander Mause, president, Atlas 
International, Inc., Jefferson, Wis., said the pathogen was 
detected in a sample collected during an inspection of the 
facility.

FDA said that according to documents obtained during the 
inspection, Atlas does not sample and analyze incoming 
whitefish roe for microbiological pathogens, nor does the 
firm obtain "written assurance from suppliers that the roe 
is in compliance with federal laws and regulations."  The 
agency urged Vander Mause to incorporate a mechanism to 
"assure" that incoming fish roe will not be contaminated.  

Failure to assure compliance with laws and regulations may 
result in regulatory action without further notice, FDA 
warned Vander Mause.  The agency said he should notify the 
agency of "specific steps" taken to correct these 
deficiencies. 

Contamination with diarrheal enterotoxin producing Bacillus 
cereus has caused a pediatric medical food to be deemed 
adulterated, according to a warning letter from FDA's 
Minneapolis District.  

The Dec. 1 letter to David Pyott, president/CEO, Sandoz 
Nutrition, Inc., St. Louis Park, Minn., said samples of the 
firm's Vivonex Pediatric Medical Food were found to be 
contaminated.  While acknowledging that the contamination 
was "spotty," the agency said several portions contained 
>100 B. cereus and of the isolates tested for enterotoxin 
production, all were found to produce enterotoxin.  

FDA noted that the Sandoz contention that there was no 
significance to the B. cereus findings was based on several 
assumptions:  the strain will not grow at a pH of 4.85; 
there is a four-hour growth lag period after hydration, and 
room temperature storage "significantly decreases" rate of 
growth.  The agency added, however, that while this may 
"normally be the case," it should not be assumed for this 
strain, "particularly in a food intended for individuals of 
compromised health."  

Pyott was warned that failure to assure compliance with laws 
and regulations may result in regulatory action without 
further notice.  The agency said he should notify the agency 
of "specific steps" taken to achieve correction of these 
deficiencies.

Insanitary Processing, Storage Conditions Lead to Warnings 
for Mushroom Processing Plant

Michael Giorgio, owner, Prima Foods, Inc., Rehrersburg, Pa., 
received a warning from FDA's Philadelphia District 
concerning violations of acidified food manufacturing 
regulations.

The Dec. 7 letter said an inspection of Giorgio's mushroom 
processing plant revealed the following deficiencies:

water in washing tank was not changed during a full day's 
processing and became "increasingly dirty," resulting in 
mushrooms still bearing soil entering the blancher;

blancher observed with discolored mushrooms and "grease-
like" material adhering to it;

equipment used to hold mushrooms before and after blanching 
was not "adequately cleaned";

walk-in cooler has a drain pipe leading directly outside and 
the pipe was not screened to prevent pest entry;

mushrooms packed in brine remained on packing floor for 
several hours before being refrigerated, with mushrooms 
labeled for refrigeration at 35 F stored in a cooler at 47 F;

brine solution for coldpack mushrooms was stored in open vat 
and hand-dipped to fill mushroom container, with ascorbic acid 
used in brine preparation stored in uncovered container;

pH meter was used without being standardized;

blancher auger had flaked rust between blades and the rubber 
conveyor leading into blancher was frayed at edges, and 

a "large amount" of steam built up in the building.

In addition, FDA noted that several mushroom samples were 
found to contain "very high levels" of bacteria, leading the 
agency to be concerned that this may be "indicative of poor 
processing or handling practices."

FDA said that Giorgio acknowledged that Prima Foods should 
have "ceased production" of the mushrooms and that should 
the firm wish to make these foods in the future, 
registration as an acidified food manufacturer is required.

'Serious Violations' Alleged at California Fish Processing 
Operation

FDA's San Francisco District sent a warning letter to Robert 
Johnson, president, MFM, Inc., Berkeley, Calif., saying that 
an inspection of his 

shell fish and fin fish processing operations in San 
Francisco revealed "serious violations" of food 
manufacturing regulations.  

According to the Dec. 1 letter:

water lines serving processing operations lacked backflow 
prevention devices;

raw shrimp were held in a metal, perforated container, 
placed directly on a wet floor and washed with a water spray 
from a hand-held hose;

inspectors observed soap suds draining from drain board 
containing thawing shrimp, large drinking cup floating in 
sink, fork "nearly submerged" among shrimp and "personnel 
items" on drain board;

chemical cleaners were stored on shelf directly above fish 
in open cardboard box;

employees were seen handling hoses and other non-food items 
then resuming processing of seafood without washing or 
sanitizing hands, and

an unprotected ice machine, with standing water in three-
sided trough at its base, was located in an area allowing 
car and forklift traffic.

FDA also said that L. monocytogenes, Type 1, was detected in 
a swab sample taken from the surface of a packaging table.  
The swab was among several other environmental swabs found 
to be negative for Listeria and Salmonella microorganisms.  

Johnson was told to take "appropriate steps" to correct 
these violations to prevent adulteration of foods 
processed by the facility.  Adulterated foods are subject 
to seizure, the agency added.  

Insect, Rodent Findings at Bakery Draw Warning Letter

An FDA warning letter to Ralph Pacifico, president, Angelo 
Pacifico & Sons, Inc., Altoona, Pa., said insanitary 
conditions at the bakery resulted in bakery products being 
adulterated.  

The Nov. 22 letter from the agency's Philadelphia District 
said beetle-like insects and one larval stage insect were 
found throughout the flour storage and conveyor system, one 
dead mouse was found on the production floor near mixes, and 
exposed bread products and "potential rodent entry points" 
were observed.

FDA said its laboratory analysis of flour revealed insects 
in various stages of the beetle life cycle, indicating 
nesting.  Analysis of various finished bread products 
revealed rodent hair, insect fragments and cat or dog hair, 
the agency added.  

During the inspection of the bakery, it was noted that the 
conveyor and access panels were welded or glued shut, making 
inspection and cleaning "more difficult," FDA noted.  The 
firm's response that it would initiate a program aimed at 
cleaning the whole flour system "until no further insect 
nesting activity is noticed" is not sufficient, the agency 
added, saying that the company needs an "effective, ongoing 
sanitation program" to eliminate the insanitary conditions.  

Pacifico was told to take prompt action to correct these 
deficiencies.  Failure to do so, the agency added, may 
result in regulatory action, such as seizure and/or 
injunction, without further notice.    

'Insanitary Conditions' Cause Stored Foods To Be Deemed 
Adulterated

Foods at an Alabama warehouse have been deemed adulterated 
due to "insanitary conditions," according to a warning 
letter from FDA's Nashville District.

The Dec. 12 letter to J. Barton Greer, Jr., chairman of the 
board, Autry Greer & Sons, Prichard, said an inspection of 
the facility revealed a "widespread insect infestation" in 
the dry storage portion of the warehouse; spilled products 
at numerous locations within the warehouse; food products 
stored directly against the wall; insecticides and other 
hazardous chemicals stored directly adjacent to food items; 
poor handling of distressed food products, and damaged 
floors and walls in produce and meat coolers.  In addition, 
FDA said that 10 separate lots of food products, including 
flour, cornmeal, rice, beans and instant pudding, were found 
to be insect infested.

Greer was told to take prompt action to correct these 
deficiencies or face possible regulatory action such as 
seizure and/or injunction.  

Undeclared Colors Prompt Warning Letters

FDA's Chicago District sent a warning letter to Rashid 
Sweiss, president, Eden International, Inc., Blue Island, 
Ill., concerning misbranding of two of the firm's products. 

The Aug. 30 letter said that "Eden's Red Chickpeas" 
contained undeclared FD&C Red #3 and "Eden's Gourmet Mix" 
contained undeclared FD&C Red #40.  FDA also advised Sweiss 
that net contents need to be declared in metric as well as 
in inch-pound units.  Sweiss was told to inform the agency 
of steps taken to correct the violations.  

Airlines Warned About Insanitary Processing Facilities, 
Public Conveyance Violations 

Food processing and watering point violations involving the 
airline industry were subjects of warning letters from FDA's 
San Francisco District.

Herbert Kelleher, president and CEO, Southwest Airlines, 
received a Nov. 21 letter pointing out several processing 
deficiencies as well as watering point violations.

The insanitary conditions resulted in a classification of 
the facilities as "Not Approved."  

A "Non-Approved" or "Use Prohibited" classification was 
awarded to a facility serving the airline industry, 
according to another warning letter from FDA's San Francisco 
District.

The Dec. 1 letter to David Tam, president, Tam Fresh Cut-
Pack, Inc., Sacramento, Calif., said an inspection of the 
facility revealed the following:  lack of chemical test kits 
for chlorine sanitizer; standing water on floor near 
vegetable sink and floor of walk-in refrigerator; vegetables 
in boxes stored directly on refrigerator floors; 

knives on soiled surfaces were not sanitized; lack of 
functional thermometers in walk-in refrigerators; 
accumulation of old, slimy vegetable debris on onion slicer; 
accumulation of old food debris on exterior of scales; waste 
water flows across driveway to sewer, with employees seen 
walking through this water while cleaning food containers; 
unshielded fluorescent lights over processing areas, and 
unsealed hole in double wall in production area providing 
possible hole in the wall for vermin. 

Both Kelleher and Tam were told to notify the agency of 
steps taken to correct the violations.  

Manufacturing, Labeling Violations of Vet Products Disclosed 
in FDA Warnings

Failure to follow good manufacturing practice regulations 
for finished pharmaceuticals resulted in FDA issuing a 
warning to a Missouri veterinary drug manufacturer.

The Dec. 5 letter from FDA's Kansas City District to Henry 
Bobe, president/chief executive officer, Fermenta Animal 
Health Company, said an inspection of the firm's Elwood, 
Kan., facility revealed the following "significant 
deviations":

failure to establish and follow an adequate process 
validation plan for all tablet, bolus and powder products to 
assure they have the identity, strength, quality and purity 
they purport or are represented to possess;

failure to include directions in certain product Master 
Formula Records to recirculate product from the dead space 
at the base of the ribbon blender, and 

failure to have in place an adequate method validation for 
finished product analysis.  

Noting that the inspection consisted in part of pre-
approval review of manufacturing compliance, FDA said the 
deviations must be corrected before the district can concur 
with approval of the ANADAs and it has therefore 
recommended to the Center for Veterinary Medicine that 
approval of these ANADAs be withheld.  FDA said the 
inspection also revealed that a manufacturing change had 
been instituted for another product "without CVM approval."   

Bobe was told to notify FDA of the specific steps taken to 
correct the noted violations.  

FDA's Los Angeles District sent a warning letter to Louis 
Gottlieb, president, Very Healthy Enterprises, Inglewood, 
Calif., noting that several of the firms products are new 
animal drugs which are not the subject of approved NADAs.

The April 3 letter said that a new animal drug may not be 
legally marketed unless it is the subject of an approved 
NADA.  FDA said the following products are not generally 
recognized as safe and effective for the indications for use 
in their labeling:

Ear Relief Natural Medicine & Ear Cleanser for Dogs and 
Cats; Scratch Free Natural Medicine for Dogs and Cats; Eye-C 
Eye Medicine for Dogs and Cats with Vitamin C and Zinc (Zinc 
Plus C Ophthalmic Solution); Flea Relief Natural Medicine 
and Diar-relief Natural Medicine.

Gottlieb was told to take prompt action to correct these 
violations or face possible regulatory action, such as 
seizure and/or injunction, without further notice.

FDA's Buffalo District has warned a veterinary products 
company that it is manufacturing/repacking and distributing 
adulterated and misbranded new animal drugs.

In a May 17 letter to Richard Sanzen, president, Equest Inc., 
Saratoga Veterinary Products Co., Saratoga Springs, N.Y., FDA 
said no NADAs are in effect for the firm's Equi-Spaz Paste, 
Re-Coup and Doloflex products.  The firm's failure to provide 
FDA with a  list all drugs manufactured/repacked results in 
the products being deemed misbranded, FDA said.  The agency 
said Sanzen should take action to ensure that the firm meets 
all federal law and regulation requirements.

Violations of Medicated Feed Mill Regulations Described in 
FDA Warnings

Phil Yoder, president, Yoder Feeds, Kalona, Iowa, received a 
warning letter from FDA's Kansas City District concerning 
violations of federal current good manufacturing regulations 
for medicated feeds.  

The Oct. 18 letter said an inspection of the facility 
revealed a failure to perform assays at periodic intervals 
for all medicated feeds requiring approved applications, and 
the use of Type A articles in the manufacture of medicated 
feeds beyond their labeled expiration dates.  

Failure to correct these deficiencies may result in 
regulatory action, such as seizure and/or injunction, 
without further notice, FDA said.  

The Kansas City District also sent a warning letter to 
Leland Smith, president, Custom Feed Services Corp., 
Norfolk, Nebr. concerning medicated feed manufacturing 
violations.

In the June 30 letter, FDA said an inspection of Smith's 
facility revealed a failure to conduct the required number 
of assays of medicated feeds in a calendar year.

Smith was informed by FDA that failure to correct these 
deficiencies may result in regulatory action, such as 
seizure and/or injunction, without further notice.

FDA's Cincinnati District sent a similar letter to Leslie 
Gossett, terminal manager, PM AG Products, Inc., Owensboro, 
Ky.  In its Dec. 7 letter, the agency said deviations from 
medicated feed regulations included the failure to:  provide 
a drug scale suitable for the units or weights for which it 
is used; assure daily inventory records are accurate and 
adequate, and check batch records to determine that all 
required steps have been performed, as errors were found in 
drug receipt and production records.

Gossett was urged by FDA to establish procedures whereby 
such violations do not recur.  Until the violations have 
been corrected and the corrections verified by FDA, CVM will 
not approved medicated feed applications from the facility, 
the agency added.

FDA Notes Illegal Drug Residues in Animals Intended for 
Human Food

FDA's Seattle District warned two animal producers 
concerning the detection of illegal drug residues in animals 
intended for use as human food.

In an April 13 letter to Cornelius Timmermans, Lynden, 
Wash., FDA said a USDA analysis of a calf revealed the 
presence of neomycin at 7.27 ppm and tetracycline at 0.96 
ppm in the kidney.  Neomycin residues in the kidney of 
another calf were found at 41.54 ppm, the agency noted.

Al and Anna Biemold, Cascade Farms, Everson, Wash., also 
received a warning letter from the Seattle District.  The 
April 3 letter said a USDA analysis of a bob veal calf 
detected residues of neomycin at 3.31 ppm and 8.80 ppm 
tetracycline in kidney tissue.

Timmermans and the Biemolds were told to correct the 
violations and to establish procedures to prevent their 
recurrence.  Failure to do so, FDA added, may result in 
regulatory action without further notice.

Two warning letters concerning detection of illegal drug 
residues were also sent by FDA's Cincinnati District.

A Dec. 11 letter to Ray Geiser, Apple Creek, Ohio, said a 
USDA analysis of a bob veal calf revealed the presence of 
0.48 ppm penicillin in the kidney and 0.43 ppm in the liver.  

In a Dec. 4 letter, Roger Morlock, Valley City, Ohio, was 
told that a USDA analysis of a bob veal calf detected 
tetracycline in the liver at 1.3 ppm and in the kidney at 
4.3 ppm.  

FDA said Geiser and Morlock hold animals under conditions 
"so inadequate" that diseased animals and/or medicated 
animals bearing potentially harmful drug residues are likely 
to enter the food chain.  Both were urged to correct these 
violations and to establish procedures to prevent their 
recurrence.

Louis Agueda, Merced, Calif., received a warning from FDA's 
San Francisco District.  The Nov. 15 letter said a USDA 
analysis of a cull dairy cow revealed the presence of 
oxytetracycline in the liver at 5.3 ppm and in the kidney at 
0.26 ppm.  

Noting that Agueda has "a history" of offering adulterated 
animals for sale for human food, FDA said other animals 
contained illegal antibiotic residues and one tested CAST 
positive.  

FDA said Agueda lacks adequate systems for determining the 
medicated status of animals, for assuring that medicated 
animals are withheld from slaughter for appropriate periods 
of time and for assuring that drugs are used according to 
label directions.  The agency added that Agueda should 
correct these deficiencies or face regulatory action, such as 
seizure and/or injunction, without further notice.  ((6FCN

SINGLE PETITION PROCESS FOR ADDITIVES TO BE USED ON MEAT OR 
POULTRY PROPOSED BY FSIS, FDA

The Food and Drug Administration and Agriculture Department's 
Food Safety and Inspection Service Dec. 29 proposed a 
simplification of the review process for food additive, color 
additive and generally recognized as safe affirmation 
petitions for substances that are to be used on meat or 
poultry products.  Currently, such products must go through 
separate FDA and FSIS reviews, the proposal suggests a single 
joint review instead. There were two notices published on the 
issue, one from FDA, one from FSIS, both in the Dec. 29 
Federal Register.

Under the proposal, a single petition would be submitted to 
FDA, which would pass on pertinent petitions or parts of 
petitions to FSIS.  Future FSIS listings for meat and 
poultry additives would be harmonized with those of FDA and 
incorporated into FDA's regulations, "providing a basis for 
the eventual elimination of FSIS' separate listing in Title 
9 CFR," said the FDA notice.  An FSIS notice said that the 
Title 9 review will occur in three to five years, leading to 
the elimination of duplicative listings found in FDA's Title 
21.  FSIS will continue to retain a small list of specific 
substance use prohibitions and will add new prohibitions as 
necessary, the FSIS notice said.

FAPs, CAPs and GRAS affirmation petitions not involving use 
in meat, meat products or poultry would not be affected by 
this proposal, and would continue to be reviewed by FDA 
only.

The two agencies developed a memorandum of understanding on 
how they will work together 

in reviewing such petitions.  Basically, according to the 
MOU published in the FSIS notice, FDA will share pertinent 
petitions with FSIS, and FSIS will provide advice to FDA on 
any criteria, restrictions, conditions of use or other 
prohibitions that may be necessitated by the Federal Meat 
Inspection Act or the Poultry Products Inspection Act.

Some notable specifics of that MOU include:

"In situations where FSIS' Title 9 and FDA's Title 21 do not 
specifically address the intended use of a particular 
substance for meat or poultry products, any interested party 
may request that FSIS evaluate the status of such use.  FSIS 
will conduct a review and determine whether the use is 
acceptable in meat and poultry products, including whether 
the use is approved under the FFDCA (Federal Food, Drug and 
Cosmetic Act).  Under the terms of the MOU, FSIS would seek 
FDA's concurrence with FSIS' review and conclusions.  If FDA 
does not concur that the use is approved under the FFDCA, 
the petitioner would be required to submit a food additive 
or color additive petition to FDA requesting that FDA's 
regulations be amended to accommodate the requested use.

"In situations in which FDA receives a petition for the use 
of a substance or a use of a substance that is not approved 
under the FFDCA, a petitioner shall prepare and submit a 
food additive petition or a color additive petition only to 
FDA.  FDA will consult with FSIS regarding petitions for 
meat and poultry use, and, under the terms of the MOU, FSIS 
concurrence would be required for the approval of the use of 
substances intended for use in meat and poultry and that are 
codified in Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations.

"FSIS will provide any advice to FDA, in writing, on any 
criteria, restrictions, conditions of use, or prohibitions 
FSIS believes necessary concerning use of the products 
subject to the FMIA and the PPIA.

"Requests for a determination (by FSIS) of the acceptability 
of substances may result in the need for rulemaking when (1) 
FSIS standards of identity and composition preclude the use 
of a substance; or (2) there is concern about the 
suitability of a substance for the intended use because the 
substance has never been used in meat and poultry before, or 
the applications of the substance are new, e.g., a new meat, 
meat food, or poultry product category.

"Requests for determination of acceptability of new 
substances and new uses of substances in meat and poultry 
products are currently submitted by the requester ... to 
FSIS.  FSIS will continue to require that a request for an 
acceptability determination for the use of a new substance 
in meat and poultry or for the new use of an approved 
substance be supported by information and technical data 
that establish that (1) the use of the substance will not 
render the product in which it is used adulterated or 
misbranded and (2) the proposed use of the substance is at 
the lowest level necessary to accomplish the intended 
technical effect(s) in each category of the product in which 
the substance is used.

"The evaluation by FSIS of the acceptable use of a new 
substance or new use of a substance in meat and poultry 
products subject to this MOU will be based on the following 
conditions that must be addressed by the requester.  The 
conditions set forth are in accordance with the provisions 
for use of substances in 9 CFR and 21 CFR:  (1) The 
substance has a documented history of use in foods; (2) The 
substance is derived from food or a food ingredient and is 
not considered to be a chemical or synthesized additive; (3) 
The process for manufacturing the substance does not result 
in a severe alteration of the molecular structure resulting 
in the formation of a chemical residue whose safety has not 
been shown; (4) The safety of the substance has been 
evaluated by an independent authority and adequate safety 
data have been presented; (5) The suitability and efficacy 
of the substance have been shown through adequate data 
submission.  The lowest level of the substance necessary to 
achieve the intended functional effect must be shown, and 
the use cannot render the products to which the substance is 
intended for use adulterated or misbranded; (6) The FDA has 
determined the common or usual name of the substance, and 
(7) FDA must concur with FSIS' determination of 
acceptability in order to allow use."

Proposal Part of FSIS Reinventing Government Process

Several regulatory reforms were published by FSIS Dec. 29 
(See related stories, Pages 18 and 41).  "By adopting modern 
regulatory tools and streamlining or eliminating old rules 
and requirements, we will enhance the safety of meat and 
poultry products on the tables of America," said USDA Acting 
Under Secretary for Food Safety Michael Taylor in a Jan. 2 
statement.  The proposals were all part of the agency's 
Reinventing Government initiative (See FOOD CHEMICAL NEWS, 
Sept. 11, 1995, Page 46).

According to the Dec. 29 FDA Federal Register notice, the 
reason for the change was that:

"Over the years, the two agencies have cooperated on food 
ingredient issues on an as-needed, substance-specific, and 
case-by-case basis.  Nonetheless, because of their different 
regulatory needs, the two agencies' regulations governing 
the use of these substances in foods are cast in formats and 
terms that are not fully consistent with one another.  This 
absence of consistency causes difficulty and inconvenience 
to persons who need to refer to both agencies' regulations 
on approved substances and uses."

In addition, it is not clear where one agency's jurisdiction 
ends and another's begins, the notice said, and this has led 
to both agencies conducting separate, sequential review and 
rulemakings before a new meat or poultry use can be 
permitted.  "Many years can elapse between the time a 
manufacturer petitions FDA for the approval of a food 
additive or a color additive under the act and the 
appearance of FSIS regulations of approval for meat and 
poultry uses," the FDA notice said.

The notice went on to say that under the proposal, such 
substances would be authorized for use in meat and poultry 
products under the jurisdiction of FSIS on the basis of 
FDA's regulations.  Future FDA food additive, color additive 
and GRAS substance affirmation listings would specify any 
approved meat or poultry product uses, and the conditions of 
such uses, in accordance with FSIS recommendations "to the 
extent those recommendations are consistent with" the 
Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act.

In the future, FDA will include in its listings the amounts 
and uses of substances permitted for meat and poultry 
products, the FSIS notice proposed.

Also, the administrator of FSIS would retain legal authority 
to prohibit or restrict the use of specific substance(s) in 
meat or poultry products by notice-and-comment rulemaking, 
"but is not expected to have to exercise that authority on a 
regular basis because FDA's statutory authority, exercised 
in accord with the MOU, would provide a basis for 
appropriate limitations on uses in meat and poultry 
products," it continued.

Another proposed change in the regulations states that 
sorbic acid, calcium carbonate, and other salts of sorbic 
acid "shall not" (as opposed to the current "may not") "be 
used in cooked sausage or any other product; sulfurous acid 
and salts of sulfurous acid shall not be used in or on any 
product, and niacin or nicotinamide shall not be used in or 
on fresh product, except that potassium sorbate, 
propylparaben (propyl p- hydrobenzoate), calcium propionate, 
sodium propionate, benzoic acid, and sodium benzoate may be 
used in or on any product provided in 21 CFR or by a 
regulation in this subchapter" --         9 CFR 318.1(d)(2).

GRAS Products Subject of Special Provision

"Substances whose use is GRAS, however, are exempt from the 
premarket approval requirements of the act and need not be 
listed in FDA's regulations in 21 CFR.  For a substance that 
is not affirmed by FDA as GRAS or otherwise listed (in 21 
CFR parts 182 or 184) of FDA's regulations, or for a GRAS 
substance listed by FDA for general food use, where meat and 
poultry uses are neither specified not prohibited, FSIS 
would continue to consider a manufacturer's basis for 
claiming GRAS status and suitability for use in meat or 
poultry products,"

the notice said, adding that FSIS would make the 
determination in consultation with FDA as needed to ensure 
the appropriate advice is given and that FDA has notice of 
the determination.

Substances currently listed as GRAS for food use generally 
(in accordance with good manufacturing practices) would be 
considered GRAS by USDA for use in meat, meat food products 
and poultry products, unless otherwise restricted by FSIS 
regulations such as standards of identity or composition, 
"or in specific cases where the inspection program 
determines that use may adulterate the product," FSIS added.

Manufacturers also have the option of seeking advice from 
FSIS regarding the suitability of products currently listed 
in FDA regulations for general use in foods or for use in 
meat or poultry products.  "FSIS' responses and related 
correspondence could be available to the public, except that 
the formulation and process data for proprietary mixtures 
would be kept confidential," the FSIS proposal said, adding:  
"Parties requesting such evaluations would be advised to 
petition FDA when the requested use is not permitted under 
FDA's regulations."

The notice said that such inquiries should be addressed to 
Department of Agriculture, Food Safety and Inspection 
Service, Product Assessment Division, USDA, FSIS, RP, West 
End Court Building, Washington, DC 20250-3700.

FSIS Will Maintain Listing of Authorized Substances for 
Interested Parties

"FSIS' title 9 listing of authorized substances is 
incomplete, inconsistent with, and duplicative of FDA's 
listings," said the FSIS notice.  "The agency plans to 
eliminate its current listing over time by rulemaking as 
listings are determined to be duplicative of FDA 
regulations.  However, FSIS will retain its own regulations 
on specific substance use prohibitions and will add new 
prohibitions as necessary."

Also, for the convenience of its inspectors, inspected 
establishments and other interested persons, FSIS will 
maintain a comprehensive listing, in its directive system, 
of substances authorized for meat and poultry uses under 
USDA's 9 CFR and FDA's 21 CFR.  This listing will include:

Substances currently listed in 9 CFR;

Substances currently listed for meat or poultry uses in FDA 
food additive, GRAS or prior-sanctioned listings;

Approved color additives currently listed under FDA 
regulations (21 CFR section 73,74, and 82), approved food 
additives listed in 21 CFR 172-173 and 180, prior sanctioned 
substances listed under part 181, GRAS substances listed in 
21 CFR 182 and 184, if permitted for general use on foods 
(which includes meat and poultry) in accordance with good 
manufacturing practices, unless meat or poultry uses of the 
substances are otherwise precluded;

GRAS substances found by FSIS to be suitable for specified 
meat and poultry uses on the basis of information and data 
submitted by petitioners to FSIS.  Factors affecting FSIS 
findings of suitability include:  Existing FDA GRAS 
listings, which need not explicitly permit but may not 
preclude the specific use in meat or poultry products; and, 
concurrence of FSIS with the petitioners and FDA acceptance 
of FSIS' determination;

FDA food additive, color additive, GRAS, prior-sanctioned 
substance listings promulgated after this proposal becomes 
final that provide for meat and poultry uses.

Comments must be received by Feb. 27 (at FSIS) or March 14 
(at FDA).  For more information, contact FSIS' Ralph 
Stafko at 202-720-8168 or FDA's George Pauli at 202-418-
3090.

NU-TECH POULTRY SYSTEM RESULTS IN LESS VISIBLE CONTAMINATION 
BUT SIMILAR MICRO COUNTS, FSIS SAYS

An automated poultry evisceration system being tested in a 
Georgia plant significantly reduced visible carcass 
contamination over a Streamlined Inspection System line, but 
microbiology tests between the two lines were not 
significantly different, according to a Food Safety and 
Inspection Service midterm report on the pilot project (See 
FOOD CHEMICAL NEWS, Oct. 23, Page 30).

The October report on Stork Gamco's Nu-Tech Poultry 
Processing System, being tested in a Gainesville ConAgra 
plant, concluded that "the data supports continuing the 
pilot and approving a second pilot to verify the Nu-Tech 
system."  The Nu-Tech system operates at up to 140 birds per 
minute, with four USDA inspectors.

Postmortem disposition agreement for the Nu-Tech and SIS-2 
lines compared favorably (0.7% for the Nu-Tech line vs. 0.4% 
for the SIS-2 line) and supports the acceptability of the 
inspection procedure, the FSIS report said, adding that 
"higher condemnation rates on the Nu-Tech line may be due to 
improved visibility of the viscera target organs and the 
inside carcass cavity."

The Nu-Tech system's complete evisceration prior to 
inspection "greatly reduced internal and external visible 
contamination (digestive tract contents, feces, gall)," the 
FSIS report said, adding, "Visibly cleaner carcasses were 
presented for inspection.  Carcasses prior to final washing 
and chilling were visibly cleaner.  Visible contamination on 
the Nu-Tech line remained constant from post-evisceration to 
the final wash at 11% outside contamination and 4%-5% inside 
contamination.  Visible contamination was markedly higher 
and increased on the SIS-2 line from post-evisceration to 
the final wash from 19%-27% outside contamination and 12%-
15% inside contamination."  The Nu-Tech evisceration probe 
causes less organ damage compared to the conventional spoon 
eviscerator, FSIS said.

The number of carcasses identified for reprocessing at the 
inspection stations was similar for both systems.  The Nu-
Tech line was higher, as expected, FSIS said, adding, "The 
one-step evisceration on the Nu-Tech line prior to 
inspection allows for greater visibility inside the bird.  
The SIS-2 reprocessing rate does not include the inside and 
outside carcass contamination observed post-inspection at 
viscera separation."

No Correlation Between Visible Contamination and Microbial 
Load:  FSIS

The microbiological testing "showed no significant 
difference between the lines or between points within each 
line," the report said, adding, "There does not appear to 
be correlation between the amount of visible contamination 
on the carcass and the microbial load."

The report noted a "significant decrease in Salmonella 
presence on the SIS-2 line between rehang and prior to the 
cropper.  The interpretation of the Salmonella decrease in 
this study is not clear and will require further evaluation 
of the raw data."  ((6FCN 4609, 19 pages, $9)




Nu-Tech Project Has Lost Union Support:  Carney

The Nu-Tech pilot project, called the Poultry Carcass 
Inspection/Evisceration Project (PCIEP) by FSIS, has lost 
the support of the inspectors' union, the National Joint 
Council of Food Inspection Locals, NJC Chairman David 
Carney said in a Dec. 19 letter to acting Under Secretary 
for Food Safety Michael Taylor.

At a Dec. 14 consultation with the agency on the project, 
Carney said, "it was evident ... that FSIS management has 
made every attempt to promote PCIEP to the poultry industry 
by reducing the number of the line inspectors and increasing 
line speeds. ... FSIS has been remiss in the efforts of 
promoting PCIEP by not conducting ergonomic impact studies 
and has yet to follow through with Cumulative Trauma 
Disorder Task Group.  With lack of supporting data for PCIEP 
progression, the National Joint Council must now take the 
position that we can no longer subject inspectors to 
whimsical accommodations to the poultry industry.  It will 
now be the position of the National Joint Council that (the 
union) will no longer participate in Poultry Carcass 
Inspection Evisceration Projects."

The union asked to negotiate the "'methods, means and 
technology' of performing work" with FSIS.  Carney noted 
that although the NJC's Southern Council had engaged in a 
memorandum of understanding for the ConAgra pilot plant, 
"this does not circumvent nor diminish impact to the 
bargaining unit at other proposed test sites."

Inspectors Walk Off Line at Georgia Poultry Plant; FSIS to 
Fill Future Vacancies

As many as eight FSIS inspectors walked off a poultry line 
at a Georgia plant for several minutes recently because they 
had not been given a break.  The union said the action 
underscores how serious the shortage of inspectors has 
become.  FSIS officials said a break was planned for the 
inspectors, but that the inspectors walked off the line 
before the Inspector-in-Charge could get to them.  FSIS 
officials said poultry carcasses piled up on the floor 
during the inspectors' absence and that the agency may take 
disciplinary action.  "This tells me they think they're more 
important than the food hundreds of people are going to 
eat," one agency official said.

The only solace for the agency and industry is that the 
shortage may not get any worse.  Taylor has apparently 
decided to hire one new inspector for every one that leaves 
in the future, although the new inspector may be hired in a 
different area if agency officials think a more critical 
vacancy exists elsewhere.

Final 1,000-Plant Review Report Reiterates: Sanitation 
Biggest Problem

The final report of the 1,000-plant review conducted by 
FSIS' Review and Assessment Program was released last month, 
and the conclusions were similar to those of an interim 
report:  sanitation remains the biggest problem found in 
plants (See FOOD CHEMICAL NEWS, March 13, Page 27).

The review of 1,014 plants between October 1993 and February 
1995 resulted in 129 plants being issued Accelerated 
Deficiency Notices.  Sixty percent of all deficiencies found 
in the review were in the area of sanitation, and over 90% 
of those deficiencies were found in less than half of the 
plants reviewed.  The report also said that "dramatic short-
term decreases" in sanitation problems were found in plants 
where ADNs and Progressive Enforcement Action measures were 
applied.  The 1,000-plant review results were used to 
develop FSIS' proposed standard operating procedures for 
sanitation included in the HACCP proposal.  ((6FCN 4611, 22

DRAFT NUTRITION ACTION PLAN URGES HACCP, FOOD CODE ADOPTION

A draft report of the U.N. Plan of Action for Nutrition 
recommended the application of HACCP to pre- and post-
harvest of all foods and encouraged universal adoption of 
the Food and Drug Administration Model Food Code by all 
levels of government.

The U.S. Departments of Agriculture, Health and Human 
Services and Agency for International Development are 
seeking comment on the draft plan by Jan. 29, a Dec. 28 
Federal Register notice said.  The final U.S. Plan for 
Action is to be submitted to the World Health Organization 
for approval.  The latest effort stemmed from a 1992 meeting 
of the International Conference on Nutrition in Rome where 
159 countries agreed upon a general blueprint for improving 
world nutrition status.

Besides the HACCP and Food Code recommendations, the draft 
plan urged policymakers to improve the health and 
environmental status in animal agricultural systems by 
expanding the use of proven research such as baseline 
studies of microbiological problems to gauge contamination 
levels in the slaughter and processing of cattle and other 
species.

The report urged expanded automated information systems such 
as the Field Automation and Information Management 
initiative to support the modernization of USDA field 
inspection programs.  In-plant inspectors should have access 
to automated information systems and such technology should 
be used to improve field to headquarters communication, the 
draft plan recommended.

Plan Also Calls for Monitoring Dietary Exposure to Toxic 
Chemicals

Other recommended strategies to improve U.S. food safety 
included:  stepped-up monitoring of dietary exposure to 
toxic chemicals in foods, and continued assurances that food 
and food ingredients developed through new processing, 
packaging and packaging technologies are safe and 
nutritious.  Special nutritional foods should be regulated 
following the same standards of method and validation as for 
regular foods, the draft plan said.

The government-wide plan endorsed new technologies that 
increase shelf life of perishables, improve safety in crop 
production including Integrated Pest Management, and improve 
ways to monitor food additives and detect toxic chemicals in 
foods.

One emphasis in the draft plan was on expanding public 
education on food safety by promoting the use of hotlines 
and enhancing government disease reporting systems. 

The draft plan earmarked gaps in the U.S. food safety system 
that must be addressed in order to improve good health and 
nutrition.  The plan's authors recommended that more food 
processing operations use modern, proved effective systems 
to prevent food contamination, that legal requirements and 
enforcement for safe food handling need to keep pace with 
changes in marketing and preparation, and that some public 
water systems need to be upgraded.

The nutrition plan also focused on the need for improved 
diagnosis and reporting of foodborne and waterborne 
illnesses and for expanded consumer education.  Gaps in the 
following food safety research areas were highlighted:  

"Rapid detection and identification of foodborne and 
waterborne biological, chemical, and physical hazards; 
prevention of food and water, biological, chemical, and 
physical contamination; achievement of desired behavioral 
changes among consumers and food producers and processors; 
measurement of the incidence of foodborne and waterborne 
illness; and assessment of risk related to microbial 
organisms." 

Nutrition Monitoring Gaps Identified in Draft Report

Pointing to the current budget climate, the draft plan 
ranked the "most critical gaps" in nutrition monitoring that 
should be corrected.  

The report urged the government to develop culturally 
sensitive survey instruments for dietary information from 
high-risk groups; a set of methods and interpretive criteria 
for nutritional status and health conditions and improved 
dietary indicators; and methods that can be used by states, 
local communities and researchers that are comparable with 
national methods and allow for surveillance.  Guidelines for 
verifying and updating food composition data should also be 
revised as new methodologies are developed, the draft plan 
said.

The report also cited gaps in nutrition-sensitive food 
production and economic programs and agricultural research 
that can hinder efforts to incorporate nutrition 
considerations in national policies.  The draft plan found 
that decision-makers need to improve coordination and 
dissemination of nutrition information to food producers, 
improve information on sustainable agriculture, step up 
research information to support cost/benefit analysis of 
nutrition policies, and increase interdisciplinary training 
for those seeking careers in nutrition.

To address gaps, the report recommended a strategy that 
included basic research to enhance plant germplasm and 
sustainable production, to increase animal and fish 
production through integrated management and health systems, 
and to beef up economic analysis methods that can chart 
costs and benefits to society of healthy eating.  

The draft plan identified gaps in human nutrition research 
that may block understanding between diet and disease.  

Issues identified included:  the range in intake of 
nutrients and other food components that optimize health 
and reduce chronic disease; patterns of food intake and 
physical activity that provide the nutrition standard and 
appropriate energy balance to improve health; the point 
where nutrients interact with human genes to alter disease 
risk; factors affecting adoption and maintenance of 
behaviors that support optimal nutrition and physical 
activity patterns; and how research can translate into 
community interventions that improve health and 
nutritional status.

The draft plan called for expanded public and private 
basic and applied research into a host of areas, such as 
basic studies of nutrition and dietary modulation of gene 
expression and cellular and metabolic processes, 
bionutrition, interaction with nutrients and environmental 
agents, safer upper limits of nutrition and nutritionally 
vulnerable populations.

The document also mentioned gaps in U.S. policies that 
promote breastfeeding and proposed strategies to fix them.  

The draft U.S. action plan identified the following themes 
in the December document:  Eating for Health, Nutrition 
Security for All, Safe Food and Water from Source to 
Table, Promoting Breastfeeding, Nutrition-Sensitive Food 
Production and Economic Policy, Human Nutrition Research 
and Nutrition Monitoring.  The plan also includes an 
international section, which outlines how the U.S. 
government can support developing countries in each of the 
World Plan of Action's subject areas.

Nutrition are available from Jay Hirschman, Center for 
Nutrition Policy and Promotion, USDA, 1120 20th St., N.W.,

CALIFORNIA MARKET OWNERS FINED FOR SELLING, MISBRANDING MEAT 
ADULTERATED WITH SODIUM SULFITE

The U.S. District Court, Central District of California, has 
fined owners of a California meat market over $7,000 for 
selling adulterated and misbranded meat, according to USDA's 
Food Safety and Inspection Service.

Cazares Carniceria, a partnership doing business as Maywood 
Plaza Market, Inc., Riverside, pled guilty to selling meat 
to which sodium sulfite had been added and mixed to conceal 
damage and make the meat "appear of better and greater 
value," FSIS reported.  The partnership was fined $6,200.  
Also fined was another partner, Ignacio Cazares, who pled 
guilty to misbranding meat because it had no labeling saying 
it contained sodium sulfite.  

FSIS also reported that the partnership and Ignacio Cazares 
were placed on two years' probation for the incident, which 
took place in 1993.

Bacteria-Tainted Ice Cream, Decomposed Tuna Steaks Recalled

Potential contamination with Listeria monocytogenes bacteria 
prompted Friendly Ice Cream Corp. to recall half-gallon 
containers of its Chocolate Fudge Brownie Yogurt and Purely 
Chocolate Yogurt, according to news wire reports.  The 
company said there have been no reports of illness linked 
with the yogurt, which was manufactured in Troy, Ohio.    

The Massachusetts-based firm said it halted production of 
the frozen yogurt and issued recall of 30,000 containers 
after the Food and Drug Administration detected the 
contamination during routine testing.  The recall affected 
product distributed in Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, 
Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Hampshire, New 
York, New Jersey, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont 
and Virginia.  

A recent FDA Foods Class II enforcement report noted the 
recall of over 14,000 pounds of frozen yellow fin tuna found 
to be decomposed and containing "hazardous levels of 
histamines."  

Recalled by Tysons Foods, Inc., Springdale, Ark., the recall 
involved IQF Tuna Pieces; 4-oz. Tuna Steaks; 6-oz. Tuna 
Steaks; 8-oz. Tuna Steaks, and 4-oz. Tuna Sandwich Cuts 
manufactured by Tyson Seafood Group, Seattle, Wash.  Recall 
of the tuna, distributed nationwide as well as 
internationally, is ongoing, FDA reported.

agency for the regulation (See FOOD CHEMICAL NEWS, Aug. 22, 
1994, Page 38).

Animal Drug Sponsor Changes Announced by FDA

Jan. 4, FDA issued final rules amending animal drug sponsor 
regulations to reflect changes in sponsor name and addresses 
and one change in sponsor:

 522.883, etorphine hydrochloride injection, was amended to 
change the sponsor from Fort Dodge Laboratories to Wildlife 
Laboratories, Inc.;

 510 was amended to reflect a change of sponsor name and 
address from American Cyanamid Co. to American Cyanamid, 
Division of American Homes Products, P.O. Box 1339, Fort 
Dodge, Iowa  50501, and to reflect a change of sponsor 
address for TRINADA, Inc. to One Executive Drive, P.O. Box

POLYMALEIC ACID AND ITS SODIUM SALT CLEARED FOR USE IN 
PRODUCTION OF BEET AND CANE SUGAR JUICE, LIQUOR

The Food and Drug Administration issued a final rule Jan. 5 
amending  173.45, polymaleic acid and its sodium salt, to 
clear its use to control mineral scale during the production 
of beet and cane sugar juice and liquor at higher levels 
than the maximum currently permitted, as well as to amend 
specifications for the additives.  

Ciba-Geigy, Inc. submitted a petition to FDA for the 
regulations (See FOOD CHEMICAL NEWS, Dec. 3, 1990, Page 34) 
containing information on a new manufacturing process which 
resulted in a lower weight-average molecular weight and 
number-average molecular weight than those currently 
permitted.  

FDA issued a tentative final rule May 2, 1995 (See FOOD 
CHEMICAL NEWS, May 8, 1995, Page 22), noting that the 
molecular weight determinations (weight-average in the range 
of 540 to 850; number-average in the range of 520 to 650) 
are to be based on the improved analytical method submitted 
by Ciba-Geigy, entitled "Determinations of Molecular Weight 
Distribution of Poly(Maleic) Acid."  Having received no 
comments or responses to the tentative final rule, FDA 
concluded it should be issued as a final rule.

CDC FOODBORNE DISEASE INVESTIGATION EFFORTS CRIPPLED BY 
BUDGET STALEMATE

The month-long budget stalemate has yet to have long-term 
consequences for the national sentinel site program but has 
crippled the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's 
ability to investigate foodborne outbreaks (See FOOD 
CHEMICAL NEWS, July 17, Page 37).

"No doubt the furloughs have made it difficult to keep the 
national surveillance system going," remarked CDC Medical 
Epidemiologist Fred Angulo.  State and local health 
departments are still collecting and reporting surveillance 
data to CDC investigators, but the agency cannot synthesize 
the data without support staff, he explained.  

Travel is severely restricted, so CDC has had to postpone 
site assistance to state officials who have requested help 
from federal disease investigators, he added.  The budget 
crisis means states are not provided with resources to 
determine the magnitude of potential foodborne outbreaks.

"Fortunately, nothing major has happened," Angulo said, 
warning that the government shutdown could place CDC 
officials in a difficult situation if there were another 
deadly outbreak such as the Hanta Virus.  "How would we 
respond when we have no support?" Angulo said.

Another key area where disease control officials are 
crippled is laboratory support.  With CDC's reference 
laboratory closed, federal officials are unable to analyze 
difficult case samples forwarded by state health 
departments.  These samples are checked against the federal 
laboratory's large specimen collection.  "We are the only 
lab in the country that does this," Angelo noted.

While CDC has not been able to synthesize data from the 
national sentinel site program, a multi-agency effort to 
chart foodborne disease trends, the schedule is not likely 
to slip, CDC's Angulo predicted.  

Since the objective of the program is not to respond to 
daily outbreaks but to record long-term trends, the 
furloughs are expected to have only a short-term impact.  
The information is still being forwarded to CDC and, once 
the government budget battle is over, the data can be "run 
through computers," he explained.  

"We've been unable to compile information and look at it," 
he said.  "But when the furlough ends, we will be on the 
same schedule."

HHS Moves to Shore Up Health Statistics Branch

Meanwhile, CDC Director David Satcher was told Dec. 13 that 
the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services would be 
designating a "consolidated health statistics entity" to 
strengthen and coordinate general-purpose health surveys 
throughout HHS.

HHS Secretary Donna Shalala said the new effort will create 
a stronger National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) 
while keeping the agency within CDC.  Shalala stressed that 
the new effort must continue to be objective and neutral in 
providing the foundation for health policy. 

Among the changes, Shalala plans to strengthen the role of 
NCHS director, expand NCHS's role in HHS data policy and 
provide the agency with greater independence and "a greater 
ability for NCHS to assume responsibility for the integrity, 
quality and efficiency of HHS statistics effort."

Shalala said she plans to review the changes in two years 
and assess whether NCHS should stay in CDC in meeting 
statistics objectives.  ((6FCN 4612, 35 pages, $13)

DIETARY GUIDELINES VIRTUALLY UNCHANGED FROM ADVISORY PANEL'S 
RECOMMENDATIONS

The fourth edition of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 
unveiled last week as the "gold standard for good nutrition 
and health," is virtually unchanged from the draft prepared 
this summer by the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee 
(See FOOD CHEMICAL NEWS, Aug. 28, Page 38).  

The guidelines for the first time include information on 
physical activity and dieting, vegetarian diets and 
recommendations that adults maintain their body weight as 
they age.  They also include an expanded section on grains, 
fruits and vegetables.

The guidelines, last issued in 1990, were generally praised 
by industry and consumer groups.  However, the American 
Frozen Food Institute said the guidelines mislead consumers 
by suggesting that eating cooked or raw vegetables is the 
only way to obtain proper vegetable servings.  "[T]his 
language omits other categories of vegetable products, such 
as frozen," the group said.

In the only reference to frozen foods, the guidelines state, 
"The availability of fresh fruits and vegetables varies by 
season and region of the country, but frozen and canned 
fruits and vegetables ensure a plentiful supply of these 
healthful foods throughout the year." 

Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala stressed 
that the guidelines reflect an increased understanding of 
the role of physical activity in maintaining an adequate 
diet.  "Diet and exercise are the twin engines that can 
carry you on the road to good health," she said at a Jan. 2 
news conference.

Baltimore Researchers Find Weight Loss Is More Effective 
than Exercise in Reducing CHD in Middle-aged and Older 
Overweight Men

Several recent studies published in prominent medical 
journals have examined the effects of weight loss and 
aerobic activity on heart disease and other health 
conditions.

Weight loss proved more effective in improving coronary 
artery disease profiles than exercise did in a group of 170 
obese middle-aged and older men, a group of Baltimore-based 
gerontology experts led by physician Leslie Katzel of the 
University of Maryland School of Medicine noted in a study 
published in the Dec. 27 Journal of the American Medical 
Association.  The scientists set out to compare the effects 
of weight loss vs. aerobic exercise training on CAD risk 
factors in healthy, sedentary, obese, middle-aged and older 
men.  Ninety-seven percent of the study subjects were white.

Seventy-three subjects started a nine-month, diet-induced 
weight loss program; another 71 an aerobic exercise program, 
and 26 served as a control group.  The "controls" were 
instructed not to lose weight or change their diets or level 
of physical activity for nine months.  During the test time 
period, dropouts affected each group  -- 44 finished the 
weight-loss program, 49 finished the aerobic program and 18 
controls completed their assignment.  All original test 

subjects were instructed for three months in the principles 
of an isoenergetic American Heart Association phase I diet 
before the study began.

Study results showed that "weight loss significantly 
improves lipoprotein concentrations, glucose tolerance, 
postprandial insulin levels and blood pressure levels, 
whereas aerobic exercise training in the absence of weight 
loss training has substantially less beneficial effects on 
these parameters," Katzel et al. noted, adding:  "This 
suggests that weight loss should be an integral part of 
interventions to reduce CAD risk in obese, middle-aged and 
older individuals."

In an editorial in the JAMA issue, physician William Hazzard 
of the Bowman Gray School of Medicine, Wake Forest 
University, Winston-Salem, N.C., noted that "the most 
encouraging news from this study is that carefully 
supervised weight loss achieved through reduced energy 
intake ... can significantly reduce blood pressure, fasting 
glucose levels (and improve oral glucose tolerance), 
triglycerides and low density lipoprotein cholesterol 
levels, all serving to improve CAD profiles.  Correlational 
analyses suggested that the reduction in fat mass achieved 
was central to these changes."

The study by Katzel et al. also "forms another link in the 
chain of evidence pointing toward weight control as a 
principal feature of a successful preventive strategy" for 
slowing the negative health effects often felt by aging 
Americans, Hazzard noted.  Successful aging, or preventive 
gerontology, has as its cardinal principle "the discovery of 
synergistic strategies or common pathways to preserving 
health and promoting health longevity," he said, adding:

"This study further legitimizes the pathogenetic sequence 
that has underlain our advice to aging Americans -- i.e., 
sedentary behavior begets central adiposity begets insulin 
resistance begets hypertriglyceridemia, hyperglycemia, 
increased LDL concentrations, decreased HDL concentrations 
and hypertension.  ... However, as demonstrated in this 
study, weight loss reverses this cascade."

Noncentral Obesity, While Less Serious than Central Obesity, 
Still Has Major Health Effects:  Manitoba Researchers

While central obesity, which is characterized by fat 
concentrated in the upper body and high waist-to-hip ratios 
(WHR), is considered the most potentially health-adverse 
type of obesity, Canadian researchers who published a study 
in the same JAMA issue are concerned that people who are 
noncentrally obese are not aware that their condition also 
is likely to be bad for their health.  The scientists 
defined noncentrally obese people as being overall obese but 
with low WHR.

A representative sample of 2,792 adult residents of 
Manitoba, Canada, aged 18 to 74, were interviewed for the 
Manitoba Heart Health Survey.  Of that group, 2,339 
underwent clinical examinations.  Blood pressure, fasting 
plasma glucose, total cholesterol, triglycerides, high 
density lipoprotein and low density lipoprotein measurements 
were compared with body mass index (BMI) and WHR.

The Manitoba survey was part of a national effort to 
estimate the prevalence and distribution patterns of 
cardiovascular risk factors and assess the level of 
knowledge regarding cardiovascular health among Canadians.  
In conducting the survey, physician T. Kue Young and 
colleague Dale Gelskey of the Faculty of Medicine, 
University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, found that noncentral 
obesity is not metabolically benign.  BMI as an overall 
measure of obesity is as important as, and sometimes more 
important than, WHR in predicting metabolic effects."

Noncentral obesity is associated with a more unfavorable 
profile of blood pressure, plasma lipids and glucose 
compared with the nonobese, the researchers noted.  The 
Manitoba findings were similar to those from a study on male 
Japanese urban workers, among whom both BMI and WHR were 
associated with blood pressure, total cholesterol and HDL.

"There was a gradation in mean systolic and diastolic blood 
pressure between the nonobese, the noncentrally obese and 
the centrally obese," Young and Gelskey said, adding:  
"While WHR was the stronger predictor than BMI for systolic 
blood pressure, the reverse was true for diastolic blood 
pressure. ... Our data relating to BMI and WHR are relevant 
to the design and implementation of health education and 
promotion.  Participants of risk assessment programs who are 
identified as noncentrally obese should still be offered 
appropriate nutritional and behavioral counseling for weight 
control, since this type of obesity is associated with 
significant metabolic effects, although of a reduced 
magnitude than central obesity."

JAMA Contributors Disagree on the Possibility that Blood 
Cholesterol-lowering Drugs May Contribute to Cancer

Researchers/physicians Thomas Newman and Stephen Hulley of 
the School of Medicine, University of California, San 
Francisco, concluded in a "special communication" in the 
Jan. 3 JAMA that, after a literature review of the findings 
and implications of rodent carcinogenicity linked to lipid-
lowering drugs, "the results of experiments in animals and 
humans suggest that lipid-lowering drug treatment, 
especially with the fibrates and statins, should be avoided 
except in patients at high short-term risk of coronary heart 
disease."  They added that "most cholesterol-lowering drugs 
cause or promote cancer in rodents."

They caution, however, that extrapolation of this evidence 
of carcinogenesis from rodents to humans is an uncertain 
process, requiring longer-term clinical trials and careful 
postmarketing surveillance during the next several decades.

Two physicians/researchers from the University of Arizona 
School of Medicine in Tucson disagreed with Newman and 
Hulley's findings, noting in a JAMA commentary in the same 
issue that "Newman and Hulley speculate that some classes of 
lipid-lowering drugs are more likely to cause cancer than 
others.  This speculation overlooks the fact that dietary 
treatment [used to lower lipids] has been reported to have 
the same apparent impact on cancer mortality as drug 
therapy.  If there is a relationship between treatment of 
elevated cholesterol levels and cancer, the critical factor 
would have to be lowering cholesterol levels, not the 
specific drug selected for therapy."

James Dalen and William Dalton noted that they agreed with 
Newman and Hulley that all drugs should be subjected to 
safety monitoring before and after their introduction to 
clinical use.  But they added:  "We do not agree that a 20-
year randomized clinical trial is feasible or necessary."

The Arizona doctors said that Newman and Hulley "have not 
presented convincing evidence that cholesterol lowering by 
diet or drugs increases the risk of cancer death.  Their 
frequently reported recommendations that screening for and 
treatment of high cholesterol should be limited to those 
patients who are at greatest risk of CHD death, i.e., those 
with established CHD, might be supported by cost 
considerations but cannot be supported on the basis of 
safety or the risk of cancer."

Primary prevention of CHD should remain an important public-
health priority, Dalen and Dalton said, but deciding "the 
appropriate age to begin screening and treatment requires 
further discussion and careful consideration of the costs.  
We hope the National Cholesterol Education Program will 
address these issues in their future meetings."

Long-term Postmenopausal Hormone Therapy Does Not Halt 
Weight Gain, Fat Distribution

Menopause has been associated with increases in upper body 
(android) fat distribution, researchers Donna Kritz-
Silverstein and Elizabeth Barrett-Connor of the Department 
of Family and Preventive Medicine, University of California 
in San Diego, noted in the Jan. 3 JAMA, and they set out to 
see if such weight gain and distribution occurred in women 
taking hormone replacement therapy at the same rate as it 
occurred in women not taking HRT.

They reported the results of a 15-year cohort study of 671 
women aged 65 to 94 who lived in Rancho Bernardo, Calif.  
The women fell into three groups  -- those who had never used 
hormone replacement therapy (194), those who used HRT 
intermittently (331), and those who used HRT continuously 
from the start of the study (from 1972 to 1974, ending with 
follow-up clinic visits between 1988 and 1991).

After adjustment for potentially confounding covariates, 
"there were no significant differences between estrogen 
users and nonusers in BMI at follow-up, change in weight or 
BMI between baseline and follow-up, or WHR or fat mass at 
follow-up," Kritz-Silverstein and Barrett-Connor said.

The researchers noted that many factors other than 
menopausal status are related to the prevalence of obesity 
and fat distribution, which varies substantially by ethnic 
and socioeconomic group.  The Rancho Bernardo subjects were 
white, relatively well-educated and at baseline leaner on 
average than the U.S. population, Kritz-Silverstein and 
Barrett-Connor said, adding:  "Therefore, these findings may 
not be generalizable to populations consisting of other 
racial, ethnic or socioeconomic groups."

Studies Look at Adult Alcohol Consumption's Role in Adult 
Respiratory Health, Children's Cancer 

A group of researchers led by physician Mark Moss of the 
Department of Medicine, Denver General Hospital, looked at 
the effect of chronic alcohol abuse on the incidence of 
acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and in-hospital 
mortality.  Their results, published in the Jan. 3 JAMA, 
showed that a prior history of chronic alcohol abuse 
"increases the risk of developing ARDS in critically ill 
patients with an identified at-risk diagnosis."

There are seven diagnoses that have been defined as causing 
a patient to be at risk for the development of ARDS:  
sepsis, severe pancreatitis, hyper-transfusion, witnessed 
aspiration of gastric contents, abdominal trauma, chest 
trauma and multiple fractures, Moss et al. noted.  They had 
a total of 351 consecutive patients enrolled in their study 
between 1986 and 1993, with the largest group being white 
males.

ARDS is associated with a mortality rate of 40% to 60%, Moss 
et al. noted, and they hope that their results "may be 
useful in the earlier and more accurate identification of 
patients at high risk for developing ARDS."  No specific 
therapy currently exists for treating ARDS, but people at 
high risk for the syndrome might benefit from the early use 
of respiratory and cardiovascular monitoring devices and 
other forms of intensive care unit  technology, the 
researchers said, adding:  "Furthermore, the identification 
of additional risk factors for the development or ARDS could 
yield new insights into the pathophysiology of the 
syndrome."

The use of alcoholic beverages "poses a serious health 
problem for the American society," Moss et al. noted, adding 
that in 1985, an estimated 10.6 million Americans were 
dependent on alcohol, and an additional 7.3 million 
experienced some negative sociological consequences of 
alcohol abuse.  The National Institute of Alcohol Abuse and 
Alcoholism "has estimated that alcohol-related problems cost 
our society $117 billion in 1983, and this figure has likely 
increased over the past decade."  

Meanwhile, an evaluation of data from a Children's Cancer 
Group case-control study was conducted by a group of 
researchers led by Xiao-Ou Shu and Julie Ross of the 
Division of Pediatric Epidemiology/Clinical Research, 
University of Minnesota, Minneapolis."  The conclusions 
reached by Shu et al., and published in the Jan. 3 edition 
of the Journal of the National Cancer Institute, were that 
maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy increases the 
risk of infant leukemia, especially acute myeloid leukemias 
(AML), while maternal smoking does not elevate risk for 
either AML or acute lymphoid leukemias (ALL).  The 
implication is that "in utero exposure to alcohol may 
contribute to leukemogenesis involving myeloid cells."

Paternal alcohol consumption did not confer an increased 
risk of infant leukemia, but paternal smoking one month 
prior to pregnancy was related to an elevated risk of ALL 
(OR = 1.56 and 95% CI = 1.03-3.26).

In the Children's Cancer Group study, 302 leukemia cases 
(203 ALLs, 88 AMLs and 11 other leukemia types) were 
diagnosed in children 18 months of age and younger, and 558 
individually matched, regional controls were included in the 
analysis.  Information about parental alcohol consumption 
and smoking behavior during pregnancy and the month prior to 
it was collected by telephone. 

Future studies should focus on the evaluation of the effect 
of timing of alcohol consumption, morphology-specific 
associations and interaction between alcohol consumption and 
other environmental exposures, Shu et al. noted.  Studies of 
biologic mechanisms for alcohol exposure during pregnancy 
and infant leukemia are also warranted, they said.

FUTURE FSIS INSPECTION SYSTEM TO BE DEVELOPED BEGINNING WITH 
FEDERAL REGISTER NOTICE, PUBLIC MEETING:  TAYLOR

USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service will begin a 
public process soon to determine how the agency will use its 
inspection resources under a HACCP-based inspection system, 
acting Under Secretary for Food Safety Michael Taylor told 
FOOD CHEMICAL NEWS in an interview last week (See FOOD 
CHEMICAL NEWS, Dec. 18, Page 29).

"We've begun talking informally with constituencies about a 
process through which we would develop alternative modes of 
deploying our inspection resources both within plants and 
downstream, during transportation, distribution and retail," 
Taylor said, adding that the agency "would then pilot test 
and gather data to demonstrate that these alternative modes 
are better from a food safety standpoint.  Our goal here is 
not to save money or to reduce the resources we apply to 
this oversight, but to improve food safety by redeploying 
our resources.  We aren't going to make any changes in our 
inspection program unless we are confident that it will work 
to improve food safety."

Taylor said the process will begin "in the next month or so" 
with a Federal Register notice announcing a public meeting 
"and other opportunities for people to help design the 
pilots."  The data from the pilots "will be made available 
in a way that people can participate in evaluating what 
we've learned" so the agency gets "the broadest possible 
input into modernizing how we use our inspection resources," 
Taylor said.

The agency has been plagued by a shortage of inspectors and 
a budget shortfall that has stretched resources thin.  At 
the same time, Taylor has pledged to expand the agency's 
inspection oversight as part of a farm-to-table food safety 
system, and FSIS inspectors are also expected to perform 
additional monitoring and verification duties under HACCP.  
Figuring out how to reconcile all that was one of the main 
charges of the agency's "top-to-bottom" review (See FOOD 
CHEMICAL NEWS, Sept. 11, Pages 4, 7 and 27).

Reinventing Inspection Central to New Strategy

" ...  We have a new framework, a HACCP framework, for the 
plants we inspect, which will require new tasks being 
performed by our inspectors; we also have a farm-to-table 
strategy that says there are going to be roles for FSIS at 
the transportation stage, distribution, and perhaps greater 
involvement in the retail level," Taylor said, adding, "So 
we've got new roles and responsibilities, we've got to keep 
achieving what we've achieved in the past, because what 
we've done in the past is valuable, but with all that, we're 
not likely to get significant new resources to do this job.  
So it's very clear and very central to our new strategy that 
we reinvent inspection itself."

How the agency carries out its statutory mandate of carcass-
by-carcass inspection is likely to be central to the debate.  
One agency plan would replace the current two to three line 
inspectors in broiler plants with one "zone" inspector, with 
plant employees performing sorting tasks (See FOOD CHEMICAL 
NEWS, Dec. 25, Page 53).  Agency officials have also 
discussed eliminating one of the inspection points of head, 
viscera or rail, and one top-to-bottom team recommended 
requiring plants to present only "normal" animals for 
inspection. 

"There's a lot of work that's gone on to begin to develop 
some possible alternative modes of inspection, and certainly 
looking at alternative ways to carry out the carcass-by-
carcass mandate would be part of an overall alternative," 
Taylor said, adding, "We wouldn't be looking at that in 
isolation from how we're overseeing HACCP within that plant 
or how we're inspecting downstream from that plant.  But 
there's no question, going back to the National Academy of 
Sciences' report on a risk assessment approach to poultry 
inspection (1987), that there are opportunities to still 
achieve the very important consumer protection objectives of 
the current system of inspection but then make better use of 
our inspectors in addressing higher-priority food safety 
issues.  We're not wed to any particular alternative. ... We 
plan to lay out some possibilities in the Federal Register 
and the public meeting and have a public discussion about 
them."

Taylor was sympathetic to the concerns of the inspectors' 
union, the National Joint Council of Food Inspection Locals, 
which is likely to be a formidable obstacle to change in the 
current inspection system.  "Everybody knows that we need to 
improve the way we do our job and use our resources and I 
think everyone is also rightfully concerned that we make 
these changes in a way that really will make things better," 
Taylor said, adding, "It's not change for change's sake.  
Our employees, the industry community, the consumer 
community, the scientific community all have a legitimate 
set of interests and concerns that we need to consider and 
take full advantage of, and we're going to have a process 
that does that.  It's a very important undertaking, but it's 
very central to the success of the food safety initiative."

Reorganization Plan to Go to Glickman This Week; Reinventing 
Government Discussed

Taylor also said that the agency's reorganization plan will 
formally go to Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman this week.  
Details on the plan, which appeared in FOOD CHEMICAL NEWS in 
December, will likely be made available this week (See FOOD 
CHEMICAL NEWS, Dec. 11, Page 5).  Taylor said the plan is a 
"sweeping reorganization aimed not at downsizing the agency 
but at making the best possible use of all the resources we 
have both in the field and in headquarters.  It will be a 
reorganization that is in line with our HACCP, our farm-to-
table food safety strategy."

Taylor made his comments as the agency published several 
documents as part of USDA's reinventing food safety 
initiative (See stories, Pages 18 and 25).  A National 
Performance Review report on current and future USDA and FDA 
food safety initiatives is expected to be released today.

Taylor said the "focal point" of the four FSIS documents was 
an advance notice of proposed rulemaking laying out the 
agency's regulatory reform strategy and listing regulations 
to be revised or eliminated to conform with HACCP.  "I know 
this has been a concern of a number of constituencies, 
particularly industry, that we not simply layer HACCP on top 
of the existing system," Taylor said, adding, "We are very 
committed to having a single integrated inspection that's 
centered around HACCP.  For HACCP to be successful, we have 
to very thoroughly review and reform our existing 
regulations."

Taylor said the regulatory review, reinventing inspection 
and the reorganization are all part of the agency's 
reinventing itself as it moves to a HACCP-based inspection 
system.  "In order to make HACCP work, we need to change 
FSIS in a very fundamental way," he said.

Taylor reiterated his commitment to make existing regulations 
compatible with HACCP before plants are required to implement 
HACCP.  Taylor said the agency is conducting a "page-by-page 
review" of existing regulations.  The initiative "goes beyond 
those that relate to safety and thus to HACCP to include all 
of our labeling regulations, our standards of identity, all of 
our prior approval systems for labeling, equipment, 
facilities.  There are a significant number of rulemaking 
initiatives coming along that not only support our HACCP 
initiative but are part of the president's regulatory reform 
and reinvention of government."

Two published proposals would eliminate duplicative review of 
ingredients with FDA and establish a "generic amendment that 
would permit nutritionally improved standardized foods to be 
sold under a standardized name," Taylor said.  A final rule 
published the same day (Dec. 29) streamlined the prior label 
approval process.

Other "very significant proposals" are forthcoming that 
would eliminate prior approval of facilities, equipment and 
blueprints and establish a performance standard for cooked 
meat and poultry products, Taylor said.  A "very good draft" 
of an advance notice of proposed rulemaking on 
transportation, being done in concert with FDA, has been 
completed and will be published in the "next couple months," 
Taylor said.

The agency is also moving ahead on the issue of carcass 
washing versus trimming after an October public meeting on 
the issue (See FOOD CHEMICAL NEWS, Oct. 30, Page 31).  "That 
was a good discussion of that issue and we have a lot of 
information to consider," Taylor said, adding, "We have data 
from the steam-vacuum trials that are very relevant to this 
issue, and we intend to take a next step on that issue and 
we're working on it."

Despite the frenzy of activity at FSIS, rumors have 
persisted that Taylor will depart with the publication of a 
final HACCP rule.  Taylor said the rumors are untrue.  "I've 
heard the rumors but there's absolutely nothing to it," he 
said, adding, "We've got a lot of work to do."

"We're all very busy but we've got a lot of very capable, 
committed people working very hard to get this done," he 
said, adding, "It is amazing to me how much is being 
produced.  It's a heroic effort that employees here are 
making."

BRIEF NOTES

The Produce Marketing Association on Dec. 22 asked the 
Federal Trade Commission to investigate an advertisement in 
the Dec. 11 issue of Supermarket News by Food & Water, Inc.  
PMA charged that the ad, which stated that pesticide 
residues on produce kill more Americans than assault weapons 
(See FOOD CHEMICAL NEWS, Dec. 18, Page 45), are unfair and 
deceptive.  PMA asked the FTC to issue a cease-and-desist 
order against the ad as well as statements by Food & Water 
that produce treated with agricultural chemicals in 
compliance with government regulations is unsafe. 

The Food Safety and Inspection Service Dec. 29 issued a 
final rule that expands the types of labeling that are 
authorized for use on meat and poultry in both official U.S. 
establishments and certified foreign establishments.  The 
rule is said to eliminate unnecessary duplication in the 
labeling system, and is part of the Reinventing Government 
proposal (See related stories, Pages 18 and 25).  The 
effective date of the rule is July 1.

FSIS Dec. 29 also published another Reinventing Government 
proposed rule that would give definitions of meat and 
poultry products that have been altered due to their 
nutritional content (i.e., "fat free," "low fat," "light").  
Comments on the proposal are due Feb. 27, and questions 
should be addressed to Charles Edwards, 202-254-2565.

Egg quality assurance and the end of the federal Salmonella 
program were the subjects of two recent letters.  On Nov. 
20, Rep. Joe Skeen (R-N.M.), chairman of the Appropriations 
subcommittee on Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and 
Drug Administration and related agencies, asked for "an 
appropriate" amount of federal assistance to be given to the 
Salmonella enteritidis program in 1996 (the budget for which 
has been entirely cut) to allow for a smooth transition from 
a federal program to a state-industry program.  William 
Bell, executive director of the New England Poultry 
Association, wrote to Michael Taylor, USDA acting under 
secretary for food safety, Dec. 13, asking that FSIS 
employee and SE program worker Sheila Foster be funded 
through June to help train state egg-grading personnel to 
act as SE control monitors.

FSIS will be inviting the American Association of Meat 
Processors, the Eastern Meat Packers Association and other 
industry groups to discuss the inspector harassment issue.  
The meeting probably will be held this month in Washington, 
AAMP said Jan. 1 (See FOOD CHEMICAL NEWS, Nov. 13, Page 8).

FSIS Dec. 1 allowed Venta de Especialidades Quimicas S.A., a 
Spanish firm, the right to allow the use of a blend of 
carrageenan (70%), xanthan gum (15%) and locust bean gum 
(15%) as a binder mix injected in water-added hams to 
prevent purging of the brine solution.  A letter to the firm 
said FSIS anticipated initiating rulemaking on the subject 
shortly (See FOOD CHEMICAL NEWS, Oct. 2, Page 9).

Food & Water, Inc. is planning a Jan. 23 press conference in 
Washington at which Samuel Epstein of the University of 
Illinois will present new research on the health risks of 
dairy products from cows treated with bovine somatotropin.

George Giddings died suddenly Dec. 24, according to 
Isomedix, Whippany, N.J.  Giddings was a consultant to 
Isomedix, and helped prepare the petition, now under 
consideration by the Department of Agriculture, seeking 
approval of irradiation of beef.

The "Seafood HACCP Road Show," a series of seminars 
explaining the recently published final rule, has a couple 
of tentative dates lined up for this winter.  Put on by 
FDA's Office of Seafood, the road show hopes to hit the 
highway in February, with a meeting held before, after or 
during the Feb. 18-21 Pacific Fisheries Technologists 
conference in San Diego, Calif.  Also on the agenda are as-
yet-unscheduled seminars in New Orleans and Baltimore and 
one coinciding with the March 12-14 Boston Seafood Show, an 
FDA-er said last week.  Funds permitting, the road show may 
also get to Hawaii, the FDA-er noted, because regulators and 
industry there complained about the difficulty they had 
getting to any of the Pacific Coast meetings of FDA's 
earlier series of informational seminars about the seafood 
HACCP proposed rule (See FOOD CHEMICAL NEWS, Jan. 31, 1994, 
Page 16).  For more definite information about the upcoming 
seminars, call the Office of Seafood at 202-418-3133 in 
early February.

None of the 186 samples of domestic and imported animal 
feeds tested for pesticide residues by FDA's Center for 
Veterinary Medicine in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 
1995 (July 1 to Sept. 30, 1995) were considered to have 
exceeded regulatory guidances, according to a Dec. 26 
memorandum to regional food and drug directors, district 
directors and state feed control officials from Randy 
Arbaugh, Division of Federal-State Relations, Office of 
Regional Operations, of FDA's Office of Regulatory Affairs.  
Tests conducted by FDA regional offices found a variety of 
pesticides, including diazinon, chlorpyrifos-methyl, 
chlorpyrifos-ethyl, malathion, pirimiphos-methyl, diazinon, 
DDT, lindane, fonofos and gardona.  ((6FCN 4613, 8 pages,

The Food and Drug Administration announced Jan. 4 the 
availability of a report prepared by the Center for 
Veterinary Medicine's Fluoroquinolone Working Group.  
Addressing issues related to the center's approval of 
fluoroquinolone antimicrobial drugs in food animals, the 
report was written to respond to concerns about "increased 
 ... resistance in zoonotic organisms" in food animals that 
are transmitted to humans and cause disease.  The report, 
which will be featured in a full-length story next week, is 
available by contacting the Communication and Education 
Branch, CVM, 7500 Standish Place, Rockville, Md. 20855.

A test being developed by Cornell University researchers 
with funding from the New York Center for Advanced 
Technology in Biotechnology is aimed at being a more 
sensitive and reliable method to test municipal water 
supplies for Cryptosporidium parvum, the university 
reported.  Cornell also said that researchers at the 
university have worked out a way of using carbonation to 
keep dairy products fresh and fortified for months.

The Lancet reported in its Dec. 23/30 issue that 
Streptococcus suis is a threat to pig farmers and abattoir 
workers.  The study found that the pathogen can enter the 
body through cuts or cracks in the skin surface, and can 
lead to fulminate sepsis and a type of meningitis, among 
other serious diseases.  "Infection could possibly be 
prevented by prompt disinfection of skin injuries of persons 
at risk," the article said.

Caroline Smith DeWaal of the Center for Science in the 
Public Interest said she did not mean to imply that only 
restaurants are responsible for food safety (See FOOD 
CHEMICAL NEWS, Dec. 25, Page 23).  "The bottom line is that 
-- from farm to table -- we all need to share responsibility 
for food safety.  My remarks at the USDA conference are 
clear that neither consumers nor restaurants have sole 
responsibility for ensuring the safety of food products," 
DeWaal wrote the National Restaurant Association's Robert 
Harrington.  Harrington had expressed concern about her use 
of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data.

Tracking Foodborne Pathogens from Farm to Table:  Data Needs 
to Evaluate Control Options is available from USDA's 
Economic Research Service.  The proceedings cover the 
meeting held on the issue last January (See FOOD CHEMICAL 
NEWS, Jan. 16, Page 38).  It costs $18; call  1-800-999-6779

Some of the active compounds in Sho-saiko-to, a Chinese 
herbal medicine, may have antimutagenic effects, according 
to a paper by Masanori Ohtsuka and colleagues published in 
the December Japanese Journal of Cancer Research.

Some noted food writers and scientists don't want olestra 
used, according to an article in the Jan. 3 New York Times.  
Marion Nestle, chairwoman of the department of nutrition and 
food studies, New York University, and Clark Wolf, a New 
York restaurant consultant, both listed the product as one 
of the things they would "best like forgotten."  Others said 
that they wanted a return to fatty foods (eaten in 
moderation) instead of less tasty low-fat substitutes.

Conjugated lineoleic acid, a polyunsaturated fat found in 
red meat, has been proven to inhibit breast and skin cancer 
in three rodent studies, according to the November/December 
issue of the 1995 Meat Board Research/Meat Science Update.
