Energy Company Picks ex-GM CEO to Head Board

Energy Conversion Devices, Inc. (ECD), has hired retired chairman
and CEO of General Motors Corporation Robert C. Stempel to chair its
board of directors and direct its management team.  ECD, an 
innovative products company that emphasizes alternative energy 
technologies, announced its decision after a stockholders meeting 
last week.

Stempel, who was senior business and technical advisor to the
outgoing president and CEO, has worked on ECD's joint venture with
GM to produce nickel metal hydride batteries for use in electric 
vehicles.

The project, called the "Ovonic Battery," is managed by Ovonic
Battery Company, Inc., an ECD subsidiary.

"ECD's activities with the Ovonic NiMH battery and photovoltaics fit
perfectly with my personal interests in electric vehicles and
renewable energy sources," Stempel said.

The company's outgoing president and CEO Stanford Ovishinsky said
Stempel's "engineering skills, his ability to work with and motivate
people and his character and integrity make (him) an outstanding 
addition to ECD and its board of directors."

Weld Still Favors Electric Vehicles in Massachusetts

In light of California's recent turnabout on the two percent 
electric vehicle (EV) mandate, Massachusetts Governor William Weld 
and environmental affairs secretary Trudy Coxe last week reaffirmed 
the state's commitment to its zero emission vehicle (ZEV) program.

"We think the California Air Resources staff made the wrong
recommendation," Weld said, "but that decision does not bind
Massachusetts."

Coxe added that ZEVs are alive and well in the state.  "The Clean
Air Act sets standards which we have met by setting good 
requirements for both mobile and stationary sources.  We have 
exercised our rights under the Clean Air Act, passed a Massachusetts 
Clean Air Law, and set the requirements for low and zero emission 
vehicles.  That's that," Coxe said.

Boston Edison Co. has endorsed Weld's unwavering position on the
retention of clean air mandates and support for EV development in
Massachusetts.

"The Governor clearly recognizes that elimination of the clear air
mandates could have multiple negative impacts on Massachusetts,"
said Carl Gustin, Boston Edison senior vice president.  "Without the 
environmental benefits of electric vehicles, business and industries 
in the Commonwealth could face stiffer environmental requirements in 
order for the state to comply with the Clean Air Act."

Backing away from the EV mandates could place a huge obstacle in the
path of plans to manufacture EVs and the components in South Boston,
Gustin pointed out.  He added that the EV industry could create more 
than 3,000 manufacturing jobs in the state.

Groups Blast Wilson for Plan to Change ZEV Policy

California Governor Pete Wilson is taking heat from environmental
groups for a recent move to do away with a law that would require
60,000 automobiles sold statewide to be zero-emissions vehicles 
(ZEV) by the year 2000.

The California Air Resources Board released a proposal last week to
cancel the regulation after an intense campaign by oil and auto
interests to amend the state's ZEV program.  The proposal, which is 
still in outline form, suggests substituting a demonstration of 
3,750 ZEVs just in Sacramento and Los Angeles for a two percent 
statewide mandate, which would put 60,000 ZEVs on the road.

Coalition for Clean Air representative Tim Carmichael said his group
sees "no scientific or technical reason to delay" implementation.
And Melissa Kaznitz, of CALPIRG, accused Wilson of "selling out the 
environment, high-tech business and consumers to support his 
generous patrons in the oil industry."

The two percent figure is intended to be the first step toward a 10
percent requirement for the year 2003.

The proposal leaves the 10 percent figure intact, but environmental
groups worry that without the incremental step, car companies will
not take the 10 percent mandate seriously.  "From zero to 10 percent 
is a giant leap," said Jamie Phillips of the Planning and 
Conservation League.  "It requires a leap of faith in the car 
companies, in whom we have little faith."

Project Puts Waste Oil to Work

A project at the Institute of Gas Technology (IGT)  recently
uncovered a way to produce hydrogen using waste motor oil and steam,
a development that could radically change the hydrogen fuel cell 
industry.

IGT researchers employed the steam-and-waste-oil process to produce
a sulfur-tolerant catalyst that produces hydrogen.  The procedure
has been used successfully in the past with liquid feed stocks like 
jet fuel, diesel and coal liquids, but the abundance and minimal 
cost of waste oil makes this latest accomplishment particularly 
attractive.

The researchers still got 100 percent conversion of the oil even
when trace metal contaminants were present, meaning waste oil would
not need to be cleaned before use.

The results are good news for the environment as well.  Currently,
only about 30 to 40 percent of used oil is recycled; the rest is
burned or thrown away.  The new process could potentially covert all 
the unrecycled oil into useable, clean-burning hydrogen.  For 
information, call IGT at 708/768-0500.
