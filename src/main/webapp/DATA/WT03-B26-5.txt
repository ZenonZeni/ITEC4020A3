CANBERRA, Monday 25th March 1996<BR>

<B>1. INTRODUCTION<BR>
</B><BR>
The primary aim of the LAND AVHRR Workshop was to promote ideas and to break
down any real or perceived barriers between the data acquisition, modelling
and application communities.<BR>
AVHRR data were viewed in the workshop as being processed to three product
levels, these are base, standard and research products. There are several
operational environment management systems in place that rely heavily on
AVHRR data. In the workshop these applications were given the opportunity
to voice their concerns and hopes for future AVHRR processing at the three
levels above.<BR>
<BR>
From the general discussions there arose a series of common questions: 
<UL>
<LI>What generic changes can occur to the data acquisition, base and standard
product development which will mean improvements to all applications? 
<LI>What mechanisms need to be in place by the data acquisition, base and
standard product development community to ensure that the users needs are
adequately meet? Are the users needs and desires realistic and achievable?
<LI>How can the application community make better decisions from the currently
available data sets? 
</UL>
To provide a framework for readers who did not attend the workshop, the
listing of presenters is given later. Some additional copies of the workshop
proceedings are available from Tim McVicar on a first come first served
basis.<BR>
