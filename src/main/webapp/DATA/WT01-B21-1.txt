Dear Fellow Farmer,<br>
<br>
I have been trialling fibre hemp this season and am delighted to
confirm that<br>
it is a very clean and easy crop to grow. It takes about 60 days
from<br>
seeding to harvest and should yield around three tonne of milled
fibre per<br>
hectar. We are expecting to get around $700 per tonne for the
fibre. On a<br>
commercial scale we estimate that it will cost around $260 per
tonne to<br>
produce. The crop requires fertile, well drained soils and
irrigation,<br>
although the first crop received 125mm of rainfall and we only
had to apply<br>
75mm of irrigation. That means the crop requires less water than
wheat to<br>
produce a comparable yield for a product worth twice as much.<br>
<br>
We could expect to grow at least two crops per year and probably
three making<br>
it more profitable than even tobacco.<br>
<br>
We cultivated the soil to a fine seed bed and sowed on the flat.
The first<br>
crop successfully smothered all weeds including dock, summer
grass, wild<br>
raddish and Datura. A corn crop planted next to the hemp did NOT
survive the<br>
weeds.<br>
<br>
In the latter stages of growth the flower heads attracted
Heliothus<br>
caterpillars but no treatment was necessary prior to harvest.<br>
<br>
For a fast growing crop, fertiliser is essential and hemp is no
exception.<br>
<br>
We are developing a milling machine and apart from this, fibre
hemp can be<br>
cultivated and harvested with normal farm equipment.<br>
<br>
I look forward to growing this environmentally friendly and
potentially<br>
profitable crop and hope you will join me in this exciting
venture.<br>
<br>
Yours sincerely,<br>
James Davis<br>

Adrian is a professional lobbyist and was responsible for
bringing about the<br>
situation that has allowed trial permits to be issued and this
crop to be<br>
grown. He has been active in developing Australian and export
markets for<br>
hemp at varying stages of processing<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Varietal Section:<br>
<br>
Cannabis sativa is day length sensitive normally requiring 12
hours of<br>
uninterrupted darkness to initiate flowering.<br>
Five French and four Eastern European varieties were provided for
trial. The<br>
varieties were to provide a range of maturity dates.<br>
<br>

<br>
Seed thickly (50-80kg per ha) and grow to 1.5 to 3 m in height.<br>
Drill seed at 2-3cm deep and in 10-18cm rows.<br>
Sow when soil temperatures reach 18-20 degrees.<br>
<br>

We used Cannon sprinkler.<br>
<br>
Pests &amp; Disease:<br>
<br>
Caterpillars; locusts; aphids; white fly; Phytophthora; leaf
diseases; birds;<br>
rabbits; kangaroos; rodents are all pests and diseases to be
considered.<br>
<br>

<br>
Cut and windrow; leave to ret in field; bale of stock prior to
storage and<br>
delivery to factory.<br>
4-7 weeks of cutting and windrowing; 3-4 weeks of baling.<br>
<br>
Yields Estimates:<br>
<br>
5 to 20 tonnes. Average U.K. trials 10 tonne/ha.<br>
Commercial crops average 6 tonne/ha.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Achievements at &quot;The Aspens&quot;, Porepunkah.<br>
<br>
The French varieties were sown on October 28, 1995 at 80kg per ha
in a split<br>
plot randomized trial with six replicates. The second part of the
trial was<br>
sown on November 28, 1995. The four eastern European varieties
were sown in<br>
a supplementary randomised trial with three replicates.<br>
<br>
The ground was ripped rotary hoed and cultivated three weeks
prior to sowing.<br>
Two tonne/ha of lime was incorporated with 100kg of Nitrogen 40kg
of<br>
Phosphorus and 40kg of potassium as a blend of Pivot, DAP,
Ammonium Nitrate<br>
and Muriate of Potash.<br>
No herbicides were used.<br>
<br>
The crop was sown with a cone seeder (specially developed for
trials by<br>
Agriculture Victoria). Soil temperature was 14 degrees. There was
good<br>
sub-soil moisture following excellent spring rains. Fifteen mm of
irrigation<br>
was applied after seeding and germination occurred in five days.<br>
<br>
125 mm of rain fell on the crop and a further 60 mm of irrigation
was applied<br>
during December.<br>
The crop grew rapidly, achieving 5 cm per day after thirty days,
to a<br>
harvestable height of 1.8m. All weeds were suppressed by the
crop.<br>
<br>
The time of harvest was determined by flowering (a requirement of
the permit<br>
was to harvest before seedset).<br>
Ag Vic. sampled the crop at flowering for forensic analysis, the
subsequent<br>
results of which showed less than 0.3% THC.<br>
<br>
Harvesting was carried out on December 28, 1995. Because of the
plot size<br>
and split nature of the trial, brush cutters were used to fell
the crop. The<br>
produce from each plot was picked up by hand and weighed.<br>
Samples were taken for dry matter analysis and the results from
this activity<br>
used to calculate the production per hectare.<br>
<br>
There was very little difference between all of the French
varieties with<br>
some favour being attributed to Felina.<br>
Average yields were around 11 tonnes per ha of dry matter
translating to<br>
marketable commodity of seven (7) tones/ha.<br>
<br>
No significant pests or diseases were observed. Heliothus
caterpillars<br>
appeared on the flowering heads just before harvest but did not
require any<br>
treatment.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Economics per tonne per ha<br>
Grow, harvest, manage and secure $190 $1,330<br>
Harvesting &amp; Storage Cost $ 50 $ 350<br>
Total cost/ha based on 7 tonne yield $240 $1,680<br>
Farm gate price required for whole stalk $450 $3,160<br>
CULTIVATION OF FIBRE HEMP<br>
<br>
TRIALS AND TRIBULATION FOR THE CLARKE HEMP CONSORTIUM<br>
<br>
Industrial Hemp is produced from annual plant (Cannabis Sativa)
and can be<br>
processed into a number of products ranging from textiles, paper
and<br>
construction materials from the outer bark (fibre) to furniture,
paints and<br>
plastics from the hurd or core and lubricants, food and medicines
from the<br>
seed.<br>
Combinations of the whole plant can be manufactured into a mulch
mat with<br>
wide spread uses in the landscape gardening, land reclamation and
pet care<br>
industries.<br>
<br>
Although hemp has been cultivated around the world for millennia,
modern day<br>
attention to the crop has been limited to Asian and Eastern
European<br>
countries.<br>
Currently the growing of Cannabis sativa is illegal in Australia
and most<br>
other western nations with the notable exceptions of France,
Holland, England<br>
and Canada.<br>
<br>
In late 1995 the Victorian Government issued a number of permits
to various<br>
commercial and regional groups to conduct trials on the growing
of industrial<br>
hemp. Sites were chosen for their security and suitability to
hemp growing.<br>
The judgement on suitability was based on growing conditions
known to be<br>
successful overseas and in Tasmania where trials have been going
on for three<br>
years.<br>
<br>
The North East region of Victoria fits the prescribe growing
conditions so we<br>
proceeded to incorporate the crop into a summer cropping.
Following are the<br>
agronomic requirements specified for industrial hemp and our
results.<br>
<br>
Agronomic Specification for Industrial Hemp<br>
<br>
Climate &amp; Environment:<br>
Frost susceptible, high humidity increases fungal attack. Wind
and heavy<br>
rain damages crops but need moderated wind to enhance fibre
strength.<br>
Deep rooted crop-providing a good disease break and improving
soil structure.<br>
120 day crop with critical harvest period.<br>
Rabbits and insects attack Hemp.<br>
Retting required before harvest.<br>
Security required.<br>
<br>
Soils &amp; Seedbed Preparation<br>
Well drained alluvial sandy loam - pH 6.5-7<br>
High organic matter<br>
High Nitrogen demand (120 kg/ha)<br>
High Phosphorus demand in early stages (120 kg/ha)<br>
Moderate Potassium (160 kg/ha)<br>
<br>
Cultivate to a fine tilth and pre-drill fertiliser. Herbicide
usage - pre<br>
and post-emergent.<br>
