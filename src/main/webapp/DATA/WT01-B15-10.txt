<CENTER><H2>Some Positive Aspects of Privacy Law</H2>

<H3>Blair Stewart</H3>
<P>
ADVANCED SURVEILLANCE TECHNOLOGIES CONFERENCE, 
<P>
Copenhagen, 4 September 1995</CENTER>
<P>
<I>Summary of an address given by Blair Stewart, Manager, Codes and Legislation,
Office of the Privacy Commissioner, New Zealand</I>
<P>
The New Zealand Privacy Act, passed in 1993, drew upon the OECD guidelines
and learned from the experiences of European data protection laws and the
Australian Privacy Act.
<P>
The Privacy Act contains 12 information privacy principles governing the
collection, use, storage and disclosure of personal information, however the
information is held.  It also has a principle dealing with unique identifiers
and contains individual access and correction rights.
<P>
The principles cover all agencies whether in the private or public sector,
unless specifically excluded.  Very few exclusions are contained in the law.
Parliament is one. The news media in their news activities is another.  The
police are not excluded from the privacy law.
<P>
If an information privacy principle is breached, and an individual is harmed
or embarrassed as a result, a complaint to the Privacy Commissioner can be
made, a settlement sought, or damages or an injunction obtained through a
Tribunal.
<P>
The Act also contains principles for public registers and guidelines for data
matching.
<P>
The Privacy Commissioner can issue codes of practice to modify the principles
for a sector, activity or type of information.  The Commissioner is also
given the function of reporting on legislation, Government policy or new
technology, affecting the privacy of individuals.
<P>
That is a very quick overview of the Privacy Act.  More detail of the New
Zealand privacy legislation can be obtained from the Privacy Commissioner's
home page which can be found at http://www.kete.co.nz/privacy/welcome.htm.
<P>
I should emphasise that the Privacy Act that I have just described is a
broader privacy law than most other jurisdictions - Quebec, at provincial
level, being the most comparable law currently in force.  The law is broad in
two respects:<br>
  it covers both computerised information and all other "manual" data - it
would include, for instance, simple notes on a file or a photograph or video
as well as computer or manual databases;<br>
  it covers both public and private sectors - and the coverage of the private
sector is particularly important as the difference between the public and
private spheres blur.<br>
<P>
Earlier parts of this conference have focused on "cutting edge" sophisticated
surveillance and tracking technology and activities.  Although the position
can, of course, change New Zealand does not at present suffer from the
extremes earlier described at the conference.  Nonetheless, it might be
useful to mention some of the law enforcement or surveillance issues which
have interacted with our privacy law recently.  I hope to suggest that a
privacy law has a positive effect on these issues.
<P>
<H3>Complaints jurisdiction oversight</H3>

Law enforcement authorities in New Zealand became subject to a new oversight
mechanism in the form of the Privacy Commissioner when the Privacy Act was
passed. Complaints can be received in relation to information collection
activities such as questioning or strip searches, or disclosure of data
within or outside the jurisdiction.  The Privacy Act provides remedies for
individuals who have suffered some harm.  This contrasts with some of the
existing oversight mechanisms, such as the Police Complaints Authority, which
in relation to substantiated complaints are concerned with disciplining the
law enforcement officers concerned and trying to ensure that systems are in
place so as a particular problem is not repeated.  There is no focus on
individual remedy under a disciplinary system.

<H3>Drug testing</H3>

New Zealand recently enacted a Sports Drug Testing Act.  The Privacy
Commissioner provided some input into the process and, in my view, this lead
to a better law in privacy terms notwithstanding some remaining concerns at
the outcome.  However, this law is an illustration of the effect of
international agreements (whether between governments or between private
national sporting organisations) limiting a society's control over decisions
concerning the use of intrusive surveillance technology, in this case, drug
testing.  The argument is that a country might be barred from international
competition unless it institutes random drug testing.

<H3>DNA</H3>

The New Zealand Parliament is presently considering legislation to enable
suspects to be ordered by the High Court to give samples for forensic DNA
analysis for certain specified offences.  The Bill will also create a DNA
databank of profiles from certain convicted offenders.  The Privacy
Commissioner has been closely involved in the policy and legislative process
and this has led to a better bill from a privacy perspective. However, the
Commissioner retains concerns about several aspects of the bill including a
provision enabling the Police to invite individuals to "voluntarily" add
their samples to the databank.  This contrasts with the older surveillance
technology of fingerprinting in respect of which the Police have never been
permitted to "voluntarily" collect fingerprints from innocent citizens.

<H3>Code of practice for the Police</H3>

A code of practice is being developed under the Privacy Act for the Police.
The information privacy principles already apply to the Police but the code
will create a more specific set of rules for various things such as video
surveillance in public places.

<H3>Data Matching </H3>

The Privacy Act controls data matching between public agencies
in New Zealand and requires legal authorisation for each programme and a
rigorous analysis and justification in relation to a set of information
matching guidelines.  One proposal at present under consideration is to match
the electoral roll against a list of illegal immigrants.
<P>
To wrap up I would like to briefly reflect on some of the comments earlier
made by Simon Davies, Steve Wright and Stephanie Perrin.
<P>
Simon suggested that there is a need for more polemic in the privacy debate
and the data protection laws have actually seen a trading off of privacy
interests.  He suggests the need for more public militancy.  He may well be
right, but it is questionable whether a public official, such as a Privacy
Commissioner, can take the place of an informed political debate.  The New
Zealand Privacy Commissioner is required by law to take account of the public
interests that compete with privacy including the need for a free flow of
information and the ability of Government and business to operate
efficiently.  Steve Wright suggested the need for public education and
Stephanie Perrin outlined the Canadian Standards Association initiative which
might, in one sense, be categorised as industry education.
<P>
Clearly a Privacy Commissioner cannot alone adequately prevent moves toward
a surveillance society.  To do that we require a well informed and more vocal public.  We
also require Government administrators and lawmakers to be better informed on privacy
issues.  We also require business to better consider fair information practices.  All of
these ingredients are necessary.  However, a comprehensive privacy law is arguably a very good start in protecting individuals from intrusive surveillance and other privacy dangers.
