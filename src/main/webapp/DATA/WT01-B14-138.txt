<H2>Recent Warming Event in the Pacific May or May Not Be an El Ni&ntilde;o</H2>

A recent anomalous warming event in the tropical Pacific consists of a
series of intraseanal episodes, observations from four spaceborne sensors
and simulation by an ocean general circulation model show.  The figure
includes time-longitude variations, along the equator, of the 1994-1993
difference in (a) zonal wind component, (b) sea level, (c) sea surface
temperature, and (d) atmospheric water-vapor, as derived from spacebased
observations and corresponding simulation of sea level (e) and sea surface
temperature (f) by the Modular Ocean Model developed at the Geophysical
=46luid Dynamics Laboratory when forced by realistic wind.  The vertical axis
represents time in months; the horizontal axis represents longitude, 
running from Indonesia, across the Pacific, to the
Galapagos Islands.  The zonal wind component is derived from observations
by the microwave scatterometer on the European spacecraft ERS-1.  The
sea-surface height is derived from the observations by the microwave
altimeter on the joint U.S.-French Topex/Poseidon Mission.  The sea-surface
temperature is produced through optimal interpolation of data from the
Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer blended with in situ data.  The
atmospheric integrated water vapor is derived from observations by the
Special Sensor Microwave Imager. <P>
 
Along the equator, the Trade Wind usually blows from east to west and
should be negative, following our convention.  Four distinct groups of
equatorial westerly (positive) wind anomalies near the date line were
observed by the scatterometer from July through December 1994.  The wind
anomalies initiated eastward-propagating, downwelling Kelvin waves. These
waves, in turn, caused a rise in sea-level that was registered by the
altimeter. Surface-warming episodes related to the Kelvin waves were
observed by a visible-infrared radiometer.  Anomalous integrated water
vapor observed by the microwave radiometer indicate that the westerly wind
and warming episodes are also associated with enhanced atmospheric
convection.  The observed variations in sea level and sea surface
temperature anomalies agree with simulation by an ocean general circulation
model when forced by realistic winds, both in time and location but with
slightly different magnitudes. <P>
 
Unlike the El Ni&ntilde;o events of the 1980s, equatorial warming events in the
1990s are more frequent, last for shorter periods, and are less intense.
Whether the 1994 warming can be classified as an El Ni&ntilde;o is being debated.
The realistic simulation provides a theoretic link between the observed
forcing and responses and will help to further our understanding in the
interaction between the episodic changes associated with Kelvin waves and
the low-frequency changes of El Ni&ntilde;o.  <A HREF="NSCAT.html"> The NASA Scatterometer (NSCAT) Project</A> 
which is scheduled to be launched in August 1996 will provide improved wind field. <P>
