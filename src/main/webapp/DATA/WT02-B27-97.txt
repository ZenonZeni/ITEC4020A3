<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>NCTM Efforts and the Nature of Reform</H2>
<FONT SIZE=-1>Developed by <A HREF="../Students#CS">Corinne Schaeffer</A></FONT><BR>
<HR> 
In 1983, a publication titled <I>A Nation at Risk</I> sparked the efforts currently underway to improve mathematics education.  These efforts are founded in educational research committed to the idea that students learn best when they <A HREF="http://www.ncrel.org/sdrs/areas/issues/content/cntareas/math/ma3const.htm"> construct their own understanding</A>.  Effective teachers must provide an environment in which this construction can occur.<BR>
<BR>In an attempt to aid teachers in reform efforts, the <A HREF="http://www.nctm.org">National Council of Teachers of Mathematics</A> (NCTM) published the <A HREF="http://www.enc.org/online/NCTM/280dtoc1.html">Curriculum and Evaluation Standards for School Mathematics</A> in 1989 and the <I>Professional Standards for Teaching Mathematics</I> in 1991.  As stated by a former NCTM President, Mary M. Lindquist, these documents "are the map on which we chart our future course.  They guide and direct our journey as we complete our voyage of making mathematics accessible to every student."  These documents provide mathematics teachers with a vision and purpose, rather than a set curriculum, for reforming the teaching and learning of mathematics.<BR>
<BR>
More recently, the NCTM published the <I>Assessment Standards for School Mathematics</I> (1995) in order to expand on and complement the NCTM's Evaluation Standards.  All of these documents were written with the underlying assumption that <B>all</B> students are capable of learning mathematics.  As educators we must focus on facilitating student growth and comprehension rather than allowing students to avoid high levels of achievement and understanding in mathematics, which has historically been the case for a large number of people.<BR>

This document provides a very nice summary of the <I>Professional Standards for Teaching Mathematics</I>.  A good source for anyone just beginning to read about NCTM's efforts of reform.
</UL>
The nature of the mathematics classroom is changing dramatically as a result of NCTM's reform documents.  A major emphasis is moving toward problem solving, reasoning, mathematical connections, and communications, while shifting away from memorization and repetition.  Students are working together (<A HREF="../Coop/Coop.home">cooperative/collaborative learning</A>), with the teacher serving as a guide instead of a source of answers, to learn mathematics through solving problems rather than learning recipes.  A greater emphasis is being placed on using <A HREF="MathTech">technology</A> as a tool for investigating and understanding  mathematical concepts.<BR>
