<H1>Powder Finish Helps Golf Cars <BR> 
Survive the Links</H1>


<H3><I>Golf cars get longer drives, fewer chips with powder-coated
finish...</I></H3>

</CENTER>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
A golf car is subjected to  a variety of hazards that can be detrimental to its finish. Stones chip away at the protective coating, allowing rain, mud and fertilizers to attack the base metal. Long exposure to the sun's ultraviolet rays can bleach the paint. And there is always the threat of stray golf balls and hard driving by enthusiastic and sometimes frustrated golfers.<P>

  Providing a durable finish is a priority for E-Z-GO Textron, the world's
largest manufacturer of golf cars. The company, located in Augusta,
Georgia,
produces nearly 400 gas and electric vehicles per day, of which more than
320 are
golf cars. The balance is utility vehicles and personnel carriers for golf
course
maintenance and general industrial uses. In total, the company
manufactures more
than 40 types of vehicles.<P>


  To help maintain its market leadership, the company redesigned its golf
car,
with a planned introduction of January 1994. Richard Jefferies, team
leader for
process planning said, "We developed the new product from the ground up,
starting
with a universal frame for both gas and electric vehicles. At first, we
simply
were going to upgrade the finishing line 
to accommodate the new golf car. But we saw an opportunity to design a
true
world-class manufacturing 
operation."<P>


  There were several reasons to change the production line. "First, said Mr.
Jefferies, "we were already at our maximum production capacity. The new
line
could be designed to reduce material handling and speed production.
  "We also wanted better corrosion protection than we were getting. And
we were
getting close to our VOC limits. We also needed to add capacity to paint
several
different vehicles. A new painting system could be designed to meet our
future
requirements."<P>


  After reviewing different coatings, E-Z-GO chose powder coating for
both the
body panels and frames. The company selected Milbank, Kansas City,
Missouri, to
design the production line and supply the washers and ovens, and Nordson
Corporation, Amherst, Ohio, to supply the powder coating system.<P>


  Key to the new system is more than three miles of power-and-free
conveyor,
which snakes its way from fabrication to finishing to assembly. "Instead
of
manually transporting parts from the welding area to the finishing line,
we now
hang parts on the line, and they are conveyed directly through production.
With
the previous system, it took almost two days to get parts finished and to
the
assembly line. Now, finished parts get to the assembly line in about three
hours," said Mr. Jefferies.<P>


  All parts are painted with a powder primer, then a color top coat. E-Z-GO
uses
a new series of powder coatings developed by Evtech, a division of
Eastman
Chemical Company. The coatings, called the Evlast 5440 series, have an
acrylic/polyester urethane chemistry. The coatings were developed to
provide the
flexibility and weatherability required for the demanding golf car
environment.<P>


  According to Chip LaPole, E-Z-GO manufacturing engineer, the powder not
only
meets requirements for appearance and gloss, but gives a durable,
scratch-resistant finish. The requirement for the salt-spray test is 500
hrs, and
the powder exceeds 2,000 hours.<P>


  "The key to good corrosion resistance," added Mr. Jefferies, "is in the
pretreatment." All galvanized and welded parts are conveyed through a
Milbank
seven-stage washer using zinc phosphate  and chrome rinse from Novamax
Technologies. Welded parts are conveyed through a pickling solution prior
to
entering the washer.<P>


  Five Nordson Excel 2000… powder spray booths are located in two
environmentally
controlled rooms. One room contains separate booths for the primer and
black
paint; the second room has two reclaim booths and one non-reclaim booth
for
colors. The spray booths are equipped with Versa-Sprayr guns and Versa-
ScreenTM
booth and gun controls.<P>



  The booth controls monitor major operating parameters, including dew
point and
powder level. Controls trigger guns off between parts to minimize
recycling of
oversprayed powder. "The controls help us get the coverage uniformity we
need for
appearance and corrosion protection," said Mr. La Pole.<P>


  The company reclaims primer and black, which are used on the frames. It
also
reclaims the four most popular colors, which are beige, gray, white and
light
green. Other colors are sprayed to waste.<P>


  A typical color change takes about 20 min, but Mr. Jefferies said the
time is
not a major factor. "The way the production runs, we are painting in three
booths
at one time. We change color in the fourth booth while we are running
production
in the others. This makes the color-change time insignificant to
production."<P>


  E-Z-GO has realized several benefits with the new powder coating
system. "Paint
efficiency is 98 pct in the reclaim booths," said Mr. LaPole. "Even when we
factor in the non-reclaim colors, paint efficiency is 90 pct."<P>


  The powder system and new manufacturing process have reduced the
reject rate,
which has translated into labor savings. With the liquid system the
company had
five full-time employees who reworked parts. That has been reduced to
one person
who spends about six hours per day on rework. This is with a 30 pct
increase in
the number of cars produced."<P>


  There are also labor savings on the finishing line itself. The liquid line
needed 18 people to operate. The powder system needs 12 people, reducing
direct
labor by about 35 pct.<P>


  The new E-Z-GO golf car has been very successful in the marketplace,
and the
powder-coated finish is used as a selling point. Ron Skenes, manager,
marketing
services, says, "We have a new product and a new process. We promote our
golf
car's new body style, better manufacturing, 
and its longer lasting, more durable finish." <B>PF</B>
