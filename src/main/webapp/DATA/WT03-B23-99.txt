<H3><A NAME="executive">EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</A></H3> The survey involved 189 cases of alleged police mistreatment which came to the attention of community workers in various settings over a four month period in late 1991 to early 1992. The data represent one of the few examples of documentation of police complaints independent of the criminal justice system. We hope that the report and the cases presented inform the reader of some of the characteristics of police mistreatment and that they point the way forward for enhancing police complaints mechanisms and most importantly police accountability to the community they serve. <P>
<B>PURPOSE:</B> The need for this police complaints survey arises from concern within the Federation of Community Legal Centres about the nature and extent of inappropriate police practices. <P>
The report presents information on the way clients of many community agencies in Victoria experience police mistreatment. It examines details about incidents and how citizens respond in these situations as well as examining police practices and where mistreatment occurs. <P>
As there is very little independent information available about the everyday practices of Victoria Police, by taking an annual snapshot it is possible to explore the nature of police mistreatment in Victoria and highlight issues for law reform. <P>
<B>OBJECTIVES:</B> The specific objectives of this survey were: <P>
<ul>
<li>To give a voice to the concerns of citizens attending legal centres and other community agencies who have been mistreated by the police;
<li>To gather information which helps the Federation of Community Legal Centres to develop a profile of incidents of mistreatment by police;
<li>To identify trends that are occurring over the year(s) such as: <ul>
<li>the nature and extent of police mistreatment;
<li>who is mistreated;
<li>in what ways;
<li>by whom;
<li>what action is or isn't taken and what the reasons might be for such action OR inaction;</ul>
<li>To ascertain what, if any, gender, race, age or other discrimination practices are occurring;
<li>To provide a practical focus for the development of recommendations. <P></ul>
<B>INTRODUCTION:</B> This report is based on the analysis of the results of a survey distributed by participating Victorian Community Legal Centres to individuals through a network of metropolitan and country community agencies in 1991/92. It is the second report on police mistreatment undertaken by the Federation of Community Legal Centres (Vic) Inc. and is one of many reports which have been presented in Victoria in the last decade. <P>
Much of the research conducted by legal centres and other groups documents the prevalent nature of police mistreatment. <P>
The first survey (1990-91) initiated by the Federation of Community Legal Centres into police mistreatment of young people by police indicated that:
<ul><li>more than 84% of those surveyed were male,
<li>78% were from an English speaking background,
<li>51% were unemployed and
<li>7% were from a professional/non-working class background.
<li>Verbal abuse comprised 33% and physical abuse 29% of the incidents.
<li>31% of cases recorded that a police record of interview was completed
<li>34% of cases no formal police action was taken.
<li>23% were charged by summons, 18% were charged and bailed,
<li>20% were kept in cells.
<li>Some 64% of respondents indicated that they had not formally reported the incident.
<li>46% of these were either too frightened, feared reprisals, or were threatened,
<li>27% didn't know how to make a complaint, and
<li>22% believed that it would not have made any difference. </ul><P>
Of those who had reported the incident only 20% had reported to an authority officially empowered to investigate complaints of police mistreatment. <P>
Similar results were found in a Victorian Council for Civil Liberties telephone survey in 1992. <P>
Existing research also indicates that those most frequently affected are vulnerable people who have little chance of defending themselves. <P>
<ul><li>The National Inquiry into Racist Violence heard evidence that many of the attacks upon Aborigines, young and old, were perpetrated by police. <P>
<li>Research undertaken in Victoria on homeless young people reports that fortyseven per cent of females and fifty per cent of males reported being physically hurt by police. <P>
<li>A report on young people and the police found that police were more likely to be heavyhanded in their dealings with young men, Aboriginal youth and marginal youth. These groups were more likely than other youth to be stopped and spoken to by the police, taken to a police station, and to report being roughed up. <P>
<li>A report by G.L.A.D., Gay men and Lesbians Against Discrimination, describes as &quot;the most disturbing aspect&quot; of the survey they undertook, the extent to which gay men and lesbians reported harassment, discrimination and violence at the hands of the police. <P>
<li>The 1991 survey undertaken by the Federation of Community Legal Centres into police mistreatment included a number of examples of police assault on young people and sexual abuse of women. </ul>
The latest figures indicate that the number of formal complaints against the Victoria Police has risen from 1056 in 1988/89 to 4525 in 1991/92. This is an increase of 410%. in four years. There is now one complaint per year for every two sworn police officers in Victoria. </ul><P>
Victoria Police have consistently denied the legitimacy of Victorian studies which demonstrate police misbehaviour. Further to this, while police themselves have recognised that traditional policing has failed Government funding of law and order policies has increased from $M495 in 1988-89 to $M634 in 1991-92 an increase of 30% in 4 years. Concomitantly police operating budgets have become sacrosanct, the Premier, Mr Kennett, has indicated that police resources and police numbers would not be cut, despite the massive cutbacks being made to all other state funded services. <P>
The ineffectiveness of pro-active policing by traditional police forces has been fully recognised. In the 1987-88 Annual Report the Chief Commissioner openly admitted that by themselves the police were unable to reduce crime. In this regard the police have responded to growing concern about police practices, the effectiveness of policing, and police efficiency, by imposing responsibility for crime prevention on the community. While we recognise the possible benefits that can arise out of various community policing initiatives such as Neighbourhood Watch, Police Community Consultative Committees, Police in Schools and via crime prevention, the point remains that law and order responses don't work, that the police say that they don't work and therefore rather than pursue more police, more police resources, more police powers, and harsher sentencing, we must invest far more in community development. Similarly, the heavy promotion of community policing as an accountability mechanism fails to recognise the serious limits placed on community policing structures. These structures have no control over policing policy and practices and may in fact confuse accountability with public relations rather than a fundamental enhancement of police accountability. What is needed is a more rigorous analysis of police mistreatment and how police can be made accountable in their everyday practices. <P>
This report endeavours to raise for debate important issues regarding police practices in Victoria. As the Deputy Ombudsman (Police Complaints) recently suggested, the: <P>
<B>&quot;goal of any democratic community should be to have a trustworthy, professional and impartial police force....[t]he present system can be improved by [amongst other things]...most importantly, greater consideration given to the complainant's perception of the [complaints] system.&quot;(Perry,B. 1992)</B> <P>
We agree totally, this report presents the complainant's views of their experiences of police mistreatment. <P>
<B>PRINCIPLE FINDINGS:</B> The principal findings of the study have been presented under the following categories: <P>
<B>1.0 Characteristics of respondents and incidents;</B> <P>
<B>2.0 Police behaviour; and </B> <P>
<B>3.0 Details about the outcome of the incident.</B> <P>
The findings of each section are summarised as follows: <P>
<B>1.0 Characteristics of Respondents and Incidents:</B> The typical victim of police mistreatment who responded in the 1992 survey is male, and under the age of 30. He is likely to reside in the greater metropolitan area of Melbourne and not to be in the paid workforce. <P>
Over one half of respondents have been previously mistreated by the police and one third stated that they were born overseas. While language is not a problem for many respondents it affected almost half of those who indicated that they were born overseas. <P>
St Kilda, Footscray and Flemington were the most frequent locations of reported police mistreatment and the largest proportion occurred during afternoon shift. <P>
<B>2.0 Police behaviour:</B> Police mistreatment reported by respondents usually involved more than one constable or senior constable. Female police officers were involved in more incidents involving male than female respondents. Nearly half of the police officers identified themselves. One third of incidents occurred in police stations. This proportion was independent of gender, age and language preference. Women and respondents aged over 25 years were more likely to report mistreatment in their homes. <P>
Verbal and physical abuse, particularly bruising and broken bones, were the most frequently reported forms of mistreatment reported in the survey. Bruising was most frequently inflicted in police stations, at home or on the street. Incidents involving broken bones usually occurred in police stations and private houses. <P>
Most respondents say they were not informed of their right to complain about police behaviour. These numbers were highest in St Kilda, City West and Flemington police stations. This was not generally related to gender, age or language preference. <P>
<B>3.0 Details about the Outcome of the Incident:</B> 60% of respondents were charged with offences arising out of their interaction with the police and over 50% were detained in custody. Of these respondents, 60% were detained for less than 4 hours. The period of detention was greater for men than for women respondents and increased with age. Although the majority of survey respondents were male, females had been taken into custody in roughly similar proportions. <P>
Nearly 40% of respondents formally complained about their mistreatment by police. Of this 40% (N=78) some 32 (or 41%) complained to a lawyer and 22 (28%) complained to IID. The high frequency with which complaints were made to lawyers may reflect the project's auspicing by the Federation of Community Legal Centres or the lack of faith in reporting to formal established complaints mechanisms. About 70% discussed the incident in a less formal professional environment, usually with community workers. <P>
Most respondents who had not complained said they were too frightened or cynical of the consequences of their complaint. Only 14% said they did not know how to complain. There was no relationship between gender or age and respondents' reasons for not making a formal complaint. However, respondents who preferred to speak a language other than English were more likely than English speakers to say they were too frightened to make a complaint. On the other hand, English speakers were more likely to say that a complaint would not achieve anything. <P>
<B>DISCUSSION:</B> The information collected in this 1992 Federation of Community Legal Services survey accords with previous research. <P>
In particular, the survey data support assertions that those who become victims of police mistreatment are minority and powerless members of the community. 
<ul><li>Between 70% and 80% of victims are men 
<li>At least 60% of victims are aged under 30 years 
<li>Most victims are not in the workforce. About 39% are unemployed and another 30% are students or pensioners 
<li>People with non English speaking backgrounds are over represented among victims who fear to complain 
<li>Independent interpreters were not provided for 70% of victims who have difficulty with the English language 
<li>Half of the victims have been previously mistreated by police 
<li>Only 20% of victims use formal report mechanisms such as the Internal Investigations Department of Victoria Police and the Deputy Ombudsman (Police Complaints) 
<li>Fear of repercussions and cynicism about the usefulness of existing formal complaint systems are the most usual reason given for not formally reporting the incident 
<li>Up to 30% of victims were abused and detained without subsequent charges being laid. </ul>
This survey exposes these general characteristics of victims of police abuse. The data indicate that most incidents involve several uniformed police officers of constable rank and that the incidents usually occur in police stations or private homes. Mistreatment which occurs in police stations is more likely to result in physical injury, particularly bruising and broken bones. The frequency is not influenced by the victims, gender, age or language preference. In contrast, injuries inflicted at home are more likely to involve women and respondents aged over 25 years. <P>
The survey indicates that victims fear of reporting incidents through formal channels is greater in non-English speakers. There is evidence that cynicism about the formal complaints system is justified. Those who become victims of police attacks have little success in bringing those police officers involved to justice. Usually it is the word of at least one police officer against the complainant. Police culture which places a greater emphasis on &quot;sticking together&quot; is a significant factor to be reckoned with, and is a significant inhibitor to those deciding to make a complaint of police mistreatment. <P>
It could be suggested that police complaints authorities need greater input into police recruitment and training policy and investigative and punitive powers to ensure deterrent effect. There is a need for the Deputy Ombudsman's Annual Reports to explain the results of his work rather than merely report them as in his most recent Annual Report, where he took to task critics of the process for handling police complaints while offering no hints about any limitations to the current system. Clearly, there is a divergence in the ways of understanding police complaints. <P>
Community Legal Centres believe that Victorian Police have progressively become more isolated and alienated from local communities. The very nature of a very large, highly mobile and transient force is undoubtably an important factor leading to this two way split. Attempts at community police liaison and developments such as police community consultative committees (P.C.C.C.) have generally not been successful. These local committees have never possessed any real decision making powers, and on occasions have been subject to directions higher in the police force quashing local community initiatives aimed at developing local accountability. There can be no substitute for the development of real dialogue and accountability of police to their local communities. Clearly appropriate guidelines need to be established for the operation of community management structures for police. <P>
As of the present time no government in Victoria has yet addressed the widening gap between police and local communities. The future safety of our community requires a move away from police officers barricaded from the community by roller doors, high security fences, and motor vehicle windows two thirds closed. These images tell the community that the police do no trust the community and therefore are not to be trusted themselves. <P>
The development of local community management structures must not be left in the hands of the police force, but rather with the appropriate input from bodies such as the Law Reform Committees, Ethnic Communities, Womens Groups, Youth Organisations and local government to name a few of the obvious participants. <P>
More police, with more powers and more community alienating equipment is not the solution. More can be done with less in the area of Policing, what is really needed is a different style for achieving outcomes. <P>
What is required in Victoria is a radical rethink of the direction in which our police force is going and the way in which our police are held accountable to local communities. <P>
Under the current system, most complaints about police are investigated by police from the same district. Whilst the task of this report was not to collect data on police investigation of complaints, it is worth noting that the experience of Community Legal Centres indicates that often police investigate those for whom they have a direct line of responsibility. Such a system may be a convenient means of investigating complaints but it undermines any confidence or faith an individual may have, particularly if they have been strip searched, beaten, confined and subsequently threatened with reprisals if they complained about their treatment. It is imperative that a broad based, impartial, independent and well resourced police complaints mechanism be established. <P>
This survey indicates that community workers are more likely than the formal complaint system to receive complaints. Community Legal Centre workers have assisted clients who have been mistreated, falsely charged or harassed in making a complaint against police. However it is not unusual for the lawyer to advise the client against complaining given the implications for pre-trial negotiations for the current matter and the possibility of future harassment. The police and the Government seem unable to understand that the real issue underlying the low formal complaint rate of victims is distrust and fear of those to whom they must complain rather than unwillingness to complain per se. Therefore it is crucial that development of any new police complaints system include full community consultation. <P>
Beyond this, there are also ways in which the Government can enhance accountability simply and efficiently such as through the development of an independent community visitors scheme with powers to randomly visit police stations, to protect the rights of individuals in custody is urgent. The establishment of independent community visitors schemes covering all police stations in Victoria is in the interests of the police, members of the public taken into police custody, and the Victorian community in general. An adaptation of the community visitors scheme which has operated in some psychiatric institutions could occur. <P>
An added benefit of such an approach if properly implemented is that of making the police directly accountable to the community that they are serving. Such measures have already been implemented in some parts of England. <H3><A NAME="recommendations">RECOMMENDATIONS</A><!--RECOMMENDATIONS --></h3>
