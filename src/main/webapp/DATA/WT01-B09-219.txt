<B>I would also like to take this opportunity to wish you the happiest of holiday seasons. I would also like to take the opportunity to spend it with MY family. So for the next two or three weeks, I may not be able to respond to all but the most urgent mail.</B> <p>The response to the ARHC WWW has been overwhelming. People from virtually every country have visited. The site averages over 3,000 visits per week! Many visitors seek additional information and send an email. Unfortunately as the volume of email continues to grow, my ability to provide updates and additional articles has been limited. In order to maintain the quality of this site, I must continue to invest the time to keep its content fresh. Unfortunately that limits my ability to respond to each and every email message. If you have not read Miracle Babies Online or used our ARHC WWW search form, please try that before sending an email. <p>
