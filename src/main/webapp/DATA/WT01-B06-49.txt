<STRONG>Thanks for your interest in Computerized Investing!</STRONG><P>
Within our AAII Web site you will find selected articles from our magazine
Computerized Investing (CI), published six times a year by the American
Association of Individual Investors. Following are just some of the CI
highlights that you can look forward to if you subscribe to CI .<P>

<STRONG>Feature Articles and Spreadsheet Programs</STRONG><P>

CI includes in-depth articles and spreadsheet templates that focus on
techniques of computer-assisted investment analysis and portfolio management.
Past topics have included stock screening and valuation, developing a neural
network-based trading system, selecting an on-line information service, and
evaluating mutual fund performance.<P>

<STRONG>Evaluations and Product Comparison Tables</STRONG><P>

Each issue carries detailed reviews and comparisons of investment software
and financial databases. Reviewers examine the strengths and weaknesses of the
products, and rate them on performance, usefulness, documentation, ease of use
and value. Designed as a buyer's guide, comparison tables present the programs
available for a specific investment function and analyze the differences among
them. Past comparisson tables have looked at technical analysis, portfolio
management, on-line services and on-line brokers.<P>

<STRONG>Product Discounts and Free Software</STRONG><P>

We carry frequent announcements of discounts that software vendors offer to
our subscribers. In addition, we distribute, at low cost, a variety of public
domain and shareware software that you will find on our web site and our AOL
forum.<P>
<STRONG>Online Offerings</STRONG><P>

AAII offers a forum here on the World Wide Web and an additional area on
America Online that contain a historical database of articles from CI and the
AAII Journal. Our on-line reference shelf provides listings of investment
information sources and a survey of discount brokers.We will build a software
download area, a message topic that will allow you to talk with other on-line
investors, and hope to enhance your overall investment experience by offering
some helpful investment links.<P>

<STRONG>Guide to Computerized Investing</STRONG><P>

As part of your subscription you will receive our guide book to using your
computer in the investment selection and management process. This book will
focus on selecting and using portfolio management programs, stock screening
databases, technical analysis packages, and on-line services. In addition to the
book, we are working on an interactive CD ROM that will cover more programs and
offer a description of over 500 programs and a demo of the program for many
products listed. The CD will sell for $14.95 for members and $19.95 to
non-members.<P>

<STRONG>Local Computer User Groups</STRONG><P>

In many metropolitan areas computer-user groups meet regularly to exchange
ideas and often demonstrate the practical use of investment software, data
services, and new computer hardware. A list of these groups appears on the back
cover of each issue of CI.<P>

<STRONG>Back Issues</STRONG><P>

Most back issues are available at a cost of $5 each and can be ordered using
the business reply envelope in any issue of CI. To help you find articles of
interest, the year's last regular issue contains a two-year index of articles.<P>

Once again, thanks for your interest in Computerized Investing and hopefully
you will find it a useful addition to your investment management program.<P> 
Sincerely,<P>
