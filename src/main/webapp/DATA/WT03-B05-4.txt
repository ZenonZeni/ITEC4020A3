India: Solanki offers to resign AICC post

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 13, Col. d

From Our Special Correspondent

NEW DELHI, Sept. 26.

The  AICC general secretary, Mr. Madhavsinh Solanki,  today  took
the lead among the AICC office-bearers by offering to resign from
his post to enable the new party president, Mr. Sitaram Kesri, to
reconstitute  the AICC. According to sources, in a  brief  letter
addressed to the newly-appointed Congress president, Mr.  Solanki
has offered to demit office to enable Mr. Kesri to choose his own
team of office-bearers.

Mr.  Solanki's  offer  is bound to put  pressure  on  other  AICC
office-bearers to follow suit though all indications are that Mr.
Kesri has no intention at this juncture to reshuffle the AICC.
Another  general  secretary, Mr. Devendra Dwivedi,  had  gone  on
record  that the new president should have a free hand to  choose
his  own  secretariat. The observation of Mr.  Dwivedi  triggered
speculations that the AICC general secretaries may resign.
But the issue did not figure at the first formal meeting  between
the general secretaries and Mr. Kesri earlier in the day. Neither
any  of the general secretaries nor Mr. Kesri made any  reference
to the subject.

In  the course of the meeting the general  secretaries  discussed
the  issue  of  rescheduling  of  the  organisational  elections.
Immediately  after  the  appointment  of Mr.  Kesri  as  the  new
president,  the Congress represented to the  Election  Commission
seeking  extension  of  time till February end  to  complete  the
organisational elections.

Sri Lanka: 100 LTTE cadres killed in fighting

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 13, Col. d

From Amit Baruah

COLOMBO, Sept. 26.

At  least  100 LTTE cadres were killed and scores of  Sri  Lankan
soldiers feared dead or wounded as the Tigers and the Army fought
their most fierce battles in the Vanni mainland during the  five-
day-old Operation Sath Jaya-III (True Victory-III) today.
A  military source said that the security forces, who claimed  to
have repulsed a massive LTTE counter-attack this morning west  of
Paranthan, had the bodies of some 100 Tigers in their possession.
Apparently, the security forces have also taken heavy casualties.
No details were, however, available of military dead or  wounded.
The Defence Ministry here maintained total silence on the  course
of fighting this morning.

An  official release merely said this morning:  "Latest  reports
indicate  that  the terrorists had launched  a  massive  counter-
attack during the very early hours of September 26 on the  troops
advancing  along the western flank. This counter-attack has  been
repulsed very effectively causing very heavy casualties among the
terrorists."

Earlier,  the military claimed that it continued to advance  both
east  and west of Paranthan in the Vanni mainland  amidst  fierce
resistance  from  LTTE cadres as 13 soldiers and 30  Tigers  were
killed in the last 24 hours.

"On  the  western  flank,  troops  captured  an  important  road
junction  by  the afternoon of September 26.  Terrorists  offered
heavy  resistance during this confrontation prior to the  capture
of the road junction," the Defence Ministry said in a statement.
According  to  the  release,  Sri  Lankan  troops,  after  having
captured  the Murasumoddai area east of Paranthan,  had  advanced
one more kilometre.

Meanwhile, the LTTE denied Government statements regarding  Tiger
casualties.  "There is no truth to the Sri  Lankan  Government's
claim  that  its troops have either killed or  wounded  100  LTTE
fighters on Tuesday..." the Tigers said.

According  to a Tiger release from London, the "actual  number"
of LTTE fighters killed in battle between Sunday and Tuesday  was
26.  Fourteen cadres were killed on Sunday, three on Tuesday  and
nine on Wednesday.

The  Tigers  also alleged that five persons were  killed  and  15
wounded  when  Sri Lanka Air Force (SLAF) aircraft  "attacked  a
large  crowd  of fleeing civilians"  moving  from  Puthumurippu,
Kilinochchi, yesterday.

India: Strategy for last phase of Jammu & Kashmir polls

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 13, Col. c

From Our Special Correspondent

DODA, Sept. 26.

A  strategy has been worked out to ensure orderly,  peaceful  and
free  and  fair  elections  for the rest of the  six  out  of  87
Assembly  constituencies of Jammu and Kashmir in the  fourth  and
final phase of elections.

This is keeping in view the increasing number of bomb explosions,
attacks on the lives of candidates of pro-India political parties
and  their activists currently engaged in electioneering in  Doda
district to disrupt the conduct of elections on September 30. The
district is most prone to militant violence.

According  to  official sources, Army jawans  and  officers  will
command  and direct anti-militant operations in  the  mountainous
district  of  Doda spread over 11,600 sq. km. The  BSF  has  been
asked to continue anti-militant operations in close  coordination
with  the Army. But the maintenance of law and order will be  the
sole  responsibility of the State law and order  authorities  who
have  already  got deployed more than 500 companies of  the  BSF,
CRPF,  ITBP  and the Jammu and Kashmir Armed  Police.  They  will
provide  security cover to candidates and their  activists,  poll
conducting officers and all polling booths.

The Hindu-Editorial: Towards justice in Bosnia: "It is in the interest of
the former belligerents (in the Bosnian war) to have those guilty (of war
crimes) convicted" and to get rid of "these embarrassing figures"

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 12, Col. c

By Vaiju Naravane

THE  war  in  the  former  Yugoslavia,  a  particularly  barbaric
conflict,  lasted  from  1991 to 1995 and  claimed  an  estimated
100,000  lives. Thousands of people both Serbs and  Muslims  were
tortured  or  detained in concentration camps,  women  were  mass
raped  and an estimated half a million people were driven out  of
their  homes.  In  1993  the  United  Nations  Security   Council
established  the International Criminal Tribunal for  the  former
Yugoslavia in an attempt to punish the Serbs, Muslims and  Croats
guilty of the worst atrocities. So far the Tribunal has  indicted
75 persons of war crimes and crimes against humanity. Of these 51
are  Bosnian  Serbs. These include the Bosnian Serb  leader,  Mr.
Radovan  Karazdic  and General Ratko Mladic who  are  accused  of
having  ordered, the massacres in Srebrenica where  an  estimated
5000  Muslims  were  killed. In addition Mr.  Karazdic  and  Gen.
Mladic  are  charged with genocide and  crimes  against  humanity
arising   from  atrocities  perpetrated  against   the   civilian
population  in  Bosnia-Herzegovina,  for  the  sniping   campaign
against  civilians  in  Sarajevo  and  for  the  taking  of  U.N.
peacekeepers as hostages and their use as human shields.
The President of the International Criminal Tribunal, Dr. Antonio
Cassese, an eminent Italian jurist, spoke to The Hindu on how the
tribunal has gone about its tasks and the problems it has  faced.
Excerpts from the interview:

The  Hindu:  This is the second time since World War II  that  an
international court has been set up to try war criminals. What is
the difference between this tribunal and that of Nuremberg?
Mr. Antonio Cassese: There are several differences. At  Nuremberg
you  had what has been called Victors' Justice. We  are  carrying
out  Victims' Justice. We can do this because this Court  is  not
the  projection of the four great powers which won the war as  in
the  case  of  Nuremberg,  but  the  expression  of  the   entire
international community. Of the 11 judges, only two are European.
The  others come from countries as far flung as Australia,  Costa
Rica,  China or Canada. The Nuremberg judges were  nominated.  We
were elected by the international community.

Secondly,  the  Nuremberg  court was set up at a  time  when  the
victors  had  total power and control over defeated  Germany  and
judges only had to demand documents or summon witnesses for it to
be done. This court was set up by the U.N. Security Council  when
the war was still going on. Since we don't have a judicial police
we  have to rely on the justice ministries and police  forces  of
the nations concerned to obtain evidence.

The  final difference with Nuremberg is that those  sentenced  by
this  court can appeal. For us a fair trial has become  something
of  an  obsession.  I always say that it is in  the  interest  of
Radovan  Karazdic  and Ratko Mladic to stand trial  because  they
will  be  assured of a fair trial and if they are  innocent  they
will be acquitted.

What are the instruments at your disposal?

We  don't have the kind of marvellous documentary evidence  which
was available to the Nuremberg prosecutors where every order  was
sent  in  quintuplicate. For certain crimes  committed  in  1990,
1991,  1992,  for  instance  in the case  of  mass  rape,  it  is
difficult  to gather direct medical evidence. Our  investigations
are therefore conditioned by the type of evidence we are seeking.
With little documentary evidence available we rely, above all, on
eyewitness  accounts. But often people who have witnessed  crimes
are  afraid  to testify because of possible  repercussions.  Fear
prevents  many  from coming forward. We do not have the  kind  of
eyewitness  protection programmes which exist in the U.S. We  can
protect  our  witnesses  only when they are here  in  Holland  by
disguising their voices or keeping their identities secret. I  am
now trying to set up a network of Non-Governmental  Organisations
which can help eyewitnesses before and after they testify. So  it
is very difficult to gather proof.

Of  the  75 persons accused of war crimes and/or  crimes  against
humanity only eight have been brought before the Court. How  does
the Court intend to see that justice is done?

Not  all  those  who  have been  arrested  are  minor  criminals.
Blaskic,  for  instance, is a general in the Croatian  army.  The
prosecutor  is  going  ahead with investigations and  no  one  is
excluded even at the highest levels. Secondly, we have invented a
special  procedure called Article 61, by which there will  be  no
trial  or  sentencing in absentia. Under this  procedure,  if  an
accused  fails  to  appear before the court,  we  call  upon  the
prosecutor  to  make  not  just the  charges,  but  the  evidence
gathered  against them public. Against Karazdic, for instance  we
have  the testimony of a Muslim who remained buried under a  heap
of bodies at Srebrenica. And we can make this evidence public. If
a  three-judge bench decides that the proof  presented  indicates
that the accused may have committed the crimes, an  international
warrant  is  issued via Interpol for the person's  capture  which
goes out to 200 countries around the world. And then we address a
letter  to  the head of the U.N. Security  Council  naming  those
States which have offered them protection or shelter. Last week I
sent  a  letter  to the U.N. Security Council  stating  that  the
Republic  of Croatia and the Bosnian Croat Federation had  failed
to arrest Ivica Rajic, a Bosnian Croat military leader. The  same
is true in the case of Karazdic and Mladic. The Security  Council
took  note of my letter and condemned the Governments  concerned.
Over a period of time such initiatives have a cumulative effect.
Who can arrest these criminals?

The  Dayton  accords have strengthened the Court.  They  make  it
binding   upon  the  Republika  Srpska  and   the   Bosnian-Croat
Federation  to cooperate with us and to give free access  to  our
investigators. This obligation has only been partly observed.  In
addition,  Article  9 of the accords forbids  anyone  accused  or
indicted by the Court to hold appointed or elected public office.
This  is  the  case of Karazdic. Croatia has now  adopted  a  law
calling  for cooperation with the Court and convinced Blaskic  to
appear  before the court. Drazen Erdemovic (charged with  killing
hundreds   of  unarmed  Bosnian  Muslims,  after  the   fall   of
Srebrenica)  was handed over by Belgrade. So something has  moved
since Dayton. The States concerned tend to look upon the  handing
over  of  their  citizens  as  extradition.  We  say  it  is  not
extradition, it is surrender. Last May we signed a memorandum  of
understanding  with NATO under which NATO forces have the  right,
not  the  duty,  but  the right,  to  arrest  these  alleged  war
criminals.  But NATO forces cannot easily arrest  these  accused,
who  always go about heavily armed or protected, without  risking
innocent human lives. And this I understand.

Prosecutor  Richard  Goldstone  (South  Africa)  left  the  Court
accusing  NATO  of "pusillanimity" for not  having  helped  you
complete your work. Do you share this view?

IFOR  or the U.N. implementation force has been in existence  for
the  past  nine months. And their mandate, which depends  on  the
politicians,  has  not  been revised or updated.  However,  I  am
confident  and  optimistic that the next few months  will  see  a
change.  This  view is based on several factors  including  talks
with relevant people. But I cannot tell you more.

I  would  want to see the arrest of all the big fish -  not  just
Karazdic  and Mladic. And I say that the arrest of  these  people
will have a salutory effect even on the peace process.

Will it be difficult to prove their responsibility?

Many  of these leaders never gave written orders. So  documentary
evidence,  unlike in the Nazi trials, is hard to find. But  there
is the concept of command responsibility or the responsibility of
the commanders, that is to say, besides the military  commanders,
the  heads of state or government who could be held  responsible.
They  could  be  accused  of crimes  of  commission  or  even  of
omission,  of  having failed to punish those  who  committed  the
crimes.  And it is here that the evidence produced at the  trials
of the small fry becomes important. This is how we can  construct
the  pyramid which leads to the very top. It will take us a  long
time, at least five to seven years to complete our work.
How do you respond to affirmations that the arrest of Karazdic or
Mladic will get the war going again?

This was true before the elections. I believe that the  elections
will  bring about a stabilisation of the political situation  and
perhaps  even  an  attempt at integration. I feel it  is  in  the
interest  of the various former belligerents to have  the  guilty
convicted by our Tribunal, to apportion blame, to rid  themselves
of  these  embarrassing  figures. It will be  in  their  economic
interest to do so because donor States could make development aid
conditional  to  the  resolution of this question.  Even  if  the
arrest of these figures leads to minor tension or friction in the
short run, it is better this way than to have war later on, since
most   of  the  persons  indicted  for  war  crimes   are   ultra
nationalists.

The Hindu-Editorial: A challenging Task

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 12, Col. b

DESPITE  THE  SHORTFALL it experienced in  raising  the  targeted
internal  and  extra budgetary resources (IEBR) in  1995-96,  the
Karnataka  Government  has opted for a 40 per cent  rise  in  its
Annual  Plan outlay for 1996-97 at Rs. 4,360 crores.  Apparently,
the overall performance of the State's economy has encouraged the
Government to take an optimistic view on the prospect of  raising
IEBR  to the tune of Rs. 1,000 crores. The growth rate  in  State
domestic  product (SDP) is expected to go up to 5.3 per  cent  in
1995-96  from 4.8 per cent in 1994-95. Although its  debt  burden
stood at a staggering Rs. 8,704 crores at the end of 1994-95, the
State's  record in debt servicing has been fairly impressive.  As
the  ratio of interest payments to the State's  revenue  receipts
was about 10 per cent, the Government appears to be confident  of
its ability to raise both internal and extra budgetary resources.
The  step up in the Plan outlay calls for a budgetary support  of
Rs.   3,359.45  crores,  a  daunting  task  indeed.  As   Central
assistance and market borrowings have more or less been pegged by
the  Planning  Commission, the Government has to strive  hard  to
make  good  the shortfall by tapping its  internal  and  external
budgetary resources.

The  State Plan for 1995-96 was set at Rs. 3,575 crores, but  the
Government  stepped  up the outlay to Rs.  3,758.28  crores.  The
revised  Plan  called  for a budgetary support  of  Rs.  2,903.29
crores and mobilising IEBR of Rs. 854.99 crores. Following a huge
shortfall in the IEBR, the Government had to cut the Plan size to
Rs.  3,100  crores. The budgetary support also had to  be  scaled
down to Rs. 2,675.78 crores. Although some buoyancy was marked in
the tax and non-tax revenue receipts, the actual mobilisation  of
resources  fell far short of the targets. Failure of  monsoon  in
the  catchment  area hit the hydel power  generation  stations  -
Karnataka relies largely on hydel power - obliging the Government
to  raise  its  budgetary support to the power  sector  from  Rs.
220.84   crores  to  Rs.  344.51  crores.  The  resource   crunch
inevitably  led to scaling down the outlay on the  energy  sector
from  Rs.  689.06  crores  to  Rs.  515.98  crores.  The   actual
mobilisation of IEBR at Rs. 424.22 crores was barely half of  the
budgeted  estimate. Even as Karnataka claims to have the  highest
per  capita  Plan  expenditure, the shortfall  in  the  budgetary
support   in  funding  last  year's  Plan  had  undoubtedly   hit
developmental projects in the priority sectors.

As  the infrastructure projects claim a lion's share of the  Plan
outlays,  the Government has taken initiative to tap the IEBR  to
implement  them.  The  recent revision of  the  power  tariff  is
expected  to yield about Rs. 400 crores to the State  electricity
board.  The Krishna Bhagya Jala Nigam has yielded Rs. 300  crores
and the Government appears to be confident of raising another Rs.
200  crores for the Upper Krishna Project (UKP) for  which  World
Bank assistance was expected earlier. With the Central assistance
pegged  around Rs. 378 crores, the State Government hopes  to  be
able to raise about Rs. 59 crores under different programmes. But
it is the irrigation sector that claims a major share of the Plan
outlay.  As the State is under considerable pressure with  regard
to  the  deadline to utilise the Krishna waters,  the  irrigation
sector  has  been  allocated  Rs.  1,168  crores.  The   proposed
expenditure of Rs. 1,000 crores on the UKP and Rs. 300 crores  on
the Cauvery basin project has far reaching political implications
for  the State. The increase in the size of the  district  sector
plan  to Rs. 732 crores from Rs. 620 crores  envisages  increased
responsibilities  for the Taluk panchayats in  rural  development
projects. Given its acute infrastructural problems, it remains to
be  seen whether Karnataka has learnt its lessons  in  mobilising
resources  and implementing its ambitious Plan without  cost  and
time over-runs.

The Hindu-Editorial: Arbitrary exercise of power

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 12, Col. a

THE  SUPREME  COURT'S  strictures  on  the  former  Minister   of
Petroleum and Natural Gas, Mr. Satish Sharma, on his  "arbitrary
and  mala fide" orders of allotment of 15 petrol pumps not  only
reveal a shocking state of affairs governing the conduct of  some
public  functionaries in the discharge of their duties  but  also
expose the role played by them in distributing favours to all and
sundry  including friends, thereby violating all norms of  decent
public behaviour. Mr. Satish Sharma was one of those high profile
Ministers  who was considered a blue-eyed boy of the  late  Prime
Minister,  Rajiv  Gandhi, and was therefore in a position  to  do
whatever  he liked without being questioned. The allotment of  15
petrol pumps on the face of it is but a very small affair and yet
it  would  only show to what depths a Minister could  descend  in
using  his powers. Mr. Sharma could not have made any profit  out
of  these  transactions considering the fact that they  were  all
given  to  the relatives of Ministers and officials. And  it  was
precisely  keeping  this  fact  in mind  the  Supreme  Court  had
observed  that  no public servant could arrogate to  himself  the
power to act in a manner which was arbitrary.

There  was no doubt that the allocation was absolutely  arbitrary
in  nature  because no attempt was made to fix any  criteria  nor
were  particular rules and regulations governing such  allocation
observed  at all. Which in effect meant that the former  Minister
went about this business as if he was dealing with a matter which
had  no public ramifications and that the departments  under  him
were  treated  as his private domain where his will was  law.  It
goes  to  the credit of the Supreme Court that it had  come  down
heavily on the misuse of his powers in the field of  distribution
of  Government  wealth in various forms. The problem  of  ethical
conduct  for public functionaries, in fact, arises by  virtue  of
the power and influence they command and the commitment they have
to undertake of loyal and disinterested service to the public. If
on the other hand every public functionary at all levels begin to
feel that they have a right to use their powers either to  enrich
themselves  or  their close associates, the  administration  will
crumble.

The  Ministers  do have certain discretionary  powers  which  are
given  to them on practical considerations, to  avoid  procedural
delays and to achieve quick action by cutting red tape. These are
laudable objectives but it also means that such powers should  be
used  in  a  manner  totally consistent  with  the  values  of  a
democratic regime. It is often said that ethics in Government can
be no better than they are in society, that it is a reflection of
the values set within the community. This is taking an  extremely
cynical  view  of the real issue involved.  Public  functionaries
like  Ministers who claim to represent the people at large  could
well set the tone for the rest of the society. Lack of  integrity
and  probity  in  the discharge of public duties  and  the  utter
disregard  for  social  responsibility by  persons  in  authority
should  be effectively dealt with in the interests of creating  a
just  society in which every person enjoys the right to  equality
of  opportunity.  Mr. Satish Sharma must pay the  price  for  his
indiscretion.  The Supreme Court has pronounced its  verdict  and
the  question is whether Mr. Sharma has any chance of  explaining
his  conduct  in defence of his actions which have been  held  as
"utter  violation  of the law laid down by this Court  and  have
also  infracted  Article 14 of the  Constitution."  This  aspect
deserves  a deeper consideration especially when  the  allotments
are  stated to be within the category of "discretionary  quota"
given to the Minister as distinct from discretionary powers which
in  any case would have to be exercised in a  strictly  judicious
manner.

Heritage Day observed sans rancour in South Africa

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 11, Col. b

From M. S. Prabhakara

CAPE TOWN, Sept. 26.

The observance of Heritage Day (also known as Shaka Day,  marking
the anniversary of the assassination of King Shaka), which is one
of the 12 national holidays in the new South Africa, on  Tuesday,
was  notable  for the absence of rancour and  controversies  that
marked its observance in 1994 and 1995.

In  1994, the controversies arising out of the decision  of  King
Goodwill Zwelithini to invite the President, Mr. Mandela, for the
event  without routing that invitation through  his  `traditional
Prime  Minister' Dr Mangosuthu Buthelezi, marked the  open  split
between  the King and his kinsman, introduced a new element  into
the  fractured  and  tension-ridden  politics  of  KwaZulu-Natal,
further  embittering  relations all around. Following  this  open
confrontation  and  some ugly incidents, Mr. Mandela  decided  to
stay away from the ceremonies.

Last  year,  the King, now more alienated from his  kinsman  than
ever,  decided  not  to  take part  in  the  public  observances.
Addressing  a rally at Stanger in KwaZulu-Natal on that  day,  Dr
Buthelezi  said that the day would be remembered in  history  `as
the  day of the Zulu covenant'. "We are now moving  towards  our
liberation as one nation with one kingdom and one purpose.  Today
is  the  day of unity and the beginning of our  liberation,"  he
said.

On Tuesday, however, the King shared the stage at the King's park
stadium  in  Durban with the Premier of the  province,  Dr  Frank
Mdalsose  (who is also the National Chairman of the IFP) and  Mr.
Jacob  Zuma of the ANC. Observers believe that this marks  a  new
and more positive stage in the relations between the King and the
IFP. In the province itself, the relations between the leadership
of the IFP (which leads the coalition government) and the ANC  (a
junior partner) have been more visibly amiable for some time.
The highlight of the Heritage Day celebrations was the  unveiling
of  a memorial to Enoch Mankayi Sontonga, the composer  of  Nkosi
Sikelel  Africa  (God  Bless Africa), the moving  anthem  of  the
liberation movement, at the Bramfontein cemetery in  Johannesburg
by  Mr.  Mandela.  Mr.  Mandela  also  conferred  the  Order  for
Meritorious Service, Gold Class on the composer and presented the
award to Santonga's granddaughter; and named a park and street in
the vicinity of the cemetery after Enoch Santonga.

Little  is  known  about  Enoch  Santonga  though  his  song   is
universally  recongised by the African people on  the  continent,
and not merely in South Africa. Indeed, the anthem invokes divine
blessing on the continent and its people, and transcends national
identies; and is acknowledged and sung in many African  countries
as an anthem of struggle.

Sontonga  who was a priest and teacher died unhonoured  nearly  a
century  ago and buried in an unmarked grave.  Burial  registers,
where  he is identified only by his first name with  the  further
information that he was a `kaffir' (the pejorative term by  which
both the segregationist British colonial rulers and the apartheid
regime  which  further  refined on  its  predecessors'  cruelties
referred to the black people), record that he was buried on April
19  1905;  and  that he was 32 years of age at the  time  of  his
death.  Extensive  research undertaken after the  country  became
free  succeeded in locating the unmarked grave in the  segregated
section  of the cemetery. Indeed, this feature of  spatially  and
racially segregated burial sites is likely to continue in the new
South  Africa  far into the foreseeable future  even  though  the
Separate  Amenities Act and all other apartheid legislation  have
been scrapped.

India: Pak. trained ultra held

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 9, Col. b

From Our Staff Reporter

NEW DELHI, Sept. 26.

The  Special  Cell of the Delhi police claimed to  have  arrested
Kuldeep  Singh  alias Bitta alias Chaudhary,  a  Pakistan-trained
militant  belonging  to  the Khalistan  Commando  Force  (Panjwar
group) from a hotel in Paharganj. Kuldeep had come to the Capital
to  strike  here and eliminate important people. Nearly 3  kg  of
RDX, two timers and two detonators were recovered from him,  said
the police.

Addressing a press conference here today, the Deputy Commissioner
of  Police (Special Cell), Mr. B. S. Bhola, the suspect had  been
assigned  the task of killing moderate Akali leaders,  especially
Mr.  Prakash Singh Badal and those involved in the November  1984
riots.  Acting  on  this  information,  the  police  stepped   up
vigilance  and  started  checking hotels  and  guest  houses  and
managed to arrest Kuldeep.

During  interrogation Kuldeep told the police that  the  militant
leaders  like  Paramjeet Singh Panjwar, Lakhbir  Singh  Rode  and
Wadhwa  Singh  were  under tremendous  pressure  from  the  Inter
Sevices Intelligence of Pakistan to indulge in a major strike  in
India.  To  step up action, various Sikh  militant  organisations
have  come together and working under close cooperation with  the
Kashmiri militants including Lashkar-e-Toiba of Pakistan.
Mr.  Bhola said Kuldeep had entered India through  Chammb-Jhorian
border  in  Jammu  region in August 1996 with 10 kg  of  RDX,  10
timers and 10 detonators. The material was buried under sand near
Akhnorr  border  on the Indian side and he was asked  to  get  in
touch with other activists and establish hideouts for himself  in
Punjab  and Delhi. He was directed by Paramjeet to check in  some
hotel in Delhi and inform him about his location so that he could
direct other militants.

Kuldeep  had  been asked by Paramjeet to conduct a recce  of  the
vital installations, residences of the VIPs and those involved in
November 1984 riots. Mr. Bhola said Kuldeep had gone to Sofia  in
Bulgaria in 1990 on a genuine passport. From Sofia he shifted  to
Germany  and  subsequently to Belgium in search of job.  Here  he
came  in  contact with Prasan Singh, president  of  International
Sikh Youth Forum who motivated him to join the movement.
Mr.  Bhola  said he was sent to Pakistan in June 1992 on  a  fake
passport along with Sukhvinder Singh and Surjeet Singh Bhalla. At
Lahore  they were received by the Pak ISI agents and Bhai  Nishan
Singh  of KCF (Panjwar). Kuldeep Singh was imparted three  months
training  from June 10 1993 to August 30, 1993 in "Ilaka  Gair"
along  with 25 other activists. They were trained in handling  of
assault  rifles, pistols, LMG niper rifle, rocket  launchers  and
other explosives.

India: Malabar varsity to be called Kannur University

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 6, Col. d

From Our Special Correspondent

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM, Sept. 26.

The Malabar University's name was changed to Kannur University by
the Assembly this evening.

An official amendment moved by the Education Minister, Mr. P.  J.
Joseph,  for the purpose at the fag end of the discussion on  the
Bill  lead  to  noisy scene in the  House,  with  the  Opposition
registering its strong protest.

The  UDF members alleged that the change was being made  with  an
eye  on  the impending Thalassery byelection in which  the  Chief
Minister,  Mr.  E. K. Nayanar, is a contestant and  that  it  was
against the guidelines of the Election Commission. They said that
the  Education  Minister's  failure to disclose  at  the  Subject
Committee meeting that there was such a move was an insult to its
members and the House at large.

They alleged that it was also part of a move by the Government to
appropriate the parentage of the law. They asserted that whatever
the  Gvoernment  did,  the Bill would remain a  creation  of  the
previous  UDF  Government and its Education Minister, Mr.  E.  T.
Mohammed Basheer.

The ruling LDF, however, strongly defended the change saying  the
name  Malabar University was inappropriate for a university  with
jurisdiction  over only two districts and a taluk of the  Malabar
area.

They  also said that the Government did not need such as  gimmick
to ensure Mr. Nayanar's victory from Thalassery and that he would
win by a handsome margin anyway.

The  Education Minister too stoutly defended the name change.  He
said the name Malabar University was inappropriate as only two of
the  nine  taluks  of  the  old  Malabar  area  came  under   the
University.  Besides,  the old Kannur district consisted  of  the
area now brought under the University.

Mr.  Joseph also claimed to have held informal discussions  about
the  name  change at the Subject Committee meeting and  with  the
leaders of the Opposition parties. He added that the present Bill
was  more  democratic than the one drafted by  the  previous  UDF
Government.  The present law provided for election of members  to
the  various  University  bodies unlike the  earlier  Bill  which
envisaged nomination.

The Opposition, however, insisted on division and the name change
was accepted by the House by 63 votes to 34.

The Hindu-Editorial: Central Asia eyes Afghan corridor

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 13, Col. e

From C. Raja Mohan

TASHKENT (Uzbekistan), Sept. 26.

Five  years after emerging as an independent nation,  Uzbekistan,
the  largest of the Central Asian republics, is striving hard  at
gaining  access to the sea. The quest for a reliable corridor  to
the  outside  world  has begun to influence  the  foreign  policy
thrust of the Uzbek Government here, most notably in Afghanistan.
Uzbekistan hopes that peace in Afghanistan will open a gateway to
the Indian Ocean through Pakistan.

As the land-locked Central Asian Republics struggle to  integrate
themselves into the world economy, the search for access roads to
the  sea has become one of the most important preoccupations  for
the  newly-independent  nations. Whether it is to  transport  the
abundant  oil  and natural gas riches of the region or  to  build
strong trade links with the rest of the world, securing  reliable
access lines to the sea has become vital for Central Asia.
The  problem  is  most  acute for  Uzbekistan  that  is  "double
landlolcked." It has to go through at least two countries before
touching  any  sea  port. On the  northern  side,  Uzbekistan  is
bounded by Kazhakstan and Russia. To the West, Uzbekistan has  to
pass  through Turkmenistan, the Caspian Sea - which is  itself  a
landlocked water body - and the Caucasus before it can reach  the
Black  Sea.  To  the East it has to  go  through  Tajikistan  and
traverse the entire territory of China to touch the Paciffic.  To
the South it has two options for getting to the Indian Ocean:  go
through  Turkmenistan  and Iran or go down  via  Afghanistan  and
Pakistan.

Centuries  ago, the fabled "Silk Road" of Central Asia was  the
artery  of trade between Europe and China as well as  the  Indian
sub-continent.  But once the sea routes between Europe  and  Asia
opened  up, and the Central Asian Khanates were  integrated  into
Czarist Russia and later the Soviet Union, the Silk Road lost its
glory. With Central Asian republics re-emerging after the fall of
the Soviet Union five years ago, rebuilding transportation  links
to the outside world is at the top of the agenda here.

While the travellers on the Silk Road had to face the unforgiving
elements  and  punishing bandits, trading along these  parts  now
faces  equally  daunting  obstacles:  many  national  boundaries,
transport tariffs and conflicts over agreements on anything  from
freight  forwarding paperwork to visa applications  for  drivers.
The  Central  Asian  governments as  well  as  international  aid
agencies  are helping develop new transportation projects in  the
region.  The focus is on creating multiple routes out of  Central
Asia  in order to limit the vulnerabilities of relying on  anyone
particular outlet.

As  part of its strategy of defining a new political  profile  in
the  regional and the international arena, Uzbekistan is keen  to
diminish  its  current dependence on the  Russian  transportation
networks  to the north. And Tashkent is looking at access to  all
the three seas - to the Black Sea in the west, to the Pacific  in
the  east  and the Indian Ocean to the south. The  Europeans  are
said  to  be enthusiastic about the routes between West  and  the
East  through Caucasus and Central Asia that will develop a  land
access  to  the Chinese market. The proposed network  could  also
include  spurs  to  the  South  through  Iran,  Afghanistan   and
Pakistan.

The  indications here are that the Uzbek Government has  set  its
sights on realising the Afghan-Pak. corridor to the Indian Ocean.
Officials and academic analysts here believe that the Afghan-Pak.
corridor  is the simplest and most attractive - economically  and
politically  -  to hook up with the rest of the world.  It  would
help  the  Central Asians with an important  alternative  to  the
current  dependence  on the Russians. Transportation  links  from
Uzbekistan  and Turkmenistan into Afghanistan and  Pakistan  will
also  help the Central Asians avoid a total reliance on Iran  for
access to the south.

The  dream of reaching the warm water ports of the  Indian  Ocean
faces  just  one obstacle: the instability  in  Afghanistan.  Nor
surprisingly,  Tashkent  has  stepped  up  its  efforts  to  draw
international  attention to the Afghan crisis. It has  taken  the
initiative  to call for an arms embargo against Afghanistan as  a
first  step  towards peace. Rapid developments on the  ground  in
Afghanistan  in the form of the recent military advances  by  the
Pakistan-sponsored Taliban against the Kabul Government, however,
may  have complicated the prospects for the Uzbek  proposal.  But
corridor is likely to be enduring.

International oil companies are also interested in developing the
Afghan-Pak.  corridor to transport the huge oil and  natural  gas
reserves in Central Asia. A western oil executive told The  Hindu
here  that  building  an oil  pipeline  through  Afghanistan  and
Pakistan could be "the catalyst for the economic  transformation
of  the  region." Road and rail infrastructure  could  be  built
along  the  pipeline  routes linking  Central  Asia  to  Pakistan
through  Afghanistan. An American oil company, Unocal,  has  been
pushing  the  proposal in Washington as well as  in  the  region.
Unocal  appears  bullish on the project, despite  the  widespread
scepticism about the prospects for peace in Afghanistan.
India will have to carefully consider the efforts to link Central
Asia  with Pakistan through Afghanistan and the  consequences  of
such   a   fundamental   geopolitical   restructuring   in    our
neighbourhood.  The first thing New Delhi needs to do is  to  pay
immediate   diplomatic   attention   to   the   developments   in
Afghanistan, that could emerge as the hinge between Central  Asia
and the subcontinent.

India: Andhra Pradesh releases water into Poondi canal

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 6, Col. d

From Our Staff Reporter

HYDERABAD, Sept. 26.

The  Andhra Pradesh Government has formalised the  dedication  of
the Telugu Ganga Project, a canal dug up to convey Krishna waters
to  Madras  for drinking purpose.  It released  Srisailam  waters
into  the Poondi canal, the last segment. The waters, drawn  from
Somasila  project but stored in Kandaleru, a balancing  reservoir
midway,  were released into the Poondi canal.

The release was made on Wednesday as announced earlier. The water
so  released  will reach Uthukottai, near  Poondi  reservoir,  on
September  29  and  the  Chief Minister of  Tamil  Nadu,  Mr.  M.
Karunanidhi,  will  receive the delivery of water at  the  border
village and, in turn, formally release into the Poondi  reservoir
at  a function to be attended by Mr. Manohar Joshi and Mr. J.  H.
Patel, Chief Ministers of Maharashtra and Karnataka respectively.
Later  in  the  day, at another function  at  Madras  the  Andhra
Pradesh  Chief  Minister,  Mr.  N.  Chandrababu  Naidu,  will  be
felicitated  as  a  token  of gratitude  to  Andhra  Pradesh  for
implementation of the project against heavy odds.  The Tamil Nadu
Minister  for  Public  Works, Mr. Dorai  Murugan,  came  here  on
Thursday,  to  invite the Chief Minister,  the  Major  Irrigation
Minister, Dr. K. Sivaprasada Rao, and others.

Dr. Sivaprasada Rao questioned the propriety of some  Rayalaseema
politicians  belonging to the Congress(I) raising a bogey of  the
Government giving waters to Madras city without meeting the needs
of  their region. He blamed them for "the strange  inconsistency
in their stand" because the successive Congress Governments  did
not  oppose  the proposal and,  instead,   accepted  the  amounts
given by Tamil Nadu Government for implementation of the project.
"Had  they  been  sincere in their stand, they  would  not  have
accepted the money from Tamil Nadu in the first place," he said.
Dr.  Sivaprasada  Rao also said the agreement providing  for  the
Telugu  Ganga  Project was achieved between  the  three  riparian
States  of  Andhra  Pradesh, Karnataka  and  Maharashtra  at  the
instance  of Indira Gandhi and in the original project which  was
envisaged as a tunnel, there was no irrigation component at  all,
much less to benefit Rayalaseema. If the Congress leaders at that
time  had  been sincere enough about  serving  Rayalaseema,  they
would  have  prevailed upon Indira Gandhi for  inclusion  of  the
irrigation  component.  "But  they are raising  the  issue  now,
having kept silent then," he said.

Referring  to  the farmers of the region who were  agitated  over
conveying water to Madras, Dr. Sivaprasada Rao made it clear that
what   was  being  sent  for  the  present  was  3   tmcft,   the
contributions made by Karnataka and Maharashtra. Making reduction
in their original share by 5 tmcft each, these two upper riparian
States  had  already released that much quantum  into  Srisailam.
Andhra Pradesh would add its share only towards the fag end.
The  Minister  said it was not true that water was not  given  to
Rayalaseema  altogether  because an extent of  47,000  acres  was
already served with the Telugu Ganga in the region - 37,000 acres
in Kurnool district and 10,000 acres in Cuddapah. The  Government
would  need  at  least Rs. 1,000 crores to  complete  the  entire
project in its present form and it would fully spend the Rs.  100
crores allocated under the present budget.

Asked about the contributions made by the Tamil Nadu  Government,
the Minister said that what it owed towards the project was  less
than Rs. 10 crores.

India: How much water for Madras?

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 4, Col. e

From Our Staff Reporter

MADRAS, Sept. 26.

With  the  arrival  of  Krishna water  almost  a  certainty,  the
question  uppermost in the minds of people in Madras is how  much
extra water they will get.

At  present, 260 million litres of water is supplied to the  city
residents  daily. If three tmc ft comes, it means an addition  of
240 million litres daily (mld).

In  fact,  when Krishna water was scheduled to come to  the  city
last December, Metrowater had planned to increase the quantum  to
380-400 mld.

It is not known whether the authorities will now be able to stick
to  the  earlier plan as many aspects on water  availability  are
still not sorted out.

For  instance, officials are not clear on how much Krishna  water
will  be actually available for the distribution network and  how
long  the water will continue to flow as there are only a  couple
of  weeks left for the onset of northeast monsoon.  Moreover,  as
the  Kandaleru-Poondi  canal is a newly  constructed  one,  there
might be some teething problems and this could affect the pattern
of inflows.

In  view of these and other factors, any decision on increase  of
daily  supply will be dependent on the pattern of inflows. It  is
likely  that  the  officials will raise the supply  in  a  phased
manner.  Apart  from  the  quantum,  hours  of  supply  will   be
increased.

India: Shifting of refugees begins

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 4, Col. c

RAMANATHAPURAM, Sept. 26.

The shifting of refugees from the Mandapam camp, which is getting
filled  up due to the recent influx, began on Thursday  with  the
transportation  of  421  Sri Lankan Tamils to  various  camps  in
Tiruchi and Pudukkottai districts. The refugees, belonging to 100
families, were transported with armed escorts in seven buses.
The  Special Deputy Collector (Rehabilitation), Mr.  V.  Subbiah,
told  The  Hindu  at the Mandapam camp that  the  Government  had
planned  to accommodate the refugees at the camps  in  Kamarajar,
Pasumpon Muthuramalinga Thevar, South Arcot-Vallalar, Dharmapuri,
Tiruchi,  Pudukkottai,  Tiruvannamalai-Sambuvarayar,  Coimbatore,
Vellore-Ambedkar,  Salem,  Thiruvalluvar,  Periar  and   Dindigul
districts.  The  refugees  would  be shifted  in  batches  of  50
families to each district. Fifty per cent of Thursday's  despatch
included  those who had already been living in the Mandapam  camp
for  the past few years. Mr. Subbiah said about 300 families  had
expressed their willingness to go to the camp at Kottapattu  near
Tiruchi as most of their relatives were living in that area.

India: Effluents treatment: High Court direction to SIV

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 4, Col. a

From Our Staff Reporter

MADRAS, Sept. 26.

The  Madras  High Court has granted time till October 16  to  the
South  India  Viscose industries, Coimbatore, to  show  that  the
Lindox  Reactor  plant  installed by it  for  treating  effluents
reached  its optimum operation level and BOD would be reduced  to
the maximum extent.

A  Division Bench comprising the Chief Justice, Mr. K. A.  Swami,
and Mr. Justice A. R. Lakshmanan, passed this interim order on  a
writ appeal seeking immediate closure of the pulp unit of the SIV
at  Singanallur on the ground that the industrial effluents  were
polluting the waters of the Bhavani.

The  Bench said on October 17, a qualified engineer of the  Tamil
Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB) and also an engineer of  the
King  Institute,  Madras, should inspect the  industry  and  take
samples of water from the discharge point and also at each  point
of  100 metres upto 1,000 metres. They should test the  same  and
submit  a report with regard to the contents showing whether  the
BOD, COD and colour had been reduced and if so to what extent and
whether they were within tolerable limits.

Both the Board and the King Institute should submit the report to
the  court  in five sets on October 28. It was also open  to  the
industry  to  collect  the samples of water  and  have  the  test
conducted and submit its report also in five sets.

Referring  to the Board's plea for immediate closure of the  pulp
unit,  the Bench said in these cases, it was always the  question
of balancing public interest and the interest of the industry and
its  workmen.  The  Judges  pointed out  that  the  industry  had
employed over 3,000 workers and was in existence for a long time.
Moreover, 300 similar industries were functioning throughout  the
country. As the time sought for by the industry was not long, the
Bench  accepted  the request of the company to  grant  time  till
October 16, when the reactor would reach its optimum level.
Initially  the  SIV filed a writ petition  challenging  the  show
cause  notice issued by the Board on February 15, 1995 as to  why
the pulp unit should not be closed. Disposing of the petition,  a
single  Judge  directed the Board to give an opportunity  to  the
petitioner  to put forth its proposal for effluent treatment  and
to comply with the conditions imposed by the Board.

The  Bhavani  River Protection Joint Council,  which  got  itself
impleaded in the writ petition, preferred an appeal and submitted
that  it was high time the pulp plant was directed to  be  closed
down immediately to prevent pollution of the Bhavani river water.
It  said it was necessary to stop further discharge of  effluents
into the river to prevent injury to public health.

On  behalf of the SIV it was submitted that steps had been  taken
for effluent treatment by installing the Lindox Reactor Plant  at
a cost of Rs. 50 crores. It was making further efforts to  ensure
that  the  effluent was treated to the required  extent.  If  the
factory  was  ordered to be closed about 3,000 workers  would  be
rendered  idle. An opportunity might be given till October 16  so
that  the plant after reaching its maximum operation  bring  down
the BOD content to the tolerance limit which would in turn reduce
the COD and consequently the colour of water.

The  Board submitted that even if the strategy suggested  by  the
industry  was fully implemented, the COD would not be  completely
reduced  and  further  efforts  had to  be  made.  There  was  no
justification to permit the pulp plant to continue to operate any
more.

India: Parties flouting poll code

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 3, Col. b

From Our Staff Reporter

MADRAS, Sept. 26.

That  the civic polls are round the corner has been evident  over
the  past  couple  of  days  with  political  parties  and  their
candidates  putting  up flags, festoons and  even  an  occasional
`arch' in various parts of the city.

Flags  are  tied  to  ropes  and  hung  across  many  roads.  The
Corporation  lamp posts have come in handy for the  purpose.  The
parties do not seem to have taken the model code of conduct  laid
dawn  by the State Election Commission, for the elections to  the
urban local bodies, seriously.

Section  11  (General)  in  Booklet 3  says  that  'no  party  or
candidate  shall permit its/his followers to use any  private  or
public  property  for erecting flag staffs or  cut-outs,  pasting
notices, posters or writing slogans or suspending banners without
the written permission from the owner of the property  concerned;
and  where such permission is obtained, a copy of the same  shall
forthwith be sent to the District Election Officer and in case of
Corporation to the Returning Officer.'

But  Corporation  sources  said permission is  not  accorded  for
erection  of  structures  across roads,  putting  up  banners  or
festoons.

A  trip  round the city reveals that parties have not  taken  the
rules seriously. Flags tied to ropes have been hung between  lamp
posts across the road Dr. Radhakrishnan Salai, Gopalapuram,  Anna
Nagar 2nd avenue, Nelson Manickam Road, Sterling Road, Muttukkadu
Road,  L.  B. Road, Greenways Road, V. K. Iyer  Road,  Royapettah
High  Road  and Srinivasa Avenue (RA Puram).  The  barricades  on
medians have also come in handy to install the flagstaff.
The ruling party flags and festoons are the most `visible' of the
lot; followed by the TMC, the odd Rajni Rasigar Mandram flag and,
at a couple of places, AIADMK.

Loudspeakers,  especially  the cone type, too have  been  working
overtime  - either blaring music or the voices  of  propagandists
canvassing votes for a particular candidate. The code of  conduct
(Section 13, General) says that "loudspeakers shall not be  used
to  transmit  music or songs".

China may back India for U.N. Council seat

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 1, Col. f

From R. Chakrapani

UNITED NATIONS, Sept. 26.

In  the forthcoming elections for the non-permanent seats in  the
Security Council, the United States is known to be backing  Japan
but  India is not altogether without support from  the  Council's
permanent members.

Russia  is  believed to have indicated to  the  External  Affairs
Minister, Mr. Inder K. Gujral, that it will vote for India.
Another  surprise  development  is said to  be  that  China  will
support India. There are signs that relations between Beijing and
New  Delhi are warming up with a projected visit to India by  the
Chinese  President, Mr. Jiang Zamin. The Chinese  relations  with
Japan  are not at its best currently. A Chinese statement in  the
General  Assembly  also showed that Beijing is concerned  at  the
dangers  inherent  in  a unipolar world if it  was  going  to  be
dominated  by a single super power - the United States. The  same
statement,  delivered by the Chinese Foreign Minister,  Mr.  Qian
Quichen also gave his support to the Non-Aligned Movement voicing
the concerns of developing countries.

Mr. Gujral was asked about the chances of India succeeding in its
efforts  to get elected to non-permanent seat falling  vacant  to
the Security Council from the start of the new year. "We have  a
fighting  chance  to win" replied Mr. Gujral. "If  we  did  not
win,"  he  said,  there  was no reason  why  India  should  feel
disappointed. "But I do think our chances of getting elected are
reasonably good."

Delhi to host NAM meet

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 1, Col. e

From R. Chakrapani

UNITED NATIONS, Sept. 26.

The  next  meeting  of the Inter-Ministerial group  of  the  Non-
aligned  countries will be held in New Delhi, it was  unanimously
decided at a meeting of the group here on Wednesday. The meeting,
which  could be held in April or later, will be  of  significance
because  it  will  define  issues to be  brought  up  before  the
Nationalised Summit meeting, probably to be held in South Africa.
At  a  meeting  of  the  ministerial  group  held  at  the   U.N.
headquarters,  and  attended  by a  large  number  of  Nonaligned
Foreign  Ministers,  the  External Affairs Minister,  Mr.  I.  K.
Gujral,  offered  to host the Inter-Ministerial  meeting  in  New
Delhi  and this was readily endorsed by Egypt and  several  other
countries.

About  40  Ministers participating in the  discussions  made  the
point  that  the  Nonaligned  movement  had  not  only  lost  its
relevance in the post-Cold-War era.

Earlier,  Mr. Gujral spoke of the "new challenges"  that  would
confront the Nonaligned movement in the post-Cold-War period  and
it would be necessary for these countries to face them  unitedly.
"These   challenges,"  he  said,  "are  posed  by  forces   of
extremism,  ethnic  discord, terrorism  and  growing  disparities
across  the  globe.  To these challenges, we must  add  those  of
nuclear disarmament, and economic and social development."
He recalled the struggle of the nonaligned countries in the  area
of  nuclear  disarmament,  and explained why  India  opposed  the
Comprehensive  Test  Ban  Treaty. It would  be  apparent  to  any
impartial  observer  that  the  CTBT text  did  not  reflect  any
meaningful  commitment  to the cause of global peace  or  nuclear
disarmament.  The  treaty,  in  its  essential  form,  sought  to
perpetuate the discriminatory and highly unequal status quo "for
all times".

It was necessary for the Nonaligned movement, Mr. Gujral said  to
work for a world free of nuclear weapons and the Nonaligned forum
was   the  most  appropriate  platform  to  achieve  the   common
objectives and shared visions.

Mr.  Gujral also referred to India's bid to seek a  non-permanent
seat in the U.N. Security Council in the vacancy to be caused  by
Indonesia's exit. He sought the support of Nonaligned  countries,
pointing  out  that  if India lost the fight,  it  would  deprive
representation for the movement.

Mr.  Gujral exchanged views on bilateral and multilateral  issues
with  more  visiting  Foreign Minister,  including  Russia's  Mr.
Primakov and Ministers from the European Union.

India: High Court rejects Rao"s plea for anticipatory bail

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 1, Col. d

From Our Staff Reporter

NEW DELHI, Sept. 26.

The  Delhi High Court today dismissed the former Prime  Minister,
Mr.  P. V. Narasimha Rao's petition for anticipatory bail in  the
$100,000  Lakhubhai  Pathak cheating case, in which he  has  been
summoned  by a trial court here to appear before it on  September
30.

Mr. Justice S. K. Mahajan dismissed Mr. Rao's petition  observing
that it was not maintainable. "It should be left to the  regular
court  to  deal with the matter on the accused  appearing  before
that court," he observed.

"As  only  summons  have  been issued by  the  trial  court  for
appearance  of  the petitioner (Mr. Rao) on September  30,  there
cannot be any apprehension of his arrest before he appears in the
court," Mr. Justice Mahajan noted in a four-page order.
The  Judge passed the order after hearing arguments by Mr.  Rao's
counsel,  Mr. Kapil Sibal, and counsel for the CBI, Mr.  S.  Lal.
The  court  was packed to capacity during the  proceedings  which
lasted for 25 minutes.

The Special Judge, Mr. Ajit Bharihoke, on September 21  dismissed
an application by Mr. Rao seeking recall of the summons issued to
him earlier by the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Mr. Prem Kumar,
and issued new summons to him to appear in his court on September
30.

Arguing on the application today, Mr. Sibal submitted that  since
the offence was non-bailable, the former Prime Minister would  be
arrested immediately on his appearance in the trial court and  he
would  have to make an application for bail. Mr. Sibal  expressed
fear that the trial court might not grant bail to Mr. Rao when he
appeared before it on September 30.

In  this regard, Mr. Justice Mahajan observed in his  order  that
"the  contention of Mr. Sibal that even in a case where  summons
have  been  issued  by  the  trial  court  for  appearance,   the
petitioner  is entitled to move this court for anticipatory  bail
is not correct".

"It  is  only in the case of non-bailable warrants  having  been
issued  and  in  the case of apprehension by the  accused  to  be
arrested  before  he appears in the court, which had  issued  the
non-bailable warrants, that there is an apprehension of arrest by
the  accused.  In the present case, in my opinion,  there  is  no
apprehension of arrest of the petitioner till the time he appears
in the trial court."

Opposing  Mr. Rao's petition, Mr. Lal contended that there  could
be  no  apprehension on the part of Mr. Rao as it was  a  summons
case.  The petition of Mr. Rao seeking anticipatory bail was  not
maintainable, he submitted.

About Mr. Sibal's submission that Mr. Rao be granted anticipatory
bail  by the High Court as was granted to the BJP leader, Mr.  L.
K. Advani, in the multicrore Jain hawala case, Mr. Lal  contended
that  the  case  of  Mr. Advani  was  different  as  non-bailable
warrants had been issued against him by the court.

India: CBI chargesheet Rao in St. Kitts case

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 1, Col. a

From Our Special Correspondent

NEW DELHI, Sept. 26.

The  former  Prime Minister, Mr. P. V. Narasimha Rao,  and  three
others, including the self-styled godman Chandraswami, were today
chargesheeted by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in the
St. Kitts Forgery case.

The  CBI  also named the former Minister of  State  for  External
Affairs,  Mr.  K. K. Tewary and Mr. Kailash Nath  Aggarwal  alias
"Mamaji,"  close  associate  of  Chandraswami  in  the  15-page
chargesheet  filed in the court of Mr. Prem Kumar, Delhi's  Chief
Metropolitan Magistrate.

A. P. Nanday, former Deputy Director, Enforcement Directorate and
George D. McLean, Chairman of the First Trust Corporation Bank in
St. Kitts, also figure in the chargesheet. However, the two  have
since died and the proceedings against them have terminated.
Mr.  K. L. Verma, former Director in the Enforcement  Directorate
and  Mr. Larry J. Kolb, a relative of the arms dealer  Mr.  Adnan
Khashoggi, were named as accused in the chargesheet but there was
no  sufficient evidence against them. The CBI has  requested  the
Court  that the two may be discharged. The chargesheet will  come
up  for further consideration before the Court on October 1.  The
judge   directed  the  CBI  to  file  supporting  documents   and
statements before the next date of hearing. Both Chandraswami and
Mr.  Aggarwal  are now lodged in the Central Tihar Jail  here  in
connection with the Lakhubhai Pathak cheating case.

The  chargesheet came a day before the scheduled hearing  of  the
St.  Kitts  case tomorrow in the Supreme Court. The  CBI  had  on
September 9 told the apex court that it would be in a position to
apprise   the   court  of  "definite   actions"   relating   to
investigations in the case.

According to the chargesheet, the CBI investigation revealed that
the  persons accused, in conspiracy with each  other,  fabricated
evidence with the intent and knowledge to cause the former  Prime
Minister, Mr. V. P. Singh and his son, Mr. Ajeya Singh, convicted
of  the offence under the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act  (FERA)
and  the  Prevention of Corruption Act (PCA) and  to  harm  their
reputation in the eyes of the public.

The  chargesheet  refers to the report of the  auditors  who  had
scrutinised  the accounts of the First Trust Corporation Bank  in
the  Carribean island of St. Kitts. It says that the account  was
opened  on  September 16, 1988 and closed on February  13,  1989.
Incidentally, both the days were public holidays in St. Kitts.  A
total amount of $21 millions was deposited and withdrawn from the
account.

The four accused, including Mr. Narasimha Rao, have been  charged
under  Section 120-B read with Sections 195, 469 and 471  of  the
Indian   Penal  Code.  The  provisions  relate   to   conspiracy,
fabrication  of false evidence with intent to procure  conviction
of  offence punishable with imprisonment of seven years or  more,
forgery and using forged documents.

The  chargesheet said that as the Minister of State for  External
Affairs,  Mr.  Tewary  had called for  the  file  containing  the
application  for  passport  of  Mr.  Ajeya  Singh  to  trace  his
signatures  which  were  allegedly  forged  later.  This  showed,
according  to  the chargesheet, that Mr. Tewary  knew  about  the
conspiracy right from the initial stage.

The chargesheet was filed six years after the CBI registered  the
FIR in the case on May 25, 1990. The Supreme Court had pulled  up
the  CBI in April last for dragging the investigations.  It  said
that if the situation had reached a stage where no candid  result
could be achieved, the Court might be forced to record a  finding
that the investigating machinery had come to a grinding halt.
The case had been gathering dust until the end of last year  when
the Supreme Court had brought it back to life following a  public
interest petition moved by Mr. Anukul Chandra Pradhan,  advocate,
seeking  the Court's directions to the CBI and other  authorities
to conduct an expeditious probe.

The  FIR had referred to the alleged role of Mr.  Narasimha  Rao,
then  External Affairs Minister in the Cabinet of Prime  Minister
Rajiv Gandhi, as well as of Capt. Satish Sharma and others in the
forgery conspiracy but none of them was mentioned as "accused."
The  St. Kitts case relates to the opening of a bogus account  by
alleged  forgery of bank documents to show that Mr.  Ajeya  Singh
had  stashed  away  a large amount of forex in  the  secret  bank
account.  The documents pertained to the bank account alleged  to
have  been  in  the name of Mr. Ajeya Singh,  maintained  in  St.
Kitts.  The  whole exercise, according to the CBI, was  aimed  at
defaming Mr. V. P. Singh, potential rival of Rajiv Gandhi.
On  the role of Mr. Narasimha Rao, the FIR said that  during  his
stay  in  New  York between September 25 to October  5,  1989  in
connection  with  the  U.N.  General  Assembly  session,  he  had
instructed  Mr.  R. K. Rai, then India's  consul-general  in  New
York,  to  authenticate  certain  documents.  Telephonic  contact
between Mr. Rao and Mr. Khashoggi reportedly took place at  23-06
hours on October 3 and at 09-42 hours, the Counsellor had met Mr.
Rao in his hotel suite.

The  entire  exercise  was  allegedly done  at  the  instance  of
Chandraswami  alias Nemi Chand Jain who had urged the  Government
to  send a team of officials to probe the alleged account of  Mr.
Ajeya  Singh in St. Kitts. A team, comprising the then  Chief  of
the  Enforcement  Directorate,  Mr. K. L. Verma  and  the  Deputy
Director,  A. P. Nanday, had visited the island and  returned  to
New  York with photocopies of some documents which were  attested
by George McLean.

Nanday  was deputed by the Rajiv Gandhi government in  September-
October 1989 to inquire into "reports" that Mr. Ajeya Singh had
a foreign bank account. He conducted investigation in the  "full
knowledge"  of  Chandraswami, Mr. Aggarwal,  George  McLean  and
Larry  Colb.  Nanday had also avoided  Indian  Embassy  officials
throughout  his  stay abroad and was  Chandraswami's  guest.  The
godman  was  staying in Mr. Adnan Khashoggi's  apartment  in  the
Olympic Towers.

While  in  New  York, the officials sought  directions  from  the
Government and were told that the documents should be attested to
by some officials of the Indian Embassy in the U.S.  Accordingly,
the help of Mr. Narasimha Rao was sought as he happened to be  in
New York as part of his scheduled visit. He then asked Mr. Rai to
attest  the documents which would be brought by the officials  of
the  Enforcement  Directorate.  The  allegation  was  that  while
Chandraswami's  secretary was the "master forger," Mr. Rao  had
ordered Mr. Rai to authenticate the documents.

According to the chargesheet, Mr. Rao who was staying at the U.N.
Plaza hotel was contacted on telephone by Chandraswami on October
3,  1989. A day later, Mr. Rao contacted Mr. Prakash  Shah,  then
Additional Secretary, Ministry of External Affairs, in connection
with the authentication of the documents.

The  chargesheet  said that on October 6, 1989 Mr.  Aggarwal  had
called Mr. Shiv Kumar, Indian High Commissioner in Port of Spain,
and  introduced him as a family friend of Mr. Narasimha  Rao.  He
asked the official to go to St. Kitts and meet the Prime Minister
there and inquire about the affair. He had also made a  telephone
call to Mr. S. C. Gupta, then Second Secretary in the Indian High
Commission  in Port of Spain, and virtually dictated a letter  to
him to be sent to St. Kitts.

India: Villagers flee as Pak. firing intensifies

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 1, Col. a

From Our Correspondent

SRINAGAR, Sept. 26.

The hostilities on the India-Pakistan border in northern  Kashmir
has  intensified  in  the last three days,  leaving  hundreds  of
people homeless.

Most  of  the projectiles fired from across the  border  hit  the
civilian  targets,  creating  panic among the  masses.  When  the
firing  did not stop on Tuesday, the people had no option but  to
flee. Large-scale migration started on Wednesday.

Indian fiscal deficit is unsustainable: Camdessus

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 1, Col. b

From Sridhar Krishnaswami

WASHINGTON, Sept. 26.

The  Managing  Director of the International Monetary  Fund,  Mr.
Michel   Camdessus,   has  termed  the  Indian   fiscal   deficit
`unsustainable' and has called upon New Delhi to cut this in half
over the next five years.

Answering  a  question  at a press conference  this  morning  the
Managing  Director of the IMF made the point that while India  in
the  last  few years had solved a few problems such  as  external
financial  vulnerability  and  reducing inflation,  the  pace  of
fiscal  consolidation  seemed  to be  concentrated  only  on  the
Central  Government side. The overall public sector deficit  that
would  have to include the Centre and State governments  and  the
public sector enterprises came to over nine per cent of the Gross
Domestic  Product  and this was not  sustainable,  Mr.  Camdessus
remarked.

The  issue  of fiscal deficit is expected to figure high  on  the
agenda  in  the  meeting between Mr.  Camdessus  and  the  Indian
Finance Minister Mr. P. Chidambaram during this year's meeting of
the World Bank and the IMF.

The argument of Mr. Camdessus has been that if the problem of the
fiscal  deficit  was  not addressed  this  would  jeopardise  the
investment  needed for sustained high growth, and if  allowed  to
continue  there  was  the  potential  of  the  risk  of  external
vulnerability re-emerging.

The  IMF Managing Director said that while there was no  dramatic
solution to the problem, the fiscal deficit could be halved  over
the  next five years. Last week a senior official of the IMF  had
suggested that the programme of halving the fiscal deficit over a
five  year  period could be done at the rate  of  one  percentage
point a year. Today Mr. Camdessus argued that while taking  steps
to  come  to  grips with the fiscal  deficit  India  should  also
simultaneously develop efforts on the structural side that  would
help  do  away  with the quantitative  restrictions  in  imports,
continuing  the  financial reforms and the reform of  the  public
enterprises, besides opening much more broadly the big domain  of
public infrastructure to private investment.

India: PM takes oath as RS member

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 1, Col. d

From Our Special Correspondent

NEW DELHI, Sept. 26.

The Prime Minister, Mr. H. D. Deve Gowda was today sworn in as  a
member  of  the Rajya Sabha. He had been elected  unopposed  from
Karnataka.  The Prime Minister was administered the oath  by  the
Secretary General of the Rajya Sabha, Mrs. V. S. Rama Devi in the
chamber of the Rajya Sabha Chairman, Mr. K. R. Narayanan.
Besides the Vice-President, Mr. Narayanan, the Railway  Minister,
Mr. Ram Vilas Paswan, the Information and Broadcasting  Minister,
Mr.  C.  M. Ibrahim, the former Finance  Minister,  Dr.  Manmohan
Singh, Mrs. Margaret Alva and Mr. S. S. Ahluwalia (all  Congress)
Mr.  Satish Aggarwal and Mr. T. N. Chaturvedi  (Bharatiya  Janata
Party) attended the oath-taking.

Mr.  Gowda,  thus  became  the  first  Prime  Minister  to  enter
Parliament  through the Rajya Sabha. In 1966, when Indira  Gandhi
was  elected leader of the Congress Parliamentary Party, she  was
already a member of the Rajya Sabha. In 1991, Mr. P. V. Narasimha
Rao  chose to enter the Lok Sabha by contesting from the  Nandyal
constituency.

`No threat to Govt.'

The Prime Minister was reported to have said that there could  be
no threat to his Government owing to the change of leadership  in
the  Congress. According to Mr. Gowda the decision to  support  a
non-BJP  formation was taken by the Congress  Working  Committee.
The  implication  was  that it was not  a  private  understanding
between  Mr.  P.  V.  Narasimha Rao and  him;  rather  it  was  a
political  commitment  made  in a particular  context  which  had
remained unchanged.

India: BJP to move High Court on irregular land deals

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 6, Col. d

From Our Special Correspondent

BANGALORE, Sept. 26.

The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has decided to approach the High
Court through public interest petitions challenging the irregular
land and other deals which had resulted in huge loss to the State
exchequer   as   the   Government  seemed  to   be   unmoved   by
representations and agitations.

This  was stated here today by Mr. B. S. Yediyurappa,  Leader  of
the Opposition in the Assembly.

The  party would come out with a "public  chargesheet"  against
the   Government  about  the  several  irregular  deals   to   be
distributed  among the public as it had done successfully  during
the Chief Ministership of Mr. S. Bangarappa.

Mr.  Yediyurappa mentioned of a transaction involving  about  300
acres  of  Government  land estimated to cost  around  Rs.  1,000
crores near Bidadi coming under Ramanagaram Assembly constituency
represented  by  the Prime Minister, Mr. H. D.  Deve  Gowda,  and
"misuse of funds" in road laying in new Bagalkot town.

Participating in a meet-the-press programme, Mr. Yediyurappa said
only  two years ago the authorities had spent Rs. 4.5 crores  for
laying a 7.5 k.m. stretch of metal roads in the new Bagalkot town
which  worked out to Rs. 63 lakhs per k.m. This was  the  highest
rate ever paid. The authorites had invited tenders for a  similar
road for which the cost specified was Rs. 23 lakhs, which clearly
indicated misuse of at least Rs. 3 crores earlier.

Mr.  Yediyurappa said several such cases had been highlighted  by
him  during  the discussion on the no-confidence  motion  in  the
Assembly  recently,  but  the House  had  been  adjourned  amidst
confusion without a reply.

Describing  the 118-day-old Government headed by Mr. J. H.  Patel
as  one  that lacked political stability and direction,  the  BJP
leader  said it was "an orphan" supported neither by the  Prime
Minister  nor the Ministers and legislators of the ruling  party.
The  hope  that  with  Mr. Patel  becoming  Chief  Minister,  the
Congress  culture would go had been belied as he was  looking  to
Delhi  for  everything  and was in the clutches  of  the  excise,
granite and land grabbers, he added.

Mr. Yediyurappa said the only strength of the Janata Dal, both at
the  State  and in the Centre, appeared to be  the  weakness  and
factional   fight  in  the  Congress.  The  Prime  Minister   was
blackmailing  the  Congress leadership and even hijacking  it.  A
beginning had been made with the weaning away of Mr. Ajit Singh.
He  said  the  State Government was  not  taking  the  Opposition
parties into confidence while dealing with important issues  such
as  river water. Even an attempt was made to mislead them on  the
nature of talks and the understanding arrived at with Tamil  Nadu
during  the  Cauvery water talks recently. The  talks  themselves
were  stage-managed to save the chair of the Prime  Minister  and
the  State Chief Minister. Similarly, the Alamatti Dam issue  was
being treated as if it was a party affair, he said.

Mr.  Yediyurappa  said he recently visited the  Tungabhadra  left
bank  area where an aqueduct had collapsed. The canal itself  had
been  repaired 176 times in the last 45 years. One  estimate  put
the current crop loss at Rs. 500 crores.

Mr. Yediyurappa, who has just returned from a tour of the  State,
said  he was confident his party would win at least four  of  the
six  Assembly seats it was contesting. The party  was  supporting
independents in two constituencies as its aim was to see that the
Janata Dal was defeated.

Mr.  Ramachandra Gowda, MLC and vice-president of the State  unit
of the party, said that completion of 118 days in office was  the
only  achievement  of  Mr.  Patel.  The  ruling  party  was   not
concentrating  on  administration  as it was not  sure  when  the
Government would come down because of instability.

Replying  to  a  question, Mr. Yediyurappa  said  the  party  had
decided to support any candidate to be fielded by the Congress or
the  Rashtreeya Nava Nirmana Vedike in the election to the  Rajya
Sabha.  But  because  of  the decision of  the  Congress  at  the
national level not to field a candidate and the difficulty of the
latter  in fielding a candidate without involving an  element  of
risk  to  the ruling party legislators  supporting  the  nominee,
there was no choice except to keep out of contest.

Mr.  Yediyurappa denied there was any understanding  between  the
Prime  Minister and the BJP president, Mr. L. K. Advani,  not  to
field  a  BJP  candidate against Mr. H. D. Deve  Gowda.  He  also
denied  there was any alignment with the Vedike. It was  only  an
understanding  to  defeat the Congress and the Janata  Dal  which
were two sides of the same coin, he added.

To  another question, Mr. Yediyurappa said Mr. Hegde had his  own
contribution  to the Janata Dal coming to power in the State  and
Mr.  Gowda  becoming the Prime Minister. In the  State  political
interest,  the BJP had to support his stand.  The  meet-the-press
programme  was organised jointly by the Press Club  of  Bangalore
and Bangalore Reporters' Guild.

The Hindu-Editorial: Hares, hounds and lawyers: Lawyers must consciously
project the counter image that they are mediators of accountability and
not for political, financial or any other kind of hire in public interest
litigation

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 12, Col. c

By Rajeev Dhavan

JOKES about lawyers are increasing. If earlier 'legal` joke books
carried  innocuous  titles like 'Laughter and the  Law`,  today`s
anthologies  are  more direct and vicious, sporting  titles  like
"Lawyers as reptiles." Jokes tell us a lot about how a  society
thinks.  But, not all jokes reflect public opinion. Jokes  are  a
powerful  weapon to embarrass, oppress and type-cast  people  and
communities. If they occasion humour, they also defame; and,  may
damage  the  psyche of those at the receiving  end.  Jokes  about
lawyers  are  typically about their ruthlessness, their  lack  of
scruples in inventing arguments for whoever is willing to  reward
lawyers, their money mindedness. Lawyers are supposed to have  no
qualms  about running with the hares and hunting with the  hounds
with equal aplomb. And, the jokes tell it all.

Despite this reputation, people resort to lawyers. Perhaps,  they
have  no  other  choice but to turn to the  most  'artful`  in  a
society  in  which disputes abound and the rule  of  law  suffers
injury  from constant attack. Some interesting questions come  to
the fore in the recent exchange between Mr. Anil Diwan who is the
Supreme Court`s amicus in the Hawala case and Mr. Ram  Jethmalani
who  was  involved in the public interest case which led  to  the
Supreme Court`s investigation and subsequent orders; but who  now
appears  for  one  of  the accused, Mr.  L.  K.  Advani,  who  is
allegedly  a friend and political ally. Since  both  involvements
were  pro bono (without any payment), the issues are not  clouded
with  any accusation that any appearance was for  personal  gain.
The  argument is over the application of professional  norms  (if
any) to public interest law (PIL) counsel. The narrower issue  as
to  whether  it is proper for Mr. Jethmalani to  appear  for  Mr.
Advani  leads to questions about wider issues  concerning  public
interest  lawyers, PIL and the judicial activism that  has  grown
out  of it. Is PIL a public trust or a matter for the  individual
perception of the PIL lawyers involved?

PIL is a powerful instrument of accountability but it must not be
abused  as  it  has  been  in  many  cases.  Mr.  Jethmalani   is
responsible  for assisting the courts on many  crucial  questions
about who may represent the public interest. Any doubt about  the
legitimate  use of PIL can only give the enterprise a  bad  name.
Controversy  abounds.  One strand of the controversy  is  whether
'libertarian`  lawyers  can  ever  appear  for  those  who   have
allegedly abused human rights. Several lawyers (including myself)
have  been criticised for doing so even where it has been  argued
that  there  were public interest reasons for appearance  on  the
other  side.  This new controversy goes further, it  involves  an
allegation  of  'floor  crossing` in the same  batch  of  related
issues. It is particularly important because of the status of the
counsel and because it is not muddied by financial considerations
but  it is about the scope of the public interest insofar  as  it
concerns PIL lawyers.

The  exchange  between Mr. Anil Diwan and Mr.  Jethmalani  is  as
embarrassing  as it is troubling. Why should two  senior  counsel
quarrel  in  public  over  this  issue?  Discounting  personality
clashes  and differences, the issue needs examination. The  facts
seem  to  be  documented in an exchange of  letters  between  the
protagonists  which  have been made public. In  response  to  Mr.
Jethmalani  having declared that he will appear for  Mr.  Advani,
Mr. Diwan issued a press statement on September 22, 1996 (the day
the proceedings were to start) with "extreme reluctance and only
from a sense of public duty," expressing his discomfiture  which
relates back to March 26, 1996 when he had earlier written to Mr.
Jethmalani  expressing  'alarm` and 'distress` about  the  latter
appearing  for  Mr.  Advani.  It  transpires  that  it  was   Mr.
Jethmalani  who had involved Mr. Diwan in this case. There is  no
dispute about Mr. Jethmalani`s involvement with the PIL case that
led to the Hawala proceedings. In fact, in his letter of April 3,
1996,  Mr. Jethmalani forthrightly states: "I am quite clear  in
my mind that I am the architect of the petition, the moving force
behind  it  and  a  constant  participant  and  advisor  in   the
deliberations." So the issue was not whether he was involved  in
the  PIL  case but whether having been involved he  was  free  to
appear  for one of the accused. After explaining why  the  charge
against  Mr. Advani is totally untenable, in the same letter  Mr.
Jethmalani makes it clear that he has "no intention of appearing
for accused other than Mr. Advani."

Mr.   Jethmalani  justified  his  stance  by  referring  to   the
Advocates` Conduct Rules (which he claims to have drafted)  which
make  a  lawyer bound to accept any brief (except  under  special
circumstances, see R. 11) and to argue fearlessly by all fair and
honourable  means  (R.  15) as long as he  does  not  breach  the
confidence  of the client (R. 17 and 24). But, who is the  client
in the PIL case? Are PIL lawyers their own clients even when they
appear  for others? Mr. Jethmalani`s April 3, 1996 letter  became
redundant  because his junior wrote to Mr. Diwan on April 9  that
Mr. Jethmalani would not appear for Mr. Advani. Mr. Diwan replied
by drawing attention to another rule (R. 33) that anyone who  has
advised  or drawn pleadings for one side shall not plead for  the
opposite  party, pointing out that Mr. Advani`s name  appears  in
the PIL petitioners` pleadings. Equally, having used the  diaries
as a leverage, could any PIL lawyer cross over to the other  side
and  question any part of the case on which the PIL  petition  is
founded?  The  fact  that PIL cases  are  non-adversarial  cannot
foreclose  the  issue. Those affected by the PIL  and  are  being
brought  to book are on the other side. Anyhow, the death of  the
controversy  in April did not prevent a September  revival,  with
Mr.  Jethmalani  informing Mr. Diwan by letter on  September  17,
1996  that he was appearing for Mr. Advani and Mr.  Diwan  making
his press release. Mr. Jethmalani had fairly told Mr. Diwan  that
he  hoped  that Mr. Diwan would not create  controversy  but  Mr.
Jethmalani would understand if he did.

This  controversy is important because the distinguished  counsel
did  what  they did for clear reasons which  are  documented.  It
affects  cause  lawyering in India and may set patterns  for  the
future.  Mr. Jethmalani`s stance appears to be that  the  purpose
behind  the Hawala PIL case was to expose corruption and nab  the
guilty  and  not  oppress  the  innocent;  and  that  it  is  not
inconsistent with the public interest but fulfils its purposes to
defend Mr. Advani against whom there is no case in law. But, if a
personally judgmental stance of this nature were to be  accepted,
every PIL lawyer would be free to make exceptions, jump the fence
and  defend  whom  they like. This is not  to  suggest  that  PIL
lawyers  should not be discerning about whom they  are  attacking
and exposing. Indeed, it is their public duty to ensure that  the
PIL case does not result in a miscarriage of justice. But, once a
PIL case starts, it is for the Court to determine who is innocent
and who is guilty.

However  great  a criminal lawyer a person may be,  a  prosecutor
cannot cross over and be defence counsel even though it is always
open to the prosecution to submit that there is no case against a
particular  accused. Such withdrawal can only take  place  within
the discipline of the law. PIL lawyers are no differently  placed
than prosecution counsel. In environment cases, PIL lawyers often
distinguish between real and wrongly accused defaulters. As  long
as  this  is  honestly  done to  the  Court  concerned,  this  is
unexceptional.  But, these are the farthest limits to which  they
can go. But, just because they feel that one of the persons  they
are  proceeding against is innocent, they cannot appear in  mind,
spirit or fact for the allegedly innocent either in that case  or
any  other  related  proceeding. If this rule  of  thumb  is  not
respected,  lesser  professionals would, even with  the  best  of
intents, run with the hares and hunt with the hounds.

What  complicates  the  present  imbroglio  is  Mr.  Jethmalani`s
closeness  with the BJP, his appointment as Law Minister  in  the
ill-fated  BJP  Ministry, his ire  against  particular  political
parties  and  persons and his frankly declared  political  views.
This  must,  perforce, leave behind the impression  that  a  very
important  PIL case was not without political undertones even  if
it  was conceived in the public interest. This would  affect  the
enterprise of PIL as a whole. Properly interpreted the rules  are
reasonably  clear  cut. Involvement in a case (albeit  by  giving
advice or settling legal documents) is enough to prevent  lawyers
from  appearing for anyone in that or in any related  case  where
there may be a potential conflict of interest. This rule must  be
applied  in  an all or nothing fashion; and,  with  even  greater
rigour in PIL cases where the public is the client.

Jokes  about lawyers underline public suspicion about how  artful
lawyers  can be. But, before the jokes take their  toll,  lawyers
must  consciously  project  the  counter  image  that  they   are
mediators  of accountability and not for political, financial  or
any other kind of hire in PIL cases. Even the best of  intentions
may produce the worst of results. Nothing should be permitted  to
undermine  faith in the law at a time of moral cholera.  If  this
means clearer rules about cause lawyering, so be it. All the more
so,  because two senior counsel and 'eminent jurists` seem to  be
unsure about the rules and the right course of action.

Attitude of our athletes has to change: Amritraj

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 22, Col. a

MADRAS, Sept. 27.

Vijay Amritraj sees India's poor record in the world of sport  as
a puzzle. And he quietly sets about putting the pieces together.
"All  the  pieces are there," he says, with a  smile  quite  as
radiant  as a child would flash after putting together its  first
plastic alphabet puzzle.

"It's  the attitude," says Vijay, raising his voice  just  that
bit  for theatrical effect as he picks up the last piece  of  the
puzzle.  "The attitude of our athletes has to change. They  seem
to  settle  for less, they seem to be contented with  less,"  he
says.

It  is  another  one  of  the  globe-trotting  former  Davis  Cup
captain's    meet-the-media    mornings   and    the    celebrity
player-turned-commentator is talking about why India should be so
backward in the world of sport.

"If  you look at the kind of money that has gone into  the  game
(tennis) in the last five years and then look at the results,  it
doesn't  match  up.  We  really have  to  demand  more  from  our
athletes," says Vijay.

He  is  tremendously impressed by Leander  Paes's  bronze-winning
effort  at Atlanta but feels that it is not enough in the  larger
context of Indian sport.

"Why settle for one bronze. I think if we make a serious effort,
if  we  shortlist 10 or 15 sports where we are fairly  good,  and
then  bring in sponsorship and scientific training, there  is  no
reason  why  we should not win at least five golds  in  the  2004
Olympics," he says.

"From  a  very  young age you have to aim for  the  sky,"  says
Vijay,  who was recently elected to the Board of the Tennis  Hall
of Fame at Newport, Rhode Island.

Quickly  the  conversation  veers towards his  pet  project,  the
Britannia  Amritraj  Trust programme. And Vijay says  that  "BAT
cannot always be the answer. It is only an example, a  yardstick.
Others have to follow."

He  is happy that BAT has moved to its own facility at  Mogappiar
on the outskirts of the city. "We'll continue to put in our  bit
but  you can never teach anyone to win. If you ask what  does  it
take to win, the answer is, there is no answer. Some do it better
than the others," he says.

In his time, he did it better than any other Indian of his era.

Film Review: "Subhash"

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 26, Col. e

It  has now become a standard theme for the heroine to  wish  the
hero  to  be a national personality to ask for her hand  and  the
latter  doing  so  in a trice on  the  screen.  Sivasri  Pictures
"Subhash"  is no exception and with that format is included  an
interesting  twist  in  the form of the brother of  the  hero,  a
minister,  being hand in glove with anti-national elements  which
puts the hero in a dilemma to arrive at a decision.

Director  R.  V. Udayakumar, who has displayed  his  flourish  in
dealing with love themes set in rural areas, ventures into  areas
of  action.  His handling suffers to some extent in  the  opening
portion  the  Indian  army  men  are  at  the  receiving  end  in
containing  the infiltrators on the border, only  Col.  Subhash's
line  of  communication being `active'. The viewer is  given  the
impression  that  the  other two wings of the  Indian  team  have
failed  to  stop the aliens. But actually one sees  some  half-a-
dozen  automatic  weapons  carrying  thug  like  persons  running
helter-skelter  in the forest; the hero, with a pistol  on  hand,
goes  bang bang. Then a commander at the  headquarters  announces
`Thank  God, the country has been saved (by Subhash), the  entire
segment  of the dialogue here being mostly in English.  What  had
happened  to  the  other two wings of the Indian  forces  is  not
known.  This  sloppy work of the director is compensated  by  the
good  camera  work of Shiva and the director comes into  his  own
when he moves into the drama of hearts.

As usual it is the timid Shastri girl Savithri (Revathi) for whom
the  hero  Subhash (Arjun) falls in love though he has  a  svelte
shapely  lass Anitha (Monica Bedi) almost begging for  his  love.
Subhash's father (Jai Shankar) is a rich influential lawyer while
his  first  son Rajasekhar (Siddique) is  a  respected  minister.
Rajasekhar  and  his wife (Sudha) treat the hero like  their  own
son. The wooing of Savithri by Subhash gives rise to some  tender
moments  nicely  handled  by  the  director,  particularly   when
Savithri  says she does not love him and asking him to stay  away
from  her,  all told in gentle manner. The timid  nature  of  the
character  is  adequately brought out by Revathi with  her  voice
modulation. She further catches the attention in the scene  where
she  firmly  states that she wants a life partner  who  had  done
something  for the country, making the hero join the  army.  Then
Revathi  is sidelined till the end when the minister's  moves  to
safeguard  his position occupy the frames. Manivannan, the  party
worker with ulterior motives and with a cheeky tongue, cashes  in
on  the  opportunities  in  the  toppling  game  played   between
Rajasekhar  and  his  arch  rival in  politics  but  best  friend
Arumugamy  (Prakashraj). Siddique and Prakashraj are made  up  on
the  same lines and one has to make sure who is going to die  and
who  isn't. Siddique plays the cool customer villain  with  quiet
efficiency.

Arjun shows remarkable agility in the action segments,  indulging
in  clashes  atop  a moving goods train in a  ghat  section,  the
camera  of Shiva again doing the trick and the stunt men  of  the
Subbarayan team essaying the action with vigour. In the  face-to-
face  meeting with his brother on the train Arjun is quite up  to
the task. Monica Bedi is at ease in the romance areas  performing
the dances with elan. (Arjun has rendered a song with Sujatha  in
"Chutti  Ponnu" and all the lyrics for the six songs have  been
written by the director). The other two reasonably good tunes  of
Vidyasagar  are  "Thendral vanthu" (SPB  and  Chitra),  "Mugam
enna" (SPB and Swarnalatha).

The Vadivelu-Vivek comedy is nothing much to enthuse about  while
adequate support is extended by Jai Shankar, Y. Vijaya, Sudha, K.
R.  Vatchala,  Prakashraj,  Hemanth  (the  bogus  swamiyar)   and
Prasanna.

`Mission: Impossible'

Watching  director  Brian de Palma's creations  is  like  piecing
together  a giant jig-jaw puzzle. The way he unfolds  the  drama,
the  close-up, tight editing and the depiction of  incidents  all
make  the  viewer's grey matter work overtime. And if  the  theme
happens to be connected with undercover agents as in  Paramount's
"Mission: Impossible" then the intrigue and suspense will  grip
the viewer till the last.

The  theme  about  double agents is not new  but  the  director's
inimitable  style  of  narration  makes  every  twist  and   turn
engrossing.  Ethan  Hunt's  (Tom Cruise) entire  team  headed  by
veteran  Jim Phelps (Jon Voight) is killed while on a top  secret
mission  to retrieves a list of CIA agents stolen by the bad  man
Golitsyn.  Now Golitsyn wants to steal another list of  the  real
names  of  the agents. The top brass suspects Etham, who  is  the
sole  survivor and he is suspended. The escape of Ethan from  the
posh  aquarium-cum-restaurant  where  he  meets  the  CIA  chief,
Kittridge  (Henry Czerny) is an interesting scene. Ethan goes  to
Jim's  place  to learn the identity of the culprit  and  that  is
where he gets the first clue - "Job: 14," a code connected with
the  Bible - and learns about the dealer Max (Venessa  Redgrave),
an old woman with deadly connections. He makes a deal with her to
get  the identity of the seller of the first list by offering  to
get the second list.

For  this piece of operation, he gets the help of  Krieger  (Jean
Reno)  and Luther (Ving Rhames) and breaks into a  high  security
chamber  of  the  headquarters.  The  trio  escape  the  security
measures  by  entering the chamber  through  the  air-conditioned
duct.

With  the  information  in hand, Ethan  prepares  for  the  final
meeting with Max when a "dead" Phelps makes his appearance. The
unbelievable  happenings atop the fast moving train offer  a  new
experience to the viewers.

Top  Cruise is a co-partner of the movie shot by Stephen H.  Brum
with the special visual effects provided by Industrial Light  and
Music.

India-Film: Humane, down to earth: Vijayalakshmi

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 26, Col. d

Right  from her childhood, she had the burning desire to  act  in
films.  Born into an indigent agriculturist's family of Eluru  in
Andhra  Pradesh  Vijayalakshmi knocked at the  doors  of  several
producers  before she bagged a couple of roles in Malayalam.  Her
persistence  paid  off  when  she  was  cast  in  a  Tamil  film,
"Vandichakram" directed by K. Vijayan. Overnight  Vijayalakshmi
became a star with a new name `Silk' Smitha.

There  was no looking back for Smitha after  "Vandichakram".  A
dance number by her became mandatory in almost all Tamil films. A
song  with Kamal Hassan in AVM's "Sagalakalavalavan"  became  a
big  hit and boosted her popularity immensely. She acted  as  the
heroine in four films - "Silk Silk Silk" and "Police  Police"
in Tamil and "Veeravikram" and "Premachesudu" in Telugu. When
she was riding the crest of a success wave, two films produced by
her bombed at the box office.

A  frustrated Smitha quit acting in films for two years. She  re-
entered the film industry through Maniratnam's "Geetanjali".
Smitha   was  a  humane  person.  Every  year,  on  Pongal,   she
distributed free clothes to the poor. Her views on marriage  were
firm.  She once said that no one would be interested in  marrying
her. "He may ask me why I wear this dress and that. As far as  I
am  concerned, marriage is not for me. So I am not interested  in
it."  Her biggest regret in life was the film she produced.  "I
did  the biggest blunder in my life by producing films. I do  not
know  anything about production. But I produced three  films  and
lost what I had earned through acting."

India-Music: A mesmeric touch: Sanjay Subramaniam

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 27, Col. a

SVK  on  a  concert where there was enough  musical  material  to
tickle the admiration of listeners.

In  the  concert  by Sanjay  Subramaniam  for  the  Maharajapuram
Viswanatha Iyer Trust, the joy he created in the alapana and song
was  a palpable entity. His imagination was not vitiated  by  the
usual intellectual mechanism. Massive in manodharma, energetic in
exposition, sumptuous in sensitivity and replete with  refinement
his  Bhairavi raga alapana brimmed with  fascinating  sentiments.
The  values  he  cherished  in  elaborating  the  raga  made  his
presentation  first class. He gave primacy to raga swaroopa  even
while  sticking to present day cutcheri formulations.  There  was
enough  musical  material  in  it to  tickle  the  admiration  of
listeners.  The  characteristic feature of his technique  is  his
lesser  desire  to please the rasikas by the voice  than  by  the
grandeur of the raga structure.

Sanjay  Subramaniam believes in an assertive salesmanship of  his
musical  wares.  In the very first song `Vallabha  Nayakasya'  in
Begada, the pace and punch were overpowering. He gave a  mesmeric
touch  to  this  song  and the  others  `Kartigeya'  (Thodi)  Oh!
Rajeevaksha  (Aarabhi) and "Upacharamulanu"  (Bhairavi).  There
was ostentation and pomp in the way he rendered the kirtanas, but
refinement in approach made for their instant appeal. The Aarabhi
raga  alapana glistened with elegant sancharas. While  diligently
eschewing  obesity in vinyasa, the delineation looked  aggressive
with  the janta sancharas, a distinguishing label, gaining  great
prominence  at  his hands. The Bhairavi  coming  immediately  was
couched  in  salubrious  tenderness. Perhaps  the  very  mood  of
Bhairavi  induced  him to soften his voice  particularly  in  the
sthayi  range  when he emphasised the beauteous light  and  shade
manoeuvres. Sriram Kumar on the violin had not much difficulty in
framing the alapana lines of Aarabhi and Bhairavi because  Sanjay
earlier had laid the highway well and truly. The movement of  the
sancharas  was smooth and the low modulation made  his  rendering
soft  and  flexible. Arun Prakash as  the  mridangam  accompanist
contributed to firmness of percussive support without sacrificing
the gentleness of laya's place in a concert.

In the 5 O'Clock session Sasikaran presented his musical training
through  emphasis  on  songs. If Sanjay sought  to  win  audience
appreciation  through Begada, Aarabhi and Bhairavi (all  familiar
ragas)  Sasikaran  somehow seemed to place his  faith  on  Chaya,
Tarangini,   Kannadagowla,  Bhoopalam  and   Chandrajyoti   often
provoking  some members of the audience to ask the vocalist  what
raga  it was. A cutcheri built on such a selection  could  hardly
enthuse the rasikas. Towards the end came Madhyamavati (`Palinchu
Kamakshi')  while  his  presentation of the raga  picture  was  a
scale-model.  B. Gayatri, violinist, played with such  depth  and
delicacy that one could easily differentiate the approach of  the
vocalist  and  the  appeal of the violinist. It  was  a  luminous
Madhyamavati   that  Gayatri  presented,  luxurious   in   loving
sancharas. There was enough expressional maturity in her handling
of  the  raga. Sasikaran sang "Sri Maha Ganapathe"  (Abhogi,  a
composition  of N. S. Ramachandran) "Kripa joo chutaku"  (Chaya
Tarangini)   `Orajoopuchu'  (Kannada  Gowla)   `Sadaachaleswaram'
(Bhoopalam)  and "Bhagyanayya" (Chandrajyoti).  Familiar  ragas
and songs are the surest and easiest way to woo rasika attention.
J.  Balaji  was  the mridangam accompanist who  nursed  his  role
competently.

Being brought up in an atmosphere of excellent musical  tradition
gives a head start to a young aspirant like Master Ramprasad, the
grandson of Palghat Mani Iyer. Striving to live up to the demands
of  such a tradition requires not merely well-learnt songs,  raga
alapana techniques and swaraprasthara methods. These are  aspects
of  music  that  many youngsters in the  field  today  are  quite
conversant with and climb the dais with confidence. But only when
the  most  elusive  feature of refinement  in  interpretation  is
achieved,  the advantages of an ennobling traditional  atmosphere
can  be  said  to have conferred noteworthy  excellence.  In  the
absence of such refinement, music becomes formula-ridden.
Singing  for  Raga  Tarangini  the  performing  style  of  Master
Ramprasad gave rise to these thoughts. He has memorised the songs
well  and presenting them to the audience with competence he  put
his claim to due recognition on that score. He seems to feel that
a  stepped-up  kalapramana  to  songs  contributes  to   cutcheri
liveliness.  In  that attempt, in singing fast  sangatis  or  the
second kala swaras he bit more than he could chew. Each  avartana
of  the  second  kala swara to the  songs  "Chani  Todi  Theve"
(Harikambhoji)  "Tulasidala" (Mayamalavagowla)  and  "Ennaganu
Rama  Bhajana" (Pantuvarali) was a race to the  starting  point.
The  same  haste  was  to be noticed  in  the  mel  kala  neraval
passages.  Nowadays  cutcheries  centre mainly  round  these  two
segments  of swara and raga speeds. Ramprasad too seems  to  have
fallen  into  this trap. With many years before him he  would  do
well  to gradually understand that visranti is the atman of  good
music. Pantuvarali raga lines were okay, but the Mukhari  alapana
attempt  was not so satisfying. Mukhari and Begada are two  ragas
whose  scales  alone do not bring out their beauty.  One  has  to
sense  a  feel  of the ragas. "Emani Ne"  was  the  kirtana  in
Mukhari.  T.  R. Rajamani kept his role of a  violin  accompanist
well  both  in raga alapanas, neraval and swaras.  Ganapathi  Ram
playing  on  the mridangam gave lustrous  support  through  well-
nourished korvais and cross-beats to embellish the songs.

India-Music: Marked by refinement: Neyveli R. Santhanagopalan

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 27, Col. a

With  his  artistic  talents  directed  strenuously  towards   an
intuitive  search for and interpretation of the features  of  the
classical  music of the South in a state of old time  excellence,
Neyveli  R. Santhanagopalan succeeded in sustaining the  interest
of  an appreciative audience. Featured by Tambaram Music Club  at
Sita Devi Garodia Hindu Vidyalaya Higher Secondary School in East
Tambaram,  his vocal recital gave much satisfaction to lovers  of
serious music.

The  vocalist's  involvement  in conveying the  contents  of  his
recital  in a reasonably refined style was discernible  right  in
his  faithful  execution  of  the  opening  piece,  the   varnam,
`Viriboni'  in Bhairavi set to ata tala. His exposition  of  this
monumental  varnam  with concentration on the projection  of  its
classical  strength  evoked keen listening. Though  he  chose  to
render  the first line of his extempore swaras for this piece  in
the  slow  tempo with an earnestness to extend  the  raga's  mood
refreshingly  and forcefully, the instinct to engage  himself  in
exciting progression of swaras in the accelerated middle pace had
a sway and made him spurn the slow pace instantly.

Santhanagopalan's  rendition  of the piece,  "Girirajasuta"  of
Tyagaraja  in  Bangala was adequately reflective  of  the  song's
scintillating  musical  setting in a happy mood.  The  piece  was
suffixed  interestingly with a set of colourful swara texts.  The
vocalist's  outline of Panthuvarali had a smart course  with  its
familiar phrases touched upon with a commendable insight into its
swarupa.  The  piece that succeeded it  was  `Aparamabhakthi'  of
Tyagaraja  extended elegantly to an engaging session  of  neraval
and swaras for `Lakshmidevi' etc.

Following  an attractive representation of Marukela of  Tyagaraja
in  Jayanthasri,  Santhanagopalan  presented  a  fairly  detailed
description  of Bilahari with a clear perception of its  Carnatic
identity. The piece, `Sri Chamundeswari' in it came in a pleasing
diction.

Tiruparkadal  S. Veeraraghavan's accompaniment on the violin  was
comfortable. His profile of Bilahari had an enjoyable traditional
flavour.

T.  K.  Murthy offered lively rhythmic support on  the  mridangam
with  powerful  percussion  patterns.  Srirangam  Kannan   played
gleefully on the morsing.

The  veena  recital of Prabhavathi Ganesan featured  by  Tirumala
Tirupati Devasthanams Information Centre at its auditorium in  T.
Nagar on the day of the birth star of Lord Venkateswara formed  a
delightful  display  on  her  accomplishment  as  a  sufficiently
sensitive artiste.

Opening  her  recital with a  tasteful execution of  the  varnam,
`Vanajakshi' (Kalyani, adi tala), she played `Vallabha Nayakasya'
of  Muthuswamy  Dikshitar  in Begada with a zest  to  expose  its
moving  musical  contents through hearty gamakas.  The  artiste's
recital of the piece, `Orajupu' (Kannadagowlai) of Tyagaraja came
in a mellow style of veena artistry.

Her sketch of Panthuvarali was tentative and it was followed by a
convincing  diction of `Aparamabhakthi.' The piece was  completed
with a tidy session of neraval and swaras.

Following an enjoyable exposition of `Kshirasagara' of  Tyagaraja
in  Devagandhari,  the artiste rendered `Manavyala' of  the  same
composer in Nalinakanthi in an agile instrumental version. It was
in  her  detailed delineation of Karaharapriya  that  Prabhavathi
Ganesan revealed the strong foundation laid for her artistry in a
rigorous  school.  The  essential  features  of  this  raga  were
communicated by her in an immensely satisfying emotive mode.  Her
diction of the piece, `Pakkala' (Tyagaraja) in it was neat.
Nanganallur  Sriram  (mridangam)  and  Rajesh  (ghatam)  provided
affable percussion support.

India-Art: Based on Nature: T. C. A. Gopalakrishnan

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 27, Col. c

T.  C. A. Gopalakrishnan was a member of the Madras Art Club  and
learnt painting from artists who were also in the faculty of  the
College  of Arts and Crafts, Madras.

Even  though the Club is no longer functioning he continues  with
his  hobby  in a very keen manner.

All his themes are based on nature and the paintings such as  the
"Serene forest" and "The glowing forest" evoked cool and calm
feelings in the viewer.

Even   when  expressing  abstract  emotions  like   "Suspicion"
Gopalakrishnan   uses  birds  and  animals  to  illustrate   such
feelings.

In all the water colour paintings exhibited recently at the Lalit
Kala  Akademi,  he uses the same style of filling the  area  with
thin  lines of colour using 0 or 00 brushes instead of  giving  a
wash;  of course in the pen and ink drawings - some of  his  were
also  shown  -  this  is a  practice  adopted  by  many  artists.
Gopalakrishnan admitted to using the same technique in oils  too.
His works are pleasing and decorative:

He  has participated in many National exhibitions, and the  shows
of Academy of Fine Arts, Calcutta, Hyderabad Art Society,  Bharat
Kala  Parishad, Hyderabad in which he was  "Highly  commended,"
All India Prints Exhibition, etc.

He  also participated in a camp organised by the Tamil Nadu  Ovia
Nunkalai Kuzhu and his work can be found in the Madras Museum and
private collections.

Dance: Confident display

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 28, Col. d

Sri   Parthasarathy  Swami  Sabha,  the  96  year  old   cultural
institution conducted a dance series recently, featuring artistes
from different schools.

S.  Meera, disciple of S. K. Kameswaran and Saroja, performed  on
one of the evenings, marking her out as a sincere follower of the
Vazhuvoor  tradition. Guru S. K. Kameswaran, gave  vocal  support
for  the  recital  which was conducted by  Mahalakshmi  who  ably
handled the nattuvangam.

Meera  has  a  charming personality  and  very  expressive  eyes.
Technically she scored fairly in the Jatiswaram (Kalyani) and  in
the    following   varnam,   "Naadanai   Azhaithu    Vaa"    of
Tiruveezhimizhalai  Sri  Nataraja Sundaram  Pillai.  The  typical
theermanams  of Vazhuvoor school were fulfilled skilfully by  the
dancer.  But her abhinaya one hopes, will improve with  time  and
experience.

Also  there  seemed  a wrong notion  in  her  presentation  that,
throughout  the recital a dancer should keep a pleasant face  and
that  too  with  a full smile always  flashing  the  teeth.  This
appeared  totally  unrelishable, especially when the  dancer  was
emoting  for the lines - "Vedanai Tuyarile" -  meaning  "while
experiencing  the pangs of agony".

A calm face would bring the necessary dignity. The ideas of Bhava
abhinaya,  without  dramatisation or overdramatisation,  and  the
feeling  of sensitive element of divine approach to this  section
of  Bharatanatyam  seem  to  have lost  their  values  when  such
presentations are witnessed.

Earlier  in  "Brochevarevarura"  (Khamas)  scenes  of  Gajendra
Moksha  was  overdramatised. Subtlety is the keynote  to  achieve
skill in abhinaya.

Meera,  on the whole, appeared composed and confident  throughout
the performance.

Neat job by veteran director: "Nerukku Ner"

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 29, Col. a

Seething  with the memories of humiliations and grievances,  they
shun each other, one man's name spelling anathema to the other.
In  `Nerukku Ner', the ultimate confrontation is not between  the
usual duo - friends whose goodwill has soured or brothers who are
deadly enemies. The clash is between an elderly father-in-law and
his  only middle-aged son-in-law. Nursing a deeply felt sense  of
wrong  done, and allowing emotional wounds to fester, they  avoid
each other's company. Until compelled by circumstances and  their
own impulses to forget and forgive, to bridge the gulf.
One  of the few quality plays to be witnessed recently  "Nerukku
Ner"s strength was the completely natural way in which the story
and  theme was dealt with. Writer K. S. N. Sundar showed  a  good
grasp of human psychology and built up the drama in neat, logical
steps.  Veteran  director K. S. Nagarajan had done  a  fine  job,
handling  the  story  in a crisp, capable  fashion  not  allowing
himself  to  be sidetracked into irksome comedy or  padding.  The
result was wholesome fare that captured the essence of the milieu
it was set in - the Brahmin middle-class - without distortion  or
caricature.

Even  after a quarter century has passed, Raghavachary (K. S.  N.
Sundar)  rages  at the insults heaped on him  by  his  son-in-law
Varadarajan  (V.  Chandru)  years  ago. When  his  only  son  and
daughter-in-law perished in an accident, Raghavachary had  sought
refuge for his year old orphaned grandson, in Varadarajan's home.
The   son-in-law  ordered  him  out  as  he   held   Raghavachary
responsible  for his mother's heartbreak and  death.  Varadarajan
also forbids his wife Vaidehi from having anything to do with her
father.

Determined  to cope on his own, Raghavachary, a widower,  manages
to bring up his grandson. At 25, Madhavan (Akshay Kumar) is now a
smart  executive  and the apple of his  grandfather's  eye.  When
Vaidehi  (S. P. Srimathi) seeks to get her daughter  Mala  (Indu)
married  to  Madhavan  using her son Mukundan (G.  Arun)  as  go-
between,  Raghavachary opposes the match tooth and nail. So  does
Varadarajan.

After  attempts to fix up matches elsewhere for the girl  by  her
father fizzle out, the two antagonists finally meet. And sundered
ties are mended and harmony is restored in the family.

The  play owed its vitality to the excellent acting by  the  lead
artistes.  Sundar was matched in word and gesture by Chandru  and
together they kept the two decade enmity at full steam.  Srimathi
as  the  one who feels unhappy and frustrated  by  the  obstinate
attitude of husband and father, put in a convincing  performance,
her  face  reflecting  her anxiety well.  Her  nine-yard  costume
wrapped around her Egyptian mummy-like struck the only artificial
note  in the drama. Indu, the obedient daughter and Arun  as  her
rational  elder brother filled the bill. Akshay Kumar,  the  duty
conscious, affectionate grandson is the same in every play -  not
for  him  the  nuances of a character  or  slight  variations  in
portrayal.  Ramji who played the portly officer who does his  bit
in aiding the reconciliation, was adequate.

A  delightful portrayal was put in by V. Ramani as  Rangudu,  the
little-educated next door youth who makes it big in the political
scene.  His astute questions (on economic liberalisation,  hawala
deals  and benami) and answers were pertinent statements  on  the
contemporary  scene,  and  also  lightened  the  atmosphere.  The
success of the characterisation was largely due to the casual and
natural delivery of the lines by Ramani who made the absurd sound
plausible.

The  play  sagged in the middle with the `I hate him'  and  `Mala
must marry Madhu' incantation becoming tiresome; a little editing
would help.

The  manner in which the foes make up in the end, each  eager  to
apologise to the other and take on the blame was true to life.
Sadly,  for  a  good effort there were hardly 25  people  in  the
Mylapore  Fine Arts Club auditorium where Kala Nilayam  presented
the drama under the auspices of Sri Parthasarathy Swami Sabha.

World record break by Russell: Causier pips Gilchrist at the post

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 22, Col. a

By G. Viswanath

MUMBAI, Sept. 26.

Fifty-eight seconds ...59... seconds and bang. The finishing  and
triumphant  stroke  was rammed in by David Causier  in  the  last
second. It was sudden death for 1994 World professional champion,
England's Peter Gilchrist. It was akin to a last ball finish in a
cricket match.

The  cue  ball  (white) was close at hand  and  the  object  ball
(yellow) perched at the mouth of the top right hand pocket begged
to be sunk in. But the clock could have beaten the young Causier.
The  18-year-old literally counted the closing seconds  with  his
eyes  on the neon clock lights ticking away as fast as his  heart
beat.

"The white (Causier's cue ball) stopped at 1 hr 58 seconds and I
hit  it," said Causier who, after playing the finishing  stroke,
marched towards Gilchrist in a jiffy with an extended right hand.
Gilchrist  could not believe he had lost the  quarterfinals,  but
the  cruel reality was that he was beaten by a quirk of  fate  in
the Gold Flake World professional billiards championship here  on
Thursday.

Sethi to meet Shandilya

Top-notcher Mike Russell embellished his comfortable 2391-821 win
over  Devendra  Joshi with a world record break of  753  compiled
under  the  baulkline rule. Russell will take on Causier  in  the
semifinal on Friday. Three-time champion Geet Sethi shrugged  off
his first session diffidence to get past Chris Shutt in the  last
of  the  quarterfinals.  Sethi  plays  Shandilya  in  the  second
semifinal.

The man to mark is Russell who was the first cueist to break  the
500-barrier in the championship. He smashed a 676 against  Mukesh
Rehani  in  the first round. Russell's skill was evident  in  the
first  session  when he carved out three century  breaks  in  the
first  session, including the 291 on his 27th visit.  He  started
the second with a 148 and then firmly placed himself on top table
to amass 753 in less than three quarters of an hour. The previous
best was his 713 against Sethi in the British Open. It was a one-
sided affair all the way with Joshi making two century breaks  of
133 and 120.

Sethi,  playing on the disputed table with a coarse  cloth,  came
into  his  own in the second session. Down by 39  points  at  the
interval,  Sethi carved out two big breaks of 183 and 190 to  eke
out a win by 331 points.

Last  year in the qualifier at Leeds, Causier was beaten  by  the
clock and Gilchrist scraped through by four points. A year  later
the story was reversed in a classic quarterfinal match watched by
a capacity crowd.

In  another quarterfinal, Ashok Shandilya, trailing  behind  Alok
Kumar by 251 points after the first two-hour session, turned  the
heat on his opponent in the second session to win 1402-1178.
The  match between Causier and Gilchrist on Thursday never  threw
the  prospect of a humdinger. Causier, playing with a  free  mind
and  with  a  fixity of purpose, began with  a  197.  Three  more
century  breaks of 115, 164 and 109 put him ahead at 766-369  and
it  seemed Causier was determined to deal the knock-out punch  to
Gilchrist. But the 1995 world champion showed splendid resilience
with a masterly 244.

Gilchrist  was far from his best in the first 30 minutes  of  the
second  session,  but moved into top gear from  his  10th  visit.
Causier slammed a 193 and collected two more breaks of 86 and  92
to  lead by 269 points. Gilchrist hit back with a 210 to  whittle
down  the  lead and the match was really opening up.  There  were
exactly 6 minutes and 40 seconds left when Gilchrist came for his
last  visit and all he needed was 104 points. While Causier  kept
chewing away at his fingernails, Gilchrist moved on to top table.
Gilchrist  was focussed and he measured every shot. Referee  Ajay
Rastogi's baulkline warning at 80 reminded Gilchrist that he  had
after  all an encumbrance to meet before playing a shot  at  100.
His  hand ball crossed the baulkline on effecting a red  pot  and
the  immediate target was 104 which he met in seconds. The  crowd
applauded and Gilchrist thought he had already gone past 104.  He
looked  at the clock and wasted a few seconds. At exactly 1  hour
55  seconds he bent low to play a thin in-off on the object  ball
(white) with the red on spot. He missed contact.

Three  seconds left and Causier got the godsend  opportunity  for
survival in the championship. He rammed his cue in a split second
to sink the yellow. He got the crucial two points which made  all
the  difference  and helped him progress to the  semifinals.  The
verdict  was clear. "The beep went off after Causier struck  the
ball.  We saw it on the replay on the television monitor,"  said
an official. "I don't want to play another match like this...  I
feel  sorry for Peter, " trailed off Causier making the sign  of
the cross.

Alok  Kumar,  the  surprise packet of the  championship,  was  in
control in the first two-hour session. "I was hitting the  wrong
sides - the in-offs and canons - in the first session. I did  not
get  my rhythm. But in the second everything went right, "  said
Shandilya after his win. Shandilya recovered with breaks of  169,
76,  54, 96 and 85. But it was a 198 on his 12th visit which  put
him ahead of Alok Kumar for the first time in the match. And a 94
proved  to be the clincher. Alok Kumar made a 127 in  the  second
session, but nerves played on him in the last 30 minutes.
The  results: David Causier (Eng) 1432 (197, 115, 164, 109,  193)
bt  Peter  Gilchrist  (Eng)  1430 (110,  244,  210,  104);  Ashok
Shandilya  (Ind)  1402 (120, 169, 198) bt Alok Kumar  (Ind)  1178
(104, 102, 127); Geet Sethi (Ind) 1496 (126, 111, 183, 125,  190)
bt  Chris  Shutt 1165 (102, 204); Mike Russell (Eng)  2391  (117,
182, 291, 148, 753, 132) bt Devendra Joshi (Ind) 821 (133, 120).
Final to be telecast live

Doordarshan will telecast live the final slated for Saturday  at.
The telecast begins at 2-20 p.m. on the National network (DD  1),
according to a Doordarshan press release on Thursday.

Sleek and modern

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 29, Col. d

You may be a writer, a designer, an architect or an engineer. You
may  also  have a table to work on. But the moment  you  want  to
work,  you conveniently shift all your accessories to the  dining
table  where  spreading  everything  from  paper  and  pencil  to
reference items is easy. Lack of space prevents you from buying a
table as big as a dining table for your study. So the only option
available  is  a change in the work area,  and  unfortunately  it
happens quite too often.

It  is  for  such professionals that Nirja  Lath  of  Jaipur  has
designed  a special kind of utilitarian and space saving  writing
table. The table has all the small utility spaces and drawers  to
keep books, writing things, pins, papers, etc. The long table top
fixed  temporarily  to  the tall structure  can  be  pulled  down
whenever one needs large work area, and once the table comes down
one has plenty of space to spread sheets of paper, draw, write or
do whatever one wants to.

Many  in  Madras might have seen the space  saving  furniture  of
Nirja Lath at the Central Cottage Industries Emporium in  Madras.
Her  designs  are unconventional and very modern.  Naturally  her
target  customers are the modern day urban Indians whose life  is
extremely  fast  paced, who live in small houses but  would  like
keep  them  elegant,  neat and orderly.  None  of  the  furniture
designed  by her has any frills, ornamentation or  grandeur,  but
look dignified, in harmony with the present day world. There is a
quiet  smoothness in their lines, a rhythmic and fluent  flow  in
their curves and a clarity in their finish.

You might be involved in your work when your baby is crawling all
over the room and trying to overturn whatever she can cling onto.
At  least for a while, you can keep her amused with some toys  in
the chair designed by Nirja. There is a box like structure  which
can accommodate the chair inside in case of such emergencies. And
as  the child grows up, this structure can be turned sideways  so
that  it  becomes  the little one's eating  table,  or  even  her
drawing  and  studying  table. Of course  the  chair  which  once
trapped her can be hers to sit in front of the table. This is one
of the most innovative and attractive designs in the show.
A stylisitically created cot which is just a few inches high from
the  floor  looked  extremely restrained in its  lines,  and  can
provide  grace  to  a child's room. The  child  can  roll  around
without  the fear of getting hurt on falling down from  the  cot.
The back rest of the cot has adequate space where the mother  can
store  bed  sheets,  pillow covers,  etc.,  without  wasting  the
precious space inside an almirah.

The piece-de-resistance was the dressing table cum clothes  stand
cum  cupboard.  It  is said to be fastest moving  item  on  show.
Another  item which looks very simple and plain is a divan  whose
head  rest can be raised when you want to rest and enjoy a  movie
on the television, and later on it can be lowered to function  as
a cot also. A useful item for avid television watchers who prefer
the lying down position to the sitting position!

"We  haven't provided any fine work which can attract  dust,  so
cleaning  or dusting the furniture is not a big problem  for  the
urban  working  woman. Even though there is a  great  demand  for
ornamental  furniture these days, we saw a lot of interest  among
people  in  the  kind  of space  saving  furniture  that  we  are
offering," one of the organisers said.

An  exhibition of these stylish designer furniture  organised  by
Akar Prakar of Jaipur was on show at the Vimonisha Art gallery.

Lanka scores a convincing win

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 22, Col. e

By S. R. Suryanarayan

DOHA, Sept. 26.

Sri  Lanka ended its campaign with a 3-0 win over Philippines  in
the  FIFA World Cup Asian Zone group 10 qualifying tournament  at
the Khalifa Stadium here tonight.

Roshan  Perera (two) and Chaminda Steinwell were the scorers  for
the Lankans who led 1-0 at the half-way stage.

The  Filipinos  also finished their engagement with  their  third
defeat.  The  new  comers  to the  World  Cup  qualifying  phase,
Filipinos had a nightmarish experience, conceding as many as  ten
goals in their three matches and not having scored any.
Tonight  the  team  had a chance or two  to  score,  but  clearly
finesse was missing when most needed.

Sri  Lanka now awaits India's match tomorrow to know  whether  it
will be placed second or third finally in the league table.  With
a win and a draw to its credit, the team has four points.
This  has  been  a tournament devoid  of  public  interest.  Even
matches involving Qatar did not attract fans. So today it was not
a surprise to see a near empty stadium for what essentially was a
match  of only academic interest.  Both the teams are out of  the
race.

The  interest if anything was only is seeing whether  Philippines
would be able to gain its first point or whether Sri Lanka  would
be  able  to pump in many goals, something that could  stand  the
island  nation in good stead in case there is a tie for a  second
place with India.

Expectedly,  the  Sri  Lankan attack looked  lot  more  incisive,
something  that was to energise the handful of Lankan  supporters
who were quick to begin their cheering efforts.

Roshan  Perera and Antony  Silva had Chaminda Stenwell  today  to
add  sharpness  to the Lankan offensive. The  Filipinos  held  on
precariously  with  goalkeeper  Edmundo looking  totally  out  of
sorts. He nearly messed up a straight forward collection of a try
by  Silva and conceded a flag kick. Silva took the kick from  far
side and Chaminda rifled his header perfectly to beat the crowded
defence for the Lankan breakthrough.

It  must be said that the Filipinos were not mere  spectators  in
this match. There were attempts to make combined moves,  inspired
by  Eduardo  from the middle. As usual Viliran and  Lobaton  shot
ahead showing good speed to cause concern in the Lankan  defence.
Viliran  once did essay a crisp waist-high shot, but straight  to
goalkeeper Lalith Weerasinghe.

But  what  almost undid the Lankan joy was the run by  the  rival
captain  Vincente in a flash counter attack. The  Lankan  defence
had  advanced  too far to check him. Seeing  the  danger,  Lalith
rushed out of the box to challenge Vincente. He succeeded even if
in  the process he conceded a free kick and also earned a  yellow
card for touching the ball outside the penalty area.

It was a lucky escape for Sri Lanka, nonetheless.

Play  became lot more pedestrian after the change of ends.  This,
despite the Filipinos success now in working a few positive moves
engineered by Vincente and Edurardo.

This  was  the  first occasion when the Filipinos  were  able  to
exhibit  a  bit  of their ball skills. But  the  enthusiasm  thus
worked  up  finally gave way to trouble at its own  end.  A  long
clearance  from  Dudley Steinwall saw Roshin rushing  ahead  with
none  really to challege him. A quick trapping and placement  saw
Roshan getting the second goal.

Another  phase of dullness followed before Sri Lanka  earned  the
gift of a spot kick when Talavera used his hands to stop a  Silva
try.  Roshan converted to help Sri Lanka record its best  win  in
this tournament.

It  was  yet  another day of  poor  refereeing.  The  Kazhakistan
official, Ordabaev, allowed several fouls to go unnoticed.

Unusual combinations

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 30, Col. d

Marien Mathew visits a restaurant where one can enjoy the food of
his choice  watching his favourite star in action.

Visualise  this.  It  is  the year  2000.  After  long  extensive
research,  scientists  have made a pathbreaking  discovery.  They
have  identified the genes that make Tamilians so susceptible  to
films.  Yes,  it  has  to be in the  genes.  There  is  no  other
explanation  for the incomparable effect the celluloid magic  has
on us.

Elsewhere  in  the  world  when  media  experts  talk  about  the
potential  of the visual medium we already have a list  of  Chief
Ministers to prove the point. Here in Tamil Nadu the stars,  ones
on the silver screen not the astral variety, have more  influence
on ordinary, mortal beings.

So how about celebrating it? Let us succumb to the spell of those
lavishly  mounted  glittering sets, where the  hero  and  heroine
prance  about  singing  songs,  a  practice  continued  from  the
pioneering days of S. S. Vassan and A. V. Meyyappa Chettiar.  The
Taramani  Talkies  is  all  about this.  The  restaurant  in  the
premises  of MGR film City takes care of your  entertainment  and
food.

The  ambience is unmistakable. You have to walk past  the  ticket
counter  or  reception to the multi-cuisine restaurant.  The  big
screen  showing  the  hero and the heroine  gyrating  to  a  song
dominated  the  room. Isn't this bliss, watching  your  favourite
actor/actress and enjoying the food of your choice. The  Taramani
Talkies  offers Indian and Chinese food, while the Baalcony,  the
rooftop section has Chettinad cuisine alone.

The  Baalcony,  opened a few months ago, doesn't have  any  filmi
frills.  The  only  embellishment is the sky, the  moon  and  the
stars,  that  is  if  it is a clear night.  The  brief  menu  was
predominantly non-vegetarian.

Though  two  soups  are  mentioned in the  menu,  both  were  not
available. For the maincourse, there were Kallu Dosa, Idli, Appam
and  Idiyappam,  very much the homefare. The  Idiyappams  (string
hoppers)  were  as soft too as the homemade ones. One  is  a  bit
apprehensive  about  ordering idiyappams at restaurants  as  more
often than not, they come dry. Then no amount of soaking in gravy
make their journey down the throat easy.

What  makes Chettinad cuisine so interesting is its not so  usual
combinations.  Idli and dosa, which make the very  foundation  of
South Indian vegetarian food, acquire non-vegetarian flavour also
here. So besides Sambar and Chutney, we have Mutton Kola  Urundai
Kozhambu  or Chettinad Kozhi or Meen Varuval as side dishes.  The
result  is,  if the crisp, thin light brown dosa,  hot  from  the
tava,  is  irresistible with sambar, it becomes a  knockout  when
touched  up  with  meaty/fish flavour. The  Baalcony  has  Mutton
Kheema Dosa and Prawn Dosa to substantiate the point.

Chettinad  Cuisine  comes  from the royal  kitchens  of  merchant
princes,  the  Chettiars.  The key word here  is  royal,  for  it
explains the characteristic richness of this culinary style.  The
wedding feasts of the Nagarathar Community are almost  legendary.
On  these occasions which run into days, the guests are feted  by
exemplary food and excellent music and dance.

Aattukal Paya, a rather mild mutton curry with coconut milk, went
well  with  the  idiyappams. Varutha Kozhi also  was  nice.  What
struck one most was the meagre inclusions of vegetarian dishes on
the  menu. There was only one semi-fried mixed  vegetables  dish,
vegetable  Chettinad  which  had  at  least  something   remotely
Chettinad about it. The other vegetarian items listed on the menu
were  Mulagutawny  Soup,  which  is of  British  Raj  origin  and
vegetable Kuruma.

But  at  the end of the meal, when you get a bill  of  less  than
three   hundred  bucks  for  a  couple  who  is  bothered   about
authenticity and lack of choice? And the food is quite nice too!

Specialist openers, need of the hour

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 22, Col. d

By R. Mohan

TORONTO, Sept. 26.

Life's  journey from celebrated years as the well feted whiz  kid
to  middle  age can be very long. It is, perhaps,  the  curse  of
Sachin  Tendulkar  that  the experience of life,  like  his  lost
childhood, should be so compressed.

In  terms  of  cricket, he has already attained  middle  age.  If
anyone wishes to pick an argument about that, it is quite  likely
he  may not have seen the stony expression on the skipper's  face
when  he  went up to receive the loser's cheque in  the  deciding
game of the Sahara Cup on Monday.

"It was disappointing," he said in a kind of under statement at
the press conference. "We were very confident about chasing  214
but   we  could  not,"  he  said.  A  dead  giveaway  that   the
vicissitudes  of the captaincy are catching up with him  even  as
expectations turn into disappointments so quickly.

The captaincy, much like the rose, comes with the thorns. But  he
hardly  needs to blame himself so much because had the toss  gone
the  other way it was likely that the match and the Cup may  have
gone the other way, too.

The toss matters a lot on wearing pitches because chasing on them
is never going to be fun. His predecessor learnt a bitter  lesson
at  the Eden Gardens and Sachin accepted that the most  important
thing  he  learnt from the Sahara Cup is chasing is  never  easy.
Leaving  aside  for the moment the matter of chasing  or  setting
targets, let us examine where India really went wrong.

Notwithstanding the desire to be tactically flexible, the team is
erring  in  believing  the batting order  is  everything.  Sachin
himself  may  have brought about a seminal event in  opening  the
innings at the Eden Park in Auckland two years ago. But he should
know by now that changes in the batting order form only a part of
tactical innovativeness.

Results should be more even irrespective of the batting order  or
the availability or absence of leading batsmen through injury  or
disciplinary action as in the famous case of Navjot Sidhu.
A  32-16-2 (win-loss-no result) head-to-head record in favour  of
Pakistan  in  one-day  Internationals  exists  despite  all   the
tinkering  with the batting order that captains and their  think-
tanks have done over the years.

The  problem  right  now for India is the absence  of  a  regular
opening  partner for Sachin Tendulkar. It is another matter  that
it should not be assumed that Sachin should always be the  opener
in  the  limited-overs game. Such a  supposition  also  militates
against tactical flexibility.

This may be solved when Sidhu can return to the side in time  for
the  triangular  series  in the middle of  next  month.  But  the
selectors,  the  captain and whoever constitutes  his  think-tank
then should decide straightaway that the need for a specialist to
do this job is very urgent.

It is possible to compromise on the opening slot in home  cricket
where the fastest bowlers, be they white, black or brown, are  so
defeated by the conditions that they can be rendered pathetically
ineffectual.  But  the moment the Indian team  steps  abroad  and
comes across unfamiliar pitches, any tactical change of the order
can get horribly undone.

For  instance, Mongia is never likely to succeed  against  clever
fast bowlers like Wasim Akram. And Jadeja is unlikely to ever fit
the  role  of an opener again even if he succeeds at the  job  on
flat pitches as he has in Asia.

There  is one simple rule when it comes to opening batsmen.  `And
that  is - `Find specialists'. Don't ever compromise  unless  the
opener is a quality player of the calibre of Sachin Tendulkar who
can cope with the technical demands of playing the new ball  even
when  it comes to adapting oneself to the aggressive way  of  the
one-day game.

What is the point in carrying a Vikram Rathore in the squad if he
is  not  to  be used even in the one-day game.  Whatever  be  his
technical weaknesses, he can still cope with the requirements  of
the  one-day  game. Use him or Sidhu, not Jadeja, or  Mongia,  or
even Saurav Ganguly even if he is good enough a player of the new
ball to be considered for the job.

The  easy solution to team balance that Manoj Prabhakar  used  to
offer  as opener spoiled the Indian team thoroughly. The  era  of
the  all  rounders  is  well  behind us  now.  There  is  no  use
pretending that every Tom, Dick and Harry is an all rounder until
the  era of the true all-rounder comes again. The solution  would
then lie in giving a run to the specialists like Sidhu and  leave
it  to  them to work out how active they should be in  the  early
overs.

Krish  Srikkanth was a natural at the job of striker. The  nation
is  not going to find too many like him. Pinch hitters at one  or
two drop may fare well enough. But not too many converted openers
can  shine all the time as the specialists like Gordon  Greenidge
and Desmond Haynes did. We do not have to seek far to see why the
West Indians were so great as a one-day team in the days of their
absolute dominance. They always used specialist openers. They did
not believe in sending some hit-and-giggle batsmen in first.
Bring on Sidhu or give Rathore a fair run. But do not  compromise
on  the  opening  slot even in home  cricket  merely  because  it
becomes  convenient  to do so. The number of  times  Kapil  Dev's
promotion in the order failed is reason enough to suggest not all
are equipped to come out and bat first.

It  would  even  make sense to send in  a  quality  batsman  like
Azharuddin  to  open  the innings. But it  would  be  foolish  to
persist with the likes of Jadeja and Mongia.

Mrunalini earns IWM norm

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 22, Col. c

By Arvind Aaron

YEREVAN, Sept. 26.

India's  Mrunalini  Kunte  made her  maiden  International  Woman
Master norm with a quick draw against WGM E. Zayac of Belarus  in
the tenth round of the 32nd Chess Olympiad here at the Sports and
Concert  Complex here today. The Indian women drew  1.5-1.5  with
Belarus.

Mrunalini Kunte, born on December 23, 1973 near Bombay, is a post
graduate  in  Commerce from Pune. She is  the  reigning  national
women's  champion  and should be able to get her other  norms  in
such strong opposition. Mrunalini's real strength in chess is her
ability to draw games against tougher opponents.

Mrunalini  said, "I am happy," as she was filling the form  for
norm  application  this  evening. She spent  the  last  48  hours
calculating  rather  than preparing for the match.  The  off  day
tomorrow would be the time to celebrate.

For  the Indian women IWM Saritha Reddy did the scoring,  beating
A.  Sorokina  in  43 moves with  the  white  pieces.  Bhagyashree
Thipsay  was beaten by untitled T.Zagorskaya in a  Dutch  defence
game.  Bhagyashree lost a pawn with the black pieces and  lost  a
couple more to resign in 44 moves.

India: Madras Stock Exchange online trading inaugurated

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 19, Col. a

MADRAS, Sept. 26.

The  screen-based  trading  on  the  Madras  Stock  Exchange  was
formally inaugurated by Mr. Suresh Krishna, Chairman and Managing
Director, Sundram Fasteners.

Speaking  on the occasion Mr. Suresh Krishna said this  marked  a
new  chapter  for  MSE which had a good carrier in  the  last  60
years.  He wanted the MSE to enter into new areas  of  operations
such as derivative trading.

The  first deal on online trading was put through by selling  100
shares of Sundram Fasteners by Mr. Suresh Krishna at Rs. 700  and
Mr. Prem Sundara Iyengar, President of the MSE was the buyer.
Mr.  Suresh Krishna left a word of caution that only quality  and
prompt delivery schedule would pave the way to success. He  cited
the  examples of multinationals like General Motors and  Ford  in
maintaining quality.

He  said  the  same  accepted business  norms  applied  to  stock
exchanges  and brokers also. He said "we cannot be operating  on
the  same  way  that  we  were  doing  and  have  to  adopt   new
technologies.  It  is  very important  to  build  confidence  and
quality  and without quality and trust stock exchanges  will  not
survive."  He  hoped  the MSE would live up to  its  ability  to
satisfy  the  most discerning customers and Mantrra  would  offer
efficient service to the investors.

Mr. S. Sadagopan, Chief General Manager, Madras Telephones,  said
that  they would be able to complete the job of  providing  lease
lines  in a short time and said the  international  communication
traffic  to  Madras was growing at a fast pace. He was  happy  to
note  that the trading system through leased lines network  would
be  one  of  the largest of such networks  for  mission  critical
applications in the Asia Pacific region.

Earlier, Mr. Prem Sundara Iyengar, President of the MSE said  the
screen-based  trading would be fully operational from  October  7
and appreciated the efforts taken by the members of the  Exchange
and  the  software  professionals involved in the  work  and  the
Madras Telephones in providing the lease lines.

Mr.  Chandra Balaraman, Chairman and Managing Director of  Indigo
Technologies,  which executed the project for  Tandem  Computers,
said  the  system  was very  reliable  with  parallel  processing
facilities.   He   said  TESA   (Tandem   Electronic   Securities
Architecture),  the software, being in use in  several  countries
had been customised by Indigo Technologies for MSE. He added  the
system  based on wide area network using leased lines  was  user-
friendly and cost effective.

Mr. Frank Dorrian, Regional Director of Tandem Computers for Asia
said it was a major step forward in automation of equity  markets
in India.

India-Corporate Results: MAC Industries

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 18, Col. e

MAC  Industries  has  successfully  implemented  the  scheme  for
absorbing MAC Property Development and MAC Civil Engineers  after
getting  the  approval  of the shareholders and  the  High  Court
effective  from April 1, 1995. The working results  for  1995-96,
even  though they include the turnover of the merging  companies,
were  not  satisfactory because of the poor contribution  by  the
aquaculture  division.  The impact of virus disease in  both  the
farm  areas  in Tamil Nadu was so severe that  the  turnover  has
declined  to Rs. 127.41 crores from Rs. 158.11 crores  even  with
the contribution of Rs. 29.78 crores by the two merged  companies
referred to above.

The  gross profit before depreciation and interest  charges  also
dropped  abruptly  to  Rs. 930.96 lakhs from  Rs.  17.61  crores.
Interest  charges  were  lower at Rs. 554.22  lakhs  (Rs.  614.79
lakhs). The sum set aside for depreciation has been raised to Rs.
175.23  lakhs (Rs. 133.34 lakhs). The liability for  taxation  is
lower at Rs. 30 lakhs (Rs. 56 lakhs). The distributable profit is
only Rs. 171.51 lakhs against Rs. 956.27 lakhs.

The directors however have decided to maintain the dividend at 25
per cent, taxable. The prospects for the current year are  viewed
with  optimism. It was possible to maintain the dividend  because
of a larger amount brought in from the previous year. The  amount
required  is  Rs. 370.69 lakhs (Rs. 283.84 lakhs) as  the  equity
shares  issued in 1994-95 are eligible for a  full  distribution.
The  transfer  to  general reserve is Rs.  1  crores  (same)  and
debenture redemption reserve Rs. 165.67 lakhs (Rs. 53 lakhs). The
surplus  carried forward is Rs. 437.73 lakhs against  Rs.  969.73
lakhs brought in which includes Rs. 32.19 lakhs being net surplus
of amalgamated companies.

The paid up equity capital has increased to Rs. 14.82 crores from
Rs.  14.44 crores as a result of the merger while  reserves  were
lower  at Rs. 45.89 crores against Rs. 47.95 crores as the  outgo
in respect of dividend is more than available profits.

The  palm  plantation in Andhra Pradesh  is  making  satisfactory
progress  and an area of 1,025 hectares has been cultivated.  The
palm oil crushing mill has also commenced trial production.

India-Corporate Results: Shalimar Paints

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 18, Col. e

Shalimar Paints has registered a net profit of Rs. 2.09 crores on
a  turnover of Rs. 120.02 crores in the 12 months ended June  30,
1996  against Rs. 1.03 crores and Rs. 107.79 crores  respectively
in 1994-95.

The  gross profit, before depreciation and interest charges,  has
risen to Rs. 11.43 crores from Rs. 10.89 crores. Interest charges
claimed  Rs. 7.35 crores (Rs. 7.29 crores). The amount set  aside
for  depreciation is Rs. 1.99 crores (Rs. 1.09 crores). In  1994-
95, an amount of Rs. 1.48 crores has been provided as bad debts.
The company has projected a net profit of Rs. 5.29 crores in  the
letter of offer when it issued partly convertible debentures on a
right basis. As the powder coating project has been deferred  and
there  was  also an increase in input costs, it could  achieve  a
lower  net  profit  of Rs. 2.09 crores. It  is  stated  that  the
company  has not availed itself of the term loan intended  to  be
raised for the powder coating plant.

India-Corporate Results: BPL Refrigeration

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 18, Col. e

BPL  Refrigeration has been increasing its market share with  the
introduction  of  new  types  of  frost-free  refrigerators   and
increasing production. But for the fire accident in the  existing
factory at Bangalore the working results for the year ended March
31, 1996 would have made even better showing. As there is a  loss
of output for one week due to the accident and also a  slackening
in  growth  momentum  subsequently, it is  anticipated  that  the
progress in 1996-97 will be more impressive. New models also will
be  marketed  and  arrangements  are  being  made  for   complete
designing with engineers getting the requisite training from  the
Japanese collaborators, Sanyo.

Sales  have risen by 63.1 per cent to Rs. 215.96 crores from  Rs.
132.37  crores  and  the gross  profit  before  depreciation  and
interest  charges by 59.2 per cent to Rs. 28.68 crores  from  Rs.
18.02  crores  in 1994-95. Interest charges have spurted  to  Rs.
14.07   crores  (Rs.  6.80  crores).  The  sum  set   aside   for
depreciation  is  Rs. 450.69 lakhs (Rs. 314.89 lakhs).  There  is
again no liability for taxation. The residual profit has risen in
a less pronounced manner (25.1 per cent) to Rs. 10.11 crores from
Rs. 8.08 crores mainly due to heavier burden of interest charges.
The  dividend  has  been  maintained at  20  per  cent,  taxable,
absorbing Rs. 544.44 lakhs (Rs. 468.74 lakhs). The larger  amount
is  due  to  the equity shares allotted to  the  promoters  at  a
premium of Rs. 38.44 per share being eligible for a proportionate
distribution.  The  transfer to general reserve is  Rs.  1  crore
(same)  and debenture redemption reserve Rs. 2.25 crores  (same).
The  surplus  carried  forward is Rs. 378.16  lakhs  against  Rs.
236.38 lakhs brought in.

The  paid up capital has increased to Rs. 29.64 crores  from  Rs.
24.94  crores  as  a result of the allotment of  94  lakh  equity
shares  of Rs. 10 each at the above mentioned premium. These  are
paid  up  to the extent of 75 per cent. Reserves  amount  to  Rs.
87.52  crores after giving effect to the latest  allocations  and
taking  credit  also for the premium on  the  preferential  issue
against Rs. 64.78 crores.

a  larger turnover and net profit despite uncertain and  volatile
money market and tight liquidity situation. The company's focuses
on  consumer  finance  through  its  niche  product  Medipic  and
marketing  of Carpic has paid rich dividends and  this  accounted

India: Procedures for NRI investments simplified

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 18, Col. d

From Our Staff Correspondent

MUMBAI, Sept. 26.

The Reserve Bank of India has further simplified the policies and
procedures  for NRI investments. The present scheme for  100  per
cent   investment  by  NRIs  in  sick  units  will   be   further
liberalised.

The  RBI  will  give general permission for  interest  free  non-
repatriable  loans from NRI relatives for personal  purposes  and
for business activities. Interest free repatriable loans up to  $
2.5  lakhs with a maturity of seven years will be cleared by  the
RBI  automatically. Other cases will continue to be cleared on  a
case to case basis by the RBI.

NRIs/OCBs will be permitted to establish schools and colleges  on
the  same  terms  and  conditions as  a  resident  individual  or
corporate body.

The  existing  40  per cent scheme will  be  abolished.  In  non-
Annexure-III  industries, investments by NRIs/OCBs up to  51  per
cent in companies other than listed companies will be allowed  on
a repatriation basis.

The  condition  regarding  60 per  cent  turnover  from  eligible
activities  for  investment to be eligible under the old  40  per
cent and the proposed 51 per cent scheme will be waived.
NRI  participation in venture capital activity will be  permitted
on  the same terms and conditions as foreign investment  in  this
area.

Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC) and other  housing
finance institutions will be permitted to grant loans to NRIs for
acquisition  or improvement to the existing houses on  terms  and
conditions  as applicable to residents. All information  relating
to NRI or foreign investment will be put on the Internet.

Microbe capable of degrading oil isolated

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 17, Col. a

From Our Special Correspondent

TIRUCHI, Sept. 26.

A  microbe  existing in nature named pseudomonas which  has  been
found to be capable of degrading oil, has been isolated by Mr. P.
Raghavan a research scholar, working under Prof. M. Vivekanandan,
Head  of  Department  of  Bio-technology,  of  the  Bharathidasan
University, after studies for the past 30 months.

Oil  spilling both on land and sea in recent years, has  been  on
the increase, and is posing challenges to the  environmentalists.
Bioremediation  is  considered  to be the most  useful  and  safe
method to deal with oil pollution of any kind in view of the fact
that  it  was  considered to be  most  eco-friendly.

Genetically  engineered  strains though have  been  developed  to
fight  oil spillage, in view of the potential danger involved  in
using  such  methods,  the governments have banned  it.  In  this
context,  the utilisation of such naturally occurring oil  eating
microbes assumes very great importance.

The microbe Pseudomonas Sp was isolated from the oil-contaminated
site. The potential nature of this strain in utilising crude  oil
as  the sole source of energy was investigated. The  isolate  was
found  to degrade oil at 1 to 3% level with an efficiency of  60-
90%.   The  optimal  conditions  for  biodegradation   like   PH,
temperature, PO4, and salinity requirements were also worked out.
The  degree  of  oil biodegradation depends  on  the  quantum  of
emulsifying agent produced by the strain.

When  there was minimum surface tension, the quantum  of  biomass
and   biosurfactant  production  was  maximal  by  the   isolate.
Immobilised cells produce increased amount of biosurfactant.  The
nature  of  biosurfactant  was  identified  as  rhamnolipid.  The
electro-micrograph  of the oil-degrading strain showed  that  the
cells  growing in high concentration of oil, exhibited  a  larger
periplasmic  space and cell membrane evagiation.

The  antibiogram  of the strain also showed tolerance to  Hg  and
phenol.  The conjugation study of this strain with E. Coli  CSH57
revealed  that  the strain has the ability to transfer  only  the
antibiotic resistance and not the oil-degrading character.  Field
trial test involving the adapted microbial strain at oil spillage
site  will  be  a promising approach  which  is  being  currently
investigated.

India: Adult TV channel jinxed?

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 16, Col. e

From Our Special Correspondent

NEW DELHI, Sept. 26.

The much-publicised adult TV channel, "Plus 21", is turning out
to  be a non-starter and its proposed launch on October  1  looks
extremely  unlikely  even as cable operators  are  besieged  with
enquiries about its contents, timings and how it can be accessed.
The  launch,  already  postponed several times,  may  be  delayed
further  for  a host of reasons,  including  non-availability  of
hardware  and two court cases seeking a ban on the channel  under
obscenity  laws. Sources in the cable industry say even  software
is not ready, and even if the channel takes off in a few weeks it
would  not be able to offer the full range of programming it  has
been promising.

At  least  three film-makers have contested the  channel's  claim
that they are making programmes for it and accused it of misusing
their names. Film Director B. R. Ishaara has denied making even a
single episode of "Kamasutra", which the "Plus-21" channel is
advertising as his creation.

Film actress and Director Neena Gupta too has dissociated herself
from  the  serial and expressed surprise that her name  is  being
used  to promote the channel. According to her, she was asked  to
make the serial but midway she fell out with the channel and  has
nothing  to  do with it now. Another Director, Ajit  Dewani,  has
accused  the  channel  of  illegally  appropriating  his   serial
"Abhinetri."

This  is  India's  first  own  "adult"  TV  channel  and  cable
operators  are  not  quite  sure if  they  can  beam  it  without
violating  the  Cable TV Regulation Act  1994,  which,  prohibits
telecasting any programme that "offends good taste or decency".
The sort of steamy stuff, it has promised, has already provoked a
strong  reaction  with  voluntary  organisations  threatening   a
nationwide agitation.

Council threatens stir

The National Consumer Awareness Council, which represents over 80
voluntary bodies, has gone to court and said it would take to the
streets  if the channel is allowed to go on air.  Besides,  cable
operators   in   some  cities  have  been  cautioned   by   local
"watchdogs"  and  according to the Federation of  Indian  Cable
Operators' associations, which represents 25,000 operators across
the country, its members are very reluctant to take chances.
"We  will not beam the channel unless we have the  equipment  to
trap its signal so that it is restricted to those homes which ask
for  it. Once we have this equipment we would give a code to  the
subscriber  so that he can lock the channel to  prevent  children
watching it", says Ms. Roop Sharma, president of the federation.
Unless  cable operators are able to "isolate" the  channel  and
restrict its use to individuals who have the code, it would be  a
free-to-air channel which once beamed by a cable operator can  be
seen  by  anyone. Major cable distributors such as  Hindujas  and
Siticable are also reluctant to "risk" the ire of those who are
opposed to "invasion" of their privacy.

According to the promotional material distributed by the  channel
it  would  be  on the air for four hours  every  night  (10  p.m.
onwards)  and would feature "adult jokes, sex news,  titillating
music, adult songs, adult comedies and serials such as Kamasutra,
Redlight,  Ek  Aur Silsila, Samjhauta, Brothel and  Bhog  Se  Yog
Tak". It has also claimed that it would "prominently  feature"
advertisements of "adult stuff".

Cable  operators  say  such  advertising  on  an  Indian  channel
violates the advertising code which they are expected to  follow.
They can also be hauled up for telecasting programmes which  have
not been censored as required under the Cinematograph Act.
A  senior executive of the channel has, however, denied  that  it
proposes  to air nudity and pointed out that in any case some  of
the programmes on foreign TV networks beamed to Indian homes  are
not fit for family viewing.

Even  as the channel appears to be in trouble even before it  has
kicked  off,  there  is a sense of anticipation  among  the  more
curious  viewers  whose appetite has been whetted  by  the  media
hype.

persona on the small screen? Renuka Shahane lights up the  entire
viewing  room  with her vivacious screen presence, be it  in  the
much-appreciated  "Surabi"  (with Siddharth Kak) or  the  much-
watched  "Antakshari" (with Annu Kapoor). Renuka is  now  being
seen more and more in serials too. You just cannot miss her on TV
any  given day of the week. She is "to hand" on one channel  or
another.

"To  think it has all come to me unsought!" notes Renuka, as  I
come face to face with this blithe spirit of the small screen  at
her Shivaji Park home in the Dadar sector of Mumbai. But whatever
is the matter, Renuka is not, right now, her known spirited self?
She  is  out  of sorts because she is nursing  a  rather  painful
abscess.  I  encountered  her a couple  of  weeks  before  Ganesh
Chaturthi.  And  the young lady is, literally, waiting  for  Lord
Ganesa to come and go, so as to be able to get rid of the pain in
which she obviously is.

"I  have  to be careful not in any way to upset my  tight  work-
schedule  in planning to go through the minor  surgery  needed,"
she  points out. "Therefore, this surgery has willy-nilly to  be
on Ganpati immersion day, the day when we busy stars at last  get
24 hours off."

She  had braced herself for the mini-ordeal ahead and is  not  in
the  ideal  frame  of mind to answer my query  about  why  Renuka
Shahane seems to be doing only a handful of serials while others,
who  came after her, look to be much busier. I put the  point  to
her,  none  the less, and Renuka takes it in her  petite  stride,
explaining  why,  if  she  is lagging behind,  she  is  doing  so
studiedly.

"I am not very ambitious by way of quantity, it is purely out of
choice I have restricted myself," says Renuka. "According to my
lights,  "too  much"  is not the yardstick by  which  a  viewer
should  be judging a performer's calibre. I would rather be  seen
in well-defined roles, in a few well-made serials, than be viewed
in  every  other tele-offering, frantically running from  set  to
set.

"It is important for me to be seen "doing" things in a  serial
as a character rather than be merely appearing in it. That is the
reason  I left "Yeh Huyi Na Baat." My character in it  was  not
developing  at  all, it seemed to be getting me nowhere.  On  the
other hand, I have enjoyed doing Kishan Sethi's "Ghutan,"  even
if  all  the  major roles in this serial  are  played  by  mature
artistes  like Raza Murad, Kiran Kumar and Smita Jaykar. Still  I
have a role to play as the motivating daughter of Smita and  Raza
who brings matters to a head."

Renuka Shahane has been appreciated for her "quietly" effective
performance  in  "9  Malabar Hill," the  Siddharth  Sen  Gupta-
directed  serial in which her's is the main role.  Notes  Renuka:
"I've  been very happy with "Imtehaan" and  "Sailaab,"  both
directed  by  Ravi Rai, who is a good script-writer too.  I  felt
particularly  happy with my role in "Imtehaan," it was  shaping
up  really  well and we looked poised for more  exciting  things,
when it was yanked off the screen at the end of the 26th episode.
Did I feel disappointed!"

Now  to the "role" in which she is so omnipresent on the  small
screen!  There  seems  to be a rather mixed  reaction  to  Renuka
Shahane  as Annu Kapoor's bubbly co-host in "Antakshari."  Some
argue  she  hogs  the show; others say she is  too  subdued;  yet
others feel her costuming, her get-up seem all wrong. But  Renuka
is  dismissive  of  the suggestion that either  she  or  Annu  is
domineering.

"You cannot," she reasons, "be dominant in a live musical show
like  "Antakshari"  where it is so much a matter  of  give-and-
take. Our first priority here is to put the participants at ease.
Annu  is very comfortable in Hindi, it is his mother tongue.  And
he  sees to it that at no point does viewer interest in the  show
flag,  at  no stage does any participant get a feeling  of  being
intimidated. The chalking out of the programme is done in a  very
congenial  and  friendly  atmosphere,  an  atmosphere  in   which
director Gajendra Singh, Annu and I, all three, take part in  the
discussion  freely. As for my costuming, it is the choice of  the
sponsors,  I cannot help it if certain viewers feel it  does  not
suit me."

For  Renuka,  everything in her professional  life  has  happened
naturally.  Even  that  Filmfare  award  for  her  Marathi  film,
"Aboli," came to her just like that. "I had no inkling I would
get  it ahead of so many talented and deserving  artistes,"  she
says, having grown up in a part of Mumbai known for its erudition
and achievement.

This  must  explain why Renuka is so choosy about what  she  does
even in a spot medium like TV. But viewers judge her,  instantly,
by  what  they see. From the moment she was picked  up  by  Gulan
Kripalani  to  play  Pankaj  Berry's  wife  in  that   rollicking
breakfast  serial, "P. C. Aur Mousi" (a show in which she  came
in  rewarding contact with Farida Jalal) to now (when  the  whole
viewing world is still toasting her as the charming elder bahu of
Rajshri's Hum Aapke Hain Koun), there is nothing Renuka has  gone
after for it to come to her."I am anxious only to the extent  of
being  conscientious  about  giving my one hundred  per  cent  to
anything  in hand, be it my work or studies. Never have I  sought
the easy way out where it comes to making the effort," she says.
One thing has led to another and Renuka feels happy to have  come
in live touch with some of the more creative talents of the small
screen.

"I  value my work in Vijaya Mehta's "Lifeline,"  says  Renuka.
"During  the  doing of "Surabhi," Siddharth  Kak's  guideline,
that  the  two  of us should not be talking down  to  people  but
chatting to the camera, came as a most timely tip. I have  reason
to  be  grateful  to Annu Kapoor for  his  protectively  friendly
smoothing over of certain awkward moments before the camera while
working  on  "Antakshari." I treasure,  too,  the  enlightening
hours  spent with director Pushkar Singh while doing  that  brief
but significant serial of just six episodes: "Akanksha"  (based
on  the  theme of adoption). Money, for me, is  not  everthing,"
concludes  Renuka by way of justifying her laid-back attitude  to
life and career.

Maybe  it is just the literary milieu in which she has  grown  up
that  enables  Renuka  Shahane to look upon  TV  star  status  as
something  that is not the end of the world. "For me, there  are
other  attractions  in life," says  Renuka,  still  attractively
single. "I like doing theatre, seeing good plays, taking in good
cinema reading, devoting time to literature, even plain relaxing.
All  this  is  invaluable for my well-being.  There  is  so  much
happening, so much to absorb."

A  sound head on slim shoulders - that is Renuka Shahane, the  TV
star with a difference.

India: Situation will be clear in 20 days: Waghela

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 16, Col. a

From Our Special Correspondent

NEW DELHI, Sept. 26.

The political situation in Gujarat is expected to become clear in
the  next  20  days, immediately after the  by-elections  in  the
State. This was the view of the Gujarat BJP dissident leader,  Mr
Shankarsinh Waghela, who met the press here today on his way back
to Ahmedabad from Lucknow.

Mr  Waghela was confident that there would be no  difficulty  for
the  Mahagujarat Janata Party led by Mr Dilip Parikh  in  getting
the  support of at least four or five of the 18 MLAs  "virtually
kept prisoner" by the BJP.

"In  any case the Mehta Governments inning's are over. There  is
no  question  of the BJP making Mr. Suresh Mehta  Chief  Minister
again.  From  the very start it was Mr. Keshubhai Patel  who  was
chosen  for that chair, and again, the BJP will try to bring  him
back as Chief Minister," Mr. Waghela said emphatically.
He alleged that `private police' were used inside the Assembly on
that  fateful  September 18 and that  mediapersons  were  `beaten
mercilessly'. He said that many journalists were later threatened
that night and some feared for their lives. "The Deputy  Speaker
was also taken ill because threats were issued to him and in  the
hospital  he  was  given  a heavy  dose  of  sedation  making  it
impossible  for him to chair the next day's  Assembly  session,"
Mr.  Waghela charged, adding that "no one could prevent the  BJP
Government  from forming a government in Gujarat if  they  remain
sure  of their majority. They can go to Raj Bhawan  tomorrow  and
claim that they have the necessary support. Who can stop  them?"
he asked.

He added that on September 18, there were only 87 MLAs present in
the  House after police threw out the Opposition MLAs.  According
to him, only 87 votes were cast in favour of the so-called motion
seeking a vote of confidence.

He admitted that he had gone to Lucknow `to warn' the people  not
to  believe  the BJP and its leadership, and not be taken  in  by
their  promises.  He said that in Lucknow he did meet  `some  BJP
leaders,'  but refused to identify them, saying `they would  lose
their  jobs'.  In  response to questions, he  admitted  that  the
`promises'  made  to him by Mr Atal Behari  Vajpayee  after  last
September's  episode  were  not kept by the  party.  He  implied,
without saying this in so many words, that Mr Vajpayee was unable
to have his say in the party.

India: 14 airports to be developed for global operations

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 15, Col. d

From Our Special Correspondent

NEW DELHI, Sept. 26.

With  the expansion of private airlines in the  domestic  sector,
the  Government has decided to develop 14 airports including  the
12  model  airports,  for limited  international  operations,  in
addition to the major airports.

The  private  airlines  has  made it  necessary  to  provide  for
additional  parking  and  maintenance  facilities.  New  terminal
buildings  to serve the increased number of passengers are  being
commissioned  and  airports  made  consumer  friendly,  with  the
augmentation  of passenger amenities for better baggage  handling
and check-in facilities.

The  model  airports include Lucknow, Jaipur,  Nagpur,  Vadodara,
Kozhikode,   Coimbatore,  Indore,  Hyderabad,  Patna,   Guwahati,
Bhubaneswar,  Imphal, Goa and Ahmedabad. The airports  have  been
identified  by AAI from the economic and tourism point  of  view.
Modernisation  of  air  traffic  services  with  state-of-the-art
communication,  navigation and surveillance system will be  taken
up in a phased manner.

New  airports  are  being constructed  particularly  in  interior
places  such as Tura in Meghalaya and Lengpuri in  Mizoram  under
the State plans, and Kargil and Kishtwar in Jammu and Kashmir and
Andorth in Lakshadweep funded by the Central Government.
At the Kozhikode airport, a new international terminal block with
all  amenities for handling 400 passengers, was  commissioned  in
June  this year. At Ahmedabad, extension of runway from  9000  to
11,500  feet  has been taken up. At Hassan, an  airport  will  be
developed for the 50-seater aircraft operation over 295 acres for
Rs. 50 crores in the first phase. In the second phase the airport
will  be extended to 9000 feet with Rs. 60 crores more to  enable
Boeing 737 operation.

Dustin Hoffman: Cinema"s diminutive dynamo

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 25, Col. a

Thirty years after he became Hollywood's newest "Graduate",  he
remains  one  of its most skilled practitioners. A  look  at  the
memorable  screen moments of Dustin Hoffman,  honoured  recently,
for lifetime achievement at the Venice Film Festival

"Mrs.  Robinson, do you think we could say a few words  to  each
other first, this time"

"Mrs.   Robinson,  if  you  don't  mind  my  saying   so,   this
conversation is becoming a little strange".

"Mrs. Robinson you're trying to seduce me aren't you?"

"Maybe we could do something else together, Mrs. Robinson. Would
you like to go to a movie?"

The   increasingly  apprehensive  teenager  realises   that   the
middleaged  woman  (Anne Bancroft), who just happens  to  be  his
girlfriend's  (Katherine Ross) mother, is in fact practising  the
fine  art of seduction on him. Coming as it did, in  1967,  "The
Graduate",  unerringly tapped the mood of the swinging  Sixties,
mirrored  on the soundtrack, in the classic Simon  and  Garfunkel
songs  -  and became a milestone film, earning that  year's  Best
Director   Oscar   for   Mike   Nichols.   Nominated   -   albeit
unsuccessfully  -  was  the  chubby  faced  young  actor,  Dustin
Hoffman,  a diminutive 5 ft 6 ins, but at 31 much older than  the
character  he portrayed. Much imitated (Kamal Hassan  played  the
Hoffman  character in a derivative Tamil film), "The  Graduate"
continued to win new audiences in later decades via TV and video,
as a seminal Sixties product.

The film made Hoffman a star - and his style of studied, cerebral
acting,  a  cult. Over the next three decades,  this  deliberate,
sometimes eccentric practitioner of the now often derided art  of
emoting, has delivered some of cinema's most memorable moments.
At  the Venice Film Festival, earlier this month, Dustin  Hoffman
was  honoured  with  a special "Golden  Lion"  for  his  career
achievement  in  cinema. He quotes his guru  Lee  Straberg,  from
whose  "Method"  school  of acting  so  many  Hollywood  heroes
graduated: "There is no such thing as a juvenile, a villain or a
hero. We are all characters".

After "The Graduate", his very next bash at the big screen  was
a character, as eccentric as they came: the crippled,  aggressive
"Ratso",  who teams up with a gigolo (John Voight) as they  try
to  eke  out  a  living from the seedy  underside  of  New  York.
"Midnight Cowboy", became the first "X" rated film to win  an
Oscar - for its director John Schlesinger.

But  the  awesome histrionic talents in  the  pint-sized  Hoffman
frame  were  on display for the first time in 1970 when  he  aged
from a teenager - to 121 years, playing the only survivor of  the
infamous  Little Big Horn slaughter of American Indians. As  Jack
Crabb,  a boy brought up by the Cheyenne Indians,  Hoffman  plays
"Little Big Man", a witness to almost a century of exploitation
of  America's indigenous population by the whites. Arthur  Penn's
film   was  not  your  customary  hard  riding,   hard   drinking
"Western",  but  possibly the most sensitive portrayal  of  the
"Red" Indian way of life.

The  ultra  violent "Straw Dogs" which featured  Hoffman  (with
Susan  George)  in 1971 as an American research student  and  his
wife,  experiencing  the malevolence of the locals in  a  Cornish
village  in  Britain, was one of director  Sam  Peckinpah's  most
controversial  films.  The British, for one refused to  accept  a
plot where locals let loose a reign of terror including  multiple
rape in a sleepy village. It was never allowed into this country.
But the equally downbeat "Papillon" was. Based on a French best
seller,  the  story  followed the repeated attempts  of  a  penal
colony  inmate  (Steve  McQueen) to escape - aided  by  a  mousy,
myopic buddy (Hoffman). It was a star vehicle - and little  else.
High powered star power was in abundance, once more, when Hoffman
joined  Robert  Redford, in "All the  President's  Men'  (1976),
where  they  play the investigative duo Carl  Bernstein  and  Bob
Woodward,   who  cracked  the  Watergate  conspiracy  for   "The
Washington Post". The film had little to offer the  non-American
viewer who in any case was not so obsessed with this true saga of
President Nixon's downfall.

"My  dear  boy  have you ever tried  acting?"  asked  the  late
Shakespearean  thespian Laurence Olivier, of his co-star  Hoffman
during  the making of the bizarre often very convoluted  thriller
"Marathon  Man". But the old man's jibes apart, the film was  a
poor  showcase for either of them - and a nauseating scene  where
the neo Nazi Olivier does some unscheduled dental work on Hoffman
was only one of many violent moments.

But  acting talent was not a prerequisite for garnering Oscars  -
charisma  and star power could do the job - as Hoffman and  Meryl
Streep  proved  in  1979, playing a separated  husband  and  wife
battling over their kid in "Kramer versus Kramer". This  "four
hanky"  film won Hoffman his first Best Actor Award - and  other
honours  went to the film, to costar Streep, the director  Robert
Benton and the scriptwriters.

Never  one to rest on his laurels, Hoffman went on to take up  an
unusual  challenge, that would have daunted most macho stars:  In
the 1982 comedy "Tootsie" he appears in drag most of the  time,
playing  an  indigent actor who takes up female roles to  make  a
living.  This unlikely critical success was followed by what  the
industry  termed  a  "fifty million  dollar  flop":  "Ishtar"
teamed him with Warren Beatty. The two play a pair of second rate
songsters  writers  who  stumble on a spy  drama  in  the  Sahara
desert. Their constant companion is a blind camel. A wit said  at
the time, the film's audience had to be blind as well - to  enjoy
the film.

The  1988  Hoffman  starrer couldn't have  been  more  different.
"Rain Man" found him playing an autistic man - incoherent  most
of  the  time - who is left $3 million  dollars.  His  avaricious
younger  brother  (Tom Cruise) is only left a vintage car  -  and
hopes  to trick his sick brother out of his inheritance. They  go
on a long journey in the jalopy - and by film's end, the  younger
sibling  has learnt to appreciate the goodness of his  "savant"
brother. In a year when "feel good" films were in short supply,
"Rain  Man"  stormed the Academy Awards -  earning  Oscars  for
Hoffman, the film and the director Barry Levinson among others.
It was a different type of family bonding a year later:  "Family
Business"  was  about a bunch of  unlikely  crooks:  grandfather
(Sean  Connery),  father  (Hoffman) and  son  (Mathew  Broderick)
decide  to pull off a heist. It was a great comic idea -  but  it
barely worked.

The Nineties saw Dustin Hoffman make fleeting appearances on  the
screen.  Spielberg's Peter Pan update, "Hook" cast him  as  the
villainous  title  character  - but there was little  to  do  for
Hoffman  the  actor  in this special  effects  costume  drama.  A
glimpse of what he could do with a good script was provided  last
year  when  he appeared in "Outbreak" as a  conscientious  army
doctor  battling  against top brass  (Donald  Sutherland,  Morgan
Freeman) to control a rampaging viral disease. But encase Hoffman
most  of the time in a protective headgear (and high tech  drama)
and you curb his talents. He needs the pure acting environment to
thrive.  Chances  are his latest vehicle might just  provide  him
with this. "American Buffalo", casts him alongside Dennis Franz
of  "NYPD  Blue"  fame as a pair of crooks who try  to  pull  a
confidence trick on a friend - with disastrous consequences.  The
film  being  made earlier this year, is due to be seen  in  India
later this year.

If  his  appearances on screen are infrequent,  that  is  because
Dustin Hoffman can afford to pick and choose his roles. "I lived
below the official American poverty line till I was 31" he  says
(that  was  the year he appeared in "The Graduate").  Then  the
arithmetic  of success changed and today Hoffman swears by a  new
formula:  "Stardom equals freedom. It is the only equation  that
matters' he says.

As he slides into his sixties, it is an equation that adds up  to
some more cinematic delights to come from Dustin Hoffman.

A zest for life

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 25, Col. e

Khushboo  was  in Bombay last week. For old times'  sake  we  had
lunch  at a suburban restaurant. The restaurant was  too  crowded
for  confrontations  and confessions. But in  between  soups  and
sweet  dishes,  we  managed  to  cover  topics  ranging  over  26
alphabets.

***

Amitabh  Bachchan, Aamir Khan, Akshay Kumar and Arvind  Swamy.  I
cannot  think  beyond these performers. Amitabhji,  for  being  a
phenomenon,  Aamir  for his sensitivity towards  his  characters.
Akshay for his stamina and Arvind for his courteous behaviour.
Bombay  - I just love the city. Biscuits - Even if I were  to  be
woken  up  at two in the morning and offered  biscuits,  I  would
finish the packet.

Clothes  -  I  love  them,  specially  cotton  saris  and  salwar
kameezes.  I like dressing up. My family and friends feel I  look
good  in  modern  outfits, but I  prefer  myself  in  traditional
clothes.

Dogs  -  I just love them. The Alsatian bitch I have at  home  is
adorable. We got her when she was a week old. Today she is  four-
and-a-half and my mom's chamchi. I cannot touch mummy when she is
in the room. She is fiercely possessive about her.

Entertainment  -  Films,  theatre, circus,  road  side  tamashas,
anything, but life would be unbearable without entertainment.
Family  and  friends - They have been with me during my  ups  and
downs  - Brinda, Anu, Subbu, Madhoo, Viji - life wouldn't be  the
same, if I lost any one of them.

God - I am god fearing but not a religious fanatic. I respect all
religions and visit various shrines when I feel like.

Holidays - I have never been on a holiday, a planned holiday.  It
is only when my shootings get cancelled at the last minute that I
take a few days off. My folks at home never take my proposal  for
a holiday seriously. I have let them down too often.

India - I am proud to be an Indian, proud of my culture. We  have
so  much variety in food and attire in all our States.  Not  many
countries can promise that.

Jashn  Ali Khan - My three-year-old nephew. He is the love of  my
life.... my absolute jaan. On the day he was born, I insisted  on
holding  him first. And I did. I remember the expression when  he
opened  his  eyes. Right now he is in Indonesia and  I  miss  him
badly.  He gurgles on the phone. I love the way he calls me  Bua.
Sometimes he calls me Khusphus.

Kites  -  I love watching colourful kites in the  sky.  There  is
something romantic about them. Ever since childhood, my  brothers
made  me hold the manja-phirki, while they flew the kites.  After
all these years, the practice has not changed.

Love - I thrive on love and cannot survive without it. I can live
without  oxygen, but not love. London - It is a city I have  only
dreamt of, never visited. Strange that I have travelled all  over
Europe, except London.

Mother - We fight so often, but I cannot live without her either.
She  is  very important in my life and she knows  it.  She  takes
advantage  of this at times, supports my brothers  in  arguments,
even when she knows they are in the wrong.

Marriage  -  I  was  miserable  when  I  had  to  break  off  the
relationship I had invested so much into. I can never forget that
day. It was the worst day of my life. I had to learn it the  hard
way that nobody is perfect.

Nagging - I hate being nagged, so I can guess what a torture I am
to others.

Oorvasi - She is Tamil Nadu's most versatile actress and has made
a  name  for herself in all the South  Indian  languages.  Today,
almost  every heroine-oriented script is written with Oorvasi  in
mind. I truly admire her spontaneity.

Perfection - I am not a perfectionist. No matter how hard I  try,
I  can never attain perfection. Something, somewhere always  goes
wrong. May be, It is temperament, but I am hoping I will be  able
to rectify this when I become a housewife.

Quiz  Master Derek O'Brien of "Bournvita Quiz Contest" - He  is
too good! I try and watch the show whenever I can.

Rickshaws - Whenever in Bombay, I love travelling by rickshaws. I
don't get to do it in Madras. I also enjoy the double-decker  bus
rides in Bombay. Down South, we don't have it.

Sundar  -  He  is selfless, generous, mature and  my  whole  life
revolves around him. He is the man responsible for my confidence.
The  motivating  factor to assert myself as a woman. I  love  him
deeply  and cannot think of a future without him. Shabana Azmi  -
is  the woman I admire greatly. If I can acquire even an iota  of
the fame and respect she has, I will consider myself lucky.
Tantrums  -  A common feature with newcomers on  the  sets  these
days.  Youngsters think its is fashionable to be  arrogant.  Real
stars  don't  throw  their weight around. On  the  contrary,  the
bigger the star, the more normal his behaviour.

Ubin Fernandez - My hairdresser and friend. I call her  "aunty"
and  she  has been my guide and companion for 14 years.  She  has
been an integral part of my career. She treats me like her  child
and is fiercely loyal.

Victory  - I hate the word failure. Last year, when I  was  going
through  a low phase, people said it was over for me. The  papers
referred  to me in the past tense. It hurt and I swore to  myself
that I would get back. I did and that is a victory for me.
Work  -  Work is worship. I would be completely lost  without  my
work.  I am addicted to it. I cannot sit idle even when I am  not
well.  When  I  am  not shooting, I  am  busy  cooking,  cleaning
vessels,  floors and cupboards. For someone so active, my  weight
is a mystery.

X'mas  - I look forward to Christmas every year. Ubin aunty  gets
me homemade rose cookies and I just love them.

Youth - I like the feeling of youth. I may talk and behave mature
but at heart I am a teenager.

Zest  - Is what keeps me going... When I want to, I can be  goal-
oriented. I am determined when I am motivated.

India: SPG cover: V.P. Singh reiterates demand

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 13, Col. a

From Our Special Correspondent

NEW DELHI, Sept. 26.

The  former  Prime Minister, Mr. V.P. Singh, has  reiterated  his
demand  for immediate withdrawal of the Special Protection  Group
cover  to him and his immediate family members and said that  the
issue  of  withdrawal  of  SPG cover  should  not  be  linked  to
provision of alternative security cover.

Responding  to a letter written by the Prime Minister,  Mr.  H.D.
Deve   Gowda,  urging  him  to  consider  opting  for  "Z   plus"
alternative security cover, Mr. Singh has said that he will  keep
his options open.

"As for the alternative security cover suggested by you I keep my
options open for it will not be possible to accept an alternative
cover if it puts the same burden on the treasury and the poor man
as  the  SPG does at the moment must be costing  the  country  at
least  Rs.  60  crores a year for all the old  and  new  ex-Prime
Ministers,"  Mr.  Singh  has informed the  Prime  Minister  in  a
letter.

Mr.  Singh has said while he and his wife, Mrs. Sita Kumari,  are
signing  the letter, his two sons, Mr. Ajeya Singh and Mr.  Abhai
Singh, are at the moment abroad and will send similar requests on
arrival. "As no SPG cover is given to them abroad, the decks  are
cleared for immediate withdrawal of SPG".

India: End of the road for Narasimha Rao?

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 13, Col. b

From Harish Khare

NEW DELHI, Sept. 26.

With  legal troubles coming like a torrent, there seems to be  no
political  respite  for  the former Prime  Minister,  Mr.  P.  V.
Narasimha Rao. Having already stepped down from the office of the
president  of  the Congress Party, he will find his  position  as
Leader  of  the  Congress  Parliamentary  Party  untenable  after
today's legal rebuffs - first the Delhi High Court's rejection of
his  plea for an anticipatory bail and later the charge-sheet  in
the St. Kitts forgery case.

That he becomes the first former Prime Minister to have to face a
charge-sheet   is   in  itself  not   without   grave   political
implications.  There was no official Congress reaction;  nor  any
Congress leader wanted to say anything adverse about him. At  the
same time there was no enthusiasm to speak up in his defence.  In
fact,  there  was a sense of sadness among the  Congress  leaders
that  Mr.  Narasimha  Rao should get  badly  embroiled  in  legal
entanglements.

After  Mr.  Rao stepped down as Congress president, much  of  the
anger  and  bitterness  towards him has waned.  But  there  is  a
realisation that he cannot escape paying a price for the  forces,
some  clearly  unwholesome, he helped unleash  in  the  political
system.

Most  Congress  leaders have convinced themselves that it  was  a
deliberate political strategy on the part of Mr. Narasimha Rao to
entangle  rivals like Mr. L. K. Advani, Mr. Arjun Singh  and  Mr.
Tiwari  in  the hawala case. That  case  generated  unprecedented
divisiveness and bitterness in and outside the Congress,  leaving
Mr.  Rao with few friends and little goodwill once he  failed  to
lead the party to victory in the Lok Sabha elections.

If nothing else, there will be pressure on Mr. Rao to follow  the
precedent  set by other political leaders charge-sheeted  in  the
hawala scandal. It would be recalled that Mr. Advani had resigned
his    Lok Sabha seat  in January this year after he was  charge-
sheeted  (along with Mr. Arjun Singh, Mr. Madhavrao Scindia,  Mr.
Balram Jakhar and others). Mr. Advani had said that he would  not
contest  the  Lok Sabha elections unless he was  cleared  of  the
"trumped up charges." Similarly, Mr. Sharad Yadav of the Janata
Dal  was forced to step down as the leader of the Janata  Dal  in
the Lok Sabha.

Subsequently,  the  Congress  itself  denied  nomination  to  the
"charge-sheeted" leaders like Mr. V. C. Shukla, Mr. Jhakar, Mr.
Scindia  and  Mr. Arvind Netam. The principle  invoked  was  that
anyone "charge-sheeted" ought to get himself/herself cleared of
the  legal entanglement before the party would run the risk of  a
political endorsement/association.

The "charge-sheet" principle was invoked by Mr. Narasimha Rao's
supporters  themselves last week after he was issued  summons  in
the  Lakhubhai Pathak case. A statement signed by  four  general-
secretaries (Messrs B. P. Maurya, Janardhana Poojary,  Madhavsinh
Solanki and R. K. Dhavan) had noted:  "the general feeling among
the Congress leaders is that the issuing of summons by itself  is
not a reason for the Congress president to take this drastic step
[of  relinquishing  the  office]. In a number  of  cases  persons
against  whom  charges  have  been  framed  in  the  courts   are
continuing in their posts."

The  charge-sheet has come now. And though at the  last  Congress
Working  Committee, the party leadership had assured him that  he
would not stand alone in his legal battles, that scenario  stands
changed  after the St. Kitts charge-sheet. Unless  Mr.  Narasimha
Rao  demonstrates  an hitherto unsuspected fighting  ability  and
personal  stamina, his political career can be said to have  come
to an abrupt end.

India: Urea scam: CBI may send team to Geneva

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 15, Col. c

From Our Special Correspondent

NEW DELHI, Sept. 25.

The  Central  Bureau of Investigation (CBI) is  giving  finishing
touches  to the requisite documents for pressing the  extradition
of  the  two top officials of the Turkish firm,  Karsan  Limited,
from Switzerland.

A  two-member CBI team had returned from Geneva about a week  ago
and  had taken up the exercise of preparing the documents  to  be
sent to the Swiss authorities.

According  to sources, the CBI may send its team to  Geneva  with
the  documents  seeking  extradition of  Karsan's  Chairman,  Mr.
Tuncay Alankus and its Executive Director, Mr. Cihan Karanci. The
duo  was arrested by the Interpol earlier this month.  They  were
stated to be still under detention in Geneva.

There is no extradition treaty between India and Switzerland  but
the  request  can  be made under  the  Swiss-British  Extradition
Treaty. The request has to reach the Swiss authorities within  30
days of the arrest of the two accused.

The  investigation  into the Rs. 133 crore urea  import  scam  is
likely to pick up and the CBI may succeed in its efforts to trace
the flow of funds from Karsan's account in Pictet Bank, Geneva.
The  Fertilizer  Ministry had refused to accept the  shipment  of
9006  tonnes of urea dispatched by Karsan as the  fertilizer  was
much below international standards. In the deal to supply 2  lakh
tonnes  of  urea to the National Fertilizer  Limited  (NFL),  the
Turkish company took the full advance of $37 million, but  failed
to supply the fertilizer by May as stated in the contract.

Asian tariffs impede growth: World Bank

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 14, Col. d

From Sridhar Krishnaswami

WASHINGTON, Sept. 26.

India  continued to reap substantial benefits from the trade  and
investment  liberalisation reforms undertaken after 1991 and  the
South Asian economies that grew by about 5.3 per cent in 1995  is
estimated  to grow around six per cent, according to  the  Annual
Report of the World Bank for 1996. Since 1991, the average export
growth  rate for the region has exceeded 10 per cent compared  to
an average of 5.6 per cent for the years 1981-1990,but the export
of  goods  and non-factor services represented less than  15  per
cent  of domestic output, well below the average  for  developing
countries.  "Although recent reforms have succeeded in  lowering
trade barriers, South Asian tariffs remain far higher than  those
in  other  regions.  As a result, they remain  an  impediment  to
growth because in conjunction with other trade restrictions, they
create distortions and can lead to resource misallocation,"  the
Annual Report observes.

The  regional  perspectives of the Bank for South Asia  reveal  a
mixture of the positive fallouts of the reform process that  have
put  in place as well as in some of the  persisting  difficulties
that  stand in the way of development either as a result  of  the
perceived  lack  of reforms in particular areas or in  other  on-
going  political and civil developments in specific nations.  The
Report,  in  talking about the conditions in Bangladesh  and  Sri
Lanka, makes the point that political difficulties in the case of
Bangladesh  and  in the continuation of the civil strife  in  Sri
lanka have contributed to dampening private sector dynamism  and,
thereby, restraining growth.

Reform process pays off

On  the positive side, the Annual Report takes note of  the  fact
that   regional  cooperation  had  received  a  boost  with   the
ratification  of a trade agreement by members of the  South  Asia
Association of Regional Cooperation, or SAARC. The agreement that
included bilateral concessions brought about cuts in tariff rates
ranging  from  10  to  100  per cent  in  more  than  220  items.
"Although  the trade impact is likely to be small given the  low
share of intra-regional trade, the SAARC countries have indicated
their  intention to initiate negotiations towards establishing  a
free trade area in the near future," the World Bank notes.
The  Bank Assessment has been that the reform process and  active
engagement  in the world economy by the South Asian  nations  are
now paying off in terms of higher foreign investment with private
capitals  accounting  for close to 50 per cent  of  the  resource
flows  to  the  region as opposed to 25 per  cent  in  1990.  The
aggregate  resource flows may have fallen in 1995 due to  decline
in  overall  portfolio  flows following the  devaluation  of  the
Mexican  peso  in December 1994,but they were still  much  higher
than  in 1993. Foreign Direct Investment reached a record U.S.  $
2.8  billions  and  although  India  was  the  largest  recipient
(receiving about U.S. $ 2 billions) other nations also shared  in
the increase.

The  countries of South Asia, the World Bank notes, also saw  the
growth  of the export earnings outpace the increase in debt  with
all  countries  improving the  debt-to-export  and  debt-to-gross
national  product  ratios. The economies of the region  were  the
only  group of developing countries not to have restructured  the
debt in the past decade and having incurred almost no arrears  to
external  debtors. "But maintaining sound economic  fundamentals
and  pushing  ahead with economic reforms are  essential  if  the
region  is to take full advantage of the enormous  potential  for
further  growth  in private capital flows to  the  region,"  the
World Bank has said.

Poor social indicators

The  incidence and depth of poverty may have declined  since  the
1980s, but the number of poor has increased. The recent estimate,
according to the World Bank, is that 43 per cent of the  region's
population  lives on incomes of less than U.S. $ 1 per  day;  and
that  South Asia, which accounts for 22 per cent of  the  world's
population,  accounted  for 40 per cent of the  world's  poor  as
well. Aside from the fact that this underscored the importance of
policies that raised rural incomes, the Bank argues that high and
sustained growth rate that takes place in an environment of sound
economic  management was essential for the reduction of  poverty.
"But growth is not by itself sufficient to reduce poverty. South
Asia's  social indicators are very poor. Average life  expectancy
at birth is sixty years, half the adult population is  illiterate
and  children  under  the  age of  five  experience  the  highest
mortality rate in the world... These regional averages,  however,
mask  considerable  diversity, both across countries as  well  as
within countries. Sri Lanka and some Indian States, for  example,
have  social  indicators  that  are  comparable  with  those   in
countries with a higher income per capita," the Bank says.
The  annual report makes the point that achieving  major  poverty
reduction  is  feasible;  but to attain  more  rapid  growth  and
integration in the world economy in the coming years, nations  in
South  Asia will face tough policy challenges that would  include
addressing  the  deficiencies  in  social  areas,  infrastructure
bottlenecks,  reducing the still excessive trade  and  investment
barriers  and  extending  the scope of  competition  in  domestic
factor  and  product  markets. "The Bank  continues  to  support
policies   that   promote  sustainable  growth,   develop   human
resources, extend the benefits to currently disadvantaged  groups
(such as women), and overcome obstacles to the sustainability  of
growth,  particularly  in the environmental  and  human  resource
areas. The current operational strategy in the region  emphasises
ways   to   achieve  these   objectives   through   participatory
approaches,   decentralisation,  increased  involvement  by   the
private sector and a sharper client focus," the Report adds.
New action plan

On  the role of the private sector, the World Bank has taken  the
position  that  in  South Asia, severe  absorptive  capacity  and
implementation  deficiencies  coupled with  financial  restraints
have resulted in chronic underinvestment in infrastructure  where
the  public sector alone did not have the resources to  meet  the
needs  -  as, for instance, in the lack of available  finance  on
terms  commensurate with the typical long gestation  and  revenue
earning  capacity  of infrastructure projects.  "In  India,  for
example,  the  development of a long term  domestic  debt  market
requires a number of significant policy reforms in the  financial
sector,   particularly  as  regards  regulations  applicable   to
contractual  savings institutions. While such a reform  programme
is being formulated and until its key elements are implemented so
that  a  well-functioning  domestic  long-term  debt  market  can
emerge, domestic financial institutions have to play a major role
in  supporting private investment in infrastructure," the  World
Bank notes.

The Report, at a broader level, has to be seen in the context  of
the  global  changes that are currently taking place and  in  the
backdrop of the recent trends that would include the rapid growth
of  private  investments  and capital  availability  and  in  the
levelling   off  or  even  diminishing   official   developmental
assistance.  For instance, the total private flows to  the  major
emerging market economies totalled some U.S. $ 225 billions while
the official flows amounted to only U.S. $ 14 billions. In  terms
of  region,  the  Asia  Pacific accounted for  some  U.S.  $  123
billions of private financial flows, and U.S. $ 10.4 billions  in
official   flows  from  the  major  financial  agencies.   Senior
officials  of the World Bank take the position that the  flow  of
private investment is not to be taken as some kind of a `threat'.
For one thing the argument has been that private investment flows
are  directed  by  specificity  and  sector  dominated;  and  for
another,  the  point  is  being made that  the  flow  of  private
investment opens different arenas to the World Bank.

One of the critical aspects of this year's annual meetings of the
World Bank and the International Monetary Fund is in developing a
comprehensive strategy to meet the needs of the heavily  indebted
poor countries. Such a plan of action is said to be on the `brink
of  a  breakthrough', although serious questions  remain  on  the
extent  to which the industrialised world is willing to go  along
with finding additional resources to meet the challenge.
India returns more

PTI reports:

India  returned  to the World Bank $ 723 millions  more  than  it
received  from  the institution in fiscal 1996, ending  June  30,
thanks to repayments and interest on past loans.

The  Annual Report of the Bank shows that in fiscal  1996,  India
had undisbursed commitments of $ 9.43 billions. During the  year,
the  Bank  made  new  commitments  of  $  2.978  billions   while
disbursements   amounted  to  $  1.309  billions.  Against   that
disbursement,  India paid the Bank $ 1.149 billions as  repayment
and  $  884  millions  as interest, leaving  the  country  $  723
millions in the red.

India: Cauvery: Karnataka denies understanding

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 14, Col. c

From Our Special Correspondent

BANGALORE, Sept. 26.

The  Karnataka Major Irrigation Minister, Mr. K. N.  Nage  Gowda,
clarified  on Thursday that no understanding was reached  on  any
contentious  issue relating to the Cauvery water  dispute  during
the talks between the Governments of Karnataka and Tamil Nadu.
Mr.  Nage  Gowda told presspersons that what had  transpired  was
only loud thinking. It was not correct to say that the States had
agreed to build an additional water gauging centre at Biligundlu,
where  the  Central Water Commission-manned  gauging  centre  was
located.

Mr. Nage Gowda was endorsing the view expressed by the Tamil Nadu
PWD Minister, Mr. Durai Murugan, in Madras on Wednesday.
The  Minister  said  there  was  also  no  understanding  on  not
extending  the area under irrigation in the Cauvery  basin.  This
issue  was linked to the quantum of water that was to  be  shared
between the two States, which had not been agreed upon. Mr.  Nage
Gowda,  who convened a press conference in the morning,  said  he
had spoken to both the Karnataka Chief Minister, Mr. J. H. Patel,
and  Mr. Durai Murugan. The Chief Minister had told him over  the
phone  that  he did not say that both the States had come  to  an
understanding  on  setting  up an additional  gauging  centre  at
Biligundlu to monitor the water inflow.

He clarified that the Tamil Nadu had stuck to its stand that  the
Mettur  reservoir was the reference point and it  had  maintained
that  even  the Cauvery Tribunal had endorsed it.  The  Karnataka
Government  had  suggested  that  a  modern  gauging  centre   be
established at Biligundlu on the Tamil Nadu-Karnataka border.
Expressing   the  Government's  resentment  over   the   reported
statement  of the Andhra Pradesh Irrigation Minister that  Andhra
Pradesh  was not getting an adequate quantity of water  from  the
Tungabhadra  dam, Mr. Nage Gowda said the release of  water  from
that dam was monitored by the Tungabhadra Board, which was headed
by  the  Chairman  of the Central  Water  Commission.  The  State
Governments  of  Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh had no say  on  the
issue. Farmers in Karnataka had not tapped water meant for Andhra
Pradesh.  The Tungabhadra Board had vindicated Karnataka's  stand
in  its  recent  letter. Tungabhadra water was  being  shared  by
Karnataka  and  Andhra  Pradesh on the  basis  of  an  agreement.
Karnataka  was getting two-thirds of the water and the  rest  was
being  used  by  Andhra Pradesh. Describing the  remarks  of  his
Andhra  Pradesh counterpart as unfortunate, Mr. Nage  Gowda  said
such  `unverified'  and `unwarranted' statements would  harm  the
cordial  relations between the two States. If the Andhra  Pradesh
Government had complaints, it could raise them at the Tungabhadra
Board meeting scheduled for October 15.

He  termed as baseless the allegation of the Mysore  BJP  member,
Mr.  Ramdas, that the Prime Minister, Mr. H. D. Deve  Gowda,  had
settled contractors' bills relating to the Bagur-Navile tunnel of
the  Hemavathy  project, worth Rs. 1.19 crores, two  days  before
resigning  as Chief Minister. He maintained that these bills  had
not been settled for the last four to five years.

India: EC looking into BJP complaints against PM

from THE HINDU, 27 September 1996, Pg. 13, Col. a

From Our Special Correspondent

NEW DELHI, Sept. 26.

The Election Commission is looking into complaints received  from
the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) against the Prime Minister,  Mr.
H.  D.  Deve Gowda, charging him of violating the model  code  of
conduct  during  his  campaign for  the  Uttar  Pradesh  Assembly
elections.

The BJP's complaints relate to Mr. Gowda's reported announcements
that  his  Government was considering reservation  for  women  in
Central  Government jobs and also for extending  the  reservation
bracket to poor among the forward castes. Mr. Gowda had  promised
these in the course of his election meetings in U.P.

The Commission has called for reports from the Cabinet Secretary,
according  to  a  spokesman  of  the  Election  Commission.   The
spokesman  added  that  the Election Commission  has  received  a
report  from  the  Doordarshan and that a full  report  from  the
Cabinet  Secretary  was expected by this week end.  The  Election
Commission will take up the matter for a final verdict soon after
receiving the report, the spokesman added.

The  Commission  had  also taken up a  proposal  from  the  Uttar
Pradesh Government to give extension to one of its officers,  Mr.
Surendra  Mohan, who is due to superannuate on September  30.  It
was  decided  that  such an extension was not in  order  and  the
decision was conveyed to the Government.

In  another  instance of the  Commission's  intervention  towards
enforcing  the  model code, the Commission has  conveyed  to  the
Jammu  and  Kashmir Chief Secretary stating that a  September  23
decision to set up a Directorate of Tourism was not in order  and
that such a decision must be left to the elected State Government
that is expected to be in place within the coming fortnight.
