<FONT SIZE=+1><STRONG>Why Is Time So Important When It Comes To
Saving?</STRONG></FONT><P>


A $1 million nest egg by age 65 - it's a nice thought, but such a nest egg will not happen
magically. 
Accumulating assets for retirement takes time and discipline.
<P>
What are the keys to retirement security?  First, it's important to understand that your
investment
success does not depend solely on your ability to pick the stock of the month, time market
highs and
lows, or discover the next great fund manager.  Most successful retirement funds are built by
making
regular payments over time.  Simply put, the sooner you begin to save for future financial
needs, the
better.
<P>
<STRONG>Can You Afford Not To Save?</STRONG><BR>
Time can be one of your most powerful investment allies.  The following example illustrates
this point. 
Your objective is to accumulate $1 million for retirement by age 65.  If you are 25, you will
need to make
an annual investment of just $3,900, assuming an 8% annual return. That's about $325 per
month. 
However, if you wait until age 45, you will need to save almost $22,000 a year or
approximately $1,800
per month to reach your goal.  This is a hypothetical illustration and is not intended to project
the future
performance of any particular product.
<P>
Although this example is basic, it proves a valuable point: postponing saving until later in the
game will
force you to dramatically increase your saving habits.  This is a difficult task, even for the
most
disciplined investor.
<P>
<STRONG>Where Do You Begin Building A Retirement Portfolio?</STRONG><BR>
Pay yourself first.  If you do not currently participate, the first place to begin accumulating
savings for
retirement is your employer-sponsored qualified retirement plan (401(k),
403(b), etc.), which presents a tremendous opportunity for you to get a jump on retirement. 
Some
employers will match employee contributions on a dollar-for-dollar basis, while others may
contribute a
smaller percentage.  Either way, taking advantage of the current tax deductions and the
ongoing tax
deferred compounding of earnings makes smart investment sense.
<P>
You can also contribute up to $2,000 annually in an IRA.  If you do not currently participate in
your
employer's
qualified retirement plan, your IRA contributions are fully tax deductible.  This deduction will
reduce your
taxable income and your current income tax bill. 
<P>
If you do participate in your employer's qualified retirement plan, your deduction for your
contribution
may be reduced or eliminated, depending on your annual adjusted gross income.  And,
even if your
contributions are not deductible, you should still consider making a yearly contribution
because the
money earned in the account compounds tax-deferred.  Most likely, withdrawal of earnings
will occur in
retirement, when you will probably be in a lower tax bracket.  Of course, withdrawals of
earnings are
taxable and, if you are under age <NOBR>59 1/2</NOBR>, may be subject to a 10% tax
penalty. 
<P>
<STRONG>How Do You Start Funding For Retirement?</STRONG><BR>
Whether it's saving for retirement, your children's education, or a home, dollar cost
averaging can
simplify your planning.  There are no mystical secrets behind dollar cost averaging.  It simply
involves
the systematic paying out of a fixed dollar amount at regular time intervals.  This strategy
attempts to
take the ups and downs of the market and "smooth them out."  And, while this strategy does
not
guarantee a profit in a prolonged declining market, it helps you avoid the pitfalls of trying to
"hit the
market at the right times."  Once you initiate a dollar cost averaging plan, the key to success
is sticking
with it and ignoring market fluctuations.
