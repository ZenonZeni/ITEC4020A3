<B> (WASHINGTON)</b></FONT><font size=3><b> -- The Commerce Department has imposed a $14,000 civil penalty on a Fort Lauderdale, Fla., company for alleged violations of the antiboycott provisions of the Export Administration Regulations, John Despres, assistant secretary for Export Enforcement, announced today.<P>

The Department alleged that on two occasions between September 1991 and January 1992, Brunger Export Company, a manufacturer's representative for water sports equipment and marine supplies, knowingly agreed to refuse to do business with or in Israel in compliance with a request from Kuwait.  Brunger Export also allegedly failed to report, on two occasions, its receipt of boycott related requests from Kuwait.<P>

While neither admitting nor denying the allegations, the company agreed to pay the civil
penalties.<P>

The antiboycott provisions of the Export Administration Act and Regulations apply to foreign boycotts fostered or imposed against a country which is friendly to the United States and which is not itself the object of any form of boycott under United States law or regulation.<P> 

U.S. companies and individuals are required to report to the Department each  boycott-related request they receive.<P>

The antiboycott provisions prohibit U.S. individuals and companies from refusing, agreeing to refuse or requiring other persons to refuse to do business with or in a boycotted country, with any national or resident of a boycotted country or with any other person pursuant to an agreement with, or a requirement of or a request from or on behalf of a boycotting country. <P></b>
