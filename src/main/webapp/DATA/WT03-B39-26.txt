Assets & Liabilities:  Why Investment Portfolios Are Shrinking


Don't look now, but the investment portfolio is shrinking at most major banks.
A recent survey of mid- to large-sized banks shows over half reduced their
portfolios relative to asset size in 1995 despite overall industry
asset-growth rates of more than 7%.  It's not hard to see why.

First and foremost, banks have been restructuring their balance sheets to
improve liquidity.  According to a recent survey by Olson Research Associates
and the Bank Administration Institute, robust loan demand has fueled an urgent
quest for liquidity since 1993.  Banks have taken net paydowns on securities
or have actively liquidated securities positions to fund the growth of loans.
This ongoing process is the expected flip side of the early 1990s, when there
was strong growth in the portfolio amid poor loan demand.

A second, and more enduring, reason for portfolio shrinkage may be that
investment officers now have to worry about a new dimension of portfolio
management.  These days, the chief investment officer or portfolio manager
must manage not only the yield on the bank's portfolio but also its market
value.  Not that it wasn't always important to manage investment market
values, but the difference now is that evolving accounting standards compel
specific market value disclosure.  Executive managers and stock analysts alike
can exercise greater scrutiny because of the new visibility of portfolio
values.

It all traces back to Financial Accounting Standard 115 for disclosures about
debt instruments.  The Financial Accounting Standards Board issued this
standard in 1993 as part of the Board's long-range project on financial
instruments, initiated in 1986.  FAS 115 creates three different accounting
approaches pertaining to market valuation for banks' and other firms'
investment securities.  For changes in market values of trading securities,
gains and losses are passed through the profit and loss statement and the
capital account.

For "available for sale" securities (AFS), changes in market value are
recognized in the banks' capital accounts and, along with trading securities,
potentially destabilize reported bank capital.  "Held to maturity" securities
(HTM) do not create accounting gains and losses, nor do they impact reported
capital, but they must meet rigorous standards concerning the bank's ability
and intent to hold them until they mature.

Of course, fluctuations in the market values of bank securities are a highly
visible beacon of interest rate risk.  Gap charts in banks' annual reports
appear benign and only mildly suggest interest rate exposures to bank
earnings.  In contrast, changes in market values hit the bullseye of
interest-rate risk measurement and grab the annual report reader's attention.
It's a worrisome thing for executive managements who may connect their
compensation with the need to report ever-improving performance.

I Shrunk the Portfolio

So, naturally, some banking firms have shrunk the portfolio itself to reduce
the impact of portfolio instability.  Many firms view a portion of the
investment portfolio as discretionary.  It's the part funded with
discretionary wholesale money and is not just a parking place for core
deposits.  It's no secret that acquisition-minded superregional banks are
backing away from large wholesale banking positions that add volatility and
are reemphasizing their core businesses.

This strategy contributes to the shrinkage of the portfolio.  Banking firms
are restructuring their balance sheets by laying off gobs of wholesale funds
and the portions of the portfolios that these funds supported; instead, their
balance sheets are absorbing core loans and funds obtained through the
acquisition of smaller banks.

PNC Bank Corp.  provides a good example of portfolio shrinkage.  In mid-1994,
PNC's $22-billion investment portfolio comprised 36% of the bank's earning
assets-quite large by industry standards at that time.  The bank embarked on
an aggressive strategy of emphasizing its core franchise, including a landmark
acquisition of Chemical Bank branches in New Jersey, and backing away from
wholesale funding and investing.  By late 1995, the portfolio had been reduced
to below $19 billion.  In the process, the bank exorcised some troublesome
investments and took heavy losses.

Still, PNC had a problem because HTM securities represented over 80% of the
portfolio.  Under FAS 115, these securities escaped accounting for gains and
losses, but the restrictiveness of the HTM classification tended to freeze
them in place and make them unmanageable.  And transferring part of them into
the AFS portfolio risked regulatory tainting of the remaining HTM securities
that might lead to their subsequent revaluation.

At yearend 1995, in a bold departure from the temptation to disguise the
volatility of its HTM portfolio permitted by FAS 115, PNC was said to be
preparing to transfer all of the HTM portfolio to the AFS classification.
Apparently the bank is now willing to expose all of its securities activity to
market pricing.

The new FASB-driven focus on volatility has changed the way banks view the
purpose of their investment portfolios.  According to the Olson/BAI survey,
chief investment officers most often state that the primary objective of their
securities portfolios is to manage interest rate risk, followed by managing
liquidity.

It would be an understatement to declare that FAS 115 does not get great
support from bankers.  A very legitimate complaint is that it does not allow
for symmetrical market value adjustments to the funding side of securities
positions.  And, like a lot of regulation, it leaves room for inconsistency
among examiners and invites arbitrary enforcement.  It's not clear how much
portfolio shrinkage is due to distaste for the new accounting rules and the
visibility the rules give to investment performance and how much is due to
cyclical effects that sacrifice investment performance in the quest for
liquidity to service loan demand.

Our speculation is that even an imperfect FAS 115 will eventually change the
role and practice of investment management for the better.  Nay-sayers point
out that judging portfolio performance by tracking unrealized gains and losses
does not recognize the awkward role the portfolio must play because it is
routinely whipsawed by the loan market.

In general, if an investment manager is going to take an aggressive position,
it will occur when earnings on the investment portfolio are most critical to
bank profits.  Information on how a bank management team reaches for those
earnings or how it moves cyclically from a liquidity support mode to an
earnings mode ought to be more apparent to users of its financial information.
In this context, market value information ought to add a crucial element of
discipline to future investment management.

Point of view


My vote for the most dynamic banker of the past decade goes to Hugh L.  McColl
Jr., chairman of NationsBank.  I'm not sure he's the best banker, at least not
by the criteria that most people would use, since NationsBank's performance
has tended to be fairly average as measured by traditional yardsticks like
return on assets or loan quality.  I've always thought of McColl as more of a
builder, and banking just happened to be the business that he was in.

McColl was the keynote speaker at a recent industry conference, where he
delivered a stirring wake-up call about the importance of the Internet and
on-line commerce to the industry's future.  McColl is not a tall man, but he
has a deep, booming voice that begins in the soles of his shoes and builds all
the way up.  It was good to hear him say that the industry's greatest threat
is not Microsoft chairman Bill Gates, but rather its own indecisiveness in the
face of change.  McColl is an unlikely person to emerge as banking's most
vocal leader, and yet he played the same role last year with the passage of
interstate banking legislation.  I say "unlikely" because for years, McColl
seemed to have a chip on his shoulder, the hard-bitten ex-Marine who kept a
hand grenade on his desk and had a "war room" where he plotted his merger
strategy.  Who would listen to a guy hell-bent on taking them over?

I've written two stories about McColl since 1987 and learned something each
time.  The first time around, I learned that he doesn't take well to
criticism, as when I wrote that his tough-guy rhetoric was the main reason why
few bankers wanted to merge with him.  His spokesman coolly informed me later
that I had so offended McColl that he wasn't going to talk to the press
anymore.  The second encounter, in 1993, taught me that McColl can be warm and
delightfully down-to-earth as well.  An investment banker told me of flying
into Charlotte, where NationsBank is headquartered, to pitch a deal to McColl,
whom he had not met before.  My source expected someone from the bank to fetch
a colleague and him from the airport-but that "someone" turned out to be
McColl himself, holding up a little sign like a limo driver and grinning from
ear to ear.  Later, as they were racing into town in McColl's BMW, the
chairman spotted a friend who had pulled his car off the highway.  McColl
quickly stopped to see what was wrong.  When they stayed to BS for a while, my
source started thinking this wasn't your normal CEO.

My favorite story also occurred when I was not around.  Photos for the second
piece were shot at a Habitat for Humanity job site, where McColl was helping
build a house.  The photographer told me later that McColl noticed two young
boys playing basketball nearby with a makeshift hoop and backboard.  McColl
disappeared for a while, then returned with a new hoop, which he proceeded to
put up for them.

The point of all this is that McColl might be a more effective leader if
people knew him better.  His trash talk of years past has largely obscured
both his warmth and sense of humor.  The media is partly responsible for this,
but McColl and his advisers share in the blame.  When he appeared on the cover
of Fortune last August crouching with a shotgun while bird hunting, it
reinforced the old image of the hungry predator.  Banking doesn't have leaders
like it did 20 years ago.  It could use a few now, and McColl might fit the
bill if he allowed a fuller, more balanced picture of himself to emerge.

USB Forum:  Talking Mergers


A combination of factors-high stock prices, declining revenue and the fear of
being left behind-helped create a robust market for bank mergers in 1995.  In
an effort to review the year's most significant developments, as well as peer
into the year ahead, U.S.  Banker assembled a crack team of investment bankers
for a thorough discussion about shareholder activism, hostile takeovers and
deal fatigue, to name only a few issues.  The participants were:  Robert A.
Baer Jr., Bear, Stearns & Co.; John Duffy, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods; Kathleen
M.  Fisher, J.P.  Morgan & Co.; J.  Christopher Flowers, Goldman, Sachs & Co.;
John C.  "Hans" Morris, Smith Barney; and Kendrick Wilson, Lazard Freres & Co.
The moderator was John W.  Milligan, editor-in-chief of U.S.  Banker.



USB:  Let's talk a little bit about why 1995 turned out to be such a great
market for bank mergers.  What were some of the things that drove the market?

DUFFY:  The first thing is maybe valuation; stock valuation led the acquirer
universe to be able to pay prices that a lot of the seller universe found
acceptable.  I think you also had a situation with a couple turnarounds where
maybe all of the fixing up had been done.  People like Midlantic, Shawmut and
First Fidelity probably fit that category.  So you had sellers; you had a
universe of people that were maybe not perceived to be sellers two years ago
that today were sellers for a new reason.

WILSON:  I think you might call it a revenue "crunch."  There aren't too many
institutions on their own looking at double-digit revenue growth.  Banks have
benefited from an improvement in credit quality and a steep yield curve, and
now it is tough to get revenue.  Also, many managers are saying, "I can't cut
my expenses any more, I might have to think about an acquisition."

FISHER:  An incredible confluence of events is encouraging merger activity.
Bank stocks are up 50% this year (1995) versus roughly 30% for the market, and
this clearly has made the banks feel well off in terms of their currency.  But
they look ahead and ask where revenue growth is going to come from.  And it is
an amazing dichotomy to have those conversations going on when the stock
prices look so favorable.  So why not use your currency to make an acquisition
now?  It is as good a time as any.  And the sellers appreciate that it is a
great time to sell at these prices, so they are selling.

BAER:  An additional reason is that shareholder activism is responsible for
specific deals; where Michael Price has gone into Chase Manhattan and Michigan
National and taken positions that led directly to those firms turning over.

USB:  Was Michael Price a phenomenon of one-specifically, his involvement with
Chase and whatever pressure he applied there-or does that happen more broadly,
but (in) situations that are not as public?

BAER:  If you look at the 13D filings, there has been-I don't know what the
number would be this year-but probably in the neighborhood of 30 to 40 that
had been filed with a letter attendant to that filing going to the board,
stating that, "We think you should research your various alternatives to
increase shareholder value, including the sale of the bank."  It is not just
Michael, there are several groups out there.



USB:  How many of those situations yielded something similar to what happened
with Chase?

BAER:  I can't think of one of them that so far in 1995 has resulted in the
decision by the institution to sell.

MORRIS:  I think more than the specific cause and effect of a single
shareholder, it is more an aura in the defensiveness of the company that it
creates.  Good management teams are more credible, and the more credible you
are, the less you really care about what any particular shareholder suggests
you should do.  I think many people would say that whether Michael Price
caused the sale of Chase into Chemical is not as much of an issue as whether
it clearly changed the overall tempo and framework in which Chase had to make
decisions.

FISHER:  Shareholder activism has also heightened the sensitivity levels of
directors, and there is now a significant increase in the activism of
directors in many of these situations versus the past.

BAER:  That is important.  The Bank of Boston is an extreme case of where
directors seemingly took the place of management for a while.  I think there
has been a number of examples which have not gone that far, but certainly the
directors are tenfold more involved on a daily basis than they had been in the
past.



USB:  If you are representing a bank that may feel vulnerable to an offer from
another institution, perhaps because it has hit its own revenue wall, and yet
is not ready to surrender its independence, how do you counsel the CEO?  What
is that CEO's obligation when it comes to entertaining a merger offer?

MORRIS:  First off, what is the strategy of the bank?  If you don't have a
plan, you really don't have any reason to think that you can earn a reasonable
return for your shareholders.  Further, you will be forgoing a potential
takeover premium.  I think it is not responsible for a management team to say
we just want an investment banker to defend our position, even though we don't
have a good plan for what to do about it.  The first thing is helping them
sort out strategies of what they can do about this position.

There is a lot of current discussion about that very issue, in terms of what
we mean by the revenue wall and how banks are looking at branches and how they
should be speaking about expenses and efficiencies.  For a long time, banks
had a model that they felt that they could aim towards, and get down to their
peer group in efficiency, and they could adequately manage their
non-performing assets and manage their capital and buy back stock.  It is
clear that you have to go beyond that and have a better plan than your
competitors to be attractive to the market.



USB:  If you have the plan but haven't accomplished it yet, what are you
required to do in terms of reviewing an offer and so on?

MORRIS:  If you have a plan, and you have a good plan, you are not required to
do anything.  You are required to carefully consider things and listen to bona
fide offers.  Ultimately it is the credibility of management and the
confidence that you can create with your own directors and with your ultimate
shareholders-and your ability to execute-that is going to decide whether you
have support for your stock and support to continue to execute that plan.

DUFFY:  Hans is right.  The board needs to be educated in terms of how the
plan will create value for the shareholders.  Otherwise, anybody that walks in
the door with a premium over market could be viewed as legitimate.

WILSON:  Obviously, a plan is important, but if you don't have a good offense,
your defense will be under a lot of pressure.  I think there is no substitute
for frequent and ongoing communication with your shareholders.  A track record
helps.  I think having a board that is well-informed and supportive is key.
This is very important, because many of these activist investors are not shy
about using their telephones or fax machines to contact directors.  There have
been several instances where management with credibility and a good story have
defeated well-organized attacks.  All things being equal, in our experience
management starts with a leg up if they are credible and prepared.



USB:  If you wait until you are under pressure and vulnerable, that is a lousy
time to decide that you need to communicate better with shareholders.

FLOWERS:  Several companies have successfully formulated new plans after
receiving offers.  You might say-in fact I think you would say-it would be
smarter to do it in advance.  That doesn't seem to be necessary.  You asked
what does the company do that has single-digit revenue growth.  One thing
everybody all over the place is doing is buying back their stock in large
quantities and adding two or three percentage points to their growth rate.
That appears to have been a very successful strategy and makes a lot of sense,
I guess.  We will find out.  Maybe they are paying too much for the stock, and
they could have bought it back for less later.  Right now, it seems to make
sense.

The other comment I would make is I think in responding to offers and thinking
about the whole arena, boards and managements have become much more attuned to
the quality of what they are getting.  I don't know if anybody remembers five
or three years ago, I found much more focus on just pure dollars.



USB:  There was at one point this year, and I guess it would have been July or
August, when a series of deals were announced.  It almost seemed like a
frenzy.  What accounted for that?

FLOWERS:  Two factors.  One is, not only the high stock price, but also the
fact that they declined precipitously early in 1995 and then bounced back, and
resulted in managements and boards realizing that it may not be forever that
they can choose their options.  They have to do this at a time when share
prices are high, and that isn't always the case.  And it went through a brief
period where a lot of the options were eliminated and they came back and they
said, "We better get on with this."  The second thing is, I do think there is
a bit of a situation where Party A does a deal and Party B says, "If they did
it, then I will too," and so forth.  For one thing, it makes it more
respectable if your next-door neighbor sells out.

WILSON:  There are two other issues to think about.  First, management
succession can be a factor in deals, particularly among boards where you have
had a very effective and strong CEO who is near retirement with no one
designated as his successor.  A second factor is that many management teams
have equity packages that are worth a lot of money now, as well as severance
arrangements that compensate them for a change of control.

MORRIS:  In some sense, the seminal transaction was First Fidelity in that
light, because here you had someone (Anthony Terracciano) who was not the
typical old CEO, and one who had a lot of institutional credibility.  He was
well-regarded by his peers and well-regarded by the Wall Street analysts, and
he had done extremely well managing that institution.  He laid out in a very
articulate way what his thinking was in deciding to approach a couple of
institutions in a sale, and that led to other boards of directors, and often
individual directors, to call their CEO and ask, "What do we think about
that?"

Frankly, the fundamental facts of the industry are still before us.  There is
revenue growth which is at best five percent for the industry, and you have
some very challenging decisions that need to be made about commitments to
different types of infrastructure, and it is not easy.  And if you have
someone who is a leader like Tony Terracciano coming to the same conclusion, I
think that made it easier for others to go along.  And I don't necessarily
think of this as a cop-out, but it sort of led to a series of discussions
among all banks, which accelerated the trend.

DUFFY:  I think every transaction has an impact on other people's options, and
sometimes they result in fewer options to the remaining institutions, and it
forces them to accelerate their thinking.  Maybe they knew they were going to
sell the institution within the next three years, but all of a sudden one of
their potential partners has just done a deal which precludes the combination
of the two of them.  He now has only two potential partners left.  He would
rather be in the position of negotiating or having an option with two of them
rather than having just one person left on the dance floor.



USB:  The fundamental factors that we have talked about vis-a-vis 1995-a
revenue wall, strong currency, sound asset quality-they all seem to still be
in place today.  What would you anticipate in terms of 1996?

BAER:  I think one thing that will force people to rethink their future is
that many of the companies in the last few years have focused on cost-cutting.
But to the extent that savings have been derived, it is not a recurring
source.  As banks reach the end of their cost-cutting, they have to look
elsewhere for revenue.  I think the banks then have to go back to basics and
ask, "How will we get the revenue up again?"  That is forcing them to turn to
acquisitions as a way to increase revenue.  So, if things stay in place, if
the market remains strong and the P/Es stay high for the acquirers, I think
you will see a continuation of this.

FLOWERS:  I sense a fair amount of deal fatigue out there.  I think with the
huge deals, it is hard to do more than one at a time.  One thing we will see
is people assimilating some of the very large transactions before moving on to
the next one.  That doesn't take that long.  I mean, nine months or a year
later the whole world could change.  In the short run, it will affect the
market.

BAER:  That is exactly right for the bigger deals.  This year we have had far
fewer numerical deals than last year or even the year before.  I don't think
there is the same deal fatigue at the smaller institutions, and I believe we
will probably see in 1996 more smaller transactions rather than larger
transactions.



USB:  Deal fatigue:  Chris, is that a reason why it seems that in the last two
or three months (deal) volume has really flattened out?

FLOWERS:  I think that is some of it.  There are a certain number of potential
deals, and we went into it, we used a lot of that in 1995, and I think there
will be somewhat less until everybody reloads.

MORRIS:  I sense that a pricing discrepancy has begun to emerge.  You have
seen some very high prices get paid on a price-to-book basis, and that has led
to higher expectations on the part of sellers, and yet at the same time, I
think lower expectations on the part of buyers, which could be a function of
deal fatigue, but also a sense of uncertainty about how to value
infrastructure systems.  However, the seller's expectations have not evolved
at all.  Five percent revenue growth and larger provisions coming in 1996-and
we see evidence of that all over the place-is inconsistent with some of these
valuations.  I think that you will have some significant discrepancies emerge.



USB:  There were several deals this year that were priced a little bit north
of two times book, and involved some fairly significant dilution.  Were buyers
finally cooled off by shareholders who weren't anxious to see them pay quite
that much for deals?

BAER:  The marketplace actually let them get away with it, by and large.

DUFFY:  It has been pretty tolerant.

BAER:  Three years ago, maybe we would think three percent dilution and earn
out in a year and a half or something, and that is comfortable.  We are in a
stage far beyond that with a lot of transactions.  I am just a little
astounded that the market has been acquiescent of the banks taking the stand
that they have got a birthright to do one large strategic deal.  I don't think
that same tolerance would have been there three or four years ago.

FISHER:  Investors have generally been favorably disposed toward bank
acquisitions this year.  Many of the stocks of the acquirors have bumped back
to their preexisting prices eight or ten days or less after an acquisition is
announced.  The market has been quite willing to believe that projected
savings are achievable.



USB:  Would each of you tell me what you think the most significant deal in
1995 has been so far, and why?

WILSON:  I think the situation involving First Interstate (which is being
pursued in a hostile takeover by Wells Fargo & Co.)  subsumes virtually all of
the elements that we have been talking about.  I think it is a long way from
over.  It could be a precursor of some additional activity, and I think will
certainly bring to the floor all of the issues that we talked about in terms
of shareholder activism.  I think that is an extremely significant
transaction.

FISHER:  I have to agree with that.  Certainly when looking back several years
from now, this deal will be memorable because it is big and dramatic.  And
maybe we can even hypothesize that one of the reasons there is a bit of a
pause in the market now is that all of the banks are watching to see how this
transaction unfolds, because it does have a lot of precedent-setting aspects
to it.  But I think we can't give short shrift to all of the other large deals
that were done this year, because each one of them did set new precedents.
The Chase and Chemical merger certainly should be looked upon as an
extraordinary transaction in the U.S.

MORRIS:  I already (noted) one earlier, so I will add First Chicago and NBD to
my list.  When it happened, it kind of refocused many of us on the
opportunities of mergers of equals.  The recent transactions leading up to
that deal indicated that there was tremendous investor pressure on an
institution to sell out at a premium.  And the fact that First Chicago and NBD
were able to convince investors on the value, balance street restructuring and
business line benefits of the combination, led to an immediate improved
valuation for both companies' stocks.  That was very significant, compared to
the transactions that were leading up to it.

DUFFY:  I agree with Kenny that First Interstate stole the limelight from the
rest of the sector, for at least the time being, and it has implications.  I
think First Fidelity was kind of interesting in that it was the first big
interregional deal, and that was kind of like the dam breaking a little bit.
One that probably may not be mentioned was Fleet/Shawmut in terms of the
market dominance that it created in New England.  I don't think that you have
seen that in other places else yet.  In the Midwest or Southeast, it is still
pretty fragmented.

FLOWERS:  I think since we have run out of significant deals, I will suggest
the company that got the luckiest this year.  I will offer up United Counties
Trust Co., which managed to get a double dip and was acquired first by
Meridian and then by CoreStates.

BAER:  That was not strategic.

FLOWERS:  That was luck.

BAER:  If it is one deal, it is First Interstate.  It easily is something that
none of us have seen on that scale before, and/or complexity.  And I think
what's going to be very interesting is the way politics has entered into this
transaction, because we have grown into a situation realizing that we have an
inefficient banking system, and the economics are driving the system to
consolidate to make it more efficient.  We now have politicians who are trying
to keep the inefficiencies for political votes.

We have already got politics starting to enter into the First Interstate
transaction.  It is such a public forum, it will be an ideal place for the
politicians to continue to play.  I think it will be interesting to see how
politics ends up influencing the final transaction.



USB:  Would you expect to see banks continue to build their product
capabilities by doing more focused transactions, consumer finance being one?

BAER:  I think you would, if the banks could.  The difficulty is that the
mono-line companies, whether it is the B/C auto lenders or equity home lenders
today, sell for around 25 and 30 times earnings because there is such huge
growth potential.  But even the pure credit card companies, the pure finance
companies and other business lines that the banks would find very attractive
to enter through acquisition, are all selling at higher multiples than the
banks.  So it becomes a conundrum.  I think there is probably a high desire
and a low capability.



USB:  It makes you wonder about the future of the full-service,
brick-and-mortar bank if it doesn't find some way of taking all of those
product capabilities and tying them together to add value.

DUFFY:  I think we are in the bottom of the third inning, and some people are
talking like it is the eighth inning.  And you look at the Chase/Chemical pro
forma market cap, and it is $20-odd billion.  I mean, supposing tomorrow
Merrill Lynch decided that they wanted to sell-who could they sell to?
Probably a bank.  Banks don't have the P/E today, but I think they have the
cumulative market cap to be a player.  They have consistently lost market
share to the more innovative players, whether it is a mortgage bank or asset
management company or auto finance company, but a bank winds up acquiring them
at some point later in the cycle.

While the market share of the banks has declined dramatically over the past 10
years, the market cap of the industry still (overshadows) most of the
competition.  I think the industry is not dead, and some of the more
progressive players are starting to surface as giant financial intermediaries.
I don't know who the ultimate winners will be.  I think it is still pretty
early in the game.

Retail Banking:  Ringing Up New Customers


Large and brightly decorated, the sign in the Safeway supermarket had a
simple, but symbolic message:  "Now Hiring Bright, Motivated People Our
Customers Will Like."  Interestingly enough, it could serve equally well as a
recruiting poster for any bank that is beginning to open new branches in
retail establishments like supermarkets.

Such signs clearly underscore an attitude bankers are adopting as they embrace
customers on their own turf-in stores where they do the weekly shopping.
Chasing new customers in this ever-changing, highly competitive marketplace
requires new marketing skills, shedding the stodginess and acting like
retailers.

While in-store banking isn't a new phenomenon, it is a fast-growing trend that
clearly has bankers excited.  Community banks, superregionals and even thrifts
are embracing the idea.

Many are staking out prime locations, hoping to gain an advantage over
competitors, while others are developing branches in areas where they didn't
have a banking presence.  While supermarkets have historically made good
partners, they aren't the only homes for in-store branches.  General
merchandise stores like Kmart and Wal-Mart are quickly becoming good locations
as well.

In 1995, the nation's largest banks accelerated their efforts.  Wells Fargo &
Co., BankAmerica Corp., Union Bank, BayBanks Inc., Barnett Banks Inc.,
National City Corp.  and First State Bank all expanded their operations.

The in-store movement has produced more than 3,000 branches, and many more
ribbon-cutting ceremonies are planned for this year.  National Commerce
Services, a Memphis-based consulting arm of National Commerce Bancorp.,
forecasts as many as 5,000 branches by the year 2000.

"Banks are looking for alternative distribution networks," explains Kathleen
Holmes, managing director of the Wharton Financial Institutions Center in
Philadelphia.  "They're doing it for strategic reasons.  Some are entering new
markets.  Others are opening branches where the local market isn't strong
enough to support a traditional branch."

Proponents believe the rewards make the venture worthwhile.  "An in-store
branch can be more profitable quicker than a brick-and-mortar branch."
explains John W.  Garnett, president of International Banking Technologies, in
Norcross, GA.  "There are lower startup costs, a captive audience-a majority
of whom are not already customers."

For example, studies reveal that store branches are less expensive to build
and often become profitable much sooner than traditional branches.
Supermarket branches cost $150,000 to $200,000 to install, while the tab for
traditional branches ranges between $800,000 and $3 million.  Once in
operation, they are also quicker to yield profits.  "In-store branches should
break even in about 18 months," contends NCS president Douglas W.  Ferris Jr.
"If they are not breaking even in two-and-a-half years, something is wrong.
It usually takes a traditional branch about three years to become profitable."

In the '80s, success came easily for the supermarket pioneers.  With access to
30,000 to 60,000 weekly supermarket customers, they attracted new prospects
much faster than traditional branches.  Customers embraced the concept.
One-stop convenience, services that surpassed those of the automated teller
machines and interactive relationships with live tellers were the drawing
cards.  Customers marveled at the thought of applying for a car loan while
completing their weekly grocery shopping.

And sometimes a bank really hits the jackpot.  One elderly gentleman opened a
$1 million savings account at a southern supermarket branch because he felt
safer.  "In a supermarket, a person walking out with groceries doesn't expose
themselves.  No one knows that they've cashed their check.  It's not uncommon
to see customers open very large accounts at supermarket branches," explains
Garnett.

For many, the benefits continue.  Throughout the country, supermarket bankers
report impressive financial results.  Many produced spectacular revenues
during their first few months of operation.  In Memphis, the Tri-State Bank
proudly touts how it opened 1,155 new deposit accounts during the first
quarter of '95.  Twelve hundred miles away in North Dakota, the First National
Bank's Hugo branch celebrated its 288th new account.

But the novelty has pretty much worn off, and customers want more than mere
convenience.  And there have been some failures.  Banks that entered a local
grocery store without studying the local demographics or developing a
strategic plan for serving that customer base generally have not done as well.
"Some banks have (treated) them like a branch, but they don't work like a
traditional branch," notes Holmes.  "They are more like a community bank.  You
have a closed community, so your capacity to the market is more like that of a
community bank."

Success begins with knowing the difference between supermarket and
brick-and-mortar branches.

"The key to success is in hiring the right staff," explains Garnett.  "You
also must have frequent marketing and promotional programs, as well as
streamlining operations and freeing up people to go out into the aisles and
sell."

The People's Bank of Connecticut grasped that concept a few years ago.  Today,
it operates 45 branches in Stop 'N Shop stores and plans another 46 by the end
of next year.

"You have to change your thinking," suggests Bryan Huebner, senior vice
president with the human resources and strategic planning unit for the bank.
"You have to advertise, market and sell, Huebner says.  "That requires
employees who are experts in our products.  They must understand how the
products serve the needs of our customers.  We also need employees who know
that the real game is talking to as many customers as possible."

BankAmerica launched its first in-store branch 10 years ago.  As an industry
leader with more than 180 in-store branches, the San Francisco-based giant
foresees future success through further expansion into the supermarket arena.

"To capitalize, you have to do things differently," cautions William G.
Raymond, senior vice president for retail distribution at BankAmerica.  "You
need to hire different kinds of people.  You need to train differently.  You
have to set different goals and you need different operating practices.

"One of the keys to success is getting out into the aisles and meeting
prospects," he explains.  "That's not something that many traditional bankers
feel comfortable doing.  We like to have people who are not specialized
tellers or sellers.  You need people who can do many things."

Raymond believes banks should train their sales force to act more like their
store colleagues and maintain a quality relationship with their host grocer.
Such mundane, non-banking chores as knowing how to operate the public address
system and learning the location of store merchandise are also important.  For
instance, it might not be a bad idea to know where various items are located
in the store-just in case a customer happens to ask.

Learning how to read body language is another important skill.  "You should
know when the customer wants to be bothered and how long you hold their
attention," he explains.

Supermarket bankers may want to provide the same products and services as a
conventional branch, but they have to work quicker.  "Because customers don't
want to stand in your lines long and don't have much time, you have to be able
to open checking accounts in five minutes.  You have to be able to provide
them with quick loan approvals," Ferris explains.

Technology:  EDS Nabs a Customer at Alltel's Expense


By signing a seven-year check-processing contract with EDS Corp., Republic
National Bank of New York gave Alltel Corp.  the cold shoulder.

Alltel had already sold most of its check-processing business to Fiserv Inc.,
but it held on to its account with Republic, which dated back to 1993.  The
Little Rock, AR, company, formerly known as Systematics, put its check unit on
the block early this year after it took a $32-million write-off from a failed
investment in imaging technology.

Fiserv executive vice president Dean Schmelzer would not disclose the amount
his firm paid for Alltel's check business, although an EDS executive put the
value of his firm's business with Republic at $40 million.  When looked at
together, the two transactions make it clear that the check outsourcing
business has boiled down to a two-way competition between EDS and Fiserv.
There are other players in this market, including Transys, which is part of
CoreStates Financial Corp., and the Global Processing Alliance, a joint
venture between Bankers Trust New York Corp.  and First Fidelity Bancorp.  But
EDS and Fiserv have been the most aggressive at signing up new customers.

That aggression is partly driven by a desire to build volume and generate
economies of scale.  EDS and Fiserv both seem intent on gaining a large enough
client base to make imaging technology cost-effective.

"We've made a commitment to provide image capability to our clients," says
Schmelzer.  But in order to make it work, "you've to have the volume."

Alltel's inability to deploy image technology successfully isn't discouraging
either EDS or Fiserv from going ahead with their own plans to use imaging,
although both data-processing companies will move forward slowly.  It will be
at least a year before EDS converts Republic to imaging.  For the time being,
EDS will process the New York bank's checks using conventional technology.
Two California thrifts for which EDS does item processing, Great Western
Financial Corp.  and First Nationwide, will be converted to imaging much
sooner, but they have been EDS customers for several years.

The problems Alltel ran into make it clear that imaging technology is far more
complicated than has been acknowledged, but EDS is still confident it will
avoid the same mishaps because it is working closely with IBM Corp.  to modify
that supplier's system to its own needs.  The Dallas company is taking an
approach that lets it avoid redesigning its check operations from top to
bottom, which is what most imaging installations have called for until now,
says Dan Talbott, EDS' vice president for its check operations.

Most of EDS' current check-processing system will remain intact, apart from an
imaging camera that will be inserted into the middle of the operation.  The
data sent to the mainframe that manages the check shop will look essentially
the same as it does with a system running conventional technology.

"What we're doing allows us to leverage our existing platform," Talbott says.

If done according to plan, imaging technology will help both firms reduce
their costs, says Fiserv's Schmelzer.  In the hotly competitive outsourcing
business, survival is quickly becoming dependent upon being a low-cost
provider.


A Small Shift Away From Big Business

There's been a modest but meaningful increase in the percentage of banks' cash
management revenue stemming from small business customers, according to the
latest cash management survey from Ernst & Young.

Some 17% of the proceeds in cash management-where banks manage corporations'
direct deposit, wire transfer and accounts payable and receivable-came from
small businesses in 1994, up slightly from 15% in 1993.

Large corporate customers still accounted for a significant plurality of cash
management revenue, about 38%, but that figure is off from the 44% they
contributed in 1993.

To some extent, this increase could have been anticipated.  In recent years,
Fortune 500 firms and other large bank customers have sharply reduced the
number of banks from which they purchase cash management services, according
to Larry Forman, a manager with Ernst & Young.  On the other hand, banks have
increased the number of products suited for their small business clients.

"Small business has become an important segment," Forman says.

This shift is even more pronounced for mid-sized regionals and smaller banks,
where small business customers contribute 29% of cash management revenue.  For
the largest regional and money center banks, small businesses only account for
7% of cash management.  These big banks are still heavily dependent upon the
biggest corporate accounts, getting some 46% of their cash management revenue
from them.  But even for them, that figure is down.  In last year's survey,
the industry's behemoths garnered some 50% of their revenue from their largest
accounts.

The greater dependence on small businesses helps explain why so many banks
have rushed into the market with cash management software, according to Linda
Vanadis, an assistant vice president with Boatmen's Bancshares Inc.  The
$32-billion-asset St.  Louis regional company is one of several banks that has
begun marketing a personal computer-based cash management software program in
the last few years.

Vanadis says that many small business clients have bought PCs already loaded
with Microsoft Corp.'s Windows for their accounting and other business
functions, and many banks have decided that if they are to serve this market,
they must sell a cash management system that runs on Windows.

Networks' Age And Size Cut Debit Card Fees

The largest debit card networks also have some of the lowest fees, according
to the latest data book from Debit Card News, a Faulkner & Gray publication.

Interlink, the debit card network owned by Visa International, not only
processes 15 million transactions a month, which is by far the largest number
of any network, it also charges a switch fee of only 3 cents a transaction.
By comparison, Explore, the next largest network that is owned by the West
Coast automated teller network, Star System Inc.  of San Diego, charges 5
cents.  Most of the other large regional networks charge roughly 5 cents to 8
cents per transaction.

"The older the programs are, the more the fees have come down," says Art
Clark, a partner with Business Dynamics, a consulting firm in Nyack, NY.
"It's a function of cost and market pressure.  There's just no way that a POS
transaction can carry the same cost" as a check or cash transaction.  About
the only way to entice retailers into accepting debit transactions is to make
electronic payments less expensive than paper ones.

The West Coast was one of the first markets where debit cards were widely
used, and the networks with a heavy concentration of accounts there, Interlink
and Explore, have the lowest fees.  By comparison, networks in the Midwest,
such as Cash Station and Magic Line, have some of the highest fees.  Their
home markets, Illinois and Michigan, were relative latecomers to the debit
card party, adopting this technology several years after the networks in
California and Texas.  Magic Line's switch fee is 13 cents, while Cash
Station's is 11 cents.


Fed Fills Its Technology Gaps

Now that the Federal Reserve System's massive computer system consolidation is
just about finished, the central bank's Automation Services group has shuffled
its organizational structure and hired a former KeyCorp executive as the first
chief information officer in its history.  He will supervise the nine
mainframes the Fed runs out of three data centers.

"In the first few years of FRAS (Federal Reserve Automation Services), there
was a focus on setting the organization up," says Robert Tucker, the Fed's new
senior vice president for computer operations and technical support.  Until
last fall, he had been an executive vice president for Key Services Corp.  in
Cleveland.

Prior to the formation of FRAS in 1992, each of the Fed's 12 district banks
had its own data center.  But the cost of maintaining them was very high, and
since the cost of long-distance telecommunications has dropped sharply, the
Fed closed nine of the existing centers and created three large ones in
Richmond, VA, where FRAS is headquartered; Dallas and East Rutherford, NJ.
Tucker, will report to Carl Powell, the Fed's director of automation
resources, until Powell retires later this year.

Two communications centers are also part of the FRAS network, one in Richmond
and another in Chicago.  There are four other groups within the FRAS
umbrella-support services, administrative services, national network services
and planning and customer support.

Big Changes At The FDIC

Don't look for business as usual at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., where
chairman Ricki Helfer is shaking things up bigtime.

First and foremost, the agency is shrinking-understandably so from
unrealistically high levels created during the last recession, when failures
were running at a near-record pace.  Helfer says that expenses were to be
trimmed 20% in 1995 and staffing was to be cut 14%; altogether, staff levels
will have fallen by more than a third from mid-1993.  She won't predict just
where core staffing will settle, but says "it will be far less" than it is
now.  In November, the agency announced a buyout program intended to spur 500
employees to leave voluntarily.

"I want to run the FDIC the way a business operates-by striving for greater
productivity and enhanced performance, by using rigorous cost/benefit analysis
and by relying on up-to-date management concepts and technology," Helfer told
the America's Community Bankers convention in a speech in late October.

In a subsequent interview, Helfer said she had brought the FDIC its first-ever
strategic and operating plans.  The first is a five-year plan; the latter,
which looks out 12 to 18 months, is more flexible and encompasses some 150
projects.  "We are viewing the familiar as if we had never seen it before,"
she said.

The chairman also noted that she is asking staffers to concentrate anew on the
ability to assess broad risk-not just clean up in its aftermath.  Too often
the agency has tended "to look at the trees (individual banks) and not the
forest," she argues, adding that it's critical to understand the impact of
state legislation, regional economic distinctions and rolling recessions.

Helfer cheered many in the ACB audience when she promised to reduce the
regulatory burden, especially that falling "disproportionately on smaller
institutions."  Time spent on examinations is dropping as the agency turns
more to computerization; she said that 10 hours have been trimmed off
compliance exams since last January, and five hours off Community Reinvestment
Act exams.

Not surprisingly, there are rumblings that agency morale is less than robust
as further job cuts loom.  But Helfer is marching ahead to an ambitious
refrain.  "We must," she says, "move from the New Deal into the new
millenium."


What Does Future Hold For The FHLBS?

Just what is the mission of the Federal Home Loan Bank System?  Most
knowledgeable people in Washington would say promoting housing finance.  But
the chairman of the Federal Housing Finance Board, which oversees the
FHLBanks, says that may not turn out to be its role, going forward.

Bruce Morrison, who became the FHFB chief last year, says a key role is to
provide "local credit availability in cases where that isn't necessarily
available"-in a community where deposits are scant, for instance.  Members of
the FHLB System routinely use it for advances for housing finance, as well as
for low-cost borrowings.

"I think the system would be likely to survive as it is, but it would be
under-utilized," he says.  Morrison argues that the system needs "regulatory
room to develop, and not a narrow blueprint from Congress."  But Republicans
in the House, in their budget-trimming zeal, have been eying
government-sponsored ventures like the FHLB System for an amputation, if not
outright execution.

Morrison contends that system membership should be fully voluntary-a notion
that pleases thrifts, many of whom have been mandatory members for many years,
carrying large FHLB balances as assets on their books.  Commercial banks,
however, have been admitted since 1989 as voluntary members, free to come and
go as they wish.

The FHFB chairman says the board is in the "bizarre position" of being both
regulator of the system and the statutory issuer of its debt, a position it's
trying to extricate itself from.  Meanwhile, the board has been working on
ways to delegate more management functions to the district banks.  "We'll set
the compliance standards, and they'll determine how" to reach those, he says.
A laudable goal.  Now we'll see if Congress goes along and spares the ax.

Getting Credit For Profits


The industry's strong profitability in recent years has done wonders for bank
balance sheets, not to mention credit ratings.  If you assigned a numerical
value to every rating on the Duff & Phelps Credit Rating Co.  scale-one for
AAA, two for AA+ and so on-the average rating for a bank holding company in
the firm's universe in 1991 was 7.3, or between A- and BBB+.  This average had
improved to 6.3 (A/A-) by year-end 1993, and to 5.8 by the end of 1994-which
is a good solid A, leaning toward A+.

But the pace of upgrades has slowed dramatically since 1992 and 1993, explains
D&P group vice president Charles Orabutt.  D&P upgraded 24 banks in 1992, 15
in 1993 and only 12 last year.

Realistically, industry balance sheets may be as strong as they're going to
get.  A great many institutions are over-reserved for loan losses, and some of
them have so much excess capital that they've been buying back stock (U.S.
Banker, January 1995).  Any further improvements in credit ratings will
probably come from the earnings side, which is where Orabutt and his band of
bank debt analysts have turned their attention for now.  "We're really
focusing on business line profitability," he says.  "That's the linchpin to
further rating upgrades."

What businesses does D&P like?  It's keen on consumer lending because it tends
to have higher margins, although Orabutt cautions that banks need to have the
right controls in place, since too many of them still try to grow at a 10%
rate when the economy only offers 5%.  Orabutt also favors
technology-intensive, fee-based businesses like check clearing and payments
processing.  And for all the bad press that derivatives have garnered of late,
he figures that providing risk management products to end users will also be a
winner.

ATM USAGE EXPLODES IN '95


Transaction volume on automated teller machines nationwide shot up 14.6% for a
12-month period ending in September 1995, compared to 9.7% in 1994 and only
6.9% in 1993.  The deployment of ATMs also grew 11.3% for the year, and while
this was down from 15% in 1994, it was still the second best performance in a
decade.  The gold medal, however, goes to point of sale:  transaction volume
increased by 37%, while the number of terminals expanded by 47%.  These were
among the findings of an annual survey of the electronic funds transfer
industry conducted by Bank Network News, a twice-monthly newsletter published
by Faulkner & Gray Inc.

Many of the leading ATM networks also posted strong volume gains.  The
country's largest network-Star System-reported a 26.4% gain in transactions
for the 12-month period.

Among the factors cited for the strong growth in overall ATM volume was the
strong likelihood that ATM and POS usage tend to feed one another.  "The
consumer says, 'This card will do everything,'" Tom Bass, president of
Washington-based Exchange network told Bank Network News.  Another possibility
is that a sharp increase in the number of off-premise ATMs is driving the
growth in those transactions.

Internet Security:  The Saga Continues


They may get along with each other about as well as House Speaker Newt
Gingrich and President Clinton, but it seems that Visa International and
MasterCard International are once-again talking turkey about a common standard
for protecting payments over the Internet.

A September announcement that Visa and Microsoft Corp.  would cooperate in
designing a new standard-leaving MasterCard out in the cold-was apparently all
the result of a misunderstanding.  At least that's what the parties now say.

But it seems that at some point there was a disagreement over how the
suppliers of Internet security software would be compensated.  Microsoft was
said to have wanted 0.4% of the value of all card transactions made through
the Internet, according to a November story in USA Today.  The same piece also
alleged that Visa's members, outraged by Microsoft's asking price, forced the
card association back to the bargaining table with MasterCard.

But Microsoft never wanted to be paid on that basis, says Mark Kroese, its
director of electronic commerce; rather the software giant simply wants
royalties from software developers that write programs for Internet commerce.
This is the same source of revenue that IBM Corp., which is part of
MasterCard's camp, will seek.

Spokespeople for both card associations say they never really stopped
discussing the issue, but somehow Visa and Microsoft went ahead with
announcing their security standard without MasterCard's participation.  Back
in June, the associations had said they would announce a standard together.

"We never stopped talking, and we're optimistic about" a common standard, said
David Melancon, a Visa spokesman.  He also said Visa wouldn't pay Microsoft
any transaction fees over the long haul for the security standard, but it
might do so temporarily to cover some development costs.

Melancon also said that Visa was never that out of sync with its members.
"The feedback hasn't been 100% positive" he said, "but it's never 100%
positive on anything.  It's not like they made us do a 360 (degree turn)."

But William Randle, a senior vice president for Huntington Bancshares Inc.
Visa's electronic payments advisory board, says all 22 members of warned the
assdociation in the summer of 1994 not to pursue a relationship with
Microsoft.  Visa later changed the makeup of the board and transferred
responsibility for the board to its home banking subsidiary, Visa Interactive.

The Death Of Spread


Two years ago, bankers could make a pretty good living using cheap sources of
funding to invest in U.S.  Treasury securities.  They didn't have to lend to
get an adequate return; they could simply take cheap short-term funds and use
them to buy higher-yielding treasury bonds, while pocketing a nice spread.
And here was the real beauty of it all:  A U.S.  Treasury bond has no credit
risk (Washington's six-day shutdown in late mid-November over the budget
impasse notwithstanding).

Those days are long gone, of course.  Lenders have opened the credit spigot so
much since then-especially to consumers-that many people now fret they've been
too aggressive.  The spread game seems to have officially ended in mid-1995
when the yield curve-which is the difference between source of funds like Fed
funds or core deposits and the interest rate on investment securities like
treasuries-took on the appearance of a flat line.  Normally, the yield on
treasuries will be higher than the underlying cost of funds, and this margin
becomes more pronounced the further out you go on the investment spectrum,
since a 30-year bond pays a higher rate of interest than a two-year note.

Why did the yield curve flatten out?  The Federal Reserve started tightening
short-term rates in February 1994 and didn't stop until July 1995, when after
a long series of increases it finally cut rates by a modest 25 basis points.
Obviously, those increases put fierce pressure on margins from below.  At the
same time-and somewhat ironically-a generally optimistic view of inflation and
the economy helped bring down rates on long-term bonds, which squeezed margins
from above.

Theodore H.  Tung, Ph.D., chief economist at National City Corp., points out
that 30-year treasuries normally yield at least 1% more than two-year notes,
but that spread has now shrunk to 70 basis points.  "Even more unusual is the
recent disappearance of the spread between yields on two-year notes and the
Fed Funds rate," wrote Dr.  Tung in the November 1995 issue of Financial
Market Outlook, his monthly financial commentary.  "(This) spread has averaged
more than 1% over the past three years."

A flat yield curve is bad news for banks-or at least for their investments in
securities.  "Because the cost of funds is so high, there's no spread," Dr.
Tung explains.  And this largely explains why lenders became so much more
aggressive in 1995.  As the cost of funds went up, they had to turn to
higher-yielding loans instead.  "That's why you see the industry competing for
consumer loans-especially credit cards," he says.  Cards loans at, say, 10%
enable a lender to cover its funding costs and still make a profit.

"National Home Ownership Strategy:  Partners in the American Dream," an
amalgam of more than 50 housing organizations, continues to press toward its
goal of raising the national home ownership rate to 67.5% by 2000, from 64.7%
today.  Henry Cisneros, secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban
Development, says the target rate would add eight million home owners in five
years.

Equifax, si.  The Mexican government has given the Atlanta-based credit
information company the go-ahead to create a consumer credit information
system that will offer on-line access to Mexican banks, retailers and
businesses.  Equifax, which had applied for permission last May, is already
operating in other Latin American nations such as Chile and Argentina.

Amerin Corp., the Chicago-based mortgage insurer that was the focus of a
December feature story ("Amerin Finds LPMI Isn't the Only Path"), completed
its initial public offering Nov.  29.  The stock quickly soared from its $16
offering price, hitting $27 by mid-December.  The company, which raised over
$213 million in the offering, called the response "a strong endorsement of the
concept of wholesale mortgage insurance."

You won't find many institutional investors crabbing about high CEO salaries,
according to a new study by Russell Reynolds Associates, the major recruiting
firm.  Fifty-six percent of those polled voted strongly against limiting such
pay, and nearly all respondents favored tying CEO compensation to company
performance-letting it ride up, untethered, as long as the corporation and its
stockholders are going with it.

Now accepting the American Express card is that most blue-collar of retail
outlets, Wal-Mart.  AmEx claimed in a news release that more than 14,000
cardholders had written or phoned in 1995 to urge an acceptance agreement with
the world's largest retailer.  Convenience aside, the deal is one more sign
that the elite image AmEx cultivated in the 1980s is giving way to something
more practical.

Branch Sales:  Branches:  There's Still a Market


Sanford Belden is one of those bankers who, with good reason, has every right
to call the industry's staid, familiar brick-and-mortar outposts more trouble
than their worth.

Belden, who is president and chief executive of Community Bank System Inc.  in
Syracuse, NY, had his plans to make the three-hour drive west to his branch in
the hamlet of Olean shredded by the early December storm that dumped three
feet of snow on Buffalo.  That would be enough to convince anyone that it's a
lot easier to bank electronically than in person.  Yet Belden remains devoted
to the 49 branches his company owns in small towns along the rural northern
and western fringes of New York State.

"Having the physical geographic presence is key to our strategy," Belden says.
"We'll look at enhanced ATMs, and we'll look at PC banking.  We view the
alternative delivery as a constructive adjunct to what we do in the branches,
but we think the branch remains the focus of our strategy."

Having a strategy focused on conventional branches was the main reason
Community Bank picked up 17 branches holding $450 million in deposits from
Chase Manhattan Corp.  last July.  A few months later, the $1.1-billion-asset
Syracuse-based company sold three of those branches to NBT Inc., a banking
company in Norwich, NY.  Those offices were in Utica, which is well east of
Community's geographic market.

Of course, central New York state was hardly the only corner of the country
where branches were traded like so much horseflesh.  Plenty of banks large and
small were active in the branch sale business, and few, if any, of them could
be described as iconoclasts swimming against the electronic banking tide, in
which increasing waves of transactions are being done by personal computer,
automated teller and even the Internet.

Rather, they described strategies that were very similar to Belden's-using
ATMs, telephones and PCs to offload most simple transactions like deposits,
withdrawals and balance transfers.  That leaves branches, and branch
personnel, available for the personal attention and the sales pitches that can
increase revenue.

All told, there were some $23 billion in deposits bought and sold in 1995,
according to U.S.  Banker's sixth annual ranking of branch sale advisory
firms.  Yet two-thirds of that total can be attributed to just one deal.  In
September, GreenPoint Financial Corp.  of Flushing, NY, purchased $8.1 billion
in deposits from H.F.  Ahmanson Corp.'s New York operations.  J.P.  Morgan
Co., which advised GreenPoint, and CS First Boston Corp., which advised
Ahmanson, each got credit for the full value of the deposits, and as a result
shared first place.  Without that exchange, there would have been only $6.7
billion in branch deposits changing hands.  In both 1994 and 1993, about $7.5
billion in deposits were bought and sold.

Different Climate

The last three years have been much tamer than the gold rush period of 1990
and 1991, when the Resolution Trust Corp.  was unloading thrift branches by
the truckload.  Now that the RTC is for all practical purposes defunct, branch
sales seem to be returning to a more predictable level of activity.

Interestingly, while most banks are increasing their investments in electronic
services and many banks are shuttering branches, those branches that are put
on the block are commanding high prices.

In 1995, branch deposits generated a 7.3% premium, according to Hovde
Financial Inc., an investment banking firm in Washington.  The premium is the
percentage of deposits that a purchasing bank must pay the seller.  In 1994,
premiums were 5.3%, while from 1991 through 1993 they averaged only 2.6%.

The lure of retail branches has steadily increased in the last several years,
says Bill Boyan, a vice president at Hovde.  One big reason:  It is much
cheaper to buy an existing branch than to start one up de novo.  For example,
Fifth Third Bancorp., which first moved into Cleveland five years ago,
announced it would essentially double its Cleveland franchise once it closed
on its purchase of 28 branches from First Nationwide Bank, the San
Francisco-based thrift.

Cleveland is a mature market, and there are few available sites for new
branches.  "That factors into the premium," says Robert Niehaus, the executive
vice president who runs Fifth Third's affiliate banking groups.  In 1995,
Fifth Third paid just a shade over the industry norm, or about 8% for retail
deposits, Niehaus says.

Fifth Third was one of the busiest branch acquirers last year.  In addition to
the $17-billion-asset company's September announcement of its deal for the
First Nationwide offices, it also bought PNC Bank Corp.'s 12 Dayton branches
in May.  In October, it bought NBD Bancorp.'s 25 Ohio branches, and finally in
November, Fifth Third bought seven Banc One Corp.  branches in Cincinnati.

Niehaus justifies the purchases with reasoning that Community Bank's Belden
would find familiar.  "There are still a significant number of our customers
who want to do face-to-face banking, and secondly it allows us to cross-sell
products to our customers," Niehaus says.

Fifth Third's branch-buying spree underscores the notion that conventional
branches still have an articulated purpose.  Few banks are more committed to
electronic services than Fifth Third, yet it was willing to pay a premium for
branches in some selected markets.

This was also true for Huntington Bancshares Inc., which bought four branches
with $138 million in deposits from Banc One in Springfield, OH, a community of
70,000 people about midway between Dayton and Columbus.

"Is there still room for a full-service branch?"  Thomas Prendergast, a
Huntington senior vice president asks rhetorically.  "Sure there is."
Huntington, despite its development of eight "Huntington Access" branches that
rely almost completely upon ATMs and video kiosks, still has more than 340
conventional branches in Ohio and seven other states.

Complementary Methods

From Prendergast's point of view, the purchase of the four Banc One
branches-two of which were promptly closed upon the deal's completion-hardly
undermines Huntington's commitment to electronic banking.  Rather, each of
Huntington's means of reaching its clientele-whether it's through conventional
branches, the all-electronic branches, PC banking at home, phone banking or
ATMs-all complement one another.

Prendergast, who is the senior Huntington executive for the Springfield
market, simply sees the acquired branches as a means of giving more Huntington
customers more ways to reach the bank.  Now that the bank has six branches in
Springfield, it will open a seventh outlet this year.  This site will not be a
branch, however, but a drive-up ATM in a shopping mall.

The message that comes through all this buying and selling is that electronic
banking has its purpose, but so does the branch.  More importantly, not only
can the two co-exist, but managed intelligently, they can complement one
another.  Despite the growing importance of electronic banking, there are some
communities where the branch will likely remain the primary means of serving
customers.

For example, few states are as top-heavy with behemoth holding companies as
North Carolina.  In Charlotte, there are NationsBank Corp.  and First Union
Corp.  Then there's Winston-Salem, where Wachovia Corp.  and Southern National
Corp.  are based.  Most of them are also among the industry's technological
elite, with PC banking programs and smart card initiatives that regularly grab
headlines.

Yet Triangle Bancorp, an $800-million-asset Raleigh company that does all of
its business in the state, has carved out a nice niche for itself in the rural
communities east of Interstate 95.  For the most part, its larger competitors
do the bulk of their business out of North Carolina, and most of the in-state
business they do is based in the large cities in the state's middle and
western sectors-Charlotte, Winston-Salem, Durham and Greensboro.

Triangle bought four Raleigh branches with $55 million in deposits from First
Union, and it also purchased three NationsBank branches with deposits of $49
million in two small towns in the eastern part of North Carolina.

"The acquisitions have mostly filled gaps in our markets," says Debra Lee,
Triangle's chief financial officer.  "We still consider ourselves a community
bank, and there are a lot of people out there who still want to walk in and
see the place.  That's not saying we're going to open a branch on every
corner, but in our market, we think that's the way to go."

If the track record of the last several years is any indication, there will be
ample demand for branches in 1996.  Many of the outlets put up for sale were
the offspring of in-market mergers, where the selling bank looked to whittle
away some excess capacity once it had completed a major acquisition.  With the
completion of some very large in-market deals like Chase and Chemical Banking
Corp., Fleet Financial Group and Shawmut National Corp., First Chicago Corp.
and NBD, there should be an ample supply of branches in several markets around
the country.

In spite of the demand for some branches, that rapid flurry of consolidation
could create excess supply and cause premiums to fall.  Fifth Third's Niehaus
says he's already seen some evidence of that.

Despite the lower premiums, it seems there will still be plenty of buyers for
brick-and-mortar, no matter how out-of-date some people might consider them.
Old habits die hard-and that's as true for customers as it is for bankers.  As
Triangle's Lee says, "There are still a lot of people who want face-to-face
service."

Industry:  Does Mutuality Offer Longevity?


It's not always easy being a mutual institution, but some mutuals clearly
believe it affords them something important:  a future.

Consider what Staten Island Savings Bank, a large New York mutual, went
through last year when it set its sights on buying a small Staten Island
rival, Gateway State Bank.  The process was something like a dance, says CEO
Harry P.  Doherty-in reality, more like a lurching tango than a minuet.

When executives at the mutual first approached the New York State Banking
Department for approval to buy Gateway, a stock commercial bank, they got a
"you can't do that" reaction.  Pressed as to why not, Doherty relates,
department officials "called back a half-hour later" to say they couldn't find
anything in the statutes to stop it, but a mutual buying a stock company just
"had never been done before."

The deal did get done at 1.5 times book, adding about $300 million to the
savings bank's asset base, now $1.7 billion.  Doherty says some Gateway
stockholders were perplexed that they'd be getting cash and not stock-in fact,
a few even asked if the closing could be delayed past Jan.  1 for tax reasons.
It wasn't.

Doherty insists SISB plans to remain a mutual.  As a stock institution, "we
wouldn't last long," he says, alluding to "the life expectancy of a mayfly."
For those who aren't fisherman or entomologists, the adult mayfly usually
expires within 48 hours.  An exaggeration, perhaps, but worth noting.

Commentary/ Trust:  Preparing for The Prudent Investor Rule


The law of investment management for fiduciaries is in the midst of a major
revision.  The change is based on a revolution in financial theory which has
long been embraced by the markets, but until recently ignored by the law.

The Prudent Man Rule is gradually being replaced by a new statutory standard,
the Prudent Investor Rule.  The new rule is intended to free fiduciaries from
rigid and outdated investment practices and to allow them to use the full
array of tools available in the modern investment world for the selection and
management of an investment portfolio.

The cost of this freedom is a greater responsibility in the selection and
management of portfolios.  The fiduciary must make those selections that are
appropriate for each particular trust.  What is prudent for one trust may be
imprudent for another.  The new rule is liberating in many respects but more
demanding in others than the old rule.  The prudent fiduciary and its legal
advisers must therefore have a full understanding of the broad ramifications
of this revision.

The revision is intended to bring trust law into accordance with the practice
of the investment management industry generally, which has been shaped by four
decades of important academic research as to the optimal methods of investment
management.  These theories and insights are generally referred to as "modern
portfolio theory."  At least 11 states have enacted some version of the
Prudent Investor Rule, as shaped by the American Law Institute in its 1992
Restatement (Third) of Trusts, and the National Conference of Commissioners on
State Laws in its 1994 Uniform Prudent Investor Act (UPIA).  They are:
California, Colorado, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Oregon, Utah, Washington, New
York, Illinois and Florida.  It is expected that most other states will soon
move to this standard as well.

Modern Portfolio Theory

Two of the cornerstones of modern portfolio theory can be reduced to timeless
adages.  "Nothing ventured, nothing gained" emphasizes that the other side of
risk is reward.  The market offers bigger rewards (and penalties) for the
unknown than for predictability.  "Don't put all your eggs in one basket"
emphasizes the critical importance of diversification of investments.

Under modern portfolio theory, economists and sophisticated market
participants look at risk differently than the traditional prudent fiduciary
investor.  Risk is a recognition of the uncertainty of future values.  It is a
two-sided coin with an upside and a downside.

The theory assumes that all investors desire the highest possible level of
return while bearing the lowest amount of risk.  Economists assume a certain
baseline for risk-free investors-the return on U.S.  Government securities.
Since the Treasury rate can be had without risk, the market forces an
additional return for the assumption of risk beyond Treasury risk.  An
investor cannot beat this return unless he is willing to assume an additional
level of risk.  Risk appetites will vary according to the circumstances, but
no one gets rich investing at the risk-free Treasury rate.  While assuming
risk does not guarantee riches, it is the only means for an investor to
participate in market returns greater than the baseline.

Modern portfolio theory is concerned not with risk alone but with the
relationship between risk and reward.  Investors must inject an element of
risk into their investments in order to be successful.  Since the market
compensates investors for accepting greater risk, investors will therefore
search for those opportunities which offer the greatest reward relative to the
risk assumed.  While investors must accept the risk of a particular investment
in order to have the opportunity to gain the compensation for such risk, a
portfolio of diversified investments has less overall risk than a single
investment.  Diversification reduces the overall variability of the
performance-which is to say, risk-of an investment portfolio since investments
tend not to all react the same if selected to minimize covariance.

Covariance is the tendency of certain investments to behave the same.  A crash
of technology stocks is likely to drag down most technology stocks, just as
most technology stocks last fall benefited from a bull market.  A portfolio
composed of a mix of different investments will therefore be more diversified
than one which is concentrated in certain types of investments.  A portfolio
composed of Chrysler, General Motors and Ford will have more covariance than
one composed of Citicorp, General Electric and Coca-Cola.

The focus of modern portfolio theory, then, is on portfolio selection rather
than on individual asset selection.  Diversification is important both within
and across different types of assets.  Risk can be judged only within the
context of the whole portfolio.

The common law rule regarding investment by fiduciaries has historically been
quite restrictive.  Investment in common stocks by fiduciaries is a relatively
new development, having been viewed as per se imprudent until the 1940s.
Until that time fiduciaries were generally restricted by statute to "legal
lists" which specified permissible fixed- income investments.  The collapse of
bond values in the Depression led to the adoption of Prudent Man Rule statutes
in most states.

Interestingly, these statutes were based almost verbatim on the language of an
1830 Massachusetts case, Harvard College v.  Amory:  "In acquiring, investing,
reinvesting, exchanging, retaining, selling, and managing property for the
benefit of another, a fiduciary shall exercise the judgment and care, under
the circumstances then prevailing, which men of prudence, discretion, and
intelligence exercise in the management of their own affairs, not in regard to
speculation but in regard to the permanent disposition of their funds,
considering the probable income as well as the probable safety of their
capital."

While seemingly a timeless statement setting forth a flexible yet accountable
standard, Prudent Man Rule statutes were interpreted by the courts as actually
setting forth a Prudent Trustee standard, in the belief that a Prudent Man
would be justified in taking risks in his own investments that would be
inappropriate for a prudent fiduciary.  Caution and conservative selection of
investments became the hallmarks of the Prudent Man Rule.

The interpretations of the Prudent Man Rule statutes have no tolerance for
speculation.  The old rule emphasizes the duty to "preserve principal" at all
costs.  A loss of capital can have catastrophic consequences for a fiduciary.
A fiduciary can become a guarantor of risky investments, even if it picks many
more winners than losers.  Each investment is considered on its own merits,
without regard to the rest of the portfolio.  Broad categories of investments
are considered as imprudent per se.  A fiduciary investing in growth stocks,
start-ups, options and futures might face a surcharge action if those assets
depreciate.

Under the Prudent Man Rule, delegation of investment authority by a fiduciary
is generally forbidden.  Thus, even if a fiduciary is selected for good
relationship reasons rather than for investment expertise, the fiduciary is
personally responsible for all investment decisions, regardless of his level
of expertise-although he is free to seek advice.

The Prudent Investor Rule

As modern portfolio theory became almost universally accepted in economics and
investment management, the law lagged behind.  In acknowledgement of this
problem, the trust bar began a comprehensive review process that resulted in
the Prudent Investor Rule.  The objective was to articulate a standard which
allows various sound investment strategies, yet is flexible enough to adapt to
the inevitable changes in the markets.  It also imposes a meaningful duty of
prudence and care on fiduciaries, forcing them to take steps to serve the
interests of settlors and beneficiaries rather than relying on traditional
investment practices that had as a principal benefit a safe harbor from
liability for the fiduciary.  Interestingly, the Prudent Investor Rule is in
many ways a return to the flexible standard of the original Harvard College
rule.

The heart of the Prudent Investor Rule is a focus on the portfolio as a whole
rather than on specific investments.  The rule recognizes that the key job of
the fiduciary is to determine the tradeoff between risk and return necessary
to realize the trust objectives.  The rule abolishes categoric restrictions
and disavows the emphasis in prior law on avoiding "speculative" or "risky"
investments.  Delegation is permitted, even encouraged.

The Prudent Investor Rule is a standard of conduct.  Liability is not based on
the performance of investments if the fiduciary takes informed and thorough
actions in its investment selection.  It is process-oriented rather than
result-oriented.  In this sense it is somewhat similar to the business
judgment rule of corporate law.  A process-oriented rule puts a continuous
burden on the fiduciary, who can no longer rely on rules of thumb.  The
fiduciary must analyze each situation and make a decision which is prudent
under the circumstances.  Under the Prudent Investor Rule, there is very
little that is per se prudent or imprudent.  The rule does not, however,
abandon trust law's favor of conservative investing.  It does, however,
require a fiduciary to justify whatever investments it makes, whether in
Treasury bills or derivatives.

The major points of the Prudent Investor Rule statutes are as follows:

* The standard of prudence applies to the trust as a whole rather than
individual investments, with a realization that particular investments that
would have been seen as surchargeable speculations under old law may be
sensible, perhaps even risk-reducing additions to a portfolio viewed as a
whole.  * The overall investment strategy should be based upon risk-and-reward
objectives suitable for the trust.  These objectives will vary widely,
depending on the circumstances in each trust arrangement.  * There is a duty
to diversify unless the fiduciary reasonably determines that it is in the
interests of the beneficiaries not to diversify, taking into account the
purposes and terms of the governing instrument.  * No particular investment is
inherently prudent or imprudent.  * No special status is accorded to original
investments received by the fiduciary, and the fiduciary must review them
within a reasonable time of receipt.  * Delegation is permitted, encouraged
and in some cases required.  The Prudent Investor Rule reverses the Prudent
Man Rule's anti-delegation bias.

Impact on Trust Departments

In many respects, the new rule will not change the decision-making process of
most bank trust departments when determining investments.  Most place
significant emphasis on the diversity of assets in the trust portfolio and try
to balance growth and yield to make their investments meet the needs of all
the trust's beneficiaries.  And most understand that their care in the process
of making choices-and not the actual performance of the assets chosen-is the
basis on which they will be judged.  Furthermore, trust departments are
already familiar with provisions of the Prudent Man Rule statutes that hold
the professional trustee to a higher standard of skill than the
non-professional, a concept carried over to the Prudent Investor Rule as well.

Nevertheless, the Prudent Investor Rule, because of its emphasis on the
portfolio as a whole and on the interplay between risk and reward, is a more
dynamic standard and requires consideration of more factors in making
investment choices.  The fiduciary must determine an investment strategy for
the entire trust portfolio, and be able to justify and document both the
reasonableness of that strategy and the prudence of each investment in light
of that strategy.  The strategy, furthermore, must protect the real value, as
opposed to the historic value, of the trust principal while providing for a
suitable return for the income beneficiary.  As a result, the strategy will
necessarily change over time, depending on changes in the economy, individual
investments and the needs and resources of the trust's beneficiaries.

To ensure that the necessary work has been done to review all the relevant
considerations, trust departments will need to establish consistent procedures
to gather and record basic factual information about the family needs and
finances, not only at the trust's inception, but on an ongoing basis.  The
same applies to general analysis of the economy and performance of the
investments.  Trust instruments will have to be analyzed carefully as to their
terms because powers to invade (or the absence of such powers) and precatory
language will take on heightened meaning under the new standard.  Records
should be maintained of the considerations and decisions resulting in a
particular strategy or investment.

The burdens on a trust department resulting from increased inquiry and
record-keeping may well be offset by the opportunities for increased contact
with family members and their input into the decision-making process.

New Opportunities, New Risks

The Prudent Investor Rule permits and even encourages unsophisticated trustees
to delegate investment decisions to professionals.  As a result, asset
investment departments of banks and trust companies will likely find more call
for their services to individual fiduciaries.

Many fiduciaries also will chose to meet the requirements of diversification
and risk assumption by participating in mutual funds.  In another area, banks
in Prudent Investor Rule states are now providing specific sophisticated
services to trustees, such as risk-management derivatives or review and
oversight of family assets.

There are a great many unknown areas in the application of the Prudent
Investor Rule.  It cannot be predicted how easily the courts will move away
from the more clear-cut standards of the Prudent Man Rule when faced with
actual lawsuits, or how they will reevaluate the fiduciary's decisions years
after they were made.  Other important issues include the extent of the
trustee's duty of affirmative due diligence to inquire about family
circumstances, and the scope of liability of the investment advisor.

In addition, it is not clear how the Prudent Investor Rule interacts with
other existing laws which have not been-and may not be-modified to fit its
concerns.  For example, under-productive property rules in many states require
each asset of a trust to produce a minimum amount of income to avoid
allocation of a portion of that asset's proceeds to the trust's income
beneficiary.  This is not consistent with the total return analysis of the
Prudent Investor Rule.  Other portions of state income and principal acts may
also be troublesome.  Furthermore, the effect of the Prudent Investor Rule on
pension trusts and charitable trusts and corporations that are regulated by
specific state or federal statutes has not been fully explored.  Indeed,
fiduciaries will be acting in a realm of uncertainty for some time to come.

Pushing a Global Brand


On a dank winter day in Red Wing, MN, a woman troops out through a chilly
drizzle to her mailbox and finds, among other mail, a statement from her
credit card company, Citibank.  Included is a notice that her credit limit is
being raised, and a reminder that its purchase protection plan offers price
savings if an item she buys is being sold more cheaply later.

Halfway across the world in steamy Singapore, an export executive returns to
his sleek apartment to find a different Citibank mailing, an offer for a card
tied to a frequent flyer program for Asian travelers.

From Bangkok to Bangor, and sundry points in between, the Citibank credit card
is proving itself to be truly a worldwide brand, with a scope that's sometimes
startling.  Citi issues secured cards and even private-label cards in Brazil,
frequent flyer cards in Argentina and Taiwan.  In many countries, Citibank and
Diners Club-the travel and entertainment card of which Citi is the primary
owner-are the chief consumer card brands.  Citibank processes more than 240
million card payments and has 90 million card customer contacts a year.  Its
overseas executives don't need to brush up on Portuguese or Thai; likely as
not, they're natives.

More than any other American bank-and arguably any bank-Citibank is a name
player in an array of overseas markets.  Long-established operations in Europe
and Latin America weren't shucked off some years ago, the way they were at
several other money center banks when profitability was squeezed.  Under
chairman John S.  Reed, parent Citicorp has made servicing the global consumer
a veritable mantra-and the credit card business is perhaps the biggest weapon
in its arsenal.

It is precisely this unparalleled reach that should keep Citi at the top of
the credit card receivables heap.  Nimble, aggressive issuers like MBNA Corp.,
First USA Inc.  and Advanta Corp.  have used a precision-bombing approach on
top credit targets to build U.S.  market share dramatically, and they'll keep
gaining share-but less so at Citi's expense than other large issuers.  Even if
the New York behemoth finds its domestic lead shrinking, its plethora of
relatively untapped overseas programs-some with explosive growth
potential-should preserve its top ranking.

"We believe that Citicorp is in a unique position to build upon its
multinational credit card experience in entering new markets, dealing with
their cultural differences and developing relevant products-even where credit
bureaus or other information sources are nonexistent," wrote Salomon Brothers
analyst Diane Glossman in a report last fall.

Citi's card operations may be its crown jewel, analysts say; plastic generates
a higher percentage of the bank's earnings than any other bank issuer's cards
do, and accounted for an estimated 29% of the bank's net income in
third-quarter 1995, according to Keefe, Bruyette & Woods.  It's a jewel cut
and honed by many years of large-scale marketing, telephone account servicing
and experimentation with differing offers.  Citi was among the pioneers in the
purchase protection plan area, as well as extended warranties.  Its
Citidollars program, offering catalog items to customers as a form of rebates,
also broke new ground years ago.

In the spring of 1994, this gem was placed in the hands of Roberta J.  Arena,
a 20-year Citi veteran who had most recently headed Citi's relatively small
European card operations.  As executive vice president in charge of the North
American and European card group, Arena replaced James L.  Bailey, the bank's
longtime card honcho.  Citibank declined to make Arena available for an
interview for this story, but industry observers say her experience outside
the U.S.  is underscoring Citi's commitment to pushing its global strategy
even further.

At a time when headlines in the U.S.  are trumpeting worries about mounting
consumer credit troubles, foreign markets may offer a useful counterweight.
Historically, Citicorp's card-loss numbers have been slightly worse than
industry averages because of its targeting of what Glossman calls "a
high-risk, high-return clientele."  Citi's U.S.  loss experience, however, has
changed little; at 3.72% of managed card receivables in the third quarter, it
actually improved two basis points from the second quarter and was up just 15
basis points from third-quarter 1994.

Moreover, KBW research finds that cards represented just over half of Citi's
net chargeoffs in the third quarter-53%-compared to 74% at Bank of New York,
75% at Chemical Bank, 87% at Chase Manhattan and 99% at First Chicago.  Still,
Citi has been boosting its provision for credit losses in the global consumer
bank.  That item hit $465 million in the third quarter, up $100 million from
the year-earlier number.

Credit the bank with seeing the trendlines.  "As the largest credit card
issuer in the country, we think it will be impossible for Citicorp to avoid
concerns about credit cards' credit quality," noted PaineWebber's Lawrence
Cohn in a recent report.

Citi's card prominence dates to the virtual dawn of the bank card in the early
1970s, and at this juncture its card is a very mature product in this country.
There's a bit of consumer ennui about the brand, perhaps, which will be a
challenge for Arena and her marketing forces.  So, too, will be catering to
the more service-savvy customer and finding the proper alchemy of rates and
rewards to keep profitability high amid fierce competitive pressures.

The legacy of leadership is certainly there.  "They reached a milestone in the
late 1970s when they realized that the card was the beachhead of least
resistance," says a consultant who worked for the bank years ago.  "They gave
up trying to be a national bank.

"Very early on, they decided the card business should be done on a volume
basis," he adds, and began multimillion-piece mailings.  "Even though Citi was
realizing significantly higher loan losses than the industry norms, by going
after active credit users, where the profits are, they were making more
because those people aren't as sensitive to rates and fees.  (Citi) accepted
credit losses as a cost of goods sold.  They also realized that they had a
great list, and they crammed everything they could sell down that pipeline."

Reputation as a Bully

"Cram" implies an element of bullying-and Citicorp still occasionally gets
demonized by consumer groups and smaller banks as the apotheosis of impersonal
service and a Marie Antoinette-in-pinstripes, "let-them-eat-cake" response to
criticism.  Some of that reflects a kind of Jeffersonian revulsion to bigness,
but Citi earned a lot of enmity in thev '70s and '80s, when it seemed eager to
bulldoze any regulation or law in its path.

But a seemingly chastened Citi-burned by waves of LDC, leveraged buyout and
commercial real estate losses in the late '80s and early '90s-is keeping a
lower profile these days.  It's no longer the merger scourge that smaller
banks once saw in their nightmares; institutions like NationsBank Corp.  and
First Union Corp.  have taken over that mantle.  As Citi has turned right
full-rudder into consumer banking, it's often been reducing fees (especially
for electronic services), not just jacking them up.

If Citi's consumer banking business isn't hitting on all cylinders, it's
close:  It generated over $500 million in global earnings in the third
quarter, a new high-water mark and 60% of the company's net income.  That's
broad-based, but the credit card is the biggest arrow in the quiver.  Citi
reported 56 million cards in circulation at the end of the third quarter, up
9% from the year earlier, with managed receivables up 19%.  Growth was
especially strong in the Asia-Pacific region, where managed receivables surged
40%, year-to-year, and applications hit a record level.  Since 1990, worldwide
cards in force have swelled more than 50%.

It's a big business, Citicorp's largest, and it requires hordes of
people-6,400 alone in three service centers in South Dakota, Maryland and
Nevada (Citi has offered 24-hour, 7-day phone service for almost a decade).
Throw in the operations in 31 other countries, and 14,300 employees are
involved-more bodies than the entire workforce at most large regional banks.

It's hard to downplay scale and experience in a business like credit cards.
In a recent survey of senior bank executives and directors by Towers Perrin,
Citibank was named most often as the best product manufacturer and distributor
in banking-attributes at the heart of card programs.  "The fact that Citi has
played at this level year in and year out is a remarkable thing," says Angelo
Palombi, senior executive vice president at Resource Bancshares Corp., a
Columbia, SC, firm that helps smaller banks run card operations.

For many years, Citi has been using scoring and portfolio modeling, then
blanketing the country with mail pieces, often with pre-approved applications
based on statistics and credit report data.  True, Citi doesn't know the
customer in Oshkosh as well as the local bank, and never will.  But the credit
card business is a scale-enhanced one in which it's increasingly impractical
to lend just locally.  Think Advanta and MBNA aren't using sophisticated
credit scoring techniques?  Think again.  Citi is using its technological
prowess to segment its marketing efforts and boost responsiveness, as well as
build average card balances.

With $42.1 billion in receivables at the end of 1995's third quarter, Citi's
program was half again as large as second-place Discover's $28.2 billion,
according to RAM Research.  MBNA, First USA and First Chicago rounded out the
top five (see table on this page).  Citi held 23.4% of total receivables for
the 10 largest issuers.

Several money-center analysts put its return on assets on its U.S.  card
business around 2.5%.  KBW's Berry says the business "continues to generate
superior returns," though Salomon Brothers' Glossman predicts returns will
trend down toward 2.0% over time.  That 2.5% ROA is double what aggressive
"pure-play" issuers Capital One Financial Corp.  (1.20%) and Advanta (about
1.30% on receivables made up 80% of credit cards) reported in the third
quarter.  Revenues would be even more impressive if Citi could develop better
cross-sell numbers; only 6% of the card base has another Citibank
relationship, and only half of branch customers have a Citi card, says
Glossman.

Profitability has received renewed attention, and that seems to be paying off.
"Historically, they were more aggressive and more sophisticated than any other
issuers," says K.  Shelly Porges, president of Porges/Hudson Marketing in San
Francisco.  But "they did not focus exclusively on revolving customers (those
who carry balances)-that would have made them more profitable.  They were out
there to gain total share."

Citi clearly isn't as dominant as it was a few years ago.  Its share of U.S.
credit card receivables slipped from 18% in 1991 to 13.5% at the end of 1994,
according to Credit Card Management, a Faulkner & Gray publication.  RAM
numbers put its Sept.  30, 1995 share even lower, at 12.8%.

Yet it's hard to underplay the importance of cards in Citi's earnings stream.
The bank reported 24.8 million bank card accounts in September 1995, and card
loans made up 23% of Citi's bankwide loans, up from 21% a year earlier; only
First Chicago (41%) had a higher percentage among major bank issuers.

Visa and MasterCard cards make up the vast majority of those accounts, but
Citi has issued some seven million Diners Club cards, and also issues and
services millions of private-label cards for department stores.  In the 1950s,
Diners was the travel and entertainment card for U.S.  corporations.  That's a
distinction it has lost-American Express is now six times as large, worldwide.
But Diners recorded its fourth straight record sales year in 1994, with
worldwide revenues of $22 billion in more than 175 countries.

Citi's ownership of the 45-year-old Diners brand is complex-Citi may have
control in various countries or share it with local franchisees.  It owns the
franchise in Germany, for instance, but In Chile has only a 20% share.  Diners
claims relationships with more than half of the Fortune 500 corporations, but
skeptics say it lives more on its past reputation than anything, and has more
clout in Europe in Asia than in the U.S.  "They haven't exploited Diners to
the point they can," says Michael Auriemma, president of Auriemma Consulting
in Westbury, NY.  "The energy and the effort seem to be missing."

But Porges points out that Citi has been developing new marketing for Diners-a
clear sign that it is committed to the program.  New commercials feature
younger, hipper travelers and an updated focus on women, she says.  In a
recent full-page ad in major newspapers, Diners takes on American Express,
calling Diners' "membership miles" program superior because it includes "every
major U.S.  airline"-including two Amex leaves out.

Big Switch

Analysts attribute Citi's relative passivity on the marketing front in 1991-93
to its internal problems, many related to real estate loan losses.  That was
also a period when Citi's card chargeoffs peaked, climbing to over 6% in
1991-92, according to KBW.  Yet card profits, as well as those from other
consumer businesses, helped pull the bank from the ditch it had landed in five
years ago.

The 1992 switch to variable rates and the year-end 1993 decision to eliminate
annual fees for Citibank Classic and Preferred Visa and MasterCard customers
with good credit histories sacrificed what some analysts estimated was
hundreds of millions of dollars in revenues.  But it clearly gave Citi's card
program a shot in the arm.  "Repricing is restoring our momentum," Arena
announced in 1994.  In an interview last year with Brandweek magazine, she
said, "We invested more than we had planned in sheer marketing last year
(1994)...  so I think it's fair to say that we are back."

In its latest annual report, Citi said the steps were taken "to reinforce its
market dominance by building customer loyalty in this highly competitive
market."  Adding customers was a key objective.  Early in 1995, for instance,
the bank was offering new customers an introductory fixed rate of 6.9% for 12
months, considerably longer than most rivals.

Frank DeSantis, money-center analyst with Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, adds
that Citi has identified active customers who have $50 billion in balances on
other issuers' cards-and is targeting these accounts with balance-transfer
solicitations.  Its goal, he says, "is to regain half its lost market share
over the next five years."  Earlier last year, DeSantis singled out Citi's
usage levels, citing the figure of 79% of all accounts active (vs.  66%
industrywide) and higher-than-average balances per active account, $2,150 vs.
the $1,750 industry average.  Moreover, he says that the company's credit card
expense control "borders on spectacular"-recently, it was operating at a 34%
efficiency ratio in the U.S.

Citi has been "coming to terms with things that were part of its heritage,"
says Porges.  Citidollars, for instance, which was discontinued a year and a
half ago.  When it was introduced in the early '80s, Citidollars "had a lot of
power," she says.  "But in an age of co-branded cards, Citidollars had little
if any appeal."

The U.S.  portfolio has been highly segmented, offering consumers an array of
choices:  Classic (security and value); Preferred (higher credit line);
Choice, for price-sensitive buyers; and co-branded programs with such major
partners as American Airlines, Ford Motor Co.  and Apple Computer.  Another
successful selling strategy is the Photocard, in which the cardholder's photo
is digitally imprinted on the face of the card-a genuine security advantage
that Citi says cut its U.S.  bank card fraud losses by 62% in 1993-94.
Introduced in the U.S.  in 1992, it has been rolled out in all European,
Asia-Pacific and Latin American markets.

But the bank has hit a few pockets of major turbulence, too.  Its co-branded
card with MCI Communications was killed last year when consumers just didn't
line up.  And the Ford card, announced with a flourish three years ago, is
rumored in the industry to have collected most of its accounts from elsewhere
in Citi's empire, not from new customers.

Some attribute those difficulties to a focus on Citi's own brand, giving
co-branding programs-in which the bank shares proceeds with a nonbank-a lower
priority.  "The focus on the brand is an excellent strategy, but I think for
something that large they should have a two-pronged approach," says Auriemma.
"They're not focusing on some of the non-branded programs that might have
tremendous potential."

Great Expectations

Where issuers like MBNA and Household Bank have had tremendous success with
co-branded programs, the only one that has really clicked at Citi is the
American Airlines frequent flyer, or AAdvantage, experts say.  It's done so
well that it's been exported throughout Latin America.  But the other
programs?

"The Apple program ought to be huge, but I don't know one person that carries
(that card)," Auriemma says.  Similarly, he says never got an MCI card
solicitation, even though he was an MCI customer; he believes that's because
Citi is concentrating on its branded cards in the greater New York market.
Says Porges:  "When we talk about success in co-branding, the expectation is
that (Citi) would have something as big or bigger than anyone else's.  By that
standard, they weren't successful."  She quickly adds that this doesn't mean
the programs are failures, however.

On the flip side, Citi's own brand recognition is a huge asset-and coupled
with the bank's far-flung presence, it offers breathtaking potential.  Citi
issues bank cards in Belgium, Germany, Greece and Spain-and believes a
co-branded arrangement with the German national railway could catapult it to
first place there.  Plans are to consolidate the 15 card processing and
customer service facilities in North America and Europe into a small core of
centralized operations, trimming costs.

Asia, where Citi has a stronger presence than any other American bank, is its
most turbocharged card market.  Four million cards are in force there, and
Citi recently partnered with Passages, Asia's biggest frequent-flyer program,
in seven countries.  Arena has said that the credit card "is the biggest
introductory agent we have for the (Citibank) brand."

Even Eastern Europe, where capital infrastructures are still being built from
the rubble of Communism, holds card potential-though it may be a ways off.
Citi is in such countries as the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Russia.
Salomon Brothers' Glossman noted in a recent report that Citi's Eastern
European operations "have been profitable from day one...  These economies
tend to be almost completely cash-dependent, and Citicorp is well-positioned
should development skip checks and move straight to credit/debit/stored value
cards."

Some observers wonder just how quickly these emerging markets can deliver,
however.  "It is important to develop them, but those markets are so small and
so immature that to spend a significant portion of management time on them is
dangerous, I think," Auriemma says.  "You certainly wouldn't want to do it to
the detriment of the U.S.  market."

Even in many highly developed areas in western Europe, there's plenty of
opportunity.  A New York banker with close ties to a large Dutch bank says
that many bankers there don't understand the popularity of credit cards in
this country; there, they've focused far more on debit cards-leaving an
autobahn-like opening for a high-volume card issuer like Citi.

In a number of overseas markets, Citi doesn't have to import its U.S.  card
logic, notes John Laurino, managing director at Westport Consulting in
Westport, CT.  "It has built retail businesses from the ground up, and they
are as well-established as they are in the States."  In fact, some of its
products in this country "were explored and validated overseas and brought
back here."  Citi calls that process "success transfer."

Success isn't necessarily measured in terms of customer satisfaction, however.
Citi tied for fifth in a recent U.S.  card satisfaction survey by J.D.  Power
& Co., long noted for its automotive surveys.  Power measured such attributes
as billing payment quality, interest rates, rewards and fees, cash advance
limits and point-of-sale processing quality.  Citi's score of 101-100 was
deemed average-tied it with Banc One.  Only one multiline bank scored higher,
Bank of New York at 102.  AT&T Universal Card led the pack, followed by
Discover and Household Bank.

In a RAM rating of the "best" consumer cards, Citi doesn't score in the top
group in any category except "best secured cards," where it was third behind
Wachovia Corp.  and Chase Manhattan.  But its move to eliminate annual fees
helps boost consumer satisfaction-though Citi, like most fee-charging issuers,
was dragged into those waters by a horde of no-fee rivals who were clearly
making big inroads.

Service Questions

Service quality issues remain, some customers say.  One customer with a
Citigold account-a packaged account that requires an opening minimum of
$100,000 and brings with it such goodies as a personal account officer, funds
sweep and trading privileges-complains that he's had difficulty with the bank
acknowledging separate accounts.  When he ran over his limit on a plain
vanilla card, he says, the card service people apparently never realized he
was a Citigold customer.  "From a customer perspective, (the card business)
seems to be managed autonomously from the retail bank," he says.  That
experience highlights the difficulty of managing information over massive
networks, but for an institution with Citi's technological prowess, it's
disconcerting nonetheless.

Technology does appear to be paying dividends, however, in keeping
delinquencies and losses in line.  As consumer loan delinquencies have shot up
in recent months, Citi's numbers have held up well.  Moreover, Lehman Brothers
analyst James Rosenberg maintains that even if Citi's U.S.  consumer
chargeoffs (including cards) jumped 100 basis points, that would extract at
most a 10% toll on earnings.  Similarly, KBW's Berry notes that Citi's $1.8
billion in consumer loan-loss reserves (most allocated for card losses)
represented 17 months of recent losses-far more than the seven months'
reserves that specialty card banks usually carry.

But it's incontrovertible:  cards are riskier than, say, home equity loans.
Citi's overall loss rate of 2.02% for all managed consumer loans at the
third-quarter close compares to 3.78% for worldwide credit card loans.

Risk management is a tough nut for issuers, and so is consumer loyalty at a
time of intense competition on the issuer's version of the Three R's:  rates,
rebates and rewards.  It's estimated that a record three billion credit card
offers were mailed out in 1995 alone.  "In the last 10 years, customer loyalty
to credit cards (in the U.S.)  has been destroyed, as holders were saturated
with offers," says Robert Skolnick, executive vice president at Behavioral
Analysis Inc.  in Tarrytown, NY.  "Issuers have turned credit cards into a
commodity in consumers' minds, and now they are launching major efforts to
develop long-term relationships, which historically had been presumed."

That's every major issuers' story; it is Citi's, too.  Growth potential in
this country is circumscribed by such commoditization, but it isn't strangled,
especially if current cardholders can be coaxed to build their balances.
Berry thinks Citi's card program can maintain its domestic share even as
overall credit card receivables mount at a 14%-16% annual clip through the
rest of the decade.  Roping in a new group-maybe even a new generation-of
customers is a key cog in that effort.

Arena told Brandweek that the student market is one of Citi's four major
marketing thrusts, the others being high-end spenders, "new Americans" and
"the great magic middle," which she said "is best characterized as being
married, or something, with children."  That great middle, she added, is where
Citi is "focusing our marketing weight."

In developing markets, far from the U.S.' saturated shores, growth could be
comparatively luxuriant.  "Adding new countries, improving penetration in
existing countries and increased usage of credit cards as a payment vehicle in
the locations are all sources of growth," wrote Glossman recently.  "Citicorp
already has enviable positioning in many of these markets with a known brand
name and the ability to draw upon its U.S.  and international skill base."
For instance, Citi recently introduced its American AAdvantage card in four
new markets-Argentina, Chile, Colombia and Panama.

Obviously, the developing world offers risk with a capital "R."  But Glossman,
who has exhaustively analyzed the bank's card operations, offers an
instructive example of Citi's experience in Colombia.  While savings banks
there have seen delinquency rates shoot as high as 25%, Citi's recently stood
at 4.4%.  Citi "has the advantage of centralized scoring, collections and more
targeted marketing," she noted.  One result:  Citi grew its credit card book
in Colombia by 116% in the first half of 1995, she says.

No Alarm Bells

Domestically, Citi can expect to see a modest uptick in delinquencies if
current trends hold-but nothing alarming.  Card executives at other banks
don't profess serious concern.  "Our forecasted losses are within our
expectations," says John A.  Klein, executive vice president for consumer
banking at People's Bank in Bridgeport, CT, which has a national low-rate
portfolio.  "They continue to track in a way we would expect with the
vintaging of our account base."

Another executive with a regional issuer attributes today's delinquency rise
more to the economic cycle than to a lack of portfolio "seasoning" over time.
"We're seeing people claiming bankruptcy who are not even past due.  That debt
is not showing up at the credit bureaus."  Still, he says that "most
successful players don't stop issuing in these markets, and the big guys like
Citicorp know that."

What's driving the most successful operations in this era of card saturation
is the ability to assemble information electronically and use it to maintain
the most profitable customer relationships, says James Quella, head of the
financial services practice at Mercer Management Consulting.  Citi continues
to reinvest heavily in the card business, adding client-server and voice
response technologies, and Glossman insists its current cost-per-account level
is what it was in 1982.  In a 1993 study by Booz, Allen & Hamilton, Citi's
cost advantage in the back office over other major card players ranged from
10% to 60%.

An executive with a regional card issuer says he heard that a few years ago,
Citi explored a mutual opening of back offices with First Data Corp.  Such
overtures, in which companies check out each other's technology, don't always
lead to ventures, and he says "Citi is notorious for stealing ideas."  After
that process, he says, "Citi felt it had perhaps the best cost structure" in
the business.  Being a low-cost producer has conferred tremendous advantages
by freeing up resources for new marketing and technology initiatives.

While Citi hasn't been duking it out in the courts far and wide as it was in
the 1970s and 1980s, it isn't loath to fight to protect its interests.  The
bank recently challenged a New Jersey law limiting late fees to $10 per card
account each month; Citi charges its customers $15.  The New Jersey Supreme
Court upheld the state limit in late November, and Citi immediately vowed to
appeal.

It's clear that Citi doesn't have the pre-eminent role it once did in the card
business; too many other talented players have come in.  But Citi is no Norma
Desmond, either, living only on past glories.  Freed from its earlier asset
woes and focused on the global consumer, it is in the process of erecting a
worldwide brand it hopes will rival Coca-Cola or Hewlett-Packard.

When that exporter in Singapore weighs his options for a card, that name
recognition and the image of Citi's four-pointed star will be no small
consideration.  So, too, will it weigh considerably with a manufacturing
executive in Germany.  Citi expects to grow its European card business to five
million accounts by 2000, from one million now, adding a new country every
12-15 months.  Since Arena's elevation, "They're taking a more global view of
the business," says Porges.  "Even though they talked global, the focus was on
the U.S.  My sense is there's a truer commitment now to non-U.S.  expansion."

That will require plenty of bodies and minds, and rivals won't be sitting
still.  But analysts see only encouraging signs.  You can't say the Citi never
slips, but it's spinning its wheels a lot less these days.  Pumped up by
global branding, its credit card business is like a battleship:  It may not be
nimble, but it has loads of firepower and a very long reach.

U.S. BANKER via NewsNet
JANUARY, 1996

Final Say:  CEOs Key to Sales Process


Banking's best CEOs and business unit managers have a passion for selling and
a well-defined process for managing sales.  They treat great selling as one of
their few sustainable strategic advantages.

At one of the nation's best-performing large banking groups, the president
makes over 300 sales calls a year and meets regularly with field sales
managers.  At another high-performing bank, the senior retail banking
executive personally coaches every one of his 120 retail salespeople in
selling for an hour each quarter as a model for his managers to follow.

Most bank CEOs are comfortable with selling, or they wouldn't have achieved so
much career success.  But often they're uncomfortable with the time required
to manage sales or with the functional skills of sales leadership, such as
sales planning and coaching.  As a result, they're often persuaded to champion
easy, non-integrated solutions to sales problems, such as single-event
programs that require little interdepartmental cooperation.  That's why most
bank sales programs aren't working.

Examples of traditional bank sales practices that don't work include the
industry's popular cross-sell measures, product sales incentives and officer
call programs.  These typically focus managers on activity rather than on
effectiveness.  Similarly, the structure and detail of activity-driven sales
training and mystery shopper programs make CEOs feel that a lot is being done
to increase sales and customer satisfaction, despite any hard evidence.

These "quick fixes" have actually encouraged formulaic selling and
product-pushing and have relieved managers of their sense of accountability.
None of those "easy" sales interventions by themselves can provide the focus,
motivation and accountability that's provided by a fully integrated sales
process.  Most line sales managers in banking know these traditional sales
programs aren't working, but few will say so aloud because so much money and
senior management prestige is invested in them.

Sales effectiveness begins at the top of the organization chart.  Research at
Harvard Business School has established that having a clear sales task is the
most important factor in sales motivation, coupled with feedback and
accountability.  If this is true, only the CEO and other senior executives can
influence large gains in sales production.

If a CEO doesn't communicate a clear vision of success and clear role
definitions for selling or doesn't hold line managers accountable for sales
revenue and developing salespeople through coaching, this lack of clarity
filters down through the bank.  Employees lose their motivation, and average
sales revenue per employee falls.  Repeated surveys of bank salespeople have
demonstrated that bank employees don't know what they're supposed to do
relative to sales and customer satisfaction.  They also say they're receiving
virtually no coaching, no feedback and no meaningful consequences for
performance, good or bad.

For a bank to make a quantum leap in sales, its employees must believe that
senior managers are placing a consistent focus and priority on sales and
customer satisfaction.

A Simple Answer

With so many banks failing at sales, what are the CEOs of successful
organizations doing to produce outstanding results?  The answer is
surprisingly simple:  Banking's best CEOs treat sales as a primary business
function, giving it the same commitment and attention to detail that they give
to pricing and expense control.

Banking's best sales organizations show a sense of urgency and accountability
for sales production and customer satisfaction that isn't present at other
banks.  This is driven by the CEO's uncompromising insistence that sales
revenue contributions and customer satisfaction be considered as key factors
in decisions affecting all functional areas of the bank.

This means that improvement in sales revenue and customer satisfaction are
measured and rewarded; that sales and customer satisfaction are key agenda
items for senior level management meetings; and that the CEO and business unit
managers are visible in articulating clear goals, strategies and preferred
ways of selling, and in serving as models of personal selling and sales
coaching.  None of this is rocket science, but it is increasingly clear that
active sales leadership by the CEO pays dividends and helps improve prospects
for long-term survival.

Funding:  Those Dwindling Deposits


Like a pond drawn down by drought, the nation's depository institutions are
finding their deposit bases shrinking as consumers take their savings money
elsewhere.  To some observers, this phenomenon has gone beyond a cyclical
event dictated by rate movements-and has profound repercussions on the future
of bank funding.

"The (core) deposits are not going to come back," says Michael Brosnan,
director of the Treasury and market risk division at the Office of the
Comptroller of the Currency (OCC).  "In my opinion, this is not a short-term
phenomenon; this is a secular change in the system.  The question is, are you
planning this out, or is it just happening to you?"

A recent study of this phenomenon by Charles N.  Cranmer, director of equity
research at New York broker/dealer M.A.  Shapiro & Co.  Inc., establishes
clearly that at best, core deposits at the nation's banks are stagnant, while
the low-cost deposit categories are experiencing significant run-offs as
depositors search for higher yields.  Illiquid assets as a percent of core
liabilities, the standard for liquidity in Cranmer's study, have jumped from
84% in year-end 1993 to 95% in the second quarter of 1995.

And according to data from the OCC, deposits of all sorts have declined in the
past three years, and are flat to significantly lower compared with 1990 (see
charts).  Most dramatically, all time deposits in the nation's commercial
banks fell from 31.74% of total assets in mid-1990 to 22.37% in mid-1995.  In
the same period, small time deposits fell from 20.07% to 16.43% of total
assets, while large time deposits fell from 11.67% to 5.94%.

Experts say that consumer flight to higher yields isn't the only cause.  Many
banks are rationalizing their branch systems and finding that core deposits
gathered through them aren't always the cheapest way to go.

"I think what's happened is that as banks have acquired robust information
systems, they've come to appreciate the fully-loaded costs of acquiring
certain deposits and have become less enamored of them, because it may
actually be expensive money," says Chris Formant, a Boston-based national
partner in the financial services group of Coopers & Lybrand Consulting.

But this phenomenon naturally sends the nation's banks into the capital
markets for money to lend, raising the cost of funds-and squeezing margins.
And while the industry as a whole is awash in capital today, says Cranmer, it
doesn't mean the subject is so boring that bankers can safely look the other
way.  Analysts certainly aren't.  In a recent report on First Bank System,
Citicorp fixed-rate analyst Blaine Frantz wrote that "available balance sheet
liquidity to fund loan growth is the most noteworthy constraint on the bank's
credit profile."

"If American bankers continue ignoring this (liquidity issue), one day they'll
get caught with their pants down," Cranmer says.  "People don't talk much
about liquidity, but these days, the Japanese banks have to pay 100 basis
points over the yield curve for funds, and I'm sure they wish they didn't have
to do that."

Japanese banks, which don't have as well-developed an asset securitization
market as U.S.  banks, have reportedly endured significant outflows of foreign
deposits in recent months as news of their deep-seated problems has surfaced.
These outflows have forced them into the arms of professional-and
skeptical-financiers.

A similar fate, say experts, awaits complacent U.S.  bankers who think they
can safely ignore balance sheet basics, and concentrate on the glamorous side
of the business, because they imagine that the bad old days of write-downs and
microscopic bank examinations are over.  This is exactly what will cause the
next liquidity crunch if banks don't pay more attention, says Roy Smith,
professor of finance at New York University's Stern School of Business.

"The real problem (today) isn't on the liquidity side-banks are
over-capitalized today," he says.  "The problem is, what are banks doing with
their capital?  And they're doing two things; buying other banks and paying
high prices, or squandering it on some of the syndicated loans they're
making."

"They just want to look good in the locker room," he continues.  "If they're
willing to take 11 basis points from a British conglomerate, they're surely
not covering the risks of that loan being degraded; that's a lower spread over
LIBOR than they got for some of the loans that went bad in the 1980s," he
says, citing a recently syndicated loan.

To a great extent, what is replacing the core deposits as an important source
of liquidity at the nation's depository institutions is no mystery.  Most
larger banks today are deeply into securitization and outright asset sales,
and are familiar figures at the Fed funds window and in the nation's money
markets.

As a result, most experts feel that while keeping an eye on liquidity is at
the very least well-advised, they also say that focussing on illiquid assets
as a percent of core assets as a liquidity measurement as closely as Cranmer
does in his study is too narrow.  "When I look at liquidity, I can't look at a
single ratio," says the OCC's Brosnan.  "I look at (borrowing) capacity, as
well as asset quality issues, management issues, and the stability of
earnings.  To the extent that these things, and capital, are solid, we're
happy."

There are important cost, regulatory and accounting issues, often unremarked,
that are driving the turning of U.S.  banks to securitization and asset sales
as a source of liquidity.  The cost of operating a branch system to gather
deposits, for instance, is a largely hidden, but real cost.  Also, says the
OCC's Brosnan, securitization improves a bank's capital position.  "You get to
fund off-balance sheet, and get a continually growing earnings stream without
raising capital by a proportional amount."

Auto loans, for instance, must be reserved against at an 8% rate, while
securitizing such a loan requires no reserves and releases that 8% to the bank
to re-lend, explains Brosnan.  But since earnings from securitizations and
asset sales flow to non-interest income on a company's annual report, it's
difficult to measure directly the impact of that activity on the bank's
liquidity position.

Cranmer doesn't disagree with this analysis.  "Securitization is a pretty
powerful force on the consumer side of the market, and a clear alternative" to
core deposits, he says.  "To the extent you're creating internally generated
funds, that's liquidity.  But while a company that's leveraged one-to-one or
even two-to-one can fund most of its needs internally, a company that's
leveraged 20-to-one never can."

The growth of these sophisticated financings have allowed bankers to likewise
become much more sophisticated in their use of the capital markets,
derivatives and risk management, which is leading them away from a reliance on
core deposits as a primary source of liquidity, says Cooper & Lybrand's
Formant.  And as a result, core deposit levels don't really reflect a bank's
true liquidity.

Approaching Obsolescence

"I think it's becoming an obsolete measurement," he says.  "Not completely
obsolete; but the stated composition of a bank's superficial liquidity and
matching funds may not be what it really is, if you look at some of the
off-balance sheet financings, and some of the derivatives, which may change
the composition of that liquidity."

The issue, then, isn't whether banks have money to lend, but how they get it.
"The real measure of liquidity is, what's the quality of the bank, and how are
people looking at it?"  says the OCC's Brosnan.

There's the rub; market perception.  When a bank turns from core deposits to
the money markets for much of their liquidity, everything depends on how it's
viewed on the trading floor.  And while securitization, and professional
markets, are perfectly reasonable venues for liquidity when properly managed,
they can also turn on borrowers like tigers, in a sort of extremely grown-up
version of high school popularity.

For a domestic example of how fast a good thing can go bad, look no further
than Continental Illinois Corp., say observers.  Once one of the nation's
premier banks, Continental Illinois was prevented under Illinois regulations
from having a branch system, and therefore direct access to stable core
deposits.  The result was that it had to fund itself in the money markets
every day, to the tune of billions of dollars.

Of course, other Chicago banks had to do the same, and prospered.  But in
1984, a connected series of events led to its being solvent on a Friday and
broke next Monday.  Headlines and a federal reorganization inevitably
followed.

Nightmares like that can be useful in keeping bankers from a terminal case of
complacency, but they're also easy to ignore, especially as the tides of
financial fashion sweep from coast to coast.  That, says Cranmer, is why now
is a good time to buttress a bank's balance sheet.

"There's always a credit cycle, and when times are good, you want to build
your balance sheet in anticipation of the next down cycle," he says.  He
advises bank to stop relying so much on overnight Fed funds and to stagger
maturities, so that a bank isn't caught one day carrying both a big market
basket and a low credit rating.

Sounds like common sense.  But are banks doing this?  Not really, says
Cranmer.  "The whole criticism I have of the industry overall, is that they're
tending to short-fund themselves.  It does cost more money to issue five-year
bank notes than to borrow overnight Fed funds, but the difference is only 50
basis points."

"This is something banks haven't really had to face up to, because they could
always fund with their core deposits," Cranmer adds.  "But they want to
accommodate their long-term customers and they want to go to the closing
dinners and they want to sit at the lead table.  There are all sorts of
motivations; it just doesn't seem to me that a lot of the syndicated loans
banks are making these days are real economical."

If this has a certain unhappily familiar ring to it, NYU's Professor Smith is
unsurprised-and unmoved.

"The premium in banking, as always, goes to those who know what they're doing,
and understand the problems they face, and don't squander their funds on
badly-priced loans just to gain some sort of ephemeral leadership in a market
that may not matter to them," he says.  "What they ought to be doing is
asking, 'How are we going to compete in the retail market with the mutual
funds, and how are we going to compete in the wholesale markets with the
investment banks?'"

Good questions, of course, and critical for the big picture.  But lending and
spread management are the bread-and-butter of banking.  Unless the entire
notion of banking is revolutionized, banks need to be occupied with funding
issues.  Core deposits may not have the starring role they once did, but it's
hard to imagine them fading into the background any time soon.

Industry:  Taking It To The Courts


Amid the hoopla over the proposed merger of Chemical Banking Corp.  and Chase
Manhattan Corp., there's an alarm sounded by several recent merger challenges
that threatens only to get louder.  Community activists are no longer willing
to simply lick their wounds when the deals get approved and their wishes go
unmet.  Now, they're suing to try to get the deals overturned.

The hotbed of this activity has been New York; it's been spearheaded by Inner
City Press/Community on the Move, a Bronx-based community group whose
executive director, Matthew Lee, has challenged a series of bank mergers in
the past few years.  Lee and his group went to court recently to fight both
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.'s approval of GreenPoint Bank's
acquisition of 60 Home Savings Bank branches and Chase's acquisition of mutual
fund advisory businesses from U.S.  Trust Corp.

In the former, a federal court actually issued a stay of the FDIC
approval-then concluded that no relief was warranted, largely because
GreenPoint had already made moot Inner City's chief complaint by establishing
a presence in the Bronx.  Inner City sued to block the Chase-U.S.  Trust
merger on the grounds that Chase has discriminated in its mortgage lending.
The court let the deal go forward, but agreed to review the administrative
record.

As the courts ruminate, the process for evaluating Chase-Chemical is going
through predictable paces.  The Federal Reserve Board and the New York State
Banking Department (the new Chase, as the banks call their merged entity, has
opted for a state charter) held a highly structured, two-day hearing in
mid-November at which some 150 people testified.

Anxious to cover all bases, the Fed extended the comment period by 11
days-then tacked on another three days.  The state banking department alone
received thousands of pages of testimony.  Much of what they heard and read
was utterly predictable, with executives from Chase and Chemical defending
their community service record and many activists challenging it.  A number of
legislators got into the act, with Republicans generally lauding the merger
and liberal Democrats from New York City raising objections.  In fact, a
consortium of Democrats later banded together to urge regulators to strike
down the deal.

Lee, who seems to chase Chase like Ahab pursued Moby Dick-Inner City has taken
the bank on in every merger and chartering issue in the past couple of
years-urged the regulators to deny the deal on fair lending grounds.  Chase,
he argued, "is the most exclusionary banking organization in New York."

What appears to be behind the legal truculence is activists' sense that
regulators remain loath to intervene in merger applications beyond a polite
throat-clearing and sotto voce advice to the banks to put up a bit more cash.
In a recent article in The New York Times, Ralph Nader wrote that
Chase/Chemical's pledge to boost lending in underserved areas "is
unenforceable, but it does provide cover for regulators eager to rubber-stamp
the mergers."

Nader urged a rewriting of the Bank Merger Act "by placing greater emphasis on
determining the 'public interest' in these mergers."  He added that the
Justice Department should adopt tougher standards for measuring bank
competition than those prevalent in the Reagan-Bush era.

Nader isn't likely to get his wish any time soon.  But massive mergers like
Chase-Chemical throw a spotlight on job losses and other byproducts of
consolidation that are impossible to ignore-and bring political considerations
into the equation (see Point of View, November 1995).  Add to that the new
level of legal scrutiny sought by Lee and his allies, and regulators may well
be pushed to put big mergers through a finer screening.

Lee's stated goal, an outright denial, is almost unthinkable.  Chemical has a
legacy of "outstanding" Community Reinvestment Act ratings, and the two banks
announced a five-year, $18-billion pledge for community reinvestment (though
much of it is nationwide, and targeted not at urban reinvestment but at
"affordable mortgages").

In an interview, Lee snorts that "it's the least well-defined of any of the
(bank) mega-pledges...  If they'd made a $2-billion pledge with a specific
commitment, it would have been much better."

Lee hints that if the Fed okays the merger-a decision could come as early as
late this month-his group may head back to court.  That depends in part, he
says, on how Inner City fares with its two ongoing suits.  If the only way to
get CRA enforcement is through denying an application, that's the logical
route to pursue, he adds.

"I expect the courts to slap him down, but one never knows," says Warren
Traiger, a New York attorney specializing in community reinvestment issues.
"The standard for overturning any administrative decision, of being arbitrary
and capricious, is a pretty high hurdle."

Traiger predicts that New York regulators will work "in tandem" with the Fed
on Chase/Chemical:  "I can't imagine a divergence."  The pitch and the volume
of the criticism isn't unexpected, given that the merger will create the
nation's largest bank, and the regulators can't tune it out.  Don't be
surprised if the new Chase winds up making loan commitments for a few billion
dollars more before the deal is sealed and delivered.

Mortgages:  Servicing Rights:  Still In Demand


In the third quarter of 1995, the transfer of servicing rights to loans
purchased by the nation's Congressionally chartered secondary marketing
agencies fell by 7%.

This barometer of activity in the lucrative field of mortgage servicing may be
an indication to some that the market for home servicing rights is leveling
off.  After all, in the past banks and large mortgage bankers have been
willing to pay up to seven times a loan's servicing fee for the right to
acquire servicing in the open market.  Lately, prices have fallen back to less
stratospheric levels.

Does that mean the golden days of mortgage banking are over?  Don't bet on it.

Although there has been somewhat of a lull in activity in recent months,
investment bankers and advisors that buy and sell servicing for their clients
cite a number of different reasons for the slowdown.

Some believe that buyers are waiting to see what happens with the sale of
Prudential Home Mortgage Corp., Clayton, MO, an $80-billion servicer owned by
Prudential Insurance Co.  "They want to see what type of price it commands and
who winds up with it," says one Wall Streeter.  "Once that is known, some of
the bigger players might want to rethink their strategy."

Greg Bennett, managing director for Los Angeles-based Hamilton, Carter, Smith,
believes there has actually been a supply shortage in servicing in recent
months, a situation he blames on an accounting change made by the Financial
Accounting Standards Board.  The change, referred to as FAS 122 (the number of
the rule), allows banks, mortgage bankers and other lenders to "capitalize" on
their balance sheets the servicing rights to loans they originate.
Previously, in the arcane world of accounting, only servicing rights that were
purchased on the open market could count as something of value on an
institution's balance sheet.  (The FASB rule is prospective, not retroactive.)

Bennett believes that a number of depositories that are heavily involved in
servicing "have been lulled into believing that FAS 122 has changed the
business, when in fact it has not."  Many firms are holding onto servicing
because they can count it as an asset without first having to sell it.  In
theory, this doesn't sound so bad-but capitalization does not immediately
translate into "real" cash.

"A mortgage servicer is still going to need cash," says Bennett, who has
brokered many a servicing deal in his day.  "The rule change didn't change the
economics of the business."

The HCS executive anticipates that it is only a matter of time before
companies that have been hoarding servicing begin bringing it to market once
again.  Once supply increases, prices likely will fall.

But other factors are affecting the market as well.  As U.S.  Banker went to
press in December, the bond market was continuing to rally, driving long-term
interest rates down even further.  John Wolf, a technology executive for the
mortgage division of Alltel Information Services, Jacksonville, FL, sees the
slide in rates accelerating mortgage refinancings-which, in turn, causes
servicing rights to "run off."

When this occurs, as it did during the refinancing boom of 1993, buyers of
servicing rights on new loans usually claw each other in the open market,
which increases prices.  That is good for servicing sellers, but bad for
buyers.

Currently, prices for new servicing rights on conventional, fixed-rate loans
are holding steady at about six times the servicing fee, brokers report.  (The
typical servicing fee on a Federal National Mortgage Association-purchased
loan is 25 basis points.)  But if rates fall just a bit, another price war for
newly originated product could accelerate.

In other words, the outlook for servicing rights is a bright one in 1996, and
experts anticipate that banks will continue to be big purchasers.  However, as
some banks continue to gobble up mortgage banking franchises (and the
servicing rights that go along with them), a few are exiting the business
entirely.  KeyCorp of Cleveland recently sold its servicing division, as did
Barclays American.

Bank of Boston Corp.  is spinning off BancBoston Mortgage Corp., Jacksonville,
FL, a $40-billion servicer, while First Bank System of Minneapolis is on the
verge of selling its mortgage division, FBS Mortgage Corp., St.  Paul.

Many of the current sales are being facilitated through a competitive bid
process, in which an offering circular on the target company is circulated to
prospective buyers.  However, some investment bankers feel that this year the
market could see an increase in privately negotiated transactions.  "I think
private, or 'direct' deals, represent a growing segment of the business," says
Ted Jadlos, a broker with United Financial Inc., Denver.


Based in Washington, D.C., Paul Muolo is a senior editor of National Mortgage
News, a Faulkner & Gray publication.

Embracing A Dynamic Market

JOHN A.  NIGH

Title:  President and CEO, MidAmerica Bank, St.  Paul, MN

New situation:  Comes to the Twin Cities from Wyoming, where he had been
president and CEO of Rocky Mountain Bank in Cheyenne before it was acquired in
1994 by Metropolitan Financial Corp.

Dynamic environment:  Nigh, an Indiana native, says he has had exposure over
the years to Minnesota and always admired the market.  "It's one of
strongest-growing economic areas in the country," he says.

Strategic thrust:  Plans to add new business services to MidAmerica, which has
27 branches and $650 million in assets in Minnesota and Wisconsin.  Says that
entails offering "a big basket of services," including cash management, to a
varied group of industries.  The margins in that business are attractive, and
"when you have such a diverse basket, you have a pretty diverse risk
situation."

Philosophy:  "We don't re-create the wheel.  We take a group of services, and
bundle and interlock them.  This gives the borrowers a lot better perspective,
sometimes, than they get elsewhere."  Believes that "the CEO is the number one
marketing person in the bank.  This is a sales business.  The whole game is
the manner of delivery."

Competition:  Acknowledges the prowess of superregional competitors like
Norwest Corp.  and First Bank System.  "We're not going to take that group
on," he says.  Believes there is a very viable place for a small bank that is
"both very high-touch and very high-tech."

Background:  Started in banking 23 years ago in Omaha, and ran two small
institutions in the 1970s.  Went to Wyoming in 1983, where he worked for Key
Bancshares (predecessor of KeyCorp) and rose to executive vice president.
Moved to Rocky Mountain Bank after it was formed in 1988 from the combination
of two failed thrifts.

Still in the Snow Belt:  Acknowledges that he can't expect warmer winters in
Minnesota, but says, "I think the wind is worse in Wyoming."


Plotting A Global Course

JOSEPH BARTOLONI

Title:  Managing Director, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce's Wood Gundy
Securities Inc.'s Global Technology Unit

Responsibilities:  Supervises systems development and product support for the
investment bank of the Toronto-based commercial banking company.

The vision thing:  Working closely with his boss, Tom Kielty, Wood Gundy's
senior vice president for technology, on a new information technology strategy
to support the firm's global capital markets and other securities operations.

Small is beautiful:  "The whole client/server environment is the core of our
direction," he says.  During the past 15 years, Bartoloni has observed smaller
platforms like workstations and personal computer local-area networks assume
the dominant role in investment banking.  "I don't even know if we have any
mainframes in our current environment."  In the past, workstations and PCs
were often just stopgap solutions for setting up new offices in London or
Tokyo.  Now, the small systems perform almost all of the firm's computing
tasks.

Need for speed:  In a world where dollars fly past yen at the speed of light,
and the European countries are in the midst of creating a common currency from
scratch, someone in Bartoloni's job has to work fast.  "The markets are the
dominating factor," and there's never a lot of time to work on new projects.

Background:  Ran a management consulting business for commercial and
investment banks for the past two years.  Spent the previous 13 years in
investment banking, including successive six-year stints at Merrill Lynch from
1980-86 and First Boston from 1986-92.  Also spent two years at Lehman
Brothers.

Education:  B.S.  and MBA from New York University, where he also studied
computer science.

Spare time:  Spends his free time with his wife, son and daughter, and he also
coaches the kids' soccer and basketball teams.
