<P>

<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">About 75 percent of US rural counties

added population between 1990 and 1995, versus 45 percent in the

1980s. The US has about 3,100 counties, and 2,304 are considered

rural.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">Overall rural population growth in the

first half of the 1990s was about 5.1 percent, versus 5.5 percent

in metropolitan areas. If grouped by the dominant activity in

the county, rural counties that serve as retirement centers added

14 percent to their populations in the first half of the 1990s,

rural recreational counties added 10 percent to their populations,

and commuting counties added seven percent more people.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">Rural counties gained an estimated 1.6

million people via net migration in the first half of the 1990s,

versus a loss of 1.4 million in the 1980s.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">Rural job growth has been faster than

urban job growth in the 1990s, especially in areas where certain

industries cluster, such as catfish processing in the Mississippi

Delta, and electronics in &quot;silicon forest&quot; near Portland.

Between 1989 and 1994, rural counties added a net 167,000 manufacturing

jobs, while urban counties lost 1.2 million manufacturing jobs.

Many of the newly created jobs in rural America pay lower than

average wages, often at least $1 per hour less than urban wages.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">A September 16, 1996 Wall Street Journal

profile of Wheaton, Minnesota, noted that the town's population

peaked at 2,100 in 1960, but was only 1,700 in the late 1980s.

Then, the town aggressively wooed manufacturers, and today has

more manufacturing jobs than workers.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">The US population in the 1990 Census

was 249 million, including 22 million Hispanics and 13 million

Mexican-origin residents. </FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">The Census of Population divides the

US into four regions: the Northeast, with 51 million residents

in 1990, four million Hispanics, and 175,000 Mexican-origin residents;

the Midwest, with 60 million residents, two million Hispanics,

and 1.1 million Mexican-origin residents; the South, with 85 million

residents, seven million Hispanics, and 1.2 million Mexican-origin

residents; and, the West, with 53 million residents, 10 million

Hispanics, and eight million Mexican-origin residents.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">The Census distinguishes between farm

and nonfarm residents. Many farm residents are not farmers, and

most farm workers are not farm residents. Farm residents are overwhelmingly

white. Minority farm residents are concentrated in two regions:

Blacks are in the Southeast--99 percent in 1984--and Spanish-origin

farm residents are mostly in the West--60 percent.</FONT></TT>
