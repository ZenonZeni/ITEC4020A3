<H1>Legislative Branch resources and pointers</h1>
<p>
It is interesting that the House, which has Newt, as fair WEB sites but
few congressmen have email. The Senate, which has no WWW site, by contrast has
email access for most of its members.
<ul>
<li>The Senate's Webpage is RSN. There is an old fashioned
<a href="gopher://gopher.senate.gov">gopher site</a>. 
<li>A fair number of senator's offices are on email either. See the
<a href="gopher://ftp.senate.gov:70/00h/member_e-mail">
Senate email directory</a>
<li>The <a href="http://www.house.gov">House of Representatives</a> is much more up to date as a WWW presence.
<li>The House also claims the Library of Congress' 
<a href="http"/thomas.loc.gov">Thomas legislative site</a>
<li>The Library of Congress has two more sites (librarians are into
information) so try  <a href="http://www.loc.gov"> the main LOC site</a>
and  their <a href="http://lcweb.loc.gov"> 'web' site</a>
<li>Information on <a href="http://ast1.spa.umn.edu/juan/congress.html">
contacting your congresscritters.</a>
<li><a href="http://www.gao.gov">General Accounting Office</a>
<li><a href="http://www.ota.gov">Office of Technology Assessment</a>
<li>Congressional Research Office.
</ul>
