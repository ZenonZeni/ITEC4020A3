<H3>ELECTRIC CARS PROVEN
TWICE AS EFFICIENT AS GASOLINE MODELS</H3>

<IMG ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=3 SRC="graphics/batpower.gif" width=216
height=162>GREENFIELD, Mass. - For the first time, gasoline and
electric-powered cars have been tested against each other in real-world
conditions - and the electric cars ran away with the prize. A week-long
series of tests found the top-ranked electric vehicles twi


ce as energy efficient as even the best gasoline-powered subcompact cars.<P>

	Testing was done during the annual American Tour de Sol electric vehicle race in May. During that event, four dozen vehicles - electric, solar and hybrid electric - raced more than 300 miles through the Northeast in road-rally style. They were joined by 









a "control" car - a 1995 Geo Metro sedan, one of the best mileage cars produced in the U.S. The gasoline-powered Metro traveled 35.8 miles per equivalent gallon while another Geo Metro, converted to electric power by Solectria Corporation in Massachusetts









, turned in an incredible 65.2 miles per equivalent gallon.<P>

	"This is the first time anyone has done a head-to-head test like this," according to race director Nancy Hazard. "We now know the electric cars make sense for energy conservation as well as environmental quality."<P>

	The top performer in the entire race was a four-seater, pre-production prototype vehicle also built by Solectria. This car, called the Sunrise, achieved a record 70.7 miles per equivalent gallon - a performance that exceeds President Clinton's challenge 









to triple the fuel efficiency of the present automobile by the year 2004. The Sunrise also won the first annual "NESEA Energy Challenge" award. Northeast Sustainable Energy Association (NESEA) offered the prize for the most efficient vehicle in each of fo









ur categories: two-seater and four-seater sedans, utility vehicles (truck or van) and motorcycles.<P>

	"Although we have been collecting efficiency data for the past six years at the American Tour de Sol, this is the first time we had the equipment necessary to compare energy use of electric, hybrid electric, and conventional gasoline vehicles," said Dr. 









Robert Wills, technical director of the race. "After collecting the data, we used crude oil as a benchmark and adjusted for the losses involved in refining gasoline or producing and transmitting electricity. We call this the  'well to wheels' efficiency o









f the vehicle."<P>

	The 1995 Geo Metro was chosen as a control vehicle because it is state-of-the-art and very efficient and it is often used as the basis for electric conversions. During the American Tour de Sol, it traveled 45 miles to the gallon which translates to 35.8 









miles per equivalent gallon after adjusting for losses incurred when making gasoline from crude oil. To translate energy use of the electric vehicles to equivalent miles per gallon, the efficiency of a similarly state-of-the-art natural gas-fired power pl









ant (51 percent efficient) and transmission losses of 7.5 percent were used.<P>

	In other words, a gallon of crude oil turned into gasoline gets you 35 miles down the road. But turning the same gallon of crude oil into electric vehicle power and you travel 70 miles down the road.<P>

	Other award winners included the Ford Ecostar, the most efficient utility vehicle, which drove 58.7 miles per equivalent gallon. The motorcycle prize went to the Schiller Group from Germany whose pre-production prototype, the Erange, traveled 245 miles p









er equivalent gallon.<P>

	This year's three hybrid vehicles where less efficiency than was hoped for, but the expected broad field of hybrids in next year's event should demonstrate the potential of this technology.<P>

	The "NESEA Energy Challenge" was created to bring attention to the importance of using the least energy possible to power our transportation system which accounts for 62 percent of the oil usage in the United States. Improving the efficiency of automobil









es can substantially cut our trade deficit, one-third of which is caused by imported oil.<P>

		The Northeast Sustainable Energy Association (NESEA) is the nation's leading regional association involved in promoting awareness, understanding and development of non-polluting, renewable energy technologies. Headquartered in Greenfield, Massachusetts,









 NESEA is celebrating its 20th year of working successfully in the fields
of transportation, building construction and energy.
