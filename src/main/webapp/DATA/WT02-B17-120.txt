The primary objectives of this work are to produce oxygen-tolerant, 
hydrogen-producing mutants from the green alga <I>Chlamydomonas 
reinhardtii</I>, test these hydrogenase mutants in a laboratory-scale 
system in 
which continuous photoproduction of hydrogen takes place under aerobic 
conditions, and collaborate with researchers at Oak Ridge National 
Laboratory 
(ORNL) to improve the efficiency of hydrogen production in this organism.

<P>
Hydrogen production from green algae has significant advantages 
compared with production from other biological systems.  Here, hydrogen 
production is theoretically more efficient; water is the direct substrate 
for the 
reaction, and there is no need for intermediary metabolites or biomass.  
However, 
there are also several practical limitations to using green algae in a 
photobiological 
hydrogen-producing system.  These include, first, the sensitivity of 
hydrogenase to 
oxygen; second, an oxy-hydrogen back reaction; and third, less efficient 
hydrogen 
production at high light intensity.  Our approach is to treat cell 
suspensions of 
<I>Chlamydomonas</I> with a mutagen and then select cells that survive 
under 
photoreducing conditions, which favor an oxygen-tolerant, 
hydrogen-consuming 
hydrogenase, as well as cells that survive under conditions that favor an 
oxygen-
tolerant, hydrogen-producing hydrogenase.  This dual approach allows us 
to select 
for mutants that not only show increased oxygen tolerance but may also 
exhibit 
decreased levels of the oxy-hydrogen reaction.  Any mutant strain 
isolated will be 
characterized in detail and tested for the continuous production of 
hydrogen under 
aerobic conditions in a bioreactor that also will be developed as part of 
this project.  
Finally, we will attempt to transfer the oxygen-tolerance trait to 
organisms being 
developed at ORNL that function more efficiently at high light intensity.

<P>
Our efforts to date included setting up optimal growth conditions for two 

strains of <I>Chlamydomonas</I>, a wild-type strain (137c) and a 
cell-wall-less strain 
(cw15) that may be more amenable to genetic transformation techniques.  
We also made 
preliminary measurements of simultaneous oxygen and hydrogen production 
in both strains, and studied the levels of oxygen required to inhibit 
hydrogen production.  With these baseline 
parameters established, we will begin our selection for mutants.
<P>
<b><I>Recent Advances</I></b>
<P>
We recently completed characterization of the response of wild-type and 
cw15 <I>Chlamydomonas</I> to photoreductive and hydrogen-producing 
selective 
conditions.  In preliminary experiments, we selected for a few surviving 
organisms in 
nonmutagenized cultures, and we are now testing whether their sensitivity 
to oxygen 
has decreased.
