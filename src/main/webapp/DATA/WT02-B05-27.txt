<P>
The increasing use of the Internet by children, combined with the ease of
collecting personal information online, raise serious privacy issues.  Over the past several months, concerns about the availability and use of personal information in the online world, particularly with respect to the collection and use of information about children, have prompted Congress to seriously consider this important issue.
<P>
Legislation designed to restrict the collection and use of personal
information about children without parental consent was introduced
by Rep. Bob Franks (R-NJ) on May 22, 1996.  While the bill (<A HREF="HR3508_text.html">H.R. 3508</A>) is supported by various groups, including Enough is Enough and Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC), it has sparked concerns from cyber-rights advocates that it may end up increasing the collection of personal information online and result in restrictions on the free flow of information.
<P>
The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), People for the American Way (PFAW) Action Fund, Voters Telecommunications Watch (VTW), and CDT sent Rep. Franks a letter regarding his legislation on June 4, 1996.  In the letter, the groups expressed concern that the bill, in its current form, raises some of the same privacy and free flow of information concerns raised by the Exon/Coats <A HREF="/cda.html">&quot;Communications Decency Act&quot;</A> to the extent that it is extremely difficult to know whether or not a person visiting a web site is or is not a child without requiring all visitors to identify themselves.
<P>
On September 12, 1996, the Crime Subcommittee of the House Judiciary Committee held a hearing on the bill.  CDT sent <A HREF="960911_subcomm_let.html">a letter</A> to subcommittee members reiterating its concerns about the bill.
