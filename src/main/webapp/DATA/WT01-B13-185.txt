<H3>KEMPER FUNDS GROUP JOINS SCHWAB'S INSTITUTIONAL ONESOURCE</H3>
<P>
<B>CHICAGO</B> (October 31) --Kemper Funds management today announced
that it has signed an agreement with Charles Schwab &amp; Co.
to offer Class A shares of 22 mutual funds at net asset value
through Schwab's Institutional OneSource program. Kemper recently
began offering its funds to advisors at net asset value through
Fidelity's Institutional FundsNetwork and Jack White &amp; Co.'s
NoFee Network, and is currently in negotiations with several other
fund &quot;supermarket&quot; programs.
<P>
&quot;Schwab's Institutional OneSource was the next logical step
for us in gaining a stronger foothold in the burgeoning fee-based
advisory channel,&quot; said John Norris, first vice president
and head of the registered investment advisor unit at Kemper Distributors,
Inc., the principal underwriter and distributor for the Kemper
Funds. &quot;In order to be well-positioned in the future, we
need to form relationships with established distribution outlets
that cater to this very important and growing segment of our business.
Schwab is a market leader in providing registered investment advisors
with superior back-office services, so it was very natural for
us to gravitate toward them.&quot;
<P>
Norris emphasized that Kemper remains fully committed to selling
its funds through investment professionals. &quot;We believe in
the power of financial advice and we will continue to expand distribution
relationships with programs where financial advisors are providing
their services to customers.&quot;
<P>
<A HREF="../aboutzki.html">Zurich Kemper Investments, Inc.</A> (ZKI), is the investment advisor
to the <A HREF="../aboutkemper.html"> Kemper Funds</A>, which consists of 30 open-end funds with
over 70 portfolios and seven closed-end funds. Kemper Funds has
nearly $45 billion in assets. ZKI is part of Zurich Insurance
Group, a global organization headquartered in Zurich, Switzerland,
that provides services in life and property-casualty insurance,
reinsurance and asset management in more than 45 countries.
