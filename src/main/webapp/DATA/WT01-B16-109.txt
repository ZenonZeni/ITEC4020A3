<H3>Near-Term Plutonium Disposition and Nuclear Power Generation: The
Dual Purpose Concept. William G. Counsil.</H3>
<P>



The Washington Public Power Supply System (WPPSS) generates electricity for the
Pacific Northwest region, and operates the 1120 MWe nuclear plant WNP2 on the
USDOE's Hanford Reservation, Washington State, plus two partially completed
nuclear plants. WPPSS is the only organisation with power reactors licensed by the
US Nuclear Regulatory Commission to entertain the use weapons plutonium in
commercial reactors.<P>

The WPPSS proposal is to burn surplus weapons plutonium as MOX in the Hanford
reactors thereby disposing of it and simultaneously generating commercial
electricity. The USDOE would provide for processing of the plutonium into MOX
(probably on the Hanford Reservation), which would undergo a once-through fuel
cycle, spent MOX fuel being returned to USDOE for storage and disposal. USDOE
would support conversion of WNP1 and 2 to MOX burners and pay operation and
maintenance costs, and the Supply System would continue to own and operate
them, licensed by the NRC. Revenues from the sale of power would serve as a credit
against the government's costs.<P>

Advantages of the concept are enhanced safety and efficiency, through centralised
operations on one site; proven technology; cost effectiveness, with an existing
infrastructure; promptness of disposition as compared with other methods;
environmental soundness; and potential impetus for any international cooperative
effort. The concept is consistent with US non-proliferation policy and actually
decreases the amount of separated plutonium and hence the risk of diversion.<P>

Other advantages include generation of reliable and competitively priced electricity;
diversification of regional electricity generating sources; job creation; and
environmental preservation (reducing reliance on hydro and adding generating
capacity without either the need for new facilities or increased greenhouse gases).<P>

The other recommended disposition option, vitrification, compares unfavourably
with the WPPSS proposal. It is not proven technology, it fails to meet the spent fuel
standard and it does not offset the cost of disposition by electricity generation.<P>

The National Academy of Sciences has concluded that the use of MOX in
commercial reactors is one of the most viable options for plutonium disposition. The
WPPSS proposal is very much in line with emerging US policy on plutonium
disposition, which is looking for a speedy solution to the problem of surplus in the
interests of global arms reduction and non-proliferation. The Supply System looks
forward to playing a key role in US policy in this area.<P>
