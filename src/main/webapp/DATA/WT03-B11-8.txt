SMARTS INTRODUCES INTERNET SERVICES MANAGEMENT SOFTWARE

Self-Managing Internet Software From System Management ARTS

Pity no more the beleaguered Internet Administrator; novice or
professional. Totally automated, self-managing Internet server
and service administration is here.

The first public demonstrations of a unique software package,
"InCharge For The Internet" created by System Management ARTS
(SMARTS), White Plains, NY, took place during the E-Mail World
& Internet Expo, in Boston.

InCharge employs company developed, "Management by
Delegation" and "Codebook Event Correlation" (patent pending),
for creating automated management products that use familiar
and intuitive Web-based forms.

InCharge automates the installation, configuration and
day-today management of all major Internet services. InCharge
Server software currently runs on Solaris. The server can be
accessed from any client with a Web browser.

SMARTS president, Dr. Shaula Alexander Yemini stated that,
"New users will appreciate the simplicity of InCharge that
masks complex functionality, while experienced administrators
will enjoy the recoverability and automated problem management
features that dramatically reduce the time needed to
administer Internet services."

Features of InCharge include management of all major services
(Web, FTP, E-Mail, DNS and USENET news); error-proof,
task-oriented configuration; automated problem management;
robust service and management security; and Delegation for
managing multiple servers concurrently.

User benefits include: dramatic reduction in time and effort
to manage Internet services; higher availability of servers
and services; enhanced security; and unlimited scalability to
multi-server sites.

"InCharge simplifies Internet service configuration by
turning obscure low-level tasks into intuitive point-and-click
operations," stated Brian Wade, SMARTS Sales and Marketing
Director. "For example, adding a nows feed without InCharge is
a complex, error-prone, time-consuming, lo-step task. InCharge
accomplishes the task reliably, easily and quickly with three
clicks."

System requirements are X86-based personal computer or SUN
workstation running Solaris; 32 Megabytes of RAM and 500
Megabytes disk space. Training is not required.

InCharge For The Internet is priced under $7,000 per server

ALISAMAIL SOLVES E-MAIL INCOMPATABILITY

Corporate America's growing dependence on E-mail to facilitate
high speed communication in the workplace, and the use of
different platforms to perform different tasks has given rise
to a new problem: Multiple, incompatible E-mail systems that
cannot communicate with each other. With fast, reliable and
cost-effective communication being essential to maintaining a
competitive edge in today's global marketplace, the inability
to communicate with clients, vendors, distributors, and other
employees can hinder growth and stifle profits.

with increasing frequency, companies are finding that they
have a mix of E-mail programs that don't communicate with each
other installed on PCs, Macintoshes, UNIX workstations and
legacy mainframes. When E-mail systems can't communicate with
each other, savings gained by effective communications cannot
be realized.

At some point, senior management wakes up to the fact that in
the "paperless office", corporate-wide E-mail is essential.
The task of integration is usually assigned to the corporate
Information Systems (IS) group who are faced with the
challenge of integrating the various existing departmental
E-mail systems.

This is a complicated task that involves making systems
interoperate, share directory information and documents across
different platforms.

This does not mean, however, that a standardized,
corporate-wide E-mail system needs to be purchased. Mail
integration technology is widely used to connect disparate
systems. The numerous benefits of integrating existing systems
make the concept a sensible alternative.

First, businesses preserve their initial investment. This
investment is not limited to the cost of the original E-mail
system packages, but includes the cost of servers needed to
run the system and the training of users.

These users often have limited computer experience and are
reluctant to give up their favorite E-mail system after
spending hours getting accustomed to its features and
capabilities. By switching E-mail systems in an effort to
standardize, users are taken out of their friendly computer
environment and placed into an unknown one.

Mail integration software solves this problem by allowing
users to seamlessly communicate with a variety of other mail
systems in a "friendly" manner. The address and message is
'switched" to make it appear as if users are communicating
with a computer on their very same E-mail system!

Second, mail integration can buy a company time to implement
an enterprise-wide migration strategy to wean users off older
legacy based mainframe systems and prepare them for a
standard-based information system. Additional benefits depend
on the particular features offered by the mail integration
software they select.

The technological demands of integration are extensive.
Choosing a mail integrator requires a careful examination of
features, benefits and reputation. Integration vendors
approach the issue differently and the results differ. Alisa
Systems has long been an industry leader in mail systems
integration. They have a reputation for being the best in the
business according to high tech computer publications and
other independent sources whose job it was to compare
integration systems.

Alisa offers a complete mail integration package called
AlisaMail. AlisaMail is a full-featured E-mail switch that
interconnects the most popular LAN-based electronic mail
systems. It provides seamless and transparent exchange of
electronic messages, fully editable documents and binary files
between WordPerfect GroupWise, Microsoft Mail, Lotus cc:Mail,
CE Software QuickMail, X.400, SMTP and Digital VMSmail,
ALL-IN-1 and Message Router. This includes spread sheets, word
processing documents, graphic and binary files. Most
importantly, AlisaMail is built on a relational database,
Sybase, that makes the system extremely flexible. "The really
strong point of the system is it's easy to customize how
information is presented." said Don Cole, president of Alisa
Systems.

The OpenDirectory, Automatic Directory Synchronization and
Message Switch are the strengths of the system and separate
AlisaMail from the competition.

The OpenDirectory is implemented using a Sybase SQL relational
database and can be used as a corporate directory service.
OpenDirectory, a unique AlisaMail feature, eliminates
complicated addressing schemes by maintaining a common address
book synchronized with each mail system.

This "master" directory can include an address book of
customers, employees and vendors that contains information
such as their title, organization, department name, E-mail and
postal address, telephone and FAX number, as well as a
photograph. The OpenDirectory provides a centralized address
book for all the E-mail users in their company. It is accessed
by either the user's E-mail client or an Alisa client/server
application called PeopleFinder.

PeopleFinder supports quick and easy on-line searching of the
AlisaMail Open Directory. Users may search specific fields in
the database such as Name, Title, Organization and Location.
Available for Windows, Macintosh and DEC VMS, PeopleFinder
allows users to browse the OpenDirectory and its contents to
display information not accessable in the user's address book.

Existing desktop client/server development tools and
applications can also be used to access the OpenDirectory.
With Sybases's openserver technology you can even connect to
other corporate databases.

Auto Directory Synchronization works hand in hand with the
OpenDirectory and is the key to mail systems integration.
Without Auto Directory Synchronization, the Open Directory
would be useless. Open Directory creates and maintains a
master directory of all E-mail users in by requesting
directory updates from each separate mail system. When changes
are made in one E-mail system such as adding, modifying or
deleting an E-mail address, the information is then
transferred to the master directory and then used to update
all the other directories.

In medium to large companies where there can be many changes,
AlisaMail allows the updating to be performed automatically.
The superior performance of our Auto Directory Synchronization
is made possible by the flexibility of the SQL database. "In
essence, AlisaMail makes each mail system's directory an
aggregate of all the users. It represents the entire
population and there is no distinction in where these people
live." said Cole.

AlisaMail utilizes a multi-port gateway which connects the
different E-mail systems to the AlisaMail Message Switch.

The gateway and Message Switch act as a store-and-forward
message hub and also handle the conversion of message formats
as required by the E-mail systems. The Message Switch
preserves the functionality of each mail system because it
stores the message in its unaltered format. The format of the
message is then converted only if the recipient mail system
requires conversion. If the receiving mail system does not
support all the functionality of the sender's, the Message
Switch will preserve as much functionality as possible.

Alisa Systems takes full responsibility for the success of
your E-mail integration. Alisa Systems will conduct on-site
surveys to determine your specific mail integration needs and
provide a customized solution. They will even install
AlisaMail on site for you, train you and help you fine-tune
the system to maximize performance in your environment.

"There's lots of bits and places for information to be stored
in a corporation and people need access to it," says Cole,
"There is a technology out there that can help you run your
business and save money."
