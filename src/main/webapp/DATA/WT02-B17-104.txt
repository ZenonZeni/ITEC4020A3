Certain metals are able to adsorb and retain hydrogen under specific 
temperature and pressure conditions and then release the gas under 
different conditions.  These metal hydrides have some advantages over 
high-pressure or low-temperature techniques for storing hydrogen.  They 
have very high volumetric density, are relatively safe, and do not 
require cooling or monitoring.  In addition, they have already been used 
in vehicles.  A major disadvantage of hydrides, particularly for 
transportation, is their relatively low weight density (that is, the 
weight of the hydrogen in comparison to the total weight of the system). 

<P>
The purpose of this research is to investigate and improve the hydrogen 
storage 
properties of lightweight hydrides.  Many previous studies of hydride 
technology have focused 
on magnesium compounds.  However, these studies often involved very high 
temperatures that 
significantly changed the microstructure of the compounds being measured, 
giving inaccurate 
results.  Our approach in studying magnesium-based hydrides is to modify 
the surface to allow measurements to be made at lower temperatures 
(&lt300&#186;C); add different alloys to see which ones result in a more 
stable compound (notably, Mg2Ni and MgAlNi); and study the 
microstructure throughout the process to ensure that measurements are 
accurate.

<b>The Hydride Properties Database</b>
<p>
<a href="http://hydpark.ca.sandia.gov/ROFM_CGI/data_intro.html">The 
Hydride Properties Database</a> is now available on the World Wide Web.  
Funded by the
U.S. Department of Energy's Hydrogen Program in support of the 
International Energy Agency
Annex 12 project on metal hydrides, this free database is the first of 
four databases that will
eventually make up Sandia National Laboratories' on-line Hydrogen 
Information Center.  The
Hydride Properties Database was created to make basic property data 
available to those interested in utilizing hydrides or beginning research 
in this area.  Structured to allow on-line searches, the database 
includes numerous hydriding elements, alloys, and intermetallic 
compounds.  Properties covered include tabulations of basic pressure, 
composition, and temperature (PCT) data.  Values of enthalpy and entropy 
changes are included, allowing users to calculate PCT thermodynamic 
conditions.  Also included are metallurgy and synthesis, activation, 
kinetics, cyclic stability, morphology, and gas impurity effects.  
Commercial suppliers, applications, and references for further reading 
are also part of the database.<p>
A novel bed immobilization method was devised using a microporous

polymer.  This method does not add significantly to the hydride

bed weight and should be effective in the management of material

redistribution and heat flow within the bed.  Our initial results

indicated no adverse interaction between the polymer and the hydride

alloy.  We found no problems during activation, and there

are indications of  faster hydrogen loading.  With some optimization

of pore sizes and material density, a measurable improvement in

system kinetics may be achievable.  A patent disclosure was submitted

for the process.
