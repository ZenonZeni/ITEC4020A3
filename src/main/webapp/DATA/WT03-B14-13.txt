Motorola has come out with a new four line pager, Advisor Elite. This
pager can receive a message of up to 1995 characters or 400 words and it
has a memory to store around 6,000 words. The pager also has a facility
for mail drops which allow the user to receive information services. It
has 12 slots for such mail drops. The value-added services will vary
from one service provider to another.

The Advisor also has a holographic LCD which improves the quality of the
display. Other features include a battery gauge to check battery life, a
key click which confirms that you have depressed a key and an auto
backlight which comes on in poor light on the press of any key. The
Advisor Elite will be manufactured at Motorola's pager manufacturing

Pentafour Communications Ltd, the communications division of the
Pentafour Group, has drawn up massive expansion plans. The company has

and domestic cordless telephones.

According to a reliable source, the company would initially start these
ventures as CKD and SKD assembling units which could, later on, take up
full-fledged manufacturing. It has already tied up with a Korean company
in this regard. The company has got an order worth Rs 80 crore from ITI
for the supply of digital exchanges.

Sources also disclosed plans about Pentafour's interest in telecom
training and confirmed that the company is planning to set up a
full-fledged training centre offering GSM, Internet training along with
facilities of communication software development.

NEWS ON THE CIRCUIT: MOTOROLA BAGS $54 MILLION CONTRACT

from VOICE AND DATA (India), Vol 3, Issue 4, October 1996

Motorola's International Cellular Infrastructure Group (ICIG) has signed
an order with Modicom Network to deploy digital cellular telephone
networks in the states of Karnataka and Punjab. Modicom Network plans to
launch Motorola's GSM Communications service for the subscribers in
these states by the end of 1996.

Mandated by Indian government, GSM is a digital cellular standard based
on an open architecture network that uses the same number of frequencies
as traditional analog, but in tighter re-use patterns and more traffic
carrying capacity.

NEWS ON THE CIRCUIT: MOTOROLA'S WORKAHOLIC FOR THOSE WHO REALLY ARE

from VOICE AND DATA (India), Vol 3, Issue 4, October 1996

Motorola has launched MicroTAC 8700 digital phone first in India among
the Asia-Pacific nations. Called Workaholic, this phone is targeted at
the workaholic executive class for whom even a single minute is
precious.

Initially launched in a GSM 900 mode, it will be followed by the GSM
1800 and 1900 digital (PCN/PCS) services versions. The 8700 Workaholic
is claimed to be GSM Phase 2 compliant, allowing mobile originated SMS
text messages, plus fixed dialling, and advice of charge calls to be

Advantec Network Solutions has tied up with Allied Telesyn
International, USA, for distributing the latter's networking products in
India. Allied's product range comprises low end hubs, network interface
cards, and transceivers. The products will be distributed through
Advantec's distribution channels which include around 126 systems
integrators and resellers. Though Advantec distributes hubs of UB
Networks as well, it does not see any fundamental conflict in taking up
Allied's products. For one, the primary product offering from Allied is
transceivers. Its hubs are mainly in the low end and as such do not
compete with UB's hubs which are primarily targeted at the mid range and
enterprise market. Besides, says Joshua Barton, vice-president of
Advantec, "Being a distributor and not a value-added reseller ensures
that we will not push one particular product. Sales is customer
dependent."

Additionally, to strengthen its channel network, Advantec has recently
introduced a programme, "Compass", to enable small systems integrators
to take on multi-location projects, which they could not do earlier due
to geographical or resource constraints. Advantec will play the role of
the connecting agent by partnering the small systems integrators with
other systems integrators in its network. In addition, support will be
provided through training, technical planning, and product sourcing.

CONNECT INDIA '96: A success show, going by the number of participants,
displays, and visitors

from VOICE AND DATA (India), Vol 3, Issue 4, October 1996

Despite the prolonged sultriness of Delhi, Connect India '96 went off
very smoothly in the spacious air-conditioned halls of Taj Palace.
Inaugurated on 29 September by ex-DoE secretary, N Vittal, the man
behind the Telecom Policy 1994. "Connectivity is the operating word ...

Technology is giving us options, but we should make sure of its
utilizations," proposed Vittal in his inaugural speech, followed by the
cutting of ribbon to begin the show.

The companies participating in the show included most of the biggies in
the industry. Among them were Adroit Technologies, Accel Automation,
Datamatics, Elnet Technologies, HTL, Intel Asia Electronics, Intex
Technologies (India), ITI, Microsense Computers, Netran Information
Access, Pioneer Digital, Seacom Solutions, Technoware Systems, Tropicana
Enterprises, Usha Communication, Vertex Infotech, VSNL, Voxtron Dezign
Lab, and Worldwide Technologies.

Intel was greeting the visitors with its big and furnished stall. In
fact, it had put up its ad on the very threshold of the exhibition. And
the best designed stall was undoubtedly that of Microcom. The company
that seemed to have taken back its presence was Voxtron Dezign Lab. The
reason--not disclosed. Tropicana Enterprises, an associate of Kelvinator
and now the authorized dealer of AirTel services and distributor of
Casio pagers, was giving away free wrist watches when one purchased a
pager. The stall was mostly crowded with visitors peeping into for a
window shop of pagers and cell phone models.

The thrust areas of exhibition seemed to be Internet, Connectivity, and
Modems. There had been seminars going since morning till evening. The
organizations taking part in the conference included ITI, Bharti,
Qualcomm, DoT, VSNL, MTNL, NIIT, and HTL. Eminent speakers were invited
to speak on conferences. And spoke Vijay Thadani from NIIT on NII, BA
Majmudar from Qualcomm on CDMA in rural communication, RK Gupta from
VSNL on Internet and others on various other subjects.

And VSNL sponsored to take care of the gourmet's stomach in between the
long hours of conference sessions.

It was definitely a three-day mega show with visitors crowding in. The
age group ranged from little ones to elderly persons. And, the
visibility of people from the armed forces as well as police forces was
there. Making a great effort and a real success.

Jyoti Bhushan Pany, managing director, Radiant Electronics Ltd. Today,
FM RDS paging, Radiant, and JB Pany are really a dream team in the
Indian paging industry. Now, Radiant has its operation in 16 out of the
17 cities, where FM RDS paging is available.

JB Pany or Dulal Pany, as his friends call him lovingly, is modest,
casual, calculative, and polished. He always believes in the
theory--learn to live happily. This man from Orissa was born on 10 July
1953 in Cuttack. His father was a government servant and mother a simple
Oriya housewife, very caring and affectionate. After completing his
schooling and intermediate in Orissa he joined LIT, Nagpur, from where
he successfully completed his chemical engineering course in 1975. Then
Pany returned back to Orissa to be an entrepreneur.

His entrepreneurial strategy was simple--"get people better than you and
have faith in them". With this unique idea in mind, he started his
business in Bhubaneswar. First in 1981, he started developing aromatic
chemical, Bromostyrole. And in 1983, he formed a company, Mechem Pvt
Ltd, in collaboration with RTZ, Germany. Primarily, the company was
dealing in fibre glass and FRP. In the very next year, Mechem bagged a
major order from Nuclear Fuel Complex. However, the company also started
assembling TV sets on behalf of Surya Udyog in 1984. Giving a boost to
Pany's entrepreneurialship, his company received national award for
production excellence in 1987.

The year 1984-85 saw a major change. From chemicals the company switched
over to electronics. On 5 September 1986, Radiant Electronics Ltd was
incorporated. It is a joint sector company with Orissa State Electronics
Development Corp., in technical collaboration with C-DOT. In 1994, the
company diversified into FM RDS paging, through its division called
Radiant Connect.

He says that team work has been the key to the success of his company.
He is a man is grateful to all those who are behind his and Radiant's
success. Sam Pitroda is his role model. And, in Pany's opinion, Pitroda
is the man who shaped up Indian telecom revolution. He also gives credit
to the people of Orissa for their continuous encouragement.

On the family front too, Pany is leading a happy life. He met his better
half in Nagpur. He has all praises for her when he says, "she is more an
Oriya than a Maharastrian". She helps him in his business activities and
handles the TV assembling unit. She is also a very good wooden furniture
designer. The Pany couple has two children, a son and a daughter. Both
are studying at Dehradun.

Besides being an excellent manager, he is also a good leader. He was the
chairman of CII, Orissa. Once, travelling was his hobby. Now, it is a
necessity. He travels almost three cities in a week on business trips.

Besides travelling, he is also very fond of socializing and reading,
especially technical magazines. He loves to spend his spare time at the
golf course or in the billiards room. In fact, he has won the Jamshedpur
steel city billiards tournament too.

About his employees, he says that their union is one among the most
enlightened and disciplined ones in the country today. He feels proud of
them that they are, to some extent, the jack of all trades and the
master of FM RDS paging.

Coming to the future of FM RDS paging, he is very optimistic. And he
believes that once the nation-wide network is established, 70 percent of
country will be covered by Radiant.

With a vast experience behind him, Pany is the driving force at Radiant.
However, he is reluctant in admitting this and attributes everything to
his colleagues, saying that they are his strength. A virtue that drives
this Dulal Pany, relentlessly.

VIPIN MALHOTRA - SAW FAR, SAW GOOD

from VOICE AND DATA (India), Vol 3, Issue 4, October 1996

From TV to telecom, it is not a smooth transition normally. But then,
where there is a will, there is a way. And Vipen Malhotra,
vice-president, Arvind Telecom, is testament to this adage. A mature
face which reflects that experience has been the best teacher for him.
He wears a typical Punjabi look. Broad shoulders and a good height are a
certain plus in his personality.

Vipen was born on 11 August 1956 in Punjab. After completing his
schooling, he had his degree in electronics from Punjab Engineering
College, Chandigarh. To have a perfect combination--engineering coupled
with management--he went on to do his MBA from Punjab University. Vipen
started off his professional career as marketing executive at
Continental Devices India Ltd (CDIL) in 1980 in Ahemdabad. When CDIL
joined hands with a German company for colour TV technology transfer and
agency operations in India, Vipen turned out to be a shot in the arm for
CDIL. He managed all the affairs almost single handedly and brought in a
tremendous business for the company. He was then promoted as marketing
manager and was asked to take on an additional responsibility area. And
this was to market the CTV components which did not come with the
original kit.

He did that job well too and acquired a considerable marketshare for the
company. It was in 1986 that he came up with an idea of fusing
technology with style. To launch the range of vertical black and white
TVs. But CDIL was not ready for the investment required. And Vipen, as
ever, was a man who wanted to change with the times. He joined Arvind
Mills' electronic division as general manager, operations, in September
1987.

It was here that his life took a full turn. And it was here that his
career bloomed. Arvind Mills' telecommunication division had then
designed a small EPABX system in-house. The problem that lay ahead was
its mass production and marketing countrywide. Vipen accepted the
challenge. He worked vigorously on the project and brought down the cost
of production to a considerable level. Not satisfied with just this, he
went on to successfully sell around 250 exchanges in just a short span
of nine months. Albeit, Arvind Mills ventured late into the big and
complex arena of telecommunication, it soon became one of the big names
in rural automatic exchange manufacturing under his active leadership.
The company is on the verge of almost tripling its production of small E
PABXes.

On the workfront, his vision is to make Arvind Telecom, India's largest
suppliers of small EPABX systems and to eat a major share of the radio
trunking pie in India. "We are already in a process of establishing
ourselves in 10 cities in the trunked radio business licensed to us and
are working on making a name in the field of Public Mobile Radio Trunked
Services," says Vipen. For trunked radio, his company has a tie-up with
EF Johnson of the US.

When he is not thinking of telecom and business, he loves to watch
cricket with his elder son who is nine-and-a-half years old. In his
college times, Vipen used to be the captain of his university badminton
team and a member of the tennis team. These days, he is keen on golf. He
also likes to potter in his house garden whenever he manages to do that.

Reading happens to be another favourite pastime with him. And that is
mostly on business and modern management techniques. As far as the music
goes, he prefers golden oldies--both Western and Indian (non classical).

Wife Radhika was earlier into ethnic dress designing, but with the birth
of his second son who is two-and-a-half years old now, she prefers
devoting full time to the family for Vipen.

Things were not easy initially, but then he climbed the heights. Rightly
said, its all in the attitude. Coupled with aptitude. And he is a fine
example.

PAGING - THE VOICE MATTERS

from VOICE AND DATA (India), Vol 3, Issue 4, October 1996

The operators' job is not a dull one, after all. There is excitement and
fun, as well.

Every telecom service segment--cellular, E-mail, or VSAT--calls for its
own skillset. What makes paging so special, however, is that in the
actual service-delivering, no other communication service involves human
beings. In paging, the interface with the customer is a voice. And much
of the subscriber perception emanates from the voice.

The more live and vibrant the voice, the better it is. A disembodied
mechanical voice is a complete put off. Says Sandip Das, CEO, Hutchison
Max Telecom (MaxPage), "The human interface holds a great deal of
importance in the Indian context." Apparently, research into Asians and
their interaction has revealed that Asians relate much better to humans
than machines. It is in this context that the role of a paging operator
becomes critical. Besides, in the Indian context, the operator's role
carries more importance as operator-assisted paging is more popular in
comparison to automatic paging. A paging operator has to do more than
just receive and send messages.

Once they receive a message, the paging operators have to verify it
while keying the message simultaneously into the computer in front of
them and send it off. The job carries a lot more responsibility; the
voice has to convey a sense of reliability and also sustain the
freshness and vibrancy through the day. All the senses should be alert
as she has to listen to the message and enter it on the terminal
simultaneously. Besides, they are required to have multi-lingual skills
to translate messages. For instance, when a message comes in Marathi,
the operator should be in a position to translate and enter it in
English on the spot. Hence, knowledge of at least two languages,
depending upon the location, is a prerequisite for this job.

Surely, sitting in front of a terminal eight hours a day, constantly
listening to messages and sending them after a double check, cannot be
all that exciting. Instead, it is bound to be taxing and tiring. So the
onus of keeping the paging operators motivated lies with the employer,
as the quality and performance of the people who form the "voice" will
determine to a large extent the success of the service provider. So the
key is to keep the voice as good as possible. For as much time as
possible. That is what every paging operating company is trying to do.

It is an HRD exercise of a different sort.

It could vary from designating paging operators as paging officers to
providing them with cafeteria and rest room with TV and music system to
relax. While on one hand, the designation bestows the operators with a
sense of dignity, the restroom helps these operators to take a break in
the midst of their gruelling day. For, on an average, an operator
handles around 50-60 calls an hour. During peak hours, this number is
likely to go up by 50 percent.

On an average, an operator handles around 50-60 calls an hour. During
peak hours, this number is likely to go up by 50 per cent.

Running through most of the service providers, the sops offered are more
or less similar. For instance, all of them have introduced uniforms to
impart a sense of uniformity and to eliminate any differences that may
have surfaced due to economic or cultural factors. The distinctive
flavours come in the form of throwing open the field to employees to
design their uniforms, like in the case of MaxPage, which changes the
uniform every six months. What it does promote a sense of belonging and
pride in the organization. Says Sandra Mahadwar, head (human resources),
MaxPage, "They are able to give their expression to their
creative urgings."

Nearly all of them arrange outdoor activities which could be sports like
at RPG Paging or picnics at DSS Communications. In a city like Mumbai,
Pagepoint Services, a Motorola joint venture, adds a dash of excitement
by having a bash at a disco. Here, the operators have an opportunity to
socialize not only among themselves but also with the rest of the
company staff which brings about a team feeling. In addition to these,
there are in-house magazines and cultural events. Modelling for the
company is also not ruled out. For all its advertisements, MaxPage has
roped in only its employees to model.

Despite the similarity, most go a little further in different ways. For
instance, at RPG Paging Services, Madras, a recreation club has been set
up within the office premises equipped with exercycle, indoor sports,
and aerobic facilities. Pagepoint follows a five-day week pattern for
all its employees, including the paging operators. Says Micheal Latimer,
president, Pagepoint Services, "They have two days to themselves, to
relax and get ready for another hectic week and as they are an integral
part of Pagepoint there is no reason why they shouldn't enjoy similar
benefits."

All of these become relevant in the light of the fact that most
operators--on an average 60 percent--are women. Some, like MaxPage, have
a 100 percent women workforce in some select cities like Bangalore and
Mumbai. The night shifts are usually managed by male operators with some
exceptions like at MaxPage in Bangalore and Mumbai. Says Suresh
Srinivasan, general manager, Pagepoint Services, "It is purely for
safety reasons that we have men in the night shift as then transport and
security are not an issue." Despite this, MaxPage prefers to have women
on the rolls. It does add a bit to their expense list, given that they
have a duty officer and security staff during night shifts.

We put people ahead of paging

Besides, they pick and drop their "officers" outside their doorstep.
MaxPage even encourages the applicants to bring their parents along when
called for an interview. While the candidate is undergoing the
interview, parents are given a tour of the office and shown the
facilities that will be provided to a paging officer.

Now moves like these come handy, specially in small cities like Ludhiana
which tend to be conservative and where parents are not as open to
sending their "girls" to work. It is precisely for these reasons that
most service providers have men in their night shift. Though at RPG,
women working in the last shift between 12.15 p.m. to 8.45 p.m. are
entitled to a car drop back home, women working in the last shift is
generally avoided. Says Preetha R Ramakrishnan, assistant manager
(personnel and administration), RPG Paging, "Due to personal
constraints, women are not asked to work at night."

We believe we should trust and respect our employees

Apart from these, operators are given awards and incentives in order to
motivate them to perform better. Most of them have fairly elaborate
monitoring system. Based on the observation, the operator is given a
feedback and the freedom to evolve a self correcting process. "This,
says Latimer, "helps operators perceive their role better." The ultimate
aim is getting the operators to understand that they play a key role in
satisfying the customer. And, hence, the efforts of the company are
directed towards this goal. Pagepoint has an award for the "best paging
operator" for the week, month, and year. Apart from that incentives are
given, based on various parameters both qualitative and quantitative.

These also help in taking the drudgery and monotony of the job. Unlike
other jobs, an operator's job (in spite of being called paging officers)
does not provide too many avenues for growth within the organization.

Not that they cannot opt for anything else. Sure they can go from being
an operator to a shift supervisor or they could move into other areas
like customer service or finance, depending on their preferences and
capabilities.

Well, given the competitive nature of business today, most
companies--service and non--service--have come to realize that the cost
of training a fresher is disproportionate to the money spent on these
activities, which have long-term benefit. However, in the paging
industry, it takes more preeminence because of the "people intensive"
operations and more dependance on the human factor than the technology.
Given these, the attrition rate among paging operators is very low.

They all claim that none of them have lost any of their operators to
competitors. Of course, poaching is against IPSA rules. The rule is not
a law in itself but more of a gentlemen's agreement. Most of them claim
to have lost paging operators not due to the nature of the job but more
due to personal reasons like marriage. In fact, the nature of the job or
working in shifts have not been a deterrent for many is the general
refrain.

The working environment created and policies have had their effect on
manpower turnover and also in recruitment. According to Latimer,
"Initially, recruitment was through the medium of advertisements but
today it has shifted to word-of-mouth and referrals. All the propaganda
is done by the paging operators themselves." And this Latimer attributes
to the excellent atmosphere created within the company.

No doubt, the companies have had to spend in order to create the
"comfort zone". But it is a cost that has been factored in at the time
of budgeting for infrastructure. However, none of them is willing to
reveal just what percentage it took up of the entire investment. One
reason for this advance planning could be that all the service providers
have joint ventures going with MNC partners. These partners carry with
them their experiences in other countries.

A lot has been written and said about paging as an industry but little
has been discussed about the human face of the operations, the
occupational hazards, and how companies are taking care of their
employees. In Das' words, "As far as India goes, our vision proved
right. A strong service orientation is the right approach as hardware is
incidental to business." And human resources is inextricably linked to
this vision which is reflected across the paging industry.

"WE LOOK FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE MORE OPEN TO CHANGE"

from VOICE AND DATA (India), Vol 3, Issue 4, October 1996

What does Ericsson look for in its prospective employees. And why? How
does it develop a positive feeling among employees? Ranjit Bhatia,
general manager and chief (human resources & administration), Ericsson
Telecommunications, explains in an interview with Shyamanuja Das.

What are the qualities that you look for in a person while recruiting?
We look for people who are more flexible to change. Particularly, when
we recruit experienced people, we always look for people who are not
very rigid. But for people who will embrace change. Because that is
Ericsson culture. That is how this industry is. You have to be open to
change. You have to be in constant lookout for change. For new options.
New styles. New environments.

What is your policy on recruiting fresh graduates?

We do not go to campuses. Recruiting from campuses is good. But it is
time consuming. The average time is eight months. Who has got that kind
of time in this industry? Last year, when we recruited in bulk, we
advertised for fresh candidates.

How important is the label of a college/university?

Depends on the nature of job. I can go for an IIT graduate, if I am
recruiting someone for a planning kind of job. For a hands-on job, we
prefer graduates from other engineering colleges.

What about marketing and other such functions?

Almost for all marketing positions, we recruit engineers. And that too,
only electronics and telecommunication engineers. The concept of
marketing is slightly different in this industry. We are not selling
consumer products. We are selling solutions to operators. That requires
not only an understanding of technology, but also knowledge of what can
be offered to the customer as a solution. It is more of business
development than marketing. We cannot afford to take a non-engineer.
Only for publicity etc., we take MBAs.

Where do you get middle level people from?

Engineers from PSUs, C-DOT, etc. have joined us. For marketing, we
develop our own people. There is no other way out. They are given
responsibility at a quite young age. Our average age in marketing is
28-30 years.

What are the problems you face, if at all, while recruiting?

Getting good field support staff is a problem. Very few people have the
customer orientation that this kind of job demands.

How do you manage to get good people in an extremely competitive
recruitment market?

Let me clarify on one point. We pay well. (But) we are not the best
paymasters. We do not try to be. Our objective is to be a very good
employer. We look at providing all comforts to an employee. We encourage
decision making. Above all, he is respected as an individual.

We conduct training programmes for the employee's overall growth. We are
now carrying out a continuous training programme as a project, with
active participation from our Sweden office. It is called Competence
Management and it aims to help an employee develop business competence,
technical competence, and human values. We also send them abroad for
technical trainings.

With a certain degree of pride, I can say that there has been negligible
employee turnover in Ericsson in recent months.

In general, what are the positive and negative factors in the
recruitment scenario in India?

One thing good about India is the availability of people, not necessarily
skilled, but who can be trained. The basic education is good in India.
In software, we have got skilled people.

On the flip side, people here are very low on accountability and
customer orientation. Accountability can only be built into the system
if we put thrust on it in our educational system, itself. Now, one way
of doing that is better co-operation between the campus and corporate.

In a market-driven world, that is a necessity. Then, we won't keep on
training our youngsters on something in the campus and something else in
the job. There will be no duplication of efforts.

HOW HCL GROUP RECRUIT ITS PEOPLE

from VOICE AND DATA (India), Vol 3, Issue 4, October 1996

"We do not recruit for individual companies because we want to ensure
movability within the group."

How does HCL Corp., known for its high people-orientation, recruit its
people? Sujit Baksi, the company's director & president, HRD, tells
Shyamanuja Das.

What is the basic recruitment principle of HCL Corp.?

We believe in recruiting freshers and developing them. We recruit
globally. In Singapore, Thailand, UK, US, and of course India. We take
engineers and MBAs from premier engineering and management institutes
and colleges.

How common or different are your recruitment procedures for different
group companies?

We do not recruit for HCL-HP or HCL Comnet. We recruit for HCL Corp.
Basic skill requirements for a marketing person or a technical support
person is similar in all the companies, barring a few R&D jobs. So a
fresher is taken for HCL Corp. We do that because we want to ensure a
high degree of movability within the group. Our recruitment, hence, is
function-oriented, not company oriented.

Why at all is there a need for that?

IT is a very flexible industry. Only thing that is constant here is
change. Tomorrow, we may enter some new business, exit from something
else. The person must be ready to handle different jobs, different
situations.

How do you find such people?

We look for some basic attitudes. A logical and analytical bent of mind
is a necessity. And we look for persons with high tolerance for
ambiguity. The person must be adaptive. He should be able to adapt to
changes. To new jobs. To new people. To new countries. Also, we look for
people who have motivation to achieve. This is in addition to the
specific skills required for the job and academics. We give a lot of
importance to academics. We believe academic records say a lot about the
student.

What is a typical recruitment process in HCL Corp.?

As I told you earlier, we take only freshers. We go to institutes like
IIMs, FMS, and Bajaj among management institutes. For engineering
graduates, we go to IITs, BITS, and selected RECs.

The entire process takes about one year. In fact, for our July '97
recruitment, we have already started in June last. We organize meets
with students where our top management goes and talks about the company
and the kind of opportunities that lie. Shiv Nadar himself has gone and
spoken. This year, we are planning to start this exercise in October.
Ex-students of these schools also go to campuses.

Once a student is selected, he is treated as an employee of the company.
From getting a B'day card to receiving information regarding the
activities of the company, he is made to feel as a member of the HCL
family. We also organize periodical visits of these students to company.

What are the problems you face?

Of course, sometimes there are certain mind blocks. HCL is perceived to
be a hardware company, though that is far from truth. We are second only
to TCS in software. And those who want a cushy kind of job, we cannot
provide. Right from day one, you have to be hands-on. Another fear that
is there is HCL is a very task-oriented company, which is a fact. So one
wanting a secure, slow job is not a typical HCL fit-in.

In spite of best of your efforts, there must be some people who will
fail to deliver...

They will have to go. No matter how thorough is the selection procedure,
there will always be some people who will be like that. That number is
very small in HCL. (But) they have no place. We cannot carry passengers.

It is perceived that some group companies like NIIT and HCL Comnet are
more employee-friendly than others like HCL Frontline and even HCL-HP...

I don't agree. There is a common policy. If someone has tried something
successfully in one of the companies, we implement that in other
companies. (So) there is no scope for any discrepancy. For finding out
what is best in each company we regularly conduct meetings called BIG
(Best In Group), where the chiefs of companies meet and discuss what
they have tried.

There is a belief that there is a mad rush towards telecom from all
other fields. And the biggest loser is IT. What is your observation.

What does this mean for HCL?

I agree that IT is losing a lot of skilled manpower to telecom. But for
a group like HCL, where there is enough scope to work in the latter, I
do not think that is a major problem. Our employee turnover has been
very low.(But) at the same time, I must admit that a few of them have
left and joined some MNCs.

COMMUNICATION CAREER - A COMPELLING ISSUE

from VOICE AND DATA (India), Vol 3, Issue 4, October 1996

WE Indians believe that we have one of the best technical manpower in
the world. Quite rightly too. Various surveys and studies have
reaffirmed this fact from time to time, the latest being the World
Economic Forum (WEF) Report On Global Competitiveness. India ranks among
the top three nations in the world in terms of availability and quality
of engineers.

Yet, finding right people still remains the toughest job for the
corporates--multinationals and Indian companies alike. And vice versa.
Unemployment is not a problem anymore, at least, for professional
degree/diploma holders. Misemployment is. Unless that is checked, it has
the potential to have a negative effect on the workforce in particular
and the growth of Indian business in general.

Let us define misemployment. In short, it is the wrong employer-employee
association. With higher level of professional knowledge and better
skillset, the expected level of satisfaction from one's job has gone up
tremendously. So has the employer's expectation from the employee. For
the best results, a perfect sync between attitudes of the employee and
the employer is a must. If there is a mismatch, there is bound to be
problem. That qualifies for a misemployment.

If the employers and employee do not choose each other carefully before
their association, it backfires. While employers have large HRD
departments doing the job, very few employees do that. As a result,
there is dissatisfaction that results in frequent job changes, stress,
and a fall in productivity level. The sole culprit is information. Or
rather, the lack of it.

The turnover and the product profile of a company are not the best
information to act on for making a career move into a company. One need
to know about the culture of a company, what are the qualities that the
company looks for, and what kind of a person will fit well into that
organization, before taking any decision on joining it.

These are the kind of information that we will provide you in this new
section COMCAREERS. The HRD chiefs of companies will directly tell you
what their companies look for and who is the right kind of person, and
what is expected of him. From time to time, we will throw light on areas
in which there are information gaps. This time, we have interviews with
HRD chiefs of two different types of companies. One is a fully Indian
transnational, HCL Corp.; other is a typical joint venture between an
European and an Indian company, Ericsson Telecommunications Ltd. The
size, the working culture, the strengths, all are different. Plus, there
is a feature on paging operators that tries to remove many
misconceptions.

Feel free to write to us if you want to read about any particular issue
regarding recruitment, training, and other related areas.

SAYING IT THROUGH NUMBERS

from VOICE AND DATA (India), Vol 3, Issue 4, October 1996

On the silver screen, the Hollywood hero uses his code, ILU, ILU. On the
LCD screen of your spouse's pager, you can use your own code. And that
could be a number.

That is exactly what the Chinese are doing. Many Chinese use a numeric
pager because it is cheap and numeric paging is easy to automate. So for
saying I Love You, it could be 111. For I love you too, it could be 222,
and so on. But how to remember so many codes? They have got a little
cute book of codes, known popularly as Bible Of Paging, where these
codes are listed. There are so many of them. The book is distributed by
the paging operators.

In India, some companies are already talking of that. So the next time
you want to say something, you perhaps will have the option of saying it
through numbers. But we have to evolve our own code. The Chinese code
for You are the nicest person I know could well be 420.

TEST AND INVEST: Unearthing of the telecom scam has led to scrips falling
at much more faster rate than other industries

from VOICE AND DATA (India), Vol 3, Issue 4, October 1996

The telecom scam has delivered a body blow to the liberalization
process. The telecom scrips that were considered to be favourites have
no demand in the exchanges. The result is a continuous fall in the
prices. Telecom scrips have been falling at much more faster rate than
other industries. The small investor has lost confidence, which will
take time to build up.

After the presentation of union budget by the finance minister, the
market has been gradually sliding downwards. The downslide of the equity
shares is far more than what is reflected in the sensex. Scrips of new
companies which have entered the capital market recently either do not
find there quotations or most of them get traded in the range of Rs 1 or
2 in a day. Even their volumes are not exceeding 100-200 shares. The
budget has proved out to be disastrous for the stock market.

Introduction of Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT) has deeply shaken the
confidence of investors. Stock market analysts are predicting that it
may take, almost, an year for the sentiments to improve.

The debt market has improved considerably and the institutions like
ICICI, IDBI, IFCI, and SCICI have already mobilized around Rs 6,000
crore and thus the money has been squeezed from the investor by the debt
instruments. There is no money left for the equity
instruments. Meanwhile, the deposit rate war between the non-banking
finance companies have intensified. Companies have started offering up
to 18 percent interest. While PAL Credit & Capital has announced its
interest rates of 17.5 percent for one year and 19 percent for four to
five years, Reliance Capital's rates are 15 percent and 18 percent,
respectively, for one and three years.

The BSE Sensex fell by 2 percent as it closed at 3,349.30 points on 20
September. Out of the total 58 shares listed, 48 went down, sensex 7
moved up, and three closed with no change. Datacom segment was the worst
affected as shares went down by 55 percent. Datapro went down by 90
percent and ICNET by 55 percent. Telephone cables is the worst
performing stock in telecom industry and is ranked fourth in list of top
5 losers in all companies listed in the exchanges. The share is quoting
at Rs 9 as against Rs 69 six months back.

The controversy over the VSNL's Euro issue has taken a new turn as the
Ministry of Telecommunication is suspecting a foul play in the
appointment of lead managers to the issue. The lead managers to the
issue are currently Kleinwort Benson, Jardine Flemming, and Salomon
Brothers and the company hopes to raise $700 through the issue. The
ministry suspects that more underwriting commission has been agreed in
case of VSNL. The controversy has certainly reversed the sentiments of
the investors.

Meanwhile, the board of directors of VSNL has proposed a 45 percent
dividend for 1995-96. The company has emerged amongst the top 10
tax-paying corporates in the country. It paid Rs 369.31 crore as
corporate tax.

A select few heavy-weighted scrips rallied smartly in a mixed pattern of
trading on the BSE. In general, the trend was downwards. Investors are
concentrating more on the debt market, resulting in brokers also
shifting their focus to the same.

BSE's decision to revamp the sensex has been hailed by the marketmen.
The inclusion of public sector stocks and giving weightage to new
sectors of the economy is the step in the right direction. The sensex
now will give the true picture of economy. The old sensex represented 19
percent of the market capitalization. A total of 15 new scrips have
replaced the old ones.

The Primary market in August was again deluge with a number of small
offers. The total mobilization through public offers during the month
fell to Rs 363 crore in August 1996 as against Rs 1,675 crore in July
and Rs 675 crore in May. However, the number of offers continued to be
high with as many as 87 companies tapping the market in August, 99 in
July, and 127 in June. Premium offers continued to remain out of sight
in August too. Only 11 out of the 87 offered were at the premium, with
the only Apcotex (Rs 105) and Super Auto (Rs 70) in high premium.

One of the major factors which supported the fall of the market is
SEBI's directive to extend the mark-to-market margin system to the
non-computerized stock exchanges. Because of this, the volumes declined
last month by 46 percent over the previous month.

As several companies are announcing book closures, the supply of the
stocks in the market will be reduced. Some stocks because of the
manipulation might increase for the shorter time frame. One should
carefully examine these stocks and avoid investments in these.

GLOBE WATCH: THE SEVEN COMMANDMENTS FOR TELECOM REFORMS

from VOICE AND DATA (India), Vol 3, Issue 4, October 1996

His name is Reed Hundt. He almost decides what the AT&Ts, Sprints, US
Wests, and Bell Atlantics should do in the next few years.

Sometimes, he also auctions air waves. For a change, he is now preaching
what other nations should do. Given below are his seven commandments.

I. Privatization does not conflict with or substitute for the rules of
competition.

II. Any nation that champions a national telecom firm and limits foreign
investment is wasting its money and turning down a big opportunity.

III. When governments intervene in markets in the name of guaranteeing
universal service, they generally do not make anything universal and
they do not enhance telecom service.

IV. Every country does not need two redundant wireline networks.

V. If you are not awarding spectrum licences by auction, you are making
a big mistake.

VI. After you auction the licences, let the market work. Systems rivalry
will speed technological innovation and countries should not bar
desegregation or combination of spectrum licences.

VII. The right goal for international communications is the same as the
goal for domestic communications--no more regulation of communications
services than of soap or software or shoes.

GLOBE WATCH: ARGENTINA ACHIEVES TWENTY PERCENT PHONE PENETRATION

from VOICE AND DATA (India), Vol 3, Issue 4, October 1996

Argentina's Telefonica de Argentina claims to have achieved a phone
density index of 20 working lines for every one hundred inhabitants.
Telefonica took office in November 1990 and the phone density, then, was
12 lines for every one hundred inhabitants. Within six years, the index
has risen by 66.67 percent. The telecom company feels that such a growth
has been primarily due to heavy investment in telecom infrastructure
during the period. It was around $4.5 billion.

Deutsche Telekom, the German telco, in its privatization efforts wants
to sell some of its shares to smaller private investors and FIs.

Investors may be wooed with discounts and loyalty shares offer on
purchase of at least 300 shares in the former state telco. Prospectus on
the sale is likely to be issued soon. Reports indicate the sell-off
would be the largest ever privatization in Germany and one of Europe's

too had announced shedding of STET shares, in three stages, to allow
private investors to part-pay their shares in several stages.

SMALL IS BEAUTIFUL

from VOICE AND DATA (India), Vol 3, Issue 4, October 1996

A strategy, based on market segmentation, is essential to focus in an
evolving market.

When Nobel-laureate EF Schumacher wrote Small Is Beautiful (As If People
Mattered), cellular was certainly not in his mind. But the cellular
operators are fast realizing that small is indeed beautiful. Perhaps
much more beautiful than Schumacher imagined.

When cellular licences were being awarded, there was so much glamour and
clamour for the Mumbai licence. Most aggressive forecasts, bids, and
what not! Some even thought the rest was a waste. Today, Delhi has the
lead. Whether it is maximum number of cars or cell-phones, it is the same
success story of small entrepreneurs behind them.

Recently, we were on a search for a small office building ... there were
brokers and brokers but with a common factor ... all had a cell-phone,
in fact some had two, one from each of the two operators ... just in
case! When we looked for furniture ... again the same common factor. A
conspicuous cell-phone. The common factor stretches beyond ... our
lawyer carries one, our CA carries one, our freight agent carries one.

No wonder it is the small wonder!

But for now, we leave aside the small wonder called cellphone ... and
talk about the success story of the small business. Small business has
come to mean big business to cellular operators. Not only world-wide,
but in India too!

Delhi is obviously the trend setter in India. Today, travelling in a
Bombay suburban train if one sees a combination of "chappals" and
"cell-phone", one cannot afford to scoff.

The Innovators

Most operators tend to launch with testimonial ads. Focus: Corporate Big
Wigs! No doubt almost all CEOs become the first subscribers though I
know several dogged exceptions. But where do the real numbers, usage,
and revenue come from? It is from the humble pockets of small businesses
with employees less than 10 sometimes; we include the self-employed too.

In the first year of service, over 95 percent of the revenue may come
from this segment. For cellular, small is big. Big market. It may take
sometime for cellphones to travel down the corporate echelons.

In the "consumer" segment, it takes two to three years to reach
"significant" level of penetration and airtime usage. We know, most
people prefer to charge to official account. Consumer segment will
mostly comprise of housewives, college going youngsters, and old people.
Majority go for it as "status symbol" or "snob value" and sometimes for
"security" reasons, mostly with very low airtime usage.

The Global Scenario

Today, small businesses and corporate segments account for about 70
percent of world cellular market and the consumer segment less than 30
percent. In some "not so highly dense" markets with about 10-12 percent
(still quite big for us) penetration, small businesses have been seen to
reach a cellular penetration of about 50 percent. While in "highly
dense" market like Sweden with 30 percent cellular penetration, small
businesses (less than 15 employees) have 85 percent penetration. Need we
say more?

The Cellular Way To Business

Cellular changes the way to business for a small businessman as he
learns to manage his time better--the cellular way. With a cellphone he
virtually carries his office around. Office and telephone do not tie him
down anymore. He could devote more time with his clients and in
travelling. For operator, it requires a customized concept selling to
address and target each of sub-segments based on the pattern of daily
activities which may differ for exporters, doctors, CAs, lawyers, estate
agents, freight agents, courier services, contractors, etc. It may
include specialized promotion for specific professions highlighting how
the service can help in improving efficiency and business. In Delhi, I
am told that almost 100 custom-agents subscribed to service en masse,
even the same model of handset.

Today, traveling in a Bombay suburban train if one sees a combination of
"chappals" and "cell-phone", one cannot afford to scoff. It is not just
the basic unit of economic fabric but also the "big" star of cellular
world. Schumacher wrote, "There is wisdom in the smallness if only on
account of the smallness and patchiness of human knowledge... It is more
important that everybody should produce something than that a few people
should each produce a great deal... The task is to bring into existence
millions of new work places in the rural areas and small towns."
"Cellular will play a leading role in this task in India," Mr
Schumacher, "we assure you."

NEPOSTEL CONSULTANCY BV - CASHING IN ON TRAINING

from VOICE AND DATA (India), Vol 3, Issue 4, October 1996

With lot of private telecom operators starting their operations, the
company is eyeing a huge business opportunity. Reason enough for it
being in serious business.

Nepostel is the member of the KPN Group (Royal PTT Nederland NV). And,
it was founded in 1981 to offer Telecom and Postal Training and
Consultant Services to telecom and postal operators and service
providers using the expertise of PTT Telecom and PTT Post.

PTT Telecom, the Netherlands, is one of the most productive telecom
companies in the competitive market of Europe. Since its foundation,
Nepostel has worked in more than 50 countries in former Eastern Europe,
Asia, Africa, and Latin America. The turnover of the company expressed
in Indian currency was Rs 56 crore in 1995, which is 10 percent more
than that in 1994.

Nepostel's relation with Indian customers dates back to 1991 when two
telecom managers attended a course--Management of Operations and
Maintenance of Modern Telecom Networks in the Netherlands. Since then,
Nepostel has formed a joint venture company called Orange Telecom
Software with TCIL for the development of telecom software locally,
which caters to the European market. Billing software and other customer
care software for the private telecom network operators seem to be the
major areas of operation for Orange Telecom Software.

Nepostel has also been instrumental in providing back-up consultancy for
a Videotex project in Delhi. It has provided training and consultant
services to Sterling Cellular and HFCL. Around 13 network engineers of
HFCL were trained by Nepostel in the Netherlands last year. The company
is the foreign collaborator in Beltron Telecommunications Ltd, a paging
operator with licences in six cities.

Nepostel's services have been delivered up till now through its
headquarters in the Hague. Currently, Nepostel is in the process of
setting up shop in India together with its partner, Svana Systems (P)
Ltd, in New Delhi. This joint venture company called Nepostel India Pvt
Ltd will be operational soon. It has been registered but is in a wait
for formal government approval. According to the company sources,
Nepostel India Pvt Ltd is expected to be launched by 15 October 1996.

Svana Systems, a small time telecom software developer itself, will now
be involved in project execution and marketing of all the ventures of
Nepostel in the country. "Project execution, not product development, is
and will remain our forte," says Shugan C Jain of Svana Systems. "There
is a lot of technical expertise available in the country, but managing
them together and bring business out of it is not an easy job. It
requires expert consultancy and thus justifies our existence," adds Jan
Joosten, senior consultant (training and organization), Nepostel.

Nepostel is an expert organization in feasibility studies, network
designs, consultancy for bid evaluation in a telecom tender, buying
decisions for network equipment, etc.

Till the time this venture comes into picture, Nepostel has already
started to deliver its services through Svana Systems. "In the near
future, we are planning to bring the best of training facilities in
India itself, rather than taking the Indian engineers to the
Netherlands," says Jain.

The first tangible result of this co-operation is a series of five open
courses for executives and managers of various telecom operators.
Nepostel focuses on all aspects of running a telecom network
effectively, whether fixed, GSM, paging, VSAT, MRTS, or other. Dutch
experts with hands-on experience in all aspects of telecom will carry
out or back-up the services offered by the newly hired staff of the
joint venture. The main aim is to deliver the highest quality of
training and consultancy in telecom and posts based on thorough
knowledge of the telecom and postal businesses and hands-on experience
of its consultants and trainers.

USHA COMMUNICATION - THE JUMBO IN MAKING

from VOICE AND DATA (India), Vol 3, Issue 4, October 1996

With the ever expanding officecom segment, Usha Communication is a
company to watch.

If you think foresight is the key to success of any business, it is true
of Usha Communication. "As a corporate, we think eight years in
advance," says Jai Dhar Gupta, managing director, Usha Electronics. This
Delhi-based company was established way back in 1968, with a product
focus of manufacturing telephones, intercoms, and small analogue
switches.

Right now, the company is into the manufacturing of state-of-the-art
ISBX systems. For this, it has entered into an alliance with Tadiran
Telecommunications, Israel, to manufacture and market its Coral brand of
ISBX, a technically advanced EPABX system. This Coral Automatic Call
Distribution (ACD) helps users by evenly distributing incoming calls,
and keeping track of calling patterns and performances. Manufacturing
these locally will give the company a tremendous cost advantage. The
other products are Coral Computer Telephony Interface (CTI), Coral AIR
(Wireless EPABX), and Coral ISDN PABX. The Coral ISDN PABX provides wide
bandwidth for voice, data networking, and videoconferencing. These ISDN
exchanges are fourth generation PBXes that will support voice, data,
video, wireless facilities, cellular facilities, voice mail as well as
ISDN and VSAT connectivity. The Coral AIR handset is like a wireless
extension.

The company has also entered an alliance with Cosmopolitan Electronics
of Taiwan for smaller PBXes with a capacity to handle 240 lines at a
time. The most modern thing about this is that this has a single pair
wire and also a digital one.

"Now hotel and paging are the two areas where there is lot of
opportunity," comments Gupta. And, that is why the company is targeting
these industries. Till date, Punwire is its major client. Usha
Electronics has installed EPABXes both for its POCSAG and FM RDS paging
services. And, very recently, the company has bagged its first order
from the hotel industry, i.e. Hotel Bright Star, which is coming up in
Delhi. It has also installed ISBX systems at Western Pagers and bagged
orders from Jindal and Oswal Group.

Among Public Sector Units, Indian Railway is their major client.
Everyday, 16-17 voice conferences take place between different offices
of the railways and Usha has to provide adequate facilities for this on
leased line voice conference. Apart from these areas, the company is
also trying to enter areas like banking and telecom. Other prospective
customers are from the banking and financial sectors, PSUs, and courier
industry. "We are looking forward for at least 20,000 connections,"
says Gupta. The company has already set up five EPABXes so far, and
expects to set up 18 more in near future.

"Customer satisfaction is our main look out," comes out Gupta. To ensure
this commitment, the company has a chain of 60 dealers, 10 branch
offices, agents located in almost all big and small cities across the
country. It also plans to open sales offices in the African and South
Asian regions. And, a team from Tadiran are in Delhi and Mumbai to sell
its products.

Usha Electronics' manufacturing unit at Okhla Industrial Area in New
Delhi has already into production. Very recently, the company has set up
its second unit at Bari Brahma near Jammu, complying with ISO 9001
standards, to manufacture and assemble digital ISDN customer premises
equipment for the Indian market. This will be the first of its kind in
the country to manufacture Integrated Services Business Exchanges
(ISBXes).

Gupta agrees with Voice & Data's prediction and says that communication
software is where future lies and his company will also move into
software development. According to him, his company will move into
computer telephony as they will have a market in 50 countries and also
sees the growth of networking market in India. With an expected turnover
of Rs 20 crore for the current fiscal, against Rs 9 crore in 1995-96,
Usha Communication is poised to find a new helm in the Indian
communications industry.

VSNL - THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS GATEWAY

from VOICE AND DATA (India), Vol 3, Issue 4, October 1996

Long-term focus and better project executions place VSNL in the numero
uno spot.

Instability of world grandeur is not concurrent with Videsh Sanchar
Nigam Ltd (VSNL), the exclusive provider of public international telecom
services in India. Its is a steady journey of success and innovation
throughout.

And, for the government too, it is a preferred entity over MTNL. This is
obvious from the government's keen interest in keeping its stake high,
even after the expected GDR issue--66 percent. In the case of MTNL, the
government's stake is already down to 65 percent.

Now a bit history. The origin of India's external telecommunication is
actually dated back to as early as 1870 with the formation of British
India Submarine Telegraph Company. In 1872, Eastern Telegraph Company
(ETC) was formed. Fifty-one years down the lane, in 1923, another
company--Indian Radio Telegraph Company (IRT)--was formed.

Circa 1932. And, ETC and IRT merged into one--Indian Radio & Cable
Communications Company (IRCC). With Independence, IRCC was nationalized
and rechristened to Overseas Communications Service (OCS) in 1947.
March 1986 saw the conversion of OCS into an autonomous business
unit--VSNL--to improve operating performance.

In 1992, the government reduced equity holding to 82 percent and
increased private ownership to 18 percent. The expected GDR issue will
increase the private ownership to above 34 percent, still retaining the
government control. However, at the time of this article going to print,
the government has announced a disinvestment of another 7 percent of
VSNL's equity.

Services

As a service company, VSNL's area of operation is spread into basic
services and specialized services. And, it generates 95 percent of its
revenues from the international long distance services. The second
largest revenue earner is leased channels which contribute only 1.6
percent to the total revenue.

Under the umbrella name basic services, it has telephone services to 237
ISD destinations; telex services to 238 IXSD destinations; and telegraph
to 33 destinations.

Going by the specialized services, VSNL is into TV (programme
transmission), videoconferencing (home country direct), and
multi-address press broadcast (time and frequency transmission). Also,
it offers leased channels services such as bureaufax, T-Fax, Intelsat
business service, and Inmarsat mobile services. Its specialized services
also include Gateway Packet Data Search Transmission, Electronic Data
Interchange (EDI), On-line Data "Easynet", and E-mail (Gems 400) through
its Internet backbone.

VSNL's international gateways are two-fold. One, satellite earth
stations and two, sub-marine telephone links. The former has stations in
Arvi, Bangalore, Calcutta, Dehradun, Madras, Mumbai, and New Delhi.

In sub-marine telephone cable links, it has both wide-band sub-marine
cable analogue and digital systems. Under the wide-band sub-marine cable
analogue system, it has two gateways--Madras for IOCOM Cable to Penang
in Malaysia and Mumbai for Gulf Cable to Fujairah in UAE, with a length
of 2,509 km and 1,964 km, respectively. The digital system--SEA ME WE
2--has a length of 17,658 km, having covering points in countries such
as Algeria, Djibouti, Egypt, France, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, Singapore,
and Sri Lanka. Mumbai is the gateway for this service. This facility was
commissioned in June 1994. The total cost involved in this was Rs 2,204
crore. As on 30 April 196, VSNL had 2,814 circuits in this service.

Coming to the mobile communication services, VSNL deals in voice, data,
and fax for the marine, air line, and land mobile communities. Its
Inmarsat mobile satellite communication services is the focal point of
all these operations.

International Association

VSNL's association with international bodies like Intelsat and Inmarsat
has enhanced its image in India and abroad, alike. It is a founder
member of Inmarsat, an organization dealing with mobile communications,
with other 77 countries, having a share of 1.48 percent in the
consortium. Similarly, in Intelsat, a set-up of 138 countries for
satellite services, too, VSNL could forge in 2.12 percent share for
India. And, in Intelsat and Inmarsat consortia, VSNL is, respectively,
the tenth and eighth largest operator in the world. It also has
participation in the international joint venture ICO Global
Communications to provide global satellite private communication
services. Through VSNL, India has put in an investment of 7.38 percent
of the total project cost.

The company's association with Commonwealth Telecom Organization (CTO),
Asia Pacific Telecommunity (APT), and International Telecommunications
Union (ITU) gives it an unequivocal edge. It actively participates in
the events conducted by these bodies.

It has MoUs with BT-MCI for Concert Packet Switched Services, Tele Media
International for the introduction of Universal Connect, Sprint
International, and Cable & Wireless to enhance globally managed network
and data services. Further, VSNL's success in bidding for the location
for ICO Global Satellite System's satellite access nodes gives a boost
to its international image.

By introducing Internet services on a commercial basis, VSNL has
registered a customer base of over 8,000 subscribers. It is planning to
offer companies, facilities to host home pages on the VSNL Web servers.

It is expected to further facilitate Internet usage in the country. This
service may also see tariff reduction.

The company is looking forward to participate in two sub-marine fibre
cable projects: FLAG and SEA-ME-WE-3. It also plans for laying down a
high-capacity under sea cable, linking the neighbouring countries and
providing them connectivity with other international sub-marine systems.

In the Iridium global personal satellite communications project too,
VSNL is also to participate. And, it has set up the Iridium gateway in
Pune, at a cost of Rs 50 crore. However, this will not affect its
participation in Intelsat and Inmarsat consortia.

VSNL has got into the value-added services too. With Telstra, it has
formed a joint venture--Telstra V-Comm--to provide DAMA VSAT services.
Also it found a partner in Elnet, Madras, to provide domestic E-mail
services.

VSNL is, no doubt, an unchallenged entity in the international
telecommunications services at least until the year 2004. In a reformed
era too, it is a protected monopoly. However, this status does not stop
VSNL from aiming high. Quite unusual to many Indian PSUs, VSNL has a
corporate vision and it foresees changes and tries to manage such
changes well in time. It is being reiterated by its turnover of Rs 4,417
crore for 1995-96 registering 22.46 percent growth over the previous
year. Recently, the VSNL board has proposed a dividend of 45 percent.

Its present stature is mainly due to its visions and foresight than a
monopoly entity. Thanks are due to BK Syngal, the present CMD, for his
foresight and leadership. He has proven for VSNL and many PSU heads a
role model. Recently, when I met one of his senior colleagues, that
person had all praises for the CMD, quite strange in a PSU set-up.

However, this synergy could have been put to a stumbling block if he was
not given an extension. Now, Syngal will be in the driver's seat for two
more years as the government has given him an extension, recently. It
is, no doubt an acknowledgement to his contribution.

VSNL has scored in man power management too. When job attrition is a
common feature across the IT and communication industries, more so with
the arrival of MNCs. According to Amitabh Kumar, director (operations),
VSNL, through better pay packages and welfare schemes, his company could
keep its forte safely. It experienced very little man power turnover
unlike many government/autonomous entity.

Aiming high is VSNL's all time agenda. So are its strategies. VSNL is
determined to live beyond the present expectation. And, for this, Syngal
and his men are in the forefront with all good project arsenals.

RURAL TELECOM - A CHALLENGING TASK AHEAD

from VOICE AND DATA (India), Vol 3, Issue 4, October 1996

Modern technologies and streamlined policies can ensure better telecom
links to rural India.

The present rural telecommunication scenario reminds me of the story of
the elephant and seven blind men. Every one views the rural
telecommunication market differently depending on which angle he is
looking at it from. Going by the sheer size of the rural population,
there should be a very sizeable demand for telephones in the rural
areas. However, as one looks at the economic conditions in these areas
and the average spending power of the population, the demand appears to
be very low. The remoteness and the geographical spread of these areas
make planning of communications a very challenging and complex task.

Modern technologies provide many solutions for the communication
requirements of the rural sector but the costs involved coupled with the
low expected returns are daunting indeed.

Some of the solutions like Wireless In Local Loop (WILL) are being
projected as the panacea for the rural telecommunications problem but
one would need an indepth study to decide whether these are economically
viable for areas with such low population density and whether it will be
possible to support these sophisticated technologies in such remote
areas unless our own people in these areas are trained to maintain these
systems after the installation teams have done their jobs and gone back
to the comforts of their highly developed countries. It is most unlikely
that even our own trained engineers/technicians will choose to serve in
the rural areas.

The government, on its part, has taken the easy way out by laying down
that the private basic service providers will have to install 10 percent
of their total capacity in the rural areas. It has also specified that
wires will not be used in the network. The basic service providers who
are, as it is, struggling hard to cope with other problems like
financing and inter-connect agreement are desperately trying to work out
how they can make their ventures profitable. Many of them are hoping
that sooner or later the government will dilute this requirement.

It is not that no one has been able to see the rural telecommunication
sector in its correct prospective. At least for the past four years or
so, a number of enlightened experts have been debating on the issues and
the complexities related to the rural telecommunication requirements.
But what is being done falls well short of the requirement.

Rural Areas: Some Basic Facts

There appears to be no formal definition of a rural area. However, BS
Murthy in his book "A Phone In Every Village" published by TRC,
Government of India, November 1987, defines the rural area as an area
where the population is less than 5,000 with a population density less
than 400 person per sq. km and with less than 75 percent of the male
population employed in the non-agricultural sector. The average
population of a village is about 1,200 and typical distances between
villages range from 3 to 10 km. A typical household in a developing
country has four to five members. Generally, a household can afford to
spend only 5 percent of its annual income on a telephone. Going by the
current rentals of telephones, this means that if a household has a
telephone and pays only the rental of Rs 2,280 per annum, it must have
an annual income of Rs 45,600. The government has a target of providing
one public telephone for every 500 people.

There are about 6.3 lakh villages in the country. Of this, only 2.16
lakh have a Village Public Telephone (VPT). There are, however, 20 lakh
telephones in the rural sector which has a population of roughly 70
crore. Thus, in the rural sector, the average number of phones is 0.3
percent against the national average of 1.2 percent of the population.

As against this, the average in the sub-urban and urban sector is 6
percent which is 20 times higher. This disparity certainly needs to be
minimized if we have to work towards achieving economic development of
our backward and rural areas. There is an outstanding requirement of
nearly 4.14 lakh VPTs. The government has plans to provide a VPT in
every village by 1997. However, its annual target for the year 1996-97
is only 75,000. It appears that the objective will not be achieved for
the next four to five years. It will take even longer to meet the target
of one public telephone for every 500 people which even by current
statistics comes to nearly 15 lakh telephones. The burden of providing
these will, therefore, shift to the private operators. They will not
find it economical to provide one in each village.

Unless cost-effective solutions are found for meeting these
requirements, it will not be financially viable for any company or even
the government to establish the requisite infrastructure.

Technology Perspective

The government is looking at a number of technological solutions to the
requirement of communications in the rural sector. Use of VSATs,
microwave equipment, ultra high frequency radio links, WILL, and
multi-access radio are some of the approaches presently being adopted.

Indeed an appropriate mix of these approaches based on the peculiarities
of the terrain and the demographics of the areas will have to be
employed to find the right solution. This is easier said than done
because of the economics of each of these technologies.

The critical factors that need to be considered while planning a network
for the rural sector are:

* Existing network architecture
* Subscriber density
* Equipment costs
* Ease of installation and use
* Power supply requirement
* Reliability, maintenance, and repair
* Growth capability of the network
* Frequency management.

As brought out earlier, subscriber density in rural areas is expected to
be low. Since the population density is less than 400 per sq. km and the
present average is 0.3 per 100, the expected density in these areas will
be less than 1.2 per sq. km.

As far as costs go, the average costs per line presently being taken for
planning purposes is Rs 40,000 per line. In the rural areas, however,
the cost is expected to be more. Many of the private operators are
working on costs of Rs 60,000 to Rs 1 lakh per line. Ideally, the cost
should be kept below Rs 40,000.

Low power requirement, ease of repair and maintenance with remote
diagnostics and repair capability are important considerations in a
country like India. While use of solar cells is advocated as the ideal
solution for power requirement in remote areas, the cost of these
remains prohibitively high. The planning figure is roughly Rs 3 lakh per
KVA of capital investment.

Frequency management has been a serious problem in our country. There is
an on-going debate about the critical shortage in the RF spectrum for
the existing requirement of the operators of cellular, paging, and
mobile radio trunking networks. The Defence forces have been under
pressure from various government agencies to release some of the
frequencies which they are holding but not utilizing in peace time.

However, they cannot risk doing this because they cannot be assured of
the availability of the frequencies if and when required during
hostilities. With more and more technological sophistication being
introduced in our weapons, surveillance, and communication systems, the
demand for the frequency spectrum cannot possibly decrease.

Conventional Wireline

Wireline will continue to be an alternative for the subscriber loop,
although only for short distances approaching 1 km.

Satellite Communications

Remote users who are dispersed over wide areas can be served by using
satellite technologies. Single Channel Per Carrier (SCPC), Multiple
Channel Per Carrier (MCPC), and VSAT technology, however, are often
expensive compared with terrestrial systems. A number of satellite
communication companies are working on solutions which will hopefully,
bring down the price of satellite communications to $500-1,000.

In larger rural communities that are far removed from major switching
centres, satellite links are effective in providing trunk circuit to
individual smaller rural switching exchanges, rather than individual
subscriber loops. A terrestrial wireless local loop system can be
integrated with low capacity satellite system, providing a
cost-effective solution.

Point To Multipoint Terrestrial Technologies

Point to Multipoint Time Division Multiple Access (PMP TDMA) is a proven
rural distribution system that finds optimum use for serving clusters of
rural subscribers, using wireless for the local loop. New features,
frequency bands, and capacities are continually being developed, with
each system optimized for specific rural needs.

Low capacity analog systems have been available for many years. Analog
multi-access systems are used primarily in isolated low capacity
applications, typically serving up to 50 subscribers from individual
radio base stations. In India, a 2/15 MAAR system, at present, costs
approximately Rs 80,000 per channel. Digital system when introduced will
cost even more though they would provide higher quality telephone
service.

Fixed Cellular And Digital Enhanced Cordless Telephony

A number of companies are offering solutions based on fixed GSM, CDMA,
and Digital Enhanced Cordless Telephony (DECT) technologies. Trials are
being conducted by Qualcomm on CDMA in India. IIT Madras has developed a
DECT technology which promises to be cost effective though costs are not
indicated as yet. DoT has signed an MoU with National Semi Conductors of
USA for a DECT technology which it predicts will cost only Rs 500-10,000
per line. However, the subscriber density for which these costs are
applicable is not known. Thus, it would be seen that while a number of
technologies are in the offing the economics are not being clearly
projected. Hopefully, the prices will come down once the volumes are
taken into consideration and once the multinationals realize that India
may soon find its own solutions.

Need For Adopting A Pragmatic Approach

In a seminar organized by CII in December 1992, N Vittal, the then DoT
secretary, had made some very useful and practical suggestions for
improving telecommunications in the rural sector. Since then he has
expressed his views on a number of occasions through different
platforms. Some of the suggestions made by him merit serious
consideration. The main theme underlying in all his suggestions is to
remove all kinds of artificial restrictions that are presently imposed,
i.e. * Only one additional service provider for basic services in each
circle * VSATs are not permitted to be connected to PSTN network *
Dedicated networks of major organization like Railways, Defence, NTPC,
and ONGC cannot be shared by any of the private service providers. They
can only use DoT's infrastructure * Only specified technologies approved
by DoT can be deployed by private service providers.

Each of these restrictions hampers growth of the telecommunication
infrastructure. Another suggestion which he had made in 1992 was to
channelize the black money (and there is plenty of it in the country)
into developing the rural telecommunication infrastructure.

It is very heartening to see that the present government has laid
special emphasis on developing the rural infrastructure in its Common
Minimum Programme. The allocation for the rural infrastructure in the
9th Plan has been increased from Rs 30,000 crore to Rs 60,000 crore. It
is now for the telecommunication fraternity as a whole to grab the
opportunities presented by the rural telecommunication market, taking
the long-term benefits, both for the nation and the telecommunication
business, into consideration.

Fixed cellular

Using fixed cellular instead of copper wire to connect homes and offices
has several advantages.

* Speed of installation. Subscribers can be connected immediately
when supplied with an antenna unit that connects to an ordinary telephone
* Low maintenance. The absence of wires means fewer potential problems
than are found with wire-based networks in both rural and urban environments
* Flexibility. Fixed cellular can be used as an interim measure ahead of
fixed network construction, with the radio equipment transferred to
another location once the fixed network has been established.

Maitland report

A document entitled the "Missing Link" produced in 1984 by an
international commission headed by Sir Donald Maitland lays down the UN
Policy towards telecommunications development.

In January 1995, a proposal of the 1984 Maitland Commission to create
World Tel, a specialized funding body for telecommunications development
in the world's poorest countries, was finally given the go-ahead. To
some, it represents the last chance for significant progress in this
area during for the foreseeable future. This body is now headed by Sam
Pitroda who pioneered the spread of telecommunications to the rural
areas in India.

Distorted economics

It is generally argued by most basic service providers that providing
services in rural areas is going to be a loss-making proposition for
them. However, their projections may be some what exaggerated with a
view to seek subsidies from the government. A number of factors support
this view.

* Modern technology offers cheaper alternatives to physically
wiring up every remote customer. These products are more reliable and so
require less maintenance. Maintenance costs in rural areas are lower
than those in city environments where carrying out repairs can involve
complex and disruptive work beneath busy streets. City networks are also
more likely to be damaged by other utilities while digging up the
streets
* Methods of calculating the per subscriber costs and revenue in
rural areas often disregard revenue generated by incoming calls made to
rural users.

ENHANCED SERVICES A CUT ABOVE THE REST

from VOICE AND DATA (India), Vol 3, Issue 4, October 1996

Through enhanced services, operators are trying to differentiate
themselves from their parallels.

Today, one can find more than one operator available for any kind of a
telecom service. Be it cellular, paging, or yet-to-be-privatized basic
telephony. The subscribers remaining the same, the question is who will
eat a bigger chunk of the service pie. With competition getting hotter
day-by-day, the operators of different telecom networks are striving to
prove their edge over others. Others, who are out in the arena providing
something similar. One sure way out has been providing enhanced services
or value-added services, as some prefer to call it.

To the delight of the operators, enhanced services can be integrated
smoothly, without any major changes in the installed networks.

Technically also, these support virtually all network interfaces, all
current protocols, and standards including those specific to particular
countries. Thus protecting any investments already made, which is a
major issue in any technology upgradation. And in the interest of the
common user, for whom all this translates into better connectivity and
true value for money.

Market For Enhanced Services

DoT had started the car phone service and even the paging service long
back. But it turned out be a total fiasco, as the public gave it a cold
shoulder. Not that these services were not good technically or
otherwise, as they are now, but all because of the lack of an emphatic
marketing savvy and mass awareness. DoT was, and still seems to be
oblivious of the fact that the first phase in selling anything is the
market development. And that comes through educating the customers, by
reaching them, and telling what it is. Indian Paging Service Association
(IPSA) is promoting and selling the concept of paging in a mega way. "In
fact, there are numerous enhanced services that can be provided along
with the routine paging service. But it is unnecessary to inundate the
market and confuse the customers. Educating the people should be given
the priority," says Praveen Kumar, president, IPSA. Essar Cellphone in
Delhi has come up with "Personalized Services" to attract the
subscribers. According to company officials, it is like having a
personal secretary working for you, outside your office, round the
clock. AirTel, too, hasn't lagged behind in jumping into the bandwagon.

It all started with flashing of cricket scores on pagers during the
World Cup 96. Even, AirTel had introduced a special number service to
keep the cellphone users updated with the latest in the action-packed
matches. And, when the election fever was on a high, the latest
standings were continuously being flashed by some of the paging
operators. Soon one will see the operators providing more such
information. "The sensex and forex update will take some time to be on
the air round-the-clock. But the paging operators are giving a serious
thought at providing other value-added information, for instance, stock
market briefings, airline schedules, railway time tables, etc.," feels
OP Suri, senior vice-president (operations), DSS Mobile Communications,
a Delhi-based paging operator.

"These will surely go a long way in developing the market and will, in a
way, benefit the individual operators also to lure the subscribers,"
adds he.

Roaming arrangements between the various cellular and paging operators
is also becoming quite popular. Recently, nine cellular operators, four
from metros and five from the yet-to-be operational state circles, have
come together to form "World 1 Network". This is to provide efficient
roaming between their respective territories. The cellphone user can do
with a single SIM card, without having to go for separate ones, as in
plastic roaming. "Follow Me Paging" introduced by RPG is in association
with Motorola's Hotline Paging. You can be paged locally, within the
city you are visiting. And that too, at the cost of a local call. And
surprisingly, nothing changes even your pager number remains the same.

Voicemail is just one of the enhanced services that the operators
provide these days, but it is catching on very fast as compared to other
enhancements. Not only the cellular operators but paging operators are
also in an endeavor to incorporate it into their networks. Mobilink has
become the first service to provide Voicemail facility on pagers. It is
also providing vernacular messaging in three languages--Hindi, Punjabi,
and Tamil."Interestingly, enhanced services can be introduced at a cost,
which is just 1-2 percent of the total cost required to lay a telecom
network.

Some players in the field providing these enhanced services are Boston
Technology, Brite, Centigram, Comverse, Glenyare, and Octel," says Bonny
Singh, manager (telecom), IIS Infotech. His company has been appointed
as a master distributor in India by Boston Technology Inc., a leader in
these services world-wide. The personalized services for Essar have been
integrated into their network by Comverse, Israel.

How can enhanced services change the lifestyle of an Indian on the move.
Let us take a closer look at these new offerings that are and can be
made available to the Indian users.

Virtual Telephone: In many regions around the world, the demand for
basic telephone outstrips the connections being provided. And India is
no exception to this situation. Virtual telephone, a yet-to-be exploited
service seems to be the answer. It is like having a telephone connection
at your place, without physically having an instrument. Though it is not
the panacea for all the connectivity problems.

It is an efficient tool for reaching out people living in:
areas with poor customer access network those on long waiting list for the
telephone service those in areas struck by natural disasters, causing
disruptions in the infrastructure and small businesses who need 24-hour
messaging capability.

A 7-10 digit number is assigned to the subscribers of the virtual
telephone service. This offers them access to a private and secure voice
messaging mailbox. It is just like dialing a conventional telephone. The
caller hears a greeting or a specific message, pre-recorded by the
subscriber whenever he dials into the network. Subscribers can access
the mailbox through a payphone and retrieve their messages anytime. A
key feature that can be added is the ability to provide timely
notification to the subscriber, when they have messages waiting for
retrieval. The message centre at the network can automatically alert the
subscriber via a pager, if programmed to do so.

Voice Mail Service (VMS): Based on electronic voice messaging technique,
this service is available to the users through our very own MTNL. It
provides for recording, storing, and retrieval of voice messages. The
voice is first digitized and then stored in an Electronic Voice Mail Box
(EVMB), which actually is a memory space in the disc of custom-designed
central computer of the VMS. For recording the voice messages, these
EVMBs can be accessed by anyone--whether he is a VMS customer or
not--anytime through a direct telephone (local or long distance) and
extensions of PABXes (through junction lines). For retrieval, however,
bonafide customers of VMS only can access their individual EVMBs through
the use of a secret Personal Identification Number (PIN), which can be
selected and changed by the customer at his will.

Optional facilities that are bundled with the VMS are:

- incoming calls to a number, served by an electronic exchange, can be
  transferred to any other telephone and also to any EVMB
- restricting the access to selected callers only, by giving a secret
  password to them
- choice of an EVMB number
- quick scan of beginning of all messages
- elective retrieval of all messages
- redirect messages (with or without comment) to other EVMBs
- broadcasting voice messages to several mail boxes
  closed user group.

Call Answering: With today's fast-paced work and leisure schedules,
people demand the ability to capture messages from incoming calls,
whenever they are away from their home or office. And this is surely
going to give the answering machine market a big blow. It is like a
separate answering machines for each subscriber fitted into the network.

But in real, there is no machine present physically. It is the network
which does it all. It is like your personal secretary, working
round-the-clock for you, outside your office, claim some of the cellular
operators who provide this service.

Enhanced services can be integrated smoothly, without any major changes
in the installed networks.

The subscribers are allotted an EVMB which can gather the incoming
messages when the line is busy or remains unattended for a certain
specified duration. With the touch of a button, the callers can:

- mark a message urgent (which places it into the high priority queue)
- review a message
- re-record a message
- cancel the message completely.

Once the subscriber logs into his EVMB, he can with a simple keystroke:

* listen to all messages
* listen to selected messages skipping others
* pause while listening to a message
* go back or move forward while listening to a message
* save or delete messages
* check the time and date of message deposit.

Submailbox: This allows the subscribers to create several mailboxes for
a single telephone line. Many people/ departments can share a phone line
and still enjoy the privacy of a personal EVMB.

Call Hold/Waiting: This facility lets you receive incoming calls even
when your telephone is busy. You get a short duration pip tone when you
are busy talking, indicating that another call is waiting for you. You
can talk to either of the callers, keeping the other on hold. There is
complete secrecy of communication between the two callers. In Essar's
network, the service helps the subscriber to handle three calls at the
same time, without any of them getting the engaged tone. The subscriber
has the freedom of attending calls at his own priority.

The basic telephony will soon get privatized. With the cellular and the
paging networks getting operational in state-wide circles along with
major cities, the industry will witness a burgeoning demand for these
enhanced services. By the present operators and the operators-to-be. In
a stride, to add more names to their subscriber database, and make their
services more feature-rich, what these operators will end-up doing is to
make life easier for the end-user.

GSM Networks-associated Enhanced Services:

Short Message Service:

This is a text messaging function for use in digital wireless network.

The caller composes a brief text message that is delivered to the
subscriber's properly equipped wireless handset. It can be configured to
take messages through an operator or via a voice menu. This facility
helps your cellphone to double as pager by giving you an option to send
or receive messages in a written form. Thereby, circumventing the need
of unnecessary conversation specially when the incoming calls are also
being charged.

Roaming: It is specially designed for people who frequently travel to
other cities. You can be reached anywhere, if your operator has an
arrangement with the operator of that place.

Calling Line Identification Presentation (CLIP): A characteristic of the
Intelligent Networks. The caller's number gets displayed on the LCD
screen before the subscriber answers the call. If the phone is connected
to the local computer and some memory augmentation is done, the computer
can display a scroll of information about the caller, before the
subscriber attends the call.

Calling Line Identification Restriction: The calling subscriber can
prevent his number being presented on the called subscriber's phone
(prevention of CLIP). However, it will be overridden by certain agencies
such as police and fire, since they need to know the identity of the
caller.

Advice Of Charge: The amount charged for the call can get displayed on
the subscriber's phone screen in the form of call units.

Call Transfer/Call Forward: The call can be routed to another specified
number or even an EVMB conditionally, if the called subscriber is not
available (or doesn't answer the call). This can be facilitated after
few rings or directly without any wait.

Paging-associated Enhanced Services

Twin Line service: A business line and a personal line number is given
to the subscriber opting for it. To separate the business messages from
the personal ones.

Sequential Numbering: All messages are sequentially numbered allowing
the subscribers to have a control on the messages missed.

Reminder Service: You can remind yourself appointment/ schedules for the
day or future dates by getting yourself paged from the operator of the
paging service.

Special Instructions: Special instructions can be given to the operator
to convey to your callers, anything which you decide. This could be for
instance change of your telephone number/address or for that matter your
being out of station.

Time And Date Stamping: These tell the subscriber when and on what date
the message was sent to them.

Priority Paging: The messages can be prioritized by jumping the queue
and thus can be entertained on an out-of-turn basis by the operator.

Repeat Paging: The subscriber can ask the operator for being paged twice
everytime, to be doubly sure.

MOBILE SATELLITE SYSTEMS

from VOICE AND DATA (India), Vol 3, Issue 4, October 1996

Call them PSMNs--Public Skyline Mobile Networks. Mobile Satellite
Systems, MSSes for short, promise to change the way all of us live.
Communication does miracles. It brings people closer. For a change, it
is now bringing satellites closer, to earth. Yes, communication
satellites today do not necessarily mean INSATs and INTELSATs, revolving
at an altitude of 35,000 km. They are now closer to us; much smaller,
and of course, much smarter. Soon, they will be crowding the skies.

By the turn of the century, more than a hundred of them would be
orbiting around the earth. Above a distance of as low as 400 km. These
are called the Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites, to distinguish them
from the traditional communication satellites like INSAT and INTELSAT,
often called geostationary satellites. Then, there are satellites that
can be placed at a distance of between 8,000 and 11,000 km, with similar
kind of functionalities. Placed between the high orbit geostationary and
low-orbit LEO satellites, these are expectedly called Medium Earth Orbit
(MEO) satellites.

MSSes are constellations of LEOs or MEOs aiming to provide mobile
communication services to millions of users around the globe. Most of
these systems will be operational by a time as early as mid-1998. At
least, seven such systems have been promised by different consortia.
Three of them are being talked about, simply because they have already
got the FCC approval in the US. Iridium is a 66-LEO project of a
consortium led by Motorola. Globalstar is a 48-LEO project to be jointly
put by Loral and Qualcomm, with different companies having service
rights for different regions. ICO is a 12-MEO project by an Inmarsat
subsidiary company. All the three are expected to be operational by
1998.

The others are Odyssey, a 12-MEO project; and Aries, a 48-LEO project
and Ellipso, a 24-satellite (combination of LEOs and MEOs) project.
Odyssey, though not in a very advanced stage of planning and
fund-raising, and the other two, deferred by FCC, also hope to start
operation in the same time frame as the FCC-approved systems. Then,
there is the grand plan by two celebrities--Craig McCaw and Bill
Gates--to start Teledesic, a project involving 840 (No, the figure is
not a printing mistake) LEO satellites to provide broadband services.

But they are talking of a time frame of beyond the year 2000. But that
is another century.

Why Not Geostationary Satellites?

The answer requires a bit of techspeak. Because, the LEOs and MEOs, as
such, are a breakthrough in satellite technology. They are not an
upgradation of the geostationary satellites. They are altogether a
different technology, belonging to a newer generation. To talk of mobile
satellite systems, without talking technology, is a mistake, to use a
mild word.

First, what necessitated the change ...

There is something called the Clarke Orbit (some also call it the Clarke
Belt). Perhaps, you know about it. For those who do not, it is an orbit
in the space about 35,860 km above the equator where the period of
revolution of an object is roughly 24 hours, the same amount of time
that the earth takes to revolve around itself. A satellite, which is
placed there, can maintain a constant elevation and angle from a
particular point on the earth, always. In other words, it appears
stationary to that particular point. Hence, the name geostationary. All
the geostationary satellites are placed in the Clarke Orbit.

But what is the problem? It is something that we Indians are very
familiar with. Excess population, that is. Clarke Orbit is just one
orbit at a single altitude. Satellites are many. So there can be what is
called "crowding". There is, of course, no possibility of physical
collision or congestion. Because, even a spacing of two degrees is
actually a distance of about 1,300 km in the Clarke Orbit. The problem,
however, is that the antennas on the ground fail to discriminate among
satellites, if they are too close in the sky, for all practical
purposes, two to four degrees. That means, there cannot be more than 180
satellites, even if we assume a two degree space.

LEOs and MEOs, on the other hand, do not have to operate at a fixed
orbit. They can be placed anywhere between altitudes of 400 to 10,000
km. So, we have no orbit constraint. Hence, no crowding. No problems for
antennas on the ground. If tomorrow, there is a need to add new
satellites, or to launch a completely new system, that can be done
without pains.

Another fact that works in favour of LEOs and MEOs is what is called the
inverse square law for signal power. According to this, a signal in
space attenuate in direct proportion to the square of the distance it
travels. The lower the altitude of a satellite orbit, lower is the
required transmitting power for a signal. Of course, there is an
alternative--that of using large antennas. But, that is also not an
attractive proposition. LEOs and MEOs, which are at a lower altitude,
require less power while using smaller antennas.

The LEOs also offer another advantage. There is negligible transmission
delay as the distance travelled by a call using an LEO is several times
lower than the same using a geostationary satellite. This means, for
mobile communications, which is predominantly voice communications, they
are better. The final deciding factor is, of course, cost of satellites
and the cost of launch. LEOs are much cheaper.

Why MSS?

Landline cellular networks do have certain limitations. Most of the
times, you are deprived of a communication link where you need it
most--in villages, rural roads, forests, and such remote locations. It
is uneconomical for any landline cellular operator to cover these
places. Mobile satellite services expand the service territory to cover
the entire world. "It is like having base stations in the sky," explains
Ming Louie, vice-president, Globalstar.

Put simply, MSSes are LEO and MEO satellite constellations that will
provide mobile voice and data communication facilities the world over.
Since an LEO or an MEO can cover much less geographical area than a
geostationary satellite, usually more satellites are used to provide
global connectivity. MSS satellites will be revolving around the entire
earth, which means any point on the earth will be covered by at least
one satellite. The advantage is that low altitude, high altitude areas,
as well as the seas will now be the coverage area of telecommunications.

MSS service will provide a cost-effective way for extending the reach of
basic telecom operators. Laying cables and even microwave links to
remote low subscriber locations is not only costlier, but also time
consuming. MSS connectivity is instant. It is connectivity on demand.

This connectivity-on-demand is beneficial even to the cellular
operators. By collaborating with an MSS operator, they can effectively
tackle the occasional demand in certain locations. Examples include
tourist and pilgrimage spots. Haridwar will have at least hundred times
more demand during Kumbh Mela than that during normal days. So will be
Puri during Rath Yatra. No cellular operator will be able to meet that
kind of differentials in demand. That is not a problem for satellites.
And, of course, they will get a ready back-up network, thus reducing
dropped calls and enhancing service quality.

It is like having base stations in the sky

Residents of rural and unserved areas will gain access to a telephone
courtesy MSS services. DoT has this ambitious plan of covering all the
villages in next three years. Estimates show, the cost involved will be
enormous as the task is almost impossible. Enter MSS and the village
public phones will be there, as and when required.

The last segment of users--the most important from the MSS operators'
point of view--are the international business travellers, the creamy
layer. With globalization, the population of this tribe has gone up
considerably. For cellular operators, using MSS services for serving
them is a better option than using roaming with other operators because
the complexities of revenue sharing can be much less in the former.

Iridium Vs Globalstar

But why only Iridium and Globalstar?

On 31 January 1995, FCC in the US allowed three of the five
applicants--Iridium, led by Motorola Inc.; Globalstar LP, promoted by
Loral and Qualcomm; and Odyssey by TRW while deferring two
others--Mobile Communication Holding's Ellipso and Constellation Com
munications' Constellation. In addition to this, there is an
international consortium, Inmarsat's ICO. So we have four projects that
are rolling on at present.

The reasons behind talking about Iridium and Globalstar are primarily,
two. They will become operational at least six months before any other
such project. Two, we are interested in India more than we are in FCC
licences or the meetings of corporate bigwigs in Los Angeles. And
Iridium and Globalstar have been most active in India (more about that
latter).

The fact that both these projects are LEO satellite-based is merely
incidental.

Iridium is pioneering. The idea of using LEOs for MSS first came to
scientists at Motorola's satellite communication division in Chandler,
Arizona. Motorola was also the first to approach the FCC for licensing
Iridium. Globalstar came latter, but now is giving good competition to
Iridium.

Iridium provides total coverage. Iridium with 66 satellites provides
total global coverage, whereas Globalstar covers only 70 degree S to 70
degree N. It excludes the poles from its coverage area.

Globalstar has low system cost. Globalstar has managed to keep its total
system cost low by using less number of satellites. Globalstar's total
system cost is $1.8 billion as compared to Iridium's $3.4 billion.
Funding, hence, won't be a problem for Globalstar.

Tariff: Globalstar wins outright. Globalstar, because of its lower
system cost, plans to provide the service at a tariff of 30 cents per
minute which is several times lower than Iridium's tariff of $3 per
minute. The Gobalstar price will be slightly higher (about 50 cents)
when it reaches the customer as the local partner will also have his
share.

Iridium uses 66 LEO satellites at an altitude of 780 km, with
intersatellite links. Irdium offers total global coverage

Prime targets are different. Though business travellers are the target
for both Iridium and Globalstar, the latter puts emphasis on developing
nations as well. This is understandable as the tariff of Globalstar can
be afforded in these countries. This is something that Iridium needs to
really worry about. The international business travellers will also need
high-speed data communication. Teledesic may also target this elite
market. As of today, the Teledesic plan is for fixed services. But with
840 satellites, mobility can be added to system with marginal
incremental cost. That will create problems for Iridium. Iridium should
either plan for broadband to directly compete with Teledesic or could
build up a loyal user base for paging. Or try both. There is no fourth
way. Perhaps, it will do that once it makes some quick revenues.

Iridium, despite large system cost, will break-even fast. Motorola,
because of its brand equity, will attract major business users. And
these are the people who will use the system more. Iridium, hence will
make much better revenue, even if Globalstar gives it a run for its
money as far as number of subscribers is concerned. That means Iridium
can plan for next phase better.

Globalstar uses technology better. Though better technology usage does
not necessarily mean better revenue, it helps. Globalstar does not use
complex inter-satellite links and keeps the entire intelligence on
ground. This will be the trend of tomorrow as this helps one to have
better control on the system.

Globalstar uses CDMA technology. CDMA is proving its superiority in
terrestrial cellular and PCS. In satellite communication, it is even
better. TDMA, being used by Iridium, requires exclusive command of the
spectrum while offering less capacity. No wonder, almost all the MSS
service hopefuls, with the exception of Iridium, are planning to use
CDMA. Iridium was finalized when CDMA was still in labs.

The Indian Scene

India is never the same as the rest of the world. MSS services are no
exception. While the rest of the world is thinking of LEOs and MEOs,
India has provisionally approved an MSS proposal using a geostationary
satellite. And, it is the only MSS proposal approved so far.

The $850 million project by Afro-Asian Satellite Communication (ASC), a
Gibralatar-based company, owned by Zee TV owner Subhash Chandra, plans
to use a geostationary satellite to cover India and 53 other countries
in the region which come under the satellite's footprint. It plans to
launch the satellite in third quarter of 1998 and start the service soon
afterwards. While transmission delay and large power requirements make
present generation geostationary satellites unsuitable for mobile
communication, a technology breakthrough may well be able to do that. A
Price Waterhouse forecast says that mobile communication with hand-held
units will become commercially available by the year 2000. Chandra plans
to do that at least a year earlier.

Inmarsat, through VSNL, has also publicized its plan to start the ICO
service by 1999. VSNL will be the local partner in services in this
project which will spend $37 million for equipment in the first phase.

But VSNL is yet to start promotional activities for ICO.

Globalstar uses 48 LEO satellites at an altitude of 1,390 km. All the
intelligence in the system is kept on the ground. There is no
intersatellite link.

In contrast, Iridium started selling the concept in mid-1995. Indian FIs
have contributed as much as $38 million to the project. That is 5
percent equity. Iridium India Telecom Pvt Ltd, as the investing company
is called, has contributions from various Indian FIs through IL & FS.
Others are IDBI, Exim Bank of India, SBI, ICICI, HDFC, GIC, LIC, and
UTI, among others.

What will help Iridium is that these FIs will use their clout to make
the venture successful. Motorola's brand equity will also help.

Globalstar, though it came much latter, has already opened up an Indian
joint venture. The company will have 51 percent share held jointly by
Crompton Greaves and Pertech Computers Ltd while the rest 49 percent
will be owned by Hyundai-led Hyundai/Dacom. Hyundai holds the Globalstar
service rights for this region. Globalstar plans to invest Rs 4,300
crore in India during the next few years. Globalstar's partners could be
the cellular service providers. Last August, Globalstar organized a
technical forum in the capital and it was one of the most well attended
forums in recent months. At least, two cellular operators are having
serious talks with Globalstar India and are waiting for government
approvals. Globalstar's strategy of co-operating with local operators
and the low tariff may give it an upper hand. But FIs still have a hold
in the industry and they have invested heavily in Iridium. That could be
a hurdle for Globalstar.

As far as Odyssey is concerned, this writer is not aware of any
activities of the company in India.

Unto The Future

A Price Waterhouse forecast says Odyssey will form a joint venture with
one of the other three consortia and additional joint ventures and
partnerships will be formed by all of the LEO groups. That is true. The
market is big. But never so big to embrace all those who rush in.
The real thing to watch is Teledesic's entry. Bill Gates has never done
anything that is not helpful to growth of personal computers in one way
or the other. Teledesic could be his latest way of ensuring his
objective. With 840 LEO satellites, it could change the whole balance of
the MSS market. And the rules of the game. But the big question: will he
finally go for M, mobility that is? The answer to that question can
determine what MSS scenario will be in the year 2010. That could be a
different story altogether. Watch this space.

MSS: For Whom?

Telecom operators seeking low-cost service expansion to remote areas
Cellular operators seeking low-cost service expansion to low-subscriber
areas of only periodic demand

Residents of rural areas seeking basic telephone service
Businesses needing cellular services globally.

NIIT - THE WINGS ARE MANY

from VOICE AND DATA (India), Vol 3, Issue 4, October 1996

In today's world of competition, only the fittest can boast of its
presence, and NIIT clearly marks its way to IT.

There had been many institutions imparting education on IT that are
coming up with high promises of success. The National Institute of
Information Technology, or NIIT as it is popularly known, is the oldest
among them all. A part of HCL Corp., ever since it started in 1981, it
brought a sea-change in the Indian IT education scenario. For the first
time, professional courses apart from medicine or engineering or law
came into being. And for the better.

Going back to 1981, when it came into being, education was the first
motive of this institution. Then it diversified to fields of training,
consultancy, software marketing, and software exports. In 1995, the
scenario changed. With the government's liberalization policy coming in
the air, the need for going global arose. And the international division
was set up.

Apart from these, software export factories were set up aimed at
providing entire software solutions to its clients that includes setting
up of the network too.

Today, NIIT is virtually into every aspect of IT. And telecom. Many
tie-ups are taking place. NIIT is diversifying and so are the areas of
education in infotech. Be it software solutions, network integration, or
Internet training, it can boast of its expertise in many areas.

The level of expansion is so high that lately the sales training
division of the institution, NIS had to be separated as an entirely
different entity. Now called NIS Sparta, the company has emerged as a
joint venture with Team Productivity, a specialist in imparting training
in sales and marketing. The other four strategic business units include
the Global Education and Training, Global Software Solutions, Global
Software Products, and Multimedia.

In the field of training, it has formed alliances with four companies:
3Com; AT&T Network Systems, now under Lucent Technologies; Microsoft
Corp.; and NETG Applied Learning.

World leaders in computer and communications software are finding India
as the green pasture to venture. And NIIT is the easy solution for them.

For it already has the second largest share in the software market in
India. The organization, already awarded with ISO 9001, international
quality certification, has little to say for its introduction.

The tie-up between NIIT and AT&T has created waves. By recognizing the
area of telecommunications as one of the thrust areas, the alliance aims
at offering training in telecom to the Indians. This includes all,
ranging from the basics to the advanced courses. And NIIT being the
Indian training associate of AT&T completes the process. A programme on
networking education is now being provided with the tie-up with 3Com
under the brand name of Centre for Network Excellence (CNE). Hence, the
total range of education from datacom to telecom is now being made
available.

Companies like Microsoft also has had an understanding with NIIT in
imparting knowledge on Microsoft technologies under the curriculum of
GNIIT programme. For this, it has got the college credit recommendations
from American Council of Education (ACE). NIIT alumnae can seek
exemptions on certain modules in the US universities on the basis of
credits. This programme provides education on Windows NT, Microsoft
BackOffice, Internet products, and Networking. NIIT itself is a major
user of the latest communication tools like videoconferencing, intranet,
and the like.

Apart from these, NIIT is also into varied IT fields like consultancy
and systems integration. In the field of software, it has formed
alliances with major companies which include Sybase Inc., Powersoft
Corp., Ansys Inc., Mentor Graphics, and Mechanical Dynamics.

It has entered into an alliance with Cincom Systems, USA, to provide
enterprise resource application software suite called Control. The main
clients among the communications company using the application are
Alcatel, Ericsson, Hitachi Semiconductor, Siemens, GEC Alsthom, and
Philips. The advanced functionality of Control is insulated with a
3-schema client/server design and is available in multiple platforms
including IBM, DEC, HP, and multiple databases that include Oracle,
Supra, Sybase, and Informix.

Ross Systems Inc. is another US company joining hands with NIIT. This
time, it is to provide the business application software suite of Ross
Systems called Renaissance CS. It is fully integrated open systems based
client/server solution designed from the ground up for process
manufacturing organization like food processing, pharmaceuticals, paper,
and chemicals.

Powersoft Corp., the subsidiary of global software major Sybase, has
tied up with NIIT to provide PowerBuilder 5.0, client/server application
development tool and Optima++ for building Internet applications. NIIT
is the sole distributor of Sybase products in India. Sybase provides
technical solutions to NIIT.

The organization that has been growing the day it had started from seems
to agree with the same old saying that Darwin meant many years ago--
Survival Of The Fittest. On asking the main motive behind NIIT's
presence in telecom education, Sanjiv Kataria, vice-president, corporate
communication, replied, "If we would not have got there, we would have
been dead by now. Today, is the era of Net Centric Computing (NCC) ... And
networking is the key to any business."

VSNL - TO EURO OR NOT

from VOICE AND DATA (India), Vol 3, Issue 4, October 1996

To raise funds and fructify its vision, VSNL does need to go the GDR
way.

Videsh Sanchar Nigam Ltd (VSNL), the Rs 4,417 crore India's
international communications carrier, has been trying to float its
Euro-issue for the past two years now. But its attempts have been
thwarted for one reason or the other.

The ministry of finance is drawing up a list of companies for immediate
disinvestment. The list includes some telecom majors and VSNL could be
one of them. The impact of this disinvestment will be negative if VSNL
has to float its GDR before the end of this year.

Post-disinvestment, the floating stock will increase. This will lead to
dilution of the share price and will ultimately affect the pricing of
VSNL's GDR issue. Further, the chances of getting an attractive price
are also doubtful because of the queue-up of other international telecom
majors. Large number of telecom companies from the US, Europe, and Asia
have firmed up plans for GDR issues totalling over $30 billion.

The first time, VSNL tried to float GDR in May 1994, the share price
fell from Rs 1,550 to Rs 1,200. The issue had to be deferred due to
depressed international equity market conditions and the stiffening of
interest rates. In the second attempt, the share price fell further to
Rs 1,050 and the issue was deferred due to delays in obtaining final
clearances from the government. So goes the VSNL's GDR saga. The
prospects looked even bleak with the impending retirement of BK Syngal,
CMD, VSNL. Even the financial advisor, Anne Morris who had witnessed the
earlier deferrals has also moved out. At the time of this article going
to print, the government has announced another 7 percent disinvestment
of VSNL's equity. And, the Telecom Commission has extended Syngal's
tenure for two more years. A real respite.

Does VSNL really require this GDR? How is VSNL positioned now? Well ...

It is placed in a comfortable position presently. Not because it is the
sole provider of international telecom services, but because it has been
able to build on its own success and vision. It might be a little known
fact that VSNL has the second highest rate of returns on equity--at 38.5
percent, just three points below Advance Info, Thailand.

VSNL has been operating independent of budgetary allocations by
ploughing money back into projects for building, maintaining, and
expanding its services. However, VSNL's profit percentage is quite low
despite being the sole service provider. This is mainly due to the fact
that the company's profit structure is solely determined by what it owes
to DoT. DoT charges each caller Rs 62.50 per minute and VSNL's income
out of this is just between Rs 4 and 7 per minute. Due to this, its
outgoing traffic has remained almost static as compared to the past.

Because, it is cheaper to call India rather than calling from India due
to falling bandwidth costs abroad. Is this an index of growth?
Definitely not.

Luckily, DoT seems to be acquiescing with global trends in telecom
tariffs. Since 1995, it has announced a 25 percent concession on
outgoing calls between 11 p.m. and 6 a.m. Even for the Internet
services, VSNL doubled up its 250 hours of access per year to 500 hours
per year.

In anticipation of growth in outgoing traffic, VSNL has been
consistently and aggressively expanding its call-carrying capacity. From
2,109 in 1991, it rose to 11,525 in 1995. And the target that VSNL has
set for itself in the next few years is 35,000. During this period, the
paid telephone circuits increased two-and-a-half times.

The target does not seem to the farfetched, because with falling
tariffs, traffic is going to explode. Together with this are emerging
applications like software exports, videoconferencing, and ISDN, to name
a few. Apart from increase in call-carrying capacity, the lines have to
be high-speed lines. Thousands of switches and fibre-optic links need to
be put up to achieve this milestone. And, this cannot be done by
retained cash-flow alone. Therefore, VSNL does need to go the GDR way.

It would be better if VSNL floats its GDR without much further delay. It
will enjoy the status of being the sole service provider for six more
years ... By that time, VSNL should have become a global telco to reckon
with. It needs to reach an enviable position that might even help the
company to get its sole provider status extended.

MADRAS - CELLULAR OR SERVICES

from VOICE AND DATA (India), Vol 3, Issue 4, October 1996

Better coverage, low call-drop, and roaming? Or interpreter assistance,
information services, and hospital emergency services? The two cellular
operators in Madras have different priorities for offering to the
customer.

Is providing cellular phone service a part of the telecom industry or
the service industry as a whole? This seems to be a major bone of
contention between the two cellular operators providing the service in
the city of the Madras. While one swears that it is undoubtedly a part
of the service segment, the other refutes it vehemently. Caught in this
war of words are Skycell Communications Ltd and RPG Cellular Services
Ltd.

"We are not a telecom industry but a service one. We are all cellular
service providers and should aim at offering more services," says Ramesh
K Narain, Senior Manager, Sales, Skycell Communications. In line with
this thought, Skycell has recently started offering a number of services
such as hospital emergency service, interpreter assistance, wake up call
facility, etc.

Justifying these host of facilities, Narain says, "The subscriber should
get a more complete service from us when he pays a hefty amount and that
is what we offer." In his opinion, people have understood the need for a
cellular phone and their realization should be valued more by offering
such additional services. "This business is no longer concept selling.
People have started to feel the need and are coming to us now," says he.

But RPG Cellular Services, the second service provider operating in
Madras has a different angle to the entire story. Shashi Kumar Kalathil,
general manager, marketing, RPG Cellular Services, dismissing the
service concept, says, "We are undoubtedly in telecom. Value addition in
cellular could only refer to voice-mail and data transfer facilities.
The rest of them whatever they be, are not value-added in classic
parlance."

The company argues that the effectiveness of the service should be
measured more in terms of the capability of the frequency signals and
not in other service packages. RPG's stance is understandable, given
that it does not offer any value-added services. Instead, it has been
harping on its wide network ever since its started operations with 24
base stations. It does claim to have the larger subscriber base of the
two.

"It is the coverage that matters", says Kalathil. Currently, it has a
total of 31 base stations and his company plans to add 10 more in the
event of a spurt in demand. This move, however, will depend on the
traffic, according to Kalathil. In his opinion, the number of base
stations need to be increased only if either the profile of the city
changes with the migration of a section of people or if the need for
greater coverage inside the buildings in a particular area arises.

Skycell is not too far behind on the base station front. It has 22 base
stations in place and plans to add 10 more by the end of October. "With
this and the new services, Skycell will surely garner about 57 percent
of the total market before the end of March 1997," avers Ramesh.

The subscribers in Madras, unmindful of the wordy duel of whether
cellular is a part of service or telecom segment, seem to have responded
to the new concept. They are not unduly excited at the availability of
such varied services though. "All these could be more of a marketing
gimmick of each of the organization," says Rekha, a business executive
working in a multinational firm in Madras. Their one overriding concern
is the high airtime charges. "Whatever it is, all that I am more
concerned with is my phone bill. Hence, I obviously use it with great
prudence," says Hari Krishnan, a cost conscious business man in
possession of a cellular phone for the past six months. "I still do not
give my cell number to everyone I know," says he.

Despite these reservations, the number of cellular subscribers in Madras
has been growing steadily. Though subscriber base has fallen short of
expectations, the numbers are not way behind projections. According to
estimates put out a year ago by the two players, Madras was to have a
subscriber base of 22,000 by the end of September 1996, the first
anniversary of cellular service in the city. Currently it is at
18,264--a 17 percent shortfall. Of the total subscriber base of 18,264
customers, Skycell claims a base of 8,994 and RPG boasts of 9,270
customers (as on 10 September 1996).

The gradual popularity of the service has motivated the operators to
introduce the concept of using cellular phones on a rental basis. "This
is mainly for those people who have a need to use a cellular phone but
are still not ready to buy one," says Kalathil. "Rent-a-Cellular"
concept is a fairly new service introduced just over a month ago and the
success of the concept still remains to be seen.

Whether the operators finally settle their differences or not, the price
conscious market of Madras has shaped up well, as per the business
plans. And this is perhaps the only area where the two operators agree
whole heartedly. "This is because this time the customers were not
budget-sensitive," say both the operators.

MRTP ACT - CAN IT LATCH DOT'S WINGS?

from VOICE AND DATA (India), Vol 3, Issue 4, October 1996

DoT has recently been brought under the purview of MRTP Act. The
question is which DoT? The service provider or policy maker?
The National Telecom Policy 1994 signalled a shift from culture of
monopoly to that of competition in telecom services. Competition, if not
fair, is Jungle law. At the same time, protection of consumer interest
is the ultimate objective. MRTP Commission's decision to include DoT
under its purview is, hence, a welcome step.

In July 1996, the two-member bench of the MRTP Commission consisting
Sardar Ali and S Chakravarthy took a historic decision to bring the
government departments rendering "non-sovereign functions or services"
if they are found indulging in restrictive, unfair, or monopolistic
trade practices except for those services which are provided free. That
includes road transportation, Railways, housing, and DoT. While most of
them are merely service providers to the consumers, DoT's case is a bit
different. It has two different functions to perform. That of operating
basic telecom services and framing policies for the entire telecom
service industry.

Does the Commission's observation also include DoT, the policy maker?
That is the point of debate. Since there is only one DoT, and it is not
too willing to separate both the roles in near future, DoT, the operator
should also be accountable for what DoT, the policy maker is doing. And
vice versa.

The Commission stated that collection of a fee for a service provided
renders it possible for the consideration by the Commission. That means
DoT--no distinction between policy maker and operator--which has taken
huge sums as licence fees, is also liable to be prosecuted if it fails
to provide service. Does that mean failure to provide easy and
acceptable interconnect facilities to the private operators can be a
reason to bring the case to MRTP Commission? While some feel this is
stretching the thing a bit too much, there is no less number of why nots
in the response. Some also say that the restrictive nature of the
interconnect agreement can be challenged on the grounds that it has made
the sector unfavourable for private operators and has thus negatively
affected the users. It should be mentioned here that as the tender
document did not stipulate any interconnection charges, there should not
be any interconnection charges. Again, DoT does not pay charges for a
call which originates from its network and goes to private operator's
network. So, DoT should also pay interconnection charges. There should
be a common code for everyone. A few of them even go to the extent of
accusing that the main objective of DoT is to maximize its revenue
irrespective of the impact this may have on the consumers and, of
course, private operators. Says TH Chowdary, director, Centre for
Telecom Management and Studies, "This is an anti-competitive,
monopolistic, and restrictive trade practice."

It is noteworthy that in the recent past, the MRTP Commission has issued
a notice to BPL Mobile, one of the cellular service providers in Mumbai.
This happened as per a consumer complaint filed against the value-added
tariff plan of the company. It is mentioned in the complaint that while
BPL Mobile in its value-added tariff plan claims to charge the consumer
Rs 4.25 per minute for every call till the consumer logs up 800 minutes
a month. But, as per the complaint, the company is collecting Rs 5 and
not Rs 4.25, even before the consumer logs up 800 minutes in a month.
This is because the company, in effect, collects Rs 4,000 as advance
charges for calls.

After the new telecom policy was announced in 1994, Indian telecom
scenario has undergone a sea change. During this period, it has gone
through many ups and downs. It has also witnessed many controversies
like not allowing the PSUs to participate in the bidding, capping on
licensing, telecom scam, and change in partnerships. Are not these
enough for MRTP Commission to be a bit stricter in implementing its
regulations on DoT?

DoT has been adopting a policy of inconsistency. Time to time, it has
changed some of its policies. Either by revising or by withdrawing.
It is a matter of fact that since the privatization of telecom sector,
DoT has been adopting a policy of inconsistency. Time to time, it has
changed some of its policies. Either by revising or by withdrawing.
However, this has not affected the growth of the Indian telecom
industry, till date. It is booming. And, one hopes, it will not do so in
the future also. Let us wait and watch.

VSAT MARKET - LOOKING FOR A FASTER TURNAROUND

from VOICE AND DATA (India), Vol 3, Issue 4, October 1996

There is an Indian Airlines flight from Varanasi to New Delhi that goes
via Bhubaneswar. If you take the flight from Varanasi for the capital,
you will fly to Bhubaneswar, and then come to New Delhi. It sounds
amusing.

But, many corporates do the same when it comes to sending electronic
mail. To send E-mail from Delhi to Madras they go to Manhattan. There is
a faster turnaround from outside than inside. One can go on and on
giving examples. But the bottomline is, after years of big talk, the
state of our communication services has improved little. Boasting about
introducing new technologies do not help. Exploring their capabilities
do. Fax has seen a tremendous growth. Reason, it was a revolution at the
customer's end. Structured cabling is seeing explosive growth. Reason,
ditto. Wherever DoT has not got involved, it has been a success story.

Can We Continue To Live With That Kind Of Attitude Today?

Today, the environment is getting increasingly competitive. Quality of
products is rising. Products are moving fast on the store shelves. Take
shirts for example. In the last couple of years, one has seen a number
of foreign brands come in. Arrow, La Coste, Ralph Lauven. In the face of
this competition, some Indian brands have survived, others have not. One
does not hear too much about Wings/Four Seasons these days, though
Zodiac has managed to do well. Indian companies can certainly compete
with global brands in quality of products. Especially in certain
segments, textiles being one. But what they do not have is the resources
that large corporates can deploy. Companies like HLL, Proctor & Gamble,
Philips. Communication is one vital tool of doing business these days.

These Indian companies also need faster, reliable communication. They
would certainly use VSATs if they are provided at an affordable cost.
After years of big talk, the state of our communication services has
improved little.

Companies need to be market ready and ready to market. It involves fast
turnaround. The newly set up private banks like IndusInd, TIMES Bank,
Centurian Bank, all have used VSATs to achieve fast turnaround. Fast
turnaround on information of deposits. And fast turnaround on profits.

And the same is the case in manufacturing and distribution. Ashok
Leyland, Bajaj Auto, SAIL, TISCO, and Essar are using this satellite
technology to move their business processes faster.

Sectors that are doing well in the economy are courier companies,
hotels, and airlines. It is a manifestation of the state of economy.

With increasing globalization, a number of joint ventures are getting
formed. And, just as in a marriage, the joint venture is going through
various stages. The first stage is the courting stage, the second is the
engagement, and the third stage is marriage. Most of the companies are
in the first stage and some are in the second. And they need to be able
to communicate with their partners--foreign and Indian alike. So the
sectors that have a role in supporting these activities are naturally
doing well. It is like the marriage season in Indian economy.

Companies like Hindusthan Lever, Proctor & Gamble, and Citi Bank can set
up their own WAN. But, then they are part of an exclusive club. They can
afford it. DoT has been slow in its commitment on customer
service--HVNET was supposed to be up and running a year ago. One is
still waiting. The other service providers are meeting with some
success. But, at an average cost of Rs 8 lakh per VSAT as far as the
TDM/TDMA variety, it is still pretty much meant only for the elite. So,
customers need to wait for prices to come down and services getting
better.

A new twist that has been added is the Sukh Ram impact. The new boss at
Sanchar Bhawan has delinked himself from day to day operations. But,
what is happening is that in the name of delinking, things are getting
delayed. An example in point. DAMA services have not got off the ground
for any VSAT provider except HFCL and Telstra V-Comm. And the new year
is already six months old.

The Need For Voice

VSATs are already in use. Yet, much more market potential needs to be
tapped. The biggest communication need in the country today is "voice".

The independent gas station owner on the National Highway is not
interested in credit card transactions because he only takes cash,
therefore, has little reason to buy a VSAT terminal. But, if you come
along and you give him a telephone line at a reasonable price and high
quality, he will buy it. There is a larger market opportunity for VSAT
and the market is demanding voice. But, they do not want voice at Rs 8
lakh, they want voice at Rs 50,000 per VSAT. Come to DAMA. At this
pricing policy regime, a DAMA terminal would be costing Rs 15-16 lakh.

Who can afford them such investments?

Today, it is the MNCs and large corporations who can think of using
VSATs. MNCs are used to large pipes connecting their various business
locations. And, in the absence of reliable terrestrial links, they need
to depend on VSATs.

Consider an organization that is Rs 700 crore dealing with high
technology products and services. The total communication costs are of
the order of Rs 3.75-4 crore. The two most important markets for this
organization are the west and south. As a result, 70 percent of the
organization's communication costs are between Mumbai and Bangalore.

That is out of the total communication costs incurred in Mumbai, i.e. of
the order Rs 1.25 crore, Rs 75 lakh are for communication between Mumbai
and Bangalore.

The rule of sercive provision is that the more the network is loaded,
the more money you make. DoT is in a commanding position and is not
about to lose its marketing share.

Let us now look at a scenario where the organization has a dedicated
leased line between Mumbai and Bangalore. The cost of the leased line
(with both fixed and recurring costs) is of the order 14 lakh. Let us
add an additional cost of 10 lakh to the downtime. So the total expenses
would be Rs 24 lakh. Compare that to Rs 75 lakh. That is a saving of 50
lakh.

Today, DoT has got 15,000 leased lines installed country-wide. And, the
concentration is in the metros. But, the issue is leased lines in
centres outside the metros. That is where VSATs can filled the gap.
Also, in its present form access to the PSTN does not exist.

The rule of service provision is that the more the network is loaded,
the more money you make. DoT is in a commanding position and is not
about to lose its marketing share. The more private networks--whether
VSATs or not access DoT's network, the more revenue DoT earns.

Even from the customer's point of view, he is not interested in some
esoteric technology, but rather in getting a phone line on demand. If
VSAT policy remains in the present form, then the real addressable
market is only for the large organizations. However, the access of VSAT
equipment to PSTN will open up a whole new market medium and smaller
companies and even individuals. And, that is the real India.

WILL THE POTENTIAL BE REALIZED?

The answers depend not on technology, but on a variety of other factors:

1. Pricing Policy

Will new services be offered at prices which attract widespread use?
Will new tariffs be extended to maximize revenues from large users or
subsidize the costs of other services?

2. Ownership Of Facilities

Will users such as broadcasters be able to own their own
satellite--receive terminals (downlinks) and transmit stations
(uplinks)? Or will they continue to be required to lease them from DoT
that will recover several times their cost in large charges?

3. Terrestrial Facilities

Will resources be allocated to solve the last mile problem, i.e. to
install local loops or radio links, rebroadcast transmitters, and so on?

4. Competition Or Exclusion

Will the established communication networks take advantage of the
technology to lower the costs and reach new customers? Will they pass on
these savings to their customers or absorb them as additional profit?
Will they attempt to block the entry of new networks designed to reach
unserved customers, or to reach existing users at lower cost?

5. Role Of Government

Will government policies be flexible enough to facilitate maximum use of
the technology. For example, the adoption of policies to minimize user
costs and to encourage new entrants to supply both equipment and
services.

6. Flexibility And Innovativeness

Will organizations that could apply satellite technology to better serve
their customers be flexible and innovative enough to adopt it?

VSAT MARKET - BAMBOO OR BONSAI

from VOICE AND DATA (India), Vol 3, Issue 4, October 1996

The most important innovation in satellite technology in the Eighties
was Very Small Aperture Terminal or VSAT. Initially, VSATs were designed
for inexpensive low volume data transmission. Today, versions have been
developed that transmit higher volumes of voice, data, and video. India
has an opportunity to leapfrog its underdeveloped communication
infrastructure with rapid VSAT deployment. And thereby pursue strong
economic growth.VSAT technology promises a wealth of new services.

Combined with advances in low cost earth station design, bandwidth
compression techniques to facilitate transmission of motion video, and
new techniques for low cost voice and data communication. And, most
importantly, social and economic benefits for society as a whole.The
market has not taken off as fast as one would have expected. We have a
window of opportunity with this technology. But, will the promise be
fulfilled? The answer depends not on technology, but on a variety of
other factors, chief among them being policy.

A Market Still To Be Born

It is still a big boy's game. At their current price, only the large
corporate users can afford VSATs. In a country that is so large and
where communication infrastructure is concentrated by and large in the
metros, one would believe that there would be a huge potential for this
technology. Its diffusion has not been as rapid as one would have
expected.

We at Voice & Data, in August 1995, had predicted a market potential of
Rs 200 crore in 1995-96. We ended up realizing only about Rs 100 crore.
The problem, however, has not been demand, but access to that demand.
And, one will need to look at flexible solutions in order to achieve
that.

In the growth of this market, the gatekeeper plays a key role. It is not
just a simple equation between demand and supply. But, one of regulating
the whole process. And DoT, as the gatekeeper, has played an inhibiting
role so far.

The tariff structure still does not reflect the advantages of this new
technology--cost independence of distance; point to multipoint
distribution; economical uses of satellite bandwidth. The structure is
still reflective of an attempt to maximize revenues from large users.
And the non-commercial attitude of DoT. It certainly, today, is not seen
as a tool to promote the development of an economy.

VSATs and terrestrial links go hand-in-hand. And, like terrestrial
links, VSATs are pipes. Ones that allow information to flow back and
forth. DoT is the provider of terrestrial links. And with demand
outstripping supply, one would have thought that DoT would encourage
deployment of these "pipes in the sky". In the growth of this market,
the gatekeeper plays a key role. It is not just a simple equation
between demand and supply. But, one of regulating the whole process. And
DoT, as the gatekeeper, has played an inhibiting role so far.

But, DoT is playing its old games. It is a monopoly and it is acting
like one. The satellite carrier cannot market directly to the end user,
but only to DoT. The equipment supplier can try and reach end users as
well as DoT, but the power to take decisions on adoption of technology
rests with DoT. Evidence of users demand can take the form of waiting
lists. In order to help meet that demand, some technology providers
could also conduct "pilot projects". But, if DoT decides not to respond
to this demand, the user has nowhere else to turn.

Contrast this with the diffusion of computers. Diffusion of this
technology does not rely on a single gatekeeper. There may be multiple
channels--wholesalers or retailers. The government may intervene to
control supply, however, by limiting imports and/or encouraging local
production of technology as a developmental strategy. Users are able to
influence supply and price through their activities in the market-place.

VSAT technology is attractive to the user because the service provider
can guarantee high quality and fixed user cost. However, the cost of
acquisition is high. As far as the customer is concerned, DoT blocks
access to equipment and services they need. And may be ready to pay for.

Corporates here can neither set up their own systems to bypass the
unreliable telephone system nor obtain high-quality services from the
telecommunication authorities. So the customer has no choice.

Why is DoT making things difficult for VSAT?

One possible reason could be that it sees VSATs as competing with
its terrestrial infrastructure.

That is why VSATs are not allowed to be connected to the public switched
telephone network. And VSAT service providers are only allowed to
connect in closed user groups. The market has huge potential. But, like
a bamboo, it needs to grow in an open and free environment.

VSATs are not necessarily a standalone technology. It is not a direct
competition for the terrestrial link. In a country where the telephone
density is 1.2 telephones per 100 people and business centres are so
widely spread, VSATs could act as a strong complementary technology.

The average trust in telecommunication service provision is rather low.

And in important matters the traditional methods (personal meeting,
signed papers, etc.) are preferred. To try to change this attitude, a
rapid solution for urgent customer needs is provided by wireless
technologies .... VSATs. DoT needs to implement HVNET fast.

The market has huge potential. But, like a bamboo, it needs to grow in
an open and free environment. People trying to play GOD will end in
creating not the real thing, but a small invitation.

STRUCTURED CABLING - DISTRIBUTION WILL DECIDE

from VOICE AND DATA (India), Vol 3, Issue 4, October 1996

Networking is the next wave and companies are trying to adapt to it.
Structured cabling provides one of the basic entry points for vendors
into customer accounts.

But, today, the focus of competition has shifted from products to
services. Providing services in networking. As a result, managers have
become increasingly concerned about the services their distributors
provide. Ideally, every participant in the distribution channel should
provide the same high-quality services to every customer.

But what are the distribution channels for structured cabling? And how
are managers of these channels looking to provide the same high-quality
services to each and every customer?

THERE are two distinct type of channels. And, they are classified by the
kind of customers that they cater to. The first kind is the
enterprise-wide customers. They are the ones who want turnkey networking
projects executed. And, they are represented by the Top 200 companies in
the country. The second kind is workgroup customers. People whose
networking product and services requirements are of a smaller magnitude.

They constitute the mass market.

WHILE every participant in the distribution channel should provide the
same high-quality services to every customer, in practice, of course,
such consistency is virtually impossible because neither the
manufacturer nor the distributor is likely to excel at everything.

Instead, companies tend to do an outstanding job with some services and
a mediocre job with others.

To overcome these discrepancies, managers commonly try to achieve the
impossible goal of making every channel member equally skilled in every
service. Often this effort entails forcing distributors to hire
additional service personnel or sponsoring training programmes for
distributors.

Innovative managers are trying a different approach. Recognizing that
the proficiencies of some channel members can be used to bolster those
of others, they are experimenting with what we call capabilities-sharing
agreements. Through such agreements, the superior service of one channel
member is substituted for the inferior service of another. Each channel
member offers a greater number of high-quality services at far lower
costs than it could by acting alone. And each contributing distributor
receives appropriate compensation when it shares its superior
capability.

This is the idea, implementation, though, could be tricky. Let us looks
at the national netas. The HCLs, the Wipros, and the like. Today, the
networking products market is of the order of Rs 300 crore. It is
expected to touch Rs 1,200 crore by 1998-99. Four times growth in three
years. And, everyone would be looking to address this market. Now this
market can be segmented into two distinct streams--the enterprise-wide
market and the workgroup market. Opportunities exist in both the
markets. The turnkey solutions market is of the order of Rs 450 crore
and workgroup segment another Rs 750 crore. But how can these
opportunities be addressed by the players?

THIS opportunity is huge and now is the time companies need to be
positioning. For action delayed could be market denied. In order to
highlight the way the market is evolving, we have built up a model.

Consider the given chart. The X axis represents volume, while the Y axis
represents value. Volume means amount of business in structured cabling.
The key driver for this axis is money. The Y axis corresponds to value
add. Higher one goes on the Y axis, higher the value add. The driver of
this axis is intellectual resources.

The way a company decides to deploy its resources to distribute
structured cabling could get it to be classified into different
quadrants.

THE first quadrant has two distinct clusters ... Cluster I has HCL
Comnet, Wipro, Digital, and TISL. These companies are the big names and
traditional rivals. The biggies would want to address the entire market.
But to address those turnkey projects, they will need to form alliances.
Let us take an example. Wipro has bagged an order from BPCL for a
turnkey project. It will be the one point source for the entire project.
However, it has contracted Comptel for doing the structured cabling.

That is Comptel's strength. And, this partnership is not only for this
particular project, but rather on a more continuous basis. Same is the
case with HCL Comnet which as been developing its own cabling partners.
The company has met with a great deal of success in bagging campus-wide
network projects. Cable laying requires a great deal of customization.
And for this specialized job, you need to call in professionals. Digital
is going to gain from growth in the manufacturing sector. TISL has some
key accounts which it should be able to leverage on.

Cluster II has players like MicroLand, Datacraft-RPG, and PCL. CMS is
the one to watch as it has been gaining ground rapidly. These people
will bag, on an average, less revenue from structured cabling in the
enterprise-wide cases than the biggies.

MicroLand has a strong presence in the corporate segment, Datacraft-RPG
is making inroads through its network integration focus. PCL is another
player in this league with strong public sector and government accounts.
CMS is beginning to make an impact. It got shortlisted in the Reliance
deal with HCL, Wipro, and Digital.

The long-term success of turnkey/enterprise-wide solution providers will
depend on how well they are able to partner with other smaller players.

The big guys have bagged these corporate accounts after aggressive
selling and close customer contact. It is now going to be difficult for
them to give up control to their partners. Comptel is doing
sub-contracting work on cabling with Wipro, but in time would be getting
big enough to pitch for certain contracts on its own. In any case, the
smaller partners shall be increasing their influence in the active
components of the networking game while the biggies would want them to
concentrate on the passive components only. This is because structured
cabling is not where these biggies make money, with increasing
competition, margins are certainly getting squeezed. They carry cable in
order to provide a one stop shop to the customer; margins are higher in
doing higher value add, network design, and integration.

IF you look at the second quadrant, here are companies that are playing
the high volume game. Advantec, Apcom, and MicroLand/Microsell. That is
the present state. There is an opportunity for both HCL Comnet and Wipro
to get into the distribution game. This is because they have large reach
nation-wide and also partners who would be looking to source structured
cabling from them. And, they seem to be preparing to get into it.

Advantec has certainly been very successful. It was a pioneer of sorts
and is modeling itself on Anixter. Anixter is one of the most successful
distribution chains world-wide.

In the distribution game, it is reach and level of support that is
provided to the customers which set distributors apart. This high-volume
game is going to be addressing the large workgroup market. Also, a
number of structured cabling vendors would be depending on these
distributors to get their brand visibility and marketshare. AT&T, today,
has alliances with most of the key guys in the game, Advantec,
Microsell, and Wipro. Apcom is another leader in the distribution game.

It is helping Nortel gain market share. HCL Comnet is the one to watch.
It is working in an exclusive relationship with Siemon. It will be
interesting to see how it builds up the Siemon brand against Lucent.

Another cluster that is emerging in the same quadrant has companies like
IT&T, BNA, and C-Tel. These are companies that have signed distribution
agreements with AMP, BICC, and IBM, respectively. IT&T is a medium-sized
networking company, focusing mainly on markets in the North and West.

BNA is a strong technology company that has focused on cabling right
from the start. It is based out of Bangalore. C-Tel is a company that
also has a strong technology orientation. It has been looking at the
networking market from the high value-add side--things like network
design and integration. The market is growing rapidly and all these
companies have an opportunity to penetrate the market. How successful
they are, depends on their choice of target segments and reach.

The way a company decides to deploy its resources to distribute
structured cabling could get it to be classified into different
quadrants.

THE third quadrant has companies that are the workhouses ... the actual
implementors. Companies like Proactive Data Systems, Comptel, BNA,
Optel, Gateway Systems, Delta Force, Taker Technologies, Advanced Micro
Devices, and Infotech. They are the guys who get their hands dirty.

Companies here are relatively new and small. And have very different
backgrounds. Proactive Data Systems has evolved from a background of
vending networking products and services. Taker Technologies has history
of providing EPABX Systems. Optel and Gateway Systems are dealing with
fibre optic cable. This is a specialized area. Optel is partnering with
HCL Comnet on campus wide projects.

Gateway Systems is more focused in the West--addressing large corporate
customers like Bajaj Auto and Telco. So, the backgrounds here are both
voice and data. And, there are some who have always focused only on
cables, like BNA. One will see increasing number of players as this is
one entry point into the market. But then companies here will start
moving into other quadrants. Like, Proactive which is trying to move up
with higher value add and BNA that is looking at the mass market.

THE fourth quadrant is the sector where one is seeing the largest chunk
of hidden champions move in. Companies like Ramco, Zenith, Unicorp,
Melstar, DCM DataSystems, IT&T, and Samtech. These are companies who are
targeting the workgroup market. They are realizing that structured
cabling is a key point of entry into the customer's backyard. They are
realizing that they need to have influence on as many networking
products as possible. So, they are extending their focus from boxes to
the core of the network infrastructure; and, provide a total network
solution to the customer.

Ramco, for example, has been one of the biggest channels for Bay's hub
sales in the country. Realizing the strong correlation between hubs and
structured cabling, it is now focusing on cabling as well. And, as it is
targeting largely workgroups, it is a typical IV quadrant player.
Another interesting company here is DCM DataSystems. It is focusing on
the networking products and services market, more importantly, the
government and public sector organizations, the typical tender market.
And, it has tied up with AMP, a recognized structured cabling brand from
the US.

These are one kind of players here. Another are companies who are
targeting newer opportunities in structured cabling itself. Structured
cabling involves UTP and fibre. Laying fibre is still a specialized job.
And, a whole lot of opportunities are emerging in manufacturing and
telecommunication sectors to deploy fibre. Here companies like Optel,
Gateway Systems, and Proactive Data Systems are trying to position
themselves.

STRUCTURED CABLING - INTERVIEW WITH AJAY ADVANI, DIRECTOR, LUCENT
TECHNOLOGIES

from VOICE AND DATA (India), Vol 3, Issue 4, October 1996

Ajay Advani, director, Lucent Technologies and former director,
Advantec, is one man who has had the inside track of the structured
cabling in India right from its inception. Interview with him follows.

Structured cabling was a new concept here in 1992. What was your
experience in this early phase?

Things were hard. In those days, I remember making customer calls and
getting insulted. "Haven't heard of your company and if this technology
is as great as you claim, then with a brand like AT&T to back it, it
does not need selling. And if we want this thing, we will speak to AT&T
directly."

What was the focus then?

One thing was getting to be clear. Customers are apprehensive of new
technology. They are looking for change, a better change. But they are
not sure whether this vendor is the right vendor or not. I tried to make
the customers comfortable. To reassure them that there is no catch. But
I needed reference sites.

When did that happen?

My first reference site came to me in February 1993, over six months
after I had been in the field. It was a Wipro customer, a paint company
in Mumbai, to whom the company had sold 11-12 nodes. That was the first
time I saw this technology work in India.

Who were your first major customers?

Banks. MNC banks were my first major customers. Citibank, Chase
Manhattan, Standard Chartered.

How do you see the technology evolving?

Technology is heading towards faster and faster data transmission
speeds. Voice and data was integrated early. Video was a bit of a
problem, but that has now been taken care of. Today, you have buildings
with structured cabling systems that support outlets for phone, PC, TV,
VCR, smoke detector, and fire alarm.

Are you referring to intelligent buildings? Don't you think it is a
little futuristic today?

The concept of intelligent building is more with respect to the mindset
of the builder. Structured cabling helps add value to properties. Cost
of real estate is rising rapidly--at least in the metros. While property
rates have grown 200 percent in the last two years in Mumbai, builders
are looking to provide value to properties. Along with marble on the
floor, granite in the kitchen, and phone with voice mail and other
features, they are planning to provide shafts for structured cabling.

STRUCTURED CABLING - THE MAGIC MARKET

from VOICE AND DATA (India), Vol 3, Issue 4, October 1996

Having good quality cabling infrastructure is very important as over 70
percent of the network problems are cabling-related, and the cost of
downtime can exceed original costs.

However, in our interactions with corporate users and industry, we came
across some interesting trends. One is that both the supply side and
demand side are driving the cabling market. Also, size of market
opportunity is getting major network integrators to look at this market
from more than one viewpoint.

The supply side of the equation shows entry of a number of new
international vendors. Demand is getting fuelled from not only the
existing markets, but the new markets as well.

We are presenting the method in the madness--of how we see things unfold
and on what is hot in today's technology.

The most important trend in networking today is "growing demand".
Corporates are reporting an increase of 20 percent to 70 percent per
year in the number of nodes they are adding to their networks. And what
does networking entail? It enables resource-sharing. In other words,
connecting resources together. And to connect, one needs cable.

"Structured cable", in today's context.

But why so much hoopla about structured cabling? The great interest in
structured cabling is because it provides convenience. The drivers for
cabling today are the need for resource-sharing, the need to scale-up
office productivity, and an increased emphasis on workgroup
collaboration. And in order to achieve this, every seat in an
organization needs to be network ready. Irrespective of where you are
sitting, you need to be connected.

Every seat in an organization needs to be network ready. Irrespective of
where you are sitting, you need to be connected.

The structured cabling market is seeing strong growth, growing over five
times in two years. From Rs 23 crore in 1994-95 to over Rs 120 crore by
1996-97. Both the supply side and the demand side continue to fuel
growth. There is a great deal of infrastructure that needs to be put in
place in organizations as the economy becomes more service driven and
competitive.

The market is being driven by three distinct forces. First is the
presence of increased number of players. The second is the demand in new
customer segments--geographically and sectorially. And, third is
increased networking industry focus.

THE number of structured cabling vendors has grown three times in the
last six months. Till March 1995, the active players were Lucent
(formerly AT&T), Nortel, and Siemon. Today, we have six more
players--AMP, BICC, Digital, IBM, Molex/Mod-Tap, and Siemens. RAD/RIT
Group is also planning to enter the market.

So far, Lucent is the clear leader having entered the market early with
a strong product offering and its principal channel partners--Advantec
and MicroLand--having done a great job. HCL Comnet has helped Siemon
gain a foothold in this market, while Apcom has consolidated Nortel's
position in the structured cabling market.

Looking at the rapid growth of this market, a number of international
vendors felt that they needed a piece of the action. AMP, a US-based
company, has entered the market through alliances with IT&T and DCM
DataSystems. BICC Brand Rex, a UK-based company and part of one of the
largest cable companies, has forged alliances with BNA Flexinet Systems
and CMC. Digital and IBM, the leading computer vendors and the early
propounders of this technology, also have their own version of
structured cabling systems. Molex is one of the leading connector
companies in the world and has its own manufacturing plant here. It is
distributing its cabling system through Intercom Systems and Eiko
Computers. Siemens is a major player in the European market with its
shielded twisted pair offering. RAD/RIT, an Israeli company, has
alliances with CG Informatics and MRO-Tek.

So far, structured cabling has fund favour in the large cities. Now,
the market is moving out and beyond them. Into industrial towns and
clusters.

FROM the supply side to the demand side. Demand is rising--not only in
existing segments, but in new segments too. One of the earliest
customers was the financial sector--Citibank, ANZ Grindlays, and
Standard Chartered are some prominent names. Citibank, in 1993, was
looking to provide telebanking services to its customers. And, it needed
to get its infrastructure in place. The demand for structured cabling
came in from the telecommunication side. Today, as Citibank looks at
expanding its suite of customer services, both voice and data
applications are getting increasingly deployed.

These and other top-of-the-line organizations in the financial sector
were the first to invest in structured cabling. For them, it was a key
infrastructure requirement. The same was the case with Kentucky Fried
Chicken. It is known for talking "chicken". But even before it ordered
its chickens, it had got its cables in place. And all thought-out and
structured. Same has been the case with Coca Cola, Levi-Strauss, and,
now, Ford. These are large transnational companies who understand the
value of having infrastructure in place to provide services to their
customers. Whether it is cola, cloth, or cars.

Another segment is the high-tech sector--information technology and
communication companies. Companies like Oracle, Novell, Motorola, and
Nortel. Software Technology Parks have also seen large scale deployment
of structured cabling. HCL Consulting, Infosys, and Cadence are examples
of such companies.

The campuses also have contributed to the market. IISc Bangalore, IIT
Kharagpur, IIT Mumbai, IT-BHU, and JNU are examples of networked
campuses.

The big opportunities are emerging in manufacturing. A large number of
steel, automobile, and consumer durable companies are setting up shops.
General Motors and Larsen & Toubro are setting up factories in Baroda.
Ludhiana is emerging as a key centre where a whole lot of structured
cabling is getting deployed. Hero Cycles is one of the major sites. But,
a whole set of new customers are coming up there.

Typically, so far, structured cabling has found favour in the large
cities--Bangalore, Calcutta, Delhi, Madras, and Mumbai. In places like
Coimbatore/Tirupur, Cochin, and Hyderabad in the South, in the
industrial clusters of Lucknow/Kanpur, Bhopal/Indore, and in and around
Ludhiana in the North. The most industrial activity today seems to be
happening along the Vapi belt ... along Mumbai/Surat stretch, and also
in Pune/Nasik in the West.

The Taj Group of Hotels is looking to deploy structured cabling across
its 40 locations country-wide. Here, apart from providing infrastructure
support, structured cabling is also seen to add value to "the
properties".

This is the same concept that a number of builders and architects are
toying with. DLF, Ansals, and Raheja are builders looking at deploying
structured cabling along with a whole suite of other facilities.

Hospitals are another opportunity area. A great deal of voice and data,
and video flows back and forth in a modern hospital.

Another potential opportunity area for structured cabling is emerging in
telecommunications. Cellular service has been operational in the metros
for almost a year now. And, cellular networks are getting to be rolled
out in other states. Escotel has announced start of services in Meerut,
some 70 km from Delhi. These structured cabling products could be
modified to suit some of the needs of these operators. Particularly, in
networks with distributed architectures, data flow can be done through
structured cabling.

THE last (but certainly not the least) driver of the structured cabling
market is the increased networking industry focus. Wipro formed an
alliance with Lucent in July 1996. HCL Comnet, in August 1996, appointed
a general manager to spearhead its indirect channel sales. These events
have a common thread. Wipro was earlier sourcing its structured cabling
requirement from Advantec. Today, it feels that with its reach and
focus, it can get into the distribution game, apart from its focus on
network systems integration. The same is the case with HCL Comnet. These
are large IT groups and their focus has been on high value addition in
the network integration game. But that was true when the cabling market
was only at the high end--the enterprise level whether large campuses or
large corporate accounts. Now, the market is taking on mass market
colours, and the big networking companies--HCL Corp., Wipro, Digital,
TISL, MicroLand, and Datacraft-RPG are getting very interested. And,
when they get interested, the market potential intensifies.

Also, the new entrants into the structured cabling market, AMP, has
formed alliances with IT&T and DCM DataSystems. With IT&T, the alliance
is to act as a distributor and also a network integrator. With DCM
DataSystems, it is for a whole range of networking products. Same is the
case with BNA which is to act as a distributor for BICC. Siemon has an
exclusive relationship with HCL, while Nortel is going with Apcom.

You can also expect a whole host of other networking companies--Ramco,
CMS, Comptel, Unicorp, Samtech, and others--to get interested. After
all, structured cabling is one point of entry into a customers network.
And an increasingly important one.

THE structured cabling technology is in transition. Traditional cabling
was the cause of over half the network's downtime. Structured cabling
provides paths of reliability in information flow in the ever-changing
world of networks. Structured cabling system is a complete
infrastructure. It consists of cables and the connecting hardware as
well as the installation and administration practices required to
provide system reliability and longevity. A structured cabling system is
designed to provide a physical link between every work area in a
building or in a campus, and is installed with little knowledge of the
type of communication equipment being connected to it. It accommodates
all of a building's current communication requirements and provides the
ability to cope with new needs as they arise.

When one thinks of structured cabling systems, one thinks of cabling
connectors, wall plates, work area outlets, test equipment, and patch
panels to support standards based 100 Ohm Category 3, 4, and 5 UTP as
well as 62.5/125 mm fibre optic cabling. Today, "Category 5" has become
the hottest term since UTP. But what are these Cats?

Category 3 cable is intended to be used for voice and data transmission
rates up to 10 Mbps--transmission requirements specified to 16 MHz.

Category 4 is intended to be used for voice and data transmission rates
up to 16 Mbps--transmission requirements specified to 20 MHz. Category 5
is intended to be used for voice and data transmission rates up to 100
Mbps--transmission requirements specified to 100 MHz.

ONE characteristic that will be critical in all future structured
cabling technologies is their relationship to the technology already
installed. The new generation of technology must offer more than mere
investment protection though it must certainly offer that. And, it must
do more than simply integrate the new technology with the existing
infrastructure. Owners will want new technology to evolve in such a way
that it adds value continuously to the infrastructure investment already
made.

And, they will want this happen across the board in systems, in the
products that implement the systems; in the support available; in the
business process involved in buying and installing new systems; and in
the development of applications and services.

looking for a distributor in the South. It plans to aggressively push
fibre cables.

* BICC Brand Rex

Scotland-based BICC Brand Rex is a merger of one of the largest cable
manufactures, BICC Cables, with Brand Rex Inc. It has an alliance with
the RPG Group, one of the largest Indian business houses. It has
appointed BNA Flexinet Systems and CMC as its distributors and network
integrators.

* Digital

One of the pioneers of the concept of structured cabling. Its cabling
system is application specific. It needs to come out more aggressively
in the market as manufacturing is the big opportunity.

* IBM

Another of the pioneers, who lost its lead to more open systems in
structured cabling. Has entered the market through a tie-up with C-Tel.

TISL, the network integration company, has a large customer base along
with its partners like CMS and Zenith.

* Molex/Mod-Tap

One of the leading connector companies in the world. Has acquired
Mod-Tap and vends the Mod-Tap universal system. Local manufacturing will
be key in the long run and it has got its acts together on that front.

Has distribution arrangements with Intercom Systems.

* Siemens

This German giant has a major presence in Europe. In India, it needs to
get more aggressive. It has a strong product in the shielded twisted
pair segment. That will find a market primarily in the manufacturing
sector, with large number of users.

* Nortel

One of the leading vendors in the North American market, here Apcom has
helped it get a foothold. Apcom is a strong distribution player and has
performed well in the copper-based segment of the market, so far. The
focus has been on banking, software technology parks, and campus wide
networks.

* Lucent

Is the market leader and has a head start in being the first into the
Indian market. It has had major success in top-of-the-line
organizations. The challenge would be to take on the collective might of
the new entrants. Like a leader, it will have to look at newer
opportunities in deploying structured cabling systems.

* Siemon

Has an exclusive relationship with HCL Comnet. It is one of the major
cabling companies and competes well with its competitors and, in some
instances, exceeds them with its regular introduction of new products.
