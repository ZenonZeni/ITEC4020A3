GROWTH IN CORPORATE IMAGING TOP STORY OF 1995

     Plan to offer image-based cash management applications this year
if corporate customers make up a significant part of your business.
     Interest in applications such as image archive and retrieval,
image positive pay and CD-ROM delivery will continue to skyrocket,
predicts David Medeiros, a consulting analyst with The Tower Group,
based in Wellesley, Mass.
     The coming year also could bring wider acceptance of the Internet
for transmitting sensitive data; the long-awaited introduction of
Rapid*EDI; less interest in electronic data interchange (EDI); and
more banks using electronic check presentment (ECP), say consultants
in assessing last year's trends. 

Banks Offer Image Processing

     "As soon as enough large banks have installed image-based cash
management, corporate banking customers will come to expect it.  If
your bank's not offering it, they'll find [a bank] that is," Medeiros
noted.
     Indeed, Chase Manhattan Bank of New York, Bank of Boston and
Chemical Banking Corp.'s New York-based Geoserve division came to
market in recent weeks offering check images on CD-ROM (CORP, Dec. 27,
p. 7).
     Chemical also announced plans last year to integrate imaging into
all phases of its check operations, including proof-of-deposit and
archiving.
     The technology allows firms to use search and retrieval software
to pull up a check image on a personal computer screen, as opposed to
finding the image on microfilm or pulling a paper check out of a
storage box, the banks say.  
     "Many [banks] anticipate that they will be able to resolve
telephone inquiries while the payee or customer is still on the
phone," added Mary Ann Hardy, an image product manager at Bank of
Boston.
     Similarly, many banks began offering image-enabled wholesale
lockbox processing last year, including Harris Bank, based in Chicago
(CORP, Dec. 27, p. 7).  
     The bank says the technology will streamline its operations and
provide customers with reduced storage needs and immediate access to
check and remittance images for faster accounts receivable-posting and
reconcilement.
     Using the lessons of history, here's a look at the major stories
of 1995 and how they'll relate to the decisions you'll be making this
year:     

     *  Best Marriage of Technologies:  Interbank check imaging.  By
combining check imaging and electronic check presentment (ECP), the
Financial Services Technology Consortium (FSTC) developed a paperless
check clearing process to reduce check fraud and provide faster access
to funds (CORP, Dec. 27, p. 1).  Banks also will benefit from faster,
cheaper check clearing, FSTC says.
     Huntington Bancshares of Columbus, Ohio, Bank of Boston, Citibank
of New York and Chemical, exchanged digitized check images across
dissimilar systems as part of a pilot sponsored by FSTC.  "The
ultimate aim of interbank check imaging is check truncation," notes
one FSTC member. 
     The next steps for interbank check imaging involve adding
security features, anticipated industry standards, and remote storage
capabilities.

     *  Biggest Development in Electronic Commerce:  The multiple new
products promising hardware-based encryption and back-end support for
Internet commerce.
     "There has been a lot of hype about the potential for break-ins,
but now with recent [product] developments, the Internet is viable,"
explains Iang Jeon, senior analyst with Forrester Research,
headquartered in Cambridge, Mass.
     For example, the Templar Certification Program, introduced last
year by Premenos Technology Corp. of Concord, Calif., allows
electronic data interchange (EDI) vendors to incorporate Templar with
their translation software to offer secure Internet EDI.  Similarly,
the Internet Services Roadmap from Digital Equipment Corp., based in
Maynard, Mass., offers a set of secure Internet services for users and
service providers.
     Other companies that introduced new products last year for
sensitive data transmission over the Internet include RSA Data
Security and Netscape Communications Corp., both of Redwood City,
Calif., and Atalla Corp. in San Jose, Calif. (CORP, Nov. 29, p. 1).
     *  Most Talked About Product:  Rapid*EDI.  The low-cost financial
data interchange system was scheduled to pilot in July but hit a snag
when Sterling Software of Dallas pulled out of the project (CORP, May
31, p. 1). MCI Communications Corp. of Arlington, Va., then chose
CertiSoft Solutions of Englewood, Colo., to produce the software
(CORP, Oct. 18, p. 8). 
     The National Automated Clearing House Association (NACHA) had
awarded MCI the contract for this project in 1994 to provide a cheap,
Windows-based EDI service in hopes of boosting financial EDI volumes
on the automated clearing house network (CORP, Dec. 14, p. 1). 
Regardless of the delay, NACHA believes it has achieved part of its
goal of encouraging the development of financial EDI:  There are now
at least five low-cost financial EDI packages on the market.

     *  Most Surprising Trend of 1995:  Only a handful of banks rushed
to take advantage of newly loosened interstate banking rules.  Since
October, bank holding companies have been allowed to unify multistate
operations on a single platform.  But "I don't see [many] banks doing
it," notes Connie Beck, executive vice president with NationsBank,
headquartered in Charlotte, N.C.  "We see it as one of our key
competitive advantages for [the next three years]."
     Indeed, banks have claimed for years that putting their corporate
products on a single platform would allow them to slash costs, reduce
errors and add new technologies more quickly.  But Cynthia Glassman,
managing director with Furash & Co. in Washington, D.C., speculates
that some large banks may be tied to the strategies they developed in
the era of restrictive geographic boundaries -- emphasizing local
service, granting local bank presidents autonomy to react to regional
conditions, and encouraging internal competition to push down costs.
      Glassman warns that this may not be a viable strategy in 1996. 
"Entrepreneurs like to deal with the president of the bank, and
they're not going to do that with a big, nationwide bank," she said.

     *  Sign of Things To Come:  The EBT Council held its inaugural
meeting in 1995 (CORP, Sept. 20, p. 1).  The group was organized by
NACHA to help facilitate the Federal EBT Task Force's plan for a
nationwide infrastructure that will enable EBT processors to handle
transactions across the country, allowing for the portability of
benefits.  The EBT Council also will take up the continuing
controversy over bidding procedures used to award EBT contracts.

     *  Biggest Bank Merger of the Year:  Chemical and Chase.  The $10
billion merger, due to be finalized this summer, will create a titan
in the fields of transaction processing and funds transfer services,
industry watchers predict.  
     The "new" Chase will have a strong international presence,
greater role in electronic funds transfer and more resources to
bankroll bold technological experiments.  In the New York area alone,
the combined banks will account for 35 percent to 40 percent of the
wholesale banking markets, estimated one analyst who asked not to be
identified (CORP, Sept. 6, p. 1).
     In addition, Yun Jae Chung, a banking analyst with NatWest
Securities Corp. in New York, says the banks generated about $1.9
billion in 1994 from their transactions processing businesses alone. 

     *  Most Daring Prediction for 1996:  EDI is dead.  "Not only have
EDI implementations flattened, they've trailed off," notes Mike
Alfonsi, who manages the treasury consulting practice at CoreStates
Bank, based in Philadelphia.  Alfonsi anticipates little growth in EDI
at the current price of implementation.  "We've a hit a wall with
cost," he claimed.
     Another consultant, who asked not to be named, added that EDI is
taking on another form.  Moving transaction data electronically is
available through procurement cards, lockbox imaging and E-mail, says
this consultant, who claims:  "Over the short run, no one is going to
make a lot of money on EDI." 
     Beck counters that "more and more companies have the systems in
place to really leverage EDI, some of them are increasingly making it
mandatory."

     *  Top Advice for 1996:  Get your feet wet with ECP if you
haven't already, recommends Steve Takahashi, group senior vice
president for ABN-AMRO Services Company Inc., in Chicago.  Takahashi
believes more banks will develop ECP systems this year and begin to
exchange items electronically to slash check fraud, boost
productivity, develop new return item products, and take advantage of
ECP-related discounts offered by some Federal Reserve banks.  
     "Many banks have developed ECP systems, but they haven't gone
live," he noted.  The problem is, most banks only are set up to send
but not receive ECP transmissions.  ABN-AMRO hopes to begin exchanging
ECP items early this year.  (Dave Medeiros, The Tower Group, 617/235-
5777; Steve Takahashi, ABN-AMRO Services Company, 312/904-7477; Bank

NACHA, EDIBANX DISCUSS LINK TO SPUR EDI IMPLEMENTATION  

     The National Automated Clearing House Association (NACHA) and the
EDI Bank Alliance Network Exchange (EDIBANX) are considering ways to
tie the two networks together to facilitate more widespread use of
financial electronic data interchange (EDI).  
     "One of the problems with financial EDI right now is that not
enough people are doing it," observes Scott Lang, staff director for
NACHA's Bankers EDI Council.  Both groups hope that by interconnecting
the networks they'll be able to boost bank revenues and lower costs by
increasing financial EDI volume.   
     The Bankers EDI Council moved last October to create the EDI
Integration Task Force to formally take up the issue.  Comprised of
representatives from NACHA, EDIBANX, the Federal Reserve System, New
York Automated Clearing House (NYACH), VisaNet and the leading EDI-
capable banks, the task force was scheduled to hold its first meeting
as we were going to press, at the NACHA/Treasury Management
Association Financial EDI Conference in Nashville.  
     EDIBANX and NACHA representatives, however, have been meeting
informally since June.  The early NACHA model to emerge from those
talks has certain ACH operators acting as ambidextrous "gateways,"
able to handle both the native X12 format from the EDIBANX network and
NACHA's CTX.  These gateway operators would wrap an incoming EDIBANX
transmission in the CTX envelope for delivery on the ACH network, and
would similarly unwrap any outgoing transmission for delivery on the
EDIBANX network.  
     Establishing the technical infrastructure, value-added features
and protocols may prove the easiest issues of this partnership.  The
tougher call will be whether EDIBANX will retain its franchise.
     EDIBANX "wants the traffic to go one way.  If that's something
they insist upon we'll probably never get anywhere with these
discussions," says George Thomas, senior vice president with the
NYACH.  But EDIBANX will lose its exclusivity, and possibly its
members, if the network has to accept EDI transmissions originated on
the ACH system. 

EDI Implementation Moving Slower Than Expected

     The EDIBANX network, which is operated by the Chicago Clearing
House Association, went on-line in October 1994 but quickly lost
momentum due to the slow pace of EDI implementation.  By summer 1995,
EDIBANX and NACHA had begun informal talks to explore the possibility
of working together to boost corporate-to-corporate electronic
payments.  
     "I'm not sure I can put my finger on any one reason why it's
moving slowly," says Mark Stuparich, vice president of New York-based
Chase Manhattan Bank, which has put off its EDIBANX implementation due
to weak customer demand.  "The volume has not been growing as rapidly
on the EDIBANX network as we had hoped, and so the incentive for us to
move has not been as great," he explains.  
     One incentive that has failed to materialize is cheaper pricing. 
EDIBANX had assumed there would be sufficient network volume to
justify fixed prices. Chase, and other banks with large-scale
transactions, anticipated significant savings over CTX pricing which
varies depending on the addenda size.  But Stuparich says "the volumes
aren't there yet in the EDIBANX network, so it's probably not even
fair to try to make a comparison."
     "To the extent that implementation of the EDIBANX product is
slower than anybody expected, it's probably pretty much in line with
the slowness of the rest of corporate electronic trade payments, says
Richard Bort of Richard Bort & Assocs., a consulting firm in Sherman
Oaks, Calif.
     "I got involved in financial EDI in 1986 and from that time
through today, we've been saying:  'It's coming!  It's coming!'  But
the implementation of corporate electronic trade payments has been
much slower than anybody had ever thought it would be," he says. 
     NACHA's Lang suggests it has been difficult, if not impossible,
to achieve a critical mass of EDI trading partners because not enough
financial institutions are EDI-capable.  The Chicago Clearing House
thought it had the answer with EDIBANX, which got rid of the NACHA CTX
envelope to simplify the EDI format and provided a guide to EDI-
capable trading partners.  But companies have apparently not rushed to
take advantage of the value-added features.                 "You're
not going to get companies to switch banks just so they can get  
EDI," says NYACH's Thomas.  "What you have to do," he says, "is
something NACHA is doing with the Rapid*EDI program:  Provide a low-
cost vehicle to make virtually every financial institution EDI-
capable."
     The Rapid*EDI software is a scaled-down, turnkey package, which
enables small-to-medium-sized financial institutions to receive EDI.  
     Today EDI is a risky business on the ACH network as fewer than 10
percent of NACHA-member banks claim to be EDI-capable, says Chase's
Stuparich.  By contrast, EDIBANX provides a guarantee that the
receiving bank will be able to properly handle a transaction.  
     In addition, the EDIBANX network provides syntax editing,
validation and acknowledgements, all of which NACHA has been pushed by
members to provide.  
     "They both have something to gain by having a partnership," says
Stuparich.  "What NACHA has to gain is some of the enhanced
capabilities that were built into the EDIBANX network.  I think what
EDIBANX has to gain is rapid access to a large volume of
transactions." 

Is There Sufficient Demand for EDI?

     While the obvious synergies  prompted creation of the EDI
Integration Task Force, it remains an open question whether the two
networks together will generate any more EDI traffic than they've been
able to achieve separately.  
     Though less elegant than the native X12 format used on the
EDIBANX network, NACHA's CTX envelope provides the essential EDI
capability.  And even though the CTX is limited to 9,999 addenda
records, "that hasn't been a major stumbling block in the typical
accounts payable world," says Stuparich.
     "There are a number of reasons why EDI is difficult; financial
EDI is yet a little bit more difficult," says Bort, who suggests
corporate treasurers and chief financial officers are still not
convinced they need to bother with electronic trade payments.  It will
come, says Bort, if reengineering catches up with corporate
downsizing.
     "Companies that do it right reengineer.  They find better ways to
get from point A to point B," and that includes implementing
electronic corporate trade payments, says Bort.  But, he adds, "that's
not the way corporate America has done it.  They chop the people
first.  Then they haven't got enough people to figure out how do we do
this thing called 'EDI.'" 
     NACHA and EDIBANX have the people to figure it out, but are
having some trouble figuring out how to do it together.   (Richard

CHECKFREE, SERVANTIS COMBINE TO LEAD ELECTRONIC COMMERCE

Checkfree Corporation gave electronic commerce a boost when the
Columbus, Ohio company agreed to acquire software developer Servantis
Systems Holdings Inc., says one analyst.  The deal makes "Checkfree a
more effective player, and whenever you have more than a couple of
players that are capable it pushes things more quickly," observes
David Weisman, senior analyst with Cambridge, Mass.-based Forrester
Research.
     The acquisition of Norcross, Ga.-based Servantis provides the
third leg of the triad that Checkfree has been methodically
constructing, says Michael Sapienza, Checkfree vice president for
marketing.  That triad consists of electronic consumer-, business- and
banking-services.  But until recently, Checkfree was a little wobbly
on both the banking and the business legs.  

Checkfree Alliances Corral the Market

     In a matter of months, Checkfree has gone from a consumer bill
payment service to the dominant presence in electronic commerce,
according to one financial analyst who says, "nobody is even remotely
close to them." 
     Prior to acquiring Servantis, Checkfree's focus was electronic
bill payment and invoicing.  Missing from that strategy were front-
and back-office banking capabilities.  "You need to do all those
transactions between the bank and its customers.  Checkfree never had
a very good solution for that, which is part of the reason that
MasterCard moved on," says Weisman (CORP, Nov. 29, p. 8).
     For almost three years, Checkfree and MasterCard were connected
at the hip.  "We were their exclusive electronic banking and bill
payment service provider and they were our exclusive distribution
channel to financial institutions," explains Sapienza.  But neither
partner was satisfied with the arrangement.
     Since the expiration of the MasterCard deal a year ago, Checkfree
has been aggressively signing up partners.  Milwaukee-based Fiserv
Inc., Automatic Data Processing Inc. of Roseland, N.J., Plano, Texas-
based EDS and Cybercash of Reston, Va., have tightened Checkfree's
hold on electronic bill payments and invoicing.  
     "The amount of resources it takes to do hundreds of thousands or
millions of bill payments makes this an economies of scale game.  And
Checkfree has a lot pumping through it," says Forrester's Weisman, but
he adds the company was still missing a good home banking platform.
     With Servantis, Checkfree not only gets home banking and
corporate cash management products, it also gets MasterCard back.  The
card association aligned with Servantis earlier this year to
facilitate MasterCard's wholesale banking product, MasterBanking.
     "We view the Servantis ... banking transaction processing
business, and its software and mainframe hardware, as being a superior
technical solution to that at Checkfree," says A. Christian Frederick,
Mastercard's senior vice president of remote banking and strategic
planning.  "It is quite evident that Checkfree has validated that
[opinion with this purchase.]"
     How effective Checkfree will be in leveraging its purchase of
Servantis is still an open question.  "How to best integrate the two
companies is something that is not 100 percent figured out yet," says
Checkfree's Sapienza.  Who stays and who goes, for example, will be
decided over the next 30- to 60-days, says Sapienza.  
     Another concern is the role Servantis majority owner Welsh,
Carson, Anderson & Stowe will play at Checkfree.  Because the purchase
deal is being done with both stock and cash, the New York-based
venture capital fund will end up owning more than 20 percent of
Checkfree.  (A. Christian Frederick, MasterCard, 914/249-5525, Michael
Sapienza, Checkfree, 614/825-3026; David Weisman, Forrester Research,

ELECTRONIC COMMERCE PRODUCTS FREQUENT VENDOR RELEASES IN '95

     Electronic commerce and on-line security dominated new product
offerings in 1995 as vendors raced to cash in on growing demand from
banks and corporations for the developing technologies. 
     For instance, Sterling Software of Dallas, and VeriFone of
Redwood City, Calif., joined Visa International of San Francisco and
MasterCard of Purchase, N.Y., in releasing electronic commerce
products last year.  
     Sterling announced COMMERCE:Connection, a suite of products that
includes Windows-based electronic data interchange (EDI) and
translation software (CORP, Dec. 27, p. 8).  Visa and MasterCard
joined forces to support a single, secure specification for bank card
purchases on the Internet (CORP, July, 12, p. 4).  And VeriFone said
it was readying Virtual Terminal software that would replace a
retailer's "grey box" from VeriFone (CORP, Nov. 29, p. 6).  

     Other new product releases in 1995 included:

     *  More Choices for International Clients.  Cut-throat
competition in the states forced many vendors to expand their
marketing efforts overseas.  For instance, Citibank introduced a
European lockbox service that offers multi-currency, multi-country
collections from a centralized facility (CORP, Nov. 15, p. 4). 
Servantis Systems Inc. of Atlanta, installed Spanish language versions
of its PEP and Micro ACH (automated clearing house) applications in
Colombia (CORP, Sept. 20, p. 6).  Also, Chase Manhattan Bank of New
York, teamed with Eurogiro Network to provide Eurogiro customers in
Japan and Europe with cross-border U.S.-dollar checking and ACH
services (CORP, June 28, p. 8).

     *  Automated Wire Transfer Services.  PNC Bank Corp. of
Pittsburgh unveiled a service that allows companies to make payments
to trading partners by transmitting a single file detailing
disbursements and payment method (CORP, Oct. 18, p. 7).  The
Regulatory Assistance Center (CORP, Sept. 6, p. 8) and Western Union
Financial Services International (CORP, Nov. 1, p. 6) of Paramus,
N.J., also introduced enhanced wire transfer services.

     *  Electronic Banking Products.  Many vendors rolled out
electronic banking products in 1995 to tap into growing demand among
banks for the technology.  For instance, Servantis unveiled Bank
Street, a suite of products including Windows- and Macintosh-based
home banking software (CORP, Aug. 23, p. 7).  And US Order of Atlanta
introduced Electronic Merchant Center, which enables merchants to
present monthly bills to customers using the World Wide Web on the
Internet (CORP, Dec. 13, p. 7).  Sprint Corp. (CORP, Sept. 6, p. 5),
Union Bank of San Francisco (CORP, Nov. 1, p. 7), and Visa
Interactive, a subsidiary of Visa (CORP, Nov. 1, p. 7) also introduced
home banking products last year.
