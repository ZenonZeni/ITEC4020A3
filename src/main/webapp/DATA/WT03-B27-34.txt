I wish I could be there with you guys this year instead of back here testing software. Maybe next year. I hope you are all having as much fun as I did last year in CO VII although I really don't see how that is possible.
<P>
Watch those down-hills and I'll see you all again soon.

<b>Cycle for Life</b>
<P>
My name is Curt Simkins and I will be working with the Oregon Chapter of the American Cancer Society in a fund raising effort to help fight cancer.
<P>
This past April I lost my step-father to liver cancer and have had several other family members and friends that have had to face this terrible disease.
<P>
In their spirit of accepting a challenge, I have decided to take part in Cycle Oregon this September, but with an added degree of difficulty.  I will doubling back frequently, and plan to cover 125-150 miles per day in the mountains of northeastern Oregon for a total of 1000 miles for the week.
<P>
My intended goal is to raise $10,000 and I would appreciate your support very much.  Contributions are 100% tax deductable.  You can either sign up on a pledge sheet for a certain amount per mile (1-5 cents/mile) or you can donate a set amount.  Checks should be made out to the American Cancer Society and I will see that you get a receipt.  You can also sign up with me during the ride.
<P>
On behalf of the American Cancer Society I want to thank you very much.

I have always made it a habit to bring 1 golf club with me on Cycle Oregon to take advantage of my other hobby whenever the opportunity arises. This year it looks like there are golf possibilities on days 2, 4, and 6. I think one of my cycling partners is planning to join me. If you'd like to help make a foursome let me know. It would be great to have an entire entourage of club carrying cyclists (6-iron is my choice).

Hey, are there any other riders from either Corvallis or McMinnville, Oregon?  Are there any other diabetics riding in Cycle Oregon?  I'd like to hook up with either at Cycle Oregon or by e-mail before hand.
