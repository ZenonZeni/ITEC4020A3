                10 lbs compost *
               2 lbs Rock Dust *
                2 lbs Alfalfa meal *
                2 lbs Kelp meal or
                Seaweed powder *
     Avoid  high  nitrogen chemical fertilizers1. Spray with  a  liquid
seaweed concentrate such as Superseaweed or spray Nitron A-35 or  Agri-
Gro's  Premier Plant Food or Gardeners Supply Roots Plus. Apply  it  as
often as needed.

<STRONG><H2>Don't Want to Make Your Own Compost?</H2></STRONG>
     Look around your city.  Many cities are making compost these days.
Ask  them what it made from. Avoid ones with sewer sludge unless it  is
clean  of heavy metals, etc.. See if you can spot any places that  sell
compost. Ask other gardeners for a source. Go out into the country side
and  look around there. Always ask them what they are doing with it and
how  they  are   making it. Ask them if they are ex-posing  it  to  any
chemicals  etc. Never assume that anything is as they say  it  is.  Ask
about  how they make it and what goes into it, how long have they  been
making it and so on. These are important questions which you should  be
asking.  Now  a days there are more and more people making and  selling
compost  so  it  should not be hard to find.  Both Nitron  Company  and
Arbico Company sell Compost thru the mail.

                     The Invisible Gardener Says:
   <STRONG><H3>"Avoid Buying Compost made with sewer sludge since it may contain
    heavy metals which can pollute ourselves and our environment."</H3></STRONG>

     Sewer  sludge  can be processed correctly with the end  result  of
good  clean  safe compost2. However studies around the world have shown
that  this  is  not  the  case for most of the worlds  sewer  treatment
plants. Especially in the USA. This is one area that we must look  into
very closely if we are to solve this problem. Thru the use of bacteria,
we can make sewer sludge a safe organic alternative to fertilizers. The
laws are changing rapidly every year.
     We  must  keep close watch over this or it will be a problem  that
will  not  be  easily  resolved.  Do not  believe  it  when  they  (the
manufacturer) say the levels of toxins are below EPA standards.  Insist
that they lower the standards to zero levels. Remember every little bit
of toxin adds up to a lot! Check with the source before you buy it!

 <STRONG><H2> Here are some suggestions of possible sources of
composting materials or compost all ready made:</H2></STRONG>
     Talk with your local restaurant stores especially the natural food
     ones as their vegetables, etc. are organic.Use in your compost.

     Locate  seafood  locations where they either cook them,  as  in  a
       restaurant,  or where they catch them as in a dock.   These  can
       be dried for your compost use.

     I also  suggest  that you collect clam shells etc. as  these  when
       dried  and  crushed make an ex-cellent addition   to  a  compost
       pile.

     Look  for any sources of coffee such as either coffee hulls and or
       coffee grinds,similarly, locate sources of tea, either tea  bags
       or leaf.

     Lumber  yards may also be a good source of material provided  that
       you only use untreated wood products.

     Locate chicken farms, ask for their feathers, and/or egg shells as
       well  as any droppings. Ask them what they are spraying  if  any
       thing.

     Locate  horse  or cattle farms ask if they spray their animals  or
       the manure.

     Look  for an organic mushroom farm. Make sure they are organic(use
       steam instead of chemicals).

     Look for old alfalfa bales.

     Grass  clippings  make an excellent source of  nitrogen  for  your
       compost pile, just make sure its organic (unsprayed).  For  more
       information on compost see compost chapter.



_______________________________
     1Chemical fertilizers, especially those with a high nitrogen  base
such as Urea, do considerable damage to the soil eventually killing off
all  beneficial  bacteria  which then leads  to  you  guessed  it..sick
plants!
     2Using bacteria, toxins can be removed from the soil. This is  the
future  of composting plants and sewer plants. Until then ask questions
concerning your local sewer sludge and what it is being used for. Sewer
sludge  and compost don't go well together. Unless the sewer sludge  is
processed using bacteria, it will contain heavy metals and other toxins
that  will  end up in your environment; that will end up in your  food;
that will end up inside of you!
