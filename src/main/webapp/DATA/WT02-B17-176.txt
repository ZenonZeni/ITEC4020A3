<P>
The biomass power industry will probably never be a vertically
integrated specialty industry, unlike renewable energy industries
in wind, photovoltaics, and low-head hydropower.  The IPPs, utilities,
and engineering and construction (E&C) firms that implement
the technology are unlikely to dedicate all of their resources
to a single fuel or technology, although they will often commit
to a small group of technologies that are competitive in the power
market.  Despite the significant differences that the fuel characteristics
of biomass impose on combustion and conversion technology, boiler
and gasifier manufacturers will offer products that span the fuel
market rather than focus on a dedicated fuel capability.  As a
result, biomass power will be a subset of the power industry with
constituents in each of its major segments.  On the fuel side,
the agricultural interests are likely to present a similar picture
with only a few growers dedicating their total resources to a
single crop.  The constituents for biomass power are likely to
be organizations who see a profitable future for this generation
resource and who have technology that is adaptable to the resource
or project development experience that could give them a competitive
advantage.  In some cases, individual players may make an exclusive
commitment to the biomass option, but they will probably be the
exception rather than the rule.
<P>
<A NAME="2.2"><B>2.2 Components of the Industry</B></A>
<P>
The components of the biomass power industry are depicted in Exhibit 2-1 and include:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Regulated Electric Utilities<BR>
<LI>Independent Power Producers (IPPs)<BR>
<LI>Utility/Industrial Component Manufacturers<BR>
<LI>Engineering and Construction (E&C) Contractors<BR>
<LI>Agricultural Organizations<BR>
<LI>Industrial Users/Producers<BR>
<LI>Regulatory Organizations<BR>
<LI>Feedstock/Fuel Brokers
</UL>
<P>
Organizations in each of the above groups are likely to play a
key role in the success or failure of biomass power both domestically
and abroad.  Shown as a second tier player in the diagram are
the investment institutions/organizations that will be called
upon to finance power projects.  The importance of these organizations
to the acceptance and development of biomass as a power resource
is such that they can be considered on a par with the first tier
players in the decision making for power projects.  Included in
that category of interests are the insurance firms that provide
efficacy insurance for projects.  Without such insurance many
projects would be too risky for investors to underwrite.  The
interests of these groups in the technology are discussed in the
sections that follow, concluding with an evaluation of the role they are likely to play in the development of the resource and implementation
of improved technology in future biomass power stations in the
U.S. and abroad. 
<P>
<A NAME="2.2.1"><B>2.2.1 Electric Utilities</B></A>
<P>
A handful of utilities have built biomass power stations.  These
are mostly smaller utilities such as municipalities, and the stations
are more often multi-fueled facilities rather than dedicated units.
<P>
The utilities are important constituents of the industry because
they represent mainstream users of the technology for bulk power
production at a utility scale.  In addition, many utilities have
experimented or continue to experiment with co-firing wood, municipal
solid waste, and coal.  Their primary interests in the U.S. Department
of Energy (DOE) Biomass R&D program will be the improvement
of the current technologies or the demonstration of the next generation
of technology.  Regulated utilities are required to provide customers
with safe, reliable, and economic service while earning an agreed
upon return on investment.  For biomass power, one of the issues
is the impact on the cost of delivery of economical power from
a resource that is often not located near electric load centers.
 Since wheeling of power through systems at reasonably high efficiencies
is an increasingly  available option to generators, the concern
is more one of access to transmission systems with available capacity.
 Utilities are more likely to support a biopower demonstration
if either can be accomplished through a relatively low capital
retrofit of existing facilities, providing efficiency and reliability
improvements.  A major concern for such retrofits will be the
effect on current permits for the facility.  A review of current
permits triggered by a possible demonstration of new technology
would be a significant risk for the plant owners.
<P>
The utilities are not a homogeneous group, and the subgroups within
the industry have different needs and resources.  The major subgroups
are:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Investor Owned Utilities (IOU)<BR>
<LI>Municipal Utilities<BR>
<LI>Rural Electric Cooperatives<BR>
<LI>Federal Power Authorities
</UL>
<P>
Among these groups, the most active players in biomass projects
are the municipal utilities.  Few of the large investor-owned
utilities (IOUs) yet own biomass-fired facilities, but many are
power purchasers from the IPPs.  This may change as the scale
of biomass power projects increases.  None of the rural cooperative
generators or the Federal Power Authorities have built biomass
power stations.  The capacity growth needs of the smaller IOUs,
the rural electric cooperatives, and the municipal utilities are
well suited to the size of current biomass power facilities. 
However, when larger plants based on dedicated fuel supply systems
(DFSS) and advanced conversion cycles are ready for demonstration
at full scale, the larger IOUs are likely to be the power purchasers
and/or project developers.
<P>
Another possible DOE Biomass Program constituent is the coal-fired
utilities for whom biomass co-firing might represent an attractive
Clean Air Act Amendment (CAAA) compliance option.  The Tennessee
Valley Authority (TVA) has inaugurated a program of assessment
and evaluation for these purposes in cooperation with DOE and
the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI).  In addition, a
set of utilities for which biomass co-firing appears to have merit
was identified in a recent report prepared by Scott Piscitello
and Christian Demeter of Antares for National Renewable Energy
Laboratory (NREL) entitled 'Biomass Co-firing Analysis Summary.'
<P>
In summary, the utilities and their research, development, testing,
and evaluation arm, EPRI, are an important constituent of the
program.  The utilities' interest in the program is likely to
be in near-term technical improvements to the technology.  They
offer the potential for joint venture (cost-shared) retrofit demonstrations.
 They are also the ultimate customer for biomass power technology.
 Whether they build and operate their own plants or purchase power
from the IPPs, they will be key decision makers with regard to
technology acceptance and implementation.  In some ways, they
may be considered to have less at stake than other constituents
since their investment is limited to the facilities they operate.
 Many of these facilities could be converted to other fuels if
economics and other factors indicate it would be prudent to do
so.
<P>
<A NAME="2.2.2"><B>2.2.2 Independent Power Producers</B></A>
<P>
A second key constituent for the biomass power industry is the
IPPs.  The IPPs are similar to the electric utility in that they
will serve as project developers for the industry.  Also, there
are IPPs who already own and operate biomass-fired power plants.
 Along with cogenerators, the IPPs represent the major portion
of today's biomass generation capacity.  Included in this category
are JWP Energy Products, Thermo Electron, HYDRA-CO, and Wheelabrator.  
The independent power project developer segment
is the most diversified in terms of the organizations involved,
ranging from the specialists-companies created solely to develop
for this market-to the many subsidiary companies of the utilities,
E&C contractors, and equipment vendors vying for a piece of
the market.  Many of the subsidiaries operate with a large degree
of independence under the parent organization and are subject
to the same market factors and interests driving the specialists
in the industry.
<P>
Under Title IV of CAAA, independently owned generating plants
with capacities of 25 MW or more will be held to the same sulfur
dioxide (SO2) emission limits as electric utility plants.  However,
emission allowances will not be given to the IPPs (as is the case
with the utilities) and will have to be purchased on the open
market or at emission allowance auctions.  Therefore, IPPs' interest
in the virtually sulfur-free biomass resource should increase
as the regulation's deadline nears (January 1, 2000).
<P>
IPPs are well suited to respond to the utilities' current disposition
towards smaller capacity additions that require modest capital
outlays.  The Public Utilities Regulatory Policy Act (PURPA),
which mandates electric utilities to buy power from independent
producers using renewable sources or cogeneration, sets an upper
limit of 80 MW on the producer's capacity.  This size fits the
capacity addition range needed by many utilities.  This range
also matches the capacities of installed biomass power facilities.
 Thus, there often is a match between the size of plants that
will be constructed by IPPs operating under PURPA, the capacity
additions which the utilities desire, and the size associated
with current biomass resources.  The competitive bid process being
utilized in many states for resource acquisitions is beginning
to affect this market to some degree, increasing the size of many
recent IPP projects.  Scale-up of biomass technology will be more
important as this trend continues.
<P>
Biomass can also be used to cogenerate electricity with process
heat (steam).  This creates opportunities for IPPs to work with
industrial participants (such as the pulp and paper industry or
the wood products industry) who can supply the biomass resource
and also offer a host for the process heat.  An interesting market
for biomass-based cogeneration may be industrial participants
who currently operate natural gas/gas turbine technology.  For
example, the Boise Cascade pulp and paper plant in Fort Francis,
Ontario currently operates an 86-MW natural gas-fired combined
cycle unit.  Biomass gasifiers could be installed at such locations
and coupled to the existing combustion turbines.  
<P>
Underlying the success of the IPP industry is the advantage of
operating under less regulatory burden than the electric utilities.
 Therefore, the IPP is less constrained in their generating technology
options and have a greater ability to take risks and earn healthy
rates of return.  In contrast to regulated utilities, the IPPs
are dependent upon the capital investment markets for project
financing.  More recently, these investors are requiring greater
financial exposure of the developers and other participants in
the projects to ensure their interests in protecting the investment.
 This tends to result in a greater degree of conservatism in site,
resource, and  technology choices for new projects.  This is exemplified
by the current emphasis on natural gas combustion turbine projects.
 For the IPPs to be successful, they will need to work with utilities
to identify locations for projects that can tap into existing
transmission and distribution capabilities and that are near areas
of increasing electric power demand. 
<P>
<A NAME="2.2.3"><B>2.2.3 Utility and Industrial Power Component Manufacturers</B></A>
<P>
The traditional suppliers of utility power generation hardware
are large, well-financed, heavy equipment manufacturers.  Nearly
all have international operations and compete in a global market.
 All of these companies also have product lines and services aimed
at the industrial power market.  In the industrial market, there
are smaller specialty companies who also serve the market.  Some
of these firms, such as JWP Energy Products, may dedicate their
product line to biomass and municipal solid waste (MSW); however,
these firms are the exception.  Nevertheless, the equipment vendors
are important biomass program constituents because they are the
most likely participants in hardware R&D, with a stake in
the advancement of the state of the art.  
Both bubbling and circulating fluidized bed boilers are representative
of state-of-the-art utility boilers capable of handling a wide
variety of biomass fuels.
<P>
Among the larger vendors, there are sufficient resources to support,
through cost-sharing, the DOE R&D program if the corporate
commitment exists.  Those companies that have invested in the
coal gasification option may be inclined to make a serious commitment
to the biomass gasification alternative if they see a strong potential
market and view the biomass conversion option as a hedge on their
investment in developing coal conversion equipment.  For this
reason, the companies involved in coal gasification should be
viewed as potential partners in the biomass power program.  A
similar argument can be made for the manufacturers of hot gas
cleanup equipment.  
<P>
In contrast, the gas turbine manufacturers are less likely to
commit resources to develop a new turbine tailored to biomass
derived fuels.  Manufacturers of turbo-machinery designed for
the low-Btu gases supplied by coal will likely already have a
product for the biomass gasification process.  However, the fuel
of choice for the foreseeable future is natural gas, and motivation
to invest in alternative fueled turbine development is nil.
<P>
<A NAME="2.2.4"><B>2.2.4 Engineering and Construction Contractors</B></A>
<P>
Often power equipment manufacturers, such as General Electric,
Westinghouse, and ABB Combustion Engineering, take on the role
of E&C contractor.  In other situations, companies are dedicated
to E&C and are not involved with component manufacturing (e.g.,
Black & Veatch, Stone & Webster).  In either circumstance,
electric utilities and IPPs rely on E&C contractors for large
tasks that may be beyond the responsibilities they wish to bear.
 For this reason, the E&C firms must be kept abreast of, and
involved with, the Biomass Power Program.  The most important
of these firms' capabilities is turnkey services, in which they
are responsible for coordination of feasibility, design, procurement,
construction, start-up, and operation.  Some of these firms even
assist in financing.  Often the contractor can supply some or
all of these individual services in addition to the coordination.
 Due to the similarities between biomass power technologies and
more traditional technologies (e.g., biomass IGCC/coal IGCC similarities),
E&C contractors can easily make the transition to the biomass
power industry.  In fact, several manufacturers, including Babcock
& Wilcox and Foster Wheeler, have already provided turnkey
services at biomass-fired facilities, generally for the pulp and
paper and sugar processing industries.
<P>
<A NAME="2.2.5"><B>2.2.5 Industrial Users and Cogenerators</B></A>
<P>
The wood products industry and pulp and paper mills have used
biomass fuels on a broad scale for process heat and self generation.
 PURPA brought in a new set of players building biomass-fired
cogeneration systems supplying industry with process steam and
electricity, and also feeding power back to the grid as a qualifying
facility.  However, the primary objective of the mills is to dispose
of the unused byproducts; heat and power generation are generally
secondary benefits.  With the trend in the industry toward waste
minimization and alternative uses for unused byproducts of higher
value than fuels, the availability of these sources will tend
to decrease in the future.  For the cogeneration project developers,
the number of attractive sites with hosts for process steam have
dwindled.
<P>
Currently the wood products industry is the primary supply source
for biomass fuels for power projects.  That role is expected to
continue throughout the 1990s.  The importance of this group to
the development of biomass power is probably its knowledge of
large scale feedstock production, transportation, processing and
handling systems, and its holdings or rights to large areas of
potential feedstock production,  which might give it a competitive
advantage in entering the production phase of the business.  Nearly
all of the major businesses involved in the wood and paper products
industry have had power generation experience including Georgia-Pacific,
Boise-Cascade, and Weyerhaeuser.
<P>
<A NAME="2.2.6"><B>2.2.6 Biomass Fuels and Fuel Feedstocks</B></A>
<P>
The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has ongoing programs
that are looking at specialty crops for biomass fuel production;
for example, rapid growth poplars and switch grass, and has signed
a Memorandum of Understanding with DOE to pursue these programs
jointly.  Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) has a current project
focused on the development of a biomass fuels model that can project
resource availability based on plant type, soil characteristics,
water availability, climate, and other characteristics.  However,
from a less technical viewpoint, what also needs to be investigated
is to what extent current agricultural subsidies and allowances
will enhance or slow the transition by the agricultural sector
to biomass fuel crops.  It may be appropriate to look in detail
at the economics of biomass fuels production to insure the resource
availability at a cost-competitive price.  The analysis should
consider the environmental costs as well as the national/regional
economic benefit of relying on a domestically produced fuel. 
These economic benefits would include an increase in jobs, reduction
in energy imports, and an increase in federal, state, and local
tax revenues. 
<P>
<A NAME="2.2.7"><B>2.2.7 Regulatory Agencies</B></A>
<P>
The decisions of the regulatory agencies affect nearly all aspects
of power production and can be pivotal in the development of the
biomass power industry.  A favorable view toward the environmental
and economic benefits of biomass power could lead to changes in
the competitive bidding process and integrated resource planning
(IRP) being instituted in most states in the U.S. and potentially
in foreign jurisdictions as well that might give biomass a competitive
advantage.  Equally, an unfavorable ruling on biomass environmental
impacts could hurt biomass projects across the board-permitting,
competitive bidding, cost of construction and operation, and generation
efficiency.  Generally, regulatory agencies will not champion
technology or resources, but they certainly have the power to
influence resource choices by penalizing the perceived negative
impacts of specific resource and technology choices.  From this
standpoint, DOE cannot afford to ignore the information needs
and technical concerns of the regulatory bodies.  In effect this
may be an important way in which the Biomass Power Program can
assist industry toward near-term implementation of biomass projects.
 The degree of objectivity shown by DOE in presenting its lab
and field test findings with respect to biomass power technology
will have a profound affect on their acceptance by the regulators.
 A number of regulatory agencies at the national (EPA) and local
(e.g. South Coast Air Quality Management District, CA) level have
R&D resources for evaluation of environmental characteristics
of new energy technologies and could be contributing partners
in the Biomass Power Program.  A number of the PUCs nationwide
have been or are in the process of commissioning analytical studies
of the use of environmental adders (externalities) in the resource
selection process and other important refinements to the IRP process.
