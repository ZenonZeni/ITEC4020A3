<B>The new truth.</B> 
<P>
Satellite data are objective. Satellite data are acquired, transmitted
and archived by machines. No human editing, biasing or censorship
is involved in the data acquisition stage. Each pixel is an objective
measurement of the condition of the surface of the Earth. The
data coding the relative brightness in each waveband for each
pixel are collected systematically in space as well as in time
with a census sample; ie. complete coverage of the surface of
the Earth. It is only in the final stage of interpretation that
subjective interpretation occurs. That presents no problems. If
you and I disagree about the interpretation of a satellite image
in this book, that is healthy and good for science. We can differ
only about our interpretation and not about the data. The data
that we both use, the image, remain the same. Satellite data are
objectively acquired and there are enormous volumes of it. Within
the national satellite archives in Canberra, there are approximately
250 Landsat MSS images of every pixel of the Australian continent
since mid-1972.
<P>
There is a very great contrast between the systematic, objective
measurement systems onboard satellites and the assessment and
monitoring of our environment that people do. Our assessment is
subjective rather than objective and it is based on a very small
sample in comparison with the complete 'wall-to-wall' coverage
of satellite imaging systems. The greatest disparity is in the
way in which we humans monitor the world around us compared with
what can be achieved using satellite data. Our archive of what
the world was like is our memory. Our memory, our operational
archive, is, unfortunately seriously flawed in its creation and
fallible in its retrieval. We selectively remember things in the
first instance and then do not always recall all relevant information.
As an archive, we are biased and forgetful. These failings shape
our lives because we are what we remember. That is the nature
of human beings; a nature that is the product of the way we have
evolved during the last million years or so.
<P>
It is a characteristic of our behaviour to react to rapid or episodic
change in preference to slow and monotonous change. It's far easier
to occupy ourselves with the daily micro-hassles of life than
with changes occurring over the longer term. Our social, political
and economic lives are dominated by the now rather than the critically
important future. This domination is largely dictated by our media
that, with words, images and skill, force our concentration on
daily trivia, eg. a knee operation for a football player, while
completely ignoring the long term changes, such as the relentless
increase in the atmospheric concentration of chlorofluorocarbons
(CFCs) and greenhouse gases.
<P>
Now, bearing all of these points in mind, we can ask a simple
yet important question: If you wanted to discover what was really
happening to your world, which archive would you tap? Would you
use the collective human memory? This archive we know to be familiar
but neither objective, complete or systematically updated. Or
would you rather access a database that has it all there? A database
of objective measurements, not subjective impressions, that was
made systematically in space and in time?
