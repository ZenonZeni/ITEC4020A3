</p>

<p>IX. MARIJUANA LEGISLATION CLASHES WITH JUDICIAL SKEPTICISM AND
EMERGING VALUES - PIECEMEAL JUDICIAL RESPONSE: 1965-1970<br>
</p>

<p>The dramatic increase in marijuana use during the latter
1960's and the consequent increase in prosecution1 were matters
of high public visibility. Judicial response at both the trial
and appellate levels was influenced by a combination of powerful
forces, none of which had been present in the preceding years.
The 1960's saw a revolution in the law of criminal procedure, and
in few areas were police practices more suspect than in the
enforcement of the drug laws. The latter part of the decade
witnessed widespread dissent against the political and legal
systems; this protest milieu gave an added dimension to marijuana
use as more and more people smoked, oftentimes overtly, in order
to defy a seemingly ignorant law. Faced with this unusual
conjunction of widespread political and social eccentricity, the
courts-institutional protectors of political deviants-were
inevitably pressed into institutional sympathy for social
deviants. A third force was the revitalized judicial interest in
the value of privacy in a highly automated, technological
society; more and more people went to the courts to question
longstanding governmental prohibitions against essentially
private decisions and acts-homosexuality, abortion, contraception
and drugs. Together with the well-publicized medical skepticism
about the soundness of the nation's drug laws, particularly those
regulating marijuana, these forces moved the courts to scrutinize
enforcement practices and consider a new wave of constitutional
objections to state and federal marijuana legislation.<br>
</p>

<h2>A. Multiple Offenses: Untying the Statutory Knots</h2>

<h3>1. Federal Developments<br>
</h3>

<p>In the major decision during this period, the United States
Supreme Court voided the federal provisions most often employed
to prosecute the possessor (buyer) of marijuana. In the first arm
of Leary v. United States,2 the Court held that the Fifth
Amendment relieves unregistered buyers of any duty to pay the
transfer tax and to file the written order form as required by
the Marihuana Tax Act.3 The Court reasoned that, since filing
such a form would expose a buyer to liability under state law,
under the occupational tax provisions of the Tax Act, and perhaps
under the marijuana provision of the Import and Export Act,4 the
filing provisions violated the fifth amendment guarantees against
self-incrimination. On the other hand, the Court held in a later
case that the fifth amendment does not relieve the marijuana
seller of the duty to confine his sales to transferees who are
willing to comply with the order form requirements.5 Similarly,
the Eighth Circuit recently held6 that Leary does not compel
invalidation of Tax Act section 4755(b), which prohibits the
interstate transportation of marijuana, because a conviction
under that section is not really a conviction for falling to
register and pay the occupational tax and, even if it were,
registration under section 4753 is not necessarily incriminating
as was the written order form requirement struck down in Leary .7
</p>

<p>The second arm of Leary reversed the long line of decisions8
upholding the presumption of knowing concealment of illegal
importation arising from possession under section 176a of the
Import and Export Act.9 The Court held that, in light of the case
with which marijuana was domestically cultivated and the number
of users, the presumption of know1edge could not rationally be
drawn from possession.10 it could not be said &quot;with
substantial assurance that the presumed fact [knowing concealment
of illegally imported marijuana] is more likely than not to flow
from the proved fact [possession] on which it is made to
depend.&quot;11 Although there is authority to the contrary,12
the Ninth Circuit has held this part of Leary retroactive,
thereby invalidating all prior Section 176a convictions in which
the defendant did not admit knowledge and the was instructed as
to the applicability of the statutory presumption .13 </p>

<p>A serious dispute remains as to what the Government will have
to prove in subsequent prosecutions under section 176a. Assuming
that the entire provision does not violate the privilege against
self-incrimination,14 it is likely that the prosecution will have
to prove actual knowledge of illegal importation in the future.15
Since it is highly improbable that such proof will be
forthcoming, section 176a has probably been rendered useless as
applied to possessors. It should be clear that the entire series
of decisions under the Tax Act and section 176a has an air of
unreality about them because Congress probably has Article I
power directly to prohibit possession and sale of marijuana and
has now exercised that power in the Comprehensive Drug Abuse
Prevention and Control Act of 1970.16 This new legislation,
although stopping short in some respects, discards many of the
fictions perpetuated by earlier legislation. The Leary decision
was at least partially responsible for forcing Congress to
rationalize the federal role in the drug field, particularly with
respect to marijuana. </p>

<p>Another manifestation of judicial dissatisfaction with the
extreme nature of existing drug legislation is the apparent
reversal of the trend of decisions upholding the strict liability
of one-time drug offenders, users and addicts for failure to
register when leaving the country.17 The Ninth Circuit held the
phrase &quot;uses narcotic drugs&quot; unconstitutionally
vague.18 Taking a more direct approach, the Second Circuit found
knowledge of the registration requirement to be an element of the
crime.19 Thus construed, the statute precludes any due process
challenge to the sufficiency of the notice.20 Although a
self-incrimination issue remains, 21 the Second Circuit's
decision removed the most serious defect in the statute, one that
had become intolerable as the number of marijuana convictions
escalated in the late 1960's.<br>
</p>

<h3>2. State Developments<br>
</h3>

<p>The erosion of the archaic federal criminal statutes for
marijuana-related offenses has been accompanied by a similar,
albeit limited, development on the state level. The major issue
in state litigation concerns so-called &quot;drug-proximity&quot;
offenses which are generally employed as plea-bargaining tools or
to prevent the release of a suspect when evidence was 1 illegally
seized or when the evidence is insufficient to secure a
conviction under the substantive drug offense. Typical ancillary
offenses are loitering in the common areas of a building for the
purpose of unlawfully using or possessing any narcotic drug;22
loitering in public by a user, addict or convicted drug offender
without lawful employment;23 presence in an establishment where
narcotic drugs are dispensed;24 and presence of a user or drug
offender in a private place where drugs are kept.25 </p>

<p>The decisional trend seems to point to the unconstitutional
vagueness of simple loitering and vagrancy statutes.26 Because of
the nexus between narcotics and crime, however, the courts are
struggling to redefine narcotics-proximity statutes to avoid the
vagueness objection.27 It might appear that where &quot;good
account&quot; provisions give the arresting police officer too
much discretion the statute will fal1.28 On the other hand,
courts generally avoid vagueness objections based on lack of
notice by reading in knowledge elements wherever neccssary.29
Because of the tenuous relation between marijuana and crime, the
courts should construe &quot;narcotics&quot; in such statutes not
to include marijuana. </p>

<p>Similar restriction of marijuana-related offenses has been
accomplished by holding that charges of possession and sale will
not both lie where the only possession is incident to sale,30 and
by tightening the requirements of specificity in the indictment
regarding the proscribed parts of the plant.31 </p>

<h2>B. Procedural Objections to Enforcement Practices<br>
</h2>

<p>The law of criminal procedure underwent a major revolution in
the 1960's. The Bill of Rights was applied piece by piece to the
states through the fourteenth amendment. The Supreme Court
focused its concern on protecting the rights of the criminal
defendant. The earlier philosophy had been that, so long as the
defendant's rights at trial were guaranteed, the Court should
not, and did not need to, intrude into the pretrial stages of the
criminal process. For a variety of reasons it became clear in the
1960's that in a system where between 75 and 90 percent of all
defendants bargain and enter guilty pleas, rights must be assured
well before trial if they are to have any real meaning to the
average person caught in the net of the criminal process. Thus,
step by step the Court began to regulate police practices-search,
arrest and interrogation techniques-and the conduct of the early
stages of the criminal process. This substantial change in
attitude meant that more marijuana defendants could successfully
raise procedural objections.<br>
</p>

<h3>1. Search and Seizure<br>
</h3>

<p>The most important development for the marijuana offender has
been the close judicial scrutiny of police searches as a result
of Supreme Court rulings under the fourth amendment. More
stringent standards have been established for the police to
obtain search warrants32 and the proper scope of searches
incident to a lawful arrest has been narrowed substantially. 33 </p>

<p>Although courts have refused to exclude any evidence that was
in plain sight when seized, such as a bag of marijuana in a
school satchel voluntarily opened by a student,34 or marijuana
thrown out of window by a defendant trying to dispose of it,35
they have narrowed the permissible time and area in which a car
may be searched .36 </p>

<p>Moreover, the difficult standing problem posed by the
requirement that one had to admit possession or ownership of the
seized property in order successfully to challenge the search was
alleviated in cases involving group arrests by permitting all
those on the premises to challenge a given search.37 </p>

<p>The new requirements for procuring search warrants led to a
number of technical defense victories. For example, searches of
defendants' residences were successfully challenged in two
Montana marijuana cases38 because the warrants were issued by a
justice of the peace, rather than by a district judge, as
required by the state law. These holdings were premised on the
sanctity of private residences, and they suggest a growing
reluctance to countenance &quot;reasonable&quot; warrantless
searches, especially of the home. Similarly, Maryland struck down
the fruits of a search of defendant's guests and their
automobiles on the ground that the permissible search was limited
to the areas described in the warrant.39 An Illinois court has
held that property not included in the warrant must be returned
to the defendant.40 This return to a more stringent view of
particularity requirements of warrants stands in stark contrast
to the willingness of courts to overlook these requirements in
the late fifties.41 </p>

<p>Likewise, courts now scrutinize more closely police claims of
probable cause for expanding the area of the search. A California
court held that even though defendant was lawfully arrested,
search of his luggage in a friend's apartment was justified
neither by the friend's consent nor by the officer's having seen
the defendant swallow something.42 The search was especially
unjustifiable since the defendant had been arrested in his
automobile. In another California case, the presence of peculiar
odors did not constitute probable cause for the search of a
footlocker.43 </p>

<p>An airline had detained the footlocker since it corresponded
to a police description. The officers had smelled the marijuana
and then searched the footlocker before sending it on its way and
tracing it. The California Supreme Court held that the smell
alone was not sufficient cause to search without a warrant. </p>

<p>Despite judicial narrowing of the scope of searches with or
without a warrant, the easing of the standing requirements, and
the closer scrutiny on the probable cause issue, courts continue
to permit police to enter dwellings without knocking or by force
where circumstances indicate such action is reasonable and
necessary. For example, a California court upheld a marijuana
search, even though the police entered without knocking, because
the police heard people running around inside yelling, &quot;It's
the police,&quot; and thought they heard a shot fired.44 The
court held that the statutory knocking requirement was subject to
exception when there was danger of destruction of evidence and
danger to the police. Closely related to no-knock entry is
forcible entry, upheld in an Illinois case45 where the police
broke into the defendant's residence when he did not immediately
respond to their knocks. The necessity for forced entry is
essentially the same as for unannounced entry, but forced entry
adds the danger of causing fright and damage. </p>

<p>Another search area that has not been substantially
liberalized is that of the border search. Customs officials have
a much more extensive right to search than their police
colleagues. Mere suspicion is sufficient to justify a border
search.46 Even though the jurisdiction of customs agents ends
once entry into the country is completed,, the courts have
allowed border guards great discretion in determining what
constitutes completed entry. In Thomas v. United States.47 the
Fifth Circuit held admissible evidence seized an hour and a half
after the appellant had entered the United States because he was
only six blocks from the border. Although there is an inevitable
problem of how far the jurisdiction of the customs agent extends,
Thomas suggests c1early that it is not limited to border
crossings. <br>
</p>

<h3>2. Entrapment</h3>

<p>Although the majority opinions in Sorrells v. United States48
and Sherman v. United States,49 remain the leading statements on
entrapment, some courts have recently permitted expansion of the
defense. In California a defendant may plead not guilty and still
raise the entrapment defense in some cases. The court in People
v. Perez stated: </p>

<p>To compel a defendant to admit his guilt as a condition of
invoking the defense of entrapment would compel him to relieve
the prosecution of its burden of proving his guilt beyond a
reasonable doubt at the risk of not being able to meet his burden
of proving entrapment.50 </p>

<p>The defendant must, however, still raise the defense at trial
to be determined as a matter of fact by the jury.51 There is no
right to raise the defense in a pretrial motion to suppress the
evidence.52 Most courts continue to focus on the moral
culpability of the accused53 in determining whether or not
entrapment has been successfully shown. Recent Arkansas,54 and
Nevada55 cases, however, suggest that the courts are increasingly
concerned about the conduct of law enforcement agents, especially
in marijuana cases.<br>
</p>

<h3>3. Other Prosecution Practices</h3>

<p>Several major abuses, although judicially recognized, remain
largely uncorrected. Long delay between offense and arrest is
common in narcotics offenses because the police desire to expose
the full extent of distribution and to maintain a cover for the
undercover agent as long as possible. Yet any substantial delay
prejudices the defendant since the prosecution continues to
gather evidence while the defendant may forget exact
circumstances and possibly exculpating facts. Judicial response
has been inconsistent, focusing primarily on the purposefulness
of the delay.56 In light of the recent rejuvenation of the speedy
trial requirement by the Supreme Court,57 there is some hope that
this abuse may be corrected. </p>

<p>A more serious abuse with which state and federal prosecutors
have been charged is politically-motivated discretionary
enforcement.58 Although the courts can do little to remedy this
state of affairs, it forms the basis for one of our basic
contentions: The political-social overtones of the marijuana
problem may inhibit a rational political and prosecutorial
response and at the same time may provoke a protective judicial
response. One judge, particularly expert with regard to
contemporary drug problems acknowledged the partial truth of the
charges of political prosecution against Hippies, long-hairs and
draft-card burning college students.59 To the extent that other
trial and appellate Judges recognize these prosecutorial
tendencies, we can expect some judicial compensation either in
fact-finding, in sentencing, or in response to substantive
challenges to the law. It is our contention, of course, that such
judicial reaction has already begun.<br>
</p>

<h3>C. Sufficiency of the Evidence</h3>

<p>The ease of identifying marijuana in conjunction with the use
of uncorroborated testimony and circumstantial evidence continues
to require of the prosecution only a very low burden of proof.
Nevertheless, appellate decisions are gradually beginning to
tighten these requirements, and active judicial hostility at
trial has all but disappeared. </p>

<p>Although the use of uncorroborated testimony to convict
continues to be upheld by the courts,60 an Illinois appellate
court has reversed a conviction because of the behavior of the
testifying officer.61 Noting that the officer had repeatedly
pressured the defendant to become an informer, the court held
that the uncorroborated testimony of this officer was not
sufficient to support a conviction. The court did not make clear
whether it exercised a weight of the evidence review of the trial
judge's fact-finding, or whether it applied an exclusionary
evidence rule pursuant to its inherent powers over the
administration of criminal justice. Whatever the case, judicial
perspective in the clash between marijuana defendant and police
officer has clearly shifted. </p>

<p>The amount of marijuana required to uphold a conviction is
undergoing substantial change. The California Supreme Court held
in People, v. Leal62 that to be sufficient for conviction, the
amount of narcotics must be enough for sale or consumption, the
rule generally applied where the statute does not specify a
minimum quantity.63 In Eckroth v. State64 a Florida court ruled
that the taking of a drug from a passing pipe is not sufficient
to constitute possession where the defendant did not own the
pipe, the drug or the premises. Similarly, in a case that
received national publicity,65 the Minnesota Supreme Court field
that if the state defines marijuana as a narcotic, it cannot
punish possession of what could be native cannabis in amounts too
scanty to produce a &quot;narcotic&quot; effect. Accordingly,
exiguous traces of the drug found in the crevices of defendant's
brief case left in his mistress' car did not constitute an amount
sufficient for conviction .66 </p>

<p>Other problems remain unsolved. Circumstantial evidence
continues to link defendants to seized marijuana. Constructive
possession was found where the defendant's daughter was the
actual possessor67 and the fact that marijuana was found where an
informer said she had seen defendant smoking it the previous day
was sufficient to support the defendant's conviction.68 There is
a split as to whether a conviction can be upheld where the
defendant gratuitously brings the buyer and seller together.
Massachusetts upheld the conviction for possession where the
defendant's only contact with the marijuana was passing it to the
state's agent,69 ruling that the facilitation of the sale added
enough to the act of passing to allow the court to find
possession. In a similar case, however, a New York court held
that there was not present the required involvement or concert of
action to uphold a conviction for sale.70 Nevertheless, courts
have refused conviction on numerous occasions in which the
defendant was not linked exclusively with the marijuana that was
found71 and have generally required an outside linking factor
before upholding the possession.72 However, the element that can
tip the scales in favor of conviction is often unrelated to the
possible possession of the marijuana. For example, a California
court73 upheld the finding of possession of marijuana discovered
along with a purse the defendants had stolen. The defendants
contended that the marijuana was not theirs and must have been in
the purse when stolen. That the defendants were thieves probably
played more heavily in the conviction than any evidence of their
connection with marijuana. </p>

<p>Where marijuana is found on the premises of the individual,
possession is presumed, although the courts have read in a
defense of ignorance of the presence of the marijuana.74
Nevertheless, in a New Hampshire case75 the court upheld a
possession conviction premised on the defendant's knowledge of
presence of the drug on the premises even though the court
apparently believed the defendant's story that it belonged to a
third party. Ordinarily there is direct corroborating evidence to
indicate the defendant's knowledge.76 </p>

<p>Along with the gradual thaw on these points in state courts,
the late sixties witnessed a total absence of the outrageous
judicial participation in inflammatory statements about the
dangers of the drug and its users which we saw was typical of the
late fifties. To the contrary, the appellate opinions, at least,
are replete with skeptical references to the inclusion of
marijuana in the narcotics classification .77<br>
</p>

<h3>D. Sanction</h3>

<p>Nowhere has judicial disenchantment with the drug laws,
especially marijuana, been greater than in the area of
punishment. Preference for civil treatment of drug abuse,78
disgust with severe mandatory sentencing that deprives the
Judiciary of its traditional function of weighing the culpability
of the individual offender, 79 and skepticism about a statutory
scheme which catches the user or small scale distributor and
misses the major trafficker80 have all found their way into
judicial opinions. </p>

<p>This dissatisfaction with legislative inaction in the area of
de-escalating punishment has already begun to provoke remedial81
judicial action. In a landmark decision82 receiving national
attention,83 the Supreme Court of New Jersey recently held that
any prison sentence imposed for first-offense possession of
marijuana for personal use &quot;should be suspended,&quot;84
While the court based its holding on the judiciary's statutory
authority to suspend sentences in &quot;the best interests of the
public as well as of the defendant,&quot;85 and on the appellate
court's power to review for abuse of discretion trial court
sentencing decisions, it appears that the true locus of the
opinion is the Eighth Amendment. That is, the court really
determined that any prison sentence for first-offense possession
of marijuana for personal use is unreasonably excessive.
Accordingly, the decision will be discussed in more detail in the
following section.86<br>

<p>3 Although Leary involved only the concealment and
transportation provision, 26 U.S.C. § 4744 (a) (2) (1964), the
Eighth Circuit has held, correctly, that Leary also covers the
acquiring provision, § 4744(a) (1), &quot;since a person
obviously would have to acquire the marijuana to knowingly
transport or conceal it.&quot; United States v. Young, 422 F.2d
302, 304 (8th Cir.), cert. denied, 398 U.S. 914 (1970). </p>

<p>4 Because the &quot;danger of incrimination under state
law&quot; was &quot;so plain,&quot; the Court did not pursue the
additional question of a buyer's exposure to liability under the

the Fifth Amendment is not violated by the insubstantial hazards

<p>8 See p. 1086, supra </p>

<p>9 Anticipating the Leary decision on the § 176a presumption
was United States v. Adams, 293 F. Supp. 776 (S.D.N.Y. 1968). </p>

<p>10 395 U.S. at 52 53. Having found the &quot;knowledge&quot;
presumption unconstitutional, the court avoided consideration of
the &quot;illegal importation&quot; presumption. Id at 38. The
knowledge presumption has also be held invalid as applied to
hashish. United States v. Maestri, 424 F.2d 1066 (9<sup>th</sup>
Cir. 1970) ; cf. United States v. Cepelis, 426 F.2d 134 (9<sup>th</sup>
Cir. 1970) (remanded for factual determination as to whether
Leary applies to hashish.) </p>

<p>In Turner v. United States, 396 U.S. 398 (1970), the Court
upheld the presumption in 21 U.S.C. § 174 (1964) (direct
ancestor of § 176a as applied to heroin but declared it
irrational as applied to cocaine. It has been held that Turner is
retroactive, United States v. Vallejo, 312 F. Supp. 244 (S.D.N.Y.

<p>13 United States v. Scott, 425 F.2d 55 (9th Cit. 1970). We
think the Ninth Circuit is right, at least with respect to
convictions secured after marijuana achieved high public
visibility in the 1960's. Since the number of people still
incarcerated for earlier convictions is minimal, complete
retroactive effect is in order. Essential to the Leary decision
was a determination that the presumption was factually
unsupportable; it therefore constituted a material flaw in the
fact-finding process and seriously impaired the right to jury
trial. </p>

<p>14 Absent the written order form requirement of the Marihuana
Tax Act, we do not see how prosecution under § 176a involves the
fifth amendment at all. Neither did the Ninth Circuit. Id. at 61.
</p>

<p>15 See United States v. Martinez, 425 F.2d 1300 (9th Cit.
1970); McClain v. United States, 417 F.2d 489 (9th Cit. 1969). A
mere inference of importation is clearly not enough to sustain a
conviction since it would nullify Leary. Cf. United States v.
Ramos, 282 F. Supp. 354 (S.D.N.Y. 1968) (where Government failed
to prove possession beyond reasonable doubt, court could not
infer knowledge of importation). It is difficult to see how the
Government could raise an inference of knowledge without proving
actual knowledge. If, however, such can be done, it is clear that
the defendant has a right to prove that the marijuana was not
imported. United States v. Espinoza, 406 F.2d 733 (2d Cir.),

Struggling to confine its holding, the court distinguished an
apparently contradictory case, United States v. Eramdjian, 155 F.

<p>27 In People v. Pagnotta, 25 N.Y.2d 333, 253 N.E.2d 202, 305
N.YS.2d 484 (1969), the New York Court of Appeals upheld a
statute making it illegal to loiter about any &quot;stairway,
staircase, hall, roof, elevator, cellar, courtyard, or any
passageway of a building for the purpose of unlawfully using or
possessing any narcotic drug.&quot; The court distinguished the
ordinary vagrancy and loitering cases on the ground that the
conduct punished in the narcotics vagrancy statute is directly
related to the commission of crime against others: </p>

<p>[P] rotection of innocent citizens from drug users is a very
crucial problem. As has recently been pointed out by several
newspaper articles, in some of our poorer urban areas where drug
use is high, innocent citizens are often beaten, robbed and even
murdered by drug addicts .... It is completely reasonable and
proper for the Legislature to protect these citizens from
accidentally stumbling into the midst of such miscreants in the
common areas of buildings. </p>

<p>47 372 F.2d 252 (5th Cir. 1967). The customs agents had
searched the defendants belongings at the time he had entered the
country arid had not discovered the marihuana and heroin he
possessed. They came into town and searched the defendant when
they were notified by an informer that he was carrying the
contraband. </p>

<p>6062 Cal. 2d 769, 776, 401 P.2d 934, 938, 44 Cal. Rptr. 326,
330 (1965). The decision overturned a long series of precedents.
That all justices concurred is indicative of the sentiment for
change. The court required the prosecution to disclose the
identity of the informant because he was essential to the
defenses of entrapment and lack of knowledge. The decision was
immediately implemented in People v. Marsden, 234 Cal. App. 2d
796, 44 Cal. Rptr. 728 (Dist. Ct. App. 1965). There, defendant
was repeatedly requested to furnish marijuana to a government
agent and finally purchased and gave the agent one marijuana
cigarette. The court noted that the case was close to entrapment
as a matter of law. </p>

<p>54 Peters v. State, 450 S.W.2d 276 (Ark. 1970). Here the
defendant gave some marijuana free of charge to the agent after
repeated requests. The marijuana had been left in the defendant's
shop by others. In remanding the case for consideration by the
jury whether entrapment existed the court stated: </p>

<p>Perhaps, neither the persistent solicitation, the use of an
alias, the misrepresentation of the purposes for which [the
agent] wanted to acquire the marijuana nor the use of friends of
appellant for an entree, standing alone, would have been
sufficient to raise a fact question as to entrapment, but when
taken together along with the total lack of evidence that [the
defendant] had possessed or sold marijuana before, there was such
an issue. Id. at 278. </p>

sufficient, enough to make a very small cigarette); People v.
Hokuf, 245 Cal. App. 2d 394, 53 Cal. Rptr. 828 (Dist. Ct. App.
1966) (reversible error for the court not to instruct the jury
that fragments of marijuana cannot support conviction). But see
Franklin v. State, 8 Ind. App. 134, 258 A.2d 767 (1969) (heroin),
in which the court upheld a conviction for possession where the
defendant went to the hospital with an overdose. Although
recognizing that once the drug is inside the body there is no
possession because there is no control, the court felt that prior
possession and self-administration could be inferred. The
decision should do much to discourage addicts from receiving any
medical treatment that might expose them to criminal penalties. </p>

<p>79 See, e.g., United Sates v. Kleinhalzer, 306 F. Supp. 311
(E.D.N.Y. 1969) (Weinstein, J.); Oliver, supra note 59, at 230: </p>

<p>In most other areas of the law, however, legislatures have
freely granted judges the power and discretion within quite
flexible limitations, to determine appropriate sentences for all
particular defendants before them that may or may not, dependent
upon the particular case, include commitment to a penal
institution. . . . </p>

<p>In the field of drug abuse, quite contrary to that experience,
mandatory prison sentences apparently reflect a legislative
conviction that all drug offenders are so alike that sending all
to prison is, in fact, a real solution to what must have been
viewed as a relatively simple problem. They also seem to reflect
a certainty and righteousness that can hardly be said to be
justified by our present scientific knowledge. </p>

<p>80 For example, in Aguilar v. United States, 363 F. 2d 379 (9<sup>th</sup>
Cir. 1966), the court affirming the smuggling conviction of a
Mexican mechanic driving a car containing marijuana back to the
United States, noted: </p>

<p>Here was a young man with a previous clean record, and there
was no indication he was a user of narcotics or inside a
narcotics ring. Apparently he was a victim of his personal
economics. When the law gets no closer than this to the real
rascal, one must wonder about the policy of it, although it be
beyond our function. </p>

<p>Id. at 381. See also Oliver, supra note 59, at 233 </p>

<p>81 What Justice Jackson said about adjudicative mood when the
death penalty hangs in the balance is equally appropriate with
regard to harsh marijuana penalties: </p>

<p>When the penalty is death, we, like state judges, are tempted
to strain the evidence and even, in close cases, the law in order
to give a doubtfully condemned man another chance. </p>
