Additional Dosages in Canada</b> </font></h3>
<p align="center"><font size="4"><strong><i>Shareholders Set to
Vote on DRAXIS Exchange Offer for DAHI Shares</i></strong></font></p>
<p><strong>OVERLAND PARK, KANSAS, October 31, 1996 --</strong>
Deprenyl Animal Health, Inc. (NASD Bulletin Board: DAHI; TSE:
DAH) today announced that Canada's Health Protection Branch,
Bureau of Veterinary Drugs (&quot;HPB&quot;), has approved the 10
and 30 milligram dosages of the veterinary pharmaceutical
Anipryl&#174;, indicated for treating canine Cushing's disease.
The full complement of Anipryl&#174; dosages makes it easier and
less costly for Canadian dog owners to comply with once-daily
administration.</p>
<p>As a result, DAHI expects broader acceptance of the
pharmaceutical, which is marketed through Canadian veterinarians. </p>
<p>In addition, the HPB has approved new packaging for
Anipryl&#174;. It will now be available to pet owners in a
convenient 30-day blister package that improves the daily
administration and compliance of the pharmaceutical. The full
range of Anipryl&#174; dosages now approved in blister packaging
include 2, 5, 10, 15 and 30 milligrams.</p>
<p>Deprenyl Animal Health, Inc., developed Anipryl&#174; for
veterinary applications. DRAXIS Health Inc., headquartered in
Mississauga, Ontario, holds exclusive Canadian rights to
Anipryl&#174;.</p>
<p>In July, 1996, DRAXIS announced a friendly offer to acquire
the outstanding shares of Deprenyl Animal Health, Inc., that it
does not currently own at an exchange rate of 1.35 DRAXIS shares
for each outstanding DAHI share. The proxy materials related to
the exchange offer were mailed to shareholders of both companies
earlier this week. DRAXIS shareholders will vote on the offer
November 25, and DAHI shareholders will vote November 26. </p>
<p>Draxis currently owns 44 percent of the common stock of DAHI.
In addition, DRAXIS holds convertible debt which, if converted,
would increase DRAXIS' ownership to 52 percent.</p>
<p>DAHI has submitted trial data on Anipryl&#174; for two
indications, in two jurisdictions. In September 1995, DAHI
submitted a new animal drug application with the U.S. Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) to market Anipryl&#174; for canine
Cushing's disease in the United States.</p>
<p>Canine Cushing's disease is a degenerative condition that
affects older dogs and if left untreated is ultimately fatal.
Symptoms include loss of house training, excessive thirst,
reduced activity and a &quot;pot-bellied&quot; appearance. There
are approximately 150,000 new cases of canine Cushing's diagnosed
annually in the U.S. and 15,000 in Canada. </p>
<p>In addition, DAHI has filed with Canada's Health Protection
Branch, Bureau of Veterinary Drugs, for approval to market
Anipryl&#174; to treat cognitive dysfunction. DAHI is completing
U.S. clinical trials for cognitive dysfunction, and expects to
submit an application to the U.S. FDA during the second quarter
of 1997. </p>
<p>Cognitive dysfunction, also known as senility or old dog' s
syndrome, is an Alzheimer's-like disease afflicting geriatric
dogs. At least 1.5 million new cases of cognitive dysfunction
occur each year in North America. </p>
<p>Draxis is a marketing and research company that operates
Canadian neurological and dermatological pharmaceuticals
divisions, a U.S. consumer marketing company, and offers products
exclusively through U.S. podiatrists. </p>
<p>Deprenyl Animal Health, Inc., based in Overland Park, Kansas,
was founded in 1990 to develop animal health applications for
Anipryl&#174;. The company is also identifying other animal
health product opportunities to become a multi-product animal
health pharmaceutical company.</p>
