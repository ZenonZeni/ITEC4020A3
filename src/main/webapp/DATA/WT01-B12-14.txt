 <IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HISTORY </H2>
<P>In 1928, Albert Szent-Gyorgyi isolated vitamin C from citrus and other sources. It helped prevent scurvy, but results were not consistent. He later isolated bioflavonoids, which he called vitamin P. He blended the two together and called the mixture "citrin."  This mixture was more reliable but still inconsistent.</P>
 <P>   Then in 1947, Professor Dr. Jack Masquelier, working at the University of Bordeaux began solving the puzzle.  The French government asked him to research the possible toxicity of the red pigment in peanut skins. The agricultural authorities wanted to know if the residue from peanuts being fed to livestock was toxic because some of the animals did not like to eat it.   He showed the red substance was not toxic and while studying it, isolated the first proanthocyanidins or OPC's ever identified. As a matter of fact, his Ph.D. thesis was about this research.  It shed light on the colorless OPC's that had a vascular protective effect greater than Szent-Gorgyi's citrin. The OPC's were different from the yellow colored bioflavonoids isolated earlier.</P>
<P>    In  1948 and in  1951, Masquelier registered his first patents. They described his method of extracting OPC's from peanut skins and pine bark.  In later patents, Masquelier described methods to obtain OPC's from grape seeds. Most importantly, his 1987 U.S. Patent No, 4,698,360 granted the exclusive right to use OPC's as antioxidants to protect the body "against the harmful biological effects of free radicals."</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> TERMINOLOGY</H2>
<P>    Dr. Masquelier's extract contains individual units called catechins. The catechins, which occur individually, are called monomers. When they are linked together in pairs, they are called "dimers" and when in three's, "trimers." In 1979, he named the mixture "pycnogenols" from the Greek "pycno" meaning to "thicken or condense," "gen" meaning "to generate " and "ol" from their chemical name.</P>
<P>   The dimers and trimers are referred to as oligomeric proanthocyanidins.  "Oligo" is from the Greek meaning "a few" or "more than one but not many. " "Pro " means "before," "precursor" or "produces," and "anthoCyanins" are the red compounds that the proanthocyanidins change into when fruit ripens, flowers mature or leaves turn.</P>
<P>    "Oligomeric ProanthoCyanidins'' is abbreviated "OPC," They are found in most plants, are highly bioavailable and are active in the body as tremendous antioxidants and free radical scavengers. OPC's are chemically classified as flavanols and are present in red wines, flowers, leaves, fruits, berries, nuts, sorghum, beans and hops with high concentrations in skins, barks and seeds. The most feasible commercial source is the seeds of grapes and the bark of the French Maritime Pine.</P>
 <P>   Technically speaking according to Masquelier, OPC's are really not bioflavonoids.   OPC's are "flavonols" while bioflavonoids are "favonoids." While the chemical structure of their core molecules is the same, flavonols and flavonoids actually have more differences than similarities. OPC's are colorless, bioflavonoids are yellow. OPC's are water soluble, bioflavonoids are relatively insoluble.  Flavanols, including OPC's, are always made up of polymers of one compound called "flavan-3-ol", while bioflavonoids are made up of many different compounds with a "flavane" nucleus.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> FORMULATION</H2>
 <P>  All  Life  Plus  PROANTHENOLS  products  are formulated exclusively with Dr, Masquelier's OPC-85, a scientific blend of extracts including grape seeds and French Maritime Pine Bark, under protection of U.S. Patent No. 4,698,360, assuring today's standard of excellence in proanthocyanidins. Up to 25% of OPC extract consists of monomeric precursors, the building blocks of OPC. In grape seed extract, these precursors are known as catechins and epicatechins. Pine bark extract contains catechins and taxifolin. Every plant species has its own unique precursor mix. Blending both grape seed and pine bark extracts combines all their monomeric precursors. The two together provide a broad spectrum, creating a more complete storehouse of OPC building blocks. On their own, these precursors are inactive and short lived. However, catalyzed by the presence of OPC, they become active and "unfurl" their own unique biological benefits rendering the blend richer in total activity.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> POWERFUL ANTIOXIDANTS</H2>
<P>    Free radicals are incredibly destructive. They damage our cells, which can mean premature aging, reduced immune function, inflammation and ultimately degenerative disease. Our primary defense is antioxidant nutrients, of which the most well known are vitamins C and E. The biological activity of antioxidants is enormously important to our health. OPC's, or proanthocyanidins are the most powerful antioxidant free radical scavengers known to man.  They are as much as 50 times more potent than vitamin F and 20 times more than vitamin C. OPC's are major protectors of collagen, the basic foundation our blood vessels and all connective tissues such as skin, ligaments around joints and tendons.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> PHYTOZYME BASE</H2>
<P>   All  PROANTHENOLS products are formulated in the proprietary Life Plus PhytoZyme tablet base.  PhytoZyme base is a unique combination of concentrates containing numerous phytonutrients from over thirty different plants. When you take Life Plus products, you receive the added benefit of many natural  phytochemicals.    Each  formula  contains  these synergistic  nutrients  for  the  natural  health  supporting phytonutrients and other micronutrients they contain.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> SUGGESTED USE</H2>
<P>    Most individuals take 1 mg of OPC's per pound of body weight per day. For example, a 100 lb person would take 100 mg per day. This equals one HP 100 mg tablet or two Regular 50 mg tablets. Most take more the first week. Children and adults under 100 lbs take 100 mg per day. The HP formula is the most cost effective and convenient.  It is common to take more for specific needs.</P>



 
<P>Suggested Use:  Usually one mg. of pycnogenol per pound of body weight per day for seven days, 
thereafter 50 mg per day.</P>
