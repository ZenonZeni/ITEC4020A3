<p><b>Scope of the Problem</b></p>

<p>A small and definable number of Americans suffers from severe
mental illnesses, or brain disorders. In any given year, about
2.8 percent of adults in the U.S., or five million Americans,
have brain disorders, including schizophrenia, panic disorder,
obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), bipolar disorder
(manic-depressive illness), and major depression. </p>

<p>Fortunately, although there are no cures, there are impressive
success rates for treating symptoms of severe forms of brain
disorders. Schizophrenia has a 60 percent treatment success rate;
panic disorder has a 70 percent to 90 percent treatment success
rate; OCD has a 75 percent treatment success rate; bipolar
disorder (manic-depressive illness) has an 80 percent to 90
percent treatment success rate; and major depression has a 70
percent to 80 percent treatment success rate.</p>

<p><b>Prevalence of Brain Disorders vs. Other Medical Illnesses </b></p>

<p>Brain disorders affect a much smaller proportion of the
population than do many other physical illnesses. For example,
cardiovascular disease affects 18 percent of the population --
nearly six times as many Americans as those who have brain
disorders.<sup>4</sup> </p>

<p><b>Costs of Treating Brain Disorders</b> <b>Are Comparable to
Many Other Medical Illnesses </b></p>

<p>The total cost of treating cardiovascular disease was $160
billion, while the total cost of treating five brain disorders
was $148 billion in 1990. (These costs include both direct
treatment costs and indirect costs, such as lost productivity and
excess morbidity and mortality).<sup>4</sup> </p>

<p>The cost of treating each person with a brain disorder is
comparable to the cost of treating many other medical conditions.
For example, the cost in 1990 of treating a person with severe
diabetes was $7,725 annually, vs. $7,158 for treating a person
with schizophrenia.<sup>4</sup> </p>

<p>In Texas, a state where parity health insurance exists for
state employees, the total cost of treating state employees and
their families with brain disorders was one-fifth ($6.5 million)
the cost of treating cardiovascular diseases ($30.5 million). In
1994, 12,233 people were treated for cardiovascular disease at an
average cost of $2,496, vs. 4,617 individuals who were treated
for brain disorders at an average cost of $1,424.<sup>9</sup> </p>

<p><b>As an Increasing Number of People Get Treatment, Overall
Costs to Society Will Decrease </b></p>

<p>Studies indicate that if only 80 percent of the people with
brain disorders sought treatment, the overall costs to society
would be reduced by $2.2. billion.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Specifically, two-thirds of premature deaths
        (approximately 128,000) would be averted, restoring $5.2
        billion in lost lifetime earnings to the economy.<sup>4</sup> </li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>There would be a ten percent reduction in use of general
        medical care by people with brain disorders. This would
        reduce costs by $1.2 billion.<sup>4</sup> </li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>Costs associated with morbidity, the criminal justice
        system, social welfare, and incarceration would also be
        reduced if only 80 percent of individuals with brain
        disorders received appropriate, adequate treatment.<sup>4</sup> </li>
</ul>
