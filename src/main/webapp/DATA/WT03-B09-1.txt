'94 CTD cases continue trend, jump 10 percent
CTDs as a percent of all injuries and illnesses also increase.


Cumulative trauma disorders continued to ravage U.S. workplaces by
growing 10 percent in 1994, refuting predictions by private industry
that CTDs would slow or decrease.
The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported in December "repeated
trauma" cases logged by private industry in 1994 totaled 332,000, up
from 302,400 in 1993. The BLS numbers are collected from the
Occupational Safety and Health Administration 200 logs, which employers
are required to complete when an injured or ill worker requires more
than cursory medical treatment.
Not only did the number of repeated trauma cases increase, but so did
their percentage of the overall injury and illnesses recorded by U.S.
business. CTDs now account for about 5 percent of the nation's 6.8
million nonfatal injuries and illnesses in 1994, up from 4.5 percent in
1993.
George Brogmus of Liberty Mutual Research Center for Safety and Health
had predicted the rate of increase for workplace CTDs would slow down or
decrease. His findings were based on Liberty Mutual numbers and BLS
statistics showing the CTD claims and CTDs cases as a percent of all
claims and cases.
"They aren't in the same pattern I reported," said Brogmus. "However,
the growth rate (the change from one year to the next) is still not as
high as it has been in previous years." 
Three-fifths of all the new repeated trauma cases come from the
manufacturing sector, according to the Survey of Occupational Injuries
and Illnesses, 1994. Meatpacking and knit underwear plants recorded the
highest incidence rates while motor vehicles and car bodies and poultry
slaughtering and processing logged the most repeated trauma cases.
(The incidence rate represents the number of injuries and illnesses per
100 full-time employees times 200,000.)  
Repeated trauma also accounted for nearly two-thirds of the workplace
illnesses. Skin diseases and disorders ranked second with 13 percent.
"We are gravely concerned about the growing number of new cases,"  said
Cheryl Bryne, OSHA's spokesperson. She would not speculate on what the
new numbers meant to the agency's attempt to produce an ergo standard.
Congressional conservatives have stymied attempts by OSHA to publish and
conduct research on a proposed ergonomics standard. This effort has been
part of an overall antiregulatory agenda that has been successful in the
House but mixed in the Senate.
In the spring, the BLS will release survey results detailing the
worker's occupation, nature of the injury or illness and how the injury
or illness happened.

Big, small firms show how ergo programs make cents
2nd 'Best Practices' issue stresses cost savings, CTD cuts


Now, more than ever, the efficacy of ergonomics and ergonomics programs
is being scrutinized by company presidents and financial officers.
Ergonomics efforts not showing measurable savings often are frozen or
cut.
As a result, practical information detailing ergonomics interventions,
costs and savings continues to be a commodity in high demand and the
basis for CTDNews' 2nd Annual Best Practices issue.
Once again, we chose the featured companies after surveying U.S. and
Canadian corporations, ergonomics consultants, labor organizations and
health and safety associations and researchers.
This year, CTDNews' ergonomics honor roll includes Ford Motor Co. of
Dearborn, MI; Charleston Forge of Boone, NC; Holloman Air Force Base
near Alamogordo, NM; and Avenor Inc. of Thunder Bay, Ontario, Canada.
The variety of problems addressed and savings realized should be useful
for an equal variety of businesses. Through these four companies, the
value of formalized ergonomics programs to homemade quick fixes
illustrates the impact of ergonomics on the workplace.
Each of these companies agreed to provide information about the genesis
of its ergonomics programs and the pitfalls they encountered while
implementing and maintaining the program. They also volunteered some
details on the health and safety costs of doing business.
While the thirst for program costs and savings is great, many companies
generally do not provide complete financial information for many
reasons, including fears that some details could be used against them in
workers' compensation lawsuits or that it would give their competitors
an advantage in the marketplace.
In any case, company officials quoted have agreed to share their
experiences and results with anyone interested in more information.
Telephone numbers are provided.

California expects heated debate over new ergo rule


Although the newly proposed California ergonomics standard is only 1 1/2
pages, there apparently is plenty to talk about as state officials
prepare for two public hearings later this month.
This is the second attempt at a standard since the state Occupational
Safety and Health Standards Board unanimously turned down Cal/OSHA's
proposal in November 1994. 
The new proposal would take effect when a musculoskeletal injury to more
than one employee has been "diagnosed and objectively identified" within
the last 12 months. Worksite evaluations, hazard control and training
are included in an ergonomics program.
The proposal also includes three simplified worksheets to assist in the
program's development.
Scaled down from the original 26-page proposal, the Standards Board's
effort will impact about 14,000 businesses. No financial impact was
given since "costs can vary widely and are dependent on the steps that
have already been taken to reduce repetitive motion injuries."
Public hearings for the first proposal drew more than 1,000 comments and
public demonstrations by organized labor. 
Hearings are scheduled for Jan. 18 at 9 a.m. at the Airport Marina
Resort Hotel in Los Angeles and Jan. 23 at 9 a.m. at the Sacramento
Convention Center.
-  For more about the hearings or proposal, contact the OSH Standards
Board at 916-322-3640.

Charleston Forge welds homemade approach


Charleston Forge doesn't have a textbook ergonomics program. However,
its approach works in reducing cumulative trauma disorders and in
increasing worker productivity without sacrificing the company's
finances.
By conducting basic workstation surveillance and consulting with local
medical and physical therapy experts, the manufacturer of decorative
home and office steel furniture dramatically reduced ergonomic-related
injuries  --  and increased workers' productivity and efficiency.
The firm's lost days from carpal tunnel syndrome, back strain and other
CTDs have been cut to zero this year, down from as many 176 lost
workdays in 1991.
"Some of the fixes, specifically equipment purchases, have been very
high dollar," said Jo Spiceland, Charleston Forge's human resources
director and safety and environmental compliance officer. "But, we
didn't make the changes just for ergonomics reasons. Increased
productivity played a major role."
Spiceland said the company's productivity increased by about 25 percent
in three years.
Charleston Forge of Boone, NC, employs about 150 people and is located
about 85 miles west of Winston-Salem. 
In manufacturing steel furniture, employees must carry, shape and cut
20-foot lengths of steel in various shapes and sizes, weld the pieces
into products and pull or carry the finished products that weigh as much
as 150 pounds to finishing, painting and the shipping area.

Carpal tunnel main CTD

Because of the fine and repetitive handwork involved in many of the
plant's jobs, Spiceland said carpal tunnel syndrome and tendinitis had
become serious problems. "The company's owner saw the inefficiencies of
the old (manufacturing) system and knew about the carpal tunnel problems
we were having.
"So the decision to make changes wasn't difficult," continued Spiceland.
"Also, money has not been a big roadblock due to the success of the
company. We knew we had to improve the process to decrease CTDs and to
increase productivity."
In addition, many workers throughout the plants have suffered back
strains from handling the products.
The problem-solving approach in the early 1990s included encouraging the
"buddy system," according to Spiceland. Employees were told not to lift
anything beyond their capability. Limited job rotation was used. The
company also provided back belts to interested employees, conditional
upon the worker attending a seminar on proper body mechanics and lifting
techniques. Spiceland said back belts are rarely used now.
With cases of CTDs and lost workdays due to CTDs failing to decline,
Charleston Forge enlisted the help of a local physical therapist and
loss-control representatives from the company's workers' compensation
insurance carrier. After several walk-through visits, they recommended
fixes for specific jobs.

Changes start in 1993

"In 1993, we began to make specific fixes, without really forming a
formal program," said Spiceland, who spends only about 10 percent of her
time addressing ergonomics concerns. "We were a small company with
managers wearing many hats. A formal program will come, but there
haven't been the human resources or time available to devote to it yet."
Spiceland said her knowledge of job evaluation came from seminars and
from becoming familiar with OSHA's proposed ergonomics standard.
The finishing area was one of the first to be fixed. For example, once a
baker's shelf made of steel has been welded together, employees with
pneumatic wire brushes removed burn marks and welding splashes and then
washed the product. At one point, 25 people spent eight hours a day
wire-brushing and washing them.
The risk of carpal tunnel and tendinitis has since been eliminated by
automating the process through the purchase of an enclosed shotblaster
machine, which is similar to a sand blaster, to polish the steel. The
company also purchased an automatic washing system. Now, only three
people spend two hours a day brushing. Exposures to carpal tunnel
syndrome and back injuries (from awkward postures) were greatly reduced.
Also, in this and other areas in the plant, improved lighting placement
and brightness has decreased many of the awkward postures required to
inspect and brush the products. These combined to greatly reduce
exposures to CTS and back injuries.
Spiceland said automating this part of the process did not cause the
company to lay off anyone. Instead, these employees now operate the
washing and shotblaster machines or work in other departments.
The consulting physical therapist also targeted the welding operation.
Employees placed parts in a fixed jig or template for each of the
company's products. Many workers had to stretch, turn and assume awkward
positions to place all the parts into the jig and then remove them after
welding.
As a result, Charleston Forge made many of the jigs adjustable. Some
tilt to make the product easier to remove. This change reduced many of
the back problems for the company's 20 welders. Even though workers use
a handheld welder, Spiceland says it has not posed any problems because
it is light and without vibration.
"The welders were purchased before we had a real awareness of CTDs. We
were just fortunate that the welders had these features," Spiceland
said.
Ergonomic changes, aside from the shotblaster and washing systems, have
cost the company about $3,500. This includes the training and purchase
of back belts and labor and materials for jig adjustments and lighting
improvements.

Problems still present

While the company has made significant gains in many areas, others such
as packaging and moving the product out the door still pose challenges.
The product is pulled along the floor to several stations by hand. There
are no wheels on any of the products. 
Currently, employees lift the products into cardboard boxes and those
boxes are then moved to trucks by way of hand trucks.
The physical therapists and physicians, who provided their ergonomics
consultations free of charge, have recommended the company buy hoists to
eliminate the problem. But, Spiceland said, the cost for hoists is
prohibitive because of the large area involved.
Instead, they're trying a less costly approach. "We tried a
propane-powered shrink wrap system that would have reduced the amount of
lifting involved in packing our products. However, the results were
disappointing.
"Shrink wrapping slowed our packaging time from about 1 1/2 minutes per
item to almost seven minutes," Spiceland said. "We're experimenting with
other interventions now."
Spiceland said the company also has the capabilities to make a lot of
tooling, and tends to look to homemade solutions.

Informal problem solving

She uses an informal team approach to resolving problem jobs.
Spiceland, an engineer, the employees and supervisor put their heads
together when the need arises to come up with the interventions.
Charleston Forge's approach is even more unique because employees
undergo almost no ergonomics training. But, Spiceland admitted, when the
company added another shift in 1994 and hired about 40 new workers, "We
learned the hard way that we didn't do enough training and supervision,
and we're paying for it in workers' compensation premiums."
The company is developing a thorough training program for supervisors
and employees of which ergonomics and basic safety will be major
components.
For small companies wanting to encourage a healthier and more productive
workforce, Spiceland strongly recommends developing a working
relationship with local health professionals and utilizing their
expertise. 
Because the physical therapists and physicians were local health
professionals, they already were aware of Charleston Forge. Their
services had been used numerous times to treat workers' compensation
injuries.
"I simply asked them if they could help us reduce our CTD risk. I didn't
really ask for anything beyond specific interventions," said Spiceland.
"When I approached our local health professionals, they were eager to
share their knowledge and experience to improve our workers' health and
comfort," she said.

Ford: Where quality, ergonomics combine
Automaker's program suited for even small,financially strapped companies


There's a recurring theme in the occupational safety and health
community: larger companies  --  like Ford Motor Co.  --  are more successful
at eliminating workplace CTDs than many smaller companies with limited
resources.
With billions in resources, unfortunately, "bigger doesn't mean better,"
according to Bradley S. Joseph, Ph.D., a Ford corporate ergonomist. 
"As a practice, we cannot throw resources and people at a problem. We
believe in transferring technology and information to people who can use
it best. Smaller companies can do the same," said Joseph, whose company
has spent about $35 million in industrial ergonomics interventions in 60
manufacturing and assembly plants since 1990.
Despite what Ford is spending on ergonomics interventions, the U.S.
Bureau of Labor Statistics reports motor vehicles, car bodies and
vehicle part and accessories record the most "repetitive trauma" cases.
Instead, Ford's size requires considerable advanced preparation for a
standardized ergonomics program for all of its U.S., Canadian and
Mexican plants. This strategy   --  including devoting considerable
resources to planning and recordkeeping  --  has its long-term rewards.

Commitment the key

"Much of an ergonomics program's success is based on the plant's
commitment  --  everyone from the plant manager down to hourly workers,"
said Joseph. "Without the time and effort to determine who you are and
what you want to do, the results cannot be as good."
By that, Joseph means securing the support of management and labor to
ensure the ergonomics program's and committee's legitimacy. If the top
officials from both sides cannot be full-time committee members, then
invite them to all meetings, ask for their help and let them be the
first to hear about successes.
Beyond the management and labor commitment, Joseph emphasized the
importance of making the ergonomics process inclusive and plantwide.
"A program is likely to be more successful if the ergonomics process is
a team effort. Don't outsource (the ergonomics decision making) to third
parties like consultants or put it into the hands of a plant ergonomist
only. This focuses the responsibility on an individual, not a team,"
said Joseph.
But what about the small company that doesn't have the expertise or
money to hire an ergonomist to help with the program?
"Some of the best programs are run by people without traditional, formal
ergonomics and health and safety knowledge. They know  --  better than me  -- 
how the plant works," Joseph said. "But they do need training, knowledge
of ergonomics and to know when to seek help." 
Ford's ergonomics process, developed by the United Auto Workers-Ford
National Joint Committee of Health and Safety and the University of
Michigan, recommends an ergonomics committee of eight people  --  four each
from labor and management. These members receive basic training in
ergonomics principles, techniques for job evaluation, recordkeeping and
monitoring and refining the process.
Once assembled, the committee members must write a mission statement to
ensure each member understands the goal(s) and has the same purpose. In
addition, the ergonomics process guide also recommends committee members
be released from regular assignments to attend ergonomics committee
meetings and accomplish tasks. There should be meeting agendas and
minutes to emphasize the work's importance.
(See "Making the mission possible" on this page for key elements to a
mission statement.)

Not just costs

"Money is very important for plant operations. Cost-benefit analysis
must be used to justify changes," said Joseph. "Ergonomics can be
implemented using traditional cost benefits. But you have to balance it
with the social aspects of health and safety and what's correct to do."
On average, the committee solves 20-30 ergonomics problems a year. Of
the 60 plants the company currently is tracking, about 7,200
ergonomics-related problems have been fixed since 1990  --  1,067 between
January and June 1995.   
Standardized recordkeeping includes detailed ergonomics concerns logs,
intervention tracking and follow-up worksheets. Joseph said, "We don't
want one plant to differ greatly from another even though they are
hundreds of miles apart."
(See examples of Ford's worksheets)
"That way if one Taurus assembly plant is having a workstation problem
on the assembly line, they could check with another Taurus plant to see
if its ergonomics concern logs showed a similar problem and how it was
resolved," continued Joseph.
 Ford's preparation is illustrated best at its new Cleveland engine
plant. Eighteen months ago, the company finished rebuilding an engine
assembly plant designed with ergonomics in mind.
For example, the local committee designed machine tools to allow easy
access to metal cutting blades. Articulating arms were added when the
machines were designed to eliminate exposure to extended reaches and
back and shoulder stress.
Another example was installing a roller conveyor system to bring parts
closer to operators. The new system eliminated lifting and carrying of
parts.
To date, there have been no ergonomics-related injuries. The local
ergonomics committee has responded to four concerns logged in the first
six months of 1995 and spent about $17,000.

Benefits of proactive changes

Compare those numbers to Ford's other Cleveland engine plant, where
changes have been made to the existing assembly processes. The logs show
seven concerns, costing about $200,000 over the same time period. This
shows how much more cost effective it is to make change during the
planning stages.
Although the company has dramatically reduced its cost for ergonomics
intervention in the modern plant by being proactive, problems still
exist. Joseph said the local ergonomics committee is responding to them.
The committee is examining how workers install spark plug and
distributor wires. Workers are exposed to repetitive, high-force pinches
with awkward wrist postures. The company has joined forces with the
University of South Florida to resolve the problem. 
But few companies have the wherewithal to gut factories and redesign
manufacturing processes. For those, Ford often has relied on homemade
solutions. In the Sharonville Transmission Plant in Sharonville, OH,
employees were having to carry a 35-pound clutch about 10 steps to the
assembly line and insert it into the transmission housing. They also
were required to walk back to parts bins and pick up several other
components to be installed in the housing.
Outside equipment vendors recommended hoists or articulating arms, but
because the clutch mechanism easily separated, it really had to be
installed by hand.

Homemade remedy

As a result, the local ergonomics committee developed a portable
workstation on wheels that would carry all the parts  --  for more than one
transmission  --  on a tray with rollers and Lazy Susans. The workers then
would bring all the transmission components to the assembly line and
avoid the repetitive lifting and walking back and forth.
The company also has utilized plastic part kits in the assembly process
to reduce excessive reaching, bending and turning. At Ford's Van Dyke
Plant in Sterling Heights, MI, transmissions move through some of the
assembly process on a pallet with these plastic kits  --  which hold about
20 parts  --  atop the assembly fixture. The kits are made of molded
plastic so each part is separated  --  like the plastic packing in a
multipart child's toy  --  and easy to reach. Workers no longer turn around
and reach for parts in bins behind them.
In addition, to make the assembly process more comfortable, the assembly
line was raised about nine inches and a composite floor of recycled
tires was installed to provide cushion and relieve strain and stress on
the back.
At some Ford plants, the decision to change a job depends on analysis of
existing data, informal reports from workers or proactive
identification. For example, workers' compensation costs and lost work
time are calculated for specific health hazards and then multiplied by
four to cover any hidden costs.
"Many times, that number is more than the cost of the change and is
approved," said Joseph. "Other changes are harder to justify and other
methods of analysis or justification may be required."
Ford's accomplishments are attributed to the partnership between labor
and management and the preparation and experience of the local
ergonomics committee, according to Joseph.
The keys to building a similar process are not proprietary information.
Indeed, Joseph said, "There's no need for other companies  --  big or small
 --  to try and reinvent the wheel."

Holloman's effort defies expectations


Defying a perception that the federal government can do nothing
inexpensively, Holloman Air Force Base has successfully implemented
ergonomics changes on a shoestring budget.
The changes, instituted over two years, dramatically cut the number of
CTD-related injuries through assessments, job modifications, some new
equipment and training.
"The administrative and engineering changes represent the 'gold
standard' OSHA was looking for," said Major Alan Berg, commander of the
49th Aerospace Medicine Squadron and base ergonomics manager. "We got
rid of our injuries and showed that the civilian industry doesn't have
to worry quite as much" about the prospects of an ergonomics standard.
The improvements started after Holloman Air Force Base, near Alamogordo,
NM, was inspected by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration
in August 1992. An employee reported the base to OSHA. Four months
later, Berg and the base received a 22-page citation under the general
duty clause and an order to fix a variety of ergonomic hazards within
one year.
The base employs over 6,000 military and civilian personnel in support
of the F-117A "Stealth" aircraft and associated training requirements.
The shop inspected by OSHA performs survival equipment maintenance,
sewing operations and parachute packing. Parachutes were either for
personnel, aircraft braking systems (drag chutes) or heavy equipment
(drone chutes), which can be up to 120 feet in diameter and weigh over
150 pounds.
In the parachute shop, OSHA noted ergonomics hazards related to
inadequate lighting, poorly designed workstations and awkward, forceful
body positioning affecting the back and arms. Specifically, OSHA focused
on tasks that required excessive lifting, bending and repetitive arm
motions.
"Over a four-year period (1990-1993), we had 15 people with confirmed
CTD cases. And the shop employs only 25," said Berg. "These were not
weak or small people. At one point (spring of 1993), 11 out of 19 people
were on limited duty because they couldn't do the more stressful jobs."
But more than just fixing the one shop that OSHA had inspected, Berg
wanted to be proactive and develop a program that would address
ergonomic stresses throughout the base.
"To address all those problems and set up a base-wide ergonomics
program, I needed more than a year," Berg told CTDNews. "OSHA agreed to
postpone the deadline so long as the base was pursuing a comprehensive
ergonomics program."

Where to find help

Without a national ergonomics standard, Berg found the assistance and
direction to create an ergonomics program from OSHA's "Guidelines for
Establishing Ergonomics Programs in Meatpacking Plants." "I had no
problem convincing my superiors that we needed to make changes," Berg
quipped. "I just used the four-letter word, O-S-H-A."  
Seriously, he added, "When I showed them the impact of ergonomic
problems in this one shop, I received full support from the commander on
down to the workers to make changes happen."
So in 1992, Holloman established an ergonomics committee to identify
workplace ergonomics stresses from injury logs, evaluate high-risk work
areas and prevent future injuries. The committee consists of
representatives from civil engineering, aerospace medicine, maintenance,
ground safety and others.
It operates with no annual budget, but used safety and health promotion
funds to purchase literature and video training programs. Actual
improvements in the shop, including tool purchases, came out of the
shop's operating funds.
Focusing first on the parachute shop, Berg set into motion a series of
workplace changes that would reduce dramatically the CTD-related
injuries. Many of the interventions in the shop's sewing operation were
basic and low cost.

Basic, low-cost changes

Traditional scissors were replaced with spring-loaded models to reduce
some repetitive motion. Electric scissors that cut through five layers
of the heaviest fabric were purchased to reduce repetitions. Sewing
tables and table edges were padded. Task lighting was provided with
adjustable arm desk lamps. And to address OSHA's recommendation to
provide adjustable table heights, Berg directed that tables be raised to
accommodate taller workers and that inexpensive, plastic stair-step
platforms be bought to make the job easier for shorter workers. 
Storage space was moved from underneath work tables to separate shelving
units, eliminating some bending and lifting.  To reduce lifting and
hauling, they relocated some packing operations closer to where the
chutes are stored. Electric lift tables with wheels were added to permit
easier movement of parachutes and to eliminate the vertical component of
lifts and carries.
Electric hoists replaced a hand-over-hand pulley operation used to hang
wet parachutes in a drying tower. Workers had been experiencing shoulder
and back discomfort that was totally eliminated by the mechanization of
the job. 
Yet, the actual chute repacking remains Berg's most daunting
intervention. Employees with steel bats weighing over 20 pounds must
repeatedly pound the folded chute into its container. A worker took
about 45 minutes to pack a single chute, with the entire shop packing
about 500 per week. With the limited duty of many shop workers, the
remaining workers had to pack as many as 50 in a week.
Attempts at reducing the pounding operations included pneumatic tools
and complex overhead suspension systems. But efforts either damaged the
parachute material or failed to pack it properly. Job rotation was
nearly impossible with the limited number of workers physically able to
perform the packing operation.
With no real alternative to the packing process, Berg decided to reduce
the workload and convinced supervisors to limit the employees to packing
no more than 20 per week.  
Additional parachutes were purchased to buffer the need to repack them
quickly during surge flying operations. The workers also found relief as
a change in aircraft landing procedures halved the number of drag chutes
used. The shop now packs about 250 chutes per month.
Berg hasn't given up on the idea of mechanizing the pounding operation
which he calls, "ergonomic enemy number one." However, with the packing
limit, he now has all but one worker returned to full duty.
Considering that some of these workers had performed these jobs for over
twenty years, many of them were resistant to the changes. Some claimed
the changes would make the job harder. "But I asked them to go along
with the changes for two weeks," said Berg, "after which the workers had
the option to go back to the old way. But they liked the new ways, once
they got used to them, and reported less leg and back soreness at the
end of the workday." 
The changes in the parachute shop cost about $25,000. 
The Holloman Ergonomics Working Group's program includes an educational
component to teach workers that awkward posture plus forceful
repetitions equals risk of CTDs.

A positive message 

"The message was delivered in settings that encouraged worker
participation," said Berg. "And once trained, we found that the workers
who know their job best are the greatest resource for simple ways to
improve the workplace."
The training takes two to three hours and focuses on giving workers the
ability to identify ergonomic stresses in their workplaces, share their
findings with their supervisors, and work together to fix them
themselves. High- and moderate-risk workers are required to attend the
training, but it is open to all base personnel.
Supervisors can request the Holloman Ergonomics Working Group to visit
their shop to help in assessing and resolving ergonomically stressful
jobs.
The base program also includes an occupational medicine program to
monitor workers in high-risk jobs. Workers are examined at least
annually by a physical therapist who can suggest ways to modify how
workers do their jobs and can develop individualized exercise programs
to build up a worker's strength.
For the parachute shop, active-duty military personnel are mandated and
civilians are invited to participate in an exercise program as part of
their duty day.
"The biggest concern in U.S. business and industry is that an ergonomics
standard will close businesses," said Berg. "I tell people that ideal
ergonomic solutions come when you don't think of Fred Flintstone with a
hammer and chisel, but instead you think of George Jetson, whose total
job is to a push a button.
"But it could cost millions," continued Berg, "to totally mechanize a
workplace, so the goal is to find reasonable solutions in a
cost-effective manner."
Other ergonomics problems addressed around the base included letting
each of the base telephone operators pick out ergonomically designed
seating and giving aircraft maintenance workers sit/stand workstations
and adjustable chairs.
In all, Holloman AFB spent about $50,000 to implement its program over
three years, according to Berg.  As a result of these efforts, the base
dramatically reduced its CTD exposure. An unexpected benefit was a
series of certificates from the U.S. Department of Labor acknowledging
it for valuable contributions in the promotion of occupational safety
and health programs in the field of ergonomics.

Avenor's fitness a warm-up to ergonomics


Avenor Inc. sees its 10-year-old employee fitness programs as the
important warm-up to its newer ergonomics campaign. The two work in
concert, much the way cardiovascular exercise goes with a stronger and
healthier heart.
The results: The pulp and paper mill in Thunder Bay, Ontario, Canada,
reduced direct costs of injuries, including workplace CTDs, by 94
percent, when the ergonomics improvements began.
 The fitness program has involved an on-site fitness facility, daily
warm-up exercises, employee fitness challenges between divisions,
exercise rehabilitation and special educational efforts. While the
ergonomics improvements have meant substantial educational efforts, job
modification and workstation adjustments have been picking up momentum
since 1992.
The fitness center, which is attached to the plant's health center to
facilitate referrals, includes a universal weight machine, free weights
and exercise bikes. 

The ergonomics evolution

"The fitness program evolved into ergonomics because we needed to. You
can only get so much benefit out of increasing employee resistance to
wear and tear until you have to reduce the load of the job and help
employees work smarter, not harder," said Francis Puchalski,
kinesiologist for Avenor. 
Avenor, which was named the safest mill by the Canadian Pulp and Paper
Association last year, employs about 1,500 people who produce newsprint,
magazine stock and tissues from wood chips. It also converts recycled
paper into a variety of products.
One of the company's ergonomics successes involves the recycle
warehouse, where injuries to wrists and elbows were a concern. In the
area where large bails of recycled paper are loaded off trucks,
employees have to cut off heavy wire wrappings with bolt cutters, pull
the wire off the bails and use a fork truck to push the paper onto
conveyor belts.
The wire wrappings were of various hardness and strength, so the number
of repetitions and the amount of stress the hand absorbed varied.  In
the fall of 1993, according to Puchalski, the wrist and elbow problems
had reached a "virtual epidemic."
About 20 percent of the 20 employees were reporting CTD-related symptoms
while many others were experiencing pain but not reporting it. 
The employees and supervisors pointed to the bolt cutters as the main
problem. However,  further analysis quickly revealed that it was the
required firm gripping and pulling of the wires, often in difficult
positions, that was the more serious issue. The wire wrapping also got
caught on the bails and transferred the sudden stop force to the
employee's hand, wrist, elbow shoulder and back.
As a result, Puchalski and his colleagues instituted a number of
actions:
-  Education sessions covering CTD issues and avoiding awkward postures
were held at the worksite.
-  On-site interviews and job analysis were conducted.
-  The work process was reviewed and some modifications were made.
-  Suppliers of the recycled paper bails were encouraged to reduce the
number of wires per bale and some were able to accommodate the request.
-  Different cutting systems and fully automated bail handling systems
were investigated.
-  The bolt cutter handles were padded.
-  Upper limb range of motion and strengthening exercises were
recommended.
-  Wrist supports with palm padding were made available to interested
employees.
 In a six-month follow-up to the interventions in the recycle warehouse,
surveys and worker and supervisor interviews showed that the issue of
wrist and elbow problems was gone, according to Puchalski. To date,
there have been no additional CTD-related claims.
In the pulp and paper industry, there are plenty of physical jobs in the
maintenance department, which is responsible for keeping the pulp and
paper machines  --  some old and new  --  in good running order. Like many
manufacturing industries, back problems have been an issue over the
years. In the last few years, more safety and educational efforts have
been yielding good results, according to Puchalski.

Attention to back injuries

Morning exercises, fitness initiatives and extensive educational efforts
within the department have gone a long way toward reducing the number of
back injuries. Providing better lifting devices, increased training on
equipment use and better body mechanics as well as ensuring that all
employees know they are responsible to get help when necessary have
contributed to the improved situation.
Maintenance employees used to work on the three large paper machines.
Now, workers are assigned one machine in order to become familiar with
its operation and quirks.
Machine maintenance occurs at specific intervals and for a limited time.
Workers often must assume awkward positions to replace parts in confined
spaces. In dealing with the older paper machine, some of the risk
exposures cannot be designed out of the job. Therefore, Avenor's program
emphasizes ongoing training and education to work better and smarter in
restricted conditions.
The maintenance department also has developed a successful job-approach
program that reminds employees of nine different questions to ask
themselves each time they approach a job.
Not all of Avenor's efforts have been reactive. "We try to be proactive.
If we are aware of some changes coming to an operation, we will try to
get in there to make some recommendations," Puchalski said.

Getting in on the design

Avenor currently is building the latest, state-of the-art control room
for one of its pulp operations. The employees assigned will be operating
digesters, bleach plants and a chemical plant on VDTs in an office-like
environment.
Puchalski, along with an optometrist, made recommendations on the screen
size, icon and warning signal coloring on screens, location and type of
display units, data entry tools and workstation layout. They recommended
trackballs over mice, a C-shaped workstation large enough to seat two
people and quality adjustable ergonomics chairs. Color and eye acuity
testing will be an ongoing program.
There also have been some discussions regarding an exercise bike in the
control room and a satellite wellness center to help with employee
alertness, fitness and exercise maintenance.
Puchalski would not reveal the cost of the new control room.

When to investigate jobs

Signals to investigate jobs for ergonomics risks come from a variety of
sources, including employees, supervisors and the on-site nurse. But the
decision to pursue ergonomic changes rests with department heads.
"Our company has moved to a business division style of operation, and
occupational health and safety is increasingly looked at as a service
provider to these divisions," said Puchalski. "If we are involved in
recommendations for an exercise program or ergonomic changes, the OK
must come from division heads."
Employee education and training also is determined by the department.
While everyone receives instruction in occupational health and safety,
employees in jobs where there are higher CTD risks get more information
on ergonomics, injury prevention and self-management. 
Puchalski said the company also is considering a more formalized
ergonomics program, including more employee training and creating a
mill-wide ergonomics team to do job analysis and interventions.
So far, said Puchalski, "Senior management has been supportive of all
our efforts to help employees, including the budgeting to expand the
on-site fitness facility."
Ten years ago, Avenor Inc.'s chief executive officer wanted to do
something to help employees with back injuries. He decided to provide a
fitness center. Over the years, said Puchalski, it has become more
apparent that employee wellness and ongoing safety efforts including
ergonomics have much to offer to provide the workplace with the
healthiest employees.
