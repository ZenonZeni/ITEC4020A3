Abstract: Numerical modelling of direct capture efficiency of
a local exhaust is used to compare the tracer gas technique of
a proposed CEN standard against a more consistent approach based
on an imaginary control box. It is concluded that the tracer gas
technique is useful for field applications.

Abstract: Describes how the Residential Construction Demonstration
Program provides pointers on duct sealing methods and program
design. In the Northwest, energy losses in forced-air systems
average 25%-30% in electrically heated homes, with some homes
being significantly worse. This appears to be the case in other
regions of the United States as well. The Bonneville Power Administration
(BPA) created the Residential Construction Demonstration Program
(RCDP) to test innovations in energy efficiency and evaluate their
effectiveness. In 1994 RCDP turned its attention to forced-air
distribution systems. Under the program, state energy offices
in Idaho, Montana, Oregon and Washington worked with BPA to recruit
and train contractors to build tight new systems and to retrofit
older ones. Researchers from the energy offices tested each of
the 41 new houses and 25 retrofit houses for duct tightness and
house operating pressures. This article summarises the most valuable
results and recommendations of these case studies.

Abstract: Describes a method for performing successful duct repair
in Northwest USA mobile homes. Describes ways to apply pressure
diagnostic techniques in mobile homes. Two firms measured rates
of duct leakage to the outside in a wide variety of older mobile
homes as well as in newer manufactured homes built under the Manufactured
Home Acquisition Program (MAP), by Bonneville Power Administration.
The study found that duct leakage can lower Delivered Heat Efficiency
by as much as 32%.

Abstract: Terminals on the exhausts of all types of ventilation
systems alter system performance as they interact with the exhaust
flow and the wind. They cause a pressure loss and the wind may
either assist the exhaust flow, cause a resistance or even flow
reversal. The precise effects depend on terminal design, exhaust
flow rate, wind speed, wind angle and wind direction. This paper
discusses a suitable test procedure and rating method which allows
terminals to be selected on a basis of performance. The widely
varying performance of some popular designs is discussed. The
results indicate those terminals that may cause flow reversal,
that have good extractive qualities and that have high resistive
properties.

Abstract: Field investigations were done in seven restaurants
(sub-sample of a study of 63 commercial buildings) to identify
uncontrolled airflows and pressure imbalances. Testing included
building airtightness tests, identification of building air barrier
locations, duct system airtightness, characterisation of pressure
differentials, building airflow balance, and infiltration/ventilation
rates. All restaurants were found to operate at negative pressures
that ranged from -0.003 in w.c. (-0.8 Pa) to -0.173 in w.c. (-43
Pa) and averaged -0.051 in. w.c. (-12.7 Pa) under normal operation.
The variables that affect depressurisation are large exhaust fans,
missing or undersized make up air, intermittent outdoor air caused
by the cycling of air handlers, dirty outdoor air and make up
air filters, and building airtightness. These uncontrolled airflows
and pressure imbalances impact energy use, ventilation rates,
sizing of heating and air-conditioning systems, indoor comfort,
relative humidity, moisture damage to building materials, mold
and mildew growth, operation of combustion equipment, and indoor
air quality.

<H2>#NO 9383 Numerical prediction of flow around a building with
various turbulence models: comparison of k-epsilon EVM, ASM, DSM,

Abstract: The accuracy of numerical predictions based on large
eddy simulation (LES), the differential stress model (DSM), the
algebraic stress model (ASM), and the standard k-e eddy viscosity
model (k-e EVM) is examined for the turbulent flow field around
a building. Here, a surface-mounted cube is used as the model
of a building. The accuracy and relative performance of these
four turbulence models are assessed by comparing them with experimental
data. The differences between the results given by these turbulence
models are examined by comparing the distribution of velocity
vectors, mean pressure coefficients (Cp), turbulence energy (k),
turbulence production (Pk), and normal stress components (u',u'),
etc.
