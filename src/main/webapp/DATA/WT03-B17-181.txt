   The objective of the international GLOBEC (Global Ocean Ecosystem Dynamics) Programme is "to understand ocean ecosystem dynamics and how they are influenced by physical processes so that the predictability of the population fluctuations in a changing global climate can be assessed". The aim is to promote large scale research into the effects of ocean climate change around the world. The programme of work in the north-east Atlantic presented here represents a co-ordinated European response to the GLOBEC initiative. Links with equivalent studies in the north-west Atlantic will be carried out through ICES.<P><BR>

The objective is to understand the physical and biological processes which control the population dynamics of the copepod <i>Calanus finmarchicus</i>, a key zooplankton species in the north-east Atlantic. Establishing the relationship between the physical and biological factors affecting annual recruitment and reproduction of the species is an essential step towards predicting the consequences of future climate change.<P><BR>

Hypotheses developed to address the linkage between physical processes and <i>C. finmarchicus</i> population dynamics are:<P>
<OL>
<LI>The interaction between vertical migrations and shelf edge hydrodynamics determines the ability to <i>C. finmarchicus</i> to seasonally colonise north-east Atlantic shelf ecosystems from overwintering depths in Norwegian Deep Water off the shelf edge.<BR>

<LI> Year-to-year variations in the timing and dynamics of shelf populations are dependent on oceanic and shelf scale forcing.<BR>
<LI>The deep circulation in the Norwegian Sea Basin and overflow into the north Atlantic is responsible for a "teleconnection" between <i>C. finmarchicus</i> summer populations in north-east Atlantic rim ecosystems.<BR>
<LI> Latitudinal gradients in abiotic conditions and interactions with predators control large scale differences in overwintering behaviour.<BR>
<LI> The large scale demography, life history timing and generation cycle characteristics of <i>C. finmarchicus</i> are related to the basic physiology of the species in relation to feeding conditions and the pattern of entry to and emergence from diapause.<BR>
</OL><P><BR>
The project will test these hypothesis in a number of different settings around the North Atlantic Rim, in particular, off southern Iceland, the Faroe Plateau, the northern North Sea and along the Norwegian midshelf. The work programme combines laboratory and mesocosm investigations of nutrition, growth and reproductive biology with both large and small scale field studies. The accumulated knowledge will be synthesised in a range of modelling tasks and the results set in context by reference to statistical analysis of long term time series data.<P><BR>

Three approaches will be adopted: field investigations, mesocosms and laboratory experimentation and modelling. Field investigations will include mapping the distribution and physiology of the species in relation to hydrography during the winter spring transition period. A coordinated and comparative time series field sampling programme covering one year will also be conducted at selected locations in the Norwegian Sea and bordering shelf. The above will provide insights into regional and temporal differences in the population biology of Calanus. Studies in mortality rates and behaviour at selected sites will be addressed with high temporal resolution using conventional net systems and acoustics.<P><BR>

Mesocosms will be used to study basic growth patterns and for assessment of latitudinal differences in physiology. These systems may provide information enabling identification of environmental cues governing life cycle patterns along latitudinal clines. Laboratory activity will concentrate on establishment of cultures of the species, to enable the studies of multiple generation Calanus population dynamics in the laboratory. The controlled culture experiments will enable us to determine the influence of environmental and dietary factors on several aspects of population biology of Calanus.<P><BR>

Several different model approaches will be applied, including hydrodynamic models encompassing both large and mesoscale processes. Sensitivity analysis will examine the scope for variability in climatological forcing at a variety of scales. Lagrangian model simulations will be run to define particle tracking routes as defined with behaviour pertinent to the various phases in the life cycle of Calanus. A bioenergetic model will be synthesized. A circle-map model of the Calanus life cycle will be developed, and will, together with particle tracking dispersal model enable us to explore population synchrony in relation to the periodicity of the forcing environmental singals.<P><BR>
