<TABLE><TR><TD COLSTART="1" WIDTH="400"><P>When I became one of the
industry's handful of robotics originator's twenty-five years ago, we made a
bold but correct assumption.  We believed companies that did not introduce
robotics into their manufacturing processes would surrender any competitive edge
they held, and would lose the major benefits robots offered to manufacturers in
improved productivity, higher quality products, and reduced time.  We were
right. Today, however, after nearly three decades of living with the
limitations, the robotics industry is taking advantage of a new revolution:
PC-based simulation.  Software that combines off-line calibration of robot and
workcell has catapulted robotics into the fast lane worldwide.</P><P>The
software development of WORKSPACE began on a PC platform in the late 1980's. 
The premiss was that Pcs would have the ability to become faster, cheaper and
contain more memory.  Developers predicted that Pcs capabilities in the future
would bring them to the level at which Silicon Graphics computers are today. 
Even the most daring prognosticators underestimated the possibility or potential
of PC-based simulation software.  No-one thought of robotic simulations being
sent for analysis around the world via e-mail and the Internet-but it is being
done.  Receivers need a personal computer with Microsoft Windows - period; the
WORKSPACE program is not required to view the simulation.</P><IMG
ALIGN="RIGHT" SRC="ir396a.gif" BORDER="1" WIDTH="216" HEIGHT="225"><P>Manufactures
are focusing attention on these software developments  The stakes are much
higher than 25 or 30 years ago for manufacturers who assume the &quot;wait and
see&quot; posture.  The industry's newest simulation program operates on a PC,
even a notebook computer.  It combines robotic workcell simulation, offline
programming and online calibration in a single, seamless piece of software; and
it works.  Suddenly, a robot manufacturer, systems integrator or robot user can
define a part and a production system for a finished product by using full
digital representation, whereas before we relied on drawings and analog-based
information.  Marketed in North America under the name WORKSPACE, the PC-based
software addresses and resolves all the challenges that simulation and offline
programming  have posed over the decades, and does it for substantially less
cost that the traditional mainframe and engineering workstations.  Most
importantly, we can now determine in simulation whether a job can or cannot be
done before we ever put one penny or pound into the hardware.  In essence, a
user can &quot;test drive&quot; the applications in software.</P><P>I predict 
that this new approach to simulation, using a standard PC,  will provide a
universal solution to universal solution to universal problems that can now be
transmitted over universal networks.  It is changing the way we do business
internationally - now.  If you are not already a user, you are in the process of
losing your competitive edge even as you read this article.</P><P><B>Old
problems/new solutions</B></P><P>Several  key problems- barriers - have kept
robotics simulation, off-line programming and on-line robot and workcell
calibration from reaching full potential.  Today, those barriers are gone; wiped
out- Demolished by this new PC-based approach.  The state of the art for
simulation is altered.  For example, one of the greatest challenges has been to
devise a way to send a program to a robot, a program that makes the robot
perform flawlessly without human intervention.  Historically, we have demanded
inexpensive robot  hardware, then assumed the self-limiting posture that it is
perfectly acceptable to stand with a robot and &quot;teach it&quot;  points &quot;
by hand&quot;.  I have believed for more than 25 years that a teach pendent must
not be an acceptable way of life.  It's been an industry constant because  up to
now, we did not know how  the real robot on the floor looks and acts in
comparison to how the &quot;perfect&quot; robot in simulation-software looks and
acts.  It did not matter that we copied the manufacturer's specifications
exactly. The mechanical model always has something that does not match the
specified data.  Robots have always been manufactured to be repeatable, not
accurate.</P><IMG ALIGN="RIGHT" SRC="ir396b.gif" WIDTH="216" HEIGHT="196"><P>The
new generation of PC-based simulation software solves that problem.  A special
set of precision instruments ( ROBOTRAK) traces or reads each of the robot's
actual kinematics (individual signature), including variances created from the
way robots are manufactured, installed and maintained.  The WORKSPACE simulation
software,  called Calibration, then compares the robot's taught positions to the
achieved positions in space.  A new set of actual robot kinematics is generated
within WORKSPACE, and this is the  simulation in place of the perfect model.  It
is at this point that reach, collision and cycle rates may be more accurately
predicted.  The system quick, accurate, and inexpensive.  Once the actual robot
is signature, it can be used on its own to calibrate other peripherals in the
workcell.</P><P>Price/performance has always been a major barrier.  The old
method required a non-portable computer system to operate the software.  Total
costs are US$110,000.  These systems have failed to perform successfully offline
programming functions, since they do not take into account the actual robot
kinematics is left up to the others, at substantially higher costs.</P><P>The
PC-based simulation system is portable, fast, accurate, does offline
programming, online calibrations and  can interface with precision measuring
equipment to track a robot's motions and provide an actual signature that is
then used in the simulation.  It also smashes the price/performance barrier.</P><P><B>North
America awakening to simulation benefits</B></P><P>Simulation's costs benefits
and time saving have industry members looking for the fine print; the down side.
 There is none.  Simulation is the robotics industry breakthrough for which
users have been waiting , and it has already started to change the fabric of
North American manufacturing.  Even companies receiving proposals and products
from suppliers are now insisting on vendor simulations to be provided with their
proposals.  This forces a complete analysis of a process down the line to the
component level.</P><P>Statistical analysis in simulation, also part of the
WORKSPACE software,  mean that we can provide predictions of overall production
on an annual basis.  Once users have created the simulation, he or she can
analyze cycle rates for all the pieces of equipment in a workcell. They can also
project pieces per hour, as week as uptime/downtime factors.  WORKSPACE contains
an option called &quot;throughput&quot;, which analyses parts per hour, downtime
and problem areas for improvement.</P><P>Simulation now can be used to layout
the entire manufacturing process, from concept to finished product.  A user now
has the ability to &quot;test drive&quot; a system at all levels of the process
before committing hardware.</P><P>Simulations can be transmitted worldwide for
analysis via e-mail of Internet to anyone who has a PC- a major sales,
engineering, manufacturing advantage. The person reviewing the simulation need
to use WORKSPACE; this is a major breakthrough.  This unique feature provides
the ultimate tool for concurrent engineering.</P><P>Simulation, formerly
regarded as an engineering function, now becomes an affordable vendor tool to
show prospective buyers that the system works, and the vendor has done the
necessary homework.  Simulation before starting floor operations prevents costly
crashes and downtime.</P><P>Simulation is not in anyway restricted to robots. 
It is an outstanding tool to evaluate process lines, stamping lines, everything
up to and including indexing transfer lines and transfer mechanisms.</P><P><B>Actual
uses of PC-based simulation</B></P><P>In addition to traditional uses of
simulating new processes, WORKSPACE  allows a user to reverse engineer or edit
existing applications.  The PC-based simulation system takes in the actual
program that runs a robot, them simulates the robot's activities on the screen
while the operator analyses the robots program.  The user then edits the reach
points within WORKSPACE to improve the robot's program, all while the actual
robot continues in production.  WORKSPACE then creates a new corrected/edited
program in the robot's language- the ultimate editing tool.</P><P>In recent
simulation analysis of existing robot programs, we were able to take from two to
six seconds out of robot cycle times by editing their previously taught points. 
Individual companies will have to assign their own values to what it means to
take from two to six seconds out of robot cycle times by editing their
previously taught points.  Individual companies will have to assign their own
values to what it means to take a couple of seconds out of a part's cycle time. 
A company that makes 100,000 parts a year in a robotic cell can recover a
significant amount of production time and money.</P><IMG
ALIGN="RIGHT" SRC="ir396c.gif" BORDER="1" WIDTH="216" HEIGHT="221"><P>The
WORKSPACE simulation software also compensates for robot add ons, such as a
junction box, cables and brackets.  These engineering changes often mean the
robot no longer fits into its work envelope as per the original simulation. 
Since WORKSPACE can travel with the job, a user can resimulate where necessary. 
WORKSPACE then reprograms the robot to eliminate costly start-up
surprises-collision points, near misses, and points the robot can no longer
reach because of the additional constraints.</P><P>As example for robot
calibration is: a manufacturer using simulation assumes that the robot used in
the simulation assumes that the robot used in the simulation is the same as the
robot to be used introduction.  this is rarely, if ever, the case.  Let us
assume that the robot ordered can reach exactly two metres.  But constraints in
the reach pattern are directly affected by the inaccuracies we find in every
robot.  The real robot, for a number of valid reasons, may not reach two metres,
it may fall 20-30 millimeters short. Unless a calibrated robot model is used in
the simulation, and off-line program generated will most likely not work.  This
decades-old solution: Call the pipe fitters and bring a fork lift to relocate
parts of the system.  WORKSPACE locates the problem before the machines are
bolted down, reverifies at the time of installation and assists in correcting
any remaining problems.</P><P>In another example, simulation was used as a &quot;repair&quot;
job where interfering with each other in the workcell.  The system had been laid
out using a simulation system which was on a Silicon Graphics workstation in
another city.  That simulation did not travel with the job to finish that
installation.  By having the WORKSPACE simulation on a 486 notebook, corrections
were analyzed at the job site and corrections made.</P><P><B>Predictions</B></P><P>Anyone
who has knowledge of  PC-based simulation and its potential applications doesn't
need to ask, &quot;What's on the horizon?&quot;  But I love it when they ask
anyway.  My predictions for the industry include the following:</P><UL>
<LI>Best estimates suggest the size of the North American simulation market
today is between $30 and $35 million. I have no doubt that in the next couple of
years, the market will have surged to over $100 million, and the crest of the
wave is not even in sight.</LI>
<LI>Within the next two to five years, we'll see the widespread entry of
PC-based open architecture controls.  They will replace today's specialized
controls which require specialized interfaces.  I believe that leading PC
simulation software packages will plug and play on most-if not all- of those PC
controllers.</LI>
<LI>We will  see- and demand- PC-based, resident simulation in engineering at
vendor facilities builders' shops and at production facilities.</LI>
<LI>Simulation will be neutral to the robot and specific to the application.
Systems integrators and robot users will demand objective analyses of the entire
range of robot manufacturing. Robot manufacturers,  therefore,  will not be in
the field of objective simulation analysis of robotic systems.</LI>
<LI>Factories with robots from different manufacturers will increasingly rely
on simulation,  and demand services from companies which do not have ties to
robot or supplier companies.  Users will insist on an objective evaluation of
robot function and system performance  for a wide range of manufacturers
products.</LI>
<LI>PC-based simulation will be a global fact of life for manufacturers and
users, and the transition is underway.</LI></UL><P><B>Conclusion</B></P><P>Robot
Simulation, Ltd., the UK's research and development team which selected the
personal computer for simulation software development, broke out of the
mainframe mindset that crippled progress for years.  What they created - a
portable,  PC-based, robotic simulation  program with offline programming and
online robot calibration capabilities- means every robotics manufacturer,
systems integrator and robot user can have access to an affordable and effective
tool for increasing production profits.  Simulations created using WORKSPACE on
a personal computer can be sent by e-mail and via the Internet to anyone
anywhere in the world, who is using  a PC with Microsoft Windows.  WORKSPACE
simulation analysis  is not site specific, and the ability to transmit
simulation freely to virtually anyone opens the door to unobstructed
international resources.</P><P>I believe,  without hesitation or doubt, that
PC-based simulation technology is the sleeping giant of the 1990's.  And the
giant has just yawned.</P><P></P><HR NOSHADE="NOSHADE"><P><B>Walter K.
