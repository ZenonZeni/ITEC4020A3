<H2>Yet, every year, mankind destroys an area of rainforest nearly one-half the size of Texas. </H2>
<BR>
<P>Earth's greatest natural resource is quite literally going up in smoke, as over 320 square miles of irreplaceable primary rainforest are burned or logged <I>every day</I>. Only twenty years ago, rainforests covered about fourteen percent of the earth's land area. Today, rainforests are less than six percent.</P>
<P>At the current rate of destruction, this miraculous web of life will be totally wiped out in forty years. With it will be lost untold treasures and irreplaceable resources available only within these unique environments.</P>
<P>The importance of these fragile eco-systems to the health of our world cannot be overstated:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Over half of Earth's living species live there.</LI>
<LI>Two-and-a-half acres of Amazon Rainforest contain over seven hundred-fifty types of trees, more than all of North America.</LI>
<LI>One rainforest reserve in Peru is home to more species of birds than the entire United States.</LI>
<LI>According to estimates, twenty percent of the world's oxygen is produced in the Amazon Rainforest.</LI>
<LI>Two-thirds of the Earth's fresh water is found in the Amazon River basin.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Perhaps even more distressing is the loss of countless ingredients that could provide improved health and a better life for millions of people throughout the entire world:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Seventy percent of the plants currently found to be active against cancers come from the rainforests.</LI>
<LI>Over one hundred and twenty prescription drugs and twenty-five percent of all pharmaceuticals originate from rainforest material.</LI>
<LI>Eighty percent of all fruits ad vegetables in our modern diet originated there.</LI>
<LI>And yet, the rainforest is so rich with life, <I>less than one percent of its three hundred thousand plant species have even been studied by scientists.</I></LI>
<LI>One rainforest plant, the Madagascar Periwinkle (now extinct in the wild), has produced a drug that has increased the survival rate in children with leukemia from 20% to 80%. How many lives have been saved by this one plant? How many more can be saved by other plants that grow in the rainforests?</LI>
</UL>
<P>A seemingly endless list of fact after fact present the importance of saving the world's remaining rainforests. If we act today, the world we pass on to our children's children can be a healthier, better world for all.</P>
<H2>The RainForce, providing a force for a healthier world. </H2>
<P>The key to turning this tide of destruction lies in providing  long-term, economically viable alternatives to the current exploitation of the rainforest by timber companies, oil companies, agra-business and others. Sustainable, non-destructive harvesting of the riches contained in the rainforests of the world is vital to the on-going health of our world.</P>
<P>Not only is it environmentally sound, but sustainable harvesting of rainforest plants makes more economic sense than the alternatives. It is estimated that sustainable harvesting of one acre of Peruvian Amazon rainforest can produce over $2400 annually for the Peruvian people. In contrast, clear-cutting for timber nets only $400 per acre and cattle grazing earns only $60 per acre.</P>
<H2>A Complex Problem</H2>
<P>Like many of the world's problems, rainforest deforestation is a complex problem. Yet, in reality, the solution is simple. If you and enough people like you, show concern and start to take positive actions, change will occur. In this case, it is as simple as using, and encouraging others to use, products that have been sustainably harvested from these endangered rainforests of the world.</P>
<H2>The RainForce, A Solution</H2>
<P>Life Plus is proud to introduce the RainForce. As a catalyst for progressive change, it encompasses people and organizations working towards a healthier planet. The moral imperative we all should feel to leave the world a little better than it was when we arrive is an underlying concept of the RainForce. Truly, the RainForce is many things:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Life Plus Members using products, and telling others about these products that are sustainably harvested from the unique web of life, are part of the RainForce.</LI>
<LI>Indigenous peoples of the rainforest areas earning a livable income from non-destructively harvesting the fruits of the forest are part of the RainForce.</LI>
<LI>Life Plus, working together with the indigenous peoples of the rainforest and utilizing sustainably harvested botanicals from the rainforest in its new product line, is part of the RainForce.</LI>
<LI>Consumers through-out the world, seeking products that are sustainably harvested from the rainforest are part of the RainForce.</LI>
<LI>Most importantly, <B>YOU</B> are part of the RainForce.</LI>
</UL>

<H2>Will It Work?</H2>

<P>Life Plus firmly believes that the biggest problems we face, now or in the future, can best be solved through individual effort. When millions of people, each one making an individual effort to contribute, are all working toward the same goal - <I>the world changes!</I></P>

<H2>The Pharmacy of the World</H2>
<P>To the people who have lived in the rainforest for thousands of years, it is a sacred place. A place of life. A place of health. Through countless generations, these indigenous peoples of the rainforest have learned many of the health secrets hidden within dense vegetation, utilizing over eighteen-hundred species of plants for medicinal and health purposes.</P>
<P>Life Plus has tapped this ancient wisdom in developing the RainForce product line. Studying with indigenous Amazon healers and integrating this age-old knowledge with the advanced technology and product application expertise that is he hallmark of Life Plus; we developed the RainForce product line. A line of healthful products combining the best of both worlds.</P>
<P>Utilizing some twenty-five rainforest plants in these formulation, Life Plus uses costly <I>cold-processing</I> techniques, without chemical agents to refine and concentrate active ingredients as standardized whole complexes, complete with all the naturally occurring enzymes and other phytonutrients that create their synergistic effectiveness.</P>
<P>The result? Health enhancing products that capture the complex, symbiotic life force of the rainforest itself. Products that can enhance your health in ways that now synthetic product can match. Products that reward indigenous peoples and promote sustainable harvesting of precious rainforest botanicals:</P>

<P>Life Plus RainForce products: <I>combining the wisdom of traditional rainforest healing with the benefits of modern science and technology. </I><P> 
Life Plus RainForce products: <I>using sustainable harvesting of rainforest botanicals to enhance your health, and the health of our planet.</I></P>
