 <IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> BACTERIA </H2>

<P>   Bacteria are everywhere. We swallow them with our food, drink them with water, they are in the air we breathe, on our skin, in our mouths, digestive tract, sinuses and other areas of our bodies.  In so far as health is concerned, some of them are harmful, some neutral and some are very beneficial. Some are extremely valuable for good health as they work harmoniously with our immune system.  In a healthy colon, there are literally billions of beneficial or "friendly" bacteria. Under favorable conditions, they multiply at a fast enough rate to keep pace with the large numbers that are lost during elimination.  Bacteria is also referred to as micro-organisms. When they are located in the intestinal tract, they are referred to as "intestinal flora," micro-flora or sometimes just "flora".</P>
<P>   These friendly bacteria synthesize many important vitamins in the digestive tract including vitamin K and some of the B vitamins. A very important function they perform is helping the colon maintain a proper pH or acid-base balance. It is necessary for the pH to stay in the correct range in order for other health supporting bacteria to exist. It is also important to keep levels of antagonistic micro-organisms under control.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> LOW LEVELS</H2>
<P>   At times, the taking of antibiotics can be necessary, even life saving. When we take them to kill off the infectious bacteria, we also destroy large amounts of the beneficial flora in our digestive tracts.  When the level becomes disturbed, or when the bowel ecology becomes out of balance, health problems can develop. In this instance, it is important to replenish the friendly bacteria as soon as possible in order to maintain good health. They can be replaced by concentrating on eating foods they are contained in and supplementing with SALIVAREX.</P>
<P>   Dairy products are a good source of friendly lactobacillus, especially yogurt and kefir. However, the milk that most people drink today is pasteurized, or heated to about 165 degrees F. So, for the most part, we have lost this source of lactobacillus in our diets and are not receiving the quantities of these bacteria in our diets as we used to. It is a good idea to routinely eat some live culture containing foods such as yogurt, kefir, etc. Be sure the products are guaranteed to contain live cultures. It is actually best to make your own yogurt to be assured of bacteria content.</P>
<P>   Bad breath is usually a good indication that normal bacteria levels are low.  When lactobacillus levels are low in the colon, partially digested food decays, produce foul gas and toxemia. The prevalence of cold sores (herpes simplex), constipation, diarrhea, acne, vaginitis, headache, symptoms of hypoglycemia, yeast infections and others are often signs of low flora levels.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> DAIRY & LACTOSE</H2>
<P>   Many people seem to be allergic to dairy products. The primary reason is quite often not that they are truly allergic to them but that they cannot deal with the lactose (commonly called milk sugar) contained in the dairy products. They cannot digest lactose, or milk sugar, and this can lead to allergies, headaches, cramps, mucous formation and many other health problems. The various kinds of Lactobacillus bacteria can digest it. This is why many people can eat yogurt, cultured milks and kefir even though they cannot handle dairy products like milk, cheese, ice cream, etc.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> VIRUS AND YEAST</H2>
<P>   Cold sores, caused by the herpes simplex virus, are a reliable indicator that micro-flora is becoming lower than acceptable. Constipation and diarrhea can develop from decreased levels of friendly bacteria.
   It is believed that yeast infections, including thrush, vaginitis, and vaginal infections with abnormal amounts of discharge, are associated with decreased micro-flora levels.   Anyone with chronic infections should consider supplementing with lactobacillus as they support the immune system and help restore healthy ecology. People with toxemia and those going through any kind of detoxification program should supplement with SALIVAREX.</P>


<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> UNIQUE FORMULA</H2>
<P>  SALIVAREX contains the four most lactobacillus  for supplemental use.  The Acidophilus  and Bulgaricus strains quite often occur together in nature. Bifidus is an  extremely  beneficial  strain  and  usually  not contained in this type of supplement as it is expensive and difficult to produce. Bifidus is normally present in the digestive tracts of newborn babies.  While the babies are breast feeding it usually maintains its levels and can multiply. As they grow older and are exposed to whole milk and other foods, Lactobacillus Bifidus disappears.</P>
<P>   One special feature of  SALIVAREX is that it contains a large quantity of Lactobacillus Salivarius, a unique strain of highly specialized super micro-flora. This highly active organism neutralizes many pathogens which thrive in an unhealthy colon. It  has  the  ability  to  dramatically  increase  energy  levels  by breaking down undigested proteins making them available for use.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> PHYTOZYME BASE</H2>
<P>  SALIVAREX is formulated in the proprietary Life Plus Phytozyme base, which contains a unique blend of over thirty natural concentrates of numerous valuable phytonutrients from plants.  When you take Life Plus products, you have the added benefit  of  receiving  the  numerous  health  supporting phytochemicals and other micronutrients contained in them.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HOW TO TAKE SALIVAREX</H2>
</P>   SALIVAREX capsules should be kept in the refrigerator. It is a good idea to take a bottle of SALIVAREX every three or four months for routine replenishing.   When low levels of lactobacillus are obvious, four capsules can be taken three to six times a day until one bottle is used to build up levels quickly. Then, one or two capsules twice a day. Many people supplement once or twice a day as an ongoing way to keep their levels of friendly bacteria up to par.  SALIVAREX capsules can also be opened and placed into baby formula or sprinkled on food.</P>
<P>   SALIVAREX is nutritionally helpful to maintain a healthy colon.  The Life Plus Products <A HREF="mecol.htm">ECOLOGY NO. 3</A>  and <A HREF="mcolodyn.htm">COLODYNE</A> are compatible with SALIVAREX. ECOLOGY NO. 3 is a highly concentrated powder that contains large quantities of all four lactobacillus strains, but  SALIVAREX is more concentrated with L-Salivarius.</P>
