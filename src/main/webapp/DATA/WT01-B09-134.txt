<B>Project Title:  Hybrid Electric HMMWV Program<p>
Performing Organization:  Pentastar Electronics, inc.</B><p>

<P>POINT OF CONTACT: Ken Winters Manager. Power Systems<BR>
Phone: 205­895­2370

<P><B>Program Summary: </B></P> 

<P>The Hybrid Electric HMMWXI Program objective is the development of an advanced high performance
hybrid electric power train for use in a modified High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV)
tactical and support vehicle for the U.S. Army. This vehicle is being designed to out­perform the
conventional diesel powered stock vehicle in many areas including acceleration, top speed,
gradeability, and fuel economy while adding capabilities for stealth operations mobile electrical power
delivery and robotic operations.</p>

 <P>Through the use of an advanced, low emission, diesel motor driving a
permanent magnet generator operating in tandem with an advanced high energy density lead acid
battery, this vehicle will achieve acceleration from 0 to 60 mph in 11 seconds typically, a maximum
speed of 80 mph, and a gradeability of 60%with a payload of up to 3400 pounds. Fully independent
four wheel drive using no mechanical differentials will afford increased traction control and mobility from
that of the standard vehicle. No compromises will be made to the interior of the vehicle so that
passenger space and comfort will be the same. Nor will the payload area be changed in any way so
that standard HMMWV payload packages can still be accommodated. </P>
