(1) SUBJECT: New Draft proposed to Revise Exon CDA -- Bill Still
             Unconstitutional

The Communications Decency Act, authored by Senator James Exon
(D-NE), has attracted a firestorm of criticism from nearly all groups that
are concerned about censorship, children's access to controversial material
and the health of the Internet marketplace.  Critics include the American
Family Association, American Online, People for the American Way, and the
United States Justice Department, as well as a variety of civil liberties
and press groups.  In an effort to seek a compromise among these disparate
groups, some parties have drafted a legislative proposal as an alternative
to the current Exon language in the Senate Telecommunications Reform bill.
As far as we know, this draft has not yet been accepted by any parties.

We believe that the draft contains several significant improvements
over the original language, but it still contains unconstitutional
prohibitions against First Amendment-protected speech and fails to fully
account for the unique characteristics of interactive media.

*       The Free Speech Rubicon for Interactive Media

The key flaw remaining in this proposal is its well-intentioned but
overbroad effort to regulate indecent material (the "seven dirty words") in
interactive media.  Regulation of indecency has been found constitutional
only in limited cases involving radio and television broadcasting and
audiotext services.  We believe that given the unique user control
attributes of interactive media, as well as the great abundance of
capacity, it is unconstitutional to regulate indecency in this new medium.
The result of this overbroad regulation is the paradoxical result that
information which is freely available in bookstores, libraries and record
shops will be barred on the Internet.  Such restrictions will stifle the
free flow of information in interactive media and deal a grave blow to the
development of markets for multimedia products and services.

Based on our initial analysis, we have the following comments on
the new language:

A. Unconstitutional restrictions on indecent speech online:  Banning
   the "seven dirty words" on the Net.

If this new proposal became law, the level of discourse on the
Internet as a whole would have to be reduced to that which is considered
appropriate for children.  A newly added section (e) effectively makes it
illegal to use any of the "seven dirty word" in public forums on the
Internet.  This new subsection makes in a crime to "knowingly" make and
transmit an indecent message to anyone under 18 years old.  This provision
covers both private messages between two individuals and public postings to
newsgroups that may well reach hundreds of thousands of people around the
world.  Though the drafters may want to limit this crime to situations
where material is provided directly to minors, that is simply impossible on
the net.  Anyone who participates in public discussion groups knows that
there may well be kids reading the group as well.  Thus, they would be
violating the law simply by posting a hotly-worded message.


Prohibited items under the new subsection (e) include:

        * Rap music lyrics (both the text and the sound files)
        * Lady Chatterly's Lover
        * Public eclaration that you're "pissed off" or that someone
          is a "shit."
        * Calvin Klein ads (the ones with naked bodies)

The constitutional flaw in this section lies in the critical
distinction between "obscenity," that which is truly hard-core pornography,
and "indecency," sexually-explicit material which may be offensive to some
or may be considered by some to be inappropriate for children, but which is
protected by the First Amendment.  Under the First Amendment, Congress has
broad power to regulate obscenity, but can only regulate indecency in very
narrow circumstances, such as in the broadcast media where there is a
captive audience.  Even in these narrow circumstances, such regulation may
be the "least intrusive means" for accomplishing the government's goal of
protecting children.  Given the existence of software and hardware that
enable parents to block children's access to indecent material the
regulation here does not constitute the "least restrictive means"
requirement set out by the Supreme Court.

Furthermore, the government may not regulation indecent material in
a way that would deny adults access to such material.  This is precisely
the result that is produced by this new statutory proposal.  Such as result
would be both unwise and unconstitutional.  The highly restrictive
treatment proposed here for interactive media creates a situation in the
future whereby material that is legally available to people of all ages in
bookshops and libraries will be banned from the Internet.

B. Unfair treatment of individual users, educational institutions and
   other non-commercial services: Pre-emption against restrictive state laws
   only for commercial services

If enacted, this proposal would protect commercial service
providers from additional censorship by state legislatures, but leave all
non-commercial users, including libraries, schools, community groups, and
individuals subject to additional regulation and censorship under state
law.  The proposal pre-empts state statutes that might censor commercial
services beyond the scope of federal law, but leaves all other net users
and groups exposed to any censorship that states may choose to enact.  We
find no valid public policy argument which would accord greater protection
to commercial speech than is granted to non-commercial users of the net.

C. Failure to take full advantage of user and parental control
   features inherent in interactive media

Legislating about new interactive media requires a careful
understanding of the unique attributes of this new medium.  First and
foremost, interactive media enable users (including parents) to exercise
choice over the information that they and their children have access to.
In sharp contrast to older media, government content regulation is simply
not necessary in order to shield children from possibly inappropriate
information.  Any legislative action in this are must identify ways to
promote greater parental and user control.  As drafted, the proposal before
us suggests possible FCC rulemaking on this issue, but is no guaranty that
the Commission would take this course.  Instead of just passing this
critical question off to a regulatory body, Congress must identify both
legal and voluntary means to encourage the development of more and more
flexible and accessible user control techniques.

Conclusion

In light of the serious constitutional concerns raised about the
Act, and the danger that it poses for the development of a vital new
communications medium, we believe that it is essential that the Congress
given careful scrutiny and study to provisions involving the regulation of
indecency in interactive media.  Senator Leahy and Rep. Klink have offered
legislation (S. 714) which would conduct just such as study.  Thoughtful
consideration is essential before moving ahead with legislation that is
both unconstitutional and patently ineffective toward the goal of
protecting children.
