<H4><A NAME="biodiversity">A View Of Biodiversity </A></H4>

<P>
Biodiversity is a relatively modern word; eg <A HREF="refs.htm">Biodiversity Unit (1993)</A>.
Within the research community, it can assume one or more meanings
depending on the spatial scale involved.
<P>
However, for the general public, biodiversity has come to assume
a focus, a banner, for political action. Biodiversity is replacing
the older watchwords of conservation, preservation, environment,
and natural heritage that gave meaning to widespread concern over
the consequences of our way of life.
<P>
The cumulative consequences of our national economic activities
and value systems have resulted in widespread decline in the abundance
and range of many organisms, with the extinction of a smaller
but appreciable number of species that were present two centuries
ago; eg Saunders et al (in preparation), <A HREF="refs.htm">Short and Smith (1994)</A>.

<P>
Biodiversity is valued by Australian society for many reasons.
The three reasons most often cited are that biodiversity provides
a sense of unique national identity, place and responsibility;
it offers significant potential economic benefits if exploited
in a sustainable way; and, irrespective of its value to society,
it has an intrinsic right to exist; eg <A HREF="refs.htm">Biodiversity Unit (1993)</A>.
<P>
We offer no judgement on any of these three viewpoints other than
to summarise that for contemporary Australian society, biodiversity
is perceived to be a significant component of the individual and
collective quality of life. Biodiversity matters to us; eg <A HREF="refs.htm">Cocks (1992)</A>.
<P>
As public and scientific interest in biodiversity has grown, so
also have the number of definitions and descriptions. We do not
intend to add to these but rather to link two emphases that characterise
the perspective of biodiversity that underpinned this project.
<P>
The first emphasis was that biodiversity includes all species:
plants and animals, both common and rare. This emphasis was a
necessary alternative to the more restricted and unfortunately
common view that biodiversity is only about rare animals, and
that plants are just habitat for fauna.<HR>

<P>
<A HREF="photocd/0508_044.gif"><IMG SRC="photocds/0508_044.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></A>
<P>
<I>Every organism captured in this image is a component of Australia's
biodiversity - not just the bird in centre frame.</I><HR>

<P>
The second emphasis was on the direction and rate of change in
the size of the species pool. This was the operational theme and
principal focus of this project; not on inventory and not on determining
the biodiversity complement. Furthermore, it is the consensus
view that the predominant direction of that change, however poorly
quantified, is negative. That is, we currently preside over a
situation of general loss of biodiversity, with the rates of loss
ranging from very slight to rapid depending on circumstance; eg
<A HREF="refs.htm">Moritz and Kikkawa (1994), Saunders, Hopkins, and How (1990)</A>.
This situation is not unique to Australia; eg <A HREF="refs.htm">Hannah et al (1994, 1995)</A>.
<P>
To stress the emphasis on rate of change of biodiversity away
from biodiversity itself, we use the terms biotic impoverishment
or biotic erosion to capture the process of species diminution
and extinction.
<P>
Biotic erosion is evocative as both a metaphor and an analogue
because species extinction was often unspectacular and delayed
in time but nonetheless relentless and irreversible; eg <A HREF="refs.htm">Bridgewater (1994), Recher (1994), Recher and Lim (1992)</A>.
An emphasis on biotic erosion was operational because it is now
public policy to manage the loss of biodiversity by detecting
it, and where possible, preventing, slowing or and reversing that
decline. <HR>
