Here is some information that could be of interest to you. The Internet
is rapidly  becoming the greatest marketplace in the world.  It is an
international network of computer systems that allows anyone with a home
computer to connect with other computers, across town or around the world
to gain access to information, and to communicate economically for nearly
every purpose imaginable. It is estimated that  there are already  between
40 to 50 million people on the Internet today, and that number is growing
by thousands each week.  America On Line reports an average of nearly
10,000 new members each week. And Microsoft recently announced that
525,000 new members joined the Microsoft Online service in its first
3 months of operation. Prodigy, Compuserve, Earthlink, and an accounted
number of local Internet access providers scattered across the world add
even more to these numbers everyday.  Ned Lautenbach, Senior VP and Group
Executive of IBM, speaking of the dramatic growth of the Internet, recently
predicted that "based on current exponential growth, over one billion people
maybe online by the year 2000."  Although it is difficult to get exact
figures as to the number of people currently on it; it is fair to say
that nearly everyone will soon have access to the Internet with home
computers connected to it more than televisions are connected to cable.

What do these all mean to you, the business owner?
</FONT>
You now have a very
good opportunity to reach this rapidly growing market. Having a
professionally looking home page is not enough!  Promoting it is another
thing.  This is akin to having one billboard along 101 freeway. You need
more than that to launch your business globally.  It has been estimated
that there are thousands of search engines, directories, indexes and links.
Alta Vista,  Yahoo,  Infoseek, Excite, Lycos and Webcrawler are just some
of the more popular ones.  Locating the search engines and filling out the
submission forms can take hundreds of hours.  Hiring a professional to do
it for you could cost you  literally hundreds if not thousands of dollars.
Our goal is to help you  maximize your  exposure  on the Internet by
increasing the traffic to your site.  With
<FONT COLOR="FF0000">PowerSubmit</FONT>
 we have developed
the best way to  promote your web site to over 500 search engines, indexes,
directories and links effectively and efficiently.  Find out and see for
yourself how easy it is.  It couldn't get any better than this.  A <B>FREE</B>
demo is provided for you to prove to yourself that there is no better
way to promote your business than with
