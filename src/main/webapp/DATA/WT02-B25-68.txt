<hr>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Entitlement/Disability Benefits </font></p>
<blockquote>
<p>1 - those with mental illness are just as entitled to benefits as those with physical 
illness </p>
<p>2 - more than 4.2 Americans receive disability benefits </p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#FF0000">How does the Social Security Administration (SSA) define &quot;disability&quot;? </font></p>
<blockquote>
<p>1 - in terms of ability to work </p>
<p>2 - those who are unable to work for a year or more </p>
<p>3 - those whose condition is likely to result in death </p>
<p>4 - disability is determined by doctors &amp; disability examiners at state agencies 
based on clinical evidence &amp; examinations </p>
<p>5 - Earnings/you must make under $500 per month </p>
<p>6 - Severity/your condition must interfere with basic work-related activities </p>
<p>7 - Checklist/your condition must either be on a list of disabling impairments 
maintained by Social Security or have the same disabling effect as a condition on 
the list in terms of work ability </p>
<p>8 - Type of Work/if you cannot do any type of work that will enable you to earn 
$500 per month </p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#FF0000">How to apply for benefits </font></p>
<blockquote>
<p>1 - apply in person at your local Social Security Administration (SSA) field 
office </p>
<p>2 - family members/guardians may apply when one's disability prevents one 
from doing so oneself </p>
<p>3 - you will be given an in-depth interview/this can be difficult for ill applicants, 
thus bringing a family member or friend for moral support is helpful </p>
<p>4 - you will complete a variety of application forms </p>
<p>5 - call SSA to find out what procedure to follow </p>
<p>6 - eligibility is determined jointly by a caseworker from SSA who focuses on 
financial considerations &amp; a caseworker from the state Disability Determination 
Service (DDS) who focuses on medical &amp; functional information </p>
<p>7 - eligibility is determined between 3 &amp; 6 months after application </p>
<p>8 - remember to call periodically to check on the status of your application </p>
<p>9 - be persistent even if rejected after application/2 out of 3 persons receiving 
benefits were initially rejected </p>
<p>10 - appeals process </p>
<blockquote>
<p>a. ask for reconsideration by another DDS caseworker </p>
<p>b. if (a) is not decided in your favor, ask for an administrative 
hearing (a formal hearing before an administrative law judge) to 
review the caseworker's decision </p>
<p>c. if (b) is not decided in your favor, ask for a review by the SSA 
Appeals Council of the law judge's decision </p>
<p>d. if (c) is not decided in your favor, appeal a denial of disability 
benefits to U.S. Federal District Court (class action suits are usually 
most successful) </p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Supplemental Security Income (SSI) </font></p>
<blockquote>
<p>1 - for those who are disabled, poor, &amp; unable to work </p>
<p>2 - pays individuals up to $407 each month </p>
<p>3 - supplemented by about 25 states </p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) </font></p>
<blockquote>
<p>1 - for those who are disabled &amp; unable to work but who have worked in the 
past or whose parents have worked &amp; paid into the social security trust fund </p>
<p>2 - depending on work history, individuals may receive more than those 
receiving Supplemental Security Income (SSI) which provides up to $407 per 
month </p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#FF0000">For more information </font></p>
<blockquote>
<p>1 - call the Social Security Hotline at 1-800-772-1213 between 7am &amp; 7pm
