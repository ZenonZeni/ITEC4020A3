<P>This is the first of a three-part series on the application of 
zincphosphate coatings to substrates other than steel. Part I will expose process control problems encountered during the production of zinc phosphate coatings on zinc-plated surfaces. On various parts, the zinc phosphate coating was to provide corrosion resistance, prepaint treatment or pretreatment to 
enhance adhesion. Part II will show the results of applying different types of 
zinc phosphate coatings on zinc-plated and galvanized surfaces. Part III will 
show the results of applying various types of zinc phosphate coatings on 
cadmium plated and aluminum surfaces.
<P>Having some knowledge of light (paint base) zinc phosphate coatings 
on steel, I was asked to participate in a project that involved the application 
of these coatings on zinc-plated parts. One zinc-plated part required a 
zinc phosphate coating as a supplemental finish for corrosion protection. 
Another zinc-plated part required a phosphate coating to promote adhesive 
bonding of a rubber. A third part required paint adhesion to a zinc-plated part. 
<P>All the parts were failing for various reasons. The supplemental 
phosphate on zinc-plated parts exhibited white corrosion after only eight hrs of 
salt spray testing. The salt spray requirement on the hardware was 48 hrs 
exposure with no evidence of white corrosion. Parts with the rubber showed 
disbonding after simulation testing. The phosphated zinc surfaces failed adhesion 
tests that were performed after the epoxy paint had cured for one week.
<P>The approach to solving the problems was to characterize the 
phosphate coating in each application by determining coating weight, crystal 
structure and coverage. Coating weight on the zinc surfaces was determined using 
a sodium dichromate/ammonium hydroxide stripping solution on the 
phosphated zinc surfaces. Crystal structure and coverage were determined using 
a scanning electron microscope at 500x magnification. Photos at this 
magnification were used to previously characterize zinc phosphate coatings on steel.
<P>An investigation determined the ability of zinc-phosphate-coated 
zinc-plated parts to provide corrosion resistance (the formation of white 
corrosion product during salt spray testing). Werner Raush reported corrosion 
resistance to white corrosion of up to 48 hrs in the salt spray 
test1 . Mr. Raush also stated that phosphating improves resistance to &quot;white rust&quot; formation on zinc surfaces during storage or transport under normal conditions. Initial testing of a phosphate coating showed white corrosion product after eight hours of five pct salt spray (ASTMB117) exposure. Incorporation of a 
bright dip prior to phosphating produced a smaller size crystalline structure 
that provided 24 hrs of salt spray resistance prior to formation of white 
corrosion. A third process provided a very fine crystalline zinc phosphate coating 
on zinc-plated parts. An investigation into the chemicals showed no 
grain refinement step in the phosphating operation. Contact with the 
chemical manufacturer revealed that the alkaline cleaner contained titanium salts. 
<P>Since the concentration of the titanium salts in the cleaner was less 
than one pct, and the titanium is not considered toxic or hazardous, titanium 
salts were not listed on the Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS). The 
phosphating applicator had no way of knowing what was contributing to the fine 
grain structure on the product. Accelerated salt spray testing showed no 
white corrosion after 48 hrs exposure on these parts. This investigation 
essentially shows that a fine crystalline zinc phosphate coating with complete 
coverage can reduce the susceptibility of zinc-plated surfaces to the formation 
of white (zinc) corrosion.
<P>An investigation determined zinc-phosphate coating processing 
parameters for adhesive bonding. The adhesive manufacturer recommended a 
calcium-modified zinc phosphate with a coating weight of 150300 mg per sq 
ft for optimum adhesive bonding on zinc surfaces. Examination of the 
calcium-modified zinc phosphate coating on zinc-plated parts revealed a large 
crystal structure of essentially zinc phosphate and coating weights in the 
9001,000 mg per sq ft range. The phosphate coating applicator processed the parts 
for three min. Reducing the time to one and a half min did not reduce the 
coating weight appreciably. A titanium predip prior to phosphating reduced 
the coating weight to 600800 mg per sq ft and reduced the crystal size. 
<P>Testing followed formation of the phosphate coating. 
Acid-zinc-plated specimens were zinc phosphate coated in a calcium-modified solution for 5, 10, 20, 40 and 180 seconds. Next, acid-zinc plated specimens were 
treated with a titanium salt rinse/dip and phosphated in the same 
calcium-modified solution. The specimens were removed after 5, 10, 20, 40, and 180 
seconds.
<P>The titanium rinse resulted in a finer crystal structure and quicker 
coverage compared to the specimens not given the treatment. Coating weight 
at 180 seconds was essentially the same, which could be expected since 
the phosphating solution was the same. Two significant observations of 
the calcium-modified coating (no titanium predip) on zinc were that no 
nodular coating was formed, and the coating weights exceed the 150300 mg per 
sq ft, which is typical of calcium-modified zinc phosphate coating on steel. 
<P>When the adhesive manufacturer was asked to provide a sample, the 
nodular coating was received and had a coating weight of 200 mg per sq ft. 
Further testing showed the substrate to be steel, not zinc. Thus, the adhesive 
manufacturer did not know that it was impossible to meet its own specifications. 
<P>Specimens processed in an alkaline-zinc solution were given a 
titanium rinse and processed in a nickelfluoride (NiF) zinc phosphating 
solution. The final coating weight is approximately 40 pct lower than <BR>
the<I> </I>calcium-modified coating. <BR>
This shows that other phosphating solutions could be used to achieve 
the lower coating weight recommended by the adhesive manufacturer. It 
is suspected that the adhesive manufacturer's experience was with 
calcium-modified phosphate on steel and they assumed that the 
calcium-modified solution would provide a similar coating on zinc.
<P>A third investigation evaluated a phosphate coating on 
cyanide-zinc-plated parts for the purpose of applying an epoxy primer and 
urethane topcoat. Some time had elapsed (a few days to a week) prior to 
actually applying the phosphate coating. The zinc-plated parts were immersed 
directly into the phosphating solution as the parts were still perceived to 
be &quot;clean&quot; after zinc plating. A majority of the zinc surface had little or 
no phosphate coating. On another part, the only phosphate coating formed on 
a silicate inclusion (parts were sandblasted to remove rust prior to zinc 
plating) in the zinc plating. On still another area, where a fingerprint was 
obvious, a uniform fine-grain phosphate coating was observed with 
complete coverage. The fingerprint residue acted as a grain refiner. Some type 
of oxidation or passivation had occurred prior to phosphating, making the 
zinc surface relatively unresponsive to the phosphating solution. Since 
phosphate coatings form on cathode areas and the blast media would be a 
cathode with respect to zinc plating, the observation of a phosphate crystal could 
be expected on the particle of silica. Subsequently, an alkaline cleaner with 
a titanium grain refiner was used prior to phosphating. This coating 
provided an adequate paint base that successfully passed the paint adhesion test.
<P>There is still additional knowledge needed to be somewhat proficient

knowing what to expect when various types of pretreatments, 
activators and phosphating solutions are used to produce zinc phosphate 
coatings on zinc-plated surfaces. For those thinking about trying this or are 
doing it for the first time, this article should present some indication 
of the degree of complexity that is involved in applying quality 
coatings that enhance the functional requirements of coating systems.
<P>The federal specification for paint-based phosphate coatings, 
TTC490, states that phosphate coatings can be applied to substrates other than 
zinc-plated and steel parts2. Paint-based phosphate formulations can also 
be applied to galvanized steel, cadmium plating and aluminum. 
Phosphate solutions include nitrate, chlorate <BR>
and iron accelerated types, nickel- fluorides, calcium-modified, and 
manganese-modified (trimetal or polycrystalline) formulations applied by 
spray or immersion processes. Subsequent articles will show the results of 
using various phosphating formulations and processes and showing the 
resulting phosphate crystal structures.     <B>PF</B>
