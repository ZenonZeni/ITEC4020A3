<I><B>I plotted our dead reckoning with a series of fixes and reciprocal
bearings on shore lights.  To my delight, when we turned on the
radar set 45 minutes later, we were exactly where I said we would
be!—Marion

<I><B>I feel that we are a group now and everyone fits in somewhere.
 At times there are minor hassles, but for all practical purposes,
everyone is really for everyone else.  I'm really going to miss
them.—Josie

<I><B>While hauling in sails, the cry came from the bow, &quot;Help,
the jib's torn!&quot; Pat, Peter and I scrambled out onto the
bowsprit. The jib was flailing about like a banshee. Our knuckles
burned and our sore, calloused fingers yanked at the coarse, wildly
flapping canvas. The bow thundered as it was buried and we clung
with our toes curled around the bow net. The waves rushed over
our bodies, raising us off our feet...—Dan

<I><B>Ginny, who also just woke up, turned and kissed the hutch good
morning, then turned to me to explain that she was &quot;disoriented.&quot;
I'm sure that within a short period that we'll know this place in the
dark. I can't wait. I already feel like <I/>Westward<I> is partly 
mine.—Cindy

<I><B>This is my first night on the ship. Everything seems so unreal...
imaginary. The information is coming from all directions. This
is going to be an interesting trip.—Reid

<I><B>This is so exciting! It started out this morning as we watched
the sun come up between oxygen titrations in the lab and our first
sighting of land, the incredibly fertile green steep mountains
of Guadalupe Island. It was so beautiful and unimaginable that
I really did gasp when I walked out of the lab.—Cindy

<I><B>The water was so beautifully blue and it was really suprising
how many organisms that could be seen just floating.  I saw a
fantastically beautiful ctenophore about the size of my hand. 
It was so symmetrically delicate with its tiny combs moving in
waves.  Ralph and I tried to put it in a jar, but mangled it in
the process.  I could've cried - it was so sad.—Lisa

<I><B>Everything lately has been more demanding and exciting than I
expected. I think it's a combination of getting close to port
and also having more of a command over the vessel that makes you
proud of it.—Cindy

<I><B>Look out Main Saloon, &quot;C&quot; watch is on dawn cleanup!
But this is not your average dawn cleanup, but then again, &quot;C&quot;
watch is anything but average. Indiana Jones would be proud of
the way we fought against nature and against all odds in our never-ending
quest for a clean ship...—Zulu

<I><B>I'm the Engineer now and they just started the winch so I've got
to check the battery level pronto. We're doing an extra deep hydrocast
here in a small basin near Jamaica, trying to see if it's anoxic
at the bottom which would mean that the water doesn't circulate
down there. So we're going to test the oxyen right away and if
it's negative, they'll send down a Phleger core, expecting to
bring up some of that really ripe smelling black mud.—Cindy

<I><B>Sitting on the bowsprit with the wind beating on my face, watching
the shooting stars above (seven of them in one hour!).  The people
below are sleeping well because they know that we are on deck
operating the ship.  It's a good feeling to be responsible for
people.  There's so much to learn and so many mistakes made, but
a real sense of accomplishment when you do something right.  It's
challenging and sometimes frustrating, but for the most part, 
exciting.—Josie
