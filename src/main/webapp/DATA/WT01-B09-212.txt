LAWRENCE S. HAMILTON<P>

BECAUSE of their significant three-dimensional character, mountains and
mountain ranges have a heterogeneity, a fragility, a climate, and a
relative inaccessibility that present special problems in sustainable
development. Moreover they are the living environment for some of the
world's most ancient and traditional peoples, whose rich cultures are
being rapidly eroded. Biodiversity is high because of the variety of
specialised habitats among the differing faces and altitudinal belts of
mountains. Endemism is also high for the same reason, and because many
free-standing mountains are essentially islands. These characteristics
emphasise the need to have very large portions of our mountain heritage
in effectively-managed protected areas, ranging from strict nature
reserves to protected landscapes occupied by humans.<BR>
 <P>      IUCN has long been concerned about the mountain environment.
Current action centres on the Commission for National Parks and
Protected Areas (CNPPA), where since 1992 there has been a Mountain
Theme and a Vice-Chair for Mountains. The CNPPA Newsletter has a
mountain column, and a Mountain Protected Areas UPDATE is sent to 250
scientists and managers. Funding is sought for a Mountain Task Force.
        <P>The CNPPA Vice-Chair represented IUCN with partners who together
succeeded in placing a document and supporting material before the Earth
Summit, and the result was the adoption of a chapter on mountains in
Agenda 21, supported by all nations. He, along with Jim Thorsell,
represents IUCN in the Task Group formed by FAO to carry out the mandate
of this chapter, a Mountain Agenda, and a series of significant meetings
and activities have been stimulated by this group. Coming up, for
instance, are intergovernmental mountain sustainability meetings in
Europe (October 1996), Africa (June 1996) and North America (1997). A
global Mountain Forum for NGOs has been launched, sparked by the
leadership of The Mountain Institute in the USA. Mountain Associations
have been formed for the Andes, Africa, East Asia and the Pacific,
augmenting the existing International Centre for Integrated Mountain
Development which serves the Himalayas, Hindu Kush and Karakoram.
Interest in mountains finally seems to be crystallising and entering
political consciousness. It is important in this sustainable development
scenario that mountain protected areas play their needed role. More
protected areas of various categories are needed to fill in gaps in
biogeographic coverage and to link existing areas in conservation
corridors. In addition, improved management of existing areas is a
necessary accompaniment.<P>
        Some of the characteristics of mountain environments that
mandate special attention to these earth features are alluded to in the
introductory article of this issue of PARKS, along with some suggested
priority topics for conservation action. Other articles deal with: World
Heritage mountains; the sacred aspects of mountains; using the Biosphere
Reserve to achieve mountain conservation in Mexico; a fine example of
transfrontier cooperation between France and Italian protected areas;
the contribution to parks management made by developments in the
Australian Alps; and an update on the innovative institutional (legal)
device of the Alpine Convention in Europe.<P>

would like to join the Mountain Protected Area Network are invited to

<B>The role of protected areas in sustainable mountain development<P>

LAWRENCE S. HAMILTON<P>

Mountain regions seem to have common problems whether in Bolivia, Switzerland, Nepal or Uganda.  To name a few, they seem characterised by:
<UL>
<LI>Interesting and threatened cultures or livelihood systems
<LI>Narginalization economically, politically and in law enforcement
<LI>Outflow of young people and the skilled or highly educated
<LI>Outflow of raw materials to the lowlands
<LI>Heterogeneous environments due to various elevation zones, directional exposures and soils, and thus not easily masterplanned by recipes which may work in the lowlands
<LI>Ecologically sensitive to a high degree due to erosion, variable climate and extreme climate, and with slow recovery of fauna, vegetation or soils
<LI>High incidence of natural hazards such as avalanches, lava flows, landslides, earthquakes, torrents and rock falls, due to vulcanism, tectonic and topographic processes.
<DD>Any planning exercise for a mountain region as to guiding principles for sustainable development will be difficult because of the complexity of these problems.  Nevertheless, the attempt to draw up such guidelines for harmonious accommodation between nature, culture and economic aspirations is a worthy one.  What follows is at a sub-national regional scale for mountain environments in general, but the focus in examples is mostly on the Andes.</B><P>

WHEN CONFRONTED with the task of identifying 'beauty', it is generally
accepted that 'beauty is in the eye of the beholder'. There is little
agreement,
even when it comes to the natural beauty of the landscape. There is,
however, much more consensus on what is ugly or discordant, or what
constitutes a misfit in human society or in a landscape. Thus it was
that a nationwide campaign for 'natural beauty', instigated by the wife
of the President of the United States (Mrs Johnson) in the 1960s,
focused on reducing the amount of ugliness in the out-of-doors. One of
the most visible targets was the outdoor advertising billboard, and I am
happy to be able to say that I live in a state (Vermont) that was one of
the first to ban these visual blights on the landscape.<P>
        I feel very much that we have the same problem in trying to
identify and describe 'sustainability', which is the current conceptual
goal for local, regional or national planning and development.
Sustainability was the watchword coming from the Earth Charter, Agenda
21 out of the UN Conference on Environment and Development in 1992, and
there is now a global Commission on Sustainable Development charged with
guiding implementation of Agenda 21. The manual Caring for the Earth
(IUCN/UNEP/WWF 1991) is subtitled "A Strategy for Sustainable Living".
Yet there have been few, if any, successful identifications of when the
happy state of environmental sustainability has been reached (Carpenter
1993 and 1995, Cocklin 1989, Orians 1990). But as is true with easier
recognition of the ugly or the misfit, it is far easier to identify and
to measure unsustainability. Then by taking steps to reduce or eliminate
it, to approach a harmonious situation of sustainable use of an
environment such as one in the Andes. This I have called the 'back door'
approach. I would like to explore how this approach might be applied in
five aspects of mountain development, and then highlight eight key areas
of a mountainous landscape which might receive priority attention given
the fact that unlimited human and financial resources are not available
to tackle all elements and locations.<P>
        In many mountain regional planning units there is an underlying
acceptance of the need for: 1) productive, healthy forests; 2) a system
of viable protected areas; 3) sustainable tourism; 4) production of
quality water; and 5) maintenance of cultural values and traditional
lifestyles. Note that these aspects do not include mountain agriculture
or grazing, but the same principle applies. Let me offer some brief
comments on recognising and reducing unsustainability in each of these
facets of mountain development.<P>

<B>Forest Health</B><BR>
The term 'forest health' has come into vogue in the USA rather than
forest sustainability (Society of American Foresters 1994). My opinion
has been strengthened that recognising ill-health is easier, can often
be measured, and points toward action that leads to a healthy forest,
i.e. a sustainable one. A <B>major criterion </B>would be abnormal reductions
in productivity. And here I mean production not only of wood (timber,
fuelwood etc.), but of non-wood plant products such as fruits, medicinal
plants, nuts, mushrooms, resins, bark (for Taxol or other products) etc.
It should also include forest fauna ranging from game to be hunted, to
non-game for enjoyment or as part of the functioning ecosystem (e.g.
ants and earthworms). Where these 'products' are harvested, careful
monitoring of growth, yield and regeneration over long periods of time
is required in order to detect abnormal reduction, for there will always
be fluctuations. Separating overharvest from natural fluctuation, or as
Carpenter (1993) has put it "separating the signal from the background
noise", is the tricky bit and requires all the skill that foresters can
muster. The extreme example of abnormal reduction would of course be
loss or endangerment of a species, and this would indeed be a <B>second
criterion</B> for an unhealthy forest. Early recognition of endangerment is
required if appropriate health restorative measures are to be taken,
e.g. concern about the welfare of the tree species Alerce Fitzroya
cupressoides. A <B>third criterion</B>would be soil erosion, focused on that
caused by human activity in product removal. While some increase in
erosion inevitably accompanies any product removal activity that
destroys the ground cover or disturbs the soil, this must be held to a
minimum, and promptly controlled if it is occurring. Guidelines for
reducing the negative aspects of wood product removal have been produced
and are available (see for instance Hamilton 1987). A <B>fourth criterion</B>
would be evidence of forest decline or death due to pests, or to air
pollution from acid rain, photochemical smog or ozone. Air pollution
damage is not yet a major problem in the Andes but it is in many
mountain areas.<P>
        <B>Other criteria</B> of ill-health would be high rates of nutrient
loss (leaching or removal off-site by erosion, or by short-rotation
total wood removal), and slow or incomplete recovery from disturbance
(Smith 1984). Monitoring will detect these evidences of ill-health, and
curing them or preventing them moves us toward sustainability. Such
monitoring and a concern for sustainability should characterise all
Forest Reserves or National Forests, as protected areas.<P>

<B>A viable system of protected areas</B> <BR>
What would be a viable, adequate, sustainable system of protected areas
in a region, a state or nation? There have been a number of yardsticks
proposed having to do with adequate legislation, percentage of land area
protected (not a good one), coverage of major environments or ecosystems
(a very good one), an adequate protection staff, and so forth. However,
it is easy to be complacent and be satisfied with a system that
superficially looks good on paper, but that has symptoms of ill-health
on the ground. It is therefore important to monitor, to research for the
weak points, the signs of unravelling, the potential problems, and then
initiate course corrections in management or interpretation or policy. A
few examples might be illustrative. Increasing friction or conflict with
neighbours shows up in many ways such as fires, poaching, illegal forest
harvesting, vandalism, or anti-park sentiment that permeates local
politics; these need to be addressed early on, possibly by greater local
involvement in park planning or management, by effective community
meetings, by identification of local benefits to the community and then
informing them, and so forth. A decline in top predators is usually
noticeable as a symptom of failure (an inadequate protected area), but a
decline in amphibians which are an important part of ecosystem
functioning might escape notice unless monitoring is well done. Invasion
by alien species that adversely impact native species is another
indication of an unsustainable situation which needs to be addressed.
Other problems such as trail erosion, air pollution damage, garbage or
litter, conflict between hikers and bikers, are all symptoms of an
unsustainable situation, and need redress. Carrying capacity for
visitors is difficult to determine, but over-use and over-crowding are
recognisable. A very useful publication is IUCN's bulletin <I>Guidelines
for Mountain Protected Areas </I>(Poore 1992), available in English, Spanish
and Russian and in Japanese.<P>

<B>Sustainable nature-based tourism</B><BR>
Tourism has become one of the foremost economic activities around the
world. In developing countries alone tourism generated US$62.5 billion
in 1990 (WTO 1991). In mountainous areas which have often been
economically, socially and politically marginalised with relation to
lowland areas, tourism based on mountain scenic, biological, cultural
and geological resources has often meant economic salvation. Income from
tourism in some mountainous nations is often the first or second earner
of foreign currency. Nepal in 1983 earned US$45 million from visitors
primarily attracted by Himalayan geography, nature and culture, and
Rwanda's few mountain gorillas in Parc National des Volcans before the
recent strife earned the country about US$1 million in entrance fees
(WTO/UNEP 1992). Protected areas are the basis for much of the tourism-
generated benefits (and disbenefits) in a region or nation, and indeed,
under the best of conditions, tourism can serve as a self-financing
mechanism for establishment and maintenance of protected areas ranging
from national parks to cultural landscapes and natural monuments. Within
the underfunded protected area system of Perú, Huascarán National Park's
entire budget allocation from Lima is a return of 80% of the amount
collected by a US$1 equivalent entry fee per adult visitor at its two
principal entry stations (personal communication, René Valencia,
Huascarán National Park 1995). It is therefore extremely important that
the tourism/protected area situation be a sustainable relationship,
achieving true 'ecotourism' (as the current buzz-word has it).<P>
        Again, I believe that it is more pragmatic and easier to detect
signals of unsustainability. Adequate monitoring and research are key
activities in this process. Many of the negative signals are relatively
obvious, such as declining visitor numbers (unless war, terrorism,
visitor safety problems, economic downturns in the local, national or
world economies, and so forth, are producing a decline in several or all
protected areas). I will mention only a few that occur to me as needing
monitoring and early detection, followed by remedial action. If local
people come to view protected areas as being only for the benefit of
foreigners rather than also for themselves, the resentment spells
trouble. If governments in their desire to maximise economic returns
initiate the hallmarks of mass tourism such as large resort hotels, golf
courses, false cultural extravaganzas and heavy-duty roads, there is
trouble ahead for both the nature and culture bases of sustainable
ecotourism. Most of the signals of non-sustainability have to do with
exceeding a certain carrying capacity, and managers and policy makers
must have the wisdom of Solomon to determine what the various thresholds
are for such aspects as: overcrowding (both quantitative and
qualitative), noise, presence of human infrastructure, safety, and
irreversible site damage. There are ways of increasing carrying capacity
such as by geographic or time dispersal, good design, buffers, and
making the off-season more attractive. But first one must recognise the
problem. Some useful indicators come from visitor satisfaction surveys,
aberrant wild animal behaviour, vegetation or soil damage, rubbish
accumulation, and pollution of air or water (including loss of natural
sounds due to noise pollution). <P>
        A very helpful analysis of protected area tourism has been
prepared with the assistance of IUCN by the World Tourism Organisation
and the United Nations Environment Programme (WTO/UNEP 1992). A very
succinct statement of Principles for Tourism in National Parks has been
published jointly by the English Tourist Board and the Countryside
Commission (ETB/CC 1989). Also helpful in fostering sustainable tourism
are increasing distribution and use of visitor codes of conduct which
have been produced by church groups (New Zealand), environmental
societies (USA) and tourism organisations (World Tourism Organisation).<P>

<B>Water production</B><BR>
Water is one of the most important products of mountain areas, which
generally receive greater rainfall or snowfall than surrounding
lowlands. Mountains are water towers for human society. It is important
that this production be maintained in quantity, timing and quality. It
is true that the natural regime often does not suit the majority of
people downstream in the lowlands, who may receive too much water at
times and too little at others. Interventions have therefore been made
in the form of detention dams for flood reduction or for low flow
augmentation, and these are located in the mountain or foothill valleys.
With human occupancy of natural flood plains and a complex system of
water use in place for domestic, industrial, service, irrigation or
other agricultural use, it is important that mountain land uses do not
unduly impair this production system. Again we approach this from the
back door by recognising symptoms of deterioration or damage, rather
than of sustainability. Activities which drastically reduce vegetative
evapotranspiration (e.g. large scale clear-cutting of forest or land
clearing) increase the quantity of water discharged in the stream or
river coming from the watershed. If low flow is the main problem, this
may be a good thing, but if flooding is a problem, the additional yield
comes at flood time as well. On the other hand, cutting or clearing of
mountain cloud forests (selva de neblina, bosque de ceja) eliminates the
cloud water capture function of these important forests, and results in
less water available. These forests are particularly critical in the
yungas and on the drier western side of the Andes (Stadtmüller 1987).
Activities that compact the soil surface, reducing infiltration into the
soil mantle, alter the timing of water flow from the watershed, and
shorten the period between rain event and water discharge, thus
aggravating flash floods. It is important to recognise that both of
these effects on water yield diminish as the size of the watershed
increases. They may be very important in short, small watersheds such as
those coming west out of the Andes, but dwarfed by other factors in
large basins such as the major Amazon tributaries.<P>
        Perhaps the most important criterion of unsustainability is the
presence of human-induced sediment in water courses coming from the
mountains. Much sediment is natural erosion (e.g. natural streambank and
channel erosion), but sediment from human activities in the watershed
adds an undue and largely avoidable burden. Sediment impairs the water
for many uses such as drinking water, irrigation, and provision of
habitat for fish and other aquatic organisms. It also  reduces the
storage capacity of reservoirs, and eventually reaches the sea where it
may harm reefs and other marine life including near-shore fisheries.<P>
        Again, stream monitoring should detect unnatural increases in
sediment load, given sufficient record of normal fluctuation, and
inspection should reveal whether road construction, poor road
maintenance, poor logging, overgrazing, non-soil conserving agriculture
or building construction sites are the culprits causing watershed ill-
health. Traditional Quechua terraces (andenes) were excellent, but in
many places have been abandoned. Monitoring should also include scrutiny
for abnormally high levels of nutrients from fertiliser, pesticides, and
lead from automobiles. Since water is of such great importance to
society, regional land use control mechanisms to prevent water
production impairment are often relatively easy to have authorised and
implemented. Watershed protected areas have a key role to play, and many
more of these are needed.<P>

<B>Maintenance of culture and history</B><BR>
The final facet that I wish to treat as being an important element of
sustainable and quality living in the Andes (or other similar
mountainous regions) is that of maintaining the traditional cultural
richness and protecting the historic patrimony (e.g. pre-Columbian sites
and artifacts or traditional mountain livelihoods). While I indeed fully
recognise and support this need with passion, it is not an area of the
human state with which I as a mountain ecologist have as much expertise
as in the bio-physical sciences. If indeed the local communities of the
region are committed to slowing the rate of loss of their cultural
values and traditional life styles and livelihood systems, and to
protecting historical structures, artifacts and sites, then I feel the
same approach of looking for signs of unsustainability is appropriate.
This may be almost self-evident, since with historically valuable
physical material, conservators commonly do look for deterioration –
rotting timbers or missing roof tiles in buildings, air pollution damage
to statuary, etc. – and take restorative steps, but hopefully always
striving for authenticity.<P>
        For cultural value erosion, however, the recognition is more
complex, because change and transformation of many cultural values is a
normal and probably necessary part of an evolving society. This may be
especially true in mountain cultures worldwide where there is a general
outmigration of the skilled, the better-educated and the young, and
where new technologies are being urged or thrust upon traditional land
use systems by developers and donors from the lowlands or the world's
financial centres. I must leave it to others skilled in sociology,
anthropology, history or philosophy to identify the early warning signs
of cultural ill-health and to propose remedial actions that are
acceptable and desirable to the people involved. As an ecologist,
however, I do know that if the forest and wildlife are productive and
healthy; if all is well with the water; if the agriculture 'fits' and is
self-sustaining (not degrading the physical and human resources); if
there are protected areas providing adequate nature protection, outdoor
peace and recreation; if there is also a viable and economically
rewarding ecotourism; these can all help in concert to sustain many of
the cultural values and traditional livelihood systems. But there are
also pitfalls, and there are examples where inappropriate tourism
hastened the commercialisation or deterioration of a culture. Experts in
the behavioural and social sciences will be useful when working with
communities to define and achieve their local goals.<P>

<B>A few priority areas for sustainable regional development</B><BR>
This article has so far emphasised the great importance of research and
monitoring to detect signs of unsustainability as a strategy for a
harmonious mix of land or resource uses in a region. Let me at this
point conclude with a 'short list' of nine key environment elements for
special consideration, given that limited resources may restrict the
ability to tackle all elements of a regional mountainous landscape
through a planning process. All of these require or benefit from
designation in some kind of protected area. <P>

<B>1. Maintaining traditional cultures</B><BR>
One of the kinds of protected area recognised by IUCN is the <B>protected
cultural landscape</B>. This insufficiently used category provides support
for mountain people whose lifestyle and very cultural underpinnings are
being eroded, against their wishes, by exogenous forces of
'development'. Governments can recognise by official designation
mountain areas dedicated to maintaining the traditional land uses and
cultural manifestations of long-term residents (many generations) or
indigenous peoples. These are difficult areas to maintain effectively,
but many are serving well, for instance Cevennes National Park in
France's Massif Central.<P>

<B>2. Sacred sites</B><BR>
A second kind of area needing protection in mountain areas in particular
are those sites that have significant spiritual value. Every major
religion and most cultures have had sacred mountains or holy hills. One
thinks easily of well-known Olympus,   Zion, Ararat, Kailas, Fuji,
Tongariro, Tai Shan, Kilimanjaro, San Francisco Peaks, Mount Ranier. And
where there were no mountains, as in the Nile Valley, the constructed
pyramids were in the form of mountains as holy places for burial.
Bernbaum, in his fine book Sacred Mountains of the World (1990), has
documented many of these special sites of worship, fear or inspiration.
Pilgrimage is often a feature of these mountain sites. Perhaps the
pilgrimages of alpinists to difficult summits has also something of the
reverence and inspiration that makes these summits worthy of protection,
e.g. K-2, the Matterhorn or Mount McKinley. While many sites revered
internationally, nationally or locally have some de facto protection,
this needs to be reinforced by legal protection as heritage sites or
cultural natural monuments.<P>

<B>3. Habitats of rare and endangered species</B><BR>
The habitats of rare and endangered species for any region, and
especially endemics to the region, need protection from both ethical and
economic viewpoints. The conservation of the world's treasure house of
biological diversity is increasingly being recognised as an imperative,
even by politicians who have finally entered into a global Convention on
the Conservation of Biological Diversity. The high-elevation Polylepis
forests in the Central Andes need conservation not only because patches
of these forests themselves are disappearing rapidly, but because they
are habitat for many endemic, rare and endangered species such as the
giant conebill Oreomanes fraseri (O'Neill 1992). In Chile, the relict
species Cordillera cypress Austrocedrus chilensis needs emergency
protection. The threatened Alerce or Chilean false larch Fitzroya
cupressoides has been given some protection by having substantial stands
included in the Alerce Andino National Park in Chile (Weber 1990). The
Andean spectacled bear Tremarctos ornatus needs protection throughout
its range, which probably no longer includes Argentina and Southern
Bolivia. I agree with Dr E.O. Wilson who put it forcefully: <P>

"The worst thing that can happen – will happen in the 1980s – is not
energy depletion, economic collapse, limited nuclear war, or conquest by
a totalitarian government. As terrible as these catastrophes would be
for us, they can be repaired within a few generations. The one process
ongoing in the 1980s that will take millions of year to correct is the
loss of genetic and species diversity by the destruction of natural
habitats. This is the folly our descendants are least likely to forgive
us." (Wilson 1980.)<P>

Critical habitats for 'keystone' and 'flagship' species need to be
identified in a region, not neglecting plants or some of the less
attractive and less well-known small fauna species. Montane areas are
often the last bastions of wild nature in a sea of transformed
landscape, so the task of maintaining the natural heritage of a region
or a nation often falls mostly on the mountains. An adequate system of
protected areas of various kinds, might well blanket most mountain
areas. In the case of the continent-long Andean Cordillera, a corridor
of linked protected areas of various kinds, such as forest reserves,
national parks, wildlife sanctuaries and cultural protected landscapes,
would offer needed opportunities for migration and gene-flow of the
wonderful biodiversity of the Andes uplands. Such a linked network is
being developed in the Appenines of Italy with Abruzzo National Park as
the nucleus.<P>

<B>4. Riparian buffer zones</B><BR>
In my opinion, high on the list of the most important environments in
any landscape, whether mountainous or not, are the riparian buffer zones
of watercourses. As Hamilton and Pearce (1986) have pointed out,
maintenance of strips of natural vegetation along both sides of a stream
or river has many important benefits: reduction of streambank erosion,
trapping and immobilising sheetwash and rill sediments from up-slope
areas; trapping or filtering of nutrient and pesticide runoff from up-
slope; moderation of light and temperature levels in the water to the
benefit of fish and other aquatic life; provision of cover for wildlife
needing access to water; habitat corridors for terrestrial and avian
wildlife that permit easier migration and gene flow. Moreover such
buffer strips along the drainages give structure and pleasant pattern to
the mountain valley visual landscape. These riparian greenway corridors
are the natural skeleton on which the flesh of a region's intensive land
use is supported.<P>

<B>5. Summits</B><BR>
It is almost axiomatic that mountain summits, the most highly visible
parts of a regional landscape, need special consideration. Yet, they are
also favourite sites for some kinds of specialised infrastructure
developments, many of them with high levels of direct economic benefit.
Telecommunication devices, observatories, science complexes, ski-lift
terminals, and revolving restaurants are among the degrading debris on
many of our summits. Their associated construction and servicing needs
such as roads, add to the problem (though helicopters and automatic
equipment are reducing reliance on terrestrial access). While some of
these developments are needed for science, communication, and economic
uplift in a region, the identified sacred summits (using that word in a
broad sense of all that is elevating of the human spirit) need to be
protected, and alternative sites found for these other enterprises1.<P>

<B>6. Unstable slopes and avalanche hazard areas</B><BR>
Areas of soil or rock instability can and need to be identified and
given special attention so that risk and damaging use can be prevented.
Rock type, soil type, slope steepness, slope shape and rainfall
erosivity are all identifiable factors determining whether an area is
prone to surface erosion or mass movement (Megahan and King 1985). Such
areas should be mapped and zoned for special treatment, ranging from
total prohibition of use for areas of high landslide risk, to
performance standard controls for forestry, agriculture or buildings.
There is a public welfare issue at stake here, since the off-site
impacts of slope failure or severe surface erosion are visited on
neighbours, public infrastructure or public resources such as water
courses. Closely related to this of course is identification of snow
avalanche prone areas and the measures necessary to reduce risk of
damage by controlling land use. Mountain hazard mapping, and then zoning
high risk areas, are high on my list of priority actions.<P>

<B>7. Alpine grasslands and tundra</B><BR>
When inappropriately used, high elevation grasslands and mountain tundra
suffer rapid land degradation. Moreover they are slow to recover in
these climatically 'tough' environments. They therefore need a high
degree of conservation. The concern might also extend to adjacent or
related ecosystems such as shrublands and 'krummholz' which are also
very fragile. Domestic livestock (particularly sheep and goats),
tourists (and recreationists), and local populations living in these
high elevation environments are the principal damaging agents. In the
developed world's mountains, recreational motorised vehicles, hikers,
trailbikers and pack-animal safaris are of concern. Andean llama have
been introduced into the United States as replacements for pack horses
and mules where sustainable nature-based tourism is being practised.
This is because of the lower adverse impact in both feeding and
trampling compaction in fragile mountain grasslands. In the Andes the
pramo and puna environments suffer from unrestricted vehicle use,
pasturing of livestock and pedestrian travel. More areas of these two
ecosystems need to be brought under some kind of protection from these
impactors. Globally, in existing mountain national parks and other
reserves, controlling visitor numbers and their travel pathways is an
important management feature. The IUCN booklet <I>Guidelines for Mountain
Protected Areas </I>(Poore 1992) addresses these problems.<P>

<B>8. Mountain cloud forests</B><BR>
On the slopes (usually upper slopes) of many mountains, especially in
the tropics, occur important and unusual forest ecosystems known as
cloud forests. Each language has its own nomenclature for these
altitudinal belts: nebelwald, bosque de ceja de montaña, mossy forest,
forêt néphéliphile, selva de neblina, and many others. <P>
        Cloud forests occupy a relatively narrow altitudinal belt, but
the position of the belt varies widely. For large inland mountain
systems in the tropics (e.g. Andes, Rwenzoris) they may typically be
found between 2,000 and 3,500 m; whereas in coastal and island mountains
this zone may descend to 1,000 m (e.g. Hawai'i). On steep small islands
in very humid, equatorial conditions, a cloud forest may develop as low
as 500 m, or in rare cases 350 m (Gau in Fiji) (Hamilton et al. 1995).
The horizontal snow interception by conifer needles and twigs in some
Central European mountains (e.g. Krokno4e), where an "anemo-orgraphic
system" occurs at 1,000–2,000 m, expressed as heavy "harvesting" of SO2
and other pollutants, and resulting in forest decline, possibly
indicates a type of winter cloud forest in this geographic location?
Cloud forests occur within a wide range of annual rainfall regimes
(500–10,000 mm/year) and year-round moisture to very seasonal.<P>
        These interesting forests with their unusual physiognomy and
physiology capture 'occult' or horizontal precipitation by stripping
wind-driven cloud, and add it to the vertical precipitation supply of
the site. Evapo-transpiration rates are low in these forests, so that
there is a net addition of moisture to the ground because of the trees,
notwithstanding their use of soil water. Typical additions are between
5% and 20% of ordinary rainfall, but in some unusual cases of low
rainfall, but cloud contact, additions can be more than 100% of rainfall
(Bruijuzeel and Proctor 1995). If these forests are cut or cleared this
water capture is lost, and the water budget for the watershed is thereby
reduced. This has great significance for many communities in these low
rainfall areas.<P>
        Moreover, their biodiversity importance is very high (Hamilton
et al. 1995), particularly since they are often the last remnants of
wild nature on heavily-used and often abused mountains. Endemism is high
because these are specialised habitats that occur as restricted ranges
for many bird and other animal species (Long 1995). In Perú for
instance, Leo (1995) has shown that a high percentage of all country-
endemic vertebrate species is found in the montane cloud forest. For the
three groups of vertebrates that she analysed, of the 272 endemics in
all of Perú, 32% were found in cloud forest.<P>
        On the basis of the aforementioned values alone, not to mention
the other goods and services provided by these forests, they should be
given a high priority for conservation, and receive some kind of
protected area status. A summary of the state of knowledge of tropical
montane cloud forests has recently been produced by Hamilton et al.
(1995).<P>

<B>9. Zones of quiet</B><BR>
My ninth and final area of concern in this short list, is the impact of
noise – unwanted sound. Planning for any region where the underpinning
approach is to highlight nature and culture should have a concern with
noise pollution. The auditory assault of today's consumer society is not
only impairing human hearing and causing human stress, but is destroying
the song of the land whether it be the gurgle of a stream, a bird's song
or the tinkling of cowbells. While the noise of transporting machines is
unavoidable if people are to live in or visit a region, it need not be
everywhere, or the total level can be reduced in creative ways. A
concentration on ecotourism rather than mass tourism already puts a
region well on the way to keeping the problem manageable. <P>
        Positive steps need to be taken in these beautiful environments.
Zones of quiet could be identified, delineated and maintained where
pilgrims of peace and quiet might find sanctuary from loud radios,
vehicles and other jarring technological noise sources, including chain
saws. "Wilderness Areas" are now recognised as a special IUCN category
of protected area (Category Ib) along with Strict Nature Reserve, and
the international criteria include: "outstanding opportunities for
solitude, enjoyed once the area has been reached, by simple, quiet, non-
polluting and non-intrusive means of travel (i.e. non-motorised)". This
may be difficult to achieve in a long-inhabited and long-used area such
as much of the Andes, but it can be perhaps achieved in small, specific
areas to some degree. Even in areas of few or no inhabitants and no
roads in some parts of the world, the ubiquitous helicopter too
frequently shatters tranquillity and nature, as it brings tourists in to
view mountain areas of grandeur (e.g. Haleakala National Park and I have
just learned of problems at Machu Picchu, a site where contemplation
should be paramount). In a few areas aircraft overflights have been
banned, and there are height restrictions in others. It is an increasing
problem, and solutions are more difficult in view of the usefulness of
helicopters or off-road, all-terrain vehicles for rescue purposes in
mountain areas. Nonetheless aircraft noise must be addressed along with
other noise pollution sources. I have recently received from the
International Union of Associations of Alpinism its October 1994
resolution to all mountain governments with respect to control of
tourism aircraft flights in mountain regions and they are very tough
(UIAA 1994).<P>

<B>Coda</B><BR>
There are many other key environment elements of special consideration
(e.g. glaciers and caves) in developing a regional plan for maintaining
nature and culture, but space limitations preclude them. I have
emphasised the biophysical side and short-changed the cultural,
historical and metaphysical side. This is only because I have no
professional competence in these latter aspects of conservation. I have
also presented an overly-simplistic plea that because sustainability is
such a fuzzy goal, almost impossible of sure and measured achievement,
that we adopt a policy of activism in reducing unsustainability, which
is much easier to recognise. In both parts of this article I have
generalised to make the remarks applicable to planning for the
conservation and eco-development of mountainous areas at a    scale
within a national, provincial, state or prefectural boundary with
emphasis on the Andes.<P>

<B>The Sierra de Manantlán Biosphere Reserve:  conservation and regional sustainable development</B><P>

ENRIQUE J. JARDEL, EDUARDO SANTANA C. and SERGIO GRAF<P>

<B>This presentation of the Sierra de Manantlán considers the origin of the project, and gives a brief description of the environmental characteristics, social conditions and management problems of the area.  The conceptual approach to management and how we are working to attain the goals of a biosphere reserve are described.  Three main issues are discussed: the initial conditions that are determinant factors in conservation and development projects; the need to establish appropriate institutional mechanisms for land and resources management with a regional perspective beyond the protected area; and the need to develop a management approach with sufficient flexibility for implementing management programmes that assusre the conservation of biodiversity as well as the sustainable use of natural resources by local communit</B><P>

SIERRA DE MANANTLÁN Biosphere Reserve (SMBR) is located in the states of
Jalisco and Colima in West-Central México (see map). With over 2,700
species of plants (40% endemic to México) (Vázquez et al. 1995) and 560
species of vertebrates, including 26% of all mammal and 33% of all bird
species in México (Jardel 1992), it is among the top protected areas in
North America for biodiversity.<P>
        The reserve covers 140,000 ha, ranging from 400 to 2,860 m above
sea level. Its topographic complexity, wide altitudinal gradient,
latitudinal location, proximity to the Pacific Ocean, geological
history, and also its long history of human occupation and natural
resource use, have interacted to create a very complex landscape.<P>
        The Sierra de Manantlán forests play an important role in the
protection of watersheds that supply water to over 400,000 people. The
forests also harbour important timber and non-timber resources, which
support the livelihood of people in the area and represent an
alternative for the future development of local communities.<P>
        Agricultural fields and associated secondary vegetation in
hillsides and small valleys in the Sierra also contain important
components of biodiversity, comprising native landraces of cultivated
plants, their wild relatives and many other species of plants with local
uses for food, medicines, and fodder, among others (Benz 1988, Benz et
al. 1994).<P>
        The creation of the SMBR led from the discovery of a wild
relative of corn, the teocinte Zea diploperennis (Iltis et al. 1979),
that attracted international attention because of its potential use for
the genetic improvement of the second most important cereal in the
world. This perennial teocinte became a symbol of the need to conserve
wilderness areas for the genetic resources they contain. A small
protected area, called Las Joyas Research Station, was established by
the University of Guadalajara with support from the Jalisco state
government, to protect the habitat of teocinte. This led to the creation
of a local research centre that is part of the University of
Guadalajara, now known as the Manantlán Institute of Ecology and
Conservation of Biodiversity. This institute has played a catalytic role
in the promotion of conservation actions in the Sierra de Manantlán.<P>
        As knowledge of the mountain range increased, the one-species-
preservation approach developed into an ecosystem level approach where
the whole mountain range and its watersheds were considered as an
integral conservation unit. This in turn evolved a social component when
it became evident that the peasant communities owned the land and have
historic and cultural rights to use it. For the conservation project to
be successful the local communities had to benefit from the reserve, and
a national park or natural reserve model of strict protection was not
applicable.<P>
        The Manantlán Institute generated the technical information
needed to propose the creation of a biosphere reserve and generated
local, national and international support for this task. The reserve was
created by the federal government in March 1987 and one year later was
incorporated in the MAB-UNESCO network of biosphere reserves.<P>
        However, there is another history running parallel to the
creation of the Sierra de Manantlán Biosphere Reserve: the history of
the struggle between local indigenous communities and private logging
companies for the control of land and forest resources. Since the early
1900s foreign and national lumber companies began exploiting timber in
the forest of the Sierra de Manantlán by basically stealing the forest
resources from the indigenous communities. This process was interrupted
by the Mexican Revolution and later by the Cristero War, but it resumed
in the 1940s. The lumber companies exploited the old growth forests with
great profits, leaving to the communities insignificant economic
benefits, impoverished forests, internal conflicts and corruption. The
lumber companies also interfered with the process of agrarian reform in
the region, creating additional conflicts of land tenure (Jardel et al.
1989, 1992).<P>
        In the late 1970s, a local peasant movement increased the
struggle against the powerful lumber companies. This resulted in their
suffering greater persecution and repression, but they were able to stop
logging in parts of the Sierra de Manantlán. The University of
Guadalajara's proposal to create a biosphere reserve was seen by these
sectors of the local communities as an opportunity to establish
communication with the government agencies that had historically ignored
them and also to gain an ally in their struggle to defend forest
resources. Key groups in some communities supported the creation of the
biosphere reserve and defended the project against the reaction of
lumber companies and local power groups affected by the decree.<P>
        The Sierra de Manantlán Biosphere Reserve project is now based
on a model that attempts to integrate ecological conservation with
regional sustainable development, based on active participation and
cooperation among stakeholders, including local populations,
governmental agencies and academic institutions (Jardel 1992, Graf et
al. 1995, Santana et al. 1989).<P>

<B>Environmental and social conditions</B><BR>
The Sierra de Manantlán Biosphere Reserve is characterised by great
landscape heterogeneity. There are two main landscape units: a west-
central portion formed by igneous extrusive rock from the Tertiary
overlaid on Cretaceous intrusive rocks and the eastern portion formed by
calcareous rocks, also Cretaceous, with strong karst development and no
streams or rivers.
        The west-central portion can be divided into four landscape sub-
units:
<LI>      Highlands (2,300–2,860 m) covered with fir-pine-oak forests in
cold-humid sites, pine forests in poor rocky soils and broadleaved
forest in small valleys.
 <LI>      Highly dissected mountain slopes covered by deciduous oak
forests at low altitudes (1,000–1,500 m) and pine-oak forests at higher
altitudes (1,500–2,800 m). Sites with frequent fire disturbance or
landslides are dominated by pine forest, and deep ravines and valleys
maintain subtropical humid broadleaf forests.
<LI>      Hills and low mountains (400–1,000 m) with shallow rocky soils
maintain a vegetation complex that is dominated by deciduous oak
forests, tropical deciduous forests and tropical subdeciduous forests
depending on temperature and humidity conditions. A large part of this
landscape sub-unit is covered by agricultural fields, secondary
vegetation on fallow fields, pastures and forest fragments.
<LI>     Small inter-mountain valleys with deep soils that are dominated
by agricultural fields and secondary vegetation.<BR>
        The eastern portion is divided into two landscape sub-units:
<LI>    Plateau highlands dominated by humid oak forests, with
pine-fir-oak forest in cold sites, subtropical humid broadleaf forest in
ravines on the western slope, oak-pine forests in the drier areas, and
pine forests on poor soils or in areas with frequent disturbance by fire
or landslides.
<LI>    Sides of the plateau with steep slopes and shallow soils
that are covered with tropical deciduous forests and
agricultural fields and bamboo thickets.<P>
        Another landscape unit is the lower valley of the Ayuquila
river, an alluvial plain dominated by intensive agriculture, pastures
and relicts of riparian forests and subdeciduous tropical forests.<P>
        Forest management in these conditions is difficult, because of
the high environmental heterogeneity and the high species diversity of
the forests (Jardel et al. 1995). For example, the forests include 11
species of pines and 33 species of oaks, and more than 400 other species
of trees (Vázquez et al. 1995).<P>
        The creation of the reserve did not involve land expropriation.
It was basically a huge zoning regulation that established land use
restrictions. This is important considering that only 1% of the area is
government owned; 60% is communally owned land and 39% is private
property (Jardel et al. 1992). There are 26 agrarian communities and
some 80 private land owners. The population is dispersed in 79
localities within the reserve (Graf and Rosales 1995).<P>
        The reserve has 7,000 people living within its boundaries, but
we consider the population of the reserve to be some 33,000 people
living in agrarian communities that have rights over land within the
reserve area. Approximately 50% of the private owners have land tenure
conflicts with the local communities, and there are internal problems
within the communities themselves (Jardel et al. 1992).<P>
        Poverty is widespread, and within the state of Jalisco the
reserve population has very high rates of infant mortality, incidence of
infectious diseases, illiteracy and inadequate housing (Graf and Rosales
1995). These conditions translate into high emigration rates and social
strife.<P>
        However, there are differences in standards of living within
communities, as well as between communities and logging interests. The
development of cattle grazing in the forests has accentuated social
differences within the community. A few individuals have accumulated
wealth by increasing their cattle herds and this has allowed them to
fence communal areas and expand the land they hold, transforming forests
and agricultural plots to pasture (Gerritsen 1994, Graf and Rosales
1995, Graf 1992).<P>
        These conditions occur in the context of a prolonged economic
crisis that has strongly affected the agricultural and forestry sectors
in México, and is aggravated by the policies of structural adjustment
implemented by the government under the pressure of international
financial institutions and the influence of neoliberal ideology (Calva
1994, Jardel 1995). Changes in public policies and economic conditions
generate pressure on natural resources, reinforce social differentiation
processes and conflicts, and impose budget changes that affect technical
assistance programmes, research, education and other activities that
support conservation efforts. This also produces a shift from
traditional crops to informal economic activities, such as illegal
logging or marijuana and poppy cultivation, generating additional
pressure on resources. These conditions impose severe constraints on
many conservation and development projects.<P>

<B>Management problems</B><BR>
The reserve has many problems that are common to most protected areas of
México. These include:
<LI>     Transformation of forest cover to pastures and agricultural
plots.
<LI>   Erosion and low-productivity of hillside agricultural plots.
<LI>      Illegal logging.
<LI>      Excessive harvest of firewood.
<LI>       Poaching.
<LI>      Overgrazing and browsing in tropical forests.
<LI>      Forest fires.<P>
        Past logging practices have produced a forest characterised by
even-aged young stands (Jardel 1991), with a scarcity of high quality
timber for sawmilling. The forest products that can be generated have
low market prices, and there is therefore a need to invest in management
practices to restore the forest to an adequate condition for production.
The constraints of being situated within a biosphere reserve also impose
additional costs of managing for the maintenance of biodiversity, a cost
that traditional market mechanisms do not recognise.<P>
        The creation of the biosphere reserve without changes in the
tenure regime imposes a limitation of domain over land. Local
populations still own the land but cannot harvest its resources in core
zones and have conservation obligations but with no formal compensation.
This is especially critical in those communities where all their
forested lands fell within core zones. For example the ejido of Barranca
de la Naranjera is forced to protect the watershed in its land but
cannot even use the water for irrigation, because all the water in the
river is piped for use at a sugar refining mill outside of the reserve,
which maintains the regional economy. The ejido receive no compensation
for not using the forest and the water generated in its land.<P>
        Another problem is the pollution caused outside the reserve by a
sugar mill and small cities along the Ayuquila river, posing problems
for local communities that fish and use the water for irrigation
(Santana et al. 1993). This problem has now become a major conflict, as
the local communities perceive that the sugar mill is not doing its
share to diminish pollution and the government is not addressing the
problem.<P>
        The present rigid zoning regulations restrict implementation of
the management measures needed to restore sites affected by fires and
past logging activities. Also, they do not permit low-level traditional
extractive activities that are not damaging to the ecosystem, such as
collection of blackberries and mushrooms. Low-level hunting, a common
practice among peasants, is compatible with the conservation goals, and
yet cannot be implemented in the buffer zone. The prohibition of hunting
limits the possibility of managing this activity in a sustainable way
and promotes poaching. Even the conservation of species such as Zea
diploperennis involves active manipulation and disturbance that imitates
traditional shifting agricultural patterns (Benz et al. 1990). Legally
this cannot be done within the 'untouchable' core zone.<P>
        The lack of presence of government agencies before and after the
creation of the reserve forced the Manantlán Institute of Ecology to
fill the existing institutional vacuum. This involved conducting general
environmental education programmes and publicising the creation of the
reserve. It also involved holding participatory workshops in key
communities in order to develop a 'map of the social needs' of the
community and initiate a small sustainable development programme. The
Institute played the role of watchdog, manager, consulting authority and
many others, but without having the legal authority, budget or human
resources at the scale needed. Government agencies implemented regional
programmes without consulting each other or the local communities,
resulting in many programmes working in opposite directions. Many
agencies did not even want to recognise the existence of the reserve.<P>
        In 1993 the federal government began to take up its management
responsibilities by establishing a directorship of the reserve,
supported by GEF funds from the World Bank. This initiated a
consultation process between institutions and states to redefine the
management of the reserve and to establish the priority conservation and
social development guidelines and the responsible agents. The director
works closely with the University of Guadalajara and the Secretary of
Social Development (SEDESOL) to attack poverty and production problems
in the poorest communities of the reserve, and to develop a
comprehensive conservation and development plan for the region.<P>
        However, there is still a need to create an appropriate
mechanism that incorporates the government agencies involved in the
management of the reserve, as well as a providing a way for the
participation of all the legitimate stakeholders of the area and
allowing for formal conflict resolution processes and participative
planning (Table 1).<P>

<B>Conceptual framework</B><BR>
The reserve is now being developed under the following general concepts:<BR>
        1.      Ecological conservation and social development are
integrated as one whole management strategy.<P>
        2.      Applied research and education will fill the gaps in
knowledge of the ecological dynamics of a complex and heterogeneous
system, as well as produce the necessary human resources to apply an
adaptive management programme.<P>
        3.      The reserve is an integral part of a regional
development programme, and land use is based on a zoning scheme where
core zones of strict protection are surrounded by buffer zones with
different intensities of resource use and these in turn by transition
zones towards the surrounding region. Managers must dedicate as much
time to working on development programmes outside the reserve as they do
to resource protection within the strictly protected areas.<P>
        4.      Community-based management is the basis for the
management activities, linked to the sustainable use of resources in
buffer zones in order to protect the core zone effectively.<P>
        5.      Since there are many stakeholders (Table 1) involved in
the management of land and natural resources in the reserve, the
administration will be achieved through a committee mechanism that
allows for coordination among governmental agencies, local authorities,
scientific and educational institutions and NGOs, and has an integral
consulting process with the local communities of the different
management units of the reserve. These mechanisms serve to enforce
commitments of government agencies and other actors in the region, and
to mediate when conflicts arise.<P>
        6.      The reserve is seen as an experimental model of
management of an area for conservation and sustainable use of the
natural resources, an experiment whose failures and successes might be
useful in other regions of México with similar environmental and social
conditions.<P>
        All this is not just theory or a wish list. There are important,
albeit small, advances in the implementation of this model in the
region. Some examples are:<P>
        1.      The Manantlán Institute manages the Las Joyas Research
Station, which has allowed the establishment of long-term research and
monitoring projects and provides training and educational facilities. At
first, the Station generated problems with the local population, but
once programmes of technical assistance for forest management and of
land tenure conflict resolution were in place, the Station was seen as a
benefit. It now employs people from neighbouring communities, permits
peasants to continue with controlled collection of blackberries in the
area, and provides logistical support during the fire fighting season.
It serves to demonstrate successful management programmes such as
restoration of subtropical humid montane forests and recovery of locally
threatened wildlife species. This experience can now be applied to the
overall reserve programme.<P>
        2.      In the ejido El Terrero, we have established a
participatory development programme, the objective of which is to
improve a mismanaged and badly planned communal lumber mill. Achieving
this has involved a long-term commitment to community processes. It
includes organisation and planning, renegotiating debts with
governmental loan programmes, obtaining funds to modernise the mill and
training people to manage it, and conducting research on forest dynamics
and silvicultural treatments to allow for sustainable harvest, so as to
produce the expected social and economic benefits in a way compatible
with forest conservation.<P>
        3.      In the ejido of Zenzontla, people depend on agriculture
and cattle raising and there is strong pressure to convert the remaining
dry tropical forest to pasture. Our programmes have concentrated on
increasing agricultural productivity and stability by implementing soil
conservation practices on hill-side plots and introducing organic
farming practices. This not only reduces pressure on the forests, but
also reduces costs, as well as dependence from outside agents.<P>
        4.      In the ejido Ayotitlán, a region with a long history of
conflicts and disagreements over land tenure and the exploitation of
forest resources and mines by outsiders, we are beginning with a
programme of organic agriculture in cooperation with a local
organisation, the Indian People Union from the Sierra de Manantlán. We
also mediated with governmental agencies to reorient public investments
in social services and productive activities in a way compatible with
conservation goals.<P>

<B>Perspectives</B><BR>
In order to implement a project like the Sierra de Manantlán Biosphere
Reserve there needs to be a clear understanding of the initial
conditions that constitute the basic constraints for achieving
conservation and development goals, as well as the scales at which these
constraints operate. In this case the initial conditions at a local
level are:<P>
<LI>      Pressure over natural resources and unsustainable management.<BR>
<LI>      Extreme poverty and social differentiation processes.<BR>
<LI>       Social and land tenure conflicts.<BR>
<LI>       Absence of inter-institutional coordinating mechanisms.<BR>
        Those operating at national and international levels are:<BR>
<LI>      Economic crisis, being critical in the agricultural and forestry
sectors.<BR>
<LI>      Fundamental contradictions between economic and environmental
policies.<BR>
        Based on this analysis we can define two main strategies for
action:<BR>
<LI>      Improvement of natural resource management.<BR>
<LI>       Promoting changes in policy and institutional organisation.<P>
        Natural resource management includes protection, restoration and
production. Priority actions include developing a regional land use
plan, implementing more flexible approaches towards the management
programme, developing sustainable production systems for local
development and for conservation of biodiversity in forest and
agroecosystems, implement-ation of an interactive research-management
programme and enhancing management capabilities through education and
training.<P>
        Promoting public policy and institutional changes involves
creating an inter-institutional coordinating mechanism at the regional
level, establishing conflict resolution mechanisms that are recognised
by all stakeholders (Table 1), assuring a regional and local
participatory planning process, empowering local communities and
organisations to ensure democratic participation in decision-making and
negotiating processes, implementing environmental education programmes
at different levels and to different sectors of society, and reorienting
public policies and funding programmes to reflect real concern for
sustainable development and conservation.<P>

<B>Argentera Nature Park: scientific research, management and transfrontier cooperation</B><P>

PATRIZIA ROSSI<P>

<B>The Nature Park of Argentera (Italy) and National Park of Mercantour (France) together protect a total area of about 100,000 hectares corresponding to the Argentera-Mercantour Massif and its adjacent territories, in the heart of the Maritime Alps.<BR>

<DD>From the historical and cultural point of view, and from the scientific and naturalistic one, thee two parks represent the two complementary parts of what can be considered the first international park of the Alps.  They have been linked by a twining scheme since 1987 and are united by 33 km of common border.  Moreover, they actively collaborate in wildlife management and in some important scientific projects.  Their respective management agancies are completely independent from one another: one was created by the French Government, the other by the Italian Region of Piedmont.  Nevertheless, their cooperation is very close and successful.  From the conservation and protection point of view, both protected areas have quite strict regulations.  This paper describes the legal status of the parks, their conservation and cultural interest, management for tourism, and some of the research undertaken, including successful reintroduction programmes for birds and mammals.</B><P>

ARGENTERA PARK, even though it is a Regional Park, has a set of
regulations that in most respects is similar to that of the "central
zone" of French National Parks. Within the Argentera Park, one strict nature reserve and three
special nature reserves (see Map) were defined. One more reserve was
created to protect an important Mediterranean biotope: the Juniperus
phoenicea Reserve, outside the park territory but managed by the same
Board.<P>
        The Nature Park of Argentera covers nearly 26,000 hectares in
the Piedmontese province of Cuneo, including the upper Valle Gesso and a
small part of the Valletta di Aisone, in Valle Stura. It is the biggest
regional park in Piedmont and one of the largest in Italy. The park lies
on three communes which own most of its territory, as shown in Table 1.
There are no villages with permanent inhabitants within the park
borders, except the hamlet of S. Anna di Valdieri, with less than 100
people.<P>

<P>

        The protected territory is between the altitudes of 800 m and
3,297 m, corresponding to the southern peak (Cima Sud) of Argentera, the
mountain that gives its name to the Park. The Park headquarters is in
Valdieri, less than 20 km from Cuneo and not far from the Turin–Savona
motorway and the international road to the Tenda tunnel.<P>

        The park includes the upper basin of the Gesso river, with its
characteristic fan shape formed by several deeply carved valleys on the
northern side of the Maritime Alps. The main massifs (from west to east)
are those of Monte Matto, Argentera and Gelas, all with several peaks of
more than 3,000 m of altitude. On the Gelas Massif there are many
Pyrenean type glaciers, the most southern ones in the Alps.<P>
        The Maritime Alps have the appearance and the features of high
mountains (3,300 m of altitude, wild and rugged rocky peaks, snow-fields
and glaciers) only some tens of kilometres from the sea: in clear and
windy days, from the top of Argentera it is possible to see the
Mediterranean and Corsica.<P>
        Microclimate variety, geological circumstances, glaciations and
lithotype richness are responsible for the existence in the Maritime
Alps of a flora which is unique in Europe. Plants with very different
biogeographic origins (Pyrénées, Provence, Corsica, Balkans,
mediterranean and arctic regions) are found together here, and there is
a high density of endemic species, with several remarkable
'paleoendemisms' such as Saxifraga florulenta. According to Pawlowski
(1970), the Maritime Alps are the prime area for endemism in the whole
alpine chain.<P>
        As far as fauna is concerned, its density is one of the highest
in the Alps, with no apparent overpopulation. For instance there are
more than 24 chamois per 100 hectares and six eagle pairs in 26,000 ha.
The Argentera ibex colony was one of the first in the Alps to be
recreated from the last colonies of the Gran Paradiso. Moreover, a
European project has reintroduced the bearded vulture on these
mountains, since 1993.<P>
        In this area, man has lived in harmony with nature since the
prehistoric age. Here, thanks to the active and concrete collaboration
with Mercantour National Park in France, nature really has no
boundaries. Argentera Park does not simply have a task of passive
conservation. It has actively participated and still participates in the
fight against damaging developments and sponsors environmental
restoration initiatives, sometimes with public and private partners.<P>
        Since its establishment, Argentera Park has been a member of the
Federation of Nature and National Parks of Europe, representing Italy in
the executive committee of this organisation. For this reason, the Park
has frequent and interesting contacts with other European protected
areas. It has already had some temporary staff exchanges at various
levels with English and Spanish parks, plus experience and information
exchange with Eastern European parks (Triglavski Narodni Park, Slovenia;
Kiskunsag National Park, Hungary; Krkonosski Narodni Park, Czech
Republic). Close collaboration ties link Argentera Park to La Sierra de
Las Nieves Regional Park (Andalusia, Spain). Together, they sponsor a
scientific research programme on ibex, with the coordination and
supervision of the University of Turin, for a comparative study of the
alpine species and the Spanish one. In October 1992, the twinning of
these two parks was celebrated on the occasion of an international
scientific congress of the Capra genus, in Ronda, where the Spanish park
has its headquarters. A link is currently being formed with Huascaràn
National Park and World Heritage Site in Perú.<P>

<B>Legal status</B><BR>
Argentera Nature Park was established by the Regional Law n. 65 of 30
May 1980, on the basis of a regional outline law and of the Regional
Plan for Parks. It is managed by a public Board controlled and financed
by the Assessorato alla Pianificazione Territoriale, the department for
territory planning of Piedmont Region. The Park has a board of
directors, its own budget and its own staff. The rules for the use of
the park were adopted with Regional Law n. 16 of 30 March 1987.<P>
        Picking of botanical specimens, camping, dog access, motor-
vehicle access and fishing are strictly regulated. Lighting fires,
leaving litter, collecting minerals, fossils and insects, working
quarries and peat-bogs, and hunting are all forbidden. Lumbering within
the park borders is allowed only on the basis of the Forest Management
Plan, but it is forbidden in areas of particular protection (Strict
Nature Reserves and Special Reserves). It is also forbidden to build new
roads and infrastructures that are not included in the area plan. This
plan allows only the interventions which are necessary to carrying out
the Park's activities and to the fulfilment of its aims.<P>

<B>Cultural and historical interest</B><BR>
The most ancient vestiges of the human colonisation of these territories
date back to the Bronze age (between 4,000 and 3,000 before present). In
the valleys of Vallée des Merveilles and Fontanalbe (Commune of Tende,
Mercantour National Park) there are more than 100,000 incisions carved
on the rocks polished by glaciers during the Quaternary. Recently, the
Soprintendenza Archeologica (the archaeological board) of Piedmont and
the Civic Museum of Cuneo promoted an archaeological campaign which
revealed interesting discoveries in Argentera Nature Park, in the glen
of Vej del Bouc: graffiti, pottery and the remains of a Bronze age
village.<P>
        In those ancient times, shepherds and their flocks were already
moving along the sides of these mountains for which they had a sort of
religious respect. Even today, peaks and ridges are not a frontier:
pasture lands and shepherd huts ('gias') are spread all over the
territory.<P>
        The village buildings are characteristic: on the French side,
there are houses with 'colombages' roofs, while on the Italian
territory, there are still old villages, now mostly abandoned, with
thatched roofs. The Park is preparing a project which includes the
restoration of one of these villages to create an 'ecomuseum'.<P>
        The period of the Royal Hunting Reserve (1857–1946) left several
traces: various royal hunting residences in San Giacomo, Sant'Anna di
Valdieri, Terme di Valdieri and Valasco, hunting lodges and huts at high
altitudes and, most of all, many tracks that cover the whole territory
like a cobweb. During the period between the two world wars, many
military tracks were built using natural materials: an example worthy of
copying. For this reason, the area plan fixed a series of rules for the
respect of traditional building criteria, both for house restoration and
construction of new infrastructures.<P>

<B>Scientific research and nature management</B><BR>
Scientific research is particularly important for the activity of the
Park, both for the protection and enhancement of the environment and for
enjoyment, information and educational activities.<P>
        Scientific research is carried out directly by the Park staff
with the coordination and supervision of qualified experts (professional
researchers and university professors). <P>
        Collaboration with universities goes further, through the
realisation of stages and 'in field' activities (University of Milan –
Faculty of Natural Sciences) and through the assignment of graduate
theses on specific subjects (University of Turin – Institute of Geology
and Veterinaria; University of Bologna – Institute of Entomology;
University of Genoa; University of Pisa).<P>
        The Park has a 'foresteria' in Sant'Anna di Valdieri, with
guest-rooms especially prepared to give hospitality to researchers and
students who are doing their studies in the park.<P>
        Scientific research includes a series of essential operations
and routine activities, usually managed by Park personnel. The Park has
a computer data bank to catalogue all the observations recorded on
special forms by the rangers out in the Park. The data bank includes the
following sections:<P>
<LI>      amphibians and reptiles
<LI>       birds (with a special section on eagles)
<LI>      mammals (with a special section on ungulates)
<LI>      flora and vegetation. With regard to flora, the park has
prepared a herbarium including more than 600 species, with some 1,200
samples. <P>
        Other routine observations include checking of eagle nesting
(all eyries are listed and the breeding pairs have been monitored since
1984) and an annual census of ungulates.<P>
        A big (Italo-French) research project is under way studying
atmospheric pollution across the border and the damage to high mountain
conifers. The geographical extension of the project area covers the
western Alps with particular reference to the protected areas:
Argentera-Mercantour, Queyras-Val di Susa, Vanoise-Gran Paradiso. In the
Maritime Alps in particular there has been a yellowing of the leaves of
the species Pinus cembra and Larix decidua which, from the first
results, would seem to be caused by ozone pollution combined with
exposure to strong sunlight.<P>
        Among the most significant scientific initiatives of the park
are the creation of a botanical garden in Terme di Valdieri and the
reintroduction operations of ibex and bearded vulture in close
collaboration with the Mercantour National Park.<P>

<B>The alpine botanical garden "Valderia"</B><BR>
The extraordinary features of the park flora have already been
mentioned. These features explain why botanists have visited this area
for hundreds of years. In the 18th century, Allioni described for the
first time the species Viola valderia, an endemic violet that he found
on the gravel bank of the torrent in Terme di Valdieri. It is exactly
here, in the 'locus classicus', that the botanical garden with the name
of this endemic violet has been created. Works started in 1987. On 14
July 1990, in the presence of illustrious botanists from Italy and
France, the garden was inaugurated and opened to the public. Valderia
was designed on the basis of totally innovative criteria: it is neither
a 'classic' alpine garden with a collection of mountain flora specimens
coming from all over the world, nor a botanical garden with rigorous
geometric structure formed by squared flowerbeds and parallel paths.<P>
        It is rather the best possible reconstruction of all the
different habitats of the park, each one with its main indigenous
botanical species. Thus, it is divided into 'habitats', some of which
were already present while others have been artificially recreated: the
megaphorbiae association, the meadow, the crag and the detritus, the
grassland, the peat-bog, the stream, the shrubs, the herbaceous
understorey. Each one is interpreted with a wooden panel describing its
main features. In each habitat there are labelled specimens of the most
remarkable and typical species (more than 400).<P>

<B>Reintroduction projects: animals do not respect frontiers</B><BR>
Argentera and Mercantour parks inherited from the Royal Hunting Reserve
a long tradition of fauna management, even though the interventions were
justified by hunting interests rather than protectionist concerns. The
introduction on the French territory, in the 1950s, of a non-indigenous
species, the moufflon, must be considered in this context. Great
importance is given to the reintroduction of ibex on the Italian
territory in the 1920s with animals captured on the Gran Paradiso, thus
creating the first new colony of ibex in the Alps. Starting in the 1970s
some studies on migration (Pfeffer and Settimo 1973) proved the
existence of important migrations across national borders, with ibex and
moufflon moving from opposite sides. In summer, ibex migrate towards
French territories and, at the beginning of autumn, they come back to
Italy to their winter range. On the contrary, moufflon cross the
frontier to Italian territories in late summer but go back to France to
winter at lower altitude.<P>
        The importance of controlling these migrations and establishing
common and coordinated fauna management urged Argentera and Mercantour
parks' managers to strengthen their collaboration through the exchange
of data and common censuses and controls. The most significant
collaboration initiative is Operation Ibex, an important scientific
project that included the creation of two new ibex groups, one on the
Italian territory, the other on the French territory, in areas that had
not previously been colonised.<P>
        This operation was conducted in Italy in 1986–1987 with 46 ibex
releases. In France the operation took place for the first time in 1987,
with 13 ibex captured on the French territory; then in 1989 the
operation was repeated with 15 animals from Argentera Park, where the
capture was easier. Today the operation can be considered totally
successful.<P>
        The second operation concerns the bearded vulture Gypaetus
barbatus, the largest European bird, which disappeared from the Alps at
the beginning of this century. In 1975 IUCN promoted an international
programme of reintroduction in the Alps, which obtained the support of
WWF International. In 1987, on the basis of historical and ecological
data, the Argentera Regional Nature Park and the Mercantour National
Park proposed their common candidature as a reintroduction site. The
special International Commission gave its full approval and the
Argentera-Mercantour became one of four release sites in the Alps. Among
the reasons for the support of the experts was the presence of two large
protected areas, with 33 km of national boundary in common, the strong
will of the managers, and the good organisation of the Parks, based on
the work of 60 rangers and the extension of the protected territory
(100,000 hectares). In particular, this size factor is extremely
important, if you consider that a bearded vulture can cover hundreds of
kilometres in a short period of time.<P>
        After years of careful preparation (information campaign,
exhibition, brochure, film, drawing competition for school children; all
operations were conducted together by the two parks, with an Italian and
a French version) finally the first release took place in the Mercantour
in 1993 with three birds, followed by Argentera in 1994 with the release
of two bearded vultures. Placed in an artificial cave in the Valasco
Valley on June 14 1994 at the ages of 95 and 92 days, they were then
followed constantly by a team of experts until a month after their first
flight.<P>
        Considering that this is one of the most popular areas of the
parks it was necessary to take particular measures: road closure,
limitations for hikers, constant presence of rangers. This activity
generated enormous interest among the public and in the media (articles
in daily papers and on television). We have received reports of
sightings from many different sources: hunters, mountaineers, trippers
and shepherds. The releases will continue alternately in France and in
Italy for a period of ten years.<P>
        It is also of great importance to mention the appearance of
wolves on the French side of the Alps: six wolves were sighted together
in the winter 1993/94 in an area not far from the border. These probably
came from the Italian wolf population in the Appennines (the nearest
stable recorded group – 150 km as the crow flies – is in the Liguro-
Piedmontese Apenine in Val Borbera on the border between the province of
Alessandria and Genoa). In summer 1995, there was the first sighting for
the Italian side of the Maritime Alps. An important joint project has
been prepared with the Mercantour National Park covering scientific
research and an information campaign. We have also been in contact with
the Abruzzo National Park in Italy because of their specific experience
in this field and with the Yellowstone National Park in North America,
where a wolf reintroduction took place recently.<P>
        The figures for the latest censuses of the larger animals
(chamois 4,500, ibex 600, eagles 7 pairs) show a general increase.<P>
        In accordance with the regional law n. 36/90 which legislates
fauna management, selective culls on boar and moufflon were carried out.
The former are supernumerary and have caused considerable damage to
agriculture. The latter are not an indigenous species and are in
competition with the chamois. The culling operation was carried out by
the rangers in collaboration with local hunters; this fact has helped to
create a positive collaboration between the Park and hunters. In
addition animals have been captured for repopulating other areas:
chamois (for the Monte Baldo area and the Province of Brescia) and ibex
(repopulation of the Forest of Tarvisio Nature Reserve, Eastern Alps,
and Parco Naturale Adamello-Brenta, Central Alps).<P>

<B>Effectiveness of protection</B><BR>
During the second World War the ungulate population fell by 80% but,
when hunting was forbidden again, it rapidly grew. Thus, the Hunting
Reserve did protect the animals in quite an effective way. However the
natural environment suffered many setbacks before the establishment of
the Park. For example, in the 1960s an international road tunnel, the
Ciriegia-Mercantour, involved the construction, of a short demonstration
tunnel (1 km), now closed. The most significant intervention was the
construction of two hydroelectric dams and one hydroelectric underground
power station in the 1970s. However, Argentera Park, after its
establishment in 1980, succeeded in preventing an even more damaging
development, the construction of new canals to collect water from nearby
glens. This project would have produced the same damage on all the park
territory that is now evident only in the Vallone delle Rovine. However,
since the early stages of its activities, the Park developed close
relations of collaboration with ENEL, the Italian hydroelectric board,
which started an exemplary programme of environmental restoration. This
programme includes removal of unnecessary material, consolidation and
grass covering of scarps. Moreover, at the power station, ENEL is
preparing an information centre on its plants which will include a
section dedicated to the Park and the delicate relations between
development and nature conservation. In the same valley the Park has
planned a picnic area by the semi-artificial Rovine Lake, with two aims;
that of restoring a ruined area and also creating an outlet (already
used as it is) for the massive influx of Sunday trippers.<P>
        Another positive aspect that should be stressed is the
successful degree of naturalisation of the artificial basins. This is
proved by the fact that one lake (La Piastra, about 1,000 m above sea
level) has become an important halting-place for migratory birds. During
recent years, interesting observations have been recorded of rare birds
and species coming from Northern regions: mallard (Anas platyrrhyncos),
teal (Anas crecca), tufted duck (Aythia fuligula), goldeneye (Bucephala
clangula), wigeon (Anas penelope), eider (Somateria mollissima), fulmar
Fulmarus glacialis (first Italian observation), grey heron (Ardea
cinerea), cormorants (Phalacrocorax carbo) and gulls (Laridae).<P>
        Another threat to the environmental integrity of Valle Gesso is
represented by limestone quarries that supply local cement-factories
with raw materials. In this case too, the Park obtained a positive
result with the creation of the Special Nature Reserve of Juniperus
phoenicea, for the protection of a remarkable mediterranean biotope of
calcareous crags. The Reserve succeeded in limiting the expansion of the
quarry, thus allowing the nesting of peregrine falcon (Falco
peregrinus).<P>
        Finally, the Park limited and controlled the expansion of
tourism, which started in the late 1960s, thanks to the "area plan", a
means of territorial and urban management. Moreover, it succeeded in
keeping the few, small ski-lifts outside the park borders.<P>
        A fundamental contribution comes from the Park rangers'
activity, the purpose of which is essentially educational but, when
needed, is also enforcement. Thanks to them, the behaviour of tourists
and visitors has definitely improved; actually, they are now more
respectful and more conscious of how to behave in the natural
environment.<P>

<B>Recreative, educational and sport interest</B><BR>
Alpinists started to explore the Maritime Alps during the drawing up of
the "Carta degli stati di S.M. di Sardegna", the map of the Savoia
kingdom (around 1830). However, at the time these mountains were
interesting for essentially geographical and military reasons. That is
why the first people to climb their summits were officers of the
Sardinian Army. Mountaineering had its golden age during the romantic
period, at the end of the 19th century.<P>
        English and German climbers were the most active at this time,
but the American Reverend Coolidge also deserves to be mentioned. He was
the first to climb the Canalone di Lourousa, an impressive slide of ice,
900 m from top to bottom and with a 45 degree gradient, and, after a
traverse on a ridge, he conquered the southern peak of the Argentera,
the highest summit in the Maritime Alps. Then came the French helped by
local guides. In 1930, Victor de Cessole succeeded in conquering the
Corno Stella, 'the noble cliff' and 'last peak of the old Europe thought
to be inaccessible', thanks to his guides Plent of S. Martin Vesubie and
Ghigo of S. Anna di Valdieri.<P>
        Nowadays, mountaineering is very much practised in this area;
there are climbing faces and routes for all skills of alpinists and new
routes continue to be opened. Hiking too is very popular, thanks to the
extraordinary network of mountain paths, with nine mountain huts and six
bivouacs of the Italian Alpine Club (CAI).<P>
        The territory lends itself also to other sporting activities:
canoeing, mountain-bike, pony-trekking and alpine skiing. The Park can
control sporting activities and avoid excessive disturbance by limiting
access to its territory and the regulation of timing of activities. As
far as general enjoyment is concerned, the Park has carried out
significant educational activities for many years now, in collaboration
with all kind of schools, from primary to university level. Each year,
detailed programmes are put forward for instructional activities, from
guided visits to various kinds of projects on specific subjects. For its
visitors, the Park has an agreement with local hotels and its own
guesthouse, the Casa del Parco in Trinità di Entracque, with 35 beds,
several rooms and teaching equipment to be used during 'green-week'
stays and courses for students from primary to high school. For
university students conducting specific studies or preparing their
graduation theses, there is the already mentioned "Foresteria" in
Sant'Anna di Valdieri.<P>
        Moreover, in Entracque, there is a visitor centre, with a
permanent exhibition to introduce the Park to the public, and an
information office, where brochures and other publications are
available, some free and some for sale. The visitor centre also offers
an instruction room for lessons, seminars and audiovisual activities.
Another visitor centre, open in summer, has been set up at Terme di
Valdieri near the Botanical Garden. It has various facilities and an
exhibition on the Park's flora.<P>
        The Park is fully equipped to produce its own video cassettes
and audiovisual material for didactic and educational purposes. Finally,
in the Park building in Valdieri, there are all the administration
offices, plus a small library, video and photo archives, the already
mentioned herbarium, a laboratory for the preparation of naturalistic
specimens to be used in visitor centres and in teaching activities, and
a carpentry-workshop for preparing signs, information boards and wooden
equipment for picnic areas. For the moment, two such areas have already
been equipped (Ciriegia and La Piastra), and two new ones are under way
(Rovine and Terme). The aim of this latter kind of intervention is
essentially the concentration of the presence of tourists in less
vulnerable areas, where enjoyment can be more easily controlled.<P>
        Finally, Argentera and Mercantour Parks have confirmed their
affinity through a common information policy. In particular, they have
produced a bilingual brochure of presentation of the two parks on the
occasion of their twinning, bilingual brochures on ibex and bearded
vulture, an exhibition on this rare bird, a common poster on Argentera
and Mercantour, a guide-book for hiking and, recently, a brochure on
transfrontier trails for pony-trekking.<P>
        Their historical ties and their present active cooperation
convinced the Argentera and Mercantour managers to coordinate their
respective efforts, with the ambition of obtaining the European Diploma
for each of them.<P>
        The initiative was successful: for the first time two
neighbouring Parks were awarded with the Diploma at the same time (16
October 1993). The Diploma has strengthened the cooperation: after the
ibex and the bearded vulture projects, the wolf project is under way.
Besides this, there is the operation "Mountains without frontiers": 20
border itineraries from La Maddalena pass to the Mediterranean in the
Franco-Italian protected area of the Maritime Alps. It is a boxed set
containing a book (in French and Italian) and 1:50,000 maps, with all
the practical and tourist information on the villages and the natural
environment along the routes: frontiers should not exist for animals or
for humans!<P>

<B>Protected area increase</B><BR>
Recently it was announed that Argentera Park would change its name and
become bigger still: in April 1995 the protected area was enlarged to
include the neighbouring "Bosco e Laghi di Palanfrè" Nature Reserve
which was run independently (1050 hectares: see map). The management of
the two protected areas has been concentrated into one body which will
be called the Maritime Alps Nature Park (= Parco Naturale Alpi
Marittime). The staff have been amalgamated too, and go from being 27 to
36 in number.<P>
        Over 1,200 hectares of new territory has been included with the
addition of part of the Sabbione valley, an unspoilt and scenic valley
bordering on the French Mercantour National Park. From a naturalist's
point of view this territory is extremely important, because it is
between the crystalline massif of the Argentera mountains and its
surrounding sedimentary base. The flora is, therefore, very varied and
we can add the species that are typically endemic to limestone soils to
the Park's list, amongst these the prestigious Primula allionii. As far
as the fauna is concerned we should have better conservation of the
chamois population, because a stretch of land where hunting was
permitted has been eliminated. Fortunately the local huntsmen did not
protest, because they realise the importance of the park in acting as a
game breeding ground for the surrounding area. In this way we have given
an efficient and concrete response to one of the suggestions made along
with the European diploma which looked towards an improvement in the
boundaries for a better management of the biotopes. The new enlarged
regional protected area is now one of the biggest in Italy, coming close
to 30,000 hectares, and could be considered the nucleus of the possible
Maritime Alps National Park, which the national framework law refers to
and which many hope to see instituted.<P>

<B>The Australian Alps National Parks and protected area management</B><P>

GRAEME WORBYS<P>

<B>The Australian Alps comprise the highest parts of the Great Dividing Range and associated mountains in the south-east of the Australian continent.  Over the last 70 years historical exploitation and inappropriate land use within the Allps have mostly been replaced with conservation management practices.  This has included the establishment of contiguous protected areas across three Australian states reinforced by a transboundary cooperative management agreement between three State Governments and the Australian Federal Government.
<DD>This paper briefly describes the land use struggles and key developments leading to the establishment of the Australian Alps National Parks, one of the great systems of protected areas of the Australian continent.  It provides an account of how park management principles and practices evolved strongly in the Alps, often in response to hard experience gained from the conservation versus historical and contemporary land use debates at hand.  The paper also discusses how park management expertise gained during the evolution of the Alps parks has had significant benefits to protected area management practice throughout Australia and internationally.</B><P>

THE AREAS generally known as the Australian Alps (the Alps) comprise the
highest parts of the Great Dividing Range and associated mountains in
the
south-east of the Australian continent (Costin 1989). Of the 25,000 km2
covered by the Alps (Costin 1989), about 15,300 km2 (62%) is permanently
conserved in its essentially natural character within protected areas
(Worboys et al. 1993). <P>
        The Alps (see map) represent only about 0.3% of the Australian
land mass and include all of the mainland snow country (approximately
5,200 km2 above the average snowline of 1,370 m) as well as Australia's
highest mountain, Mt Kosciusko (2,228 m). They enclose slopes and
valleys running both inland and towards the coast down to approximately
200 m above sea level (Costin 1989). Water originating in the Alps is of
national and regional importance, being used to sustain agriculture in
one of the most productive areas of Australia (Lawrence 1993), the
Murray-Darling basin river system. The river system, the largest in the
Australian continent, receives about one-quarter of its average yield
from the Alps even though the Alps only occupy about 1% of its total
area (Costin 1967). By Australian standards, the variability of the
runoff from the Australian Alps is low. Water from the Alps is also used
for domestic consumption and hydro-electric power generation.<P>
        The Alps are rich in natural and cultural heritage. They contain
species and features not found anywhere else in the world, such as the
mountain pygmy possum Burramys parvus and the corroboree frog
Pseudophryne corroboree, both of which are endangered species; they are
an area isolated from other mountain chains of the Southern Hemisphere
and they are of considerable antiquity. An environment type that
contrasts dramatically with the rest of the continent, the Alps are an
outstanding area recognised for their national and international
significance. The Alps are listed on the Register of the National Estate
and Kosciusko National Park is a World Biosphere Reserve.<P>

<B>The development of protected area principles and practices</B><BR>
The heritage and inspirational values of the Alps provided a unifying
element for many individuals and visionaries associated with the areas
(Mulvaney 1992). The ambience and quality of the landscapes, the moods
of the weather – these are some of the factors that inspired individuals
to work with great energy and commitment towards a common goal of
conservation for the Alps. The role of key individuals whose
conservation work was often undertaken against tremendous odds and
opposed by land use cultures practised for several generations is
discussed below.<P>

<B>The Alps before 1944</B><BR>
Richard Helms (Helms 1893) documented the negative impacts of grazing on
the New South Wales (NSW) section of the Alps but little occurred to
rectify the situation until the 1930s, when severe disquiet about the
impacts of traditional land use practices on mountain catchments in the
Alps began to gain momentum.<P>
        The severe degradation in the catchment areas of the NSW Alps
was investigated by Forester Baldur Byles in 1931–1932. Byles focused on
the protection of the Murray Catchment above the then proposed Hume Weir
which was completed in 1936. His report called for the rehabilitation of
the eroding areas and for rangers to control grazing (Byles 1932).
Byles' conservation recommendations, however, were not based purely on
utilitarian values. He also deeply appreciated the intrinsic natural
values of the NSW section of the Alps and became one of its staunchest
conservation advocates (Gare pers. comm.).<P>
        During this period, Victoria suffered devastating dust storms
and major wildfires in January 1939. In the patchily burnt Victorian
Alps, the prolific regeneration of grasses and shrubs attracted cattle
grazing, exacerbating the post-fire soil erosion in Victoria's high
country. Concern was raised, and in 1940 Victoria passed the Soil
Conservation Act, under which Victoria's Soil Conservation Board was
established to address the problem of soil erosion in the state
(Gillbank 1992).<P>
        This was an important step because it led to the formal
introduction of scientists into the management of the Victorian Alps.
The Soil Conservation Board sought help from the Professor of Botany at
Melbourne University, who arranged for Stella Grace Maisie Fawcett MSc
to undertake an extensive ecological survey of the Hume Catchment
(Gillbank 1992). Maisie Fawcett also turned her attention to the Bogong
High Plains and initiated long-term exclusion plots and surveys of the
effects of grazing on the high mountain catchments of Victoria. Her
early reports clearly identified the soil erosion problems and the
adverse affects of burning and grazing. Her role was the beginning of
the powerful part scientists were to play in the future land use and
management of the Alps. <P>
        During the 1930s and early 1940s the nucleus for a conservation
area in the Snowy-Indi area (the Alps in the NSW/Victorian border area)
was proposed by Myles Dunphy (Mosley 1992). This was the first
substantive recognition of the need to conserve the intrinsic heritage
values of the Alps. Although The Snowy Mountains National Chase,
together with some small reserves over the limestone areas in the NSW
section of the Alps, had been established earlier, these were largely
ineffectual in protecting the Alps in NSW (Stanley n.d.).<P>
        In 1938, the NSW Soil Conservation Service was formed (Mosley
1992) to conserve and protect the catchments of the Alps and other areas
of NSW. This convergence of concern over the catchments was also
promulgated by the potential of the catchments to sustain hydro-electric
developments. Sir William McKell (Premier of NSW) and Mr Sam Clayton
(the new Commissioner of Soil Conservation) were the principal players
involved in the concept of the improved conservation of the NSW section
of the Alps during the early 1940s (Worboys 1994). Clayton was a driving
force behind the need to conserve the NSW Alps as a catchment area
(Costin pers. comm.).<P>

<B>The 1944 Kosciusko State Park Act, and the Alps during the 1950s and
1960s</B><BR>
The work of Maisie Fawcett continued in Victoria and resulted in
significant reductions in stocking rates in the high country of Victoria
during the 1950s and 1960s. Alec Costin, then a young Sydney University
graduate, also became involved in the conservation of the Alps through
summer work with Maisie Fawcett. Influenced by the botanist Dr Jim
Willis (Costin pers. comm.), Costin, through his work with the Soil
Conservation Authority of Victoria, played an important role in
introducing soil conservation principles throughout Victoria, especially
in the Victorian Alps. Later, as a Commonwealth Scientific and
Industrial Research Organisation scientist, Costin played a critical
role in achieving a science-based approach to the conservation of the
Alps.<P>
        On 19 April 1944 following Premier McKell's history-making
directive, the Kosciusko State Park Act was passed setting aside the
528,646 hectare Kosciusko State Park and establishing the Kosciusko
State Park Trust (the Trust). Of this area, 10% was to be established as
a primitive area and the State Park was to be managed to protect the
catchments, to provide for recreation and to provide for controlled
grazing (Worboys et al. 1991). It was the first very large protected
area established in Australia (Mosley 1992).<P>
        Myles Dunphy played a prominent role in attempting to establish
conservation parameters, although many of his fundamental conservation
management principles were not able to be followed at that time (Mosley
1992). Forester Byles was appointed as one of the original Park
trustees, and increasingly became a prime advocate for improved
management and conservation, often working quietly behind the scenes to
influence people (Gare pers. comm.).<P>
        This most important pioneering legislation set the scene for the
development of basic conservation management principles and practices.
Its potential was not fully realised for a number of years, however, and
not until significant influence was brought to bear by outsiders. This
influence came from the recently formed Snowy Mountains Hydro Electric
Authority (1949) which was concerned about the protection of the
catchments for water yield purposes and as a consequence exerted
pressure for the removal of grazing. Scientists working with the NSW
Soil Conservation Service had similar catchment protection objectives
and also exerted pressure. Grazing in many parts of the NSW Alps still
continued, although stocking rates were reduced. Importantly, however,
this pressure influenced the NSW Government not to renew any snow leases
above 4,500 feet in altitude after 1958.<P>
        The Snowy Mountains Hydro-Electric Authority (SMHEA) also had
many development objectives for the mountains of NSW and proposed a
scheme to dam and utilise the very highest headwaters of the Alps near
Mount Kosciusko. This included the construction of dams and aqueducts.<P>
        These threats from the SMHEA and threats from proposed ski
facilities in the summit area of Kosciusko brought a concerted response
from conservationists. The conservation battle to protect the very
highest peaks from modification became very intense before the
conservation protection of the area was achieved. Significant influence
was achieved during this debate by soil conservation scientist Dr Alec
Costin, prominent scientist Dr W.R. Browne, as well as by a concerted
lobby from the Australian Academy of Science (Worboys et al. 1995). <P>
        A change in the balance of power on the Kosciusko State Park
(KSP) Trust at about this time helped to realise a more proactive
conservation-based approach for the State Park. This led to a more
determined approach to implement the NSW State Government's new grazing
ban. It also appointed a professional manager in 1959 (Mr Neville Gare)
and achieved a strict conservation approach for the Summit Area of
Kosciusko through the proclamation of a Primitive Area in 1963 as
permitted by the Kosciusko State Park Act (Mosley 1992). <P>
        Whilst it was still beset by many problems, Kosciusko State Park
under the leadership of the Trust and Superintendent Gare began to
emerge as a pioneer in Australian protected area management. During the
period 1959–1965 Gare was influenced by his mentors, Byles (Mosley 1992)
and Costin, as well as his contacts with the USA and New Zealand
National Park systems. Attendance by the newly appointed Trust Deputy
Chairman at the Second World Conference on National Parks in Seattle,
USA, in 1962 brought support to Gare for concepts such as uniformed
rangers, information centres, park signs and interpretative programmes. <P>
        The first Master Plan for the State Park was completed in 1966
and many basic conservation principles including a zoning scheme for the
park were manifest in that document. International Park management
principles and practices and conservation philosophies were actively
sought by Gare and the Trust and, where appropriate, were introduced at
Kosciusko. A visiting Fulbright scholar, Mr Grenwill Lloyd, was an
advocate of a zoning scheme concept at Kosciusko, and may have
influenced its development (Costin pers. comm.). The resource management
committee of the Trust also set new standards for the management of
Kosciusko State Park especially through the Master Plan (Gare pers.
comm.).<P>
        A change in Government in 1965 brought a new force to the Trust.
As the Minister for Lands and Chairman of the Trust, the Hon. Mr Tom
Lewis was an energetic and visionary politician who strove for the
continued and improved conservation management of Kosciusko State Park
(Gare pers. comm.).<P>
        The Kosciusko State Park management model was significantly
influenced by Minister Lewis and in turn, its success influenced him.
His 1967 NSW legislation (National Parks and Wildlife Act) achieved his
long-held vision to establish a state- wide professional National Parks
organisation for NSW to administer the state's multiple national parks
and nature reserves (Gare pers. comm.). Soon after the introduction of
the new legislation in October 1967, the newly formed National Parks and
Wildlife Service (NPWS) took over the management of Kosciusko National
Park. The Trust was dissolved and the Kosciusko National Park Advisory
Committee was formed. The Alps and the Kosciusko State Park management
model had played a key role in the creation of the NSW NPWS.<P>
        Conservationists in Victoria pursued the concept of a Victorian
Alpine National Park in 1949, in 1969 and again in 1975 but were
unsuccessful (Johnson 1974). A continued and sustained lobby for the
establishment of a Victorian Alpine National Park however, became a
powerful political force within Victoria.<P>

<B>The Alps during the 1970s and 1980s</B><BR>
The Alps protected areas increased in size in the early 1970s, with the
addition in 1974 of the Byadbo lands to the Kosciusko National Park, and
the creation of the Gudgenby Nature Reserve in the Australian Capital
Territory (ACT) in 1979.<P>
        In Victoria, there was considerable agitation for a Victorian
Alpine National Park and the newly formed Land Conservation Council
recommended major new protected areas in the Victorian Alps (Bogong
National Park, 79,000 ha; Wonnangatta-Moroka National Park, 104,000 ha;
Cobberas-Tingaringy National Park, 17,000 ha; the Avon Wilderness,
29,500 ha) (Land Conservation Council 1979). After many years of
agitation, this was an important step forward but it fell short of
achieving the grand vision for a large Victorian Alps protected area
along the length of the Great Dividing Range connecting with Kosciusko
National Park.<P>
        The 1967 establishment of the NSW NPWS and subsequent expansion
of the state's national park system meant that experienced national park
professionals were needed to manage these new areas. Many Kosciusko-
trained personnel, being among the most experienced protected area
managers in the state, were transferred to manage these reserves as well
as to other professional posts within the organisation. Kosciusko
National Park became an active training park for many of the new ranger
staff appointed to the NPWS.<P>
        This period also witnessed the indirect influence of the
Australian Alps management both nationally and internationally.
Superintendent Gare was seconded to assist the Papua New Guinea
Government to establish its national parks and reserve system. Later, he
returned to Australia to help establish the Australian National Parks
and Wildlife Service (ANPWS) now the Australian Nature Conservation
Agency (ANCA).<P>
        During the late 1970s and early 1980s, the NSW national park and
reserve system was expanded further and Kosciusko National Park again
trained and supplied experienced management professionals to the new
areas of responsibility. Other Kosciusko staff were promoted to heritage
conservation positions in other organisations such as the Sydney Water
Board, NSW State Premier's Department and ANCA.<P>
        During the early 1980s an important development in the training
and establishment of minimum standards for rangers occurred. Personnel
from Kosciusko National Park and the Riverina College of Advanced
Education together initiated the concept of a formal qualification
(Associate Diploma) for rangers through correspondence course work and
regular live-in training camps. This pioneering qualification for
rangers has subsequently become adopted by many agencies throughout
Australia as the training standard for Australia's rangers.<P>
        In the ACT the establishment of Namadgi National Park in 1984
together with an addition in 1991 extended the areas protected in the
Alps. The unique leasehold land tenure system operating since the
inception of the ACT greatly assisted the establishment of Namadgi
National Park, because it provided strong controls over the use of the
land, especially subdivision and clearing.<P>
        In the Cotter Valley, the need to protect a water supply for the
National Capital led to strict controls over public access early this
century. This same demand for potable water will continue to provide a
basis for the security of the Namadgi (Hayes pers. comm.).<P>
        Growth in the NSW ski industry created new demands for expansion
of ski resorts at Kosciusko and a far more sophisticated approach to the
management of the ski fields by the NPWS. Pressure from large numbers of
vehicle-based summer visitors on the Summit area of Kosciusko created
major impacts on the sensitive alpine vegetation and a management
strategy to protect the Summit area was developed in 1979 (Worboys et
al. 1995).<P>
        In 1982 following an extensive public consultation period, the
new Kosciusko National Park Plan of Management was approved and achieved
many conservation gains including the exclusion of vehicles from the
Summit area, the prohibition of grazing, and the transfer of fire
management responsibilities from an external organisation to the NPWS.<P>
        The Alps protected areas set a high standard within Australia
for the development of professional national park plans of management.
The 1982 Plan of Management for Kosciusko National Park, the 1986 Plan
of Management for Namadgi, and plans for the Victorian Alpine National
Parks were all developed to a high professional standard.<P>
        In the late 1980s, the most significant conservation achievement
for the Alps since 1944 occurred. On 2 December 1989, after a 49 year
conservation battle, the Victorian Alpine National Park was proclaimed.
This achievement followed a period of intense political manoeuvring,
compromising, and political campaigning. The mountain cattlemen in
particular held major demonstrations in Melbourne and captured the
political debate for a considerable period. Even on proclamation day at
Snowy Plain in the heart of the Victorian Alpine National Park the
mountain cattlemen staged a horseback demonstration. <P>
        The need for cooperative planning, fire management and
conservation work in the border areas of the Alps National Parks formed
the catalyst for the development of the Australian Alps Memorandum of
Understanding (MOU) signed in July 1986 by the State and Federal
Ministers responsible for the Alps and their management. The MOU, a non
legally-binding cooperative agreement, established a number of
conservation objectives to be implemented through mutually agreed and
planned cooperative work programmes across state borders. An enhanced
conservation outcome based on ecosystem management for the Alps was now
possible.<P>

<B>The Alps in the 1990s</B><BR>
During the 1990s, the implementation of the Alps MOU was further refined
and strengthened. This included the development of a three-year
strategic planning cycle, a formal budget with contributions from State
and Federal Governments and the appointment of a permanent coordinator
to manage the annual work programmes and the three-year strategic plan.
The success of the Alps MOU has provided a model for the establishment
of additional transboundary cooperative programmes within Australia.
Recent programmes such as at Jervis Bay, between the NSW NPWS and ANCA,
and a proposal for a transboundary coastal wilderness management
agreement between the NSW NPWS and Victorian Department of Conservation
and Natural Resources, are based on this model. <P>
        The Australian Alps MOU has also received considerable interest
internationally, and IUCN (Thorsell 1990) has recognised the Australian
Alps National Parks as a leader in the field of transboundary
cooperative protected area management. As a result of this interest, the
Australian Alps were selected as the venue for the first transboundary
mountain protected area travelling workshop. The workshop was convened
by IUCN, the Australian Alps Liaison Committee and ANCA and was
conducted during November 1995. It brought pairs of transboundary
mountain protected area managers from all over the world to witness
cooperative management in action.<P>

<B>Conclusion</B><BR>
Land use within the Australian Alps over 70 years witnessed a
transformation from exploitative to conservation-based land use
practices. This was achieved through the sustained actions of
individuals and organisations with a strong commitment to the
conservation and protection of the catchment and heritage values of the
Alps. Government legislation established soil conservation authorities
in two states, the Kosciusko State Park and the NSW National Parks and
Wildlife Service. Management of the protected areas established in the
Alps evolved to deal with the conservation and protection issues at hand
and management professionals gained considerable experience and skills
in the process. The Australian Alps National Parks played a central role
in the establishment of the protected areas concept and their management
in Australia well beyond the Alps region. Conservation principles and
practices were established for the Alps parks; minimum acceptable
standards of management were determined and pioneering and innovative
management approaches were developed particularly in the area of
protected area management planning.<P>
        The establishment of the Australian Alps National Parks and the
Australian Alps MOU represents one of the outstanding success stories
for conservation management in Australia. Focusing on ecological issues,
species conservation and catchment protection in a manner that largely
transcends political imperatives and administrative boundaries, the MOU
achieved a common vision and conservation philosophy for the Alps. This
initiative continues to be a model for transboundary management both
within Australia and internationally.<P>

<B>Sacred mountains: implications for protected area management</B><P>

EDWIN BERNBAUM<P>

<B>Sacred mountains highlight the key role that culture plays in
influencing how people view and treat the environment. For long-term
success policies of conservation and sustainable use need to take such
cultural factors into account, enlisting the aid of traditional beliefs
and practices. Otherwise they will fail to gain the support of
indigenous communities and other interested parties. In addition, sacred
mountains reveal what in nature different societies revere and feel
motivated to protect.<P>
        People experience the sacred nature of mountains through the
views they have of them, such as the mountain as centre of the universe
or place of renewal. This paper examines some of the most important and
widely distributed of these views or themes and draws out their
implications for formulating policies and measures for the conservation
of mountain cultures and environments. The conclusion suggests that we
broaden notions of sustainability to spiritual and cultural, as well as
economic and ecological, aspects of the environment. <P></B>

SACRED MOUNTAINS highlight the key role that culture plays in
influencing how people view and treat the environment. As the highest
and most 
impressive features of the landscape, mountains tend to reflect the
highest and most central values and beliefs of different societies –
values and beliefs that underlie the ways people see the world and their
place in it. These values and beliefs determine to a great extent which
natural resources people seek to exploit and which features of the land
they strive to preserve. For any assurance of long-term success,
policies directed toward environmental preservation and sustainable use
need to take such cultural factors into account; otherwise they will not
win the support of communities and individuals who most directly impact
the areas under consideration.<P>
        In general, whatever people perceive as sacred possesses for
them ultimate reality and value. As a manifestation of ultimate reality,
however that may be conceived, it acquires a special status that puts it
beyond the reach of mundane manipulation. This attitude is expressed
with particular force in Maori ideas of tapu or sacred mountains. They
are places forbidden to ordinary people, off-limits to profane uses. In
addition, the sacred is regarded as having a supreme value that makes it
worth protecting at all costs – a value which, in fact, transcends all
cost. If cultivated and taken seriously, such attitudes can function as
powerful forces helping to preserve the integrity of natural
environments.<P> 
        Of all the different kinds of natural sacred sites, mountains
are the ones that form the most diverse and complete environments and
ecosystems. They include shrub lands, forests, meadows, deserts,
tundras, glaciers, rivers, lakes. Within these diverse environments,
mountains hold a great diversity of flora and fauna, ranging from
tropical to arctic. They function, in fact, as microcosms of the
environment as a whole. Sacred mountains can, therefore, give us some of
the best pictures of what in nature people of different cultures revere
and feel deeply motivated to protect.<P> 
        Although in many traditions the sacred itself is considered
ultimately indefinable, it is not amorphous. People experience the
sacred nature of mountains, in particular, through the views they have
of them, such as the mountain as centre of the universe or source of
life. The various expressions of these views or themes differentiate the
experience of the sacred and provide articulation for doing research and
formulating policy for different cultures and mountain regions.<P>
        To enlist local support for research and policy implementation,
it is important to develop some empathetic understanding of how this
works. Each view or theme brings together various ideas and images to
evoke the experience of a deeper reality hidden in a mountain perceived
as sacred. The process works a little like the fusion of two photographs
in a stereoscopic viewer to trigger a vivid perception of the third
dimension represented in each two-dimensional photograph. Something
similar happens to many of us when, at particular moments, certain
impressions click together in our minds, and the mountain we are
climbing or seeing seems to come alive with a peculiar depth and
intensity that we have difficulty defining.<P>

<B>Major themes</B><BR>
Using specific examples, we will examine some of the most important and
widely distributed themes associated with mountains. These themes have
been selected for their potential to suggest general guidelines for
doing research and formulating policy for protected areas. Others could,
and should, be chosen for further exploration. Many of the themes
overlap and imply each other, suggesting that we not treat them as
distinct, isolated views of mountains to be analysed apart from each
other.<P>
        Many sacred mountains are first and foremost places of power.
This power is often regarded as dangerous, a source of fear to be
treated with the greatest care and respect. In the past Maori warriors
crossing the plateau beneath Mount Tongariro would avert their eyes from
its summit for fear of provoking a blinding snowstorm (Yoon 1986). Maori
conceptions of the mana of tapu mountains such as Tongariro emphasise
the sheer power of a sacred mountain that makes it forbidden to ordinary
humans. <P>
        The power of mountains can assume various forms. The five yüeh
or principal sacred mountains of China, Tai Shan in particular,
enshrined the political authority of the emperor to rule over the four
quarters of his empire, supported by the mandate of Heaven (Chavannes
1910). The molten lava of Kilauea in Hawai'i embodies for many Hawaiians
the fiery destructive and creative energy of the volcano goddess Pele.
As this example shows, the power of a sacred mountain can be both
natural and supernatural. Many people attribute this power to deities
who reside on mountains or are identified with the peaks themselves, as
Pele is with Kilauea.<P>
        Another widespread theme, especially in areas influenced by
Hinduism and Buddhism, is that of the mountain as centre. A number of
mountains that embody this theme, such as Mount Kailas in Tibet and
Gunung Agung in Bali, are patterned on the mythical Mount Meru or
Sumeru, which stands as a cosmic axis around which the universe is
organised in Hindu and Buddhist cosmology. As a piece of Meru
transported there by the gods, Gunung Agung provides the Balinese with
their sense of geographical and psychological orientation – everything
on the island exists and finds its place in relation to the volcano
(Covarrubias 1946).<P>
        A number of mountains in East Asia, Japan in particular, are
viewed as centres of mandalas, circular spaces and arrangements of
deities used in Buddhist meditation. Some, such as Mounts Koya and
Omine, are treated as mandalas themselves, their peaks, trees, and other
natural features regarded as parts of a sacred circle representing the
divine space of a visualised deity with whom a meditator identifies
himself or herself (Bernbaum 1990). In a provocative article Allan
Grapard (1982) argues that in the period leading up to World War II such
mandalas spread out from sacred mountains to engulf the surrounding
landscape and transformed the entire country of Japan into a divine
nation in the eyes of its people.<P>
        Cultures tend to look up to mountains as sources of blessings –
most notably, water, fertility, life and healing. Mountains such as
Ausangate in Perú, Tlaloc in Mexico and the San Francisco Peaks in
Arizona are revered as abodes of weather deities, places of springs, and
reservoirs of waters on which societies depend for their well-being and
existence (Reinhard 1985). In times of drought modernised Kikuyu of
Kenya still fall back on pre-Christian traditions and face Mount Kenya
to ask Ngai or God for rain. Today great numbers of elderly women climb
Tai Shan to make offerings to have grandchildren if their daughters or
daughter-in-laws have been infertile (Bernbaum 1990).<P>
        Female shamans in Japan and Korea routinely climb sacred
mountains to charge themselves with healing powers and conduct rituals
for their patients (Blacker 1975; Kendall 1985). The leading spiritual
doctor of the Wintun tribe in northern California feels that she gets
her power to heal from Mount Shasta, in particular from a sacred spring
in a pristine meadow threatened by the proposed development of a ski
area. Traditional singers or medicine men go to the four sacred
mountains of the Navajo in the south-western United States to obtain
medicinal herbs and pebbles; they also invoke these mountains in rituals
and sand paintings intended to restore a sick person to health and
harmony (Bernbaum 1990).<P>
        Another major theme is that of mountains as divine ancestors and
places of the dead, often involved in origin myths. Mount Koya has one
of the most impressive graveyards in Japan. East Africans traditionally
buried their dead facing sacred peaks such as Kilimanjaro and Mount
Kenya. Most of the major peaks in New Zealand, including Aoraki or Mount
Cook, are revered as ancestors of the Maori who came to the North and
South Islands in migration canoes (Orbell 1985). According to the origin
myth of the Korean people, they are descended from the union of a sky
god and a bear woman on the sacred mountain of Paekdu (Henthorn 1971).<P>
        As divine ancestors and places of origin, a number of mountains
provide different societies with their sense of communal identity. One
of the most dramatic examples of a sacred mountain holding a people
together is Mount Kaata in the Bolivian Andes. Joseph Bastien (1978) has
shown how the metaphor of Kaata as a human body unites the various
communities who live on its slopes into an organic unit that has been
able to resist all efforts to break it apart into smaller administrative
subdivisions. At intertribal gatherings Maori ritually identify
themselves by first stating their tribal mountain, followed by their
river, or lake, and then their chief (Yoon 1986).<P>
        The final theme to consider is that of the mountain as place of
spiritual revelation and transformation. Mount Sinai occupies a position
of particular prominence in the Bible as the awe-inspiring site where
God reveals the Torah, the basic teaching of Judaism, and the Ten
Commandments, the basis of law and ethics in Western civilisation.
Buddhist pilgrims to Wutai Shan in China expect to see manifestations of
Manjushri, the Bodhisattva of Wisdom, who may appear to them in the form
of a dragon, a prince seated on a lion, or as a ball of fire (Birnbaum
1986).<P>
        In China and Japan mountains are regarded as such ideal places
for meditation and spiritual transformation that the Chinese expression
for embarking on the practice of religion means literally 'to enter the
mountains' (Demiéville 1965). Hua Shan, the most spectacular of the five
principal sacred peaks of China, was a favourite haunt of Taoist hermits
intent on transforming themselves into immortals. North American Plains
Indians of different tribes seek out high places for vision quests that
give them spiritual power and determine the course of their lives.<P>
        Many people today, both traditional and modern, seek out
mountains as places of spiritual renewal and transformation. Huang Shan,
Mount Fuji and the Diamond Mountains continue to inspire artists and
poets in China, Japan, and Korea. Europeans became interested in the
Alps for scientific and mountaineering reasons when philosophers and
poets such as Rousseau, Goethe and Shelley began to extol their
spiritually uplifting qualities (Bernbaum 1990). In the United States
John Muir, a major figure in the genesis of the modern-day environmental
movement, founded the Sierra Club primarily to preserve the Sierra
Nevada as a wilderness area where people could go for spiritual renewal.
Such motivations continue to inspire and energise the environmental
movement today. They also draw many visitors to parks and protected
areas in mountain regions. <P>

<B>Policy implications</B><BR>
These themes have a variety of implications for policy regarding
environmental and cultural preservation and sustainable use. In order to
develop general guidelines for policies in protected areas, we need to
examine their specific meanings in particular contexts. The same theme
can have different implications for different mountains in different
cultures.<P>
        It is also important to note that many cultures draw vitality
and cohesion from their relationship to mountains and other sacred
features of the landscape. Destroying what makes such a site sacred may
undermine a culture, resulting in adverse social, economic and
environmental impacts as the society falls apart and traditional
controls are lost.<P>
        This last point brings out an important role for managers of
protected areas. Under the impacts of modernisation, the influx of
outside forces, and population growth, many traditional beliefs and
practices that have been extremely effective in preserving the
environment are now being overwhelmed. Managers need to work with local
communities to support and revitalise these controls and adapt them to
new circumstances. An awareness of the themes we have looked at and
their implications can help to guide this process.<P>  
      The perceived power of a mountain frequently sustains a
community that holds it sacred. If development or conservation measures
appear to weaken that power, they may have negative consequences. In the
case of a mountain revered as a place of danger, a policy designed to
avoid such consequences might intentionally make access to its higher
slopes difficult in order to reinforce the mountain's mystique,
especially if it is not traditionally climbed. Managers might also want
to avoid planting grass and trees and to leave untouched rocky areas and
other features that are naturally devoid of wildlife and vegetation.<P>
        The power of many mountains comes from the perceived presence of
deities, often regarded as protectors of local communities. The
iconography and mythology of these mountain deities can provide
important clues for formulating policy. For example, if a deity appears
in association with certain domestic animals, these will probably be the
kind of livestock that should be allowed to graze on that deity's sacred
mountain. Not taking such considerations into account can alienate the
local community and cause unnecessary problems.<P>
        Sherpas in the Sagarmatha National Park of Nepal believe that
goats, yaks, and sheep are under the special protection of Khumbu Yul
Lha, the protector deity of the Khumbu region. They were outraged when
the park in 1983 banned the grazing of goats on the slopes of the god's
sacred mountain, Khumbila. Some of them feared that the action would
offend the deity and bring misfortune on their herds of yaks, on which
they depend for much of their livelihood (Stevens 1993). Greater
sensitivity on the part of park managers, perhaps allowing goats to
graze on certain parts of the mountain where they would do the least
damage, would have avoided creating suspicion and resentments that made
other park policies harder to implement. <P>
        Many mountain deities appear with particular wild animals, often
as their protectors: reinforcing this association in people's minds can
help to protect those animals. Vicunas are considered the domestic
livestock of apus or mountain deities of the Peruvian Andes. National
laws protecting these animals have helped to reinforce traditional
prohibitions on hunting them and other wildlife, based on fears of
offending their divine protectors (Bernbaum 1990).<P>
        Similar relationships may hold for plants as well as animals.
Holy Hills set aside by the Dai people of south-west China have
preserved valuable islands of biodiversity, largely through the belief
that all the plants and animals found on them are companions of the gods
that dwell there or else belong to their gardens. Traditional practices
that now need reinforcement in the face of modern pressures have until
recently prevented gathering, hunting, wood-chopping and cultivation on
these sacred hills, which occupy 1.5% to 2.5% of the local prefecture
(Pei 1993). <P>
        The perception of sacred mountains as centres may play an
important role in holding communities together. To keep such communities
from falling apart, policies may be needed to preserve, and even
reinforce, natural and man-made features that emphasise the symbolism of
a sacred mountain as a centre. These measures might include setting
aside a circle of undeveloped land around the peak or making sure that
nothing obscures views of it from important places, such as temples and
shrines.<P>
        Policy measures should build on motivations and practices people
already have for preserving mountains as sacred sources of water,
fertility, life and healing. For example, a community may be keeping a
mountain spring pure out of a belief that if they pollute it local
deities will inflict diseases on them. Sherpas avoid polluting springs
from fear that the lu or serpent deities residing in the water will
inflict leprosy on nearby residents. Rather than try to persuade them
that bacteria instead of gods or spirits cause illness, it would be more
respectful and effective to encourage them to hold both views
simultaneously, applying each where it is appropriate to the end of
safeguarding the water supply. This does not have to be contradictory:
traditional beliefs may lend support to arguments that spiritual
entities can act through bacteria as their material agents in the
physical world.<P>
        If a community views a mountain as a place of the dead, policies
should be formulated to encourage its members to treat it as they would
a cemetery containing the remains of their relatives. Just as cutting
down trees or overgrazing would be for some cultures a desecration of a
graveyard, so doing the same things on the mountain might offend the
spirits of ancestors on whom people depend for their well-being and
blessings. The presence of a kilometre and a half long cemetery on Mount
Koya in Japan has succeeded in preserving a magnificent forest of giant
cedars (Bernbaum 1990).<P>
        Protected area managers can work with local communities and
indigenous groups to preserve sacred mountains – along with their
environments – as symbols of communal and tribal identity. In the latter
part of the 19th century, Europeans in New Zealand were starting to buy
up parcels of land for sheep farms on Tongariro, the sacred mountain of
the Ngati Tuwharetoa. In order to keep the mountain whole and preserve
the power and integrity of the tribe, a European advisor counselled the
Paramount Chief, Horonuku Te Heuheu Tukino IV, to give Tongariro to the
Crown as a park for the benefit of everyone. This he did in 1887, and
Tongariro National Park became the first national park in New Zealand
and the fourth in the world (Lucas 1993).<P>
        The last theme to consider, that of mountains as places of
revelation and transformation, is the one most closely linked to issues
of tourism. Many people, ranging from pilgrims to tourists, go to
mountains seeking spiritual renewal and inspiration. Will their presence
in large numbers interfere with the practice of religious rituals and
meditation by indigenous practitioners, as well as the quality of their
own experience? On mountains where inspiration and renewal come from
quiet contemplation in a pristine environment the answer is yes. Either
visitors must be encouraged to walk quietly and leave little trace of
their passage, or they must be restricted as to where they can go. On
other mountains where inspiration and renewal come traditionally from
large numbers of people engaged in many different activities, such as
pilgrimage festivals, this may not be such a problem.<P>
        In some cases, rather than a pristine wilderness setting, a man-
made temple or some other human structure may enhance the spiritual
experience of the mountain and help to preserve its environment. In the
mountainous Khumbu region of Nepal near Mount Everest, sacred groves
around monasteries and temples have been better preserved than forests
protected by the Nepali government and the Sagarmatha National Park
(Stevens 1993). An effective policy for park administrators might be to
identify sacred sites in forest areas that need protecting and to
sponsor the construction of new shrines and the renovation of old ones
near those places, encouraging local religious leaders to declare the
surrounding forests sacred.<P>
        Many parks and wilderness areas in mountain regions have been
set aside for protection because of the cultural and spiritual values
placed on them by modern societies – values that often outweigh economic
and political considerations. In order to retain and cultivate this
important source of support, park managers need to adopt policies that
reinforce, rather than undermine, such values. For example, although it
may may not be as cost-effective in the short term, it may be preferable
for parks themselves to handle wilderness permits and make reservations
for campsites. Contracting such services out to ticket agencies may
alienate the public by appearing to commercialise the parks, reducing
them to theatres or amusement parks that no longer embody the natural
qualities of mountain environments that inspire a sense of renewal.
Visitors who deal directly with rangers will feel that that their money
is going for a good purpose and will have a greater sense of personal
involvement that will make them more inclined to support park systems
economically and politically. <P>

<B>Conclusions</B><BR>
For many people, both modern and traditional, the environment is not
just the natural environment. It includes cultural and spiritual aspects
that make it meaningful – a source of life in its deepest and broadest
sense. People who do rituals to draw water from a sacred mountain, for
example, do not view the water and mountain simply as physical parts of
the ecosystem needed to grow their crops. They see them as essential
components of a larger system of meaning, expressions of a deeper
reality that sustains them spiritually and culturally, as well as
physically.<P>
        A study of the role and significance of sacred mountains
suggests that we adopt a broader and deeper view of sustainable use.
Protected area managers and development administrators need to formulate
policies that take into account issues of cultural and spiritual, as
well as ecological and economic, sustainability. If trees are replanted,
clear-cut logging can be sustained from an economic point of view, but
the biodiversity of the forest will be lost. In a similar vein, measures
taken only to preserve the natural ecology without regard for what it
enshrines may kill the spirit of a place, destroying its value for the
people for whom it is important.<P>

<B>Legal brief<BR>
The Alpine Convention – a promise for the future?</B><P>

WOLFGANG E. BURHENNE<P>

<B>The Commission for the Protection of the Alpine Regions (CIPRA) was
created in 1952 upon the initiative of both governmental and non-
governmental representatives. In its first Programme of Action, the new
Commission stressed the necessity of negotiating and concluding a
convention conserving the alpine environment and natural resources.</B><P>

It was not, however, until 1989 that a Conference of Alpine States was
convened in Berchtesgaden, upon the initiative of the Minister of
Environment of the Federal Republic of Germany. After long discussions,
this conference decided to commence negotiations for a convention
covering the entire Alpine mountain range.<P>
        On 7 November 1991 the Alpine Convention was signed in Salzburg
by Austria, France, Germany, Italy, Lichtenstein, Switzerland, and the
European Community. Although Slovenia, as part of Yugoslavia, had taken
part in the negotiations, by the time the convention was ready for
signature that country was already in upheaval, and Slovenia signed the
Alpine Convention on 29 March 1993 as an independent state. In 1994 a
special protocol was concluded to allow for Monaco to become a Party.<P>
        The Convention entered into force on 6 March 1995, after
ratification by Austria, Liechtenstein and Germany. Since then France
has also ratified.<P>
        As is common in such instruments, the preamble sets out the
general purpose and goals of the Contracting Parties, recognising the
specific and multifaceted qualities of the natural environment as well
as the history and culture of the region as one of the largest natural
areas of its type in Europe. The text of the Convention describes the
territorial application of the treaty by reference to a map which is
contained in the annex. Each Contracting Party may, however, extend the
application of the Convention to other areas under its sovereignty by a
declaration addressed to the Republic of Austria as depository.
Likewise, such areas may be removed from the field of application of the
Convention by means of the same procedure.<P>
        The general obligations of the State Parties are determined by
Article 2 (1), which states the general principles governing the
Convention to be the principle of prevention, the polluter-pays
principle, the principle of cooperation, and the principle of the
preservation and protection of the Alps – taking into consideration the
interests of each Party, and the need to achieve the sustainable use of
resources. These principles are followed by a list of appropriate
measures to be taken in specific sectors, in order to attain the
aforementioned objectives (Article 2 (2)). Taken as a whole, the
enumerated sectors demonstrate the broad scope of the Convention. They
are:
<LI>       people and culture
<LI>        land use planning
<LI>       air quality
<LI>        soil protection
<LI>        water regimes
<LI>        protection of nature and landscape management
<LI>        mountain agriculture
<LI>        mountain forests
<LI>       tourism and leisure activities
<LI>       transport
<LI>       energy
<LI>       wastes<P>
        Articles 3 and 4 are concerned with the harmonisation and
development of research and monitoring activities as well as with
cooperation in the legal, scientific, economic, and technical fields.
Exchange of information and cooperation with international organisations
– governmental and non-governmental – as well as the provision of
information to the public on a regular basis on progress in those areas
are singled out by the text as appropriate means of action.<P> 
        The next block of articles are those concerning institutions.
The Conference of the Parties, i.e. the Alpine Conference, its meetings
and decision-making mechanisms, its functions and organs such as the
Standing Committee, are dealt with. Provision is also made for the
possibility of creating a permanent Secretariat.<P>
        The standard final clauses, including those on amendments to the
Convention or Protocols, ratification and accession, conclude the text.<P>
        The text of the Alpine Convention, therefore, clearly
demonstrates the classic elements of a so-called 'framework convention'
– that is, a treaty which is concerned with general principles as well
as obligations and which provides for the conclusion of special
Protocols which deal more thoroughly with specific subjects in greater
detail.<P>
        Because of its nature as a framework convention, the obligations
accepted by the State Parties remain very general. In accordance with
Article 2(3) these obligations are defined at the level of the
Protocols, which delineate measures to implement the terms of the
Convention. It was therefore essential that negotiation of the Protocols
began immediately: without them, the Convention would remain an empty
shell, without substance. This is the reason that CIPRA and the World
Conservation Union (IUCN) were constantly emphasising the necessity of
concluding the envisaged protocols to the Convention as rapidly as
possible.<P>
        Thus, work on that task began even before the Alpine Convention
entered into force, with parallel negotiations, with the result that
three Protocols were opened for signature at the same time on 20
December 1994: the Protocol for the implementation  of the Alpine
Convention in the field of town and country planning and sustainable
development; the Protocol for the implementation of the Alpine
Convention in the field of mountain agriculture; and the Protocol for
the implementation of the Alpine Convention in the field of nature
protection and landscape conservation. They have all been signed by
France, Germany, Italy, Monaco, Slovenia and the European Union. The
Protocol on town and country planning and sustainable development has
also been signed by Liechtenstein. None, however, has yet been signed by
Switzerland or Austria. In the former case, the difficulty lies with the
positions taken by the Swiss Cantons which would be affected: they claim
that the imposition of some of the obligations would have socio-economic
consequences which require increased subsidies. The case of Austria is
more circumscribed: the federal Government is blocked from taking any
action by the position of the Länder which oppose the direction that the
negotiations of the Protocol on transport is taking. The Länder, through
their Prime Ministers' Conference, want any further construction of
transalpine highways to be prohibited. The negotiators are at present
seeking a workable compromise on that point.<P>
        In contrast, the negotiations on the Protocol on mountain
forests are almost concluded. The negotiations on the soil preservation
Protocol have run into some difficulties, in particular with regard to
its field of application and definition of soil. Work on the Protocol on
energy is just beginning. That on tourism and leisure activities is
meeting with difficulties with regard to the provisions regarding the
production of artificial snow in areas where there are ski facilities. A
special meeting will take place in order to help find the consensus
which would be necessary in order that this Protocol be opened for
signature by the Ministers attending the next Alpine conference at the
end of February 19961.<P>
        In addition to the above efforts, an ambitious programme for
Alpine monitoring is already well under way.<P>
        Finally, during the last session of the Standing Committee to
the Convention, which was held in January of this year, the
representatives have come to an agreement concerning the rules of
procedure for the Alpine Conference and those of the Standing Committee.
The rules of procedure will provide inter alia for the participation of
international NGOs at the Conference and at meetings of the Standing
Committee.<P>
        Within the framework of this short overview of the status of the
Convention and the ongoing negotiations of Protocols it has not been
possible to analyse the obligations already imposed or those
contemplated in any detail. It is however important to stress that the
over-riding rule is that of consensus, and that as a consequence it must
be understood that the provisions which have been adopted are not all as
stringent as CIPRA or IUCN would have wished.<P>
        However, the result as a whole shows progress – a progress which
may become a really significant tool for continuing work on the
conservation of the Alps. This can only become a reality, however, if
the Contracting Parties take the necessary steps to bring the Protocols
to the Convention into force as soon as possible – and then firmly
implement the measures they require.<P>
        Law can but provide the means to the application of political
will!<P>

1 Publisher's note: This article was prepared by Dr Burhenne in January
1996, but is only now being published due to unforeseen delays in
producing this issue of PARKS. Dr Burhenne informs us that there have
been further developments within the Alpine Convention since January,
the most important being that legally binding Protocols on tourism and
on mountain forests have been signed. There is still no agreement on a
Protocol for transport.<P>

<B>Identifying the world's most outstanding mountains</B><P>

JIM THORSELL<P>

<B>I have in my mountain reference library a number of books that profess
to describe which are the world's most outstanding mountains. Most are
written by the legions of mountain travellers and climbers. All are
liberally dosed with the awe-inspiring photographs that mountains lend
themselves to.<P></B>

But there is another approach to defining which are the world's most
outstanding mountains – the World Heritage Convention. In this case,
government members of this international legal conservation instrument
make formal applications to inscribe what they feel are their 'best'
natural and cultural heritage sites. The world heritage point of
departure when it comes to mountains is not only their attraction to
alpinists but their overall value to humanity for science and
conservation.<P>
        Through the mechanism of the World Heritage Convention, five
individual mountains and 31 mountain ranges have made it through the
rigorous IUCN selection procedure and been inscribed on the prestigious
list of World Heritage sites (see list below). The process is not over,
however, as there are many gaps left. In Asia, for example, there is no
natural World Heritage site in the Karakorum or the mountains of central
Asia outside the Himalayas. Work is progressing on a nomination of the
new Central Karakorum National Park and for one of the nature reserves
in the Altai. Kailas as one of the world's acknowledged sacred peaks has
also been suggested for potential cultural landscape nomination. The
Chinese portion of Mount Everest is an obvious missing piece out of
Nepal's Sagarmatha World Heritage site. The spectacular volcanoes in
Kamchatka are being assessed by IUCN in 1996 and several more in Russia
are soon to be nominated (surely something in the Caucasus would
qualify).<P>
        Elsewhere in south-east Asia Kinabalu in Malaysia and Lorentz in
Indonesia stand out as obvious potential candidates. Both are well known
for their scientific values and are protected as National Parks.<P>
        In Africa, Mount Kenya has been proposed as a potential World
Heritage site at a recent meeting of the African Mountain Association.
South Africa is said to be considering one of the mountain parks in the
Drakensburgs as well as several of the fynbos reserves in the Cape
mountains.<P>
        In the European Alps, nature has been subject to millennia of
human intervention and there has been difficulty in defining what could
be appropriate as a natural site. Northern Scandinavia is addressing
this issue by nominating their northern mountains as a cultural
landscape to take into account the Sami peoples interaction in that
setting. France and Spain have joined forces to nominate a transfrontier
park in the Pyrenees for review in 1996.<P>
        In Norway, Iceland and Greenland other mountains are being
considered for nomination including the huge NE Greenland National Park
and the national park on Spitzbergen.<P>
        In North America, the western Cordillera is already quite well
represented (some would say over-represented) in the current system of
World Heritage sites. Nevertheless the Brooks Range/British Mountains on
the border of Alaska and the Yukon would merit attention as would the
Torngats in Labrador. The international significance of the mountains of
the arctic islands in northern Canada have not yet been assessed.<P>
        In Latin America, Chile is considering a nomination for the
large temperate wilderness centred around the Bernardo O'Higgins/Torres
de Paine complex. At the northern end of the Andes, the Santa Marta area
of Colombia may soon also be proposed for the List for mixed cultural
and natural reasons.<P>
        In conclusion, the above 'shopping list' summarises initiatives
now under way to nominate further Mountain World Heritage sites. As IUCN
plays a quasi-judicial role in evaluating new nominations, we cannot
make any pre-judgments but it would be fair to say that most of the
above mentioned sites would have a reasonable chance of inscription on
the World Heritage list. It is also recognised that State Parties to the
Convention (now numbering 145 countries) are the only ones that can
submit nominations. But with eight World Heritage nominations in
mountains having been submitted for 1996, the process of identifying the
world's most outstanding mountains has advanced further than that of any
other biome.<P>
