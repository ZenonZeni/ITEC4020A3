<H1>SeaSpace Announces Shipboard Real-time Weather System</H1>

<H3>New Satellite System Brings High-Resolution Digital Weather and Ocean Information to Personal and Commercial Mariners Worldwide</H3>

<H3>26 October 1995</H3>


<P>
SeaSpace Corporation, the premier developer of weather satellite ground stations, has announced a new family of <A HREF="/ypss.html">Personal Weather Systems (PWS)</A> for the maritime market.  The PWS fulfills SeaSpace's vision of delivering high-resolution digital data to both the professional maritime market and the pleasure yachting community.  At-sea use of high-resolution satellite digital data has previously been limited to researchers and government users.
</P>

<P>
The PWS joins SeaSpace's extensive product line of real-time weather satellite stations.  Primary markets for the PWS include the international super yacht and commercial fishing industries.  For the first time, users aboard these vessels can receive and make use of high-resolution weather information.  The digital data received directly from weather satellites is identical to that used by professional weather forecasters all over the world.  
</P>

<P>
According to SeaSpace's chief technical officer, Dr. Robert L. Bernstein, SeaSpace can now deliver professional-quality weather and ocean information to the non-professional, in a simple, easy-to-use turnkey system.  The SeaSpace <A HREF="/ypss.html">Personal Weather System</A> delivers real-time weather information directly to the yacht or vessel -- anytime, anywhere. 
</P>

<P>
The PWS is derived from SeaSpaces proven maritime TeraScan &reg; systems installed on an array of ice breakers and research vessels worldwide.  
</P>

<P>
The PWS is a self-contained weather data acquisition, processing and display system that includes a 0.46 meter tracking antenna, a digital data receiver and a powerful desktop computer.  The PWS acquires high-resolution (HRPT) data from the NOAA TIROS polar orbiting weather satellites and WEFAX transmissions directly from geostationary satellites.  All data is automatically received and processed, creating weather and ocean imaging products in real time.  The images provide information by which to make immediate operational decisions and plan the vessels future movements.
</P>

<P>
Included with the PWS is SeaSpace's leading software package, TeraScan &reg;, a comprehensive package that provides quick access to all images and system products.  The PWS implementation of TeraScan &reg; includes an easy-to-use graphical user interface requiring only simple point-and-click operation of the computer mouse.
</P>

<P>
All images can be manipulated, including zooming an image to better see details, navigating for accurate information at every latitude and longitude point, and animating images taken at different times to observe changes in current weather patterns.
</P>

<P>
The PWS will begin shipping in the first quarter 1996.
