ABSTRACT The impact of ventilation on energy use can be considerable.
Total building energy use is variously estimated to account for
30% of all energy consumed inInternational Energy Agency countries.
Of this, as much as 50% can be associated with ventilation and
air infiltration. As living standards throughout the world improve,
it may be expected that building occupants will demand ever increasing
standards of comfort. This will inevitably result in increased
demand on building energy use and further heighten concerns over
global pollution.Much can be achieved to reduce energy demand
by improvingenergy efficiency. However, as the thermal performance
of buildings improves, ventilation will become the dominant source
of building energy loss. Unfortunately, reducing ventilation as
a means to minimise energy demand, hasbecome inextricably linked
to problems associated with unhealthy buildings. Ventilation is
thus an essential parameter in both energy and indoor air quality
control. The purpose of this report is to assess future ventilation
research and development needs. An objective has been toidentify
the prime objectives and tasks needed to secure energy efficient
ventilation without detriment to indoor air quality.

ABSTRACT A fundamental objective of this report is to investigate
the techniques used in the design and research fields for the
evaluation of thermal and air flow simulations. The scope is restricted
to the whole building rather than flow and heat transfer within
individual structural elements (e.g. cavity walls). Considerable
developments are taking place in the field of air flow and thermal
simulation. Rather than present an in-depth study of these developments,
this report concentrates on the rather more general aspects of
the combined simulation.

ABSTRACT The infiltration data set covers December 1990 to October

Faciligy (AHHRF) with a total of 6063 hours of data. The facility
is made up of six permanent testhouses, five of which are built
to residential wood frame construction standards with a sixth
house of masonry construction. The six unoccupied test houses
have been continuously monitored since 1980 for building envelope
energy losses and ventilation rates.

ABSTRACT The aim of this study is to examine common ventilation
and air conditioning systems and strategies for both domestic
and commercial buildings in the member countries of the AIVC.
To help identify common systems, a literature search was conducted
and the system descriptions of two professional institutions and
one commercial supplier were examined. This led to the establishment
of a common classification of ventilation and air conditioning
systems.

review summarises available airtightness and minimum ventilation

are expressed some analysis has also been included. The data contained

ABSTRACT The Air Infiltration and Ventilation Centre's Numerical
Database has been developed in response to a need to establish
a core of numerical data suitable for design purposes and model
validation. It has also been developed to provide a focus for
data derived from related International Energy Agency projects.
Source information is contained within a computerised database
from which direct searching for specific material is possible.
The purpose of this report is to present an ansalysis of key database
material which may be used for design purposes.Data have been
derived from as wide a range of sources as possible. Many organisations
have contributed to the data presented. By combining information
from these many sorces, it has been possible to consider a far
wider range of operating conditions than would be possible by
using the results from a single set of measurements. This report
and analysis is presented in three sections: component leakage
data; whole building leakage data; wind pressure evaluation.

ABSTRACT Discusses the issues which influence the performance
of heat recovery devices within typical building applications.
It is intended to cover the three main types if devices installed
in ventilation systems in residential and commercial buildings,
which are run-around coils, plate heat exchangers and thermal
wheels (rotary regenerators). Other systems such as heat pipes
are also described briefly. The successful implementation of air
to air heat recovery depends on factors such as careful equipment
selection, proper integration of equipment into the ventilation
system, good commissioning, proper maintenance and operation,
and building characteristics, such as airtightness. One section
gives information to assist the designer and building operator
to understand some of the factors that influence the performance
of heat recovery systems, highlighting some of the key points
that have emerged from the analysis of existing information, detailed
simulation work and site measurements.

ABSTRACT The objectives of this work are: first to determine the
theoretical energy requirements per constant mien unit of outdoor
air used for ventilation for a number of different climates and
locations in North America and Europe; and secondly to determine
the variation of this annual ventilation heating and cooling energy
requirements due to the set points for temperature and humidity.
The energy impact and/or trade-offs involved between bringing
in outdoor air for indoor air pollution reduction and the energy
required to condition this sir are investigated in this report.
Long-term hourly weather data from several European and American
locations were analysed to determine the average conditions of
air over the period of record of the data. These data were then
analysed to determine the psychometric process theoretical heating,
cooling and moisture removal energy requirements for a constant
mass of airflow per hour (MJ.h/kg). Summary weather data are also
provided if it is desired to determine the additional effects
of equipment and design. It was found that a significant amount
of energy is required to condition air which is used for ventilation.
The annual energy required per kg/hr of airflow varies from 22.1
MJ.h/kg for Los Angeles to 102.5 MJ.h/kg for Omaha. In Europe
the range was from 45.6 MJ.h/kg for Nice to 101.1 MJ.h/kg for
Saint-Hubert. In Europe most of the energy was used to heat the
air to the desired set point. In American there were significant
amounts of both heating and cooling required. Much of the variation
was due to the amount of moisture in the air which had to be removed
in air conditioning. In situation where air conditioning is used,
a significant amount of this energy is used in dehumidifying the
air. For example, in Miami 86% of the energy is used for moisture
removal. It was found that the energy used was highly sensitive
to the cooling and relative humidity set points.
