<body>

<b>SUMMARY:</b>The Department of Energy announces the availability of the
Implementation
Plan for the Environmental Impact Statement for a proposed Multi-Purpose Canister System for
Management of Civilian and Naval Spent Nuclear Fuel.  The purpose of the Implementation Plan
is to report the results of the public scoping and public participation processes and to serve as a
plan for the preparation of the Environmental Impact Statement.  The Implementation Plan also
describes the alternatives and issues to be evaluated in the Environmental Impact Statement.
<p>

  <p>         
<b>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</b>
  <p>         
<b>Background</b>
 <p>          
On October 24, 1994, the Department of Energy issued a Notice of Intent in the Federal Register
(55 FR 53442) to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement for the fabrication and deployment
of a multi-purpose canister-based system for the management of civilian spent nuclear fuel (MPC
Environmental Impact Statement).  In the Notice of Intent, the Department identified the
proposed action as the fabrication and deployment of certain components of a multi-purpose
canister-based system.  Specifically, the proposed action includes two sizes of MPCs (a 125-ton
and a 75-ton MPC), with associated rail transportation cask and on-site transfer casks.  The
proposed action would provide a standardized container system to handle, store, transport and
dispose of spent nuclear fuel in order to minimize or eliminate the need for the spent nuclear fuel
to be removed from canisters or casks during storage and transportation, and, to the extent
practicable, be compatible with disposal.  DOE requested comments on the scope of the
Environmental Impact Statement.  
 <p>          
The Notice of Intent established a public scoping period which began October 24, 1994, and
ended January 6, 1995. However, the Department found it practicable to consider all comments
received by March 31, 1995.  The Department held public scoping meetings in Las Vegas,
Nevada on November 21, 1994; Chicago, Illinois on November 30, 1994; and Washington, D.C.
on December 7, 1994, to provide an opportunity for public participation by interested
individuals, organizations, and other governmental agencies.  During the public scoping period,
about 400 commenters provided a total of 2,832 comments, either by participating in the
meetings
or by submitting comments via response forms, letters, postcards, toll-free telephone messages,
facsimiles, electronic mail, or electronic bulletin board to the Department.  In response
to comments received during scoping from the Department of the Navy, the scope of the MPC
Environmental Impact Statement has been expanded to include consideration of the use of
MPCs,
and alternatives to the MPC-based system, for naval spent nuclear fuel.  The Department of the
Navy will be a cooperating agency in preparing this EIS, in accordance with 40 CFR  1501.6
and
10 CFR  1021.342.
<p>      
<b>MPC Environmental Impact Statement Alternatives</b>
<p>     
The alternatives to be evaluated in the MPC Environmental Impact Statement address future dry
storage, transportation, and disposal needs, and include the fabrication and deployment of a range
of single- and dual-purpose cask and canister hardware systems, and a multi-purpose canister
hardware system.  The alternative hardware systems differ in whether they are based on
single-unit, heavily-shielded "casks" that feature bolted lids, or on relatively thin-walled
"canisters" that are sealed by welding and used with separate, specialized overpacks for purposes
of storage, transportation, or disposal.  
 <p>          
The five alternatives to the proposed action that will be evaluated in this EIS are:  (1) a
"no-action" alternative, which is the current technology comprising different systems of
specialized single- and dual-purpose canisters  and casks that have been certified by the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission or are currently undergoing certification; (2) the current technology
supplemented by high-capacity rail transportation casks; (3) a system of transportable storage
casks; (4) a system of dual-purpose canisters; and (5) a system utilizing only the small (75-ton)
MPCs.  Alternatives (4) and (5) were added in response to comments received during the public
scoping period.
<p>        
<b>Areas to be Addressed</b>
<p>     
The MPC Environmental Impact Statement will address potential environmental impacts of the
proposed action and alternatives in three general areas:  1) manufacturing, 2) handling and
storage
activities at facilities, and 3) transportation.  The analysis of the potential environmental impacts
of these three areas of activity will emphasize those impacts which discriminate among the
alternatives.
 <p>     
<b>Manufacturing:</b>
 <p>     
Because the actual sites where manufacturing would take place have not been chosen, the
analysis
of potential manufacturing impacts will be based on the environmental settings of typical or
representative manufacturing facilities (those facilities that currently produce hardware identical
or similar to the proposed or alternative hardware systems), as well as a qualitative site-specific
analysis at two known potential manufacturing locations.
<p>             
<b>Handling and Storage:</b>
 <p>     
The evaluation of at-reactor handling and storage activities will be based on representative site
data derived from data collected at existing spent fuel storage locations.  Site-specific National
Environmental Policy Act documents for commercial reactor sites already have been issued by
the
U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Handling and storage activities for naval spent nuclear
fuel
at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory will be addressed in the Naval Spent Nuclear Fuel
Appendix to the MPC Environmental Impact Statement.  The analysis in the MPC
Environmental
Impact Statement of potential impacts at a repository will consider the use of the MPC and
alternative hardware systems only for surface activities, since ultimate disposition impacts can be
meaningfully assessed only in connection with proposed repository acceptance criteria.  Such
criteria will be analyzed in a separate Environmental Impact Statement that the Department will
prepare for the candidate repository at Yucca Mountain, Nevada.    
<p>              
<b>Transportation:</b>
 <p>         
The impacts of transportation activities for each alternative will be assessed using existing
transportation impact models for shipments. Transportation evaluations would consider
shipments
between each existing storage location and two hypothetical Monitored Retrievable Storage
facility locations, and subsequently to the candidate repository facility at Yucca Mountain, or
between each existing storage location directly to the candidate repository facility. 
Representative
routes will be chosen between origination and destination sites for purposes of assessing the
potential risks involved in such transportation, including use of a potential rail spur at Yucca
Mountain.
<p>     
<b>Availability of Implementation Plan</b>
<p>
Copies of the Implementation Plan are being provided to Federal agencies, Indian tribal
organizations, State and local government agencies, public interest groups, manufacturers of
equipment, transportation interests, industry and utility organizations, regulators, and
