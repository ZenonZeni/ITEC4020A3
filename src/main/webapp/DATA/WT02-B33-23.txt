MANX AND LOGANAIR TO RATIONALISE OPERATIONS

      Airlines of Britain Holdings -- owner of British Midland
Airways, Manx Airlines, Manx Airlines Europe and Loganair -- will
rationalise the regional airline operations of the latter three
companies following a decision by group Chairman Sir Michael Bishop
shortly before Christmas. The move comes as Isle of Man-based commuter
operator Manx Airlines is expecting to see continued recovery in 1996
after losses in 1994. 
      In an interview with C/R News International, Manx Airlines
Commercial Director Mike Bathgate said that since Loganair and Manx
Airlines Europe both fly as British Airways Express franchisees, it
makes sense to rationalise operations with those of Manx Airlines.
Effective 1 January, the three airlines' operations will be managed by
a single Manx Airlines management team. Glasgow-based Loganair will
continue to trade in its own name under the leadership of Managing
Director Scott Grier.

Job Losses at Loganair 

      Bathgate said there will "probably" be some Loganair job losses
in Scotland "on the accounting side," but this will depend on how many
staff relocate. He claimed that there will be no visible change to
operations, although rationalisation of routes and equipment will be
decided in the coming weeks ahead of the resumption of a summer
schedule in the second quarter of 1996.
      During 1994, Manx Airlines plunged into heavy losses of several
millions of pounds following its takeover of much of the Loganair
operation. Manx increased in size by more than 80%, as 11 aircraft and
40 routes were added. In 1995, the airline established its franchise
agreement with BA, which had begun under Scott Grier as he prepared to
lead a Loganair management buyout from Airlines of Britain. That move
subsequently did not proceed, with Bishop instead retaining Loganair
as a smaller element of the group.
      Now the airline's fortunes have been reversed, says Manx
Managing Director Terry Liddiard.  "In 1995 we have turned [the loss]
round completely, and expect a healthy profit," he told a staff sales
and marketing conference. Liddiard attributed the airline's improved
status to strict control of costs, revenue growth and the efforts of
Manx's 850 staff. Goals set for 1996 include improved punctuality,
better handling of customer complaints, and "the best planned service
recovery in any situation."

BRITISH MIDLAND EYES LONGER ROUTES; WILL ABANDON DC-9s

      British Midland, with 100 flights daily from London Heathrow,
is looking to extend the profits it has realized from successful code-
sharing arrangements by starting new service that could make the
carrier a much larger force in Europe.

    The airline, which code-shares with American Airlines, United
Airlines and Virgin Atlantic, is examining several new destinations
from Heathrow, including Rome, Madrid, Cairo, Warsaw and Budapest, an
industry source says. The longer-haul routes could be flown with
excess SAS aircraft, possibly even Boeing 767s. SAS owns 40% of
British Midland and already has subleased eight 737-500s to the
carrier.
    The second-largest carrier in the U.K., British Midland also plans
to eliminate three McDonnell Douglas DC-9s from its fleet during the
next 18 months as it adds new 737-500s and Fokker 70s. 
     The carrier now has a fleet of 36 aircraft, including 22 newer
737s. By April 1996, it will get rid of its oldest aircraft, a DC-9-10
that was the sixth DC-9 ever made, delivered in 1965. The aircraft is
under lease from Ansett Worldwide Aviation. By 1997, British Midland
plans to cast off three DC-30s leased by Electra Aviation. During that
time it will take delivery of additional 737s and F70s. 
    Once the DC-9s are gone, British Midland's fleet will have an
average age of about four years. The carrier has used a strategy of
starting up a route with smaller aircraft, such as a 737-500 or a
Fokker 70, and then switching to larger aircraft when the route
becomes more profitable. 
    British Midland recently began what it claims is the first
reservations booking service with payment made on the Internet. The
new system, called CyberSeat, is aimed at the 50 million Internet
users, a figure British Midland says is growing 10% per month.
CyberSeat still allows travel agent pickup for tickets.

SCOTTISH REGIONAL AIRPORTS REEL FROM SEVERE WEATHER 

    The worst winter weather in years struck island airports off the
north coast of Scotland late last month, closing some as a result of
combined high wind, snow and ice. Severe conditions were aggravated by
record low temperatures, although some regional services were expected
to resume 28 December to Shetland Island airport at Sumburgh after a
four-day break. Sumburgh is the region's most important airport,
supporting a series of inter-island operations, scheduled services to
the mainland and continuous flights connected with offshore energy
shuttles. 
    Snow drifts as much as 30 feet deep were reported on Shetland, as
gale force winds drove some of the worst blizzards seen on the island.
Sumburgh Airport closed on Christmas Eve and even as scheduled
operations were due to resume late last week, more bad weather was
being forecast for the region. The cold conditions were felt farther
south on the Scottish mainland with Glasgow reporting temperatures as
low as -18 degrees Centigrade and with nighttime temperatures set to
fall as low as -22 C.
    Loganair, which operates as British Airways Express, told C/R News
International that along with being unable to fly to Sumburgh,
operations to Lerwick were being interrupted by heavy snow. It also
had to abandon a flight to Donegal, Ireland, because of bad weather,
instead diverting at least one service to Londonderry. 
    Aberdeen-based Business Air told C/R News International that its
services to Sumburgh via Inverness had also been hit by airport
closures and air traffic control delays, although services resumed 28
December. 
    Highland and Islands Airports (HIA), which manages Sumburgh and
Inverness airports and the aerodromes at Benbecula, Islay, Kirkwall,
Stornoway, Tiree and Wick, told C/R News International that all the
region's airports had been affected by the winter weather. The
principal problem has been ice rather than deep snow, although it
reported up to 3 feet of snow on Sumburgh's airport ramps. 
    As much as an inch of solid ice has built up on runways at all of
the island airports as melted snow has frozen. This has constituted a
major problem for Sumburgh, since the Shetland Isle airport relies
upon the delivery, by road, of de-icing agents from Lerwick; it was
still cut off on 28 December. HIA reported that conditions were so bad
that a fully loaded British Aerospace ATP flown by British Airways
could not operate into Stornoway on the island of Harris in the Outer
Hebrides. With the threat of continuing severe conditions, HIA
concluded that the region's airports "could cope," but conceded that
the "unusual ice problem" was the greatest factor influencing
continued air connections to the mainland of Scotland.

TYROLEAN AIR CONVERTS FOKKER 70 OPTION TO ORDER, ADDS TWO OPTIONS

    Tyrolean Airways picked up one of its three options on the Fokker
70 and added two more options 22 December. 
    The airline now has four firm orders and four options on the
regional jet. The newest Fokker 70 -- in a 80-seat, single-class
configuration -- will be delivered in August.
    The order is seen as a boost in confidence for the type. Tyrolean
shareholder Austrian Airlines boosted its own Fokker 70 fleet from
four to seven late last month (C/R News International 25 December
1995,).
    This recent transaction puts the Fokker 70 order book at 71
orders. Total orders for the JetLine family, which includes the Fokker
70 and the Fokker 100, now total 361.

MD-95 PRODUCTION WILL NOT BEGIN FOR AT `AT LEAST A YEAR'

    It will be "at least a year" before production begins on the MD-
95, McDonnell Douglas spokesman Don Hansen says. The program is just
getting under way following the big ValuJet Airline order, and design
work must be completed, Hansen says (C/R News International, 30
October 1995, p. 8). A total of $200  million has been allocated for
non-recurring development costs, says Executive Vice President John
Wolf. Work will be done at Asia-Pacific subcontractors Halla
Engineering and Heavy Industries Ltd. of South Korea, Korean Air's
Aerospace Division and Japan's ShinMaywa Industries.

ICAO PREDICTS WORLD AIRLINE TRAFFIC UP 7% IN '95

    The world's airlines will have carried more than 1.3 billion
passengers in 1995, up 5% over the 1.2 billion carried in 1994, the
International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) predicts. In
addition, 21.6 million tons of freight will have been transported, up
8% over 1994. The data indicate a continuing recovery of the world
airline industry and the likelihood of record traffic growth in 1996.
    ICAO estimated that airlines will have flown 2.2 trillion revenue
passenger kilometers (RPKs), an increase of 7% over the 2.1 trillion
flown in 1994. Capacity, based on available seat kilometers (ASKs),
will have risen 6%, to approximately 3.3 trillion, and average
passenger load factor will rise 1 point to 67% worldwide.

CITYFLYER EXPRESS PREPARES FOR FOURTH ATR-72

    British Airways Express franchiser CityFlyer Express is preparing
to receive its fourth ATR-72-200. The airline took delivery of its
third 66-seat ATR-72 late last year, adding capacity as the operator
prepared for a busy Christmas season. The new aircraft, scheduled to
be delivered to CityFlyer Express "in the early New Year," will be the
carrier's 10th. CityFlyer Express currently operates six ATR-42s and
the three ATR-72s. It serves a network of British and European
destinations from its headquarters at London Gatwick Airport: Antwerp,
Amsterdam, Rotterdam, Cork, Dublin, Dusseldorf, Guernsey, Jersey,
Leeds/Bradford, and Newcastle.

EUROPEAN AIRPORTS, AIRLINES PUT SPIN ON EU GROUND HANDLING DECISION

    While airport officials are generally pleased with the European
Union's recent compromise on ground services liberalization, they are
concerned that some provisions will slow or even reduce the trend
toward commercialization and autonomy of European airports. 
    The EU's directive last month [see box at right] marks the end of
a long debate between airlines and airports over ground-handling
rights, for the time being at least. Monopolies on ground handling
services are maintained by some European airports, while airlines
enjoy monopolies at other airports. There is limited and open
competition at still other airports.
    European airlines began lodging complaints against airport
monopolies with the EU as far back as 1991, and their actions were
responsible in part for the formulation of recommendations for the EU
directive. The airlines' recommendations were more far-reaching in
their attempts to foster competition.
    The EU's directive allows exemptions for airports that are either
too small or congested to immediately accommodate competition, and
delays until 2003 liberalization at many of Europe's largest airports.
It also allows airports to charge a concessions fee to third-party
ground handling companies.
    The directive is a "substantial improvement" over earlier
proposals, says Sheena Gibson, head of the European Policy Unit for
Airports Council International - Europe (ACI). But the Association of
European Airlines decried the EU's directive.
    Le Thi Mai, general manager for environment and infrastructure at
AEA, says it was not happy with the "watered down" directive. The
eight-year waiting period before complete liberalization of ground
handling services is too long, she says.
    What concerns ACI is its conviction that the introduction of
third-party competition for baggage and passenger handling, catering
and fueling services infringes upon the rights of privatized, self-
financed airports to make important financial decisions about their
own operations. There seems little doubt that the proposal will
negatively affect the finances of some airports that rely heavily on
ground handling for revenue.
    Le Thi Mai makes the case that the EU's protection of airport
ground handling monopolies until 2003 is a form of "regulatory" state
aid that undercuts the argument that these airports are truly 
privatized. The directive actually favors airport monopolies, AEA
argues, which under certain circumstances will be allowed to exist
after 2003. Monopolies enjoyed by airlines, however, will be
dismantled under the directive, AEA contends.  
    AEA cites Olympic Airlines' monopoly at Athens Airport as an
example. Olympic will have to relinquish its monopoly before 1999 and
compete for ground-handling rights with other parties. Yet some
airports, such as Frankfurt, will be able to retain their monopolies
until 2003. "I don't like monopolies held by airports or airlines," Le
Thi Mai explains. But if airports are allowed to maintain their
current monopolies, then airlines should also, she argues.
    On the other hand, ACI feels the EU's proposal for "unlimited
[airline] self-handling" will create new monopolies, the very
situation the EU is trying to prevent, says Gibson. Large airlines at
smaller airports will so dominate ground handling, that the EU's
directive is tantamount to reducing competition, she explains. Robert
Payne, Frankfurt Airport's spokesman, agrees. Larger airlines "are
positioned to leverage themselves and to have competitive advantage
over other groups," he says. 

Space Constraints, Efficiency Drew Concern of Airports' Concern 

    ACI is also concerned about space constraints at airports --
Frankfurt being the prime example -- where there is little or no room
to accommodate new competitors. The financial cost of creating this
extra space "would be horrendous," says Kelly, not to mention the
political cost from environmental protests against expansion.
Frankfurt Airport may have to sacrifice some of its aircraft parking
space in order to accommodate new ground handlers, Payne indicates. 
    Loss of aircraft parking space presents another issue: disruption
of airport operations. Payne says Frankfurt is "concerned about being
able to maintain [its] levels of efficiency and capacity," which he
believes are optimized by having only one ramp handler. Frankfurt's
efforts to maintain a 45-minute maximum for traffic transferring at
the facility may be jeopardized by the new EU rules, as well. Jacques
Reder, spokesman for Aeroports de Paris, operator of Paris' two main
airports, says it would be "impossible" to accommodate more than the
two handlers already at each airport because of ramp congestion. 
    Le Thi Mai questions why Frankfurt cannot achieve the efficiency
of an airport like Heathrow, where ground handling competition is
liberalized. Frankfurt, however, is more space-constrained than
Heathrow.
    Economies of scale will also be hurt by introducing new
competitors, says Payne, who points out that Frankfurt has not raised
its ground handling fees for a number of years. Airports also face a
loss of revenue if new companies are allowed to compete against
airport monopolies. Frankfurt accrues 38% of its revenue from ground
handling services, while Aeroports de Paris, operator of Paris
airports, generates 19%. ADP spokesman Jacques Reder says introduction
of a third ground handling company at either Orly or Charles de Gaulle
will have a negative effect on ADP's revenue, all of which is
reinvested in the airports.
    AEA counters with financial assessments researched by an
independent university. Airline ground handling costs would be at
least 30% lower at airports that offer competitive ground handling,
she says. These types of services cost European carriers between $2.3
billion and $2.5 billion in 1991, she explains. Extrapolated, airlines
could have saved as much as $750 million that year under a more
liberalized environment.

EU DELAYS FULL LIBERALIZATION OF GROUND HANDLING

    A final document detailing the EU's directive has not yet been
formed, but in general advocates allowing European airlines to offer
their own self-handling services in order to lower the cost of air
travel to airlines and passengers. Specifically, the EU says:
    *  airlines will be able to operate their own baggage handling by
1999. Airlines involved in alliances, however, will be precluded from
handling the baggage of other carriers unless they qualify as third-
party handlers.
    *  terminal and airside handling services will be open to third
party competition by 1 January, 1999, at airports that handle more
than 3 million passengers annually;
    *   airports handling more than 3 million passengers annually can
appeal for two-year exemptions in 1999 and 2001. There will be no
extensions granted after 2003.
