<P>Mental health professionals are being confronted by the new forms of
reproductive technology. Specifically, the surrogate mother, herself, challenges
many of our assumptions about human behavior. In this new arena psychologists
have had to question personal and theoretical beliefs regarding bonding,
attachment, loss, pregnancy and family. We are being called upon to collect
data, predict behavior, and counsel participants in the varying options available
to creating families.
<P>In an attempt to understand behavior and the effects of surrogate parenting,
two studies were conducted. They explored the perceptions of women volunteering
to serve as both the gestational and biological mother to the purpose of
relinquishing their parenting rights to an infertile couple.
<P>The first of the studies included 89 surrogates who were participating
in a surrogate mother program in the Los Angeles area. The program's staff
psychologist collected demographic information and statements regarding their
motivations to be a surrogate during an interview. The MMPI was also collected
and 376 items were used. The second of these studies included follow-up surveys
which were mailed to surrogate mothers who had relinquished a child and to
adoptive couples who had received a child through the surrogate process.
The survey consisted of 25 questions, both short answer and likert scale,
that addressed their reactions to and thoughts about their surrogacy experience.

<H3>Surrogate Mother Profile
</H3><P>
<P>The demographics of the 89 surrogate mothers can be summarized as follows.
The women had a mean age of 28 years and a mean of 2.0 children. The mean
number of years of formal education was 13. A ratio of five to one of the
women were anglo. Of the sample, four to one were currently married and three
to one had full-time employment. The vast majority of the sample had been
raised in a Christian faith, with 25% being Catholic. The Black and Asian
population and the Jewish heritage were nearly absent from this sample.
<P>Abortion and adoption occurred in the histories of the sample. Only three
participants had adoption as part of their history. Of these, one was adopted,
one had placed a child for adoption, and one had siblings who were adopted.
Of the surrogate mother sample, 37% had abortion in their history. Thirteen
percent of the women had had more than one abortion. For some, unresolved
feelings regarding these terminations were a factor in their desire to be
a surrogate.
<P>The motivations to become a surrogate mother are summarized in table one.
Enjoyment of the pregnant state and the desire to be pregnant again were
cited by the vast majority of surrogate mothers. These women uniformly described
their previous pregnancies as relatively easy. Being pregnant seemed to provide
an opportunity to feel special and to feel a sense of wholeness. They also
felt empathy for childless couples, an empathy increased by prior contact
with an infertile couple's pain and by the importance of children in their
own lives. A third motivation was the desire to do something remarkable with
their lives and make a unique contribution. Many perceived being a surrogate
as providing a sense of accomplishment. Financial gain was also cited but
consistently was not the primary motivating factor. The surrogates described
the fee as becoming less important as their relationship with the adoptive
couple increased. Of the participants, 12% indicated that being a surrogate
mother was an attempt to compensate for a prior loss in their history. The
most obvious examples were the surrogates who earlier had voluntarily terminated
a pregnancy and believed that creating a child for someone else may help
them resolve feelings regarding the termination.
<P>The mean scores and ranges of the MMPI are presented in figure 1. The
profiles were typically unremarkable with most scores falling within one
standard deviation of the midline. Only 7.9% of the surrogate mothers had
a clinical score above the 70th percentile. Overall, 2.3% had two clinical
scores elevated above the 70th percentile. Of the clinical scores, scale
1 had the lowest mean. Scale 0 had the widest range of the clinical scores,
from the 30th percentile to the 78th percentile. The correction scale was
especially notable and overall was the most elevated scale. Furthermore,
73.9% of the profiles had a F-K score of -11 or less. Because the MMPI was
taken during the women's screening process for acceptance into the program
the K score and the F-K score might be interpreted as the surrogate mothers'
tendency to be guarded and/or deny emotions in the hopes of making a good
impression.
<P>The individual MMPI profiles revealed no critical pattern typical for
this sample. Elevations of scales 1, 2, 8, 7 were notably absent from the
profiles. Scales 0, 6, 9, 4 and 5 were more present but were not significantly
elevated. In summary, it can be stated that surrogate mothers of this sample
do not exhibit pathology according to the MMPI.
<P>However, given the limitations of this measure, we must use other instruments
and techniques to understand the dynamics of the women who choose to be surrogate
mothers. Extensive clinical interviews and participation in support group
meetings, and additional tests are valuable tools in assessing surrogates.
It is important to explore both conscious and unconscious motivations so
to assess whether being a surrogate serves as a functional or dysfunctional
purpose for the participant and her family. Thorough assessment will prevent
collusion with pathology, exploitation, or unhealthy degrees of denial.

<H3>Follow-up Study
</H3><P>
<P>Of the participants in the study described above, 37 have relinquished
the child to the adoptive parents and are at least 10 months post-partum.
Follow-up questionnaires were mailed to 37 surrogates, 20 of whom responded.
A similar follow-up questionnaire was mailed to the 37 sets of adoptive parents
who had received children from these surrogate mothers. Of the adoptive couples,
16 responded. The responses are summarized in table two.
<P>The 20 surrogates who responded to the questionnaire ranged from 10 months
to 3 years post-partum. Their emotional adjustment since the relinquishment
of the child demonstrates two components. The first component being feelings
reported for approximately two weeks after birth. Four of the surrogate mothers
reported post-partum blues. Two of them mentioned longer term concerns. One
expressed concern about her daughter's adjustment to the relinquishment of
the child and the other expressed a concern about what the child might feel
toward the surrogate in the future. Secondly, surrogates reported missing
the contact with the adoptive parents and their special role as a surrogate
mother. some surrogates grieved the loss of pregnancy itself because it was
expected to be their last pregnancy. Additionally, several surrogates reported
that convincing others that she felt at peace with the relinquishment caused
periodic frustration. The questioning ad doubts expressed by some friends,
family, and acquaintances as to why she was not noticeably grieving were
bothersome.
<P>Grieving over the separation from the child was notably absent. The attachment
was most often greater to the couple than to the child. The surrogates'
perception that it was always "their child" is often based on the fact that
the child would not have come into being if it were not for the particular
couple's desire. the belief that the baby; was always the couple's child
minimized feelings of loss. Surrogates consistently described their feelings
of attachment for this child as different than their feelings for their other
children. Affection and care was expressed, but the bonding was described
as similar to attachment for a friend's or relative's child.
<P>All of the surrogates reported positive feelings since the birth of the
child. These included feeling satisfied, fulfilled, resolved, and better
about themselves. All felt surrogacy was beneficial for themselves. Five
reported an increase in confidence and an enrichment of their lives. Another
nine reported a stronger marriage and greater appreciation of family and
children. Five to two of the respondents were able to articulate a clear
positive influence on their lives by being a surrogate mother -- for example,
increased marital communication, being inspired to pursue further education
and increased individuation from extended family. They also reported that
their immediate family had adjusted better than their extended family.
<P>When the surrogates thought of the child they reported thinking mostly
of the adoptive couple's happiness. They also expressed curiosity at how
the child looks and how he or she has developed. Of the 20 surrogates who
responded, six to one perceived the child clearly as the couple's child.
Only 3 of the surrogates perceived the child as still shared by the couple
and by themselves. Overall, of the 20 who responded, there was a minimal
amount of emotional discomfort reported by the surrogate mothers in relation
to themselves and their children.
<P>The adoptive couples similarly reported very little emotional discomfort
due to their having worked with a surrogate mother. Of the 16 couples, three
reported stress and discomfort concerning the artificial insemination process
and anxiety regarding achieving a conception and three others reported that
they had wished they had been more involved in the pregnancy. The adoptive
couple consistently reported that the child's genetic connection to only
one parent had very little influence on how they related to the child in
general. Of the fathers, three reported feeling a greater sense of closeness
and understanding because of their genetic relation to the child. All of
the couples reported that they perceived the child as their child, not as
the surrogate's child or as a child they feel is shared with the surrogate.
It could be hypothesized that the surrogates' and couples' shared perception
that the child is the couple's child demonstrates denial which helps to minimize
discomfort.
<P>Both surrogates and couples reported that they felt they had sufficient
contact with the other party. The twenty surrogates who responded all had
post-partum contact through the child's first birthday. Of the nine surrogates
for whom over two years or more had passed, all but one had contact through
the second year. Typically, the adoptive parents sent cards and photos at
Christmas and/or the child's birthday. Fourteen of the surrogates who
participated in the study reported that they had met face-to-face with the
couple and child at least once after saying good-bye at the hospital. Only
one couple reported any degree of fear that the surrogate will make uninvited
contact. Within this group of adoptive parents, 15 couples stated that they
plan to tell the child of its adoption, and one couple was uncertain as to
what they would do.
<P>The adoptive couples and the surrogate mothers seemed to agree on several
points in this follow-up survey. None of the adoptive couples or the surrogate
mothers regretted their decision to participate in the program. Additionally,
they both reported that knowing each other was beneficial to their experience.
In the surrogates' reports, as well as in the couples' reports, the appreciation,
warmth, sharing, and knowledge of each other were helpful in making the
experience meaningful and enable the surrogate to more easily relinquish
the child. They also predicted that knowing each other benefitted the children
involved. The couples and the surrogates both want surrogate parenting legalized
so there will be appropriate restrictions and regulations on the process.
For instance, both sample groups felt that surrogate mothers should have
a psychological evaluation prior to participation in such a program.
<P>These studies are a beginning of necessary longitudinal studies on surrogates,
their families, and the children. the data presented agrees with the minimal
literature to date suggesting that surrogate mothers do not exhibit pathological
personalities and appear to function well both before and after the birth.
It further suggests that contact between the individual and the families
who have come together to create this child should be open. The contact appears
to provide a positive and communicative environment for all participants.
Furthermore, the open relationship helps to minimize secrecy and denial which
are detrimental to the children.
<P>New reproductive alternatives are now established, but it is mandatory
that we proceed with caution. Mental health professionals can assume a
significant role in evaluating, monitoring, and counseling within the new
programs. Psychologists can be helpful in preventing exploitation. The psychology
professional must assess for each individual where surrogacy constitutes
a constructive life step or where it is a collusion with pathology.
<P>However, in order to assist attorneys, physicians, and families, we need
to reassess the values, beliefs and assumptions of our culture and of our
profession regarding acceptable ways to create families. History suggests
that forms of surrogacy have provided acceptable alternatives in different
cultures and at different times in our history. Perhaps surrogacy will become
another behavior that we will come to understand as not pathological, but
as one that broadens the continuum and definition of what humans can think
and feel. Specifically, surrogacy may expand our knowledge about varying
degrees of attachment behavior between biological mother an child. We may
now have to question what is commonly perceived in our society as an absolute
attachment that every woman feels to every child she carries. The road ahead
is indeed a challenging one. Above all else, we must proceed with the children's
best interest as our primary concern.
