Dear Senator Gregg:<P>
On  behalf of the Council for Exceptional Children (CEC), the largest professional organization of teachers, administrators and parents who are concerned with the education of children with disabilities and/or giftedness,  I am writing to express our strong opposition to the current Continuing Resolution (CR) that if extended through the fiscal year would cut $3.1 billion in education programs--the largest cut in education in history!<B><P>
The bill would cut $40 million in programs under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) and severely impact critical programs including: professional development, innovation and development, clearinghouses that provide information on the education of children with disabilities, early childhood education, special education technology, the regional resource centers and special studies on the education of children with disabilities. </B><P>
The CR would cut the IDEA professional development program by 25 percent!  With States reporting a shortage of special education teachers of more than 27,000, the need for professional development in special education has never been greater.  Every child with a disability should be educated in a school staffed by capable, well-prepared professionals.  The inclusion of more children with disabilities into the regular classroom places an additional demand on the need for quality training of our classroom teachers.  The cut in funding for the IDEA professional development program is short-sighted and will result in the lack of adequate training for those on the front line of education.<P>
Funding would also be reduced by 25 percent for the Innovation and Development program under IDEA.  This program supports the backbone of research in the education of children with disabilities.  Part E of IDEA provides new knowledge and develops improved approaches and products to better the education of children with disabilities.  As issues regarding the education of students with disabilities shift from access to education to the quality of the education provided, it becomes increasingly imperative that there be a continual investment in research and innovation activities that help teachers improve the quality of the services to children with disabilities.  Research, however, is useless without the dissemination of the information obtained.  That is why IDEA authorizes three clearinghouses to provide current, reliable information to parents, teachers, and others on the education of children with disabilities.   The clearinghouses help translate special education research into an understandable format that can be used by parents and professionals and should be at least funded at the FY 1995 level.<BR>
<B><BR>
</B>The Early Childhood Education program funds outreach projects and research activities to address the special needs of children aged birth through eight that have disabilities.  The Part G technology program funds projects designed to discover technology breakthroughs that will help children with disabilities learn.  The regional resource centers and the special studies program work to conduct large scale national research projects that the regional resource centers can use to assist States in addressing challenges in special education.  All of these small but critical programs are cut 25 percent!   <B><P>
We urge you to support education programs.  With only 2 percent of the federal budget dedicated to education, surely we can afford to at least maintain the federal commitment to the education of our children.  Please restore funding to at least the FY 1995 level for special education programs and all programs that benefit the education of children.<BR>
</B><BR>
Sincerely, <P>
<BR>
<BR>

B. Joseph Ballard<BR>
Assistant Executive Director<BR>
