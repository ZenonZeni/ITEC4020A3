<P>
An Open House kicked off our celebration of <I><B>50 Years of
the Science and the Sea</B></I> at the <B>Marine Science Institute</B>.
It was held on Saturday, May 25, at the MSI adjacent to the Corpus
Christi Ship Channel in Port Aransas from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.</P>
<P>
By all accounts the event was a great success. There were between
1000 and 1500 visitors to the Institute that day. Most were treated
to many tours of the facilities, including the popular Fisheries
and Mariculture Laboratory. About 120 people were lucky enough
to win a 2-hour science cruise aboard the R/V KATY, during which
they sampled the water to discover new and exciting things about
creatures that live in the bay. </P>
<P>
The community of Port Aransas gave strong support to our 50th
anniversary celebration. The local newspaper, the <A HREF="phototour.htm">South Jetty</A>,
ran several stories about the Institute and the Open House for
weeks prior to the event. Many local merchants, the Chamber of
Commerce, and the Library gladly allowed us to post announcements
for the Open House at their locations. The Mayor of Port Aransas
honored us by proclaiming May 25th as <I>&quot;University of Texas
Marine Science Institute Day.&quot;</I> Many civic groups, including
the Rotary Club, Lions Club, VFW, American Legion, Keep Port Aransas
Beautiful, and EMS Auxiliary, provided <A HREF="../../images/openhouse/ohtour8.gif">food and drink</A>
for our guests. EMS personnel were on hand all day. And most of
all, a huge number of residents came out to visit the Institute.
