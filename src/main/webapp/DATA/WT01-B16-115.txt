<H3>The Enrichment Industry in the Russian Federation. <A HREF="http://www.uilondon.org/uiabs95/mikbio.html">Viktor Mikhailov</A>.
</H3>


Firstly the antecedents of the present Russian Ministry for Atomic energy (Minatom) are
outlined: in August 1945 a special committee on atomic energy was established by the Soviet
government, followed by the first main government department. In 1946 the first controlled
nuclear chain reaction in Russia was achieved at the Kurchatov Institute, following Fermi's in
Chicago. In 1948 the first industrial scale reactor in Russia, for plutonium production, started up
at Mayak, together with the first radiochemical facility for extraction of weapons grade
plutonium. In 1952 Russia's first isotope separation facility was commissioned, and in 1954 her
first nuclear reactor for peaceful purposes began operation.

<P>
Minatom was established in January 1992; 80% of its capacities are in Russia, the remainder in
Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Belarus. Minatom employs one million workers in its
R&amp;D and industrial facilities. Only 14% of its programme is associated with defence; other
portions of the Ministry deal with the nuclear industry (design, development, commissioning and
decommissioning of nuclear power stations, including the whole fuel cycle from uranium mining
to reprocessing and disposal); applied sciences; mechanical construction and tool production;
and the construction and assembly industry. 

<P>
Civil production within the Ministry has increased by 1 or 2% annually, and exports have
doubled since 1992. A new VVER-1000 unit at Balakovo nuclear power station has also been
commissioned. Russia now has nine power stations operating 29 nuclear reactors, with 22
gigawatts of electrical capacity; this represents 30% of the total electricity generated in European
Russia, though only 12% of total electricity generated in Russia including Siberia. Minatom plan
before 2005 to increase total capacity to 28 or 30 gigawatts. Attention is also being given to
nuclear development abroad, in China, India, Iran, Brazil, and possibly Indonesia.

<P>
Russia has four uranium enrichment facilities, in Ekaterinburg, Tomsk, Krasnoyarsk and
Angarsk, total enrichment capacity 20 million SWU annually. Development of isotope separation
has gone through the stages of gaseous dynamic nozzle technology, gaseous diffusion, and
centrifugal isotope separation, now in its fifth generation. Centrifuges are efficient and reliable,
average frequency of rotation 1000-2000 rotations per second. The next stage, laser technology,
is not seen by the author as being competitive for heavy atoms like uranium.

<P>
Russia is only using 50% of her enrichment capacity, for domestic and export production, and
is therefore open to foreign markets for her high technology centrifuge separation. The author
looks forward to the increasing use of nuclear power in the next century.
