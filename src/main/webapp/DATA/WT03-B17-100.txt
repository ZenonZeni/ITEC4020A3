<BLOCKQUOTE><H1>Diving Bikini Atoll - <FONT SIZE=+2>A First-Hand Report</FONT></H1>
<P><IMG SRC="diver3.gif" ALT="Picture of a diver" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="106" HEIGHT="163" BORDER="0">When operation crossroads and subsequent nuclear testing were launched on Bikini atoll, in 1946, the Navy could not have considered how its misfortune would become our good fortune, fifty years later.  Ships were left, in the lagoon, with full armament aboard just to prove that the Army's bomb wouldn't sink them.  Of course, they sank beautifully.  Bikini has just reopened to the public and is claiming its place among the wreck diving wonders of the world, ahead of Rabaul Harbor, Scapa Flow and Truk Lagoon.  
<P>For our November expedition there, we had to travel a long way but were rewarded with the stuff dreams are made of.  During our week stay, we had perfect tropical conditions to dive an aircraft carrier, two battleships, two destroyers and two submarines, all in pristine condition.  There were sharks, tuna and other pelagics on every dive.  By the end of the week, most of the group members were already planning their return trip for next year.  There is enough on these wrecks to explore for a lifetime. 
<P><HR><IMG SRC="bikinifh1.jpg" ALT="Photo 1" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="242" HEIGHT="166" BORDER="0"><B>The ships:</B> The USS Saratoga was the focus of five of our twelve dives.  Nearly nine hundred feet long, she presented the greatest distance to cover.  We were awed at the size of the flight deck and the bow but the ship's insides were the most exciting.  There are innumerable deck levels and elevator shafts leading to hangars and passages full of airplanes, guns, bombs, depth charges, torpedoes, and other military equipment.  We were particularly amused to find fluorescent light tubes that had survived the nuclear blast and sinking.  On several of our dives, we penetrated deeper into her passageways than has ever been done since she went down.
<P>We conducted two dives on the HIJMS Nagato, the second largest battleship the Japanese ever built.  The first dive took us from her gargantuan props to her equally imposing sixteen inch guns.  Nothing really compares to looking into the barrel of one of these at 165 feet.  On the second dive, we swam into the bridge, where Admiral Yamamoto once stood and gave the orders to attack Pearl Harbor.
<P><IMG SRC="bikinifh2.jpg" ALT="Photo 2" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="184" HEIGHT="240" BORDER="0">Though not as eerie as the Nagato, the USS Arkansas is nearly as big, lying inverted on the bottom in 180 feet of water.  Her guns are not as impressive and she doesn't have the big props but she served with distinction in two world wars, including both Atlantic and Pacific campaigns of WW II.  The most significant part of this dive was seeing the huge dent the Baker blast put into the ship's heavily armored hull. 
For the four remaining dives, we visited two destroyers, the Anderson and Lamson and two submarines, the Apogon and Pilotfish.  All similar in size, they were just large enough and deep enough that you could cover the entire exterior of a ship in a single long dive.  The pristine condition of the ships left us with the impression that we could simply float them and drive them away.  They are well complemented with a wide array of intact guns, torpedoes, depth charges, periscopes, propellers and anchor chains.  
<P>Any one of the ship we visited would be on the Christmas wish list of the most spoiled wreck diver.  Together they form the best wreck diving destination in the world.
<P><HR><IMG SRC="bikinifh3.jpg" ALT="Photo 3" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="330" HEIGHT="230" BORDER="0"><B>The diving:</B> The diving is fairly advanced and ideally suited to someone with at least an IANTD Advanced Deep Air rating or equivalent.  Depths generally range from 100 to 180 feet.  However, the water is warm and very clear, with no discernible currents.  Bikini is an ideal place to take technical training.  Since most, if not all of the dives involve staged decompression, a minimum of Advanced Nitrox or previous decompression experience is required for those people not taking training.
<P>The scuba center on Bikini has a full mixed gas facility with all blends of Nitrox and Trimix available.  The boat has surface supplied decompression oxygen for emergencies, though divers are also expected to carry their own decompression gas.  Single tanks with H valves and doubles with isolation manifolds are available, as are stage bottles, in a variety of convenient sizes.  There is a full repair shop and they even have a couple of scooters for rent.
<P><HR><B>How to get there and what to expect:</B> The trip from the US is long.  You fly to Honolulu, then to Majuro, in the Marshall Islands, where you take a small plane to Bikini.  Adding to the adventure, there are overnight layovers and other stops on the way, as the planes sometimes seem more like a train on the local track.  Once there, accommodations are very comfortable and clean, with plenty of good food.  There are also many amenities such as a library, a game center, a very well stocked video room and even a shop that sells basic items.
<P>From a radiological standpoint, the island is very safe.  Ongoing tests by independent laboratories have concluded for years that radiation levels are lower there than in most US cities.  The drinking water is uncontaminated, and the fish are safe to eat but you can't eat the plants yet.  Likewise, the ships are safe to dive on as long as you don't decide to eat a couple buckets of silt!
<P>We once said about Grenada: "this trip is fun!".  We're saying it again about Bikini.  This trip is fun, a whole lot of fun!  Go there while it is still wild and untouched!
