<H2><font color="0000DD">Proper Use of Trademarks</font></H2>
This section discusses basic rules to follow in using Varian's trademarks.
If you have questions about how to use a trademark, or if you have 
suggestions about the materials in these pages, please contact
Sandy Hirose in the Legal Department.<P>
The most important step you can take in protecting Varian's trademarks
is to use them properly. The rules and examples in this section show
proper use of trademarks and illustrate some of the most common
examples of misuse.<P>
If another company inquires ab out how to use a Varian trademark properly
in text, advise them to use the rules outlined in this section. For
graphical uses, you should advise them of any specifics of the appearance of the 
trademark - color, typestyle, graphics, etc. - which will distinguish
the mark from other words.<P>
<A NAME="guidelines">  
<h3><font color="C50B21">Grammatical Guidelines</font></h3>
<H4>Use a Trademark as a Proper Adjective</h4>
A trademark is a proper adjective; it should, therefore, never be used as a
common descriptive adjective. This means that it should at lesat begin with a 
capital letter and that it should describe a noun. Generally, the noun
follwing the trademark is the descriptive or generic name of a product.
The descriptive name should appear in the print of the surrounding text.
The mark identifies a particular brand of a product or service and modifies
the generic name for the product or service. It is not the name of the
product or service itself.<P>

<blockquote>
	<em>EXAMPLE:</em> ConFlat flanges
</blockquote><P>
To further emphasize our trademarks, you may follow the trademarks with the 
word "brand" written in the print of the surrounding text.<P>

<blockquote>
	<em>EXAMPLE:</em> ConFlat brand flanges
</blockquote><P>

In advertising copy when there is repeated use of the trademark, as a minimum
requirement, you may use the generic term following only the first prominent
use of the trademark.<P>

<blockquote>
	<em>EXAMPLE:</em> The UltraMass ICP-MS permits a variety of tasks to be
	accomplished simultaneously. UltraMass is simple enough for use in any
	laboratory environment.
</blockquote><P>

<h4>Avoid Using the Possessive Form</h4>
Do not use the trademark in the possessive form. That is, do not use it with
an apostrophe to show ownership.<P>

<blockquote>
	YES: VACION pumps are of great value.<br>
	NO:  VACION'S value is great.<P>
	
	YES:  EIMAC planar triodes<br>
	NO:   EIMAC's planar triodes<br>
</blockquote>	
<h4>Avoid Using the Plural Form</h4>
Do not use the mark in a plural form.<P>
<blockquote>
	YES:  LINATRON linear accelerators help customers boost productivity. <br>	
	NO:   LINATRONS help customers boost productivity.
</blockquote><P>
<h4>Avoid Using the Verb Form</h4>
Do not use the trademark as verbs.
<blockquote>
	YES: A Germini spectrometer will be used to analyze the steroids in
	constraceptive drugs.<br>
	NO: Gemini the steroids in contraceptive drugs.<P>
	
	YES: Make a copy on the Xerox copier.
	NO: Xerox a copy of this letter.<P>
</blockquote>

<h4> Use a Trademark Distinctively and Consistently</h4>
You should always distinguish our trademarks from other words in the text
in some way. This may include capitalizing all letters in the trademark, using
initial caps, using initial caps with quotation marks, using italics, 
boldface, underline, a different color, or an agreed upon form. The
trademark should be the most prominent word in the text either by size,
font, or color.<P>

Trademarks should also be kept complete and separate. Do not abbreviate
them or use only a part of the trademark. Do not combine them with other
words or numbers. Always ensure the mark is spelled correctly and reproduced
faithfully; avoid any variations. Also avoid using words such as "original" 
or "genuine" with a mark. Use of such words implies the presence of the same
product by others.<P>

<blockquote>
	<em>EXAMPLES:</em><P>
	
	<strong>Trademark:</strong> STAR<P>
	
	YES:  STAR local area network	
	NO:   STAR-2000 local area network<P>
	
	
	YES:  STAR 2000 local area network	
	NO:   STAR-Edit feature of the local area network<P>
	
	YES:  STAR-edit feature of the local area network<P>

<H3><font color="C50B21">Use of Trademark Notices and Symbols in the United 
States</font></h3>

Companies in the United States use the superscript symbols  &#174;, &#169;, and "SM"
to give notice that they claim trademark rights in a product name or service
name. Althoug the law does not require use of any of these symbols to increase
public recognition that the product or service name is a trademark, please follow
these guidelines:<P>

<blockquote>
	&reg; Can be used only with trademarks which have been <strong>registered</strong>
	in the United States Patent and Trademark Office. Use of this symbol without
	registration is forbidden by law, can bar subsequent registration, and can
	impair our ability to sue infringers of the mark.<P>
	
	If you cannot reproduce the superscript symbol, another way of to give
	notice of registration is to display the words "Registered in the U.S. Patent
	and Trademark Office" or the abbrevation "Reg. U.S.Pat. & TM Off." with the
	trademark or in a footnote. You may also follow the trademark with an R in 
	parenthesis (R).<P>
	
	&#153; Can be used with any product name regarded as a trademark by placing
	the symbol adjacent to the mark at the mark's first or most prominent
	appearance. Do not use the &#153; following the generic name of a product
	or service.<P>
	
	YES: 	RES ELUT (TM)  column<br>
	NO: 	RES ELUT COLUMN (TM)<P>
	
	The &#153; is generally used with <strong>unregistered</strong> trademarks.
	An unregistered trademark is one which has been adopted by the business unit
	for use as a trademark but has not been registered with the United States
	Patent and Trademark Office. <strong> However, it should not be used unless
	the Legal Department has first cleared the mark.</strong> See Sections on
	<a href="procedures.html#selection">Selection</A>, 
	<a href="procedures.html#search">Searches</A>, and <a href="procedures.html#adoption">Adoption.</A><P>
	
	Another way to give this notice is to state "[PRODUCT NAME] is a trademark
	of [COMPANY]" with the trademark or in a footnote.<P>
	
	SM Can be used with any service name regarded as a service mark. <STRONG>However,
	it should not be used unless the Legal Department has first cleared the 
	mark.</strong> See Sections on <a href="procedures.html#selection">Selection</A>,, 
	<a href="procedures.html#search">Searches</A>
	and <a href="procedures.html#adoption">Adoption.</A><P>
	
	Another way to give this notice is to state "{SERVICE NAME} is a service
	mark of [COMPANY]" with the trademark or in a footnote. The SM is generally
	used for an unregistered service mark.<P>
	<em>EXAMPLES:</em><P>
	XIMATRON &reg; simulator<br>
	STAR &#153; gas chromatography system<br>
	CLINAC(R) linear accelerators<P>
</blockquote><P>
If a trademark appears repeatedly in a brochure, article, or other literature, you
need only use the appropriate trademark symbol with the first prominent 
appearance of the trademark.<P>

If you have a combination of a registered trademark and an unregistered trademark,
you may give notice in the following ways:<P>

<blockquote>
	Propose &reg; Docu program<br>
	Propose &reg; Docu &#153; program
</blockquote><P>

When the mark is registered in one or more states (but not Federally), it is
permissible to identify it as a registered mark by using a footnote. i.e., "A registered
trademark of Varian Associates, Inc."<P>
	

<A NAME="other">
<h3><font color="C50B21">Use of Other Companies' Trademarks</font></h3>

When we use the trademarks of other companies in our literature, we should follow
the same rules as we do in using our own trademarks properly. The trademark
should be used as a proper adjective and separated from other words in the text.
Although there is no legal obligation to do so (unless we have agreed in a contract),
we may choose to acknoledge the trademarks of other companies with a footnote. When
trademarks of a number of comapnies appear in the same piece of literature,
you may need to clarify ownership of each of the trademarks with a footnote.<P>

<blockquote>
	<EM>EXAMPLE:</em><br> The UltraMass ICP-MS uses the OS/2 graphical user interface
	operating system.<P>
	OS-2 is a trademark of International Business Machines Corporation.
</blockquote><P>

A foot note for a publication which refers to trademarks of two or more companies
may be worded as follows:<P>

<blockquote>	<EM> EXAMPLE:</EM><br> UNITY<em>plus</em> and VNMR are trademarks of
	Varian Associates, Inc. All other trademarks are the property of their
	respective owners.
</blockquote><P>
As a matter of courtesy, you may also ask a company how it would like its
trademark acknowledged.<P>

Never let outside companies use our trademarks or service marks without a 
formal license. Failure to keep others from using the mark without license may result
in our loss of rights to the trademark.<P>
