American Research Corporation of Virginia will spin-off a separate company called Monolithic Magnetics, Inc. to design, manufacture, and market patented, low-cost monolithic modules for use by the power supply and instrumentation segments of the computer and electronics markets. The technology which serves as the basis for the new business is under development by ARCOVA and involves the spray deposition of low loss ferrites that serve as cores for magnetic components. The increased performance efficiency, higher power density, and improved transient characteristics afforded by integrated planar magnetic circuitry are important in the development of very high speed integrated circuits.<P>

The technology will provide benefits to U.S. Agencies that employ high efficiency power converters in aeronautical, aerospace, and electronic warfare applications. Commercial uses include aircraft, computers, automotive electrical systems, hybrid/electric vehicles, medical diagnostics, communication systems and consumer electronics.<P>

The military market is highly specialized and is less sensitive to price than to size, weight, and performance. The availability of monolithic magnetic devices will provide the Department of Defense and its contractors with the ability to produce power converters and power supplies operational at megahertz frequencies, that can be miniaturized for use in electronic packages for spaceborne, airborne, and critical defense missions.<P>

Civilian markets are more easily delineated. Price is a more sensitive factor, but high performance planar power converter units offer many advantages that favor their introduction in a wide range of applications. Commercial applications include communication and aeronautical equipment, medical devices, consumer electronics, power electronic systems, personal computer power supplies, automotive power electronics, electric and hybrid electric vehicles, power generation and electric motor drive systems.<P>

<B>Next commercialization step:</B><P>
Monolithic Magnetics, Inc. is looking to establish cooperative relationships with Original Equipment Manufacturers of electronic power converters for sales to manufacturers of computers, electronic office equipment and consumer electronics.<P>
