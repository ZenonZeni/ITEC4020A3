<H3>Opening Doors: Specific Appropriation And Authorization Recommendations</H3>
<H4 align=right><A HREF="/housing/sperling.htm#open">Return to Table of Contents</A></H4>
<HR>
<P>The CCD Housing Task Force believes that during the next five years the total loss of subsidized housing opportunities for people with disabilities will be at least 273,914 units.  This number represents a 40-50% reduction in occupancy from the date of implementation of designated housing policies and a very conservative estimate of the number of individuals on public and assisted housing waiting lists who will have been denied an opportunity to move into public and assisted housing as a result of designation. 
<P>
<h4>Replacement Of Lost Housing </h4>

<P>The specific appropriation and authorization recommendations below are designed to <i>replace</i> units lost, rather than expand the housing supply.  They have been calculated based on reasonable Section 8 turnover projections and budgetary limitations. 
<P>
<OL>
<li>Authorization and appropriation of funds for 75,000 new Section 8 tenant based subsidies from FY 1997 -  FY 2001.<P>
	
<li>Redirection of Section 8 certificate and voucher turnover through a mandatory federal preference which would require one out of every three turnover subsidies to be issued to a person with a disability under age 62.<P>

<li>Redirection of 50% of the current Section 202 funding levels for FY '97 to a set-aside of Section 811 rental assistance to be directed towards communities experiencing the greatest negative impact on people with disabilities from designated housing policies.</ol>
<P>
<h4>Expansion Of Housing Options</h4>
<P>The specific appropriations and authorization recommendations below are designed to <I>expand </i>housing opportunities for people with disabilities based on their worst case housing needs. When considering these recommendations, it is important to emphasize that the CCD Housing Task Force is opposed to housing which is designated as "disabled-only" with the exception of projects for people with severe disabilities that are funded through  the Section 811 program.<P>

<ol>	
<li>Create specific set-asides within any future rental assistance or housing production programs to ensure that at least 33% of the resources are dedicated to meeting the housing needs of very low income people with disabilities under age 62.<P>

<li>Create specific "thresholds" within the CDBG and HOME programs which will ensure that people with disabilities receive their fair and equitable share of new federal housing funding that is targeted to expand the supply of affordable housing.  The CCD recommends a 10% threshold in the CDBG program and a 33% threshold in the HOME program.<p>

<li>Re-authorize the federal Low Income Housing Tax Credit Program, which has proven to be an excellent mechanism for expanding the supply of supportive housing for people with disabilities.<P>
	
<li>Maximize the use of HUD McKinney funds for the provision of permanent housing for people with disabilities who are homeless, and encourage the utilization of mainstream service funding for the provision of services and supports.<P>

<li>Create "self-sufficiency" policies linked to federal housing programs that are responsive to the specific needs of people with disabilities.<P>

<li>Create a home ownership demonstration program targeted to people with disabilities on SSI, and other very low income people with disabilities who are typically not included in federally funded home ownership initiatives.   This demonstration program could be linked with Fannie Mae's development of  a mortgage product targeted to people with disabilities receiving SSI benefits. <P>

<li>Provide incentives for PHAs to direct capital funding to increase the number of one-bedroom units for people with disabilities in family public housing which typically only contains two, three, and four bedroom units.<P>
	
<li>Provide "bonus" funding for PHAs who choose to maintain "mixed" housing for elderly people and people with disabilities.<P>

<li>Expand the Fair Housing Initiatives Program to specifically include monitoring of public and assisted housing providers implementing designated housing policies. </ol>
<P>
<h4>Recommendations Regarding The Section 811 Program</h4>
<P>
<OL>
<li>Section 811 program funding should be made available only to non-profit organizations.  The CCD Housing Task Force strongly opposes any attempt to permit PHAs to apply for Section 811 funding  both under its current structure (capital advances and project-based rental assistance) and under any tenant-based rental assistance structure.<P>

<li>The capital advance and long-term project-based rental assistance contract components under the Section 811 program should be maintained as eligible activities. <P>

<li>The activities authorized under Section 811 should be expanded to include the use of long term (5-10 year) project-based rental assistance that is not linked to Section 811 capital advances. <P>

<li>Incentives should be incorporated to encourage non-profit organizations to develop independent housing models with Section 811 funds, including condominium purchases, limited equity cooperatives, and scattered site housing. </ol>
<P>
<h4>Recommendations For Technical Assistance </h4>

<P>The CCD Housing Task Force recommends that a comprehensive affordable housing technical assistance initiative be developed and funded that is specifically targeted to people with disabilities, advocates, and service providers to:
<P>
<ul>
<li>Increase affordable housing opportunities and choices for people with disabilities in local communities through better access and use of federal, state, and local affordable housing resources; and
<P>
<li>Strengthen the capacity of organizations representing people with disabilities to assume a leadership role within their states and local communities on affordable housing issues and strategies, with a specific emphasis on the Consolidated Plan.</ul>

<P>The specific goals of a technical assistance initiative would be to:
<P>
<ol>
<li>Enhance the ability of individuals and organizations representing different disability groups to work together collaboratively and collectively on common housing strategies.
<P>
<li>Increase the disability community's knowledge and understanding of the affordable housing delivery system and the mainstream affordable housing resources controlled by that system that can expand housing opportunities for people with disabilities.
<P>
<li>Assist the disability community to accurately quantify the loss of federally subsidized housing in local communities as a result of "elderly only" designated housing policies.
<P>
<li>Educate the disability community on current and impending changes to federal housing policies and programs, including the federally mandated Consolidated Plan, and how it can be used to ensure that people with disabilities receive an equitable share of federal housing block grant funds, rental subsidies, and public housing resources.
<P>
<li>Facilitate the participation of the disability community in the development of state and local affordable housing strategies within the Consolidated Plan process, so that housing for people with disabilities is included in state and local communities' housing strategies and policies.
<P>
<li>Educate people with disabilities and advocates on how to effectively use the Fair Housing Laws to protect people with disabilities from discrimination in housing programs and policies.</ul>
