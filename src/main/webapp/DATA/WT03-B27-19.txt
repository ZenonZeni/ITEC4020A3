<p>
We were able to visit with most of the Challenge players over the past three days and ask them to respond to your great comments and questions.  We aren't able to answer all of them because of the huge number we received, but we are able to post many of them here. 
<P>
<li>Jack Nicklaus<br>
<P>
<UL>From Steve Hammer:<br>
I collect Ping and other putters.  I would like to know what is your all time favorite putter?
<P>
<UL>
<i>At this stage of my career, my favorite putter is the one that's working today. </i>
</ul></ul>
<P>
<UL>From Bob Lewis<br>
Why don't you play more often on the Senior Tour?
<P>
<UL>
<I>The Senior Tour is terrific for most of the guys, but the courses are set up short in order to accomodate everyone.  That, combined with soft greens, makes the courses play easy which I have never played well, because my strong suit was never my short game.  My strengths have always been course management and the long game.</i>
</ul></ul> 
<P>
<LI>Peter Jacobsen<br>
<P>
<ul>From Brad Niles:<br>
No question -- just wanted to wish  you and the other members of the Ryder Cup team the best of luck.  Bring it home!
<P>
<ul>
<I>Thanks for the encouragement, Brad.  I think we have a great team this year.</i>
</ul> </ul>
<P>
<UL>From Sharon Moore<br>
Are there any plans to bring a PGA Tour event to Portland?
<P>
<UL>
<I>The PGA offered us a tour event this year opposite the World Series of Golf, but we felt we just didn't have time to prepare properly.  We would need two years to plan properly.  It's something we continue to look at and evaluate, but we're having an awful lot of fun with The Challenge right now.</i>
</ul></ul>
<P>
<LI>Steve Elkington
<P>
<UL>From: Michael Tollin:<br>
How do you hit a 7-iron 202 yards?  Strong lofts, or are you really that strong?  How far do pros hit an average 7-iron with off the shelf lofts?
<P>
<UL>
<i>It depends on many factors, such as wind, slope, lie, elevation and probably most of all, adrenaline.  All things being equal, most pros hit a 7-iron about 170-180.</i>
</ul> </ul>
<P>
<LI>Ben Crenshaw
<P>
<UL>From: Doug Johnson:<br>
What is the best way to practice at the range -- with one club per session, or with multiple clubs?
<P>
<UL>
<i>I like to start with the short clubs and work my way through the bag to the driver.  And then finish with a few more pitch shots.</i>
</ul> </ul>
<P>
<LI>Fred Couples
<P>
<UL>From: Jack and Mary Dare<br>
Tell us the truth, Freddie, how is your back?
<P>
<UL>
<i>It feels good and isn't giving me any problems right now.  My problem is that I'm a little rusty so I plan to play in 3 out of the next 4 tour events between now and the Ryder Cup.</i>
</ul> </ul>
<P>
<LI>Ernie Els
<P>
<UL>From: James Lowry<br>
Do you have a diagonal move forward initiating the down swing, or do you keep your spine centered and rotate your left hip around it?
<P>
<UL>
<i>I don't use my legs quite as much as some of the players out here, and my forward move tends to be more of a turn than a slide.</i>
</ul></ul>
<P>
<UL>From: Will Przybylek<br>
How does it feel to be the best young player on the PGA Tour?
<P>
<UL>
<i>I have faults in my swing like anyone else.  I'm trying to get my game more under control.  I feel like I'm maturing a little bit, and I've enjoyed being in contention the past few weeks.</i>
</ul></ul>
<P>
<LI>Phil Mickelson
<P>
<UL>From: Bill Phillips<br>
Are you a natural lefty?  Did anyone ever try to get you to play golf right-handed?
<P>
<UL>
<i>Actually, I do everything right-handed.  I started playing golf left-handed because I would watch my father practice in the back yard.  I would stand facing him to get an image of his swing, and I would swing along with him.  To do that, I was swinging left-janded.</i>
</ul> </ul>
<P>
<LI>Payne Stewart
<P>
<UL>From: Les Taylor<br>
What are the reasons that professional golfers can hit the ball consistently farther than I can?  I hit the ball pretty well, but I can't get the distance I see the professionals hitting it.  Is the balls you use, the clubs, or your swing? 
<P>
<UL>
<i>We all have access to the same equipment in terms of balls and clubs -- the main reason the players out here are so long is technique and timing.  Distance comes from clubhead speed and clubhead speed comes from a delayed hit, versus hitting it from the top as so many amateur players do.</i>
</ul> </ul>
<P>
<LI>Brian Henninger
<P>
<UL>From: Patrick Keane<br>
I recently read John Feinstein's book on the PGA Tour, "A Good Walk Spoiled", and I felt that your feature was the most compelling and interesting.  I wish you all the luck in the world on the tour.
<P>
