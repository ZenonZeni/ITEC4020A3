Let's be realistic. Legalizing marijuana is a terrible idea which would
have serious negative side-effects. <BR>
<BR>
Proponents of legalization are making false arguments that may sound good,
but are often simplistic and short-sighted. Legalization may lessen the
violence surrounding drug dealing. But the real problem is violence resulting
from drug use, and this must be addressed with strong law enforcement, substance
abuse treatment, prevention and a commitment to cultural change. <BR>
<BR>
Do we need marijuana as medicine, as some legalizers claim? Not according
to many medical experts who say marijuana is neither safe to use nor effective
for medical use. <BR>
<BR>
And marijuana users are fooling themselves if they think smoking pot isn't
harmful. The active ingredient, THC, is addictive, and users can get hooked
just as they can on alcohol or cocaine. More than 5,000 Illinoisans listing
marijuana as their drug of abuse were treated at state-funded programs last
year. Many pot smokers also suffer serious health problems and are a threat
to others when they're high. <BR>
<BR>
Any tax revenue resulting from legalization would be minimal compared to
the social costs of addiction. Legalization would create even more clients
for an already overburdened treatment system -- at a much higher cost. But
treatment is only part of the price we pay. We also pay for marijuana users
increased health problems, reduced productivity, injuries from accidents,
auto crashes, and crime. All the media hype over legalization of marijuana
is particularly scary when you think of the impact on our young people.
Marijuana is the most widely used illicit drug among Illinois teens. Thirteen
percent of students have tried it. The good news is marijuana use is down
slightly according to a recent state survey. We must send strong and consistent
messages to our youth about what society considers appropriate behavior.
A message that it is &quot;OK to get high&quot; is not a message that stresses
healthy relaxation and coping with problems in a mature manner. The majority
of Americans believe legalization is not the answer.
