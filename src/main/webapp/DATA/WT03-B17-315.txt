<PRE>
     Synthetic chemical pesticides, are not the only way to manage pest  and
   disease  problems. Crop rotation, green cover crops,  traps,  barriers,
   hand  picking,  biological  controls, organic  products,  and  cultural
   controls   such  as  companion  planting  methods,  planting  resistant
   varieties  of plants, organic fertilization, using compost  and  proper
   watering   are some of the alternatives to these chemicals   Pesticides
   cannot  replace  good  gardening habits  and  techniques,  despite  the
   constant  advertising  to  the contrary.  Chemical's  treat   only  the
   effect; good gardening practices correct the cause. Remember, eliminate
   the  cause  and you eliminate  its effects. It's just not as simple  as
   the ads would have it. Pesticides appear to help, but they do not, by a
   long  shot. In fact, while 300 insect species were listed as  resistant
   to  pesticides  in  1970,  by 1996, 880 were.   We  rely  too  much  on
   agricultural chemicals and instead of good gardening practices.
<P>
     All  Garden  Centers  sell  chemical products to rid  you  of  insects,
   fungi,  disease, animals, or weeds. These include all forms of  organic
   or  synthetically  produced pesticides.   The  term  pesticides  covers
   anything  that   controls any type of pest or disease.  Pesticides  are
   supposed to control these. Because pesticides work only on a short term
   basis  (given time pests and diseases become immune to the  pesticide),
   new     formulations,   or  slightly  different   mixtures   of   these
   ingredients, are constantly being developed  just to provide some  type
   of  control.   Over  the last few decades, there has been  an  enormous
   increase  in  the amount of chemicals, both pesticides and fertilizers,
   that people put on their gardens and lawns. This has been costly to the
   environment,  & to our health. Misuse causes health problems  later  on
   not to mention death or immediate injury to ourselves, our children and
   our  pets.  Chemicals are very much like some prescription drugs,  they
   can  appear to be helping in curing a specific  illness or aliment, but
   not  only  is it not the answer to the problem (doesn't deal  with  the
   cause)  but  it  can additional problems if relied upon  on  a  regular
   basis. There is no such thing as a "safe" pesticide, a pesticide has to
   be toxic for it to work.
<P>
<STRONG><H2>ABOUT INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT (IPM)</H2></STRONG>
<P>
     Integrated Pest Management, or IPM,  uses chemicals or  pesticides   as
   well  as  natural,  physical controls.    Emphasis is placed on finding
   the "least toxic" method  of control.  While I understand that this  is
   a  step in the right direction, this is not the answer. IPM does  teach
   people  the basics of good gardening but still allows you to use "least
   Toxic  chemicals".  While this method does help to reduce  the  use  of
   pesticides, it is mis leading to the general public. People  think  IPM
   means  Organic  and  therefore think they are  buying  totally  organic
   produce,  etc.  This is not the case at all. Many people  are  just  as
   allergic to these chemicals and most importantly, in my opinion,  there
   are  no  safe  pesticides. You cannot mix chemicals with Organics.  You
   cannot deal with the cause in this way, since the true cause is the use
   of  chemicals. Also least toxic can mean using such famous chemicals as
   Malathion,  Sevin,  etc. since these chemicals are considered  safe  by
   some  professionals as well as the Dept. of Agriculture. Its a case  of
   the fox guarding the chicken coop. Think about it people, the dept.  of
   Agri  says  that Malathion is so safe that you can spray a  whole  city
   with it!  Think LA!  Therefore it can be conceivably used in IPM as the
   "least  toxic" ! There are many chemicals that fall into this category.
   This  is  just a clever way for the pesticide companies to keep selling
   their  pesticides to farmers and to professionals, and to  the  general
   public. Don't fall for it!
<P>
     I  understand  the problem farmers, professionals, and  gardeners  have
   with pest and disease control. I understand that people have to be fed.
   I   understand that the world looks to us to develop methods of  farming
   that  produces enough food to feed us all. These things are obvious  to
   all  of  us but what's really obvious to some of us is that the use  of
   chemicals is a dead end road only making lots of money for the chemical
   companies at the cost of jeopardizing our future!
<P>
     Take  for example Trees. What is obvious to me is that we have  started
   upon  the  path genocide. We are destroying the very system  that  life
   depends  upon!   All Life on Earth depends upon massive forests  around
   the  world  to regulate energy, heat, oxygen etc. Forests  are  natures
   lungs as well as natures shock absorber. Look around the world or  even
   better  look  outside  and what do you see? Is your  climate  acting  a
   little  bit  weird? It doesn't matter where you live, the environmental
   normal has changed. Where before the environment was lush full of  life
   and  full  of  various animals, insects, etc.; now is  barren  lifeless
   environment.  Flooding, storms of unusual magnitude,  earthquakes,  one
   disaster  or  another,  starvation, deadly  viruses,  animals  becoming
   extinct at an alarming rate, are all becoming the norm instead  of  the
   unusual.  What  does this have to do with trees? How can  these  things
   come  about  simply  by  cutting down trees? Everything  is  connected.
   Everything!  What  we do to one part of the earth  effects  the  other.
   Really very simple!
<P>
<P>
     We  have done more damage to the environment in the last 50 years  then
   in  all  of  the history of mankind! Over 80% of the worlds trees  have
   been  cut!   While it is true that many lumber companies are replanting
   trees, they seem to think that a newly planted tree can replace a  tree
   that's  hundreds of years old! It will need at least 50 years to  begin
   to  equal  what the tree did that was cut down. By cutting  down  these
   trees  we  have weakened the earth's natural system of balance  and  to
   make things worse we are using chemicals that cause imbalance to nature
   as well as to ourselves!
<P>
     With all the doom predictions these days very little hope is coming out
   of this scenario. Very few people are promoting a better future for the
   human  race.  Many  cultures have their own prophets,  each  describing
   their  version of the future of mankind. These predications are governs
   by  their ability to see the whole picture. While they do predict  doom
   and disasters, they also predict hope and a alternative path for us  to
   take. The Hopis have a ancient wall that describes everything that  has
   happened  and where we are right now. The Hopis say that we as  a  race
   have  taken the path of technology and have disconnected ourselves from
   the  earth  and  her  ways.  The Hopis  also  say  that  we  are  at  a
   conjunction,  that  at this moment in time, we as a  race  must  decide
   which  path to take. The path of Technology will only work if we  merge
   it  with  the  Spiritual path. We must choose to live a spiritual  life
   first  then allow technology to provide us with the best it can provide
   us.  Technology does not have to destroy, pollute or cause illness, any
   more then living a spiritual life makes us monks.
<P>
     What  will  save  this planet and its inhabitants from  destruction?  A
   consciousness revolution! What does this mean? This is what  the  Hopis
   means  by  connecting back to the earth and her ways. This is  what  is
   meant by going inward to discover yourself and the true meaning of life
   for  you.  This  is what is meant by living your life  to  its  fullest
   extent  not by being the riches person on earth in terms of  money  but
   being  rich inside yourself. Being rich in happiness and joy. Being  in
   love  is  a special form of consciousness, one that allows you  to  see
   things differently then before. We all have a consciousness but some of
   us  have  their  consciousness in their wallets  instead  of  in  their
   hearts. Notice I said Heart and not head. Consciousness does not reside
   in  any part of your body but the special consciousness that comes from
   the heart will not allow you to do any thing that will cause injury  to
   any one else especially the earth.
<P>
     What  people every where are crying out for is for something to  happen
   that will cause an immediate raise in the consciousness of mankind as a
   whole.  An  example would be if we were visited by beings from  another
   planet!  Now  that would change the consciousness of  the  human  race!
   Another example is religion. The one thing, in my opinion that religion
   does  is that it raises the consciousness of those practicing it. There
   are  many  ways  to raise ones consciousness, this is a separate  issue
   entirely. A conscious person will not use chemicals at all! He  or  She
   will  look  for ways to promote balance in their little ecosystems  and
   rely on the basic laws of nature.
<P>
     I practice AIPM. Advanced IPM. In this system no man made chemicals are
   used. If it isn't found in nature, I don't use it!
   You will find that if you are 99% Organic that 1% chemical will get you
   every time!
<P>

   diseases check out my new book "Natural Pest Control"  which you
   got for free when you joined IGA.
