<P>

<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">In 1995, some 36 million US residents,

14 percent of the population, lived in households with below-poverty

level incomes. The poverty line--three times what a family needs

to spend to eat-- was $15,569 for a family of four and $12,158

for a family of three in 1995.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">For the first time, the Census Bureau

released poverty data on native- and foreign-born residents: 13

percent of the US-born residents were poor, versus 28 percent

of the foreign born who were not naturalized US citizens. Native-born

households had median incomes of $34,800, while households headed

by foreign-born persons had median incomes of $28,400.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">Also for the first time, the percentage

of Hispanics in poverty, 30.3 percent, exceeded the share of Blacks

in poverty, 29.3 percent, in 1995. The immigrant welfare restrictions

are expected to increase Hispanic poverty. </FONT></TT>
