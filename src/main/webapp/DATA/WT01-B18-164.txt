<title>Integrated Resource Planning</title>

<H2><I>B. </I>Integrated Resource Planning Has Been a Demonstrated Success</H2>

<BR>
During the past five years, federal, state, and public utility commission 
regulators have adopted regulations that successfully promote energy 
efficiency and renewables development. Among these successes has been 
adoption of a regulatory model known as "integrated resource planning" 
(IRP), or least-cost energy planning. Initially mandated in California in 
1990, IRP involves ranking all energy sources, including improvements in 
energy efficiency, by cost. An energy-efficiency improvement must be 
implemented first - before the acquisition of new generating 
capacity - if the improvement costs less per kilowatt-hour 
<I>avoided</I> than new supply would cost.<BR>
<p>     Although most states now claim to have adopted IRP procedures to some 
degree, only 10 have a regulatory framework that genuinely ensures that 
DSM can compete on an equal footing with supply options.<a href="#73" name="r73"> [ 73 ] </a>
