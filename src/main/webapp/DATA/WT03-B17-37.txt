<center><H3>GRIEF AND LOSS</H3></center>
<ul>
<li><H4>What is Grief?</H4></ul>
<P>

Grief is a normal and natural response to loss.  Whether the loss

involves the death of a loved one, the end of a special relationship,

or becoming disabled -- and whether the person is a senior citizen,

a child or a college student -- anyone can experience loss and grief.

<P>


At many points after a loss, the grieving person can benefit from the

support of others.  Individual grief reactions can vary widely, not

only from person to person, but also within the same person over time.

Accordingly, friends need to be ready to accept and support the

griever through a wide range of emotions.<P>

<UL>
<LI><H4>Reactions to Grief</H4></ul><P>

People who are grieving will experience many reactions to their loss

as they work toward resolution.  At various times, but especially at

first, the grieving person may experience intense and sometimes

conflicting feelings or may deny that the loss has occurred.  Strong

feelings such as sadness, helplessness, loneliness, guilt, or anger

can emerge.  Experiencing and accepting these feelings as natural

represents an important part of the recovery process.  Ultimately,

the grieving person reaches a point in the recovery process where

the loss becomes integrated into his or her set of life experiences.

He or she is now better able to carry out the tasks of daily living.
<P>



Throughout the recovery period people who are grieving will experience

many reactions.  Some of the following reactions may indeed be

experienced many times:
<br>


1.  Denial, shock, numbness -- reactions which distance the grieving

    person from the loss, thereby protecting him/her from being over-

    whelmed by emotions.<br>

2.  Emotional releases -- these reactions accompany realizations of

    different aspects of the loss, they frequently involve much

    crying and they are often important to the healing process.<br>

3.  Reactive Depression -- natural feelings beyond sadness (e.g.,

    feelings of loneliness, isolation, hopelessness, self-pity) which

    occur as the person more clearly recognizes the extent of the loss.

    For many, reactive depression is part of the necessary internal

    processing of the loss which the grieving person must go through

    before reorganizing his/her life.<br>

4.  Panic -- feeling overwhelmed, confused, fearful, unable to cope,

    and even believing something is wrong with oneself.<br>

5.  Remorse -- following a loss (whether through death, relationship

    breakup or disability) a grieving person sometimes becomes pre-

    occupied with thoughts of what he/she might have done differently

    to have prevented the loss or to have made things better.  This

    can be helpful as the person tries to make sense out of his or

    her situation, but can also lead to unrealistic feelings of

    remorse or guilt.<br>

6.  Anger -- this is a frequent response to a perception of injustice

    and powerlessness.  A significant loss can threaten the grieving

    person's basic beliefs about himself or herself or about life in

    general.  As a result (often to the grieving person's bewilderment),

    he or she can feel anger not only at a person perceived as

    responsible for the loss, or at God or life in general for the

    injustice of the loss, but also -- in cases of loss through

    death -- at the deceased for dying.<br>

7.  Need to talk -- in order to recognize and come to terms with the

    impact of the loss, the grieving person may express feelings, tell

    stories and share memories, sometimes over and over with many

    different people.<br>

8.  Physical ailments -- in response to the emotional stress of grief,

    many people are more vulnerable to a variety of physical ailments

    over the six to 18 months following loss (e.g., colds, nausea,

    hypertension, etc.).<P>
<UL>
<LI><H4>Obstacles to Grief</H4></ul><P>

Grief is a misunderstood and neglected process in life.  Because

responding to losses and death is often awkward and uncomfortable for

both grievers and helpers, those concerned may avoid dealing with grief.

With the myth that college years are always "happy years" and the

concurrent failure to recognize that death of someone close is not the

only type of significant loss, many potential helpers don't even

recognize that a student, employee, or friend is grieving.  Additionally,

in cases of death, the student in college may be living far away from

others who are experiencing the same loss.  All of these factors can

contribute to make the experience more lonely and unhappy than it

might be otherwise.
<P>



Society promotes many miscomceptions about grief that may actually

hinder the recovery and growth that follow loss.  For example, friends

and family may make statements such as, "You must be strong," "you

have to get on with your life," or "it's good that he didn't have to

suffer."  Such cliches may help the one saying them, but are rarely

helpful to the griever.  Other misconceptions may be that it is not

appropriate to show emotions except at the funeral or that recovery

should be complete within a prescribed amount of time.  Still other

misconceptions would imply that the grieving person is being inapropriate

when at times he or she breaks away from the grief, laughs, plays, is

productive at work, etc.  Friends need to avoid these and other ways

of predetermining what another's grief process should be like.  An

individual may have both personal and cultural differences in the

ways that he or she deals with grief; friends need to support the

bereaved in recovering and restoring balance in his or her own way.

<ul>
<li><H4>Guidelines for Helping Someone Who is Grieving</H4></ul><P>



Friends often ask themselves questions such as: What should I do?

What should I say? Am I doing the right thing? What can I do better?

Here are some suggestions for helping the person in grief.
<br>


1.  Take some kind of action.  Make a phone call, send a card, give a

    hug, attend the funeral, help with practical matters (e.g., meals,

    care of children).<br>

2.  Be available.  Allow the person time so there is no sense of

    "urgency" when you visit or talk.<br>

3.  Be a good listener.  Accept the words and feelings expressed, avoid

    being judgmental or taking their feelings personally, avoid telling

    them what they feel or what they should do.<br>

4.  Don't minimize the loss and avoid giving cliches and easy answers.

    Don't be afraid to talk about the loss (i.e., the deceased, the

    ex-boyfriend or ex-girlfriend, the disability, etc.).<br>

5.  Allow the bereaved person to grieve for as long or short a time as

    needed.  Be patient, there are no shortcuts.<br>

6.  Encourage the bereaved to care for themselves.  They need to attend

    to physical needs, postpone major decisions, and allow themselves

    to grieve and to recover.<br>

7.  Acknowledge and accept your own limitations.  Many situations can be

    hard to handle, but can be made easier with the help of outside

    resources -- books, workshops, support groups, other friends, or

    professionals.<P>
<ul>
<li><H4>Support for the Helper</H4></ul><P>

Supporting a grieving person can also be stressful for the helpers;

they need to take care of themselves while also attending to the needs

of the grieving person.  Since helpers themselves are often grieving,

they may need to address their own healing process.  This may include

having the opportunity to express their own emotions and turning to

other friends for support.<P>
<ul>
<li><H4>Final Note</H4></ul><P>

Just as there is no single pattern to grief, there is no single way to

help a grieving person.  Both the grieving person and any friend who is

trying to help may feel unsure and uncomfortable.  Either way, remember

that it is important to be yourself.  Furthermore, remember that as a

friend, just by listening and being with the grieving person, you

probably are helping.<P>
