<PRE>
     Flies  have  been around since before mankind. There are many  different
groups  of flies, from the common housefly to the hover fly. But  when
we  think  of flies we think of filth flies. Flies which are associated
with  human-generated garbage and animal manure. Many species of  flies
are  predators  or  parasitoids  of other  insects.  Their  larvae  eat
decomposing  animal bodies. Flies carry many different  diseases  which
can affect humans as well. There are over 85,000 species of flies.
