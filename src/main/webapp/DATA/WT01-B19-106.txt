<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="15">WATERLOO -- I would like to congratulate the
Waterloo Courier on the enlightening article regarding the arrest
of Allen Helmers on the use of marijuana for medical
reasons.&nbsp; I, too, am a fibromyalgia sufferer and have other
painful medical conditions in addition, for which there are no cure.&nbsp;
There are a lot of us out here.&nbsp; The fibromyalgia in itself
is devastating, and there are no clear answers for us.&nbsp; The
pain is always there to some degree.&nbsp; Sometimes it is more
manageable than other times. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="15">I think legislation should be enacted to enable physicians to
prescribe whatever it takes to help people rid themselves of
constant pain, even if only for a little while, a respite you
might say.&nbsp; Fibromyalgia is not a terminal disease, but it
feels like it.&nbsp; I've often wondered if perhaps people like
me are making the Dr. Kevorkians of the world more popular.&nbsp;
A person can handle only so much pain. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="15">Mr. Helmers, I'm sure, has all he can do dealing with the pain,
and I think it's ridiculous that our laws have allowed him to be
arrested for something that's helping him &quot;live.&quot;&nbsp;
I empathize with him, and I support him.&nbsp; Let's not be so
paranoid about drugs that we will not allow our physicians to prescribe
something to alleviate the pain and suffering. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="15">Wake up, legislators.</p>
