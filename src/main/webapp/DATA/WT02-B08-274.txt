<i>Below is the list of the new investigation projects which have been selected by NASA and the French Space Agency, CNES, in response to the research announcement of the TOPEX/POSEIDON Extended Mission. This comprises a total of 60 teams from USA, France, Australia, Japan, England, Germany, South-Africa, Denmark and The Netherlands. We are pleased to see such a wide community working together for the benefit and the success of the current TOPEX/POSEIDON and the future follow-on missions, including Jason-1.</i>
