this is shortly after class on tuesday next week -- the<br>
comparison without disclosure stuff is of cryptographic<br>
interest and has to do with anonymous e-cash transactions.<br>

		     "Intuition and Probability"<br>

<p>
     Most people think of mathematics as a tool for making<br>
 decisions in highly technical, well-specified circumstances.<br>
 Indeed, 99.9% of decisions are made by people without any<br>
 help from mathematics, using mathematical "intuition" which<br>
 is usually very good.<br>
     Part of our job, then, as mathematicians, can be to<br>
 help steer intuition when it is off course.  We give several<br>
 examples where intuition regarding probability is likely<br>
 to be wrong, and where different ways of looking at things<br>
 can perhaps set it right.<br>

      The following problem arises in a variety of circumstances (e.g.<br>
 bargaining, gossiping, passwords, entrapment): two people each possess<br>
 some information and wish to discover if the information is the same,<br>
 but without revealing any of the information in the case that it is<br>
 not. How can they do it?<br>
      We have collected a number of solutions, involving everything from<br>
 number theory to playing cards, paper cups and airline reservations.<br>
 We even have a solution that we think is perfect for computer science<br>
 majors.  We invite you to contribute further ideas to our list.<br>
      Joint work (more accurately, joint fun) with Ron Fagin (IBM) and<br>
 Moni Naor (Weizmann Institute). <br>
