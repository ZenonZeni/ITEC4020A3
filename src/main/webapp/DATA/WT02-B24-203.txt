<dt><B>A Surrogacy Program Tailored for Your Needs</B>
<dd>There are three surrogate programs, and deciding which is right for you
is an individual, and usually medical, pyschological, and financial decision.
<P>
<DD><B>Artificial Insemination Program</B>
<DD>The Surrogate mother's egg is used and she is artificially inseminated at an infertility clinic.  Following the successful insemination, pregnancy and birth, the Surrogate releases the baby to the couple for stepparent adoption by the husband's wife.  The husband is already the biological (natural) father.
<P>
Couples who generally choose this program have usually undergone a full hysterectomy; or have a genetic condition making the use of their own eggs not a viable option;  or have an immunilogical condition (i.e. are allergic	 to one another); or wife's eggs are no longer viable and will not create a viable pregnancy; or they cannot afford in vitro fertilization.

<P>
<DT><B>In-Vitro Fertilization Program</B>
<DD>The couple will create embryos using their own eggs and semen, then transfer the embryos to the Host Surrogate Mother.  Typically, the Couple and Surrogate's cycles are synchronized to facilitate the transfer of fresh embryos and thus optimize the chance of a conception.  When there are more embryos than necessary for a single cycle, remaining embryos can be frozen for use in a later cycle, thus making the procedure more cost effective. Following a successful implantation, pregnancy and birth, the Surrogate releases the baby to the biological parents, whose names appear on the original birth certificate, if the birth occurs in the state of California.  There is no need for adoption procedures.
<P>
Couples who generally choose this program have, or can create viable embryos, but experienced problems with implantation;  or had a partial hysterectomy but have viable ovaries; or she was born without a uterus but has ovaries; or is a DES exposed woman; or has an incompetent uterus.

<P>
<DT><B>In-Vitro Fertilization/Egg Donation Program</B>
<DD>An Egg Donor provides an ovum for fertilization by the sperm
of the couple. The resulting embryos belong to the couple and are transferred
to a Host Surrogate Mother. The Surrogate releases the baby to the Intended
Parents, and parental rights are established.
