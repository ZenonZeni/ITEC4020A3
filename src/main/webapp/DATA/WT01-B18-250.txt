Dear Mr. Olsen:  

     This replies to your July 21, 1993, letter concerning 
synthetic dronabinol (delta-9-THC).  

     In respect to the naturally extracted and synthetically 
manufactured dronabinol, the Drug Enforcement Agency has 
promulgated the enclosed regulation.  Please note that 
tetrahydrocannabinol is a Schedule I substance, but dronabinol, 
synthetic, in sesame oil and in a soft gelatin capsule, is a U.S. 
Food and Drug Administration approved drug product and is a 
Schedule II substance.  Both marijuana and tetrahydrocannabinol 
are Schedule I substances.  

     With respect to your other questions on marijuana, the 
original chemical researcher was Dr. Roger Adams of the 
University of Illinois chemistry department.  The pharmacology of 
the compounds was investigated by Dr. Seigried Lowe of the 
University of Utah.  A review of marijuana is given on page 549-
553 of Goodman and Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of 
Therapeutics, 8th Edition, Pergamon Press, 1990.  

     Sincerely yours,  

     Harold Davis  
     Consumer Safety Officer  
     CDER Executive Secretariat Staff (HFD-8)
