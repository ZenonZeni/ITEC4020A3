by Jon Gettman</CENTER>

<P>Cannabinoids are the active ingredients in marijuana, and
delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is the only psychoactive cannabinoid.
Excerpts from frequently cited journal articles follow the brief statements
below.  Because these excerpts are taken out of context, the reader is
encouraged to read the original journal articles.

<P>The primary marker of a drug with a severe dependence liability is
compulsive self-administration by animals in a clinical setting.  Animals
will not self-administer marijuana.

<P>Cannabinoids are non-toxic; lethal effects are non existent.

<P>The pharmacology of cannabinoids was well-characterized by the mid 1980's,
and indicates that marijuana does not pose greater health risks than
alcohol, tobacco, and caffeine.

<P>The discovery of the neural mechanism, the cannabinoid receptor system,
which accounts for the characteristic effects of marijuana began in 1989.

<P>Drugs with the highest potential for abuse have a direct effect on the
neurotransmitter dopamine; marijuana does not.

<P>Tolerance to marijuana has also been explained. It results from a natural
process and not cell toxification.  Research has proven that tolerance to
marijuana is not a characteristic of a dependence liability.

<P>Marijuana does not harm the immune system.

<P>The discovery of the neural cannabinoid receptor system provides evidence
of the physiological basis for the medical use of marijuana and
cannabinoids.

<P>Before 1989, because no one knew how marijuana's effects were produced,
scientists were allowed great breadth to speculate about the substance.

<P>Much of the harmful speculation about marijuana prior to the receptor
discovery has based in studies with severe methodological problems.

<P>Prior to 1989, many of these speculative hypotheses were presented to the
public as likely facts which supported various public policies; but no one
really knew what they were talking about.

<P>Primary Marker of Drug Dependence:  "[S]elf-administration of a drug to the
point where the behavior becomes obsessive and detrimental to the
individual is the primary criterion which must be met to classify a drug as
one with significant potential for dependence."  Cicero, T. (1992)
Assessment of Dependence Liability of Psychotropic Substances:  Nature of
the Problem and the Role of the College on Problems on Drug Dependence.
Contractor Document for the Office of Technology Assessment. (Springfield,
VA: National Technical Information Service.  1992.) (NTIS Doc.
#PB94-175643) pg. 6.

<P>Primary Clinical Test of Dependence Liability:  "If the abuse liability of
a substance as defined by the likelihood of it supporting drug-seeking and
drug-taking, is to be evaluated, an assessment of its reinforcing functions
by self-administration is clearly the method of choice."  Brady, J.V. "The
Reinforcing Functions of Drugs and Assessment of Abuse Liability."  In:
Problems of Drug Dependence, 1987.  Proceedings of the 49th Annual
Scientific Meeting, The Committee on Problems of Drug Dependence, Inc.
Harris, L. (ed.), National Institute on Drug Abuse Research Monograph 81.
Washington, D.C.: U.S. Govt. Print. Off., 1988.  pp. 440 - 456. pg. 452.

<P>Marijuana Does Not Meet the Primary Test for Dependence:  "While
self-administration of drugs has been taken as an indication of
psychological dependence and/or abuse potential, few reports claim to have
established experimental models for self administration of Delta-9-THC . .
. This observation suggests limited potential for development of . . .
limited psychological dependence due to the weak reinforcing properties of
Delta-9-THC."  Abood, M.E., and Martin, B.R. (1992), "Neurobiology of
Marijuana Abuse," Trends in Pharmacological Sciences 13:201-206. pg. 203.

<P>The Toxicity of Marijuana:  "lethal effects of overdose by humans are
nonexistent or rare"  Dewey, W.  Cannabinoid Pharmacology. Pharmacological
Reviews. 1986 Vol. 38, No. 2.  pp. 151 - 178. pg. 172.

<P>The Extent of Parmacological Research:  "Our studies of cannabinoids over
the past 22 years have touched upon virtually every aspect of their
actions."  Hollister, L.  "Peregrinations Among Drugs of Dependence:
Nathan B. Eddy Memorial Award Lecture."  In: Problems of Drug Dependence,
1989.  Proceedings of the 49th Annual Scientific Meeting, The Committee on
Problems of Drug Dependence, Inc.  Harris, L. (ed.), National Institute on
Drug Abuse Research Monograph 95.  Washington, D.C.: U.S. Govt. Print.
Off., 1990.  pg. 36-43. pg. 42.

<P>The Relative Abuse Potential of Marijuana:  "Compared with other licit
social drugs, such as alcohol, tobacco, and caffeine, marijuana does not
pose greater risks." Hollister, L.E.(1986), "Health Aspects of Cannabis",
Pharmacological Reviews, 38:1, 1-20. pg. 17.

<P>The Mechanism of Action for Cannabinoid Effects:  " [Quantatative
radiography has established that a cannabinoid receptor system in the
brain] "is the same receptor [system] that mediates all of the behavioral
and pharmacological effects of cannabinoids . . ."  Herkenham, M., Lynn,
A.B., et al., (1990) "Cannabinoid Receptor Localization in Brain,"
Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 87:1932-1936, 1990. pg.
1935.

<P>Marijuana And  Known Drugs of Abuse:  "The effects of cannabinoids on
dopamine circuits thought to be common mediators of reward are indirect and
different from those drugs such as cocaine and morphine which directly
affect extracellular dopamine levels and produce craving and powerful
drug-seeking behavior." Herkenham, M. (1992), "Cannabinoid Receptor
Localization in Brain:  Relationship to Motor and Reward Systems,"  P.W.
Kalivas and H.H.Samson (eds), The Neurobiology of Drug and Alcohol
Addiction, Annals of the American Academy of Sciences.  654:19-32, 1992.
pg. 29

<P>Note:  Dopamine-based craving is believed to be neural mechanism
responsible for the phenomenon of denial, in which someone with a drug
dependency has strong urges to deny their dependency, and engage in all
sorts of fictions and escapades to maintain their supply and intake of a
drug. The accounts of patients who have used marijuana medically are often
dismissed on suspicion that these anecdotal accounts are motivated more by
drug dependency than therapeutic benefits.  The distinction noted above is
evidence that this sort of denial is not an element in patient accounts of
the therapeutic benefits of marijuana.

<P>Tolerance to Marijuana : "The magnitude of the present effect, like the
striking behavioral tolerance, may stem in part that, unlike other
psychoactive agonist drugs, cannabinoids can be administered in very high
doses.  It is ironic that the magnitude of both tolerance (complete
disappearance of the inhibitory motor effect) and receptor down-regulation
(78% loss . . .) is so large, whereas cannabinoid dependence and withdrawal
phenomena are minimal.  This supports the claim that tolerance and
dependence are independently mediated in the brain."  Oviedo, A., Glowa, J,
and Herkenham, M. (1993), "Chronic cannabinoid administration alters
cannabinoid receptor binding in rat brain: a quantitative autoradiographic
study." Brain Research, 616:293-302. pg. 300.

<P>Marijuana and Immunosuppression:  "In humans, immune suppression is subtle
and in many cases insignificant.  There is little evidence for cannabinoid
immunosuppression as a causative agent in disease."  Lynn, A.B., and
Herkenham, M. (1993) "Localization of Cannabinoid Receptors and
Nonsaturable High-Density Cannabinoid Binding Sites in Peripheral Tissues
of the Rat:  Implications for Receptor-Mediated Immune Modulation by
Cannabinoids"  Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics, 268:3
1612-1623. pg. 1620.

<P>The Cannabinoid Receptor System Discovery Explains Why Cannabinoids Have
Medical Value:  "Dense binding in the basal ganglia and cerebellum suggests
cannabinoid involvement in movement control . . . Anticonvulsant and
antiemetic effects of cannabinoids have therapeutic value.  The
localization of cannabinoid receptors in motor areas suggests additional
therapeutic applications.  Cannabinoids exacerbate hypokinesia in Parkinson
disease but are beneficial for some forms of dystonia, tremor, and
spasticity."  Herkenham, M., Lynn, A.B., et al., (1990) "Cannabinoid
Receptor Localization in Brain,"  Proceedings of the National Academy of
Sciences, 87:1932-1936, 1990. pg. 1936.

<P>Before 1989, Theories Substituted for Facts About Marijuana's Mechanism of
Action :  "Because the cellular and biochemical mechanisms of action of
psychoactive cannabinoids were not understood, neuroscientists were allowed
great breadth to speculate upon the influence that these compounds might
have on the neurons of the brain." Howlett, A.C., Bidaut-Russell, M,
Devane, W., Melvin, L., Johnsons, M., & Herkenham, M.,  "The Cannabinoid
Receptor:  Biochemical, anatomical, and behavioral characterization."
Trends in Neuroscience  13:10, 420-423. 1990. pg. 420.

<P>Before 1989, Studies which Caused Some Scientists Alarm Were Based on
Faulty Research: "Most of the biochemical studies employed concentrations
of Delta-9-THC that were in excess of physiologically meaningful
concentrations that might be found in brain.  In addition, the criterion of
structure-activity relationship was not met -- that is, the potencies of
the various cannabinoids in the in vitro  assays did not correlate with
their relative potencies in eliciting characteristic behavioral effects.
Particularly damaging to the relevance of these in vitro studies was the
absence of enantioselectivity."  Herkenham, M. (1992), "Cannabinoid
Receptor Localization in Brain:  Relationship to Motor and Reward Systems,"
P.W. Kalivas and H.H. Samson (eds.), The Neurobiology of Drug and Alcohol
Addiction, Annals of the American Academy of Sciences.  654:19-32, 1992.
pg. 19.

<P>Before 1989, All Sorts of Research on Cannabinoids Was Conducted Because No
One Knew How they Worked on the Brain:   "Until recently, very little was
known about the cellular mechanisms through which cannabinoids act . .
.Without evidence that cannabinoids act through a specific receptor coupled
to a functional effector system, researchers were prone to study the
effects of cannabinoids on membrane properties, membrane-bound enzymes,
eicosanoid production, metabolism, and other neurotransmitter systems in
vitro." Herkenham, M. (1992), "Cannabinoid Receptor Localization in Brain:
Relationship to Motor and Reward Systems,"  P.W. Kalivas and H.H. Samson
(eds.), The Neurobiology of Drug and Alcohol Addiction, Annals of the
American Academy of Sciences.  654:19-32, 1992. pg. 19.
