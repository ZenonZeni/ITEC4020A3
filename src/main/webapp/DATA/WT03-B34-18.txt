California board wants 10% sales of zero-
emission autos in 2003

     The controversial California 2% zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) 
sales mandate for 1998 was officially scrapped late last month by 
the California Air Resources Board (CARB) in favor of an 
alternative plan that would instead require that 10% of new car 
sales be ZEVs by 2003.
     This latest development adds a bit of clarity to California's ZEV 
plans, but clouds an already murky picture for the immediate future 
of ZEVs in states that have adopted the California Low-Emission 
Vehicle (LEV) plan -- including ZEV mandates -- under authority of 
the Clean Air Act Amendments (CAAA), with New York and 
Massachusetts being the largest.
     Yet the move was hardly a surprise, since CARB had told its 
staff in November to develop an alternative, "market-based" plan 
that did not include the 1998 mandate for ZEVs that the board 
concluded are not "technologically competitive with gasoline-
powered vehicles at this time."
     Right now, electric vehicles (EVs) are the only ones that qualify 
as ZEVs.
     The CARB staff is charged with submitting a final plan for board 
approval no later than March.
     Environmentalists, who initially offered faint support for the 
mandate roll-back in November when CARB Chairman John Dunlap 
said emissions reductions would not lessen and a 5% sales mandate 
due in 2001 would go forth, are now charging the board with caving 
in to political pressure from Gov. Pete Wilson and the estimated 
$24 million media campaign and legislative lobbying launched by 
the Big Three automakers and oil companies against the plan.
     "We have seen no scientific or technical reason to delay [the 
mandate]," said Tim Carmichael of the Coalition for Clean Air. 
"The agency responsible for worldwide adoption of catalytic 
converters, unleaded gasoline and reformulated gasoline has never 
before buckled to political pressure."
     But CARB staff reviewing the technological feasibility of 
introducing EVs on such a large scale in 1998 found that the driving 
range before recharging would be too low and the cost too high to 
attract the needed consumers for the amount of cars that had to be 
sold.
     By abandoning the mandate, CARB officials said, they would 
avoid poisoning the market for the next generation of EVs that 
would meet consumer expectations at a reasonable cost.
     "This plan provides for a [future] successful launch of 
commercially viable electric cars," said Dunlap.
     Automobile experts called the proposal a practical move.

Carmakers still not happy

     In its preliminary assessment, the board found that by 2010, 
when technology is more advanced and mass production reduces 
cost, automakers would be able to successfully sell 10% of their 
fleet as EVs.
     Environmentalists think that could happen sooner.
     "This is inconsistent with the conclusions of the independent 
battery panel that called for strong requirements beginning with the 
year 2000 in order to maintain research and investment," said 
Roland Hwang of the Union of Concerned Scientists.
     Under the original proposal, there would have been around 
60,000 ZEVs on the road by 2000. CARB's preliminary proposal 
now only calls for two demonstration projects in Sacramento and 
Los Angeles that require only 3,750 ZEVs between 1998 and 2000.
     The original plan also called for the 10% mandate to go into 
effect in 2004, not 2003 as now proposed.
     Although seemingly the victors in what has been a contentious 
fight among automakers, regulators and environmentalists, the 
automotive industry issued hesitant praise for the plan.
     Said Chrysler, "the pull ahead of the 10% mandate timing from 
2004 to 2003 ... will risk the launch of EV technology."
     And Ford called CARB's acknowledgement that the 1998 
mandate will not work "positive," but that CARB's new proposal 
"leaves many important questions unanswered and lacks needed 
details. There is still much to be clarified before we can endorse 
this proposal."
     The preliminary proposal presented by CARB -- and still subject 
to revision -- is to drop the 2% requirement in 1998 and to "ramp 
up" to 10% ZEVs by 2003, when all car companies that sell more 
than 3,000 vehicles per year statewide must comply (GM, Ford, 
Chrysler, Toyota, Nissan, Honda and Mazda).
     Manufacturers will also receive ZEV credit through 2003 for EVs 
sold before 1998 and through 2010 and those equipped with 
advanced battery types, including lithium and nickel-based designs, 
which are expected to be available commercially by 2001.
     Right now, the lead-acid batteries are the only ones available 
commercially but provide limited ranges, around 60 miles.
CARB asks carmakers to promote ZEVs 
     Other proposals call for manufacturers to agree to a "Cal/Big 7" 
Technology Development Partnership through a memorandum of 
agreement that includes the following stipulations:
     ** All vehicle manufacturer-supported media, publicity and 
legislative initiatives against the ZEV program would be converted 
to media, publicity and legislative initiatives in support of the ZEV 
program.
     ** Voluntary introduction of ZEVs on a graduated scale until 
1998.
     ** From 1998 through 2002, manufacturers would achieve the 
loss in emissions reductions as a result of the mandate roll-back by 
the production of cleaner gasoline-powered cars.
     ** ZEVs should be placed in the Los Angeles and Sacramento 
basins in the following numbers: 750 in 1998, 1500 in 1999 and 
1500 in 2000 (without credits applied). 
     ** Extra ZEV credits would be provided for longer-range 
vehicles and pre-1998 vehicles.
     ** Manufacturers would commit to continue ZEV research and 
development.
     ** The state would purchase some advanced battery vehicles 
each year.
     ** Ongoing review process with annual reports.
     Northeast states in legal limbo
     The California LEV program, including the 2% sales mandate 
for EVs, was adopted in 1990 prior to enactment of the CAAA.
     Congress included the California LEV as an alternative for 
states to adopt in their State Implementation Plans (SIPs) under the 
CAAA in lieu of the federal vehicle emissions reduction plan.
     New York and Massachusetts chose the California LEV plan as 
part of their state SIPs as has Vermont and Maine, including 1998 
EV mandates. The Northeast Ozone Transport Commission (OTC), 
comprising the 12 states of the Northeast and the District of 
Columbia, also opted for the California LEV with a modified EV 
provision allowing individual states to elect whether to impose an 
EV mandate or not.
     Now that California is altering its plan as to ZEV mandates, the 
legal issue of whether those states must make similar changes is 
being debated.
     A Massachusetts air policy official said that Gov. William Weld 
was "very disappointed" by CARB's action but would not let it 
affect his state's intent on continuing forward with its mandate.
     New York Gov. George Pataki has also dismissed the possibility 
of changes in the California program affecting New York's mandate.
     However, attorneys general in both states are researching 
whether a change in the California plan automatically changes their 
plan under the CAAA. Under federal law, the California plan was 
meant to be the strictest of the two choices for states: California 
LEV and a federal LEV. With changes in that plan, Massachusetts 
and New York would have the strictest of three possible plans and 
officials worry whether they could maintain such a standard since 
the CAAA forbids a "third vehicle" standard.
     Also adding confusion to the dilemma is the ongoing, but now 
on-hold, talks among the OTC states, including New York and 
Massachusetts, automakers and the Environmental Protection 
Agency (EPA) to develop a so-called "49-State," or National LEV 
(NLEV), vehicle plan for all states outside of California. A major 
obstacle to an agreement in those talks is automakers' steadfast 
refusal to accept individual state adoption of EV mandates.
     The CARB proposal, sources say, definitely will complicate 
those talks further, or at least until after March, when the CARB 
plan is finalized, and the tangled legal issues can be resolved. 
     However, the deadline for the states to submit their 
implementation plans for the OTC LEV is February 15. The 
automotive industry will more than likely file lawsuits to stop such 
plans once the California LEV is completed.

N.J. first state to sign  on to 49-state LEV

     New Jersey is the first state to officially sign on to the National 
Low-Emission Vehicle (NLEV), or 49-State, plan proposed by the 
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the automotive 
industry as a replacement for the Northeast Ozone Transport 
Commission (OTC) LEV.
     OTC officials have been negotiating with EPA and automakers 
to develop the NLEV program for almost a year to replace the OTC 
LEV, a slightly modified version of California's strict LEV plan, 
approved last year.
     However, those talks have been stalled over carmakers' 
objections to a provision advocated by several OTC members that 
individual states could implement electric vehicle (EV), or zero-
emission vehicle (ZEV), sales mandates.
     New York and Massachusetts, along with Vermont and Maine, 
have adopted 2% ZEV sales mandates.
     The NLEV plan would affect all states outside of California, not 
just the 12 Northeast states, including the District of Columbia, of 
the OTC. EPA has endorsed the program as a way of achieving 
emissions reductions nationwide, not just in the Northeast.
     However, the plan would call for cleaner gasoline-powered 
vehicles gradually introduced through the next decade and would 
not dictate the introduction of advanced-technology vehicle 
mandates in set years as the OTC LEV plan calls for.
     States that have already adopted plans that include mandates for 
introducing EVs have argued to keep them. Automakers have been 
steadfast in refusing any technological mandates, especially for 
EVs.
     OTC has already adopted, and EPA has approved, the modified 
California LEV as a backstop should NLEV talks break down.
     New Jersey, in endorsing the NLEV, also retained the right to 
implement the OTC LEV should NLEV fail to succeed.

Nickel-hydride battery to double range of 
GM's electronic vehicle 

     Nickel-hydride batteries will soon power General Motors Corp.'s 
electronic vehicles (EV) and more than double the mileage of the 
initial line of cars that will be introduced in California and Arizona 
this fall, said the president of the company that developed the 
battery.
      Earlier this month GM announced it will introduce the EV-1 
"Impact" this fall with a lead-acid battery giving the car a range of 
60 to 70 miles (TER 1/8, p. 2).
     However, GM plans to install a nickel-hydride battery in the EV-
1 as soon as the battery is available in production quantities, said 
Fubhash Dhar, head of Ovonic Battery Co. of Troy, Mich. "The 
range of the car will be more than double to well over 200 miles," 
with the nickel-hydride battery, Dhar said.
     Ovonic has a joint venture with GM to produce the nickel-
hydride battery. 
     Dhar said the nickel-hydride battery will be installed in the EV-1 
"immediately after the initial introduction [of the EV-1] is done," 
but he declined to give a date, because he said GM has not made 
that public.
     The nickel-hydride battery will be installed in the electronic 
version of the S-10 Chevrolet pickup truck as well, Dhar said. This 
vehicle is scheduled to be built in a Shreveport, La., plant 
beginning in 1997, according to GM's prior announcement.
     Chrysler officials had no comment on the deployment date  for 
the nickel-hydride battery, but a spokesman for GM's EV program 
referred to remarks Robert Purcell Jr., executive director of GM 
Electric Vehicles, made earlier this month at the Los Angeles and 
Detroit auto shows.
     "We are continuing aggressive development work on the 
advanced nickel-metal hydride battery through our GM Ovonic 
venture, and we are encouraged by the progress we are making," 
Purcell said. "We hope to have these batteries available as an 
option for both vehicles (the EV-1 and S-10) when the technology is 
ready. The battery technologies will be interchangeable, allowing 
the customer to select the battery that will best meet their driving 
requirements."
     The nickel-hydride battery will cost more than the lead-acid 
battery, the GM spokesman said, but would not give a price range.
     The California Air Resources Board (CARB) has extensively 
reviewed vehicle technologies to set air quality regulations. A 
CARB spokesperson said the board's battery panel assessed battery 
technologies and estimated the introduction of the nickel-hydride 
battery as early as next year on GM vehicles is plausible.
     Initially, the cars will be sold through 25 Saturn dealerships in 
Los Angeles, San Diego, Phoenix and Tucson, Ariz.

SCEcorp to lease, sell, install charge 
systems for EVs in California

     SCEcorp has announced a partnership with General Motors Corp. 
to lease, sell and service charging systems and provide installation 
services for GM EV customers starting next fall in Los Angeles.
     SCEcorp created a new company, Edison EV, to distribute 
vehicle chargers that can be installed in home garages and 
businesses. GM's Delco Electronics unit makes the chargers. 
SCEcorp is the parent company of electric utility company Southern 
California Edison.
     Edison EV will install chargers for EV customers throughout 
California, working with other utilities that have fleets of electronic 
vehicles. Edison EV also plans to arrange with other automobile 
makers to sell chargers for vehicles too, when Ford, Chrysler and 
other makers put their EVs on the market.
     SCE Corp. is promoting the EV market because it expects an 
additional demand on its system of 5 billion kilowatt-hours a year 
by 2010 to charge EVs.
     Other utilities also are getting into the business of distributing 
GM's charging systems, including Virginia Power Co., but so far 
fleets of electric vehicles belonging to the utility companies are the 
recipients.

DOE considers an executive order to 
implement federal AFV purchases

     Alternative fuel vehicle (AFV) proponents are supporting an 
Energy Dept. proposed executive order directing federal agencies to 
adhere to Energy Policy Act (EPACT) AFV mandates by paying for 
them out of their own budgets.
     EPACT directs that 25% of 1996 federal fleet purchases be 
AFVs. But Congress stripped DOE of the $20 million it requested 
this year to help federal agencies meet that requirement. And AFV 
supporters believe that many agencies will not purchase the 
vehicles without DOE funding.
     Following the budget blow at DOE for AFVs, and hits other 
departments and agencies took, officials have been in limbo over 
how to meet the EPACT requirements.
     DOE officials believe the executive order, if approved by the 
White House, would be the only way to satisfy the law.
Private fleets still waiting on rule
     On another AFV front, private fuel-provider fleet purchasers are 
still awaiting a DOE rule on their responsibility to buy AFVs under 
EPACT after the department let lapse the Sept. 1, 1995, deadline 
for issuing the fleet purchase rule.
     A "delayed implementation" was expected sometime before 
Christmas. The rule has apparently been held up at the Office of 
Management and Budget (OMB), the administrative agency that 
looks at federal rulemakings with an eye to their costs.
     Some sources, though, doubt the White House will release 
anything at this point and instead sit on the rule for as long as 
possible. 
     Doing so would accomplish two things -- it would effectively 
delay the rule, while at the same time allowing DOE to avoid 
taking a position that would upset either industry or 
environmentalists. 
     "There is a rumor going around that the political trouble [Energy 
Secretary] Hazel O'Leary is in has played a part in the delay," one 
source said. "While she is under a lot of heat, it's going to be harder 
for her to take on a politically unpopular issue."
     The fleet-provider rule is a loser for DOE whatever O'Leary 
decides, the source noted.
     One of the stickier points in the proposed rule is how far DOE 
will stretch the definition of "fuel provider." Will it go all the way 
to companies that extract the crude product from the ground? Or 
will it be tightly defined to include only those companies that are 
directly related to the final product?
     "If Secretary O'Leary comes out with something that is a little 
more pro-industry, the environmentalists are going to scream," he 
said. "But the oil patch would go berserk if producers got defined as 
fuel providers -- there would be this huge hue and cry in Dallas and 
Houston and that's not what they need."
     Another source suggested that by not filing a lawsuit and calling 
DOE's hand, the AFV industry is not forcing the issue. That makes 
it easier for DOE to delay things indefinitely.
     "There hasn't been a lawsuit yet that I've seen, and that sort of 
plays into DOE's hands," said a source in the AFV industry. "If this 
gets taken to court, that at least forces DOE to deal with us."
     Jeff Clarke, counsel to the American Gas Assn., said he still 
expects DOE to come out shortly with a delayed rule, with the 
implementation date pushed back to Sept. 1, 1996.       
     "I understand there are people at DOE who are pushing it and 
want it out as soon as possible," Clarke said.
     "Our only disappointment is that it's going to be delayed," 
Clarke added. "I'm sure with the budget talks they have higher 
priorities." 
     Many in the industry are "very frustrated" with DOE's failure to 
release a rule in a more timely fashion.
     "We already know there's going to be a delay," said an industry 
official. "The biggest issue is can you supplant a medium- or heavy-
duty vehicle for a light vehicle" and get a credit. 
     "It's really distressing to see what's been happening in that 
arena," said Jason Smitherman, state alternative fuels director in 
Oklahoma. "I know I would be in trouble if I had a rule to 
implement and it took me three years."

NYMEX panel selects coal specifications 
and delivery points for coal futures

     An advisory subcommittee assembled by the New York 
Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) has tentatively selected initial 
coal  specifications and delivery points for its first ever coal futures 
contract. This one would cover Central Appalachian coal.
     NYMEX has futures in crude oil, heating oil, gasoline, natural 
gas, propane and even electricity in its energy trading activity, and 
is now seeking to establish coal futures. Setting standards for 
commodity trading of this fossil fuel is a challenge because of the 
varying types and qualities of coal.
     Emphasizing that the specs and points selections are tentative, 
sources said NYMEX's Coal Delivery Subcommittee decided to 
recommend a contract for a steam coal containing 12,000 Btu/lb, -
1% sulfur and no more than 14% ash. 
     The delivery point would be in a region that includes 10 coal 
terminals on the Big Sandy River and five or six terminals on the 
Ohio River between the mouth of the Big Sandy and Huntington, 
W.Va. The advantage offered by this region is the abundance of the 
above-specified coal and the multiple modes of getting coal to the 
river (truck, CSX Transportation and Norfolk Southern Railway). 
     These tentative recommendations were made at a December 
meeting of the subcommittee, which convenes again this month.
     The panel of about 40 coal and utility executives did not have 
time to discuss initial parameters for a contract for sub-bituminous 
coal from the Powder River Basin (PRB), but that discussion is 
planned.
     A NYMEX spokesperson emphasized the preliminary nature of 
the recommendations and the many layers of approval required for 
developing a contract. Further discussions could alter early 
decisions, the spokesperson stressed.
     In a 15-page, Dec. 7 memo to subcommittee members, NYMEX 
officials Karen Klitzman, Brian Johnson and Jay Gottlieb outlined 
what they saw as the key questions which must be settled in order 
to write effective PRB and Central Appalachian coal futures 
contracts. Aside from primary quality specs and delivery points, 
these included whether pricing should be expressed in dollars per 
ton or cents per million Btus. Apparently the subcommittee 
recommended a cents/mmBtu formula.

Definitions of coal quality also mulled

     In addition, according to one source, the subcommittee decided 
to drop secondary coal specs, including moisture, grind, volatile 
matter, ash softening temperature, fixed carbon and size. There was 
also a recommendation that premiums and penalties not be 
associated with the contract. Apparently the subcommittee is urging 
NYMEX to adopt a generic coal with as few specs as possible, 
thereby avoiding the inherent limitations associated with coal's 
numerous quality parameters.  
     In the memo NYMEX underlined several points for 
understanding delivery of a physical commodity in satisfaction of a 
futures contract. For example, "only a small percentage of contracts 
traded for each delivery month actually result in delivery, typically 
less than 1%. All other contractual obligations are offset by opposite 
trades which close out the original position ... It is precisely this 
ability to easily enter into a position and then liquidate it without 
having to return to one's original counterpart in the transaction that 
is one of the great advantages of future contracts as risk 
management tools."

Delivery ensures accuracy

     While most people use futures as financial instruments for 
"price discovery" and risk management, the memo states, "the 
actuality of deliveries for each contract month helps insure what is 
called convergence of cash and futures markets. In other words, 
delivery ensures that the futures market is an accurate reflection of 
prices for the physical commodity ... The futures contract must 
accurately model typical cash market transactions."
     The standardized formal futures contract specifies quality, 
delivery mode, destination and all other terms except price and 
quantity (number of contracts). "This is what makes possible the 
provision of price transparency and risk management tools."
     While "there has never been a delivery performance failure on 
NYMEX contracts," the Exchange nevertheless has rules to be 
applied in the event of a failure. Futures contracts for particular 
commodities define what constitutes late performance, failure to 
perform and force majeure.

Benchmark provides many benefits 

     Coal is the only energy commodity which has not developed "a 
specific grade of product that is designated as the par value grade 
and is used as a benchmark to gauge spot market value," the 
NYMEX memo observed.
     A benchmark grade of coal could be used in several ways, such 
as adjusting a supply contract price that is related to a market 
sensitive number, NYMEX argues.
     While some critics have said futures will not work in coal 
because coal is not an homogenous commodity, NYMEX believes 
coal can be subjected to the same benchmark criteria applied to oil 
and pork bellies. According to NYMEX, these include:
     ** The commodity should be readily available.
     ** There should be significant proven reserves.
     ** There should be a diversity of buyers and sellers.
     ** Wide acceptability by consumers.
     ** Transportation access is readily available.
     ** The willingness of the trade press to survey the market on the 
value of the benchmark.
     ** Ability to standardize.
     "Consistency of transportation costs for a buyer receiving coal 
from any possible delivery facility within the designated delivery 
area is critical," the NYMEX memo continues. "This requirement 
sets the upper limit to the size of the delivery area. The objective is 
to find a delivery area that is easily accessible to adequate supplies 
of coal, with consistent transportation costs and sufficient 
transportation facility flexibility to prevent bottlenecks."
     At least tentatively, the advisory subcommittee seems to 
believe that the Huntington/Big Sandy region satisfies this latter 
requirement.

Utilities link two-way communications with 
customers on interactive systems 

     The trend toward smart homes and businesses is accelerating 
rapidly.
     Several utilities announced deals with telecom, cable, data 
service and electronic marketing companies last week to establish 
electronic communications links with electric and gas customers.
     First there are the big commercial customer ventures of telecom 
giant AT&T in New York and Newark. But while that could become 
the biggest marketing effort, Enova Corp. in Southern California is 
reaching out to touch customers in their homes and integrate utility 
choice into the daily lives of thousands of people via home 
computer. 
     AT&T announced a partnership with Consolidated Edison Jan. 
16 to develop a two-way communications system for customers in 
New York City where Con Ed is headquartered.
     AT&T also started similar ventures with two other utilities in 
Newark, N.J., and Louisville, Ky., and more utility partnerships are 
expected as AT&T plans to market the interactive products to 
utilities worldwide. The company has organized the AT&T Utility 
Solutions division in Whippany, N.J., to push the deals.
     Con Ed and AT&T will install the first of the "Integrated 
Broadband Utility Solution" systems in about 100 businesses 
beginning in April. The term "broadband" refers to the large amount 
of information that will be sent through coaxial cable.
     With the communication system the utility will be able to 
inform customers of special time-of-day pricing, new rate plans, 
special conditions because of cold or hot weather and other 
information and get customer responses to the offerings and 
conditions, an AT&T spokesperson said.
     Devices will be placed on each appliance or piece of 
electricity-using equipment. A box called an "interface unit" will 
gather the information from each device via telephone lines in the 
building and route it to the utility offices.
     Services will include power-quality monitoring, real-time 
pricing, load profiling, customer-controlled load management and 
other interactive services. Advanced networks will be customized 
for hospitals, banks, hotels, office buildings and other large 
customers. However, smaller commercial buildings, such as 
restaurants and supermarkets, will be offered an array of new 
services.
     AT&T said its system provides utilities and their customers 
automated meter reading, remote outage detection, remote control 
to turn power on and off, real-time load management, tamper 
detection and distribution automation.
     Services that also can be included are condition monitoring 
reports on equipment or appliances, power quality monitoring, 
energy pricing, electronic billing, home security, medical alert 
systems, and "what if" calculations of power supply and use 
alternatives.
     AT&T said residential and commercial customers will be able 
to program their appliances to run at times which minimize energy 
costs.
     Last November AT&T announced it was teaming with Louisville 
Gas & Electric Co. (LG&E) to introduce two-way communications 
between utilities and customers. LG&E's goal is to build interactive 
customer communications systems for its 345,000 electric and 
270,000 natural gas customers in Louisville and 16 Kentucky 
counties. Last fall LG&E began working with TKR Cable of Greater 
Louisville to build a fiber optic network for a two-way system and 
signed similar agreements with other access providers for 
communications links. 
     A year ago AT&T announced an agreement with Public Service 
Electric and Gas (PSEG) of New Jersey (PSE&G) to eventually 
deploy the two-way system to 500,000 customers. The partners have 
nearly connected the first 1,000 PSE&G customers.
Contacting utilities through home computer
     While AT&T has bitten into the Big Apple market, on the 
Pacific Coast, Enova Corp. is making it possible for customers to 
select utility options on home computers in addition to home 
shopping, and other computer services.
     Enova, parent company of San Diego Gas and Electric, 
announced Jan. 17 a joint venture between its subsidiary, Enova 
Technologies and Philips Home Services of Burlington, Mass., to 
provide a consumer-based electronic commerce network that 
integrates utility management along with electronic banking, home 
shopping and other computer services.
     Customers will be able to pay their utility bills, check real-time 
prices of electricity (assuming a competitive market develops), 
automate electrical appliances and screen phone calls.
     "This venture brings the utility and consumer electronics 
industries together for the first time," said Gerrit Schipper, president 
of Philips, in a prepared statement.
     Initially 30,000 phones will be hooked up in San Diego. Philips 
already provides systems for customer access to banks, phone 
companies and other businesses.
     The companies envision the system will reach 500,000 
customers in San Diego and Orange counties and from there 
national marketing will be launched.

Wisconsin Energy hits mid-U.S. market 

     In the Midwest, Ameritech Corp. and Wisconsin Energy Corp. 
announced Jan. 15 they formed a company called Energy Oasys to 
market a new utility automation system for homes and businesses in 
Wisconsin Electric Power Co.'s (WEP) Milwaukee service area and 
to other utilities. WEP is a subsidiary of Wisconsin Energy, a 
holding company. WEP has tested the Oasys system in 15 prototype 
homes and is installing it in 200 homes in Milwaukee. Installations 
will be made in 5,000 homes this year. Oasys costs the utility 
company between $1,000 and $1,500 a home.
     The system has modular open architecture that will allow other 
utility companies to assemble and expand the systems as they see 
fit.
     The system allows meters to be read automatically, provides 
remote power connection and disconnection, and has security 
features for meter tampering and power outage detection.
     In the future, Oasys will provide utility companies with the 
capability to offer customers programmed control of security 
systems, lighting, irrigation systems, indoor air quality, pool heating 
and other features, the utility promises.
     The system is designed to be networked over power lines and 
used in telephone networks, fiber optics, coaxial and other media.
     Ameritech is a communications company with more than 13 
million telephone, cellular, paging, data and video service 
customers in the United States and overseas.
     Meanwhile, in a business link between companies from opposite 
ends of the United States, Duquesne Light Co. of Pittsburgh 
announced its "Customer Advanced Reliability System" will be 
installed during the next two years to provide real-time information 
about the status of power delivery to individual homes and 
businesses in Pennsylvania.
     Itron Inc. of Spokane, Wash., a supplier of energy 
communications systems to the utility industry, will begin installing 
the network in February or March for Duquesne to provide the 
communications link with 580,000 customers in Allegheny and 
Beaver counties. Itron will have the installation completed next 
year and has a contract to service the system for 15 years.
     Customers' use of the system will be sent electronically to a 
utility control center so customer service personnel know the status 
of power delivery across the system for individual customers. The 
system will automatically report the time and location of power 
outages to speed restoration.       Customers in turn will be able to 
request electric service to start or stop around the clock. Meters will 
be read from the control center without the need to have meter 
readers enter homes.
     Customers will choose which day of the month to pay their bills. 
And the system will enable the utility to define a daily profile of 
electricity usage of each customer. 
     This will provide the utility with the ability to track more 
effectively electric power load growth so that higher capacity 
distribution equipment can be provided.
     Customers eventually will be able to signal their choice of 
power supplier.
     At Con Ed, John Arceri, vice president of energy services, 
summed up some of the reasons for all of this. "We'll make 
available to our customers the tools they need to manage more 
efficiently and to reduce their energy and operating costs. In turn 
Con Edison will be able to avoid costly system upgrades."
     However, an even more important motive is profit. As utilities 
are driven to cut costs in a commodity-driven market for low-priced 
power, they are looking for ways to provide services so they can 
charge more money. Value added services will help the more 
innovative utilities survive and prosper in a cut-rate energy market.

Senate, House energy leaders disagree on 
need for full deregulation bill

     Sen. Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska, chairman of the Senate 
Energy and Natural Resources Committee, said congressional 
action to require states to open the electricity market to retail 
wheeling isn't appropriate.
     "I am a strong advocate of states' rights, and states' 
responsibilities," Murkowski said in a recent speech before the 
Edison Electric Institute (EEI). "States should take the lead on 
restructuring issues. Traditionally they have regulated the bulk of 
electric utility activities, and it should remain that way. For 
example, retail wheeling has been and should continue to be a state 
issue, not a federal matter."
     That puts key members of the House and Senate on opposing 
sides on the need for prompt congressional action in opening the 
electricity industry to full-scale competition.
     Rep. Dan Schaefer, R-Colo., chairman of the House Commerce 
Committee's subcommittee on energy and power, plans quick 
action on a comprehensive deregulation bill that he is still putting 
together.
     Schaefer told EEI that he will "resume hearings immediately 
and move legislation early this year.
     "I have one goal and only one goal in putting together the 
legislation that I assure you I will move out of my subcommittee 
this year," he said. "I want all the benefits of competition to go to 
all customers -- not just the largest users -- as soon as possible."
     However, he still has not decided what the bill should contain 
and is "open-minded" about "how best to achieve that goal."
     Schaefer disputed EEI claims that "the states are doing a fine 
job and there is no need for federal action."
     "If EEI is being honest about leaving this to the states to decide, 
then you must agree with me that -- at the very minimum -- federal 
legislation is needed this year to remove federal barriers to 
competition and to give the states the tools they need to pursue 
competition," he said.
     But Murkowski framed the debate in terms of restructuring and 
reducing the role of the federal government. "The result will 
determine whether Washington will continue to tax more, spend 
more, regulate more and control more ... or whether we will begin to 
reduce the size, scope and power of Washington."
     "Electricity is far too important to consumers, industry and our 
economy to toy with," Murkowski said. "In 1992 Congress [through 
the Energy Policy Act] made major legislative changes to promote 
competition," he continued.      "So far those changes appear to be 
working and working relatively well," Murkowski said. "There are 
some who are unhappy at the pace of change; they think it too slow. 
But the pace of change is not as important as the results of change."
     Murkowski said the marketplace, Federal Energy Regulatory 
Commission and the states should be given an opportunity to move 
the industry toward competition. "Neither you nor I could stop the 
rush to competition even if we wanted to," he said.
     One industry source noted Schaefer has more jurisdiction over 
electricity issues than Murkowski. Schaefer's committee has 
jurisdiction over the Public Utility Holding Company Act 
(PUHCA), while Murkowski's committee does not.
      But Murkowski said he is on the side of the majority of 
Republicans who want to reduce the size and scope of the federal 
government.
     "I have heard there may be some in the House -- even the 
Republican side of the House -- that are interested in expanding 
FERC's authority over electric utilities. They seem to be interested 
in preempting state public utility commissions and moving that 
authority to FERC. ... Given the ongoing efforts of the FERC and the 
states, it is premature to initiate a major legislative overhaul."
     Schaefer told the Rocky Mountain Oil & Gas Assn. that "the 
days of the electric monopoly -- the last great monopoly of our 
times -- seem to be numbered."
     In that speech, Schaefer acknowledged the stranded cost issue is 
the trickiest Congress will have to deal with in coming months.
     "Fairness dictates that utilities be given an opportunity to 
recover appropriate costs that cannot be mitigated," Schaefer said.
     "Because we are in the middle of the hearing process, I am not 
yet prepared to talk about what approach to competition or stranded 
costs I prefer," he said. "I can tell you, however, that my 
subcommittee will be moving legislation this year and that 
legislation will seek to bring the benefits of competition to all 
customers in a reasonable time frame."

FERC should get tougher on mergers; 
municipals and co-op groups say

      Associations representing 1,750 community owned electric 
utilities and 1,000 cooperatives filed a petition with the Federal 
Energy Regulatory Commission last week urging the regulators to 
apply stricter standards before approving mergers so utility 
combinations don't result in anti-competitive monopolies.
     Antitrust criteria must be applied to guard against market power, 
the National Rural Electric Cooperative Assn. and the American 
Public Power Assn. said in a joint petition to FERC.
     "Current regulatory standards for private power company 
mergers are obsolete and need to be rewritten to make competition 
the primary factor in a public interest review," the associations said 
in prepared remarks on the petition.
     The associations of community-owned electric utilities and non-
profit, consumer-owned cooperatives proposed a multi-part rule and 
a series of questions to evaluate proposed mergers of investor-owned 
utilities.

Conditions for mergers proposed

     The merger can be approved if anti-competitive effects are 
outweighed by efficiencies resulting from the merger in the form of 
savings and benefits, or if conditions can be imposed to mitigate 
anti-competition, the associations contended.
     But FERC should examine whether the claimed efficiencies can 
be achieved by means other than a merger.
     The regulators should codify that the merged companies must 
offer single-system transmission pricing unless there is a public 
interest reason for making an exception.
     FERC should evaluate whether functional unbundling is 
sufficient or whether operational or corporate unbundling as a 
standard condition for merger approval is necessary.
     The regulators also should consider standards to govern affiliate 
transactions.
     "FERC should reinterpret its standards in light of procompetitive 
legislation that has been passed by Congress ...," the associations 
said. "Mergers are a natural and frequently harmful method of 
forestalling competition."
     The filing expresses alarm at the accelerating pace of utility 
mergers, noting there have been 14 mergers proposed since the 
Energy Policy Act was enacted in 1992, including six proposed 
mergers in 1995.
     "Commission merger policy will determine whether its open 
access initiatives result in effective competition," the petition 
stated, "or whether these initiatives will be frustrated by utility 
combinations that echo domination by a few giant companies that 
prevailed during the holding company era of the late 1920s and 
early 1930s."

Southern tries to block TVA's move to sell 
power well outside its service area

     One of the nation's biggest investor-owned utilities holding 
companies has filed suit against the nation's largest government-
owned utility in an attempt to block it as a power marketing 
competitor.
     The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) has entered into power 
sales agreements with LG&E Power Marketing to illegally sell 
power outside of the authority's service area, claims a complaint 
filed by The Southern Co. in the U.S. District Court for the Northern 
District of Alabama.
     Atlanta-based Southern has filed a complaint on behalf of 
affiliates Alabama Power, Georgia Power and Mississippi Power 
charging TVA with violations of U.S. law that prohibit it from 
entering into contracts to sell, or deliver, power outside its 
statutorily limited service area. The three utilities claim TVA has 
made such deals with LG&E Power Marketing, which was hired by 
TVA last fall to procure power for the federal agency. LG&E is one 
of the top five power marketers in the nation.
     "In 1959, H.R. 3460 was introduced in Congress. As offered, the 
bill proposed to limit TVA's service area to 'counties lying in whole 
or in part within either the Tennessee River drainage basin or the 
service area in which power generated by the corporation is being 
used on July 1, 1957,'" the Southern affiliates claim. "After Senate 
and House committee deliberation, the legislation was amended to 
prohibit TVA's sale or delivery of power outside its service are as it 
exists as of July 1, 1957."
     The utilities contend the legislation, passed as the TVA Bond 
Act, included a provision that allowed TVA to swap power with 
neighboring utilities to meet temporary needs. But the U.S. Senate 
later amended the legislation to "prohibit TVA from being a source 
of power supply, either 'directly or indirectly,' outside its statutorily 
defined service area" because it was abusing that provision by 
selling power to unauthorized users via other utility systems, the 
holding company claims.   
     Southern's affiliates are asking the court to declare that TVA 
has violated the TVA Act by entering into an interchange 
agreement with LG&E Power Marketing, that the transactions 
contemplated under the agreement are unlawful and that TVA is 
prohibited from directly or indirectly selling or delivering power to 
any marketer or broker of power. 
     TVA said that "due to the pending litigation" it has no 
comment.
     LG&E Power contends it has the right to market TVA's power 
because it is affiliated with Louisville Gas & Electric and the 1959 
law created an exception for TVA energy exchanges to some 
neighboring utilities including LG&E.
     Southern counters that this power market deal is an attempt to 
circumvent statutory limits on TVA power sales and would allow 
sales far beyond the bounds intended by that 1959 exemption.
     Southern would like to sell its own wholesale power and has 
asked FERC to allow affiliate, Southern Electric Marketing Inc., to 
do that.

Pa. utility pushes for competition

     Pennsylvania Power & Light executives called for giving all 
Pennsylvania consumers the opportunity to choose their electricity 
supplier.
      Society demands choice and the electric utility industry in 
Pennsylvania must move forward to meet the expectations of 
consumers, Bill Hecht, the company's chairman
told the state Public Utilities Commission (PUC). The dramatic 
difference in rates among utilities has created a perception that the 
current structure is unfair, Hecht said.
     State regulators are conducting an investigation into electric 
utility competition in Pennsylvania.
     Hecht said there are some principal issues that must be 
addressed in the transition to full customer choice: 
     ** The opportunity for all customers to be able to choose their 
electricity supplier.
     ** The ability for utilities to recover costs incurred because of 
the requirements of federal or state regulation.
     ** The development of a system to ensure the continuation of 
reliable electricity service.
     Fred Hafer, president of Metropolitan Edison and Pennsylvania 
Electric, has his own plan for competition that includes the creation 
of a power pool. However, utilities with high rates would be on their 
own and would not be permitted to sell or buy in the pool under his 
plan.
     William Mowatt, president of the Pennsylvania Rural Electric 
Assn., urged the commission to consider allowing utilities 100% 
recovery of their stranded costs, possibly by charging customers an 
exit fee for leaving a utility system. The PUC earlier considered 
such a fee illegal.

Coal industry study says EPA's NOx plan 
could cost utilities billions

     The National Mining Assn. (NMA) released last week a new 
study that represents the coal industry's latest assault on some NOx-
control rules being contemplated for utility power plants in 37 
states.
     The study was done by the consulting firm Energy Ventures 
Analysis (EVA), and looks at what it would cost to extend the rules 
already adopted in the 12-state Northeast Ozone Transport area to 
25 other states extending west to the Rockies. Mandated NOx 
reductions under the proposal would be up to 75% below current 
emissions levels, the study claims.
     The EVA study says utilities would have to spend up to $27 
billion in capital equipment costs to meet the new rules, and up to 
$5.5 billion per year in operating costs. Higher electricity prices that 
would result from those costs would hamper economic development 
in much of the country, the study points out. A lot of coal-fired 
capacity could be prematurely retired in order to meet these 
standards.
     "The bottom line of the EVA study is higher electric rates, 
reduced economic development, fewer jobs and an expanded 
environmental bureaucracy," said NMA President Richard Lawson.

Oil's share of energy market drops to 30-
year low; 1995 imports decline

     Oil's share of the overall 1995 domestic energy market slipped 
under 40% for the first time in almost three decades with natural 
gas and nuclear power primarily claiming the loss.
     And for the first time in four years, total U.S. petroleum imports 
declined, though they still account for more than 50% of the 
country's demand, according to the American Petroleum Institute's 
(API) 1995 statistical report.
     While oil is still the largest source of energy used in the country 
at 39.7%, a drastic 17.1% drop in residual fuel -- heavy oil used to 
power utility boilers -- as a result of power suppliers switching to 
cheaper natural gas, erased any demand gains in other major oil 
products like gasoline, kerosene jet fuel, home heating oil and 
diesel fuel.
     Of that 17.1% drop in resid, the lowest since 1938, natural gas 
took a 40% share and nuclear power 25%, accounting for the 
greatest increases in energy use for the year. The highest share oil 
has ever claimed of total energy use was 48.7% in 1977.
     "It reflects a combination of reduced use of resid-fired peaking 
units and the availability of cheaper natural gas leading to a 
dramatic reduction in the use of this fuel in the electric utility and 
industrial sectors," said API's Ed Murphy.
     Domestic energy use reached a record high in 1995 at 87.6 
quadrillion Btus (quads), 2.2 quads BTU higher than it was in 1994, 
a 2.3% increase that is consistent with growth annually since 1992.

Natural Gas

     Natural gas accounted for just over one quarter of all energy 
used at 22.2 quads, according to API. Since its deregulation in 1986, 
natural gas has grown by 5.5 quads, or 33%. Of that amount, nearly 
2 quadrillion BTU has been supplied by new imports, primarily from 
Canada.
     Over one-half of the growth in natural gas consumption since 
deregulation has been in the industrial sector. But consumption of 
natural gas has yet to exceed 1972's 22.5 quads, which claimed 
over 30% of domestic energy use that year.

Nuclear Power

     Nuclear power production is estimated to have reached a record 
high in 1995 of 7.2 quads claiming an 8.3% share of total U.S. 
energy consumption. API said that higher utilization  of nuclear 
generating capacity pushed output since the number of operating 
plants has remained unchanged. Plants operated at 78% capacity 
last year compared to 70.5% in 1993.

Gasoline

     Despite slower growth in highway travel, gasoline deliveries 
were up 2.5% in 1995. But as states and localities opted out of the 
reformulated gasoline (RFG) program, RFG demand fell 20% below 
anticipated levels. API said that total gasoline demand for 1995 
appears to have increased to about 7.8 million b/d, nearly twice 
previous years amounts. But the industry association attributes this 
to enhanced reporting as a result of the RFG program.

Oil Production

     Domestic crude production declined at a significantly smaller 
rate than in recent years, API reported, but was still the lowest 
domestic production for any year since 1954. The reason for the 
modest decline is improved drilling efficiency and the lack of a 
significant jump in oil prices, which average between $16.50 and 
$20.00/barrel all year.
     Crude fell by 2.2%, or 140 thousand b/d, to less than 6.52 
million b/d for the year. The decline was evenly split between 
Alaska and the lower 48 states. Lower 48 production fell by 72 
thousand b/d, or 1.4%. For each of the previous three years, lower 
48 production has fallen by 3%. Increased offshore activity in the 
Gulf of Mexico was partially responsible for the reduced rate of 
decline since it grew by 80 to 100 thousand b/d over 1994 levels.
     Alaska production declined by 4.7%, to 1.49 million b/d, which 
is comparable to yearly decreases since 1991.

Drilling

     Oil, gas and dry hole well completions in 1995 declined 9.3% 
compared to 1994. A total of 19,756 wells were completed last year. 
In 1994, there were 21,793 completions. 
     The largest drop in completions occurred in natural gas wells. 
The 8,114 gas wells completed in 1995 was 14% less than the 9,439 
in 1994.
     Oil well completions fell 1.6% -- from 7,032 in 1994 to 6,917 in 
1995. Dry hole completions dropped 11.2% to 4,725 in 1995.
     Footage drilled decreased by 11.8% in 1995 to 113 million feet 
drilled in search of oil and gas.
     In 1995, 20.3% fewer exploratory wells were completed with gas 
wells declining the most at 32%, oil wells were down 20%

Hydropower

     API said that hydro-electrical power was the driving force 
behind increases in the "other" category. Hydro was up nearly 9% 
in 1995 over 1994 levels. API attributes the growth to higher levels 
of precipitation.

Imports

     Imported oil still claims more than 50% of the country's demand 
but fell for the first time in four years in 1995 by 1.3% because of 
weak demand and the more moderate decline in domestic crude 
production. Total imports of crude and oil products in 1995 averaged 
8.8 million b/d. But the decline came entirely in oil product imports, 
which fell 18%. Crude oil imports actually rose 3.2%.
Refinery
     Refinery utilization was 91.7% in 1995, compared with 92.6% in 
1994.

Stocks

     Total stocks (crude oil plus petroleum products) ended 1995 at 
their lowest level since 1972, falling almost 9% compared to 1994. 
Total stocks at the end of December stood at 968 million barrels.

Oil and Natural Gas

     While the percentage of the nation's energy supplied by liquid 
petroleum has fallen, the share of energy provided by oil and gas 
together has stayed roughly constant since 1985 at around 65%
     In 1973, oil and gas peaked at 57.3 quads -- more than three 
quarters of the energy consumer in the country. Consumption fell 
with the Arab oil embargo, recovered in the late 1970s, and fell 
again with higher oil prices in the early 1980s and the supply-
limiting effects of price controls on natural gas.
     The recent-year low for oil and natural gas consumption was 
1983 at 47.3 quads. In 1995, it was 57 quads. In the last 12 years, 
natural gas consumption has grown by 4.9 quads, slightly outpacing 
the 4.8 quads growth in oil consumption.
Coal
     API furnished no details on coal consumption. The U.S. doesn't 
import coal.

Exxon reaches partial settlement with 
underwriters in Valdez costs

     Exxon Corp. has reached a partial settlement of $300 million 
with Lloyds of London and other underwriters in what was originally 
a $1 billion claim to recover cleanup expenses from the 1989 Exxon 
Valdez oil tanker spill in Prince William Sound, Alaska.
     The insurance companies had contested the claim and refused to 
pay, saying the 11-million gallon spill was a result of Exxon's 
reckless negligence by "knowingly placing a known alcoholic in 
command" of the supertanker. Joseph Hazelwood was acquitted in 
1990 of operating the tanker while drunk.
     The settlement concludes only one of the several lawsuits 
between Exxon and underwriters over contested hundreds of millions 
of dollars of the nearly $3 billion the corporation has paid out to 
date in cleanup and liability costs.
     Exxon claims the underwriters are liable because of the 
catastrophic accident insurance it bought to protect it against a 
major accident.
     Another trial is scheduled to begin April 8 in a Texas state court 
to resolve a $250 million claim against the insurers.
     In a parallel lawsuit in New York, a federal appeals court last 
week ruled that Lloyds' action seeking a declaratory judgement 
denying coverage to Exxon under the "global corporate excess 
policy" is a "novel issue of federal admiralty law" that should be 
heard.
     None of these lawsuits are related to the civil case verdict that 
awarded $5 billion in punitive damages to commercial fishermen, 
Alaskan natives, property owners and others affected by the spill.
     But Exxon last week also settled the last in a series of civil 
suits, this one for $3.5 million. That will clear the way for the 
corporation to appeal the $5 billion award, which the courts said 
couldn't be appealed until all the other civil suits cleared the court 
dockets.

Wildlife group produces oil and gas at more 
than one wilderness preserve

     The National Audubon Society or its state affiliates are opposing 
oil and gas exploration and production in the Arctic National 
Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) at the same time it's producing minerals 
from three of its wilderness reserves.
     The Washington-based Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI) 
reported the ironic situation is taking place in sanctuaries in 
Michigan and Florida as well as in the Paul J. Rainey Sanctuary in 
Louisiana. 
     The drilling activities are going on without harm to the wildlife 
or surroundings, CEI says.
     The Rainey story came to light last year as a complicated 
arrangement in which the society acquired rights to 37 wells, which 
operate under Audubon restrictions.
     The other two cases were revealed by Jonathan Adler, CEI 
director of environmental studies, in the institute's monthly 
newsletter. Adler wrote the drilling has not harmed nesting areas of 
the osprey and sandhill crane in the Bernard Baker Sanctuary in 
Calhoun County, Mich., managed by the Michigan Audubon 
Society. And he noted minimal environmental impact is reported 
from oil and gas exploration allowed by the national society in the 
Corkscrew Swamp Sanctuary near Naples, Fla.
     A spokeswoman at the society's headquarters in New York 
couldn't comment immediately about the Michigan affiliate's 
involvement but doubted the claims about the Florida sanctuary. 
She dismissed the comparison between Rainey and ANWR because 
of the natural "regenerative" advantages in Louisiana.
     But CEI's Adler views it differently, saying the Audubon 
experience suggests balancing environmental concerns and fossil 
fuel development is possible.
     "Indeed," he concluded, "Audubon accepted oil development on 
its own lands before the most advanced state-of-the-art technologies 
were available. Industry representatives claim that with these 
technologies ANWR oil development is ecologically sound."

WTO makes it official: Clean Air Act RFG 
requirements ruled 'protectionist' 

     The World Trade Organization (WTO) has officially ruled that a 
U.S. Clean Air Act provision requiring foreign gasoline refiners to 
meet a different emissions standard than domestic refiners is 
discriminatory and therefore in violation of international trade 
agreements.
     The rule was challenged by Venezuela and Brazil and is the 
first ruling by the nascent WTO, which took the place of the 
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) last January (TER 
12/25/95, p. 1009).
     The ruling from the WTO drew sharp criticism from political 
wings that had fought bitterly against the United States signing on 
to the global trade treaty. And environmentalists were quick to 
denounce it as a threat to America's environmental policy.
     The WTO's judgement, while probably having little effect on 
the reformulated gasoline (RFG) market, is already promising to 
generate considerable political fallout during the coming months 
leading up to the Republican presidential primaries.
     However, the timing of the decision renders the practical terms 
of the decision moot since by the time the appeals process is 
finished, foreign and domestic refiners will be only months from 
having to meet identical standards.
     The administration, which earlier had supported a change in the 
law that would have satisfied Venezuela, said it would definitely 
appeal the ruling.
     In a statement just after the ruling, Trade Representative 
Mickey Kantor said the administration was "carefully reviewing" 
the legal options available. But after opponents to the WTO loudly 
and publicly criticized the ruling as a threat to domestic sovereignty 
and environmental protection, the administration said it would 
definitely appeal.
     "Obviously, we are disappointed that the panel did not accept 
our view," Kantor said. "At the same time, the results of this 
dispute cannot and will not compromise this administration's 
commitment to our environmental laws."

Administration will appeal

     If the United States appeals the ruling, it must then accept an 
appeals verdict as final, according to stipulations in the global trade 
accord. That process could take up to 18 months. If the United 
States does not appeal, the rule will be adopted within 60 days. 
Administration officials said the prospects for a successful appeal 
do not look good.
     If the United States loses the appeal, it would have to modify 
the rule or face WTO-imposed penalties. The process can only be 
stopped by a consensus of WTO members (120 nations), or if the 
disputing parties settle their differences.
     Also, a deal cut during the congressional debates over the WTO 
between lawmakers and the administration allows Congress to 
review all cases the United States loses. And the verdict will likely 
not sit well with GOP leaders. Kantor said he would consult with 
Congress on the issue soon.
     Venezuela, one of the largest exporters of gasoline through its 
Citgo Petroleum Corp. and state-owned oil company, Petroleos de 
Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA), complained that the Environmental 
Protection Agency (EPA) rule on RFG applied different baseline 
standards for foreign and domestic refiners as dictated by the Clean 
Air Act Amendments of 1990 (CAAA).
     The act defined two sets of requirements to be met by refiners: 
One set (benzene and oxygenate content and vapor pressure) was 
accompanied by strict measures to be met by all refiners, foreign or 
domestic; the second set (governing criteria for sulfur, aromatics 
and olefin content) allows domestic refiners of RFG to meet their 
own individual 1990 baseline average for 1995-1997.
     After 1997, the whole issue becomes moot. Then, domestic 
refiners must meet the 1990 domestic industry average for non-
attainment areas, the same set for foreign refiners last year that 
caused Venezuela to seek the WTO ruling.
     EPA proposed a rule change in 1994 that would have allowed 
foreign refiners to use their individual baselines to produce RFG 
after Venezuela threatened action under GATT. Some lawmakers 
then accused the White House of catering to Venezuela to avoid a 
potentially embarrassing GATT challenge at a time when the 
administration was pressing the Uruguay round of talks in Congress. 
In August of 1994, Congress denied EPA funds to implement the 
rule (TER 8/8/94, p. 528).
     Venezuela filed a complaint with GATT then, and transferred 
the complaint to the WTO in January 1995 claiming the law set a 
double standard and cost it $150 million per year. Brazil joined the 
petition and Norway and the European Union were listed as 
interested third parties (TER 4/17, p. 315).

Political fallout expected

     The consequences of the ruling will reverberate loudly during 
this election year especially with presidential aspirants who have 
been critical of the enhanced power of the WTO. Patrick Buchanan 
and Sen. Majority Leader Bob Dole of the Republican party have 
both been critical of the WTO's far-reaching power over trade and 
tariffs.
     And pro-environmental as well as petroleum industry groups will 
raise a hue and cry over the ruling since it could set a precedent for 
undercutting other environmental legislation and would allow an 
unfair competitive advantage to foreign refiners that did not have to 
invest the billions of dollars in upgrading plants to meet the stricter 
CAAA standards.
     Some economists are worried that it might cause protectionist 
and isolationist sentiments in the country to intensify and threaten 
freer international trade.
     Said one, "It's not good that this is an early issue for WTO. I 
think it is an isolated incident, but that's not the way it will be 
portrayed."

Federal appeals court upholds right of New 
York to adopt Calif. LEV rules

     A much anticipated federal appeals court ruling has affirmed 
New York state's right to adopt the California Low-Emission 
Vehicle (LEV) program without also imposing California's lower-
sulfur reformulated gasoline (RFG) plan.
     The verdict concludes three years of litigation and likely 
exhausts an important avenue automakers sought to overturn 
Northeast states' adoption of the strict California LEV. A similar 
appeal in Massachusetts will probably be abandoned, industry 
sources predict.
     New York and Massachusetts adopted the California LEV in 
1992. Last year, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 
approved a modified version of the California LEV for all the states 
of the Northeast Ozone Transport Commission (OTC) made up of 
the 12 states of the Northeast and the District of Columbia.
     Automakers sued, arguing that by imposing the California LEV 
in New York without the special RFG, they would be required to 
build yet a "third vehicle" to meet New York standards along with 
two other vehicles: one to meet a national standard and one for a 
California standard.
     The industry claimed the move was illegal under the Clean Air 
Act Amendments of 1990 (CAAA), which forbids a "third vehicle," 
and that it could not guarantee a car built for use outside California 
could meet New York's higher standards because of the higher-
sulfur levels in Northeast RFG.
     Yet the Second Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a trial court's 
decision that the "third vehicle claim is not viable if it is based on 
a difference between California and federal fuels."
     Only alterations stemming from differences in emission 
standards, not fuel standards, can amount to a third vehicle, said the 
court, making plain that there is no linkage between the regulation 
of fuels and vehicles.
     "A state can never violate the third vehicle prohibition so long 
as it satisfies the identical requirement and does not administer or 
enforce the California emission standard in a more burdensome 
manner than what occurs in California," Judge Richard Cardamon 
said in his ruling.
     Automakers claim the higher-sulfur contents of Northeast RFG 
contaminate catalytic converters and decrease efficiency while 
increasing emissions.
     Under the CAAA, automakers must build a special California 
car that would operate on a modified, lower-sulfur content RFG.
     The case, Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Assn. v. New York, 
settles one of the disputes between the automotive industry and 
Northeast states. But since talks are continuing between the two -- 
moderated by the EPA -- to reach agreement on a National LEVthat 
would replace the OTC LEV, states and industry have squared off 
over another issue: electric vehicle mandates, also part of the 
California LEV.
     Now that it appears California regulators will alter the original 
program adopted by the Northeast states, the industry is expected to 
file more lawsuits against member states (see related story p. 36).

Enron gets official offer from India to revive 
Dabhol Power project

     Dabhol Power Co. obtained a formal offer last week from the 
Indian state of Maharashtra to revive the largest power project  
backed by U.S. corporations in India.
     Enron, a Houston-based gas supplier that holds 80% in Dabhol 
Power said the company will reply to the state's formal offer shortly 
and hopes to resume construction on the project within 90 days.
     In any event, after a five-month hiatus, work on the $2.8 billion 
project should resume soon, Enron Corp. said.
     The power project was canceled by the Maharashtra government 
in August because of concerns over its high cost and environmental 
impact.
     Enron has since offered to reduce the capital cost of the project 
and lower the price of the electricity it sells to the state.
     Enron also is still trying to recover damages from the 
Maharashtra state government. The two sides have been meeting in 
London for arbitration, and finished two days of talks last Monday.
     The next full hearing was set for June 3. Enron said it plans to 
continue arbitration while it studies the government's new terms.

IPPs accuse NiMo of trying to slip out of 
contracts with tax proposal

     Niagara Mohawk's (NiMo) petition for the Federal Energy 
Regulatory Commission (FERC) to relieve New York utilities from 
paying a tax on natural gas used by unregulated generators (UG) is 
"yet another backhanded attempt" by NiMo to get out of its 
contracts with independent suppliers," according to New York 
independent power producers (IPPs). 
     NiMo has asked FERC to supersede a New York state law that 
requires utility customers to pay the independent producers' natural 
gas import tax, saying the statute conflicts with FERC's 
requirements that utilities pay unregulated generators no more than 
avoided costs. 
     "The facts are pretty simple: the New York State Legislature 
passed a tax, and the New York State Legislature mandated that the 
tax be recovered from utility electric and gas customers," said 
Independent Power Producers of New York Executive Director Carol 
Murphy.
     "The fact that IPPs also act as tax collectors, just as the utilities 
do, has absolutely nothing to do with avoided costs and is certainly 
no reason for regulators in Washington, D.C., to begin second-
guessing state tax policies and legislative prerogatives." 
    Murphy questions how the gas tax reimbursement that utilities 
pay independents could have anything to do with avoided costs 
when every penny the generators get from utilities is a penny they 
have to pay the state.
     This petition "is just another fanciful fabrication that NiMo's 
lawyers have cooked up. It will not succeed at anything besides 
distracting everyone from negotiating real solutions," Murphy 
added. "What ratepayers probably don't know is that every time 
Niagara Mohawk files a lawsuit, however frivolous, they 
[ratepayers] pay for it."
     NiMo claims the requirement that utilities pay the independents' 
4.25% import tax places overall payment to unregulated generators 
above avoided costs and is a violation of federal law. The utility 
estimates that the tax will add $7.2 million to its customers bills in 
1996 and $13.5 million in 2006.   
     "Not only are we required to purchase electricity from UGs 
regardless of customer need and often at prices that exceed the 
electricity's market value, but we are compelled to reimburse the 
UGs for the tax they pay on the natural gas used to produce that 
electricity," said NiMo CEO William Davis. "We believe that state 
law is pre-empted by federal law."

Independents argue for case-by-case 
determination in FERC's OCS inquiry

     The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's (FERC) inquiry 
into whether it should deregulate facilities in the Outer Continental 
Shelf (OCS) has drawn comments indicating a growing rift between 
independent and pipeline-affiliated offshore systems.
     FERC launched the notice of inquiry (NOI) to free up the 
billions of dollars in offshore development capital stuck in limbo 
due to uncertainty surrounding whether new projects will be 
classified as non-jurisdictional gathering or regulated as interstate 
transmission.
     A determination that an OCS facility performs a gathering 
function alters the customer protection equation far more than a 
similar decision for an onshore facility, FERC and the commenters 
acknowledge. That's because in the OCS there is no state authority 
to pick up the regulatory responsibility FERC would shed.
     Blue Dolphin Pipe Line, an independent OCS facility that won a 
change in status to jurisdictionally exempt gathering, argues in its 
comments that facilities' status should be determined on a case-by-
case basis. 
     Blue Dolphin expressed skepticism that any interstate or 
affiliated OCS facility could be safely deregulated and said any 
generic move to do so would violate the protections afforded by the 
Natural Gas Act.
     Enron, which owns interstate pipelines and OCS facilities, urged 
FERC to grant all OCS facilities the presumption that they are 
gathering systems -- shifting the burden of proof to those who oppose 
the exempt status.
     The primary function test should also be modified, eliminating 
reference to the diameter of pipes, the location of compression 
stations and requiring lower operating pressures than those found in 
onshore transmission facilities, Enron says.
     The Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (OCSLA) would fill the 
regulatory gap that states now must plug when FERC declares 
onshore facilities perform a gathering function, Enron contends.
     "The OCSLA and its requirement that pipelines provide open 
and nondiscriminatory access to both owner and non-owner shippers 
provides sufficient authority for regulation of offshore gathering and 
protects the public interest," Enron notes.
     Blue Dolphin disagrees.
     "Because the commission has rarely if ever engaged in active 
regulation under -- or even interpretation of -- the [OCSLA], it is not 
possible to conclude that reliance on the OCSLA is sufficient to 
protect the public interest," Blue Dolphin contends.
     "Wholesale change in the regulation of all OCS pipelines is 
unlawful, unwarranted and likely only to produce regulatory 
uncertainty devastating to offshore production and transportation," 
Blue Dolphin asserts."In the absence of compelling reasons for 
change, existing policies and precedent should be observed."
     Blue Dolphin suggests a series of safeguards FERC should 
impose before granting OCS facilities gathering status including:
     ** Banning interstate pipelines or their affiliates from owning 
any OCS gathering systems. Existing facilities reclassified as 
gathering would then "be sold to independent third parties that are 
neither interstate pipelines nor their affiliates."
     ** Performing market power studies as part of the modified 
primary function test FERC uses to determine the status of 
facilities. This is needed, Blue Dolphin contends, because OCS 
facilities can have market power in excess of that enjoyed by 
onshore interstates.
     ** Ensuring that customers receive just and reasonable rates by 
imposing light-handed regulation on OCS facilities that lack market 
power instead of exempting them entirely.
     "The commission's responsibility under the Natural Gas Act has 
been -- and remains -- to restrain pipelines' monopoly power," Blue 
Dolphin said in characterizing some of the NOI's suggestions as 
irresponsible and unlawful. "In an era of increasing competition in 
gas sales, this responsibility is even more important." (RM95-6)

Nuclear industry pushes for economies as 
new polls slam/praise its future

     The country's 109 operating nuclear power plants operated at a 
record 78.2% capacity from January through October of 1995 besting 
the 75.1% capacity achieved for all of 1994, according to the 
Nuclear Energy Institute (NEI).
     Also, nuclear power production is estimated to have reached a 
record high in percentage of total domestic energy consumption -- 
including transportation -- at 7.2 quadrillion Btus claiming an 8.3% 
share, the American Petroleum Institute (API) reported in its 1995 
statistical energy report.
     API said that higher utilization of nuclear generating capacity 
pushed output since the number of operating plants has remained 
unchanged (see related story, p. 44).
     In reporting that oil's share of the overall 1995 domestic energy 
market slipped under 40% for the first time in almost three decades, 
API found that nuclear energy was able to grab 25% of the market 
share lost by heavy residual oil -- used to power utility boilers -- as 
a result of fuel switching by electricity suppliers.
     NEI President Phillip Bayne said that increased production 
along with a coordinated industry-wide program to reduce operating 
and maintenance costs is part of an overall strategy to keep nuclear 
electricity competitive with coal-fired plants by lowering cost per 
kilowatt hour.
     Nuclear utilities, he said, have launched a number of initiatives 
-- individually and collectively -- to improve economic 
competitiveness.
     While competitiveness within the soon-to-be deregulated 
electric utility industry has forced nuclear plant operators to focus 
on efficiency and cost reductions, it has also cast a pall over the 
immediate future of nuclear generation domestically. Industry 
officials continually site the exorbitant capital costs of building 
nuclear power plants as the primary reason utilities will unlikely 
seek license applications for new plants anytime soon. Also, 
analysts predict a glut of electric power on the market within the 
coming years.
     But the lack of interest has not deterred the nuclear energy 
industry. NEI has been supporting efforts to develop advanced power 
plant designs, pre-approved by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, 
that would be ready should the domestic power market change 
course.

Industry poll shows majority support

     In the meantime, the U.S. nuclear generation industry is looking 
abroad for business opportunities. Energy-hungry developing nations, 
especially in Asia, are very receptive to nuclear-generated 
electricity as a means of providing power within the coming 
decades. And the U.S. nuclear industry believes U.S. advanced 
designs and technology will provide the safest and most efficient 
plants for those countries.
     A new poll issued by NEI reports that three-fourths of Americans 
believe that also, responding that U.S. "peaceful" nuclear 
technology should continue to play a leading role in world markets.
     The opinion poll of 1,000 "nationally representative" U.S. 
adults, conducted by Bruskin/Goldring Research for NEI, found that 
57% of the public "care personally" about maintaining this leading 
role.
     The poll also reports that 72% surveyed said advanced-design 
reactors should be considered for their areas of the country when 
new generating capacity is needed. And two-thirds say today's 
nuclear power plants are clean and reliable. Fifty-five percent say 
they are safe.
Environmental group finds opposite results
     Yet, the poll conducted for NEI differs dramatically from another 
poll released last week showing two-thirds of Americans opposed to 
nuclear power.
     Commissioned by the Sustainable Energy Budget Coalition 
(SEBC) and conducted by Research/Strategy/Management Inc. 
(RSM), the poll found that an overwhelming majority of Americans 
believe that when cutting budgets, nuclear energy research and 
development should be the given the smallest allocation and 
renewable energy to largest
     The poll interviewed 1,000 registered voters nationwide who 
SEBC said were more "affluent, more politically aware and more 
active.
     "They probably would be more conservative than the whole 
population," said Ron Hinkley with RSM.
     Added Scott Denman with the Safe Energy Communication 
Council, "The survey reveals that negative opinions about nuclear 
power can generate vote behavior among a segment of the 
population, particularly Independents, who believe that nuclear 
power should be the program cut first.
     "These findings should not be lost on those members of 
Congress sympathetic to the nuclear industry's calls for additional 
funds to develop a new generation of commercial plants," he said. 
"Congress continues to ignore the people's will by spending our tax 
dollars on wasteful, out-moded, "junk-food" energy programs like 
nuclear power."

Dueling polls reach opposite results for 
pro-nuke, anti-nuke agendas

     The nuclear industry is calling "hypocritical" a claim by 
environmental groups that a majority of Americans support 
continued studies on nuclear waste disposal -- perhaps another two 
years -- before any congressional action is taken.
     The Safe Energy Communication Council (SECC) and 
Greenpeace released a poll last week reporting that "a lopsided 
70% to 27% of the U.S. electorate wants Congress to immediately 
form an independent commission to find new solutions to storing 
radioactive waste."
     What's lopsided, says the Nuclear Energy Institute (NEI), is the 
one-question poll SECC and Greenpeace used to produce their 
figures.
     "Their poll question is blatantly misleading by suggesting that 
no disposal solution exists, when scientists worldwide agree that an 
underground repository can best isolate used nuclear fuel from the 
environment," NEI said.
     The question: Congress is considering changing the nuclear 
waste law. Two plans are being proposed.
     Plan A would permit the transportation by rail and truck, in the 
near future, of radioactive waste from nuclear reactors around the 
country to a temporary, above-ground storage site in Nevada until a 
permanent solution can be found.
     Plan B calls for the immediate formation of an independent 
review commission to find new solutions to storing radioactive 
waste before any of it is transported around the country.
     Which of these plans do you support?
     The results: 26.6% support Plan A; 69.7% support Plan B; and 
3.7% don't know.
     SECC's Scott Denman said the poll results show that Americans 
overwhelmingly oppose current legislation in Congress that would 
create a temporary storage facility near Yucca Mountain, Nevada.
     "Members of Congress are so far out of touch with voters, they 
risk being out of a job if they continue to push this quick-fix scam 
for the serious problem of nuclear waste storage," said Denman.
     NEI retaliated that the poll did not give people all the facts they 
need to form an informed opinion about nuclear waste disposal.
     "SECC and Greenpeace won't give people all the facts they 
need to form an informed opinion about nuclear waste disposal," 
said NEI, "it's not surprising that their one-question poll produced a 
'finding' that supports their antinuclear agenda."
     NEI trotted out their own 1995 poll showing that 63% of 
Americans said that a temporary storage facility should be built in 
an unpopulated desert area where nuclear waste could be stored 
until a permanent facility is ready.
     The nuclear industry is supporting H.R. 1020, and a companion 
Senate bill, that would immediately initiate construction of a 
temporary facility near Yucca Mountain for nuclear waste disposal.
     SECC and Greenpeace are lining up behind S. 544, sponsored by 
Sen. Richard Bryan, D-Nev., that would place a two-year 
moratorium on the nuclear waste program and establish an 
independent, "blue-ribbon" commission to evaluate current efforts 
and recommend a solution.
     NEI said the proposed commission would add an additional $5 
billion onto nuclear electricity consumers' utility bills during the 
two-year moratorium, something SECC and Greenpeace failed to 
tell their respondents.
     "If [respondents] had all the facts ... the survey results would 
have been different, and honest," NEI said.

Oil crisis likely within 10 years, Energy 
Dept. officials predict

     An Energy Dept. official said last week that he'd bet money 
there will be an oil crisis within the next 10 years.
     And he's not a lone alarmist at DOE who believes this.
     "This has been discussed in the highest ranks of the department. 
The likelihood of an oil crisis in the next decade is very plausible 
and prevalent through DOE," said Dr. Joseph Romm, the acting 
principal deputy assistant secretary for energy efficiency.
     Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary testified to that fact in a 
telephone interview: "I take this very seriously. I see a crisis as 
imminent and something we should take heed of."      
     Romm said there was also a consensus among many energy 
experts that the country is sleep walking into a disaster by not 
addressing the possibility now.
     Oil industry analysts argue that supplies are plentiful and the 
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) no longer 
exercises the crippling control over the spigot it once did in the 
1970s, so the possibility of a crisis or embargo is very far-fetched.
     But Romm pointed out that the United States is already 52% 
dependent on imports for its oil needs now at a cost of over $50 
billion a year to our trade deficit. That will grow to over 60% in the 
coming decade, DOE predicts. Coupled with the exponential 
demand for oil in developing countries, especially Asia, the 
politically unstable Persian Gulf countries could end up controlling 
nearly 80% of the global energy supply.
     "That trend is inescapable," Romm said.
     For the first time in four years, total U.S. petroleum imports, 
including refined products, declined, though they still account for 
more than 50% of the country's demand, and crude oil imports rose 
3.2%, according to the American Petroleum Institute's (API) 1995 
statistical report, (see story, p. 44). 
     O'Leary and Romm made their comments following the release 
of a new poll by the Sustainable Energy Budget Coalition (SEBC) 
supporting the country's need to seek alternative energy sources to 
lessen the dependence on foreign oil.

Environmentalists say renewables the answer

     The poll, conducted for the coalition of environmental and 
renewable energy supporters by Research/Strategy/Management 
(RSM) Inc. of Maryland, found that 75% of respondents want to 
reduce U.S. dependency on foreign oil with more than half favoring 
stronger support for government funding of energy efficiency and 
renewable energy sources.
     The survey found that 41% make a balanced budget their 
priority.
     An RSM researcher said the poll was conducted by telephone to 
1,000 registered voters nationwide who were older, more affluent 
and more politically aware and active. He said the sample probably 
reflects a slight conservative bias.
     According to the survey, a majority of respondents believed that 
funding priorities for energy research and development should be 
shifted from conventional energy sources such as fossil fuels and 
nuclear power to renewable and alternative energy sources that 
would lessen dependence on foreign oil and enhance national 
security.
      "Through its actions during the past year, Congress is sending a 
message that it apparently prefers to risk sending Americans to war 
again to protect foreign supplies of oil or to risk the environment by 
opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge rather than invest in 
sustainable energy technologies," said Scott Denman with the Safe 
Energy Communication Council, a SEBC member.
     O'Leary agreed that renewable energy and energy efficiency 
programs through DOE and the Environmental Protection Agency 
(EPA) were the answers to protecting the country's national 
security.
     "We need everything we've got going now that is reliable, 
affordable and sustainable," she said alluding to the 
administration's continued efforts to increase renewable energy 
R&D and efficiency programs before a Congress that shows very 
little tolerance for such in reduced budget times.
     The coalition released the poll on the fifth anniversary of the 
Gulf War to emphasize the seriousness of the country's growing oil 
import dependence and to demand that candidates in the 1996 
election year put the nation's energy policy at the top of their 
campaign agendas.

Spur domestic production, say producers

     Domestic petroleum producers used the occasion to point out 
that elected leaders promised five years ago when the country went 
to war to protect it's access to a plentiful supply of Middle Eastern 
oil that they would find ways to increase domestic production to 
lessen foreign oil dependence.
     Though they disagree on the means, the Independent Petroleum 
Assn. of America (IPAA) and the SEBC seem to agree on the 
outcome if some action is not taken.
     "Is the United States less vulnerable to a similar conflict or 
threat to a supply disruption," asked Lew Ward, IPAA chairman. 
"I'm afraid the answer is no."
     IPAA pointed out that domestic production is at its lowest level 
since 1954. As more imported oil floods the U.S. market, the group 
said, American producers are unable to compete and are forced to 
downsize casuing production to fall even more.
     While pointing out recent laws that lift the export of crude from 
Alaska's North Slope giving West Coast producers new drilling 
incentives and encouraging deep water production in the Gulf of 
Mexico, IPAA said. Lawmakers are still not focused on a cohesive 
energy policy that would result in even greater domestic production.
     IPAA said the budget negotiators proposal to sell 32 million 
barrels of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) in order 
to raise $470 million over the next seven years to balance the 
budget and reduce the deficit is one example the country's resckless 
energy policy.
     "Dumping oil on the market only hurts domestic production, our 
last line of defense in the event of an emergency," Ward said. 
     The SPR holds nearly 600 million barrels of oil for use in the 
event of an oil disruption.
     The administration originally only agreed to sell 6 million 
barrels to pay for remediation at the Weeks Island SPR facility in 
Louisiana.
     But both Republican and Democratic proposals now under 
consideration would sell that amount plus the additional 32 million 
barrels.
     Ward called this an "irresponsible energy strategy," and said 
that energy policy should be made a top priority again for the 
country and especially with presidential candidates.
     His group believes that policy should focus on improving 
technologies for exploration and production and providing producers 
with incentives to drill and maintain marginal wells.
     "We can and we should be doing more to mobilize U.S. 
producers and increase domestic production as a way of backing out 
oil imports," he said.

Exploration and production spending will 
jump, worldwide survey shows

     Oil and gas exploration and production expenditures (E&P) will 
increase by almost 8% in 1996, the greatest increase in six years, 
according to Salomon Brothers' worldwide survey of 275 oil and gas 
companies.
     The biggest E&P target is Latin America.
     The survey shows global E&P expenditures in 1996 of almost 
$64 billion, up from the $59 billion expected in 1995. U.S. spending 
is planned to increase 11.8% in 1996, after only a 4.7% advance in 
1995. That translates into raised spending amounts of $18.2 billion 
from $16.3 billion in 1995, Salomon said.
     "The results indicate that the recovery in international spending 
that began in 1995 will be sustained," said analyst Geoff Keiburtz.
     He attributes the increased spending plans to a firmer outlook for 
natural gas prices, good drilling success and improved cost 
efficiency. Deferral of projects during the period of weak gas prices 
in 1995 also may be playing a part in the spending boost.
     Latin America has displaced the Asia/Pacific region as having 
the greatest perceived E&P potential, the survey found, with over 
60% of the respondents citing Latin America as a target. Fifty-three 
percent cited Asia/Pacific and 30% the Gulf of Mexico.
     International E&P outside the United States and Canada are 
planned by British Petroleum, Arco, Texaco, Amoco, Unocal, 
Mobil and Exxon. Those reducing spending include British Gas and 
Phillips.
     Some of the largest planned spenders, according to the survey, 
will be the 15 U.S. majors that will spend $10.3 billion, 13.4% more 
than last year and the strongest planned increase since the survey 
began 14 years ago.
     U.S. independents, however, are planning to increase E&P 
spending at a more modest level of 9.3% over last year. Apache, 
Coastal, Cabot and Oryx Energy planned to spend the most in E&P, 
the survey said, while Kerr-McGee, KCS Energy and Burlington 
Resources plan to spend the least.

Canada E&P spending will drop

     Though total global E&P spending shows a rise, the survey 
found that Canadian companies will lower their E&P budgets this 
year. A 6.4% decline was reported by 96 companies there.
     Salomon Brothers' said that companies are determining 
spending levels based on a WTI crude price of $17.48/bbl. The 
average natural gas price (Henry Hub) for 1996 is predicted to be 
$1.75/Mcf.

Environmentalists applaud SDG&E 

     The Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) named the 
San Diego Gas & Electric Co. and its parent Enova Corp. the 
winners of its environmental award, making it the first time a 
private-sector utility has been given the honor.
     NRDC said the utility company won the award for its long-term 
commitment to energy efficiency programs, which saved its 
customers more than 10 billion kilowatt hours of electricity during 
the past 18 years. Their efforts have also diverted several million 
tons of pollutants from the atmosphere as a result of reduced 
electricity demand, said Ralph Cavanagh, co-director of NRDC's 
energy program.  
     "Today, the company's energy-efficiency strategies are among 
the best anywhere at delivering increased productivity, lower 
operating costs and improved environmental quality," Cavanagh 
said.

WEP wants 6.2% rate increase

     Wisconsin Electric Power Co. (WEP) is asking for an increase 
of 6.2% for electric customers, 1.4% for natural gas customers and 
6.4% for steam customers to make up for a projected $82.2 million 
revenue deficiency for its utility operations in 1997.
     "The proposed increase will help us deliver the service 
customers expect and keep us on solid financial footing as the 
competitive market arrives," said Richard Abdoo, the company's 
chairman and chief executive officer. WEP filed the rate increase 
request with the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin.

Gasoline prices increase

Ending a six-month trend of declining prices, the price of self-serve 
regular unleaded gasoline increased 2.1 cents since December, 
according to the American Automobile Association (AAA).
     The AAA monthly Fuel Gauge Survey found the national 
average price for self-serve unleaded is now $1.139 per gallon. Self-
serve premium also rose 2 cents to $1.315, while full-serve regular 
unleaded averages $1.403 per gallon, up 1.3 cents from last month.

Nuclear plants shut

     Two nuclear plants were shut last week while another was 
forced to operate on reduced power. 
     Commonwealth Edison Co. shut down its Zion 2 nuclear power 
plant Jan. 13 to inspect condensor box tubes on the non-nuclear side 
of the plant, said Gary Wald, a company spokesman. The 1,040-
MW pressurized water reactor in Zion, Ill., will be back online 
sometime this week.
     An electric cable malfunction caused Consumers Power Co.'s 
Palisades nuclear plant to go off line Jan. 17, said company 
spokesman Mark Savage. The 730-MW plant in South Haven, 
Mich., will not be restarted for a few days until repairs are made.  
     An inspection of Maine Yankee Atomic Power Co.'s  electric 
generation system required reduced power on Jan. 16. 
     The plant was restarted days earlier following an 11-month 
shutdown due to cracked generator tubes. Marshall Murphy, a plant 
spokesman, said the plant will likely be restored to about 30% of its 
capacity within a few days.

Westinghouse scores fuel cells

A generating plant powered by Westinghouse Electric Corp.'s solid-
oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) reached a record-
setting power output of 27 kilowatts during tests conducted by the 
Southern California Edison Company in Grand Terrace, Calif.
      The Westinghouse unit was modified to allow it to use JP-8 
military jet fuel similar to kerosene and DF-2 diesel fuel. The tests 
on logistic fuels are part of an effort to develop transportable power 
plants for military applications. 
      These fuels require a preprocessor to remove sulfur from the 
fuel and deliver methane to the SOFC. The unit also runs directly 
on natural gas and is designed to smoothly transfer from natural gas 
to logistic fuels and vice versa.
     Westinghouse has received funding from the Energy Dept. and 
other domestic and foreign utilities to develop SOFCs for the 
distributed power and cogeneration market.
