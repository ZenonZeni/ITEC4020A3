Libya's Role in International Terrorism by Jack Plaxe

Since the early 1970's, the Libyan government under Muammar
Qaddafi has both used and sponsored terrorism against the
enemies of the Libyan state.  The "enemies" that have been
attacked include the United States, Israel, neighboring
African states and outspoken Libyan dissidents who oppose the
Qaddafi regime.

Over the years, Qaddafi has provided support to such diverse
groups as the Palestine Liberation Front, the Provisional
Irish Republican Army and the Black Power movement in the
United States.  In the 1980's, Qaddafi's sponsorship and use
of terrorism greatly expanded.  Libya began to provide
operational support in the form of travel documents, weapons,
training, and safe haven to the Abu Nidal organization.
Libyan government agents also began to carry out terrorist
operations directly.  Some of the more notorious terrorist
incidents that Libya has been involved in include:

     The April 1986 bombing of the La Belle disco (3 killed,
  dozens injured)
     The December 1987 bombing of the USO lounge in Barcelona (1
  killed, 9 injured)
     The July 1988 machine gun and hand grenade assault on the
  Greek cruise ship 'The City of Poros' (9 killed, over 100
  injured)
     The December 1988 bombing of Pan Am flight 103 (270 killed)
     The September 1989 bombing of UTA flight 772 (171 killed)

  Despite these terrorist activities, many countries continue to
do business with and maintain diplomatic relations with Libya.
These links provide the Qaddafi government in Libya with
legitimacy which allows it to participate in international
organizations such as the United Nations, the International
Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), and INTERPOL.

The United States strategy vis a vis Libya has been to attempt
to isolate Libya through the imposition of unilateral economic
sanctions.  This strategy was revised in 1992 when the U.S.
led efforts at the United Nations to impose limited aviation
and diplomatic sanctions on Libya for its role in the Pan Am
103 bombing.  These sanctions have since been expanded to
include a variety of limited economic sanctions.  However, the
sanctions do not include an embargo on Libyan oil, the primary
source of Libyan hard currency revenues.

The result of these limited sanctions is that Libya has been
somewhat isolated yet they still participate in international
fora such as the UN, ICAO, and INTERPOL.  If Libya is to be
truly isolated, all nations who condemn terrorism must work to
restrict Libyan participation in the these organizations.

There are some indications that this is underway.  The United
States, Great Britain and France recently led a successful
effort to deny Libya a seat on the UN Security Council.  In
addition, the Libyan delegation to the INTERPOL annual
terrorism conference was rebuked when the US delegation
presented information to the effect that they were seeking two
Libyan government agents for their role in the Pan Am 103
bombing.  The Libyan delegation was so humiliated by the US
presentation that they left the conference and did not return.

Despite these steps, additional efforts must be undertaken to
isolate Libya economically.  It is highly doubtful that
European and other countries will voluntarily stop doing
business with Qaddafi.  For this reason, the limited aviation,
diplomatic, and economic sanctions currently imposed on Libya
through the UN Security Council must be expanded to either
include a complete ban on Libyan oil sales (as was done
against Iraq after the Gulf War) or a total naval blockade of
Libya.  Either action will deny Libya the petrodollars that
prop up the Qaddafi government.

Efforts should also be taken to isolate Libya diplomatically
by denying them the right to participate in international fora
such as the UN, ICAO, and INTERPOL.  A nation that has been
shown to both use and sponsor terrorism should not be a member
of an international police organization whose focus is
international cooperation to prevent criminal activity.  Nor
should Libya be allowed to participate in ICAO, particularly
in light of its involvement in the Pan Am 103 and UTA 772
bombings which resulted in over 400 deaths.

Terrorism has long been an important instrument of Libyan
foreign policy.  The international community must take
stronger steps to isolate Qaddafi both diplomatically and
economically.  If countries continue to provide the Libyan
government legitimacy through trade opportunities and
participation in international fora, the Qaddafi regime will
remain in power and continue to support terrorist activities
around the world.

TERRORISM IN AMERICA: AN ASSESSMENT BY VARIOUS EXPERTS by
Lloyd F. Reese, CPP, CISSP

Two major incidents, the World Trade Center and the Oklahoma
City Federal Building, have shown that terrorist acts have
come to our shores.  They can originate from outside our
boundaries or be truly home grown.  These incidents should not
have been any surprise, especially the homegrown one in
Oklahoma City.

On June 14,1995, the Washington, D.C. Chapter of  the American
Society for Industrial Security (ASIS) held its annual
Countering Terrorism Seminar.  Frank McGuire, a Bethesda, MD
security consultant, described an event in 1988 that should
have been a pointer to the damage even one man can do.  A
disgruntled tax payer rigged a homemade mortar in his pickup
truck that was designed to attack the building in West LA that
housed the IRS.  Fortunately, the chemicals involved had an
unintended reaction and the fire department was called for a
truck on fire. After extinguishing the fire, the fire fighters
noted a suspicious glow and called the bomb squad.  Several
city blocks were evacuated while the situation was resolved.
Had it gone off as planned, the IRS Building would have
suffered major damage with significant human losses.

McGuire was asked how to assess the potential risk created by
right-wing extremists.  He responded that, based on the West
LA scenario, and what we know about Oklahoma City, it is
conceivable for one deranged person to build a truck bomb.  It
would simply take longer than if he had help.  Using this
criteria, McGuire commented that if there are 1,000 people
nation-wide with these intentions and capabilities, that means
there could be 1,000 truck bombs.

Much media attention has been focused on militias and related
movements since the Oklahoma City bombing. At the ASIS Annual
Seminar in New Orleans, September 11-14, 1995, Daniel Donohue,
a security consultant based in Hallandale, Florida, discussed
"Domestic Terrorism and Right-Wing Extremist".  He began his
presentation by discussing the history of political violence
in America.  Most of us have forgotten our high school or
college U.S. history which covered labor organizing violence
in the late 19th  and early 20th centuries.  Violence by the
KKK against blacks, primarily in the South, resulted in many
lynchings in the 20s and 30s.  There was more racially related
violence in the 1960s and 70s during the civil rights
movement. The Vietnam War protesters sometimes became violent,
as at the Democratic Convention in Chicago.  This country has
not been immune from political violence, but most of us have
short memories.

Donohue believes that since the Oklahoma City bombing some
militia groups have disbanded and others have gone
underground.  He bases this observation on information
received from the Southern Poverty Law Center's Klanwatch
group, where he has done pro-bono work.

The Symposium, "Terrorism: Past, Present, and Future" was
sponsored by the University of Illinois at Chicago, Office of
International Criminal Justice, July 31-August 3, 1995.  Peter
Probst, a Defense Department international crime specialist
stated, "Ten years ago, most terrorist groups were politically
motivated...now you have a whole range of new groups."  He
suggested that cults, ethnic, and religious groups will not
hesitate to cause large numbers of civilian casualties while
political terrorists have avoided this to keep from losing
political support.

Steven Sloan's paper,  "Terrorism: How Vulnerable is the
United States?", was published by the Strategic Studies
Institute of the Army War College in May 1995.  Sloan points
out that threats from fundamentalists of all religious groups
cannot be ignored. He suggests that such groups might receive
support or be joined by domestic religious extremists.  These
groups might also obtain support from cultists, survivalists,
or neo-fascists who have their own reasons for rejecting the
existing social, economic, and political order, waiting
instead for their own Armageddons.

A unique aspect of Sloan's paper is his suggestion that the
role that could be played by  apolitical terrorists, who are
into violence and intimidation as an aspect of their criminal
activities.  Drug gangs and other criminal enterprises in
inner-city America could become the basis for such operations.
They could corrupt local government with their vast funds.
These groups could use their terrorist tactics to "shake down
the neighborhood" or blackmail the entire city.  Their
financial resources would enable them to acquire a significant
arsenal of weapons to challenge local law enforcement and
implement acts of violence on a level on previously seen in
the U.S.

Most of us think about terrorist attacks on buildings, planes,
and people.  However, Frederick Cohen in his recent book,
Protection and Security on Information Superhighway, discusses
the concept of  "infrastructure warriors" who would attack
electrical power grids or eliminate telecommunications
capabilities.  He cites an article in the July/August 1993
issue of Wired magazine which named the top 10 U.S.
infrastructure targets.  These include the Culpeper, VA
telephone switch that handles federal fund transfers and the
Worldwide Military Command and Control System (WWMCCS).
Another example he gives is a paper presented to the Naval
Postgraduate School in August of 1993 which claims that 20
people and $1,000,000 can bring the U.S. to its knees.

We did not learn much from the West L.A. situation described
by Frank McGuire.  Those in the contingency planning field
know that the effect of the World Trade Center bombing lasted
only a few months. However, research published in Information
Week showed that nearly 40 percent of the businesses in the
World Trade Center when the bomb exploded are no longer in
business.

As we can see from the examples cited above, there are many
possibilities for how terrorism can be viewed in the near
future within the U. S.  We can review past incidents both
here an overseas to understand tactics used against specific
types of targets.  We can improve our intelligence gathering
to obtain a better understanding of potential threats.  We can
practice "target hardening" to encourage the adversary move
away from us to a weaker target.  Finally, we must be have our
crisis management, contingency, and business resumption plans
developed and tested - just in case.  Regardless of what the
future holds, these steps are reasonable and prudent.
