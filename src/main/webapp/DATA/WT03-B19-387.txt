<TITLE>Climate Change Fact Sheet 205</TITLE>
<P>
<H1>How the UN General Assembly<BR>
is responding to the issue<BR>
of climate change</H1>
<HR>
<B>Efforts to formulate an international legal response to climate change are being led by the 
United Nations system.</B> Many international conferences have declared that the UN is the 
appropriate forum for dealing with such a large-scale enterprise. The General Assembly helps to 
coordinate and direct the UN system’s work on climate change. It adopts resolutions at its annual 
meeting that lay down or confirm fundamental (but non-binding) principles that are afterwards 
elaborated by other institutions. The General Assembly also requests the relevant specialized agencies 
and other bodies within the UN system to undertake specific duties. It then provides support for their 
work and reviews their reports.<P>
<B>The first General Assembly initiative relevant to climate change was the establishment of 
the World Commission on Environment and Development in 1983.1</B> Chaired by Prime 
Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland of Norway, this independent body became known as the Brundtland 
Commission. Its 1987 report "Our Common Future"2 analysed the state of the global environment 
and identified priority areas for an institutional and legal response. It called for international 
negotiations for a climate treaty, research into the origins and effects of climate change, scientific 
monitoring of the climate, international policies for reducing emissions of greenhouse gases, and 
measures for coping with the effects of climate change.<P>
<B>In 1988, the General Assembly adopted a resolution that</B> <B>recognized climate 
change as a common concern of mankind".</B>3 It urged the world community to treat climate 
change as a priority issue, reaffirmed a 1987 resolution approving an initiative by the United Nations 
Environment Programme (UNEP) and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) to cooperate 
on this issue4, and endorsed the establishment of the <A HREF = 
"fs208.html">Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)</A>. 
The resolution also encouraged the convening of national and international climate conferences and 
asked <A HREF = "fs206.html">UNEP and WMO</A> to put the IPCC to 
work immediately on a comprehensive review of the state of the global climate. <P>
<B>In 1989 the General Assembly decided to convene <A HREF = 
"fs207.html">the United Nations Conference on Environment and 
Development (UNCED)</A> in June 1992. </B>Climate change was to be a top priority at this 
high-level forum.5  By 1989, a number of international and regional conferences had been held to 
discuss climate change. The UN General Assembly welcomed these efforts and endorsed the decision 
by UNEP and WMO to start work on a climate treaty. It proposed that this work start as quickly as 
possible and take into account the conclusions of theSecond World Climate Conference, to be held in 
1990.6 (See fact sheet 221.)<P>
<B>The Assembly’s 1989 resolutions on climate change emphasized <A HREF = 
"fs204.html">the concerns of developing countries</A>7 and of <A 
HREF = "fs203.html">low-lying coastal and island states</A>.8</B> 
They called for technology transfers and funding mechanisms to ensure the full participation of 
developing countries in the climate negotiations. The resolutions also urged the world community to 
help the developing states, especially those most affected by <A HREF = 
"fs102.html">rising sea levels</A> and other climate change impacts, to 
adapt to the situation. <P>
<B>The Assembly’s 1990 "climate resolution" established <A HREF = 
"fs209.html">the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee for a 
Framework Convention on Climate Change (INC)</A>9.  </B>The INC’s task was to formulate 
an international climate Convention. The General Assembly asked the INC to finalize and adopt the 
Climate Convention in time for it to be opened for signature at UNCED in June 1992.  It reaffirmed 
this request in December 1991 and asked states  to continue contributing to the funds established for 
financing the participation of developing countries in the work of the IPCC and the INC.10 The 
INCsucceeded in adopting <A HREF = "fs250.html">the UN Framework 
Convention on Climate Change</A> in May 1992 in compliance with the Assembly's request. This 
achievement was welcomed by the Assembly in a 1992 Resolution, which also sets out some 
guidelines for future action.11 <P>
