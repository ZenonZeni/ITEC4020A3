<p>Authority: Secs. 2, 38 and 71, Pub. L. 90-629, 90 Stat. 744 (22 U.S.C. 2752, 2778, 2797); E.O. 11958, 42 
FR 4311; 3 CFR 1977 Comp. P. 79; 22 U.S.C. 2658. </p>
<p>&#167;<b> </b><a name="120.1">120.1</a> GENERAL AUTHORITY AND ELIGIBILITY. </p>
<p>(a) Section 38 of the Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2778) authorizes the President to control the 
export and import of defense articles and defense services. The statutory authority of the President to 
promulgate regulations with respect to exports of defense articles and defense services was delegated to 
the Secretary of State by Executive Order 11958, as amended (42 FR 4311). This subchapter implements 
that authority. By virtue of delegations of authority by the Secretary of State, these regulations are 
primarily administered by the Director of the Office of Defense Trade Controls, Bureau of 
Political-Military Affairs, Department of State. </p>
<p>(b) Authorized Officials. All authorities conferred upon the Director of the Office of Defense Trade 
Controls by this subchapter may be exercised at any time by the UnderSecretary of State for International 
Security Affairs, the Assistant Secretary of State for Political-Military Affairs, or the Deputy Assistant 
Secretary of State for Political-Military Affairs responsible for supervising the Office of Defense Trade 
Controls unless the Legal Adviser or the Assistant Legal Adviser for Political-Military Affairs of the 
Department of State determines that any specific exercise of this authority under this subsection may be 
inappropriate. </p>
<p>(c ) Eligibility. Only U.S. persons (as defined in &#167; 120.15) and foreign governmental entities in the United 
States may be granted licenses or other approvals (other than retransfer approvals sought pursuant to this 
subchapter). Foreign persons (as defined in &#167; 120.16) other than governments are not eligible. U.S. 
persons who have been convicted of violating the criminal statutes enumerated in &#167; 120.27, who have been 
debarred pursuant to part 127 or 128 of this subchapter, who are the subject of an indictment involving the 
criminal statues enumerated in &#167; 120.27, who are ineligible to contract with, or to receive a license or 
other form of authorization to import defense articles or defense services from any agency of the U.S. 
Government, who are ineligible to receive export licenses (or other forms of authorization to export) from 
any agency of the U.S. Government, who are ineligible to receive export licenses (or other forms of 
authorization to export ) from any agency of the U.S. Government, who are subject to Department of State 
Suspension/Revocation under &#167; 126.7 (a)(1)-(a)(7) of this subchapter, or who are ineligible under &#167; 
127.6(c ) of this subchapter are generally ineligible. Applications for licenses or other approvals will be 
considered only if the applicant has registered with the Office of Defense Trade Controls pursuant to part 
122 of this subchapter. All applications and requests for approval must be signed by a U.S. person who 
has been empowered by the registrant to sign such documents. </p>
<p>(d) The exemptions provided in this subchapter do not apply to transactions in which the exporter or any 
party to the export (as defined in &#167; 126.7(e) of this subchapter) is generally ineligible as set forth above in 
paragraph (c ) of this section, unless an exception has been granted pursuant to &#167; 126.7(c ) of this 
subchapter. </p>
<p>&#167; <a name="120.2">120.2</a> DESIGNATION OF DEFENSE ARTICLES AND DEFENSE SERVICES. </p>
<p>The Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2778(a) and 2794(7)) provides that the President shall designate 
the articles and services deemed to be defense articles and defense services for purposes of this 
subchapter. The items so designated constitute the United States Munitions List and are specified in part 
121 of this subchapter. Such designations are made by the Department of State with the concurrence of the 
Department of Defense. For a determination on whether a particular item is included on the U.S. Munitions 
List see &#167; 120.4 (a). </p>
<p>&#167;<b> </b><a name="120.3">120.3</a> POLICY ON DESIGNATING AND DETERMINING DEFENSE ARTICLES AND DEFENSE 
SERVICES<b>.</b> </p>
<p>An article or service may be designated or determined in the future to be a defense article (see &#167; 120.6) or 
defense service (see &#167; 120.9) if it: </p>
<p>(a) Is specifically designed, developed, configured, adapted, or modified for a military application, and </p>
<p>(i) Does not have predominant civil application, and </p>
<p>(ii) Does not have performance equivalent (defined by form, fit and function) to those of an article or 
service used for civil applications; or </p>
<p>(b) Is specifically designed, developed, configured, adapted, or modified for a military or intelligence 
applicability such that control under this subchapter is necessary. </p>
<p>The intended use of the article or service after its export (i.e. for a military or civilian purpose) is not 
relevant in determining whether the article or service is subject to the controls of this subchapter. Any item 
covered by the U.S. Munitions List must be within the categories of the U.S. Munitions List. The scope of 
the U.S. Munitions List shall be changed only by amendments made pursuant to section 38 of the Arms 
Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2778) </p>
<p>&#167;<b> </b><a name="120.4">120.4</a> COMMODITY JURISDICTION. </p>
<p>(a) The commodity jurisdiction procedure is used with the U.S. Government if doubt exists as to whether 
an article or service is covered by the U.S. Munitions List. It may also be used for consideration of a 
redesignation of an article or service currently covered by the U.S. Munitions List. The Department must 
submit a report to Congress at least 30 days before any item is removed from the U.S. Munitions List. 
Upon written request, the Office of Defense Trade Controls shall provide a determination of whether a 
particular article or service is covered by the U.S. Munitions List. The determination, consistent with 
Secs. 120.2, 120.3 and 120.4, entails consultation among the Departments of State, Defense, Commerce 
and other U.S. Government agencies and industry in appropriate cases. </p>
<p>(b) Registration with the Office of Defense Trade Controls as defined in part 122 of this subchapter is not 
required prior to submission of a commodity jurisdiction request. If it is determined that the commodity is 
a defense article or service covered by the U.S. Munitions List, registration is required for exporters, 
manufacturers, and furnishers of defense articles and defense services (see part 122 of this subchapter). </p>
<p>(c ) Requests shall identify the article or service, and include a history of the product's design, 
development and use. Brochures, specifications and any other documentation related to the article or 
service shall be submitted in seven collated sets. </p>
<p>(d)(1) A determination that an article or service does not have predominant civil applications hall be 
made by the Department of State, in accordance with this subchapter, on a case-by-case basis, taking into 
account: </p>
<p>(i) The number, variety and predominance of civil applications; </p>
<p>(ii) The nature, function and capability of the civil applications; and </p>
<p>(iii) The nature, function and capability of the military applications. </p>
<p>(2) A determination that an article does not have the performance equivalent, defined by form, fit and 
function, to those used for civil applications shall be made by the Department of State, in accordance with 
this subchapter, on a case-by-case basis, taking into account: </p>
<p>(i) The nature, function, and capability of the article; </p>
<p>(ii) Whether the components used in the defense article are identical to those components originally 
developed for civil use. </p>
<p>NOTE: The form of the item is its defined configuration, including the geometrically measured 
configuration, density and weight or other visual parameters which uniquely characterize the item, 
component or assembly. For software, form denotes language, language level and media. The fit of the 
item is its ability to physically interface or interconnect with or become an integral part of another item. 
The function of the item is the action or actions it is designed to perform. </p>
<p>(3) A determination that an article has significant military or intelligence applications such that it is 
necessary to control its export as a defense article shall be made, in accordance with this subchapter, on a 
case-by-case basis, taking into account: </p>
<p>(i) the nature, function and capability of the article; </p>
<p>(ii) The nature of controls imposed by other nations on such items (including COCOM and other 
multilateral controls), and </p>
<p>(iii) That items described on the COCOM Industrial List shall not be designated defense articles or 
defense services unless the failure to control such items on the U.S. Munitions List would jeopardize 
significant national security or foreign policy interests. </p>
<p>(e) The Office of Defense Trade Controls will provide a preliminary response within 10 working days of 
receipt of a complete request for commodity jurisdiction. If after 45 days the Office of Defense Trade 
Controls has not provided a final commodity jurisdiction determination, the applicant may request in 
writing to the Director, Center for Defense Trade that this determination be given expedited processing. </p>
<p>(f) State, Defense and Commerce will resolve commodity jurisdiction disputes in accordance with 
established procedures. State shall notify Defense and Commerce of the initiation and conclusion of each 
case. </p>
<p>(g) A person may appeal a commodity jurisdiction determination by submitting a written request for 
reconsideration to the Director of the Center for Defense Trade. The Center for Defense Trade will 
provide a written response of the Director's determination within 30 days of receipt of the appeal. If 
desired, an appeal of the Director's decision can then be made directly to the Assistant Secretary for 
Political-Military Affairs. </p>
<p>&#167; <a name="120.5">120.5</a> RELATION TO REGULATIONS OF OTHER AGENCIES. </p>
<p>If an article or service is covered by the U.S. Munitions List, its export is regulated by the Department of 
State, except as indicated otherwise in this subchapter. For the relationship of this subchapter to 
regulations of the Department of Commerce, the Department of Energy and the Nuclear Regulatory 
Commission, see &#167; 123.20 of this subchapter. The Treasury Department controls permanent imports of 
articles and services covered by the U.S. Munitions Import List from foreign countries by persons subject 
to U.S. jurisdiction (31 CFR part 505). The Department of Commerce regulates the export of items on the 
Commerce Control List (CCL) under the Export Administration regulations (15 CFR parts 768-799). </p>
<p>&#167; <a name="120.6">120.6</a> DEFENSE ARTICLE. </p>
<p>Defense article means any item or technical data designated in 121.1 of this subchapter. The policy 
described in &#167; 120.3 is applicable to designations of additional items. This term includes technical data 
recorded or stored in any physical form, models, mock-ups or other items that reveal technical data 
directly relating to items designated in &#167; 121.1 of this subchapter. It does not include basic marketing 
information on function or purpose or general system descriptions. </p>
<p>&#167; <a name="120.7">120.7</a> SIGNIFICANT MILITARY EQUIPMENT. </p>
<p>(a) Significant military equipment means articles for which special export controls are warranted because 
of their capacity for substantial military utility or capability. Section 47(6) of the Arms Export Control Act 
(22 U.S.C. 2794(6) note) refers to significant combat equipment on the U.S. Munitions List. The terms 
significant military equipment are equivalent for purposes of that section of the arms Export Control Act 
and this subchapter. </p>
<p>(b) Significant military equipment includes: </p>
<p>(1) Items in &#167;121.1 of this subchapter which are preceded by an asterisk; and </p>
<p>(2) All classified articles enumerated in &#167; 121.1. of this subchapter. </p>
<p>&#167; <a name="120.8">120.8</a> MAJOR DEFENSE EQUIPMENT. </p>
<p>Pursuant to section 47(6) of the Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2794(6) note), major defense 
equipment means any item of significant military equipment (as defined in &#167;120.7) on the U.S. Munitions 
List having a nonrecurring research and development cost of more than $50,000,000 or a total production 
cost of more than $200,000,000. </p>
<p>&#167; <a name="120.9">120.9</a> DEFENSE SERVICE </p>
<p>Defense Service Means: </p>
<p>(1) The furnishing of assistance (including training) to foreign persons, whether in the United States or 
abroad in the design, development, engineering, manufacture, production, assembly, testing, repair, 
maintenance, modification, operation, demilitarization, destruction, processing or use of defense articles; 
or </p>
<p>(2) The furnishing to foreign persons of any technical data controlled under this subchapter (see &#167;120.10), 
whether in the United States or abroad. </p>
<p>&#167;<a name="120.10">120.10</a> TECHNICAL DATA. </p>
<p>Technical data means, for purposes of this subchapter: </p>
<p>(1) Information, other than software as defined in &#167;120.10 (4), which is required for the design 
development, production, manufacture, assembly, operation, repair, testing, maintenance, or modification 
of defense articles. This includes information in the form of blueprints, drawings, photographs, plans, 
instructions and documentation. </p>
<p>(2) Classified information relating to defense articles and defense services; </p>
<p>(3) Information covered by an invention secrecy order; </p>
<p>(4) Software as defined in &#167;121.8(f) of this subchapter directly related to defense articles; </p>
<p>(5) This definition does not include information concerning general scientific, mathematical or engineering 
principles commonly taught in schools, colleges and universities or information in the public domain as 
defined in &#167;120.11. It also does not include basic marketing information on function or purpose or general 
system descriptions of defense articles. </p>
<p>&#167;<a name="120.11">120.11</a> PUBLIC DOMAIN. </p>
<p>Public domain means information which is published and which is generally accessible or available to the 
public: </p>
<p>(1) Through sales at newsstands and bookstores; </p>
<p>(2) Through subscriptions which are available without restriction to any individual who desires to obtain 
or purchase the published information; </p>
<p>(3) Through second class mailing privileges granted by the U.S. Government; </p>
<p>(4) At libraries open to the public or from which the public can obtain documents; </p>
<p>(5) Through patents available at any patent office; </p>

this subchapter); </p>
<p>(8) Through fundamental research in science and engineering at accredited institutions of higher learning in 
the U.S. where the resulting information is ordinarily published and shared broadly in the scientific 
community. Fundamental research is defined to mean basic and applied research in science and 
engineering where the resulting information is ordinarily published and shared broadly within the 
scientific community, as distinguished from research the results of which are restricted for proprietary 
reasons or specific U.S. Government access and dissemination controls. University research will not be 
considered fundamental research if: </p>
<p>(i) The University or its researchers accept other restrictions on publication of scientific and technical 
information resulting from the project or activity, or </p>
<p>(ii) The research is funded by the U.S. Government and specific access and dissemination controls 
protecting information resulting from the research are applicable. </p>

1977 Comp. P. 79; 22 U.S.C. 2658) </p>
<p>&#167; <a name="122.1">122.1</a> Registration requirements. </p>
<p>(a) Any person who engages in the United States in the business of either manufacturing or exporting 
defense articles or furnishing defense services is required to register with the Office of Defense Trade 
Controls. Manufacturers who do not engage in exporting must nevertheless register. </p>
<p>(b) Exemptions. Registration is not required for: </p>
<p>(1) Officers and employees of the United States Government acting in an official capacity. </p>
<p>(2) Persons whose pertinent business activity is confined to the production of unclassified technical data 
only. </p>
<p>(3) Persons all of whose manufacturing and export activities are licensed under the Atomic Energy Act of 
1954, as amended. </p>
<p>(4) Persons who engage only in the fabrication of articles for experimental or scientific purpose, including 
research and development. </p>
<p>(c ) Purpose. Registration is primarily a means to provide the U.S. Government with necessary information 
on who is involved in certain manufacturing and exporting activities. Registration does not confer any 
export rights or privileges. It is generally a precondition to the issuance of any license or other approval 
under this subchapter. </p>
<p>&#167; <a name="122.2">122.2</a> Submission of registration statement. </p>
<p>(a) General. The Department of State Form DSP-9 (Registration Statement) and the transmittal letter 
required by paragraph (b) of this section must be submitted by an intended registrant with a payment by 
check or money order payable to the Department of State of one of the fees prescribed in 122.3(a) of this 
subchapter. The Registration Statement and transmittal letter must be signed by a senior officer who has 
been empowered by the intended registrant to sign such documents. The intended registrant shall also 
submit documentation that demonstrates that it is incorporated or otherwise authorized to do business in 
the United States. The Office of Defense Trade Controls will return to the sender any Registration 
Statement that is incomplete, or that is not accompanied by the required letter or payment of the proper 
registration fee. </p>
<p>(b) Transmittal letter. A letter of transmittal, signed by an authorized senior officer of the intended 
registrant, shall accompany each Registration Statement. </p>
<p>(1) The letter shall state whether the intended registrant, chief executive officer, president, 
vice-presidents, other senior officers or officials (e.g. comptroller, treasurer, general counsel) or any 
member of the board of directors: </p>
<p>(i) Has ever been indicted for or convicted of violating any of the U.S. criminal statutes enumerated in 
120.27 of this subchapter; or </p>
<p>(ii) Is ineligible to contract with, or to receive a license or other approval to import defense articles or 
defense services from, or to receive an export license or other approval from, any agency of the U.S. 
Government. </p>
<p>(2) The letter shall also declare whether the intended registrant is owned or controlled by foreign persons 
(as defined in 120.16 of this subchapter). If the intended registrant is owned or controlled by foreign 
persons, the letter shall also state whether the intended registrant is incorporated or otherwise authorized 
to engage in business in the United States. </p>
<p>(c ) Definition. For purposes of this section, ownership means that more than 50 percent of the outstanding 
voting securities of the firm are owned by one or more foreign persons. Control means that one or more 
foreign persons have the authority or ability to establish or direct the general policies or day-to-day 
operations of the firm. Control is presumed to exist where foreign persons own 25 percent or more of the 
outstanding voting securities if no U.S. persons control an equal or larger percentage. The standards for 
control specified in 22 CFR 60.2(c ) also provide guidance in determining whether control in fact exists. </p>
<p>&#167; <a name="122.3">122.3</a> Registration fees. </p>
<p>(a) A person who is required to register may do so for a period up to 5 years upon submission of a 
completed form DSP-9, transmittal letter, and payment of a fee as follows: </p>
<p>1 year $250 </p>
<p>2 years 500 </p>
<p>3 years 700 </p>
<p>4 years 850 </p>
<p>5 years 1,000 </p>
<p>(b) Lapse in registration. A registrant who fails to renew a registration and, after an intervening period, 
seeks to register again must pay registration fees for any part of such intervening period during which the 
registrant engaged in the business of manufacturing or exporting defense </p>
<p>articles or defense services. </p>
<p>(c ) Refund of fee. Fees paid in advance for future years of a multiple year registration will be refunded 
upon request if the registrant ceases to engage in the manufacture or export of defense articles and defense 
services. A request for a refund must be submitted to the Office of Defense Trade Controls prior to the 
beginning of any year for which a refund is claimed. </p>
<p>&#167; <a name="122.4">122.4</a> Notification of changes in information furnished by registrants. </p>
<p>(a) A registrant must, within five days of the event, notify the Office of Defense Trade Controls by 
registered mail if: </p>
<p>(1) Any of the persons referred to in 122.2(b) are indicted for or convicted of violating any of the U.S. 
criminal statutes enumerated in 120.27 of this subchapter, or become ineligible to contract with, or to 
receive a license or other approval to export or temporarily import defense articles or defense services 
from any agency of the U.S. government; or </p>
<p>(2) There is a material change in the information contained in the Registration Statement, including a 
change in the senior officers; the establishment, acquisition or divestment of a subsidiary or foreign 
affiliate; a merger; a change of location; or the dealing in an additional </p>
<p>category of defense articles or defense services. </p>
<p>(b) A registrant must notify the Office of Defense Trade Controls by registered mail at least 60 days in 
advance of any intended sale or transfer to a foreign person of ownership or control of the registrant or any 
entity thereof. Such notice does not relieve the registrant from obtaining the approval required under this 
subchapter for the export of defense articles or defense services to a foreign person, including the 
approval required prior to disclosing technical data. Such notice provides the Office of Defense Trade 
Controls with the information necessary to determine whether the authority of section 38(g)(6) of the Arms 
Export Control Act regarding licenses or other approvals for certain sales or transfers of articles or data 
should be invoked (see 120.10 and 126.1(e) of this subchapter). </p>
<p>(c ) The new entity formed when a registrant merges with another company or acquires, or is acquired by, 
another company or a subsidiary or division of another company shall advise the Office of Defense Trade 
Controls of the following: </p>
<p>(1) The new firm name and all previous firm names being disclosed; </p>
<p>(2) The registration number that will survive and those that are to be discontinued (if any); </p>
<p>(3) The license numbers of all approvals on which unshipped balances will be shipped under the 
surviving registration number, since any license not the subject of notification will be considered invalid; 
and </p>
<p>(4) Amendments to agreements approved by the Office of Defense Trade Controls to change the name of a 
party to those agreements. The registrant must, within 60 days of this notification, provide to the Office of 
Defense Trade Controls a signed copy of an amendment to each agreement signed by the new U.S. entity, 
the former U.S. licensor and the foreign licensee. Any agreements not so amended will be considered 
invalid. </p>
<p>(d) Prior approval by the Office of Defense Trade Controls is required for any amendment making a 
substantive change. </p>
<p>&#167; <a name="122.5">122.5</a> Maintenance of records by registrants. </p>
<p>(a) A person who is required to register must maintain records concerning the manufacture, acquisition and 
disposition of defense articles; the provision of defense services; and information on political 
contributions, fees, or commissions furnished or obtained, as required by part 130 of this subchapter. All 
such records must be maintained for a period of five years from the expiration of the license or other 
approval. The Director, Office of Defense Trade Controls, may prescribe a longer or shorter period in 
individual cases. </p>
<p>(b) Records maintained under this section shall be available at all times for inspection and copying by the 
Director, Office of Defense Trade Controls or a person designated by the Director (the Director of the 
Diplomatic Security Service or a person designated by the Director of the Diplomatic Security Service or 
another designee), or the Commissioner of the U.S. Customs Service or a person designated by the 
Commissioner. </p>

3 CFR 1977 Comp. 79; 22 U.S.C. 2658. </p>
<p>&#167; <a name="123.1">123.1</a> Requirement for export or temporary import licenses. </p>
<p>(a) Any person who intends to export or to import temporarily a defense article must obtain the approval 
of the Office of Defense Trade Controls prior to the export or temporary import, unless the export or 
temporary import qualifies for an exemption under the provisions of this subchapter. </p>
<p>Applications for export or temporary import must be made as follows: </p>
<p>(1) Applications for licenses for permanent export must be made on Form DSP-5 (unclassified); </p>
<p>(2) Applications for licenses for temporary export must be made on Form DSP-73 (unclassified); </p>
<p>(3) Applications for licenses for temporary import must be made on Form DSP-61 (unclassified); and </p>
<p>(4) Applications for the export or temporary import of classified defense articles or classified technical 
data must be made on Form DSP-85. </p>
<p>(b) Applications for Department of State export licenses must be confined to proposed exports of defense 
articles including technical data. </p>
<p>(c ) As a condition to the issuance of a license or other approval, the Office of Defense Trade Controls 
may require all pertinent documentary information regarding the proposed transaction and proper 
completion of the application form as follows: </p>
<p>(1) Form DSP-5, DSP-61, DSP-73, and DSP-85 applications must have an entry in each block where 
space is provided for an entry. All requested information must be provided. </p>
<p>(2) Attachments and supporting technical data or brochures should be submitted in seven collated copies. 
Two copies of any freight forwarder lists must be submitted. If the request is limited to renewal of a 
previous license or for the export of spare parts, only two sets of any attachment (including freight 
forwarder lists) and one copy of the previous license should be submitted. </p>
<p>(3) A certification letter signed by an empowered official must accompany all application submissions 
(see &#167; 126.13 of this subchapter). </p>
<p>(4) An application for a license under this part for the permanent export of defense articles sold 
commercially must be accompanied by a copy of a purchase order, letter of intent or other appropriate 
documentation. In cases involving the U.S. Foreign Military Sales program, three copies of the relevant 
Department of Defense Form 1513 are required, unless the procedures of &#167;126.4(c ) or &#167;126.6 of this 
subchapter are followed. </p>
<p>(5) Form DSP-83, duly executed, must accompany all license applications for the permanent export of 
significant military equipment, including classified hardware or classified technical data (see &#167; 123.10 
and &#167; 125.3 of this subchapter). </p>
<p>(6) A statement concerning the payment of political contributions, fees and commissions must accompany a 
permanent export application if the export involves defense articles or defense services valued in an 
amount of $500,000 or more and is being sold commercially to or for the use of the armed forces of a 
foreign country or international organization (see part 130 of this subchapter). </p>
<p>(d) Provisions for furnishing the type of defense services described in &#167;120.9(a) of this subchapter are 
contained in part 124 of this subchapter. Provisions for the export or temporary import of technical data 
and classified defense articles are contained in part 125 of this subchapter. </p>
<p>(e) A request for a license for the export of unclassified technical data (DSP-5) related to a classified 
defense article should specify any classified technical data or material that subsequently will be required 
for export in the event of a sale. </p>
<p>&#167; <a name="123.2">123.2</a> Import jurisdiction. </p>
<p>The Department of State regulates the temporary import of defense articles. Permanent imports of defense 
articles into the United States are regulated by the Department of the Treasury (see 27 CFR parts 47, 178 
and 179). </p>
<p>&#167; <a name="123.3">123.3</a> Temporary import licenses. </p>
<p>(a) A license (DSP-61) issued by the Office of Defense Trade Controls is required for the temporary 
import and subsequent export of unclassified defense articles, unless exempted from this requirement 
pursuant to 123.4. This requirement applies to: </p>
<p>(1) Temporary imports of unclassified defense articles that are to be returned directly to the country from 
which they were shipped to the United States; </p>
<p>(2) Temporary imports of unclassified defense articles in transit to a third country; </p>
<p>(b) A bond may be required as appropriate (see part 125 of this subchapter for license requirements for 
technical data and classified defense articles.) </p>
<p>&#167; <a name="123.4">123.4</a> Temporary import license exemptions. </p>
<p>(a) District Directors of Customs shall permit the temporary import (and subsequent export) without a 
license, for a period of up to 4 years, of unclassified U.S.-origin defense articles (including any article 
manufactured abroad pursuant to U.S. Government approval) if the article temporarily imported: </p>
<p>(1) Is serviced (e.g., inspection, testing, calibration or repair, including overhaul, reconditioning and 
one-to-one replacement of any defective articles, parts or components, but excluding any modification, 
enhancement, upgrade or other form of alteration or improvement that changes the basic performance of the 
article), and is subsequently returned to the country from which it was imported. Shipment may be made by 
the U.S. importer or a foreign government representative of the country from which the goods were 
imported; or </p>
<p>(2) Is to be enhanced, upgraded or incorporated into another article which has already been authorized by 
the Office of Defense Trade Controls for permanent export; or </p>
<p>(3) Is imported for the purpose of exhibition, demonstration or marketing in the United States and is 
subsequently returned to the country from which it was imported; or </p>
<p>(4) Has been rejected for permanent import by the Department of the Treasury and is being returned to the 
country from which it was shipped; or </p>
<p>(5) Is approved for such import under the U.S. Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program pursuant to an 
executed U.S. Department of Defense Letter of Offer and Acceptance (DD Form 1513). </p>
<p>Note: These Exceptions do not apply to shipments that transit the U.S. to or from Canada (see &#167; 123.19 and 
&#167; 126.5 of this subchapter for exceptions). </p>
<p>(b) District Directors of Customs shall permit the temporary import (but not the subsequent export) without 
a license of unclassified defense articles that are to be incorporated into another article, or modified, 
enhanced, upgraded, altered, improved or serviced in any other manner that changes the basic performance 
or productivity of the article prior to being returned to the country from which they were shipped or prior 
to being shipped to a third country. A DSP-5 is required for the reexport of such unclassified defense 
articles after incorporation into another article, modification, enhancement, upgrading, alteration or 
improvement. </p>
<p>(c ) Requirements. To use an exemption under &#167; 123.4 (a) or (b), the following criteria must be met: </p>
<p>(1) The importer must meet the eligibility requirements set forth in 120.1(b) of this subchapter; </p>
<p>(2) At the time of export, the ultimate consignee named on the Shipper's Export Declaration (SED) must be 
the same as the foreign consignee or end-user of record named at the time of import; and </p>
<p>(3) As stated in &#167; 126.1 of this subchapter, the temporary import must not be from or on behalf of a 
proscribed country listed in that section unless an exception has been granted in accordance with &#167; 126.3 
of this subchapter. </p>
<p>(d) Procedures. To the satisfaction of the District Director of Customs, the importer and exporter must 
comply with the following procedures: </p>
<p>(1) At the time of temporary import -- </p>
<p>(i) File and annotate the applicable U.S. Customs document (e.g., Form CF 3461, 7512, 7501, 7523 or 
3311) to read: ``This shipment is being imported in accordance with and under the authority of 22 CFR 
123.4(a) (identify subsection),'' and </p>
<p>(ii) Include, on the invoice or other appropriate documentation, a complete list and description of the 
defense article(s) being imported, including quantity and U.S. dollar value; and </p>
<p>(2) At the time of export, file with the District Director of Customs at the port of exit a Shipper's Export 
Declaration (Department of Commerce Form 7525-V) and include on the SED or as an attachment the 
following information: </p>
<p>(i) the U.S. Customs entry document number or a copy of the U.S. Customs documentation under which the 
article was imported; </p>
<p>(ii) the following statement: ``22 CFR (identify section) and 22 CFR 120.1(b) applicable.'' </p>
<p>&#167; <a name="123.5">123.5</a> Temporary export licenses. </p>
<p>(a) The Office of Defense Trade Controls may issue a license for the temporary export of unclassified 
defense articles (DSP-73). Such licenses are valid only if (1) the article will be exported for a period of 
less than 4 years and will be returned to the United States and (2) transfer of title will not occur during the 
period of temporary export. Accordingly, articles exported pursuant to a temporary export license may not 
be sold or otherwise permanently transferred to a foreign person while they are overseas under a 
temporary export license. A renewal of the license or other written approval must be obtained from the 
Office of Defense Trade Controls if the article is to remain outside the United States beyond the period for 
which the license is valid. </p>
<p>(b) Requirements. Defense articles authorized for temporary export under this section may be shipped only 
from a port in the United States where a District Director of Customs is available, or from a U.S. Post 
Office (see 39 CFR part 20), as appropriate. The license for temporary export must be presented to the 
District Director of Customs who, upon verification, will endorse the exit column on the reverse side of 
the license. In some instances of the temporary export of technical data (e.g postal shipments), 
self-endorsement will be necessary (see &#167;123.22(d)). The endorsed license for temporary export is to be 
retained by the licensee. In the case of a military aircraft or vessel exported under its own power, the 
endorsed license must be carried on board such vessel or aircraft as evidence that it has been duly 
authorized by the Department of State to leave the United States temporarily. </p>
<p>(c ) Upon the return to the United States of defense articles covered by a license for temporary export, the 
license will be endorsed in the entry column by the District Director of Customs. This procedure shall be 
followed for all exits and entries made during the period for which the </p>
<p>license is valid. The licensee must send the license to the Office of Defense Trade Controls immediately 
upon expiration or after the final return of the defense articles approved for export, whichever occurs first. </p>
<p>&#167; <a name="123.6">123.6</a> Foreign trade zones and U.S. Customs bonded warehouses. </p>
<p>Foreign trade zones and U.S. Customs bonded warehouses are considered integral parts of the United 
States for the purpose of this subchapter. An export license is therefore not required for shipment between 
the United States and a foreign trade zone or a Customs bonded warehouse. In the case of classified 
defense articles, the provisions of the Department of Defense Industrial Security Manual will apply. An 
export license is required for all shipments of articles on the U.S. Munitions List from foreign trade zones 
and U.S. Customs bonded warehouses to foreign countries, regardless of how the articles reached the zone 
or warehouse. </p>
<p>&#167; <a name="123.7">123.7</a> Exports to warehouses or distribution points outside the United States. </p>
<p>Unless the exemption under &#167;123.16(b)(1) is used, a license is required to export defense articles to a 
warehouse or distribution point outside the United States for subsequent resale and will normally be 
granted only if an agreement has been approved pursuant to &#167;124.14 of this subchapter. </p>
<p>&#167; <a name="123.8">123.8</a> Special controls on vessels, aircraft and satellites covered by the U.S. Munitions List. </p>
<p>(a) Transferring registration or control to a foreign person of any aircraft, vessel, or satellite on the U.S. 
Munitions List is an export for purposes of this subchapter and requires a license or written approval from 
the Office of Defense Trade Controls. This requirement applies whether the aircraft, vessel, or satellite is 
physically located in the United States or abroad. </p>
<p>(b) The registration in a foreign country of any aircraft, vessel or satellite covered by the U.S. Munitions 
List which is not registered in the United States but which is located in the United States constitutes an 
export. A license or written approval from the Office of Defense Trade Controls is therefore required. 
Such transactions may also require the prior approval of the Maritime Administration, the Federal 
Aviation </p>
<p>Administration or other agencies of the U.S. Government. </p>
<p>&#167; <a name="123.9">123.9</a> Country of ultimate destination and approval of reexports or retransfers. </p>
<p>(a) The country designated as the country of ultimate destination on an application for an export license, or 
on a Shipper's Export Declaration where an exemption is claimed under this subchapter, must be the 
country of ultimate end-use. The written approval of the Office of Defense Trade Controls must be 
obtained before reselling, transferring, transshipping, or disposing of a defense article to any end user, end 
use or destination other than as stated on the export license, or on the Shipper's Export Declaration in 
cases where an exemption is claimed under this subchapter. Exporters must ascertain the specific end-user 
and end-use prior to submitting an application to the Office of Defense Trade Controls or claiming an 
exemption under this subchapter. </p>
<p>(b) The exporter shall incorporate the following statement as an integral part of the bill of lading, and the 
invoice whenever defense articles on the U.S. Munitions List are to be exported: </p>
<p>These commodities are authorized by the U.S. Government for export only to (country of ultimate 
destination) for use by (end-user). They may not be transferred, transshipped on a non-continuous voyage, 
or otherwise be disposed of in any other country, either in their original form or after being incorporated 
into other end-items, without the prior written approval of the U.S. Department of State.'' </p>
<p>(c ) A U.S. person or a foreign person requesting approval for the reexport or retransfer, or change in 
end-use, of a defense article shall submit a written request which shall be subject to all the documentation 
required for a permanent export license (see &#167;123.1) and shall contain the following: </p>
<p>(1) The license number under which the defense article was previously authorized for export from the 
United States; </p>
<p>(2) A precise description, quantity and value of the defense article; </p>
<p>(3) A description of the new end-use; and </p>
<p>(4) Identification of the new end-user. </p>
<p>(d) The written approval of the Office of Defense Trade Controls must be obtained before reselling, 
transferring, transshipping on a non-continuous voyage, or disposing of a defense article in any country 
other than the country of ultimate destination, or anyone other than the authorized end-user, as stated on the 
Shipper's Export Declaration in cases where an exemption is claimed under this subchapter. </p>
<p>(e) Reexports or retransfers of U.S.-origin components incorporated into a foreign defense article to a 
government of a NATO country, or the governments of Australia or Japan, are authorized without the prior 
written approval of the Office of Defense Trade Controls, provided: </p>
<p>(1) The U.S.-origin components were previously authorized for export from the United States, either by a 
license or an exemption; </p>
<p>(2) The U.S.-origin components are not significant military equipment, the items are not major defense 
equipment sold under a contract in the amount of $14,000,000 ($14 million) or more; the articles are not 
defense articles or defense services sold under a contract in the amount of $50,000,000 ($50 million) or 
more; and are not identified in part 121 of this subchapter as Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) 
items; and </p>
<p>(3) The person reexporting the defense article must provide written notification to the Office of Defense 
Trade Controls of the retransfer not later than 30 days following the reexport. The notification must state 
the articles being reexported and the recipient government. </p>
<p>(4) In certain cases, the Director, Office of Defense Trade Controls, may place retransfer restrictions on a 
license prohibiting use of this exemption. </p>
<p>&#167; <a name="123.10">123.10</a> Non-transfer and use assurances. </p>
<p>(a) A nontransfer and use certificate (Form DSP-83) is required for the export of significant military 
equipment and classified articles including classified technical data. A license will not be issued until a 
completed Form DSP-83 has been received by the Office of Defense Trade Controls. This form is to be 
executed by the foreign consignee, foreign end-user, and the applicant. The certificate stipulates that, 
except as specifically authorized by prior written approval of the Department of State, the foreign 
consignee and foreign end-user will not reexport, resell or otherwise dispose of the significant military 
equipment enumerated in the application outside the country named as the location of the foreign end-use 
or to any other person. </p>
<p>(b) The Office of Defense Trade Controls may also require a DSP-83 for the export of any other defense 
articles or defense services. </p>
<p>(c ) When a DSP-83 is required for an export of any defense article or defense service to a 
non-governmental foreign end-user, the Office of Defense Trade Controls may require as a condition of 
issuing the license that the appropriate authority of the government of the country of ultimate destination 
also execute the certificate. </p>
<p>&#167; <a name="123.11">123.11</a> Movements of vessels and aircraft covered by the U.S. Munitions List outside the United States. </p>
<p>(a) A license issued by the Office of Defense Trade Controls is required whenever a privately-owned 
aircraft or vessel on the U.S. Munitions List makes a voyage outside the United States. </p>
<p>(b) Exemption. An export license is not required when a vessel or aircraft referred to in paragraph (a) of 
this section departs from the United States and does not enter the territorial waters or airspace of a foreign 
country if no defense articles are carried as cargo. Such a vessel or aircraft may not enter the territorial 
waters or airspace of a foreign country before returning to the United States, or carry as cargo any defense 
article, without a temporary export license (Form DSP-73) from the Department of State. (See &#167;123.5.) </p>
<p>&#167; <a name="123.12">123.12</a> Shipments between U.S. possessions. </p>
<p>An export license is not required for the shipment of defense articles between the United States, the 
Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and U.S. possessions. A license is required, however, for the export of 
defense articles from these areas to foreign countries. </p>
<p>&#167; <a name="123.13">123.13</a> Domestic aircraft shipments via a foreign country. </p>
<p>A license is not required for the shipment by air of a defense article from one location in the United States 
to another location in the United States via a foreign country. The pilot of the aircraft must, however, file a 
written statement with the District Director of Customs at the port of exit in the United States. The original 
statement must be filed at the time of exit with the District Director of Customs. A duplicate must be filed 
at the port of reentry with the District Director of Customs, who will duly endorse it and transmit it to the 
District Director of Customs at the port of exit. The statement will be as follows: </p>
<p>Domestic Shipment Via a Foreign Country of Articles on the U.S. Munitions List </p>
<p>Under penalty according to Federal law, the undersigned certifies and warrants that all the information in 
this document is true and correct, and that the equipment listed below is being shipped from (U.S. port of 
exit) via (foreign country) to (U.S. port of entry), which is the final destination in the United States. </p>

<p>Date:. </p>
<p>&#167; <a name="123.14">123.14</a> Import certificate/delivery verification procedure. </p>
<p>(a) The Import Certificate/Delivery Verification Procedure is designed to assure that a commodity 
imported into the territory of those countries participating in IC/DV procedures will not be diverted, 
transshipped, or reexported to another destination except in accordance with export control regulations of 
the importing country. </p>
<p>(b) Exports. The Office of Defense Trade Controls may require the IC/DV procedure on proposed exports 
of defense articles to non-government entities in those countries participating in IC/DV procedures. In such 
cases, U.S. exporters must submit both an export license application (the completed Form DSP-5) and the 
original Import Certificate, which must be provided and authenticated by the government of the importing 
country. This document verifies that the foreign importer complied with the import regulations of the 
government of the importing country and that the importer declared the intention not to divert, transship or 
reexport the material described therein without the prior approval of that government. After delivery of the 
commodities to the foreign consignee, the Department of State may also require U.S. exporters to furnish 
Delivery Verification documentation from the government of the importing country. This documentation 
verifies that the delivery was in accordance with the terms of the approved export license. Both the Import 
Certificate and the Delivery Verification must be furnished to the U.S. exporter by the foreign importer. </p>
<p>(c ) Triangular transactions. When a transaction involves three or more countries that have adopted the 
IC/DV procedure, the governments of these countries may stamp a triangular symbol on the Import 
Certificate. This symbol is usually placed on the Import Certificate when the applicant for the Import 
Certificate (the importer) states either (1) that there is uncertainty whether the items covered by the Import 
Certificate will be imported into the country issuing the Import Certificate; (2) that he or she knows that the 
items will not be imported into the country issuing the Import Certificate; or (3) that, if the items are to be 
imported into the country issuing the Import Certificate, they will subsequently be reexported to another 
destination. All parties, including the ultimate consignee in the country of ultimate destination, must be 
shown on the completed Import Certificate. </p>
<p>&#167; <a name="123.15">123.15</a> Congressional notification for licenses. </p>
<p>All exports of major defense equipment, as defined in &#167;120.8 of this subchapter, sold under a contract in 
the amount of $14,000,000 or more, or exports of defense articles and defense services sold under a 
contract in the amount of $50,000,000 or more, may take place only after the Office of Defense Trade 
Controls notifies the exporter through issuance of a license or other approval that 30 calendar days have 
elapsed since receipt by the Congress of the certification required by 22 U.S.C. 2776(c)(1) and that 
Congress has not enacted a joint resolution prohibiting the export. Persons who intend to export defense 
articles and defense services pursuant to any exemption in this subchapter (e.g., &#167;126.5 of this subchapter) 
under the circumstances described in the first sentence of this subsection must notify the Office of Defense 
Trade Controls by letter of the intended export and, prior to transmittal to Congress, provide a signed 
contract and a DSP-83 signed by the applicant, the foreign consignee and end-user. </p>
<p>&#167; <a name="123.16">123.16</a> Exemptions of general applicability. </p>
<p>(a) The following exemptions apply to exports of unclassified defense articles for which no approval is 
needed from the Office of Defense Trade Controls. These exemptions do not apply to: Proscribed 
destinations under &#167;126.1 of this subchapter; exports for which Congressional notification is required; 
MTCR articles; Significant Military Equipment (SME); and may not be used by persons who are generally ineligible as described in &#167;120.1(c ) of 
this subchapter. All shipments of defense articles, including those to and from Canada, require a Shippers 
Export Declaration (SED). If the defense article is exempt from licensing, the SED must cite the 
exemption. Refer to &#167;123.22(c ) for Shipper's Export Declaration requirements. </p>
<p>(b) The following exports are exempt from the licensing requirements of this subchapter: </p>
<p>(1) District Directors of Customs shall permit the export without a license of defense articles being 
exported in furtherance of an approved manufacturing license agreement, technical assistance agreement or 
distribution agreement provided that: </p>
<p>(i) The defense articles to be exported support the activity and must be identified by item, quantity and 
value in the agreement; and </p>
<p>(ii) Any provisos or limitations placed on the authorized agreement are adhered to; and </p>
<p>(iii) The exporter certifies on the Shipper's Export Declaration that the export is exempt from the licensing 
requirements of this subchapter. This is done by writing, ``22 CFR 123.16(b)(1) and AG (identify 
agreement number) applicable and </p>
<p>(iv) The total value of all shipments does not exceed the value authorized in the agreement. </p>
<p>(v) In the case of distribution agreements, export must be made directly to the approved foreign distributor. </p>
<p>(2) District Directors of Customs shall permit the export of components or spare parts (for exemptions for

single transaction and: </p>
<p>(i) The components or spare parts are being exported to support a defense article previously authorized for 
export; and </p>
<p>(ii) The spare parts or components are not going to a distributor, but to a previously approved end-user of 
the defense articles; and </p>
<p>(iii) The spare parts or components are not to be used to enhance the capability of the defense article; </p>

<p>(3) District Directors of Customs shall permit the export without a license, of packing cases specially 
designed to carry defense articles. </p>
<p>(4) District Directors of Customs shall permit the export without a license, of unclassified models or 
mock-ups of defense articles, provided that such models or mock-ups are nonoperable and do not reveal 
any technical data in excess of that which is exempted from the licensing requirements of &#167;125.4(b) of this 
subchapter and do not contain components covered by the U.S. Munitions List (see &#167;120.6(b) of this 
subchapter). Some models or mockups built to scale or constructed of original materials can reveal 
technical data. U.S. persons who avail themselves of this exemption must provide a written certification to 
the District Director of Customs that these conditions are met. This exemption does not imply that the 
Office of Defense Trade Controls will approve the export of any defense articles for which models or 
mocks-ups have been exported pursuant to this exemption. </p>
<p>(5) District Directors of Customs shall permit the temporary export without a license of unclassified 
defense articles to any public exhibition, trade show, air show or related event if that article has 
previously been licensed for a public exhibition, trade show, air show or related event and the license is 
still valid. U.S. persons who avail themselves of this exemption must provide a written certification to the 
District Director of Customs that these conditions are met. </p>

transaction. </p>
<p>(b) District Directors of Customs shall permit the export without a license of nonautomatic firearms 
covered by Category I(a) of &#167;121.1 of this subchapter if they were manufactured in or before 1898, or are 
replicas of such firearms. </p>
<p>(c ) District Directors of Customs shall permit U.S. persons to export temporarily from the United States 
without a license not more than three nonautomatic firearms in Category I(a) of &#167;121.1 of this subchapter 
and not more than 1,000 cartridges therefor, provided that: </p>
<p>(1) A declaration by the U.S. person and an inspection by a customs officer is made; </p>
<p>(2) The firearms and accompanying ammunition must be with the U.S. person's baggage or effects, whether 
accompanied or unaccompanied (but not mailed); and </p>
<p>(3) They must be for that person's exclusive use and not for reexport or other transfer of ownership. The 
foregoing exemption is not applicable to a crew-member of a vessel or aircraft unless the crew-member 
declares the firearms to a Customs officer upon each departure from the United States, and declares that it 
is his or her intention to return the article(s) on each return to the United States. It is also not applicable to 
the personnel referred to in &#167;123.18. </p>
<p>(d) District Directors of Customs shall permit a foreign person to export without a license such firearms in 
Category I(a) of &#167;121.1 of this subchapter and ammunition therefor as the foreign person brought into the 
United States under the provisions of 27 CFR 178.115(d). (The latter provision specifically excludes from 
the definition of importation the bringing into the United States of firearms and ammunition by certain 
foreign persons for specified purposes). </p>
<p>(e) District Directors of Customs shall permit U.S. persons to export without a license ammunition for 
nonautomatic firearms referred to in paragraph (a) of this section if the quantity does not exceed 1,000 
cartridges (or rounds) in any shipment. The ammunition must also be for personal use and not for resale or 
other transfer of ownership. The foregoing exemption is also not applicable to the personnel referred to in 
&#167;123.18. </p>
<p>&#167; <a name="123.18">123.18</a> Firearms for personal use of members of the U.S. Armed Forces and civilian employees of the 
U.S. Government. </p>
<p>The following exemptions apply to members of the U.S. Armed Forces and civilian employees of the U.S. 
Government who are U.S. persons (both referred to herein as personnel). The exemptions apply only to 
such personnel if they are assigned abroad for extended duty. These exemptions do not apply to 
dependents. </p>
<p>(a) Firearms. District Directors of Customs shall permit nonautomatic firearms in Category I(a) of &#167;121.1 
of this subchapter and parts therefor to be exported, except by mail, from the United States without a 
license if: </p>
<p>(1) They are consigned to servicemen's clubs abroad for uniformed members of the U.S. Armed Forces; 
or, </p>
<p>(2) In the case of a uniformed member of the U.S. Armed Forces or a civilian employee of the Department

are accompanied by a written authorization from the commanding officer concerned; or </p>
<p>(3) In the case of other U.S. Government employees, they are for personal use and not for resale or other 
transfer of ownership, and the Chief of the U.S. Diplomatic Mission or his designee in the country of 
destination has approved in writing to Department of State the import of the specific types and quantities 
of firearms into that country. The exporter shall provide a copy of this written statement to the District 
Director of Customs. </p>
<p>(b) Ammunition. District Directors of Customs shall permit not more than 1,000 cartridges (or rounds) of 
ammunition for the firearms referred to in paragraph (a) of this section to be exported (but not mailed) 
from the United States without a license when the firearms are on the person of the owner or with his 
baggage or effects, whether accompanied or unaccompanied (but not mailed). </p>
<p>&#167; <a name="123.19">123.19</a> Canadian and Mexican border shipments. </p>
<p>A shipment originating in Canada or Mexico which incidentally transits the United States en route to a 
delivery point in the same country that originated the shipment is exempt from the requirement for an in 
transit license. </p>
<p>&#167; <a name="123.20">123.20</a> Nuclear materials. </p>
<p>(a) The provisions of this subchapter do not apply to equipment in Category VI(e) and Category XVI of 
&#167;121.1 of this subchapter to the extent such equipment is under the export control of the Department of 
Energy or the Nuclear Regulatory Commission pursuant to the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, 
and the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Act of 1978. </p>
<p>(b) A license for the export of any machinery, device, component, equipment, or technical data relating to 
equipment referred to in Category VI(e) will not be granted unless the proposed export comes within the 
scope of an existing Agreement for Cooperation for Mutual Defense Purposes concluded pursuant to the 
Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, with the government of the country to which the article is to be 
exported. Licenses may be granted in the absence of such an agreement only (1) if the proposed export 
involves an article which is identical to that in use in an unclassified civilian nuclear power plant, (2) if 
the proposed export has no relationship to naval nuclear propulsion, and (3) if it is not for use in a naval 
propulsion plant. </p>
<p>&#167; <a name="123.21">123.21</a> Duration, renewal and disposition of licenses. </p>
<p>(a) A license is valid for four years. The license expires when the total value or quantity authorized has 
been shipped or when the date of expiration has been reached, whichever occurs first. Defense articles to 
be shipped thereafter require a new application and license. The new application should refer to the 
expired license. It should not include references to any defense articles other than those of the unshipped 
balance of the expired license. </p>
<p>(b) Unused, expired, expended, suspended, or revoked licenses must be returned immediately to the 
Department of State. </p>
<p>&#167; <a name="123.22">123.22</a> Filing of export licenses and Shipper's Export Declarations with District Directors of Customs. </p>
<p>(a) The exporter must deposit the license with the District Director of Customs at the port of exit before 
shipment, unless paragraph (d) of this section or &#167;125.9 applies (for exports by mail, see &#167;123.24). 
Licenses for temporary export or temporary import are to be retained by the exporter and presented to the 
District Director of Customs at the time of import or export for endorsement. If necessary, the export may 
be made through a port other than the one designated on the license if the exporter complies with the 
procedures established by the U.S. Customs Service. Every license will be returned to the Office of 
Defense Trade Controls by the District Director of Customs when the total value or quantity authorized has 
been shipped or when the date of expiration is reached, whichever occurs first. </p>
<p>(b) Before shipping any defense article, the exporter must also file a Shipper's Export Declaration with the 
District Director of Customs at the port of exit (unless otherwise exempt from filing a Shipper's Export 
Declaration). The District Director of Customs at the port of exit must authenticate the Shipper's Export 
Declaration, and endorse the license to show the shipments actually made. The District Director of 
Customs will return a copy of each authenticated Shipper's Export Declaration to the Office of Defense 
Trade Controls. </p>
<p>(c ) Except for the export of unclassified technical data, an exporter must file a Shipper's Export 
Declaration with District Directors of Customs or Postmasters in those cases in which no export license is 
required because of an exemption under this subchapter. The exporter must certify that the export is exempt 
from the licensing requirements of this subchapter by writing 22 CFR (identify section) and 22 CFR 
120.1(b) applicable on the Shipper's Export Declaration, and by identifying the section under which an 
exemption is claimed. A copy of each such declaration must be mailed immediately by the exporter to the 
Office of Defense Trade Controls. </p>
<p>(d) A Shipper's Export Declaration is not required for exports of unclassified technical data. Exporters 
shall notify the Office of Defense Trade Controls of the initial export of the data by either returning the 
license after self endorsement or by sending a letter to the Office of Defense Trade Controls. The letter 
shall provide the method, date, license number and airway bill number (if applicable) of the shipment. The 
letter must be signed by an empowered official of the company and provided to the Office of Defense 
Trade Controls within thirty days of the initial export. </p>
<p>(e) If a license for the export of unclassified defense articles, including technical data, is used but not 
endorsed by U.S. Customs or a Postmaster for whatever reason (e.g., electronic transmission, 
unavailability of Customs officer or Postmaster, etc.), the person exporting the article must self-endorse 
the license, showing when and how the export took place. Every license shall also be returned by the 
exporter to the Office of Defense Trade Controls when the total value or quantity authorized has been 
shipped or when the date of expiration is reached, whichever occurs first. </p>
<p>&#167; <a name="123.23">123.23</a> Monetary value of shipments. </p>
<p>District Directors of Customs shall permit the shipment of defense articles identified on any license when 
the total value of the export does not exceed the aggregate monetary value (not quantity) stated on the 
license by more than ten percent, provided that the additional monetary value does not make the total value 
of the license or other approval for the export of any major defense equipment sold under a contract reach 
$14,000,000 or more, and provided that the additional monetary value does not make defense articles or 
defense services sold under a contract reach the amount of $50,000,000 or more. </p>
<p>&#167; <a name="123.24">123.24</a> Shipments by mail. </p>
<p>A Shipper's Export Declaration must be authenticated before an article is actually sent abroad by mail (see 
&#167;123.22(d)). The postmaster or exporter will endorse each license to show the shipments made. Every 
license must be returned by the exporter to the Office of Defense Trade Controls upon completion of the 
mailings. </p>
<p>&#167; <a name="123.25">123.25</a> Amendments to licenses. </p>
<p>(a) The Office of Defense Trade Controls may approve an amendment to a license for permanent export, 
temporary export and temporary import of unclassified defense articles. A suggested format is available 
from the Office of Defense Trade Controls. </p>
<p>(b) The following types of amendments to a license that will be considered: Addition of U.S. freight 
forwarder or U.S. consignor; change due to an obvious typographical error; change in source of 
commodity; and change of foreign intermediate consignee if that party is only transporting the equipment 
and will not process (e.g., integrate, modify) the equipment. For changes in U.S. dollar value see &#167;123.23. </p>
<p>(c ) The following types of amendments to a license will not be approved: Additional quantity, changes in 
commodity, country of ultimate destination, end-use or end-user, foreign consignee and/or extension of 
duration. The foreign intermediate consignee may only be amended if that party is acting as freight 
forwarder and the export does not involve technical data. A new license is required for these changes. Any 
new license submission must reflect only the unshipped balance of quantity and dollar value. </p>
<p>&#167; <a name="123.26">123.26</a> Recordkeeping requirement for exemptions. </p>
<p>When an exemption is claimed for the export of unclassified technical data, the exporter must maintain a 
record of each such export. The business record should include the following information: A description 
of the unclassified technical data, the name of the recipient end-user, the date and time of the export, and 
the method of transmission. </p>
<p>&#167; <a name="123.27">123.27</a> Temporary export for personal use of Category XIII(b)(1) cryptographic products. </p>
<p>(a) District Directors of Customs may permit a U.S. citizen or a U.S. person who is a lawful permanent 
resident as defined by 8 U.S.C. 1101 (a)(20) to temporarily export from the United States without a license 
not more than one each of any unclassified Category XIII(b)(1) cryptographic hardware product and not 
more than a single copy of each type of unclassified Category XIII(b)(1) cryptographic software product 
provided that: </p>
<p>(1) The software product(s) are to be used only on a simultaneously temporarily exported Category 
XIII(b)(1) hardware product or a simultaneously exported item on the Commerce Control List (CCL); and </p>
<p>(2) The cryptographic products covered by Category XIII(b)(1) are not destined for export to a destination 
listed in Sec. &#167;126.1 of the ITAR (22 CFR126.1) which is prohibited by a United Nations Security 
Council Resolution or to which the export (or for which the issuance of a license for the export) would be 
prohibited by a U.S. statute (e.g., by Section 49 of the Arms Export Control Act, 22 U.S.C. 2780, to 
countries that have been determined to have repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism 
-- currently Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Sudan and Syria); and </p>
<p>(3)(i) The encryption products remain in the possession of the exporting person or the possession of 
another U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident traveling with him/her, or for their exclusive use and not 
for copying, demonstration, marketing, sale, re-export or transfer of ownership or control. The export of 
cryptographic products identified in Category XIII(b)(1) in any other circumstances, for example, those in 
which a person contemplates sales, marketing, or demonstration must be licensed in accordance with 
policies and procedures in this subchapter. </p>
<p>(ii) Special definition. For purposes of paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section, a product is considered to be in 
the possession of the exporter if: </p>
<p>(A) The exporter takes normal precautions to ensure the security of the product by locking the product in a 
hotel room, safe, or other comparably secure location; and </p>
<p>(B) While in transit, the exporter keeps the product in his/her carry-on luggage or locked in baggage 
accompanying the exporter which has been checked with the carrier; and </p>
<p>(4) At the time of export from the U.S. and import into the U.S., the cryptographic products are with the 
individual's accompanying baggage or effects. They may not be exported or imported in unaccompanied 
baggage, mailed or transmitted by any other means (e.g., electronically); and, the cryptographic products 
must be returned to the U.S. at the completion of the stay abroad; and </p>
<p>(5) The exporter, upon request of a U.S. Customs officer, will submit the products to inspection at the time 
of export and/or import. </p>
<p>(b) Use of this exemption requires the exporter, in lieu of filing a Shippers' Export Declaration, to 
maintain, for a period of 5 years form the day of each temporary export, a record of that temporary export 
and the subsequent import. Included in this record must be a self certification that the individual complied 
with the conditions of paragraph (a) of this section and a self certification that he/she has no reason to 
believe that any of the temporarily exported cryptographic products were stolen, lost, copied, sold or 
otherwise compromised or transferred while abroad. The record should include the following information: 
A description of the unclassified cryptographic products; the countries entered, including the dates of entry 
and exit for each foreign country; and, the dates of temporary export from and subsequent import into the 
United States. </p>
<p>(c ) In any instance where a product exported under this exemption is stolen, lost, copied, sold or 
otherwise compromised or transferred while abroad, the exporting person must, within 10 days of hi/her 
return to the United States, report the incident to the Department of State, Office of Defense Trade 
Controls, Washington, D.C. 20520-0602. Also, any person who knows or has reason to know that 
cryptographic products exported under this exemption are being transferred, exported, or used for any 
other activity which must be licensed or otherwise authorized in writing by the Department of State, should 
immediately inform the Department of State, Office of Defense Trade Controls, Washington, D.C. 
205020-0602. </p>

<p>&#167;<a name="124.1">124.1</a> Manufacturing license agreements and technical assistance agreements. </p>
<p>(a) The approval of the Office of Defense Trade Controls must be obtained before the defense services 
described in &#167;120.9(a) of this subchapter may be furnished. In order to obtain such approval, the U.S. 
person must submit a proposed agreement to the Office of Defense Trade Controls. Such agreements are 
generally characterized as either Manufacturing license agreements, technical assistance agreements, 
distribution agreements or off-shore procurement agreements, and may not enter into force without the 
prior written approval of the Office of Defense Trade Controls. Once approved, the defense services 
described in the agreements may generally be provided without further licensing in accordance with Secs. 
124.3 and 125.4(b)(2) of this subchapter. The requirements of this section apply whether or not technical 
data is to be disclosed or used in the performance of the defense services described in &#167;120.9(a) of this 
subchapter (e.g., all the information relied upon by the U.S. person in performing the defense service is in 
the public domain or is otherwise exempt from the licensing requirements of this subchapter pursuant to 
&#167;125.4 of this subchapter). This requirement also applies to the training of any foreign military forces, 
regular and irregular, in the use of defense articles. Technical assistance agreements must be submitted in 
such cases. In exceptional cases, The Office of Defense Trade Controls, upon written request, will 
consider approving the provision of defense services described in &#167;120.9(a) of this subchapter by granting 
a license under part 125 of this subchapter. Also, see &#167;126.8 of this subchapter for the requirements for 
prior approval of proposals relating to significant military equipment. </p>
<p>(b) Classified Articles. Copies of approved agreements involving the release of classified defense articles 
will be forwarded by the Office of Defense Trade Controls to the Defense Investigative Service of the 
Department of Defense. </p>
<p>(c ) Amendments. Changes to the scope of approved agreements, including modifications, upgrades, or 
extensions must be submitted for approval. The amendments may not enter into force until approved by the 
Office of Defense Trade Controls. </p>
<p>(d) Minor Amendments. Amendments which only alter delivery or performance schedules, or other minor 
administrative amendments which do not affect in any manner the duration of the agreement or the clauses 
or information which must be included in such agreements because of the requirements of this part, do not 
have to be submitted for approval. One copy of all such minor amendments must be submitted to the Office 
of Defense Trade Controls within thirty days after they are concluded. </p>
<p>&#167;<a name="124.2">124.2</a> Exemptions for training and military service. </p>
<p>(a) Technical assistance agreements are not required for the provision of training in the basic operation 
and maintenance of defense articles lawfully exported or authorized for export to the same recipient. This 
does not include training in intermediate and depot level maintenance. </p>
<p>(b) Services performed as a member of the regular military forces of a foreign nation by U.S. persons who 
have been drafted into such forces are not deemed to be defense services for purposes of &#167;120.9 of this 
subchapter. </p>
<p>&#167;<a name="124.3">124.3</a> Exports of technical data in furtherance of an agreement. </p>
<p>(a) Unclassified technical data. District Directors of Customs or postal authorities shall permit the export 
without a license of unclassified technical data if the export is in furtherance of a manufacturing license or 
technical assistance agreement which has been approved in writing by the Office of Defense Trade 
Controls and the technical data being exported does not exceed the scope or limitations of the relevant 
agreement. The U.S. party to the agreement must certify on the Shippers Export Declaration that the export 
does not exceed the scope of the agreement and any limitations imposed pursuant to this part. The approval 
of the Office of Defense Trade Controls must be obtained for the export of any unclassified technical data 
which may exceed the terms of the agreement. </p>
<p>(b) Classified technical data. The export of classified information in furtherance of an approved 
manufacturing license or technical assistance agreement which provides for the transmittal of classified 
information does not require further approval from the Office of Defense Trade Controls when: </p>
<p>(1) The United States party certifies to the Department of Defense transmittal authority that the classified 
information does not exceed the technical or product limitations in the agreement; and </p>
<p>(2) The U.S. party complies with the requirements of the Department of Defense Industrial Security 
Manual concerning the transmission of classified information and any other requirements of cognizant U.S. 
departments or agencies. </p>
<p>&#167;<a name="124.4">124.4</a> Deposit of signed agreements with the Office of Defense Trade Controls. </p>
<p>The United States party to a manufacturing license or a technical assistance agreement must file one copy 
of the concluded agreement with the Office of Defense Trade Controls not later than 30 days after it enters 
into force. </p>
<p>&#167;<a name="124.5">124.5</a> Proposed agreements that are not concluded. </p>
<p>The United States party to any proposed manufacturing license agreement or technical assistance 
agreement must inform the Office of Defense Trade Controls if a decision is made not to conclude the 
agreement. The information must be provided within 60 days of the date of the decision. These 
requirements apply only if the approval of the Office of Defense Trade Controls was obtained for the 
agreement to be concluded (with or without any provisos). </p>
<p>&#167;<a name="124.6">124.6</a> Termination of manufacturing license agreements and technical assistance agreements. </p>
<p>The U. S. party to a manufacturing license or a technical assistance agreement must inform the Office of

prior to the expiration date of such agreement. </p>
<p>&#167;<a name="124.7">124.7</a> Information required in all manufacturing license agreements and technical assistance agreements. </p>
<p>The following information must be included in all proposed manufacturing license agreements and 
technical assistance agreements. The information should be provided in terms which are as precise as 
possible. If the applicant believes that a clause or that required information is not relevant or necessary, 
the applicant may request the omission of the clause or information. The transmittal letter accompanying 
the agreement must state the reasons for any proposed variation in the clauses or required information. </p>
<p>(1) The agreement must describe the defense article to be manufactured and all defense articles to be 
exported, including any test and support equipment or advanced materials. They should be described by 
military nomenclature, contract number, National Stock Number, nameplate data, or other specific 
information. Supporting technical data or brochures should be submitted in seven copies. Only defense 
articles listed in the agreement will be eligible for export under the exemption in &#167;123.16(b)(1) of this 
subchapter. </p>
<p>(2) The agreement must specifically describe the assistance and technical data, including the design and

<p>Authority: Section 2 and 38, Pub. L. 90-629, 90 Stat. 744 (22 U.S.C. 2752, 2778); E.O. 11958, 42 F.R. 
4311, 3 CFR, 1977 Comp. P.79; 22 U.S.C. 2658. </p>
<p>&#167;<a name="125.1">125.1</a> Exports subject to this part. </p>
<p>(a) The controls of this part apply to the export of technical data and the export of classified defense 
articles. Information which is in the public domain (see &#167;120.11 of this subchapter and &#167; 125.4(b)(13)) is 
not subject to the controls of this subchapter. </p>
<p>(b) A license for the export of technical data and the exemptions in 125.4 may not be used for foreign 
production purposes or for technical assistance unless the approval of the Office of Defense Trade 
Controls has been obtained. Such approval is generally provided only pursuant to the procedures specified 
in part 124 of this subchapter. </p>
<p>(c) Technical data authorized for export may not be reexported, transferred or diverted from the country of 
ultimate end-use or from the authorized foreign end-user (as designated in the license or approval for 
export) or disclosed to a national of another country without the prior written approval of the Office of 
Defense Trade Controls. </p>
<p>(d) The controls of this part apply to the exports referred to in paragraph (a) of this section regardless of 
whether the person who intends to export the technical data produces or manufactures defense articles if 
the technical data is determined by the Office of Defense Trade Controls to be subject to the controls of 
this subchapter. </p>
<p>(e) The provisions of this subchapter do not apply to technical data related to articles in Category VI(e) 
and Category XVI. The export of such data is controlled by the Department of Energy and the Nuclear 
Regulatory Commission pursuant to the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, and the Nuclear 
Non-Proliferation Act of 1978. </p>
<p>&#167;<a name="125.2">125.2</a> Exports of unclassified technical data. </p>
<p>(a) A license (DSP-5) is required for the export of unclassified technical data unless the export is exempt 
from the licensing requirements of this subchapter. In the case of a plant visit, details of the proposed 
discussions must be transmitted to the Office of Defense Trade Controls for an appraisal of the technical 
data. Seven copies of the technical data or the details of the discussion must be provided. </p>
<p>(b) Patents. A license issued by the Office of Defense Trade Controls is required for the export of 
technical data whenever the data exceeds that which is used to support a domestic filing of a patent 
application or to support a foreign filing of a patent application whenever no domestic application has 
been filed. Requests for the filing of patent applications in a foreign country, and requests for the filing of 
amendments, modifications or supplements to such patents, should follow the regulations of the U.S. Patent 
and Trademark Office in accordance with 37 CFR part 5. The export of technical data to support the filing 
and processing of patent applications in foreign countries is subject to regulations issued by the U.S. Patent 
and Trademark Office pursuant to 35 U.S.C. 184. </p>
<p>(c ) Disclosures. Unless otherwise expressly exempted in this subchapter, a license is required for the 
oral, visual or documentary disclosure of technical data by U.S. persons to foreign persons. A license is 
required regardless of the manner in which the technical data is transmitted (e.g., in person, by telephone, 
correspondence, electronic means, etc.). A license is required for such disclosures by U.S. persons in 
connection with visits to foreign diplomatic missions and consular offices. </p>
<p>&#167;<a name="125.3">125.3</a> Exports of classified technical data and classified defense articles. </p>
<p>(a) A request for authority to export defense articles, including technical data, classified by a foreign 
government or pursuant to Executive Order 12356, successor orders, or other legal authority must be 
submitted to the Office of Defense Trade Controls for approval. The application must contain full details 
of the proposed transaction. It should also list the facility security clearance code of all U.S. parties on the 
license and include the Defense Investigative Service cognizant security office of the party responsible for 
packaging the commodity for shipment. A nontransfer and use certificate (Form DSP-83) executed by the 
applicant, foreign consignee, end-user and an authorized representative of the foreign government involved 
will be required. </p>
<p>(b) Classified technical data which is approved by the Office of Defense Trade Controls either for export 
or reexport after a temporary import will be transferred or disclosed only in accordance with the 
requirements in the Department of Defense Industrial Security Manual. Any other requirements imposed by 
cognizant U.S. departments and agencies must also be satisfied. </p>
<p>(c ) The approval of the Office of Defense Trade Controls must be obtained for the export of technical data 
by a U.S. person to a foreign person in the U.S. or in a foreign country unless the proposed export is 
exempt under the provisions of this subchapter. </p>
<p>(d) All communications relating to a patent application covered by an invention secrecy order are to be 
addressed to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (see 37 CFR 5.11). </p>
<p>&#167;<a name="125.4">125.4</a> Exemptions of general applicability. </p>
<p>(a) The following exemptions apply to exports of unclassified technical data for which approval is not 
needed from the Office of Defense Trade Controls. These exemptions, except for paragraph (b)(13) of this 
section, do not apply to exports to proscribed destinations under &#167;126.1 of this subchapter or for persons 
considered generally ineligible underv&#167; 120.1(c ) of this subchapter. The exemptions are also not 
applicable for purposes of establishing offshore procurement arrangements. If &#167;126.8 of this subchapter 
requirements are applicable, they must be met before an exemption under this section may be used. 
Transmission of classified information must comply with the requirements of the Department of Defense 
Industrial Security Manual and the exporter must certify to the transmittal authority that the technical data 
does not exceed the technical limitation of the authorized export. </p>
<p>(b) The following exports are exempt from the licensing requirements of this subchapter. </p>
<p>(1) Technical data, including classified information, to be disclosed pursuant to an official written request 
or directive from the U.S. Department of Defense; </p>
<p>(2) Technical data, including classified information, in furtherance of a manufacturing license or technical 
assistance agreement approved by the Department of State under part 124 of this subchapter and which 
meet the requirements of &#167;124.3 of this subchapter; </p>
<p>(3) Technical data, including classified information, in furtherance of a contract between the exporter and 
an agency of the U.S. Government, if the contract provides for the export of the data and such data does not 
disclose the details of design, development, production, or manufacture of any defense article; </p>
<p>(4) Copies of technical data, including classified information, previously authorized for export to the same 
recipient. Revised copies of such technical data are also exempt if they pertain to the identical defense 
article, and if the revisions are solely editorial and do not add to the content of technology previously 
exported or authorized for export to the same recipient; </p>
<p>(5) Technical data, including classified information, in the form of basic operations, maintenance, and 
training information relating to a defense article lawfully exported or authorized for export to the same 
recipient. Intermediate or depot-level repair and maintenance information may be exported only under a 
license or agreement approved specifically for that purpose; </p>
<p>(6) Technical data, including classified information, related to firearms not in excess of caliber .50 and 
ammunition for such weapons, except detailed design, development, production or manufacturing 
information; </p>
<p>(7) Technical data, including classified information, being returned to the original source of import; </p>
<p>(8) Technical data directly related to classified information which has been previously exported or 
authorized for export in accordance with this part to the same recipient, and which does not disclose the 
details of the design, development, production, or manufacture of any defense article; </p>
<p>(9) Technical data, including classified information, sent by a U.S. corporation to a U.S. person employed 
by that corporation overseas or to a U.S. Government agency. This exemption is subject to the limitations 
of &#167;125.1(b) and may be used only if: </p>
<p>(i) The technical data is to be used overseas solely by U.S. persons; </p>
<p>(ii) If the U.S. person overseas is an employee of the U.S. Government or is directly employed by the U.S. 
corporation and not by a foreign subsidiary; and </p>
<p>(iii) The classified information is sent overseas in accordance with the requirements of the Department of 
Defense Industrial Security Manual. </p>
<p>(10) Disclosures of unclassified technical data in the U.S. by U.S. institutions of higher learning to foreign 
persons who are their bona fide and full time regular employees. This exemption is available only if: </p>
<p>(i) The employee's permanent abode throughout the period of employment is in the United States; </p>
<p>(ii) The employee is not a national of a country to which exports are prohibited pursuant to 126.1 of this 
subchapter; and </p>
<p>(iii) The institution informs the individual in writing that the technical data may not be transferred to other 
foreign persons without the prior written approval of the Office of Defense Trade Controls; </p>
<p>(11) Technical data, including classified information, for which the exporter, pursuant to an arrangement 
with the Department of Defense, Department of Energy or NASA which requires such exports, has been 
granted an exemption in writing from the licensing provisions of this part by the Office of Defense Trade 
Controls. Such an exemption will normally be granted only if the arrangement directly implements an 
international agreement to which the United States is a party and if multiple exports are contemplated. The 
Office of Defense Trade Controls, in consultation with the relevant U.S. Government agencies, will 
determine whether the interests of the United States Government are best served by expediting exports 
under an arrangement through an exemption (see also paragraph (b)(3) of this section for a related 
exemption); </p>
<p>(12) Technical data which is specifically exempt under part 126 of this subchapter; or </p>
<p>(13) Technical data approved for public release (i.e., unlimited distribution) by the cognizant U.S. 
Government department or agency or Directorate for Freedom of Information and Security Review. This 
exemption is applicable to information approved by the cognizant U.S. Government department or agency 
for public release in any form. It does not require that the information be published in order to qualify for 
the exemption. </p>
<p>&#167;<a name="125.5">125.5</a> Exemptions for plant visits. </p>
<p>(a) A license is not required for the oral and visual disclosure of unclassified technical data during the 
course of a classified plant visit by a foreign person, provided (1) the classified visit has itself been 
authorized pursuant to a license issued by the Office of Defense Trade Controls; or (2) the classified visit 
was approved in connection with an actual or potential government-to-government program or project by a 
U.S. Government agency having classification jurisdiction over the classified defense article or classified 
technical data involved under Executive Order 12356 or other applicable Executive Order; and (3) the 
unclassified </p>
<p>information to be released is directly related to the classified defense article or technical data for which 
approval was obtained and does not disclose the details of the design, development, production or 
manufacture of any other defense articles. In the case of visits involving classified information, the 
requirements of the Defense Industrial Security Manual (Department of Defense Manual 5220.22M) must 
be met. </p>
<p>(b) The approval of the Office of Defense Trade Controls is not required for the disclosure of oral and 
visual classified information to a foreign person during the course of a plant visit approved by the 
appropriate U.S. Government agency if (1) the requirements of the Defense Industrial Security Manual 
have been met, (2) the classified information is directly related to that which was approved by the U.S. 
Government agency, (3) it does not exceed that for which approval was obtained, and (4) it does not 
disclose the details of the design, development, production or manufacture of any defense articles. </p>
<p>(c ) A license is not required for the disclosure to a foreign person of unclassified technical data during the 
course of a plant visit (either classified or unclassified) approved by the Office of Defense Trade Controls 
or a cognizant U.S. Government agency provided the technical data does not contain information in excess 
of that approved for disclosure. This exemption does not apply to technical data which could be used for 
design, development, production or manufacture of a defense article. </p>
<p>&#167;<a name="125.6">125.6</a> Certification requirements for exemptions. </p>
<p>(a) To claim an exemption for the export of technical data under the provisions of Secs. 125.4 and 125.5, 
an exporter must certify that the proposed export is covered by a relevant paragraph of that section. For 
&#167;125.4, certification consists of marking the package or letter containing the technical data: ``22 CFR 
125.4 (identify subsection) applicable.'' This certification must be made in written form and retained in the 
exporter's files for a period of five years. A Shippers Export Declaration is not required for exports of 
unclassified technical data (see &#167;123.22 (d) of this subchapter. </p>
<p>(b) If a District Director of Customs or Postmaster is unavailable at the time of export, or if the export is 
via oral, visual, or electronic means, the exporter must also complete a written certification as indicated in 
paragraph (a) of this section. </p>
<p>&#167;<a name="125.7">125.7</a> Procedures for the export of classified technical data and other classified defense articles. </p>
<p>(a) All applications for the export or temporary import of classified technical data or other classified 
defense articles must be submitted to the Office of Defense Trade Controls on Form DSP-85. </p>
<p>(b) An application for the export of classified technical data or other classified defense articles must be 
accompanied by seven copies of the data and a completed Form DSP-83 (see &#167;123.10 of this subchapter). 
Only one copy of the data or descriptive literature must be provided if a renewal of the license is 
requested. All classified materials accompanying an application must be transmitted to the Office of 
Defense Trade Controls in accordance with the requirements of the Defense Industrial Security Manual 
(Department of Defense Manual Number 5220.22-M). </p>
<p>&#167;<a name="125.8">125.8</a> Filing of licenses for exports of unclassified technical data. </p>
<p>(a) Licenses for the export of unclassified technical data must be presented to the appropriate District 
Director of Customs or Postmaster at the time of shipment or mailing. The District Director of Customs or 
Postmaster will endorse and transmit the licenses to the Office of Defense Trade Controls in accordance 
with the instructions contained on the reverse side of the license. </p>
<p>(b) If a license for the export of unclassified technical data is used but not endorsed by U.S. Customs or a 
Postmaster for whatever reason (e.g., electronic transmission, unavailability of Customs officer or 
Postmaster, etc.), the person exporting the data must self-endorse the license, showing when and how the 
export took place. Every license must be returned to the Office of Defense Trade Controls when the total 
value authorized has been shipped or when the date of expiration has been reached, whichever occurs 
first. </p>

<p>Authority: Secs. 2, 38, 40, 42 and 71, Arms Export Control Act, Pub. L. 90-629, 90 Stat. 744 (U.S.C. 
2752, 2778, 2780, 2791 and 2797); E.O. 11958, 41 FR 4311; E.O. 11322, 32 FR 119; 22 U.S.C. 2658; 22 
U.S.C. 287c; E.O. 12918, 59 FR 28205. </p>
<p>&#167;<a name="126.1">126.1</a> Prohibited exports and sales to certain countries. </p>
<p>(a) General. It is the policy of the United States to deny licenses, other approvals, exports and imports of 
defense articles and defense services, destined for or originating in certain countries. This policy applies 
to: Afghanistan, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Byelarus, Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Syria, 
Tajikistan and Vietnam. This policy also applies to countries with respect to which the United States 
maintains an arms embargo (e.g., Burma, China, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and 
Montenegro), Haiti, Liberia, Nigeria, Rwanda Somalia, the Sudan, and Zaire) or 
for whenever an export would not otherwise be in furtherance of world peace and the security and foreign 
policy of the United States. Comprehensive arms embargoes are normally the subject of a State 
Department notice published in the Federal Register. The exemptions provided in the regulations in this 
subchapter, except &#167;&#167; 123.17 and 125.4(b)(13) of this subchapter, do not apply with respect to articles 
originating in or for export to any proscribed countries or areas. With regard to section &#167;123.27 the 
exemption does not apply with respect to articles originating in or for export to countries prohibited by a 
United Nations Security Council Resolution or to which the export (or for which the issuance of a license 
for the export) would be prohibited by a U.S. statute (e.g., by Section 40 of the Arms Export Control Act, 
22 U.S.C. 2780), to countries that have been determined to have repeatedly provided support for acts of 
international terrorism, i.e., Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Sudan and Syria. </p>
<p>(b) Shipments. A defense article licensed for export under this subchapter may not be shipped on a vessel, 
aircraft or other means of conveyance which is owned or operated by, or leased to or from, any of the 
proscribed countries or areas. </p>
<p>(c ) Exports and sales prohibited by United Nations Security Council embargoes. Whenever the United 
Nations Security Council mandates an arms embargo, all transactions which are prohibited by the embargo 
and which involve U.S. persons anywhere, or any person in the United States, and defense articles and 
services of a type enumerated on the United States Munitions List (22 CFR part 121), irrespective of 
origin, are prohibited under the ITAR for the duration of the embargo, unless the Department of State 
publishes a notice in the Federal Register specifying different measures. This would include, but is not 
limited to, transactions involving trae by the U.S. perons who are located inside or outside of the United 
States in defense articles and services of U.S. or foreign origin which are located inside or outside the 
United States. </p>
<p>(d) Terrorism. Exports to countries which the Secretary of State has determined to have repeatedly 
provided support for acts of international terrorism are contrary to the foreign policy of the United States 
and are thus subject to the policy specified in paragraph (a) of this section and the requirements of section 
40 of the Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2780) and the Omnibus Diplomatic Security and 
Anti-Terrorism Act of 1986 (22 U.S.C. 4801, note). The countries in this category are: Cuba, Iran, Iraq, 
Libya, North Korea and Syria. The same countries are identified pursuant to section 6(j) of the Export 
Administration Act, as amended (50 U.S.C. App. 2405(j)). </p>
<p>(e) Proposed sales. No sale or transfer and no proposal to sell or transfer any defense articles, defense 
services or technical data subject to this subchapter may be made to any country referred to in this section 
(including the embassies or consulates of such a country), or to any person acting on its behalf, whether in 
the United States or abroad, without first obtaining a license or written approval of the Office of Defense 
Trade Controls. However, in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section, it is the policy of the 
Department of State to deny licenses and approvals in such cases. Any person who knows or has reason to 
know of such a proposed or actual sale, or transfer, of such articles, services or data must immediately 
inform the Office of Defense Trade Controls. </p>
<p>(f) Angola. Consistent with U.N. Security Council Resolution 864 of September 15, 1993, an arms 
embargo exists with respect to UNITA. Accordingly, exports subject to this subchapter are prohibited in 
accordance with Security Council Resolution 864, Executive Order 12865 of September 29, 1993m and 
the UNITA (Angola) Sanctions Regulations issued by the Office of Foreign Assets Control, Department of 
the Treasury, on December 10, 1993 (56 FR 64904). </p>
<p>&#167;<a name="126.2">126.2</a> Temporary suspension or modification of this subchapter. </p>
<p>The Director, Office of Defense Trade Controls, may order the temporary suspension or modification of 
any or all of the regulations of this subchapter in the interest of the security and foreign policy of the United 
States. </p>
<p>&#167;<a name="126.3">126.3</a> Exceptions. </p>
<p>In a case of exceptional or undue hardship, or when it is otherwise in the interest of the United States 
Government, the Director, Office of Defense Trade Controls may make an exception to the provisions of 
this subchapter. </p>
<p>&#167;<a name="126.4">126.4</a> Shipments by or for United States Government agencies. </p>
<p>(a) A license is not required for the temporary import, or temporary export, of any defense article, 
including technical data or the performance of a defense service, by or for any agency of the U.S. 
Government (1) for official use by such an agency, or (2) for carrying out any foreign assistance, 
cooperative project or sales program authorized by law and subject to control by the President by other 
means. This exemption applies only when all aspects of a transaction (export, carriage, and delivery 
abroad) are effected by a United States Government agency or when the export is covered by a United 
States Government Bill of Lading. This exemption, however, does not apply when a U.S. Government 
agency acts as a transmittal agent on behalf of a private individual or firm, either as a convenience or in 
satisfaction of security requirements. The approval of the Office of Defense Trade Controls must be 
obtained before defense articles previously exported pursuant to this exemption are permanently 
transferred (e.g., property disposal of surplus defense articles overseas) unless (i) the transfer is pursuant 
to a grant, sale, lease, loan or cooperative project under the Arms Export Control Act or a sale, lease or 
loan under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended, or (ii) the defense articles have been rendered 
useless for military purposes beyond the possibility of restoration. </p>
<p>Note: Special definition. For purposes of this section, defense articles exported abroad for incorporation 
into a foreign launch vehicle or for use on a foreign launch vehicle or satellite that is to be launched from a 
foreign country shall be considered a permanent export. </p>
<p>(b) This section does not authorize any department or agency of the U.S. Government to make any export 
which is otherwise prohibited by virtue of other administrative provisions or by any statute. </p>
<p>(c ) A license is not required for the temporary import, or temporary or permanent export, of any classified 
or unclassified defense articles, including technical data or the performance of a defense service, for 
end-use by a U.S. Government Agency in a foreign country under the following circumstances: </p>
<p>(1) The export or temporary import is pursuant to a contract with, or written direction by, an agency of the 
U.S. Government; and </p>
<p>(2) The end-user in the foreign country is a U.S. Government agency or facility, and the defense articles or 
technical data will not be transferred to any foreign person; and </p>
<p>(3) The urgency of the U.S. Government requirement is such that the appropriate export license or U.S. 
Government Bill of Lading could not have been obtained in a timely manner. </p>
<p>(d) A Shipper's Export Declaration (SED), required under &#167;123.22(c ) of this subchapter, and a written 
statement by the exporter certifying that these requirements have been met must be presented at the time of 
export to the appropriate District Director of Customs or Department of Defense transmittal authority. A 
copy of the SED and the written certification statement shall be provided to the Office of Defense Trade 
Controls immediately following the export. </p>
<p>&#167;<a name="126.5">126.5</a> Canadian exemptions. </p>
<p>(a) District Directors of Customs and postmasters shall permit the export or temporary import without a 
license of any unclassified defense article or any unclassified technical data to Canada for end-use in 
Canada by Canadian citizens or return to the United States, or from Canada for end-use in the United States 
or return to a Canadian citizen in Canada, with the exception of the articles or related technical data listed 
in paragraph (b) of this section. </p>
<p>(b) Exceptions. The exemptions of this section do not apply to the following articles and related technical 
data: </p>
<p>(1) Fully automatic firearms in Category I(a) which are not for end-use by the Federal Government, or a 
Provincial or Municipal Government of Canada; </p>
<p>(2) Nuclear weapons strategic delivery systems and all components, parts, accessories, attachments 
specifically designed for such systems and associated equipment; </p>
<p>(3) Nuclear weapon design and test equipment listed in Category XVI; </p>
<p>(4) Naval nuclear propulsion equipment listed in Category VI(e); </p>
<p>(5) Aircraft listed in Category VIII(a); </p>
<p>(6) Submersible and oceanographic vessels and related articles listed in Category XX (a) through (d). </p>
<p>(7) Defense articles, defense services, or related technical data for use by a foreign national other than a 
Canadian. </p>
<p>(c ) Related requirements. The foregoing exemption from obtaining an export license does not exempt an 
exporter from complying with the requirements set forth in &#167;123.15 of this subchapter or from filing the 
Shipper's Export Declaration required by &#167; 123.22 of this subchapter. </p>
<p>(d) Part 124 agreements. The requirements of part 124 of this subchapter must be complied with in the 
situations contemplated in that part. For example, the exemptions of this section may not be used for the 
provision of defense services except pursuant to an approved manufacturing licenseagreement or technical 
assistance agreement. </p>
<p>&#167;<a name="126.6">126.6</a> Foreign-owned military aircraft and naval vessels, and the Foreign Military Sales program. </p>
<p>(a) A license from the Office of Defense Trade Controls is not required if: </p>
<p>(1)(i) The article or technical data to be exported was sold, leased, or loaned by the Department of 
Defense to a foreign country or international organization pursuant to the Arms Export Control Act or the 
Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended, and </p>
<p>(ii) The article or technical data was delivered to representatives of such a country or organization in the 
United States; and </p>
<p>(iii) The article or technical data is to be exported from the United States on a military aircraft or naval 
vessel of that government or organization or via the Defense Transportation Service (DTS). </p>
<p>(b) Foreign military aircraft and naval vessels. A license is not required for the entry into the United States 
of military aircraft or naval vessels of any foreign state if no overhaul, repair, or modification of the 
aircraft or naval vessel is to be performed. However, Department of State approval for overflight 
(pursuant to the 49 U.S.C. 1508) and naval visits must be obtained from the Bureau of Politico-Military 
Affairs, Office of International Security Operations. </p>
<p>(c ) Procedures for the Foreign Military Sales Program. (1) District Directors of Customs are authorized 
to permit the export and temporary import of classified and unclassified defense articles, defense services 
and technical data without a license if the articles or technical data were sold, leased or loaned by the U.S. 
Department of Defense to foreign governments or international organizations under the Foreign Military 
Sales (FMS) program of the Arms Export Control Act. This procedure may be used only if a proposed 
export is: </p>
<p>(i) Pursuant to an executed U.S. Department of Defense Letter of Offer and Acceptance (DD Form 1513); 
and </p>
<p>(ii) Accompanied by a properly executed DSP-94, or in the case of a classified shipment, an approved 
Letter of Offer and Acceptance; and </p>
<p>(iii) Made by the relevant foreign diplomatic mission of the purchasing country or its authorized freight 
forwarder, provided that the freight forwarder is registered with the Office of Defense Trade Controls 
pursuant to part 122 of this subchapter, and, if classified defense articles or technical data are involved, 
has the requisite U.S. Government security clearance and a transportation plan has been approved as in 
&#167;126.6(a)(1), above and the defense articles or technical data are shipped in compliance with the 
Department of Defense Industrial Security Manual. </p>
<p>(2) Filing and documents. </p>
<p>(i) The original copy of completed Form DSP-94, together with one copy of the corresponding 
authenticated DD Form 1513 and a Shipper's Export Declaration, must be filed with the District Director 
of Customs at the port of exit prior to actual shipment. An executed DD Form 1513 is one which has been 
signed by: </p>
<p>(A) an authorized Department of Defense representative and countersigned by the Comptroller, Defense 
Security Assistance Agency (DSAA); and </p>
<p>(B) by an authorized representative of the foreign government. </p>
<p>(ii) SED or Outbound Manifest. The Shipper's Export Declaration or, if authorized, the outbound manifest, 
must be annotated as follows: </p>
<p>This shipment is being exported under the authority of Department of State Form DSP-94. It covers FMS 
Case (case identification), expiration date _________. 22 CFR 126.6 applicable. The U.S. Government 
point of contact is _________, telephone number ____________. </p>
<p>&#167;<a name="126.7">126.7</a> Denial, revocation, suspension or amendment of licenses and other approvals. </p>
<p>(a) Policy. Licenses or approvals shall be denied or revoked whenever required by any statute of the 
United States (see 127.6 and 127.10 of this subchapter). Any application for an export license or other 
approval under this subchapter may be disapproved, and any license or other approval or exemption 
granted under this subchapter may be revoked, suspended, or amended without prior notice whenever: </p>
<p>(1) The Department of State deems such action to be in furtherance of world peace, the national security or 
the foreign policy of the United States, or is otherwise advisable; or </p>
<p>(2) The Department of State believes that 22 U.S.C. 2778, any regulation contained in this subchapter, or 
the terms of any U.S. Government export authorization (including the terms of a manufacturing license or 
technical assistance agreement, or export authorization granted pursuant to the Export Administration Act, 
as amended) has been violated by any party to the export or other person having significant interest in the 
transaction; or </p>
<p>(3) An applicant is the subject of an indictment for a violation of any of the U.S. criminal statutes 
enumerated in &#167;120.27 of this subchapter; or </p>
<p>(4) An applicant or any party to the export or the agreement has been convicted of violating any of the U.S. 
criminal statutes enumerated in &#167;120.27 of this subchapter; or </p>
<p>(5) An applicant is ineligible to contract with, or to receive a license or other authorization to import 
defense articles or defense services from, any agency of the U.S. Government; or </p>
<p>(6) An applicant, any party to the export or agreement, any source or manufacturer of the defense article or 
defense service or any person who has a significant interest in the transaction has been debarred, 
suspended, or otherwise is ineligible to receive an export license or other authorization from any agency 
of the U.S. government (e.g., pursuant to debarment by the Department of Commerce under 15 CFR part 
388 or by the Department of State under part 127 or 128 of this subchapter); or </p>
<p>(7) An applicant has failed to include any of the information or documentation expressly required to 
support a license application or other request for approval under this subchapter or as required in the 
instructions in the applicable Department of State form; or </p>
<p>(8) An applicant is subject to sanctions under other relevant U.S. laws (e.g., the Missile Technology 
Controls title of the National Defense Authorization Act for FY 1991 (Pub. L. 101-510); the Chemical and 
Biological Weapons Control and Warfare Elimination Act of 1991 (Pub. L. 102-182); or the Iran-Iraq 
Arms Non-Proliferation Act of 1992 (Pub. L. 102-484)). </p>
<p>(b) Notification. The Office of Defense Trade Controls will notify applicants or licensees or other 
appropriate United States persons of actions taken pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section. The reasons 
for the action will be stated as specifically as security and foreign policy considerations permit. </p>
<p>(c ) Reconsideration. If a written request for reconsideration of an adverse decision is made within 30 
days after a person has been informed of the decision, the U.S. person will be accorded an opportunity to 
present additional information. The case will then be reviewed by the Office of Defense Trade Controls. </p>
<p>(d) Reconsideration of certain applications. Applications for licenses or other requests for approval 
denied for repeated failure to provide information or documentation expressly required will normally not 
be reconsidered during the thirty day period following denial. They will be reconsidered after this period 
only after a final decision is made on whether the applicant will be subject to an administrative penalty 
imposed pursuant to this subchapter. Any request for reconsideration shall be accompanied by a letter 
explaining the steps that have been taken to correct the failure and to ensure compliance with the 
requirements of this subchapter. </p>
<p>(e) Special definition. For purposes of this section, the term party to the export means: </p>
<p>(1) The chief executive officer, president, vice-presidents, other senior officers and officials (e.g., 
comptroller, treasurer, general counsel) and any member of the board of directors of the applicant; </p>
<p>(2) The freight forwarders or designated exporting agent of the applicant; and </p>
<p>(3) Any consignee or end-user of any item to be exported. </p>
<p>&#167;<a name="126.8">126.8</a> Proposals to foreign persons relating to significant military equipment. </p>
<p>(a) Certain proposals to foreign persons for the sale or manufacture abroad of significant military 
equipment require either the prior approval of, or prior notification to, the Office of Defense Trade 
Controls. </p>
<p>(1) Sale of significant military equipment: Prior approval requirement. The approval of the Office of 
Defense Trade Controls is required before a U.S. person may make a proposal or presentation designed to 
constitute a basis for a decision on the part of any foreign person to purchase significant military 
equipment on the U.S. Munitions List whenever all the following conditions are met: </p>
<p>(i) The value of the significant military equipment to be sold is $14,000,000 or more; and </p>
<p>(ii) The equipment is intended for use by the armed forces of any foreign country other than a member of 
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, Australia, New Zealand, or Japan; and </p>
<p>(iii) The sale would involve the export from the United States of any defense article or the furnishing 
abroad of any defense service including technical data; and </p>
<p>(iv) The identical significant military equipment has not been previously licensed for permanent export or 
approved for sale under the Foreign Military Sales Program of the Department of Defense, to any foreign 
country. </p>
<p>(2) Sale of significant military equipment: Prior notification requirement. </p>
<p>The Office Defense Trade Controls must be notified in writing at least thirty days in advance of any 
proposal or presentation concerning the sale of significant military equipment whenever the conditions 
specified in paragraphs (a)(1) (i) through (iii) of this section are met and the identical equipment has been 
previously licensed for permanent export or approved for sale under the FMS Program to any foreign 
country. </p>
<p>(3) Manufacture abroad of significant military equipment: Prior approval requirement. The approval of the 
Office of Defense Trade Controls is required before a U.S. person may make a proposal or presentation 
designed to constitute a basis for a decision on the part of any foreign person to enter into any 
manufacturing license agreement or technical assistance agreement for the production or assembly of 
significant military equipment, regardless of dollar value, in any foreign country, whenever: </p>
<p>(i) The equipment is intended for use by the armed forces of any foreign country; and </p>
<p>(ii) The agreement would involve the export from the United States of any defense article or the furnishing 
abroad of any defense service including technical data. </p>
<p>(b) Definition of proposal or presentation. The terms proposal or presentation (designed to constitute a 
basis for a decision to purchase and to enter into any agreement) mean the communication of information in 
sufficient detail that the person communicating that information knows or should know that it would permit 
an intended purchaser to decide either to acquire the particular equipment in question or to enter into the 
manufacturing license agreement or technical assistance agreement. For example, a presentation which 
describes the equipment's performance characteristics, price, and probable availability for delivery would 
require prior notification or approval, as appropriate, where the conditions specified in paragraph (a) of 
this section are met. By contrast, the following would not require prior notification or approval: 
Advertising or other reporting in a publication of general circulation; preliminary discussions to ascertain 
market potential; or merely calling attention to the fact that a company manufactures a particular item of 
significant military equipment. </p>
<p>(c ) Satisfaction of requirements. </p>
<p>(1) The requirement of this section for prior approval is met by any of the following: </p>
<p>(i) A written statement from the Office of Defense Trade Controls approving the proposed sale or 
agreement or approving the making of a proposal or presentation. </p>
<p>(ii) A license issued under &#167;125.2 or &#167;125.3 of this subchapter for the export of technical data relating to 
the proposed sale or agreement to the country concerned. </p>
<p>(iii) A temporary export license issued under &#167;123.5 of this subchapter relating to the proposed sale or 
agreement for a demonstration to the armed forces of the country of export. </p>
<p>(iv) With respect to manufacturing license agreements or technical assistance agreements, the application 
for export licenses pursuant to the two preceding subparagraphs must state that they are related to possible 
agreements of this kind. </p>
<p>(2) The requirement of this section for prior notification is met by informing the Office of Defense Trade 
Controls by letter at least 30 days before making the proposal or presentation. The letter must comply with 
the procedures set forth in paragraph (d) of this section and must identify the relevant license, approval, or 
FMS case by which the identical equipment had previously been authorized for permanent export or sale. 
The Office of Defense Trade Controls will provide written acknowledgment of such prior notification to 
confirm compliance with this requirement and the commencement of the 30-day notification period. </p>
<p>(d) Procedures. Unless a license has been obtained pursuant to &#167;126.8(c)(1) (ii) or (iii), a request for 
prior approval to make a proposal or presentation with respect to significant military equipment, or a 
30-day prior notification regarding the sale of such equipment, must be made by letter to the Office of 
Defense Trade Controls. The letter must outline in detail the intended transaction, including usage of the 
equipment involved and the country (or countries) involved. Seven copies of the letter should be provided 
as well as seven copies of suitable descriptive information concerning the equipment. </p>
<p>(e) Statement to accompany licensing requests. </p>
<p>(1) Every application for an export license or other approval to implement a sale or agreement which 
meets the criteria specified in paragraph (a) of this section must be accompanied by a statement from the 
applicant which either: </p>
<p>(i) Refers to a specific notification made or approval previously granted with respect to the transaction; or </p>
<p>(ii) Certifies that no proposal or presentation requiring prior notification or approval has been made. </p>
<p>(2) The Department of State may require a similar statement from the Foreign Military Sales contractor 
concerned in any case where the United States Government receives a request for a letter of offer for a 
sale which meets the criteria specified in paragraph (a) of this section. </p>
<p>(f) Penalties. In addition to other remedies and penalties prescribed by law or this subchapter, a failure to 
satisfy the prior approval or prior notification requirements of this section may be considered to be a 
reason for disapproval of a license, agreement or sale under the FMS program. </p>
<p>(g) License for technical data. Nothing in this section constitutes or is to be construed as an exemption 
from the licensing requirement for the export of technical data that is embodied in any proposal or 
presentation made to any foreign persons. </p>
<p>&#167;<a name="126.9">126.9</a> Advisory opinions. </p>
<p>Any person desiring information as to whether the Office of Defense Trade Controls would be likely to 
grant a license or other approval for the export of a particular defense article or defense service to a 
particular country may request an advisory opinion from the Office of Defense Trade Controls. These 
opinions are not binding on the Department of State and are revocable. A request for an advisory opinion 
must be made in writing and must outline in detail the equipment, its usage, the security classification (if 
any) of the articles or related technical data, and the country or countries involved. An original and seven 
copies of the letter must be provided along with seven copies of suitable descriptive information 
concerning the defense article or defense service. </p>
<p>&#167;<a name="126.10">126.10</a> Disclosure of information. </p>
<p>(a) Freedom of Information. Subchapter R of this title contains regulations on the availability to the public 
of information and records of the Department of State. The provisions of subchapter R apply to such 
disclosures by the Office of Defense Trade Controls. </p>
<p>(b) Determinations required by law. Section 38 of the Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2778) 
provides that certain information required by the Department of State in connection with the licensing 
process may generally not be disclosed to the public unless certain determinations relating to the national 
interest are made in accordance with the procedures specified by that provision. Determinations required 
by section 38(e) shall be made by the Assistant Secretary of State for Politico-Military Affairs. </p>
<p>(c ) Information required under part 130. Part 130 of this subchapter contains specific provisions on the 
disclosure of information described in that part. </p>
<p>(d) National Interest Determinations. In accordance with section 38(e) of the Arms Export Control Act (22 
U.S.C. 2778(e)), the Secretary of State has determined that the following disclosures are in the national 
interest of the United States: </p>
<p>(1) Furnishing information to foreign governments for law enforcement or regulatory purposes; and </p>
<p>(2) Furnishing information to foreign governments and other agencies of the U.S. Government in the context 
of multilateral or bilateral export regimes (e.g., the Missile Technology Control Regime, the Australia 
Group, and COCOM). </p>
<p>&#167;<a name="126.11">126.11</a> Relations to other provisions of law. </p>
<p>The provisions in this subchapter are in addition to, and are not in lieu of, any other provisions of law or 
regulations. The sale of firearms in the United States, for example, remains subject to the provisions of the 
Gun Control Act of 1968 and regulations administered by the Department of the Treasury. The 
performance of defense services on behalf of foreign governments by retired military personnel continues 
to require consent pursuant to Part 3a of this title. Persons who intend to export defense articles or furnish 
defense services should consequently not assume that satisfying the requirements of this subchapter 
relieves one of other requirements of law. </p>
<p>&#167;<a name="126.12">126.12</a> Continuation in force. </p>
<p>All determinations, authorizations, licenses, approvals of contracts and agreements and other action 
issued, authorized, undertaken, or entered into by the Department of State pursuant to section 414 of the 
Mutual Security Act of 1954, as amended, or under the previous provisions of this subchapter, continue in 
full force and effect until or unless modified, revoked or superseded by the Department of State. </p>
<p>&#167;<a name="126.13">126.13</a> Required information. </p>
<p>(a) All applications for licenses (DSP-5, DSP-61, DSP-73, and DSP-85), all requests for approval of 
agreements and amendments thereto under part 124 of this subchapter, all requests for other written 
authorizations, and all 30-day prior notifications of sales of significant military equipment under 126.8(c ) 
must include a letter signed by a responsible official empowered by the applicant and addressed to the 
Director, Office of Defense Trade Controls, stating whether: </p>
<p>(1) The applicant or the chief executive officer, president, vice-presidents, other senior officers or 
officials (e.g., comptroller, treasurer, general counsel) or any member of the board of directors is the 
subject of an indictment for or has been convicted of violating any of the U.S. criminal statutes enumerated 
in &#167;120.27 of this subchapter since the effective date of the Arms Export Control Act, Public Law 94-329, 
90 Stat. 729 (June 30, 1976); </p>
<p>(2) The applicant or the chief executive officer, president, vice-presidents, other senior officers or 
officials (e.g., comptroller, treasurer, general counsel) or any member of the board of directors is </p>
<p>ineligible to contract with, or to receive a license or other approval to import defense articles or defense 
services from, or to receive an export license or other approval from, any agency of the U.S. Government; </p>
<p>(3) To the best of the applicant's knowledge, any party to the export as defined in &#167;126.7(e) has been 
convicted of violating any of the U.S. criminal statutes enumerated in &#167;120.27 of this subchapter since the 
effective date of the Arms Export Control Act, Public Law 94-329, 90 Stat. 729 (June 30, 1976), or is 
ineligible to contract with, or to receive a license or other approval to import defense articles or defense 
services from, or to receive an export license or other approval from any agency of the U.S. government; 
and </p>
<p>(4) The natural person signing the application, notification or other request for approval (including the 
statement required by this subsection) is a citizen or national of the United States, has been lawfully 
admitted to the United States for permanent residence (and maintains such a residence) under the 
Immigration and Nationality Act, as amended (8 U.S.C. 1101(a), section 101(a)20, 60 Stat. 163), or is an 
official of a foreign government entity in the United States. </p>
<p>(b) In addition, all applications for licenses must include, on the application or an addendum sheet, the 
complete names and addresses of all U.S. consignors and freight forwarders, and all foreign consignees 
and foreign intermediate consignees involved in the transaction. If there are multiple consignors, 
consignees or freight forwarders, and all the required information cannot be included on the application 
form, an addendum sheet and seven copies containing this information must be provided. The addendum 
sheet must be marked at the top as follows: ``Attachment to Department of State License From (insert 
DSP-5, 61, 73, or 85, as appropriate) for Export of (insert commodity) valued at (insert U.S. dollar 
amount) to (insert country of ultimate destination).'' The Office of Defense Trade Controls will impress 
one copy of the addendum sheet with the Department of State seal and return it to the applicant with each 
license. The sealed addendum </p>
<p>sheet must remain attached to the license as an integral part thereof. District Directors of Customs and 
Department of Defense transmittal authorities will permit only those U.S. consignors or freight forwarders 
listed on the license or sealed addendum sheet to make shipments under the license, and only to those 
foreign consignees named on the documents. Applicants should list all freight forwarders who may be 
involved with shipments under the license to ensure that the list is complete and to avoid the need for 
amendments to the list after the license has been approved. If there are unusual or extraordinary 
circumstances that preclude the specific identification of all the U.S. consignors and freight forwarders 
and all foreign consignees, the applicant must provide a letter of explanation with each application. </p>
<p>(c ) In cases when foreign nationals are employed at or assigned to security-cleared facilities, provision 
by the applicant of a Technology Control Plan (available from the Defense Investigative Service) will 
facilitate processing. </p>

<p>&#167;<a name="127.1">127.1</a> Violations. </p>
<p>(a) It is unlawful: </p>
<p>(1) To export or attempt to export from the United States any defense article or technical data or to furnish 
any defense service for which a license or written approval is required by this subchapter without first 
obtaining the required license or written approval from the Office of Defense Trade Controls; </p>
<p>(2) To import or attempt to import any defense article whenever a license is required by this subchapter 
without first obtaining the required license or written approval from the Office of Defense Trade Controls; </p>
<p>(3) To conspire to export, import, reexport or cause to be exported, imported or reexported, any defense 
article or to furnish any defense service for which a license or written approval is required by this 
subchapter without first obtaining the required license or written approval from the Office of Defense 
Trade Controls; or </p>
<p>(4) To violate any of the terms or conditions of licenses or approvals granted pursuant to this subchapter. </p>
<p>(b) Any person who is granted a license or other approval under this subchapter is responsible for the acts 
of employees, agents, and all authorized persons to whom possession of the licensed defense article or 
technical data has been entrusted regarding the operation, use, possession, transportation, and handling of 
such defense article or technical data abroad. All persons abroad subject to U.S. jurisdiction who obtain 
temporary custody of a defense article exported from the United States or produced under an agreement 
described in part 124 of this subchapter, and irrespective of the number of intermediate transfers, are 
bound by the regulations of this subchapter in the same manner and to the same extent as the original owner 
or transferer. </p>
<p>(c ) A person with knowledge that another person is then ineligible pursuant to Secs. 120.1(c ) of this 
subchapter or 126.7 of this chapter, is then subject to an order of debarment, or interim suspension, may 
not, directly or indirectly, in any manner or capacity, without prior disclosure of the facts to, and written 
authorization from, the Office of Defense Trade Controls: </p>
<p>(1) Apply for, obtain, or use any export control document as defined in &#167; 127.2(b) for such debarred, 
suspended, or ineligible person; or </p>
<p>(2) Order, buy, receive, use, sell, deliver, store, dispose of, forward, transport, finance, or otherwise 
service or participate in any transaction which may involve any defense article or the furnishing of any 
defense service for which a license or approval is required by this subchapter for export, where such 
debarred, suspended, or ineligible person may obtain any benefit therefrom or have any direct or indirect 
interest therein. </p>
<p>(d) No person may willfully cause, or aid, abet, counsel, demand, induce, procure or permit the 
commission of any act prohibited by, or the omission of any act required by 22 U.S.C. 2778, 22 U.S.C.

misrepresenting or omitting a material fact for the purpose of exporting any defense article or technical 
data or the furnishing of any defense service for which a license or approval is required by this

import control document will be considered as made in a matter within the jurisdiction of a department or 
agency of the United States for the purposes of 18 U.S.C. 1001, 22 U.S.C. 2778 and 22 U.S.C. 2779. </p>

<p>In the case of exports involving classified technical data or defense articles, the Defense Investigative 
Service may take appropriate action to ensure compliance with the Department of Defense Industrial 
Security Manual. Upon a request to the Defense Investigative Service regarding the export of any 
classified defense article or technical data, the Defense Investigative Service official or a designated 
government transmittal authority may require the production of other relevant documents and information 
relating to the proposed export. </p>
<p>&#167;<a name="127.6">127.6</a> Seizure and forfeiture in attempts at illegal exports. </p>
<p>(a) An attempt to export from the United States any defense articles in violation of the provisions of this 
subchapter constitutes an offense punishable under section 401 of title 22 of the United States Code. 
Whenever it is known or there is probable cause to believe that any defense article is intended to be or is 
being or has been exported or removed from the United States in violation of law, such article and any 
vessel, vehicle or aircraft involved in such attempt is subject to seizure, forfeiture and disposition as 
provided in section 401 of title 22 of the United States Code. </p>
<p>(b) Similarly, an attempt to violate any of the conditions under which a temporary export or temporary 
import license was issued pursuant to this subchapter or to violate the requirements of 123.2 of this 
subchapter also constitutes an offense punishable under section 401 of title 22 of the United States Code, 
and such article, together with any vessel, vehicle or aircraft involved in any such attempt is subject to 
seizure, forfeiture, and disposition as provided in section 401 of title 22 of the United States Code. </p>
<p>&#167;<a name="127.7">127.7</a> Debarment. </p>
<p>(a) In implementing section 38 of the Arms Export Control Act, the Assistant Secretary of State for 
Politico-Military Affairs may prohibit any person from participating directly or indirectly in the export of 
defense articles, including technical data or in the furnishing of defense services for which a license or 
approval is required by this subchapter for any of the reasons listed below. Any such prohibition is 
referred to as a debarment for purposes of this subchapter. The Assistant Secretary of State for 
Politico-Military Affairs shall determine the appropriate period of time for debarment, which shall 
generally be for a period of three years. </p>
<p>(b) Grounds. </p>
<p>(1) The basis for a statutory debarment, as described in paragraph (c ) of this section, is any conviction for 
violating the Arms Export Control Act (see &#167;127.3 of this subchapter) or any conspiracy to violate the 
Arms Export Control Act. </p>
<p>(2) The basis for administrative debarment, described in part 128 of this subchapter, is any violation of 22 
U.S.C. 2778 or any rule or regulation issued thereunder when such a violation is of such a character as to 
provide a reasonable basis for the Office of Defense Trade Controls to believe that the violator cannot be 
relied upon to comply with the statute or these rules or regulations in the future, and when such violation is 
established in accordance with part 128 of this subchapter. </p>
<p>(c ) Statutory Debarment. Section 38(g)(4) of the Arms Export Control Act prohibits the issuance of 
licenses to persons who have been convicted of violating the U.S. criminal statutes enumerated in &#167; 120.27 
of this subchapter. Discretionary authority to issue licenses is provided, but only if certain statutory 
requirements are met. It is the policy of the Department of State not to consider applications for licenses or 
requests for approvals involving any person who has been convicted of violating the Arms Export Control 
Act or convicted of conspiracy to violate that Act for a three year period following conviction. Such 
individuals shall be notified in writing that they are debarred pursuant to this policy. A list of persons who 
have been convicted of such offenses and debarred for this reason shall be published periodically in the 
Federal Register. Debarment in such cases is based solely upon the outcome of a criminal proceeding, 
conducted by a court of the United States, that established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt in accordance 
with due process. The procedures of part 128 of this subchapter are not applicable in such cases. </p>
<p>(d) Appeals. Any person who is ineligible pursuant to paragraph (c ) of this section may appeal to the 
Under Secretary of State for International Security Affairs for reconsideration of the ineligibility 
determination. The procedures specified in &#167;128.13 of this subchapter are applicable in such appeals. </p>
<p>&#167;<a name="127.8">127.8</a> Interim suspension. </p>
<p>(a) The Director of the Office of Defense Trade Controls is authorized to order the interim suspension of 
any person when the Director believes that grounds for debarment (as defined in &#167;127.6 of this part) exist 
and where and to the extent the Director finds that interim suspension is reasonably necessary to protect 
world peace or the security or foreign policy of the United States. The interim suspension orders prohibit 
that person from participating directly or indirectly in the export of any defense article or defense service 
for which a license or approval is required by this subchapter. The suspended person shall be notified in 
writing as provided in &#167;127.6(c ) of this part (statutory debarment) or &#167;128.3 of this subchapter 
(administrative debarment), whichever is appropriate. In both cases, a copy of the interim suspension 
order will be served upon that person in the same manner as provided in &#167;128.3 of this subchapter. The 
interim suspension order may be made immediately effective, without prior notice. The order will state the 
relevant facts, the grounds for issuance of the order, and describe the nature and duration of the interim 
suspension. No person may be suspended for a period exceeding 60 days unless proceedings under 
&#167;127.6(c ) of this part or under part 128 of this subchapter, or criminal proceedings, are initiated before 
the expiration of that period. </p>
<p>(b) A motion or petition to vacate or modify an interim suspension order may be filed at any time with the 
Under Secretary of State for International Security Affairs. After a final decision is reached, the Director 
of the Office of Defense Trade Controls will issue an appropriate order disposing of the motion or petition 
and will promptly inform the respondent accordingly. </p>
<p>&#167;<a name="127.9">127.9</a> Applicability of orders. </p>
<p>For the purpose of preventing evasion, orders of the Assistant Secretary of State for Politico-Military 
Affairs, debarring a person under &#167;127.6 and orders of the Director, Office of Defense Trade Controls, 
suspending a person under &#167;127.7 may be made applicable to any other person who may then or thereafter 
(during the term of the order) be related to the debarred person by affiliation, ownership, control, position 
of responsibility, or other commercial connection. Appropriate notice and opportunity to respond to 
charges will be given. </p>
<p>&#167;<a name="127.10">127.10</a> Civil penalty. </p>
<p>(a) The Assistant Secretary of State for Politico-Military Affairs, Department of State, is authorized to 
impose a civil penalty in an amount not to exceed that authorized by 50 U.S.C. App. 2410(c ) for each 
violation of 22 U.S.C. 2778, or any regulation, order, license or approval issued thereunder. This civil 
penalty may be either in addition to, or in lieu of, any other liability or penalty which may be imposed. </p>
<p>(b) The Office of Defense Trade Controls may make: </p>
<p>(1) The payment of a civil penalty under this section or </p>
<p>(2) The completion of any administrative action pursuant to this part 127 or 128 of this subchapter a prior 
condition for the issuance, restoration, or continuing validity of any export license or other approval. </p>
<p>&#167;<a name="127.11">127.11</a> Past violations. </p>
<p>(a) Pursuant to section 38 of the Arms Export Control Act, licenses or other approvals may not be granted 
to persons who have been convicted of violating any of the U.S. criminal statutes enumerated in 120.27 of 
this subchapter or who are ineligible to receive any export licenses from any agency of the U.S. 
government, subject to a narrowly defined statutory exception. This provision establishes a presumption of 
denial for licenses or other approvals involving such persons. This presumption is applied by the Office of 
Defense Trade Controls to all persons convicted or deemed ineligible in this manner since the effective 
date of the Arms Export Control Act (Pub. L. 94-329; 90 Stat. 729) (June 30, 1976). </p>
<p>(b) Policy. An exception to the policy of the Department of State to deny applications for licenses or other 
approvals that involve persons described in paragraph (a) of this section shall not be considered unless 
there are extraordinary circumstances surrounding the conviction or ineligibility to export, and only if the 
applicant demonstrates, to the satisfaction of the Bureau of Politico-Military Affairs, that the applicant has 
taken appropriate steps to mitigate any law enforcement and other legitimate concerns, and to deal with the 
causes that resulted in the conviction, ineligibility, or debarment. Any person described in paragraph (a) of 
this section who wishes to request consideration of any application must explain, in a letter to the 
Director, Office of Defense Trade Controls, the reasons why the application should be considered. If the 
Bureau of Politico-Military Affairs concludes that the application and written explanation have sufficient 
merit, it shall consult with the Office of the Legal Adviser and the Department of the Treasury regarding 
law enforcement concerns, and may also request the views of other departments, including the Department 
of Justice. If the Office of Defense Trade Controls does grant the license or other approval, subsequent 
applications from the same person need not repeat the information previously provided but should instead 
refer to the favorable decision. </p>
<p>(c ) Debarred persons. Persons debarred pursuant to &#167; 127.6(c ) (statutory debarment) may not utilize the 
procedures provided by this section while the debarment is in force. Such persons may utilize only the 
procedures provided by &#167;127.7(d) of this part. </p>
<p>&#167;<a name="127.12">127.12</a> Voluntary disclosures. </p>
<p>(a) General policy. The Department strongly encourages the disclosure of information to the Office of 
Defense Trade Controls by persons, firms or any organization that believe they may have violated any 
export control provision of the Arms Export Control Act, or any regulations, order, license, or other 
authorization issued under the Arms Export Control Act. Voluntary self-disclosure may be considered a 
mitigating factor in determining the administrative penalties, if any, that should be imposed by the 
Department. Failure to report such violation(s) may result in circumstances detrimental to U.S. national 
security and foreign policy interests. </p>
<p>(b) Limitations. (1) The provisions of this section apply only when information is provided to the Office of 
Defense Trade Controls for its review in determining whether to take administrative action under part 128 
of this subchapter concerning violation(s) of the export control provisions of the Arms Export Control Act 
and these regulations. </p>
<p>(2) The provisions of this section apply only when information is received by the Office of Defense Trade 
Controls for review prior to such time that either the Department of State or any other agency, bureau or 
department of the United States Government obtains knowledge of either the same or substantially similar 
information from another source and commenced an investigation or inquiry that involves that information, 
and that is intended to determine whether the Arms Export Control Act or these regulations, or any other 
license, order or other authorization issued under the Arms Export Control Act has been violated. </p>
<p>(3) It is possible that the activity in question -- despite voluntary disclosure -- might merit penalties, 
administrative actions, sanctions, or referrals to the Department of Justice for consideration as to whether 
criminal prosecution is warranted. In the latter case, the Office of Defense Trade Controls will notify the 
Department of Justice of the voluntary nature of the disclosure although the Department of Justice is not 
required to give that fact any weight. The Office of Defense Trade Controls has the sole discretion to 
consider whether ``voluntary disclosure,'' in context with other relevant information in a particular case, 
should be a mitigating factor in determining what, if any, administrative action will be imposed. Some of 
the mitigating factors the Office of Defense Trade Controls may consider are: </p>
<p>(i) Whether the transaction would have been authorized had proper application been made; </p>
<p>(ii) Why the violation(s) occurred; </p>
<p>(iii) The degree of cooperation with the ensuing investigation; </p>
<p>(iv) Whether the person or firm has instituted or improved an internal compliance program to reduce the 
likelihood of future violation(s); </p>
<p>(v) Whether the person making the disclosure did so with the full knowledge and authorization of the firm's 
senior management. (If not, then a firm will not be deemed to have made a disclosure as covered in this 
section.) </p>
<p>(4) The provisions of this section do not, nor should they be relied on, to create, confer, or grant any rights, 
benefits, privileges, or protection enforceable at law or in equity by any person, business, or entity in any 
civil, criminal, administrative, or other matter. </p>
<p>(c ) Notification. (1) Any person or firm wanting to disclose information that constitutes a voluntary 
self-disclosure should, in the manner outlined below, initially notify the Office of Defense Trade Controls 
as soon as possible after violation(s) are discovered and then conduct a thorough review of all 
export-related transactions where violation(s) are suspected. </p>
<p>(2) Notification of violation(s) must be in writing and should include the following information: </p>
<p>(i) A precise description of the nature and extent of the violation(s) (e.g., an unauthorized shipment, doing 
business with a party denied U.S. export privileges, etc.); </p>
<p>(ii) The exact circumstances surrounding the violation(s) (a thorough explanation of why, when, where, 
and how the violation(s) occurred); </p>
<p>(iii) The complete identities and addresses of all individuals and organizations, whether foreign or 
domestic, involved in the activities giving rise to the violation(s); </p>
<p>(iv) Export license numbers, if applicable; </p>
<p>(v) U.S. Defense Trade List category and subcategory, product descriptions, quantities, and characteristics 
of the commodities or technical data involved; </p>
<p>(vi) A description of any corrective actions already undertaken; </p>
<p>(vii) The name and address of the person(s) making the disclosure and a point of contact, if different, 
should further information be needed. </p>
<p>(3) Factors to be considered include, for example, whether the violation(s) were intentional or 
inadvertent; the degree to which the person or firm responsible for the violation(s) making the disclosure 
was familiar with the laws and regulations; and whether the violator was the subject of prior 
administrative or criminal action under the AECA. In addition to immediately providing written 
notification, persons, firms, companies and organizations are strongly urged to conduct a thorough review 
of all export-related transactions where possible violation(s) are suspected. </p>
<p>(d) Documentation. </p>
<p>(1) The written disclosure should be accompanied by copies of those documents that substantiate it. Where 
appropriate, the documentation should include, but is not limited to: </p>
<p>(i) Licensing documents (e.g., license applications, export licenses and end-user statements); </p>
<p>(ii) Shipping documents (e.g., shipper's export declarations, airway bills and bills of lading); </p>
<p>(iii) Any other relevant documents must be retained by the person making the disclosure until the Office of 
Defense Trade Controls requests them or until a final decision on the disclosed information has been 
made. </p>
<p>(e) Certification. A certification must be submitted stating that all of the representations made in 
connection with the voluntary self-disclosure are true and correct to the best of that person's knowledge 
and belief. Certifications made by a firm, corporation or any other organization should be executed by 
someone with the authority to do so. </p>
<p>(f) Oral presentations. It is generally not necessary to augment the written presentation with an oral 
presentation. However, if the person making the disclosure believes a meeting is desirable, a request for 
one should be included with the written presentation. </p>
<p>(g) Voluntary disclosures should be sent to: Compliance Analysis Division, PM/DTC, SA-6, room 200, 
Office of Defense Trade Controls, Bureau of Politico-Military Affairs, U.S. Department of </p>
<p>State, Washington, DC 20522-0602. </p>

<p>Authority: Secs. 2, 38, 40, 42 and 71, Arms Export Control Act. 90 Stat. 744 (22 U.S.C. 2752, 2778, 
2780, 2791, and 2797); E.O. 11958, 42 FR 4311: 22 U.S.C. 2658; E.O. 12291, 46 FR 1981. </p>
<p>&#167;<a name="128.1">128.1</a> Exclusion of functions from the Administrative Procedure Act. </p>
<p>The Arms Export Control Act authorizes the President to control the import and export of defense articles 
and services in furtherance of world peace and the security and foreign policy of the United States. It 
authorizes the Secretary of State to make decisions on whether license applications or other written 
requests for approval shall be granted, or whether exemptions may be used. It also authorizes the Secretary 
of State to revoke, suspend or amend licenses or other written approvals whenever the Secretary deems 
such action to be advisable. The administration of the Arms Export Control Act is a foreign affairs 
function and is thus encompassed within the meaning of the military and foreign affairs exclusion of the 
Administrative Procedure Act and is thereby expressly exempt from various provisions of that Act. 
Because the exercising of the foreign affairs function, including the decisions required to implement the 
Arms Export Control Act, is highly discretionary, it is excluded from review under the Administrative 
Procedure Act. </p>
<p>&#167;<a name="128.2">128.2</a> Administrative Law Judge </p>
<p>The Administrative Law Judge referred to in this part is an Administrative Law Judge appointed by the 
Department of State or of the Department of Commerce, as provided in 15 CFR 788.2. The Administrative 
Law Judge is authorized to exercise the powers and perform the duties provided for in Secs. 127.7, 127.8, 
and 128.3 through 128.16 of this subchapter. </p>
<p>&#167;<a name="128.3">128.3</a> Institution of administrative proceedings. </p>
<p>(a) Charging letters. The Director, Office of Defense Trade Control, with the concurrence of the Office of 
the Legal Adviser, Department of State, may initiate proceedings to impose debarment or civil penalties in 
accordance with &#167;127.7 or &#167;127.10 of this subchapter respectively. Administrative proceedings shall be 
initiated by means of a charging letter. The charging letter will state the essential facts constituting the 
alleged violation and refer to the regulatory or other provisions involved. It will give notice that if the 
respondent to answer the charges with 30 days, as provided in &#167;128.5(a), and indicate that a failure to 
answer will be taken as an admission of the truth of the charges. It will inform the respondent that he or she 
is entitled to an oral hearing if a written demand for one is filed with the answer or within 7 days after 
service of the answer. The respondent will also be informed that he or she may, if so desired, be 
represented by counsel of his or her choosing. Charging letters may be amended from time to time, upon 
reasonable notice. </p>
<p>(b) Service. A charging letter is served upon a respondent: </p>
<p>(1) If the respondent is a resident of the United States, when it is mailed postage prepaid in a wrapper 
addressed to the respondent at that person's last known address; or when left with the respondent or </p>
<p>the agent or employee of the respondent; or when left at the respondent's dwelling with some person of 
suitable age and discretion then residing herein; or </p>
<p>(2) If the respondent is a non-resident of the United States, when served upon the respondent by any of the 
foregoing means. If such methods of service are not practicable or appropriate, the charging letter may be 
tendered for service on the respondent to an official of the government of the country wherein the 
respondent resides, provided that there is an agreement or understanding between the United States 
Government and the government </p>
<p>&#167;<a name="128.4">128.4</a> Default. </p>
<p>(a) Failure to answer. If the respondent fails to answer the charging letter, the respondent may be held in 
default. The case shall then be referred to the Administrative Law Judge for consideration in a manner as 
the Administrative Law Judge may consider appropriate. Any order issued shall have the same effect as an 
order issued following the disposition of contested charges. </p>
<p>(b) Petition to set aside defaults. Upon showing good cause, any respondent against whom a default order 
has been issued may apply to set aside the default and vacate the order entered thereon. The petition shall 
be submitted to duplicate to the Assistant Secretary for Political-Military Affairs, U.S. Department of 
State, 2201 C Street, NW., Washington, DC 20520. The Director will refer the petition to the 
Administrative Law Judge for consideration and a recommendation. The Administrative law Judge will 
consider the application and may order a hearing and require the respondent to submit further evidence in 
support of his or her petition. The filing of a petition to set aside a default does not in any manner affect an 
order entered upon default and such order continues in full force and effect unless a further order is made 
modifying or terminating it. </p>
<p>&#167;<a name="128.5">128.5</a> Answer and demand for oral hearing. </p>
<p>(a) When to answer. The respondent is required to answer the charging letter within 30 days after service. </p>
<p>(b) Contents of answer. An answer must be responsive to the charging letter. It must fully set forth the 
nature of the respondent's defense or defenses. In the answer, the respondent must admit or deny 
specifically each separate allegation of the charging letter, unless the respondent is without knowledge, in 
which case the respondent's answer shall so state and the statement shall operate as denial. Failure to deny 
or controvert any particular allegation will be deemed an admission thereof. The answer may set forth 
such additional or new </p>
<p>matter as the respondent believes support a defense or claim of mitigation. Any defense or partial defense 
not specifically set forth in an answer shall be deemed waived. Evidence offered thereon by the 
respondent at a hearing may be refused except upon good cause being shown. If the respondent does not 
demand an oral hearing, he or she shall transmit, within seven (7) days after the service of his or her 
answer, original or photocopies of all correspondence, papers, records, affidavits, and other documentary 
or written evidence having any bearing upon or connection with the matters in issue. If any such materials 
are in language other than English, translations into English shall be submitted at the same time. </p>
<p>(c) Submission of answer. The answer, written demand for oral hearing (if any) and supporting evidence 
required by Sec. 128.5(b) shall be in duplicate and mailed or delivered to the Office of </p>
<p>Administrative Law Judge, United States Department of Commerce, Room H-6716. 14th Street and 
Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20230. A copy shall be simultaneously mailed to the Director, 
Office of Defense Trade Controls, SA-6, Room 200, Department of State, Washington, DC </p>
<p>20522-0602, or delivered to the 21st street entrance of the Department of State, 2201 C Street, NW., 
Washington, DC addressed to Director, Office of Defense Trade Controls, SA-6, Room 200, Department 
of State, Washington, DC 20522-0602. </p>
<p>&#167;<a name="128.6">128.6</a> Discovery. </p>
<p>(a) Discovery by the respondent. The respondent, through the Administrative Law Judge, may request from 
the Office of Defense Trade Controls any relevant information, not privileged, that may be </p>
<p>necessary or helpful in preparing a defense. The Office of Defense Trade Controls may provide any 
relevant information, not privileged, that may be necessary or helpful in preparing a defense. The Office of 
Defense Trade Controls may supply summaries in place or original documents and may withhold 
information from discovery if the interests of national security or foreign policy so require, or if necessary 
to comply with any statute, executive order or regulation requiring that the information may not be 
disclosed. The respondent may request the Administrative Law Judge to request any relevant information, 
books, records, or other evidence, from any other person or government agency so long as the request is 
reasonable in scope and not unduly burdensome. </p>
<p>(b) Discovery by the Office of Defense Trade Controls. The Office of Defense Trade Controls or the 
Administrative Law Judge may request from the respondent admissions of facts, answers to 
interrogatories, the production of books, records, or other relevant evidence, so long as the request is 
relevant and material, reasonable in scope, and not unduly burdensome. </p>
<p>(c) Subpoenas. At the request of any party, the Administrative Law Judge may issue subpoenas, returnable 
before him, requiring the attendance of witnesses and the production of books, records, and other 
documentary or physical evidence determined by he Administrative Law Judge to be relevant and material 
to the proceedings, reasonable in scope, and not unduly burdensome. </p>
<p>(d) Enforcement of discovery rights. If the Office of Defense Trade Controls fails to provide the 
respondent with information in its possession which is not otherwise available and which is necessary to 
the respondent's defense, the Administrative Law Judge may dismiss the charges on her or his own motion 
or on a motion of the respondent. If the respondent fails to respond with reasonable diligence to the 
requests for discovery by the Office of Defense Trade Controls or the Administrative Law Judge, on her or 
his own motion or motion of the Office of Defense Trade Controls, and upon such notice to the respondent 
as the Administrative Law Judge may direct, may strike respondent's answer and declare the respondent in 
default, or make any other ruling which the Administrative Law Judge deems necessary and just under the 
circumstances. If a third party fails to respond to the request for information, the Administrative Law Judge 
shall consider whether the evidence sought is necessary to a fair hearing, and if it is so necessary that a 
fair hearing may not be held without it, the Administrative Law Judge shall dismiss the charges. </p>
<p>&#167;<a name="128.7">128.7</a> Prehearing conference. </p>
<p>(a)(1) The Administrative Law Judge may, upon his own motion or upon motion of any party, request the 
parties or their counsel to a prehearing conference to consider: </p>
<p>(i) Simplification of issues; </p>
<p>(ii) The necessity of desirability of amendments to pleadings; </p>
<p>(iii) Obtaining stipulations of fact and of documents to avoid </p>
<p>unnecessary proof; or </p>
<p>(iv) Such other matter as may expedite the disposition of the proceeding. </p>
<p>(2) The Administrative Law Judge will prepare a summary of the action agreed upon or taken at the 
conference, and will incorporate therein any written stipulations or agreements made by the parties. </p>
<p>(3) The conference proceedings may be recorded magnetically or taken by a reporter and transcribed, and 
filed with the Administrative Law Judge. </p>
<p>(b) If a conference is impracticable , the Administrative Law Judge may request the parties to correspond 
with the person to achieve the purposes of a conference. The Administrative Law Judge shall prepare a 
summary of action taken as in the case of a conference. </p>
<p>&#167;<a name="128.8">128.8</a> Hearings. </p>
<p>(a) A respondent who had not filed a timely written answer is not entitled to a hearing, and the case may 
be considered by the Administrative Law Judge as provided in Sec. 128.4(a). If any answer is filed, but no 
oral hearing demanded, the Administrative Law Judge may proceed to consider the case upon the written 
pleadings and evidence available. The Administrative Law Judge may provide for the making of the 
record in such manner as the Administrative Law Judge deems appropriate. If respondent answers and 
demands an oral hearing, the Administrative Law Judge, upon due notice, shall set the case for hearing, 
unless a respondent has raised in his answer no issues of material fact to be determined. If respondent fails 
to appear at a scheduled hearing, the hearing nevertheless may proceed in respondent's absence. The 
respondent's failure to appear will not affect the validity of the hearing or any proceedings or action 
thereafter. </p>
<p>(b) The Administrative Law Judge may administer oaths and affirmations. Respondent may be represented 
by counsel. Unless otherwise agreed by the parties and the Administrative Law Judge the proceeding will 
be taken by a reporter or by magnetic recording, transcribed, and filed with the Administrative Law Judge. 
Respondent may examine the transcript and may obtain a copy upon payment of proper costs. </p>
<p>&#167;<a name="128.9">128.9</a> Proceedings before and report of Presiding Official. </p>
<p>(a) The Administrative Law Judge may conform any part of the proceedings before him or her to the 
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The record may be made available in any other administrative or other 
proceeding involving the same respondent. </p>
<p>(b) The Administrative Law Judge, after considering the record, will prepare a written report. The report 
will include findings of fact, findings of law, a finding whether a law or regulation has been violated, and 
the Administrative Law Judge's recommendations. It shall be transmitted to the Assistant Secretary for 
Political-Military Affairs, Department of State. </p>
<p>&#167;<a name="128.10">128.10</a> Disposition of proceedings. </p>
<p>Where the evidence is not sufficient to support the charges, the Director, Office of Defense Trade Controls 
or the Administrative Law Judge will dismiss the charges. Where the Administrative Law Judge finds that 
a violation has been committed, the Administrative Law Judge's recommendation shall be advisory only. 
The Assistant Secretary for Political-Military Affairs will review the record, consider the report of the 
Administrative Law Judge, and make an appropriate disposition of the case. The Director may issue an 
order debarring the respondent from participating in the export of defense articles or technical data or the 
furnishing of defense services as provided in Sec. 127.7 of this subchapter, impose a civil penalty as 
provided in Sec. 127.10 of this subchapter or take such action as the Administrative Law Judge deems 
appropriate. Any debarment order will be effective for the period of time specified therein and may 
contain such additional terms and conditions as are deemed appropriate. A copy of the order together with 
a copy of the Administrative Law Judge's report will be served upon the respondent. </p>
<p>&#167; <a name="128.11">128.11</a> Consent Agreements </p>
<p>(a) The Office of Defense Trade Controls and the respondent may, by agreement, submit to the 
Administrative Law Judge a proposal for the issuance of a consent order. The Administrative Law Judge 
will review the facts of the case and the proposal and may conduct conferences with the parties and may 
require the presentation of evidence in the case. If the Administrative Law Judge does not approve the 
proposal, the Administrative Law Judge will notify the parties and the case will proceed as though no 
consent proposal had been made. If the proposal is approved, the Administrative Law Judge will report 
the facts of the case along with recommendations to the Assistant Secretary for Political-Military Affairs. 
If the Assistant Secretary for Political-Military Affairs does not approve the proposal, the case will 
proceed as though no consent proposal had been made. If the Assistant Secretary for Political-Military 
Affairs approves the proposal, an appropriate </p>
<p>order may be issued. </p>
<p>(b) Cases may also be settled prior to service of a charging letter. In such an event, a proposed charging 
letter shall be prepared, and a consent agreement and order shall be submitted for the approval and 
signature of the Assistant Secretary for Political-Military Affairs, and no action by the Administrative Law 
Judge shall be required. Cases which are settled may not be reopened or appealed. </p>
<p>&#167;<a name="128.12">128.12</a> Rehearings. </p>
<p>The Administrative Law Judge may grant a rehearing or reopen a proceeding at any time for the purpose of 
hearing any relevant and material evidence which was not known or obtainable at the time of the original 
hearing. A report for rehearing or reopening must contain a summary of such evidence, and must explain 
the reasons why it could not have been presented at the original hearing. The Administrative Law Judge 
will inform the parties of any further hearing, and will conduct such hearing and submit a report and 
recommendations in the same manner as provided for the original proceeding (Described in Sec. 128.10). </p>
<p>&#167;<a name="128.13">128.13 </a>Appeals. </p>
<p>(a) Filing of appeals. An appeal must be in writing, and be addressed to and filed with the Under 
Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security Affairs, Department of State, Washington, 
DC 20520. An appeal from a final order denying export privileges or imposing civil penalties must be 
filed within 30 days after receipt of a copy of the order. If the Under Secretary cannot for any reason act on 
the appeal, he or she may designate another Department of State official to receive and act on the appeal. </p>
<p>(b) Grounds and conditions for appeal. The respondent may appeal from the debarment or from the 
imposition of a civil penalty (except the imposition of civil penalties pursuant to a consent order pursuant 
to &#167;128.11) upon the ground: (1) That the findings of a violation are not supported by any substantial 
evidence; (2) that a prejudicial error of law was committed: or (3) that the provisions of the order are 
arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion. The appeal must specify upon which of these grounds the 
appeal is based and must indicate from which provisions of the order the appeal is taken. An appeal from 
an order issued upon default will not be entertained if the respondent has failed to seek relief as provided 
in &#167;128.4(b). </p>
<p>(c) Matters considered on appeal. An appeal will be considered upon the basis of the assembled record. 
This record consists of (but is not limited to) the charging letter, the respondent's answer, the transcript or 
magnetic recording of the hearing before the Administrative Law Judge, the report of the Administrative 
Law Judge, the order of the Assistant Secretary for Political-Military Affairs, and any other relevant 
documents involved in the proceedings before the Administrative Law Judge. The Under Secretary of State 
for Arms Control and International Security Affairs may direct a rehearing and reopening before the 
Administrative </p>
<p>Law Judge if he or she finds that the record is insufficient or that new evidence is relevant and material to 
the issues and was not known and was not available to the respondent at the time of the original hearings. </p>
<p>(d) Effect of appeals. The taking of an appeal will not stay the operation of any order. </p>
<p>(e) Preparation of appeals.--(1) General requirements. An appeal shall be in letter form. The appeal and 
accompanying material should be filed in duplicate, unless otherwise indicated, and a copy simultaneously 
mailed to the Director, Office of Defense Trade Controls, SA-6, Room 200, Department of State, 
Washington, DC 20522-0620 or delivered to the 21st street entrance of the Department of State, 2201 C 
Street, NW., Washington, DC addressed to Director, Office of Defense Trade Controls, SA-6, Room 200, 
Department of State, Washington, DC 20522-0602. </p>
<p>(2) Oral presentation. The Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security Affairs 
may grant the appellant an opportunity for oral argument and will set the time and place for oral argument 
and will notify the parties, ordinarily at least 10 days before the date set. </p>
<p>(f) Decisions. All appeals will be considered and decided within a reasonable time after they are filed. 
An appeal may be granted or denied in whole or in part, or dismissed at the request of the appellant. The 
decision of the Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security Affairs will be final. </p>
<p>&#167;<a name="128.14">128.14</a> Confidentiality of proceedings. </p>
<p>Proceedings under this part are confidential. The documents referred to in Sec. 128.17 are not, however, 
deemed to be confidential. Reports of the Administrative Law Judge and copies of transcripts or </p>
<p>recordings of hearings will be available to parties and, to the extent of their own testimony, to witnesses. 
All records are available to any U.S. Government agency showing a proper interest therein. </p>
<p>&#167;<a name="128.15">128.15</a> Orders containing probationary periods. </p>
<p>(a) Revocation of probationary periods. A debarment or interim suspension order may set a probationary 
period during which the order may be held in abeyance for all or part of the debarment or suspension 
period, subject to the conditions stated therein. The Director, Office of Defense Trade Controls, may apply 
without notice to any person to be affected thereby, to the Administrative Law Judge for an order revoking 
probation when it appears that the conditions of the probation have </p>
<p>been breached. The facts in support of the application will be presented to the Administrative Law Judge, 
who will report thereon and make a recommendation to the Assistant Secretary for Political-Military 
Affairs. The latter will make a determination whether to revoke probation and will issue an appropriate 
order. </p>
<p>(b) Hearings--(1) Objections upon notice. Any person affected by an application upon notice to revoke 
probation, within the time specified in the notice, may file objections with the Administrative Law Judge. </p>
<p>(2) Objections to order without notice. Any person adversely affected by an order revoking probation, 
without notice may request that the order be set aside by filing his objections thereto with the 
Administrative Law Judge. The request will not stay the effective date of the order or revocation. </p>
<p>(3) Requirements for filing objections. Objections filed with the Administrative Law Judge must be 
submitted in writing and in duplicate. A copy must be simultaneously submitted to the Office of Defense 
Trade Controls. Denials and admissions, as well as any mitigating circumstances, which the person 
affected intends to present must be set forth in or accompany the letter of objection and must be supported 
by evidence. A request for an oral hearing may be made at the time of filing objections. </p>
<p>(4) Determination. The application and objections thereto will be referred to the Administrative Law 
Judge. An oral hearing if requested, will be conducted at an early convenient date, unless the objections 
filed raise no issues of material fact to be determined. The Administrative Law Judge will report the facts 
and make a recommendation to the Assistant Secretary for Political-Military Affairs, who will determine 
whether the application should be granted or denied and will issue an appropriate order. A copy of the 
order and of the Administrative Law Judge's report will be furnished to any person affected thereby. </p>
<p>(5) Effect of revocation on other actions. The revocation of a probationary period will not preclude any 
other action concerning a further violation, even where revocation is based on the further violation. </p>
<p>&#167;<a name="128.16">128.16</a> Extension of time. </p>
<p>The Administrative Law Judge, for good cause shown, may extend the time within which to prepare and 
submit an answer to a charging letter or to perform any other act required by this part. </p>
<p>&#167;<a name="128.17">128.17</a> Availability of orders. </p>
<p>All charging letters, debarment orders, orders imposing civil penalties, probationary periods, and interim 
suspension orders are available for public inspection in the Public Reading Room of the Department of 
State. </p>

<p>&#167;<a name="130.1">130.1</a> Purpose. </p>
<p>Section 39(a) of the Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2779) provides that the Secretary of State shall 
prescribe regulations with respect to reporting on certain payments relating to sales of defense articles and 
defense services. The provisions of this part implement that requirement. </p>
<p>Definitions which apply to this part are contained in Secs. 130.2 through 130.8. </p>
<p>&#167;<a name="130.2">130.2</a> Applicant. </p>
<p>Applicant means any person who applies to the Office of Defense Trade Controls for any license or

foreign country or international organization. This term also includes a person to whom the required

organized under or assigned to an international organization. </p>
<p>&#167;<a name="130.4">130.4</a> Defense articles and defense services. </p>
<p>Defense articles and defense services have the meaning given those terms in paragraphs (3), (4) and (7) of 
section 47 of the Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2794 (3), (4), and (7)). When used with reference to 
commercial sales, the definitions in Secs. 120.6 and 120.9 of this subchapter apply. </p>
<p>&#167;<a name="130.5">130.5</a> Fee or commission. </p>
<p>(a) Fee or commission means, except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, any loan, gift, donation 
or other payment of $1,000 or more made, or offered or agreed to be made directly or indirectly, whether 
in cash or in kind, and whether or not pursuant to a written contract, which is: </p>
<p>(1) To or at the direction of any person, irrespective of nationality, whether or not employed by or 
affiliated with an applicant, a supplier or a vendor; and </p>
<p>(2) For the solicitation or promotion or otherwise to secure the conclusion of a sale of defense articles or 
defense services to or for the use of the armed forces of a foreign country or international organization. </p>
<p>(b) The term fee or commission does not include: </p>

regular employee of an applicant, supplier or vendor; </p>
<p>(3) General advertising or promotional expenses not directed to any particular sale or purchaser; or </p>
<p>(4) Payments made, or offered or agreed to be made, solely for the purchase by an applicant, supplier or 
vendor of specific goods or technical, operational or advisory services, which payments are not 
disproportionate in amount with the value of the specific goods or services actually furnished. </p>
<p>&#167;<a name="130.6">130.6</a> Political contribution. </p>
<p>Political contribution means any loan, gift, donation or other payment of $1,000 or more made, or offered 
or agreed to be made, directly or indirectly, whether in cash or in kind, which is: </p>
<p>(a) To or for the benefit of, or at the direction of, any foreign candidate, committee, political party,

otherwise designated as an employee or officer thereof; and </p>
<p>(b) For the solicitation or promotion or otherwise to secure the conclusion of a sale of defense articles or 
defense services to or for the use of the armed forces of a foreign country or international organization. 
Taxes, customs duties, license fees, and other charges required to be paid by applicable law or regulation 
are not regarded as political contributions. </p>
<p>&#167;<a name="130.7">130.7 </a>Supplier. </p>
<p>Supplier means any person who enters into a contract with the Department of Defense for the sale of 
defense articles or defense services valued in an amount of $500,000 or more under section 22 of the 
Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2762). </p>
<p>&#167;<a name="130.8">130.8</a> Vendor. </p>
<p>Vendor means any distributor or manufacturer who, directly or indirectly, furnishes to an applicant or 
supplier defense articles valued in an amount of $500,000 or more which are end-items or major 
components as defined in &#167; 121.8 of this subchapter. It also means any person who, directly or indirectly, 
furnishes to an applicant or supplier defense articles or services valued in an amount of $500,000 or more 
when such articles or services are to be delivered (or incorporated in defense articles or defense services 
to be delivered) to or for the use of the armed forces of a foreign country or international organization 
under: </p>
<p>(1) A sale requiring a license or approval from the Office of Defense Trade Controls under this 
subchapter; or </p>
<p>(2) A sale pursuant to a contract with the Department of Defense under section 22 of the Arms Export 
Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2762). </p>
<p>&#167;<a name="130.9">130.9</a> Obligation to furnish information to the Office of Defense Trade Controls. </p>
<p>(a)(1) Each applicant must inform the Office of Defense Trade Controls as to whether applicant or its 
vendors have paid, or offered or agreed to pay, in respect of any sale for which a license or approval is 
requested: </p>
<p>(i) Political contributions in an aggregate amount of $5,000 or more, or </p>
<p>(ii) Fees or commissions in an aggregate amount of $100,000 or more. </p>
<p>If so, applicant must furnish to the Office of Defense Trade Controls the information specified in &#167;130.10. 
The furnishing of such information or an explanation satisfactory to the Director of the Office of Defense 
Trade Controls as to why all the information cannot be furnished at that time is a condition precedent to the 
granting of the relevant license or approval. </p>
<p>(2) The requirements of this paragraph do not apply in the case of an application with respect to a sale for 
which all the information specified in &#167;130.10 which is required by this section to be reported shall 
already have been furnished. </p>
<p>(b) Each supplier must inform the Office of Defense Trade Controls as to whether the supplier or its 
vendors have paid, or offered or agreed to pay, in respect of any sale: </p>
<p>(1) Political contributions in an aggregate amount of $5,000 or more, or </p>
<p>(2) Fees or commissions in an aggregate amount of $100,000 or more. </p>
<p>If so, supplier must furnish to the Office of Defense Trade Controls the information specified in &#167;130.10. 
The information required to be furnished pursuant to this paragraph must be so furnished no later than 30 
days after the contract award to such supplier, or such earlier date as may be specified by the Department 
of Defense. For purposes of this paragraph, a contract award includes a purchase order, exercise of an 
option, or other procurement action requiring a supplier to furnish defense articles or defense services to 
the Department of Defense for the purposes of section 22 of the Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 
2762). </p>
<p>(c ) In determining whether an applicant or its vendors, or a supplier or its vendors, as the case may be, 
have paid, or offered or agreed to pay, political contributions in an aggregate amount of $5,000 or more in 
respect of any sale so as to require a report under this section, there must be included in the computation of 
such aggregate amount any political contributions in respect of the sale which are paid by or on behalf of, 
or at the direction of, any person to whom the applicant, supplier or vendor has paid, or offered or agreed 
to pay, a fee or commission in respect of the sale. Any such political contributions are deemed for 
purposes of this part to be political contributions by the applicant, supplier or vendor who paid or offered 
or agreed to pay the fee or commission. </p>
<p>(d) Any applicant or supplier which has informed the Office of Defense Trade Controls under this section 
that neither it nor its vendors have paid, or offered or agreed to pay, political contributions or fees or 
commissions in an aggregate amount requiring the information specified in &#167; 130.10 to be furnished, must 
subsequently furnish such information within 30 days after learning that it or its vendors had paid, or 
offered or agreed to pay, political contributions or fees or commissions in respect of a sale in an aggregate 
amount which, if known to applicant or supplier at the time of its previous communication with the Office 
of Defense Trade Controls, would have required the furnishing of information under &#167;130.10 at that time. 
Any report furnished under this paragraph must, in addition to the information specified in &#167;130.10, 
include a detailed statement of the reasons why applicant or supplier did not furnish the information at the 
time specified in paragraph (a) or paragraph (b) of this section, as applicable. </p>
<p><a name="130.10">&#167;130.10</a> Information to be furnished by applicant or supplier to the Office of Defense Trade Controls. </p>
<p>(a) Every person required under &#167;130.9 to furnish information specified in this section in respect to any 
sale must furnish to the Office of Defense Trade Controls: </p>
<p>(1) The total contract price of the sale to the foreign purchaser; </p>
<p>(2) The name, nationality, address and principal place of business of the applicant or supplier, as the case 
may be, and, if applicable, the employer and title; </p>
<p>(3) The name, nationality, address and principal place of business, and if applicable, employer and title of 
each foreign purchaser, including the ultimate end-user involved in the sale; </p>
<p>(4) Except as provided in paragraph (c ) of this section, a statement setting forth with respect to such sale: </p>
<p>(i) The amount of each political contribution paid, or offered or agreed to be paid, or the amount of each 
fee or commission paid, or offered or agreed to be paid; </p>
<p>(ii) The date or dates on which each reported amount was paid, or offered or agreed to be paid; </p>
<p>(iii) The recipient of each such amount paid, or intended recipient if not yet paid; </p>
<p>(iv) The person who paid, or offered or agreed to pay such amount; and </p>
<p>(v) The aggregate amounts of political contributions and of fees or commission, respectively, which shall 
have been reported. </p>
<p>(b) In responding to paragraph (a)(4) of this section, the statement must: </p>
<p>(1) With respect to each payment reported, state whether such payment was in cash or in kind. If in kind, it 
must include a description and valuation thereof. Where precise amounts are not available because a 
payment has not yet been made, an estimate of the amount offered or agreed to be paid must be provided; </p>
<p>(2) With respect to each recipient, state: </p>
<p>(i) Its name; </p>
<p>(ii) Its nationality; </p>
<p>(iii) Its address and principal place of business; </p>
<p>(iv) Its employer and title; and </p>
<p>(v) Its relationship, if any, to applicant, supplier, or vendor, and to any foreign purchaser or end-user. </p>
<p>(c ) In submitting a report required by &#167;130.9, the detailed information specified in paragraph (a)(4) and 
(b) of this section need not be included if the payments do not exceed: </p>
<p>(1) $2,500 in the case of political contributions; and </p>
<p>(2) $50,000 in the case of fees or commissions. </p>
<p>In lieu of reporting detailed information with respect to such payments, the aggregate amount thereof must 
be reported, identified as miscellaneous political contributions or miscellaneous fees or commissions, as 
the case may be. </p>
<p>(d) Every person required to furnish the information specified in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section 
must respond fully to each subdivision of those paragraphs and, where the correct response is none or not 
applicable,'' must so state. </p>
<p><a name="130.11">&#167;130.11</a> Supplementary reports. </p>
<p>(a) Every applicant or supplier who is required under &#167;130.9 to furnish the information specified in 
130.10 must submit a supplementary report in connection with each sale in respect of which applicant or 
supplier has previously been required to furnish information if: </p>
<p>(1) Any political contributions aggregating $2,500 or more or fees or commissions aggregating $50,000 or 
more not previously reported or paid, or offered or agreed to be paid by applicant or supplier or any 
vendor; </p>
<p>(2) Subsequent developments cause the information initially reported to be no longer accurate or complete 
(as in the case where a payment actually made is substantially different in amount from a previously 
reported estimate of an amount offered or agreed to be paid); or </p>
<p>(3) Additional details are requested by the Office of Defense Trade Controls with respect to any 
miscellaneous payments reported under &#167;130.10(c). </p>
<p>(b) Supplementary reports must be sent to the Office of Defense Trade Controls within 30 days after the 
payment, offer or agreement reported therein or, when requested by the Office of Defense Trade Controls, 
within 30 days after such request, and must include: </p>
<p>(1) Any information specified in &#167;130.10 required or requested to be reported and which was not 
previously reported; and </p>
<p>(2) The Defense Trade Control license number, if any, and the Department or Defense contract number, if 
any, related to the sale. </p>
<p><a name="130.12">&#167;130.12</a> Information to be furnished by vendor to applicant or supplier. </p>
<p>(a) In order to determine whether it is obliged under &#167;130.9 to furnish the information specified in &#167;130.10 
with respect to a sale, every applicant or supplier must obtain from each vendor, from or through whom 
the applicant acquired defense articles or defense services forming the whole or a part of the sale, a full 
disclosure by the vendor of all political contributions or fees or commission paid, by vendor with respect 
to such sale. Such disclosure must include responses to all the information pertaining to vendor required to 
enable applicant or supplier, as the case may be, to comply fully with Secs.130.9 and 130.10. If so 
required, they must include the information furnished by each vendor in providing the information 
specified. </p>
<p>(b) Any vendor which has been requested by an applicant or supplier to furnish an initial statement under 
paragraph (a) of this section must, except as provided in paragraph (c ) of this section, furnish such 
statement in a timely manner and not later than 20 days after receipt of such request. </p>
<p>(c ) If the vendor believes that furnishing information to an applicant or supplier in a requested statement 
would unreasonably risk injury to the vendor's commercial interests, the vendor may furnish in lieu of the 
statement an abbreviated statement disclosing only the aggregate amount of all political contributions and 
the aggregate amount of all fees or commissions which have been paid, or offered or agreed to be paid, or 
offered or agreed to be paid, by the vendor with respect to the sale. Any abbreviated statement furnished to 
an applicant or supplier under this paragraph must be accompanied by a certification that the requested 
information has been reported by the vendor directly to the Office of Defense Trade Controls. The vendor 
must simultaneously report fully to the Office of Defense Trade Controls all information which the vendor 
would otherwise have been required to report to the applicant or supplier under this section. Each such 
report must clearly identify the sale with respect to which the reported information pertains. </p>
<p>(d)(1) If upon the 25th day after the date of its request to vendor, an applicant or supplier has not received 
from the vendor the initial statement required by paragraph (a) of this section, the applicant or supplier 
must submit to the Office of Defense Trade Controls a signed statement attesting to: </p>
<p>(i) The manner and extent of applicant's or supplier's attempt to obtain from the vendor the initial statement
