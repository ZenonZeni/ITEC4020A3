<H1>Climate Change <BR>
and the special concerns of<BR>
coastal areas and small island states</H1>
<HR>
<B>A rise in the <A HREF = "fs102.html">sea-level</A> caused by 
climate change would directly threaten low-lying coastal areas and small island states. </B>A 
number of international meetings have addressed this problem, which is most serious for developing 
countries. The South Pacific Forum in July 1989 expressed concern over the effects of sea-level rise,1 
and the Heads of Government of the Commonwealth declared their support for the efforts of coastal 
and island states to protect themselves against sea-level rise in their 1989 Langkawi Declaration on 
Environment.2 None of these statements have legal force, but they influenced the climate treaty 
negotiations and they are reflected in the <A HREF = "fs250.html">1992 
Framework Convention on Climate Change.</A><P>
<B>The 1989 Malé Small States Conference on Sea Level Rise recognized climate change and 
its effects as <A HREF = "fs202.html">a common concern of 
mankind</A> . </B>The Conference was held in the Maldives from November 14-18 and issued the 
Malé Declaration on Global Warming and Sea Level Rise.3 The Declaration stressed the serious 
consequences of  sea-level rise for low-lying coastal and island states and the special responsibility of 
industrialized states.<P>
<B>The Malé conference decided to develop a programme of action.</B> This programme 
would consist initially of an Action Group, including representatives from the Caribbean, South 
Pacific, Mediterranean, and Indian Ocean regions, to develop and coordinate joint strategies to 
approach the issues. The conference also called upon all states to adopt immediate measures in the 
fields of energy efficiency, coastal zone management and protection, and afforestation. It expressed 
support for the work of <A HREF = "fs208.html">the Intergovernmental 
Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)</A> , urged industrialized countries to give financial and technical 
assistance to developing countries, and proposed the eventual establishment of a broader monitoring 
network involving collaboration with the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), the United 
Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), and the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and 
Cultural Organization (UNESCO).<P>
<B>The 1991 Noumea Ministerial Declaration on Environment and Development addressed 
the effects of climate change on the islands of the South Pacific.</B> Adopted in July by the 
representatives of 27 members of the South Pacific Regional Environment Programme (SPREP)4, it 
highlights the special vulnerability of these states and the importance of appropriate <A HREF = 
"fs240.html">energy-efficient technologies</A>, further scientific research 
into and monitoring of <A HREF = "fs102.html">sea-level rise</A>, and 
technical and financial assistance to Pacific island states. The ministers also expressed their 
commitment to control the emission ofgreenhouse gases, manage their natural resources on a 
sustainable basis, cooperate in international efforts, and implement their own strategies.<P>
<B><A HREF = "fs205.html">The United Nations General 
Assembly</A> also discussed the "possible adverse effects of sea-level rise on islands and 
coastal areas, particularly low-lying coastal areas."5</B> The Assembly's December 1989 
resolution welcomed the growing international attention the problem was receiving, urged all states to 
help the countries concerned, and recommended the issue for consideration by the IPCC, the drafters 
of a future climate treaty, and <A HREF = "fs207.html">the UN 
Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED)</A>. In April 1991, the UN 
Secretary-General submitted to the General Assembly an extensive report on actions taken at the 
global and regional levels.6 The call for support of low-lying states was reiterated by the Governing 
Council of UNEP in May 1991, which also asked the UNEP Regional Seas Programme to help these 
states build up their capacity to respond to the threat of a sea-level rise.7<P>
<B>The threat posed to low-lying coastal and island states was an important issue in the treaty 
negotiations and is reflected in the <A HREF = "fs250.html">Climate 
Change Convention</A>.</B> The IPCC’s Impacts Working Group took special note of it. At the 
<A HREF = "fs221.html">Second World Climate Conference</A> in 1990, 
coastal and small island states formed the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) to demand 
immediate action on climate change and its impacts, in particular sea-level rise.8 The problem was 
also taken up during the negotiations of <A HREF = "fs209.html">the 
Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee for a Framework Convention on Climate Change 
(INC)</A>, where AOSIS represented the interests of coastal and small island states.9 INC’s 
Working Group I agreed that the future climate treaty would have to take account of the special 
needs of small coastal and island states.  The 1992 <A HREF = 
"fs250.html">UN Framework Convention on Climate Change </A>does 
indeed address these concerns. In particular, it calls on parties to give full consideration to the needs 
of small island and low-lying coastal states when fulfilling their obligations under the treaty (Art. 4, 
para. 8).<P>
