<P>
The CRC for Robust and Adaptive Systems was established as an unincorporated joint venture in 1991 to undertake research in the fields of signal processing, feedback control systems and telecommunications. The centre seeks commercial alliances in the development of high technology products in the information and manufacturing spheres.
<P>
<H3>R&D strengths</H3>
The centre employs 15 research engineers, scientists, programmers and administrative staff to co-ordinate the interactions of about 80 participants committed by the four organisations. It has eight research projects of which the following provide direct benefits to the economy of Victoria:
<UL>
<LI>signal analysis techniques for the processing of pulse train signals generated by communication, radar and sonar systems and in industrial process improvement;
<LI>robust control systems with application in future aircraft designs;
<LI>adaptive processing in the telecommunications industry with potential applications for speech archiving, voice mail, digital answering machines and digital transmission systems;
<LI>robust array project with relevance for sonar tracking
<LI>systems optimisation in robotics and telecommunications;
<LI>practical engineering applications of Synergetics, the science of pattern formation in complex systems; and
<LI>a technology package to improve steel reheat furnace control.
</UL>
<P>
<H3>Successes</H3>
In the 1995 financial year the centre negotiated industrial contracts in excess of $300,000. Successful outcomes of the research program include:
<UL>
<LI>development of a system to measure exit temperatures from a steel reheat furnace for BHP's Western Port Hot Strip Mill;
<LI>development of a speech coder/decoder which offers unique advantages to the telecommunications industry;
<LI>development of a solution for weir control of a network of irrigation channels for the Rural Water Corporation of Victoria.
</UL>
<P>
<H3>Commercial significance of work</H3>
The commercial benefits of this work are in the available intellectual property and know-how developed for making business more competitive through the effective control of energy costs, reduction in telecommunications transmission costs and the effective control of scarce water resources through improved water management.
<P>
<H3>Why Victoria?</H3>
The centre's most significant industrial partner is BHP and the Victorian node is located at the BHP Research Laboratories in Mulgrave, Melbourne.
<P>
<H3>Training and education</H3>
The centre has had significant impact in doctoral education. Some students have completed their doctoral program and obtained employment both in Australia and overseas in industry as well as in academia. The Australian National University has changed its residency requirements to permit students to spend a minimum of one month a year and six months over a three-year period at the ANU site.
Students are encouraged to visit the BHP, CSIRO and Defence Science and Technology Organisation to gain an appreciation of end-user requirements. Students are encouraged to participate in conferences, and international travel is provided to calibrate the quality of the research of the students against the highest international norms.
<P>
<H3>Participants</H3>
<LI>Australian National University - Department of Systems Engineering, Research School of Information Science and Technology and the Department of Engineering Faculty of Engineering and Information Technology.
<LI>Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited, BHP Research Melbourne Laboratories
<LI>CSIRO - Division of Radiophysics
<LI>Sydney Defence Science and Technology Organisation
<LI>Electronics and Surveillance Research Laboratories
<LI>Aeronautical and Maritime Research Laboratories, Salisbury, SA.
</UL>
<P>
<H3>Business opportunities</H3>
The centre encourages small and medium-sized enterprises to become industrial associates. It has a policy of seeking contracts with industrial clients whose processes would benefit from the application of research results. Where relevant, the centre seeks commercial alliances in the development of high-technology products and assists industry placements for students.
<P>
<H3>Funding</H3>
The centre's cash budget for 1995-96 is $2.875 million of which $1.6 million is from the Australian Government.  <P>
