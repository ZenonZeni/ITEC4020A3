<H1>The causes of the accident and its progress.</H1>
<HR>
Untill the end of the day of <B>25 April 1986</B>, operators  of  the
forth unit of the <B>Chernobyl NPP</B> did some  erroneous  actions.  It
resulted in unstable operation mode of the reactor expressed in the decrease
of its power with unacceptably small reactivity margin  <A HREF = "sources.html">[1]</A>.  This
circumstance had combined with design drawbacks of  reactors  of  this
type (positive reactivity coefficient and instability of operation
at small power, imperfection of control and protection system <A HREF = "sources.html#15">[15]</A>
and with most serious violations of the safety operation rules
(for instance, <B> switching-off blocking of  the  reactor  protection
system</B>). After the second electroturbogenerator was  turned  off
as it was planned before in order to make an electrotechnical experiment, all these factors had led to a practically  instantaneous  catastrophic
increase of thermal power on 26  April  1986  at  1  hour  23  min
(Moscow time). As  a  result,  <B> steam  explosion occured</B>,  <A HREF = "fruin4m.gif">the
reactor and a part of the building were destroyed</A>.
Radioactive materials accumulated in  the reactor core started to be thrown out into the environment
<P>
Multiple fire sites were formed both inside the reactor  hall
and on roofs of nearby buildings  because  of  the  explosion  and
throwing out fragments heated up to high temperatures. By 5  o'clock on
26  April  1986  the  fire men smothered  main  fire  sites
except the  central  reactor  hall,  where  graphite  continued to
burn in the close vicinity of the destroyed reactor
<P>
     In subsequent days, about 5000 tons of  materials,  including
about  40  tons  of  substances  containing  boron  and  absorbing
neutrons, 2400 tons of lead, 1800 tons of sand and clay, 600  tons
of dolomite, trinatriumphosphate  and  polymerizing  liquids  were
thrown into the reactor well from <A HREF = "helabove.gif">helicopters  of  air  forces</A>  to
extinguish burning graphite and suppress radioactive release.  The flow
of different substances continued untill the  beginning  of
June 1986. It is not clear yet, whether the throwing of materials  off
the reactor  ruins  reached  its goal.  According  to  the  data  of
subsequent observations, only a small part of the thrown materials
got into the reactor well, and they mainly formed hills  with  the
height up to 15 m in the central hall of the unit 4.  Partial  filling
of the channels formed at the explosion could take place.  As  the
channels were the ways for flows of hot air leaving  the  reactor
self-heating of the reactor  core  ruins  could  take  place.  The
action could also be in the form of  mechanical  destructions  and
displacements, and this also caused redistribution of  the  energy
balance formed after the accident.
<P>
    After accident <A HREF = "sarclast.gif">the object "Shelter"</A>  was constructed. Its construction was one of the most complicated building work in the world. In condition of high radiation this unique object was finished by November of 1986.
<P>
<IMG SRC  = "sarclast.gif" ALIGN="MIDDEL"> "Shelter". Winter, 1986.
<P>
   Unfortunately, 30 persons (staff of block and fire  brigade) died 
receiving high doses of radiation. The square of contaminated area has 
been more than 130000 sq. km (by <A HREF = "estim.gif">Cs in USSR only</A>). 
Near 4.9 millions people lived on this territory before the Accident. 
All population from 30-km zone was evacuated totally. A lot of people 
were relocated.
<P>  
   Impact of the Chernobyl Accident on a Nuclear Energy Policy is tremendous. Some countries stopped national nuclear energy programs. A construction of new plants in USSR were frozen. Public opinion was directed against Nuclear Power Plants. Some plants was closed (Armenian NPP, for example. Nowadays, Armenia has decided to reactivate plant for energy production).
<P>
   Chernobyl Accident had initiated an international activity in the area of nuclear safety and nuclear emergency planning. Many countries started a development of decision support systems for nuclear accident case.
