JANUARY 1996

TAKEOVER ATTEMPTS

Takeover mania continues unabated outside our borders. Internally, so
many companies and/or oil and gas divisions are being placed on the
market, hostile efforts are usually not necessary.
Of course there are exceptions. A group of dissident shareholders try
for the umpteenth time to unseat the Tesoro Petroleum board. The
group, which includes Kevin Flannery, James Stone, George
Baker, Alan Kaufman and Robert Washburn, own about 5.7% of the Tesoro
shares. Group files a 13-D with the SEC notifying it that the group
will mail a proposal to shareholders to elect its slate of five board
nominees, which include Gale Galloway and Douglas Thompson. Group
proposes to sell the Alaskan refinery and other assets, possibly
including all of Tesoro.  The takeover battle for First Interstate
Bancorp continues to rage on.  After Wells Fargo increased its offer
to .667 share for each First share, and First had rushed into the
arms of First Bank Systems (Minneapolis), Wells reported a plan to
purchase up to 5% of First's shares.
First Bank reported Wells couldn't do that under takeover laws. That
point is still up in the air.
Meanwhile, the market price of Wells shares keeps rising, making their
offer even higher, up to $1 billion more. Wells to ask First
shareholders to reject the First Bank offer and accept its offer. The
whole deal may still come down to whether the SEC allows First Bank to
use the pooling accounting treatment of its merger with First rather
than the purchase accounting treatment, which Wells has to use. As of
last word, the SEC accountants hadn't decided, but heavy-duty
analysts argue both sides of the proposal. Near press time, First
Interstate sues Wells in Delaware court, charging securities laws
violations.
Other bank mergers include Fleet Financial Group's $3 billion offer
for the U.S. commercial banking unit of Westminster Bank PLC. Deal
makes Fleet the eighth largest in the U.S. The Royal Bank of Scotland
will merge its U.S. unit, Citizens Finance Group, with First NH Bank,
the third largest in New England and a sub of Bank of Ireland, giving
Royal Bank of Scotland a 76.5% share in the combined bank.
## UPDATES FROM NORTH OF THE BORDER
The Murwell Resources Ltd. board recommends acceptance of the takeover
offer from Icon Energy Ltd. of two Icon shares for each Murwell common
as reported last month. Offer mailed early in December.
Other takeovers reported herein include the C$380 million 
Rigel offer for Inverness the merged company to have reserves of 572
BCFG and 58.9 MMBL; the C$1.1 billion offer by Alberta Energy for 
Conwest Exploration; and the C$186 million offer by Forest Oil for 
ATCOR Resources.
Another new takeover attempt that turns hostile is made by a
consortium of a Canadian energy company, a pension fund, a Canadian
bank and a U.S. investment firm. On Dec. 17, Pembina Acquisition
Corp., which is owned 51.5% by Pembina Resources Ltd., 30% by the 
Ontario Teacher's Pension Fund, 10.8% by Allen & Company Inc., and
7.7% by T D Capital Group Ltd., an affiliate of the Toronto-Dominion
Bank, reports its intention to offer C$7 per for the shares of 
Mark Resources Inc. Hints at a possible higher offer. The group
currently holds 2.88 million Mark shares, or about 5.2%. Deal subject
to review of financial data and 66.67% acceptance.  Asks Mark for a
list of its shareholders. Group retains T D Securities Inc. and RBC
Dominion Securities to act as financial advisors. Deal currently
valued at C$354 million.  By next day, Mark shares trade above the
offer price at C$7.125 per. On the 19th, Mark board calls the offer
too low and approves a shareholders rights antitakeover plan with a
20% trigger. Mark hires CIBC-Wood Gundy Securities as financial
advisor. Pembina reports disappointment with the board maneuvers,
plans to proceed with the offer. Analysts expect a higher offer, up to
the C$8 range. Mark acquired Hillcrest Resources in a hostile takeover
earlier in 1995 and was expected to be a target.
Pembina is privately owned by the Mannix family of Calgary.
Pacalta Resources Ltd. offers C$.55 per for shares of Trax Petroleum
Ltd. Trax board sets up committee to review offer and hires CIBC Wood
Gundy Inc. as financial advisor.  In the UK, Melrose Energy PLC
continues its takeover offer for Pentex Oil PLC. Melrose offers 81 new
shares for every 20 Pentex shares, or about $31.2 million, based on
current market prices. Deal would give Pentex shareholders a 29.5%
stake in Melrose. Melrose to also issue a rights offering to raise
capital for the group, offering one new share at 34 pence for each
five shares held. Pentex board approves the deal.  Basically Pentex
Oil management (Pentex has 67 employees) will take over management of
Melrose Energy. Pentex chairman, Henry Cameron, will become chief
executive and Pentex managing director will take the same job at
Melrose. Robert Adair, a geologist who owns 60% of Melrose, will see
his stake reduced to 40% and will take the deputy directorship and CFO
job.  Melrose has few employees, but manages oil and gas interests in
Texas, New Mexico and Wyoming.  Pentex produces 6,000 BOPD from its
interests in two North Sea fields and produces about 500 BOEPD from 12
onshore UK fields.
In other European news, Statoil extended its offer for 
Aran EnergyAran Energy after receiving only 83.78% of Aran shares by
Dec. 6 in response to its 76 Irish pence per offer. By the 13th,
Statoil had received 85.43% and declared its offer unconditional.
Talisman Energy Inc. (Calgary) makes a takeover offer for Goal
Petroleum PLC (London). Offers 97.5 pence in cash per share, or about
C$275 million, and agrees to assume about C$40 million of Goal debt.
Institutional investors holding 45.5% of Goal agree to tender their

Mobil Oil Canada Ltd., cut a deal with the Canadian and Newfoundland
governments to combine the four exploration licenses they hold in
offshore and onshore Western Newfoundland and to extend their rights
through January, 2000 four years beyond the original term of two of
the licenses. The JV has drilled on one of its two licenses from an
onshore location in extreme southwestern Newfoundland and by all
reports has discovered major reserves. The JV then farmed-in the Mobil
blocks and currently is drilling a deviated hole from a land location
at the extreme northern tip of the Port au Port Peninsula. The JV has
already committed to drilling another well in 1996, probably offshore
from its first well using Rowan Company Inc.'s Gorilla IV jackup. The
group commits to at least four wells to get the consolidation.
The above has set off a frenzy of activity in the area, including
seismic and drilling plans.

83, 84 and 127, and Amerada's discovery in Block 172 will be developed
together, with platforms in Block 128
and later in Block 172. Shell will operate the project, which is
expected to produce about 300 MMCFGPD and 40,000 BLPD when fully
developed.
Mike Baugh, president of BHP's Australia/Asia region, reports in an
article in the December Journal of Petroleum Technology that

GAS PRICES

Well gas prices did some mighty strange things in December. The cold
weather in the Northeast caught everyone by surprise and pipeline
supply just wasn't enough to keep up with demand. The bottleneck at
the Henry hub appears to be the main culprit as producers in Texas and
the Rockies were unable to get enough gas through that interchange,
while Louisiana and SE state producers opened the taps wide.
Therefore, as pressure mounted for more gas to fight the cold, the
short players had to scramble to cover their positions. The capacity
restraint, the short positions and the perceived low storage levels
drove eastern U.S. and local city gate prices through the roof. Some
city gates hit $6 in the crunch. Meanwhile, the Midwest states,
although just as cold, were able to draw down their more-than-adequate
storage volumes instead of bidding in the market. Thus Chicago gates
didn't get much above $2, although that began to change at month-end,
rising to about $3.50.
The overall effect was to raise prices, but expect the effect to be
temporary. Everything depends on the weather, of course, after the
short-players get covered.
Delivered-to-pipeline spots started December in the $1.85 to $1.90
range in Oklahoma, about 25 cents to 30 cents higher than last month
and last December. By January 1, prices had moved up only slightly as
Oklahoma gas was squeezed out of the rush to the east. Prices rose to
the $2 level on an average.
Texas Gulf prices didn't fare much better. Prices started the month in
the $2.05 range, up 40 cents from last month and 45 cents to 50 cents
from last year. By January 1, prices at some points had actually
slipped to the $2 range as Texas gas also got squeezed out. Even as
the pinch got worse in early January, Texas Gulf prices only increased
about 10 cents.
However, Louisiana spots were a different game. At the start of
December, Louisiana spots were in the $2.20-$2.25 range, up 45 cents
to 50 cents from last month and 55 cents to 65 cents from last year.
By January 1, prices varied widely from the Koch Gateway in the $2.60
range to most other points paying $3.30 to $3.55. The Henry hub saw
$3.50 in early January.
West Texas prices mirrored the rest of the middle states. The Waha hub
saw early prices in the $1.75 to $1.80 range, up 25 cents from last
month and 15 cents from last year. By month-end, prices had edged up
to the $1.90 to $2.05 range.
Rockies prices couldn't even see the rally. The Opal hub started the
month in the $1.30 range, up 5 cents from November and down 30 cents
from last December. By month-end, prices had actually slipped about 5
cents. In the southern Rockies, prices weren't much better, hitting
$1.30 to $1.35.
California border prices went nowhere, ending the month in the $1.50
range.
Canadian border spots stayed in the $1.10 to $1.25 range in the West
and soared to the $2.85 to $3.50 range in the East.
Appalachian fared better naturally, rising to the $3.70 to $3.85 range
by month-end.
Futures prices were a different story. Early December quotes for
February delivery were in the $2 to $2.15 range. By late month, that
had soared to the $2.05 to $2.35 range and by early January, futures
on the NYMEX hit the $3 to $3.10 range for February deliveries.
Gas storage volumes, of course, began to plummet. On December 1, the
AGA estimated storage at 83% full with 2.66 TCFG, down 9% from last
Dec. 1, some 73 BCFG pulled out in the last week of November. By the
end of the third week of December, storage had dropped to 70% of
capacity, after 154 BCF was pulled the week before, down 15% from last
year. No later figures were in, but you can bet Northeast storage
volumes were hitting rock bottom.
The above classically illustrates the dangers of speculative trading
in gas futures. It also dramatically puts the finger on problem areas
the Henry hub and the still low volume of peaking gas storage
facilities in the Northeast. This is one time when the LDC buyers got
caught short trying to drive down gas prices.

EDITOR'S COMMENTARY

Interesting article in the December JPT called "Heterogeneity,
Geostatistics, Horizontal Wells and Blackjack Poker," by Dennis
Beliveau dealing specifically with horizontal wells, but more
particularly about predicting outcomes when dealing with wells and
reservoirs.
I see a study of average annual pay for various industry groups in
Houston listed oil and gas extraction workers at $35,848/year.
Security brokers led the list at $87,747 followed by electric, gas
and sanitary services at $42,052 (!). Transportation equipment workers
came in at $37,765 per.
Louisiana reports monthly state employment in oil and gas extraction
averaged about 48,100 workers over the first nine months of 1995, up
from 44,700 in 1994. Experts expect that to increase to about 50,000
in 1996.
The Oklahoma Geological Survey reports that half of the state's gas is
produced by 3,200 small operators from leases that produce less than 1
MMCFGPD.
Exxon to help pay for an equipment upgrade on Sonat Offshore's
Discoverer Seven Seas and has contracted the drillship for deep water
wells worldwide over the next two years.
The deepwater royalty relief in the recently signed bill ending
Alaskan crude export restrictions is a nice boon to Gulf producers.
All new leases in waters of 200 meters or better qualify. No royalty
due on first 17.5 MMBOE in depths of 200 to 400 meters, on the first
52.5 MMBOE between 400 and 800 meters and on the first 87.5 MMB deeper
than 800 meters.
And, where do these utilities get these new names? Yikes!
