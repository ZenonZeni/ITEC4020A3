The seventh SCAR International Biology Symposium will be held Monday 31 August to Friday 4 September 1998 at the Univ
ersity of Canterbury, Christchurch, New Zealand.  The International Steering Committee, in conjunction with the local
 organising committee has selected the theme <i>Antarctic Ecosystems: models for wider ecological understanding</i> t
o provide a focus for the meeting.  Registration will begin on Sunday 30th August.  The meeting will last for five days,
with Wednesday afternoon free.  As in previous meetings, the emphasis will be on poster presentations.    However
 , it has been agreed that for the first time in a SCAR biology symposium, concurrent sessions will run, allowing for a
 greater number of oral presentations.</p>

 A small number of workshops will be run in conjunction with the symposium.  Preliminary suggestions include: algal 
 taxonomy, field instrumentation technology, GIS data management, measurement of UV, fish physiology.  Further details w
