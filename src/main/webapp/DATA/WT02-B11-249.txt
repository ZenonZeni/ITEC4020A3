<p>
INTRODUCTION<br>
<p>
On April 16, the President announced a new initiative that will bring<br>
together the Federal Government and industry in a voluntary program<br>
to provide secure communications while meeting the legitimate needs of<br>
law enforcement.  At the heart of the plan is a new tamper-proof encryption<br>
chip called the "Clipper Chip" together with a split-key approach to<br>
escrowing keys.  Two escrow agencies are used, and the key parts from<br>
both are needed to reconstruct a key.<br>
<p>
<p>
CHIP CONTENTS<br>
<p>
The Clipper Chip contains a classified single-key 64-bit block<br>
encryption algorithm called "Skipjack."  The algorithm uses 80 bit keys<br>
(compared with 56 for the DES) and has 32 rounds of scrambling<br>
(compared with 16 for the DES).  It supports all 4 DES modes of<br>
operation.  The algorithm takes 32 clock ticks, and in Electronic<br>
Codebook (ECB) mode runs at 12 Mbits per second.<br>
<p>
Each chip includes the following components:<br>
<p>
   the Skipjack encryption algorithm<br>
   F, an 80-bit family key that is common to all chips<br>
   N, a 30-bit serial number (this length is subject to change)<br>
   U, an 80-bit secret key that unlocks all messages encrypted with the chip<br>
<p>
The chips are programmed by Mykotronx, Inc., which calls them the<br>
"MYK-78."  The silicon is supplied by VLSI Technology Inc.  They are<br>
implemented in 1 micron technology and will initially sell for about<br>
$30 each in quantities of 10,000 or more.  The price should drop as the<br>
technology is shrunk to .8 micron.<br>
<p>
<p>
ENCRYPTING WITH THE CHIP<br>
<p>
To see how the chip is used, imagine that it is embedded in the AT&amp;T<br>
telephone security device (as it will be).  Suppose I call someone and<br>
we both have such a device.  After pushing a button to start a secure<br>
conversation, my security device will negotiate an 80-bit session key K<br>
with the device at the other end.  This key negotiation takes place<br>
without the Clipper Chip.  In general, any method of key exchange can<br>
be used such as the Diffie-Hellman public-key distribution method.<br>
<p>
Once the session key K is established, the Clipper Chip is used to<br>
encrypt the conversation or message stream M (digitized voice).  The<br>
telephone security device feeds K and M into the chip to produce two<br>
values:<br>
<p>
   E[M; K], the encrypted message stream, and<br>
   E[E[K; U] + N; F], a law enforcement field ,<br>
<p>
which are transmitted over the telephone line.  The law enforcement<br>
field thus contains the session key K encrypted under the unit key U<br>
concatenated with the serial number N, all encrypted under the family<br>
key F.  The law enforcement field is decrypted by law enforcement after<br>
an authorized wiretap has been installed.<br>
<p>
The ciphertext E[M; K] is decrypted by the receiver's device using the<br>
session key:<br>
<p>
   D[E[M; K]; K] = M .<br>
<p>
<p>
CHIP PROGRAMMING AND ESCROW<br>
<p>
All Clipper Chips are programmed inside a SCIF (Secure Compartmented<br>
Information Facility), which is essentially a vault.  The SCIF contains<br>
a laptop computer and equipment to program the chips.  About 300 chips<br>
are programmed during a single session.  The SCIF is located at<br>
Mykotronx.<br>
<p>
At the beginning of a session, a trusted agent from each of the two key<br>
escrow agencies enters the vault.  Agent 1 enters a secret, random<br>
80-bit value S1 into the laptop and agent 2 enters a secret, random<br>
80-bit value S2. These random values serve as seeds to generate unit<br>
keys for a sequence of serial numbers.  Thus, the unit keys are a<br>
function of 160 secret, random bits, where each agent knows only 80.<br>
<p>
To generate the unit key for a serial number N, the 30-bit value N is<br>
first padded with a fixed 34-bit block to produce a 64-bit block N1.<br>
S1 and S2 are then used as keys to triple-encrypt N1, producing a<br>
64-bit block R1:<br>
<p>
        R1 = E[D[E[N1; S1]; S2]; S1] .<br>
<p>
Similarly, N is padded with two other 34-bit blocks to produce N2 and<br>
N3, and two additional 64-bit blocks R2 and R3 are computed:<br>
<p>
        R2 = E[D[E[N2; S1]; S2]; S1]<br>
        R3 = E[D[E[N3; S1]; S2]; S1] .<br>
<p>
R1, R2, and R3 are then concatenated together, giving 192 bits. The<br>
first 80 bits are assigned to U1 and the second 80 bits to U2.  The<br>
rest are discarded.  The unit key U is the XOR of U1 and U2.  U1 and U2<br>
are the key parts that are separately escrowed with the two escrow<br>
agencies.<br>
<p>
As a sequence of values for U1, U2, and U are generated, they are<br>
written onto three separate floppy disks.  The first disk contains a<br>
file for each serial number that contains the corresponding key part<br>
U1.  The second disk is similar but contains the U2 values.  The third<br>
disk contains the unit keys U.  Agent 1 takes the first disk and agent<br>
2 takes the second disk.  Thus each agent walks away knowing<br>
an 80-bit seed and the 80-bit key parts.  However, the agent does not<br>
know the other 80 bits used to generate the keys or the other 80-bit<br>
key parts.<br>
<p>
The third disk is used to program the chips.  After the chips are<br>
programmed, all information is discarded from the vault and the agents<br>
leave.  The laptop may be destroyed for additional assurance that no<br>
information is left behind.<br>
<p>
The protocol may be changed slightly so that four people are in the<br>
room instead of two.  The first two would provide the seeds S1 and S2,<br>
and the second two (the escrow agents) would take the disks back to<br>
the escrow agencies.<br>
<p>
The escrow agencies have as yet to be determined, but they will not<br>
be the NSA, CIA, FBI, or any other law enforcement agency.  One or<br>
both may be independent from the government.<br>
<p>
<p>
LAW ENFORCEMENT USE<br>
<p>
When law enforcement has been authorized to tap an encrypted line, they<br>
will first take the warrant to the service provider in order to get<br>
access to the communications line.  Let us assume that the tap is in<br>
place and that they have determined that the line is encrypted with the<br>
Clipper Chip.  The law enforcement field is first decrypted with the<br>
family key F, giving E[K; U] + N.  Documentation certifying that a tap<br>
has been authorized for the party associated with serial number N is<br>
then sent (e.g., via secure FAX) to each of the key escrow agents, who<br>
return (e.g., also via secure FAX) U1 and U2.  U1 and U2 are XORed<br>
together to produce the unit key U, and E[K; U] is decrypted to get the<br>
session key K.  Finally the message stream is decrypted.  All this will<br>
be accomplished through a special black box decoder.<br>
<p>
<p>
CAPSTONE: THE NEXT GENERATION<br>
<p>
A successor to the Clipper Chip, called "Capstone" by the government<br>
and "MYK-80" by Mykotronx, has already been developed.  It will include<br>
the Skipjack algorithm, the Digital Signature Standard (DSS), the<br>
Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA), a method of key exchange, a fast<br>
exponentiator, and a randomizer.  A prototoype will be available for<br>
testing on April 22, and the chips are expected to be ready for<br>
delivery in June or July.<br>
