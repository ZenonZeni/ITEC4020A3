<IMG align=right SRC="royloak.gif" ALT="Photo of Ship">Although many of the ships were successfully salvaged, eight wrecks remain for divers to explore.  These vessels include three dreadnought class battleships and four light cruisers.  Imagine exploring a 25,000 ton ship under water!  Most of the wrecks are intact and all have a huge relief.  The tops of the wrecks are in 40-60 feet, with the bottom between 90 and 150 feet.  The battleships are 580 feet long and 97 feet wide!
<P>Besides the German wrecks, there are many others in the area and many new sites are opening up.  Divers who are qualified on TRIMIX may dive several deep sites, including the H.M.S. Hampshire, an armored cruiser that carried Lord Kitchener to his grave in June, 1916.  The Hampshire rests in 209 feet.  It is also possible to do <A HREF = "../training/nitrox.html">NITROX and TRIMIX training in Scapa Flow</A>, complete with internationally recognized certification.  Ask for more details if you're interested in this.</UL>
