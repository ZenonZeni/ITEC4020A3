This researcher guides global <BR>
public relations clients in a (News)Flash</H2><BR CLEAR=ALL>

Barbara Coons would like to say she's a long-time NewsNet user.  But she isn't.<P>
  
"I wish I'd have been using it much sooner," says Barbara, a researcher for  
the international public relations firm of Hill & Knowlton based in  
Washington, D.C.  <P>
  
Hill & Knowlton has found the service to be invaluable in a number of ways.  
The firm serves a diverse client base consisting of a variety of industries  
including healthcare, pharmaceutical, aerospace and telecommunications.  <P>
  
In the public relations arena, fast-breaking news takes center stage.  Who's  
doing what and when is what Hill & Knowlton's clients need to know.  And  
serving clients needs is what Hill & Knowlton is all about.  <P>
  
"NewsNet has become an indispensable tool to monitor breaking news for our  
clients," says Barbara.  "If a client is experiencing a crisis, I can monitor  
the wires and custom tailor our search to retrieve just the information they  
need."  <P>
  
Barbara feels the benefits of NewsNet are countless, but the best advantage is  
getting vital information- fast.  <P>
  
"I would say NewsNet's greatest attribute is the timeliness of information  
combined with the vast number of publications available.  I capture the news  
before the competitors," Barbara says.  "We're getting the news quicker and  
from a greater number of sources than we could in any other way," she adds. <P>
  
It's these advantages that give Hill & Knowlton the edge they can pass on to  
their clients.  <P>
  
"With the diversity of our clients, NewsFlash makes it easy to track projects  
for a number of clients at the same time," she says.  "I really like the way I 
can custom tailor searches to get the precisely the information I need from  
the best sources."  <P>
  
"I'll sign on a couple times on an ordinary day- and when there's breaking  
news I'll sign on every half-hour for the most up-to-date news."  <P>
  
"NewsFlash consistently performs to my expectations.  It's difficult to pick  
one instance of an excellent search- they're all excellent," she adds.  <P>
