<h2><font color="#FF6666">Options & Upgrades</font></h2><P>
<h3><font color="#FF6666">Configurations</font></h3>
The GEMINI 2000 spectrometers are available in either proton/carbon or fully broadband 
configurations for 200 and 300 MHz. The 400 MHz GEMINI 2000 spectrometer is available 
in a broadband configuration. The broadband console features state-of-the-art analog
and digitally controlled components including high-power linear pulse amplifiers, 
computer-controlled pin-diode attenuators, programmable filters, PTS synthesizers, 
and an extremely low noise/high gain preamplifier. A proton/carbon GEMINI 2000 
console can be upgraded to broadband with an easily installed, modular upgrade kit.<P>


<h3><font color="#FF6666">Magnets</font></h3>

Varian offers a variety of Oxford superconducting magnets for the GEMINI 
2000 spectrometers, ranging from new, compact 200 & 300 MHz models to 
year-hold magnets from 200 to 400 MHz. The small footprint and fringe 
field of the new lower field magnets are ideal where space is limited. 
The year-hold magnets are designed for sites with limited access to 
liquid helium.<P>


<h3><font color="#FF6666">Probes</font></h3>

Varian's continuous improvement and development of new RF-related technology 
creates high performance NMR probes for a wide variety of applications. 
Made from proprietary zero-susceptibility materials and featuring a 
computer-aided coil design, Varian's NMR probes provide superior lineshape, 
sensitivity, spin excitation, and decoupling performance. All probes 
currently available for the GEMINI 2000 have variable temperature 
capability, unless noted otherwise. <P>
<ul>
	<li><SUP>1</SUP>H/<SUP>13</SUP>C computer-switchable probes for 5-mm room-temperature 
	analyses.<P>

	<li><SUP>1</SUP>H/<SUP>19</SUP>F probes provide optimal sensitivity for proton and fluorine 
	analyses.<P>

	<li>5-mm and 10-mm broadband probes for observation of <SUP>15</SUP>N through 
	<SUP>31</SUP>P.<P>

	<li>Auto<img src="dot.gif">nmr computer-switchable probes deliver automated 
	heteronuclear spectra of four nuclei without tuning. The probe has no 
	moving parts to wear out, and is available in either <SUP>1</SUP>H/<SUP>19</SUP>F/
	<SUP>13</SUP>C/<SUP>31</SUP>P,
	<SUP>1</SUP>H/<SUP>19</SUP>F/<SUP>13</SUP>C/<SUP>29</SUP>Si, or 
	<SUP>1</SUP>H/<SUP>19</SUP>F/<SUP>13</SUP>C/<SUP>15</SUP>N configurations. <P>

	<li><SUP>1</SUP>H-<SUP>19</SUP>F/<SUP>15</SUP>N-<SUP>31</SUP>P computer switchable probes provide optimal 
	performance at both high- and low-frequency ranges.<P>

	<li>Indirect<img src="dot.gif">nm&#153; probes offer the most sensitive detection of 
	broadband X-nuclei. <P> 

	<li>Nano<img src="dot.gif">nmr probes rapidly detect microgram sample quantities with high 
	sensitivity, excellent resolution, and minimal artifacts.<P>
</ul>

<h3><font color="#FF6666">Pulsed Field Gradients (PFG)</font></h3>

Varian's superior pulsed field gradient technology is now available for 
the GEMINI 2000 in two configurations. The standard PFG module increases 
throughput by eliminating phase cycling for typical organic chemistry NMR 
applications such as COSY.  The Performa&#153; I PFG module's low-noise gradient 
amplifier ensures uncompromised stability and gradient pulse reproducibility. 
It provides higher gradient strengths and faster recovery times than the
 standard PFG module, for superior coherence pathway selection experiments 
 such as HMQC. A growing number of probes for the GEMINI 2000 can be configured 
 with actively shielded gradient coils for Performa I PFG compatibility. Check 
 with your local Varian NMR representative for the latest availability.<P>


<h3><font color="#FF6666">Additional Software Packages</font></h3>

Additional software packages are available for GEMINI 2000 spectrometers.
 FELIX FOR WINDOWS is a general-purpose processing program for 
 one-dimensional data which requires an IBM-compatible personal 
 computer operating Microsoft Windows version 3.1 or greater. This 
 program is ideal for report generation in an academic environment. 
 FRED&#153; (Full Reduction of Entire Datasets), a UNIX-based software 
 package, analyzes 2D 13C INADEQUATE data, allowing carbon connectivity 
 information to be extracted from data at previously unreachable 
 detection limits.<P>

<h3> <font color="#FF6666">Gemini spectrometer upgrades</font></h3>

All currently installed Gemini spectrometers can be upgraded to have the 
full capabilities of the new GEMINI 2000.  Select from a variety of 
cost-effective, modular upgrade packages. Check with your local Varian
 NMR representative regarding upgrade requirements.<P>
