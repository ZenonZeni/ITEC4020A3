<h2>Federal Sector Takes Leadership Role in Water Conservation in Monterey, California</h2>

Federal installations in Monterey, California signed an agreement
with the state, city, and Monterey Peninsula Water Management
District to reduce water use at Federal facilities on the peninsula,
enabling the Federal sector to take a leadership role in water
conservation in the community.  The signing ceremony formally
sealing this partnership took place on September 4, 1996 at the
General Services Administration's Energy and Environmental
Management  (TEEM 96) Conference in Monterey.  The Department
of Energy's Federal Energy Management Program is the lead
for DOE and will facilitate this partnership between:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Monterey Peninsula Water Management District;
<LI>The United States Army;
<LI>The City of Monterey;
<LI>The United States Navy;
<LI>The United States Coast Guard; and
<LI>California Department of Water Resources.
</UL>
<P>
This unique partnership for the Monterey peninsula will facilitate
Federal sector implementation of cost-effective water conservation
projects and help the Monterey peninsula area meet the water conservation
goals set by the California State Water Resources Control Board.
 Order WR 95-10 of July 1995 directed the Monterey Peninsula's
major water supplier, California American Water Company, to reduce
its use of Carmel Valley water resources by 20 percent in 1997
and each subsequent year. 
<P>
The Federal partner agencies have already been involved in many
water conservation projects.  Current water conservation activities
include the installation of nearly 300 ultra-low flush toilets
at Navy facilities, with another 200 installations obligated for
fiscal year 1997.  The Navy also provides low-flow showerheads
for its housing facilities and is currently launching the use
of a water conservation kit, which includes sink aerators for
the kitchen and bath.  The Navy plans to distribute 2,500 of these
kits.   The Presidio of Monterey has retrofitted four large barracks
with water-restricting devices, installed low-flow plumbing fixtures
in one of its eight academic buildings, and uses xeriscaping techniques
to limit water use in landscaping. 
<P>
This partnership will enable the participating facilities to expand
these activities and work towards further conservation of water
on the Monterey peninsula.  The initial focus will be on installing
low-flow plumbing fixtures while the partnership explores other
water conserving options.  Based on estimates of savings from
expanding installations of ultra-low flush toilets alone, the
Monterey Peninsula Water Management District could save between
100 and 130 acre-feet per year.  This represents a 15 to 20 percent
water use reduction for these facilities.
<P>
As part of the agreement, the parties will also collaborate to
develop information, educational materials, and technology transfer
papers describing the technologies and practices at each site
to promote these models for other Federal agencies engaging in
water conservation activities. The Federal Energy Management Program
is currently examining the potential to use performance contracting
authority in a first-of-its-kind ESPC to finance water conservation
activities on the penisula.
