<p><i>Santa Barbara, CA, November 11, 1996 -- </i>Computer Motion, the world’s leading 
supplier of medical robotics, announced the formation of clinical development partnerships 
with The Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Penn State University’s Hershey Medical Center and 
Sarasota Memorial Hospital.  These institutions have agreed to help perfect the company’s 
robotically assisted microsurgery systems and participate in the studies necessary for 
the systems to receive FDA clearance.  These systems will be used in endoscopic cardiac 
surgery procedures such as the Endoscopic Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (E-CABG), to allow 
multiple vessel coronary artery bypass grafting through holes smaller than the diameter 
of a pencil.<br>
</p>
<p>Cardiovascular disease is the number one cause of death in the United States and most 
industrialized nations.  More than 700,000 coronary artery bypass grafts and 200,000 
heart valve replacements are performed annually worldwide.  Greater than 99 percent of
 these procedures are performed as open-heart surgeries, requiring a patient’s breast
 bone to be cut in half to allow access to the heart.  This practice is necessary, as 
today’s technology is not capable of supporting the clinical demands of a fully endoscopic
 surgical approach. <br>
</p>
<p>Computer Motion’s robotically assisted microsurgical systems enable surgeons to 
videoscopically perform delicate, precise surgical maneuvers through endoscopic ports. 
 With the assistance of robotics, new procedures such as the E-CABG, will be performed
 safely and with consistent high quality.  Dr. Yulun Wang, Computer Motion’s Chief 
Technical Officer and Founder, believes that "computers and robotics can enhance the 
surgeon’s dexterity in the same way that the microscope enhances the surgeon’s ability 
to view the detail of small objects."<br>
</p>
<p>"We are seeing the proliferation of minimally invasive techniques in all the 
surgical specialties, including cardiac surgery.  The benefits can’t be ignored – 
shorter hospital stays, decreased pain for the patients, faster recovery times," 
said Joseph F. Hahn, M.D., Chairman of the Cleveland Clinic Foundation’s Division 
of Surgery.  "However, as we work with smaller incisions and smaller vessels, we 
test the limits of human physical capabilities and require the assistance of new 
technology, such as Computer Motion’s robotically assisted microsurgical systems." <br>
</p>
<p>"With conventional surgical instruments, we are not able to achieve an acceptable 
method for treating multiple vessel coronary artery disease in an endoscopic fashion,"
 said Ralph J. Damiano, M.D., Chief of Cardiothoracic Surgery at Penn State University’s 
Hershey Medical Center.  "However, with the advent of computer controlled medical robotics, 
we now have a platform of technology that will enable us to devise innovative minimally 
invasive procedures to reduce the morbidity and cost associated with these operations."<br>
</p>
<p>Thomas M. Krummel, M.D., John W. Oswald Professor and Chairman of the Department
 of Surgery at Penn State University’s Hershey Medical Center comments, "This builds
 on our long standing commitment to technology development and validation to enhance
 our missions of patient care, education, research and service."<br>
</p>
<p>Mike Rowan, Chief Operating Officer of Sarasota Memorial Hospital, said, "Over 
the past year we have studied the opportunities for realistic success in minimally 
invasive coronary artery bypass grafts.  We believe that robotic surgery offers the
 best opportunity to marry advanced technology with our surgeon’s skills to make the
 clinical leap to successful minimally invasive cardiac surgery that can be 
duplicated in centers around the country."<br>
</p>
<p>Dr. James L. Cox, Chief, Division of Cardiothoracic Surgery at Washington 
University School of Medicine, said, "I believe that the use of robotically 
assisted microsurgical systems in minimally invasive cardiac surgery will advance 
our surgical capabilities far beyond anything that is now possible.  Never has the 
future of cardiac surgery been more promising or exciting, largely because of 
innovations such as this one by Computer Motion."<br>
</p>
<p>"Our mission is to enhance surgeon capabilities, improve outcomes and reduce 
costs using computers and robotics," said Gene Wang, CEO and President of Computer
 Motion.  "We are honored to be participating with some of the world’s finest cardiac
 institutions to enable the E-CABG procedure and to pioneer the next frontier in
 minimally invasive surgery using robotically assisted microsurgical systems."<br>
</p>
<p>Founded in 1989, Computer Motion is the world leader in medical robotics.  
The Company’s core development team has worked together for more than ten years
 and holds many key patents in robotics for medical applications.  The Company’s
