STATE BANK INVESTMENT LIMITS CALLED INCONSISTENT WITH LAW

The FDIC is proposing to impose more stringent restrictions on the
exercise of equity investment powers by insured state savings banks
than Congress intended, the thrift industry asserts.
     Paul Schosberg, president of the Savings & Community
Bankers of America, contends that the FDIC proposal takes a much
narrower view of those powers than Congress intended when it enacted
them in  the 1991 Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement
Act.
     The FDIC interpretation, which the FDIC says would
put state banks insured by the Savings Association Insurance Fund on
a par with those insured by the Bank Insurance Fund, unjustly
restricts the amount a savings bank can invest in equities and mutual
funds, Schosberg maintains. He is urging the FDIC to reconsider.
     In an amendment to the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation Act, the FDICIA generally limits the activities and
equity investments of a all state-chartered banks insured by the SAIF
and the BIF to those permissible for national banks.
     The dispute between the FDIC and the industry centers
around the agencys interpretation of a grandfather clause in the
provision, which became effective last Dec. 19.
     Specifically, the provision creates a limited
grandfather for investments in common or preferred stock or shares of
investment companies.
     This grandfather exception pertains to savings banks
located in states that, as of Sept. 30, 1991, permitted them to
invest in such stock listed on a national securities exchange or in
shares of an investment company registered under the Investment
Company Act of 1940. These banks must have made or maintained
investments in listed stock and registered shares during the period
from Sept. 30, 1990, to Nov. 26, 1991 (the window period).
     Under the FDICIA amendment, those institutions could
acquire or retain, with FDIC approval, listed stock or registered
shares to the same extent that they did during the above period, up
to 100% of their capital.
     But Schosberg claims the FDIC is ignoring the spirit
and letter of the provision in its proposed rule. He argues that the
proposal defines equity security authority using restrictions that go
far beyond the discussions that led up to the FDICIA and far beyond
its language.
     The proposal divides equity powers into two groups:
mutual fund holdings and holdings of common and preferred stock.
     Under the proposed rule, an institution that had
mutual fund and equity holdings during the window period could
continue to invest in the holdings, but only up to the highest level
invested during that period. The total of all such investments could
not exceed 100% of capital.
     We will suggest that the FDIC return to what we
believe was the intent of Congress, Schosberg says. State banks
holding either mutual funds or stocks during the window period should
be permitted to invest in either type of security in the future, up
to 100% of capital.

ADC LOANS FOR HOUSING ARE NOW REGARDED AS THRIFT INVESTMENTS UNDER
THE QTL TEST

In an effort to help ease the nations credit crunch
and stimulate the housing market, the Office of Thrift Supervision is
now permitting some acquisition, development and construction (ADC)
loans to be treated as qualified investments under the qualified
thrift lender (QTL) test.
     To be eligible, the ADC transactions must involve
residential housing projects and bear little risk, according to new
Thrift Bulletin 20-2, which also offers guidance on QTL test
requirements regarding starter homes and credit-needy areas.
     ADC loans for development of commercial structures
will continue to be ineligible for qualified thrift investment (QTI)
status.
     OTS move is consistent with a Bush administration
directive asking regulators to moderate tough regulatory requirements
that discourage insured lenders from making real estate-related
loans, as long as the action does not pose a threat to the safety and
soundness of the institutions involved.
     ADC transactions received a bad reputation during the
1980s when government studies implicated them in the savings and loan
industry debacle. As a result, Congress and federal regulators
imposed restrictions on such transactions, most of which were
considered high-risk.
     For an ADC transaction to qualify as an investment
under the QTL test, it must meet the following criteria:
      Both stages of an acquisition and development loan
must be funded in a single combination. The financing must be a loan,
not an investment.
      The S&L involved must demonstrate that the property
is reasonably certain to be developed as domestic residential
housing;
      The property must be zoned exclusively for
residential use;
      The property must be zoned to permit residential
use, and the deed must have legally enforceable covenants that
restrict its use to sites for structures designed primarily for
homes; or
      The property must be zoned to allow residential use,
and the borrower must certify that he or she intends to construct
dwelling structures immediately on almost all of the property.
     S&Ls must have at least 65% of their assets in
housing and housing-related assets in order to pass the QTL test. If
they fail it, they could be compelled to convert to commercial bank
charters.
     QTL test provisions allow thrifts to include in their
qualified thrift investments 200% of the dollar amount of loans and
investments used to buy, build or develop starter homes or starter
home developments.
     To be classified as a starter home loan for QTL test
purposes, TB 20-2 says, a loan must be:
      Secured by a one-to-four family home, condominium or
cooperative, or by a development where 75% or more of the
developments value consists of such homes;
      Located in the associations Community Reinvestment
Act community; and
      Valued when the loan is made at an appraised value
of 60% or less than the median value of newly constructed one-to-four
family homes in the thrifts CRA community.
     If no median value figures are available for the
associations CRA community, OTS explains, the institution may
estimate the value by relying on data provided by the Federal Housing
Finance Board, the National Association of Home Builders or private
firms.
     Federal laws and rules also let thrifts include in
their qualified thrift investments 200% of the dollar amount of loans
made to small businesses or for construction, development or
improvement of residential housing or community service facilities
within credit-needy areas.
     The term credit-needy area includes areas within the
thrifts delineated CRA community that meet one or more of these
criteria:
      Census tracts, counties or areas in a Metropolitan
Statistical Area with median household income that is 80% or less of
the MSA median.
      Census tracts where loans by all institutions, as
reported by the most recent available Home Mortgage Disclosure Act
data, total 50% or less of the average loan volume for all census
tracts in the MSA, and the median household income is 120% of the MSA
median.
      Areas that have been designated as credit-needy by
federal, state or local government and that receive some form of
credit-related targeted assistance from such governments.
     If none of the above data are available for the
associations community, credit-needy areas may be identified after
consultation with local government and community representatives, TB
20-2 says.
      In addition, it says, if the loan is for a small
business or a community service facility,  it may be classified as
being for a credit-needy area for QTL purposes if it is made to a
small firm owned by a person whose home address is within the credit-
needy area, or if it is made to a community service facility that
primarily serves people whose homes are in the credit-needy area.

OTS, CBO DISAGREE STRONGLY ON THE INDUSTRYS CONDITION
700 More S&Ls At Risk?

Bob Duke
Are the shadows of misfortune that have stalked the
savings and loan industry for more than a decade fading or growing
larger and darker?
     Like beauty, the answer lies in the eyes of the
beholder. This was evident last week when a favorable report on the
industrys condition issued by the Office of Thrift Supervision was
shot down by Robert D. Reischauer, director of the Congressional
Budget Office.
     Although the industrys net income for the first
quarter of this year totaled $1.6 billion, a figure nearly equal to
that for all of 1991, Reischauer contended that the industrys future
remains bleak.
     He told the Senate Banking Committee that an
additional 500 to 700 savings institutions might fail during the next
three years, substantially boosting the cost of the taxpayer-financed
industry cleanup.
     Reischauer said the only reason that the industrys
condition seems  good now is that so many insolvent and troubled
institutions have been removed from the scenario.
     The cost of this effort has been high, and the
cleanup of the thrift crisis is not over, he stated.
     Reischauers comments chilled the festive atmosphere
that had prevailed earlier when OTS Director Timothy Ryan announced
at a briefing that the industrys strong first quarter earnings this
year, coupled with its solid performance last year, strongly
indicated that the industry was becoming capable of sustained
profitability and stability.
     Ryan emphasized, too, that the industrys capital
position had improved greatly over the past two years.
     Furthermore, he pointed out that the 1992 first-quarter profit
marked the fifth consecutive quarter that the industry
had been profitable. In addition, he said, this was the first time
since 1986 that quarterly net income had exceeded $1.5 billion.
     Later, in testimony before the Senate Banking
Committee, Ryan declared that the end of the industry cleanup was in
sight.
     We have closed over 700 failed thrifts with nearly
$360 billion in assets since the Financial Institutions Reform,
Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 became law, Ryan said. All
critically undercapitalized institutions that we have identified as
being nonviable should be resolved, or have active resolution
strategies in place, this year, if the Resolution Trust Corporation
is granted funding and the current real estate markets do not worsen.
     Ryan said only 37 nonviable institutions remain
unresolved.
     Reischauer sees the situation differently, arguing
that when the cleanup is finally over, it will have cost the public
$215 billion (in 1990 dollars), and fewer than 1,400 thrifts will
remain on the financial services industry landscape. At present,
there are 2,064 S&Ls in the private sector, compared with 2,096 at
the end of last year and 4,000 in 1980.
     If 500 to 700 more savings institutions go under, as
Reischauer believes, then there will almost certainly be a merger of
OTS with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. Ryan
advocates such a consolidation,  and there is considerable
congressional sentiment favoring it. Proponents argue that there is
no logical reason for the perpetuation of a costly federal agency to
regulate a shrinking industry.
     Whatever the case, OTS-OCC merger legislation is sure
to be introduced  in Congress next year by House Banking Committee
Chairman Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas, or some other member of his
panel.
     Meanwhile, in his congressional testimony, Reischauer
warned that if the Resolution Trust Corporation stops accepting
institutions for resolution by October 1993, as scheduled, and
transfers the remaining case load to the FDIC-administered Savings
Association Insurance Fund, the fund will be unable to handle the
task without additional federal resources.
     This situation has been worsened by the failure of
the administration and the Congress to agree on continued funding for
the RTC, and the premature setback of RTC resolution operations
before completing its task, he said.
     While Reischauer concedes that industry profits have
improved, he thinks the situation could change quickly if the present
favorable interest-rate environment took a negative turn.
     But Ryan maintained that capital was the best measure
of the thrift industrys safety, since it provides a buffer between
the institution and the SAIF, and between it and American taxpayers.
     Today, the industrys tangible capital is over 5% of
total assets, Ryan told the Senate Banking Committee. In the second
quarter of 1989, the industry reported tangible capital of only 3%.

OFFICE OF THRIFT SUPERVISION

Here are the most significant rules, proposed regulations
and policy statements affecting savings and loan associations issued
by the Office of Thrift Supervision, Federal Housing Finance Board,
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, FASB, Treasury, FFIEC and the
Federal Reserve. New or updated entries are marked with a star.*

*Thrift Bulletin 20-2. This bulletin says acquisition,
development and construction  (ADC) loan transactions involving
domestic residential housing now are considered qualified thrift
investments under the qualified thrift lender test.

Operating Subsidiaries of Federal Savings and Loan
Associations (92-8). This proposal would allow federal S&Ls to
establish and acquire operating subsidiaries just as national banks
are authorized to do. These subsidiaries would be distinguishable
from service corporation subsidiaries and would be empowered to
engage exclusively in activities permitted for all federal
associations. Comment period expired May 15.

Regulatory Capital: Intangible Assets (92-142). This
proposal would allow purchased mortgage servicing rights (PMSRs) and
purchased credit card relationships (PCCRs) to be defined as
qualifying intangible assets, and therefore includable in core
capital (the leverage ratio). Singly, PMSRs could count up to 50% of
core capital, while PCCRs could be includable as only up to 25% of
the leverage ratio. If aggregated, the core capital inclusion
limitation for these two intangibles is 50%. Comment period expired
May 15.

Bonds for Thrift D&Os, Employees, and Agents (91-733).
This final regulation requires S&Ls to secure fidelity bond insurance
coverage consistent with safety and soundness standards.Unlike OTS
previous standards, the rule does not require coverage under a
specific standardized form and does not specify minimum amounts of
coverage. The regulation brings thrift fidelity bond requirements in
line with those for commercial banks.

Branch Offices, Exclusive Leases, and Similar Agreements
(92-136). This proposed rule would eliminate regulations (considered
obsolete by OTS) that prohibit thrifts from entering into leases and
other arrangements that give associations the exclusive right to
occupy the premises of a chain store or regional shopping center. OTS
believes existing federal and state laws addressing anticompetitive
behavior are sufficient to address potential abuses that might arise
in this area. Comment period expired May 15.

Membership in the Federal Home Loan Bank System (91-500).
This proposed rule requires all thrifts to maintain their membership
in the system. Comment period expired May 15.

Applications Restructuring (92-134). This final rule
expedites the processing of applications submitted to OTS by savings
institutions with MACRO (examination) ratings of one and two and
which have satisfactory Community Reinvestment Act and other
regulatory compliance ratings.

Interstate Branching Rule (91-133). This final rule
permits healthy federal savings and loan associations to branch
nationwide.

Residential Bridge Loans (91-721). This final regulation
reduces to 50% from 100% the risk-weighted capital required for loans
made to builders to construct presold homes.

Regulatory Bulletin 27. The bulletin provides guidance to
regulatory personnel for the review of employment contracts and
clarifies OTS policy regarding unsafe and unsound practices relating
to executive compensation and employment contracts.

Thrift Bulletin 50. This guidance bars S&Ls with MACRO
ratings of four or five from entering into third-party contracts
outside the normal course of business unless the contract is approved
by the regional OTS director.

Thrift Bulletin 38-3a. This bulletin requires an acquired
or resulting association in a voluntary unassisted transaction tot
meet the fully phased-in capital requirements applicable at the time.

Reports, Applications, Notices Submitted by S&L Holding
Companies. This proposed rule would streamline the documents process
for holding companies.

Leverage Ratio (Core Capital) Rule (90-3039). This
proposal would impose a core capital requirement of between 4% and 5%
on institutions with MACRO ratings below MACRO 1. MACRO 1 thrifts
would continue to have a 3% requirement.

Miscellaneous Capital and Capital-Related Amendments (90-
4015). This final rule clarifies certain provisions in OTS minimum
capital standards rule, including the provision on recourse
arrangements.

Mutual Holding Companies (90-4017). This proposal would
let mutual savings institutions establish mutual holding companies in
order for them to generate additional capital.

Transactions with Affiliates and Subsidiaries. (90-543).
This rule implements restrictions imposed on affiliate transactions
by FIRREA.

Thrift Bulletin 45. This bulletin prescribes the
notification procedures that must be followed by troubled thrifts and
thrift holding companies when they hire senior executive officers and
appoint board members.

Thrift Bulletin 38-3. These guidelines set forth OTS
policies that will be applied to significant voluntary unassisted
transactions.

Thrift Bulletin 5a. This bulletin outlines the limited
capital maintenance obligations that will be imposed on acquirers and
owners of savings associations.

OTS Interim Final Rule on Loans-to-One-Borrower
restrictions.The rule generally bars thrifts from lending more than
15% of their unimpaired capital and surplus to one borrower. However,
they may lend an additional 10% of their capital and surplus to one
person if the loans are secured with readily marketable collateral.

Risk-based Capital Rule. The regulation requires thrifts
to meet an 8% minimum capital requirement, including 3% core capital
and tangible capital of at least 1.5%. Full compliance with the
standard is required by Dec. 31.

Thrift Bulletin 13-2. This bulletin urges thrifts with
more than $500 million in assets or with investments in high-risk
mortgage strips to implement interest-rate risk policies adopted by
their boards.

Regulatory Enforcement Bulletins 90-331, 90-332, and 90-
333. These policies generally are designed to create an enforcement
climate in which deficiencies at S&Ls are corrected before they can
pose a significant risk to the Savings Association Insurance Fund.
The guidelines provide that a violation or unsafe or unsound practice
by a thrift with a MACRO rating of 3, 4 or 5 warrants an enforcement
action unless the OTS is satisfied that the problems are being
corrected.

Final Rule on Divestiture of Certain S&Ls. The rule
requires owners of thrifts operating under capital maintenance
agreements to comply with the agreements before trying to sell the
institutions.

Regulatory Bulletin 24. The bulletin permits higher limits
for loans to one borrowerup to 30% of unimpaired assets and capital
surplus, or double the general 15% restriction proposed by the OCCin
cases where a qualified thrift invests in the development of domestic
residential housing.

Thrift Bulletin 38-2. These guidelines advise S&Ls that
have been operating under capital or accounting forbearances that the
forbearances must be eliminated in determining compliance with
capital standards.

Trading versus Investment. Although the OTS has completed
its policy statement on accounting for securities held for trading,
investment and sale, it has been delaying implementation to give the
accounting community time to develop its policy.

Thrift Bulletin 12. This bulletin establishes guidelines
for the use of high-risk mortgage derivative products and mortgage
swaps, and limits the use of such products by weakly capitalized and
otherwise troubled thrifts.

Excess Servicing Bulletin. The bulletin instructs thrifts
to stop overstating the value of excess servicing by refraining from
booking the asset at above-market value.

FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD

Here are the most significant rules, proposed regulations
and policy statements affecting savings and loan associations issued
by the Office of Thrift Supervision, Federal Housing Finance Board,
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, FASB, Treasury, FFIEC and the
Federal Reserve. New or updated entries are marked with a star.*

Sale of Mortgage Servicing Rights. The SEC has asked FASB
to clarify criteria for determining if mortgage servicing sales
should be treated as sales or financing.

Offsetting Amounts Related to Certain Contracts. This
proposed interpretation of existing guidance will clarify the
circumstances under which amounts recognized for forward contracts,
interest rate and currency swaps and similar contracts may be offset
in the statement of financial position and presented as a net amount.
The board has tentatively decided to let the proposal affect
financial statements for periods ending after Dec. 15.

Accounting for Investments with Prepayment Options. FASB
reached the following tentative conclusions: In the case of such
instruments as ARMs, changes caused by anticipated prepayments should
be accounted for with revised calculations of the periodic
amortization and recognized through a cumulative adjustment in the
current period. The prospective recognition of those effects (as
allowed in Statement 91) would be precluded. Deferred servicing fees
and purchased mortgage servicing rights are not included in the
project. No additional disclosures are required for entities
complying with guidance but they would be required to disclose
circumstances in which prepayments are being anticipated.
Transactions after Dec. 15, 1992, would be affected. Retroactive
application is urged.

S&L Audit Guide. The guide, drafted by the S&L Committee is
effectively complete. While little in the way of new accounting is
outlined, the focus of the guide is risk.

The Treadway Steering Committee, composed of five accounting groups,
has issued policy guidelines to combat fraud and misreporting by
accountants. The guidelines identify nine inter-related components that
interlock to form an effective internal control system.

OCC GIVES NATIONAL BANKS THE GREEN LIGHT TO BECOME FEDERAL HOME LOAN
BANK MEMBERS

The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency has
given the green light for national banks to become share-holding
members of the Federal Home Loan Bank System and to buy preferred
stock in the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation.
     This authority is outlined in two interpretive letters issued by
the OCC Office of Chief Counsel.
     Robert B. Serino, OCC deputy chief counsel, says Section 704 of
the 1989 Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act
clearly authorizes national banks to join the FHLBank System and to own
stock in it if they meet the stipulated housing and safety and soundness
requirements.
     The section repealed a provision in the Federal Home
Loan Bank Act that expressly barred national banks from becoming
members and stockholders in an FHLBank, he says.
     Serino cautions that if a national bank decides to
apply for FHLBank System membership, it should make sure it complies
with the OCCs general rules relating to prudence and appropriate
banking practices.
     For example, he says, if a national bank owned
FHLBank stock exceeding the amount required by federal law for system
members, it could create concern at the OCC.
     Serinos interpretive letter is expected to eliminate
any lingering doubts by national banks as to their authority to join
the FHLBank System as members and shareholders. Some national banks
have been reluctant to seek system membership because of those
doubts, the OCC says.
     Serino notes that the FIRREA conference report
emphasizes that Section 704s purpose is to expand system membership
to include commercial banks and credit unions that engage in mortgage
lending.
     The report says a bank or credit union would qualify
for system membership if its financial condition were sound and its
management and home-financing policy consistent with sound economic
financing.
     This expansion of Federal Home Loan Bank membership is intended
to promote and sustain housing finance and the Banks, the report
continues. The [Joint Conference] Committee believes that the
extension of membership to insured commercial banks and credit unions
that engage in mortgage lending will strengthen the Banks and their
ability to support the mortgage market.
     Serino stresses that the OCC neither encourages nor
discourages national bank membership and investment in the FHLBanks.
Such decisions, he points out, are the responsibility of the national
banks management and boards of directors.
     Meanwhile, in regard to Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation
(Freddie Mac) preferred stock, OCC Chief Counsel William
P. Bowden Jr. says in an interpretive letter that it is permissible
for national banks to purchase the stock as long as they observe safe
and sound banking practices and proper accounting in undertaking the
transactions.
     While the statutes permit unlimited investment, as with any equity
issue, there are market risks, and share prices may decline due to
changes in market interest rates, the issuers financial standing or
government tax policies, Bowden warns. Therefore, the OCC believes that
prudential limits of this sort typically are an element of safe and sound
banking practice.
     The chief counsel says Freddie Mac plans to issue its
preferred stock under Section 306(f) of the Federal Home Loan
Mortgage Corporation Act, with the stock carrying an investment grade
rating from a national rating agency.
     Congress, Bowden explains, has exempted Freddie Mac
instruments of that type from the statutory underwriting and stock
investment restrictions normally imposed on national banks.

THRIFT REGULATOR via NewsNet
June 22, 1992

APPLICATION FEES ASSESSED HEALTHY INSTITUTIONS WILL DECREASE UNDER
OTS MODIFIED SCHEDULE

Beginning June 30, processing fees assessed healthy savings and loan
associations in connection with certain significant applications will
be considerably lower.
     For other thrifts, the Office of Thrift Supervision
fees essentially will remain as they are under the present schedule
applicable to all institutions.
     Healthy institutions are eligible for lower application fees under
an expedited processing program authorized by the OTS new applications
regulation.
     To qualify for the expedited program, a thrift must
meet or exceed its minimum regulatory capital standards and have
composite MACRO examination ratings of one or two, as well as have
satisfactory regulatory compliance ratings.
     The revised fee structure for applications is
outlined in new Thrift Bulletin 48-8.
     Although healthy institution managers are delighted
with the modified fee formula, managers for undercapitalized ones
naturally are upset at the change.
     Harold L. Levi, a former Federal Home Loan Bank Board
attorney who represents several undercapitalized institutions,
contends that the new formula is unfair and that lower fees for
certain applications should be  determined on a case-by-case basis.
     Levi, managing partner in Harold L. Levi Associates
in Washington, says the formula is inconsistent with OTS general
policy of adopting rules applying to the industry as a whole.
     In any event, classification as being healthy will
mean much lower applications processing fees in some instances.
     For example, expedited interstate and intrastate
branch applications will cost $650 for healthy institutions, compared
with $1,900 for standard or unexpedited applications. For an
expedited change-of-location application, the fee will be $250,
compared with $900 for a standard application.
     While undercapitalized institutions will have to pay
$1,400 for bylaw amendment applications, healthy institutions wont
have to pay anything, since their submissions will be regarded by
authorities as preapproved.
     Well-capitalized thrifts wont be assessed any processing fee for
charter amendment applications, but undercapitalized ones will have to
pay $1,400.
     Ailing S&Ls will have to pay $5,300 for applications
involving the inclusion of subordinated debt and mandatorily
redeemable preferred stock in capital. In contrast, healthy
institutions will be assessed only $1,700.
     For a finance subsidiary application, the processing
fee will be $6,650 for a standard one and $2,000 for an expedited
filing. An application for an exemption from the loans-to-one-
borrower requirements will cost a healthy S&L $825, compared with
$2,500 for an undercapitalized one.
     For other applications, the present fee schedule generally will
prevail for all savings associations.
     Because the new applications restructuring regulation
will replace certain applications with simple notices, OTS expects
the time and cost associated with processing such transactions to
decrease.
     Accordingly, the fees relating to transactions and
activities that formerly required applications have been reduced, TB
48-8 says. The new fees are based on the existing fees imposed on
applications estimated to have similar processing times.
     The bulletin notes that the assessment schedule no
longer contains fees for applications for agency offices, temporary
changes of location, investments in office buildings, brokered
deposits, liquidity penalty and affiliated transactions.
     In addition, it points out, the schedule combines the
subordinated debt regulation with the mandatorily redeemable
preferred stock rule.
     The application fee schedule reflects that change,
the bulletin says. The fee for the combined application is the same
as the existing subordinated debt fee.
     Change of control applications will continue to cost
all S&Ls $12, 400, plus $23 to cover the FBIO background check.
