<P><FONT COLOR=#000000 FACE="Arial">Scientists and space agency officials

from over thirty countries will gather in Canberra from 13-15 November as

CSIRO hosts the most important annual meeting of world remote-sensing bodies.

Remote sensing, or Earth observation, uses satellite measurements to monitor

the world's environments, weather and resources. The meeting will discuss

plans for ensuring that international co-operation in Earth observation

from space will continue to improve. <BR>

</FONT><BR>

<BR>

<FONT COLOR=#000000 FACE="Arial">Most international space agencies are either

members or affiliates of CEOS, the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites,

an international organisation for remote-sensing co-operation. CSIRO's Dr

Brian Embleton chairs the group.<BR>

</FONT><BR>

<BR>

<FONT COLOR=#000000 FACE="Arial">&quot;Attendees at the last meeting, in

Montreal, elected CSIRO to lead CEOS throughout 1996&quot; said Dr Embleton.<BR>

</FONT><BR>

<BR>

<FONT COLOR=#000000 FACE="Arial">&quot;The election is international recognition

of CSIRO's commitment to deliver environmental and social benefits from

space technology.&quot;<BR>

</FONT><BR>

<BR>

<FONT COLOR=#000000 FACE="Arial">The meeting will include the world's first

demonstration of transferring &quot;live&quot; satellite observations from

one continent to another. <BR>

</FONT><BR>

<BR>

<FONT COLOR=#000000 FACE="Arial">The Hatoyama ground station in Japan will

relay incoming data from the Japanese ADEOS satellite to a screen at Canberra's

National Convention Centre. <BR>

</FONT><BR>

<BR>

<FONT COLOR=#000000 FACE="Arial">&quot;Delegates will literally feel as

though they are in the spacecraft looking down at Japan,&quot; said Science

and Technology Minister Peter McGauran, who yesterday announced details

of the event. <BR>

</FONT><BR>

<BR>

<FONT COLOR=#000000 FACE="Arial">Space organisations in India, Japan, China

and Australia will take part in the demonstration. <BR>

</FONT><BR>

<BR>

<FONT COLOR=#000000 FACE="Arial">CEOS is an informal association of world

space agencies, founded in 1984. Members work towards matching future Earth

observation projects with data users' needs. <BR>

</FONT><BR>

<BR>

<FONT COLOR=#000000 FACE="Arial">CSIRO joined CEOS in 1989. &quot;CSIRO

represents other Australian Earth observation bodies, and we share our experience

through CEOS for international benefit,&quot; said Dr Embleton.<BR>

</FONT><BR>

<BR>

<FONT COLOR=#000000 FACE="Arial">CSIRO will also release an educational

CD-ROM at the meeting. Aimed at developing-nations and schools, the CD will

use case studies to illustrate the social benefits of Earth observation.<BR>

</FONT><BR>

<BR>

<FONT COLOR=#000000 FACE="Arial">The CD will contain information previously

too expensive, obscure or inaccessible to be readily useable in educational

circles or in remote areas. <BR>

<FONT COLOR=#000000 FACE="Arial">1. A media conference will be held 0830-0915,

13 November, in the Fitzroy Room, National Convention Centre, Canberra.

Senior officials from major space agencies, including NASA, European Space

Agency, the National Space Development Agency of Japan and CSIRO will answer

questions about their plans in Earth observation. <BR>

</FONT><BR>

<BR>

<FONT COLOR=#000000 FACE="Arial">A list of officials participating in the

media conference, with their titles and brief cv, is available from COSSA.<BR>

</FONT><BR>

<BR>

<FONT COLOR=#000000 FACE="Arial">Please note the Plenary sessions are closed

to media. Some space agency officials are willing to be interviewed at arranged

times. Contact COSSA for information. <BR>

8 minutes, in VHS PAL format). This shows dramatic launch (17.8.96) of Japan's

latest Earth observing satellite, ADEOS, from Tanegashima Space Centre,
