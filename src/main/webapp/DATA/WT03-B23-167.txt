<P>
Basically, any individual or institution with
investable assets of $100,000 or more is a primary candidate to use a professional investment advisor. Some clients are high-net-worth individuals or professionals who find that they
do not have the time to adequately manage their own portfolios.
Others are owners of small- or medium-sized businesses who would
rather manage their own businesses than devote time to their company's
retirement plan. Finally, there are individuals who have a fiduciary
and legal responsibility to oversee a pool of funds, such as trustees
for a pension or profit-sharing plan and board members of a foundation
or endowment fund.
