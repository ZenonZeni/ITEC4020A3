<h2>PROGRAM POLICY FACTORS</h2>

<p>
Program policy factors may be used by the Selection Official to select a 
range of projects that will ensure the solicitation achieves DOE Hydrogen 
Program objectives.  Program policy factors will be imposed after the 
individual evaluations of all applications have been made by the review 
panel.  They will not be applied during the evaluation of any individual 
application.  These factors include the following:
<p>
<b>1. Diversity.</b> <p>
 <dl>To achieve technology diversity, awards are expected to be 
representative of potential uses for integrated systems in mid- to 
long-term hydrogen energy markets as well as near-term"niche" hydrogen 
markets.  Geographical diversity of Applicants may also be 
considered.</dl>
<p>
<b>2. Cost-sharing. </b><p>
<dl>All applicants are required to cost-share at least 50% of the total 
Phase I project cost from non-Federal sources.  The information provided 
in Volume 2 of the Phase I application will not be point scored.  
However, any cost sharing greater than 50% and the nature of cost sharing 
(for example, cash contributions are preferable to in-kind contributions 
wherever possible) will be favorably considered in making 
selections.</dl>
