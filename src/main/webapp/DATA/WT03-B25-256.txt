<H2>2. ACHIEVING THE OBJECTIVES<BR>
<HR></H2>
<H3><A NAME="anchor15376244"></A>2.1 Integrated Management</H3>
The CSIRO Office of Space Science and Applications provides shared facilities,
infrastructure and support for the EOC. COSSA and the EOC share the same
Head as well as common goals in their areas of common interest in space
activities and national and international liaison. COSSA and the EOC have
complementary missions and will work without boundaries to achieve them.
<H3><A NAME="anchor15376461"></A>2.2 Scientific Leadership</H3>
The EOC is set up to bring the skills of CSIRO scientists together in outcome
oriented and cooperative projects to foster research excellence in Earth
Observation science and provide national leadership in the foundation scientific
knowledge serving this area of activity. 
<H3><A NAME="anchor15376847"></A>2.3 Client Applications Focus</H3>
The client focus of the EOC will include 
<BLOCKQUOTE>CSIRO Divisions,<BR>
Software and hardware suppliers<BR>
Consultants,<BR>
Fegeral and State Agencies (eg ERIN, NRIC, BRS)<BR>
Data providers<BR>
Universities and other educational institutions and <BR>
the Value Added industry that delivers or uses Earth Observation products.</BLOCKQUOTE>
These clients often support a variety of end uses with their data and value
added products. The EOC will act to underpin this broad delivery industry
through the excellence of CSIRO research and developments and the quality
of products this creates.<BR>
<BR>
The Earth Observation data provision and user industry comprises a diverse
range of groups. There are those that generate raw data, those that collect,
process and archive it into base data (such as the Bureau of Meteorology
and ACRES), those that develop it into higher level products as well as
those that produce value added products and deliver them to the end user
community. Their markets include: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>Mapping &amp; assessment;<BR>
Meteorology;<BR>
Land resources &amp; monitoring;<BR>
Water resources;<BR>
Agricultural resources;<BR>
Rangelands;<BR>
Forestry &amp; forest systems;<BR>
Coastal, marine &amp; estuarine environment;<BR>
Catchments &amp; water quality; and<BR>
Environmental impact.</BLOCKQUOTE>
In general, this end user community is product oriented and not concerned
with the data sources or the 'threads' of processing methodologies but rather
in the utility of the end result and its validity. The types of end product
that Earth Observation data can be used to deliver and the issues of its
validity and quality are therefore primary to EOC goals and priority setting.<BR>
<BR>
A key characteristic of Earth Observation applications is that they occur
at spatial scales ranging from less than a metre to hundreds of kiometres
and time scales from seconds to decades. To encompass this scale, the tools
of earth observation include airborne and spaceborne instruments of many
kinds and require the combined skills and knowledge of people ranging from
instrument engineer to end user. 
<H3><A NAME="anchor15379156"></A>2.4 Science Review Panel</H3>
In addition to the COSSA Steering Committee, the EOC has a Science Review
Panel consisting of a balance of scientific peers with national and international
standing and its client groups. The Science Review Panel plays a key role
in priority setting, project initiation and performance review. It will
also be asked to provide objective scientific evaluation of the performance
of the EOC. The makeup of the Panel (other than the Director of COSSA and
the EOC Science Program Leader) will change every one or two years.<BR>
The makeup of the committee will be: 
<UL>
<LI>Independently elected Chairman 
<LI>Head of COSSA 
<LI>Science Program Leader, EOC 
<LI>Agency Client Representative (eg Bureau of Meteorology) 
<LI>Industry/Divisional Client Representative 
<LI>International Scientific Representatives (2) 
<LI>International Agency Representative 
</UL>
<H3><A NAME="anchor15379288"></A>2.5 Funding</H3>
The sources of funding for EOC activities can come from EOC core funds which
are allocated to focus areas by the COSSA Steering Committee; contributions
from participating Divisions based on their Sector activity; contributions
from other participating groups; or external support sought by the EOC on
behalf of all the contributing groups to a particular activity.<BR>
<BR>
Equity and return are defined against the contributions of the participants
and the objectives of the participants and their client groups. In general,
contributions from the client industrial sectors will be sought when the
products are immediately useful and beneficial to them whereas base EOC
funds will generally be used to support more strategic activities and activities
with longer term benefits. Intellectual Property is owned on the basis of
contributions which will be agreed in the development of the collaborative
project plans.<BR>
