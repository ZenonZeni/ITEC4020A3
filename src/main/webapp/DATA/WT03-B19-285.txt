Rich in history, Benalla is a well established provincial city
with a regional population of 15,000.  The city is set in picturesque
park lands beside Lake Benalla.
<P>
Benalla's central location is just as important now as when it
was a busy trading centre en route to the nearby gold fields.
 The Midland Highway runs south to Mansfield and west through
Shepparton to Bendigo and Adelaide.
<P>
Benalla and District is the centre of one of the most productive
and diverse rural areas in Victoria.  The main enterprises are
fat lamb production and broad acre cropping, and wheat and oats
are the dominant grains.  The higher rainfall areas of the Great
Dividing Range to the south are well suited to prime beef production.

<H2>Expansion program</H2>

<P>
<img src="gifs2/benalla1.gif" align=right>
Benalla was once economically dependent on seventeen State and
Federal Government offices, situated there because of its central
location.  In the 1970s, however, the district embarked on an
important and diverse industrial expansion program.
<P>
That initiative was further assisted by the State Government's
decentralisation incentives, and was successful in attracting
companies such as ASET, an electrical transformer manufacturer
now owned by the Schneider Group, Striker Sportswear, a clothing
manufacturer, and Centique, which manufactures plumbing, tapware
and bathroom accessories.
<P>
Other local employers include Benalla Spinners, now owned by Godfrey
Hirst, and Monsbent, which converts locally grown softwood into
particle board for the construction industry.
<P>
The location of these nationally recognised companies is testament
to the district's suitability as a competitive manufacturing destination
and national distribution centre.
<P>
Australian Defence Industries has constructed a major facility
there.  The company chose Benalla, following a nationwide search,
as the most appropriate location for its $160 million ammunition
manufacturing factory.
<H2>Opportunities for value adding</H2>

<P>
A recent study confirmed that opportunities exist for value adding
enterprises such as wool scouring, sheep skin tanning and processing
for export markets in Europe, Japan and the USA.  There are agrifood,
(horticulture, meat), wood and timber products opportunities.
<H2>Infrastructure</H2>

<P>
Benalla is particularly well placed with transport and distribution
and its existing energy infrastructure.
<P>
The main Bass Strait/Albury-Wodonga gas transmission passes through
Benalla, providing an unrestricted supply.  A secure high voltage
(22KV) electricity supply is maintained via two 66KV feeders from
the Glenrowan terminal station.  Recent duplication of the Water
Board's main supply pipeline will cater for the anticipated expanding
demand during the next twenty years.
<P>
The Hume Highway gives direct access to Melbourne and Sydney,
and the Midland Highway runs south to Mansfield and west through
Shepparton to Bendigo and Adelaide.  Benalla has easy access to
the Newell Highway.
<P>
The town is located on the Melbourne-Sydney rail link and is part
of V-Line's rail Freight Gate network, providing a coordinated
rail and road service throughout the state and links with similar
services interstate.
<H2>Industrial assistance</H2>

<P>
Over the years the Benalla City Council has developed a flexible
financial assistance policy capable of addressing the individual
requirements of each enquiry.  Assessment is based largely on
capital expenditure, potential jobs created, both directly and
indirectly from the enterprise, and environmental considerations.
<P>
A range of traditional and innovative allocations and schemes
is available and negotiable, including:
<P>
Financial assistance for purchase of land and buildings with lease/purchase
options at attractive interest rates.
<UL>
<LI>Relocation assistance, including the Newcomers Club, with
introduction to Community Services Officer for employees and new
arrivals programs.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Participation in the City of Benalla Local Housing Scheme.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Assistance with the provision of services.
</UL>

<P>

<P>
Local authorities and Benalla Development Inc. are currently establishing
a new, high profile investment estate.  It will cater for a range
of light to medium industries in a fully landscaped and serviced
development.
<P>
Guidelines guaranteeing to fast-track and simplify the approval
processes from planning through to construction and completion
have been drawn up.  The Development Committee offers support
and assistance long after establishment.


<H2>Glide, ski, drag race, balloon</H2>

<P>
Tourism is big business in Benalla.  With many natural and man
made attractions, the district's tourist industry offers wonderful
opportunities for growth.  A superb climate year-round enables
active participation in all sports and leisure pursuits.
<P>
Some of Victoria's premium wines are produced at vineyards such
as H.J.T. and Baileys, with cellars for tastings within easy reach
of the city.
<P>
The Benalla Rose Festival is a community based festival held annually
in November when the city's roses are in bloom.  The festival
attracts visitors from all over Australia, who enjoy the wide
range of cultural and leisure activities offered.
<P>
Benalla's aerodrome is headquarters to the Gliding Club of Victoria,
and its ideal weather has earned Benalla a world wide reputation
as a safe and picturesque cross-country flying venue. As host to
regular national and international events, Benalla is Australia's
gliding capital.  It is also being considered for the State's
hot air ballooning headquarters.
<P>
Australia's best snow fields are only an hour's drive away, permitting
comfortable day trips into the scenic Victorian Alps and providing
access to three major ski resorts.
<P>
Winton Motor Raceway hosts many national events such as the Formula
Ford, HQ Nationals and the Yokohama 300 km endurance race.  Other
weekly car and motorcycle events attract crowds of up to 12,000,
and plans are under way to include a world class drag racing strip
within the complex.  Facilities are currently being expanded to
cater for up to 30,000 spectators.
<H2>Education</H2>
<P>
A TAFE college was re-established in January 1993 to satisfy the
needs of industry and the general community.  Following an overwhelming
response, the Office of Technical and Further Education decided
to include a permanent facility in the 1994 capital works program.
The new building will be designed in accordance with the program
profile and will include educational pathways leading to first
year university studies.
