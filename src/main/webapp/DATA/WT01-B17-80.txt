<P>Ever since Dr. Edward Bach, an intuitive English physician and botanist,  first developed the
39 Bach Flower Remedies in the 1930s, the use of liquid extracts made from the subtle energy
essences of flowers for natural healing has been gaining momentum in the West. In America
today there are some 1600 different individual flower essences now on the market prepared by
more than a dozen companies.


<P>But leading the field in terms of research and understanding of the therapeutic marvels of
flower essences are Kaminski and Katz. They offer the distilled practical experience of their
15 years of study and practice in this new handbook. Since 1980, they have broadened the
original Bach repertory to include more than 100 new flower essences made from American
plants.


<P>Flower essences are a do-it-yourself way of virtually redesigning your psyche. With flower
essences, you can &quot;address profound issues of emotional well-being, soul development, and
mindbody health,&quot; Kaminski and Katz explain. After providing the reader with a comprehensive
introduction to the idea of flower essences and information about how they're made, the
authors devote the rest of the book to making flower essence therapy work for the reader. All
of the essences described in the book are available in natural foods stores or by mail-order.


<P>Of immense value here is their alphabetical organization of problems and conditions, with
cross references to all the flower essences that are useful in each case.  Have a problem
with procrastination? Kaminski and Katz briefly outline 6 flower essences that can help,
depending on the nuance of your avoidance behavior. If you put off action out of fear of
failure or lack of self-confidence, then Larch may be your flower essence. Turn to Larch in
the  Repertory and you get a half page of lucid description of this flower essence and the
underlying nature of this kind of procastination.


<P>This feature alone makes the book one of the most user-friendly self-help natural healing
books around today.  Flower essences are part of an emerging field of &quot;non-invasive,
life-enhancing subtle vibrational therapies,&quot; write Kaminski and Katz, &quot;which promises to
make a major contribution to health care in coming years.&quot; When this comes to pass, it will
be due in no small measure to the contributions of this excellent book.

<P>Having troubles with your memory? Before you bemoan the supposedly inevitable decline of your
brain power and the slipping away of IQ with age, consider the possibility that your brain
tissues may be contaminated with heavy metals.


<P>New research, summarized in this valuable study from Casdorph and Walker, suggests that toxic
metals such as aluminum, mercury, lead, iron, and cadmium, can accumulate in the brain and
produce an array of behavioral and cognitive problems, from memory loss to Alzheimer's.


<P>The toxic metals come from your foods and environment,  the air and your cooking utensils,
from tap water, prescription drugs, and dental amalgams. They lodge in your brain because
your body doesn't have the energy or means to flush them out. But there is a technique that
can and the authors devote a large portion of the book to explaining how it works and to 
extolling its successes.  It's called chelation, it's been around since 1952, and 1800
medical studies have proved that it's effective for treating many conditions (See Ask  the
Healer, this issue).


<P>In the case of brain power decline, chelation gives the Alzheimer's patient an intravenous
infusion of a synthetic amino acid (protein) called EDTA, which stands for ethylene diamine
tetra-acetic acid, plus a vitamin and mineral mixture. It works, as numerous case studies
presented here demonstrate.  EDTA apparently binds with these toxic metals and carries them
out of the brain and into the blood for excretion from the body.


<P>According to Casdorph and Walker, &quot;Such findings may make EDTA chelation therapy the best
kept medical secret of the past half-century. The message of this book is that a real
breakthrough exists for stopping the deterioration of cells of the brain.&quot;  It's a message of
crucial importance and one the Digest hopes reaches many ears.

<H2 ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER>Taking to the Streets Against the Quackbusters</CENTER></H2>

Joseph Lisa, an investigative journalist, has spent the last 25 years probing into the
systematic harassment of practitioners of alternative medicine in America. In this explosive
report, he tells you why and how it happened, all the &quot;dirty politics and dirty tricks,&quot; and
who is profiting from it.


<P>Read about the conspiracy against chiropractic, the &quot;unholy medlock&quot; between medical vested
interests and the government,  and the &quot;quackbusters&quot; infamous October Plan to bust &quot;health
fraud.&quot; Study a handful of harrowing cases in which Lisa shows how  the powerful collusive
interests of conventional medicine snuffed new and promising alternative medical products
like Herbalife and NutriCology, and how they kept naturopaths, homeopaths, and chelation
therapists on the run.


<P>Lisa's resume includes time spent as a private detective and &quot;undercover operative&quot; which
explains his uncanny knack at putting his fingers on the most outrageous and incriminating
documents that reveal what the conspirators  are doing in the dark. What's it all about? &quot;The
vested interests want the whole pie and thus more of the profits available in the healthcare
marketplace,&quot; Lisa says.
Reading Lisa is like stumbling upon the secret memos of the CIA regarding their plans for the
internal affairs of small governments. If you've ever protested injustices in your life, like
the Vietnam War or civil rights, this book will surely drive you out into the streets with
reawakened 1960's zeal. In case you're feeling complacent or disinterested in politics in the
1990s, reading even a couple chapters of Lisa will set a fire under your bottom.


<P>In case you find yourself mobilizing in the streets, Lisa has a shopping list of very
political and legal steps to take. File a formal complaint with the Federal Trade Commission;
initiate individual and class action lawsuits; look into filing Rico conspiracy and antitrust
suits; write your Congressmen; organize media events; make noise; act up; and don't settle
for less than a radical upheaval of the &quot;medlock&quot; status quo.

<P>Dr. Sherry  Rogers, one of the country's leading practitioners of environmental medicine, now
offers us an excellent new work designed to instruct physicians and patients alike.


<P>Dr. Rogers' own story is a classic tale of the wounded healer. Over the years she's struggled
to cure herself of serious allergic problems and to understand the mechanisms of illness and
treatment. Even though she is a physician, she understands that, &quot;the patient is the keeper
of the keys to wellness.&quot;


<P>She also knows from her two decades of practice and study that there is &quot;a whole silent
underground of people who have done the impossible&quot;-healed when they shouldn't have, that is,
according to conventional medicine. &quot;The patient dedicated to wellness against all odds
actually has to go to medical school, so to speak.&quot;


<P>Rogers' strong suits are a macrobiotic diet, nutritional supplementation, and systemic
detoxification, for which she provides detailed biochemical reasons. Her new book is rich
with techniques for  body purification, using enzymes, live juices, bowel cleansing, baths, 
and nutritional supplementation. Study Rogers: the time it takes for a careful reading is an
investment that will repay you many times over in better health.

<H2 ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER>Video: Cancer Doesn't Scare Me Anymore!</CENTER></H2>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Lorraine Day, M.D., 
<BR>Rockford Press, P.O. Box 952, Rancho Mirage, CA, 92270; VHS-Color, 77 minutes, $19.95. Tel:

<P>Cancer doesn't scare Dr. Lorraine Day anymore because like 1 out of every 3 Americans she
developed cancer, but unlike most of that vast number, she got well, with no thanks to
chemotherapy.


<P>She refused conventional medicine's &quot;therapies&quot; for her breast cancer (which she calls the
&quot;cut, slash, and burn&quot;approach) and took the route of alternative medicine instead. Today,
her woman's body intact, she is back on the job as a prominent orthopedic trauma surgeon.
More importantly for the rest of us, she is out there in the public telling people how to
overcome cancer using alternative medicine.


<P>In this inspiring video, Dr. Day gives it to us straight. As a true physician ought to, she
lucidly lays out the politics of  the cancer industry that keep most people from learning
about the alternatives. Cancer therapy in the U.S., Day states, is a total monopoly of toxic
therapies, a theater of lies and propaganda. How absurd to poison your already weakened
immune system with chemotherapy in an attempt to get better, she notes. Are alternative
medicine approaches &quot;unproven?&quot; Unproven really means you can't patent them and they are
nontoxic.


<P>Listening to Dr. Day lay it all out on the table is sobering and refreshing, like an hour
spent with a counselor who knows her business, states her facts calmly but with a cutting
wit, and has no tolerance for the incompetencies of conventional medicine. She discusses a
series of holistic approaches for cancer and healthy living, such as nutrition, organic
foods, live juices, coffee enemas, bowel cleanouts, ozone therapy, shark cartilage, green
barley essence, and others. Take charge of your own health  and do it today, says Dr.
Day-and, we would add, follow her good example.
