Christine has been diving for 6 years, during which time she has gained experience in many different diving environments including The Arctic, The Amazon, Caribbean, Europe and North east coast of the USA..  Certified as a Tehcnical Nitrox, Technical wreck and Cave diver she is also a PADI  Divemaster.  Very much and outdoors person she enjoys many sports beside diving including climbing, running and mountain biking.  She has traveled in over 30 countries.
<P>Involved In the years of research and set up that preceded the existence of Mad Dog, Christine's Multi lingual background proved invaluable when encountering the inevitable bureaucracy and pitfalls associated with diving in remote locations.  Before starting this venture she studied languages and English literature and worked with high profile New York companies in managerial marketing and public relation appointments.  This business and globe trotting back ground proved to be an ideal schooling for her present position as company Vice President and head of marketing finance and public relations. <BR>
