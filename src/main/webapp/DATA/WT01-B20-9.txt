<CENTER><B>Industrial Hemp Planted On American Indian Soil</B></CENTER>

<P><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><B>March 17, 1996, Navajo Nation, Arizona:</B>&nbsp;  A scheduled 
planting of industrial hemp seeds by the Coalition for Hemp Awareness (CHA) took place on test plots of American Indian soil.&nbsp;  The initial planting came about following a resolution passed unanimously by the Navajo Nation to allow for hemp cultivation to occur on sovereign soil.
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Following meetings with both the Vice President and the Director of Agriculture of the Navajo Nation, CHA spokesman Christie Bohling told <B>NORML</B> that support for the hemp cultivation project is "overwhelming beyond our wildest dreams."&nbsp;  Bohling notes that adverse weather and a lack of seeds limited CHA's spring planting to a small "ceremonial celebration," but adds that a widescale planting is scheduled for the end of April.
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The Navajo Hemp Project began in 1992 when activists Jim Robinson and Tom and Carolyn McCormick moved to the reservation for the purpose of introducing hemp cultivation on sovereign soil.&nbsp;  Currently, well over 30,000 acres of Navajo nation land has been allocated for hemp cultivation.&nbsp;  In addition, CHA states that the organization is close to securing approval for similar cultivation projects from ten other tribes located across the United States.&nbsp;  This will enable CHA the opportunity to grow hemp in a variety of "different [climates and] environments," Bohling explains.
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The Coalition for Hemp Awareness was founded in 1991 to incite the rapid return of cannabis hemp as an agricultural crop.&nbsp;  CHA is a political advocacy network group that assimilates and disseminates hemp information to both politicians and the public.

<CENTER><B>DC NORML, Virginia Activists Thwart Prohibitionist Movement In 
Virginia</B></CENTER>

<P><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><B>March 19, 1996, Crewe, VA:</B>&nbsp;  A dazzling array of tough new anti-drug proposals failed to pass the Virginia General Assembly 
this week.&nbsp;  The measures were opposed by a drug-law reform coalition that included members of DC NORML, Virginians Against Drug Violence, and Virginia's Cannabis Action Network.&nbsp;  The measures would have increased marijuana penalties, permitted drug testing of high-school students, and given courts the broad authority to continue cases despite improper procedures or incomplete lab results.
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">"This year we had a real show of force," said activist Lennice Werth of Virginians Against Drug Violence.&nbsp;  "[We had] lots of anti-prohibitionists showing up at the state house to voice their dissatisfaction with this kind of legislation."
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Among bills defeated outright were measures to include marijuana seeds and stems as evidence to increase marijuana penalties (SB34, SB58, HB96, HB169); allow courts to continue cases that have been dismissed due to improper procedures (HB646, SB53); add a $1,000 additional fine for possession or distribution charges to go to local authorities (HB1002), and 
permit the drug testing of high school students (HB949, HB950, HB579).
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">A measure that was not killed, but amended, was legislation that would have greatly expanded the use of military for drug law enforcement, particularly for searching private property.&nbsp;  Werth notes that the amended bill limits use of the military to aerial surveillance only and called the revision "a substantial victory" for the drug reform movement.
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Some measures that passed the General Assembly despite the efforts of drug-law reformers include legislation to legalize double jeopardy (SB435, SJR73) and deny bail to drug offenders (HB504).&nbsp;  Altogether, reformers monitored a total of 48 bills.

<CENTER><B>Court TV To Televise Medical Marijuana Trial</B></CENTER>

<P><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><B>March 1996, New York, NY:</B>&nbsp;  The national cable television 
station <B><I>Court TV</I></B> will be televising the trial of Johann Moore.  
Moore is the coordinator of the New York City Medical Buyers Club, a small organization that supplies marijuana as a therapeutic agent to seriously ill patients who possess a doctor's recommendation.&nbsp;  He was arrested this past August and charged with one count of felony sales.
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Moore's televised case will present testimony from a number of expert witnesses on the medicinal value of marijuana such as Harvard Medical School Professor and international authority on medical marijuana, <B>NORML</B> board member Dr. Lester Grinspoon, CUNY Medical School Professor and <B>NORML</B> board member Dr. John Morgan, and Dr. Tod Mikuriya.&nbsp;  This will be the first ever televised trail regarding medical marijuana.&nbsp;  The trial is expected to begin in early April.
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><I>For more information on the case of Johann Moore, please contact Cures Not Wars @ (212) 677-4899.&nbsp;  For more information on Cannabis Buyers Clubs, please contact Allen St. Pierre of <B>NORML</B> @ (202) 483-5500.</I>

<CENTER><B>Update: Charges Dismissed Against North Carolina Medical 
Marijuana User</B></CENTER>

<P><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><B>March 15, 1996, Sunny View, NC:</B>&nbsp;  All charges have been 
dismissed against Jean Marlowe, a medical marijuana user and vocal activist who was facing various drug charges including possession with intent to manufacture a controlled substance after law enforcement agents raided her home and discovered 50 marijuana seedlings.
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Marlowe, who is clinically disabled and admits to using marijuana at least three times a day to obtain therapeutic relief from three orthopedic conditions she suffers, told <B>NORML</B> that she successfully utilized the medical necessity defense.&nbsp;  However, she adds that her fight is still far from over.
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">"I [intend] to file suit against both the state and federal government for medical access to marijuana," she said.&nbsp;  "Nobody should have to perform a criminal act to obtain a safe, natural medicine."
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><I>For more information, please contact Jean Marlowe of the Marijuana Relegalization Movement @ (704) 625-2958.</I>

<CENTER><B>Medical Marijuana User, Quadriplegic Found Guilty Of Trafficking 
Charges</B></CENTER>

<P><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><B>March 15, 1996, Oregon, Ohio:</B>&nbsp;  Daniel Asbury, a quadriplegic who grew his own marijuana to alleviate reoccurring pain and 
muscle spasms, was found guilty of trafficking in marijuana over three times the bulk amount and could face a sentence of up to five years in prison.&nbsp;  Asbury's sentencing will occur on April 18.
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The guilty verdict was a setback for marijuana reform advocates who had hoped to set a legal precedent in Ohio for the medical use of marijuana.&nbsp;  John Hartman, President of Northcoast NORML, notes that the organization flew in <B>NORML</B> Board member and CUNY Medical School Professor Dr. John Morgan to testify as an expert witness on the use of marijuana and pain management.&nbsp;  "For whatever reason, the jury [who found Asbury innocent on charges of cultivation] didn't find Daniel's medical necessity case strong enough to nullify [the trafficking charge,]" Hartman notes.
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Hartman adds that Asbury's defense was made more difficult because Ohio currently provides no medical marijuana defense in its body of established state law.&nbsp;  Therefore, Asbury's defense was basically asking the jury to "find the compassion to rule over the law," Hartman said.
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Asbury suffered a broken neck 15 years ago and began to use marijuana as a therapeutic after prescription drugs proved ineffective at controlling his pain.&nbsp;  Marijuana made me "fe[el] like a human being again," he said.
