<h3>Energy Department Kicks Off Projects
to Reduce Vehicle Mileage, Pollution</h3><P>


Denver, Colo., June 18, 1996 &fnof;&fnof; The U.S. Department of Energy today announced a series of pilot projects in the Denver metropolitan area to reduce traffic, improve transportation efficiency and cut air pollution.<P>

	Christine Ervin, DOE assistant secretary for energy efficiency and renewable energy, announced the new Vehicle Miles Travelled (VMT) program at Denver's City and County Building.  Denver Mayor Wellington Webb joined Ervin and officials from Boulder, Jefferson County and the Colorado Office of Energy Conservation in endorsing the program.
<P>
	"In this country alone, more than 123 million vehicles spew out almost 720 million tons of air pollutants every year, and the numbers are rapidly increasing," Ervin said.  "But we can change things if we work together.  New computerized transportation technologies can double the efficiency of existing vehicle fleets--and that means fewer vehicles on the road while improving the quality of life for our citizens."
<P>

	In Jefferson County, senior citizens and the physically challenged will be able to schedule rides on a new "transit on demand" system, which uses global positioning satellites and digital cellular technology to streamline passenger pickups and arrivals.<P>

	In Boulder, an Internet home page will provide citizens with information on transportation alternatives, including public bus routes, light rail, carpooling and bike paths.  The home page will enhance coordination among city departments that provide transportation and related services.<P>

	And in Denver, DOE will support the development of better ways to monitor transportation trends, including the number of people using various modes of transportation, vehicle emissions and preferred fuels.  This information can be used by citizens, city planners and legislators to shape the transportation future of the region.<P>

	"Maintaining Denver's quality of life will be a challenge as we move into the 21st century," Mayor Webb said.  "The partnerships announced here today are part of a regional effort to clean up air and reduce traffic congestion not just one city at a time, but throughout the whole region."<P>

	The National Renewable Energy Laboratory will provide technical assistance for the projects, under the direction of DOE's Denver Regional Support Office.  Both organizations are located in Golden, Colo.
The transit on demand system is an 18&fnof;month demonstration program beginning in early July.  The pilot demonstrations in Boulder and Denver also are scheduled to go online within the next few months.<P>

	"The technologies are available," Ervin said.  "All we need is the will."
