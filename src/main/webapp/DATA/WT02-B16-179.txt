<h2>MEMO OF RECORD
<br>FEDERAL INTERAGENCY ENERGY MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE 
MEETING</h2>
<B>Department of Energy</B><br>
<B>Forrestal Building, Room 7E-069</B><br>
<B>March 20, 1996</B><br>
<B>9:00 a.m. - 10:35 a.m.</B>
</center>
<P>
Mr. Mark Ginsberg, Chairman of the Federal Interagency Energy Management Task 
Force and Director of the Federal Energy Management Program opened the meeting and 
initiated a round of introductions.
<P>
Water Conservation Working Group<P>
Ms. Katherine Mayo (NREL) summarized the activities of the water conservation 
working group and stated that she would continue to oversee the group as she 
transitioned into a new position as Congressional Liaison for NREL.  She noted that the 
working group is involved in ground-breaking initiatives to incorporate water 
conservation into energy savings performance contracts (ESPC).  A <I>Federal 
Register</I> notice will be published that explains the linkage between water 
conservation and energy efficiency projects.  Guidance on the use of ESPC for water 
conservation projects will be included in FEMP's training course and how-to manual on 
ESPC.  Ms. Mayo noted that the working group comprises dedicated individuals 
representing a cross-section of the Federal sector.  She also stated that the Department of 
Defense is making an effort to assure that water management is included in all ESPCs 
developed for their facilities.  A document listing commercial water use estimates is 
available from the water working group and is attached to this memo of record.  Ms. 
Beth Shearer of the General Services Administration advised the group that GSA 
distributed water management software to all of the agencies at the "656" committee 
member level and that Task Force members should track it down and use it.  Ms. Mayo 
added that a computer program called <I>Watergy</I> is now being tested.  This 
program addresses domestic water use, water and energy rates, and estimates the energy 
cost savings associated with water management projects.<P>
<P>
Audit Working Group<P>
Ms. Mayo also reported on the activities of the audit working group.  She explained 
that in the future the SAVEnergy program would be represented by NREL coordinators 
in the east and the west, as well as by DOE regional support offices.  There will continue 
to be an NREL representative at the headquarters level.  FEMP is currently funding 
audits for Federal facilities and looking for co-funding for larger auditing projects.  Mr. 
Ginsberg stated that there are 20 professional firms on-board to do audits and noted that 
interagency agreements are welcome.  Requests for SAVEnergy services should be 
forwarded to the regional SAVEnergy personnel listed below, as they are good 
facilitators for audits.<P>

</blockquote>
Showcase Program<P>
Ms. Patricia Plympton (NREL) provided an overview of the federal energy saver 
showcase program in the absence of Ms. Karen Thomas (NREL).  She gave the Task 
Force a report on the Federal showcase facilities and indicated that the projects were 
moving into the outreach and recognition stage.  Informational plaques that will explain 
the program and provide points of contact are being developed for display in the lobbies 
of showcase participants.  Ms. Plympton also distributed a form which showcase 
managers can use to summarize their facility. Mr. Rich Wickman of NASA asked when 
the plaques would be available and how they would be distributed.  Mr. Ginsberg 
responded that FEMP was still considering presenting the plaques at a future meeting of 
the "656" Committee, possibly as early as May.<P>
<P>
Renewable Working Group (Agencies Response Plan)<P>
Ms. Plympton also spoke on behalf of the renewable working group for Ms. Anne 
Sprunt Crawley (FEMP).  The letters requesting "656" Committee endorsement of the 
renewable working group's Implementation Plan have been mailed.  DOE Assistant 
Secretary Christine Ervin signed the letters to the Committee members.  So far, six 
agencies have signed and returned their letters.  The Implementation Plan is intended to 
give credit to agencies who are already developing and implementing renewable projects 
and to encourage training in this area and the implementation of renewable energy 
retrofits.  The training schedule was put at the handout table for interested Task Force 
members.
<P>
The renewable working group will next meet on Thursday, March 28, 9 am to 12 noon, 
at the DOE Forrestal Building in Room 7E-069.  The focus will be on showcasing 
renewable projects and will feature presentations by the Department of Agriculture, the 
Environmental Protection Agency, and Department of the Interior.  Ms. Plympton noted 
that there was great interest expressed in Federal renewable projects at the recent Solar 
Energy Technology Conference (SOLTECH), as agency representatives gave 
presentations about their projects.
<P>
Ms. Plympton also announced that the first ESPC for a Federal renewable energy project 
was recently signed.  The contract is for the installation of a solar water heating system at 
a Federal Correctional Institute in Phoenix, Arizona.  The system is designed to heat 
water at a cost that is 15 percent less per unit than traditional water heating systems and 
the contractor will also provide all operation and maintenance tasks.
<P>
Ms. Plympton asked Task Force members to contact her if they would like to obtain 
copies of guidance on ESPC for renewables, which is currently in draft form and should 
be available soon.  Mr. Ginsberg added that the American Solar Energy Society meeting 
will take place in Asheville, North Carolina April 15-19 and will include a discussion of 
Federal initiatives.  Patricia Plympton has additional information on this conference and 
she can be reached at 202-651-7540.
<P>
Mr. Carlos Campos from NASA said his agency is working with NREL on renewable 
projects.  Ms. Plympton added that the Sandia National Lab provides a PV Assistance 
Service and they are doing great work with their renew the parks, renew the forests, and 
renew the BLM programs.  These are inventory programs to identify renewable 
projects.

<P>
Mr. Ginsberg briefly discussed FEMP's use of indefinite quantity contracts for energy 
savings performance contracting services.  FEMP published an announcement in the 
<I>Commerce Business Daily (CBD)</I> on February 21 on the western region 
indefinite delivery indefinite quantity (IDIQ) draft solicitation for energy savings 
performance contracts (ESPC) for all Federally owned buildings in the states of Alaska, 
Arizona, California, Hawaii, Idaho, Oregon, Nevada, and Washington.  The Government 
anticipates multiple awards to result from this one solicitation.  Through delivery orders 
executed under the IDIQ, fixed-price contract, performance-based energy savings 
services will be available to Federal agencies with Government-owned facilities within 
the western region.  The concept is that an IDIQ will be issued in a region stating that 
there are 3 or 4 facilities within that region that would like to implement projects.  That 
indefinite quantity contract can then be expanded to add other projects at the original 3 or 
4 facilities, or to add other facilities simply by issuing a delivery order under that IDIQ.  
The IDIQ's can have agency wide, technology specific, or regional application.  Attached 
with this memorandum of record is a copy of the CBD notice.
<P>
Mr. Ginsberg discussed the recent establishment of a Solar Enterprise Zone, a nonprofit 
organization in Nevada, comprising representatives from the Department of Energy, the 
state of Nevada, Senator Bryan, and members from the private sector.  These groups 
have joined together to promote the sale of solar-generated electricity through the 
Corporation for Solar Technologies and Renewable Resources (CSTRR).  The 
solicitation has gone out and includes four technologies.  Mr. Ginsberg handed out copies 
of the minutes from the February 29, 1996 meeting of CSTRR. (See Attached) He noted 
that one of the technologies, a thin film photovoltaic from Amoco/ENRON, had 
previously been advertised as providing electricity produced by photovoltaics at 5.5 cents 
per kWh as opposed to 25 cents per kWh (with 3% escalation a year) that will be on-line 
in 3 to 5 years.  CSTRR's role is to assist in the development of a marketplace for the 
electricity.  One advantage of the close proximity of the Nevada Test Site to Hoover 
Dam is a large concentration of transmission lines serving a wide area including 
California and Arizona.  Mr. Ginsberg stated that he was encouraged about the possibility 
of having Federal agencies use this power source.  Mr. Rick Klimkos added that it is a 
concept that has been widely accepted by the Secretary of Energy and throughout the 
Federal government and FEMP would like Task Force members to help identify others 
who would support this project.
<P>
Mr. Kevin DeGroat of DynCorp discussed the four technologies proposed for use in the 
solar enterprise zone.  They are:  thin film photovoltaics; concentrator photovoltaics; 
energy mixed with photovoltaics, and solar thermal dish Stirling technology.  (See 
attached)  He stated that CSTRR has received proposals and is evaluating them to 
identify business plans that will be competitive.  Mr. DeGroat suggested that more details 
will be provided to Task Force members as they become available and added that the 
Western Area Power Administration is planning to issue a Federal Register notice in 
April to target customers for this power.  Mr. Ginsberg noted that there are already many 
Federal facilities that are served by WAPA, thus providing an immediate customer base.  
Ms. Plympton noted that some technologies are already in place, such as the Cummings 
Solar Thermal Dish.  Mr. Ginsberg responded that the possibility exists for decentralized 
application of these technologies.

<P><U>FEMPTracks Database</U>
Ms. Katie Kroehle (FEMP) updated Task Force members on the status of the 
FEMPTracks Database project.  FEMP continues to add records to the facilities part of 
the database in an effort to get a full listing which can be used to target good 
opportunities for projects.  She stated that all facilities of more than 25,000 square feet 
have been entered into the database, but added that the records are based on 1993 data 
provided by the General Services Administration.  Thus far, information for 3,600 
facilities has been entered.  She advised Task Force members that she has a report form 
for each agency and its subagencies listing the facility ID (main phone number), facility 
name, address, total number of buildings, and number of square feet, as well as space for 
data on the energy manager and phone number.  These records are sorted within the 
agency by square foot size.  A form should be completed for each site or group of 
buildings.  Ms. Kroehle requested members to review these reports to verify the data, 
make corrections and additions, and to fill in the blanks.  She offered to accept data in 
other existing formats, as well, which can then be entered into the FEMPTracks database.  
This information can be provided to FEMP either in hard copy or electronically.  
<B>(Enclosed, for individual agencies, is the existing information we have in the 
FEMPTracks database.  Following the guidance in the enclosed transmittal letter 
from Katie, please review your agency&iacute;s data as listed and return to Katie any 
corrections you have in the envelope enclosed.)</B>
<P>
Mr. Ginsberg reinforced that there may be data anomalies from the 1993 data due to 
events such as site closures or agency transfers.  For example, Presidio may show up as 
an Army facility.  Mr. Walter Aughenbaugh of the USDA asked how FEMP handled 
multiple-tenant buildings and Ms. Kroehle responded that those buildings were assigned 
to the largest tenant.  The question was also raised as to whether leased facilities are 
included in the database.  Ms. Shearer (GSA) indicated that only owned facilities should 
be included in the database as leased facilities change occupancy too frequently.
<P>
<U>Budget Issues (Budget Status, Budget Briefing Materials, Survey Results)</U><P>
Mr. Ginsberg then began a discussion of the current budget environment and related 
issues.  He noted that some agencies are still without a fiscal year 1996 budget, but that 
President Clinton has sent forth his proposed budget for FY 1997.  Mr. Ginsberg 
expressed hope that the FY 1997 budget will be not only embraced, but cheered by 
Congress.  The FY 1996 budget contained $18 million for core FEMP programs which is 
significantly less that the $24 million requested.  The Administration's proposed FY 1997 
budget includes $31 million for core FEMP programs.  Mr. Ginsberg suggested that this 
increase in funding would allow expansions in the programs and more opportunity for 
Federal/state partnerships.  He also expressed hope for greater initiatives in renewable 
energy.  He added that the budget for the In-house Energy Management Program, which 
was reduced to zero in FY 1996, has been restored to $5.7 million in the proposed FY 
1997 budget.
<P>
At the last Task Force meeting, Mr. Ginsberg had asked the Task Force to study the 
implications of Section 625 of Public Law 104-52, the Treasury, Postal Service, and 
General Government Appropriations Act of 1996 and identify issues of concern.  The 
legislation permits each Federal agency, except DoD, to retain 50 percent of:
<P>
<blockquote>
    <br>the amount of each utility rebate received by an agency for the implementation of 
energy and water conservation measures, and
    <br>the amount of the agency&iacute;s share of measured energy savings resulting from 
ESPCs.
</blockquote>
<P>
The retained amounts will be credited to the agency&iacute;s accounts that fund energy and 
water conservation measures.  The remaining 50 percent will be transferred to the 
General Fund of the Treasury at the end of the fiscal year in which it was received.
<P>
Seventeen of the 18 agencies queried responded to the request and Mr. Klimkos handed 
out a document summarizing the responses and briefly highlighted some of the general 
issues.  (See Attachment)  Among the action items that may come from this survey is the 
formation of a working group to meet with the Office of Management and Budget to 
facilitate the development of the Federal Energy Cost Accounting and Management 
guidance required by EPACT.  Mr. Klimkos suggested another area to be further 
examined is the issue of transferring savings to the Treasury which is problematic in that 
many agencies reported "no mechanism" to perform such a transfer.  Mr. Klimkos will 
contact Task Force members to address these issues.
<P>
Mr. Ginsberg distributed a number of budget briefing materials that respond to the 
request of Task Force members for material to defend their energy management budgets 
in these changing times.  The material is intended to serve as ammunition for internal 
budget discussions.  Items in the package include talking points/factoids, funding or 
staffing guidance, and published articles.  Amongst the articles is an October issue of the 
<I>Economist</I> and an April issue of <I>Atlantic Monthly</I>.
<P>
Mr. Ginsberg turned the floor over to the Task Force to learn about the status of other 
agency budgets.  DoD requested $238 million for FY 1996 and received $33 million 
(proposed $15 million for FY 1997).  Ms. Shearer (GSA) noted that they asked for $45 
million.  They received $20 million and much of that was taken away to fund security 
enhancements such energy efficient lighting.  For FY 1997, GSA is requesting $50 
million, but they have been given no indication of how much they will actually 
receive.
<P>
<U>Other Items (EPA Programs, GSA Building Fund, Procurement Project)</U><P>
Mr. Ginsberg said FEMP is still considering how Federal agencies can best participate in 
the Environmental Protection Agency's <I>Green Lights</I> program, but that the 
approach has not yet been agreed upon.  He added that the Task Force may want to 
reconvene its small group to work on this issue and that interested individuals should 
contact Rick Klimkos.
<P>
Mr. Ginsberg provided an update on the Product Procurement Program managed by Mr. 
Jeff Harris (LBNL) who was unable to attend the meeting.  He noted an initiative to 
establish a state collaborative that was presented at a meeting earlier in the month.  Mr. 
Ginsberg thanked agency representatives for participating in that candid discussion and 
distributed thank-you notes to several attendees.  By-laws were created and are in 
circulation for comment.  Notices will be published in the <I>Federal Register</I> and 
the <I>Commerce Business Daily</I> to announce a public meeting to seek comments 
on the process of using energy efficient products.  It is anticipated that this will be done 
in late May with a 30 day comment period.
<P>
<U>Outreach and Awards (Energy Awards, Success Stories/CD ROM, Customer 
Successes)</U>

<P>Mr. Ginsberg confirmed that the 1996 Criteria and Guidelines for the Federal 
Energy and Water Management Awards has been distributed and requested that 
nominations come into FEMP early and often.  FEMP is trying to identify a group of 
individuals to screen the nominations before they are evaluated by an interagency group.  
The Awards ceremony will be held on November 14th at the National Press Club.  A 
separate room has been arranged at the Press Club for registration to simplify entry.  <P>
<P>
A question was raised by Mr. Richard Wickman (NASA) concerning the handling of a 
nomination submitted last year under the renewables category.  As it turns out, no awards 
were made in that category.  NASA submitted the only nomination in that category and 
felt that it was a strong candidate.  Mr. Ginsberg called on Ms. LaVanna Ortiz (ASI) to 
clarify this situation.  Ms. Ortiz responded that a decision was made last year by the 
evaluators to fold the renewables into the energy efficiency category, but that the 
renewable category is included in the 1996 Criteria and Guidelines and that nominations 
in that category will be evaluated separately and will not compete with nominations in 
the Energy Efficiency category for 1996 Awards.
<P>
Ms. Tatiana Strainic Muessel (FEMP) opened discussion on FEMP's Awareness 
Campaign.  She noted that the Energy Efficiency Awareness Tool Kit is ready for 
distribution and passed out copies to the Task Force members for their preview.  The 
Tool Kit is intended to provide the in-house energy manager with a menu of energy 
efficiency awareness activities to implement as needed and which can be tied to holidays 
or special events.  The ideas are backed by case studies, factoids, and fact sheets. 
<P>
Another tool in the kit is an electronic on-line message program that provides log-on and 
log-off reminders of energy efficiency measures.  It is designed to change habits and 
raise awareness.  Ms. Muessel noted that this is now being tested by FEMP as a pilot 
project at DOE.  The computer program has been created in standard software formats 
and includes messages that are action oriented and humorous.  Once the pilot program 
has been completed, FEMP hopes to make them available to all agencies for use 
throughout the Federal sector.  Ms. Muessel reminded Task Force members to contact 
her for extra buttons and posters and noted that graphics in the Tool Kit are available in 
camera-ready format that may be easily duplicated.
<P>
Ms. Muessel announced the date for TeleFEMP III as May 15, 1996 from 2:00 p.m. to 
4:00 p.m. eastern standard time.  This teleconference will be produced in conjunction 
with the National Association of Energy Services Companies (NAESCO) annual 
meeting.  NAESCO and DOE will serve as the uplink sites and the topic will be energy 
savings performance contracts and utility savings.  The title for TeleFEMP III is Saving 
Billions from Federal Energy Management.
<P>
Ms. Muessel will hold an Awareness Working Group meeting at DOE on April 3 from 
2:00 to 4:00 p.m.  The topic will be development of a 5-year outreach and 
communication plan with activities to coincide with the 1998 World Energy Congress.  
She encourages voluntary participation in this meeting with a goal of raising awareness 
and increasing outreach.
<P>
Mr. Ginsberg recommended the book "Lean and Clean Management" written by Joe 
Romm of DOE that discusses the productivity side of energy efficiency.  He also 
described the new CD-Rom software that provides visual summaries of five success 
stories.  FEMP is producing 1,000 copies of the CD-Rom for distribution.  Mr. Ginsberg 
noted that these five stories are just the beginning and appealed to the Task Force to 
submit other examples.  He also noted that Mr. Jerry Dion of FEMP will be reviewing 
agency case studies that were done a couple of years ago and contacting agencies to 
refresh and revamp that information, which has been most useful in providing data for 
him and others as they testify before Congressional committees.
<P>
<U>Public Comment</U><P>
Mr. Ginsberg opened the floor to public comment.  Ms. Maggie Carson of the 
Department of Labor asked Ms. Shearer of GSA about the status of the chiller 
replacement program in light of rumors that Congress has pulled back funding for the 
program.  Ms. Shearer responded that funding has been cut, but that because agencies are 
legally required to replace CFC chillers, GSA will have to rethink their strategy for 
carrying out this task.  She suggested that agencies may want to work with the regional 
offices, as they may be developing plans for chiller replacement.
<P>
Mr. John Moresko said the Federal Energy Saver Showcase list mistakenly listed the 
Frances Perkins Headquarters Building under the Department of the Interior.  Ms. Carson 
responded that the facility should be listed under the Department of Labor and Ms. 
Plympton concurred that it would be corrected and noted that some projects may not be 
in the report yet as they are still in the pipeline to be added.
<P>
Mr. Klimkos thanked the 17 agencies that have submitted their annual report data and 
stated that one other agency has submitted partial data and 10 agency reports are 
delinquent.  He encouraged those agencies to get their data in quickly and asked Task 
Force members to let him know when they would provide the data.
<P>
Mr. Ginsberg stated that he is working with the Secretary of Energy and Christine Ervin's 
office to coordinate the next "656" Committee meeting.  They are currently considering a 
date in May.  Typically, the Task Force meets a few weeks ahead of that.  He asked the 
Task Force members to consider volunteering their hospitality and space for the next 
meeting.  <B>(The "656" Meeting is now scheduled for May 15th from 9:00AM 
until Noon.  The location is still to be determined.  As a result, the Task Force 
meeting is scheduled for May 2nd.  Time and location for the meeting are still 
TBD.)</B>
<P>
Ms. Shearer (GSA) gave a sales pitch on the TEEM '96 conference set for September.  
GSA has invited Secretary O'Leary and Vice President Gore, and is working on an 
invitation for President Clinton.  She also distributed postcards for registering for TEEM 
'96.
<P>
There being no further business, the meeting was adjourned at 10:35 a.m.<P>
