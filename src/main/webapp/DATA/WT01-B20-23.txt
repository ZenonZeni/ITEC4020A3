<p align="center"><b>Missouri Senator Pre-files Medical Marijuana
Necessity Defense Bill</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>December 14, 1995, Jefferson City, MO:</b>&nbsp;
State Senator John Moseley has pre-filed a bill (Senate Bill 573)
for the 1996 session of the Missouri General Assembly that would
provide certain marijuana users with a medical necessity
defense.&nbsp; Sen. Moseley is the former President of the
Missouri Association of Prosecuting Attorneys. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The bill states that &quot;no criminal or civil penalty shall
apply to any person for the act of possessing marijuana provided
that ... a [physician] certifies in writing that the person is
under professional care ... [and] ... needs marijuana as part of
a therapeutic regimen.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Attorney Dan Viets, President of Missiouri NORML, views Moseley's
bill as a step in right direction and does not forsee significant
political opposition.&nbsp; &quot;Given the fact our legislature overwhelmingly
supported a resolution to end the federal prohibition of
marijuana as a medicine in 1994, we feel that Moseley's bill has
an excellent chance of passing in the Missouri General Assembly,&quot;
he said. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;It is appalling that in some states, juries are forbidden
to hear testimony regarding the medical uses of marijuana,&quot;
says <b>NORML</b> Deputy Director Allen St. Pierre.&nbsp;
&quot;It is even more appalling that individuals who consume
marijuana for its therapeutic effects are prosecuted under our
nation's policy of 'zero tolerance.'&nbsp; Senator Moseley's
legislation would allow for some needed compassion in America's
war on marijuana consumers.&quot; <br>

<p align="center"><b>Anti-Drug Group's Attack On </b><a
href="http://www.ecolution.com/hempi.html"><b>Hempilation</b></a><b>,
WBCN, Draws Fire From National Writers Union, Boston Coalition
For Freedom Of Expression</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>December 13, 1995, Boston, MA:</b>&nbsp; In
response to a December 1 rally held outside the offices of Boston
radio station WBCN to protest the airplay of the <b>NORML</b>
benefit CD <a href="http://www.ecolution.com/hempi.html">Hempilation</a>,
the National Writers Union and the Boston Coalition for Freedom
of Expression have issued statements condemning the actions of
rally organizers, the Governor's Alliance Against Drugs. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Both groups are highly critical of the overall nature of the
protest and specifically of the alleged use of state power and
finances to help institute the rally.&nbsp; Reports from the
December 1 gathering note that protesters arrived in state
vehicles, attendees were encouraged to &quot;bring their squad cars,&quot;
and an individual identified as a Boston liaison to the DEA
accompanied Georgette Wilson, Executive Director of the G.A.A.D.,
as she entered the station.&nbsp; &quot;These sort of actions,
when performed [and sponsored] by government agents, are
specifically [prohibited] by law,&quot; charges Bill Downing,
president of <b>NORML</b>'s Massachusetts chapter. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In a letter to Governor William Weld from the National Writers
Union, Political Issues Chairman Robert B. Chatelle urges the
governor to demand Ms. Watson issue a formal apology for her
actions.&nbsp; The letter further urges Watson to &quot;pledge in
the future to abide by the laws [and] the U.S.
Constitution.&quot;&nbsp; If the executive director is unwilling
to do this, the National Writers Union suggests that Gov. Weld
request her resignation. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;We are concerned ... that you have not yet spoken out
against this abuse of power committed in your name,&quot;
Chatelle writes.&nbsp; &quot;The voters of the Commonwealth have
the right to hear from you about this disturbing event.&nbsp; I'm
sure you have no wish to advance your political career by trampling
on the inalienable rights of the people.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">A press release issued by the Boston Coalition for Freedom of
Expression also criticizes the event and calls the protest an
&quot;astonishing example of the power of the state riding
roughshod over the Bill of Rights.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;The news blackout on this matter, which should at the very
least result in the resignation of Ms. Watson and the
disciplining of the DEA agent who accompanied her into WBCN, is
almost as scandalous as the incident itself,&quot; concludes
James D'Entremont, Director of the Boston coalition. <br>

<p align="center"><b>State Supreme Court Rules Warrentless
Searches Of Bus Passengers To Be Illegal</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>December 7, 1995, Chicago, IL:</b>&nbsp; Civil
liberties proponents are claiming victory following an Illinois
Supreme Court decision to uphold a Champaign County Judge's
ruling that the police acted illegally by searching the bag of a
Greyhound Bus passenger. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Judge Harold Jensen granted a motion to suppress in the case of
Greyhound passenger Tim Besser.&nbsp; Besser was faced with drug
charges after a police search of bus passengers and their luggage
revealed Besser's suitcase to contain marijuana.&nbsp; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">At the hearing, officers testified that they boarded the bus as
it pulled into the Urbana Station at 2:50 a.m.&nbsp; One officer
and his dog searched the luggage compartment and two other
officers questioned the bus passengers, ordering each to identify
their luggage.&nbsp; During the course of the trial, police
conceded that there was nothing suspicious about the bus or any
of its passengers.&nbsp; One officer further testified that he
knew the bus schedule by heart and added that such suspicionless
searches of busses were routine police procedure. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Consequently, by boarding the bus and detaining the passengers
without probable cause, the court ruled that Besser had been
unlawfully seized and searched.&nbsp; &quot;That kind of random
police work is a little offensive to me,&quot; Judge Jensen
remarked. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Besser was represented by <b>NORML</b> Legal Committee member,
Peter J. Vilkelis. <br>

<p align="center"><b>NORML Chapter Is Approved At Columbia
University: Marijuana Reform Organization Achieves Ivy League
Foothold</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>December 5, 1995, New York, NY:</b>&nbsp; The
Student Governing Board (SGB) of Columbia University's Earl Hall
Center approved the constitution of CUNORML, the Columbia
University Chapter of the National Organization for the Reform of
Marijuana Laws.&nbsp; Earl Hall's approval of the group makes
Columbia the first Ivy League campus to recognize a <b>NORML</b>
chapter. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">CUNORML was founded as an unofficial student organization in the
Spring semester of 1995 by Wayne Jebian and Aaron Wilson, a
graduate student at Columbia University Teacher's College.&nbsp;
Prior to enrolling at Columbia, Wilson helped to found the <a

Coalition</a> (CRC) at the University of Massachusetts at

<p align="center"><b>NORML Chapter Seeking To Reduce Local Pot
Penalties Faces Opposition, Resolution From City Officials</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>December 1995, Traverse City, MI:</b>&nbsp; A <b>NORML</b>
chapter hoping to reduce marijuana penalties in Traverse City was
recently met with heavy opposition by local officials.&nbsp;
Following the announcement that the group plans to collect the
330 signatures necessary to put a new pot ordinance on the
ballot, city commission officials unanimously passed a resolution
asking residents not to sign the petition.&nbsp; The Traverse
City NORML petition sends the wrong message to teenagers,
Commissioner Shelly Kester said. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Regardless of the resolution, area NORML President Bill Bustance
says he will have no problem gathering the necessary number of
signatures to bring the new marijuana ordinance to a public
vote.&nbsp; Last year, Bustance reportedly amassed more than
twice the needed amount of signatures on a similar
petition.&nbsp; However, the prior petition was rejected by the
commission because it allegedly conflicted with state law. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Bustance says that his current petition avoids last years legal
problems.&nbsp; His revised ordinance would make marijuana
possession in Traverse City punishable by a fine of $100 and 10
hours of community service for the first offense. <br>

City NORML @ (616) 667-2507.</i></p>

<p align="center"><b>Supreme Court Reverses Drug Convictions
Involving Firearms: Justices Rule Possessing A Weapon Not Enough
To Warrant Longer Sentences</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>December 7, 1995, Washington, D.C.:</b>&nbsp;
In a unanimous decision that may open the door for the appeals of
hundreds of firearm convictions, the Supreme Court unanimously
ruled that a federal law mandating drug traffickers to receive an
additional five years in prison for using a firearm can only be
invoked when the defendant actively employs the weapon. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The decision struck down the convictions in two District cases in
which firearms were present but locked away during drug
dealing.&nbsp; In one incident, police discovered a pistol inside
a bag in a car trunk following a traffic stop that revealed 27
bags of cocaine.&nbsp; In the second case, an unloaded derringer
was discovered locked in a trunk of the defendant's bedroom
closet.&nbsp; The defendant had earlier sold crack cocaine to an
undercover officer in her apartment. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Prior to the Court's ruling, many circuits courts had been
divided on how much &quot;use&quot; of a firearm is necessary to
invoke the additional mandatory minimum.&nbsp; A prior D.C.
Circuit of Appeals ruling stated that as long as the weapon is in
close proximity to the drugs or drug proceeds and is accessible,
the stiffer punishment could apply. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">However, after reviewing the law's language, the Supreme court
concluded that prosecutors must show active employment of the
firearm.&nbsp; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The definition of &quot;use&quot; said Supreme Court Justice
Sandra Day O'Connor &quot;is of such breadth that no role remains
for 'carry,&quot; which is also included in the statute.&nbsp;
&quot;Use&quot; does not include the mere placement of a gun
nearby for protection, she concluded.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Drug Czar Leaves Post</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>December 12, 1995, Washington D.C.:</b>&nbsp;
President Clinton accepted &quot;with regret&quot; the resignation
of Dr. Lee Brown as head of the White House Office of National
Drug Control Policy.&nbsp; A spokesman for the administration
says that a search for a successor is underway and maintained that
the President is as committed as ever to the battle against drug
abuse.&nbsp; &quot;[The war on drugs] will never be over until
every child in America knows that drug use is dangerous, illegal
and wrong,&quot; the President said. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Brown is leaving his post as Drug Czar to take a teaching job at
Rice University in Houston.</p>

<p align="center"><b>(Meanwhile) Gallup Poll Indicates That
Americans Are Very Concerned About Illegal Drug Use</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>December 12, 1995, Miami, FL:</b>&nbsp;
Americans rate the use of illegal drugs as one of the nation's
greatest crises, second only to violent crime, indicates a Gallup
poll released this past Tuesday. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">According to results from the 1995 poll, 88 percent of the
nation's adults view illegal drugs as a serious problem --
ranking it ahead of such issues as the federal budget deficit and
health care costs.&nbsp; The survey also indicated that 93
percent of respondents favored more anti-drug education in public
schools and 85 percent opposed the idea of legalizing drugs. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">White House Drug Czar Lee Brown, speaking at a conference in
Miami, commented that the results of the poll further
re-emphasize the need for a high-profile, well-funded national
drug control strategy.</p>
