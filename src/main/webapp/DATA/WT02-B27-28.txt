<I><B><FONT SIZE=5>The Story</FONT></B></I>

<HR NOSHADE>

Tommy T-Cell is a biodetective. His job is to patrol the human body

investigating suspicious characters. Think of the cells in your body

as shops on a city street. Billions and trillions of police detectives

like Tommy T-Cell are driving by all the time looking in all the shop

windows for something unusual going on. Each T-Cell is trained to find

one and only one type of criminal. Tommy is also known as a Helper

T-Cell, part of the body's immune system, but you can think of him as

a cop.

<P>

As Tommy cruises through blood and tissue he meets a macrophage--a

specialized cell that's like a garbage truck in the body. Macrophages

go around collecting bits of your own living and dead cells. They find

parts of invading viruses and bacteria, dust, pollen and any junk

that's floating around. They stick pieces of this garbage on their

outside surfaces in special places where detectives like Tommy can see

them. Tommy has unique Y-shaped spikes all over his surface called

receptor sites that recognize one kind of garbage. (In 1983 Tak Mak

discovered these T-Cell receptors.) Tommy's got about 5000 of them and

each one is exactly the same. No other T-Cell has spikes like Tommy's.

His are specially designed to fit a tiny bit of protein from a virus

that causes colds. Tommy tries his receptors on the macrophage, but

nothing happens, so he moves on. The whole thing takes less than a

second.

<P>

As Tommy floats along he remembers his days years ago at the body's

Police Academy, the Thymus, where he learned how to tell foreign

invaders from good cells that belong to the body. Your thymus is a

fist sized gland located just above your heart. It is bigger and more

active when you are a baby. That's when it gives all the T-Cell

detectives in your body their life-long assignments. T-Cells start out

in the thymus as police cadets. They get trained by special

macrophages that show new T-cells every possible little bit of garbage

that your normal healthy body produces. These bits of you are called

"self". T-Cells whose receptors recognize self are killed in the

thymus before they can leave. If they ever got out they would become

bad cops that attack good cells instead of invaders.

<P>

Tommy finally cruises up to a macrophage that shows him a piece of a

cold virus. He checks it with his receptors. It's a match. Right away

Tommy leaps into action. The virus has only been in the body for 5

minutes. First Tommy sends out chemicals that signal regular police

officers in the body--B cells--to make antibodies. Antibodies are like

heat-seeking missiles that zero in on a particular virus and kill it.

Tommy also calls in a SWAT team of killer T-Cells and together they go

out in search of the invader. They also start dividing rapidly;

doubling in number about every 6 hours. It takes 4 days before

millions of T-Cells, B-Cells and Killer T-Cells are mobilized to kill

all the virus in the body. They are some of the fastest dividing cells

in the body.

<P>

One day Tommy is cruising the body on his usual rounds when he meets a

thug in a black leather jacket, an AIDS virus. He decides to check him

out with his receptors, but before he can do anything, the little

creep gets right inside Tommy through a tiny hole near the handle that

Tommy uses when he visits macrophages. Viruses don't usually attack

T-Cells but AIDS does. That's what makes AIDS so bad. Now that Tommy

has the AIDS virus, little bits of AIDS proteins will appear on his

surface. This makes Tommy look very bad to other cells in the immune

system. Tommy sees a Killer T-Cell coming and says his prayers. This

guy is trained to kill anything that looks foreign. The Killer T-Cell

sees that bit of AIDS on Tommy and without a second thought he kills

his boss. That's the end of Tommy. 

<P>

The tragedy of AIDS is that T-Cells are the mastermind detectives of

the body's defence system, the ones who organize the other cops. Once

AIDS is inside a T-Cell they look like spies to the rest of the immune

system. So the body kills off its best cops which then makes it harder

to fight AIDS and any other infection. Most people with AIDS actually

die of a common bug that would never kill someone with a healthy

immune system.

<P>

<B>History</B><P>

As a twelve year old in Hong Kong, Mak came from an upper middle class

family in a predominantly white district. Mak is playing marbles in

the dirt outside their family villa. He is surrounded by Dutch and

British boys. He is the only oriental. Mak's dad is a successful 

business man in Hong Kong and they live next door to the Consulates 

from Norway and Denmark.

<P>

Tak liked to kick soccer balls and play. He wasn't particularly good

at school but his mother insisted that he do well and study hard. He

got by partly because he was in a very bright group of about 20 kids.

Most of them went to universities all over the world. Mak went to the

University of Wisconsin, then received a PhD from the University of

Alberta. In the early 70s Tak Mak began his research at the Ontario

Cancer Institute in Toronto where he is today. In 1983 he discovered

the T-Cell receptor and since then has become a university professor

at the U of Toronto and is also the Director of the Amgen Research

Institute in Toronto.

<I><B><FONT SIZE=5>The Science</FONT></B></I>

<HR NOSHADE>

Tak Mak is an immunologist and a molecular biologist. He examines the

structure and function of molecules and cells in the human immune system,

the way your body protects you from dirt and disease. His research

is also leading to cures of many auto-immune diseases where the

body's immune systems malfunctions. Diseases like diabetes, multiple 

sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, myesthenia gravis, and others.

<P>

Ever since Tak Mak discovered the genes for the T-Cell receptor he has

been using this knowledge to create "knock-out" mice. These are mice

with missing DNA instructions for making just one protein in the

immune system. 

<P>

To Mak, the immune system is like a huge corporation that's so big and

complicated you can't tell how it functions. But there is a systematic

way you can find out. One day you take "John Smith" out of the

building and see what stops functioning. Maybe it's the mailroom. Now

you know what John Smith does. Then you put John Smith back and you

try the same thing with another person. Eventually you find out how

the whole company works. Mak, along with many other researchers around

the world, is using a similar process to understand how the immune

system works.

<P> 

The human immune system is very complicated and the following is just a

very simple explanation of one major part.

<BR>

<IMG SRC=http://fas.sfu.ca/I/css/gcs/graphics/mak_science.gif>

<BR>

1. Macrophages are like garbage collectors. They get bits of molecules

from invaders and present them to T-Cells for identification.

<P>

2. Helper T-Cells are the "masterminds" of the immune system. They use

their receptors to identify invaders and send signals to B-Cells and

Killer T-Cells to start the attack. Each T-Cell receptor recognizes one

short piece of a protein molecule about 8 amino acids long. There are

trillions of unique T-Cells in your body. Enough so that you can

recognize any foreign molecule that nature throws at you.

<P>

3. Killer T-Cells are better at killing viruses. They can recognize 

a virus and then release a toxin that kills it and any others in 

the vicinity.

<P>

4. B-Cells are particularly good at destroying bacteria. They make

antibodies which glom onto bacteria and make them easy to kill.

B-Cells can also trigger Mast cells which act as a kind of long

term memory for the immune system so a defence can be mounted faster

the next time.

One of the greatest mysteries of the human immune system is how our

100,000 genes can contain enough instructions to create not only us, but 

also several trillion different

T-Cells? In just the last ten years researchers have discovered the clever

way it works. 

<P>

Try to calculate the number of possible different T-cell

receptors that your body's immune system can make from just the few hundred

protein chains encoded in your immune system DNA. 

<P>

You need a calculator and these facts:<BR>

T-cell receptors consist of two protein chains called alpha and beta.

These are chains of amino acids. All proteins are made of these.

Each chain has a bottom part that is constant like the trunk of a

tree. The tops of the chains are divided into three major sections

called Variable, Diversity, and Joining. Your DNA has the genetic code

to make 109 different protein segments for the variable portion of the

Alpha chain. Similarly the alpha chain can have 61 different Joining

segments. (The alpha chain has no Diversity segment.)

It has only one constant trunk segment, so to calculate the number of 

possible different alpha chains just multiply 109 x 61 x 1 = 6649

<P>

Here is a table to help you:

</TABLE>

<P>
Now try to calculate the total possible number of T-Cell receptors
that your immune system can make. (Hint: multiply everything together.)
How big is your number? Is it in the millions, billions, or trillions?
<P>
Now add this fact. A special enzyme randomly puts a few
extra amino acids between the Variable and Diversity chains. These
are chosen randomly from our 21 amino acids, so you need to
multiply again by 21 three or four times for each chain.
Now how many possibilities are there?

<P>

<BR CLEAR=ALL>

<HR NOSHADE>
<FONT SIZE="+2"><I><TD><B>Mystery</I></B></FONT>
<HR NOSHADE>
Mak believes that in the future scientists will use the immune system
to clean out residual cancer cells after tumors are removed surgically
or killed with chemotherapy. He also believes that much better
vaccines can be developed; vaccines for malaria and other diseases
that are currently difficult to control. He also thinks that a cure
will be found for juvenile diabetes. But for Mak the biggest unsolved
mystery of all is the way the immune system distinguishes between
foreign invaders and "self". He says the thymus is only half the story
because many new antigens (or foreign molecules) attack our bodies
long after the thymus has finished the bulk of its work training
T-Cells.
