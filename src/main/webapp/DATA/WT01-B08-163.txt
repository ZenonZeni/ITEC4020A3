Dear Whitney Farms-- I am looking for very low maintenance flowers to plant around the house. The flower beds are only about 2 ft. by 8 ft.
 Direct sunlight is about 35 - 40%. I prefer large flowers but any info you can give
 will be much appreciated.</P></B>

<P>"The question was: very low maintenance, beds 2' by 8', 35-40%
light, prefer large flowers.</P>

<P>Lots of missing information; without a description of what's surrounding
the beds, hard to know how big plants can really be - if at all
possible, the gardener should consider widening beds.</P>

<P>Don't know which % of light - is this all day dappled?
Hot all afternoon? Some morning, some afternoon? I assume less than all
day sun, but 35% direct. All these plants should handle that.</P>

<P>As for large, a large look is going to come with the combinations, as
opposed to what any individual plant will give. Peonies are the biggest
flowers & foliage, but don't bloom for long. Nice leaves & fall color,
though.</P>

<P>Peonies are nearly no work - just a cage when the new growth is starting
to come up, and cut away the old before the new gets tangled in it.
(Leaving old foliage is helpful to protecting crowns in harsh winters.)
They can handle less than all day sun, get floppier but still bloom in
part shade. A definite recommend.</P>

<P>Roses do indeed come hardy enough for the area, and for length of bloom,
one might not be too much work. In such a small area, best to send one
up! A trellis over a bed, arching w/real shade plants like bleeding
hearts & ferns beneath will give months of color for a few minutes of
pruning & feeding in spring. (I assume the garden will get at least some
water.)</P>

<P>The Canadians have been doing lots of work w/roses(etc), and the
Explorer series is very hardy. There are some old roses hardy enough for
an old fashioned look - Konigin von Danemark is very fragrant, pure pink
w/quartered blooms, blooms in summer; Stanwell Perpetual is a delicate
white double, flushed w/pink, & very fragrant.</P>

<P>Therese Bugnet is dusky pink, tall, extremely hardy, blooms late spring
with light repeat bloom until frost. William Baffin is a newer rose, a
tall pillar, and neon pink for a stronger look.</P>

<P>Spiraeas are very popular in the midwest because of their sturdiness -
later blooming varieties like Spiraea japonica 'Little Princess', or the
strongly colored foliage varieties like Spiraea bumalda 'Goldmound'
(both abt 24"-30" tall) would be very simple to prune - just a light
springtime shearing to neaten them up is all that's needed. (Earlier
blooming ones should receive a thinning type pruning -usually thought to
be "difficult") (It doesn't hurt to cut out old wood on the later ones,
either.) They don't fit the criteria for larger flowers - but the colored
foliage ones will be very helpful in combination for a "large" look,
esp. if the gardener uses some of the colored Berberis thunbergii, like
'Crimson Pygmy' or 'Aurea'. Golden foliage is positively gorgeous in
part shade, glowing chartreuse. Crimson Pygmy will be most red in areas
w/at least some strong light.</P>

<P>Weigelas, like spireas, are frequently used midwestern plants. They
bloom for weeks, come in dwarf varieties (Minuet, Red Prince) attract
hummingbirds, and require nothing in Portland, as long as the rain hits
them periodically. They do best w/occasional (once every few yrs)
pruning of old wood. Unfortunately, dwarf weigelas are truly stumpy, and
really ought to be combined with something -columbines, daylilies,
anything.</P>

<P>Very hardy deciduous azaleas - the Lights series - fragrant, truly
sturdy.  Train up! by removing lower branches as they become
established, and underplant with woodland goodies, or a quiet, serene,
green groundcover. (They will not stay 2'wide.)</P>

<P>Potentillas are like spiraeas & weigelas - the midwestern rhodie. Very
very easy -shear when shaggy. Some have blooms to 2"across, and they
bloom all summer in waves, like the roses they're related to. (So are
Spiraeas.) They will need 35% of direct, not dappled sun, and happy to
get more.</P>

<P>I definitely recommend at least some space being given to daylilies,
iris, asters, forget-me-nots, and annuals, including calendulas. The
forget-me-nots are easier to clean than to type their name - when done
blooming, pull them out. They will leave seeds behind, as long as you're
not too quick, and the new young plants will germinate and take care of
themselves. Iris should be sheared when foliage is crummy. Hmmm. Some
fertilizer....(Bob, I think she is implying that this is the commercial
part of the answer...)</P>

<P>These plants will make a very simple garden, but one that I think could
look very nice. It'll all look better if the gardener can give the
plants a backing of green - yew? holly? Both would suit the situation,
can be sheared, & have dwarf forms, if the room can be found."</P>

Dear Whitney Farms-- I recently moved to N. Al. from Fl.  I *Love* to grow roses.  I used a
dilute garlic spray on the roses and a banana compost
in Florida,...it doesn't seem to be working as well up here in Al.
Any advice on organic pest control and fert. in this area??</P></B>

<P>Here are some general thoughts vis a vis rose care in your area (also be
sure to check out the second issue of our newsletter <A HREF=dirt.htm">'The Dirt'</A>.  It is
available on line at our website and talks about planting roses)</P>

<P>Roses generally prefer a cool, moist, slightly acid soil. I would check
the pH of your soil first.  If it is in the 6's don't worry about it.
If it is above pH 7 or below pH 6, then adjust it accordingly with lime
to raise the pH or sulfur to lower it.</P>

<P>Make a practice of adding lots of high quality compost to the rose
garden.  Well rotted cow or steer manure is a great choice.  If your
soil is acidic, aged mushroom compost is excellent for roses as it both
helps to sweeten the soil and it adds valuable potash to the soil.  If
you make your own compost, by all means apply that.  Work it into the
soil around the plants taking care not to damage the roots.</P>

<P>Your roses will also benefit from a good mulching.  Any of the materials
above would be ideal for use as a mulch around the plants.  Apply the
mulch early in the season before the sun gets hot and warms the soil.
This will help to keep the soil cooler as well as preserving moisture.
Use about 2 inches of mulch around the plant, but keep it away from
direct contact with the crown of the plant.  I like to leave a small
area free of mulch right around the base of the plant itself.  In
addition to providing the cool soil temperatures in which roses grow
best, mulches will also help to control weeds.  At the end of the year
it can be worked into the soil--if the earthworms in your yard haven't
already moved it under ground for you.</P>

<P>Be sure to keep them well watered.  As you probably know from your days
in Florida, roses are a thirsty lot and like a regular supply of water.
 I like to stick my finger down into the ground as far as I can. If the
soil is not cool and moist a couple of inches down, the plants would
probably benefit from a good soaking.  I prefer to use a soaker hose, if
practical, for watering roses.  The hoses that weep--brands like
Moisture Master--are ideal because they will gradually soak the root
zone over a couple of hours without getting the foliage wet.  Remember,
if the mulch dries out you will have to give some extra water to ensure
that the soil down deep gets good and wet.  That's a nice benefit of
using the soaker hoses--you can bury them under the mulch.</P>

<P>As to suggestions for organic fertilizers, I can tell you that Alfalfa
Meal comes highly recommended for roses.  Rich in natural growth
stimulants it has been reported to give "greener leaves and stronger
stems" within a week or two of application.  Also, Greensand has been
used by a number of rose enthusiasts in our area and has gotten rave
reviews from them.  It supplies valuable potassium as well as trace
minerals.</P>

<P>I recently heard the assistant horticultural director of the National
Arboretum in Washington DC recommend using a foliar spray of liquid fish
and sea weed.  She said they have been using it a the garden and are
amazed by the results!  Some of the healthiest roses she has ever seen!
A recent article in the New York times reported that the National
Arboretum is also feeding the roses aged chicken manure (make sure it is
really well aged and use it sparingly as it can burn).</P>

<P>Be sure to feed them some Bone Meal or Rock Phosphate a couple of times
a year as well.  Most blooming plant will benefit from the extra
phosphorous they provide.  Another great fertilizer to use on roses is
Sul-Po-Mag.  Use it instead of Epsom salts.  It provides all the sulfur
and magnesium one would get from the Epsom salts but in a longer lasting
form, and it provides potassium!</P>

<P>For pest control, I am intrigued by a new product form a company called
Greenlight.  They have just introduced a product called Rose Defense.
Derived from a naturally occurring insecticide called Neem, it not only
controls insects but is also labeled for powdery mildew and black spot!!
To my knowledge Neem is approved for use to control pest organically on
ornamental plants and I believe will soon receive EPA approval for
vegetables.  It might be one to try especially if you are plagued with
Japanese Beetles.</P>

<P>Below is an answer I wrote to another visitor to our web site about
controlling aphids on her roses:</P>

<P>"I have great news for you!  Aphids are one of the easiest pests to
control organically!  In fact, the biggest challenge to controling
aphids organically is the patience required to allow nature to assert
its own controls over these pesky little plant pests.</P>

<P>First a couple of things about aphids that are really cool!  Did you
know that aphids bear live young?  Yep, the females can actually clone
themselves--hence the incredibly quick pace with which they appear in
your garden and infest your roses.  They are also what some have called
the "cows" of the insect world, as they excrete a sweet liquid commonly
called honeydew.  This is actually harvested by ants as a food source.
In fact, the ants will often help to get the aphids evenly distributed
on your roses so they can get the most out of them!  Finally, when the
population reaches a particular density, individuals with wings begin to
appear so that they can migrate to your neighbors garden!  (I love this
stuff--insects never cease to amaze me with all the ways they have
adapted to the world they live in!)</P>

<P>The good news is that you do not have to get the toxics out to get the
aphids under control.  As a great article in the latest (May/June) issue
of Organic Gardening (highly recommended to recent converts to the
organic gardening fold) notes, the first step to getting these guys
under control is to get the ants under control.  Strategies suggested in
the article include ringing your plants with coffee grounds (which worms
love by the way) to repel the ants--never heard of this before, but I am
going to try it this spring--and if you find the nests, dousing them
with boiling water poured over the nest very slowly so it has a chance
to seep in--this I have tried and can attest to its effectiveness.</P>

<P>Now the hard part.  The aphid population will take off once they arrive
in your garden, as you probably have noticed.  Provided you have
controlled the ants--who defend their insect nectaries
ferociously--mother natures' natural aphid predators will move in and
make a quick meal of the aphids.</P>

<P>If you'd like, you can give your roses a blast with a good sharp stream
of water.  Obviously not a technique to use when they are blooming, it
is however very effective.  Aphids are not the most mobile creatures,
and once knocked to the ground, will not find their way back to the
tender new tips of your roses.  In fact, I would imagine that in the hot
summer days of Phoenix they will whither and die quite quickly.  The
water will also be appreciated by the roses, and the increased humidity
can help to prevent mites.  I would suggest giving your roses their bath
in the morning, so the foliage can dry off as the day warms up.  Please,
exercise caution--don't get so carried away with the desire to rid your
plants of the aphids that you blast them into oblivion.  Use just enough
pressure to knock the little aphids off the plants and to the ground.
Also, don't get carried away trying to get every last aphid.  The idea
is to get the population in check while you wait for the reinforcements.</P>

<P>If you are patient, and resist the impulse to SPRAY pesticides, you will
get to witness one of the great dramas of nature--predation.  All kinds
of insects eat aphids--ladybugs, green lacewings, hover flies, and
others--and some wasps actually lay their eggs in the aphids creating
little aphid mummys.  (Take a look with your hand lens or magnifying
glass, and you will see little brown aphid domes with tiny little holes
in them where the wasp crawled out of the aphid.)</P>

<P>Unfortunately, all too often folks get the malathion out and give the
aphids a good spraying not realizing that at the same time, they are
killing all the natural predators of the aphids.  This often leads to
much worse infestations because the natural check on the aphids has been
wiped out!</P>

<P>You can even introduce your own beneficials.  Lady bugs are OK, but the
real killers are green lacewings.  These suckers eat aphids like sushi!
A couple of green lacewings will wipe out 100s of aphids in a short
time.  And all you have to do is sit back and watch.</P>

<P>If mother nature is slow to respond, you can intervene with some fairly
safe products.  Look for Safer's Insecticidal Soap.  Unlike the liquid
ivory under the kitchen sink, this is a product derived from natural
fatty acids that has been formulated to control insect pests on plants
and tested extensively on a wide range of plants.  It is virtually non
toxic to us--watch the eyes, follow the label, etc.  A couple of points
about getting the most out of it.  1)  It only kills on contact while it
is wet.  So be sure to apply it early in the morning so that it can stay
wet as long as possible. 2)  Its effectiveness can be reduced by hard
water, so you might have to adjust for that.  But it works--if you use
it correctly!!</P>

<P>A last resort if things get really out of hand would be the family of
"botanical" insectides used by organic gardeners pyrethrum, rotenone or
sabadilla.  Seriously though, you shouldn't need to use these.  I find
that if I am just patient, the birds and insect predators clean the
aphids off my roses (in Stumptown/aka the City of Roses/aka Portland,
OR).  Typically, I see the aphids have arrived; tell myself to be
patient; finally decide its time to get the soap out and blast the
suckers; get up early in the morning; mix the spray solution, and head
out to do battle only to find that there is not an aphid in sight!  Upon
close examination, I find the culprit--the overstuffed lady bug larva
resting in the morning sun.  EGAD!!  Stop me before I spray again!</P>

<P>Hope I gave you some inspiration to resist the temptation to get the
chemical nasties out!  DON'T DO IT!  But I would check your local
newsstand for the latest issue of Organic Gardening!  You can read up on
the pests and their predators, and rest a little easier knowing that you
have mother nature in your corner.  She is one heck of an ally!!"</P>

Dear Whitney Farms-- How do you take care of Ranunculus once it is done blooming? How do you ensure that it will come back year after year?</P></B>

<P>Ranunculus will naturalize in our climate in the northwest; they just
won't survive our winters in the ground.  You can save your tubers from
year to year and propagate them by dividing them--that way the colors
remain true.</P>

<P>After the blooms fade keep the plants well fed (I prefer our Whitney
Farms Bulb Food--it tends to last longer than most of the other products
and is less likely to be washed away by our wet weather here in the PNW)
and watered and allow them to mature naturally.  Sometime in mid to late
summer you will see the foliage begin to whither or 'ripen.'  At that
point, lift them carefully, cut off the tops, clean them gently and
store in a cool dry place until next spring.  Plant after any danger of
frost has passed in rich well drained soil.</P>

<P>The reason to let them 'ripen' is to ensure that you give the tuber
plenty of time to grow and store nutrients before it goes dormant.</P>

Dear Whitney Farms-- When the flowers on violas shrivel up should I pluck them off? What should I use that is around my house to kill the bugs that eat
my coelus? </P></B>

<P>It certainly would not hurt the violas to remove the spent blooms.
"Deadheading" as it is known is a great way to keep annuals and other
flowering plants blooming longer (as the plant sets seed, it usually
stops or greatly reduces flower production to favor seed production).</P>

<P>As to the pests on your coleus, I would look for the least toxic
alternatives.  If the pests are mealybugs, for example, a safari with an
alcohol dipped q-tip works really well, and is satisfying in a bestial
sort of way...In the arena of sprays, it is hard to make a
recommendation without knowing what the specific pest is, but my
personal choice would be to start with the least toxic alternatives the
insecticidal soaps. Safer's is the most common brand in the market.  Be
sure to check that coleus is listed on the label.  Next would be the
pyrethrum based insect sprays for houseplants.  From there your into the
real strong stuff...</P>
<BR>
<P><B>Dear Whitney Farms-- I have gorgeous wysterias growing in my yard
 but they never bloom.  I have tried pruning
 strategies, etc. but nothing seems to work.
Any suggestions?</P></B>

<P>I recently heard a piece on NPR's Talk of The Nation where the President
of the American Horticultural Society described an elderly neighbor who
had waited decades to celebrate the first bloom of her wisteria--which
grew to cover an enormous area before finally pausing to flower...</P>

<P>I don't think the future is as bleak as this story might make it seem.
You didn't indicate how old the Wisteria vines were.  It is not unheard
of for young plants to take 4 or 5 years to bloom.  Sometimes patience
is all that it takes...</P>

<P>On the other hand there are a few things you can do to "encourage" the
vines to bloom:</P>

<P>1)  Don't feed the vines.  At the very least, don't give them any
fertilizers with high levels of nitrogen.  In fact it is often
recommended to with hold nitrogen for entire seasons in order to
induce blooming.  Nitrogen encourages the green growth in plants and I
don't think you want any more of that...If you would like you could try
feeding with more of a "bloom" formula.  The classic synthetic version
would be an 0-10-10, or something like Peter's Root & Bloom (5-50-17).
From the world of organic fertilizers a blend of rock phosphate and
greensand would approximate a 0-10-10 type product, though quite a bit
more long term.  I think this is OK in your case though.</P>

<P>2)  Being stingy with the water can help too.  Don't kill the plant--a
little well managed stress is what we're talking about here.  Don't
water it as often as you might.  If you have regular summer rains I might not
give any extra water at all.  Again, don't kill the plant, just stress
it.</P>

<P>3)  Another trick you can try is root pruning.  I remember an article in
 Horticulture years ago that even talked about exposing roots and
beating on them with a hammer...That might be a bit extreme.  A less
dramatic technique is to go around the plant with a spade an cut
vertically into the plants root zone.  Don't get carried away and too
close to the crown--you could potentially kill the plant.  Look at the
plant, determine where the drip line is (the limit of the leaves) and
work around the interior of the plant within the drip line.  Again, the
concept is stress; it often will induce a plant to bloom.  Wait until
you are sure that the plant will not bloom for the year.</P>

<P>So those would be my suggestions.  I would start with numbers one and
two this year.  If you still have no blooms next year, try number three.</P>
<BR>
<P><B>Dear Whitney Farms -- 
I enjoyed your article very much..
 I have a question for you, my next door neighbor, who is 90 + in age saw
 me planting gladiolas and lilies. She bugged me till I had to put in
 the hole 2 tablespoon Bone Meal, 1 tablespoon of Cow manure and 4
 tablespoon of Peat Moss mix well for each bulb. Have you heard of this
 formula for bulb planting? Would love to hear your opinion on this
 subject..</P></B>

<P>Sounds like a great recipe for success!!  The only thing I would do
differently is to prepare the entire area using your neighbors
formula--and a bit more steer manure--rather than just the tiny little
holes!  Might as well give those roots some room (and reason) to grow!</P>
<BR>
<P><B>San Francisco<BR>
Dear Whitney Farms --  I would like to know what organic methods I could use to combat rust, mildew and earwigs in my rose garden.</P></B>

<P>Controlling the problems you asked about begins with good culture for
the roses.  Be sure that you have a rich, slightly acid soil with lots
of good compost in it.  Mushroom Compost (provided it is well aged) is
particularly well suited to roses and one of the secrets of some of the
beautiful rose gardens in England.  Roses also like a cool moist soil to
grow in.  If you haven't already, I would encourage you to mulch your
roses with a good compost (like mushroom or your own) or a product like
our Garden Mulch.  Mulching now will help keep the soil cooler and
moist, as well as suppressing weeds under the roses.  Also give your
roses a good feeding from time to time.  Given that this is a commercial
web site, I am confident you will not be surprised to hear me recommend
some of our products.  We make a high performance all natural organic
Rose & Flower Food which provides your roses with an excellent source of
long lasting fertilizers. </P>

<P>I also would encourage you to think about feeding your roses some
Alfalfa Meal (it's an ingredient of our rose food).  In the January 1993
issue of the American Rose Society magazine it was recommended with
"stronger stems and greener leaves" visible within a week of
application.  Also, one sales rep. for a large rose nursery tried
Greensand on his roses last year and reported amazing results to us.  He
is now convinced that it is a miracle product for use on roses.  Results
were comparable to alfalfa and yet he felt that it did better than the
alfalfa. </P>

<P>Finally, last week on National Public Radio's May 1 Talk of the Nation I
heard the assistant director of the National Botanic Garden recommend
and rave about the benefits of using a liquid fish and kelp spray on the
roses in the NBG.  (See our Ellie's Ultimate Plant Food)  One of the
points she made was that they had a lower incidence of disease and
insect problems in the garden as a result of regular applications of a
fish and kelp product.  I have seen a large body of evidence showing
that foliar applications of seaweed sprays do help prevent diseases. </P>

<P>So that's step one.  Be sure your roses have all the good things they
need and like to thrive. (Check our last issue of The Dirt for some more
tips on growing roses.) </P>

<P>Timely pruning is helpful as well.  Be sure to remove any dead, damaged
or diseased wood, and prune to open up the bush.  Mildew in particular
can be suppressed if air circulation is increased. </P>

<P>Good sanitation is inherent to controlling both rust and mildew.  Clean
up any affected leaves and remove them from the garden.  Destroy them,
do not compost them.  Also, using dormant sprays in the winter can help
to kill any fungal spores that might be overwintering on the plant.  You
can use a lime sulfur product when the plant is dormant at the
recommended rate.  If you apply an oil spray at the same time (the label
for the lime sulfur should have instructions for combination sprays) it
will also help to kill overwintering insects or their eggs which might
be on the plant. </P>

<P>I would also encourage you to be careful when you water.  Avoid
splashing soil onto the leaves as this can transmit fungal spores to the
plant.  Similarly, it is advisable to water early in the day so that the
plant can dry off long before the evening.  The new soaker hoses that
slowly weep water down their length are ideal for getting water to the
roses without getting them wet. </P>

<P>Now living in the Bay Area, as you do, you live in a climate conducive
to these two fungi.  Powdery mildew is favored by warm days, cool nights
and low light intensities.  Rust likes continual moisture and is a
particular problem where dew lasts for several hours--like foggy SF. </P>

<P>If after practicing the cultural controls above you are still faced with
the problem, do not despair.  You still have organic techniques to use
to get the problem in check. </P>

<P>Powdery Mildew has been effecively prevented (Jackson & Perkins has even
tried it and been successful with it) using a mixture of baking soda and
horticultural oil (like the one used in the dormant spray).  A great
deal of University research has been done supporting this in the last
few years. The formula is to use 3 teaspoons of baking soda and 2 1/2
tablespoons of oil (I like a brand called Sunspray) in a gallon of
water.  Some sources recommend adding a 1/2 teaspoon of insecticidal
soap as a spreader sticker to the mix.  Spray the roses thoroughly
ensuring contact with both the top and the bottom of the leaf.  Work at
Cornell showed that both diseases were "subdued" by a weekly spraying of
the solution.  I spoke to the horticultural director of Jackson Perkins
a couple of years back and he spoke highly of the solution when used
preventatively.  He was less enthusiastic about its curative properties.
Some of the dormant sprays (lime sulfur) out there also have summer
rates on them for use in season.  You could also try one of these as
well. </P>

<P>One tip:  I like to be sure the plant has plenty of moisture before
spraying.  Water it well a day or two prior to application.  That way
you can help to reduce the chance of burning with the spray. </P>

<P>So that should help with the mildew.  Now the rust.  It responds well to
treatments with sulfur based fungicides.  You can look for Safer's
Garden Fungicide or mix your own using a wettable powder.  Follow the
directions on the label and again be sure you get a thorough coverage.
You can also dust with sulfur, but I think spraying helps get better
coverage. </P>

<P>There is also a new product out this year called "Rose Defense" by the
Greenlight Company.  It is a 90% solution of neem oil which is derived
from the seed of the Neem tree.  Neem has been long recognized for its
insecticidal properties (it acts as an insect growth regulator), and now
has been found to control--are you ready--both powdery mildew and rust
on roses--even blackspot!!  It is brand new, so I have little experience
with it yet.  But I do have a bottle and intend to try it should I have
any problems this year.  I spoke with one of the sales people for the
company and asked about the other 10%--he assured me it is only a
preservative which helps to keep the product stable and effective.  They
have another formulation approved for use on vegetables so I am fairly
confident that it would be OK to use.  I do not know, however, how
organizations like California Certified Organic Farmers feel about it.
Given the alternatives (Funginex, etc.) I feel comfortable recommending
Rose Defense for you to try first.  Always use according to the
directions on the label. </P>

<P>Finally, under the disease prevention heading, I have seen results from
research in Israel using antitranspirants (AntiStress 2000 [best] and
Wiltpruf are common brands) to prevent mildew and even mites.  In fact,
I successfully used them a few years ago to prevent mildew on roses in a
retail nursery in Santa Cruz.  Essentially they coat the leaf with a
compound that prevents the spores from contacting the leaf surface.
The research results were outstanding.  Very effective.  The drawback?
You have to apply them regularly to keep any new growth protected. </P>

<P>So that leaves the earwigs.  Trap 'em.  They like to hide in cool dark
places during the heat of the day.  Give them a place to hide like a
piece of bamboo, an inverted clay pot, or a loosely rolled newspaper.
Check the traps each morning and dump the insects into a bucket of soapy
water.  I have also heard of using tuna cans with a 1/2" of vegetable
oil in them to attract and drown the earwigs.  Generally, earwigs are
beneficial scavengers that eat decaying fruit or plant litter and pose
little problem to the garden.  Sometimes they do get out of control and
due to population competition eat plants.  Trapping is usually
sufficient to get them back under control.  If you are still seeing
damage, I would take a late night walk in the garden.  With a flashlight
inspect the plants.  Sometimes other critters are at work and earwigs get
the rap. </P>

<P>Finally, there are varieties of roses more resistant to diseases than
others.  I remember a talk I went to in San Jose a few years back.  It
was sponsored by the California Association of Nurserymen (sic) and
featured a local rose expert.  She was asked what she recommended for
controlling powdery mildew.  Her response took most of the audience by
surprise, "A good sharp spade..."  Her point was that there are hundreds
of varieties of roses, many of which are far better suited to a given
area and more disease resistant than others.  Her suggestion was to find
the right rose for your area, and not to make the mistake of trying to
make an ill suited variety adapt to your conditions.  So, I will leave
you with that thought.</P>

<P><B>Dear Whitney Farms -- What is the best mixture for potting containers that are going to be very crowded with annuals for a good all summer display?  Potting soil
plus what?  Zone 7</P></B>
<P> Well, now I do have to admit a bias.  If you live in the Western United
States the answer is simple...Whitney Farms Premium Potting Soil for
your clay or wood planters and Whitney Farms Uncle Malcolm's Potting
Soil for your plastic pots and hanging baskets.  It is our website,
after all...</P>

<P>Seriously though, you should be able to find a quality mix in your area.
Unfortunately, I can't tell which part of Zone 7 you're in, else I might
be able to suggest a brand to look for.  In most parts of the United
States you should be able to find potting mixes made by quality
producers using quality ingredients.  You will not often find this at
the big chain stores.  Quite often (though not always) those products
are of very inferior quality, and prove disappointing to the customers
who use them.</P>

<P>Look for a potting soil that is made with Peat Moss, a compost of some
kind or earthworm castings, and other ingredients including pumice,
and/or vermiculite, and/or perlite, as well as some kind of fertilizer.
It is hard to explain over the Internet, but take a look at the mix if
you can, it should look, smell and feel good.  Look for a nice balance
between large and small particles, does it feel rich or does it look
like a bag of wood by-products--not a good sign.  Ask yourself, if I was
a plant would I want to call this stuff home?</P>

<P>If you can find a good bagged mix, use it.  It is a bit more difficult
to mix your own soil, though it can be done.  The point is, if you have
a reputable bagged soil producer, then they have done the work for you,
and since the future of their business depends on the quality of the
product they will hopefully give you the best mix they can.</P>

<P>If you elect to mix your own, I would think about using peat moss,
compost, if you have it, and something to facilitate drainage.  In our
area we use pumice and composted bark fines for that.  Other components
could include sand, perlite, and vermiculite.  Exact formulas are hard
to offer without knowing what will go into the mix.  You can see that by
the time you locate, gather, and mix the ingredients, it makes sense to
by a pre-formulated mix from a quality producer.</P>

<P>That should be all you need for a soil mix.  I would not think that you
would need to supplement a quality mix--I would not encourage anyone to
add anything to our mixes for example; they are ready to use as is.</P>

<P>Be sure to fill your containers from top to bottom with the soil mix.
The old tale about a layer of gravel or shards of pottery in a pot, is
ill advised as it interferes with the drainage and can actually cause
more problems than it might solve.  If you are concerned about loosing
some soil out the drain hole, it is not really that big a deal, but a
small piece of window screen or a single shard of pottery to cover the
hole is all you need.</P>

<P>Beyond that, be sure to give them regular feedings.  I generally use a
quality organic fertilizer, like our Rose & Flower Food, to supplement
what is in our blend, and then feed regularly through the season with a
water soluble fertilizer--I use our Ellie's Ultimate and our Flower and
Fruit Booster in a tea--but you could use any good soluble fertilizer.
Just use it more often at a lower concentration.  (A lot of national
brands call for one tablespoon per gallon of water every two weeks.  I
would use half a tablespoon per gallon every week.)</P>

<P><B>Dear Whitney Farms -- I need to know whether it will be harmful
to my azaleas to feed them before they bloom
this spring, or should I wait until after they
bloom?</P></B>

<P>I would generally feed just after blooming in most instances.  Feeding
earlier would usually not cause any harm with a few exceptions, as noted below.</P>

<P>The Sunset Western Garden Book recommends feeding once growth begins in the
spring, again at bloom time or right after, and monthly until August.  I
would generally agree with their directions with a couple of qualifications.
I adapt my recommendations based upon a couple of factors.  1)  What is the
condition of the plant?  Is it yellow and showing obvious signs of
nutritional deficiencies? Feeding will help to ensure that you have a
healthy plant capable of blooming well and more importantly setting buds for
next years bloom.  2)  What kind of fertilizer are you using?  If your
fertilizer has high amounts of soluble nitrogen (for example fertilizers
like Miracle Gro which are designed to be dissolved in water or if they
contain large amounts of nitrogen sources like sulfate of ammonia, ammonium
phosphate, or nitrate sources of nitrogen) it may be advisable to delay
application until after blooming.  A sudden flush of nitrogen in the plant
system could upset blooming.  This has been the belief of many for years,
and the traditional recommendation has been to feed immediately after
blooming.  Also, if you are using a synthetic fertilizer with nutrient
sources like those above, remember that they are salt based.  Azaleas and
their cousins, rhododendrons, are typically shallow rooters that grow close
to the surface, so be sure to spread the fertilizer out to avoid burning and
damaging the roots near the surface.</P>

<P>On the other hand, if you are using an organic fertilizer like our Whitney
Farms Azalea, Camellia, and Rhododendron Food or cottonseed meal, than you
can safely use the products according to the directions without fear of
burning.  At the same time, because of their slow release nature, these could
be applied in early spring, after danger of frost, and when you see signs of
new growth on your plants.  Because they release their nutrients gradually,
they will not cause a too rapid feeding, and will help the plant maintain
color and growth throughout the year.  Remember, azaleas are evergreens, and
as such they have a fairly continual demand for nutrients.  In fact, I have
recently seen articles recommending a more "year round" approach to feeding.
Though I would echo Sunsets comments about August being the final feeding
particularly if you are using synthetic fertilizers.  The concern being that
the soluble nitrogen will cause too tender growth late in the season that
could be subject to frost damage.  With organic fertilizers you do not have
this concern, because as the soil cools down and the plant growth slows, so
will the conversion of the fertilizer to more available forms slow down as
well.  Another benefit of using organic fertilizers is that you will not have
to use them nearly as frequently to get the same benefit as their synthetic
counterparts.</P>

<P>Finally, be sure to mulch your azaleas.  They prefer a rich, moist, acid
soil, and will thrive if you give them a good organic mulch.  If you make
your own compost, you could mix it with a little peat moss (peat is acidic
in nature) or just use your compost as is.  We also make a great mulch
called Garden Mulch.  This is a rich, dark compost-based product that really
helps to highlight the plants while at the same time helping to keep the
soil cool and moist.  If you prefer, Bark Mulch would be a good one to use
as well.  In fact, one of the few times I like to use it is around the
rhodie and azalea family members.  In addition to keeping your soil cool and
moist, a good mulch can also help to suppress weeds, and if it derived from
compost, can help to feed the plants as well.</P>
