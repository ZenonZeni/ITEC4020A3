<b>BUILD ENDURANCE, REDUCE FATIGUE WITH CREATINE</b><p>

For well-trained athletes who want a way to improve short-term endurance and delay fatigue when exercising intensely, studies show that supplementation with creatine can be effective. In addition, according to  nutrition and exercise therapy professor, Anna MacIntosh, Ph.D., N.D., of the National College of Naturopathic Medicine in Beaver-creek, Oregon, creatine can help enhance athletic performance for individuals who already have significantly developed muscle mass. Creatine is less effective for physically untrained individuals, Dr. MacIntosh adds.<p>
Creatine is a natural component of animal and human muscle and is made of several amino acids (protein building blocks). It is found in its highest amounts in red meats, herring, salmon, and tuna, which means a person eating an average mixed protein diet will consume about 1 g daily. Vegetarians, however, often have lower creatine levels, as do patients with rheumatoid arthritis, fibromyalgia (muscle pain), muscle disease, and acute or long-term circulatory and respiratory problems, says Dr. MacIntosh.<p> 
Clinical studies clearly show that supplementing creatine at the level of only a few grams per day can significantly increase the amount of creatine in skeletal muscles, says Dr. MacIntosh, and that such a practice "may be most beneficial for activities which include some short-term, high-intensity exercise bouts."<p> 
For example, when a group of highly active men took 20 g of creatine daily for 6 days, their "power output" on an exercise bicycle was greater and the onset of muscle fatigue from energy loss took longer than before. In another study involving 24 competitive rowers, supplementation with 20 g of creatine for 5 days led to a general improvement in their rowing time, especially during peak demand in the final stretch of the competition.<p>

<b>LOSE WEIGHT AND BUILD LEAN MUSCLE MASS<br>
Sports Supplement from a Chinese Herb Can Do It</b><p>

A new exercise supplement called Endurox™ appears to have the ability to help users both lose weight and build greater muscle tone and lean muscle mass, according to studies conducted in Beijing, China. The Chinese connection comes in with the fact that Endurox™ is based on cuwijia (Acanthopanax senticosus), a root native to northeastern China.<p> 
Traditionally, cuwijia is used in Chinese medicine to  bolster fatigue and enhance immune activity, but Chinese researchers also note that the herb was used by mountain climbers who reported that it boosted their work performance at conditions of high altitude and low oxygen. Laboratory studies found that animals showed the same benefits and that cuwijia increased oxygen supply to the heart.<p> 
Put in practical terms for the estimated 52 million Americans, aged 25-54, who exercise regularly, the pure, standardized extract of the herb, formulated as Endurox™, appears to be able to help people lose or control their weight and gain muscle tone. For most, these are the primary reasons for exercising, says biochemist Robert Portman, Ph.D., of Pacific Health Laboratories, makers of the product.<p>
The central fact that emerges from 2 Chinese studies of Endurox™ conducted at the Institute of Nutrition and Food Hygiene in Beijing is that the herb increases the burning of fat during strenuous exercise. It shifts the energy source that fuels exercise from muscle carbohydrate to fat and it slows down the buildup of lactic acid that always accompanies exercise and leads to muscle burnout and fatigue. The data also suggests that the product can increase exercise endurance and lean body mass (muscle without the fat).<p>
In the first study, physiological changes were monitored in 8 men as they used a stationary bicycle with a performance monitor (ergometer) attached. Prior to the study, the men had received 800 mg of Endurox™ daily for 2 weeks. As the energy load increased during their bicycle workouts, the lactic acid levels actually decreased by up to 33%. At the same time, there was a 43% increase in the burning of fat during exercise, compared to controls.<p> 
In the second study, researchers made aerobic measurements on 10 men, aged 18-23,  while they exercised on a power bike. This study demonstrated a 30% increase in fat metabolism, a significant decrease in heart rate, and a 4.6% gain in oxygen intake per heartbeat. Principal researcher, Wu Yong Ning, Ph.D., states that the product generates "a carbohydrate-sparing action during both low- and high-intensity exercise."<p> 
The reason this factor is important is that since 1939 exercise physiologists have known that they could increase exercise endurance when athletes are on a high-carbohydrate, low-fat diet. Since then, the training programs for many athletes have included some form of dietary carbohydrate loading. Therefore, a supplement that minimizes the burning of carbohydrates during exercise has obvious advantages.<p> 
Robert Kaman, Ph.D., of the Department of Integrative Physiol-ogy at the University of North Texas Health Science Center in Fort Worth, studied Endurox™ in a laboratory setting and concluded that it is "a novel agent that increases workout performance." According to Pacific Health Laboratories, the product's manufacturer, Endurox™ is safe and has no reported side effects. The company also notes that a 30-day supply of the product taken at the dosage level of 800 mg daily costs about $15.<p>

<b>4 STEPS TO BETTER HEART FITNESS<br>
by David Essel</b><p>

Approximately 500,000 people in the United States will die of cardiovascular disease this year, easily making it the leading cause of death in this country. A lesser known fact is that heart disease ranks as the number one killer of women. The reasons for this are varied, but most experts believe the main cause has to do with daily lifestyle choices. The way we deal with stress, the foods we eat, and how we take care of our bodies through exercise—all have a health impact on our cardiovascular system.<p>
	It has been well documented for more than 30 years that exercise can have a dramatic effect on enhancing heart health. Yet, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, only 12-18% of the U.S. population exercise frequently enough to receive these benefits. One of the reasons the other 82-88% don't exercise enough is a belief that they do not have enough time to gain any substantial health benefits from exercise.<p> 
	The fact is, you don't need that much time to benefit. Here are 4 hints for how to approach an exercise program and build cardiovascular fitness into your life.<p>
<b>1.</b> Move at least a little. Set a goal to walk, swim, skate, jump rope, aerobic dance, run or ride a bike 3 times a week for 20 minutes if possible, but even a 10-minute walk is better than nothing. If you are in ill health or over the age of 40, check with your physician first.<p>
<b>2.</b> Exercise can help you control or lose weight. This will likely have a positive effect on your cardiovascular health. Again, the amount of time you exercise is not the most important factor; that you exercise at all is what counts. In a study in the American Journal of Cardiology, physicians showed that there was no significant difference in weight loss between a group who walked nonstop for 30 minutes, 3 times per week, and those who broke a daily walk into 3 sessions of 10 minutes each. Therefore, if you are seriously short of time, set a minimum goal of 3 daily walking sessions of 10 minutes each.<p> 
<b>3.</b> Increasing lean muscle tissue can improve your heart's health. A twice-weekly strength-training program using calisthenics, free weights, or exercise machines in which the major muscle groups of the body (chest, back, legs, etc.) are exercised for 1-3 sets of 8-12 repetitions, can increase lean muscle tissue. This allows the body to burn more calories during the day, thereby assisting in weight loss. 	4. Keep to the program because exercise regularity is important. To stick with any program that enhances cardiovascular fitness, consider the following: Invite a friend to exercise with you one or several days each week. Schedule  your exercise session in your daily planner so it has the same or higher priority as any other meeting for that day. Or use a walkman with your favorite music, book on tape, or motivational audio to inspire (or entertain) you during your workout.<p>
	By following a regular exercise program, you may achieve a reduction in your blood pressure (if it was high), a reduction in triglyceride and LDL cholesterol levels (which can harm the heart), and an increase in HDL cholesterol (the kind that is beneficial to your system).<p>
	A regular exercise program could be one of the most important changes you make to improve your cardiovascular health. However, some people may find the prospect of moving from a sedentary to an active lifestyle daunting, even threatening. It need not be if you tailor your program to your likes and needs, move at your own speed, and respect your limits.<p> 
	As people become more active, they also start to make healthier choices in the foods they eat and the way they handle stress. The beneficial combination created by this "trickle-down" effect may go far in reducing the number of cardiovascular-related deaths.<p>

<b>EXERCISE BENEFITS CANCER PATIENTS</b><p>

The benefits of exercise extend far beyond cardiovascular fitness and the prevention of obesity and heart disease. Exercise aids in detoxification, digestion, weight control, and immune processes and can do wonders for mood and attitude, according to W. John Diamond, M.D., and William Lee Cowden, M.D., authors of An Alternative Medicine Definitive Guide to Cancer.<p>
Patients with advanced cancer who have received conventional medical treatment often spend many hours in a hospital bed, in contrast to those who undergo alternative cancer therapies who typically engage in regular exercise or physical activity. A brisk walk several times a week is a good start for any exercise program; low-impact aerobics, calisthenics, Qigong, stretching and flexing exercises, and gardening, among others, are all ways of strengthening the body's self-healing system.<p>
Among the anticancer benefits of physical exercise, well documented by clinical research, are the following, say Drs. Diamond and Cowden:<p>
<ul>
 <li>Aerobic activities increase oxygen supply to tissues; because cancer tends to flourish in an oxygen-poor environment, the well-exercised body is more likely to repel cancer cells.<p>
 <li>Any form of physical activity, because it involves muscle contractions, helps keep the lymphatic system (which filters toxins from the blood and supports the body's immune system) moving.<p>
 <li>Exercise stimulates the activity of natural killer cells and other components of the body's anticancer defenses.<p>
 <li>Exercise causes an elevation of body temperature and increases the production of pyrogen, a special substance that enhances the function of white blood cells.<p>
</ul>
People who maintain regular activity are less likely to develop colon cancer, the second leading cause of cancer-related death in the U.S. In helping to ward off colon cancer, exercise tends to benefit men more than women. Female college athletes, when compared to their nonathletic counterparts, have a lower incidence of cancers of the breast, ovary, cervix, vagina, and uterus. In the same study, the risk of developing cancers of the reproductive system was 2.5 times lower for the athletes than it was for the sedentary women.<p> 
In a study, men who burned as few as 500 calories a week in exercise—the equivalent to about an hour's worth of brisk walking—had death rates about 20% lower than men who rarely exercised. More avid exercisers experienced fewer cancer-related deaths: men who walked about 4 hours each week (about 2,000 calories burned) died of all cancers about 35% less frequently than their less active counterparts. A recent report from the Cooper Clinic in Dallas indicates that even moderate exercise—5 hours of walking per week—significantly reduces the risk of developing prostate cancer.<p>
Exercise also helps cancer patients maintain normal muscle mass, which can increase significantly their chances of recovery, according to Drs. Diamond and Cowden. Patients who are overweight or who lose lean tissue or muscle during therapy tend to have poorer prognoses.<p>
