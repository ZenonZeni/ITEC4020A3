<P><HR>
<P>
<OL><LI>When questioned for DUI before arrest,  you are not in custody for
purposes of Miranda warnings.  If you politely refuse to answer any of the
cop's questions concerning the DUI investigation, either before or after
arrest, then there won't be any statements that can be used against you in
court.
<P>
<LI>Field Sobriety Tests are completely voluntary.  If you perform them,
you may be arrested anyway.  It may be better not to give the cop evidence
that will be used against you in court.  You can politely refuse to do the
field sobriety exercises.
<P>
<LI>If you are older than 21, refuse to take a preliminary alcohol screening
test. This on scene breath test is completely voluntary and you have the
absolute right to refuse this type of breath test.
<P>
<LI>When given a choice of blood, breath, or urine test after arrest, choose
a urine test if at all possible.  It is the most unreliable of the three
chemical tests (blood, breath, or urine).
<P>
<LI>If no urine test available, choose a breath test.  The breath machines
are not 100% accurate and there are many possibilities for error.
<P>
<LI>Contact a friend or relative from jail as soon as possible so they can
hear you speak and note your state of sobriety.
<P>
<LI>Always be polite and respectful to the police officers.  How you are
perceived by a jury is extremely critical.
<P>
<LI>Some jurisdictions video the arrest, breath testing and/or booking process.
 Always be on your best behavior.
<P>
<LI>Make a detailed list of all the events before being stopped up to and
including being released from custody.
<P>
<LI>Retain an experienced DUI defense attorney to represent you.  Only an
experienced DUI defense attorney is able to spot your favorable issues and
present them to a prosecutor, judge or jury.

Remember, the best way to avoid a DUI conviction is to not drink and drive.
Purchasing a <A HREF = http://www.bestcom.com/asd/>Portable Breath Tester</A>
will also assist you in determining your alcohol level before you drive.
 Unfortunately, the way our laws are going even if you've had a small amount
of alcohol and you are not impaired, as long as you smell like alcohol your
chances of being arrested are very high.  However, being arrested for DUI
does not automatically result in a conviction or loss of your driver's license.
