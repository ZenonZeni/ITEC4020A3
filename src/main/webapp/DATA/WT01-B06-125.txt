<P><I><B><font color=#9F121B">A Guide to Vitamins, Minerals, and Supplements</I></B></font>, an Isis Interactive Library CD-ROM, will be available fourth quarter of 1996.  This product is being produced in cooperation with the Solgar Nutritional Research Center in Berlin, MD.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>The market for vitamins, minerals, and supplements is enormous.  It is estimated that the yearly expenditure in the U.S. is over $13 per person ($4.2 billion), followed closely by Germany, France, and Great Britain.  The success of vitamins and supplements has stemmed from consumer interest in assuring good health and longevity.  Also helping in the expansion of the dietary supplement market is the increase in product niche marketing to children, athletes, males, females, menopausal women and senior citizens.  Responding to this growing demand, manufacturers have stepped up advertising campaigns in print, radio and television.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>Nearly every medicine cabinet in the western world contains some sort of vitamins or supplements.  Many are never used because purchasers do not know what or how much they need of a given substance.  This product will answers those questions and more.</P>
