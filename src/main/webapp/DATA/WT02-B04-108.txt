A.      OVERVIEW
<p>
Senators Exon (D-NE) and Senator Gorton (R-WA) have 
introduced legislation to expand current FCC regulations on 
obscene and indecent audiotext to cover *all* content carried 
over all forms of electronic communications networks.  If 
enacted, the "Communications Decency Act of 1995" (S. 314) 
would place substantial criminal liability on 
telecommunications service providers (including telephone 
networks, commercial online services, the Internet, and 
independent BBS's) if their network is used in the 
transmission of any indecent, lewd, threatening or harassing 
messages.  The legislation is identical to a proposal offered 
by Senator Exon last year which failed along with the Senate 
Telecommunications reform bill (S. 1822, 103rd Congress, 
Sections 801 - 804). The text the proposed statute, with proposed
amendment, is appended at the end of this document.
<p>
The bill would compel service providers to chose between 
severely restricting the activities of their subscribers or 
completely shutting down their email, Internet access, and 
conferencing services under the threat of criminal liability.   
Moreover, service providers would be forced to closely 
monitor every private communication, electronic mail message, 
public forum, mailing list, and file archive carried by or 
available on their network, a proposition which poses a 
substantial threat to the freedom of speech and privacy 
rights of all American citizens.
<p>
S. 314, if enacted, would represent a tremendous step 
backwards on the path to a free and open National Information 
Infrastructure.  The bill raises fundamental questions about 
the ability of government to control content on 
communications networks, as well as the locus of liability 
for content carried in these new communications media.  
<p>
To address this threat to the First Amendment in digital 
media, CDT is working to organize a broad coalition of public 
interest organizations including the ACLU, People For the 
American Way, and Media Access Project, along with 
representatives from the telecommunications, online services, 
and computer industries to oppose S. 314 and to explore 
alternative policy solutions that preserve the free flow of 
information and freedom of speech in the online world.  CDT 
believes that technological alternatives which allow 
individual subscribers to control the content they receive 
represent a more appropriate approach to this issue.  
<p>
<p>
B.      SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS OF S. 314
<p>
S. 314 would expand current law restricting indecency and 
harassment on telephone services to all telecommunications 
providers and expand criminal liability to *all* content 
carried by *all* forms of telecommunications networks.  The 
bill would amend Section 223 of the Communications Act (47 
U.S.C. 223), which requires carriers to take steps to prevent 
minors from gaining access to indecent audiotext and 
criminalizes harassment accomplished over interstate 
telephone lines.  This section, commonly known as the Helms 
Amendment (having been championed by Senator Jesse Helms), 
has been the subject of extended constitutional litigation in 
recent years.
<p>
*       CARRIERS LIABLE FOR CONDUCT OF ALL USERS ON THEIR 
         NETWORKS
<p>
S. 314 would make telecommunication carriers (including 
telephone companies, commercial online services, the 
Internet, and BBS's) liable for every message, file, or other 
content carried on its network -- including the private 
conversations or messages exchanged between two consenting 
individuals.
<p>
Under S. 314, anyone who "makes, transmits, or otherwise 
makes available any comment, request, suggestion, proposal, 
image, or other communication" which is "obscene, lewd, 
lascivious, filthy, or indecent" using a "telecommunications 
device" would be subject to a fine of $100,000 or two years 
in prison (Section (2)(a)).    
<p>
In order to avoid liability under this provision, carriers 
would be forced to pre-screen all messages, files, or other 
content before transmitting it to the intended recipient.  
Carriers would also be forced to prevent or severely restrict 
their subscribers from communicating with individuals and 
accessing content available on other networks.
<p>
Electronic communications networks do not contain discrete 
boundaries.  Instead, users of one service can easily 
communicate with and access content available on other 
networks.  Placing the onus, and criminal liability, on the 
carrier as opposed to the originator of the content, would 
make the carrier legally responsible not only for the conduct 
of its own subscribers, but also for content generated by 
subscribers of other services.
<p>
This regulatory scheme clearly poses serious threats to the 
free flow of information throughout the online world and the 
free speech and privacy rights of individual users.  Forcing 
carriers to pre-screen content would not only be impossible 
due to the sheer volume of messages, it would also violate 
current legal protections.
<p>
*       CARRIERS REQUIRED TO ACT AS PRIVATE CENSOR OF ALL 
         PUBLIC FORUMS AND ARCHIVES
<p>
S. 314 would also expand current restrictions on access to 
indecent telephone audiotext services by minors under the age 
of 18 to cover similar content carried by telecommunications 
services (such as America Online and the Internet).  (Sec 
(a)(4)).
<p>
As amended by this provision, anyone who, "by means of 
telephone or telecommunications device, makes, transmits, or 
otherwise makes available (directly or by recording device) 
any indecent communication for commercial purposes which is 
available to any person under the age of 18 years of age or 
to any other person without that person's consent, regardless 
of whether the maker of such communication placed the call or 
initiated the communication" would be subject of a fine of 
$100,000 or two years in prison.
<p>
This would force carries to act as private censors of all 
content available in public forums or file archives on their 
networks.   Moreover, because there is no clear definition of 
indecency, carriers would have to restrict access to any 
content that could be possibly construed as indecent or 
obscene under the broadest interpretation of the term. Public 
forums, discussion lists, file archives, and content 
available for commercial purposes would have to be 
meticulously screened and censored in order to avoid 
potential liability for the carrier.
<p>
Such a scenario would severely limit the diversity of content 
available on online networks, and limit the editorial freedom 
of independent forum operators.   
<p>
ADDITIONAL NOTABLE PROVISIONS 
<p>
* AMENDMENT TO ECPA
<p>
Section (6) of the bill would amend the Electronic 
Communications Privacy Act (18 USC 2511) to prevent the 
unauthorized interception and disclosure of "digital 
communications" (Sec. 6).  However, because the term "digital
communication" is not defined and 18 USC 2511 currently 
prevents unauthorized interception and disclosure of 
"electronic communications" (which includes electronic mail 
and other forms of  communications in digital form), the 
effect of this provision has no clear importance.
<p>
* CABLE OPERATORS MAY REFUSE INDECENT PUBLIC ACCESS    
  PROGRAMMING
<p>
Finally, section (8) would amend sections 611 and 612 of the 
Communications Act (47 USC 611 - 612) to allow any cable 
operator to refuse to carry any public access or leased 
access programming which contains "obscenity, indecency, or 
nudity".  
<p>
<p>
C.      ALTERNATIVES TO EXON: RECOGNIZE THE UNIQUE USER CONTROL  
        CAPABILITIES OF INTERACTIVE MEDIA
<p>
Government regulation of content in the mass media has always 
been considered essential to protect children from access to 
sexually-explicit material, and to prevent unwitting 
listeners/views from being exposed to material that might be 
considered extremely distasteful.  The choice to protect 
children has historically been made at the expense of the First 
Amendment ban on government censorship.  As Congress moves to 
regulate new interactive media, it is essential that it 
understand that interactive media is different than mass 
media.  The power and flexibility of interactive media offers 
a unique opportunity to enable parents to control what 
content their kids have access to, and leave the flow of 
information free for those adults who want it.  Government 
control regulation is simply not needed to achieve the 
desired purpose.
<p>
Most interactive technology, such as Internet browsers and 
the software used to access online services such as America 
Online and Compuserve, already has the capability to limit 
access to certain types of services and selected information.  
Moreover, the electronic program guides being developed for 
interactive cable TV networks also provide users the 
capability to screen out certain channels or ever certain 
types of programming.  Moreover, in the online world, most 
content (with the exception of private communications 
initiated by consenting individuals) is transmitted by 
request.  In other words, users must seek out the content 
they receive, whether it is by joining a discussion or 
accessing a file archive.  By its nature, this technology 
provides ample control at the user level.  Carriers (such as 
commercial online services, Internet service providers) in 
most cases act only as "carriers" of electronic transmissions 
initiated by individual subscribers.
<p>
CDT believes that the First Amendment will be better served 
by giving parents and other users the tools to select which 
information they (and their children) should have access to.  
In the case of criminal content the originator of the 
content, not the carriers, should be responsible for their 
crimes.  And, users (especially parents) should be empowered 
to determine what information they and their children have 
access to.  If all carriers of electronic communications are 
forced restrict content in order to avoid criminal liability 
proposed by S. 314, the First Amendment would be threatened 
and the usefulness of digital media for communications and 
information dissemination would be drastically limited.
<p>
<p>
D.      NEXT STEPS
<p>
The bill has been introduced and will next move to the Senate 
Commerce Committee, although no Committee action has been 
scheduled.   Last year, a similar proposal by Senator Exon 
was approved by the Senate Commerce committee as an amendment 
to the Senate Telecommunications Bill (S. 1822, which died at 
the end of the 103rd Congress).  CDT will be working with a 
wide range of other interest groups to assure that Congress 
does not restrict the free flow of information in interactive 
media.
