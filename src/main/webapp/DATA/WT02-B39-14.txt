Arbs Pan Bergen Brunswig/Ivax Deal

They Say the Transaction May Fall Through, or at Least it Should
Bergen Brunswig Corp.'s $1.66 billion stock deal with generic drug manufacturer
Ivax Corp. has some arbitrageurs scratching their heads, although analysts are
more positive on the deal.

The deal for financially trouble Ivax-a rare example of a drug wholesaler
buying a drug manufacturer-led to tumbles in both companies' stocks after it
was announced Tuesday. Bergen Brunswig fell $5.125, or 15.6%, to close at
$27.625, and Ivax dropped $3.75, or 21%, to close at $12.50, a 52-week low.

The deal followed Ivax's disclosure earlier this year that earnings would be
lower than anticipated and that the company would therefore violate its bank
covenants.

"It's a terrible deal and Bergen is nuts," said one arbitrageur.
"If the deal breaks, we think Ivax goes down considerably and Bergen Brunswig
won't move much," the arb added, giving the deal even odds of collapse.
"There's a lot of shareholder anger out there," he said.

Another arb said Bergen Brunswig is sure to annoy a lot of its suppliers and
will have to choose between their products and Ivax's. "Bergen Brunswig is
buying a company that does a lot of business with people they compete with," he
said.

If Bergen Brunswig shareholders vote against a deal with Ivax, it won't be the
first time Ivax got left at the altar. Shareholders of Halfslund Nycomed of
Norway rejected a stock swap with Ivax late last year.

But because insiders at both Ivax and Bergen Brunswig hold large amounts of
shares, any anti-deal sentiment doesn't much matter, a third arb said.

"If I'm a Bergen shareholder, I'd be very upset about the transaction," the arb
said. "But I don't think it's a deal killer."

The arb explained the Ivax drop as simple mathematics, offering that the .42
shares of Bergen Brunswig shares Ivax shareholders would receive for each of
theirs valued the stock at 11.6025, less than its trading level at the time.

"Maybe that's all Ivax could get," he said.
Not everyone was negative on the transaction. Analyst Kevin Silverman of Everen
Securities had good things to say about it. He suggested Ivax would give Bergen
Brunswig additional profits that would otherwise go to its suppliers.

"They're buying products from existing manufacturers and earning 15%,"
Silverman said. "The manufacturers are making 40%.

Combined with Bergen Brunswig's $2 billion in generic drug sales, the addition
of generic drugs manufactured at Ivax could add another $600 million to the top
line, he said.

"It makes perfect sense to me."
Silverman said Bergen Brunswig stock dropped because the deal brings dilution
of 30 cents per share and 30 cents times 15 equals $4.50.   "That's about what
the stock dropped on the first day," he said.

Another reason for the stock drops, Silverman said, is that such a deal has
never been done before. "People don't particularly like change and that's what
they're getting here."

Olympic Continues Search for Gold

But Followers of its Situation Suggest Only Fools Would Bite
Olympic Financial Ltd. continues to insist publicly that its search for a buyer
is moving ahead, but the search for a new CEO, the resignation of a board
member and the adoption of a poison pill have left observers wondering whether
Olympic will sell.

Minneapolis-based Olympic, the nation's largest independent provider of
automobile financing, is moving full speed ahead with its search for a new CEO.
Jeffrey Mack resigned as CEO on Aug. 26, the same day Olympic announced it was
entertaining an offer from an interested party.

Bob Ollech, an analyst with Principal Financial Securities, said he just
received a call from the headhunter employed by Olympic looking for leads for
its search. "According to her, they were in the early stages, still looking
around," Ollech said.

Mack was said to have balked at the idea of selling the company, according to
Ollech, but the board that he chose proved to be more powerful than him and
decided to move ahead with the plan despite his objections. Ollech added that
the search for a new CEO makes any sale even less likely.

"It certainly makes you think it's less likely to happen, only from a common
sense standpoint," Ollech said. "If they were to offer the CEO position to
someone, and in the same breath try to sell the company, they'd have a hard
time selling that job. On the other hand, they need a strong CEO to run
day-to-day operations in the event that they can't sell it anymore."

Jennifer Wykert, investor relations consultant for Olympic, described Olympic's
decision to step up its search as a "prudent action" to avoid having to start
from ground zero if a suitor with the right price fails to materialize.

The resignation of board member Rick Zona, which came around Oct. 22, after the
initial buyer declined to make an offer, raised even more eyebrows and
concerns, according to one analyst who asked not to be named.

Ollech speculated that there could have been a number of circumstances that
could have led to Zona's untimely departure. As the first theory goes, First
Bank Systems Inc. may have been looking seriously at buying Olympic, and Zona,
who is vice chairman of finance at the regional bank holding company, resigned
to avoid any possible conflict of interest. The second possibility was that
Zona had a "falling out" with the board about selling.

Third, Ollech continued, because Zona was on Olympic's audit committee, perhaps
there was something afoot in terms of the company's financial condition, or
credit quality. Another possibility is that he resigned for personal reasons.

In any case, the tumultuous activity has not helped Olympic's already volatile
stock, which hit a high of $26.625 in September. At presstime, Olympic's stock
was $15.75, which was a modest recovery from a recent $13.50 low.

Last month, Olympic announced that a first round of buyers had decided against
making definitive offers for the company. But it said a second group of suitors
that had been waiting in the wings were stepping in with their proposals,
including an outright sale, an equity infusion and a strategic alliance.

Then, on Nov. 4, Olympic adopted a poison pill to thwart any attempt at a
hostile takeover.

Pat McGurn, director of corporate programs with Institutional
Shareholder Services, said this move is not unusual. "Diana Corp. went through
a well-publicized shopping of itself and, in the end, decided not to do it at
all, and then adopted a poison pill," McGurn said.

One arbitrageur saw it more as a move of desperation. "Their stock tanked.
They're afraid somebody could come in and buy them on the cheap," the arb said.
"They may well be talking to people, but if they couldn't find a good buyer
when their stock was in the low $20s, how can they expect it when the stock is
at $15."

Meanwhile, an analyst who asked not to be named raised questions about
Olympic's ability to find a buyer. He said, "Olympic has a $2.20 per share
[earnings] estimate for '97. If someone really believed that $2.20 estimate,
why would they not be able to get someone? That's 12 or 13 times earnings."

A number of other analysts agreed that a sale does not seem to be in Olympic's
immediate future.

Robert Evans, an analyst with John G. Kinnard & Co., said Olympic is still
talking to three or four parties regarding the sale of the company, but, "I
don't know if it's at the same pace and sense of urgency as it was. In my
opinion, the company is probably not going to be acquired at least in the next
few weeks."
In its latest move, Olympic hedged its position by saying it had reevaluated
its price objective, leaving the door open to a slightly lower bid.

Nice-Guy Strategy Improves Zell's Odds

The Gravedancer Drops His Lawsuit and Goes After the Votes
Sam Zell is still zealously pursuing Chateau Properties, Inc., but now he's
using sugar instead of vinegar to catch his fly.

By dropping a lawsuit and his hostile tender offer via his Manufactured Home
Communities, Inc. (MHC), and tailoring his $387.3 million bid to management's
needs, he's revealing whose favor he's courting: the holders of operating
partnership (OP) units.

Sources debated whether the tactic would work. At presstime, Chateau announced
its rejection of MHC's bid, but that surely will not stop Zell in his tracks,
sources said.

"If anything, the likelihood of his succeeding has increased to say 75%/25%,"
an analyst said.

MHC currently is under agreement to merge with ROC Communities in a $TK million
deal. Chateau would have to reject Zell's offer or pony up a reported $10
million to $12 million break-up fee for its merger with ROC.

"[Chateau Chairman John Boll] may just be posturing to get the decks clean" by
betting shareholders won't approve the ROC merger. Then he would be free to
pursue the Zell offer.

Indeed, the outcome of ROC's and Chateau's proxy votes this week will play a
large role in whether the Chicago investor ultimately will attain his goal.

On one side were those who saw Zell losing out if he couldn't accomplish the
task of convincing shareholders to vote down the merger. On the other side were
those who believed shareholders would indeed disapprove the merger, leaving
Clinton Township, Mich.-based Chateau vulnerable to his advances.

The Chateau/ROC merger was universally panned by analysts. "This is a unique
situation where one plus one equals less than two," said one who declined to be
named. "I can't imagine two-thirds of ROC holders approving the deal," he
added, giving a higher probability to an eventual Zell win.

The latest MHC strategy consisted of a choice of $26 cash or a convertible
preferred security "designed to address the needs of Chateau OP Unit holders,"
according to a press release. The former bid offered to exchange $26 in cash or
1.15 MHC common share per Chateau share. Taxes would have removed about $4.50
per share from the cash offer, which is what the OP unit holders would have had
to take, sources said.

The initial plan also would have consumed resources that sources said are
better spent enticing Chateau.

"The tender offer would have dragged on for months. This was Zell's effort to
reach closure, a desire to merge sooner rather than later," said Louis Taylor,
an analyst with Prudential Securities.

Sources did agree that the new bid was superior and had a better chance of
success, but one said he'd hold off judgment until Englewood, Colo.-based ROC
holds its vote.

The dialogue surrounding the triangle-formerly a square when Sun Communities
weighed in with a bid for Chateau-has been decidedly one-sided, said
Christopher Hartung, an analyst with Montgomery Securities.

"MHC is the only one we've heard from," he said. "They've got a great marketing
machine. Because Chateau and ROC have been limited as to what they can say, we
haven't heard the whole story," Hartung added.

Additionally, the MHC line has been that its bid offered a generous multiple in
an undervalued industry. But with Chateau's stock price at $24.375 at
presstime, Zell's bid confers on Chateau a premium of only 6%, hardly the 21%
of the original offer.

That said, now that Chateau turned down Chicago-based MHC's bid, it could face
shareholder charges that it breached its fiduciary duty. "They'll have to ask
if management is making decisions based on economics or emotions," said Taylor.
"Are they fighting for the company or for their long term employment?" he
added.

Officials at the three companies, all of which own and operate mobile home
parks, did not return phone calls *Kate Maletz.

Restructuring  Coming For Fitzgeralds Gamin:

A prepackaged restructuring seems to be in the offing for beleaguered
Fitzgeralds Gaming Corp., as both debt and equity are held by fewer than a
dozen groups, sources said.

As the private, Las Vegas-based operator of hotels and casinos, heads into
December with an $8 million interest payment looming large, interest coverage
is barely one to one, sources said. And while Fitzgeralds CFO Fernando
Bensuaski said the company "intends" to make the payment, he could make no
assurances.

He added that the company is in the process of trying to secure financing from
institutional investors, whom he would not identify. And while Bensuaski flatly
denied a bankruptcy is impending, sources didn't buy it.

The culprit, sources said, is the usual one: a combination of too much debt on
a company in an out-of-favor, and highly competitive industry.

One distressed source saw one of three scenarios likely: the bondholders will
gain equity in a new company, the casinos will be sold off piecemeal, or a
combination of the two will occur.

Fitzgeralds' bonds-$123 million in 13% senior secured notes due 2002-are thinly
traded and last sold for 72 in mid September. The issue was a year old on
Saturday.

Management owns about 80% of the common stock. The company also has issued $20
million in preferred stock and $25 million in mixed tranches including $18
million in notes secured on the company's Reno property with interest at prime
plus one.

The 13%s are owned by "less than half a dozen" holders, with Putnam Investments
possessing the bulk, a source said. Putnam's analyst Herb Wagner declined to
comment.

The concentration of notes in few hands could mean a quick end to Fitzgeralds'
suffering. "Maybe they [the holders] could force a restructuring that's
beneficial to them," said Kevin Pilot, the president of Phoenix Capital. And
while Bensuaski insisted no talks about bankruptcy have taken place, the market
was saying a restructuring was in the offing.

"As long as they can make payroll, it makes sense for them to make some kind of
deal," with the bondholders, said Andrew Susser, an analyst with Moody's
Investors Service, which downgraded the 13%s from B3 to Caa Nov. 7.

"The question is, can they compete long term?" Susser said. "That's a call the
noteholders have to make."

A gaming analyst who requested anonymity said, "Long term, it's a tough
company. There is a future in this company."

Fitzgeralds has made some significant capital expenditures recently, including
hotel rooms in its Tunica, Miss., satellite and new restaurants in its Las
Vegas and Tunica locations. Sources said the investment could pay off.

But in the meantime, the company's "high leverage, low liquidity, weak cash
flows, heavy amortization schedule, and competitive pressures in each if its
key markets," remain a problem, according to Moody's.

Bensuaski said Fitzgeralds' plans include seeking capital with the help of
Southcoast Capital Corp., an investment bank it hired in August. It could not
be determined why Oppenheimer & Co. was no longer representing Fitzgerald.

The company hasn't released its third quarter numbers yet, but "we don't expect
great results," said the gaming analyst. He added he expected earnings would be
flat compared with last year.

Fitzgeralds' troubles hang against a backdrop of an industry saturated with
players. The entire gaming sector is hurting, sources said, especially in
Tunica, where the company just completed construction on a 507 room hotel,
Fitzgeralds Tunica. Competition in the area is fierce, Susser said, and the
addition of Harrah's Mardi Gras and Grand Casinos earlier this year have
increased the number of gaming positions by 40%.

The Reno, Nev. outpost, Silver Legacy, saw steep room-rate discounting and
lower margins due in part to the absence of a major bowling tournament. Bowling
events, though, should draw people to the area in 1997 and 1998, but room rates
could drop further as more hotels are scheduled to open in the city *Kate
Maletz.

Reconfigured Deal For FoxMeyer

McKesson Corp. renegotiated the terms of its purchase of bankrupt
FoxMeyer Corp., working out a deal that a source said "won't even cover
lawyer's fees."

A Delaware court approved the transaction whereby McKesson pays $20 million to
$23 million in cash to the bankrupt estate. Then, the first $20 million that
the company collects in receivables would go to McKesson, and the next $10
million in receivables will be split 50%/50% by McKesson and the estate,
according to the source who was present at an auction hearing on Nov. 8. The
remainder would go to the estate, and would pay off professional fees.

The former deal saw McKesson paying $80 million in cash, which would be held in
escrow for about six months, sources said.

The source said vendors complained about the new arrangement and that the money
would be difficult to collect. Robert Peiser, the company's vice chairman and
CEO, theorized that with the outstanding receivables amounting to $90 million,
and McKesson skimming off the first $25 million, the receivables could reach
$70 million to $75 million.

"I think that's insane," the source said. "It's complex, it's not that easy to
recover."

The unsecured trade claims dipped back to the 10 to 12 range from the 15 to 20
they were at the week before on the news of the reconfigured deal. "Rumors that
another company would come in [with a better bid] had held up the unsecured
trade claims," the source said *Kate Maletz.

DOj takes new Mergers approach

The Department of Justice's Antitrust Division's broadening of traditional
legal reviews of anticompetitive issues allows for fairer analyses of
horizontal mergers, the acting head of the division said in a recent speech.

Speaking earlier this month before the American Bar Association in Washington,
Joel Klein said the DOJ now looks beyond the two traditionally recognized
methods of antitrust analysis: "per se" and "rule of reason."

According to the Supreme Court, per se mergers, which account for a small
minority of cases, are those "because of their pernicious effect on competition
and lack of any redeeming virtue are conclusively presumed to be unreasonable.
Rule of reason analyses require a comprehensive market analyses of pro- and
anti-competitive effects.

"A reasonable mode of antitrust analysis needn't always require full-blown
assessments of market effects," Klein said. "Some middle ground between the two
traditional approaches often makes sense.

"Matters that are too complex for per se condemnation sometimes get shoe horned
into that category, while some  anticompetitive practices without any
demonstrable virtue escape condemnation because of insufficient evidence to
satisfy the requirements of a full-blown market analysis," he said.

Rather than restrict itself to the per se and rule of reason  polar
alternatives, the DOJ, Klein said, uses a three-step approach when considering
whether horizontal mergers would directly limit price or production competition

The first step, he said, is to decide whether the deal would be a per se
violation, such as an agreement to fix prices, curtail output or divide
markets. Once the DOJ concludes a horizontal deal is not per se illegal, he
continued, the agency then asks the parties involved whether there's a
"procompetitive justification" for the agreement.

"We expect a response that doesn't merely speculate about the existence of
efficiencies, but rather comes forward with real world factual and expert
economic evidence to support the claim," he said.

If the DOJ finds significant procompetitive benefits to a deal, Klein said, the
agency then looks at whether likely anti-competitive effects would outweigh
them. "The key point I want to stress," he said, "is that only if there are
real procompetitive benefits should there be any need to show actual
anticompetitive effects."

Using such analyses, Klein said, should open the door to at least some
additional consideration of procompetitive justifications for horizontal
mergers. On the other hand, he added, the approach also ensures that facially
anticompetitive, but potentially justifiable, agreements are not automatically
given green lights simply because they can't be condemned as per se illegal.

"By requiring proof of procompetitive benefits, we're lessening the burden of
proving a violation compared to what we'd have to show under a full-blown rule
of reason analysis," he said *Richard Rubin.

Arbs Miffed at AIM's Abstention

Arbs were seething that one Wallace Computer Services, Inc. shareholder
abstained from a Nov. 6 vote on whether shareholders have a voice in takeovers.

AIM Strategic Income Fund, a closed-end management investment company,
abstained, after initially signaling it was in favor of the proposed bylaw
change that would require Wallace's board to hold a shareholder vote within 90
days after it received a qualified bid in order to keep up a defensive posture
against the offer. An AIM spokesman verified that the fund abstained on the
vote.

The absence of its four million votes prevented a quorum and ensured a victory
for Wallace's board, which has defended its refusal to consider a 1995 bid from
Moore Corp., an arbitrageur said.

Now some investors are protesting by refusing to buy AIM funds, the arb said.
"In no way was AIM acting in the best interest of its shareholders by taking
its stock out of play," he added *Kate Maletz.

ADT Auto Auction Unit Going

ADT Ltd. will divest ADT Automotive, its U.S. vehicle auction business, the
company announced. The sale would mean the exit from operations outside the

ADT is the second largest provider of vehicle auction services in the United
States with 27 locations.

Boca Raton, Fla.-based ADT Automotive generated net income of $41 million on
sales of $286 million for the year ended Sept. 30. The parent posted third
quarter net income of $18.6 million, or 13 cents per share, on revenue of $429
million, compared to net income of $18 million, or 13 cents per share, on
revenue of $444 million the previous third quarter.

TI May Sell off Defense and Electronics Units

While Texas Instruments denies it, the industry was abuzz with rumors that the
Dallas semiconductor giant would sell off its defense systems and electronics
business subsidiaries.

A decline in U.S. defense spending and consolidation in the industry are
reasons Texas Instruments would be looking to rid itself of the operations,
said Michael Geran, an analyst with Pershing Investment Research.

"The equipment side of their [the Pentagon's] budget has been whacked. You've
got a situation where the whole industry is changing and you have to put up the
crown jewels to see what they're worth," he added.
Possible acquirors for the units are McDonnell Douglas Corp., Raytheon Co.,
Northrup Grumman and General Motors Corp.'s Hughes Electronics.

Texas Instruments declined to comment on the speculation, saying only that the
company had not made any announcements.

TI posted a third quarter net loss of $148 million, or 78 cents per share
(including a one-time $192 million acquisition-related charge) on revenue of
$2.8 billion, compared to net income of $289 million, or $1.48 per share, on
revenue of $3.4 billion the year-earlier period.

According to the company, revenue for the businesses was up slightly over the
year-earlier period and margins remained stable.

Without the charge, net income was $44 million, or 23 cents per share.  The
company would not break out numbers on the units.

Griffon Exits Hardware Biz

Focusing on its core operations, Griffon Corp. has decided to sell its
specialty hardware business as part of an effort to eliminate divisions that do
not fit into its long-term growth plans.

The specialty hardware business, together with the synthetic batting division,
has annual sales in the range of $40 million and operates at approximately a
break-even level, according to the company. The two businesses had been
reclassified as disconfrom the sales, estimated at
$8 million, will be used to acquire shares und60s," the
spokesman said. "They have been marginally profitable. In fact, we haven't even
publicized them as part of our division for many years. It was just time. They
don't have anything to do with our three major divisions."

Griffon, noted for its diversity of products, has businesses that manufacture
garage doors, specialty plastic films used in diapers and other personal
products, and information and communication systems.

Champion Builds Future With Redman

Cited by Fortune as one of the "100 Fastest Growing Companies in America,"
Champion Enterprises, the second-largest manufactured housing producer in the
U.S., grew another 75% in October when it acquired number three Redman
Industries  in a $367 million stock swap.

The new company, with 1995 pro forma sales of $1.4 billion, is nipping at the
heels of industry leader  Fleetwood Enterprises, with sales of $2 billion.

Champion, based in Auburn Hills, Mich., has grown from being No. 5 to No. 2 in
three years through high internal growth as well as acquisitions, said
Jacqueline Dout, Champion's CFO. Dallas-based Redman was Champion's seventh
acquisition in two-and-a-half years, she said.

"It was a tremendous acquisition," said Troy Ussery, an analyst at Rauscher
Pierce Refsnes. "It brought Champion to the position of being one of the
largduct line complements our product line very nicely," Dout said. "We
are similar in the fact that we focus on mid- to high-end manufacturing in
housing, but in most areas of the country we're at slightly different price
points so we complement each otherd financial advisor to Redman. At that time,
explained Jeoff Stern, Champiobig percentage of
the industry. Fleetwood holds about 20% and the next four share the next 40% to
50% of the market. The remaining 30% of the industry is split among another 100
companies.

Making a Geographic  Fit
In addition to the growth factor, the other major motivation behind the
acquisition was geographic: a natural merger of two similar, regional companies
that, together, would serve almost the entire country.

"Their product line complements our product line very nicely," Dout said. "We
are similar in the fact that we focus on mid- to high-end manufacturing in
housing, but in most areas of the country we're at slightly different price
points so we complement each otherd financial advisor to Redman. At that time,
explained Jeoff Stern, Champion's advisor and a managing director at Donaldson
Lufkin & Jenrette, Champion was a much smaller company, Redman was private, and
the two CEOs shared a strong mutual respect.

But it wasn't until June 5 of this year that Alexander, on Redman's behalf,
approached Young at an industry conference about a possible deal. It would be
the only company Redman would talk to.

"I approached no one else" but Champion, said Alexander. "It was Sturgess'
view-and he had spoken with members of his board-that the commonality of focus
in terms of business strategy, and yet the differences in the physical
locations of facilities, made this a combination that was a win-win for both
sides, which doesn't happen often today."

Young met with Sturgess and the financial advisors of both companies almost a
month later to pursue the stock transaction. After that, things moved rather
quickly.

A rumor of illness at the top of Redman may have contributed to the speed with
which the deal was done, according to one source who asked not to be
ideh. "Redman deserved a slightly higher price because of its sheer magnitude,
and its quality and depth of management," U diligence, the group met again to
discuss a range of exchange ratios, the midpoint of which was 1.24 Champion
shares per Redman share. The ratio and the deal were soon settled upon.

A pooling transaction was important to the deal, Dout said. "By merging the two
companies together, it makes us stronger financially and operationally. This
way both shareholders win. We always go for a win-win proposition."

Although analysts uniformly agreed that Champion paid a higher multiple of
operating profit for Redman than previous acquisitions-6.4 times EBITDA
compared to an average 3.9 times-they also agreed that Champion got its money's
worth. "Redman deserved a slightly higher price because of its sheer magnitude,
and its quality and depth of management," Ussery said.

"The big question is: 'What's next?,'" said Ussery. "Champion will clearly
benefit in the upcoming year from the Redman acquisition, but we have several
other major competitors who will run out of steam in 1997 without an
acquisition. This is the tip of the iceberg."

Ussery added that when using the same evaluation as the Redman acquisition,
Belmont Homes, the nation's eleventh largest manufactured home builder, would
be around $16 a share; so at its current price of $10.50, it's bound to be
raising eyebrows-with Champion or other industry players.

"With Redman, the immediate need for more acquisitions isn't as great for
Champion, but Walt [Young] has never been one to pass up a bargain," Ussery
said Alena Joy Berenblatt.
