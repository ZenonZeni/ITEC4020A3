The company goal is to develop and exploit a wide offering of products and engineering services related to structural strain measurement. SMS products will allow inexpensive, reliable, and timely prediction of structural failures to an extent not possible under competing technologies.<P>

The patented SMS <I>Intelli</I> Sense (TM) technology involves so-called "smart" materials, in particular Peak Strain Indicating (PSI) steel alloys capable of "remembering" peak strains placed upon them. These alloys are engineered into sensor systems that allow, for example, a bridge toe to be structurally interrogated remotely by phone. The systems allow bridges and airplanes to proactively announce their pending structural failure in time for remedies. For the first time the user can know accurately and immediately how close to failure a structural element has come. Furthermore, that information can be captured with no external support systems. It does not matter whether the damage arose from instantaneous strain, corrosion, or fatigue. The strain instrument "remembers" the maximum strain/deformation it has experienced  so that the information may be monitored in real time or at some later time. <P>

The SMS IntelliSense technology is equally useful in military and civilian planes, equipment, bridges, and buildings. The significant maintenance savings and safety enhancements offered by the SMS technology are valuable in both environments.<P>

Potential customers include all government agencies responsible for bridge maintenance and safety; as well as manufacturers and operators of stressed structures, including airplanes, pipelines, and pressure vessels. The technology is of particular value in earthquake prone areas and can be used to monitor bridges, pipelines, tunnels, viaducts, runways, and buildings. Other applications include fasteners and other mechanical applications.<P>

Next commercialization step: SMS is looking for strategic allies in the areas of civil engineering, aerospace applications, and fasteners.<P>
