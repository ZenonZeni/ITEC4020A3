<BR>

In a roundabout way, when you invest in a U.S. government mutual fund,
you participate in funding the operations of the U.S. government.
Securities that government mutual funds invest in include securities
issued by the U.S. Treasury, its agencies and instrumentalities. 
<P>

"Think of the federal government as a corporation, and the U.S. Treasury
as the corporation's treasurer," says Kemper Portfolio Strategist Rob
Schumacher. "The government has business to do (projects to spend money
on such as defense, social programs and so on) and the treasurer is in
charge of making sure that the necessary resources are available."
<P>

How much money does the country need to run? In 1996, the budget
proposal is for $1.6 trillion. Payroll and corporate taxes provide some
of
what's needed. But because the country's spending has exceeded its
revenue
every year since 1969, the government borrows heavily to pay for all of
what it wants to do. In fact, the U.S. government securities market is
the largest securities market in the world. In a typical week (we'll use
the week starting February 5, 1996 as an example), the U.S. Treasury
will
borrow more than $19 billion to meet its maturing obligations and
projected cash needs.
<P>

Although opinions differ about the appropriateness of Uncle Sam's
spending habits, its system for raising funds is impressive. (As
Schumacher says, "When you owe people several trillion dollars, you have
to have a very efficient method of making sure that you can meet your
obligations.")
<P>

Unlike what other borrowers might encounter, the government has no
problem raising funds because the securities the U.S. Treasury issues
are direct obligations of the U.S. Treasury - they're backed by the
"full faith and credit" of the United States. Mutual funds, institutions
and individuals are among the groups willing to invest in these
securities. (Of course, mutual fund shares are not guaranteed.)
<P>

In order to meet its financing requirements (which include making
interest payments due on its debt), the Treasury auctions securities of
varying maturities. Most of the funds are borrowed for a short time, and
13-week and
26-week Treasury bills are auctioned every week. Treasuries of longer
maturities are auctioned less frequently.
<P>

Perhaps the greatest variable in the process is the price that the
government will have to pay for funds it borrows. This "price" is
influenced by interest rates as set by the Federal Reserve Board and the
open market. 
<P>

And, Schumacher says, it's in the monitoring of interest rates where the
professional management of a government income mutual fund can provide
value to fund shareholders. "What are interest rates going to do? What
maturity Treasury securities should the fund be investing in for maximum
performance?" According to Schumacher, "These are the questions the
professional manager deals with every day."
