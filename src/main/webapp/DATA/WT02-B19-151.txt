<b>MIE1201H - Fluid Mechanics III</b> - <a href="../../staff/profiles/currie.html"> I.G. Currie </a>
<br>
This fundamental course develops the conservation laws 
governing the motion of a continuum and applies the results 
to the case of Newtonian fluids, which leads to the Navier-
Stokes equations. From these general equations, some 
theorems are derived from specific circumstances such as 
incompressible fluids or inviscid fluids. Basic solutions to, and 
properties of, the governing equations are explored for the 
case of viscous, but incompressible, fluids. Topics included 
involve exact solutions, low-Reynolds-number flows, and 
laminar boundary layers.<p>


<b>MIE1202H - Fluid Mechanics IV</b> - <a href="../../staff/profiles/currie.html"> I.G. Currie </a>
<br>
A continuation of Fluid Mechanics III in which basic solutions 
and properties of the governing equations are explored for 
ideal-fluid flow and for compressible fluid flow.  Topics include 
two-dimensional and three-dimensional potential flows, 
surface waves, acoustics, shock waves, subsonic and 
supersonic flows. <p>

<b>MIE1206H - Non-Newtonian Fluid Mechanics</b> - <a href="../../staff/profiles/james.html"> D.F. James </a>
<br>
Constitutive relations used to describe the non-Newtonian 
behaviour of complex liquids and the physical bases for the 
relations is emphasized. Particular topics include the flow of a 
generalized Newtonian fluid; rheology of suspensions; 
viscoelastic behaviour of polymer solutions; mechanical 
models for macromolecules in solution and the formulation of 
constitutive equations for dilute polymer solutions; network 
and reptation models for entangled polymer chains and 
constitutive equations for concentrated polymer solutions and 
melts.<p>

<b>MIE1207H - Structure of Turbulent Flows</b> - <a href="../../staff/profiles/keffer.html"> J.F. Keffer </a>
<br>
This is a first level course in turbulent flows following an 
exposure to basic undergraduate fluid mechanics.  It deals 
with the governing equations of motion, statistical 
representation of the turbulent field and describes 
fundamental shear flows such as jets, wakes and boundary 
layers. Emphasis is placed on the physical aspects of the 
motion. <p>

<b>MIE1209H - Advanced Topics in Turbulent Flows</b> - <a href="../../staff/profiles/sullivan.html"> P.E. Sullivan </a>
<br>
This is a continuation of MIE1207H. The topics covered in this 
course include: vorticity and vortex stretching,  the energy 
cascade, an introduction to transport equations, local 
equilibrium, stress-transport, coherent structures, and eddy 
viscosity transport models. There will be discussion of 
experimental and computational techniques.<p>

<b>MIE1210H - Computational Fluid Mechanics and Heat Transfer</b> - <a href="../../staff/profiles/ethier.html"> C.R. Ethier </a>
<br>
Finite difference and finite element methods in fluid 
mechanics are presented, with particular emphasis on 
incompressible flows and flows involving heat transfer.  A brief 
survey of numerical linear algebra is followed by a discussion 
of stability, accuracy and convergence criteria.  Model elliptic, 
parabolic and hyperbolic problems are then considered.  
Solution of the Navier-Stokes and energy equations in the 
vorticity-stream function and primitive variable forms is 
presented.  A working knowledge of a computer language  is 
required. <p>

<b>MIE1211H - Advanced Topics in Convection</b> - <a href="../../staff/profiles/mostaghimi.html"> J. Mostaghimi </a>
<br>
Numerical methods of computation of heat and mass transfer, 
both laminar and turbulent flows considered, emphasis on 
turbulent flows, free shear flows; parabolic equations 
describing boundary layers on bodies, jets, plumes; elliptic 
equations describing recirculating regions solved using mixing 
length and k-methods. <p>

<b>MIE1213H - Advanced Topics in Computational Fluid Dynamics</b> - <a href="../../staff/profiles/lightstone.html"> M.F. Lightstone </a>
<br>
This course focuses on the numerical solution of the 
governing equations for momentum, heat, and mass transfer 
for laminar flows using the finite-volume approach.  Emphasis 
is on discretization techniques that retain the essential physics 
of the problem.  Other topics include multigrid solvers, 
pressure-velocity coupling, and solution stability. A working 
knowledge of FORTRAN is required. <p>

<b>MIE1220H - Environmental Fluid Dynamics</b> - <a href="../../staff/profiles/loewen.html"> M.R. Loewen </a>
<br>
Quantitative methods for predicting the transport and 
dispersion of pollutants in rivers, lakes and oceans are 
presented.  Topics include: (i) diffusion and shear flow 
dispersion, (ii) turbulent jets and plumes, (iii) mixing in 
channels and rivers, (iv) mixing in lakes and oceans, and (v) oil 
spills. <p>

<b>MIE519F - Environmental Fluid Mechanics</b> - <a href="../../staff/profiles/lightstone.html"> M.F. Lightstone </a>
<br>
This course provides a survey of several areas in 
environmental fluid mechanics.  Among the subjects to be 
discussed are: the structural of the atmospheric boundary 
layer; geophysical mixing; smoke plumes; flow in rivers and 
lakes; the shallow water equations; mixing in reservoirs; 
sewage and waste to plumes.<p>

<b>MIE544H - Air Pollution and Control</b> - <a href="../../staff/profiles/keffer.html"> J.F. Keffer </a>
<br>
Introduction to historical, social and health aspects of air 
pollution.  Discussion of crucial issues such as global change, 
ozone depletion and acid rain. Air pollution meteorology.  
Atmospheric dispersion and modeling. Pollution control 
concepts. <p>
