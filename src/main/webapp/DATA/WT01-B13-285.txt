<BODY>
If you've recently made an account transaction or changed any
of the services or features on your account, you probably noticed
a few changes in your confirmation statement.  In late August,
we introduced the second phase of our project to consolidate your
transaction confirmation statements.  Now, when several changes
or transactions occur on your Kemper Funds accounts during the
same day, you'll receive one consolidated statement, instead of
separate statements for each individual transaction. 
<P>
For example, an exchange of shares from one fund to another would
previously prompt two statements:  one confirming a redemption
and one confirming a purchase.  Now, one statement confirms both
transactions.  
<P>
Another difference you'll notice is that your transaction confirmation
statement no longer shows any prior account transactions.  Previously,
your statement included your transactions year-to-date or the
last 18 transactions on your account, whichever was the smallest
number of transactions.  Now, you'll see only the transaction
that prompted the statement.  This change should help to eliminate
confusion by differentiating transaction confirmation statements
from quarterly account statements.    
<P>
&quot;We're very pleased to introduce this new phase in our consolidated
statement project,&quot;  says Ann Laughlin, first vice president
of Kemper Shareholder Marketing and Broker Communications.  &quot;By
simplifying the way in which we report transactions and consolidating
daily account activity onto one statement, we hope to eliminate
confusion<I> and</I> help to reduce fund expenses.&quot; 
<P>
Transaction confirmation statements now have the same look and
format as your quarterly statement.  No matter what type of statement
you receive from us, information such as the date of your statement,
your fund and account numbers and the tax identification number
on your account can always be found in the same place.  Transaction
confirmation statements will be consolidated in the same manner
as your quarterly statements:  All accounts with the same registration,
address and tax identification number will appear on one statement,
unless you have requested otherwise.
