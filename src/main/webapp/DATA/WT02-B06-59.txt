<H2><CENTER>MSN, THE MICROSOFT NETWORK<BR>
MEMBER AGREEMENT</CENTER>
</H2>
<BR>
The Microsoft Network (&quot;MSN&quot;) is an online service provided by
The Microsoft Network, L.L.C. (&quot;MSP&quot;), through Microsoft Corporation
(&quot;Microsoft&quot;), subject to the terms and conditions of this member
agreement (&quot;Agreement&quot;). This Agreement constitutes the entire
agreement between you as an authorized user of MSN (&quot;you&quot; or &quot;Member&quot;),
MSP and Microsoft with respect to MSN. By using MSN, you confirm your acceptance
of, and agree to be bound by, this Agreement. <A NAME="gen_info"></A>
<H3>1. Member Information. </H3>
1.1 The name, address and payment information that you provide when you
join MSN, together with information regarding the manner in which you use
MSN, will not be processed or disclosed by MSP except as permitted by this
Agreement. <A NAME="one_two"></A><BR>
<BR>
1.2 By becoming a Member, you agree that MSP may share with other parties
both aggregate information and limited individual information gathered by
MSP in the course of your continuing individual use of MSN. &quot;Aggregate
information&quot; is information that describes the habits, usage patterns
and/or demographics of Members as a group but does not describe or reveal
the identity of any particular Member. &quot;Individual information&quot;
is information about a Member that is presented in a form distinguishable
from information relating to other Members but not in a form that personally
identifies any Member or enables the recipient to communicate directly with
any Member. You also agree that MSP may share and/or use locator information
as provided in Section 1.3. &quot;Locator information&quot; consists of
a Member's name, email address, physical address and/or other data about
the Member that enables the recipient to personally identify the Member.
<A NAME="one_three"></A><BR>
<BR>
1.3 MSP may provide locator information for a Member in the following instances:
first, if the Member orders goods or services on MSN from an independent
content provider (&quot;ICP&quot;), MSP may provide locator information
to the ICP relating to the Member who places the order. Second, although
MSP will not disclose locator information directly to an ICP except in relation
to an order of goods or services, if, based on limited individual information,
an ICP has identified a group of Members to whom it wishes to make a special
offer or communication, MSP may use locator information to forward such
offer or communication via MSN to those Members. Third, MSP may provide
locator information to Microsoft so that Microsoft may notify Members directly
of special offers and communications regarding Microsoft products. <A NAME=
"one_four"></A><BR>
<BR>
1.4 If you do not wish to receive any special offers or communications from
MSP on behalf of ICPs, or directly from Microsoft, check the &quot;opt out&quot;
box that appears during MSN sign-up. If you do not check the &quot;opt out&quot;
box when you sign up as a Member, but wish to do so after you join, you
may access the &quot;opt out&quot; box through an e-form available in the
&quot;Member Assistance&quot; area of MSN. However, a subsequent change
of the &quot;opt out&quot; election will not affect your receipt of offers
and communications from MSP (on behalf of ICPs) or Microsoft that are processed
before you notify MSP that you have changed your &quot;opt out&quot; election.
<A NAME="one_five"></A><BR>
<BR>
1.5 Locator information and individual information will be processed and
stored by MSP in the United States and, if you do not live in the United
States, possibly in your country of residence. You may contact MSP to determine
whether such information has been accurately recorded and, if not, to request
correction of any inaccuracies in the information recorded by MSP.
<H3>2. MSN Usage.</H3>
2.1 You may send and receive electronic mail (&quot;Email&quot;), engage
in conferences and chats, download and upload files and otherwise use MSN
as permitted by this Agreement, MSN's policies and applicable law. Files
that you upload and your activity in conferences and chats are subject to
review, modification and deletion without notice by the forum manager responsible
for the area where your uploading or other activity takes place (or by an
individual designated by the forum manager for such purpose). MSN policies
relating to online conduct, storage and deletion of Email and uploaded files,
conferences, bulletin boards (&quot;BBSs&quot;) and other matters are available
online. MSP reserves the right in its sole discretion to change MSN's policies
at any time. Files uploaded to a BBS may be subject to posted limitations
on usage, reproduction and/or dissemination, and you are responsible for
adhering to such limitations if you download them.<BR>
<BR>
2.2 You are responsible for your communications via MSN. You may not, under
any circumstances, do any of the following: (a) publish, post, distribute
or disseminate defamatory, infringing, obscene or other unlawful material
or information via MSN; (b) use MSN to threaten, harass, stalk, abuse, or
otherwise violate the legal rights (including rights of privacy and publicity)
of others; (c) intercept or attempt to intercept Email; (d) upload files
that contain software or other material protected by intellectual property
laws (or by rights of privacy or publicity) unless you own or control the
rights thereto or have received all necessary consents; (e) upload files
that contain a virus or corrupted data; (f) delete any author attributions,
legal notices or proprietary designations or labels in a file that you upload
to a BBS; (g) falsify the source or origin of software or other material
contained in a file that you upload to a BBS; (h) use MSN in a manner that
adversely affects the availability of its resources to other Members; (i)
send Email to Members for any purpose other than personal communication,
including to advertise or offer to sell goods or services to other Members
(except as otherwise expressly permitted by MSP); (j) download a file that
you know (or reasonably should know) cannot be legally distributed via MSN
(a file may have been uploaded notwithstanding such illegality); or (k)
act, or fail to act, in your use of MSN, in a manner that is contrary to
applicable law or regulation. Your failure to observe any of the foregoing
limitations may result in civil or criminal liability, as well as termination
of your membership.<BR>
<BR>
2.3 You agree to (a) maintain all equipment required for your access to
and use of MSN; (b) maintain the security of your Member identification,
password and other confidential information relating to your MSN account;
and (c) be responsible for all charges resulting from use of your MSN account,
including unauthorized use prior to your notifying MSP of such use and taking
steps to prevent its further occurrence by changing your password. Information
on how to protect the security of your MSN account (including changing your
password) is available online.<BR>
<BR>
2.4 Either you or MSP may terminate your MSN membership at any time, with
or without cause, upon notice. MSP also reserves the right to terminate
or suspend your MSN membership without prior notice, but MSP will confirm
such termination or suspension by subsequent notice.
<H3>3. Operation.</H3>
MSP reserves complete and sole discretion with respect to the operation
of MSN. MSP may, among other things: (a) monitor conferences and chats and
authorize restrictions on access thereto; (b) delete Email if it has not
been accessed by a Member within the time established by MSP's policies;
(c) subject to Section 1, make available to third parties information relating
to MSN and Members; and (d) withdraw, suspend or discontinue any functionality
or feature of MSN. MSP will not distribute uploaded files outside MSN without
the uploading member's consent but may include information about them in
promotional materials and may make such information available to third parties
for promotional purposes and you agree that files that you have uploaded
to MSN may be used in such manner and for such purposes. MSP will not review
or monitor the contents of Email except as required or allowed by applicable
law or legal process. 
<H3>4. Member Representations.</H3>
You represent and warrant that you are at least 18 years of age and that
you possess the legal right and ability to enter into this Agreement and
to use MSN in accordance with this Agreement. You agree to be financially
responsible for your use of MSN (as well as for use of your account by others,
including minors living with you) and to comply with your responsibilities
and obligations as stated in this Agreement.
<H3>5. Content.</H3>
MSP and Microsoft do not endorse or stand behind the accuracy, truthfulness
or reliability of any information (including statements of opinion or advice)
provided on or by means of MSN, other than information provided by authorized
MSP spokespersons. Statements made in forums, conferences and chats reflect
only the views of their authors. Neither forum managers nor ICPs are authorized
MSP spokespersons, and their views do not necessarily reflect those of MSP
or Microsoft. Advice received via MSN should not be relied upon for important
personal or financial decisions and you should consult an appropriate professional
for specific advice tailored to your situation.
<H3>6. MSN Independent Content Providers.</H3>
Third parties that independently provide content and offer services on MSN
are referred to herein as ICPs. Services provided by an ICP may be subject
to additional charges, terms and conditions as it so determines. You agree
to review any such additional charges, terms and conditions before using
such services and that your use constitutes your acceptance thereof. You
acknowledge that MSP may provide billing and collection services for certain
online transactions, but that MSP is not a party to any transaction involving
you and an ICP. You also agree that MSP and Microsoft are not liable for
any costs or damages arising out of any dispute between you and an ICP with
respect to your use of its service(s) or purchase of its product(s). This
Agreement is for the benefit of ICPs, as well as MSP and Microsoft, and
they have the right to assert and enforce its provisions directly on their
own behalf.
<H3>7. Ownership.</H3>
All programs, services, processes, designs, software, technologies, trademarks,
tradenames, inventions and materials comprising MSN, and all services offered
by ICPs, are wholly owned by MSP or Microsoft and such ICPs, respectively.
MSP has a compilation copyright in MSN but does not possess, claim ownership
of or exert control over individual uploaded files or the intellectual property
contained therein. By uploading a file to a forum, you grant the forum manager
for the forum the right to reproduce and distribute all information, software
and other materials in the file. The forum manager may check uploaded files
for viruses and may remove an uploaded file (in his or her sole discretion)
upon determining that the file is inappropriate for the forum. The forum
manager will notify you if a file that you have uploaded is removed. As
between MSP, ICPs and you, you retain at all times full legal responsibility
for software and other material contained in files which you upload to a
forum.
<H3>8. No Warranties and Limitation of Liability. </H3>
8.1 MSN AND ALL MSN SOFTWARE AND SERVICES ARE PROVIDED &quot;AS IS,&quot;
AND MSP AND MICROSOFT MAKE NO EXPRESS OR IMPLIED REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES
TO YOU REGARDING THE USABILITY, CONDITION OR OPERATION THEREOF. MSP AND
MICROSOFT MAKE NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES REGARDING GOODS OR SERVICES
PROVIDED BY ICPS. MSP AND MICROSOFT DO NOT WARRANT THAT ACCESS TO OR USE
OF MSN WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE, OR THAT MSN OR MSN SOFTWARE
OR SERVICES WILL MEET ANY PARTICULAR CRITERIA OF PERFORMANCE OR QUALITY.
MSP AND MICROSOFT EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING WITHOUT
LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, TITLE, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, COMPATABILITY, SECURITY OR ACCURACY.<BR>
<BR>
8.2 YOUR USE OF MSN AND ALL MSN SOFTWARE AND SERVICES IS AT YOUR OWN RISK.
YOU ASSUME FULL RESPONSIBILITY AND RISK OF LOSS RESULTING FROM YOUR DOWNLOADING
AND/OR USE OF FILES OR OTHER MATERIAL (INCLUDING MSN SOFTWARE) OBTAINED
THROUGH MSN. YOU AGREE THAT MSP, MICROSOFT AND PROVIDERS OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS
AND NETWORK SERVICES FOR MSN WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR DAMAGES (INCLUDING CONSEQUENTIAL
OR SPECIAL DAMAGES) ARISING OUT OF YOUR USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE MSN OR
ANY MSN SOFTWARE OR SERVICES, OR THE ACTIONS OR INACTIONS OF ICPS OR THE
GOODS OR SERVICES THEY PROVIDE, AND YOU HEREBY WAIVE ANY CLAIMS WITH RESPECT
THERETO, WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACTUAL, TORT OR OTHER GROUNDS, EVEN IF MSP
OR MICROSOFT HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF DAMAGES. MSP'S AND MICROSOFT'S
LIABILITY TO YOU FOR BREACH OF THIS AGREEMENT IS LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT ACTUALLY
PAID BY YOU FOR ACCESS TO AND USE OF MSN, EXCLUSIVE OF PAYMENTS RELATING
TO GOODS AND SERVICES PURCHASED FROM ICPS. YOU HEREBY RELEASE MSP AND MICROSOFT
FROM ANY AND ALL OBLIGATIONS, LIABILITIES AND CLAIMS IN EXCESS OF THIS LIMITATION.
SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW IMPLIED WARRANTIES TO BE EXCLUDED OR MODIFIED
OR LIABILITY TO BE LIMITED, SO NOT ALL OF THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS MAY APPLY
TO YOU.
<H3>9. Charges</H3>
9.1 You agree to pay all charges for your use of MSN at the prices then
in effect for your country of residence. All charges will be exclusive of
value added (&quot;VAT&quot;), sales or other taxes. MSP reserves the right
to change prices or institute new charges for access to or use of MSN at
any time upon not less than thirty (30) days' notice to Members. All changes
will be posted online, and you are responsible for reviewing pricing information
posted on MSN regularly to obtain timely notice of such changes. Continued
use of MSN or non-termination of your membership after changes are posted
constitutes your acceptance of the prices as modified by the posted changes.
Your MSN account balance may include charges incurred for your purchase
of goods and services offered by ICPs. The payment terms applicable to such
charges are as stated herein unless you are otherwise notified by MSP or
the ICP from which you purchased such goods or services. You must pay all
taxes due as a result of your use of MSN, including taxes on your purchase
of goods and services from ICPs. VAT, sales and other applicable taxes charged
will be included in the total charges listed on your online statement of
MSN charges, as described in Section 10.1.<BR>
<BR>
9.2 Payment of your MSN account balance is due monthly and, unless you have
a qualified business account, must be made by the credit or debit card designated
by you for MSN use and transactions. If your MSN account is a qualified
business account and is approved by MSP for corporate billing, charges will
be accumulated, identified by Member identification number and invoiced
on a monthly basis. <BR>
<BR>
9.3 Charges are to be paid on a monthly basis in the currency in which billed.
If the payment method for your MSN account is by credit or debit card and
payment is not received by MSP from the card issuer or its agents, you agree
to pay all amounts due upon demand by MSP. Each time you use MSN, you agree
and reaffirm that MSP is authorized to charge your designated card. Your
card issuer's agreement governs your use of your designated card in connection
with MSN, and you must refer to such agreement (not this Agreement) with
respect to your rights and liabilities as a cardholder. You agree that MSP
may (at its option) accumulate charges incurred during your monthly billing
cycle and submit them as one or more aggregate charges during or at the
end of each cycle, and that MSP may delay obtaining authorization from your
card issuer until submission of the accumulated charge(s). This means that
accumulated charges may appear on the statement you receive from your card
issuer. You agree that if you want to see the components of accumulated
charges, you will review your online statement of MSN charges, as described
in Section 10.1. <BR>
<BR>
9.4 Your MSN membership fee is payable in advance and is non- refundable.
You agree that MSP may submit charges for your membership fee each month
without further authorization from you, until you provide prior notice that
you have terminated this authorization or wish to change your designated
card. Such notice will not affect charges submitted before MSP reasonably
could act on your notice.<BR>
<BR>
9.5 You must promptly notify MSP of changes to: (a) the account number or
expiration date of your designated card; (b) your billing address; and (c)
the name of each minor whom you have authorized to use your MSN account.
You must also promptly notify MSP if your card is canceled (e.g., for loss
or theft) or if you become aware of a potential breach of security, such
as the unauthorized disclosure or use of your Member identification or password.<BR>
<BR>
9.6 YOU WILL INCUR CHARGES IN ADDITION TO THE MINIMUM MONTHLY CHARGE IF
YOUR USAGE OF MSN EXCEEDS THE NUMBER OF HOURS COVERED BY THE MINIMUM CHARGE.
IF YOU ARE USING MSN FROM CERTAIN LOCATIONS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, YOU
MAY ALSO INCUR CHARGES LEVIED BY YOUR LONG DISTANCE CARRIER TO ACCESS MSN.
IF MSP UPGRADES THE SOFTWARE USED FOR MEMBERS' ACCESS TO MSN (OR TO ANY
PARTICULAR FEATURE OF MSN), MSP MAY CAUSE UPGRADED SOFTWARE TO BE DOWNLOADED
AUTOMATICALLY TO YOUR MACHINE, IN WHICH EVENT YOU WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR
ALL RESULTING CONNECT TIME CHARGES IN EXCESS OF THE TIME COVERED BY THE
MINIMUM MONTHLY CHARGE.
<H3>10. Statements and Payment. </H3>
10.1 MSP will provide you with an online statement of charges on your MSN
account approximately as and when such charges are incurred and/or paid.
Unless you notify MSP of any discrepancies or irregularities within seventy-
five (75) days after they first appear in your online account statement,
they will be deemed accepted by you for all purposes, including resolution
of inquiries made by your card issuer. YOU RELEASE MSP AND ALL ICPS FROM
ALL LIABILITY AND CLAIM OF LOSS RESULTING FROM ANY ERROR OR DISCREPANCY
THAT IS NOT REPORTED TO MSP WITHIN SEVENTY-FIVE (75) DAYS OF ITS PUBLICATION
DATE.<BR>
<BR>
10.2 MSP reserves the right to suspend or terminate your MSN membership
without notice upon rejection of any card charges or if your card issuer
(or its agent or affiliate) seeks return of payments previously made to
MSP when MSP believes you are liable for the charge. Such rights are in
addition to and not in lieu of any other legal rights or remedies available
to MSP. You agree to pay a late charge on all amounts due but not timely
paid and which remain unpaid for thirty (30) days after being billed. The
late charge will equal one and one-half percent (1 1/2%) of the past due
amount per month until paid or, if such rate is in excess of the allowable
rate, the maximum rate allowed by law. MSP reserves the right to refer your
MSN account to a third party for collection in the event of ongoing default.
<H3>11. Assignment; Household Use; Minors.</H3>
Your MSN membership is personal. Subject only to this Section 11, you agree
not to assign, transfer or sublicense your rights as a Member. You may allow
other members of your household to use your MSN account, provided that you
hereby agree to pay all charges that they incur and to be responsible for
all other aspects of their usage. You acknowledge that you are aware that
some areas of MSN may contain material that is unsuitable for minors, and
you agree to supervise usage by minors whom you permit to use your MSN account.
<H3>12. Indemnification.</H3>
You agree to indemnify MSP and Microsoft from and against any and all liabilities,
expenses (including attorneys' fees) and damages arising out of claims based
upon use of your MSN account, including any claim of libel, defamation,
violation of rights of privacy or publicity, loss of service by other Members
and infringement of intellectual property or other rights. MSP will notify
you promptly of any claim for which MSP or Microsoft seeks indemnification
and will afford you the opportunity to participate in the defense of such
claim, provided that your participation will not be conducted in a manner
prejudicial to MSP's or Microsoft's interests, as reasonably determined
by MSP or Microsoft.
<H3>13. Notices; Consent.</H3>
Notices given by MSP to you will be given by Email via MSN, or by a general
posting on MSN, or by conventional mail. In any matter requiring MSP's prior
consent, such consent will be considered given only if made by in the foregoing
manner by an authorized representative of MSP. Notices given by you to MSP
must be given by Email via MSN and addressed as set forth in MSN's &quot;Member
Assistance&quot; area, or by conventional mail. Notices to MSN by conventional
mail must be sent to The Microsoft Network, Attention: Member Services,
One Microsoft Way, Redmond, WA 98052-6399, USA.
<H3>14. Effective Date; Changes to Terms.</H3>
This Agreement takes effect on the date on which you first use MSN and continues
until your MSN membership is terminated either by you or by MSP. MSP RESERVES
THE RIGHT TO CHANGE THIS AGREEMENT AT ANY TIME BY POSTING CHANGES ONLINE.
YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR REVIEWING REGULARLY INFORMATION POSTED ONLINE IN
THE &quot;MEMBER ASSISTANCE&quot; AREA TO OBTAIN TIMELY NOTICE OF SUCH CHANGES.
YOUR NON-TERMINATION OR CONTINUED USE OF MSN AFTER CHANGES ARE POSTED CONSTITUTES
YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT AS MODIFIED BY THE POSTED CHANGES.
<H3>15. General.</H3>
15.1 This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of Washington,
USA, and you consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of courts in
King County, Washington in all disputes arising out of or relating to your
use of MSN or your MSN membership.<BR>
<BR>
15.2 You acknowledge that no joint venture, partnership, employment, or
agency relationship exists between you and MSP, or between you and Microsoft,
as a result of your use of MSN or your MSN membership. You agree not to
hold yourself out as a representative, agent or employee of MSP or Microsoft,
and that neither MSP nor Microsoft will be liable by reason of any representation,
act or omission to act by you.<BR>
<BR>
15.3 MSP's performance under this Agreement is subject at all times to existing
laws and legal process and nothing contained in this Agreement is in derogation
of MSP's right to comply with law enforcement requests or requirements relating
to a Member's use of MSN or information provided to or gathered by MSP with
respect to such use. <BR>
<BR>
15.4 This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between MSP, Microsoft
and you with respect to your use of MSN and your MSN membership, and it
supersedes all prior or contemporaneous communications and proposals, whether
oral or written, between MSP or Microsoft and you with respect thereto.<BR>

<H3>Introduction</H3>
Thanks for joining us. We're pleased that you're part of our worldwide online
community. <BR>
<BR>
MSN The Microsoft Network, enables you to communicate with thousands of
other members around the world. You'll find a wide range of topics to talk
about, subjects to share, and new experiences. Our goal is to create an
atmosphere that encourages intelligent interaction and lively debate. Following
these guidelines will help MSN members have a positive online experience.
<H3>MSN Forums</H3>
Our forums consist of bulletin boards, chat rooms and conferences, and file
libraries. Forums are the place to share your views and interests with large
groups of members. There is a wide array of subjects available, reflecting
members' diverse interests. We encourage the exchange of viewpoints and
information, which is vital to making MSN lively and interesting.<BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Forum Manager<BR>
</STRONG>The activities in each forum are guided by a forum manager. The
forum manager sets the tone for the forum and might establish guidelines
that are unique to a particular forum. The forum manager might also schedule
conferences, manage the file library, and organize and respond to bulletin
board messages. From time to time, the forum manager will check files and
messages to ensure that they are in keeping with the forum topic and MSN
policies. Forum managers also respond to inquiries from members interested
in the forum.<BR>
Note: If you want to apply to MSN to become a forum manager or provide other
services to members, look in the InfoCenter of the category you are interested
in for the name of the person to contact.<BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Bulletin Boards (BBS) and File Libraries</STRONG><BR>
Bulletin board messages are public notices that the entire online community
can view. They are the platform for ideas and opinions, discussion and debate,
with information for everyone to share. Bulletin board messages are displayed
for a period of time set by the forum manager.<BR>
<BR>
Some MSN bulletin boards serve as large libraries of files that you can
download. These files are available as attachments to bulletin board messages.
Certain files might be offered to members as shareware. In some areas, there
is a charge for downloading a file. Please be sure to check whether there
are separate charges associated with a particular file. Look up File Libraries
in the MSN Help Index to learn how to view, read about, and download files.<BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Chat Rooms</STRONG><BR>
Forum chat rooms offer participation in live, real-time conversations related
to the forum topic. A forum might have several chat rooms active at one
time. Chat is not moderated, but either a forum manager or an experienced
member will move in and out of chat rooms to keep the conversations on topic
and free of disruptions.<BR>
<BR>
MSN forums feature special scheduled chat events open to all members. These
special events are arranged and moderated by a host, usually the forum manager.
Special chat events let MSN members meet prominent figures from public life,
the arts, sciences, popular culture, and, of course, computing.<BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>A Note About Adult Content</STRONG><BR>
Certain areas of MSN offer content for members who are at least 18 years
of age. Such content might appear in forums and will also be available over
adult Usenet newsgroups. Usenet is a public network that is not part of
MSN. It consists of several thousand online groups that discuss and debate
topics with varying degrees of focus.<BR>
<BR>
When you first join MSN, you will not have access to adult content. To request
access to adult content that is part of MSN or from Usenet newsgroups:
<BLOCKQUOTE>1) Double-click the service you would like to open.<BR>
2) Follow the directions and complete the e-form requesting access.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H3>E-mail</H3>
Electronic mail (or e-mail) permits direct communication between MSN members
and: 
<UL>
<LI>MSN merchants and advertisers. 
<LI>Members of other online services over the Internet. 
<LI>People connected to the Internet. 
</UL>
E-mail is sent to the addressee and does not appear publicly. MSN will make
every effort to keep members' e-mail private while it is under MSN control;
sending e-mail over the Internet involves networks that are not part of
MSN and might not be as secure.<BR>
<BR>
MSN will not intercept, attempt to intercept, open or attempt to open e-mail
without authorization from the sender or recipient. On rare occasions, MSN
might be required by legal process to disclose the contents of e-mail in
connection with an investigation of alleged illegal activity. <BR>
<BR>
New, unread e-mail is retained online for 45 days. Usually when you read
your MSN e-mail, it is moved from The Microsoft Network to your computer,
where it remains as long as you retain it. However, you can choose instead
to preview your e-mail. In this case, you transfer a copy of your e-mail
to your computer and leave the original on MSN, where it remains for 15
days. The length of time e-mail remains on MSN is subject to change as network
conditions require.<BR>
<BR>
For a detailed description of e-mail reading options, look up E-mail messages
in the MSN Help Index.
<H3>Transferring Files</H3>
The MSN Member Agreement contains full and specific information about permitted
file transfer activity. In brief, you may not: 
<UL>
<LI>Transfer files that contain software or other material protected by
intellectual property laws (or by privacy or publicity rights) over MSN,
unless you own or control the rights to do so or have received all necessary
consents; 
<LI>Transfer files that you know contain a virus or corrupted data over
MSN; 
<LI>Delete any author attribution, copyright notice, or proprietary designation
or label from a file you transfer over MSN; 
<LI>Falsify the source or origin of software in any file you transfer over
MSN; or 
<LI>Transfer a file that you know or have reason to believe cannot be legally
offered by the party distributing it over MSN. 
</UL>
Before downloading a file, look closely at its description to determine
whether it is what you want. Be sure to check every file you download for
viruses or corrupted data before you open the file, regardless of the source.
Neither the forum manager nor MSN is responsible for any difference between
what you download and what you expected to get, or for the results of downloading
any file.<BR>
<BR>
Please let the forum manager know if you believe there is a problem with
files you download. A forum manager can remove files whose content, origin,
or ownership violates the terms of the Member Agreement, or that are not
in the appropriate forum.
<H3>Solicitation and Advertising</H3>
MSN provides a variety of forums where members can share information that
is relevant to their businesses, careers, or avocations. However, you may
not use MSN for solicitation or advertising.<BR>
<BR>
To protect members from receiving unwanted &quot;clutter&quot; on MSN, you
may not use forums or e-mail to advertise, solicit, promote the purchase
of goods or services, or to operate or engage in surveys, contests, chain
letters or commercial enterprises, without the express permission of MSN.
This does not include the sale of personal items, which may be allowed in
designated areas.<BR>
<BR>
If you are aware of such content, please tell us by contacting the forum
manager or Member Support.<BR>
<H3>Courtesy</H3>
MSN is committed to the value of free expression. We encourage lively discussion
and spirited debate. Our membership is international and diverse, so you
will be communicating with people of different backgrounds, beliefs, and
biases.<BR>
<BR>
To create a community that is enjoyable for all members, please treat others
with courtesy and respect when online and when communicating by e-mail.
Be aware that you'll encounter a wide range of opinions and ideas.<BR>
<BR>
Keep it clean -- avoid language that is vulgar or obscene, even if masked
by symbols or other characters. Any material that is grossly offensive to
the online community, including obscene or pornographic material, will not
be tolerated.<BR>
<BR>
Remember that other members see only the words you type. They cannot hear
your tone of voice or see your expression; your words alone represent you.
While spelling need not be precise, typing in all capital letters is considered
shouting online, and should be used sparingly or avoided altogether.<BR>
<BR>
Don't disrupt other members' enjoyment of a forum. Members who repeatedly
interrupt conversations, or deliberately antagonize or harass others, will
be asked to leave.<BR>
<BR>
Post messages to the appropriate forums, and try to avoid unnecessary or
repetitive posts. To understand the topic and purpose of discussions and
forum activities, spend a little time following discussions before you participate.
Contact the forum manager if you have questions; the forum manager's name
appears in the About... information in the forum.<A NAME="identity"></A>
<H3>Responsibility and Liability</H3>
Respect the privacy of others. Don't make statements that are false or hurtful
to others, including persons who are not online. <BR>
<BR>
Your member ID is the &quot;screen name&quot; that identifies you online.
Other members will see your ID when you post BBS messages or chat with them
online. You can choose your ID based on your real name, or a nickname, or
you can make something up. Once you make your choice during MSN sign-up,
your ID stays the same unless it is modified. If you would like to modify
your ID, please contact Member Support.<BR>
<BR>
Keep in mind that when you choose your ID and provide information about
yourself, you may not impersonate or represent yourself as any other person
or entity. Of course, you may not represent yourself as an employee or representative
of MSN under any circumstances. Do not choose an ID which is designed to
be an advertisement of a product or service. Also, in the unlikely event
that you have selected an ID that is already in use, or is reserved for
use by an MSN content provider or advertiser (because it is a product brand
or trade name), you will be asked to choose a different screen name.<BR>
<BR>
Be careful when asked to provide personal or confidential information while
online. Do not give information about your credit card (including account
number or expiration date) in response to e-mail requests that you receive
from people you do not know. Such requests may be fraudulent. This type
of information will only be requested by MSN staff or a content provider
by means of an encrypted eform. If you see any suspicious communications
by anyone who appears to be deceiving members into believing that they are
authorized by MSN or a content provider to receive such information, please
contact Member Support.<BR>
<BR>
Please remember that you can be held legally liable for what you say on
any forum or in e-mail. For example, you can be held accountable for defamatory
comments, threats, and statements that are illegal or fraudulent. MSN is
available in many countries worldwide. Laws vary throughout the world. Remarks
and behavior that are protected in one country might not be protected in
another. MSN might refer certain comments -- for example, threats of harm
to people or property -- to law enforcement authorities. This applies even
to comments that are made in jest.<BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Advice and Opinion</STRONG><BR>
One advantage of joining an online community is the ability to share information
informally with others. If you have expert knowledge or more online experience,
feel free to offer answers and help to other MSN members. However, when
you receive online advice, keep in mind that its quality and accuracy can
vary widely. This can be particularly true for opinions about law, investments,
and health.<BR>
<BR>
Carefully evaluate advice you receive from any unknown or unfamiliar source.
Check sources, background, and motivation. Find out if the information is
provided by an individual who has a business or financial interest in a
related product or service. When in doubt, consult a qualified professional.<BR>
<BR>
MSN is not responsible for the accuracy or truthfulness of advice or information
provided online and is not responsible for the consequences of acting on
such information.
<H3>Compliance</H3>
Our guidelines are based on common sense and courtesy. If you have questions
about them, please contact our forum managers or Member Support.<BR>
<BR>
Members who fail to respect our general guidelines or the particular guidelines
for any individual forum, might receive returned bulletin board messages,
one or more warnings, temporary suspension from a forum, permanent exclusion
from a forum, and/or termination of their MSN membership.<BR>
<BR>
A serious breach or a pattern of disruptive behavior might result in immediate
suspension from a forum or termination of your membership.<BR>
<BR>
MSN reserves the right to remove any material from the service at any time
and for any reason. 
<H3>Membership Terms</H3>
The MSN Member Agreement, which you accepted when you joined, contains full
and specific information about the terms and conditions of your membership.

or Folders. <BR>
2) In the Named box, type legalagr.rtf.<BR>

in MSN Central to find out about updates and changes, and to get important
notices about your MSN membership.
<H3>MSN and Children</H3>
MSN welcomes parents and children. Online services offer unique educational
opportunities plus the chance to meet new and interesting people. But please
keep in mind that an online service cannot offer the degree of control over
content and interaction that parents provide. <BR>
<BR>
We encourage parents to remain closely involved in their children's activities
online. Although you must be at least 18 to join MSN, parents might wish
to allow their children to use the service with supervision. In the online
world, children will meet people and make friends on bulletin boards and
by e-mail. As a parent, please exercise the same judgment and control over
online meetings as you would in the real world where your son or daughter
comes in contact with strangers. Be aware of people your child meets or
writes to, and of whatever offline contacts might result from online communication.<BR>
<BR>
Before you allow your child to use the service alone, become familiar with
what we offer. There is much to see, but there might be areas you want your
child to avoid. Also, there might be areas that carry charges not included
in your monthly membership or trial plan. Please be aware of how your child
uses the service; ultimately, you are responsible for all the time you and
your child spend online.<BR>
<BR>
Our favorite places feature is an excellent way to create an inventory of
places you'd like your child to visit. For information, see Help.
<H3>Stay in Touch</H3>
We always welcome your feedback and input. By letting us know what you think,
you can help make MSN more dynamic, fun, and enjoyable to use.
