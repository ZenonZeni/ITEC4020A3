INSTITUTE FOR THE AMERICAN URBAN LANDSCAPE RE-MAPS ST. PAUL

By:
Aaron Betsky

(St. Paul)
``Our infrastructure is our new social covenant,'' says urban designer Bill
Morrish. After years of mapping his home territory of Minneapolis-St. Paul,
he is proving his point with an ambitious plan for the revitalization of
St. Paul. The Institute for the American Urban Landscape, directed by
Morrish and his wife, Catherine Brown, at the School of Architecture of the
University of Minnesota, has created a blueprint for the city that will use
its natural location to attract new businesses, industry, culture, and
inhabitants. Now, with the help of Toronto-based planner Ken Greenberg, the
city is implementing many of the Institute's plans. ``Every city needs a
sense of a whole, how things connect to create a community,'' says Mayor
Ken Coleman, ``and Catherine and Bill have provided that.''

Morrish and Brown start their investigations with the land itself.
Specifically, the focus on watersheds, not only because they believe
development patterns follow the rivers, knotting together around crossings,
portages, or ports, but also because the flow of water maps aspects of the
geography that otherwise might not be noticed. In the Minne-
apolis-St. Paul area, the city established itself at the last navigable
point of the Mississippi. Neighborhoods developed first on bluffs, and then
by tracing the alluvial fans of creeks draining into the river. The flood
plains were taken over by industry, and cuts in the bluffs became corridors
for trains and, later, cars and trucks.

The first task of any urban design, Brown and Morrish point out, is to
rediscover and re-use these patterns on an urban scale. Thus as the
``industrial glacier'' that traced the flood plains created by the real
glaciers recedes, they want to turn the resulting flat plains into
combinations of ``clean'' industrial parks and green zones, allowing the
natural hydrology of the area to shape the development. The natural routes
along the bluffs, which birds trace in their flight pattern overhead, were
already converted into a system of parkways according to a 1917 plan by
William Bennett, and Brown and Morrish want to finish its missing links.

The problem for downtown St. Paul is its immediate relation to the river.
As in many other cities, highway development in the 1960s cut off the city
from its shore. Thus, cars replaced boats along the river corridor, and
tiered parking garages badly mimicked the bluffs. To Greenberg, this
situation becomes an excuse for an ``urban terrace'' such as the ones in
Quebec City or Brooklyn Heights. In the future, landscaped stairs and
escalators will connect a series of new cultural institutions, such as a
Science Museum currently under construction, to a river front where a
$500-million flood-control project has created new walkways and park areas.
He then envisions retractable canopies over these public spaces to replace
the ubiquitous and isolating skywalk system. A renovation of Wabasha
Avenue, currently underway, will link the State Capitol through downtown to
a thriving Hispanic community on the opposite bank of the river. ``What we
do is to connect buildings. Instead of the cult of the isolated project, we
link neighborhoods,'' Greenberg explains.

Though some of these projects resemble traditional urban-planning
solutions, Brown and Morrish point out that they are part of a larger
reading of the region. They think it is not just a question of revitalizing
downtown or creating parks, but of figuring out what to do with the ``mushy
context'' of the concentric rings of suburbs the city is producing out in
the prairie. In the Institute's newsletter and the group's consulting work,
they have proposed ways that all of these communities could be linked both
to one another and to the natural terrain to foster a sense of reality.
``The first thing you need,'' says Morrish, ``is a common language. It's
not as much about land use as it is about reading the land.'' By focusing
on ``topography, not typology,'' they hope to ``inflect social and
geographic systems to make them work better together.''

In St. Paul, this means creating maps of the city that have made it legible
to the various neighborhoods and pressure groups that shape the political
landscape. ``The main thing they have achieved,'' says Patrick Seeb,
executive director of the non-profit St. Paul Riverfront Corporation, ``is
to let people see the vitality of St. Paul. Their maps act as catalysts
that bring people `around the table' who weren't there.'' The result is a
plan of connections rather than isolated development schemes.

``They lay out the environment,'' says Mayor Coleman, ``and then we can
market that.'' St. Paul, he hopes, will emerge out of Minneapolis' shadow
to become a ``big small town'' embedded in a network of small towns
connected by the river and its watershed. Out of that fertile plain will
come rational development and a better place to live. As the Mayor puts it:
``Cities are places people have in common.''

BLOODY SUNSET: HOUSING TAX CREDITS HEAD FOR OBLIVION, UNLESS--

By:
Stephen A. Kliment

One of the more bizarre dramas to hit the political scene in years is
playing itself out at this writing in Washington, D.C. Chairman Bill Archer
of the House Ways and Means Committee, miffed at a proposal by Democrats in
the last Congress to give permanent status to the Low Income Housing Tax
Credit (LIHTC) program--it's a part of the 1986 Tax Reform Act--but to deny
it to a parallel R&D program, persuaded both the House and a joint
Senate-House conference committee to sunset the program after 1997.
Sunsetting is a term that has emerged in recent years to ensure that
programs no longer deemed viable are ended. Currently the LIHTC program is
subject to year-to-year funding, an inefficient process that defies
long-term planning.

In this case, there's a tragedy in the making. LIHTC is the only existing
housing support program to have made a dent in the dire shortage of housing
for low-income families. Producing over 100,000 units a year, it is the
largest driver of new and renovated low- and moderate-income housing in the
nation, pouring some $320 million a year into state-administered programs.
It provides 20 per cent of all multi-family housing, revitalizes
communities by involving them in the planning process, creates
opportunities for architects, provides construction jobs, and generates new
businesses in the community. And it's virtually the only game in town. (See
this month's Building Types Study on affordable housing, beginning on page
86).

It works like this. To build housing at below-market cost, developers need
to borrow capital at an affordable rate. Investors provide the capital,
receive tax credits under the program for 10 years on any profits they
make, and write-offs for passive real estate losses for another five,
promising them a tidy return over the 15 years, after which they can sell
the housing. The reduced costs are passed on to the tenant families in the
form of lower rents.

The idea of a housing safety net provided by government has gone though a
range of scenarios since it was launched in the 1930s, tacking past the
tricky political shoals pitting social sensitivity against rugged
self-reliance, homeownership against rent support, project-based support
against tenant-based support. The scenario for the 1990s is the tax-credit
that motivates investors to help provide housing at affordable rents.

Architects have both a business interest and a social interest in
preserving the pro-gram. Without getting into the recondite byways of
federal legislation, the bottom line is that the program, to receive funds,
needs to get into an approved ``reconciliation bill,'' an instrument that
matches expenditures and tax provisions against budgets. That's the
challenge now on the table. Both political parties by and large agree that
it's the most efficient, productive program at work. Everyone gains--the
community, the family, the investor, and the construction industry.

As AIA's director of federal legislative affairs, Al Eisenberg, told
RECORD, ``There's no reason for this program to be in jeopardy.'' Let's
keep it alive.

THE MARKET'S BUYING GREEN
Environmental Home Programs showcasing energy-efficiency and
ecological-design strategies are sprouting all over the country.
Their success certifies green design's market appeal.

By:
By Elena Marcheso Moreno

Building green is becoming big business, particularly for the housing
industry where individual homeowners have the opportunity to make choices.
Given the vast size of the residential-building market, the potential is
staggering. In one year the energy demands of a single home release tons of
CO2 into the atmosphere, according to Elena Cotton Westbrook, an
environmental consultant in Garland, Tex. ``When you consider the capital
resources, transportation, delivery, and related systems required to
produce this much energy, you can see that reducing home-energy needs will
create significant environmental benefits across the spectrum,'' says
Westbrook, who, along with her mechanical-engineer husband, Paul Westbrook,
is building an eco-house.

Energy is just one element of ecologically sensitive design, but builders
and architects across the nation are jumping onto the bandwagon. For the
most part, these houses offer real improvement over conventionally designed
and built houses. Besides using less energy, they incorporate recycled or
re-used materials, and if not bow, at least nod to the native landscape.
It's important that significant segments of the housing industry are
promoting the premise that a sustainable society is not only possible, but
necessary. And most Americans are willing to wear the green hat of an
environmentalist if they feel they can afford it.

But it's not all about making the earth a better place. The
indoor-air-quality problems of existing construction practice are also
driving the eco-home movement. As synthetic furnishings, fabrics,
chemicals, finishes, and materials have become more prevalent, toxic
outgassing of common building materials has taken on a higher profile,
exacerbated by energy-conserving tight construction when provision of fresh
air isn't handled properly.

Models of sustainability
Sponsored by the government agencies, local non-profit groups,
manufacturers, and utilities, a number of sustainable-housing demonstration
projects are appearing around the country.

Every Canadian province has participated in the Advanced House program
being conducted in Canada by CANMET, the research and development arm of
Energy, Mines and Resources Canada. With 10 houses built to suit various
climates, the program has been recognized for its use of recycled products,
energy efficiency, and appeal to the mass suburban market. One house is
noteworthy for its treatment of construction site waste. Enermodal
Engineering Ltd., Ontario, incorporated such shop-made components as precut
roof trusses, floor joists, and I-joists for wall studs into the house it
designed and built. Many waste products--particularly plastic--were sold to
a recycler. Steve Carpenter of Enermodal says construction generated only a
trash can full of debris.

The Center for Resourceful Building Technology (CRBT) in Missoula, Mont.,
has completed its second eco-house, a tiny (965-sq-ft) urban-infill
project. This Timber Tech project was designed to be replicated. ``We chose
resource-efficient and recycled materials that are currently available to
show builders and homeowners that they can improve the resource efficiency
of their construction right now,'' says Tracy Mumma, CRBT Research
Director. Inspired by an earlier CRBT project, architect Kate S. Warner has
completed ``a traditional New England house'' in Martha's Vineyard, Mass.,
using alternate materials and energy-efficient construction (below).

The house is not a solar collector
   What does it mean to build a green house? First and foremost it means
providing more energy-efficiency. How much more depends on the builder and
the client.

Nearly all architects and builders legitimately involved in the eco-house
movement create energy-conserving homes. It is no longer difficult or
risky. People want homes that use less energy and cost less to operate.
Builders have the technology readily available--technology that has been
around since the 1970s and 1980s when passive solar was aggressively
promoted, only to be pushed aside by the public for its unconventional and
often unappealing designs.

But passive-solar strategies and their attendant energy-conservation
measures are in fact major components of any house that purports to be
environmentally sensitive. Careful attention to building orientation,
direct heat gain, daylighting, shading, and well-insulated construction all
contribute to low energy consumption. The difference now is that most
designers create houses that look like houses, not like the result of an
aerospace experiment gone wrong.

The problems that plagued early passive-solar homes--lack of fresh air and
outgassing of materials--are being conquered in today's green buildings
through the use of forced fresh-air ventilation (with heat exchangers,
where warranted) and other measures that precondition outside air.

The house of green components
   While low energy use is a critical factor, it alone does not make a
house green. Products and materials that create less environmental impact
are also called for. Everything from the use of site-lumber scrap to
shredded-plastic Coke bottles are appearing in the eco-house.

Not all products are equally green. ``The way we look at it, every
environmental product and every eco-house advertised is a different shade
of green,'' says architect Greg Franta, of ENSAR Group, Boulder, Colo. A
long-time researcher into energy conservation and environmental issues
related to buildings, Franta regularly designs green buildings. Even with
his expertise, it isn't always easy to decide if one product is better than
another. Franta, like many environmental advocates, advises a ``cradle to
cradle'' analysis of products that considers the acquisition of the raw
materials; the processing and manufacturing process; the packaging and
distribution impacts; the installation, use and maintenance issues; and the
potential for disposal, reuse, or recycling.

Unfortunately, this is still not an easy task. Though numerous voluntary
and local certification programs exist, there is yet no widely accepted
certification system, database, or standard for what makes products green
[RECORD, October 1991, pages 36-39], though the Home Energy Rating Systems
Council is working on voluntary efficiency guidelines (202/638-3700). Like
Franta, Mike Nicklas of Innovative Design, Raleigh, N.C., is an architect
who has devoted his practice to designing energy-conserving buildings. He
hired an engineer to spend two years in his office researching various
building products and materials and rate them in terms of their effect on
the environment.

``The problem with our list is that it tends to be subjective,'' Nicklas
says. ``We try to get a good picture of the total embodied energy in a new
or recycled green product. We weigh the cost compared to other options.
But, ultimately, the decision to use a product or not rests with the
client.'' While the price of a few green products is actually lower than
conventional ones, others demand a premium, and others become more
affordable as the demand for them increases, explains Nicklas. In designing
a demonstration house for Ari-zona Public Utilities, Jones Studios weighed
``the quality of support by the company--the product most likely to be
readily available in the future and have strong backing from a stable
company.''

Widely used green products

Framing: Eco-houses are moving the home-building industry quickly away from
conventional timber (much of it from endangered old-growth forests) to a
variety of framing and panel products that use more abundant wood species
and incorporate material that was once scrap. Some designers are choosing
light-gauge steel framing, which can incorporate considerable recycled
content. Both have their pluses and minuses [RECORD, September 1995, pages
36-41].

Insulation: One of the most successful products is 100-percent
recycled-newspaper cellulose insulation. Ground into a paste-like pulp, the
cellulose is blown into walls and ceiling spaces. Its manufacture is
relatively benign. Indeed, even the ink gets recycled, points out
environmental and construction technology consultant David Johnston of
What's Working, Boulder, Colo.

Expanded-polystyrene rigid-foam insulation gets high marks from green
builders and designers because it doesn't involve ozone-depleting CFCs or
even the far superior but still ozone-depleting HCFC blowing agent. [For
more on insulation, see RECORD, April 1994, pages 34-35].

Finishes: Recycled plastic bags and hardwood fibers collected from
furniture waste and chopped-up building pallets are combined in an
environmentally friendly decking material, says Johnston. In addition to
being resource efficient, it can be softened and reformed. It will outlast
lumber used in the same application by a few decades. Carpeting made from
recycled PET plastic--the type used for water, soda, and ketchup
bottles--has also met with industry-wide approval. More than 100-million
yards have been laid in buildings to date, says Johnston. ``It is more
stain-resistant than nylon and wears better.''

Perhaps the most readily embraced green building product in housing has
been low-VOC paints. When first introduced, low-VOC paints cost upwards of
$30 per gallon. But once competition entered the market, prices were driven
down. It is selling in some states for about $17 per gal. to the trade. New
no-VOC paints are just entering the market.

Alternative products are being investigated or developed by manufacturers
of almost every type of building material and finish. One of the most
encouraging aspects of the push toward greener buildings is that a num-ber
of architects are experimenting with materials development. David Hertz of
Syndesis, Santa Monica, Calif., developed Syndecrete, a cement-based
compound that uses recycled materials as its primary ingredients
(opposite).

Despite the availability of increasingly reliable green products, Johnston
says that there's too much broad-brushed, marketing-driven green-washing by
too many in the homebuilding industry. ``A lot of builders will put up a
house with only one-half air change per hour, bad or non-existent energy
conservation, and materials that outgas toxins, yet incorporate low-VOC
paint and feel justified in calling it environmentally responsive or green.
The problem for the whole industry is that home buyers often don't know
what it is they don't know.''

In response, Johnston worked with the Colorado Home Builders Association
to establish the ``Green Builders Certification'' program--one of a number
of local certification programs that have recently developed.

IAQ vs energy efficiency
   If we learned nothing else from earlier waves of environmental and
energy-conserving design, it's that an approach that simply layers green
concepts or energy conservation onto conventional techniques can have
unintended consequences. The tightness of construction brought on by 70's
energy conservation is in part blamed for the indoor-air quality problems
of the 80's. Turning from wood studs to metal, warns Jim White of the
Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, Ottawa, can cause mold growth, for
example. Writing in Environmental Building News, he claims the thermal
bridge created by a steel stud not fully enclosed by insulation can create
cold spots where high humidity from kitchens or bathrooms can condense,
encouraging mold growth within just a few months. In hot and humid regions,
mold grows within improperly designed walls when air-conditioned rooms draw
in outside air and airborne moisture condenses within the wall.

With most Americans spending up to 90 percent of their day inside their
homes or work places, a focus of eco-home design has become the condition
of the indoor environment. Rick Carter, of LBH Engineers and Architects,
Minneapolis, designed an eco-house for a client with multiple chemical
sensitivities. Although it had to be tailored to the specific clients'
sensitivities (page 014a), many of the strategies are finding their way
into the broader market.

Carter also designed the Minneapolis American Lung Association's Health
House, which is concerned with the increasing prevalence of asthma, which
it links to indoor-air quality. To eliminate pollutants, LBH minimized
materials that offgas toxics, including paint and carpet. It isolates
pollution sources by, for example, separating the garage from the house and
wrapping medium-density fiberboard in cabinets with plastic laminate. The
house is mechanically ventilated using 100-percent outside air (heat
exchangers capture heat and cooling from waste air). Still, it suffers from
its location amidst a suburban development. Original landscape plans called
for native plantings, but lost out to the developer's standard sod and
imported trees.

Looking at the bigger picture
   The limitations that Carter's site imposed are typical of the problems
many programs suffer--the inability to look at issues at a scale larger
than a single house. Yet a more holistic strategy, taking on site and
community-planning issues, is key to environmental sustainability.

One project that takes a broader view is the Arizona Public Service Company
Environmental Showcase Home in Phoenix, which was co-sponsored by EPA,
Arizona Department of Environmental Quality, and the Home Builders
Association of Central Arizona. Designed by Phoenix architect Jones Studio,
the project uses eco components like engineered wood and metal studs (on
interior walls). But it also uses shading and orientation, daylighting and
landscape concepts (previous pages).

From site planning to town planning
   Some communities are giving environmental mitigation high priority,
attempting to counteract the effects of suburban life built around the use
of the automobile. ``Pedestrian pocket'' and other traditional-development
strategies that emphasize transit use are already well known. Florida now
encourages compact development to reduce impacts on the state's endangered
Everglades. Burt Hill Kosar Rittelmann architects, Washington D.C., have
gone so far as to banish the auto in the master plan the firm developed for
DeWees Island, S.C., a private, oceanfront retreat dedicated to
environmental preservation (below and opposite).

Many Americans seek a rural lifestyle, but the typical large-lot zoning in
resort and exurban areas encourages polluting car trips and fragments the
natural landscape. Environmental advocates say such broken-up natural areas
are less ecologically viable and more vulnerable to pests.

Loudon County, Va., decided to follow the advice of architect and planner
Richard Calderon, Leesburg, Va., to help preserve the rural quality of its
community. As an alternative to its three-acre lot zoning, the county has
approved a plan that allows hamlet developments. Houses in these hamlets
can be closely clustered on less than 20 percent of the site, leaving the
rest of the land in its natural state. They also encourage a more
neighborly form of country living. So encouraging is Loudon County's
environmental policy, that several developers are constructing
eco-villages. Franta of ENSAR is designing one hamlet of environmentally
oriented houses; Bethesda, Md.-based Hillier Reed and Neal Payton,
Washington, D.C., are doing another (below) that includes
narrower-than-standard streets to slow traffic.

Defining and assessing the environmental considerations that make a house
green remain complex. The key, say Alex Wilson and Nadav Malin, editors of
Environmental Building News, is to set priorities (RR1, Box 161,
Brattleboro, VT 05301, 802/257-7300). Their October 1995 issue offers a
checklist far less formidable for the smaller firm than the bible of
sustainability, AIA's Environmental Resource Guide (now published and
updated by John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 800/225-5945). See Manufacturers
Resources in this issue for additional information about the projects
mentioned in this story.

practice. Lumber use was minimized by framing 24-in. o.c. with 2 by 6
studs. Natural ventilation, roof overhangs, and daylighting all contribute
to Harwood's confidence that her $79,000 homes won't cost more than $300 a
year to heat and cool. She even offers to guarantee it. Architect Kate
Warner's educational efforts around ReCraft East (right) focus on the
numerous alternative products this traditional-looking house contains--from
fly ash in the concrete to salvaged-wood flooring, and beer-barrel stave
cabinets.

   David Hertz, of Syndesis, Santa Monica, Calif., not only developed
Syndecrete (a cement-based compound that uses recycled materials as its
primary ingredients), he'll use it for various surfaces at the Lehrer house
(right). The house also incorporates numerous other environmentally
preferable alternative products--from recycled rigid-board insulation to
nails with recycled content. Since carpet is avoided, an efficient
radiant-heating system is installed in the floors. Low-flow and
water-conserving plumbing fixtures are specified.

He uses architectural form to focus prevailing breezes. A tower-like
element draws hot air up, exhausting it in the summer and recycling it
(through a heat-recovery unit) in the winter. The hvac has an advanced
control system that allows more effective zoning of heating and cooling
throughout the house.

Illustration: One Photograph and One Plan: An environmental island
   Charged with minimizing environmental impact at DeWees Island, S.C.,
Burt Hill Kosar Rittelmann limited development to 150 homes (right) and
banished petroleum-fueled cars in favor of electric golf carts (no golf
course is allowed, though). Sand paths replace roads.

All house designs must be approved by an architectural review board, which
encourages regional architectural devices such as wide overhangs and
wrap-around porches. Structures are mounted on pilings, reducing impact on
flora and fauna, and permitting hurricane-driven storm surges to pass
harmlessly underneath. Only five percent of the island can be built upon,
and housing must be clustered in the maritime forest on the southwest
corner of the island (lower left in plan).

Conservation of water is encouraged, fertilizers discouraged, and use of
recycled building products required. The Reeves residence, a house that
meets all of these criteria, was recently completed by North Carolina
architect Design Harmony (opposite left).

   Sunnyslope, in Loudon County, Va., is a ``hamlet'' plan posed as an
alternative to the kind of large-lot development that encourages traffic
problems in rural and exurban areas. Bill Reed of Hillier Reed, Bethesda,
Md., and Neal Payton, Washington, D.C., have clustered 30 homes (which
follow their own environmental guidelines), leaving much of the site's 150
acres unencumbered. Following traditional neighborhood development
precedents, the hamlet's streets are designed more like country lanes. A
community building and a town green offer a civic focus.

   The Tamarack Point subdivision, near Colorado Springs, is similar to
many green building programs in that it incorporates many alternative

models are built by Habitat Design and Construction.

Indoor-air-quality issues merited special attention in a Minnesota house
for a client with chemical sensitivities, designed by LBH Engineers and
Architects (3, 4). After the firm researched products, ``the client
actually took materials to the doctor and tested each one,'' says Rick
Carter of LBH. ``Sometimes we had to construct a sample because it
contained a composite material, or something had to be painted and
tested.''

Tile was used instead of carpet; the detached garage minimizes infiltration
of carbon-monoxide; slab-on-grade construction avoided mold-growth from a
basement. The architects even provided doors with large glass areas because
the client is sensitive to softwoods.

Photograph: Three Photographs: Considering climate and landscape
   The showcase house Jones Studio designed for Arizona Public Service (an
electrical utility) goes well beyond those eco-homes that merely substitute
products within a conventional envelope. It's oriented so that thick
masonry walls will absorb Phoenix's fierce direct thermal gain. (They are
insulated with polyurethane foamed without CFCs.) Expressive overhangs
catch breezes and shade the interior from direct sun, while permitting
useful daylight (kitchen and ``great'' room with den beyond--2).

Through such techniques, reliance on energy from fossil fuels is reduced
far beyond the norm. The building envelope saves 30 percent of the energy
used in a typical new energy-efficient house, and is insulated far in
excess of standard practice. The number of windows on east-west exposures
was minimized to enhance energy efficiency; north- and south-facing windows
are grouped to provide plenty of daylight and views. Ecological strategies
extend to the outside. Natural desert plants were used to reduce landscape
water needs, and subsurface irrigation reduces loss of water by
evaporation. Rainwater combined with household gray water is collected for
all landscape watering.

INTRODUCTION

By:
Karen D. Stein

Trying, as correspondent Beth Dunlop reports, to turn ``fiction into
fact,'' the Walt Disney Company has embarked on an ambitious program to
invent a town that resembles one of its own moving-picture fantasies of
American small-town life--Norman Rockwell writ large. Located near Orlando,
Florida, and that ultimate destination spot, Walt Disney World, the
feel-good-named town of Celebration is literally on the rise, with a master
plan by Robert A.M. Stern Architects and Cooper Robertson & Partners and
major downtown buildings by an all star-cast of architects: a Whitman's
Sampler of design (pages 64-69). The first completed project in Celebration
is an office complex by Aldo Rossi of Italy, his first building in the U.S.
(pages 56-63).

While the impressive array of planners and architects has tackled issues of
modest-price housing in Celebration, this month's Building Types Study
(Number 733) on affordable housing presents an even tougher reality, where
amenity, cost-efficiency, and design sensitivity are in a constant
three-way tug-of-war (pages 86-95).

Sensitivity to an existing and beloved historical context--one that, as
Aaron Betsky writes, is ``an inspired merger of monastery and Mission
Style''--is a recurring theme on the growing campus of Stanford University
and one that San Francisco firm Tanner Leddy Maytum Stacy managed to
address while producing a truly Modern addition to the school's engineering
department (pages 70-75), also paving the way for Norman Foster's
competition win of a medical building last month. The evolution of a
different kind of campus has been the long-time preoccupation of French
architect Paul Andreu, who for 30 years has helped guide the development
and expansion of the Charles de Gaulle airport outside Paris (pages 76-85).
His goal has been to avoid what he calls ``the tendency in Modern
architecture for a building to have just one unifying concept.''

THE CROSSROADS OF FRANCE
The Exchange Module is the heart of one of the most sophisticated
transportation hubs in the world.

By:
Claire Downey

The intersection of a high-speed rail line, airport, and urban transit
system occurs at the new Exchange Module at France's Charles de Gaulle
Airport. Opened in 1994, the module serves the recently built perimeter TGV
(trains grande vitesse) line skirting eastern Paris. Built to circumvent
lengthy connections from one inner-city station to another, the new line,
and its airport link, renew Paris's competitive edge as an international
transportation center.

The exchange module is really two projects in one--a train station, plus
the multi-level pedestrianway--and is the latest but certainly not the last
element in French architect Paul Andreu's collaboration with the Aeroports
de Paris. Andreu has designed the entire Charles de Gaulle Airport, and his
new project creates a point of relief in its masterplan. The module uses
dramatic structural design to create unencumbered circulation and, although
monumental, there is a quality of light and weightlessness about it that
contrasts with the density of its concrete neighbors.

For this latest project, Andreu renewed his collaboration with the engineer
Peter Rice (who died in 1992), and Rice's Paris office, RFR. Through shared
discussions, Andreu and Rice conceived of a space that would stay away
``from the simplistic idea,'' or as Andreu explains, ``the tendency in
modern architecture for a building to have just one unifying concept.''
Instead, the elliptical 260-room hotel extends the existing poured-concrete
architectural language of Terminal 2--the transparency of the hotel's
atrium becomes a skylight for the exchange terminal--and is an elegant
counterpoint for the transparency of the train station. The linkage was
simplified by the design of the air terminal itself. In plan, Terminal 2
resembles an elongated figure-eight. In choosing the narrow juncture
between existing segments and the future loop of Terminal 3, Andreu
underlaid the perpendicular axis of the 1,600-foot-long train station.

The winged glass roofs of the train platforms are, from every angle, the
focus of the project. Andreu wanted the roof to appear to float, and he
wanted users to be able to see out and be bathed in light. RFR developed a
cantilevered tubular-support structure, which is quite dense. The visual
complexity is diminished by the design of distinct, readable layers. ``It
was part of Rice's concept,'' explains RFR project director Hugh Dutton,
``to establish a hierarchy, with each element having its own identity.''
The sweep of the roof unifies the complex human movements within.
Passengers transfer from commuter-rail lines to plane, plane to train, or
even Terminal 2 to Terminal 3. Each transport system occupies its own
level, and the openness of the scheme gives passengers a clear idea of
where they are and where they need to go. Its architecture, punctuated by
escalators, seating, and banks of monitors, is almost a blank slate. The
eye is not drawn to the open interior space, but outward, either to the
animated roof of the train station, or the airplanes on the tarmac. The
fact that the glass train-station roofs slope up toward the hotel above
allows a protected inside-outside view. Daylight enters from the north and
south and, and at night, light levels are kept below the glare threshold so
often exceeded in transportation centers.

The openness of the project helps alleviate stress by constantly
re-orienting passengers as they move through the Module. Andreu is against
all that clutters transportation spaces: advertising, piped-in music;
anything that can be referred to as animation. Fortunately, he has included
a cafe and newspaper stand along with the train ticketing counter on Level
2, since the TGV passes infrequently. In terms of train traffic, the
suburban train into Paris, whose four lines parallel the TGV, is more
important. Still, Andreu has preserved a sense of calm that almost allows
this 216,000-square-foot building to seem intimate.

Illustration: Plan: A changing master plan
   Charged with the master planning of the entire airport, as well as the
architecture of its main buildings, Andreu was able to introduce an
architecture for the train station that counterpoints the existing parts of
Terminal 2 and Terminal 3 (currently under construction). The architecture
of the terminals has evolved over time, changing from a one-story plan to a
two-story plan for the latest terminal which will handle more traffic. In
addition to the central passenger drop-off road, automated shuttle cars
will take voyagers from the exchange terminal to the most distant Terminal
1.

Illustration: Two Plans: Circulation and structure
   The complexity of the exchange terminal and train station was simplified
by analyzing each piece separately. The linear train lines, the lobby of
the hotel, the inter-terminal transport, the pedestrian concourses, and the
parallel access roads are visually distinct. Each element, like the glazed
steel roof of the train station, can be further divided into separate and
simply designed parts. A close-up of the 2,200-ton structure (below) shows
the barely-curved plane of the roof separated from the crescent-shaped
trusses by tubular vertical compression struts. Prestressed cables anchor
the end of each truss.

Illustration: Four Photographs and Four Plans: Two rows of spoke-like
pylons support the train-station roof (top opposite), one on each side of
the crescent-shaped trusses so that their identity is distinct. Each pylon
base rests on a pin-joint covered by a steel casting that allows movement
while guaranteeing constant compression.

By using fritted glass for the roof, light is diffused, and the sensation
of looking into a dark structural underbelly is avoided.

The non-loadbearing walls, separated from the roof by a four-foot air space
(bottom left opposite), are transparent, allowing a view of airplanes. The
facade system keeps the glass surface free from mullions by using
drilled-through fittings on branch-like arms attached to vertical masts.

Plans show the intersection between the train lines and air terminals, the
genesis of the Exchange Module. Moving up from the train platforms to the
the intermediate lobby, then up to level two, the traveler arrives at the
main waiting area, shops, and ticketing.

At the upper level, four moving sidewalks take passengers to the adjacent
air terminals. Prow-shaped walls support the hotel located above.

THE CROSSROADS OF FRANCE: UP CLOSE

By:
Claire Downey

Andreu the master builder. For French architect Paul Andreu, the evolution
of Charles de Gaulle airport has been a 30-year preoccupation. As a young
engineering graduate still working on his architecture degree in the 1960s,
Andreau took a job with the Aeroports de Paris (ADP) working on the
masterplan of the new airport. By the time he was 29 and an architect, he
was designing the airport's first terminal. It was a chance he got through
luck, long hours and, he admits, by being a little competitive. The design,
a segmented circle where passengers move through suspended transport tubes,
became a symbol of late-Modern architecture. Coming from nowhere at a time
when few French architects were interested in airport design, Andreu found
himself in the spotlight, but also on the defensive: reviewers at the time
were unsure whether this was architecture or engineering. Isolated by the
debate, Andreau opted to stay on with ADP. Now that airport commissions are
prized by the world's top architects, Andreu's positions with ADP is
enviable. His career in transportation design has not only developed
internationally, but with the completion of the Grande Arche at La Defense
(after the death of Johann Otto van Spreckelsen), one of Paris's grands
projets, and his museum in Osaka, Japan, Andreu is finding a new audience
for his architecture.

DESIGNS ON THE FUTURE

``The combination of celebrated architects with the less well-known (and
the corresponding combination of instant landmarks with modest vernacular
buildings) makes [Disney's new] town kind of a Columbus, Indiana, meets
Columbus, Georgia,'' writes Beth Dunlop.

By:
Beth Dunlop

One sunny Saturday last November, a crowd gathered under a vast tent for an
afternoon's entertainment. It wasn't a circus or a concert, but a lottery
drawing to determine who would be eligible to buy into the Walt Disney
Company's new town, Celebration. Among the hopefuls, interestingly enough,
were several top officials of the Disney Development Corporation (DDC).
They had to take their chances just like everyone else; more than 3,500
potential home-buyers were vying for one of Celebration's first 300 houses
or apartments.

Neo-traditional towns have been an important area of design and inquiry
among architects for the last decade. The first of these--notably, Seaside,
Florida; Kentlands, Maryland; and Laguna West, California--have garnered
their share of critical and popular admiration. Now Disney is building one
of its own. Despite its somewhat frivolous-sounding name, Celebration is a
serious effort to grapple with ideas about the nature and future of
neighborhood, community, and town planning; and it is also an effort to
show that new development can be accountable to environmental and
ecological concerns. It is to be, in the words of DDC vice president for
community development, Don Killoren, ``sustainable and holistic.''

Celebration reflects its creators aspirations. Disney CEO Michael Eisner
hopes that it will provide a ``prototype for the millennium'' by offering
quality of life and intellectual content in addition to practical
conveniences. Eisner pins great hopes on the school--a public experimental
kindergarten through twelfth-grade institution that incorporates a
teacher-training academy--as a way to set the town apart. For his part, DDC
president Peter Rummell wants Celebration to change the perception of the
company as a pure entertainment conglomerate: ``It's going to be a place
that deals with real-world issues and real-world problems, but deals with
them in a relevant way.''

A place called Celebration
   Celebration sits just outside of the sprawling acreage known as Walt
Disney World, near Orlando, Florida. Before embarking on this project, DDC
got the site formally removed from the Reedy Creek Improvement District
(which provides everything ranging from electric power to police protection
to the Magic Kingdom, Epcot, MGM Studios, the water attractions, the
offices, the shopping complexes, and the hotels). Celebration isn't part of
that Disney domain; instead, it is in Osceola County, which will provide
public services from sewers to schools. To build the town, Disney received
the most comprehensive development permit the state of Florida had ever
issued, says Tom Lewis, DDC's vice president for development.

Eventually, the town will have 8,000 houses compactly arranged around a
``downtown'' and more expected Florida-style amenities, such as a golf
course and tennis courts; Disney is spending approximately $100 million on
infrastructure and development. Celebration encompasses just about 10,000
acres, but of that only half is buildable. The rest is protected wetlands,
and home to numerous protected animal and plant species. The town will have
eight miles of trails for hiking or biking, a model school with the latest
in educational equipment, and a ``health campus'' that is both fitness
center and hospital. It already has its own zip code, Celebration, Florida,
34747.

In the role of master-planners Celebration's chief architects are Robert
A.M. Stern and Jaquelin Robertson, who not only created the town plan, but
are also carefully nurturing it into being. The plan itself is derived from
a number of small-town sources, but it is also adapted to its boggy
tropical terrain. It springs, too, from a number of philosophical and
pragmatic ideas about American town planning, from the sequence of spaces
to the role of the backyard. Stern, who, not incidentally, is also a member
of the company's board of directors, and Robertson are shepherding this
town into being with such thoroughness that they have even had a hand in
the design of the light fixtures and street signs to be sure they ``say
Celebration,'' at least symbolically.

Their design for Celebration is not, its authors say, ``ideological,'' but
rather based on the idea that the best American towns are also, in
Robertson's words, ``places people love to go to.'' Of course, Walt Disney
World is the most-visited place in the known universe, so Celebration has a
head start. To begin with, 27,000 visitors stopped in at the cleverly
designed information center (by the graphics and design firm, Pentagram)
within the first three months it was open.

Crossbreeding, Celebration-style
   The town will have compact neighborhoods and house designs drawn from a
host of recast historicist Southern regional styles. Robertson terms this
``the crossbreeding of architecture styles in America.'' Modernism is
noticeably absent; Stern and Robertson believe that American small towns
lost their vitality after World War II. Maintains Robertson: ``Celebration
is really a kind of a testimony to that crossbreeding and our kind of
editing and selection of those town settings that we thought were most
successful and most emblematic.''

Celebration also boasts an exclusive, marquee-level cast of architects. The
plan from Stern and Robertson had early contributions by Duany and
Plater-Zyberk Architects, and Gwathmey Siegel and Associates. The town hall
was designed by Philip Johnson. Next door will be a post office by Michael
Graves. Robert Venturi and Denise Scott Brown are designing the bank; Cesar
Pelli & Associates, the cinema, and Graham Gund, a hotel. William Rawn has
designed Celebration's model school. The late Charles Moore designed the
town's ``preview center,'' and it is to be built posthumously. Robertson's
firm, Cooper Robertson & Partners, is designing the town's golf clubhouse.

Celebration's only completed structures--an office complex to house DDC,
among other tenants--were designed by Aldo Rossi [see previous article].
Adjacent to the Rossi complex will be the health campus, which Stern is
designing. Stern and Robertson have each developed a number of other town
buildings, but the houses themselves will be done by many regional
architects, among them Derrick Smith and Lidia Abella of Miami; McCall and
Turner of Moultrie, Ga.; John Robbins of Oxford, Miss.; Al Jones of Baton
Rouge; Historic Concepts, Inc. of Peachtree City, Ga.; and UDA of
Pittsburgh. The combination of celebrated architects with the less
well-known (and the corresponding combination of instant landmarks with
modest vernacular buildings) makes the town itself kind of a Columbus,
Indiana, meets Columbus, Georgia.

Celebration celebrates what its architects know best
   From the beginning, Stern and Robertson were mindful of the admonition
that architects, like writers, are at their best when their work is based
on what they know. Both Stern and Robertson, as New Yorkers, also have
weekend homes in the Long Island beach town of Easthampton, a place that
they both admire greatly. ``Easthampton seemed to Robert and me to have
almost all of the touchstones of early American urbanism in its earliest
phases and yet every practical issue was addressed in the plan,'' said
Robertson, convenience of observation notwithstanding.

Disney's in-house architects, as well as Ray Gindroz from UDA and Stern and
Robertson, in fact did visit numerous early American towns, many of them in
the South, as part of the extensive research done for Celebration over the
past decade. One young DDC employee--armed with a recent master's in
architecture and a camera--was sent off to photograph every appealing
building or public space he could find in historic towns in the Southeast.

Still, unlike early American town builders, Disney had a host of regulatory
issues as well as environmental and ecological considerations to grapple
with, from the preservation of wetlands that are home to such threatened or
endangered species as the American bald eagle and the Florida gopher
tortoise to the saving of what Stern termed the ``significant trees'' on
the site. The saved trees gave the plan additional shape. In one spot,
houses circle a cluster of trees left in place as a natural landmark. Each
of Celebration's neighborhoods, in fact, revolves around what Stern terms a
``significant public space.''

Charming and car-friendly
   Some of those public spaces--in the downtown, for example--are fully
hospitable to cars. Unlike many quaint 19th-century towns with narrow,
cobbled roads, Celebration's streets are engineered to accommodate
automobiles. Its neighborhoods are precisely arranged to offer walking
distances (between homes and shops, homes and school), a recognition of a
late 20th-century suburban culture in which people drive to the health club
to walk on a treadmill or take the elevator up to climb on the stair
master. ``While we're all interested in traditional towns,'' says Stern,
``this is a representation of that search to recapture the traditional
town. We are all very mindful that this is being built at the end of the
20th century, so the town is traditional in spirit but modern in terms of
what we know about how people live.''

Thus, though outwardly Celebration will rely on a host of architectural and
symbolic gestures to the past, signs of being high-tech, in fact, abound.
Each of its eventual 8,000 houses will be linked to the outside world (town
hall, hospital, school) by an advanced fiber-optic system. The school (run
jointly by Osceola County and Stetson University) is to get an infusion of
the latest equipment and technology from Disney.

The plan places special emphasis on returning streets and sidewalks to the
public realm. The main street, called Water Street (Osceola County already
had a ``Main Street'' and Celebration couldn't reuse the name), is
conceived as a broad, tree-lined boulevard, ``the town stroll.'' The
peripheral road, called Golfpark Drive, has houses only on one side as in
Easthampton, and the golf course is entirely visible from the road--making
it public green space, at least visually. Special attention was paid to the
design of the 15-foot-wide sidewalks, which Stern calls ``the principle
component of the public realm.'' Stern and Robertson were adamant about the
inclusion of alleys for a host of architectural and sociological reasons.
Robertson likes to think of many of the town's elements--the golf course
with no houses fronting on it or the alleys--as ``radical old notions'' of
town planning.

The downtown is conceived as an old-fashioned town center, with a
combination of commercial, office, and residential space. The town hall,
post office, bank, and preview center are all intended as civic standouts,
buildings that will be recognized by and, it is hoped, for their
architecture. Stern and Robertson are providing the fabric around the
landmarks: they essentially divvied up the rest of the downtown buildings
half-and-half, and they are cloaked in the hybrid American style that
conjures up lots of non-specific memories. ``We predicated our design on
the notion that American towns had a life before the 1940s, basically, up
until World War II, so the buildings take their inspiration up to the
1940s,'' says Stern.

Designing by the book
   The architects and builders of Celebration's houses must work within the
guidelines of a hefty and handsome ``pattern book,'' based on similar books
published in the early part of this century. Pittsburgh architect Ray
Gindroz, of the firm Urban Design Associates, is its author. It delineates
the basic elements of ``the Celebration house''--front facade, back yard,
side wings, porches--and outlines the six architectural styles and possible
configurations allowed in the town's first phase. The styles are defined as
Classical, Victorian, Colonial Revival, Coastal, Mediterranean, and French.
The pattern book is a kit of parts in a way, with numerous potential
combinations of roof profiles, finish materials, windows, and ornament.
``Instead of telling people what they shouldn't do, we are telling people
what they can do,'' said Gindroz.

Some buyers at Celebration may bring in his their own architects, while
others will choose from those offered by the developers. Everybody, though,
must respect such rules as the height of the cornice line (``absolutely
critical in creating the quality of the public space,'' claims Gindroz) and
the placement of fences and hedges along the street. Although, Celebration
is a town in name, it will not immediately be self-governed (Disney will
own most of the public space and all of the commercial buildings); thus,
strict controls can be kept over paint colors, renovations, and even the
placement of screened porches and pool enclosures.

A highway runs through it
   Its site has a certain high visibility. It is just off Highway 192, the
southerly approach to Walt Disney World and a road lined with every
imaginable (and some likely beyond easy imagining) fast-food restaurant,
motel chain, souvenir shop, themed shopping center, and family
entertainment offering. Stern calls it ``the sleaze road of all times.''
Rossi's rather sophisticated office complex sits along Highway 192, as will
Stern's hospital. After DDC had designated this off-site site for
Celebration, the Florida Department of Transportation decided it needed to
run a connector road through it, which will separate the town from the
office complex and hospital. The addition of this road makes Celebration at
once more accessible to the outside world and less so, in that it will be
difficult to go on foot to and from the adjacent health facilities and
office buildings. The new road is, at best, a mixed blessing and one that
gives Celebration a full-fledged late 20th-century pedigree, the new town
by the expressway.

Model town or company town?
   And unlike many new housing developments, Celebration is not a gated
community, nor is it oppressively expensive. ``Our emphasis,'' says
Killoren, ``is on diversity. We don't have distinctions between the haves
and have-nots here.'' Indeed, at Celebration, the top-end lots (called
``estate'' lots) are a stone's throw from the townhouses, which will sell
for prices ranging upwards of $120,000, and rental apartments downtown.
Still, a criticism leveled by some is that even at that lowest price range,
Celebration-living is out of reach for many of Disney's low-end employees.
``It is not a cure-all,'' says Eisner. ``It's a way of trying to make a
town.''

Disney, for its part, is adamant about not letting this be a company town.
The philosophical emphasis on diversity means more than just economic or
ethnic diversity, which is why employees had to take their chances in the
lottery just like everybody else (a father of three, DDC's Killoren, for
example, drew number 97 in the estate lots lottery; another top DDC
executive wanted a cottage lot and most likely won't get it on the first
round).

The future resembles the past
   All of Disney's theme-park environments--from the various ``lands'' and
rides to the hotels--are somehow idealized. When Walt Disney designed the
first Main Street for Disneyland in 1955, he said he was basing it on his
hometown of Marcelline, Missouri, but Disney was idealizing the
turn-of-the-century American small town main street, turning fact into
fiction. A decade later, in the mid-1960s when Walt Disney was buying up
Central Florida swampland for his second theme park venture, his interests
had jumped from past to future. His goal was a futuristic model community
he called EPCOT (originally, EPCOT was an acronym for Experimental
Prototype Community of Tomorrow). Thus, while others were drawing up Main
Street and Cinderella's castle, he was thinking bigger thoughts about
finding a solution to urban chaos. He envisioned EPCOT sitting under a
bubble of glass, with high-speed monorails zipping residents of this
high-tech town from home to work and back again--a sleek and hermetic world
of the future. Disney's idea died with him in 1966.

But now we know the future is, at least partly, in the past and it's to be
found at Celebration, not at EPCOT. Says Stern: ``Ironically, it is Main
Street [in the Magic Kingdom] that was the actual genius of American
urbanism recaptured.'' Now Main Street, Disney-style, moves into the
mainstream in Celebration where, perhaps, the process will be reversed, and
the fiction and fantasy of small-town life will be turned back into fact.

THE MASTERPLAN

By:
Beth Dunlop

Celebration's town plan is both defined and circumscribed by natural
conditions. Roughly half of its 10,000 acres is protected wetlands, which
creates a greenbelt and allows for uninterrupted vistas through the trees.

The plan focuses on a new lake, part of a system of canals and waterways
that provides for storm-water runoff and gives the town a visual focal
point. The town center nests along the lakefront, and the residential
neighborhoods fan out from there. In Celebration's first phase of
construction, everyone will be within walking distance of the shops and
restaurants.

A strongly hierarchical road system gives further definition: broad
boulevards; narrower, winding roads; straight streets; back alleys;
pedestrian walkways; and bicycle paths. At the periphery is Golfpark Drive,
with houses on one side and rolling greens on the other--a device both
esthetic and democratic in intent. Leaving the golf course accessible gives
Celebration a strongly defined open space so everyone--not just a
privileged few who can afford adjacent houses--gets the view. Another bold
gesture in the plan is the broad boulevard that cuts a swath through
Celebration and is intended as the town's promenade. It is Water Street, a
reference to the stream that will run through its median strip.
(Celebration had to take street names that were not already in use in
Osceola County, which was no small task in the generally cutesy world that
is Orlando and its vicinity. Most were already in use, leaving the rather
old-fashioned Sycamore, Honeysuckle, Elderberry, and Mulberry.)

Each residential neighborhood focuses on a special spatial feature: a
circle, a square, a protected strand of trees, or the waterway. These
features, in turn, give shape and character to their neighborhoods and, say
the architects, definition and subtlety to the plan.

DOWNTOWN CELEBRATION

By:
Beth Dunlop

Downtown Celebration is intended as a place to live, work, shop, eat, and
play. It is also conceived as an ode to late 20th-century architecture: its
primary buildings have been designed by architects who achieved fame in the
1970s and 80's. It includes a town hall by Philip Johnson, a post office by
Michael Graves, a bank by Robert Venturi and Denise Scott Brown, a cinema
by Cesar Pelli, and a ``preview center'' by the late Charles Moore. Most of
the other downtown buildings are by the firms of Celebration's chief
planners Robert A.M. Stern and Jaquelin Robertson. An inn, not in the first
phase, is by Graham Gund.

The all-star lineup was the brainchild of Disney's chief architect Wing
Chao. He told Disney CEO Michael Eisner and DDC president Peter Rummell
that since the town would be in the spotlight ``we needed an all-star team
for our first line-up, if you'll forgive the football analogy.'' Eisner
says he ``loved the idea of having us challenged by others on the outside
and being pushed to excellence''

RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOODS

By:
Beth Dunlop

Celebration's residential structures are governed by a hefty, 74-page,
portfolio-size ``pattern book,'' based on similar guidelines published
early in the century. The book is largely the work of Ray Gindroz of the
Pittsburgh firm, Urban Design Associates, in association with Disney
Development Corporation, Robert A.M. Stern Architects, and Cooper Robertson
& Partners.

The pattern book is not simply a blueprint. It sets forth the
philosophical, historical, and architectural premises that inspired
Celebration and establishes some basic principles and definitions to guide
all development.

A number of elements of the town are strictly controlled, among them the
building massing, the placement of side wings and porches, the height of
the cornice line. The urbanism of Celebration depends on the relationship
of house and yard (bounded by a fence or hedge) to the sidewalk. The
pattern book prescribes this relationship to create a clear distinction
between the private, domestic realm of the house and the public realm of
streets, sidewalks, and squares.

Celebration will have six accepted building styles--Classical, Victorian,
Colonial Revival, Coastal (a melding of French Colonial and ``low country''
architectural traditions), Mediterranean, and French. The styles are drawn
from Southern domestic and vernacular architecture, and are the result of
studying such towns as Charleston, Beaufort, and Mount Pleasant, S.C. Early
buyers seemed to favor the Coastal house, with its wraparound porches, and
the somewhat grander Classical models.

Celebration's houses will not necessarily be true styles, letter- perfect
in their authenticity. Rather, they will be composites of those typically
found in small-town neighborhoods that have evolved over the years, though
the pattern book carefully lays out mandatory ``key elements'' and
appropriate detailing for each style. Within this are endless combinations
of windows and doors, porches, and loggias.

To add to the mix, there are four basic sizes of Celebration lots:
``estate'' (though presiding over lots typically 90 by 130 feet and not, as
the name suggests, vast rolling acreage), ``village'' (to accommodate a
regular house), ``cottage'' (for a slightly smaller ``empty nest'' or
``starter'' house) and ``townhouse.''

The pattern book also spells out acceptable materials, which intentionally
differ somewhat among the styles to provide texture to each neighborhood.
There is also a palette of approved Celebration paint colors and a guide to
preferred plants and trees. All of this is aimed at achieving the tricky
balance of making Celebration seem at once coherent and diverse, as if the
town simply grew all on its own.

PLACE MAKING
Aldo Rossi gives monumental presence to Disney's development company,
creator of the new Florida town of Celebration

By:
Karen D. Stein

Central Florida's flat sawgrass-rimmed landscape in no way suggests the
Italian town of Pisa, except to the mind of Aldo Rossi, whose leap of
imagination has linked them in spirit, giving this instant town an instant
landmark. The plan of Rossi's office complex, the first project to be built
in the Walt Disney Company-sponsored new town of Celebration, was inspired
by Pisa's main square, the Piazza dei Miracoli or ``square of miracles,'' a
green lawn punctuated by a sculptural mix of buildings. Rossi says the
reference makes a connection between his project and ``a sense of the
infinite within history and nature.'' While only the first phase of Rossi's
scheme is now complete--two contiguous buildings and a garden pavilion that
temporarily occupies the site of a proposed third office block--already
there's a there in a place that Rossi's American partner Morris Adjmi aptly
calls ``the middle
of nowhere.''

Rossi, author of the famed The Architecture of the City, has succeeded in
injecting an urbane presence into the sprawl of highways and strip-shopping
malls that surround Celebration, a satellite of Orlando and that ultimate
destination, Walt Disney World. While Rossi's reputation as an ivory-tower
academic might seem at odds with profit- driven Disney, his architecture
proves that theorist and practitioner can co-exist. Rossi's simple but
powerful forms are an artful combination of lucid and familiar shapes, are
easy to build, and, given the correct choice of materials, inexpensive.
(Rossi's popularity among practitioners and students of architecture in
this country would suggest that his first project in the United States
would be an academic institution. The economy said otherwise: Rossi's 1986
design of the School of Architecture at the University of Miami remains
unbuilt for lack of funding.)

For many architects who seek to work at a scale equal to their ambitious
vision, Disney, with its deep pockets and the rare inclination to invest in
architecture, has become an accepted, if not coveted client. Nonetheless,
Rossi's first collaboration with the company, a competition entry for the
first phase of the Euro Disney amusement park and resort in 1988, did not
yield built results. Rossi's interest in American vernacular styles seemed
to dovetail nicely with the company's man-date for themed entertainment.
During design development of the Hotel New Orleans, however, Rossi balked
at a process that ranked the architect somewhere amidst consultants and
efficiency experts. The parting was amicable. Three years later, an office
building, with its more obvious program requirements and straightforward
floorplates, reunited client and architect in their traditional roles.

Though Rossi was unaware of the specific plans for Celebration as his
project began [see the article that follows for an overview of
Celebration], his complex, located just south of a highway, has proved to
be an effective billboard of sorts for the town that is sprouting up just
beyond the confines of his 30-acre site. The two buildings, with their
giant-scale column grids and hefty cornice lines, convey a seriousness of
purpose ideally suited to a $2.5-billion development that Disney hopes will
serve as a model for future new towns. The buildings are also an apt symbol
for a principal tenant, the Disney Development Company, which, led by its
president Peter Rummell and chief architect Wing Chao, has invested
millions on famous and not-so-famous architects and continues to commission
projects at a prodigious rate, banking on architecture as a sellable
attraction. For Rossi the commission has a more poetic connotation: ``I've
come to understand the vastness of America.''

PLACE MAKING: UP CLOSE

By:
Karen D. Stein

Planning for the future. Aldo Rossi's masterplan for the Celebration Place
office complex (drawing below) calls for replacing the demountable garden
pavilion or ``folly'' (at left in photo opposite bottom) with a bar-like
building that completes the U-shaped ring of the first phase. Eventually,
two structures will be added across the street--a total of five buildings
on a grassy plain criss-crossed by pedestrian walkways and surrounded by
parking lots. Rossi and the New York City outpost of his Milan-based Studio
di Architettura studied several planning and massing scenarios, including a
scheme to locate the office blocks atop a shared parking base, an approach
that would have enhanced the monumentality of the complex.

While Rossi favored the plinth in other projects he was developing at the
time--the Hotel Il Palazzo in Fukuoka, Japan [RECORD, May 1990, pages
70-78], and the still unbuilt School of Architecture at the University of
Miami--the cost of subterranean construction was out of line with the
modest Disney budget. (The two completed buildings came in at $65 per
square foot for the shells and lobbies. Associate architect Smallwood,
Reynolds, Stewart, Stewart & Associates did the interiors.) Other proposals
discarded after closer scrutiny, reports Rossi's partner Morris Adjmi,
include adding a road on axis into the courtyard. ``Too rigid,'' says
Adjmi.

STANFORD'S NEW STYLE
Charles B. Thornton Center for Engineering Management
Stanford University Palo Alto, California
Tanner Leddy Maytum Stacy, Architects

By:
Aaron Betsky

Stucco walls and red-tile roofs, arches and colonnades, courtyards filled
with live oak trees: that's the idiom of Stanford University. Ever since it
was founded by Leland Stanford in 1885, and laid out by Frederick Law
Olmsted with buildings by Shepley, Rutan & Coolidge in an inspired merger
of monastery and Mission style, architects have been trying to figure out
how to adapt the imagery of one of the country's most prestigious academic
institutions to changing uses, technologies, and perceptions. Now a new
slate of buildings is modernizing the vocabulary with some unexpected
materials. Under the direction of Campus Architect David Neuman, who
previously turned the University of California at Irvine into an
architectural showpiece, Stanford has hired the likes of Robert A.M. Stern,
Antoine Predock, Ricardo Legoretta, and Henry Cobb of Pei, Cobb, Freed &
Partners to expand its architectural vision. The harbinger of this wave is
a simple shed designed by Bill Leddy of the San Francisco firm, Tanner
Leddy Maytum Stacy.

The Charles B. Thornton Center for Engineering Management is a
12,000-square-foot addition to the 1977 Frederick Emmons Termon Engineering
Building. Designed by Harry Weese, this much beloved (by its inhabitants)
essay in ``engineers' esthetic'' itself tried to update the vocabulary of
the campus with clearly expressed concrete trays framing a skin that
appears to be almost wholly made up of wood shutters. To fit into the
campus, Weese sunk the large building two floors into the ground, creating
a light well of the garden in the rear. Leddy's challenge was to add room
for Stanford's innovative design program, which is a joint venture between
the art, engineering, and business schools.

The site defined the building. ``We soon realized that it was more about
the space between the two buildings than about the envelope,'' recalls
Leddy. This fit Neuman's philosophy, since he believes that the landscape
is almost as important as the buildings themselves. ``It's what our alumni
remember, it's what sets the character of the campus.'' Leddy placed the
building--two state-of-the-art ``case study'' classrooms outfitted ``almost
like broadcast studios'' and two loft-like design studios--in a rectangular
volume packed between an access road to the west and a grove of oak trees
to the east. To the south, the Thornton Center presents a simple, low
facade, ``setting the stage for the development of the campus across the
street,'' as Neuman puts it. The building rises up on the north side both
to catch light for the studios and to answer the scale of the Terman
Building. Working with landscape architect Peter Walker, Leddy then
reconfigured the sunken courtyard into an open, sloping outdoor room.

The Thornton Center's main feature is its central gateway. This is an
updated version of the rhythm of great arches that march through the
campus, and that had already found a more rectilinear expression in the
Terman Building. The portal is not just an expressive framing device: by
using it for external circulation, Leddy avoided the need for interior
corridors. The steel trusses that frame the stairs provide lateral seismic
bracing. ``This is what I think of as the strength of Tanner Leddy Maytum
Stacy's work,'' says Neuman. ``They give you an artistic expression of
structural elements that allow for a simplicity of use, and that makes the
building easy to understand at every level.'' Carried out in an ``updated
version of the Stanford vocabulary,'' as he puts it, the Thornton Center is
a steel, stucco, concrete, and copper emblem of the architectural craft,
and a clear representation of the reality of site, function, and the
aspirations of the client.

is a true shed-form, this is only apparent on the east and west
facades--otherwise it appears to have an extremely strong orthogonal
massing.

STANFORD'S NEW STYLE: UP CLOSE

Structural definition. The Thornton Center is essentially a rectangular box
whose interior spaces are defined by a row of steel trusses. The shape of
these members creates a sloped roof that echoes the Stanford vocabulary,
and is a form also typically used in industrial buildings to create
daylight monitors. Here the second-floor classrooms are opened up to the
north light. Lateral seismic bracing is provided at the slightly off-center
center portal, in the form of a Pratt truss. The end facades are frank
expressions of this structural and functional arrangement. The only
additions involve the site. These include screen walls, the portico--whose
poured-in-place columns echo the Terman Building--and the slightly
whimsical extension of the stair landing into a ``Pope's balcony.''

ON THE OUTSIDE
Clapboard and shingles clad many homes in America. Both plastic and
natural-wood products can offer excellent appearance and long-term
performance if properly selected and installed.

According to the Vinyl Siding Institute, a division of the Society of the
Plastics Industry, vinyl is now the most popular siding choice for
residential exteriors, including multifamily projects and condominiums. By
1993, PVC had 44 percent of this market, compared to 39 percent for wood,
14 percent for masonry, and 3 percent for ``other.'' Today's plastic with
UV inhibitors represents more sophisticated chemistry than earlier
pretty-much-just-white siding. Achieving UV stabilization has expanded the
palette to include deep tones and authentic historic colors; elements such
as door lintels and dentil moldings enable the designer to create a
detailed facade using vinyl accessories.

Correct installation is key
   Rigid PVC siding must conform to the dimensional and other
characteristics required by ASTM 3679; color change over the life of the
siding should be within this standard's color-hold guidelines.

The main concern of a vinyl-siding installation should be to fasten the
panels as described in Rigid Vinyl Siding--Application Instructions: nails
must be spaced correctly and centered in the slots; nailheads must not
embed and restrict the thermal movement of the panel, anticipated to be
about 1/4-in. over a 12-ft length. Siding must be able to expand and
contract or it will buckle. Siding distortion from improper nailing is the
most common complaint brought to the Institute, says Rich Gottwald,
technical director.

Over and above the dimensional and color-retention standards compelled by
ASTM D-3679, there is a wide number of surface grain pattern and gloss
options, panel profiles, and coordinating accessories for the architect to
choose from. We show five new product lines here.

Half-round shingles
   A new pattern in this maker's Cedar Impressions line, half-round
shingles are made in molds cast directly from hand-cut cedar pieces. While
made of polypropylene to better mimic the texture of the wood original, the
shingles come in seven colors designed to work with vinyl siding products
and trims. Shingles are furnished as a 34-in. double-course panel with
interlocking side tabs said to provide a seamless appear-ance when
installed; these and others of this maker's siding products have been
success-fully wind-tested at 180 mph. 800/233-8990. CertainTeed Corp.,
Siding Division, Vinyl Building Products Group, Valley Forge, Pa.

Long-lasting colors
   Heartland guarantees its Satin Ensemble vinyl siding to exhibit color
retention well above ASTM re-quirements. Available in nine colors ranging
from white and pastels to darker clay, sage, and gray tones, siding comes
in the four pro-files shown: double 4-in., double 5-in., double 4-in. Dutch
lap, and a triple 3-in. exposure. An architectural specification binder and
color fandecks sample siding, soffit, trim, and Sherwin-Williams paint
colors designed to work together. 800/328-7864. Heartland Building
Products, Booneville, Miss.

Realistic texture
   Waterford, a new siding produced by a recently acquired Canadian
subsidiary of ABT Building Products, incorporates a fairly subtle woodgrain
embossing. Siding comes in 10 colors with matching accessories, facings,
and shutters. Profiles include double 4- and 5-in. and a double-4-in.

Bigger product mix
   Expanding its range of product for the residential/multifamily market,
Owens-Corning offers Transitions vinyl siding, with a smooth-grained
surface said to resemble painted wood. The product comes in eight colors
and three styles, including the double 4-inch lap shown. 800/GET-PINK.
Owens-Corning, Toledo, Ohio.

Positive lock
   Wolverine's new siding, American Legend, has a 90-deg face, and
more-secure edge design that snaps panels together horizontally. This
increased stiffness helps keep siding straight during installation. The
vinyl's surface is described as a ``soft'' woodgrain, available in nine
colors; ``Cream'' is shown on the house. An Exterior Design System for
architects illustrates coordinating siding, trim, and accessories; an Idea
Book includes before- and-after photos to demonstrate how siding can be
``historically correct.'' 800/452-2152. Wolverine Technologies, Livonia,

SPECIFICATIONS REVISED FOR RED-CEDAR SIDINGS

Siding made of western red-cedar lumber is a premium architectural product.
Correctly selected, installed, and finished, there is no reason cedar
siding should not remain weatherproof and attractive for decades. And its
physical characteristics permit a range of versatile architectural
applications not possible with other materials. For example, architect Paul
Grant was able to apply bevel-edge cedar siding to garage doors, to tie
them into the house itself (top, right).

To make sure that cedar achieves its full potential, an industry group
(whose members are the major sources of red-cedar lumber in the U.S. and
Canada) has published new guidelines for architects, trying to take some of
the mystery out of using cedar as an exterior siding and to reflect current
thinking on appropriate wood grades, attachment methods, and finishing
options (bottom, right).

Specification. It's important to be able to evaluate different cedar
sidings accurately, to select the most appropriate and economical grade for
the esthetic desired: will the siding have a clear, natural finish,
weathering over time? Will it be painted or stained? The Association's
Specification Guide includes good color photos that provide a realistic
look at the different grades of cedar and demonstrate their relative
differences. Tables for each siding type--bevel, patterned tongue and
groove and lap siding, and vertically oriented board-and-batten--list the
infor-mation needed to insure that the wood specified matches the intended
end use. Criteria:

-- Pattern. For example, plain bevel, rabbeted bevel, or wavy edge bevel.
-- Nominal size. Thickness and Width.
-- Quantities. Coverage tables translate different exposures into a surface
measure for calculating linear feet needed.
-- Grade. For bevel siding, these would include Clear Vertical-Grain
Heartwood, A Clear, Rustic, B Clear, Select Knotty, and Quality Knotty.
-- Grading agency paragraph. The appropriate rule to reference each
siding.
-- Surface to be exposed. Designation of either smooth face or sawn should
anticipate the finish to be applied: paint on smooth, clear or opaque stain
on rough-sawn surfaces.
-- Moisture content. Kiln-dried or green.

Installation. The two most-common mistakes in putting up siding are not
nailing to a suffi-cient base--fasteners must penetrate into a solid-wood
stud--and using the wrong nail. Choose hot-dipped galvanized, aluminum, or
stainless-steel nails only; stainless-steel is the best choice, especially
if the siding is to be finished with transparent or semi-transparent stain.
Make sure that the nail length accounts for sheathing thickness.

Finishing. The Association strongly recom-mends back priming all siding,
and feels that the performance and appearance expectations architects have
of cedar are better met with a coating appropriate to the look desired,
whe-ther paint, semi- or opaque stain, or a clear or weathering finish.

CORRECTIONS

A sketch from the archives of The Architects Collaborative, identified as
the work of Walter Gropius [RECORD, September 1995, page 19], was actually
the work of John C. Harkness. Harkness and Gropius worked together as
partners-in-charge on the design of the American Association for the
Advancement of Science Building.

The credits for the Columbus Regional Hospital [RECORD, November 1995,
pages 100-103], should have included Walter P. Moore and Associates as
structural engineer, not P.S.S. Partnership. In addition, John Crane was
principal-in-charge at Falick/Klein Partnership; Cynthia Watson, FKP, was
medical designer and project manager.

The LAC+USC Medical Center project appeared in the article ``Are Big
Hospitals Dinosaurs?'' [RECORD, November 1995, page 98]. Lee Burkhart, Liu
(LBL) was given sole credit for the design of the $1.2-billion replacement
hospital for the Los Angeles County-University of Southern California
Medical Center. In fact, HOK and LBL are joint venture partners in the
planning and design of the project.

MAKING AFFORDABLE PROJECTS WORK
Tax credits, planning ingenuity, and sensitivity to the needs of residents
can create attractive places for low-income people.

By:
By H. Jane Lehman

Money matters, it goes without saying. But the notable lack of it within
the affordable housing realm drives nearly every step of the design
process. For architects working on affordable housing projects, the
challenge, in a nutshell, is: How do you create tight but livable spaces
for little money on problem-laden sites for diverse groups of residents?
The answer: Carefully, sensitively, and with respect for the particular
needs of the people who will be living there.

The faithfulness of the architectural profession to these principles falls
to either extreme, says Bill Witte, a partner with The Related Companies of
California, an Irvine-based development company that specializes in
low-income housing. Much of the public housing built in America during the
post-war era failed to provide safe, attractive, or appropriately scaled
places to live. While design was hardly the only cause of these problems,
the architects involved in these projects and the profession as a whole
earned a reputation for being removed from the concerns of the people they
were designing for.

Today, more architects recognize the need to listen to clients and end
users. ``Cost-efficiency is very important, particularly when there are
limits on rent,'' says Witte in explaining a key issue for the
organizations that build affordable housing. ``But so is sensitivity to the
needs of the people who will live there,'' he adds. ``Do architects get it?
Some do, some don't.''

Tax-credit tangle
   Clients ready to start affordable projects often fight long and hard for
funds with which to proceed. Some patch together state and local funds, but
most rely on the federal low-income housing tax credit. With the demise of
the federally funded low-income housing production programs some 15 years
ago, tax-credit financing (begun in 1986) is about the only thing that has
sustained this market. The National Association of Home Builders estimates
that in recent years the credit has enabled the annual construction of
30,000 to 80,000 new low-income rental units and the rehabilitation of
about 60,000 existing affordable apartments (graph below shows new
construction using the credit).

The program works this way: Each state, based on a per capita formula, gets
a piece of an approximately $2.2-billion annual pie. Apartment developers
submit proposals, including pre-schematics and site pro-formas, in an
effort to win a credit allocation from a state housing finance agency.
Apartment rents must be affordable to households earning no more than 60
percent of the area's median income. In this case, affordable means a
family spends no more than a third of its household budget to cover the
rent. In the Los Angeles area, that translates to around $6,000 to $9,000 a
year for shelter, reports Witte, whose company has 10 tax-credit projects
underway in California.

Developers who succeed in procuring credits from the state then sell them,
often in conjunction with a syndicator, to investors who pay a lump sum for
the credits. The credits are used by investors for dollar-for-dollar
write-offs against tax liabilities. With the investors' cash as an equity
stake, developers do not need to borrow as much money to finance the
projects, thereby lowering the rents they need to charge.

Credits' fate is in doubt--again
   Although the system is working well, there is a fly in the ointment. The
program's permanent status is in doubt--again. Two years ago,
Congress--then controlled by the Democrats--voted to end the uncertainty
associated with year-by-year renewal of the credit by embedding it
permanently in the tax code. This fall, the Republican-led Congress agreed
to revoke the tax credit's permanent status as of December 31, 1997. If
that happens, the program's supporters say, the tax credit will not fare
well at a time when federal spending is shrinking. ``Sunsetting the tax
credit is tantamount to killing it,'' states John McEvoy, executive
director of the National Council of State Housing Agencies. The program's
best hope is a Presidential veto with instructions to Congress to return
with a new budget reconciliation bill that, among other things, preserves
the credit's permanent status, explains Andre Shashaty, the publisher of a
San Francisco-based magazine devoted to affordable housing finance. That,
he says, would insulate it from the knock-down, drag-out federal budget
fights expected in the coming years.

In terms of design, taking a one-size-fits-all approach to affordable
housing is destined to fail, given the diversity of the intended occupants.
Residents may be single mothers, two parents with lots of kids,
inter-generational households, senior citizens, the disabled, or new
immigrants. This may mean including in the program special support
features, such as open space, playgrounds, athletic fields, child-care
operations, job-training facilities, stores, or social-services offices. Or
it may mean recognizing that the needs of any one group may be foreign to
the architect's own experience, says Michael Pyatok, head of Oakland-based
Pyatok Associates, which designs about 400 units of low-income housing a
year on the West Coast.

Involving users in the design process
   ``With over 20 applicants for every affordable apartment, architects can
design just about anything and because the rent is cheap and the building
is new, it will be rented,'' states Pyatok. ``Consequently, architects have
felt free to design for their peers and their ideology, but invariably we
have torn those things down.'' Pyatok addresses the problem by including in
the design process the neighborhood from which the tenants are likely to
come. Recently, the architects met every two weeks with community members
living near the site proposed for a project in San Jose. At the sessions,
five groups of 10 Latinos worked with modeling kits to explore apartment
and site possibilities. After showing seven historical design directions,
as well as their contemporary interpretations, Pyatok was surprised when
all of the groups, working independently, not only settled on the same
category but picked the same two images out of the four offered. The
winner? ``They loved the vibrancy of the Crafts style.''

A different tack was taken by Solomon Architecture & Urban Design in
shaping the Vest Pocket Community in Fairfax, California, a project with 19
units of rental housing shared by roommates and designed to look like
single-family houses. The non-profit developer, Innovative Housing of San
Rafael, matches up roommates, deliberately bringing together the disabled,
seniors, and single mothers. Besides the usual challenges of affordable
housing design, privacy was an especially important issue here because
non-related people would be living together, says architect Daniel
Solomon.

By definition, low-income housing is smaller and denser than market-rate
developments. The trick is to accomplish the economic trade-offs while
avoiding the ``danger of making these places unworkable,'' explains Avi
Friedman, director of the Affordable Housing Program at the school of
architecture at McGill University in Montreal. The program doesn't just
examine issues of affordable housing, it actually develops new prototypes
as well. The 14-foot-wide and 36-foot-deep GrowHomes it pioneered cost
$60,000.

Part of the secret to designing affordable housing is creating efficient
floor plans. ``I have just gotten good at putting units together so there
is no wasted space,'' says Solomon. Other critical ingredients are good
access to daylight and views, says Joan Goody of Goody Clancy & Associates
in Boston, a 50-person firm that has designed such award-winning housing
projects as the 1988 Tent City and Langham Court [RECORD, July 1992, pages
92-97]. Goody is adept at carving four bedrooms out of the same space
devoted to two in market-rate projects.

Nonetheless, architects should no more skimp on design details of housing
for poor people than they should when designing for more affluent people.
``Affordable housing does not cost any less to build,'' asserts Goody,
``and it is a myth to think that it can.'' Many of Goody's projects,
including Langham Court, mix low-, moderate-, and upper-income residents
together without making quality distinctions among the units. ``It is not
normal for people to live segregated by income.'' A well-built project that
fits into its surrounding neighborhood can help counter the knee-jerk
response by many groups to resist the placement of affordable housing in
their communities. Such a project ``becomes a billboard for the next
project you may want to do,'' says Pyatok. ``It dispels doubts that other
communities might have.''

Responding to site and context
   Low-income housing suffers from a poor reputation generally, driven
largely by deeply flawed site designs from the past, which set the stage
for crime and vandalism, says Solomon. The wholesale leveling of existing
neighborhoods in the 1950s and 1960s in the name of urban renewal
``destroyed the town fabric and stigmatized the poor,'' says Solomon.

Lost in the razing, explains Pyatok, was the old urban morphology of the
American town that included rowhouses with front porches and backyards, the
celebration of corner homes, the street grid, residential alleys,
courtyards, and storefronts. Bringing that all back, he says, will let
``people get to know each other again.''

HOMAN SQUARE
Chicago
Nagle Hartray Danker Kagan McKay Architects/Planners

By:
Clifford A. Pearson

Located on the former site of Sears Roebuck & Co.'s world headquarters in
west Chicago, Homan Square is an ambitious development that aims to revive
a decaying neighborhood. Until the early 1970s when Sears moved to its
world's-tallest tower in downtown Chicago, the 55-acre site was the heart
of its global operations and included a 4-million-sq-ft warehouse, office
buildings, and giant parking lots. Sears' move downtown, combined with
racial unrest in 1968, triggered a downward spiral of decay and
disinvestment that left the North Lawndale area an urban basket case. Now
Homan Square is reversing that trend, bringing new subsidized and
market-rate housing, and some commercial development, back to the
neighborhood. A joint-venture of Sears and The Shaw Company, a respected
local developer, Homan Square will eventually encompass 600 new units of
rental and for-sale housing, as well as the redevelopment of existing
office space for private businesses and the possible conversion of a 1905
brick tower into a community center. Thanks to Sears' donation of the land
and its $13,000 subsidy for each for-sale unit in the first two phases, the
project is providing housing for low-income families. Additional subsidies
of $20,000 per unit from the city's New Homes for Chicago program and
housing tax credits are keeping most of the units here within the reach of
families earning less than 80 percent of the local median income. As
masterplanned by Nagle Hartray Danker Kagan McKay Architect/Planners, Homan
Square is a series of mixed-income blocks that fit into the city's existing
street grid while varying enough from the usual formula to establish its
own identity. ``The idea was to develop a site plan that would work with
the scale of the existing neighborhood, while creating defensible open
spaces in each block,'' says partner-in-charge Dirk Danker. Instead of
lining up all the housing along the street, as is typical in Chicago, the
architects carved out small green spaces at the four corners and two larger
open spaces in the middle of each block. To make sure these open spaces are
safe places for residents, the masterplan organizes housing units so they
face the outdoor spaces. By lining the open areas with front doors, the
plan makes sure the residents take possession of the communal spaces.
Although most homes are serviced from the back by alleys, the amount of
space devoted to these internal roads is kept to a minimum and backyards
are fenced off so that each family controls this space. Homan Square
includes three types of housing--detached single-family homes, townhouses,
and apartments--and each block includes all three. By integrating all three
in each block, the developers made sure there would be a mix of income
groups and family types in each phase of the project. ``We wanted to mix it
up as much as possible,'' says Danker. Three-story apartment buildings with
six units each anchor the four corners of the block, while 24 single-family
homes wrap around the two lawns in the middle of the block. In between are
four rows of townhouses, five units to a row. The result is 68 units to the
block. The three-bedroom single-family houses range in size from 1,590 to
1,670 square feet and in price from $92,000 to $97,000. In the project's
first phase (one block), which was completed and fully occupied in the
second half of 1995, rents ranged from $385 a month for 850-sq-ft
apartments to $490 for 1,160-sq-ft townhouses. Some of the units have
half-sunken basements and all are simple wood-frame structures with wood
trusses and clad with brick at the base and stucco and EIFS above. By using
masonry only at the base, stacking plumbing, and using efficient floor
plans that almost eliminate corridors, the architects were able to keep
construction costs down to about $70 a square foot. Corner windows and open
living spaces make these units feel larger than they are. A second block is
under construction and will be ready this spring. Phase 2 is already sold
out. A third phase with 16 market-rate homes is being designed by Schroeder
Murchie Laya Associates. ``Our hope is to establish a neighborhood that's
good, a place where people want to live,'' says design principal James
Nagle. The plan seems to be working. In fact, the project is encouraging
residents of adjacent blocks to upgrade their homes.

SRO RESIDENCE
Brooklyn, New York
Architrope, Architect

By:
C.A.P.

When the New York State Office of Mental Health started a new program of
``service-enriched'' single-room-occupancy (SRO) housing in 1992, architect
Jonathan Kirschenfeld convinced the agency that new construction would be
more practical than renovating old buildings. Because the program called
for buildings with 44 efficiency apartments, four married-couples
apartments, and such ``enriched'' services as counseling,
medication-management, and shared dining, Kirschenfeld argued it would be
difficult to fit all that into an existing building shell. With each
240-sq-ft apartment having its own full bathroom and kitchenette, the
plumbing requirements alone would have made converting an old structure a
nightmare, says the architect. Flexibility was also a priority, since the
buildings would house special populations ranging from the mentally ill to
drug abusers. Three years later, the state agency was eliminated by a new
Republican governor, but a prototype SRO, designed by Kirschenfeld's firm
Archi-trope and run by a non-profit organization called Services for the
Underserviced, opened in Brooklyn. The five-story, 24,200-sq-ft building
was finished on time for $2.83 million ($117 a square foot). Using a simple
bearing-block-and-concrete-plank structure and an efficient double-loaded
corridor plan for the apartment floors, the architect was able to lavish
attention on a few important features--such as a finely detailed brick
facade with 8-inch reveals around all openings. The result is a building
that projects a sense of depth and solidity. Inside, the first floor is
devoted to public spaces that benefit greatly from 11-foot ceilings, wood
wainscoting, and furniture designed by the architect. By providing an
attractive lounge and dining room overlooking a rear yard, the building
encourages residents to practice their social skills, while allowing them
to retreat to their own rooms. In the apartments, 8-foot-6-inch ceilings
give some lift to the small units.

LOS ESTEROS APARTMENTS
San Jose, California
Fisher-Friedman Associates, Architect

By:
C.A.P.

Built by a local non-profit organization, First San Jose Housing, Los
Esteros Apartments brings the best ideas of market-rate development to the
affordable end of the housing spectrum. In fact, according to Rodney
Friedman, the partner-in-charge of design, the eight apartment buildings
here are better built and have better finishes than most market-rate
projects. How is this possible? By eliminating a private developer's
overhead and profit margin, by getting the city of San Jose to supply some
of the up-front equity to reduce the construction mortgage, and by using
low-income housing tax credits, First San Jose Housing was able to apply
more money to the buildings themselves. ``It was great working with First
San Jose,'' says Friedman. ``Their only goal was to build the best project,
not to make money.'' Designed to create a sense of community, the project
includes a 3,000-square-foot clubhouse with swimming pool, a playground for
tots, and communal green areas. In addition, some of the apartment
buildings have front stoops for socializing and all look onto a central
allee landscaped with palm trees. All of the residential buildings are
four-story wood-frame structures. Five are built on concrete slabs, while
three are built over a single level of half-sunken parking. Occupying a
7.7-acre site in a suburban part of a redevelopment district, the project
includes 246 apartments: 12 one-bedroom units of 600 square feet, 150
two-bedroom units of about 850 square feet, and 84 three-bedroom units
ranging from 1,104 to 1,400 square feet. In addition to the communal
outdoor areas, the project provides a private outdoor space for every
apartment--either a patio or a terrace. Top-floor apartments have
extra-height living rooms, some with 14-foot ceilings. To break down the
scale of each building and give it the look of a series of smaller attached
structures, the architects used a variety of exterior materials (horizontal
wood siding, cedar shingles, painted wood railings) and colors.

WASHINGTON MONUMENTS: BATTLES OVER THE MALL
A frenzy of monument building is sweeping through the nation's capital.
Roger Lewis takes stock of the latest additions and what's to come.

By:
By Roger K. Lewis

Last July, on a hot, humid day in Washington, D.C., the Korean War Veterans
Memorial was dedicated. Over six years had elapsed since the spring 1989
national design competition was won by a team of architects and landscape
architects based at Pennsylvania State University.

That team proposed building a metaphoric landscape of expansive triangular
plazas, groves of plane trees with canopies pruned into distorted shapes,
and a flag. Perhaps most important to the memorial imagery of this strongly
geometrical landscape, occupying the southwest corner of the Mall opposite
the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, would be a column of 38 American soldiers
frozen in a moment of convergence on their single destination, the flag. It
was a memorial design intended to be at once representational and symbolic,
a commentary on both the costly horror of war and the honor of combatants
who, when called, serve their nation dutifully and unselfishly to wage
war.

After receiving their prize money, the winning designers--Burns Lucas, Len,
Lucas, Pennypacker Oberholtzer (referred to as BL3PO, then BL3 when
Pennypacker Oberholtzer dropped out)--were paired up as ``design
consultants'' with Cooper-Lecky Architects, the Washington firm designated
as architect-of-record. Cooper-Lecky, having worked previously with Maya
Lin in executing the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, had the technical expertise
and procedural experience needed to carry out the project.

But conflicts soon arose between the two design groups as substantial
changes were suggested by the Korean War Veterans Memorial Advisory Board,
numerous federal agencies with jurisdiction over the site, and
Cooper-Lecky. The changes sought to reduce the size and cost of the
memorial, simplify its overall composition, and improve circulation around
and through it. BL3 resisted many of the proposed modifications, claiming
that the integrity of their original design was being violated, that their
concept was being unreasonably compromised and watered down. Further, they
felt themselves being increasingly excluded from the design process.

The impasse led to BL3's complete withdrawal and subsequently to litigation
in federal court, which proved ultimately unsuccessful since the terms of
the competition guaranteed neither the faithful implementation of the
winning design nor the winners' participation in the post-competition
design process. Having become the sole architect, Cooper-Lecky then spent
three years working through multiple design variations. After many meetings
and trips back to the drawing board, they finally obtained approval of what
has now been built and dedicated.

Remnants of the competition-winning design can be found in the final
ensemble created by Cooper-Lecky, sculptor Frank C. Gaylord II, and
muralist Louis Nelson: the soldiers, reduced in number from 38 to 19, are
still marching toward a common objective, the flag; the ``field of
service'' occupied by the soldiers is triangular, reminiscent of the
competition-winning scheme's geometry; a grove of trees--lindens, not plane
trees--is an integral part of the ensemble, although its formal disposition
is different. Not derived from the competition-winning design is a
164-foot-long wall of polished black granite--can anyone doubt its source
of inspiration?--etched with the faces of support troops and terminating in
an elevated circular pool at the eastern vertex of the triangular field.

Metal soldiers in a Platonic landscape
   As shaped by Cooper-Lecky, the premiated design evolved into a memorial
smaller in size and more accessible to visitors both physically and
symbolically. Like the original BL3 design, the immaculately detailed
memorial's most arresting architectural quality results from compositional
tension: the larger-than-life, gun-metal-gray soldiers in motion, molded
softly and imprecisely of stainless steel, looking anxious, weary,
determined; and a highly abstracted, almost Platonic landscape crafted of
hard-edged, machined slabs of granite--long rectangular wall, linear
plinths, a circular pool, furrows in the triangular field defined by
parallel strips of polished stone separating rows of juniper.

The Korean War Veterans Memorial has been enthusiastically welcomed and
generally praised by the public, both for its design and its craftsmanship.
But this writer cannot look at it without thinking that something went
awry, that both the design process and final product were flawed.

Cleansing a project's design history
   As I walked around the memorial, its debt to its precursor was
unmistakable. I kept recalling the BL3 scheme, as if I were looking not at
an original work of design, but rather at a radically remodeled version of
a work by someone else, a work beaten into acceptable shape by its
architect and by the several official bodies with absolute dominion over
this landscape--the Korean War Memorial Advisory Board, the American Battle
Monuments Commission, the National Capital Memorial Commission, the
National Park Service, and the Commission of Fine Arts.

And how thoroughly the memorial's design history had been cleansed, there
being little official mention of the design competition, the conceptual
starting point for the design, and little credit given to BL3 for its
contribution of the germinal ideas.

Few who see the memorial will care that its creation was plagued by years
of controversy and compromise. Visitors will like its relatively small
scale and its unambiguous figurative and representational messages. They
will not pose questions: Why so many soldiers? (Nineteen is half of 38, a
dubiously meaningful reference to the parallel dividing North and South
Korea.) Why the number of disparate elements? Why the wall lamely echoing
the Vietnam Veterans Memorial? Why, next to the flag toward which the
soldiers are struggling, a round pool into which the end of the etched wall
plunges? Why isn't the flag plaza less encumbered, surrounded instead by
open space no less capable of evoking contemplation than a pool of water?

To put the Korean War Veterans Memorial in perspective, let's consider the
painful evolution of another project--the FDR Memorial. Four decades after
Congress set up the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial Commission,
construction finally began in 1994 in West Potomac Park, near the Tidal
Basin.
A detailed chronology of this design saga requires several pages, but
highlights include: a 1960 design competition won by Pedersen & Tilney;
years of design revisions with several cycles of approval and rejection
between 1961 and 1965; selection of Marcel Breuer to develop a new design,
accepted by the FDR Memorial Commission but rejected in 1967 by the
Commission of Fine Arts; dormancy during the Vietnam War; selection in 1974
of landscape architect Lawrence Halprin to design the memorial as part of a
27-acre park, with the design--including sculptures--developed and approved
between 1975 and 1978; design modified to significantly reduce costs,
approved in 1979; in 1981, resolutions introduced in Congress authorizing
construction of the memorial; further design by Halprin to obtain detailed
cost estimates in 1984, after which the project again lay dormant until
1988, when Rep. Claude Pepper, the new Memorial Commission chairman,
reactivated the project; still more design changes approved in 1990; at
last, a 1991 groundbreaking ceremony, followed by a $10-million capital
campaign to augment the $42 million in funds provided by Congress, with
construction finally starting in 1994.

A monument to overdesign
   The ultimate FDR Memorial irony is that Roosevelt himself asked that no
such memorial be built, a reflection of his discomfort with idolization and
his concerns that grandiose memorials can exaggerate, obscure, or
oversimplify history. Unfortunately, his wishes were ignored, and his
reasoning may be vindicated. The FDR Memorial, costing over $50 million, is
a monument to overdesign, a landscape predicated on the notion that bigger
must be better.

The memorial expropriates far too much public land--nearly eight acres of
West Potomac Park. Entailing an 800-ft-long procession through four outdoor
garden rooms, it is replete with landscaping and meandering rectilinear
walls, numerous water features, sculptures by a half dozen artists, and
extensive narrative inscriptions and quotations. It's not that a garden
couldn't be an appropriate memorial, nor that pieces of Halprin's design
aren't attractive. But the size of this sprawling, historically didactic
ensemble is excessive, notwithstanding the significance of FDR's presidency
encompassing the Depression and World War II.

Commemorating this president and those dozen years could be accomplished
more forcefully and succinctly, in keeping with FDR's wishes, were the
memorial's physical form and energy more concentrated in the Mall
landscape.

Further, looking into the future with a perspective that spans centuries
instead of decades of history, and considering the finiteness of the Mall,
it seems questionable to dedicate so much of that precious landscape to one
individual and only 12 years of 20th-century history. How and where will we
commemorate the important individuals and events of the 21st, 24th, or 30th
century?

More memorials are already in the pipeline, among them the Women in
Military Service to America Memorial, for which ground has been broken, an
Air Force memorial, a World War II memorial, and a memorial to Dr. Martin
Luther King, Jr. Countless others have been proposed, abandoned, or built
elsewhere. Can anyone doubt that countless more will be proposed in the
future?

Bureaucracy and democracy in action
   Why has creating a memorial in Washington become so arduous and
contentious? And how can designers preserve the integrity of their original
designs, given so complex a process?

Building memorials in Washington is, in fact, symptomatic of what happens
today in state, county, and municipal jurisdictions throughout the United
States. As architects know all too well, constructing anything in the
public domain, be it a memorial or a library or a bus depot, involves more
``cooks in the kitchen'' than ever before--more governmental and citizen
review agencies, more public hearings, more permits, and more contradictory
opinions about design. Consequently, the implementation process has become
more time-consuming, more expensive, and more likely to yield unfortunate
design compromises. This is bureaucracy and democracy in action, the result
of a process involving a diverse citizenry armed with diverse points of
view. How much easier was the architect's monument-building task in
previous centuries when only a single patron had to be courted and
satisfied.

Further worsening matters, political correctness can enter the design
process, often conflicting directly with esthetic aspirations. Memorial
commissioners and other review officials are especially sensitive about
memorial constituents--such as veterans and their families--and how the
public in general might interpret a memorial's design.

Both explicit and implicit symbolism in commemorative structures embue them
with great meaning. Yet since people readily ``deconstruct'' and find
unintended symbolism in works of art, a design with potentially
controversial overtones inevitably is challenged. Maya Lin's Vietnam
Veterans Memorial--its black-granite walls descending below grade and, to
some, suggesting condemnation rather than commemoration--epitomizes a
structure inviting negative interpretations. Amazingly, Lin's design
changed little from design-competition concept to realization--a tribute to
her remarkable tenacity.

Design competitions are a favorite and seemingly appropriate strategy for
designing memorials, but they pose problems. Improperly managed, or without
a well-written program and insightful jury, they rarely succeed. And timing
is always problematic. Memorial sponsors want a design concept early on to
catalyze fund raising. But because construction cannot begin without funds
and design approvals in place, years can elapse between the conclusion of a
design competition and the beginning of construction. As the FDR Memorial
illustrates, much can happen during this interval to affect the design:
costs rise, esthetic values shift, public perceptions change. A trendy,
winning design may have a short shelf life. What was embraced one year
might be rejected a few years later.

Jockeying for position on the Mall
   One final question is worth asking. Why has memorial fever seemed to
intensify during the closing decades of the 20th century? [See RECORD,
October 1995, page 9.] This is a question that clearly preoccupied members
of Congress in 1986 when they adopted stricter memorial building criteria.
There seems to be rising group consciousness among Americans about their
group's special history, their unique experiences and struggles both in war
and peace. Moreover, the number of distinct ``groups'' lobbying for
memorial sites is likewise rising. Perhaps it's the approach of a new
millenium. Yet this is not really a new phenomenon--memorial building
frenzies have followed all major wars, going back to the American
Revolution.

America's capital with its extraordinary public landscape will always be
the preferred setting for national memorials. But because the Mall is
limited in size and, in its present form, less than 100 years old, one can
visualize it becoming cluttered with memorials during the next century.
What then would remain for the centuries to follow?

Americans must identify and embrace sites in other locales for
commemorative structures. Otherwise, an excess of memorials built on or
around the Mall will detract from and devalue those that are most sacred,
the few that truly deserve to occupy the pantheon.

HOLL TURNS GREEN IN VIRGINIA

Steven Holl Architects will design an 11,000-sq-ft classroom and studio

ARCHITECTURE AS REMEDY

A competition for housing in North Philadelphia tries to heal a destitute
neighborhood with good architecture. Sponsored by the Foundation for
Architecture, the Francisville Housing competition challenged local
architects to come up with humane solutions for a site that the
Philadelphia Housing Authority plans to use for subsidized housing. A first
prize of $5,000 went to Cassway Albert, Ltd. for a proposal that included
housing units in an L-shape around communal gardens. Se-cond prize went to
Mike Rosen and Associates and merit awards to Dan Peter Kopple &
Associates, Joseph A. Serratore Architect & Associates, and Design
Management Solutions Unlimited.

TSCHUMI ABSTRACTS MCKIM, MEAD, & WHITE'S PLAN FOR COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY

By:
Nicolai Ouroussoff

(New York CIty)
Bernard Tschumi, who as an architect is best known for his Parc de la
Villette follies in Paris, has resurrected a circa 1870s McKim, Mead, &
White campus plan for Columbia University in his design of the school's new
student center. Tschumi, dean of the University's graduate school of
architecture, has teamed up with Gruzen Samton to produce Lerner Hall,
which adheres to the original plan with three distinct volumes. Scheduled
to open in 1999, it will contain an auditorium, movie theater, radio
station, and student clubs and mailboxes.

A BIRD-LIKE STRUCTURE RISES FROM THE RUINS

By:
N.O.

(New York City)
Santiago Calatrava's design for a restaurant pavilion on the southern tip
of Roosevelt Island is the latest tentative step in the rehabilitation of
Southpoint: the old island asylum, called the Octagon, has been stabilized
and plans are afoot to build Louis Kahn's proposed memorial park.
Calatrava's design takes the form of a glass and steel cocoon. A moving
``brise soleil'' roof encloses the structure at night like two giant wings
and playfully manipulates light and shadow. A stone base is made up of
ruins from a hospital previously on the site.

DOCTOR CHALLENGES ARCHITECTS

By:
S.A.K.

(San Diego)
A dire picture of American medicine was painted by Patch Adams, M.D., in
his keynote address to the 8th Symposium on Healthcare Design, sponsored by
The Center for Health Design, founded and headed by architect Wayne Ruga.
Adams cited high cost and dehumanization as crucial areas where architects
must work to make a difference. Berkeley professor Clare Cooper Marcus and
landscape designer Marni Barnes launched their long-awaited report, Gardens
in Healthcare Facilities. The report cites growing evidence that gardens
have a major therapeutic impact on the healing process as an extension of
traditional healthcare therapies. For copies, priced at $27, call The
Center at 510/370-0345.

STANDARD DATA GETS DATA STANDARDS
To realize the full promise of computers in architectural practice, a wide
range of manufacturer and price information is finally being computerized
in a standard way.

By:
By Steven S. Ross

As we've been saying for some time, the full promise of computers in
architectural practice can only be fulfilled if a wide range of
manufacturer and price information is computerized in a standard format.
Once that happens, data can be more easily exchanged among various sectors
of the construction industry.

The two biggest questions about that computerization--who will handle the
job of computerization, and how will it be standardized--were answered in
part over the past two months.

Autodesk, the people who bring you Auto-CAD, have been near the center of
all of developing the standards. With the help of several major information
providers--including the Sweet's Group at the McGraw-Hill
Companies--Autodesk will be publishing a ``Design and Construction
Library'' of ``intelligent'' digital data.

Sweet's has been putting vendor material on CD-ROM for some time. In fact,
it announced a service to prepare such material for vendors this past June.
Autodesk's Data Publishing group started its Mechanical Library last March.
That effort was, in many ways, the first example of intelligent digital
content for design professionals.

But the architectural world poses far more problems than mechanical
engineering--more products by smaller vendors, combined in more ways and
under more varied conditions. Thus, Autodesk is cooperating with a range of
data publishers that have construction-industry experience.

Sweet's is producing a CD-ROM series for Autodesk's Data Publishing Group
that will contain data on building products and equipment, in
pre-formatted, dimensioned CAD files. Sweet's research shows that about a
third of all drafting time is spent re-drawing building components and
products that have already been selected and specified.

Sweet's has long required that manufacturers put their materials into a
standard print format for inclusion in its catalogs. But doing the same for
computer formats requires even more cooperation from vendors. The vendors
certainly can distribute independently of Sweet's, and many do. But if they
don't comply with the Sweet's standards for their details, they may be shut
out of many designers' decisions.

R.S. Means, a subsidiary of Southam Construction Information Network, will
produce CD-ROMs that link to AutoCAD, providing what could become the
standard way to link objects (doors, windows, wall materials, and so forth)
in a drawing with cost data. Again, the potential for increased accuracy
and decreased time spent is high. James D'Arezzo, vice president of
Autodesk's Data Management Group, estimates, ``AEC professionals spend as
much as 25 percent of each day documenting design decisions and change
orders.'' Being able to update costs--if not all costs--instantaneously as
changes are contemplated modifies the way design professionals approach the
whole process.

Another Southam affiliate, MSA (Manufacturers' Survey Associates, Inc.) is
also joining up to produce hvac, plumbing, and electrical-design data for
CD-ROM. So is a more traditional publisher, John Wiley & Sons.

Thus, makers of building products and traditional data publishers, rather
than software companies, will put all of this in computer form. But the
traditional publishers and the product vendors must cooperate with software
companies. Otherwise, everything won't work together.

But will it all work together anyway? And what information should sellers
of building products include in their computer files? That has also been
answered, in large part by the industry push to standardize computer
``objects.''

The Industry Alliance for Interoperability is trying to standardize what
information, exactly, a standard object will contain at a minimum--the
so-called ``industry foundation classes'' for such objects as doors and
windows. Such information could include materials, colors, weight, and fire
ratings as well as dimensions [RECORD, August 1995, pages 32-34].
Autodesk's largest competitor, MicroStation's Bentley, joined the alliance
last October. IAI was originally championed by Autodesk, but is now an
independent organization.

With Bentley joining the alliance, it will ultimately mean that ``objects''
could work with both major families of CAD software--AutoCAD and
MicroStation. We say ``could'' because many vendors of add-on software have
yet to sign on. Many have, and Bentley's action, along with various data
publishers' willingness to bring product manufacturers along, should
accelerate the trend. It should also bring many other CAD vendors into the
fold.

All this won't happen overnight, of course. In fact, release of the first
batch of ``foundation classes'' was supposed to take place last fall. It is
imminent as we go to press. And, although publishers' automated
``intelligent'' catalogs are released this year, it will be some time
before they will be fully compliant with object classes (there won't even
be standards for many products this year) and before CAD software will
fully interact with the objects.

But the road ahead now looks rather clear--and wide.

CHEAP TOOLS
Here are three graphics packages that won't break the bank, but may make
your office more efficient--and your life easier as well.

Visio Technical 4.0

Vendor: Visio Corporation, 520 Pike St., Suite 1800, Seattle, WA 98101,
206/521-4500, fax 206/521-4501, CompuServe GO VISIO, Microsoft Network
Visio Forum, http://www.visio.com.

Equipment required: Computer capable of running Windows 3.1, Windows NT
3.51 or higher, or Windows 95. Full installation takes 30 MB of disk
space.

Cost:$249 (street price closer to $150).

Imagine ``drawing'' by dragging pre-defined shapes onto the page and
connecting them. That's what Visio is all about. When it first appeared in
1992, Visio was aimed more at simple but annoying jobs such as drawing
organization charts. With Technical Version 4.0, it becomes a full-featured
tool, particularly useful for facilities management, landscaping, HVAC, and
other tasks that require repetitive drafting work.

Each shape (Visio 4.0 comes with about 2,000 of them) has data behind
it--data that governs its behavior. You can create an unlimited number of
new shapes as well, either from scratch, by modifying old shapes, or by
importing drawings or symbols into Visio. AutoCAD symbol libraries can
become libraries of Visio shapes.

The data is in what Visio calls a Shape Sheet--there's one for each shape.
It can contain formulas to govern the behavior of shapes as you scale them.
Thus, you can set up a desk to stretch without getting wider, or a table to
get larger without enlarging the associated chairs.

As you might expect, there's full import and export of AutoCAD DXF and DWG
(binary) files, as well as IGES and Illustrator. There's import of
CorelDraw, Micrografx DRW, and many standard formats such as TIF and PCX.
But Visio throws in some tricks as well. You can, for instance, assign the
same object to more than one layer in Visio. You can also use a Visio
drawing on top of an AutoCAD drawing--for redlining or perhaps to add
furniture to an office plan.

By the way, Visio used to call itself Shapeware--same company, new name.

Manuals: On-line for using Visio itself. Printed 420-page manual for
developing your own solutions--by creating new shapes and so forth.
Ease of use: Trivial to draw with; creating something as sophisticated as a
facilities--management layout requires lots of work. Wide choice of
interfaces--you can make it look like Microsoft Office, Novell
PerfectOffice, or Lotus SmartSuite.

Error-trapping: Excellent.

XCAD 3.0

Vendor: Xitron Software Corporation, 1500 Chiquita Center, 250 East Fifth
St., Cincinnati, OH 45202. 513/762-7638, fax 513/662-3440, 800/817-8172.

Equipment required: Computer capable of running Windows NT or Windows
3.1/3.11. A fully tested 32-bit Windows 95 version should be available by
the time this review appears. Pentium processor strongly recommended.

Price:$495; street price about $420.

Looking for an easy-to-use 3D CAD program with good AutoCAD compatibility?
XCAD may be for you. Its major weakness as a 3D sketch tool is that it
lacks boolean capability--you can't use one shape to add to or hollow out
another. There's no binary (DWG) import or export in the version we
reviewed, but DWG, DXG, and IGES exchange is in the 32-bit version. Many of
our users found it a delight to draw with anyway, on fast computers.

You get continuous shading with multiple light sources (LightWorks was
added this fall), up to eight viewports (windows) on screen at once, and a
command emulator that makes it similar to AutoCAD, MicroStation, or Generic
CADD.

XCAD is also being marketed as the drawing engine in others' specialized
disk packages. It supports referenced drawings and has good
surface-modeling tools (most of the NURBS set). There's a macro-language
and a development kit available that can be used to add functionality to
XCAD.

Manuals: Separate paperbacks for getting started, tutorial, and a detailed
user guide/command reference.

Ease of use: Excellent 3D interface; slow on an older non-Pentium machine.
Error-trapping: Unlimited undo function. You can password-protect a drawing
on top of any network administrative scheme; if you lose the password,
there's no ''back door'' to get back your work.

Planix 3D Exterior Designer 1.0

Equipment required: Any computer that can run any version of Windows 3.1 or
higher. Must have separate math coprocessor if CPU is 386 or 486SX. Display
capable of at least 256 colors strongly recommended.

Vendor: Softdesk Retail Products, 10725 Ambassador Drive, Kansas City, MO
64153.

Price: Street price roughly $50.

Here's a great (and cheap) tool for ``brick and stick'' designers to lay
out a home, landscape it, and play around with its exterior finish.
Actually, it's meant for amateurs--non-architects--but you don't have to
tell anyone.

The interface is ingenious. For instance, you lay out your building in plan
by adjusting an existing footprint (there are many to choose from) by
pulling on its ``handles.'' Each story, and the roof, can have a different
footprint to allow overhangs and setbacks.

As you work on each item--plan, elevation, landscaping, roof--placing trim
and windows or doors and so forth, Planix automatically groups things into
layers for you. The package comes with plenty of symbols--trees and
windows, for instance--and allows you to create or add more. When you want
to visualize the results, click on ``render'' to get an image.

The underlying software engine is Drafix, one of the first and best
Windows-based CAD packages. (Softdesk's retail division was Foresight,
Drafix's developer.) But you can't directly save into an AutoCAD- or
MicroStation-compatible file format. Files can be saved as bitmaps, or for
Planix Home 3D (it does the interiors). That's the only real drawback.

Manuals: Straightforward 55-page reference and tutorial.

Ease of use: Trivial. Fun. You won't break the training budget on this
one.

Error-trapping: You can place the wrong thing in the wrong place, but
fixing it is a snap. You can also place a misleading filename extension on
a filename.


Illustration(s):
Illustration: Two Screens: Visio Technical 4.0: Note the kidney-shaped
swimming pool and the underlying ``shapesheet.'' Changing the sheet changes
the image and vice-versa. On-line help is context-sensitive and well
written. You can vary the placement of the windows on the screen as well.
The icons in this case are in the same style as Microsoft Office.

Illustration: Screen: XCAD 3.0: There's a full range of 3D as well as 2D
drawing, dimensioning, and shading tools. You can use the ``Cartesian''
window to change the viewpoint or to bring a 2D plane into the same
orientation as the screen for easy editing.

Illustration: Screen: Planix 3D Exterior: Designer 1.0 Wireframe and
rendered version of house.

WEAKENING CONSTRUCTION IN LATE 1995

Improvement in multi-family housing was not enough to offset overall
construction-volume declines in recent months. Retail and warehouse sectors
have slackened, reflecting slower sales, but offices--a recent source of
growth--also slipped 10 percent last month. Declining contracting for
schools, hospitals, and detention facilities caused the institutional
sector to fall back 14 percent. In 1996, an interest-rate cut might boost
single-family volume. Federal budget decisions will most affect volatile
non-building construction.

NEEDED: LOWER RISKS, MORE R&D

A survey of construction-industry professionals from more than 20 countries
revealed a number of trends that bar innovation in construction. Recurring
items are risk/liability and R&D-related concerns, including problems with
technology transfer. The pressures of project construction time were seen
as important. Leadership was flagged in the management area. Respondents
were particularly concerned about project delivery.

Building codes and standards were thought impediments to improving
materials and systems and design technology. Respondents were also asked
about public-policy barriers. They cited environmental regulations, lack of
leadership, and adversarial relationships as chief barriers. Trends
respondents thought important, though not necessarily barriers, include
computers, globalization, and environmental consciousness. Findings form
the basis for a symposium, ``Engineering and Construction for Sustainable
Development in the 21st Century,'' Washington, D.C., February 4-8.

CAN ARCHITECTURE AND POLITICS MIX?
As government building programs shrink, it's worth considering how
architects can better use the political process--and what the process says
about architects and their place in the community.

By:
James S. Russell

It's an election year. While these four words rightly evoke groans from
those not addicted to the endless campaigning and information-free
discourse endemic to political life today, there's no better time to
consider the role architects can, do, and should play in the political
process. Further, this political season begins just one year after a cadre
of candidates was chosen in states and Congress pledged to move political
power to the states.

Most of the attention-getting debate this year has been at the national
level, as the budget, regulations, and such massive programs as Medicare
and welfare have come under intense scrutiny. And the big Capitol Hill
battles have pushed aside for now issues that most affect building design
(tort reform, qualifications-based selection). Bricks-and-mortar building
programs have been substantially cut, however [RECORD, November 1995, page
33]. Even if, as many in the new Congress advocate, programs are eliminated
and others largely shift to states, government still significantly
determines the circumstances under which buildings are designed and built.
Can design professionals better use the political process to realize their
goals? Perhaps more fundamentally, is the shift from national to local and
the move to greater privatization good for architects?

``Architects' interests don't really fall along party lines,'' observes
Nancy Somerville, vice president, state and local government affairs at the
AIA. ``What does follow party lines is the anti-regulatory environment and
the pro-business environment. These agendas mean there's a greater
likelihood of tort reform but, on the other hand, a resistance to uniform
building codes and more efforts to consolidate or defund agencies like
state licensing boards.'' Although much of the political drama is in
Washington, D.C., ``Most legislation where rubber hits the road in terms of
architects' income,'' Somerville says, ``takes place at the state level.''

What government is doing to design
   Somerville and Daniel Gross, AIA program director, state and local
government affairs, outline these key challenges:

Procurement: As many as 14 states will face challenges to
qualifications-based consultant selection criteria. Also, although AIA
policy accepts design/build for appropriate projects, AIA is challenging
design/build procurement when it is cost-driven, not qualifications-driven,
and when a high level of uncompensated work is required for selection. Some
states, ``unhappy with the level of litigation on projects,'' but also
``not managing the process well,'' says Somerville, see alternate-delivery
methods as a panacea.

Professional licensing: The deregulatory mood, says Somerville, has spurred
a ``large-scale attack on the regulation of professions.'' She says critics
claim ``that most state licensing exists for protection of the regulated
and not the good of society.'' Though she feels that architects will have
to fight battles on this front (10 states face ``sunset'' of licensing laws
in 1996), she doesn't see the licensing of architects as threatened.
Indeed, 12 states may add a licensing category--through certification or
title laws for interior designers.

The definition of architectural practice (where, typically, engineers seek
authority to design a wider range of building types) and the overlap of
engineering with architecture ``top the list of licensing-law concerns'' in
the states, says Somerville [RECORD, July 1995, page 27].

Liability and tort reform: Professionals are seeking ``certificate of
merit'' legislation in many states, which would require early independent
examination of whether suits against architects (among others) have merit.
Some states have exposed architects and engineers to liability for
third-party suits. This permits injured workers--prevented from suing
contractors by workers' compensation statutes--to seek recompense from the
design team. Other states have relieved architects from such liability.
Tort reforms sought by A/Es include caps on punitive damages and on
joint-and-several liability. The latter can make the ``deep pockets''
architect (or the firm's insurer) liable for damages far in excess of
proven culpability.

Selling architecture on Capitol Hill
   In Washington, the budget-cutting vogue brings bad news for architects,
especially for firms that have been doing big GSA courthouse and
office-building projects. It's not only GSA budgets that have been cut,
though. Assisted-housing programs at HUD, embassies, R&D (which supports
much campus research-lab construction), transit and passenger rail, and
Veterans Administration hospitals have all been slashed. Of those
categories where spending is rising, only slightly higher funds for
airports and dollars for military-housing improvements are likely to
directly benefit architects.

Should architects storm Congress' ramparts? It's not AIA's style. ``We play
with the deck we're dealt,'' says Al Eisenberg, director, federal
legislative affairs at AIA. Don't mount a monumental (and probably losing)
battle to restore cuts in building programs, he says. ``Congress believes
that the tax code is the way to get things done rather than categoric
grants or block grants. If the arena to play in is the tax code, we'll play
in that arena.'' Thus AIA is vigorously defending the Low Income Housing
Tax Credit and tax credits for historic preservation (both of which will
likely remain intact), and promoting the Commercial Revitalization Tax Act
targeted at distressed urban areas and supporting a tax credit for those
who restore historic homes (both an uphill fight).

Clout through community design
   Architects have influence in Congress, claims Eisenberg, because they
help to make ``livable communities.'' That architects are able to
facilitate public participation as well as build projects that tangibly
benefit towns and cities is crucial, because ``all kinds of legislation
flows to communities.'' He cites, for example, ``the transportation
enhancements'' set-aside from the surface transportation program--part of
what is popularly known as ISTEA [RECORD, June 1994, pages 86-89].

The community-oriented focus is also seen as critical by Harvey Gantt, of
Gantt Huberman architects in Charlotte, N.C. Gantt, perhaps America's most
prominent architect-politician says architects have much to offer,
especially locally: ``Architects have an ability to visualize; they can
understand the physical impact of social decisions. When I served on the
city council and as mayor of Charlotte, I thought I could visualize impact
of a highway more readily than a colleague who is a sales person or a
lawyer.'' (Gantt has also served as Charlotte's mayor pro-tem.)

That architects can create a new vision for communities is also key to what
Eisenberg says are the excellent prospects for one little-publicized
legislative initiative. The work of architects, planners, engineers, and
landscape architects in Hurricane Andrew, in Florida; the giant 1993 floods
in the Midwest; and the recent earthquakes and wildfires in California has
convinced many in Congress that disaster-mitigation planning is critical in
avoiding gigantic losses [RECORD, June 1994, pages 38-41]. In return for
offering government backing to a federally chartered private insurance
corporation, at-risk states will have to make comprehensive
disaster-mitigation plans and put in place new or upgraded zoning and
codes. Both the planning process and the construction upgrading involved
should generate substantial work for architects. That the bill has 220
House co-sponsors is important, says Eisenberg, because ``this is a
Congress that is not about telling states what to do.''

Architect as local peace-maker
   Many architects see expanded opportunities if the shift to local
government and privatization continues. They agree with proponents of small
government that the lower taxes permitted by less government translate into
more money deployed more efficiently by the private sector. Indeed, there
has been a long-term shift of U.S. architects' clients from government
(still the dominant patron in much of Europe) to the private sector.

Removing federal-government regulatory burdens may not change the life of
the average architect much, though. Architects frequently complain that the
thicket of local regulations, design-review, and community-review boards
through which even private-sector projects must pass too often saps
innovation--let alone excellence. Clients also often see such activities as
incidental and expensive barriers to the main event--designing buildings.

Dealing with community needs shouldn't be incidental, argues Dana Cuff,
associate professor at UCLA's Department of Architecture and Planning.
She's made a study of what she calls ``contentious development,'' and
observes that inevitably ``architecture ends up in the political realm,
when you talk about how architecture adds up to a city.'' Many architects
can bring highly developed design, graphics, and communication skills to
bear in community planning and design--skills developers, planners, and
real-estate professionals often lack.

Cuff looked at Riverside South, a gigantic urban development in New York
City first proposed by developer Donald Trump as Television City--a series
of dizzyingly huge towers that attracted fierce community opposition.
Architects, some of them working pro bono, collaborated with opponents,
and, ultimately, Trump's team. The scheme approved was smaller, and vastly
more public-oriented. And Trump learned that a less adversarial approach
can work.

``You can say New York is much better off in terms of quality of life for
having had this be a 10-year, political, drawn-out process,'' observes
Cuff. ``No developer would ever do this if not pressured to.'' While
joining the opposition may not win plaudits from potential clients, Cuff
feels architects' validity within the community is too often threatened
because ``people feel let down by architects and developers.'' She sees
great opportunity for architects able to help owners steer projects through
difficult community-review procedures (though getting paid for the effort
involved remains a hurdle). She argues, ``Architects are the kind of
professionals that can work through--competently and with a vision--complex
problems that have both physical and political dimensions.''

City builders vs privatized packagers
   The tensions that arise from the level of community consultation
required in many jurisdictions reflect themes in larger political debates.
When advocates for small-government gained momentum in the 1980s, for
example, they claimed that too many architects clung to an outmoded
big-government role as community master builder imposing a personal-taste
agenda on the public. Then, as architects moved away from urban design and
low-income housing to lushly funded museum projects and glitzy edge-city
mega-developments, community advocates said that the most prominent
practitioners had abdicated their professional authority, and deserved to
be considered mere packagers and stylists, pandering to the egos of
developers and companies at the public's expense.

This quandary for architects isn't going away; indeed, such arguments may
become more polarized, and architects may find it more difficult to have a
broad role in shaping communities while still realizing the needs and
aspirations of those paying the bills. Consider two scenarios: if
government is merely localized, rather than privatized on a large scale,
architects can continue to help government agencies create genuinely public
places. But when government is privatized, then private entities, however
public-spirited, become the clients, making the relationship between the
architect and the public one more step removed. When an architect works for
a developer hired to build public schools, for example, the developer sets
the priorities the architect must address rather than an agency or the
community. While a privatized entity can offer much more efficient
management and procurement, it may not feel charged to do what government
might do, such as look to locate a public facility in a neighborhood where
it can catalyze other development.

Can architecture survive expediency?
   It is also worth considering whether the extent to which government uses
architecture reflects on the profession. In FDR's era, for example,
architects were involved in work ranging from public hospitals to park
structures to bridges--even the great Hoover Dam. Though public works from
that era remain widely admired, today's no-frills approach has made the
multi-lane freeway running in a trench of precast-concrete sound barriers
the primary experience of the public realm. One could argue that the sorry
nature of much public work today reflects people's attitude toward
government, not architecture. But we shouldn't dismiss a more pessimistic
conclusion--that people no longer see design as a means of representing
their community's or their nation's aspirations. Do we need government
architecture (which is supposed to represent us all) to help validate the
profession in the eyes of the public?

Gantt, on the other hand, says the perception of public design ``goes up
and down with the community. Architects should be focused on quality of
life,'' he continues. ``We can influence what we're surrounded by: how you
reinforce neighborhoods, how you keep downtowns from being ghost towns
after dark.'' The more the public recognizes architects' positive
contribution to ``what it takes to produce that intangible--a city that
feels good to people,'' he says, the more the community will ask architects
to do.

Gantt urges architects to testify in front of planning committees, to be
involved in charettes or with community groups. ``When I sat on major
decisions on how Charlotte's downtown was going to develop or major
infrastructure developments, developers, bankers, and other people would be
there, but no architects were there talking about appropriateness.
Architects are not even thought about in that light.'' In public debates,
Gantt says, ``No one thinks twice about an up-and-coming lawyer appointed
to some board. An architect is a rarity, though, and there's no reason for
that. It's great to be thought a nice guy who builds buildings, but in
order to get clout one has to get one's hands quote dirty in the arena of
politics.''

The defensive nature of many of the battles architects fight--fee bidding;
the clients, engineers, and builders that think architectural design is at
best an add-on--may be inevitable in an ever-more competitive age, or it
may be evidence of a continued devaluation in status. Certainly in today's
political environment, where first cost is the chief value, architecture is
targeted. AIA's Eisenberg, like most architects, argues for the community
values that are represented through a selection process that focuses on
design excellence and by construction that uses stone or wood rather than
drywall and carpet in an important public place like a courthouse. In
pandering to those who claim all government spending is waste, however,
politicians regularly pick on the ``lavishness'' of materials that are
completely justifiable in life-cycle or other terms. In such an atmosphere,
only timid design makes it through.

Eisenberg, for one, sees the ``devolution'' of national standards and
programs as ``a rush to the bottom,'' where local expediency precludes
solutions to national problems. He sees it increasingly difficult ``to make
people understand what architecture does.''

Gantt says the purely cost-driven approach can be defused: ``I think
architects in places of prominence can make some solid arguments about the
appropriateness of architecture and its impact on our lives. And they can
win an argument on that level if costs and taxes are not the overriding
concern in the community.'' By being consistently involved in issues of
interest to the community, architects ``will have an audience who will
listen,'' Gantt says, when they try to make a case for a genuinely civic
architecture over a purely low-cost one. Gantt is making his own case by
running for the U.S. Senate in 1996.

for headline-seeking politicians. Also, if federal cuts create new burdens
for states and cities, locally funded schools and libraries, which have
been consistently strong types recently, could be hit..

CAD PRESENTATIONS GET REAL
Architects are increasingly turning computer savvy to imaging, offering
options conventional renderers can't--and stretching computing's
frontiers.

By:
By Ralph Grabowski

For the architect who does not have the time or the skill, there have
always been delineators and modelmakers to prepare handdrawn illustrations
and presentation models. Now, delineators have gone digital: they render 3D
CAD instead of illustrations; make animations instead of scale models.

Very often, it is the client who wants the rendering rather than the
architect. It is traditional for the client to pay for these as marketing
tools--to get governmental approvals, pre-lease the building, impress
potential investors. Most imaging firms concentrate on high-quality
renderings, since they have found these are the best way to get the design
idea across to the client.

While an animation is impressive, it tends to skip over details; plus, the
camera paths can be like a roller-coaster ride. Ayres Group, San Diego, a
firm specializing in animations, finds itself increasingly sought after by
international clients, according to Molly Scanlon, director, client
services.In deciding whether to commission an animation, she says, ``you
need to define a purpose and an audience.'' One area Ayres and others
concentrate on is presenting the impact of new development. Besides
describing the appearance of the design, computer images or animations can
readily show building heights and sight lines, view corridors, and other
designed responses to zoning and planning issues.

Some firms specialize in producing multi-media presentations. They package
sound, text, and images on the computer with Microsoft PowerPoint or
Astound presentation software. A speaker can show the images at meetings
using a notebook computer and LCD display panel (which transforms the
computer image into one that can be projected on a screen). Ayres Group's
Scanlon says ``During construction, we'll run our animations as an
information kiosk, instead of a `pardon our dust' sign, to explain to
visitors why they're being inconvenienced.'' Other firms offer
project-archiving services. They scan as-built paper drawings for storage
on CD-ROM or tape (for easy retrieval or conversion to CAD files), and make
a film or video record of built projects.

Raw materials
   Imaging services can start with hand-drawn sketches, design drawings,
and CAD files--whether 2D or 3D. To make the drawing or rendering, the
service must make a 3D CAD drawing of your project. Obviously, the less
work the service has to do, the less it costs, so it's to your benefit to
provide the project in electronic form. Among CAD files, the most common
format is AutoCAD DWG or DXF. You deliver the files on 3 1/2-in. diskette,
upload to a bulletin-board system, or e-mail the file directly through the
Internet or through an on-line service like CompuServe.

The right viewpoint
   Once the 3D model is constructed, other 3D data might be added, such as
digital terrain modeling (DTM)--the computer term for the site profile. You
can examine the model on-screen while an operator changes the angle,
viewpoint, and distance until you agree on the desired point of view. The
service will ask you for the colors and materials intended for the project.
It typically has a large selection of already-digitized materials. Many are
available commercially as ``clip-art libraries'' on CD-ROMs, such as
surface textures for granite, marble, masonry, tile, and carpet.

These items can be copied from the source and pasted into the rendering.
Items such as trees, seating, trash containers, automobiles, and people,
can also be added from standard clip-art libraries. If need be, a texture
can be created from scratch in three ways. Flat samples, such as tiles and
wallpaper, are digitized using a high-resolution, full-color, flatbed
scanner. For materials that can't be scanned, such as bricks, you can
photograph a sample, and use the Kodak PhotoCD process to create an
electronic image. As a last (labor-intensive) resort, the service can
create a surface texture by using a computer ``paint'' program. Whether
scanned or photographed, the digital images become ``texture maps'' applied
to the surface areas of the 3D drawing.

Since many digital-image firm principals are architects, they can produce
credible surface colors and textures, even if the design is at an early
stage and materials selection isn't final. Being digital, it's easy to
change the color and texture at a later stage in the project. For
animations, the client, architect, and imaging firm agree on the camera
path through the project.

With the model's 3D viewpoints established, the file is exported to a
rendering program like Autodesk's 3D Studio. Here, the texture maps are
applied, the lighting parameters are defined, and the rendering takes
place. The time it takes to render depends on the quality of rendering, the
complexity of the model, and the speed of the computer. An anti-aliased
Phong rendering (which includes textures, shadows, and lighting effects)
may take a few minutes. A four- to five-minute animation can take more than
two days to render on Ayres Group's 25 machines.

After the imaging firm applies the texture maps, the client and architect
are invited to approve the placement. It is at this point that you may
decide the colors or materials are not what was intended. Richard Buday, of
Archimage, Houston, tells the story of a designer client sitting in his
office with paint chips and swatches of vinyl and carpet. After the
operator rendered the image as directed, the designer exclaimed, ``No, no,
the colors need to be darker here and lighter there.'' Working together,
they changed the materials and re-rendered the scene until she was pleased.
The designer returned to her office to find materials matching the screen
colors.

While one can see the scale and relative amount of colors and textures in
such a rendering, the subtleties of color in the real world are not
accurately interpreted by the computer screen. The color you perceive is
altered by many environmental factors--time of day, weather, reflections
from moving objects, and the mix of light sources--that are hard to
simulate. Also, if the image is printed, the deviations from screen color
can be dramatic, unless screen and printer are carefully calibrated. The
efforts in the field of CAD and illumination have resulted in rendering
packages now capable of shadows, reflections, and accurate rendering of the
amount and color of light. Still, research has yet to give us tools to
present colors accurately on the screen and then output them identically on
any color printer.

The output
   The output from the computer is generally a high-resolution, true color,
Targa or TIFF file. The ``high resolution'' is on the order of 2,048 by
1,526 pixels, which is four times the resolution of a typical computer
screen. ``True color'' means the monitor is set to show up to 16.7 million
colors or 24-bit color depth. Such high resolution and color depth means
that the size of files is very large, on the order of 74MB uncompressed.
Compression techniques can reduce files to 4MB--still too large to fit on a
standard diskette. For this reason, you'll need to deliver files on a
Bernoulli disk or other large-capacity medium.

To get hard copy of the image, you normally work with yet another outside
agency. Reprographics firms can produce slides (using a digital film
recorder), 8 1/2 by 11 prints (using a digital printer), and 24- by 36-in.
posters (using a color inkjet plotter). Digital reprographics firms are so
common in all large cities that they often offer incentives for the
first-time customer.

Computer-imaging advantages
   Imaging firms say a single computer rendering has no cost or time
benefit over a single illustration created by hand. It probably takes just
as long and costs as much or more. The savings come when you make
additional scenes from the same model or make changes. After creating one
``database'' (the 3D CAD model), it's easy to create multiple views. Once
the lighting is set and textures applied, it's also easy to generate
additional scenes from other viewpoints. For traditional hand-drawn
renderings, the illustrator starts from scratch for every view.

What technology can't do
   David Burch, of Jenkins & Associates, an architectural firm in Calgary,
Alberta, points out an inconvenient aspect of computer imaging: the 3D
model must be complete. Otherwise surfaces don't meet and shadows fall
incorrectly. In a hand drawing, you can always place a tree or other visual
subterfuge to obscure the not-yet-designed elements.

The imaging firms consulted agreed that computers also cannot match the
feel and detail of a hand-made rendering. While it is easy for an artist to
paint individual leaves on a tree, the memory needed for a computer to draw
every part of a tree is tremendous. The file size become unmanageable and
rendering time excessive. Instead, the firms try to do 90 percent of the
work in the 3D model. Then they soften the hard lines and slick surfaces
using touch-up applications like Adobe PhotoShop and Fractal Design Corp.'s
Fractal Design Painter.

Burch warns that clients may see more in the hard lines and fully developed
models than is actually there. They perceive an early study as a design
cast in stone. Jenkins uses several techniques to make the computer image
seem more tentative: He adds a pastel wash to the background instead of
dropping in a photorealistic one; he makes the walls transparent so the
client can see into the building. And some programs permit the application
of the electronic equivalent of ``brush strokes'' to make the computer
image look more like a watercolor. (Burch estimates 10 percent of his time
is spent in PhotoShop.)

Similarly, computer animations, once the image sequence has been recorded,
don't permit other viewpoints--at least until virtual reality becomes
practical. Still, animation lets people see the project from a realistic
viewpoint, rather than the helicopter viewpoint of physical models. You can
choose the way you view a physical model, but they're fragile and hard to
move around. For very large projects, such as the vast new cities being
built in China and Thailand, animation becomes the only practical method
for understanding the proposed site.

Computer imaging's cutting edge
   There's a consensus that virtual reality is still not worth pursuing at
present. The head-mounted display, data glove, and body suit environment,
while immersive, provide a rather crude image--even now, seven years after
work began on the technology. Robert Jacobson, of Worldesign, Inc.,
Seattle, builds virtual rooms by making spaces of projection screens that
allow you to be surrounded by a virtual scene. ``Ours is low resolution,
but you move through at a natural pace. Others are high resolution, but
slower,'' he says, adding that faster machines available as early as next
year will make a significant difference. The University of New Lisbon, in
Portugal, he says, is pioneering uses of 3D modeling for geographical
information systems (GIS), which could have broad application in design and
planning.

Increasingly, you can choose the direction you'll move through a scene,
like the popular computer game, Myst. Apple Computer's QuicktimeVR lets the
viewer move 360 deg. around a single viewpoint (http://www.ap-ple.com).
``We're moving into interactive, full-immersion spaces and full-motion,''
says Lance Hammer, whose firm, Simulacra, West Hollywood, Calif., uses
powerful Silicon Graphics Workstations to run high-end programs like Alias
Power animator and Pixar Renderman (the product behind the film Toy Story).
``Pure interactivity is coming very quickly.'' Hammer's firm, which began
using computer visualization in architecture, moved away from buildings to
movies and advertising, but now finds itself returning to buildings--with a
twist. A project for Dreamworks--still mostly under wraps--envisions a
``real'' architectural threshold to a virtual, but architectural space.
Hammer's firm is designing both.

The purchase by Microsoft of the French workstation package Softimage, he
says, may soon bring extremely fast tools to desktop computers. Silicon
Graphics competes, he says, ``by releasing something really incredible
every year.''

The Internet's World Wide Web is already being used as an advertising
medium and an e-mail link. Publishers Depot at http://www.publishers
depot.com offers stock photos, maps, audio clips, video footage, fonts, and
works of art for browsing and purchase. Virtual-reality modeling language
(VRML) offers even greater on-line potential. Using simple viewer software
(usually offered free), you can move around a 3D object posted on the Web.
Elements of the scene need not be located all on the same Internet site,
which could mean that the model could be worked on and viewed by numerous
parties working independently.

Today, the Internet's bandwidth is too low for this kind of interactivity.
(Though Caligari offers ``3D home worlds'' at http://www.caligari.com/.) By
the end of the decade, such collaboration should be more mainstream. One
ambitious project is VirtualSOMA, an attempt to model part of downtown San
Francisco south of Market Street using VRML at http://project9/soma.html.
By using a VRML viewer, such as InterVista's WorldView, you walk through
and fly around the district.

What should computer imaging cost?
   No conventions appear to exist for pricing. A Canadian imaging firm drew
up a proposed shopping mall in 3D CAD, then created a half-dozen
high-resolution renderings for a total of CDN$8,000. A San Francisco firm
charges $85 per hour for 3D CAD modeling and rendering. Photo compositing
is more complex than straight rendering: the computer model is pasted into
a photograph of the location. A recent project was priced at $3,800 for the
first photo composition and $1,100 for each additional composed viewpoint.
Ayres Group charges as little as $5,000 for a simple animation. Complex
jobs run up to $100,000.

But don't expect a happy ending to this story. The outsourcing of digital
architectural illustrations is not a booming business. Aside from Ayres
Group, the firms surveyed were unanimous in stating that there isn't enough
business in architecture to make computer imaging full-time work. The
principal of one firm told me, ``We are not actively marketing to
architects, although we have done work for architects when they find us and
we are happy to do it.''

To find the happy ending, these firms look elsewhere. Archimage markets to
producers, directors, and ad agencies. Simulacra did computer-generated
architectural backgrounds for Batman Forever (previous pages); the project
was so demanding, the hardware required a movie-studio budget, and Alias
had to write custom software. Creative Communications takes their
experience in architecture and applies it to visualizations for
non-architectural clients, such as government agencies and developers.

has gone Hollywood, adding its architectural expertise to Batman Forever
(3). Jenkins Associates modeled a small spa (4). Some surfaces can be made
transparent so clients can see inside.

Illustration: Two Screens: Using one computer model Jenkins Associates is
able to produce numerous views of a new town plan, called Angus Glen
Village, slated for Markham, Ontario (5, 6). The different views allow
potential buyers to understand how the streets and public spaces create a
sense of place.

Group produced an animation of an expansion of San Diego's Lindbergh Field
(7). The animation explains design concepts and provides a tour of the
entire project. Scenes include meticulously detailed images such as the one
