Who are the hottest Hollywood stars on the Internet?  <B>Sandra Bullock</B> (left) and <B>Alicia Silverstone</B> are the most popular actresses, while <I>Playing God'</I>s  <NOBR><B>David Duchovny</B></NOBR> beats <B>Brad Pitt</B> as most popular actor.<P>

It's sweet justice for David, who starred with Brad in <I>Kalifornia </I> and suffered the ignominy of being asked by the press what he had learned from working with a sex symbol like Brad.

<B>Jim Carrey</B>'s humour may be maturing slightly with his next offering, <I> Liar Liar </I>, which he promises will be in the <B>Steve Martin</B> vein.  He plays a father whose son puts him under a spell that makes him unable to tell a lie for 24 hours. Co-star <B>Jennifer Tilly</B> says that, while Jim's physical humour had her in stitches, it was tricky at times.  In one scene he litterally splutters for five minutes trying to deliver a lie in a courtroom.<P>

"All these different noises were coming out of him, and spittle and expressions on his face.  Meanwhile, I have, like, three incredulous expressions. I'm running out. It's like, how many times can you look aghast?  And your feeling sort of ashamed of yourself because he's got 42 different ways to do the same thing - and they're all really funny."<P>

<B>Steven Spielberg</B> has a new film in the works - but you won't be able to catch it at cinemas.  <I>Director's Chair</I> is his first CD-ROM game, which he filmed with a single video camera.<P>

It shows how to make a Hollywood movie and, being Spielberg, he had no trouble rustling up stars for the production.  Among those who appear are <B>Quentin Tarantino, Jennifer Aniston</B> (left) and <B>Katherine Helmond</B><P>

Everyone started feeling a little seasick on the set of <B>James Cameron</B>'s new film <I>Titanic</I> recently - and it wasn't at the prospect of abandoning ship.<P>

Someone apparently spiked the fish stew with an illegal substance known as angel dust.  "Some people were throwing up," recalls star <B>Bill Paxton</B> (right).  "One minute I felt okay, the next minute I felt so goddamn anxious."  Police are still investigating.<P>

Yes, even more remakes are on the way. <B>Richard Gere</B> (left) and <B>Bruce Willis</B> are teaming up for <I> The Day Of The Jackal</I>.  A new version of Alfred Hitchcock's <I> To Catch A Thief </I> is on the drwawing board and so is a remake of the '30s gang movie <I>Angels With Dirty Faces</I>. <P>

 <B>Pierce Brosnan</B> is thinking  about starring a new version of the <B>Steve McQueen/Faye Dunaway</B> thriller <I>The Thomas Crown Affair</I>.<P>
