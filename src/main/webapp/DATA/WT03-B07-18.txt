Greenspan Sneezes, IPO's Catch Cold

Once again the Federal Reserve is proving it writes the script for Wall Street.
In a Thursday night speech to the American Enterprise Institute, Fed Chairman
Alan Greenspan sent warnings that stock prices could be overvalued and the Feds
might take steps to cool the market off. The words weren't lost on anybody.
Money managers don't sell in the face of soaring stock prices, and all were
looking for a reason to run for the exits. The Fed Chairman has just given them
their excuse, sparking the fuse worldwide for investors to cash out and take
profits.

The choppy waters of the IPO market swam in a different undercurrent this past
week. What got priced were several small-cap issues underwritten by
little-known investment bank whose names are difficult to find in Wall Street's
directories. Not too surprising, given small underwriters' historically proven
ability to push small deals, the aftermarket performance was spectacular.

Such underwriters as Coburn & Meredith and Werbel-Roth led the way as Wall
Street's giants stepped to the sidelines. Nine IPOs were priced from Friday,
November 29 to Thursday, December 5, and seven were winners. There were no
losers and the two IPOs that were unchanged (see Launching Pad - page 2) were
underwritten by the well know and respected Oppenheimer & Co.

The biggest moonshot of the week came from the syndicate desks of Werbel-Roth
and co-manager Millennium Securities. On Tuesday, the underwriters offered
700,000 shares of Translation Group (NASDAQ:THEO), a deal that had been on the
IPO calendar for several weeks, at $6 a share and 1.3 million warrants at $0.20
a warrant. The first day's trading was curious. The stock opened at $7 and then
exploded to the day's high and closing price of $14, up 133%. The warrants
followed a similar path in opening at $1, then zooming to $7.25 before closing
at $6, up 2,900%. And the company? It is located in Pennsauken, N.J., and is
engaged in the translation of documents and software.

On December 5, Coburn & Meredith with its co-manager, Shamrock Partners, priced
1.0 million shares and warrants of Websecure (NASDAQ:WEBS and WEBSW,
respectively) at $8 a share and $0.20 a warrant. Both soared. The common stock
opened at $14.50 share, traded between a range of $15.25 and $12.50, and closed
at $14.75, up 84.4%. The warrants opened at $4, sold low at $3 and closed on
their high of $5.88, up 2,837.5%. The development-stage company, based in
Saugus, Mass., offers Internet access and support services for secure
commercial transactions.

In a not-too-shabby third place finish was the Advanced Aerodynamics &
Structures (NASDAQ:AASIU) offering of DH Blair. On Thursday, 6.0 million units
consisting of one common share, one class A warrant and one class B warrant
were priced at $5 a unit. The securities were traded three ways: as units, as
common stock and as warrants. The units opened at $7.75, sold to a high of
$9.50 and closed at $8.50, up a nifty 70%. The company, located in Long Beach,
Calif., is engaged in the design and manufacture of prop and jet aircraft.

Normally, when a hot IPO market become dominated by the small fries, it is a
sign of a top. However, the new issue market is not frothy. Despite the
record-setting volume figures this year, the IPO market is far from sizzling.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average have soared over 25% this year to a November
top of 6,547 while the new issue market (see ranking charts page 13) squeaked
out a modest gain of 13.6% in the 12 months ending November 29.

Now that the Fed has spoken and profit taking hit the market, a new and
stronger securities market will emerge. It always has, and the Fed Chairman
doesn't want to go down in history as the father of another 1929-type stock
market crash that led to the Depression of the 1930s. The stock market is here
to stay, and so are IPOs.John E.Fitzgibbon,Jr.

Oakmont Flue Shut As Shapiro Delivers

Mary Shapiro, regulations president of the National Association of Securities
Dealers, began handing early Christmas presents last week.

Her first stop, Lake Success, N.Y., where she left bad brokerage firm Stratton
Oakmont a lump of coal and an expulsion from the securities industry.

Over the past seven years, Stratton Oakmont has been repeatedly disciplined,
fined, sued and reprimanded by securities regulators and customers.

Charges to the company have included excessive mark-ups on stock offerings,
illicit sales practices, fraud and business ethics abuses.

An unaudited accounting of the total amount of fines owed by the firm could
exceed $25 million, sources familiar with the situation said.

This latest action centers on allegations that the firm instituted essesively
large mark-ups in the securities of pink-sheeted Master Glazier's Karate
International, and charged buyers over and above standard transaction costs to
do trades.

Besides closing the firm's doors, at least for the holidays, the expulsion
specifically bars Stratton's president Daniel Porush and Steven Saunders, its
head trader, from any securities dealings.

Neither Porush or Saunders could be reached for comment at presstime.

The expulsion also affects the trading of two initial public offerings that the
firm managed to underwrite this year and the proposed launch of one other.

In January Stratton Oakmont, offered stock and warrants totaling $10.15 million
in proceeds for Paramount Financial (NASDAQ:PARA) at $3.50 per unit. At press
time the shares closed at $1 on a volume of 82. The warrants, trading
separately, closed at 7/32 on volume of 105. Paramount is a consumer and
business financial services firm.

In May, the firm offered stock and warrants totaling $6.5 million in proceeds
for n-Vision (NASDAQ:NVSN) at $5 per unit. At press time the stock closed at 1
5/16 and the warrants at 3/8.

n-Vision makes and markets proprietary virtual reality applications for a
variety of applications including medicine, simulation, and industrial design

Trading, such as it is, in these stocks will continue through clearing agent
J.B. Oxford., which has had no charges leveled against it

Another proposed issue has been filed with SEC but has been in a state of
perpetual postponement, which now is more unlikely than ever to be lifted.

In April, e-Net, an Internet service provider, filed for an IPO calculated to
generate $14 million in proceeds. Based in Gaithersburg, Md., e-Net executives
did not return telephone calls.

Inside sources at the NASD say that the move against Stratton Oakmont is

Shapiro's first significant crackdown on brokerage abuses since she took office
earlier this year. More are expected.

12-Month Rankings Have Bear Tracks

Bear, Stearns (NYSE:BSC) is hoping the underwriting of First Virtual Holdings
(Proposed NASDAQ:FVHI) this week performs as well as the 14 other deals the
firm has done over the 12 months ended November 30.

According to statistics from Securities Data Co., Bear, Stearns is the number
one manager of positive performing initial public offerings during the rolling
12-months began in December 1995.

During the period, Bear, Stearns brought a total of 14 IPOs to market. As of
the close on Nov. 29, they averaged a hefty 49.9% increase over their offer
prices. This compares impressively to the mediocre 16.91% average increase
notched by all IPOs priced in the time frame.

No doubt the success of several high profile issues, such as Planet Hollywood
(NASDAQ:PHII), Guangshen Railway (NYSE:GSH), Sabratek (NASDAQ:SBTK) and Suiza
Foods (NASDAQ:SWZA) helped lift Bear, Stearns from fifth place in the October
to October rankings ran last month to first place for the 12 months ended
November 30.

In New York, staffers at Planet Hollywood are still cordoning off the sidewalk
for tourists to gape at the  film industry's eatery/media memorabilia shop.

Offered at $18 ($2 above the high end of the filing range), PHII has closed as
high as $32.125 since its April IPO. The Class A shares posted a recent close
of $23.

Guangshen, China's in-country railroad, offered more than 11 million American
Depository Shares at $19 in May. The ADSs  hit an all-time high of $21.50, and
landed a recent close near offer price of $19.75. Not great, but tight and
consistent.

Sabratek, the electromedical equipment manufacturer, came to market in June at
$10. The IPO price was $1 below the original $11 to $13 filing range, and yet
investors snapped up the all 2.5 million shares and have booted the share price
as high as $16.75. A recent close lists the shares about $2 off that high but
still $4 above the offer price.

Suiza, the Puerto Rican milk products and fruit drinks producer, was offered at
$14 (smack dab in the middle of its filing range) posted a recent close of
$18.625. That isn't far from its all-time high of $19.25.

Price spreads among these issues may be tight compared to some other issues
offered this year, but, as one BSC staffer said, "they're tight but they're
right for the market."

Indeed, the IPO Managers Aftermarket chart shows on average, BSC has priced its
IPOs more than 3 1/2% below the stated filing range, only to have the shares
soar nearly 10% at the end of their first day of trading.

Unlike number three ranked Hambrecht & Quist (NYSE:HMQ), BSC has stayed away
from any industry-based underwriting niche.

Where Hambrecht has carved out a solid place among technology issues, BSC's
equity participations are an eclectic mix of transportation, food, and even
consumer financial services such as United Payors & United Providers
(NASDAQ:UPUP). Offered in July at $11, the shares have been as high as $15,
although a recent close of $12 has wiped out those gains.

The "one from column A and one from column B" approach is classic conservatism
for investors. It is also vintage Bear among deal makers on Wall Street.

BSC's, mix of industry sectors has allowed it to take advantage of the stars in
a range of niches.

As the IPO Industry Aftermarket chart shows, credit institutions have turned in
a surprising 73% increase over offer price.

BSC managed the underwriting of RAC Financial Group  (NASDAQ:RACF) in February
at $17. While the shares have dipped as low as $8.75, they have also been as
high as $30.75, with a recent close of $23.125.

Again, issues in this sector have been priced an average 4 1/2% below the
stated filing range, but closed the first day of trading up more than 14%.

For individual investors, the scenario where an issue comes to market cheaper
that expected and then spirals higher than could have been hoped for is better
than the converse.

Consider specialty investors of application  software products over the last 12
months.

With their sexy Internet intros and promises to make life on the PC easier and
more exciting, these issues come to market priced at a premium.

According to Securities Data, software applications that target home users have
been priced on a steep average of 15% higher than the stated filing range.

While there is heavy, almost too-good-to-be-true activity for about a month
after offer, these stock have settled at or below offer price and show no
tangible sign of returning  to former short-lived glory.

Volatility in this sector is not only a matter of broken promises. A quick and
informal pol of industry analysts reveals that a good story might get some
venture capitalists interested, but for long-term investors the company has to
have a product that has the potential to become an industry standard.

"As computer usage becomes more commonplace among individuals," said one
analyst. "Users are finding out that they do not have to have ever single new
software package that comes out, as soon as it comes out."

The same quick rise and quicker fall is true for software applications that
target business customers (see chart).

"These issues don't represent the games or a lot of the educational mark," said
one industry analyst. "They do represent a lot of the Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)
wannabe's who ultimately can't compete with the established leaders in
spreadsheet, word processing, etc. . Unfortunately, the market is a bit
gullible about what a company or product promises it can do." By Gracian Mack
