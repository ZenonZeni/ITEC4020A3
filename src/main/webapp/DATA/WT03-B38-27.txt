PORTUGAL BEATS GERMANY TO TOP LEAGUE OF SAVERS

The Portuguese appear to be the thriftiest people in Europe, according
to OECD data.

The surprising figures push Italy and Germany into second and third
places in terms of household savings as a proportion of disposable
income.

In absolute terms, the Germans save more than any other Europeans -
simply because there are more of them, each with more money at his or
her disposal than the majority of other Europeans.

The reunification of the two German republics in October 1990 makes
historical comparisons and projections in the area of personal savings
problematical.

But in round figures, German households could put away something like
DM150 billion (Ecu 77 bn) this year in long-term financial investments
- including life assurance and occupational pension funds.

Besides being among Europe's heaviest savers, the Germans also have the
distinction of being the steadiest.

In comparison with other states they show a batch of remarkably
consistent savings ratios:  total savings (including investment in
housing) as a percentage of disposable income;  financial savings as a
percentage of total resources available for investment; or long-term
financial savings in relation to short-term - all follow a
conspicuously regular pattern.

Another distinguishing feature of German households is a low level of
indebtedness, particularly compared with the French and the British.

Although there is evidence that in Germany (as in the United Kingdom)
consumers regard borrowed money in very much the same way as income, as
part, in other words, of their normal budget, a recent survey showed
that nearly half the adult German population still feels uneasy about
the idea of having to take out a loan.

Higher consumer confidence

According to the OECD, from  data supplied by the Ministry of Finance
and the Bank of Portugal, Portuguese households save a greater
proportion of their income than anyone else in Europe.

Throughout the 1980s the personal savings ratio, as defined above,
averaged 25.9 per cent.

The ratio reached a peak of 28.3 per cent in 1985, but declined by
nearly six percentage points over the next three years.

Although real disposable income grew at the record rate of 6.5 per cent
in 1990, its rate of increase has since eased to 2.8 per cent in 1992.

At the same time, the savings ratio has also continued to decline, and
in 1992 was 21.6 per cent.

The decline was probably due to a number of factors.  The slowing down
of consumer price inflation, with its positive impact on households'
net worth was one.

Added to this were higher consumer confidence, the progressive relaxing
of liquidity constraints, expectations of higher permanent incomes as
future employment prospects improved, and (until 1991, at least) the
notably sharp rise in retirement pensions.

But a household savings ratio of 21.6 per cent of disposable income is
still well above the ratios of the other OECD countries, and a number
of social and economic factors are at work to maintain such a high
rate.

It is estimated that there are some 4.3 mn  Portuguese living abroad
(one million of them in other EC countries), compared with a resident
population of 10.4 mn.

Remittances from emigrant workers, although showing a decline in 1992,
have made and still make a substantial contribution on current account
to the Portuguese balance of payments, and although no data are
available to allow one to distinguish this specific flow of funds,
these remittances may be assumed to give a significant boost to
personal sector savings.

A comparatively high proportion of the resident workforce is self-
employed, and motivated by the consequent volatility of income and
comparatively low social protection to maintain a fairly high level of
precautionary saving.

A further element in personal saving is probably intended to maintain
or restore the net wealth of households subject to erosion  by a rate
of inflation which, although falling since 1990 is still the second
highest (after Greece) in the European Community.

Finally, the relatively under developed consumer credit market may also
play a part in Portugal's high household savings ratio, as it certainly
does in Italy.

Italy has the highest household savings rate of all the major OECD
countries -  in recent years even above Japan by between one and two
percentage points.

Although the rate has declined steadily since its peak around 26 per
cent in the 1960s and early 1970s, in the last three years it has
averaged more than 15 per cent, compared with just over 8 per cent in
the United Kingdom and 12 per cent in Germany.

The fact that Italy's savings rate is so high is at first sight
surprising, and probably not consonant with what many people outside
Italy take to be the national temperament.  But the causes of such a
high rate are not immediately cultural, but technical.

Low development of capital markets

In a paper1 presented to an international conference on savings
behaviour held in Helsinki in 1991, a team of Italian economists found
that the low development of Italian capital markets was the main reason
for three conspicuous characteristics of the Italian savings rate
(whether national or private): its high level; its substantial
reduction in the past three decades; and its strong correlation with
the growth of the national economy.

The authors of the paper showed that Italian credit and insurance
markets are considerably smaller, relative to GDP, than those of other
comparably developed countries.

Credit finances a trivial share of household consumption and
investment, Italy's small credit market being explained by the terms of
consumer credit (high down payment levels; a wide spread between
borrowing and lending rates) rather than by demographic or cultural
factors.

One consequence of these technical factors is that the Italian mortgage
market is one of the smallest among OECD countries, and expressed as a
percentage of private consumption expenditure, only a small fraction of
the average of the seven major (G7) countries.  This factor alone,
according to Sig Guiso and his co-authors,  may account for some two or
three percentage points in the aggregate savings ratio.

Italians still buy little life insurance

Italians still buy very little life insurance, in comparison with the
citizens of other G7 countries, particularly.  Life assurance premium
income is now increasing rapidly (by 22 per cent in 1991, compared with
19 per cent in France and 13 per cent in Germany), but the level of
life assurance per inhabitant is still only a fraction (between  20 and
25 per cent) of the level in those other two EC countries.

The authors of the Helsinki paper give reasons, however, for supposing
that credit market imperfections outweigh imperfect insurance markets
in explaining the behaviour of Italian households.

They also discount any special bequest motive in explaining the high
personal savings rate, arguing that the rate at which the elderly shed
their assets is actually greater in Italy than in Japan or the United
States.

`The  evidence,'  they conclude, `suggests that Italians are not
different in any major respect from other OECD citizens;  rather, it is
Italian capital markets that are different.'

RATIONALE OF THE RATIOS

In spite of their importance to national economies, household or
personal savings are defined by official statisticians essentially as a
residual item.

Savings from their point of view are simply that portion of an
individual's income that he or she refrains from spending.  They're
what's left, in other words, after consumers have stopped consuming.

Official statisticians also like to refer to `disposable income', by
which they mean income, from whatever source, after taxes have been
paid and social security payments or receipts have been netted out.

Flows of personal savings are calculated in effect as the surplus of
current income over current expenditure, and disposable income is
allocated for the purposes of national accounts entirely between saving
and consumption.

Consumption is estimated from a variety of data, and simply deducted
from income in order to arrive at savings.

The figures on savings are supposed to be checked against other
indicative data, but this enterprise tends to show up some pretty
glaring discrepancies, which official statisticians seek to correct by
falling back on conveniently undefined `balancing items'.

In any case, household savings, as featured in national accounts,
include investment in housing, both in house or apartment purchase and
home renovation or improvement.

In some countries, spending on consumer durables is also sometimes
counted as saving.

Realistic measure of savings

Financial savings, which are mainly what this newsletter is concerned
with, are therefore only a part of household savings, as habitually
defined.

But if the numerator in the household savings ratio is too broad to
indicate the magnitude of purely financial savings, the denominator is
too narrow to determine households' financial resources.

Because apart from actual income, derived from salaries, wages and
investments, householders (which in practical terms include millions of
individuals who do not actually hold a house) also often borrow money,
and perhaps not quite so often, inherit it.

For this reason, more and more analysts of savings trends in a number
of countries are focusing attention on the financial resources
available to households, rather than on income as usually defined.

The practical implications of what may seem to be conceptual nuances
are enormous.

From the point of view of financial services, as pointed out by Dr
David Fleming in his paper, Time for a realistic measure of savings1,,
`a high-savings, highly-borrowed market is very different from a low-
savings, lightly-borrowed market, even if the net savings level is the
same in each case.'

Why bother, then, with the traditional household savings ratio?

The only answer to this is that for the time being it is the most fully
documented and consistently estimated savings indicator available.  And
it is the only savings indicator so far to form any possible basis for
comparisons not only between different countries, but between one
period of time and another.

ITALY:  SUPPLEMENTARY PENSION REGIME APPROVED - FINALMENTE

After something like 18 years of argument, and in the face of a barrage
of heavy criticism , the Italian government finally approved a
legislative decree on supplementary pension funds.

Finally approved - but such is the nature of the legislative process in
Italy, that the government can still amend the decree by the end of
this year, with the result that the debate continues with undiminished
vigour.

Two more decrees on the funds' establishment procedures, contracts with
their managing bodies, and investment criteria will be issued over the
next six months, and the intention is that the schemes will become
operative in 1994.

The new pension funds - fondi pensione complementari or integrativi -
are `supplementary' in the sense that membership of them is open to
persons already contributing to state schemes.

This will take some of the burden off the state pension system in a
country with an ageing population and a notoriously large and still
rising public sector deficit.

As it is, state pensions are now less generous than they were in the
past.

Most workers and managers earning more than L50 mn (Ecu 28,000) a year
are already covered by voluntary plans, so that the main market for the
new funds will be  employees and self-employed individuals with incomes
below the L50 mn level.

As about 80 per cent of the working population fall into this category,
the market is potentially a large one.

But it's an entirely open question how many will decide to participate
in the new pension funds instead of putting their savings into high-
interest Treasury bills (buoni del Tesoro - BOT) or private insurance.

The new pension funds will be legal entities, established through
company contracts or workers' agreements promoted by trade unions that
are signatories to national labour contracts.

Employees, whether in the public or private sector, grouped by
category, company or public body, may institute defined contribution
plans with a guaranteed rate of financial return.  These funds may be
constituted within the assets of an individual company.

Self-employed workers and tradesmen and free-lance professionals,
grouped by trade or profession or territorial sector, or by their trade
associations, may constitute defined benefit plans.

The benefits, the size of which will be determined by the statutory and
contractual choices made at the act of constitution of each pension
fund, will be paid in the form of income (rendita), though members may
receive a lump sum (capitale) equivalent to 50 per cent of the current
value of the amount accrued.

Length of service benefits will be paid

Members who have contributed to the new funds for at least five years
will be eligible for old age pension benefits when they reach the
pensionable age laid down in the compulsory system.

Length-of-service benefits will be paid to individuals who have been
members of the funds for at least 15 years, and who are not more than
ten years younger than the age envisaged in the compulsory system
(which will be raised gradually from 60 to 65 years for men, and from
55 to 60 for women).

Fund members for whom severance pay (trattamento di fine rapporto -
TFR) has been accrued for at least eight years may be granted advance
payments for medical treatment or for the purchase of a house as first-
time buyers.

For tax purposes, employers may deduct contributions up to 50 per cent
of the quota taken from the TFR.

Members' contributions will benefit from a 27 per cent tax deduction on
amounts up to a maximum of L3 mn.

This applies to all contributors, whether they are employees (for whom
contributions are also made by their employers and from the TFR) or
self-employed (for whom such contributions are not paid).

The L3 mn limit also includes other deductions that may be made for the
payment of life policy and health premiums.

The contributions made out of the annual allocation to the TFR are not
taxable, but when the TFR is liquidated, these quotas are taken into
account in determining the amount of tax to be paid.

All payments into the fund will be subject to a withholding tax of 15
per cent per annum, but members are allowed a tax deduction of 17.6 per
cent on the income or capital they eventually receive.

Company payments are subject to a 10 per cent `solidarity contribution'
to the national institute for social security (Istituto nazionale di
previdenza sociale - INPS).

The supplementary pension funds are not allowed to undertake insurance
commitments directly.

Their assets may be managed under agreements concluded with three
distinct types of entity.

The first is the so-called SIM - societe di intermediazione mobiliare,
a type of company instituted in December 1990 which as well as carrying
out brokerage, dealing, market making and underwriting operations may
also manage assets.

Banks rank with SIM for this purpose, as well as other EC
intermediaries that perform the same activity and that have obtained
mutual recognition.

The second category of pension fund asset managers comprises  insurance
companies authorised to handle life assurance and capital redemption
policies.  Indeed, plans with defined benefits and guaranteed rates of
financial return are allowed to manage their resources only through
contracts with these insurance companies.

Financing by workers and employers

Finally, fund assets may be managed by entities already managing
compulsory pension schemes (principally the INPS).

With the permission of the anti-trust authority, the INPS may conclude
agreements with the supplementary pension funds for the collection of
contributions and the disbursement of benefits.

`Open' (as distinct from defined group) pension funds may be instituted
by the intermediaries authorised to manage ordinary pension funds
(brokers, banks, insurance companies, social insurance institutions) as
well as by the companies that manage investment funds (fondi comuni
d'investimento).

Membership of open pension funds is available only to workers covered
by the compulsory pension system and employed by companies that have
not established complementary pension schemes, and to workers who have
lost the requirements for participating in the group schemes to which
they would normally belong.

Financing the complementary pension funds is the responsibility of the
workers and the employers.

No one may contribute more than 10 per cent either, in the case of
employees, of the annual wage taken as the basis for determining
severance pay, or, in the case of the self-employed, of annual income.

The government is expected to make some changes to the decree,
particularly concerning its tax provisions, perhaps changing the 15 per
cent withholding tax and introducing instead a 15 per cent obligatory
investment in convertible bonds to encourage privatisation.

FRANCE:  RECLASSIFICATION OF SICAVS AND FCPS

The French stock market supervisory body, the Commission des operations
de Bourse  (COB), has revealed details of its plans to change the
classification of all managed funds operating in France.

All Sicavs and fonds communs de placement (FCPs) sold in France will be
affected by the new classification, due to take effect from January 1,
1994.

The new system involves five descriptive categories and three sub-
categories, and replaces an out-of-date 13-category classification
introduced in 1985 before derivative products became an important part
of funds, and before Sicav monetaires took off.

The new categories are designed to inform savers more clearly whether a
fund is invested in equities, bonds, or monetary instruments, whether
it has a guarantee, or whether it involves potential currency exposure.

For investors this is expected to give a better appreciation of risk
than the old system which, while giving an idea of equities, bonds and
short-term investments, divided these into several sub-sections with
minor differences.

The COB says that the new system will also help multi-service groups
such as banks and financial intermediaries determine their
responsibilities in relation to investors and their depository bodies.

France is the only European country to have an obligatory fund
classification system that has such an impact on the day-to-day
operation of funds.

The new classification requires an equity fund to remain at least 60
per cent invested in equities at all times.  A monetary instrument fund
is restricted to a maximum of 10 per cent investment in equities.

Funds holding convertibles must declare whether their convertibles
behave more like an equity or more like a bond.

Fund managers now have four months to decide which categories their
funds fall into, and to make any necessary adjustments to management
aims and techniques.

The COB will then give its approval to the self-declared allegiance, or
suggest a recategorisation.

Any fund managers who disagree with COB recommendations can move to the
diversified section, which covers all funds not eligible for `pure'
categories.

Although the new system of classification was not prompted by the ucits
directive, it is expected that French funds will remain compatible with
it.

Foreign funds sold in France are unlikely to have to change their
management practices, as they fall straightforwardly into the foreign
equities, foreign bonds, or foreign monetary categories in the case of
single-instrument products or, for mixed funds, into the catch-all
diversified products category, which will also include all funds under
discretionary management, as well as funds invested in convertible
stocks.

SPAIN:  FIRST PROPERTY FUNDS LIKELY BY AUTUMN

Property investment funds - fondos de inversion inmobiliaria - are the
latest arrival on the investment scene in Spain, under a royal decree
issued last month.

The concept of such funds has existed in Spanish law since 1964 but it
was not until July last year that a new law specifically laid out the
framework for an instrument that is well established in many other EC
member states.

And only in May this year, with the issuing of royal decree 686/1993,
was the earlier framework fleshed out with the detail needed for the
creation of the first property funds, which may be launched as early as
the autumn.

One of the benefits that Spanish officials hope to reap from this new
savings instrument is a stimulus to the housing market, at present deep
in the doldrums.

Property investment funds tend to flourish in a relatively deep and
well-developed property market, where they may boost its development
and enhance its stability.

Opening the way for small savers to enter the housing market via fondos
inmobiliarios will mean `new financing for the property market',
according to a top executive of the Groupe Pelloux.

Spanish officials also hope that the new funds will fill a specific and
important market gap: that of rental housing, which is scarce in Spain.

The July 1992 law clearly referred to the role it is hoped the funds
will play by calling them in the preamble `a component of the
government's housing policy.'  But some experts say this narrow focus
is a weak point of the 1992 law.

A needed long-term investment vehicle

Another great benefit of property investment funds in Spain is that
they will provide a new and much-needed long-term investment instrument
in Spain.

According to the same Groupe Pelloux spokesman, the funds will fill a
gap in Spanish capital markets, which at present have only 10-year
Treasury bonds as long-term instruments, whose volume is still quite
small.

The 1992 law specifies that property investments may not exceed between
70 and 80 per cent of the fund's assets.  The remainder can be invested
in tradable securities, either equities or bonds.

A new fund must have assets of at least Ptas1.5 bn (Ecu10 mn).

It must have at least 100 participants, and no individual investor may
hold more than a 25 per cent share in the fund.

Property assets will be valued at least once a year by assessors
registered with the bank of Spain.

Another feature of the law is that it aims to encourage medium-and long-
term investment by tying tax benefits to a minimum four-year period of
ownership of property by the fund.

Still to be defined by the Ministry of the Economy are the rules to be
applied to the diversification of funds' real estate holdings, to avoid
the risks inherent in undue concentration in a single property.

The Ministry must also decide what types of property will be open to
investment by the funds - whether, for example, building lots can also
be included.

Limits will also have to be set on the amount of outstanding loans that
a fund may contract.

But although these details have still to be clarified, an official of
the Comision Nacional del Mercado de Valores (CNMV), the stock market
regulatory body that will supervise the funds, claims that there is
already more than one candidate waiting to be the first on the market.

FRANCE:  SHARE OWNERSHIP SET TO REVIVE

The first quarter of the year showed Sicav managers increasing their
exposure to equities.

With only part of the increase attributable to the strength of the
stock market, the value of shares in their portfolios rose by FF90 bn
(Ecu13.7 bn).

French fund managers increased the proportion of the CAC-100 index
accounted for by Sicavs from 5.88 per cent to 6.36 per cent, according
to the Dealers' Book.

That is a tiny fraction compared with their counterparts across the
channel, but an increase in the funds' exposure to equities is a
necessary condition for the success of the privatisation programme.

But there may still be a lot of resistance to overcome.

Spectacular fall in equity fund owners

According to a study conducted by Sofres, the polling agency, on behalf
of the Bank of France, the number of private individuals holding shares
has dropped by some 900,000 to 4.5 mn since April 1991, the last time
the survey was conducted.

The number of people owning equity funds dropped even more
spectacularly, from 7.5 mn to 3.2 mn, but the numbers owning money
market funds rose from 4 mn to 5.6 mn over the same  period.

Of the approximately FF1,000 bn (Ecu150 bn) held in Sicav monetaires,
some FF700 bn (Ecu135 bn) is invested by private individuals, and the
rest by companies that use the funds as short-term means of cash
management.

The Bank of France and the Societe des Bourses francaises  (SBF - the
executive authority governing the day-to-day operations of the stock
market) remain optimistic, however, that share holding will rise again,
as historically privatisation programmes have been major periods of
increase, when young persons particularly are tempted to invest in
equities.

The managing director of the Commission des operations de Bourse (COB),
M. Pierre Fleuriot, predicts that employee share schemes and the tax-
favourable equity savings scheme introduced in September 1992 (the plan
d'epargne en actions - PEA) will also have the effect of lifting share
ownership.

The importance of small investors is shown by the fact that over half
the people in France owning equities have a portfolio worth less than
FF50,000 (Ecu7,600).

GERMANY:  GERMAN EQUITIES BRING GREATER REWARDS...

Mr Ralf Conen, head of quantitative capital markets analysis at
Deutsche Bank, has recently completed a study of stock market yields in
Germany covering three historical periods  1876-1913; 1924-1941; and
1949-1992.

In each of these periods the average annual yield from equities was
considerably higher than the yield from fixed-interest securities, the
most striking yield gap appearing in the period since 1949.

Since 1949, according to Mr Conen, equities have shown an average real
post-tax return of 12.08 per cent a year, while bonds have shown a
negative yield of 0.09 per cent.

In another computation, the Deutsche Bank study claims that a German
investor  who started in 1949 to put DM10,000 every year into equities
would have been a millionaire in constant 1949 terms by 1977.

But his next door neighbour who put the same amount into bonds each
year would not be a genuine 1949-vintage millionaire until the year
2059.

Mr Conen is evidently making some pretty bold assumptions about the
course of German taxes and consumer prices over the next 66 years, but
his general conclusion that the long-term German investor is paid a
pretty hefty risk premium for investing in equities seems unassailable.

 One of the more detailed findings of the study  is that, the longer
the time-span under consideration, the greater the probability that an
investment in equities is more rewarding than one in bonds.

If single years only are considered, equities were more profitable in
56 out of the 97 years covered by the research.

If periods of five years are taken as the basis of comparison, however,
in 62 out of 85 possible runs, equities were more profitable; and in
ten-year periods, 54 out of 70.


In percentage terms, this means that equities were more profitable in
58 per cent of one-year periods, in 73 per cent of five-year periods,
and in 77 per cent of ten-year periods.

When periods of 20 years or more are taken as the basis of comparison,
equities are found to have scored from 83 per cent up to 100 per cent
of the time.

In spite of the higher performance of equities, however, the German
public still show a marked preference for  bonds, at least when it
comes to putting money  into investment funds.

Last year, for example, bond funds (both German and foreign) attracted
a total of DM53.4 bn (Ecu27.3 bn) new money, equivalent to no less than
86.5 per cent of the total inflow into German funds.

As it happens, over the last year German bond funds have performed on
average better than German equity funds, benefiting both from high
yields on the bonds in their portfolios and from bond price rises
resulting from the lowering of interest rates.

But over the last ten years, for example, German equity funds have
outperformed German bond funds by a considerable margin.

According to the Bundesverband Deutscher Investment-Gesellschaften BVI
(the German Investment Fund Association), German equity funds showed an
average rise in unit value of 163.6 per cent in the ten years to the
end of March, 1993, with the top-performing fund, SMH-Special-Fonds 1,
registering an advance of 254.9 per cent.

Compared with this, the best performance shown by German bond funds was
a 113.9 per cent gain by Universal's BERENBERG-UNIV.-RENTENFONDS (the
fund which also turned in the best performance over 20 years).

The average of the 28 funds in this sector to have a ten-year or longer
track record was a 98.2 per cent increase in unit value - a mere 60 per
cent of the equity fund average.


This persistent preference for bond funds can only be based on short-
term considerations.

In any given year since 1949, bonds showed a minimum yield of 2.6 per
cent, whereas while the highest average yield of equities reached 47.2
per cent in one year, there was a year in which investors saw an
average loss of 14 per cent.

But if the risk of losing money persuades German investors to forego the
chance of enjoying more substantial returns, it also apparently focuses
their attention mistakenly on current values to the neglect of the
erosive action of inflation , which in West Germany, though less than
half the EC average, has averaged nearly 4 per cent a year in the last
20 years.

`If you want to eat well, buy shares,' runs a German saying.  "If you
want to sleep well, buy bonds.'

There may be something in that, but if consumer prices are rising while
you sleep, your dream of a bond-invested nest egg could well turn into
a nightmare.

UNITED KINGDOM:  PRIVATE MEDICAL INSURANCE USED AS 'SOFT SELL'

Although private medical insurance (PMI) is not in itself a savings
product, its development in the United Kingdom is linked to trends in
the broader savings market.

It appears that life companies - especially those that operate through
their own direct sales forces - are getting into the PMI market as a
soft way of prospecting clients for more lucrative business, such as
private pensions.

The tied sales agent must have a full range of products to offer in
order to prevent the client from going elsewhere for one particular
type of product, and then perhaps being seduced by a new company into
buying savings products as well.

A newly-launched product is easier to sell, and health insurance has
proved attractive to an industry ever hungry for new products.

Branching out into PMI offers the agent a pretext  to visit customers
to see if this area of their financial planning is covered, when the
routine annual updating visit may have lost its sales pull.

In recent years, tied agent companies such as Allied Dunbar and Lloyds
Abbey Life have entered the market, as well as major composites like
Norwich Union, Sun Alliance (through its purchase of Mutual of Omaha),
and the guaranteed bond specialist General Portfolio.

Allied Dunbar added PMI to a range which already comprised critical
illness cover (first offered in 1989) and permanent health insurance
(1985).  Allied Dunbar make their own underwriting arrangements on
these two contracts through their life funds.  Their PMI contract is
underwritten by Lloyds syndicates.

Allied Dunbar claim that one in five of all critical illness plans in
force in the United Kingdom is theirs, though in the PMI market they
are not yet a significant force, with only 20,000 contracts in
existence.

Norwich Union made a major entry into the PMI market in 1990, setting
up a new division which at the end of March 1993 claimed 375,000
clients, an estimated one-third share of all new and switched business
in 1992, and a 6 per cent share of the total market.

The managing director of Norwich Union Health Care, Mr David Cavers,
says that PMI was seen to be a market capable of rapid growth,
dominated by a couple of provident institutions (British Union
Provident Association - BUPA - of London and Private Patient Plan - PPP
-  of Tunbridge Wells), only one of which has put a lot of money into
marketing.

Norwich Union Health Care expects premium income of close to #100 mn
this year.

The only link between Norwich Union's PMI product and other savings
plans is the distribution chain - both are sold largely through
intermediaries.

Mr Cavers sees PMI as an under developed product for the intermediary.
Brokers had not been selling it actively until the last four or five
years, when specialist advisers began to appear.

`Intermediaries have now woken up to the fact that they can sell
medical plans to savings customers,' says Mr Cavers.

The effect of such competition has been to make heavy inroads into the
market share of the leading companies, BUPA and PPP, with BUPA down
from 80 per cent of the market to less than 50 per cent over the last
five years.

Continental firms enter the UK market

The most recent development in the PMI market has been the link-up
between the French healthcare mutual Strasbourgeoise and Clinicare, the
UK specialist health insurer.

Strasbourgeoise entered the British market in 1990 with a plan offering
a number of features not available in standard UK plans, but probably
because of its high cost the plan did not attract a large market share.

A standard view of the PMI market is that in the current economic and
political climate, it is bound to grow.

But in practice, the market has disappointed expectations in recent
years.

About seven million persons in the United Kingdom currently have health
insurance.  The industry hopes to see 18 million insured by the end of
the century.

But rising claim rates and rising medical costs have hit insurers hard,
and premiums have had to be increased by more than 10 per cent a year
for several years.

In 1992, so far from growing, the market is estimated to have
contracted by between 6 and 10 per cent.

In spite of this, more companies are entering the market.  The Dutch
PMI company OHRA entered the United Kingdom market in March.

A new joint venture between Cornhill Insurance and Deutsche
Krankenversicherung AG is in the process of development, and its launch
is expected in the next few months
with a full range of products specialising in the hospital sector.

No more major UK insurers are expected to launch PMI products, though
it is thought that both Royal Life and the Prudential have been looking
at the market.

UNITED KINGDOM:  SCOTTISH EQUITABLE GOES DUTCH

Policyholders of Scottish Equitable, the Edinburgh-based life assurance
company, will vote at the end of this month on a deal whereby the Dutch
insurer Aegon will buy a 40 per cent share of Scottish Equitable's unit-
linked business.

With-profits policyholders with Scottish Equitable will continue to own
100 per cent of their fund.

Scottish Equitable's rise has been meteoric in the independent
financial adviser pensions market.

In 1981, premium income was #105 mn.  By 1992 it had grown to #1,004
mn.

Recent comment suggests that Scottish Equitable has been a victim of
its own success: further expansion will be difficult without an
injection of capital, which is made more difficult by the company's
mutual structure.

Aegon - one of the top ten insurance groups in Europe, with 1992
revenues equivalent to more than Ecu7.5 bn (nearly two-thirds of it
related to life assurance) - will pay #200 mn into the Scottish
company's with-profits fund, and a further #40 mn to capitalise the new
holding company, which will be 60 per cent owned by the with-profits
fund and 40 per cent by Aegon.

This arrangement has been arrived at because it is estimated that full
demutualisation would have cost Aegon as much as #700 mn.

Scottish Equitable and Aegon are waiting for confirmation from the EC
Commission that the proposed deal is not anti-competitive, as well as
for the approval of policyholders.

UNITED KINGDOM:  SECOND-HAND DEALERS FLOURISH

Policy Portfolio, the North London-based market maker in second-hand
with-profits endowment policies, announced last week its intention to
seek a full listing on the London Stock Exchange.

The move will make it the only second-hand policy market maker to be
listed in its own right.

Recession in the United Kingdom has seen a surge in the fortunes of
dealers in second-hand policies.

According to the managing director of Policy Portfolio, Mr Isaac Rubin,
more than 50 per cent of with-profits policies taken out in the United
Kingdom are surrendered before they reach maturity.

Owing to clawback of commission and other effects of policy charges,
surrender values can be poor, even after the policy has been in force
for several years.

Policyholders can get a better return by selling the policy on to
another investor, who then collects the final policy value on maturity
or the death of the original owner.

Policies `overvalued'

Several market makers are now in business in Great Britain.  One
investment trust has been set up by Kleinwort to hold second-hand
policies, and two further investment trusts are planned, one from
Barclays de Zoete Wedd market maker Beale Dobie, and the other from
market maker Gerald Edelman.

Insurance companies offering the original policies fear that they may
be overvalued and that the market is not big enough to support all the
players at present in it.

The Kleinwort fund, launched in July 1992, raised #30 mn, of which less
than half has so far been invested, because of a shortage of suitable
policies.

The Financial Intermediaries', Managers' and Brokers' Association
(FIMBRA), one of the United Kingdom's self-regulating organisations,
recently introduced a ruling to make market makers modify their claims
for the projected values of the policies being sold.

The leading with-profits company Standard Life has also caused
controversy recently by writing to holders of second-hand policies to
say that only the normal policy benefits will accrue to such policies.

The company has been quoted as saying that prices `have been bid up
beyond reasonable levels'.

FRANCE:  BIG GROUPS TO BE PRIVATISED

Whereas some 50 conservative deputies either abstained or voted against
the law to give the Bank of France greater independence, the unveiling
of the list of state enterprises that are candidates for privatisation
caused far less contention among the government's supporters.

Most commercial and industrial companies are considered privatisable,
and it appears that the government has no intention of holding on to
either the three state-controlled insurance giants (AGF, GAN and UAP
which between them account for about 28 per cent of new life assurance
business in France) or banks like Banque Nationale de Paris - BNP and
Credit Lyonnais, which do not look particularly attractive buys at the
moment owing to their exposure to small companies, entertainment and
property.

FRANCE:  PUBLICITY DRIVE FOR POSTE AVENIR

La Poste, the French post office, is giving a huge publicity spin
(television ads in prime time and inserts in every TV listings
magazine) to its already established Poste Avenir savings and life
assurance contract.

Managed by the state-controlled Caisse Nationale de Prevoyance (CNP),
France's leading life assurer, Poste Avenir is guaranteeing 8 per cent
net of management fees for sums (minimum FF3,000) invested before June
30.

As this is a life-related product, it also gives rise to useful tax
breaks - reductions of FF1,000 per adult and FF250 per dependent child
in the family.

INSURERS LOSE OUT TO BANKS

The longer institutions are involved in bancassurance, the wider the
scope of products and services they aim for, with banks getting the
most benefit from integration.

This is one of the key findings of a paneuropean survey, Making
bancassurance work, published  by Coopers&Lybrand and based on
interviews with senior management of 54 leading players in
bancassurance in France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Spain and the
United Kingdom.

As an example of what they mean by `integration` the authors of the
survey cite a move from a marketing agreement between a bank and an
insurance company to an exclusive arrangement involving joint training,
product and sales development.

Similarly, a merging of a bank's insurance subsidiary's marketing or
investment management department into one group-led department also
represents more integration.

According to Mr Angus Hislop, a consultant with C&L's financial
services group, banks have gained much more from bancassurance than
insurers. With life products in particular, they have succeeded in
reaching many more of their own customers.

UK institutions the exception

While over two-thirds of all the institutions interviewed for the C&L
survey stated that a major integration had either already been applied
or was planned for at least one of five business functions (sales
force/distribution channels; marketing; service departments;
administration; and senior management), seven out of the 11 UK
institutions were not planning any integration at all.

In other words, the UK institutions show the inverse of the trend among
the continental institutions surveyed.

This, suggest C&L, may be due to a traditionally more short-term
orientation; greater opportunities for early reduction of the unusually
high distribution costs without integration; and a more sceptical
attitude towards the achievement of economies of scale in distribution
and operational functions.

In contrast to the continental institutions, half of the UK
institutions do not plan to realise scale effects in sales and
distribution.

But 30 out of the 43 continental institutions plan to integrate their
distribution channels and sales forces, and 32 of them plan to
integrate marketing functions.

The reasons for developing bancassurance cited most often by the
survey's respondents were factors such as recognising changes in
clients' needs, such as, for example, the demand for more personal
wealth management; building closer ties with clients; and serving them
at all stages of their lives.

This last factor was singled out by all the institutions planning or
applying major integration of business functions as a driving impulse
behind bancassurance.

Defensive and offensive strategy

Defending their customer base is another major driving factor,
especially for institutions integrating their market approaches and
structure.

The survey cites the example of a large French institution whose
primary goal is to sell life assurance.  If the client does not want to
buy at a particular moment, savings products are used to maintain the
relationship with the customer.

A few years later this client will be approached again for life
assurance, and bancassurance is therefore implemented to protect the
core insurance business.  (We might add, however, that the distinction
between life and savings products is not so clear in France as in other
EC countries).

A similar approach has been used by French banks that have successfully
offered money funds to their clients to discourage them from
transferring to other institutions.

In Italy, more than one institution indicated that life assurance, with
a link to a current account, is an effective way to tie the client in
for the medium term.

Seen in this light, bancassurance is as much a defensive strategy to
ward off threats to an institution's client base as an offensive one to
exploit opportunities made possible by integration of business
functions.

GERMANY:  BUSINESS BOOMS AT  MORTGAGE BANKS

German mortgage banks (Hypothekenbanken) recorded a surge in new
commitments to lend in the first four months of this year.

Compared with the January-April period in 1992, new commitments to the
private sector (including loans for house and flat purchase or
conversion; loans for the construction of new dwellings; and loans to
the private commercial sector) rose 46.6 per cent to DM25.4 bn.

Commitments to lend to local authorities rose 51.7 per cent in the
first four months of this year, compared with the corresponding period
of 1992.

The volume of mortgage bonds issued by the Hypothekenbanken rose by
more than 72 per cent to DM68.8 bn.

In spite of the current recession in the German construction industry,
and tightening of the laws governing property rental, a spokesman for
the mortgage banks claimed that their longer-term prospects were
bright, in view of the great housing shortage in west Germany, the need
to raise housing standards in the new federal states, and the extensive
requirements for financing of local authorities.

Since the legal restraints on the conduct by the mortgage banks of
business outside Germany were relaxed in 1991, the banks have granted
more loans in other EC member states.  These loans now amount to close
to DM3 bn, equivalent to 1 per cent of the banks' domestic mortgage
loans.

Most of the credit granted abroad has been to German clients, and the
United Kingdom, France and Netherlands are the main countries
concerned.

The mortgage banks have loans to foreign local authorities to a total
of DM7.5 bn on their balance sheets, equivalent to 2.4 per cent of
total local authority loans.

GERMANY:  LIFE INDUSTRY PYRAMID SALESMEN UNDER ATTACK

New life assurance contracts to the tune of DM 400 billion were written
in Germany in 1992, and pyramid sales companies probably accounted for
more than one-fifth of that colossal total.

The Strukturvertriebe, to give them a name which they do not always
acknowledge, have been the German life industry's success story of the
last decade.

They first appeared on the scene in the aftermath of the IOS debacle,
and after a comparatively slow start could still claim only about 8 per
cent of total new life business by 1985.

But their share of the market more than doubled in the next five years,
and although its rate of growth has slowed down, it is still expanding,
and by the end of the decade on present form could well be nudging 25
per cent of the total.

A hierarchy of eight levels

Not only have the Struckis - as the pyramid salesmen are colloquially
known in Germany -  been capturing a rapidly increasing share of the
market, but the total market is itself growing apace.

To take one indicator, since 1980 life assurance gross premium income
has increased at a compound annual growth rate of nearly 9 per cent,
and in 1992 amounted to a massive DM69.4 billion.

More recently, however, the rate of growth has been accelerating, and
in the last three years it has averaged more than 12 per cent.

In part this acceleration is due to the accession in October 1990 of
the former East German Lander, where a population of 16 million could
not boast a single life assurance policy between them before
reunification.

Significantly enough, the Struckis have been particularly active in
these Lander, where it is claimed they may have as much as 30 per cent
of the market.

A Strukturvertrieb consists of a number  of teams reporting upwards
through a hierarchy of as many as seven or eight levels.

Senior managers (typically known as regional directors) owe their
position entirely to the constant generation of sales income by those
below them in the structure.

Recruits are usually drawn from outside the financial services sector
but, prompted by their companies, they tend to call themselves
Finanzberater or Vermogensberater (literally, wealth or assets
advisers).

And if these self-styled advisers often prefer not to be known as
insurance salesmen, the companies, too, would rather be known to the
public as Allfinanzvertriebe, and like to get the word Beratung
(`consultation') into their registered name.

Officially, indeed, such a company is likely to be registered as an
independent sales force (eigenstandige Aussendienst), while being
wholly or partly owned by an insurance company.

But a Strukturvertrieb's independence may be genuine to the extent that
it does not sell exclusively own-house products, but a fairly wide
range of insurance and investment products from a number of suppliers.

In the former East Germany, one product that has been particularly
popular is a short-term savings contract taking advantage of a State
incentive and designed to release capital for house purchase or
renovation.

Companies selling their products through Struckis have to pay higher
commissions than they offer to brokers or to their own tied agents
(considerably higher in the latter case).

An excessively high lapse rate for policies sold by Struckis - reported
to be as high for some as 18 per cent, or four times the rate
experienced on average by other sales methods - adds significantly to
the acquisition costs of pyramid sales.

Salesmen thoroughly trained

A necessary feature of the system is that commissions received by the
Struckis are never passed on intact to the salesmen..

As much as one-third may be deducted immediately for company overheads,
and the balance then percolates through the structure in ever
decreasing percentages, so that a junior salesman usually receives
between 1 and 1.5 per cent.

An established insurance company agent, by comparison, receives a
commission of 3.5 per cent.

The Strukturvertriebe give new salesmen a thorough training not only in
selling financial products, but in recruiting new potential salesmen.

One of the leading Strukturvertriebe, Bonn Finanz Vermogensberatung AG
(100 per cent owned by the insurance company Deutscher Herold, recently
bought by Deutsche Bank), mounts a 12-week training course.

This consists of three five-day residential seminars backed by work
experience, for which the aspiring salesman has to pay DM2,500.

In general, however, the demands of a system that requires the new
recruit to force through as many sales as he can in the shortest
possible time and to persuade other people to work for him lead to an
exceptionally high dropout rate.

In fact, it is claimed by critics of the pyramid sales  system that
only about one recruit in five survives the first year of selling.

But that is probably the mildest criticism levelled against the
Strukturvertriebe.

The main objections are raised against the Struckis' high pressure
selling methods.

Legally obliged to give good advice

Brokers belonging to medium and small firms, particularly (the large
firms not usually being concerned with mass personal lines insurance)
feel themselves at a disadvantage, because unlike the Struckis they are
legally obliged to give their clients good advice (not yet `best
advice'!) about the growth prospects of investments and protection
against risks.

The Struckis benefit from the fact that in Germany the emphasis in the
supervision of insurance is on products, the design and pricing of
which have to conform to strict guidelines.

Distribution of products, on the other hand, is comparatively
unregulated.  There is, for instance, no provision under law for the
licensing or testing of insurance intermediaries, whether they work as
company tied agents or in the independent sector.

One man who has mounted a vigorous campaign to have tougher rules
applied to independent financial intermediaries is Hans-Wolff Graf, the
chairman and chief executive of the Munich-based financial services
company efv-AG (Erste Finanz- und Vermogensberater Aktiengesellschaft
in Deutschland).

Mr Graf began his own career with IOS and then continued with two of
the largest Allfinanzvertriebe before setting up his own company, and
he brings the missionary zeal of a religious convert to his  campaign.

`To sell a pork cutlet in Germany,' he says, `you have to study for
three years and then work constantly under the vigilant eye of the law.

`Nothing like this is required from anyone selling financial contracts,
including life assurance policies.'

Mr Graf has submitted a draft law governing independent financial
intermediaries to the authorities and has set up a registered
association to pursue his cause.

Embarrassed by sales techniques

One of his more startling claims is that unqualified salesmen, or
`pseudo-consultants' as he calls them will have received more than DM
10 billion in commission last year from new contracts that will sooner
or later be cancelled prematurely.

So far Mr Graf has received little encouragement from Bonn, but the
Berlin-based supervisory authority, the Bundesaufsichtsamt fur das
Versicherungswesen, is said to be embarrassed by the Struckis'
aggressive sales techniques and the flamboyant public image of some of
the leading figures in the sector.

But while these misgivings may be shared by the life assurance industry
in general, many insurance companies have lost members of their tied
agent force to the independent sector, and in the process have become
heavily dependent on Struckis for their new business

Some companies have bought majority or even total share holdings in a
Strukturvertrieb, and although stricter requirements may one day be
imposed on the training and professional standards of the pyramid
salesmen, a system bringing as much as DM 15 billion a year in premium
income is bound to have some keen champions even among the older German
life assurance companies.

PYRAMID POWER ON THE WANE?

While the authorities may be slow to tighten their supervision of the
pyramid salesmen, the Strukturvertriebe may become the victims of their
own excesses.

According to a recent article in manager magazin (published in Hamburg)
, Germany's second largest Allfinanz- or Strukturvertrieb is faced with
a number of problems.

Objektive Vermogensberatung GmbH (OVB) was founded in 1970 by Otto
Wittschier, one of the most senior former IOS salesmen still active in
Germany.  The company's principal shareholder is Deutscher Ring, but
OVB sells a variety of insurance and savings products on behalf of as
many as 18 companies, including Equity & Law, American Express, and
Deutsche Bank's DWS investment fund company.

Data for such items as sales forces are always given in suspiciously
round figures for Strukturvertriebe, but a figure of 15,000 salesmen
(nearly one-third of them recruited in the former DDR) is frequently
quoted for OVB.  But many of these salesmen are reported to be
currently doing little or no business.

Selling mainly life assurance, investment funds, and house purchase
contracts, OVB's salespersons raised the company's turnover from DM4.4
bn in 1989 to DM12.7 bn in 1990, and then to DM15.4 bn in 1991.  But in
1992, turnover plummeted by an ominous 19 per cent to DM12.5 bn.

One reason for the fall in new business appears to be a drying up of
the east German market, where OVB had scored some of its most striking
successes.  But there are also difficulties between Mr Wittschier and
his two co-founders and the parent company.

Under a contentious agreement between the two, Deutscher Ring has to
buy the founders out if they so demand, but Deutscher Ring is reported
to be unwilling to do this.

Further problems are being created by the departure of key personnel at
the top of the company's hierarchy.  One former OVB salesman, Mr
Carsten Maschmeyer, left while still in his 20s in to found his own
company, Allgemeiner Wirtschaftsdienst, in 1988, and the possibility of
new rivals (one's own former star salesmen, as likely as not) appearing
in such an unregulated field must always threaten the established
companies.

One casualty of OVB's present plight is its ambitious plan to extend
operations to other European countries.  After, according to manager
magazin, spending half a million marks on studies and analysis, it has
put its intended Italian operation on the back burner.  In Austria,
where OVB established itself in 1991, the level of business has been
decidedly modest, and in Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic, only
the legal formalities have been completed.  OVB was also reported to
have had plans to start up in the United Kingdom, but if there ever
really were such plans, they seem to have been dropped.

A NEW GENERATION OF INVESTORS

Apart from demographic changes, the single factor to have most impact
on future savings trends in Germany will be the growth of personal
incomes. This will affect both the volume of savings and the way they
are allocated between the various available vehicles.

Over the next two decades, for the first time since 1945, a whole
generation of German citizens will come into substantial inherited
wealth. According to estimates made by banks, this generation of
Germans will have aggregate assets of DM 2,500 bn, and their attitudes
towards investments will be vastly different from that of previous
generations who experienced hyper-inflation coupled with economic and
political turmoil. Banks believe they will be more receptive towards
new savings products..

Some market researchers claim that there is a new generation of jungen
Aufstiegsorientierten, akin to yuppies, who demand a wider range of
financial products more finely tuned to the individual's requirements.
