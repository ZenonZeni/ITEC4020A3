<H1>IV. Transportation</H1>
<BR>
<BR>
The combustion of fossil fuels by the U.S. transportation sector consumed 
35 percent of the nation's energy in 1990 and produced more than 32 
percent of U.S. carbon dioxide emissions.<a href="#242" name="r242"> [ 242 ] </a>Transportation will be the 
fastest-growing source of U.S. carbon dioxide emissions over the long 
term - by far - unless Americans take aggressive steps to build 
efficiency into transportation systems.<a href="#243" name="r243"> [ 243 ] </a>
<p>     Two-thirds of total U.S. oil consumption goes to transportation.<a href="#244" name="r244"> [ 244 ] </a>
Transportation is the only sector of the U.S. economy that is totally 
dependent on oil. Oil consumption by transportation has profound 
implications for national security. Each day, Americans use 4 million more 
barrels of oil for transportation than the United States produces. The 
United States imports more than half the petroleum it uses, and those 
imports contributed $56 billion to the U.S. trade deficit in 1994.<a href="#245" name="r245"> [ 245 ] </a>The 
United States is importing more oil than ever before, and the trend is 
upward. The gap between what we use and what we produce is projected to 
rise to 9 million barrels per day by the year 2010.<a href="#246" name="r246"> [ 246 ] </a>Dependence on oil 
imports threatens U.S. national security.<a href="#247" name="r247"> [ 247 ] </a>It makes our economy 
vulnerable to foreign cartels, price swings, supply disruptions, and 
foreign wars.<BR>
<p>     Transportation energy use accounts for about half of all air 
pollution emissions in the United States and more than 80 percent of air 
pollution in cities.<a href="#248" name="r248"> [ 248 ] </a>Highway vehicles alone account for 26 percent of 
U.S. emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), 32 percent of 
nitrogen oxides, and 62 percent of total carbon monoxide.<a href="#249" name="r249"> [ 249 ] </a>Emissions of 
these hydrocarbon vapor emissions are tied to gasoline use. Hydrocarbon 
by-products of gasoline consumption react with nitrogen oxides to form 
ground-level ozone, a major air pollutant that aggravates asthma and 
causes other respiratory problems. The <A NAME="AmericanLungAssociation">American Lung Association</a> (ALA) 
estimates that the United States spends $50 billion each year on health 
care as a direct result of air pollution.<a href="#250" name="r250"> [ 250 ] </a>
<p>     Every tank of gasoline consumed by an automobile produces between 240 
and 400 pounds of carbon dioxide when burned.<a href="#251" name="r251"> [ 251 ] </a>Every pound emitted 
accumulates in the atmosphere for between 50 and 200 years.<a href="#252" name="r252"> [ 252 ] </a>The United 
States emits almost as much carbon dioxide from the transport sector as 
Eastern Europe, Southeast Asia, China, Africa, Latin America, and the 
Middle East combined.<a href="#253" name="r253"> [ 253 ] </a>
