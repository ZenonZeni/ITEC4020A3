<CENTER><B>SURVEY FINDS OVERWHELMING SUPPORT FOR<BR>
RENEWABLE ENERGY</B></CENTER>
<P>
A post-election survey on the environment and energy found that voters overwhelmingly support federal programs to promote the increased production and use of renewable energy generally, and the ethanol tax incentive, specifically.  
<P>
According to the poll released by the Sustainable Energy Coalition, American voters strongly favor federal research funding and tax incentives for renewable energy and energy efficiency over fossil fuels and nuclear power.
<P>
The national public opinion survey, "America Speaks Out on Energy:  A Survey of 1996 Post-Election Views," was conducted by the Republican polling firm R/S/M, Inc.  It is the latest in a series of annual surveys on energy and the environment that began in 1988.

<B>Which Program Should Receive Highest Funding Priority?</B>  
<P>

</CENTER>
<P>
For a third year in a row, voters give the highest priority for funding for the U.S. Department of Energy's research budget to renewable energy (34%) and energy efficiency (22%).  Nearly a third of respondents (31%) feel nuclear power is the energy source that should be subject to budget cuts, followed by fossil fuels (21%).
<P>
The Sustainable Energy Coalition is a coalition of more than 40 national environmental, business, government and utility organizations that favor shifting federal energy funding priorities from nuclear power and fossil fuels to renewable energy and energy efficiency.

<CENTER><B>VOTERS SUPPORT CONTINUING ETHANOL TAX INCENTIVE</B></CENTER>
<P>
As part of the Sustainable Energy Coalition post-election survey, voters were asked whether the government should continue the federal tax exemption for ethanol-blended gasoline, and 7 out of 10 (71%) voters responded that they support continuing the ethanol tax incentive.  Only 19.8% of those surveyed oppose the exemption.  
<P>
Party affiliation does not appear to have any impact on the level of support, with 70.1% of Republicans, 72.8% of Democrats, 68% of Independents, and 72.7% of Reform Party members supporting the exemption.  
<P>
"Support for the ethanol tax incentive is both strong and bi-partisan," said Vaughn.  "Voters realize that this is a program which creates jobs and stimulates investment here at home, while reducing our nation's trade deficit and improving the economy."

This survey validates our belief that House Ways & Means Committee Chairman Archer's misguided intention to repeal the ethanol incentive is not supported by voters.

Voters were also asked whether the government should continue to give tax breaks or subsidies to oil companies to ensure a steady supply of oil, and 8 out of 10 responded that they prefer redirecting current federal tax policies to encourage the use of domestically produced fuels.

<CENTER><B>DECLINING PRODUCTION, RISING CONSUMPTION INCREASING RELIANCE ON OIL IMPORTS</B></CENTER> 
<P>
According to the early release of its Annual Energy Outlook (AEO) 1997, the Energy Information Administration (EIA) projects crude oil production in the U.S. will decline to 5.2 million barrels a day in 2015 as a result of lower projected oil prices.  This compares with the projection of 5.8 million barrels per day in the 1996 AEO.  
<P>
On average, U.S. oil production declines by 1.1 percent a year between 1995 and 2015, consistent with long-term historical trends.  The EIA does not anticipate advances in oil discovery technologies will be sufficient to offset declining resources.
<P>
Average world crude oil prices are projected to be about $21/bbl (‘95$) in 2015, $5 lower than the $26/bbl projection from 1996.  The EIA notes that lower prices reflect expectations that oil production from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) will expand and that technology advances will sustain non-OPEC production. 
<P>
The lower energy prices predicted in the 1997 AEO result in higher total consumption projections for 2015.  In fact, the EIA assumes that increases in light-duty vehicle miles traveled more than offset the increases in vehicle efficiency throughout the projection period.
<P>
<U><B>Oil Import Share to Rise from 44 to 61%</B></U><BR>
Declining production and rising consumption lead to growing reliance on petroleum imports through 2015.  The EIA projects the share of petroleum consumption met by imports to rise from 44% in 1995 (measured in barrels per day) to 61% by 2015.

<B>U.S. Trade Deficit Reaches Record $48 Bln</B></CENTER>
<P>
The U.S. trade deficit soared to $48 bln from July-September, the worst quarter ever, as American exports 
fell for the first time in three years.  Historically, oil imports are the single largest component of the 
U.S. trade deficit.  Domestic ethanol production displaces over 43.5 mln barrels of imported oil per year, 
decreasing our trade deficit by $645 mln.</TD></TR></TABLE>

<CENTER><B>RESEARCHERS STRIVE TO INCREASE ETHANOL YIELD FROM CORN</B></CENTER></CENTER>
<P>
<I>The following is excerpted from an article written by Ben Hardin, ARS, that appeared in Agricultural Research, October 1996</I>
<P>
Ethanol to fuel cars early in the 21st century may come from fiber-laden crop residues - instead of feed grains - if a vision of agricultural researchers at Peoria, Illinois, pans out.
<P>
But before that vision is fully realized, science and technology will most likely enable ethanol producers to squeeze a bit more ethanol from corn - the main source at present.
<P>
Through fermentation of starches and sugars found inside the grain, modern ethanol plants now produce 2.5 gallons of ethyl alcohol - ethanol - from each bushel of corn.
<P>
[Agricultural Research Service (ARS) scientists at the National Center for Agricultural Utilization Research (NCAUR)] have their sights set on making fiber in the grain's outer layer yield nearly 0.3 additional gallons per bushel.
<P>
The wet-milling process involves soaking, or steeping, the corn in water, grinding it, and separating high-protein germ, oil, and fiber from the starchy endosperm that is fermented to produce ethanol.  The current practice is to mix the fiber fraction with fermentation solubles before drying it and forming animal feeds.
<P>
"We estimate that if the fiber were also processed into ethanol, a corn wet-milling facility that produces 100 million gallons of 
ethanol per year could generate an additional $4 to $8 million of annual income," says microbiologist Robert Hespell.
<P>
The research strategy for economically converting fiber to ethanol is three pronged.  
They hope to:
<P>
<li>find better ways to physically and chemically treat the fiber to expedite its conversion to sugars,
<P>
<li>find enzymes that better convert the fiber to sugars, and
<P>
<li>custom engineer suitable microbes to ferment the sugars D-glucose, D-xylose, and L-arabinose.
<P>
At College Station, Texas A&M University, researchers applied a pretreatment called ammonia fiber explosion (AFEX) to corn fiber to unlock its potential for fermentation.  With it, NCAUR scientists found they could convert some 50 to 60 percent of the pretreated fiber's components - cellulose, hemicellulose, and starch - into fermentable sugars called monosaccharides, while converting an additional 20 to 30 percent of the fiber into short sugar polymers.
<P>
In the AFEX process, a slurry of water and corn fiber is mixed with highly pressurized liquid ammonia.  Quickly releasing the pressure splits the fiber's bundles of carbohydrate components that are normally rather inaccessible to chemicals or microbes because they are so tightly glued together by lignin.
<P>
Researchers treated the lignin-freed polymers with mixtures of commercial enzymes.  Some enzymes called amylases and cellulases thoroughly hydrolyzed, or split apart, chains of starch and cellulose into links of simple fermentable sugars such as glucose, each with a backbone of six carbon atoms.  Today's ethanol plants typically use bakers' yeast - Saccharomyces cerevisiae - to produce ethanol only from these 6-carbon sugars called hexoses.
<P>
From the corn hemicellulose, or arabinoxylan, xylanase enzymes clipped off at least 25 percent of the component pentoses or 5-carbon sugars - monosaccharides such as arabinose and xylose.  That success was enough to spur a search for xylanases that might be recruited to enhance ethanol production.
<P>
"If we can find bacteria that produce more active xylanases, this ethanol research might also lead to improving the efficiency with which ruminant livestock such as cattle and sheep digest hemicellulosic crop residues," says Hespell.

<CENTER><B>AGRICULTURAL PERSPECTIVE ON ENVIRONMENTAL PROGRESS</B>
<P>
<I>By Steve Wentworth</I></CENTER>
<P>
In the late 1980s and the early ‘90s, the years when I was involved in the leadership of the National Corn Growers Association, most agriculturists would respond to any challenge from the environmental community with predictable arguments: "Farmers are the original environmentalists." Or "Our children drink this well water," implying that farmers wouldn't intentionally expose their family or factory to pollution.  
<P>
Those statements were fine for starters, but they often failed to convince critics concerned about trace levels of nitrates or pesticides.  To retain society's trust we need to demonstrate and quantify how we are making environmental progress, not just complain that we are misunderstood.
<P>
When I spoke to an audience of 500 consumers and environmentalists recently, I stressed how technology has allowed me - and the rest of American agriculture - to continually improve the relationship between farming and the environment.
<P>
Just compare an 80-acre corn field I cropped in 1974, the year I started farming, to the same field 20 years later.  It is testimony that high yields and environmentally friendly farming can co-exist:
<P>

<li> In 1974 the field across the road from my home produced 11,200 bushels of corn or 140 bushels per acre. [In 1994], the same field yielded 226 bushels per acre or a total production of over 18,000 bushels.  Obviously, good weather plays a role, but it was still a 60% increase.
<P>
<li> I applied 190 lb. of supplemental nitrogen to the corn in 1974.  Twenty years later I raise a bigger crop on 40 lb. less nitrogen, a 20% reduction.  All 150 units of nitrogen came from ammonium sulfate, a byproduct of lysine production at a local corn processing plant, and was recycled on that field.

While U.S. consumers have increased their<BR> 
reliance on foreign oil since the Arab embargo,<BR>
I have cut my consumption more than 80%.<BR>
<HR WIDTH=350>
</CENTER>
<LI>Back in 1974 it took 113 machinery hours and 865 gal. of fuel to farm that 80 acres.  Through reduced tillage and larger equipment, I was able to plant, raise and harvest the crop with just 23 hours of equipment time and 147 gallons of fuel.  Upshot: While U.S. consumers have increased their reliance on foreign oil since the Arab embargo, I have cut my consumption more than 80%.
<P>
<LI>For weed control in 1974, I applied 8 lb. of herbicides per acre.  By planting a seed corn variety bred to be imazethapyr-tolerant today, I had virtually no weeds while using 4 oz. of Pursuit per acre or only 2.5 gal. on the whole field.
<P>
<LI>Roughly 50% of all Illinois farmland exceeded the tolerable limits for soil loss in 1974.  Now due to the rapid adoption of no-till and conservation tillage, less than 25% exceeds the standard.
<P>
Just a year ago, I and several other farmers helped start a new organization: Foundation EARTH (Environment, Agriculture, Research and Technology in Harmony).  Foundation EARTH recognizes that farmers everywhere place great value on conserving the richness and integrity of the environment in which we farm. 
<P>
Last year we asked farmers to make a Pledge to Earth.  Dozens of producers around the country already are putting those plans in action.  Some are building wildlife habitats, adding filter strips, expanding no-till acreage, and adopting precision farming practices that allow them to apply the most appropriate levels of fertilizers and other inputs.  Our goal is to educate both farmers and consumers on technologies that boost profits yet protect the earth's limited resources.
