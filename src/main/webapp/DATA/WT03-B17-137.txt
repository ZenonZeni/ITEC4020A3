Students are encouraged to pursue the Master's degree on a full-time basis. 
Under special circumstances students are permitted to enroll on a part-time 
basis. Students who are part time must complete the Master's program within 
six years.
<P>
A part-time degree seeking student is enrolled to receive academic credit toward
the Master's degree and is registered at the American College of Traditional Chinese 
Medicine for less than 12 units of course work per quarter.  To enroll a student must 
meet the admission requirements, pay a $100.00 non-refundable application fee, 
complete the admission procedure and pay the per unit rate of tuition. Part-time 
students beginning the program may enter in the Fall quarter or Spring quarter only.  
Transfer students may enter during any appropriate quarter.
<P>
An entering student with more than 3 courses of pre-professional requirements to 
satisfy is required to register as a part-time student.
<P>
All part-time students are required to meet with an advisor and obtain the advisor's 
signature on their registration forms prior to each quarter registration. It is the students'
responsibility to monitor their progress toward graduation and to take the appropriate 
required courses each quarter.
<P>
International students will be accepted and allowed to register as full-time students ONLY.
