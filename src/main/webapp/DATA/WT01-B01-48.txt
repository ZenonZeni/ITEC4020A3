<blockquote>
<CITE>CPJ's mission is to promote freedom of the press throughout the world by defending 
the right of journalists to report the news without fear of reprisal.<P>
</CITE>
<h3>What is CPJ?</H3>
The Committee to Protect Journalists is a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization founded in 1981 to monitor and protest  abuses against working journalists and their news organizations, regardless of their ideology or nationality. CPJ is the only organization in the United States with a full-time staff devoted to documenting and responding to violations of press freedoms throughout the world.<BR>
<h3>How did CPJ get started?</h3>
A group of U.S. foreign correspondents created CPJ in response to the often brutal treatment of their foreign colleagues by authoritarian governments and other enemies of independent journalism.<BR>
 <BR>
<h3>Who runs CPJ?</h3>
CPJ's professional staff--based in New York City--includes an area specialist for each region of the world. These specialists track press conditions in their regions through independent research, reports from the field and fact-finding missions. The Committee's activities are directed by a board of prominent U.S. journalists.<BR>
<h3>The press is so powerful; why does it need protection?</h3>
The press in the United States does have great power and enjoys legal protection. But that's not the case everywhere. On average, at least one journalist is killed every week somewhere in the world. Scores of journalists are imprisoned every year because of what they have reported. And hundreds more are routinely subjected to physical attack, illegal detention, spurious legal action and threats against their safety.<BR>
<h3>How is CPJ funded?</h3>
CPJ is entirely dependent on private donations from journalists, news organizations and foundations. To maintain its independence, CPJ does not accept government funding.<P>

<BR>
<h3>How does CPJ "protect" journalists? </h3>
By verifying and publicizing press freedom violations and by acting on behalf of imprisoned and threatened journalists, CPJ seeks to combat such abuses. CPJ organizes vigorous campaigns at all levels--using a range of local and international media--and, when necessary, works behind the scenes through governmental and other channels to effect change. <BR>
<BR>
<h3>When would a journalist call upon CPJ?</h3>
<strong>In an emergency. </strong>Using local contacts, CPJ can intervene anytime foreign correspondents are in trouble. CPJ is also prepared to immediately notify news organizations, government officials and human rights organizations of press freedom violations.<BR>
<br>
<P><strong>Before travel. </strong>Call CPJ for local contacts around the world or for practical advice regarding dangerous assignments. Or visit the Correspondent&#146;s SafetyNet at this Web site for safety tips and other vital information about reporting from danger zones.<BR>
<CITE><P>
</CITE>
<P><strong>On assignment. </strong> CPJ provides information to journalists to help them better protect themselves while covering dangerous situations, and provides contacts and other practical information to foreign editors and correspondents in the field.<P>

<P>
<BR>
<h3>What else does CPJ do?</h3>

<LI TYPE=DISC>Reports by CPJ are transmitted instantly to other press freedom organizations worldwide via fax and the Internet. <BR>

<LI TYPE=DISC>CPJ provides safety training to foreign journalists and offers current information about foreign news organizations and local press conditions.<BR>
