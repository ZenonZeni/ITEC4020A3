DRUG POSSESSION CHARGE 
 
Urbandale officer arrested in D.M. 
 
'Scores' of sex-oriented items are also found in the van driven 
by police veteran James Trimble.

     James R. Trimble, Urbandale police officer and school 
liaison officer for the Urbandale district, was arrested early 
Monday for allegedly possessing methamphetamine with the intent 
to deliver. 
     Also found were "scores" of sex-oriented pictures and 
letters.  No charges relating to those had been filed by Monday 
night. 
     Trimble, an 18-year Urbandale police veteran, will likely be 
suspended until the investigation is completed, Urbandale Police 
Chief David Hamlin said. 
     Trimble, 43 was pulled over by Des Moines police about 4 
a.m. in the 600 block of Clark Street.  In a police report, 
Officer Steven Kees said, "There was a substantial amount of what 
appeared to be meth in the van. 
     Besides Trimble, of 501 Second St., West Des Moines, a woman 
with him in the van was also aressted: Lorrie K. Breiholz, 34, of 
433 S.E. Phillip St., No. 106, in Des Moines.  Both were charged 
with possession of narcotics with the intent to deliver them. 
 
Wife Is Arrested, Too 
     Trimble's wife was arrested six hours after he was when 
police raided their home.  Robin Lynn Trimble, 41, was charged 
with possession of narcotics.  A police report of the search 
alleged she was in possession of marijuana. 
     Trimble's mother, Beverly, let police search her home at 
7213 Palm Drive in Urbandale.  They found nothing.  Police said 
the van Trimble was driving, which belongs to his mother, was 
circling a neighborhood north of downtown when Breiholz was seen 
by police not wearing a seat belt.  They said when Trimble pulled 
over, he made movements toward the center of the van "as if he 
was trying to hide or reach for something." 
     Trimble got out of the van and walked toward officers, and 
he did not get back in the van as ordered.  The police report 
said he was "extremely nervous." 
     While Trimble was detained in a police car, he told Kees 
that he was an Urbandale police officer.  Officers found a 
substance in the van, and a field test indicated that it was 
methamphetamine.  Des Moines police also called Hamlin, 
Urbandale's chief, to tell him what happened. 
     In a telephone interview Monday night, Hamlin said he was 
shocked when he got the news. 
     "He had a good work record, a good reputation with the 
department," Hamlin said.  "I found it rather stunning to hear 
about it." 
     Hamlin said he had not consulted with the city attorney, but 
he said he intends to suspend Trimble pending further 
investigation.  "At that time, I'll determine his long-term 
status," he said. 
     Hamlin said Trimble had been the school liaison officer for 
five years. 
     "I had no idea," Superintendent Tom Davis said of the news 
Monday.  He referred questions to school attorney Jeff Krausman. 
     Krausman said officials could not comment because Trimble is 
employed jointly by the school district and the city. 
     Trimble was active in D.A.R.E. (Drug Abuse Resistance 
Education), an anti-drug education program.  "We don't just teach 
kids what drugs look like," Trimble said in a 1992 interview.  
"We teach life skills needed to say no to drugs, alcohol and 
tobacco. 
     Trimble was being held at the Des Moines City Jail Monday 
night.  Bond was set at $19,500.</pre></body></html>
