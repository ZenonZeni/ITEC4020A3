<H1>From the Convention Circuit ... We find another of Dr.
Gerson's patients</H1>
<H4>by Charlotte Gerson</H4>
<P>At the end of September, 1996, I had the great pleasure
of visiting the New York Chiropractic College. I was invited
to address the faculty and students, discussing the Gerson
Therapy. The following day, I did the usual lecture and
workshop for the public.I received a warm reception, and
thank the students and faculty for their help. I was deeply
impressed by the magnificent campus, set among rolling green
hills, studded with beautiful, majestic trees. The light,
airy buildings are situated along one of New York's extensive
finger lakes. There is a feeling of peace and beauty, very
conducive to study and meditation.</P>
<P>I received great joy from the testimonial of one of the
members of the audience. This gentleman introduced himself as
the nephew of one of the 50 cases (Case #18) Dr. Gerson
described in <A href="booklist.html#acancertherapy">
<I>A Cancer Therapy</I></A>. William Schickel. at age 32 was a
struggling artist with a young family, three small children,
the youngest a baby, and a 22 year old wife. He had been
diagnosed with inoperable, widespread retroperitoneal
lymphoma. Radiation was not an option, and he was literally
sent home with perhaps two months to live. Bill's wife, Mary,
found an article in a magazine on organic gardening in which
she read that Dr. Gerson was curing cancer by diet. Following
a pilgrimage to the shrine of the Blessed Philippine
Duschene, their decision was made: they would go to see Dr.
Gerson in New York City. </P>
<P>They arrived in the spring of 1950 from their home in
Loveland, Ohio. After numerous tests, Dr. Gerson felt that
Bill had perhaps a 30% chance of recovery on the nutritional
therapy. Bill was surprised that, in spite of the quiet
elegance of a Park Avenue office, Dr. Gerson's fees were
&quot;very modest&quot;. Gerson also told Bill that he would
not cure him but that his reactivated defenses, his body
would work to heal him.</P>
<P>Struggling physically and financially to follow this
demanding treatment, but with nothing to lose, Bill reports
that he felt better within a few weeks. He received no other
treatment.Bill writes that in 1983 he looked back on &quot;33
years, eight children, twelve grandchildren, and a wonderful
productive life&quot;. In September, 1996 (46 years after his
prognosis of 'two months'), Bill and his wife Mary beam from
the cover of <I>St. Anthony's Messenger</I>, inside of which
is the inspiring story of Bills activities. He is a famous
artist, designs and builds churches, church art and stained
glass windows, assisted by his sons and daughter Martha in
his art studio. Bill won national honors for his interior
design and artwork for the new St. Mary's Church in St.
Clairsville, Ohio. Some years ago, he also had an art show in
San Diego which I was proud to visit. Now 77, Bill works full
time with his family in his studio. When I spoke to him to
ask permission to publish this story, I could hear the energy
and enthusiasm in his strong voice. His story is copyrighted
and he expects to publish it sometime in the future. </P>
<P>We are grateful to Dr. Gerson for having given this
creative, prolific and talented artist the chance to live a
long, healthy and productive life, and make his quite
significant contribution to the world. </P>
