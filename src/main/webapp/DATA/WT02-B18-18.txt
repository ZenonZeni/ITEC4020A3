<CENTER><H2>Pet&eacuten, Guatemala</H2></CENTER>

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In the dense jungle cover of Guatemala's vast northeastern department of El Pet&eacuten, you may hear the squawk of parrots, the chatter of monkeys and the rustlings of strange animals moving through the bush.  The landscape here is utterly different from that of Guatemala's cool mountainous highlands or its steamy Pacific Slope.
<P>
<IMG SRC="../../../RESOURCE/SLIDES/ECOESC/Tikal.jpg" ALT="Tikal.jpg - 8.1 K" WIDTH=141 HEIGHT=206 HSPACE=10 VSPACE=10 BORDER=0 ALIGN=right>The monumental Mayan ceremonial centre at Tikal is a major stop on La Ruta Maya.  The ruins of Uaxact&uacuten and Ceibal, though not so easily accessible, are perhaps more exciting to visit for that reason.  Several dozen other great cities lie hidden in El Pet&eacuten's jungles, accessible only to archaeologists with aircraft or to artifact poachers with stonecutting tools.
<P>
The battle for El Pet&eacuten is raging even as you read this.  Will it be left alone and preserved as one vast natural and archaeological zone?  Will its forests be cut and cut by farmers and cattle ranchers until the lush green carpet of trees and vines all but disappears, as has happened just across the border in Mexico?  Or will the idea of La Ruta Maya--careful environmental and archaeological preservation through managed development with economic benefits for all--triumph. . .  In 1990 the Guatemalan government established the one million-hectare Maya Biosphere Reserve, including most of northern El Pet&eacuten.  The Guatemalan reserve adjoins vast Calakmul Biosphere Reserve in Mexico and the Rio Bravo Conservation Area in Belize, forming a huge multinational reserve of over two million hectares.
<P>
There are three reasons to penetrate the forests of El Pet&eacuten:  firstly to visit Tikal, the greatest Mayan religious center yet discovered; secondly to enjoy the great variety of birdlife, including the rare, shy quetzal; and thirdly, to see a different Guatemala, one of small farming villages and jungle hamlets, without paved roads or colonial architecture.
