<b>Hydrogen Production from Plasma Reforming

<P>

High-temperature, noncatalytic reforming using plasma technology

can provide a number of advantages over conventional catalytic

reforming.  A plasma reformer is being investigated at the MIT

Plasma Fusion Center as a method for reforming hydrocarbon fuels.

The hydrogen-rich gas could be used for decentralized electricity

generation or in transportation.  A plasma reformer system increases

fuel flexibility because it can operate using any hydrocarbon,

including heavy fractions.  In addition, it may be possible to

operate in a pyrolytic mode, where the carbon from the hydrocarbon

fuels is converted to soot and is not consumed, virtually eliminating

CO<sub>2</sub> production.  The fast kinetic rates obtained at the high 
gas

temperatures enabled by plasma technology can greatly reduce the

volume and weight of the reformer, making reformers more compact.

This feature is important for onboard transportation applications.

<P>

In this project, plasma reformer operation in pyrolytic, partial

oxidation, and steam reforming modes will be studied.  Experimental

and theoretical studies are being carried out to investigate the

feasibility and engineering of compact plasma reformers and the

kinetics of high-temperature uncatalyzed reforming.

<b><i>Recent Advances:</i></b>

<P>

We have done thermodynamic calculations and chemical kinetic modeling

of plasma-driven partial oxidation.  An experimental plasma facility

was constructed and initial tests were performed using methane.

The plasmatron demonstrated startup and response times on the

order of 10-100 milliseconds, with heating efficiencies greater

than 80%.  Modifications to Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy

have been completed that will allow in situ measurements of the

plasma stream temperature and concentrations of water, CO, 
CO<sub>2</sub>,

and hydrocarbons.
