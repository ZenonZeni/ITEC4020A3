<FONT SIZE=+1><STRONG>What to Do When Someone Dies</STRONG></FONT><BR>
<STRONG>Making The Necessary Arrangements</STRONG>
<P>



The death of a family member or close personal friend is a difficult subject for
almost everyone.  The
tendency is to postpone dealing with it until the time comes.  Unfortunately, when
it does, survivors are
expected to make many crucial financial and legal decisions.
<P>
For a grieving  and unprepared person, the pressure to make these decisions can
seem
overwhelming.  It need not be.  Preparation is the key.
<P>
<STRONG>Contact a Funeral Director</STRONG><BR>
Following the death of a loved one, families usually rely upon the funeral director
for guidance.  It is
important that this person be involved immediately because he or she can begin to
help you make
arrangements for funeral services and burials.
<P>
<STRONG>Contact Your Life Insurance Agent</STRONG><BR>
You should also contact the deceased's life insurance agent. In most cases, life
insurance companies
require only two forms to establish proof of claim: a claimant's statement and a
death certificate or an
attending physician's statement.  The claimant's statement must be completed by the
beneficiary.
If you are the beneficiary, you'll be facing crucial financial decisions at a time
when you may be least
prepared to make sound financial decisions.  To add to the burden, the amount of
money involved may
be very large.  For this reason, many companies, including New York Life, offer an
interest-bearing
money market-type account that allows you to write checks against your benefit
proceeds the same day
you receive your checkbook.  This provides immediate access to and complete control
of your
proceeds, while they earn a competitive rate of interest and a guarantee of
principal by the insurer.  It
gives you the time you need to evaluate your changed financial situation and to
talk things over with
your
trusted advisors.
<P>
<STRONG>Contact a Legal Advisor</STRONG><BR>
When a loved one dies, you should seek legal advice on such matters as re-recording
property deeds
and the disposition of stocks, bonds, and savings.  Also, the disbursement of the
insured's business
and estate assets, and the drawing up of a will for the widow or widower, will
require immediate
attention.
<P>
<STRONG>Locate Important Papers</STRONG><BR>
Aside from any insurance policies, remember to think about safe-deposit boxes,
business
agreements, bankbooks, and securities certificates; real estate deeds; wills;
recent copies of income
tax return forms, W-2 forms and other records of earning; Social Security number;
marriage and birth
certificates; military discharge papers, Veterans Administration claim number;
automobile registration;
and installment payment books.  The death certificate is the basic document you
will be working with. 
You'll need a number of copies, so you can establish claims under life insurance
policies and file for
Social Security and Veterans benefits.  In many cases, the funeral director can
secure certified copies.
<P>
<STRONG>Visit Trust Officer and Tax Attorney</STRONG><BR>
A local trust officer is an important resource for survivors.  This individual is
an expert financial advisor
who deals in investments, estate settlements, and household finances.  A tax
attorney or CPA should
be consulted if you think that the deceased's estate might be subject to federal
taxation.
<P>
<STRONG>Contact Employer</STRONG><BR>
Be sure to contact immediately the deceased's place of employment.  Since most
people are covered
by group insurance where they work, inquire about the benefit due you and how to
file a claim.  Also,
ask about pension fund benefits, accrued vacation and sick pay, terminal pay
allowances, disability
income, and credit union balances.  Pay special attention to the deceased's
hospital, surgical, and
disability coverages to see whether you and your dependents are still eligible for
benefits and, if so, for
how long.
<P>
<STRONG>Gather All Current Bills</STRONG><BR>
Many installment loans, service contracts, and credit card accounts are covered by
credit life insurance,
which pays off the account balance in the event of the death of a customer. Make a
prompt request for
release to each bank in which the deceased and you held a joint account.  This is
preliminary to your
withdrawing funds from that account.  Property-casualty insurance policies should
be updated to reflect
changes in ownership.
<P>
<STRONG>Contact Organizations</STRONG><BR>
Contact unions, service organizations, or professional organizations the deceased
belonged to in order
to find out whether you are eligible for any benefits.  Many such groups offer life
insurance policies at
group rates.
<P>
<STRONG>Contact Social Security Office</STRONG><BR>
If the deceased was covered under Social Security, you may be eligible for a
lump-sum death benefit.  It
is usually paid to the surviving spouse, but it can be paid to others under certain
circumstances.
<P>
<STRONG>Meet Advisors</STRONG><BR>
Now is the time to secure the services of professional financial advisors who will
make sure that your
records are in order and see to it that your wishes are met.  The best time to make
contact with a lawyer
is now.  That's because the best time to prepare a will is now. Your insurance
agent can help in settling
your insurance claims, including planning for future monthly income needs, as well as
education, business, and
retirement funding.  Also, he or she can assist you (along with your attorney) with your
estate planning,
so
that you will derive
maximum benefit from your estate while you are still living.<P>
