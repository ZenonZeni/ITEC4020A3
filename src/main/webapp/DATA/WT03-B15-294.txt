<H1>UK ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENT FORECASTING SERVICE</H1></CENTER>
<P>Subscribers to CE's UK Industrial Service are able to benefit from an add-on
service providing energy and environment forecasts consistent with the economic
forecasts.</P>
<H2>What makes the Cambridge Econometrics service different?</H2>
<P>There are many energy analysts and economic forecasters producing forecasts
of oil prices or electricity sales, but these tend to be produced in isolation,
or with limited links to related economic factors.</P>
<P>By contrast, the Cambridge Multisectoral Dynamic Model of the UK economy
(MDM) produces one of the most detailed sets of forecasts available, including
consumer demand for 68 commodities, and forecasts of output by 50 industries on
a bottom-up basis.</P>
<P>An energy sub-model is integrated within the main model.  Inputs, such as
prices and levels of economic activity, feed into the sub-model from the main
model.  A set of energy demand equations, for total energy and  by fuel type, is
used to determine final demand for 10 fuels by 12 different user groups.  In
addition, a separate capacity-based sub-model of the electricity supply industry
calculates fuel use by power generation, and there is a technology-based
sub-model of domestic energy demand.</P>
<P>The forecast fuel demands feed back into the main model to give expenditure
on fuels by industry, consumers and government.</P>
<P>Emissions of CO<SUB>2</SUB> and SO<SUB>2</SUB> (and, in due course, a
range of other environmental emissions) are calculated from the forecast fuel
use.</P>
<H2>The Service</H2>
<P>The service provides a report published twice a year as a supplement to <I>Industry
and the British Economy</I>, and forecasts are available on diskette.</P>
<P>The reports summarise the key energy/environment assumptions and include the
following forecast tables to 2010:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Fuel Demand by Fuel Type, original units</LI></UL>
<P>For each fuel type, fuel use by user is shown - see the attached sample
table.  Enables identification of market for each fuel type, eg Demand for Coal
by Power Generation, Chemicals industry</P>
<UL>
<LI>Fuel Demand by Fuel User, mtoe</LI></UL>
<P>For each fuel user, fuel use by type is shown.  Enables identification of
market shares, eg Power Generation demand for Coal, Gas, Fuel Oil</P>
<UL>
<LI>Growth in Prices of Main Fuels to each User Group</LI></UL>
<UL>
<LI>Carbon Emissions by Fuel Type and by Fuel User</LI></UL>
<UL>
<LI>Sulphur Emissions by Fuel Type and by Fuel User</LI></UL>
<H2>Scenarios</H2>
<P>Subscribers are also able to commission their own scenarios against
individual quotations.  If you subscribe to the Full Industrial Service, you can
use your two scenarios to explore energy and environment linkages with the UK
economy.  The Cambridge model is particularly well suited to testing for example
the effect of environmental tax reform on energy use, carbon emissions, sulphur
emissions, and the macroeconomy, and is able to capture the effects of such tax
reform at the level of each industry in a manner consistent with activity
throughout the whole economy.</P>
