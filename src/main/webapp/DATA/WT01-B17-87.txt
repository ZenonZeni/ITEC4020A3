<H2 ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER>Treating the Body and Mind of a Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Patient</CENTER></H2>

Chinese Medicine says that over 90% of all diseases have a psychological
and emotional origin. This statement has continually influenced
my work. I believe you cannot possibly heal somebody through Chinese
medicine without working through a great deal of their issues.
As soon as you start getting the body well, these deeper causes
of the physical symptoms will begin to surface. You 
<I>
have to work
</I>
on them, because otherwise they will come back up into the body
again and produce more symptoms.
<P>
To do this, I use acupuncture, moxabustion, herbs, counseling,
even flower essences and color therapy, to give the patient enough
strength to start looking at the deeper problems with clarity.
Let me show you how these factors worked in a recent case.
<P>
Elaine, age 45, came to me with deep depression and extreme exhaustion.
She had low energy, no concentration, bad memory, fevers, sweat,
chills, poor sleep, dizziness, cold extremities, high blood pressure,
respiratory problems, irregular periods, back, neck, and muscle
pain. I saw darkness about her; she was very defensive, almost
ready to cry, even at innocuous remarks. She had been previously
treated for a chronic bladder and kidney obstruction, and was
still sporadically unable to urinate.
<P>
Elaine had suffered these chronic symptoms for 4 years. In Chinese
Medicine terms, Elaine had 
<I>
kidney yang deficiency, 
</I>
which means she didn't have enough 
<I>
yang, 
</I>
or active, fiery energy in her kidneys, leaving her sluggish, passive, inactive, fearful, tired, holding
water, and with no will power.
<P>
During her first 90 minute session, I inserted need-les on all
organ points on her back, especially her kidney points, then following
this with moxabustion (burning little pieces of mugwort over her
skin) to strengthen her vital energy. I also made suggestions
as the needles remained in place: &quot;Elaine, I'm working on
your kidneys now, so let's release fear and anxiety. It's 
<I>
safe
</I>
to release fear.&quot; This had immediate effects.
<P>
Elaine knew she had deeply buried emotions but didn't know how
to process them. All the time I was treating her physically, I
was also working with the emotional and psychological energies
associated with her physical symptoms. Her back went into spasms
and ripples as she started coming in contact with these old painful
feelings-such as incest with an uncle, grief over the death of
a malformed infant, feelings of guilt taken on from her dead mother,
sadness over the fact she had never known her father. She was
also in a marriage that had been abusive for years, which before
seeing me, she had resigned herself to living with.
<P>
After the first session, her spirits lifted and she was able to
have a sense of humor and objectivity about her condition. I gave
her five flower essences to take hourly to help further lift her
mood, including Self-Heal, California Pitcher Plant, St. John's
Wort, Scotch Broom, and Fuschia.
<P>
After her second session, I prescribed a mixture of Chinese herbs
to improve Elaine's energy, to help her bladder and kidney problem,
and tone her digestion. These included 
<I>
Fo-ti, 
</I>
to nourish and detoxify the blood; 
<I>
fructus Lycii, 
</I>
to help liver and kidney energy; 
<I>
fu-shen, 
</I>
for calming the spirit; 
<I>
dong-quai, 
</I>
to build up the blood; aconite, to bring up energy; astragalus, for the night sweats. She took
these twice a day, in liquid form, for about 3 months, but I modified
the mix according to her symptoms.
<P>
I also gave her color each session, using a German-made Vegalux
color generator to project different colors (through little flashlights
at the tips of fiber optic tubes) onto her skin. I find color
therapy to be a soothing, energy-building adjunct to acupuncture.
For example, I used orange on her lower abdomen for endocrine
insufficiency, and blue and yellow on her feet to release stress
and prenatal feelings.
<P>
As the needles, moxabustion, flowers, color, and herbs built up
her energy, Elaine began to have a lot of emotional releases and
psychological insights, which surprised and encouraged her. She
is a good patient, willing to do the hard work of healing.
<P>
For example, during her second session, Elaine said it was as
if an animal were trying to eat her up from the inside, devouring
all her energy. Another time she said she felt she had a &quot;hole&quot;
in her body (or energy field) out of which energy kept leaking.
All this time she had been making drawings of volcanoes that could
only blow steam and lava out their sides, not their tops.
<P>
After 6 treatments, Elaine had enough energy to realize her marriage
was not satisfactory and to resume doing things she couldn't do
for years. This is what her healing is about: having the energy
to face her life issues (and bad marriage) and to make the necessary
changes. It means now, after only 8 sessions spread over 3 months,
she's strong enough to move courageously to take control of her
life again. Elaine is about 70% cured and I'm confident the treatment
is working as her energy is steadily improving.
<P>
Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, from my perspective, is about deep-seated
emotions, deeply repressed feelings of anger and self-hatred,
that have finally affected the immune and digestive systems, producing
a host of symptoms. Elaine's illness was probably brewing for
7 years before she came to me, and for about 3 years before all
the symptoms started. Her newborn child's death 7 years earlier
might have triggered it all, producing a deep sadness and feeling
of futility. The body follows these emotional clues and begins
to weaken; but then as the person starts to get physically well,
these old, buried issues start to come up again and must be dealt
with as part of the healing process.
<P>
It all comes down to what we say in alternative medicine: you
have to treat the whole person of body, mind, and spirit. You
cannot just treat the body or the spirit alone, because they're
one system.
<P>
