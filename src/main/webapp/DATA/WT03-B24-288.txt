<P><FONT SIZE=+3>If you think we're free from censorship . . . </FONT>

<P  align=right><FONT color=red SIZE=+5> . . . . think again</FONT>

<B><P>If you think books aren't banned . . . you're wrong.

<P>Censors have been trying to ban books with unorthodox or unpopular points-of-view  since at least 387 B.C. Even books like dictionaries, textbooks, travel guides and the Bible have been banned. Censors have attacked everything from the plays of William Shakespeare to the novels of Mark Twain. If every book that anyone found objectionable were banned, there would be no books left. 

<P>Books are sometimes censored because of a single word or because the cover suggests a subject matter offensive to someone, even if that person has not read the book. (Some do <I>judge</I> a book by its cover.) Censors have also targetted all works by an author after reading only one. Every year, hundreds of books are challenged and banned in libraries and schools all over the world. In the United States, censorship incidents have been documented in every state, including California. At the Northern California Independent Booksellers Association, we think books are a great way to learn about many issues - things we sometimes have a hard time talking about. Not everyone will agree on everything, but if we read, reason and think, books will help us to a better future. Reading is not just a privilege in this country, it's a right. Let's keep it that way.

<P>If you think there is room for more than one opinion . . . you're right ! </B>

<P>At the NCIBA, we maintain an active vigil in defense of free speech. We believe the free exchange of ideas cannot be taken for granted. Free speech is as intrinsic to a democratic society as it is to our own livelihoods.

<P>Members of the NCIBA have testified before the State Assembly in Sacramento regarding free speech issues, and we have joined with concerned parties in other industries in voicing our concern over threatening legislation. When the Board of Education removed short stories by Alice Walker and Annie Dillard from statewide tests for 10th graders, the NCIBA coordinated a joint effort with publishers to place copies of those author's books in every high school library in the State of California. Our member stores have also led local campaigns in their own cities and neighborhoods to raise awareness around censorship concerns. We believe free speech cannot be taken for granted.

<P>Freedom of speech is the foundation of bookselling in the United States. Without the First Admendment, publishers are not free to choose which books to publish, booksellers are not free to choose which books to order, display and sell, and readers are not free to decide which books they wish to read. Without freedom of speech, not only books but the very commerce of ideas would be stifled.

<P>In this American election year, its <I>especially</I> important to cast your vote for free speech on-line and in print !
