<H3>Introduction</H3>

<P>

High-temperature superconductivity, the ability of certain materials

to conduct electricity with very high efficiency, can directly

influence the competitiveness of the United States in the world

industrial market.  The opportunity to develop electric power 
applications

that use high-temperature superconductors provides the United

States with a chance to establish a new technologically advanced

industry that will create high-paying jobs.  These advanced products

will also help industry gain an edge in the highly competitive,

multi-billion-dollar-a-year, international market for electric

power equipment.  

<P>

Largely due to government and private industry

partnerships, <I>only 7 years after the discovery of high-temperature

superconductivity, </I>electric power applications based upon

high-temperature superconductivity are now being designed and

tested.  These applications offer many benefits to the national

electric system:

<UL>

<LI>increased energy efficiency (reduced losses),

<LI>reduced equipment size,

<LI>reduced emissions,

<LI>increased stability and reliability,

<LI>deferred expansion, and

<LI>flexible electricity dispatch and load management.

</UL>

<P>

All of these benefits have a common outcome: lower electricity

costs and improved environmental quality.  

<P>

In light of the benefits

offered by high-temperature superconductive electric power applications,


the United States Department of Energy (DOE) sponsors research

and development (R&D) through its Superconductivity Program

for Electric Power Systems.  This program will help develop the

technology needed for U.S. industry to commercialize high-temperature

superconductive electric power applications.  

<P>
Through this R&D,
DOE envisions that by 2010 the U.S. electric power systems equipment

industry will regain a major share of the global market by offering

superconducting products that outperform the competition.  In the

United States, the electric power system will gain efficiency

and flexibility through increased use of high-temperature 
superconductive

devices.  In turn, this will boost U.S. productivity and efficiency,

especially within industries that are large users of electricity.

<P>

<b>Industrial Competitiveness</b>

<P>

DOE's role in assisting U.S. economic

competitiveness is described in the 1994 strategic plan, <I>Fueling

a Competitive Economy.  </I>The Superconductivity Program for Electric

Power Systems supports industrial competitiveness and DOE's first

priority, according to the plan-helping the President achieve

his vision of an investment-driven economy capable of creating

high-wage jobs that increase the incomes of the American people.

<P>

The international market for electric products such as generators,

motors, and transmission cables is worth several billion dollars

a year; advanced products employing superconductivity can capture

this market due to improved efficiency and performance.  DOE's

superconductivity program is assisting U.S. industry in exploiting

this market, thereby capturing economic benefits in this country

and energy benefits world-wide.  To achieve this vision, the program

is supporting four consortia of private companies, each committed

to commercializing a different product in the Superconductivity

Partnership Initiative.  In parallel with this product-oriented

thrust, the program assists individual companies through technology

partnerships that are bringing the key manufacturing technology--

making electric wires from high-temperature superconductors--to

maturation.  

<P>

<i>Superconductivity Partnership Initiative</i>

<P>

DOE established

the Superconductivity Partnership Initiative in 1993 to recognize

the progress made by wire-development partners, and to assist

companies committed to developing wire-using products.  A competitive

solicitation was offered that asked respondents to consider a

new approach to bringing technology to the marketplace.  The respondents


were encouraged to form multidisciplinary teams that include the

product user, to engineer applications while the under-pinning

technology is being improved, and to pursue several applications

simultaneously.

<P>

<I>Technology Partnerships</I>

<P>

U.S. companies that have formed technology

partnerships with DOE laboratories since the program started in

1988 have become international leaders in the manufacture of long

lengths of high-temperature superconducting wire.  These partnerships

have built upon two major U.S. strengths: private company 
entrepreneurship

and the resources- people and facilities-of DOE national laboratories.

This combination has given small U.S. companies the ability to

challenge major corporations in Europe and Japan for the lead

in wire manufacture.  These small companies are also key members

of the Superconductivity Partnership Initiative consortia.  In

the first 7 years of the program, 87 agreements were formed for joint 
projects between

companies and national laboratories.  At the end of 1994, 35 were

active.  Industry has shared approximately 40% of these projects'

costs.

<P>

<I>Commercial Products</I>

<P>

With direct program assistance, industry has

already introduced a variety of commercial products.  Two companies,

Seattle Specialty Ceramics and Superconductive Components, Incorporated,


sell high-temperature superconducting powders.  Neocera, Incorporated,

sells a device that deposits multilayer films of high-temperature

superconductors.  American Superconductor Corporation and Intermagnetics


General Corporation sell experimental samples of high-temperature

superconducting wire and coils--components necessary for manufacturing

motors and generators.  And a variety of companies sell electric

power leads made from high-temperature superconductors.  

<P>

By the

end of 1995, industry will design, build, and test prototype electric

power devices, including a 125-horsepower (hp) motor, a 
100-megavolt-ampere

(MVA) generator coil, and a fault-current limiter--a device that

protects an electric utility's transmission and distribution system

from abnormal current pulses.  These devices, if successfully developed

and tested, will lead to large-scale commercial products such

as 1000-hp motors, 100-MVA and larger generators, under-ground

transmission cables, and fault-current limiters, all of which

promise healthy domestic markets and much larger global markets.

<P>

<b>Program Approach</b>

<P>

The underlying requirement for most high-value

commercial applications of high-temperature superconductive electric

power devices is a flexible, mechanically rugged, high-temperature

superconducting wire.  This wire must be capable of carrying a

large current in the presence of a magnetic field and be available

at an acceptable price.  Presently, fabrication technology cannot

provide high-temperature superconducting wire for all the electric

power devices being considered for development.  Prototype device

components need to be designed, developed, and tested for 
commercialization

to occur.  

<P>

In light of these parallel needs, technology and product

development occur concurrently: progress in underlying technology

allows more advanced prototypes to be built and tested.  Feedback

from applications testing allows engineers to make additional

improvements to the underlying technology.  

<P>

Recognizing these R&D

needs, DOE has organized the Superconductivity Program for Electric

Power Systems around two types of activities:

<P>

<UL>

<LI>technology development through R&D with individual companies,

and

<LI>product development by several companies formed into consortia.

</UL>

<P>

Technology development activities focus on two areas: wire development

and electric power applications development.  

<P>

Wire development

activities are devoted to understanding how processing affects

the wire and improving wire fabrication processes.  Work also focuses

on increasing the amount of current, described as the critical

current density (J<sub>c</sub> ), that can flow through a wire.

<P>

Electric power applications development activities focus on making

long-length wire, coils, and other components and improving and

understanding the systems, such as cryogenic refrigerators, that

support high-temperature superconductive devices.  These activities

build upon work in the wire development area and, at the same

time, feed back crucial information.  

<P>

Product development activities,

represented by the Superconductivity Partnership Initiative, focus

on three teams that have been funded to develop high-temperature

superconductive prototypes.  The first team is developing a 
fault-current

limiter; the second team, a 100-MVA generator coil; and the third

team, a 125-hp motor.  Each team is led by a private industry systems

manufacturer.  These manufacturers have agreed to introduce 
high-temperature

super-conductive devices to the marketplace upon the successful

development and testing of prototypes.

<P>

<b>Technology Status</b>

<P>

Materials used to produce high-temperature superconducting

wire are inherently difficult to process into usable forms for

electric power applications.  This situation is the opposite of

that for typical metallic electrical conductors, such as copper.

And this fact presents processing obstacles that must be overcome

to manufacture devices that can actually be used in electric power

system applications.

<P>

<I>Powder-in-Tube Method </I>

<P>

High-temperature superconducting wire considered

for use in electric power applications is currently made by the

powder-in-tube method.  In this method, high-temperature superconducting


pre-cursors are loaded into a tube made of silver and processed

by a variety of standard, low-cost metallurgical manufacturing

techniques such as drawing, rolling, and heat-treating to reach

the final high-temperature superconducting wire form.  To achieve

the desired superconducting state, many variables must be balanced

under manufacturing conditions.  Important processing variables

include heat-treatment temperatures, the duration of heat treatment,

the number of times a wire is rolled, and whether the wire is

heat-treated before or after it is wound into a coil.  

<P>

Optimizing

these variables is difficult and expensive.  Therefore, a large

part of the program to date has been devoted to fabricating short

high-temperature superconducting wires with exceptional current

carrying capabilities.  As optimal processing conditions evolve

for short-length wire, the manufacture of long-length wire can

be improved by transferring short wire processing knowledge to

long wire processing.  This transfer of knowledge is central to

many of the collaborative agreements between the national laboratories

and private industry.  In this case, the national laboratories

work on improving short-length wire, then transfer their results

to industry where improvements can be made to their long-length,

commercial wire making processes.  

<P>

The program continually monitors

wire development progress, assessing wire characteristics to ensure

that future wire will possess the properties necessary for use

in electric power devices.  Critical current density, J<sub>c</sub> , 
the

current per cross-sectional area of the superconductor "core";

is the common electrical parameter used to rate the performance

of high-temperature superconducting wire.  Most electric power

applications require J<sub>c</sub> in the range of 10<sup>4</sup> to 
10<sup>6</sup> amperes per

square centimeter (A/cm<sup>2</sup>)at operating conditions.  Commercial


Bi-2223 (see the table for compound descriptions) powder-in-tube

wire manufactured today that is longer than 20 meters can carry

up to 20,000 A/cm<sup>2</sup> at 77 K and in no magnetic field.

<P>

In general,

the smaller the magnetic field in which a high-temperature 
superconducting

wire must function, the more current the wire can carry.  However,

most electric power applications require magnetic fields of 2

to 5 tesla (T) when operating efficiently.  At 2 to 5 T, Bi-2223

powder-in-tube wires must be used at temperatures below 35 K,

because of limitations in the superconducting properties of Bi-2223.

Below 35 K and in fields up to 2 T, Bi-2223 powder-in-tube wires

have a J<sub>c</sub> that is useful for prototype electric power 
devices.

Additional improvements in J<sub>c</sub> need to be made for commercial 
Bi-2223

powder-in-tube wire to be used in large-scale commercial devices

such as motors and generators.  

<P>

Another compound, Tl-1223, 

possesses the necessary properties for wire designed

to be used in 2- to 5-T fields above 35 K.  The development of

wires made from Tl-1223 is a few years behind the development

of Bi-2223 wires, and today the best performing short Tl-1223

powder-in-tube wires have a J<sub>c</sub> of 15,000 A/cm<sup>2</sup> at 
77 K and 0

T.  Because Tl-1223 is more difficult to process in powder-in-tube

wires than Bi-2223, the national laboratories are exploring alternative

approaches to Tl-1223 wire manufacture.  Low-cost, commercial wire

manufacturing processes such as electrodeposition and coextrusion

show promise, but still need significant development before they

are practical for production of high-temperature superconducting

wire.

<P>

<I>Cost</I>

<P>

Of course, much work remains to be done, particularly on

reducing cost.  Regardless of performance gains, high-temperature

superconducting wires will not become commercially competitive

until the cost of wire is reduced.  Currently, the cost of 
high-temperature

superconducting wire, in dollars per kiloamperemeter, is predominantly

driven by high manufacturing costs and high material costs.  Private

industry, with program assistance, will continue to explore novel

methods to reduce manufacturing expenses and lower the material

costs of wire.  Some of these techniques are discussed later in

more detail.  For the successful development of applications using

high-temperature superconducting wire, the cost of the wire along

with total equipment costs and performance needs to be competitive

with existing technologies.

<P>

<I>Coordination</I>

<P>

Key to the development of commercial high-temperature

superconducting products is the search for better superconducting

materials.  To leverage government activities, the Superconductivity

Program for Electric Power Systems coordinates with DOE's Basic

Energy Sciences group, which explores basic materials, mechanisms,

and physical phenomena; and searches for new compounds with higher

critical temperatures and better mechanical properties.  These

discoveries are then carried over to the Superconductivity Program

for Electric Power Systems for improvements in wire and applications

development.

<P>

<I>Conclusion</I>

<P>

At present, short wires possess excellent properties,

but the real need for applications is long-length wire--00 to

1000 meters or longer.  Private industry can now manufacture 100-

to 1000-meter wires on a small scale, but the need is for the

repeated manufacture of uniform, long-length wire that is stable,

flexible, multifilamentary, capable of carrying large currents

in magnetic fields, and cost competitive.  

<P>

To address this need,

technology development is proceeding on two fronts: raising current

density in short-length wire and transferring process and material

improvements to long wire lengths, and increasing critical current

and wire length in commercial manufacturing processes in which

uniformity is the key.  Progress in both areas is necessary so

that high-temperature super-conducting wires will soon be used

in place of conventional wires in electric power devices.

<P>

<H3>Accomplishments</H3>

<P>

<b>Technology Development</b>
<P>
<I>Wire Improvement</I>

<P>

To ensure continuous improvements to high-temperature

superconducting wire, R&D needs to continue on the first step

of wire manufacture--the synthesis of high-temperature superconducting

powders that yield optimum electrical and physical properties

after the wire is processed.  In addition, researchers need to

increase their understanding of the relationships between powder

properties before wire manufacture and the final electrical and

physical properties of the wire.  Any improvements must be amenable

to cost-effective manufacturing.  Knowledge in this area is increased

by exploring novel approaches to the synthesis of high-temperature

superconducting powders and characterizing the properties of the

powders.

<P>

<I>Materials Synthesis and Properties</I>

<P>

For example, in 1993,

Argonne National Laboratory developed a novel, two-powder process

for synthesizing Bi-2223.  This new process allows more precise

control of the final powder makeup, which directly influences

the current-carrying properties of the resulting wire.  Critical

current densities in short lengths of the wire made from these

powders have been measured up to 50,000 A/cm<sup>2</sup> at 77 K and 0 
T.

This process incorporates a novel synthesis route, vacuum calcination,

for which Argonne received a 1993 R&D 100 Award.  In future

projects, researchers will apply this technique to industrial

wire development processes to enhance the properties of long-length

wire.  

<P>

Oak Ridge National Laboratory also contributed to the progress

of the program's powder processing activities by licensing an

aerosol spray manufacturing technique to Superconductive Components,

Incorporated.  This process produces powders with well controlled

properties.  It results in a narrow distribution of particle sizes,

fine grain size within individual particles, and excellent chemical

homogeneity.  Superconductive Components is now selling these powders

produced at their facility using the process developed by Oak

Ridge.  

<P>

In 1994, researchers also made significant progress in

developing powder for other compounds, especially Tl-1223.  Tl-1223

is more difficult to process than Bi-2223 in the powder-in-tube

wire process.  The control of Tl-1223 powder characteristics is

crucial for producing wire with the properties necessary for use

in electric power applications.  

<P>

Los Alamos National Laboratory

and Sandia National Laboratories made advances in the control

of Tl-1223 powder characteristics leading to Tl-1223 powder-in-tube

wires with a J<sub>c</sub> approaching 15,000 A/cm<sup>2</sup>.  The 
National Renewable

Energy Laboratory, in collaboration with the State University

of New York at Buffalo, fabricated Tl-1223 powder-in-tube wire

with a J<sub>c</sub> near 10,000 A/cm<sup>2</sup> using 
"electrodeposited";

precursor powders.

<P>

<I>Critical Currents and Microstructures</I>

<P>

One crucial limiting

factor for eventual applications of high-temperature superconducting

wire is the amount of current the wire can carry.  Current in 
high-temperature

superconductors is influenced by many factors:

<P>

<UL>

<LI>operating temperature,

<LI>operating field, and

<LI>superconductor microstructure.

</UL>

<P>

Operating temperature and field are external factors--they can

be controlled independently of the high-temperature superconducting

wire--and are directly related to the amount of current a given

wire can carry.  In general, the lower the operating temperature,

the more current a wire can carry.  Operating fields have a similar

effect.  The smaller the field, the more current a wire can carry.

Unfortunately, many electric power applications must operate in

high fields--up to 5 T.  In addition, the applications will run

more cost effectively at higher temperatures, which require less

cooling, less insulation, and lower cost cryogen.  So, for commercial

devices to be cost effective, wire designed for electric power

applications must be able to operate in high fields at temperatures

that are at least 20 K or more.  

<P>

The superconductor microstructure

is an internal factor and is heavily influenced by the materials

used to make the wire, the processing techniques, and the final

wire form.  The microstructure also offers great potential for

improvement.  Critical current densities in wires are still 10

to 100 times less than in oriented thin films made from high-temperature


superconductors.  Thin films are generally used for electronics

applications and possess the best high-temperature superconductor

properties known.  The properties that thin films possess are targets

for wire developers.  The challenge for researchers is to figure

out how current flows through superconducting wires and how to

maximize the current that can be produced in a wire by a given

process.  

<P>

In 1993, a breakthrough in the understanding of the superconductor

microstructure of Tl-1223 was made when researchers at Oak Ridge

National Laboratory and General Electric Company identified a

possible microstructural origin of high critical current densities

in Tl-1223 thick film deposits produced by General Electric Company.

These films possess the best current carrying 
capabilities--J<sub>c</sub>

up to 325,000 A/cm<sup>2</sup> at 77 K and 0 T--of any non-thin film 
type

manufacturing process.  This discovery is extremely important for

the development of Tl-1223 long-length wires because researchers

now have insight on why these thick films carry more current than

high-temperature superconductors produced by other processes,

including powder-in-tube wire.  No other potentially low cost 
manufacturing

method is known that produces such high critical currents.  The

challenge for researchers now is to translate the laboratory process

to a cost-effective, large-scale manufacturing process that can

produce wires with these excellent properties.  

<P>

<I>Fabrication Process</I>

<P>

In conjunction with

understanding the microstructure of superconducting wire, fabrication

processes that can produce the desired microstructure need to

be further developed and refined.  Various manufacturing techniques

exist to produce wire, and the powder-in-tube approach is the

one most commonly used.  But this process has limitations.  So,

while incremental improvements to the powder-in-tube method are

being made, new techniques need to be explored.

<P>

<I>Techniques to Increase Wire Strength and Flexibility</I>.  All

practical methods for manufacturing high-temperature super-conducting

wire use silver as a sheath material.  Silver is used because it

is compatible with the superconducting ceramics, it is highly

ductile, it is permeable to oxygen, and it can conduct electricity.

Silver may even play a role in aligning the grains of Bi-2223

during formation processes.  

<P>

Unfortunately, silver is expensive

and mechanically weak.  The expense of silver is not in itself

enough to prohibit its use as a sheath material in cost-effective

wires, but because it has low strength, engineers must use large

amounts of it during wire processing to protect the ceramic core.

The large amount of silver needed can quickly become a cost issue.

In addition, the thick sheath limits the amount of superconducting

powder in the wire.  Specifically, in commercially manufactured

samples, only 25% of the total powder-in-tube wire is powder.

This limits the total current that wire can carry.

<P>

Despite these limitations, there are many opportunities for improvement.


In 1994, the program supported research that could lead to new

and improved sheath materials.  One technique investigated is dispersion


strengthening of the silver sheath.  This could lead to a stronger

sheath material with the same beneficial characteristics as pure

silver.  Increased strength would allow engineers to make wires

with thinner sheaths, directly increasing the overall current

density, Joverall , without making improvements to the microstructure

of the superconducting core.  Thinner sheaths could also lead to

lower costs because they require smaller amounts of silver.  

<P>

Another

approach being investigated is the development of new, high-strength,

low-cost silver alloys that are compatible with the superconducting

core.  These alloys will not directly lower the materials' cost

of high-temperature superconducting wire because silver is still

used in large quantities, but the alloys will allow more efficient,

lower cost manufacturing of wire with superior strength properties

compared to wires with pure silver sheaths.

<P>

<I>Wire Forming Techniques</I>.  While supporting incremental 
improvements

in the powder-in-tube method through improvements in processing,

the program also supported research in other wire forming techniques.

These techniques have their own drawbacks, yet they offer solutions

to difficult problems that are present in powder-in-tube processing.

<P>

In 1994, advances in Tl-1223 processing were made at the National

Renewable Energy Laboratory.  Researchers were able to produce

electrodeposited, thick-film deposits of Tl-1223 on silver foil

that yielded critical current densities of 32,000 A/cm<sup>2</sup>2 at 
77

K and 0 T.  This is significant because electrodeposition processing

offers a viable alternative to powder-in-tube processing.  

<P>

In another

project, researchers at Sandia and Los Alamos National Laboratories,

in collaboration with Nuclear Metals Corporation and AT&T,

investigated a wire manufacturing method called "hydrostatic

extrusion."  This technique is amenable to large-scale manufacturing

and could drastically reduce the amount of silver needed in the

wire sheath compared to the powder-in-tube wire.  The technique

is promising, but much work is still needed to prove its final

usefulness.

<P>

<I>Wire Characterization</I>.Increased understanding of the makeup

of the superconducting Bi-2223 core is crucial to progress in

raising critical current densities.  Recently, researchers at 
Brookhaven

National Laboratory showed that the primary limiting factor for

critical current density in Bi-2223 powder-in-tube wire is the

presence of a large fraction of poor and non-superconducting grain

boundaries compared to "clean" or superconducting grain

boundaries.  

<P>

Understanding the relationship between fabrication

processes and the final wire is often just as important as finding

a viable solution.  From here, researchers can investigate processing

methods that can lead to improved grain boundaries.

<P>

<b>Electric Power Applications </b>

<P>

Research in high-temperature super-conductive

electric power applications supports U.S. industry's effort to

produce components such as long-length, high-current, high-temperature

superconducting wire, and coils and cables made from high-temperature

superconducting wire, and systems such as motors and generators

that use high-temperature superconducting components.  In 1994,

significant progress was made in all these areas.

<P>

<I>Component Development </I>

<P>

Component development is advancing

the state of the art in the following areas:

<P>

<UL>

<LI>long-length, high-current, high-temperature superconducting

wire manufacture,

<LI>coil development,

<LI>cable development, and

<LI>coil and cable testing.

</UL>

<P>

Components must have excellent current and magnetic field performance

to be incorporated into electric power devices.  Presently, component

performance is not at the level needed for full-scale commercial

devices.  In addition, the cost of long-length, high-temperature

superconducting wire needs to be reduced by 10 to 100 times to

be competitive with other technologies.  Program activities in

component development include lowering the cost of wire while

simultaneously improving electrical properties.

<P>

<I>Long-Length Wire</I>.  The most significant need in the program

is for cost-effective, long-length, high-temperature superconducting

wire that is suitable for electric power applications.  The program

supports collaborative work designed to transfer the manufacturing

processes developed for high-temperature superconducting wire

from the national laboratories to private industry.  Without significant


improvements in manufacturing technology, long lengths of wire

with the necessary properties will not be developed.  

<P>

During 1994,

the program helped shape many important accomplishments in this

area.  American Superconductor Corporation, in collaboration with

Argonne, Los Alamos, and Oak Ridge National Laboratories and the

University of Wisconsin, manufactured 1160 meters of 
Bi-2223/silver-sheathed

wire with a J<sub>c</sub> of 12,700 A/cm<sup>2</sup> at 77 K and 0 T.  
The company also

manufactured 100-meter lengths of wire with a J<sub>c</sub> of 21,300 
A/cm<sup>2</sup> 

at 77 K and 0 T.  In addition, Intermagnetics General Corporation,

with assistance from Argonne National Laboratory, manufactured

850-meter Bi-2223/silver wire with a J<sub>c</sub> of 10,500 
A/cm<sup>2</sup> at 77

K and 0 T.

<P>

<I>Coils</I>.  Coils that generate and toler-ate 2- to 5-T magnetic

fields are necessary components for commercial electric power

systems such as motors, generators, and certain types of energy

storage devices.  Coils made from super-conducting wire that maintain

current performance under high magnetic fields need to be designed,

built, and tested.  Research in the program supports the design

and testing of such coils and investigates such important issues

as coil-winding techniques, joining of wire, coil support, and

coil performance under the sudden loss of superconductivity--also

called quenching.  

<P>

World-record progress in coil development was

made in 1994.  Intermagnetics General Corporation developed a 
high-performance

coil that generated 2.6 T at 4.2 K, 1.8 T at 27 K, and 0.3 T at

77 K.  The coil was built with assistance from collaborators at

Argonne and Oak Ridge National Laboratories.  This is the first

coil that can operate successfully under these field strengths.

The properties of this coil are closely approaching the values
necessary for electric power applications. 

<P>

<I>Cables</I>.  High-temperature

superconducting wire is available today to manufacture underground

transmission cable prototypes.  However, the wire cost must be

reduced and the system performance verified before the cables

will be attractive in the marketplace.

<P>

<I>Systems Development </I>

<P>

Systems development research focuses

on designing and testing prototype electric power applications,

such as motors, that use high-temperature superconductivity.  These

systems usually consist of components made from high-temperature

superconducting wire, with other supporting hardware such as cryogenics,


a support stand, and a utility interface.  

<P>

In 1993, Reliance Electric

Company, a program collaborator, announced that a motor built

with high-temperature superconducting coils generated 5 hp-- the

highest achieved in the world to date.  This project is supported

by EPRI, and the wire and coils were developed in part through

R&D conducted by the national laboratories and American Superconductor

Corporation.  In coming years, Reliance Electric will develop a

125-hp motor prototype under the Superconductivity Partnership

Initiative using the 5-hp motor as a model.

<P>

<b>Product Development</b>

<P>

<I>Superconductivity Partnership Initiative </I>

<P>

DOE awarded three Superconductivity

Partnership Initiative projects in 1993 based on a competitive

solicitation.  DOE provides financial assistance to the participating

companies that formed partnerships with a systems integrator,

a component manufacturer, and an end user.  Each project began

in early 1994.  A fourth award will be made in early 1995 for a

transmission cable project.  Descriptions of each one follow.  

<P>

<I>Project 1: </I>Fault-Current Limiter.  Team members, led by 
researchers

at Martin Marietta Corporation, will design, build, and test a

prototype current limiter with a high-temperature superconducting

coil by the end of fiscal year (FY) 1995.  The current limiter

is designed to protect electric utility transmission and distribution

systems from abnormal power surges due to uncontrollable forces

such as lightning strikes and storms.  

<P>

<I>Project 2: </I>125-hp

Motor.  By the end of FY 1995, team members, led by Reliance Electric

Company, will design, build, and test a 125-hp prototype motor

that uses a rotor made from high-temperature superconducting wire.

The motor will be smaller and more efficient than conventional

iron-core induction motors.  If the prototype is successful, motors

larger than 1000 hp using the same technology will be commercialized.

<P>

<I>Project 3: </I>100-MVA Generator Coil.  By the end of FY 1995, team 
members,

led by General Electric Company, will design, build, and test

a prototype 100-MVA generator rotor coil manufactured with 
high-temperature

superconducting wire.  They will also design the complete generator

and model its inter-actions with a utility grid.  If the prototype

is successful, a full-scale generator containing a high-temperature

super-conducting coil will be developed and commercialized.  
Superconducting

generators may increase machine efficiency beyond 99%, producing

energy savings, reduced pollution, and lower life-cycle costs

than conventional generators.  

<P>

<I>Project 4: </I>115-kilovolt (kV),

30-meter Transmission Cable.  The team, led by Pirelli Cable Corporation


and overseen by EPRI's Underground Transmission Task Force, will

manufacture and test, by conventional industry accepted techniques,

a 30-meter prototype 115-kV high-temperature super-conducting

power cable by 1997.  In addition, the team will design a three-phase,

100-meter cable system that can be used in commercial projects.

<P>

The transmission cable will be able to carry more than two times

the current of conventional power cables, and will allow increased

capacity in areas where new rights-of-way are restricted.

<P>

<H3>Program Management</H3>

<P>

Federal R&D priorities in high-temperature superconductivity

are established in response to private-sector needs.  Field work

conducted by the national laboratories to meet these needs is

approved by the DOE program manager.  

<P>

Industrial involvement and

cost sharing are prerequisites for R&D projects undertaken

by DOE.  Collaborations between national laboratories and industry

are approved by the DOE Operations Office that is associated with

the collaborating laboratory.  Competitive solicitations for cost-shared


projects require definitive descriptions of the work proposed,

costs, schedules, and plans for commercialization.  Projects under

the Superconductivity Partnership Initiative are managed directly

by DOE's field office in Golden, Colorado.  Technical support for

the Initiative is provided by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory

in consultation with the DOE program manager.  The DOE program

manager critically reviews progress and plans for the future,

adjusting the scope and funding of projects as necessary.

<P>

<I>Program Evaluation</I>

<P>

To help guide the DOE program manager in making

planning decisions, an annual peer review is held near the end

of each fiscal year in Washington, D.C.  At the review, national

laboratories present their latest results, research planned for

the upcoming fiscal year, and technology transfer efforts.  The

projects are rated by a panel of experts in superconductivity

who are chosen from industry, academia, and federal agencies.

Each reviewer provides a critical analysis of the individual 
presentations

and the overall program.  The program manager uses this feedback

to support continuing efforts or make changes when necessary.

<P>

Recently, private industry projects were included in the review

process.  Industrial representatives delivered presentations that

covered the collaborative efforts they were involved with in the

program.  Industry's involvement in the peer review process is

designed to foster additional openness and cooperation between

industry and DOE, and it will be expanded in the future.

<P>

<H3>Outcome</H3>

<P>

Electricity accounts for 36% of the total energy used in the United

States.  Electricity is our principal and most flexible means of

integrating coal, hydropower, nuclear, and most renew-able resources

into a usable energy system.  Historically, the demand for electricity

depends on the nation's economic growth rate, as well as the

adoption rate of efficient technologies and conservation measures.

In the next 20 years, consumer demand for electricity will increase

by 50%, and electricity use will increase to 40% of the total

energy consumed by the country.<a href="overview.htm#note 1">1</a>

<P>

The electric utility industry faces several challenges in meeting

these steadily increasing consumer demands.  The siting of new

power plants is more difficult now, and stringent environmental

regulations such as the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 must

be met.  Transmission corridors are reaching capacity, and new

rights-of-way are rarely approved by regulators as opposition

groups cite severe environmental impacts of such approvals.  Since

1991, the electric utility industry has spent about $2 billion

annually on demand-side management programs designed to modify

load growth.<a href="overview.htm#note 2">2</a>  In addition, utilities 
must meet increasing demands

for large quantities of electricity with high power quality, driven

in part by the increasing use of electronic equipment.  

<P>

The U.S.

electric utility market can be divided into four functional areas:

generation, transmission, distribution, and customer service.

Generation is the process through which primary energy sources

are converted into electricity.  Transmission and distribution

make up the electric delivery system.  Customer service focuses

on power quality, reliability, and load management on the customer

side of the meter.  

<P>

High-temperature superconducting electric power

designed to fost
technologies will have a broad impact on all four 
functional electric

utility areas and will help the utility industry meet each of

the challenges described above.  Superconducting generators will

be more efficient and up to 50% smaller than conventional generators,

and can help lessen the need for new power plants and reduce the

amount of emissions by reducing the amount of fossil fuel used.

Superconducting transmission cables can carry up to twice the

current of conventional transmission lines, allowing utilities

to double their transmission capacity while taking up the same

amount of space.  Superconducting motors will be more efficient

and smaller than conventional motors, lowering the amount of energy

needed from generation and transmission sources while accomplishing

the same work.  Superconducting current limiters will allow utilities

to more efficiently utilize their existing trainsmission and 
distribution

network increasing its reliability and capability to carry power.

Other high-temperature superconductor applications not yet implemented,

such as magnetic energy storage, may also contribute to the efficiency

and reliability of the electric utility system.  

<P>

In addition to

bolstering energy efficiency and providing stability to an ever-changing


utility system, the Superconductivity Program for Electric Power

Systems is performing another great service.  It is investing in

R&D that is leading to products the United States can sell

on the world market.  This, in turn, will provide new jobs at home;

at the same time, it will provide a new avenue on which the United

States can enter the high-tech, global marketplace.
