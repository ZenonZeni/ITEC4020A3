Biofuels</title></head><body>
<h1>Renewable Energy: Biomass and Biofuels</h1><p>
<p>
The nation's transportation sector is 97% dependent on petroleum and 
consumes
63% of all oil used in the United States.  Foreign oil contributes nearly 
half
(49.3%) of all oil used--and the use of imported oil is growing.  Biomass 
is
organic material that can be converted into enough transportation fuels, 
called
biofuels, to displace significant amounts of the imported oil without
encroaching on food and forestry crops.<p>
<p>
<h2>Resource</h2>
Nonfood agricultural energy crops and more than half of the nation's 
household,
industrial, agricultural, and forestry wastes could produce enough 
ethanol to
supply most of the nation's current gasoline consumption.<p>

Microscopic aquatic plants called microalgae could produce enough 
biodiesel to
satisfy the entire U.S. diesel market.<p>

Electricity produced from biomass has grown from 200 megawatts (MW) in 
the
early 1980s to more than 8000 MW today, representing a 4000% increase.<p>

<p>
<h2>Advantages</h2>
<b><i>Reduce imported oil consumption</i></b>:  By 2000, 500 million 
gallons of
ethanol made from biomass will displace 13 million barrels of oil; by 
2020, 14
billion gallons of ethanol will displace 348 million barrels of oil.<p>

<b><i>Create U.S. jobs</i></b>:  The biomass-to-ethanol industry will 
create
more than 2800 new jobs by 2000 and more than 100,000 jobs by 2020.<p>

<b><i>Reduce global climate change</i></b>:  Ethanol made from biomass
generates 90% less carbon dioxide (the leading cause of global warming) 
and 70%
less sulfur dioxide (the leading agent responsible for acid rain) than 
does
reformulated gasoline.<p>

<b><i>Ease of use</i></b>:  Mixing 20% biodiesel with 80% diesel will 
enable
U.S. diesel-fueled fleet operators to comply with stricter emissions
regulations with no major modifications to existing equipment.<p>
<p>
<h2>Current Use and Cost</h2>
Ethanol currently supplies nearly 1% of the nation's transportation fuel 
needs;
production is based in the Midwest; about 400 million bushels of corn is
converted to more than 1 billion gallons of ethanol annually.<p>

<b><i>Current conversion costs</i></b>:  Biomass can be converted to 
ethanol
for less than $1.00/gallon--down from $3.42/gallon in 1980; biomass can 
be
converted to methanol for $0.84/gallon; soybeans can be converted to 
biodiesel
for $2.50/gallon.<p>
<p>
<h2>Projected Use and Cost</h2>
Department of Energy goals:<p>

<b><i>Conversion costs</i></b>:  Biomass to ethanol for $0.67/gallon by 
2000;
biomass to methanol for $0.55/gallon; microalgae to biodiesel for 
$1.00/gallon
by 2015.<p>

10% of cars on U.S. highways will use alternative fuels by 2000; 25% by 
2010.<p>
<p>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
Renewable fuels are a key to achieving sustainable development in the 
United
States; the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE's) biofuels programs will
stimulate investment in the nation's agricultural, fuel production, and
automobile manufacturing industries.<p>

More than 36 million acres enrolled in the Conservation Reserve Program 
(CRP)
since 1986 could produce energy crops while improving the quality of the
cropland, which is the purpose of the CRP.<p>

Energy crops, such as switchgrass, poplars, and willows, will soon be 
grown by
many of America's farmers to provide fuel for high-efficiency biomass 
power
plants.  These biomass plants will contribute to the battle against 
global
warming by reducing greenhouse gas emissions significantly compared to
conventional power production.<p>
<p>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<b><i>Costs</i></b>:  Enable biofuels to be cost-competitive with 
gasoline when
oil is $25/barrel.<p>

<b><i>Developing a fuel industry infrastructure</i></b>:  Farmers want 
markets
before they plant energy crops; fuel producers want guarantees of stable
supplies before they build a new infrastructure.<p>
<p>
<h2>New Technologies</h2>
Technologies that enable producers to extract and ferment sugar from 
nonstarch
materials are being developed now; this would allow use of nonfood crops 
and
other biomass resources.<p>

Technologies that can convert oils found in microalgae to biodiesel are 
being
developed now.<p>

Also under development are new gasifier designs and other thermochemical
advances that enable methanol and biocrude, a crude oil replacement, to 
be made
from biomass.<p>
