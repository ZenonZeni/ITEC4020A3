<P><HR>
<H3> <A NAME="A2"> <B> 1.1 OBJECTIVE </B> </A> </H3>
<P>
 The objective of this procurement is to contract with private industry for the provision of waste
acceptance, transportation, and delivery services, and storage equipment for commercial spent
nuclear fuel. Provision of these services and equipment will enable the Office of Civilian
Radioactive Waste Management (OCRWM) of the Department of Energy (DOE) to meet its
obligations as defined in the Nuclear Waste Policy Act as amended. For purposes of this
solicitation the continental United States has been divided into four regions as shown on Figure
1.1; more detailed figures of the regions are provided in Appendix A. Each contractor (hereafter
called a &quot;Regional Servicing Agent&quot;) shall be responsible for all activities and
services in its region, including the provision of transportation and storage casks, canisters,
storage modules, and ancillary equipment, as required to accept the spent nuclear fuel and
transport it from the Purchaser
<A NAME="FOOTBODY_1"></A>
<SUP><A HREF="#FOOTNOTE_1">1</A></SUP>
 Sites to a designated Federal Facility for storage or disposal. 
<P>
 A secondary objective of this procurement is to establish a source of supply for on-site storage
systems to be delivered to selected Purchasers at OCRWM's option. 
<P>
<H3> <A NAME="A3"> <B> 1.2 PROGRAM SUMMARY </B> </A> </H3>
<P>
 OCRWM is responsible for implementing the provisions of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act as
amended (NWPA). The NWPA requires, among other things, that the Department provide for
waste acceptance, transportation, and disposal of spent nuclear fuel (SNF) or high-level
radioactive waste from Purchasers who have entered into Purchaser disposal contract(s)
<A NAME="FOOTBODY_2"></A>
<SUP><A HREF="#FOOTNOTE_2">2</A></SUP>
 with the Secretary of Energy for such services. 
<P>
 Consistent with the NWPA, the Department plans to &quot;. . . utilize . . . private industry to the
fullest extent possible . . .&quot; for the performance of transportation activities as authorized by
Congress. To this extent, OCRWM is pursuing an acquisition process that is market driven, that
is, OCRWM will rely on private industry to provide all of the necessary services and hardware
items required to fulfill OCRWM's waste acceptance and transportation mission at competitive
prices. The intent is to develop a market infrastructure to foster competition and innovative
approaches to waste acceptance and transportation services and to produce results at a best value
for the Civilian Radioactive Waste Management Program.

<H3> <A NAME="A4"> <B> 1.3 WORK SCOPE SUMMARY </B> </A> </H3>
<P>
 OCRWM's waste acceptance and transportation operations will be divided into four regions
(Figure 1.1). A successful Offeror will be awarded a contract and shall become the Regional
Servicing Agent (RSA) for a designated region and be responsible for performing all planning,
preparations, waste acceptance, transportation and delivery of Purchaser SNF from that region to
a Federal Facility at the rates and from the locations specified in the Regional Waste Acceptance
Schedule (RWAS) (Appendix B) for that region. The related work scope for the contract has
been phased to facilitate contract definition and performance. The phases are: Phase A -
Development of Servicing Plans; Phase B - Acquisition of Hardware Items and Mobilization;
and Phase C - SNF Acceptance and Transport. Refer to Section 4.0 for detailed requirements. 
<P>
<H3> <A NAME="A5"> <B> 1.4 REGIONAL SERVICING AGENT CONCEPT OF
OPERATIONS </B> </A> </H3>
<P>
 The Concept of Operations which follows summarizes the major operational activities to be
performed by the RSA. The description begins with preparation for waste acceptance and
continues through delivery of SNF to a Federal Facility. Although the RSA is responsible for
providing all necessary hardware items, acquisition of hardware items is not included in the
following description of the Concept of Operations. 
<P>
<H3> <A NAME="A6"> <B> 1.4.1 Activities at Purchasers' Sites </B> </A> </H3>
<P>
<DL>
<DD>
 The RSA shall provide Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) approved transportation systems
suitable for use at Purchasers' facilities for loading of SNF for shipment to the Federal Facility.
Transportation systems could include dual-purpose (transport/storage) or multi-purpose
(transport/storage/disposal) casks and canister-based transport/storage systems (both hereafter
referred to as &quot;dual-purpose systems&quot;) and transport-only casks for uncanistered
SNF. The dual purpose system or transport cask that the RSA proposes to use at a Purchaser's
site must be compatible with the Purchaser facility capabilities for handling and loading SNF. It
is expected that the Federal Facility will accept only canistered SNF during the first several years
of operation. Thereafter, either canistered SNF or uncanistered SNF will be accepted provided
the Federal Facility has the capability to handle the transport cask systems. 
<P>
<DD>
 The RSA shall ensure that all SNF designated for loading is in compliance with the requirements
contained in the SNF Verification Plan (Appendix C). All necessary ancillary cask-handling
equipment shall be provided to the Purchaser's site by the RSA. While at the Purchaser's facility,
the Purchaser will be responsible for incidental maintenance, protection, and preservation of all
equipment furnished to the Purchaser by the RSA for the loading and shipment of SNF.
Appropriate documentation shall be provided by the RSA to the Purchasers to demonstrate
equipment compliance with NRC regulations. The RSA shall provide cask-handling training to
personnel at sites to be serviced. The casks will be loaded and prepared for off-site shipment by
the Purchasers under the Purchaser's Quality Assurance (QA) Program and the requirements of
the NRC Certificate of Compliance. 
<p>
<DD>
 The RSA shall conduct, or be responsible for, all shipping arrangements, including the provision
of appropriate transport carrier services, on-site/near-site intermodal transfer services, advance
notifications, in-transit physical protection/escort services, and payment of State-imposed tolls,
fees and permits. The RSA shall determine the transportation routes in accordance with the
regulatory requirements of the Department of Transportation and provide descriptions of these
routes to the NRC for approval. The RSA shall provide OCRWM information copies of all
transportation route descriptions prior to their submission to the NRC. Also, the RSA shall
interact with State and Tribal governments as necessary to support selection of the shipping
routes. The RSA shall accept title to the SNF on behalf of OCRWM and be the Shipping Agent
for OCRWM. 
<P>
</DL>
<H3> <A NAME="A7"> <B> 1.4.2 Activities During Transport </B> </A> </H3>
<P>
<DL>
<DD>
 The RSA shall provide for: in-transit physical protection; continuous tracking of each in-transit
shipment; capability to communicate with escorts accompanying in-transit shipments and carriers
while the SNF is in transit, and any required en route intermodal transfer services. The RSA shall
be responsible for payment of all costs related to correcting any non-compliance deficiencies and
any transportation non-compliance costs, including any Federal, State, and Tribal fines or
penalties. 
<P>
<DD>
 The RSA shall provide notifications to NRC, OCRWM, the Purchaser, and State and Tribal
governments in the event of an emergency. Emergency response will be provided by local units
of government, States, Tribes, or by appropriate Federal agencies, such as the Federal Emergency
Management Agency, if requested by the State or Tribal governments. The RSA may be
requested to provide assistance to the officials in charge at the scene of an incident, emergency or
accident related to its SNF shipments. In addition, the RSA will coordinate, if applicable, with
the RSA in whose region the emergency occurred. 
<P>
<DD>
 For this acquisition, the RSA shall provide heavy-haul capability from a railhead to the Federal
Facility should the Facility not be serviced by a railroad. The RSA shall interface with the
Federal Facility Operator to ensure that shipments are coordinated with other shipments from
other regions. Delay or postponement of shipments shall be communicated to NRC, OCRWM,
Federal Facility Operator, States and Tribal governments.

<H3> <A NAME="A8"> <B> 1.4.3 Activities at Designated Federal Facility </B> </A> </H3>
<P>
<DL>
<DD>
 The RSA shall be responsible for providing the Operator of the Federal Facility with the
appropriate storage systems for the SNF being delivered. Depending on storage needs, this will
necessitate the provision of either storage modules for canistered SNF or single-purpose canisters
and storage modules for uncanistered SNF. All equipment required to handle a transportation
cask or a canister including, but not limited to the equipment required to remove impact limiters
from a transportation cask, remove a transportation cask from its transporter and rotate it to a
vertical position, remove the lid from a transportation cask, remove a dual-purpose canister from
a transportation cask, install a dual-purpose canister into a storage module, and move the storage
module to its storage location shall be provided to the Federal Facility Operator by the RSA. Any
equipment required to reverse any of the above actions shall also be provided to the Federal
Facility Operator by the RSA if such equipment is not the same as the equipment required for the
original action. However, any utilities, services, cranes, and standard tools readily available from
commercial sources shall be furnished by the Federal Facility Operator. 
<P>
<DD>
 The RSA shall be responsible for taking appropriate action to correct non-compliance with NRC
regulations for any shipment. 
<P>
<DD>
 While the RSA's transportation cask system equipment is physically located at the Federal
Facility, the Federal Facility Operator is responsible for protecting and preserving the equipment
to include performing all incidental maintenance required to maintain the equipment in a
condition suitable for shipment off-site. Routine transportation cask and transportation
equipment maintenance, such as periodic transportation cask maintenance, repairs and scheduled
overhauls, are the responsibility of the RSA. The RSA is responsible for providing all required
spare parts, such as seals, bolts, threaded inserts, etc; to the Federal Facility Operator to support
the incidental maintenance of the RSA's equipment while it is at the Federal Facility. 
<P>
<DD>
 Along with those dual-purpose system components that the RSA delivers to the Federal Facility
Operator and that DOE takes title to, the RSA shall provide an initial 180-day supply of repair
parts to the Federal Facility Operator to support maintenance and minor repairs to these
components. The RSA shall provide all documentation necessary for the Federal Facility
Operator to establish sources of supply for such repair parts . 
<P>
</DL>
<H3> <A NAME="A9"> <B> 1.4.4 Activities at Regional Servicing Agent Site </B> </A>

<DD>
 The RSA shall perform needed planning activities; shall coordinate as required with OCRWM,
the Federal Facility Operator, the Purchasers, and other RSAs; and shall arrange for all required
services and delivery of all required hardware items to the Purchasers and the Federal Facility
Operator. The RSA shall conduct training of RSA's staff and provide QA support for RSA's
activities and OCRWM QA audit and surveillance activities. 
<P>
<DD>
 The RSA shall be responsible for all cask maintenance, repairs, cleaning, and cask
reconfigurations. Such activities shall be conducted at RSA identified facility(ies) as required to
support RSA's operations. The RSA shall also be responsible for disposal of any waste generated
during such maintenance. 
<P>
</DL>
<H3> <A NAME="A10"> <B> 1.5 QUALITY ASSURANCE REQUIREMENTS </B> </A>
</H3>
<P>
 OCRWM nuclear activities are subject to NRC regulations for Quality Assurance. These QA
regulations and related controls have been implemented throughout OCRWM in the Quality
Assurance Requirements and Description (QARD). OCRWM procured items and services
subject to NRC regulation that could affect the health and safety of the public must comply with
and be controlled under the applicable provisions of the QARD. Therefore, OCRWM contractors
performing work on contracts and delivering items and/or services subject to the controls of the
QARD must perform the work in compliance with the provisions of the QARD and an OCRWM
approved QA Program. The applicability of the specific provisions of the QARD to the
contractor and each of its subcontractors' work is dependent upon the nature of the work scope
and the apportionment of the work scope among the contractor and its subcontractors and the
contractual arrangements between the participants. The applicable requirements of the QARD
flow from OCRWM to the contractor, who in turn must flow down those specific applicable
QARD requirements to its subcontractors.

<H3> <A NAME="A21"> <B> 2.1 STRUCTURE OF WORK SCOPE AND PHASING </B>
</A> </H3>
<P>
 The RSA work scope is structured to represent the logical and chronological occurrence of the
distinct work activities. The work segments are called phases, and include: Phase A -
Development of Servicing Plans, Phase B - Acquisition of Hardware Items and Mobilization, and
Phase C - SNF Acceptance and Transport. The purpose of the twelve-month Phase A Planning
work scope is to obtain comprehensive plans and pricing for the work scope defined in both
Phase B and Phase C from each contractor awarded a Regional Servicing Contract. For an RSA
selected by DOE to proceed with Phase B and Phase C, the initial three years of the Phase B
work scope involves the total effort of marshaling the required hardware items, software,
facilities and personnel and preparing to startup waste acceptance and transportation operations
plus the following five years of management and acquisition of required hardware. Phase C,
commencing about three years after start of Phase B, is the five years of waste acceptance and
transportation operations. 
<P>
<H3> <A NAME="A22"> <B> 2.2 PHASE A: DEVELOPMENT OF SERVICING PLANS
</B> </A> </H3>
<P>
 During the twelve-month Phase A, the RSA shall contact each Purchaser with a waste
acceptance allocation within its region and develop Purchaser-approved Purchaser Site Service
Plans; prepare an integrated Regional Servicing Plan; determine required quantities of
transportation and storage components; determine software, personnel, services, and facilities
requirements; prepare a management plan for Phase B and Phase C work scope; and prepare
pricing for Phase C work scope based on the plans and requirements estimates. The Phase A
plans, requirements development, and pricing shall be based on the Regional Waste Acceptance
Schedule (Appendix B). This is the starting point from which the RSA shall initiate discussions
and planning with the Purchasers in its region. The RSA shall deliver the specified quantities of
Purchasers' SNF from the region to the Federal Facility. 
<P>
 The RSA may propose in its Purchaser Site Service Plans and Regional Servicing Plan any
reasonable approaches agreeable to the affected Purchasers. Changes to the Regional Servicing
Plan that affect the delivery schedule or types of transportation cask systems to be used for
delivery of SNF require prior Federal Facility Operator concurrence. 
<P>
<H3> <A NAME="A23"> <B> 2.3 PHASE B: ACQUISITION OF HARDWARE ITEMS AND
MOBILIZATION </B> </A> </H3>
<P>
 Phase B is anticipated to last approximately eight years; the first three years of this phase will
cover pre-operational activities and hardware acquisition, and the last five years will cover
management and continuing transportation cask and storage system hardware acquisition needed
to support the SNF delivery rates during the Phase C waste acceptance and transportation
operations. 
<P>
 OCRWM will only accept delivery and take title to SNF canisters, storage modules, and the
ancillary equipment, with an initial supply of repair parts, required for handling of casks and
canisters and supporting Federal Facility operations. The RSA shall acquire all other hardware
items either through lease or purchase; title to these items shall remain with the RSA or the
lessors. 
<P>
 The pre-operational activities shall include acquisition of dual-purpose systems and related
hardware items needed for startup; provision of a startup supply of storage modules for the
Federal Facility; utility interface activities; coordination with the Federal Facility Operator and
other RSAs; refinement of Purchaser Site Service Plans and the Regional Servicing Plan;
establishment of an operating capability for waste acceptance and transportation; preparation of
procedures and training materials; staffing and training of personnel; performance of institutional
and outreach activities with the public and representatives of local, State and Tribal
organizations; establishment of contracts with carriers, escort services, communication service
suppliers, and other suppliers of needed services; selection of routes; and other pre-operational
activities necessary to support SNF acceptance and transport. 
<P>
 Prior to commencement of Phase C operations, the RSA shall provide dual-purpose systems
and/or canisters in quantities needed for startup operations to those Purchasers in its region in
accordance with the Regional Servicing Plan. 
<P>
 Prior to initiation of SNF shipments at the commencement of Phase C operations and consistent
with the Regional Servicing Plan, the RSA shall provide NRC-approved storage modules
suitable for use at the NRC-licensed Federal Facility for canistered SNF. All equipment required
to handle a transportation cask or a canister including, but not limited to the equipment required
to remove impact limiters from a transportation cask, remove a transportation cask from its
transporter and rotate it to a vertical position, remove the lid from a transportation cask, remove a
dual-purpose canister from a transportation cask, install a dual-purpose canister into a storage
module, and move the storage module to its storage location shall be provided to the Federal
Facility Operator by the RSA. Any equipment required to reverse any of the above actions shall
also be provided to the Federal Facility Operator by the RSA if such equipment is not the same as
the equipment required for the original action. However, any standard tools readily available
from commercial sources shall be furnished by the Federal Facility Operator. 
<P>
<H3> <A NAME="A24"> <B> 2.4 PHASE C - SNF ACCEPTANCE AND TRANSPORT </B>
</A> </H3>
<P>
 Commencement of Phase C will be dependent on establishment of SNF-receiving capability at a
Federal Facility. When Phase C activities are authorized, the RSA shall commence waste
acceptance operations, and transportation and delivery of Purchaser SNF to the Federal Facility.
Additionally, the RSA shall provide NRC-approved storage modules suitable for use at the NRC-
licensed Federal Facility for storage of the canistered SNF delivered by the RSA. In addition,
when authorized by OCRWM, the RSA will provide, as Phase C deliverables, NRC-approved
storage systems and canisters, in accordance with the Regional Servicing Plan. These shall be
suitable for use at the NRC-licensed Federal Facility for uncanistered SNF. 
<P>
 Specific Phase C work includes verification of SNF prior to shipment in accordance with the
Spent Nuclear Fuel Verification Plan in Appendix C; validation of cask loading, provision of
transport services including in-transit physical protection, routing and pre-notifications; initiation
and maintenance of a communications capability; provision of all heavy-haul and intermodal
transfer support; acquisition of permits; payment of tolls and fees; maintenance of equipment;
and continuation of public involvement activities. The RSA shall accept title to the SNF on
behalf of OCRWM and shall act as the Shipping Agent on behalf of OCRWM. 
<P>
 For all rail shipments, the RSA shall arrange for all intermodal transfer and heavy haul transport
services including those from the terminating rail head to the receiving area at the Federal
Facility. For the purpose of this RFP, assume that the heavy haul delivery route from the
terminating rail head to the Federal Facility is 200 miles long
<B>
