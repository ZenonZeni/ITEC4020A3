Brophy (1987) prepared a list of strategies that suitable for application in classrooms to promote student motivation. He developed the list with the <I>expectancy x value</I> theory of Feather (1982).  According to the theory
<DL>
<DD> the effort people will expend on a task is a product of: (1) the degree to which they expect to be able to perform the task successfully if they apply themselves; and (2) the degree to which they value participation in the task itself 	or the benefits or rewards that successful task completion will bring to them.  (Brophy, 1987, p. 41)
</DL>
Brophy suggests that there are certain essential conditions including a supportive environment, an appropriate level of challenge or difficulty, and meaningful learning objectives.  He then sorts and twenty-nine elements into categories including maintaining success expectations, supplying extrinsic rewards, capitalizing of students' intrinsic motivation, and stimulating student motivation with a number of methods.<BR>
<BR>
Frymier and Shulman (1995) studied the importance of immediacy behaviors and relevance on student motivation. Immediacy is a perception "of physical and/or psychological closeness." Verbal and non-verbal immediacy behaviors, according to several studies cited by Frymier and Shulman, have been found to have several positive effects including "increases in affective learning, perceived cognitive learning, recall of information, and motivation" (p. 41).<BR>
<BR>
They suggest that immediacy behaviors help to increase attention, build confidence, and increase satisfaction among students. These conditions are also necessary for students to be motivated.<BR>
<BR>
The fourth condition that Frymier and Shulman found particularly meaningful was relevance of the content to student interest and goals. They found that relevance did correlate with motivation to study.<BR>
<BR>
Many times classrooms are likened to work places. Learning tasks are identified as work. Students complete work without cognitive involvement, without understanding the skill or concept. Marshall (1988) finds the comparison of school to work fails to identify the classroom as a place of learning. Marshall suggests that the goals, the recipient of the intended benefit and the benefit itself, the control or authority base, incentives, and evaluation are clearly different between workplaces and learning environments.<BR>
<BR>
Learning-oriented teachers provided reasons for their students to engage in the learning and encouraged student responsibility.  Common themes included an emphasis on
<OL TYPE=a>
<LI> thinking and the challenge of learning,
<LI> the purpose of school and the assignments as learning,
<LI> peer helping,
<LI> self-evaluation of learning,
<LI> supportiveness of errors as a part of the learning process, as well as
<LI> acceptance of individual differences,
<LI> positive expectations, and
<LI> preventive management. (Marshall, 1988, p. 15)
</OL>
Marshall concludes that there must be changes in the conceptualizations of both teachers and students. Teachers need to see themselves as experts with knowledge to share and they need to have a greater knowledge of learning strategies to help students learn. The student must identify him or herself as a learner not as a worker. Students need to see that they are the intended recipients of the benefits of learning.

<H3 ALIGN=LEFT>Summary</H3>

With inadequate motivation, a student is likely to show little interest or cognitive engagement with learning. There are, however, many elements and approaches which may be undertaken by the teacher in the classroom to encourage students. When students are able to have a sense of security and belonging, when they feel an immediacy with the teacher, and when they begin to be successful, even in small steps, they begin to have greater interest and involvement. With success, the student has a sense of self-efficacy and is more inclined to use effective learning strategies. Even when there is little motivation at the onset, even small successes can stimulate motivation. The teacher must strive to incorporate behaviors which provide emotional and educational support to students.<BR>
