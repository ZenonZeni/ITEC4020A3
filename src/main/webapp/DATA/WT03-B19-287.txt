The economy of the Shepparton/Kyabram/Rodney District revolves
around its rich agricultural sector.
<P>
The range of agricultural activities includes fruit and vegetable
growing, dairy farming, cereal crops, oilseed and livestock production,
particularly sheep and cattle.
</FONT>
<H2>Major export industry</H2>

<P>
<img src="gifs2/shepp1.gif" align=right>
Shepparton and District has a significant export sector, particularly
in food processing.  For example, the Shepparton/Stanhope Bonlac
Foods Ltd, a dairy product manufacturer and marketer, contributes
approximately thirty per cent of Victoria's dairy produce, while
another manufacturer of milk products, the Tatura Milk Industries,
exports approximately $38m worth annually.
<P>
Shepparton-based company, SPC, markets nearly $200m in canned
fruit annually and more than half of Australia's canned fruit
exports.
<P>
Export of fresh fruit and vegetables is also significant.  Other
big names in food processing in the district are Ardmona, Campbell's
Soups, Kraft, Heinz, Unifoods-Rosella, Nestle, Henry Jones M and
the Murray Goulburn Co-Operative.
<P>
Although most of the Shepparton/Kyabram/Rodney District is an
important irrigation area, highly fertile dry land areas are used
for pasture and fodder crops as well as for grazing cattle and
sheep.
<H2>The heart of Victoria</H2>

<P>
Shepparton is the fourth largest provincial city in Victoria and
is the hub of the district and the Goulburn Valley generally.
It provides for the commercial, industrial, social, and recreational
needs of a regional population totalling 60,000.
<P>
Shepparton is also a significant retail centre, serving a trade
area extending into southern New South Wales with a population
of some 140,000.
<P>
The city is situated in the heart of Victoria, about 180 kilometres
north of Melbourne, a little over two hours' drive via the Hume
Freeway and the Goulburn Valley Highway.
<P>
The town of Mooroopna is located on the west side of the Goulburn
River, only minutes away from Shepparton, and it forms a largely
integrated urban system with Shepparton.  The town of Tatura,
which is the civic centre for the Shire of Rodney, is located
nearby.
<P>
Shepparton is connected to Melbourne by excellent train and bus
services.  Shepparton aerodrome provides air charter services,
with pilot-activated lighting and non-directional beacon facilities
for safe night landing.  The aerodrome is only four kilometres
from Shepparton, and the runway and terminal facilities have been
upgraded recently.
<P>
The industrial infrastructure in Sbepparton is first class, particularly
in its basic utility services such as water, sewerage and electricity.
<P>
Kyabram, about thirty-six kilometres to the north-west of Shepparton,
functions as a sub-regional centre.  It also has an excellent
physical and social infrastructure to service the rich dairying
and horticultural hinterland.
<H2> Water and land for industry</H2>

<P>
 The water authority's charges for water, sewerage and trade waste
are among the lowest in Victoria. The quality and low cost of
such services are a major incentive in attracting industry.
<P>

<P>
 A twenty-year plan for a capital works program to upgrade the
city's water supply system at a cost of $3.6m will ensure that
Shepparton will be able to cater for both the needs of residents
and industry well into the future. Water and sewerage is comparatively
inexpensive in Kyabram and Mooroopna.
<P>

<P>
 The establishment of new enterprises is promoted at a number
of industrial estates. Drummond Road Estate in Shepparton, Kyabram
Industrial Estate and Mooroopna Industrial Estates all offer companies
serviced land. Larger tracts of serviceable industrial land are
available close to urban facilities in Shepparton and Kyabram.
<H2> Support services</H2>

<P>

<P>
 As one of the State's largest provincial centres, Shepparton
offers its residents a diverse range of shopping facilities, and
provides local industry with appropriate support services. There
are 670 retail establishments in Shepparton employing over 3,000 
people, with a sales turnover of $300m annually.
<P>
The district has an excellent range of community services, with
well-equipped public and private hospitals, each serviced by an
extensive range of health providers. Recreational facilities include
golf courses, indoor sports centres, outdoor playing fields, courts
and tracks.
<P>
Education is amply provided. Post-secondary education is provided
through Goulburn Valley College of TAFE. The Victorian College
of Agriculture and Horticulture (VCAH) Dookie Campus, which is
linked with Melbourne University, has developed a world-wide reputation
for specialist training in agriculture. It also provides on campus
a complete tertiary education course in nursing.
<P>
In January 1994 the La Trobe University College of Northern Victoria
commenced operations in the Goulburn Valley College of TAFE campus,
offering a range of tertiary courses to local students.
<P>
Shepparton provides quality, affordable housing.
A wide variety of land is available, ranging from the normal residential
subdivision, rural residential allotments of up to one hectare, hobby
farms, all in close reach of the Shepparton central business district.

<H2>Food processing centre</H2>
Growing and processing fruit is a major industry in the district.
 Fruit growing provides more jobs than other agricultural sectors,
while the canneries (SPC, Ardmona and Campbell's Soups) are the
largest manufacturing establishments in the area.
<P>
The Goulburn Valley produces 97 per cent of Victoria's pears,
90 per cent of its peaches and 76 per cent of its apricots.  Nearly
one third of Victoria's tomatoes come from the district, and most
of the crop is grown under contract for local processors.
<P>
Apart from the opportunities that exist in expanding processing
activities, diversification into fresh fruit and vegetables for
export is providing significant opportunities for farmers in the
district.
<P>
Large dairy processors in the district include Bonlac Foods, Midland
Milk, Tatura Milk Products and PJ Ducat and Sons.  Good growth
prospects exist in developing specialty cheeses and fresh milk
products such as yoghurts and dairy desserts.The concentration
of food processing factories in the district provides opportunities
for related industries, such as equipment manufacturers, who would
benefit by locating close to their customers.
<H2>Opportunities for manufacturing</H2>

<P>
The location and export orientation of the district's major agricultural
and processing industries make the transport sector very important
in Shepparton.  The district exports more than 63 per cent of
its total output.
<P>
Since most freight is transported by road, opportunities exist
for transport companies and associated industries, such as transport
equipment and packaging industries, to establish in the district.
<P>
Fabricated metals is one of the larger manufacturing sectors in
Shepparton.  This sector is dominated by several large firms producing
either metal cans for the food processing industry or building
materials.  They include Containers Packaging, Gadsden, Dowell
Aluminium Windows and FJ Furphy and Sons (fabricated structural
steel).
<P>
Several other smaller firms manufacture sheds, windows, gates,
shopfronts, steel frame homes and similar products.  The district
is home to a number of prominent engineering firms such as Furphy,
ED Parsons and JN &amp; R Engineering.
<H2>Solar energy centre</H2>

<P>
A few years ago the Greater Shepparton Area was launched as the
Solar Region.  The region promotes solar energy, particularly
to assist the horticultural and agricultural industries.
<P>
Solar-powered equipment designed to counteract cold, heat, drought,
insects, birds and other hazards, has considerable market applications,
not only for the Shepparton District, but for export markets as
well.
<P>
Irrigation equipment and frost warning devices with world-wide
sales possibilities have been developed.
<P>
The Shepparton Kyabram Rodney Development Corporation is working
closely with local government authorities to assist firms wanting
to relocate, particularly in those industries with a competitive
advantage, and in solar-power related industries.
