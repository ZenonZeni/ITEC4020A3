MITSUBISHI IN DIGITAL DMV PACT

Digi-Media Vision (DMV), the former NTL Advanc-ed Products Division now
owned by Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, has formed an alliance with
the giant Mitsubishi Electric Corporation to develop digital set-top
boxes for worldwide MPEG-2/DVB markets.

Under the deal, Mitsubishi will start making digital receiver-decoders
at its Scottish factories, combining DMV's MPEG-2/DVB-compliant
technology with the Japanese giant's proven TV, video, telecoms and
semiconductor manufacturing skills.

A Mitsubishi spokesman said the aim is to make "300,000 units in the
first year" with the UK and Europe as launch markets.  Although the set-
top boxes would be built on an "open-access" basis for "various
programme providers", he added, it was clear BSkyB would have first
bite of the cherry depending on when and how it goes digital.  The new
joint-venture would be able to produce boxes for satellite, cable or
terrestrial digital markets with equal facility.

The new partnership follows NTL's 1994 alliance with Pace, which
resulted in the first generation of Pace-NTL digital receivers now
reaching markets worldwide.  Unlike Pace, however, Mitsubishi is not
forming a joint venture company with DMV.  The Pace-NTL joint venture -
to be renamed Pace-DMV - is not affected by the new venture.

DMV boss Mike Windram said alliances with other manufacturers and
broadcasters had been "key to the successful introduction of the new
digital technology - we intend to increase our investment in the
development of transmission and receiver technology and this type of
partnership is vital for DMV."

Though a late entrant into the European analogue satellite market with
integrated TV/IRDs, Mitsubishi signalled its intention of being a
mainstream digital player with the opening of its Visual Imaging
research labs in London last summer.  Its six European factories
include an advanced semiconductor fabrication plant which is likely to
be the source of decoder chips.

Thomas the Tank Engine arrives at Cartoon Network

Top kids' station Cartoon Network is chuffed to be showing Thomas the
Tank Engine & Friends.  The programme will be screened daily at 10.30
and 14.30 (UK).  The waiting room has a three-year old copy of
Satellite Trader.

SKY-BRUNO PPV PLAN

BSkyB is considering the screening of the Tyson/ Bruno WBO World Heavy-
weight Championship on March 16 as the broadcaster's first pay-per-view
event.

However, Sky is adamant that "no decision has been made".  Bruno's last
fight, resulted in the highest ever UK satellite audience.  Curiously
advance listings for Sky Sports in March fail to mention Bruno's boxing
bout.

Tyson's last fight was time delayed by Sky, but shown live on TV1000 to
subscribers in Scandinavia.  TV1000 will also be showing the match
against Bruno.

ASTRA 1E BEGINS DIGITAL TRANSMISSIONS

The first digital services have been switched on to the newly-
commissioned Astra 1E as Astra 1F readies for launch.  However, the
lack of available receivers means that the services are only being
viewed by a select few.

The sixth Astra satellite will launch from Baikonur in Southern
Siberia, near the Mongolian border on March 28.  It will be the first
time that Astra-operator SES has used a launcher other than Ariane.

The first two channels to be switched on to Astra 1E were the German
national public broadcasters ARD and ZDF (Transponder 71).  Since
December 31 the clear MPEG-2 transmissions have been broadcast direct
from SES in Luxem-bourg after conversion from the analogue format.

The French Canal satellite package is using transponders 66 and 70; the
transmissions had previously been made from Astra 1D, which also
operates in the Astra 1D band.  The number of channels included in the
multiplex package continues to vary.

Nethold is using Tps 77 and 80 for its test transmissions from its
digital centre in Hilversum.  Again the number of programmes included
is regularly varied, but will include channels in MultiChoice's
Scandinavian package.

DIGITAL DEATH-BLOW FOR EUROSAT SA

Satellite Communications Pty, the Johannesburg-based distributor and
dish-manufacturer which traded as Eurosat South Africa has collapsed
after what founder and MD Sid Trickett describes as the "natural death"
of analogue and C-Band products at the hands of digital DTH.

Provisional liquidator Colin Fisher of Deloitte & Touche Pty said the
company's liabilities amounted to around Rand 3.5 million, against
assets of R250,000.  South Africa's Customs and Excise has a R330,000
claim to certain assets as security for their claims.  In short, Fisher
reckoned that ordinary creditors "don't have any chance" of recovering
anything from the ruins, unless a buyer comes forward before the
liquidation hearing on January 31.

Eurosat - itself "a substantial creditor" - has transferred its
franchise to Grundig International Pty.  Sid Trickett, who said he had
"personally lost R5.5 million" in the collapse, has been contracted by
Grundig to develop the satellite business.

Prior to the collapse, Trickett had signed a deal to handle Grundig's
digital IRD distribution.  Grundig planned to use badged Panasonic IRDs
- but on December 15 "the factory had burnt down".

Satellite Communications' original dish-making business "died a natural
death with the arrival of PAS-4", especially as the onset of Ku-Band
coincided with a steep rise in world prices of aluminium.

"For a while analogue Ku-Band kept us going, but when the ASEC services
from Intelsat 704 shut down, that side came to a screeching halt as
well."

COMPACT DISH HITS THE STREETS

Sky's Compact Dish campaign - the drive to promote a 48cm alternative
to the 60cm Astra dish across southern England first reported in
October's ST - goes live this month after technical and market trials.

The 48-cm `charcoal grey' mesh dish-pack, made by Lenson Heath, is
being stocked by distributors including Longreach, Eurosat and Michael
Black, but will be marketed only in the safe 48cm reception area -
which Sky defines as south of an arc from Hull to Southampton.

Sky's campaign opens on February 3 with ads in regional editions of the
national press and selected local newspapers, and a new pack of in-
store material.  Lenson Heath has geared up to produce "around 25,000
over the next month to six weeks," confirmed sales and marketing
director David Griffin: "We've already shipped 8-9,000 pieces." Griffin
added that it was "near impossible" to predict uptake, though Sky is
clearly hoping the smaller dish will bring a whole new wave of
subscribers into the fold.

GRANADA, SKY LAUNCH GSKYB

Granada and BSkyB have joined forces to launch eight new channels in
late 1996.  The new channels will be led by Granada Gold Plus, which
will offer programming from the extensive libraries of both Granada and
LWT.

Granada Gold will be on-air for 18 hours a day sharing with Granada Men
and Motoring.  The other seven channels will cover a range of lifestyle
topics: Granada Talk TV, Health and Beauty, Home and Garden, Food and
Wine, Good Life, and Shopping Guide.

UAP VERSIONS TCC AND DISCOVERY

TCC has introduced a new version for the Nordic market while sister
channel Discovery has added a Dutch soundtrack.  A backhaul was
introduced on January 1 for TCC Nordic to feed the Thor satellite which
has previously taken the Astra version.  The backhaul is at present
transmitted in clear analogue Pal from Intelsat 601, though the
intention is to switch to an encrypted feed in the near future.

General manager Franklin Getchell said TCC Nordic had been created as a
totally separate service running for 12 hours a day as opposed to the
11 hours of the Astra service.  TCC is on-air between 06.00 and
18.00CET.  "The 12 hours will be a mix of programming.  All of the live
action programming will be regionalised, the pre-school will be added
by the end of the year." Programming for older children, including some
of the high-profile animation will be subtitled.  For younger children
dubbing will be used where the rights allow it.

Discovery, which has been available in Holland since 1989 and is
available in 4.3 million homes, will carry Dutch continuity on a
separate Astra audio subcarrier.  Teletext subtitling in the Dutch
language will also be expanded.

DIGITAL PIRATES STRIKE DIRECTV

Leading experts believe that American DBS service DirecTv is under
attack by digital satellite pirates and that the underground trade in
pirate decoders may soon be draining off subscription revenues from one
of every two DBS receiving sets sold.

Bob Sherman of Satellite Business News claimed, "Piracy could become a
huge potential problem here.  It could become the biggest problem
facing DBS.  The only reason that it is not widespread is because there
is a worldwide chip shortage right now and I think that is holding down
distribution."

Jim Shelton of Shelton and Associates, a San Diego-based consulting
firm agrees with Sherman.  "The only reason that it is not widespread
at this time is probably a shortage of computer chips.  A lot of these
chips require a 26 week lead time." Sherman previously worked at
General Instrument's San Diego-based Videocipher division where he
helped end signal piracy on C-Band dishes.

At the moment, experts believe that there are only between 5,000 to
10,000 black market DBS decoder cards in operation, but Shelton
believes it is only a matter of time before the piracy mushrooms.  "It
could become rampant.  Once they have plenty of cards, you will see
advertising break out in flyers and faxes offering the cards.  If it
continues unchecked, it won't be long before you see them manufacturing
100,000 receiving units a month, but only 50,000 are being legally
authorised." The black market access cards are being sold for between
$500-700.

DirecTv president Eddy Hartenstein has claimed that he is two steps
ahead of the hackers and that he can foil them with electronic
countermeasures or by issuing new decoder cards.  Both Shelton and
Sherman believe the problem will continue to grow.

"CURE" FOR 010 CARD TROUBLES

Difficulties with certain pre-1995 IRDs, caused by the latest Period 10
VideoCrypt smart card have been traced to a mysterious black dot on the
chip.  A number of receivers, including Pace IRDs have been affected by
problems ranging from an annoying audible tone and an unwarranted "Card
Invalid" on-screen message.

Technical author Martin Pickering says the problem clearly lies with
the card rather than individual receivers.

When tape is placed over the black dot "Card Invalid" appears on every
receiver.  The contact carries the 3.5

MHz clock pulses and acts as a resistor.  Pickering estimates it to
have a value between 1 and 2k Ohms.  As the black spot is worn away the
problem becomes worse.

By cutting the circuit track which leads to the relevant "black dot"
card holder contact, and soldering a 2k2 resistor across the cut track
the problem is apparently cured.

The same modification has been carried out on other PRD receivers, all
of which have been cured.  It is not known whether or not the cure will
work on other receivers.

SPORTS PROMO BACK FOR WORLD CUP CRICKET

Sky has reintroduced its free sports promotion ahead of the Cricket
World Cup.  Sky Sports will be screening exclusive coverage of the
tournament.  The 1992 event led to a 40 per cent surge in dish sales
and is widely believed to be responsible for that summer's shortage in
receiving equipment.

New subscribers signing up to the total Sky package will not be charged
for the sports element of the package for the first six months of their
subscription.

GRUNDIG'S HALF MILLION

The 500,000th satellite receiver recently rolled off the production
line of Grundig's South Wales factory, 20 months after its opening
straight into the hands of VP Johan van Splunter (pictured below).
Initially a joint venture be-tween Grundig and Welsh in-dustrialist Alf
Gooding, the factory is now wholly owned by Grundig and has become the
German manufacturer's sole source of receivers.

NEWS BYTES

Kinnevik is finally ready to sell TV1000 to FilmNet's owners NetHold,
according to a report in Swedish business daily Finanstidningen.  BET
International is launching BET on Jazz: The Cable Jazz Channel as part
of the MultiChoice packet for Southern Africa.  Orion 1 is to
distribute Performance: The Arts Channel to cable operators from
February 1.  It joins Channel One, which will also use the NTL/Orion
digital transmission system.  Compression will be using the DVB-
compliant System 3000.  The Racing Channel has reached 10,000
subscribers - a third of its first year's target - within seven weeks
on air.  Anthony Sethill - late of Amstrad - has quit the German
company to take up a similar role for Samsung Electronics (UK)'s
telecoms division.  Philips has given a fillip to the proposed
Electrical Retailing Show (Birmingham NEC, March 24-26) by deciding to
unveil its '96 UK consumer electronics range at the new trade-only
event.  So far some 70 firms have signed up, including Astra, Nokia,
Toshiba and Samsung.  Following the review of the new Philips BDE353
Mac decoder in your Dec/Jan ST we received many calls about its
availability.  So too Eurosat which has now obtained an initial batch,
which is now available for shipment.

ECHOSTAR LAUNCHES DBS COMPETITION BEGINS

EchoStar successfully launched its high powered DBS satellite EchoStar
1 from China on December 28 and now hopes to be in the marketplace by
late February or early March.

EchoStar plans to launch EchoStar 2 from China during the summer.  The
service will provide over 200 channels of digital video, audio and data
services and become America's second true DBS provider, after DirecTv.
While PrimeStar offers DTH services, it transmits from a medium powered
satellite restricting its receiving dishes to a now ungainly 30 inches.
 Alpha-Star, slated to start service during the first quarter of 1996
will also transmit from a medium powered satellite.

EchoStar believes that it is in a strong position to compete with the
established American DTH and DBS providers.  To begin with it has been
in the TVRO business as a hardware supplier since 1980 and has
operations in Holland, Spain, Singapore China, Hong Kong, Indonesia and
India.

While not yet ready to release its marketing or launch plans EchoStar
plans to come into the market at prices below other DBS/DTH providers.
Its prospectus states that the retail cost or an EchoStar receiving
system will be in the $500 (#325) range, well below the cost entry
level costs of $700 (#455) for a DirecTv system.

TMS INSTALLS MULTI-SATELLITE SMATV

A multiple satellite smatv system delivering signals from Astra and two
Eutelsat craft has been installed by London-based TMS Satellite &
Aerial Systems.  The complex IF communal system was installed for the
Ladybur Housing Co-operative in Tottenham, North London to deliver
signals into 156 self contained flats.

TMS, which also has a branch in Alicante, Spain was commissioned to
design and build a system for Ladybur in March 1995, when no other
company was capable of offering a similar set-up.

The system comprised of four headends using a Televes amplifier,
splitters and five in four out tone switch controlled multi-switches.
This gave each flat the two polarities from the Astra system plus one
polarity each from the Eutelsats at 13 degrees and 10 degrees East.  It
is believed to be one of the first installations to use this method to
control four polarities from satellite together with the four UHF
terrestrial channels and FM radio through a single cable.

The configuration allows the reception of English, German, Spanish,
Dutch, Asian and Japanese channels from Astra with Eutelsat providing
programming in Arabic, Turkish, French and Polish.

SATELLITE VIEWER SERVICES WOUND UP

Satellite Viewer Services, based in Old Burlington Street, London W1,
has been compulsorily wound up in the High Court.

The petition to wind-up the company was presented to the court last
November by the Home Video Channel Limited, owners of The Adult
Channel, who said in its petition that despite demands for payment the
company remained indebted to them, was insolvent and unable to pay its
debts.

At the hearing Counsel representing HVC told the court that his client
was a trade creditor who was owed a petition debt of #31,000, and
applied to the court to wind up the company's affairs.  On his
application Mr Registrar Pimm made the order to wind-up the company.

HAVE I GOT NEWS FOR YOU

International news channel BBC World has been on-air for 12 months, but
its presence in the UK is deliberately hidden, writes Julian Clover

Sometimes it feels as if everyone wants to run a news channel; CNN
International has been on-air for ten years and satellite viewers can
tune into news broadcasts from Berlin, Paris, London and Lyon.

1995 saw a new crop with the launch of European Business News, CNBC
Europe and BBC World, the latter formed out of BBC World Service
Television, which had broadcast to Asia as part of Star TV.  In Europe
the news channel had been carried overnight on the old entertainment
service.

The BBC Europe channel from the Intelsat 27.5oW location had evolved
out of a rough mix of BBC1 and BBC2, the result of a demand for English
language programmes from Scandinavian cable companies.  This in turn
picked up more than a passing interest from DTH viewers who tuned into
the easily hacked Save transmissions before a switch to D2 Mac was
made.  DTH subscriptions for BBC Prime, again for outside the UK, are
handled by the Swedish subscriber management service TV Extra.

Listeners to short wave will be more than familiar with some of the
titles given to BBC World's extended news programmes; BBC Newsdesk,
Newshour and Newsroom would not look out of place coming from Bush
House instead of Television Centre.  The feature programmes also have a
familiar ring about them; Breakfast with Frost, Film '96,
Correspondent, and Panorama, including that royal interview.

The European feed from Eutelsat II F1 is transmitted from the Maxat
uplink at Teddington, where advertisements sold by the BBC
Worldwide/Pearson/Cox Communications joint venture company European
Channel Management are also added.  The spaces are filled by the
"Highlights In.  .  ." trailers while the rest of the world catches up.
 "We're selling enough airtime now that at the Teddington uplink more
and more of the ads go over the previews," explains ECM managing
director Marcus Bicknell.  "If it's a four minute break which we've
sold two minutes of, then the other two minutes are on-air promotions,
promotion of teletext and promotion of specific European stuff without
the Bangkok and Tokyo times."

After working as a consultant during the start up of BBC World and the
now rebranded entertainment channel BBC Prime Bicknell, the founder
commercial director of SES and previously marketing director at The
Children's Channel and the old UK film channel Premiere, joined ECM in
June last year.  His style is anything other than what is expected from
a BBC executive, but there again ECM is run as a private company from
private capital not encroaching on the domestic licence fee.

The past 12 months since the launch have concentrated more or less on
BBC Prime.  Fine tuning the mix of current and classic BBC and Thames
programmes into a selection more suitable for the European palate.

Prime is not a channel for ex-pats: EastEnders gets a regular showing
in line with BBC1, while other popular dramas such as Casualty as shown
often within a few weeks of their domestic screening.  Purchased films
are missing from the schedule as are sports programmes Grandstand and
Match of the Day.  Over the past few months Prime has introduced a
stripped schedule with regular slots for specific programme genres.

This year BBC World will receive the treatment starting on January 1
with the introduction of the long awaited teletext service.  "What we
had previously was an anachronism which was basically a feed from
Ceefax which went on the BBC World Service Television European service.
 It continued on Prime because the server just happened to be there."
Difficulties arose from bought in information which the BBC did not
have the rights to with the providers demanding payment.  The new
service, provided by the private company Intelfax, rather than Ceefax,
will eventually feature news, business, travel and of course a detailed
programme guide for the two services.  Both Prime and World will be the
subject of a major advertising campaign this year.

Across on Intelsat 601 BBC Prime continues to broadcast in D2 Mac.  Its
movement to Eutelsat 13 degrees being unlikely while there is no single
encryption system capable of reaching the whole of Europe.

The digital horizon however paints a more attractive option.  Already
BBC World is part of the MultiChoice package in South Africa and it is
reasonable to expect that BBC World, and probably Prime, would find
itself as part of the MultiChoice packages in Europe.  Britain will
remain firmly off the agenda; there are no rights held for the UK
market and in any case the BBC's news and current affairs directorate
has ambitions for a domestic news channel as part of a terrestrial
digital multiplex.

"We get hundreds of calls a week from people interested in Prime, we
get very low conversion because when they find it's on Intelsat with a
1.2 metre dish and in D2 Mac Eurocrypt M.  .  .I haven't inherited the
most glamorous distribution policy in the world," pines Bicknell.

Distribution difficulties are coupled with a pricing policy which
requires DTH subscribers to pay the equivalent to #70 per month while
cable viewers enjoy the channel as part of a wider extended basic
package.  "It's an unfair accident of technology, satellites and
encryption and we're trying to correct it.  What you'll see when the
digital packages roll out is World moving off and getting maximum
penetration and by the end of 1996 it would be very attractive for
somebody to get both channels from the same dish."

 Digital will allow further expansion; opt-outs in programming whereby
Asia would get its own dedicated programming while the rest of the
world continues with the standard service.  Such opt outs would be
extended to allow the programme packagers to take their own individual
slots.  "Part of being relevant to a non-Anglo Saxon target audience is
to know what individual programmes have got to say." This manifests
itself in the new Window on the World programme produced in Germany by
S-Zett-Magazin which currently contributes to Vox.  Initially the
programme will be transmitted with an English soundtrack only, but
already there are plans to introduce a separate German audio channel.
7.02 MHz will be used for English and 7.20MHz for German, there are no
plans to introduce any further languages in Europe.

With the European audience in mind other new programmes have recently
been added to the World schedule; Europe Today appears as a six to
eight minute segment in the three principal news magazines BBC
Newsdesk, BBC Newsday and The World Today.  The Asian Continent also
gets its own breakfast news briefing, BBC although the transmission
time of 01.00 to 04.00GMT means BBC Newsroom will be viewed only by the
most hardy European viewer.

By the end of 1996 14 million homes had access to BBC World, a mix of
DTH from Eutelsat and cable operators in Europe, the latter bolstered
by interest from the Netherlands and Germany where a terrestrial
frequency in Berlin is also a possibility.  "The channel is good, it is
in depth and it goes that bit further," boasts Bicknell.  Typically a
news channel will be viewed for between 12 and 18 minutes, whereas BBC
World is between 24 and 35.  "This means that somebody will watch the
25 minutes news, they'll stay for an ad break, or they're watching Time
Out; Tomorrow's World, Film '96 plus the headlines." This has been a
delight for the advertisers, who are also tumbling to the fact that BBC
World is the first BBC branded channel to carry advertising in the
first place.

Despite all the success in Europe BBC World will remain forever closed
to the UK viewer despite presently being in-the-clear from Eutelsat;
"Certainly if I was talking to a CAI conference I would warn them that
it would start decaying in time because it would never be in a UK
digital package." The Eutelsat feed will remain `for the foreseeable
future' and the implication is that BBC Prime would be first to vanish
from the analogue environment within a few years.

VIDEOCRYPT 2 INTO 1 WILL GO

Quantum Trading has produced a conversion kit which allows VideoCrypt
II cards to be used in standard VideoCrypt IRDs.  The conversion is
proving particularly popular with the Asian community in Europe where
new subscribers to Zee TV are being issued with the VC2 card.  It works
with all receivers with the exception of the Echostar 8700 where the
conversion does not fit.

The conversion is made by removing the IW03 and IW05 chips inserting
the kit, then replacing the two chips into new positions.  Quantum has
been supplied with its chips by the VideoCrypt proprietary rights
holder Thomson.  Once fitted it remains possible to continue viewing
channels using both VideoCrypt I and VideoCrypt II codes.  Where a
channel is transmitting two codes the conversion will always opt for
the VideoCrypt I code.

NEW SOUND FROM PACE

Pace's latest analogue IRD - the MSS 290, due for launch at April's
Cable & Satellite Show in London - will be the first to incorporate its
new `Stereo 3D' audio circuitry to provide a near-surround-sound
experience via a normal stereo TV set.

The Stereo 3D effect - greatly enhanced spatial sound which is a big
step up from normal Nicam stereo, and one step down from full-blown
Dolby Pro-Logic active surround sound - is produced by a sound
processing chip designed by Pace engineers.  The effects are selectable
from an additional on-screen menu, and the IRD can be connected up to a
hi-fi system to maximise the three-dimensional sound impact.  The unit
can also be used for stereo VCR playback to add pseudo-surround
effrects to videos.

The MSS 290 is set to retail at #229, with the enhanced audio system
likely to be heavily promoted as an added-value feature to persuade
punters to trade up from the all-pervasive under-#100 Astra system.
Pace also intends to incorporate Stereo 3D into certain export models,
but will retain Dolby Pro Logic for its top-of-the-range MSS1000
series.

INCLINED TO A DEGREE

Inclined orbit satellites are there one minute and gone the next.  Asim
Hussein explains how to track them down

Satellite system installers, broadcasters and viewers are fortunate
because a large proportion of the satellites that beam TV back to Earth
are in stable geostationary orbits.  However, what about receiving
signals from that increasing number of satellites that seem to fade in
and out every day or which simply can't be located at times?

The reason may be that the required satellite has an inclined orbit.
Inclined that is, to the plane of the usual geostationary arc.  In the
satellite operating industry the concept of allowing satellites to move
is not new.  In the '80s the Intelsat 5 craft were all in such orbits,
and at the same time USA operator Comsat began regular inclined-orbit
operations and coined the other name for such heavenly wandering - the
Comsat Manoeuvre.

Why is this done ? It lengthens the life of satellites by saving
hydrazine fuel.  Most satellites are maintained in position by the
firing of the propulsion engines for North-South and East-West station-
keeping, leaving the bird within about 100km of the nominal position.
If this is not done every few weeks the natural gravitational forces of
the sun and moon gradually, though imperceptibly at first, force the
satellite into an inclined plane orbit by about 0.8 degrees each year.
The rocket propellant saved can be used to maintain East-West station-
keeping within 0.1 degree but not for North-South, allowing the
satellite to move up and down.

When viewed from the earth or received with a satellite dish, an
inclined-orbit satellite no longer hangs in the sky as an apparently
stationary object.  It's pattern of movement is a definite `figure 8'
pattern that repeats every 24 hours unless a motor is fired to correct
it.  (Satellites at the edge of the arc that are inclined still execute
an `8' pattern, but in the higher latitudes this is skewed).  The
benefits of fuel conservation and a longer operational life have a down
side, because inclined orbits mean tracking problems for satellite
installations on Earth.

Other effects are that the footprint illuminated by an inclined orbit
satellite varies too, this can cause signal fluctuation.  SCPC, a
narrow band signal type, is even affected by Doppler shift, as the
velocity of the satellite changes so does the received frequency eg A
satellite inclined by 2 degrees changes frequency by a maximum of
1.5kHz.

Polar capped

One dealer has kept his eye on the ball and on these moving satellites.
 Smallworld Satellite of Birmingham has put together a winning
combination of the TSS Inclined Orbit Polar-mount, for which it has
sole UK distribution and the very latest 1500 channel Chaparral
Monterey 140 receiver-positioner.  Ordinary polar-mounts allow tracking
across the East-West arc but the TSS mount can be moved in elevation
too (up and down to you and me).  This is achieved through some rugged
galvanised steel metalwork and roller bearings which allow two
actuators to be attached, one for each plane of movement.  Control of
each actuator could be achieved by the use of a receiver positioner and
an additional positioner.  However, the smart consumer will opt for the
easy option, which is to use the Monterey 140.  The flagship receiver
has an inclined interface unit built-in and the effects were most
impressive.

ST was shown how a satellite position can be stored within the
receiver's memory.  On returning to that nominal position from another
satellite, the receiver stops.  It tracks East and West slightly to
peak the signal, but if the satellite has moved it will track the dish
up and then down, until a signal is traced.  It will then peak again,
side to side for optimum signal and repeat the process until a peak is
obtained.

Once locked onto a satellite, the receiver can be programmed to check
that maximum signal is being achieved by tracking imperceptibly in each
direction, without disrupting the signal.  This check can occur at
regular intervals with a time delay of one to 60 minutes.

When we used the system it was hooked up to a 2.5 metre prime focus
dish situated at Smallworld's showroom and roof-top dish site in
Birmingham, just off the M6 motorway.  We observed the Russian C-Band
TV signals from the wobbly 11 degrees West and 40 degrees East
satellites - they were tracked accurately and without a break.  When
the feed-horn was covered and tracking lost, the receiver caused the
two motors to track and signal was restored within a few seconds.

At the more usual Ku-Band, the higher frequency means that the
beamwidth, the tiny angle over which any satellite can be received
before it fades, is much reduced.  The test dish had a beamwidth of 0.8
between the 6dB signal points (see table 2).  A 6dB decrease in signal
strength is enough of a loss for signal near threshold to become
unwatchable.  However, even dishes of one metre diameter, with a beam-
width of nearer 1.5, suffer when Ku-Band satellites are inclined.  Just
try following a feed on the Eutelsat I F4 at 25.5 degrees, which moves
through a massive 4.2 degrees each day.  This system is a boon to
anyone wishing to track the satellites listed in our table 1 or for the
low elevation satellites that most polar mounts miss.

The TSS Inclined Polarmount can be used with a variety of dishes like
Trac, Triax, Precision, Channel Master suitable for adaptation.
Smallworld recommends an optical actuator arm for accurate North-South
tracking without backlash (hysteresis).  Besides the Monterey 140, some
other receivers such as Drake and Echostar can use the TSS mount.
Malcolm Titmus, Smallworld's proprietor can supply and install systems
for inclined orbit operation, normal multi-satellite systems and fixed
dish installations.  An inclined system has been installed at a
professional TV broadcaster's site; they no longer have to worry about
losing signal at a critical moment.  This was all achieved at the
fraction of the cost of previous tracking systems.  The TSS Inclined
Tracking Polarmount starts at #299.

MONTEREY'S LITTLE BROTHER

With its latest receiver, the m60e, chaparral has again proved it knows
how to manufacture a top class receiver.  Rob Ulrich took the new baby
home to play.

Currently there's a great demand for low cost receivers to be used as
fixed systems.  However, low cost usually means back to basics: poor
audio and video quality and no extra features like an on-screen
display, VCR timers, low threshold, etc.  What about the M60e? is the
Chaparral M60e a real basic product? Chaparral usually stands for high
tech and top quality, so has San Jose's finest sold out?

Chaparral is one of the leading manufacturers of LNBs, polarisers and
high-end satellite receivers.  At last year's Cable & Satellite show
Chaparral introduced the e-series providing low cost receivers for both
fixed and steerable systems.  Amsterdam's The Satellite Shop (TSS)
recently introduced the first model in the series, the M60e.  TSS is
the sole distributor for Europe for this receiver.

Design-wise M60e is very familiar.  The designers chose the same
styling as their previous creation, the Monterey 140.  The M60e is a
mid-sized satellite receiver, especially designed for fixed dishes.  A
four-digit LED-display is located on the front panel, as well as some
small buttons for channel up/down, volume and standby.  The back panel
is a surprise - Chaparral has introduced Scart sockets for connecting a
decoder and a VCR.  There are also phono outputs for audio, video and
baseband plus quick-fit connectors for an external 12 Volt device and a
mechanical polariser.  On both LNB inputs several LNB types can be
connected.  Not only LNBFs, such as a quatroband or an Astra Universal
LNBF, but also standard C and Ku-Band LNBs.  The M60e can also be used
in any multifeed or C/Ku-Band system.

The frequency range of the M60e runs from 950 to 2050MHz while the IF
bandwidth can be adjusted to 27, 18, 15 or 13MHz.  When choosing 13 or
15MHz the internal threshold extender is also activated.  Another
surprise on the M60e is the absence of an original Wegener audio
compander, a feature which always has been part of Chaparral receivers.
 The M60e is equipped with the Philips TDA 8741 chip - effectively the
next best thing to Wegener.  The audio channels are tuneable between
five and nine MHz and there are two audio IF bandwidths (150/330kHz).

The M60e has an easy to use on-screen display for (re-) programming the
200 channels.  The distributor has already programmed the channels with
the most popular stations on Astra and Eutelsat, but if you want to
change them all are freely programmable.

Pressing the Menu key on the remote control brings up the first on-
screen display menu page on the screen.  This menu page includes the
event timer, parental lock, copy mode, channel erase, frequency offset
and data transfer.  The event timer allows nine events to be recorded
over a period of four weeks.  Nine of the 200 channels can be stored as
favourites.  With the data transfer option the memory of one M60e can
be transferred to another M60e.  When menu key is pressed again, the
second menu page appears.  With this menu we can change the frequency,
LNB input, polarity (when a LNBF is connected) or skew (when using a
mechanical polariser), deviation and activate the internal 22kHz
generator for band switching with a quatroband LNBF.  The frequency
displayed on the menu is the IF frequency, in Normal (Ku-Band) mode
between 950 and 2050MHz, in Invert (C-Band) mode between 3100 and
4200MHz.  The third menu page (yes, after pressing on Menu again) is
the audio menu.  With this menu the audio frequency, de-emphasis and
bandwidth can all be adjusted.

In our testlab, we connected the M60e to an 80cm and a 1.40m dish to
get an impression of the video quality.  A Videotek video monitor was
used to provide information about the video.  The chroma delay of the
M60e is good compared to many other quality receivers.  Looking at the
picture more closely, we discovered less video noise than found on
other receivers.  Our overall impression of the video quality was very
good.

But what about the sound quality? As we said, the M60e is the first
Chaparral receiver without an original Wegener compander.  Comparing it
to, for instance, the Monterey 140 is not fair.  The M60e produces a
nice sound, but of course not as transparent as the Monterey 140.
That's why the price is low.  Besides that, only real Wegener
companders can reproduce the best Wegener sound.  The threshold
extender of the M60e expands the amount of weak signals which can be
received.  We did some experiments on Nile TV on Eutelsat II F3.
Without using the threshold extender, we could only see a picture
covered with sparklies.  But when the bandwidth was switched to 13MHz,
Nile TV appeared on the screen minus the sparklies! We had the same
experience with the CMT signal on Intelsat 601 and some C-Band signals
on both Intelsat 702 and Arabsat 1C.  The quality of the picture is
surprisingly good.  Imagine what can happen with these signals when
using a 3m dish! Without any doubt the M60e is a very interesting
receiver for the Middle East and African countries, where the signal
strength is lower than in Europe.

In Europe the M60e can be used for receiving almost every satellite
signal.  After connecting several decoders (Pace VC100, Philips BDE 353
and Luxcrypt) the picture was as good as that on unencrypted signals.
It took only a few seconds until the decoders were activated.

The Chaparral M60e is an interesting and easy to use receiver with some
unique features.  We tried this impressive receiver on both C and Ku-
Band systems.  The threshold extender impressed and gave a big
advantage on weak signals, such as Nile TV on Eutelsat II F3.  The
quality of both video and audio was good, exactly what we might expect
from Chaparral.  Most surprising is the price.  The new small Chaparral
receiver will retail for only #199.

FASTER, HIGHER, FURTHER

Satellite offers the whole gamut of sporting action.  Touchline
reporter Julian Clover looks at who has the top events and finds Sky is
not the only place to watch the premiership.

Each year there are key events which stand out in the sporting calendar
and every year satellite television, or should that read Sky, helps
itself to more of them.  There is no doubting the pulling power of
Premiership Football, World Cup Cricket or Formula 1 motor racing to
encourage that purchasing decision.

Sky continues to add to its sports roster to the frustration of the
terrestrial channels, and assorted backbench MPs, while Eurosport is
often able to supplement network television with extended coverage of
events such as Formula 1 alongside its own exclusives.  FilmNet has now
spun off Supersport as a standalone channel in both the Benelux and
Nordic countries, though this will only be available to the few able to
access digital transmissions.  Sportkanalen, in D2 Mac, will join the
virtually free-to-air package at five degrees East in March.

Super Sunday and Monday Night Football have become key fixtures in
themselves throughout the football season and will be joined in the
autumn by fixtures from the Endsleigh League.  Sky claims that this
will cover all three divisions and not just the clubs in Division One.
Full Saturday afternoon coverage of every game on the Premiership
programme may have to wait until digital makes its UK debut, but
Scandinavian viewers can already tune in.  Saturday afternoons on NRK
(in clear D Mac from Intelsat 702) or TV2 (encrypted in D2 Mac).  These
are typically the matches being taped for BBC1's Match of the Day later
that evening.  TV Pluss also shows delayed matches from around
18.00CET.  Sweden's TV4 from Sirius also has the rights to screen
Saturday afternoon matches.

FilmNet and SuperSport subscribers can also view English Premiership
matches, normally screened simultaneously with Sky, although Monday
night matches on FilmNet 1 (formerly FilmNet Plus) are normally time
delayed by about an hour.  FilmNet/SuperSport's commitment to football
also takes in coverage of the Dutch, Italian and German leagues,
according to which version you watch.  FilmNet (Central Europe) from
Astra in VideoCrypt II continues to screen occasional local matches
from Poland.

SuperSport is currently available as a standalone channel on cable to
Belgium, Holland and Scandinavia.  It's distributed by satellite in
digital format from Astra and Intelsat 601.  Availability will increase
in line with the roll-out of digital reception equipment.

Naturally the German broadcasters have extensive coverage of the
Bundesliga; Sat1 follows the fortunes in its programme Ran.  German
Internation-als are typically live on ARD or ZDF.  Channel 4's Italian
football feed can be found on Eutelsat II F3 while the sole purpose of
Rai Tre's Sunday only broadcasts are for the late night round up of the
weekend's matches.

Rugby Super League coverage begins on March 29 as the Sheffield Eagles
travel to France to play the newly formed Paris team.  Sky is promising
to screen every Super League club at least twice in the first two
months of the season.

Eurosport's great strength lies in its ability to stay with an event
and nothing will be more true this summer when it provides 24 hour
coverage of the Olympic Games in Atlanta.  In addition to continuing
Formula One coverage Eurosport will screen live each round of the
Indycar World Series.  British drivers Mark Blundell and Johnny Herbert
have both been offered drives.  The Motorcycle Grand Prix season will
also be shown in full, live and exclusive.

Slightly slower bicycles, though not by far, will be on display in the
Tour de France.  Eurosport will also be screening European PGA Golf,
Equestrian World Cup and the Ice Hockey World Cup.

The Racing Channel continues to cover typically two, sometimes three
race meetings daily.  This is supplemented by the return of evening
racing in Sky Sports The Winning Post, produced by The Racing Channel
alongside the early morning Racing News.

DOING IT BY THE BOOK

Installation practices need tightening up now that digital is on the
way, writes Bill Collins

It is no secret that the world of television and radio is heading
towards digital, raising new issues in respect of installation
practice.  To help installers, Astra will soon be publishing a new
Guide to Professional Dish Installation which is specifically designed
to address these issues.  The original brochure, which has proved very
popular since its original publication in 1993, contains tips and
reminders on how to avoid problems when installing analogue satellite
systems.  The new guide is concerned not only with the practicalities
of satellite dish installation but also understanding the differences
that digital will make and helping installers to avoid the pitfalls.

Digital transmission relies on a different modulation technique to the
earlier analogue satellite signals whose modulation was different to
terrestrial broadcasts.  These differences are important for installers
in that they create different reactions to similar problems in
installation.  A small error in cabling which can cause teletext drop-
out on a terrestrial installation can cause sparklies on an analogue
satellite system.  The same error on a digital installation can
completely obliterate the signal.

Quadrature Phase Shift Key (QPSK) is the modulation technique used for
transmission of digital signals via satellite.  The reception of QPSK
signals depends fundamentally on the receiver recognising the phase of
the incoming signal.  It follows that any defect in the reception
system that interferes with the signal phase will substantially degrade
the reception.  A dictionary definition of phase is given as `That
fraction of the period which has elapsed in a periodic function or wave
measured from some fixed origin' Another way of looking at it is the
position along the peaks and troughs of a waveform.

If the time for one period is represented as 360 degrees along a time
axis, the phase position, at any particular moment, is called the phase
angle.  For example the phase angle at the position marked `X' in
Figure 1 is 225 degrees.  Recognition of the phase angle is simple
where the signal is clearly defined but any interference effects that
disturb, or otherwise disguise, the phase can be the source of serious
problems for digital reception.

By far the most common cause of phase disturbance is mismatching in the
system.  Impedance changes generate reflections of the main signal that
can bounce backwards and forwards within a network.  These impedance
changes are known as mismatches.  The reflections show as standing
waves on the cable which, because they are of the same
frequency/wavelength as the original signal, will be combined by the
receiver and seen as a single waveform which may have completely
different characteristics to the original.

A mismatch can be caused by a number of factors.  Physical damage to
the cable, poorly made connections, water ingress, or even just kinking
of the cable by making a bend too tight are all common causes of
mismatching.  Poor quality cable can show `ripple,' a kind of built in
mismatch caused by low grade production machinery and methods, even
with no induced faults caused during installation

Figure 2 illustrates some of the effects of a mismatch.  When the
original signal reaches the mismatch point some of it is reflected back
along the cable.  One effect of this is to lower the signal level
initially passing through the mismatch point to the receiver.  Secondly
the reflected signal passing back along the cable will generate further
reflections at previous mismatches or even the connection at the signal
origin.  The phase, or peaks and troughs, of each of these reflections
will have different positions to the original waveform.

The resulting signal arriving at the receiver is a combination of both
the waveforms (a) and (b) at the right-hand side of the mismatch point.
 The amplitude, shape and phase of the signal seen by the receiver, as
shown in Figure 3, can be radically different to the original.  By its
very nature this article can only offer a simple illustration of what
is a very complex problem.  Within a satellite system the reflections
and their standing waves are infinitely more complex than that shown
here.

The effect on phase of even a single standing wave can be sufficient to
prevent reception of a digital TV channel, but in a real installation
there may be a very large number of mismatch reflections combining at
the receiver.  Care and attention to detail and use of good quality
materials has always been the mark of the true professional.  This will
be even more applicable in the digital future than it is today.
Whereas earlier modulation techniques were more forgiving in terms of
installation quality, digital allows little room for error.

OPEN UP THE BOX

It's time to grab a screwdriver, and to prise the lid off the box to
see what's inside.  How are digital decoders organised and why do they
cost as much as they do? Gwyn Morgan explains.

In the last two articles we have taken a look at the theoretical side
of digital television, how vision and sound compression works and how
the `packets' of data are numbered and labelled in tables so that the
decoders know how to sort them out and put them into television
services.  Now it's time to open up the box and look inside.

If we are talking about DTH digital satellite television then we really
need to start outside the house at the LNB attached to the dish which
in most cases will need to be changed for digital reception.  You can
broadcast digital services on almost any satellite using almost any
frequency and all sorts of bandwidths from very narrow to very wide.
But for Direct-to-Home consumer services virtually all the digital
channels will be broadcast in the BSS (Broadcast Satellite Services)
frequency bands.  So far we have been used to Astra and Eutelsat
services broadcast in the FSS range from 10.7 to 11.7 Gigahertz (GHz).
Virtually all the LNBs installed until recent months will only work
between this range of FSS frequencies.  The digital services will
operate at a higher frequency range from 11.7 to 12.75GHz.

The extra frequencies are not the only reason that new LNBs are needed
for digital satellite reception.  Digital signals are rugged and can
resist interference and noise very effectively but digital equipment is
much more susceptible to "jitter" than analogue equipment.  Jitter, or
"Phase Noise" is the equivalent of a continual small change in
frequency caused by noise or lack of stability of the oscillator in the
LNB.  Lack of stability might itself be caused by poor regulation of
the low voltage power supply from the cable.

The new Universal LNBs are now recommended for all satellite
installations.  They will receive all the analogue services that are
available today but they will also tune to the BSS frequencies for
digital services when they arrive.  Universal LNBs will also provide
the high stability, or low "phase noise" that is essential to feed
digital receivers.

Once the signal lands inside the receiver the first thing it meets is
the tuner-demodulator.  A digital tuner/demodulator is rather different
from the analogue version.  It will probably look the same - a small
shiny tin box on the PCB - and in essence it will do much the same
task.  First it tunes to the correct carrier frequency for the service
you need and filters out one group or "multiplex" of digital services
from a particular transponder on the satellite.  The digital data is
carried on the satellite signal using Quadrature Phase Shift Keying
(QPSK) which is very loosely a digital equivalent of the FM (frequency
modulation) used for analogue services.  An analogue tuner/demodulator
will not work for digital signals.  The digital QPSK demodulator
extracts the original Os and 1s that were inserted at the transmission
point.

The next task for the tuner/demodulator is to remove the "Forward Error
Correction" a sort of digital equivalent of a postal jiffy bag.

In the last article we saw how all the digital packets are sorted and
labelled and assembled into a "Transport Stream".  The transmission
path from broadcaster to receiver can get very nasty with noise,
interfering frequencies, fading and all the many disasters that the
signals encounter on the way.  So to keep the transport stream from
being damaged beyond recognition it needs to be neatly packaged in its
digital jiffy bag which naturally needs a suitably technical title.  It
is called Forward Error Correction because you add the correction data
before you transmit the signal, fully expecting that the signal is
going to get pushed, punched and stamped on as it makes its way to
through the airwaves.

Forward error correction works in several different ways.  First it
mixes up the order that the data is transmitted.  The chances are that
interference will come as a burst of noise that comes and goes - just
like a noisy motorbike driving past your house.  If you mix up the bits
so that some of the early parts of the transmission are transmitted
next to some of the later parts then the effect of the burst of noise
will be less noticeable because it will be spread out and will affect
isolated parts of the transmission.  This technique is called
convolutional coding.

On its own mixing up the bits and changing their sequence is not
enough.  You have to add extra data bits as well as mix up the data.
The extra data lets the decoder do some simple arithmetic to check that
the digital bits have been received correctly.  For example if I said
that all the words I wrote would have a number after them (4) to (2)
say (3) how (3) many (4) letters (7) there should be in each word you
would soon tell if something was incorrect (5) (= wrong).  The larger
the number of extra bits you add so the more errors you can correct but
of course the transmission then becomes less efficient overall so there
is always a trade-off to make.

When the decoder finds that some of the data has been corrupted on the
way it does not have to give up and throw it away.  When it discovers
there are errors the arithmetic will not only let it correct some of
the errors, but if things get really bad the decoder will make a best
guess at what the data should have been, using a technique called
Viterbi.

When the digital bits are flying in at a rate of tens of millions bits
per second then the forward error correction circuits in the decoder do
not have much time to hang around.  This technology alone is a high
tech function that needs specially dedicated, fast integrated circuits.

But the fact that a digital receiver can correct lots of errors does
not provide any leeway for poor installations.  In analogue FM
transmission you get some warning that reception might be poor because
there is a relatively smooth slope as the signal becomes worse and the
sparklies appear on the screen.  With digital technology it is more
like a cliff-edge than a slope.  Once you reach the point where the
receiver cannot cope with the errors the whole process suddenly comes
to a halt without any real warning and that is much more disturbing
than a smooth onset of sparklies.  For that reason a good installation
has to provide a large margin above the point of failure so that signal
failure becomes a very rare event.

So far we have barely got past the first part of the decoder and we
have already encountered some exotic technology.

One transponder could be carrying eight or more programme services in
the "multiplex" or "transport stream" of data.  The next stage of the
decoder is called the de-multiplexer which picks out the particular
items that the viewer has chosen.  Assume the viewer chooses a
particular programme which will have a picture and stereo sound.  The
tables that are transmitted with the transport stream explain which
packet numbers belong to which programme so when the viewer selects say
Discovery then the demultiplexer might be told to find all the packets
labelled 72 for the vision and the packets labelled 24 for the sound.
The demultiplexer is like the signal box in a railway shunting yard
which sets the points to send some packets off to the vision circuits
and others off to the sound circuits but unlike a railway shunting yard
it can throw away all the packets it does not need.

Now things are much clearer because we have a stream of digital vision
signals and a stream of digital sound signals which belong to one
television service.

The vision packets go to the vision decompression chip and the next
article will look at all this and all the other components that go to
create a digital decoder.

HEAVENS ABOVE

37.5oW: Orion 1

Following last month's Channel One (UK) deal, Orion and NTL have bagged
another UK cable channel.  Perfor-mance - The Arts Channel is to
deliver to cable via this satellite too, using the NTL London uplink.
Black Entertainment Television starts digital transmission here for
cable distribution this year.

27.5oW: Intelsat 601

Temporary access to TCC and Discovery is now possible with a 1.2 metre
dish through much of Europe, the channels share 11055MHz horizontal,
Tp.  72A.  This is a feed into Thor, besides main Swedish at 6.65MHz
there are four soundtracks for Scandinavia, 7.02MHz Norwegian, 7.20MHz
Danish and 7.38MHz Finnish.  Transmissions are in clear Pal.  CMT
Europe's signal looks like it has improved.

3oE: Telecom 1C & 2C

Ariane Flight 81 did its job and Telecom 2C is already on station.
Transfer of Ku-Band services is imminent and the use of the new
horizontal Ku-Band transponders at this location.  The disappearance of
that old familiar Mulhouse Telecom 1 test-card, which has been with
Telecom viewers for at least the last six years, will herald the
operational use of the new generation Telecom satellite.  Telecom 2C is
also a military communications spacecraft as it has the Syracuse 2
system operating at 7/8GHz.  The actual launch from Kourou, French
Guiana, was at 2323GMT December 6.  Expect some digital transmissions
here.

5oE Tele-X & Sirius

Confirmation of the number of digital channels on Tele-X; Telenor has
two Danish channels, two Swedish channels and one Norwegian channel all
around 12322MHz.  Kinnevik has encoded the TV6 signal in D2 Mac.  TV3
and ZTV have just scrambled too.

10oE: Eutelsat II F2

Med TV had an off-day recently when the Smartcrypt from the feed
channel ended up on the main output.  Med TV has claimed that attempts
to disrupt its signal were made recently.  It is not clear if the
uplink to this satellite or the feeds between sites were the target.
Nor is it clear if there really was a deliberate attempt to jam a
satellite transponder, which would be a first in Europe, although there
have been many accidental instances.  London, that unlikely haven of
clandestine TV, has a new potential visitor; Serb TV is the next
station to try to gain a UK uplink licence, much to the probable
embarrassment of the UK Government.  The studios will be in Paris.  A
feed into TV2 Denmark used 11163MHz horizontal.

13oE: Eutelsat II F1 & Hot Bird 1

Latest arrival, in clear Pal with stereo at 7.02/7.2 and slightly low
level audio is Onyx, a long expected fifth German music channel.  It
airs 18 hours a day with a mix of music to appeal to a more mature
audience.  11146MHz is the frequency, trans-ponder 22A.  Auto-noumus
Televisao de Catalunya has appeared again, last seen at 11492MHz
vertical, transponder 14.  The audio feed of BBC World Service on NBC
Super Channel 7.38 MHz is now WRN2 with Vatican Radio.  A rather small
media player, the sole 12GHz broadcaster on this satellite, AB1 Channel
of France, is the beginning of yet another, French digital channel
package, this is the seventh to be announced.  The transponder may
still be able to preempted by other users, as a feed for Reuters was
noted.  Polonia 1, which retreated to the upper half of Tp.34 on this
satellite when legal pressure forced it off terrestrial transmitters,
is re-launched in the market with more sports and music.  TRT on
11818MHz is now accompanied by an FM Turkish radio on 7.02/7.2 MHz.
Tp.45, 11542 MHz is earmarked for Italy's Telepiu to compress six TV
channels.

16oE: Eutelsat II F3

Telepace, the channel from Vatican TV has had some extended programming
lately and may be expanding.  This is a good satellite for feeds;
11163MHz can be quiet but saw a TF1 feed from the Russian capital.
After 1800GMT that channel is used by Thaiwave, the DM56 per month
channel.  It feeds into BT London from Bangkok via an Intelsat feed.
Its future scrambling system is not settled.  The schedule is planned
to be 1800-2300 GMT, starting at 1400 at weekends but has yet to
materialise.  It is presently Mon, Wed, Fri, Sat & Sun from 1800-
2000GMT.  11638MHz is used for feeds sometimes and 12542MHz is active
too.  Apna TV has not been seen again on this satellite, nor Ku-Band
Gorizont.

19.2oE: Astra 1A, 1B, 1C, 1D & 1E

More MPEG-2 tests are being seen above 11700MHz from Astra 1E and some
digital tests used Astra 1D as well.  Actual broadcasts from ARD and
ZDF have started being up-linked from Betzdorf to 11836MHz horizontal.
Canalsatellite of France has left Astra 1D tests behind and settled on
Astra 1E transponders 66, 11739MHz vertical and Tp.70, 11817MHz
vertical.  On 11953.5 and 11993MHz, transponders 77 and 80 are being
used by Nethold.  Beacon frequency for the satellite is 11202 vertical
and 10948.5MHz horizontal and it is actually at 19.15 degrees East.
The channels and video being shown on most of the above frequencies
change frequently, while there is no audience.  Although Astra 1E is
going to have a slow start, Astra 1F is due to launch next month.
Rival Hot Bird 2 does not fly until October.  A new name for Tp.  11
FilmNet Plus on Astra, it is now FilmNet 1.  Daytime Tp.  49 110714 MHz
horizontal is filled by 11 hours of Nickelodeon Germany, Arte uses the
evening slot.  Arte also shares with La Cinquieme on 13 degrees East
and five degrees West.  New to Astra 1D is Tp.  61 Home Order
Television, German tele-shopping with an uncluttered screen.  The
channel is due to move to Astra 1E this year.  America One radio
launched as expected on 11538MHz at 7.74MHz with some shared
programming with WRN1 on 7.38MHz.  On Pro 7, Star*Sat Radio and Radio
Ropa have ceased analogue transmission and gone ADR, where Germany
leads the way.  The ADR versus analogue score is 53 analogue against 40
digital, not counting the DMX channels.

48oE: DFS1 Kopernikus

This satellite has gone walkabout twice in recent months.  The first
amble was in late November, the second in mid-December.  The satellite
formerly known as Kopernikus 1, once a full TV satellite, seems to be
potential space junk.  Using the beacons to track it, it was last
tracked moving East, a long way from the supposed 33.5 degrees East
home.  The satellite may never now return to anything near operational
use.
