<P><A HREF="http://www.whitneyfarm.com/dirt/issue1.htm">Last month's</A> feature was on trees.  Due to space limitations, some content had to be left out.  This month, however, we've expanded, and thus present:</P>
<BR>
<BR>
<A NAME="tree"></A><H2>MORE ON <A HREF="http://www.whitneyfarm.com/palm.htm">TREES!</A></H2>
<H4>To stake or not to stake?</H4><B>
<P>Contrary to popular opinion, it is generally better not to stake a tree. A recent study at Michigan State University showed that staking trees often results in long and leggy growth with thin and weak stems. Unstaked trees develop better root systems and more dense and compact growth. In areas where wind may be a problem, or if the tree starts to lean, the trunk should be attached loosely to the stake. An old nylon stocking makes a great flexible tie. If possible, use a flexible stake. Some movement is necessary for the tree to build a strong trunk and sturdy root system. After one year, the stake and ties should be removed, to prevent damage to the tree from the tie.</P>
<P>Studies have also clearly shown that the old recommendation to prune the shoots to match the roots is also misguided.  The old theory:  Reduce the leaf surface to lessen transpiration and accommodate the reduced root system, and the plant would better survive transplanting.  New theory:  Research has shown that the shoots and leaves provide the plants with the photosynthetic surface to produce the nutrients required for good root growth.</P>
<P>Finally, be sure to keep your new tree well watered during dry spells. In most areas, an inch of <A HREF="http://www.whitneyfarm.com/water.htm">water</A> per week is all that is required. Ideally, water the whole planting area­not just the area near the trunk­so as to encourage the growth of a vigorous root system.</P>

<A NAME="annuals"></A><P><H3>Just as you read about our favorite roses, here we present our picks on annuals.</H3></P>
<I><B>Peter Hershey:</I></B>  Choosing my favorite annual flower-Poached Egg Flower- was easy because I only grow a few. My family's garden consists mostly of perennials, small trees, flowering shrubs plus a vegetable garden.</P>
<P>Poached Egg Flower,also known as Meadowfoam, bears the scientific name Limnanthes douglasii.  It can be found at nurseries with good selections of native plants or specialty seed suppliers.
Poached Egg Flower is an apt name.  The profuse flowers have a bright yellow center surrounded by pure white.  The foliage is a bright green, about the color and texture of parsley.  The plant looks good enough to have for Sunday brunch.  However, this is one tough plant that will thrive despite heavy soil, overwatering and light frost.</P>
<P>Meadowfoam reseeds readily, yet will not become an pest.  In a natural garden setting it is a welcome and underused treasure.</P>
<I><B>Sylvia  Carlton-Cordaro:</I></B><BR>
Impatiens or Petunias?<BR>
Impatiens grow in shade, they're bold, easy and reliable, and cheer up woodsy places.<BR>
<P>But petunias come in rainbows of colors and will grow anywhere in full sun, spilling out of baskets, mounding out of borders. Let's see, petunias or impatiens'?</P>
<P><I><B>Kevin Loomis:</B></I>  Of the many annuals to choose from it is very difficult to choose a favorite! There are so many that have such specific uses. Some for heat tolerance, some for shade, some as dramatic specimen plants and others as wonderful companions mixed in containers. There is one, however, that I have always liked and used a great deal, which has earned a new special place in my garden. That annual is trailing Lobelia.</P>
<P>Last year, trailing Lobelia seeds (apparently from containers in my gardens the previous year) self-sowed at random throughout my garden. Because of the light, almost airy growth habit of trailing Lobelia the effect was better than anything I could have planned. Beautiful light blues, lavenders and whites wove gently through and around perennials, roses, or whatever they happened to encounter. This year I will try to achieve similar results by scattering trailing Lobelia seeds throughout my gardens.</P>
<I><B>Chris Totten:</B></I>  Agrostemma, or Coneflower;  This beautiful wispy plant grows sturdily to a height of about three feet. the purple flowers unfurl as they bloom. It makes a great cut flower never failing to add character to a mixed bouquet.</P>
<P><I><B>Brenda Sage:</I></B>  Sweet pea is my favorite annual flower because it provides plenty of fragrant bouquets all summer long.</P>

<BR>

<P>From time to time, <A HREF="http://www.whitneyfarm.com/dirt.htm">The Dirt</A> will print a roundup of various employees' favorite plants relevant to the appropriate season.</P>
<P><I><B>Chris Totten:</I></B>  Madame Alfred Curriere.  This amazing climber has a beautiful white bloom with a faint peach blush as at opens. The fragrance is unbelievable. It is very vigorous, and blooms profusely in the spring and fall. In Portland, it will continue blooming well into the fall, finally giving up with the onset of freezing weather.</P>
<P><I><B>Brenda Sage:</B></I>  Graham Thomas, a David Austin English rose, is my favorite because it is vigorous, with true yellow flowers. It is fragrant and very disease-resistant.</P>
<P><B><I>Sylvia Carlton-Cordaro:</I></B>  Although it¹s a lanky rose, Gertrude Jekyll has pretty pink flowers that allure me. Then I can't keep my nose out of the blossoms the rest of the day.</P>
<P><B><I>Norm Ross:</B></I>  American Beauty, because it was a Grateful Dead album cover; Bob Hope because of the memories; and Blazer, because I went to every one of the Portland Trailblazers' 1977 playoff games. (Norm likes basketball -Ed.)</P>
<P><B><I>Kevin Loomis:</I></B>  My favorite rose is a budded shrub variety Floribunda named Bonica. Bonica displays masses of clear pink, ruffled and heavily petaled 2-3 flowers all summer, above glossy medium green foliage. It has a light, sweet fragrance and I have found it to be highly disease and insect resistant. Bonica's fragrance and contrast in flower and foliage color make it especially nice for a prominent position near a favorite evening sitting area.</P>
<P><P><B>Peter Hershey:</I></B>  After the severe winter the Pacific Northwest gardeners just endured, my choice for favorite rose is clear.  Of the disease resistant varieties we grow one stands out for hardiness and vigor -Rosa rugosa.  It is the only one of 10 rose bushes that survived the February freeze unscathed.  The others survived, but with extensive dieback because they had already come out of dormancy after the mild temperatures beforehand.</P>
<P>Rosa rugosa is available in several color and form varieties.  They all have attractive crinkly foliage and produce large orange-red fruit, called hips, that are a good source of vitamin C, and sometimes used in preserves.</P>

<A NAME="sammy"></A><H2>So long, Sammy!</H2>
<P>After eight years with us, Sam Rodriguez has left to go on to new opportunities.
Sam performed a number of important jobs for us including warehouseman, forklift operator, and stacker.  But Sam was most famous for his work as a sealer on our bagging line.  Adeptly keeping pace with any number of different fillers (the employee who actually loads the empty bag onto the line for filling) over the years, Sam helped to set production records year after year.  He could keep up with the best fillers we ever had, and was always ready to step up the pace another notch.  He was also famous with his fellow crew members for the delicious burritos he would sometimes bring to work.</P>
<P>We want to thank Sam for his many years of dedicated service to the Garden Grow Co. and wish him all the best in the future.  We will all miss him.  The good news is, his brothers Severo and David are still with us working in our warehouse.</P>
