(WSJ):U.S. Hewlett-Packard Lobbies Govt For Encryption Plan<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
  SAN FRANCISCO (AP-DJ)--Hewlett-Packard Co. is pushing an unusual scheme to<br>
protect electronic transactions around the world without running afoul of <br>
U.S.<br>
export laws, Wednesday's Wall Street Journal reports.<br>
<p>
  The Palo Alto, California, computer maker said it's been lobbying <br>
government<br>
agencies for more than a year to gain support for its proposal, which uses a<br>
data-scrambling technology to protect transactions from tampering or theft.<br>
<p>
  Strong encryption technologies ordinarily fall under tough export rules <br>
that<br>
limit technologies which could impede U.S. wire-tapping capabilities, a <br>
source<br>
of continuing friction between the government and high-technology companies. <br>
<p>
<p>
  H-P, in a plan developed with the French company Gemplus SCA, wants to <br>
split<br>
the code-making technologies into two pieces that would be approved under<br>
different government standards.<br>
<p>
  One device, which could fit in a standard computer, would contain a basic<br>
encryption capability that is designed to be broadly exported without the <br>
need<br>
to seek a separate export license for each foreign user.<br>
<p>
  That device, dubbed an encryption engine, would be useless without the<br>
addition of another tiny piece of hardware that contains a code-making <br>
formula<br>
set at a specific strength. The second device, called a policy card, would <br>
be<br>
separately reviewed by the U.S. State Department for each customer.<br>
<p>
  Government agencies, including codebreakers at the National Security <br>
Agency,<br>
would still have a say over the strength of encryption exports.<br>
<p>
  But customers could build commercial applications around the proposed<br>
encryption engine, knowing that it will work with any code-making formula <br>
that<br>
governments might adopt in the future.<br>
<p>
 Now they risk that their work will become obsolete amid policy changes in<br>
Washington and other countries.<br>
<p>
  State Department officials weren't immediately available for comment. <br>
Stewart<br>
Baker, a former NSA general counsel who now practices law in Washington, <br>
D.C.,<br>
termed the H-P plan a clever answer to the problem of shifting government<br>
policy.<br>
<p>
  "There was a lot of skepticism when H-P first proposed it," said Lynn <br>
McNulty,<br>
a former encryption specialist at the National Institute of Standards and<br>
Technology. "But it looks to me that they are well on the way to the next <br>
step."<br>
<p>
<p>
  Doug McGowan, an H-P manager involved with the project, said he expects to<br>
receive U.S. approval by 1996 to begin shipping the encryption engine freely <br>
to<br>
Western Europe and Canada.<br>
<p>
  H-P's plan fits some of the NSA's objectives. For one thing, its <br>
technology<br>
embeds encryption technology in microchips that can't easily be modified by<br>
computer hackers.<br>
<p>
  H-P's policy cards also could be adapted for a controversial Clinton<br>
administration proposal called key escrow, in which mathematical keys to <br>
break<br>
codes could be stored for later use by law enforcement or intelligence <br>
agencies,<br>
McGowan said.<br>
<p>
  The plan complements a parallel H-P effort to develop a new generation of<br>
"smart" data cards to let consumers buy goods and services around the world<br>
electronically. Gemplus, a huge supplier of credit and debit cards in <br>
Europe, is<br>
supplying technology to that effort along with Informix Corp., a database<br>
software maker in Menlo Park, California.<br>
<p>
  Jeff Hudson, an Informix vice president, said the partners' proposed cards<br>
could store money and a database worth of personal information, such as <br>
medical<br>
records. That approach could eliminate the need to connect to multiple <br>
companies<br>
or agencies to manage such information, since it would be stored on each <br>
card,<br>
the companies said. <br>
