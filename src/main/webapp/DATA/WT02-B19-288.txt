<CENTER><H3><B>IDEA AMENDMENT WOULD LIMIT PART H IN THREE STATES<BR>
</CENTER></H3></B> <P>

Reston, VA -- The House Committee on Economic and Educational Opportunities will
be marking up (discussing and voting on) IDEA reauthorization tomorrow, May 23. We
have just been informed that the bill will include a provision authored by Committee
Chairman Bill Goodling of Pennsylvania that will significantly weaken Part H (early
intervention) under IDEA. <P>

Specifically, this proposal would allow up to three demonstration states (which must
currently receive over $40 million and have substantial disparities in service levels
within the state) to explore ways to limit publicly funded early intervention services by
conducting demonstration projects on Part H.  This bill was negotiated by Pennsylvania
administration representatives, along with Rep. Goodling.  It just so happens that
Pennsylvania meets the restrictive criteria mentioned above.<P>

The amendment would allow these selected states to be exempt from two very
important mandates under the guise of *improving* "the quality of  services delivered to
infants and toddlers under this part, while controlling costs."  First, it allows the state to
*require* private insurance to pay for services up to $2,500.  Second, it allows the state
to "establish limitations on the duration and frequency of early intervention services,"
regardless of the needs of the child.<P>

Families need their private health insurance to pay for health care.  They should not be
forced to exhaust their annual benefits for a particular service or worry about exceeding
life-time limits in order to access appropriate early intervention services for their child. 
Many families already use their insurance to supplement early intervention services. 
Moreover, the use of existing health insurance coverage for early intervention services
would cause families to incur additional financial burdens due to copayments and
deductibles. <P>

There is no telling what the impact of this amendment could be. One thing is for sure, it
will not be positive!  If passed, it is certain to catch the attention of every state!<P>

Since Mr. Goodling is the Committee chair, the amendment will carry great weight. Only
a strong bipartisan opposition will defeat it.<P>

The Part H Demonstration Project must be defeated!!  Call, e-mail, and fax YOUR
REPRESENTATIVE on the House Economic and Educational Opportunities Committee
(see list below) and CHAIRMAN GOODLING immediately!!!. They can all be reached
by calling the Capitol Switchboard at 202/224-3121 and asking to be connected to their
office.  In addition, family advocates have set up a toll-free number to the Capitol
Switchboard.  That number is 800/962-3524.  Our message is simple:<P>

<ul><li> Oppose the Part H Demonstration Project proposal<p>

<li> Families of infants and toddlers must not be forced to use their private
insurance<p>

<li> Duration and frequency of services should be determined by the needs of a
child</ul><P>

While you're at it, tell your Representative not to do anything that would weaken IDEA
or hurt children and families.  IDEA is a good law which only needs fine tuning; not
gross overhaul.<P>

Thanks for your help in this critical matter!!!<P>
