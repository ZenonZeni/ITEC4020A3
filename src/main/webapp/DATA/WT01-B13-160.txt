When assessing the return of your mutual fund investment, you must
consider it in context of the markets in which the fund strives to
perform.
<P>

The most widely quoted measure of the performance of the financial
markets is the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Unfortunately, "the Dow"
may provide very little insight on how your mutual fund investment is
progressing. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is a group of 30 blue chip
industrial stocks. 
<P>

More useful to you will be the performance of the particular index -- an
unmanaged group of similar investments -- that your mutual fund uses as
a benchmark for its investment objective. 
<P>

Comparing your fund against its index can be enlightening. Note, though,
that a fund's return will depend upon its specific investments. To
understand why your fund outperformed or underperformed its index, it
may also be helpful to compare the composition of your fund's portfolio
with the composition of the index over the same period of time.
Significant performance differences may arise if your fund and the index
were invested in different companies and industries throughout the
period. Other factors, such as cash flows in and out of a fund and fees
and expenses, may affect the relationship between fund performance and
the index.
