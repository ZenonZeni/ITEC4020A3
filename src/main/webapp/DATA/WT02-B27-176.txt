<P><A NAME="ssv"></A><B><FONT SIZE=+2>PRESS&nbsp;RELEASE 21 Nov 1996 Prof
S McLean Study: Sometimes a Small Victory</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Major new academic study concludes that arguments in favour
of physician assisted suicide outweigh those against</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Medics supporting a change in the law outnumber those
against</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Public would prefer doctors to take the final action at
the patient's request, but doctors favour the patient taking the final
action</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>New surveys support a change in the law - a Bill proposed</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Cautious Bill with extensive safeguards</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Chris Docker of the Scottish Voluntary Euthanasia Society
said: &quot;This is the first time the subject has been examined in such
depth in the UK. We are very heartened by the results. It provides politicians
with the ammunition they need to approach such issues responsibly, and
reach a compassionate response when all palliative options have been exhausted.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>***********************************************</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Glasgow University: Glasgow University's Institute of
Law &amp; Ethics in Medicine today released the results of its year-long
intensive study into the pros and cons of the physician-assisted suicide
debate. The Report, called Sometimes a Small Victory, which is over 200
pages long, includes a thorough examination of the relevant legal, medical
and ethical dilemmas, together with two surveys that reveal current feelings
of the public at large and also within the medical profession.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Concluding that people wish to see the issues debated
and many would welcome legal change, the report includes a draft Bill which
the researchers call a &quot;legislative template&quot; for moving forward.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Highlights: The Report disagrees with the House of Lords
Select Committee on Medical Ethics, and says: &quot;...the arguments against
legislation are not of sufficient weight to tip the scales against the
arguments in favour, but they must be accorded consideration in the drafting
of any legislation which would produce change. This is no easy task, but
one which must be undertaken.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Surveys:  When asked preferred methods, 42% preferred voluntary
euthanasia and 28% assisted suicide (22% had no preference). In a separate,
postal survey of UK medical practitioners and pharmacists, 54% were in
favour of a change in the law to allow physician-assisted suicide to take
place in specific circumstances, with only 36% against. 60% of the 1000
practitioners who responded had treated a patient who was considering suicide,
12% personally knew another health professional who had assisted a patient
to kill themselves and 4% had themselves provided the means (such as drugs
or information about lethal acts) to assist a patient to kill themselves.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>One interesting finding of the second study was that most
medical practitioners found physician-assisted suicide preferable to voluntary
euthanasia (43% in comparison to 19%), especially in view of the findings
in the first study which showed the public's preference for voluntary euthanasia.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>There was little by way of differences in the percentages
of hospital physicians, medical GPs, surgeons or psychiatrists favouring
a change in the law - approximately 48% were in favour. This was in stark
contrast to the percentage of pharmacists in favour (72%) and anaesthetists
(56%). Pharmacists were twice as likely as medical GPs to endorse the view
that &quot;if a patient has decided to end their own life then doctors
should be allowed in law to assist.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Definitions: Assisted suicide: this is where the person
who wants to die takes their own life with the help of a doctor who provides
the means of death: i.e., a prescription for drugs. It is the action of
the person himself or herself which leads to their own death, at the time
and place of their choice. Voluntary euthanasia: this is where the person
decides they want to die and is helped to die by someone such as a doctor
or other medical staff, friends or family. It is the actions of the other
person that lead to death.</FONT></P>

<P><A NAME="bsa"></A><FONT SIZE=+2>PRESS&nbsp;RELEASE BRITISH SOCIAL ATTITUDES
the 13th report 1996-97 Edition</FONT></P>

<P>The latest findings of this authoritative annual survey of public attitudes
are published today. Produced by Social and Community Planning Research
(SCPR), Britain's largest social research institute, each year's book takes
an independent and impartial look at Britain's changing social values,
based on solid evidence from an annual national population survey.</P>

<P>Chapters in this latest report cover: the media's portrayal of sex;
family values; illegal drugs; national identity; euthanasia; tax and spending;
the flexible labour market; national divisions; Northern Ireland.</P>

<P>BRITISH SOCIAL ATTITUDES: the 13th report contains a wide range of findings
from the annual survey series carried out by Social and Community Planning
Research (SCPR), Britain's leading social survey institute. Conducted annually
since 1983, each survey comprises over 3,500 interviews with a representative
sample of people in England, Scotland and Wales. It is funded by charitable
and government sources and is widely regarded as the source of independent
and impartial information and commentary about Britain's changing social
values over the years.</P>

<P>BRITISH SOCIAL ATTITUDES: the 13th report is published by Dartmouth
Publishing Company on Thursday, November 21st 1996. It is edited by Roger
Jowell, John Curtice, Alison Park, Lindsay Brook and Katarina Thomson of
SCPR.</P>

<P>Chapter 8 Matters of life and death: attitudes to euthanasia by David
Donnison and Caroline Bryson</P>

<P>A fate worse than death Very few people in Britain are at either ends
of the debate over euthanasia, asserting either a person's right to die
at will or a prohibition against being able to opt for death regardless
of the circumstances. The vast majority fall somewhere in between, supporting
euthanasia in certain qualified circumstances. An overwhelming 82%, for
instance, would support a law allowing doctors to end the life of someone
with 'a painful incurable disease', up from 75% who took this view about
ten years ago. At the other extreme, only 12% think euthanasia should be
allowed by law for someone who is 'simply tired of living and wishes to
die'. A bare majority (51%) would legalise euthanasia for a person 'who
is not in much pain nor in danger of death, but becomes permanently and
completely dependant on relatives for all their needs'.</P>

<P>Does support vary with age? Young people are less likely than older
people to be religious, a factor strongly associated with views on euthanasia.
But, after taking differences in 'churchgoing' into account, the effect
of age on attitudes towards euthanasia disappears. So while older people
are, on the whole, less pro-euthanasia than the young, the data certainly
do not suggest that this is because they are closer to the age at which
matters of life and death begin to come more sharply into focus. Either
way, overall support for euthanasia is likely to continue increasing over
time as younger, less religious, cohorts replace their older, more religious
counterparts in the population at large.</P>

<P>Living wills Only 2% of the public have made living wills (which say
what doctors should do if one is incapable of making decisions for oneself),
but a further 12% of people say they have considered making one. More important,
perhaps, nearly three in four people believe that doctors should be allowed
to honour living wills and to end a person's life in the circumstances
they have laid out.</P>

<H2>PRESS RELEASE / COMMENT 25 Apr 1996 Janet Johnstone</H2>

<P>Scots law yesterday, in the historic ruling from Lord Cameron, which
allowed PVS patient Janet Johnstone to have a feeding tube removed so that
she could die in peace, took a step forward from its English counterpart.
<BR>
<BR>
Sheila McLean, international Bar Association Professor of Law &amp; Ethics
in Medicine at Glasgow summed it up thus: <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Coupled with the earlier statement from the Lord Advocate, that,
as a matter of policy, he would not prosecute doctors who remove nasogastric
feeding from patients in this condition if they have obtained the authority
of the Court of Session, doctors in Scotland can now be reassured that
their actions will attract neither civil nor criminal liability - assuming
court authorisation has been granted. In this, they are more fortunate
than their counterparts in England and Wales for whom the question of criminal
liability is less clear.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
The Scottish Voluntary Euthanasia Society welcomed the decision. Said Executive
Secretary Chris Docker: &quot;This must be an immense relief for the family.
SOciety needs to look at the whole range of decisions at the end of life
so that morals can catch up with medicine. 50 years ago we would not have
had such dilemmas; today, it is harder to know when enough is enough. We
also welcome the fact that tighter guidelines are being drawn up for the
diagnosis of persistent vegetative state. No-one wants plugs pulled when
there is any chance of any reasonable quality of life: we have to know
beyond all reasonable doubt.&quot; 
<HR><A NAME="lwvess"></A></P>

<H2>PRESS RELEASE (VESS) 20 Mar 1996 (Immediate Release) <BR>
Living Wills</H2>

<P>Although welcoming the attention given to living wills (advance directives)
by the Patients' Association and the BMA, The Scottish Voluntary Euthanasia
Society was cautious in its response. <BR>
<BR>
Said Executive Secretary, Chris Docker: <BR>
<BR>
Living Wills are an attempt to look at a tiny part of the problem of death
and dying in isolation from the real question of whether death is ever
preferable to life. Although there are advantages to making a living will,
there are many pitfalls, and we are not confident that the BMA and Patients'
Association's remit has adequately examined them. While it is admirable
that some attempts to give guidance on these tricky questions are being
made, there is still too great a tendency by most organisations to view
the question of living wills, that are essentially about personal moral
choices, as if they could be neatly wrapped up in medical and legal thinking.
<BR>
<BR>
The experience of other countries, notable the USA and Denmark, has shown
that much (seemingly) good theory on living wills has resulted in little
net benefit to the patient. If we really want to respect patient autonomy
we have to find a way that will work in practice, not just a neat idea
that everyone thinks should work. Our organisation has long experience
and a track record of research in this area yet we feel much more work
still needs to be done. <!--------------------------------------------------------------->
<HR><A NAME="lwvh"></A></P>

<H2>PRESS RELEASE (Living Will &amp; Values History Project) 20 Mar 1996
(Immediate Release) <BR>
Living Wills</H2>

<P>The BMA and the Patients' Association have recently released a Guide
for patients who wish to make &quot;living wills&quot; or &quot;advance
directives&quot;. These documents are to indicate refusal of treatment
in advance of incompetence. They cannot request treatment that would not
otherwise be offered and they cannot request active euthanasia. <BR>
<BR>
Evidence shows that living wills reassure many people that they will not
be &quot;overtreated&quot; or &quot;kept alive as vegetables&quot;. In
some cases, such as persistent vegetative state, such fears are perhaps
well-founded and a living will would make the job of doctors and the courts
a lot easier. <BR>
<BR>
Unfortunately, most people don't make living wills. Of those who do, most
are ignored, even though they are supported by common law. <BR>
<BR>
Responsible guidance on such documents can only be to the good, but society
needs to take a much deeper look at the problems of death and dying in
the modern world, and the problems of communication between doctor and
patient. Shallow reliance on living wills is like looking through the keyhole,
without sufficiently broad vision to find answers to the wide range of
problems, and without even a reliable key to unlock the door. <BR>
<BR>
The Living Will and Values History Project encourages the use of living
wills, but emphasises the crucial nature of dialogue with the doctor -
without which such documents may be rendered almost valueless. We strongly
encourage the use of non-medicalised forms such as &quot;values histories&quot;.
There is a strong trend to treat what is essentially a question of personal
values and personal ethics as if it were a medical matter; this is unfortunate,
but well designed living wills that emphasize patients' values and interests
could be very useful, especially if given greater weight in law (as proposed
in the English Law Commission's recent bill, for instance). <BR>
<BR>
People planning to make living wills should find out as much as they can
- such information-gathering could well include whatever advice the Patients'
Association can offer. <BR>
<BR>
The Living Will &amp; Values History Project supplies packs, at a nominal
charge to cover costs, which include the latest living will document, a
values history statement, stickers, wallets and other accessories, as well
as guidance for patients, lawyers and doctors. The documents are the result
of wide academic research over several years and have been warmly welcomed
in the field of medical law and ethics. <!--------------------------------------------------------------->

<H2>Government rejects living wills bill in its present form - Comment
by the Living Will &amp; Values History Project</H2>

<P><BR>
18 Jan 1996 <BR>
</P>

<P>On Tuesday, the Lord Chancellor announced that the Government has rejected,
in its present form, the Bill by the law Commission on Mental Incapacity
that deals with Living Wills. He has said the Government will issue a consultation
paper. <BR>
</P>

<P>The Living Will and Values History Project would welcome a bill to
clarify the position of living wills but believes such a bill needs to
be more than mere window dressing. The Law Commission's proposals are admirable
in many ways but fail to take into account extensive evidence that shows
living wills are only signed by a few people and that most of those documents
are ignored by health care staff when the time comes. Studies also show
that proxies are unable to make decisions as the patients would have wished
and no allowance is made for this in the Law Commissions proposals. </P>

<P>Legislation that is ineffective will give people false reassurance.
Consultation which merely asks for a cross section of opinions stands
to fall from inattention to empirical research. </P>

<P>Greater steps need to be taken to ensure effective communication between
doctors, patients and proxies. One measure that would assist the process
would be encouragement of &quot;values histories&quot; - advance statements
that are more personal and far less medicalised than the majority of living
wills. There is no longer the in depth understanding of the patient as
a person that the traditional &quot;family doctor&quot; had time to develop.
Mechanisms must be implemented to ensure vital personal preferences are
known and respected. </P>

<P>Note to editors: 1.The Living Will and Values History Project was set
up in response to the alarming growth and proliferation of living will
documents that bore little correlation to academic and empirical data on
their usefulness or effectiveness. It collates, analyses and applies research
in this area and acts as an adviser and resource base, as well as publishing
its own document. It works on a non-profit basis.2. The Project has just
opened its own site on the Internet, providing on-line information and
some examples of documents. URL: http://www.citynet.co.uk/users/vess/lwvh.html

<H2>PRESS RELEASE 28 Dec 1995 (Immediate release) <BR>
Details of Web Activity</H2>

<P><B>Why has the Society started its own website?</B></P>

<P>We began using the web to get fast news ourselves on voluntary euthanasia
issues, particularly from the American site DeathNET. The Internet provides
much faster updates than any other medium, including television, and wider
coverage. We decided to maintain our own site firstly to provide a similar
presence with an emphasis on Scottish and UK current <I>right to die</I>affairs
- such as the Janet Johnston case in the Court of Session Edinburgh just
now, or the bill by the Law Commission covering living wills and currently
before Parliament; we also want to attract new members - particular from
the younger age-group - who will help to further the debate. We receive
dozens of student enquiries a month - many from schoolchildren who find
that euthanasia is now part of their humanities course, and from university
students in areas such as medical law. Many of these students have access
to the Internet, and the site allows us to provide them with a great amount
of information at hardly any cost. We have a strong research and liaison
base, and feel the way forward is not solely through campaigning with the
traditional methods of a pressure group. </P>

<P><B>Do you give out details of how to commit suicide on the Internet?</B>
That material is already there, but not from us. We <I>do</I> publish material
on how to die with dignity - it is the reason we originally came into being
(in 1980) - but we believe such information should not be generally available
to the public. There are tragic cases of emotionally distraught people
committing suicide after reading popular manuals from the library - we
will have no part in this, though people will find it before they find
us if that's what they're looking for: our information pages provide internet
links to the Samaritans, together with the warning that information broadcast
and published by irresponsible individuals is frequently unreliable.</P>

<P>Before anyone can apply for our booklet, they must provide documentary
evidence that they have been a member of a right to die organistaion for
a minimum of three months: it doesn't have to be ours - the booklet is
produced on a non-profit basis. There are other restrictions, and we only
issue it in accordance with clear ethical and legal guidelines. In some
countries they are even more strict: in Germany, where they have sold over
10,000 copies in translation, the waiting period is 12 months.</P>

<P>In a country where no-one can ask a doctor to legally perform euthanasia
if everything else is hopeless, having such information gives hundreds
of individuals a sense of security about the the period before death. Most
people who purchase the booklet will never use it, but it is like having
the key to the door marked <I>Exit</I>. </P>

<H2>Responses to the above press releases</H2>

<P>The Times produced a cartoon of a computer with &quot;Game Over&quot;
and the heading &quot;Deathly Hush Falls on the Internet&quot; the Liverpool
Daily Post reported &quot;End Gets Nearer on the Internet&quot; a great
number of local and national papers reported our presence with phrases
such as &quot;Death on the Internet&quot;, &quot;The Dying Internet&quot;
and &quot;Scottish Group Spreads Euthanasia on the Internet&quot;.</P>

<P>Executive Secretary Chris Docker said: &quot;This is the fastest response
the Society has ever seen on such a scale. Within three hours of circulating
a press release on Bank Holiday Boxing Day we had achieved four media interviews.
Death on the 'Net is obviously of interest to a lot of people.&quot;
