<B>MNR Declares Restricted Fire Zone
For Most Of Northern Ontario</B>

</CENTER><P>
A Restricted Fire Zone (RFZ) will be in effect across all of northwest and parts of northeast Ontario starting at noon today.<P>

"The fire situation is reaching extreme levels and is now affecting most of Northern Ontario," said Natural Resources Minister Chris Hodgson. "We are introducing the RFZ to reduce the risk of person-caused fires at a time when there are increasing demands on our fire fighting resources."<P>

The RFZ covers all of northwestern Ontario and, in the east, all lands north of a line running from the Quebec border just south of New Liskeard and running through Gogoma, Chapleau, and Wawa, and south of the Albany River.  For the exact boundaries of each of these areas, the public should call their local MNR office.<P>

"The situation is not as critical in the east as it is in northwestern Ontario, but the high number of lightning starts, combined with high winds and continuing hot, dry weather are forcing us to take preventative measures across most of the north," Mr. Hodgson said.<P>

Currently, there are 249 active fires in Ontario, most of them in the northwest, involving  approximately 31,200 hectares of forest lands.<P>

Under the RFZ regulation, all burning permits are suspended and all open fires are prohibited, including campfires.  The regulation does permit the use of a portable stove or charcoal installation but the public is asked to exercise caution.<P>

"With the Forest Fire Weather Index reaching extreme levels, we need the public's cooperation to ensure that no new fires are started in and around forest areas," added Mr. Hodgson.
