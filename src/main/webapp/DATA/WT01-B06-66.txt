What Investors Should Know About Financial Statements </H2><P>
<HR>

"Financial statements are like fine perfume; to be sniffed but not swallowed."--Abraham Brilloff<p>


Most people assume that the production of a financial statement is an exact science and that the numbers are cut-and-dried. This is not true. As surprising as it may seem, the same set of facts about a company's transactions and operations can lead to quite different values for earnings, assets, and liabilities. Writing financial statements involves a variety of assumptions, estimates and choices about how values are reported. Uncritical acceptance of financial statements can end up causing bigger headaches to investors than those produced when they are carefully read.<p>


Understanding financial statements means learning a little of the language in which they are written. That language is accounting, the language of business. Familiar terms have more precise meaning when used in financial statements. For example, common usage associates assets with financial strength. This is not always the case. Some banks and savings and loans that recently trumpeted their massive assets are now in the hands of the regulators because their liabilities were even more massive. Assets, revenues, profits, and cash flows need to be evaluated in relation to other information contained in financial statements.<p>


Three financial statements tell managers, creditors, and investors about the financial health of a business: the balance sheet, the income statement, and the cash flow statement. The balance sheet presents the current financial condition of the business. The income statement summarizes profit performance over a specified period. The cash flow statement reports the movement of cash into and out of the company for the year.<p>

<br>
<H3>The Balance Sheet</H3><p>


The balance sheet lists the accounting value of a firm's assets, liabilities, and net worth as of a particular date. It is a snapshot of the firm's financial condition at the close of an accounting period. Although it is sometimes called the Statement of Financial Position or the Statement of Financial Condition, the name Balance Sheet describes an important characteristic: The assets of a firm balance the liabilities and shareholders' equity.<p>


Balance sheets follow a fairly standard format. Various accounts are placed in standard classes and presented in order. The example in Table 1 shows the major asset and liability classes. Though the company in our example has no other assets, the example lists this class for completeness. Other assets can include securities held as long-term investments and intangible assets such as goodwill and patents. Companies that have no other assets usually do not list this class.<p>

<br>
The left side of a balance sheet lists assets--the things a firm owns and uses to conduct business. The right side lists the claims against the value of the assets on the left. Accountants and financial executives often use the left side as a synonym for assets and the right side as a synonym for liabilities and shareholders' equity. This can be confusing if, as frequently happens, the balance sheet in question is organized vertically, with assets first, followed by liabilities and shareholders' equity.<p>

<br>
<H3>The Income Statement</H3><p>


If a balance sheet is like a snapshot, an income statement is more like a movie. An income statement shows how resources were used over time to produce a profit or loss. Other names for an income statement are Earnings Statement and Statement of Operations. An income statement expresses the following relationship:<p>


Earnings = sales revenue - cost of goods sold - operating expenses + non-operating income - non-operating expense - taxes<p>


Most income statements will be similar in form and content to the example in Table 2. Information about the sales revenues, expenses, and income is listed first, so that the reader can assess the firm's performance in its major, ongoing activities. Income and expenses from secondary activities are summarized separately as non-operating income (expense) or other income (expense). However, there is no standard rule. Some companies combine all expenses below the gross margin line into a single amount that is subtracted from the gross margin to arrive at earnings.<p>

                                  ----------

Earnings                             $78,000

</pre>

<br>

Terminology can also vary. Sometimes earnings are called profits or income. Sales revenue might be called simply sales or revenues. Any of these terms might be preceded by net without changing their essential meaning.<p>


Most businesses report earnings using the accrual principle of accounting. This means that sales revenues and related expenses are recorded when they are earned and incurred whether or not cash has been received or paid. Accrual basis accounting includes credit sales in the revenue line on the income statement and records them as accounts receivable in the balance sheet. Similarly, both paid and unpaid expenses are recorded as expenses on the income statement. On the balance sheet, unpaid (accrued) expenses are listed under current liabilities. The accrual principle says that sales revenue should be recorded when it is earned and that expenses should be recorded when the goods and services that generate expenses are used. Accrual accounting results in the best measure of a firm's profitability and allows a fair comparison with previous periods.<p>

<br>
<H3>The Cash Flow Statement</H3><p>


Cash inflows and outflows are the heartbeat of a business. The cash flow statement tells how a company spends its money and where that money comes from. The cash flow statement is much like a summary of a firm's checking account. Cash inflows and outflows are put into three classes:<p>

<ul>
<li> Cash flows from operating activities--the cash impact of all profit-making activities.<p>


<li> Cash flows from investing activities--the cash impact of buying or selling long-term assets.<p>


<li> Cash flows from financing activities--the cash impact of transactions with lenders and shareholders.<p>
</ul>

While many income statements segregate operating and non-operating income, the cash flow statement does not recognize this distinction. Cash flows from operating activities include activities such as receiving dividends and interest, as well as paying interest and taxes, even though these activities might be reported in the non-operating income section of the income statement.<p>


There are two acceptable formats for the operating activities section. Both are easy to understand.  The direct method is a simple statement of cash received and disbursed. The indirect method starts with earnings from the income statement and adjusts for non-cash items. The remaining entries in the indirect method are changes between last year's balance sheet and this year's. At the bottom of the cash flow statement, the increase in cash ties last year's cash balance to this year's. I like the indirect method because it links all three financial statements. In the example later in this article, we will examine a cash flow statement done this way.<p>

<br>
<H3>Know What You Are Reading</H3><p>


So much for the descriptions of the basic financial statements. The real questions are: What can you do with the information, and what should you watch out for?<p>


A certified public accountant (CPA) is usually involved somewhere in the production of financial statements. An unwary reader might assume that CPA involvement constitutes a stamp of approval. CPAs can actually perform three different procedures related to financial statements: They can audit them, review them, or compile them. Each procedure results in a marked difference in the level of assurance it adds to the financial statements.<p>


Federal law requires the annual financial statements of a public company to be audited by an independent CPA firm. Quite a few people think this means that the CPA firm independently determines the earnings and financial condition of the company in question. This is not the case. The information in the financial statements is the representation of management.<p>


An audit is a detailed assessment of the accounting system, accounting principles, and financial reporting standards used to create the financial statements. The results of an audit allow the CPA firm to express an opinion about the fairness with which the financial statements as a whole present the firm's financial position, the results of its operations, and its cash flows. While an audit does not guarantee the accuracy of financial statements, it does add significant credibility to management's representations.<p>


A CPA can also perform a more limited process called a review. A review is far less than an audit, providing a CPA with a basis of information about the financial report. However, review procedures are not a sufficient basis for the CPA to give an opinion as to whether or not the financial statements present a fair picture. The best a CPA can do based on a review is state that he or she is not aware of any changes that should be made in the financial statements to bring them into conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.<p>


Audits and reviews are procedures independent CPAs perform on the financial statements prepared by the business itself. Many small firms need help preparing financial statements. Such a company may hire a CPA to compile the financial statements from its records. A compilation is useful to management in monitoring the firm's progress, but it does not add credibility to the financial statements.<p>


Audits are expensive. In many business situations, the increased credibility of audited statements is not worth the added cost. Many, perhaps most, of the financial statements you will run across will be unaudited. Be careful with these. A CPA review provides only limited assurance that the statements are free from material misstatement; a compilation provides no assurance at all.<p>

<br>
<H3>What Accounting Methods Are Used?</H3><p>


That's right, management chooses the accounting methods. Financial statements should conform to generally accepted accounting principles. If they have been audited, they probably will. But within these principles, management can often select from a number of equally acceptable accounting methods.<p>


Does this mean that management can manipulate the numbers? In short, yes. Choosing aggressive accounting methods can result in financial statements that maximize reported profits and the value of shareholders' equity. These statements might be just right for impressing a loan officer or a potential buyer.<p>


Using the same facts and different accounting methods, management can report lower profits. This can be useful if management wants to minimize income tax liability and contributions to profit-sharing pension plans. Lower reported profits can also reduce the pressure from labor unions for richer contracts and from shareholders for higher dividends.<p>


Two accounting methods are especially important: the method of measuring the cost of goods sold, and the depreciation method.<p>


The cost of goods sold is usually a company's biggest expense. The method used to determine this expense can have a dramatic effect on the bottom line. This might seem like a straightforward calculation, and it would be if product costs were constant. Since most firms replenish their inventories of goods as sales are made, changes in product costs complicate matters. Generally accepted accounting principles allow four basic methods of calculating costs of sales. Two are widely used: last-in, first-out (LIFO); and first-in, first-out (FIFO).<p>


When costs are rising, FIFO produces higher reported profits. On the other hand, since profits are taxable, many firms choose LIFO to reduce income tax expense. Once LIFO is chosen, it must be used until the end of the product's life cycle. Eventually, at the end of the cycle, the LIFO method catches up with FIFO. This is because LIFO values unsold inventory at the lowest possible cost. When this inventory is finally sold, it will create a one-time gain in comparison with FIFO. But until the last year of production, the FIFO method results in higher reported profits and greater asset values than LIFO.<p>


<br>
<H3>Depreciation</H3><p>


The accrual principle creates an interesting problem in accounting for assets such as buildings and machines. Suppose our company buys a machine for $10,000 cash and plans to use it for 10 years. If the whole cost is taken as an expense in the year of purchase, earnings will be much lower (all else being equal) in that year than in the remaining nine years. To minimize this distortion of reported earnings, part of the machine's cost is recorded as an expense in each of the 10 years. This process of allocating the original cost of long-lived assets to the periods that benefit from them is called depreciation. Depreciation for the period is recorded as an expense on the income statement. The same amount is added to Accumulated Depreciation on the balance sheet. Accumulated Depreciation is subtracted from the original cost of Property, Plant, and Equipment to arrive at the accounting value of this asset class.<p>


Many people find depreciation confusing because it is a non-cash expense. When our company spent $10,000 in cash to buy a $10,000 machine, it traded one asset for another of equal value. The only cash outflow was for the purchase of the machine. As the machine is used over its 10-year life, the accrual principle says that a portion of the purchase price should be recorded as an expense in each year, but these expenses do not represent additional cash outflows.<p>


According to generally accepted accounting principles, management should estimate the useful life of each asset and depreciate the asset over that period. Management's estimate of useful life can be highly subjective. In fact, different companies write off the same equipment over different time periods. Delta Air Lines depreciates its 727s over 15 years. Pan American estimates the useful life of its 727s at 25 years. This means that Pan Am's depreciation expense per plane is considerably lower than Delta's.<p>


Besides estimating the useful life of an asset, management also chooses the depreciation method. The most obvious way of depreciating the $10,000 machine discussed above would be to write off $1,000 per year for 10 years. This is known as the straight-line method. Management is free to use this approach but generally accepted accounting principles do not require it. Instead, management can choose one of several accelerated depreciation methods. These result in more depreciation expense early in an asset's life, and less later on.<p>


Management can even change depreciation methods. In 1984, IBM changed from accelerated to straight-line depreciation for certain assets. This change in accounting method boosted reported earnings by $375 million.<p>


Choices about depreciation and cost of goods sold can make a big difference in reported profit. Other accounting choices can be equally important, but these two will usually set the tone of a firm's financial statements. Companies that use long asset lives and FIFO are effectively signaling their intent to report profits and assets at the highest possible levels. Firms that choose LIFO and more rapid depreciation are holding profits down.<p>


<br>
<H3>The Fine Print</H3><p>


When management chooses accounting methods, it is effectively choosing the scale on which the facts about the firm's transactions will be weighed. The good news is that, under generally accepted accounting principles, management must tell us which methods it has used. This and other important information appear in the footnotes to the financial statements.<p>


Most of us view footnotes as supplementary information, to be read or not depending on our interest and inclination. In financial statements, footnotes are vital. They are an integral part of the financial statement. In fact, it is a good idea to study the footnotes first. That way, you will know about the firm's accounting choices and any changes in accounting policies when you read the numbers.<p>


Footnotes also disclose other important facts about a company's operations. These can include details about long-term lease liabilities, contingent liabilities, and pending lawsuits. Such disclosures can be as important as the numbers reported in the body of the financial statements.<p>


While generally accepted accounting principles require certain disclosures, there is no rule that footnotes must be clear. Many are not. When IBM changed its depreciation method in 1984, the footnote cited the vague justification of evolving changes in operations, maintenance costs and technology. Some footnotes use highly technical terms in legalistic sentence structures. These need careful reading.  Such footnotes can reveal important aspects of the financial story.<p>


<br>
<H3>Understanding Cash And Cash Flow</H3><p>


Cash is the first entry on the asset side of the balance sheet. Cash is cash, the stuff you use to pay debts. Obvious, you say. But it is amazing how often someone suggests dipping into retained earnings to solve the cash crunch at a financially distressed company. Retained earnings are not cash; they are part of stockholders' equity. They are claims against existing assets. You cannot spend retained earnings; you can spend cash.


Similar misconceptions surround cash flow. The cash flow statement summarizes a firm's true cash flows. The choice of accounting methods does not affect the cash flow statement except for the timing of income tax payments.<p>


In recent years, financial dilettantes and deal makers have added earnings and depreciation to derive cash flows from a company's income statement. Quite often, the rest of the conversation centers on how the cash flows calculated by this method can be used to pay interest on enough borrowed money to buy the business in question through a leveraged buyout.<p>


This formula approximates true cash flows in only a narrow set of circumstances, principally in businesses with stable operations. If they are applied to more dynamic businesses, they can encourage faulty judgments and imprudent investments.<p>


The example in Table 3 illustrates the importance of the distinction between this formula and true cash flow. Using the formula, earnings of $78,000 and depreciation of $36,000 produces a cash flow of $114,000. However, true cash flow from operations, $55,000, is less than half this amount. Most of the difference comes from increases in inventory and accounts receivable. The example is one of a growing company. Such firms often need larger inventories to support increasing sales. By the same token, some of the increased sales will be credit sales, increasing accounts receivable. Looking further down the cash flow statement, the company has invested a sizable amount in new equipment. The firm also borrowed money and sold more stock to raise cash.<p>

<hr>
<br>

The naive formula applied to the income statement implies substantial cash flow. The cash flow statement tells a different story. The firm's earnings are strong, but it must plow all its earned cash and more into the business to fund its strong growth.<p>

<br>
<H3>What About Fraud?</H3><p>


Auditors are very good at what they do. Very few fraudulent financial statements slip through, but it does happen. Frauds where two or more high-level managers collaborate to cheat the business and lie to the auditors are difficult to detect. Such frauds usually involve either manipulation of inventory and accounts receivable or related-party transactions.<p>


For instance, an investigative committee of MiniScribe's outside directors reported that the computer disk drive company's senior management had perpetrated a massive fraud on the company, its directors, its outside auditors, and the investing public. Among other frauds, MiniScribe generated false revenues by shipping disk drives to its own warehouses and booking the shipments as sales. Senior company officials also inflated assets by carrying large quantities of obsolete parts, scrap and defective disk drives in its inventory. The investigative committee also found that MiniScribe executives perpetrated a series of frauds directly on the auditors. In one case, senior company officials apparently broke into locked trunks containing auditors workpapers and changed inventory figures.<p>


Transactions between audited and unaudited companies with overlapping ownership can hide fraud from auditors. If firms are essentially members of a broader family of companies, intercompany transactions can obscure the financial status of any member. This type of fraud caused the 1985 collapse of ESM Government Securities Inc. ESM Government's financial statements were audited, but those of related companies were not. Fictitious transactions between the firm and its holding company, ESM Group Inc., allowed it to hide huge losses. The entire ESM family of companies had been insolvent for at least six years when a customer questioned a footnote on ESM Government's 1984 balance sheet. Further inquiries detected a fraud that cost customers and investors over $300 million.<p>


MiniScribe and ESM Government both had clean audits from reputable CPA firms. Often, lawyers and businessmen must work with unaudited financial statements. Unaudited statements may comply with generally accepted accounting principles. Or they may not. Honest and knowledgeable managers may prepare statements that contain honest errors. Dishonest managers can cook the books in any number of ways. Read unaudited statements cautiously, and ask management to clarify anything that seems out of the ordinary. Try to get independent verification of critical items. An experienced CPA or financial consultant can help spot possible problems, but even with this kind of help, relying on unaudited financial statements adds a risk to a transaction.<p>

<br>
<H3>THE BOTTOM LINE</H3><p>


As an individual investor scrutinizing a company as an investment possibility, your first priority should be to understand how a specific set of financial statements is put together, including the accounting methods chosen and any important disclosures. Once you have done this, make the following comparisons:<p>

<ul>
<li> How do the financial statements of the firm you are concerned about compare with those of other companies in the same industry?<p>


<li> Are asset lives longer than average for the industry? If so, maybe the firm is squeezing to report extra profit.<p>


<li> Is the ratio of accounts receivable to sales revenue higher than the industry average? If so, has the firm made adequate provision for uncollectible accounts? A number of publications provide industry data. These include the Moody's Manuals, Standard & Poor's Industry Surveys, and the Value Line Investment Survey.<p>


<li> Compare the firm's current financial statements with those from previous years. Are inventories and receivables growing much faster than sales? This could be a danger signal. Investigate further.<p>


<li> Are general and administrative expenses growing faster than profits? Maybe management is getting fat.<p>
</ul>

These are a few suggestions. The right comparisons will suggest themselves as you dig into the financial statements.<p>


Financial statements are not easy reading, but they are must reading for individual investors. The information in this article should give you a good start in analyzing financial statements. As you read more financial statements, you will add to your knowledge.<p>


And if you develop an educated nose, you will not swallow anything harmful.<p>
