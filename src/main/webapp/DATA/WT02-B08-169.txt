<P><B><A HREF="http://prizz.vtoy.fi/finnfusion/">FinnFusion</A> - Research
project of fusion power </B></P>

<P>One of the biggest projects of PrizzTech is <A HREF="http://prizz.vtoy.fi/finnfusion">FinnFusion</A>.
It aims on getting Finnish companies linked to international fusion power
projects. ITER is the most important international project in the field
of fusion energy at the moment. It is a joint project lead by EU, USA,
Japan and Russia. The objective of ITER is to demonstrate the scientific
and technological feasibility of fusion energy for the purpose of the future
power production. Fusion projects are at the edge of new knowledge and
the technology transfer is a very important part of success. Efforts are
made that Finnish industry would get planning and construction orders for
ITER-power plant by the work of PrizzTech. The project is carried out in
co-operation with Finnish technology companies, VTT (Technical Research
Centre of Finland) and universities.</P>

<P><B>Wind Power </B></P>

<P>The use of wind power as an energy source has been planned by the industry
and energy companies in Satakunta. An idea of a wind power plant was proposed
and PrizzTech got to find out its opportunities. The place of the plant,
technical solutions, finance and the meaning of wind power to Finnish industry
were studied first. There has also been efforts to find out if it's possible
to start a Finnish enterprise that would produce machinery for wind power.</P>

<P><B>FinnH2 - Development Project of Hydrogen Technology </B></P>

<P>PrizzTech is working on a project which explores the use of hydrogen
as an unpolluted energy source. Opportunities to make use of companies'
know how in hydrogen techology and link it to the projects of research
centers and industry are seeked in this project. </P>

<P><B>Reuse of industrial waste</B></P>

<P>Large-scale industry makes a lot of waste. Because of the new law about
waste it's more and more important to find out reuse for it. A project
of reused waste is organized and managed by PrizzTech. The other participants
in this project are Outokumpu Harjavalta Metals Ltd., Kemira Pigments Ltd.
and Imatran Voima Ltd. Meri-Pori Plant.</P>
