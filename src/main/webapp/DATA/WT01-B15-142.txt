Managing nuclear waste has become a multinational concern as more and more of the world’s electricity is generated by nuclear power plants.  To assure an exchange of information on nuclear waste management, cooperative programs have evolved among countries and various international agencies. The United States
Department of Energy (DOE) has bilateral  agreements with Belgium, Canada, the Federal Republic of Germany, France, Japan, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.<P>

The U.S. also is one of 113 members of the International Atomic Energy Agency, is a member of the Nuclear Energy
Agency of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (NEA/OECD), and cooperates with the
Commission of the European Communities.    Through  such cooperation, nations share the cost of nuclear waste disposal testing programs; exchange information, technology, and experience; and develop a  consensus to
improve confidence in the safety of each nation’s disposal system.<P>

<HR>

The U.S. bilateral agreements with Belgium, Canada, Japan, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom are primarily to
exchange information on waste treatment, packaging, and storage; radionuclide transport; transportation; environmental effects; and public acceptance.  The U.S. cooperated with Canada in an experimental program at the Underground Research Laboratory in Manitoba.  DOE exchanges information with Switzerland concerning testing at the Grimsel Pass Underground Research Laboratory.  The U.S. also cooperates in the development of disposal technology through participation   in NEA’s Stripa projects in Sweden.  In addition, DOE cooperated with the Federal Republic of Germany on in situ tests at the Asse salt mine from 1981-1987.<P>

France and the U.S. conduct technical workshops on low-level and transuranic waste management.  The United States participates with Brazil, Sweden, Switzerland,  and the United Kingdom in the Joint International Pocos de Caldas project, which is a natural analog study.  Briefings or technical information have been provided by the U.S. to Argentina, Brazil, Egypt, Italy, South Korea, Mexico, the Netherlands, the Philippines, Spain, and Taiwan.  DOE and the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) have participated with other countries in mathematical and computer code comparison projects to verify radionuclide transport computer codes, validate the underlying mathematical models, and determine  the adequacy of the models for real problems.<P>

<H2><B>International Agencies and Organizations</B></H2>
<HR>
DOE, NRC, and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency contribute to International Atomic Energy Agency
studies by providing technical experts and attending symposia. DOE also sponsors participation in the waste management committee of the Nuclear Energy Agency of the OECD.  In addition, the U.S. has a bilateral agreement with the Commission of the European Communities for waste disposal research.<P>


DOE also takes part in a number of multinational public information activities.  Participating countries exchange
information on respective program progress and public concerns.  The countries also undertake joint projects
such as the development of brochures and position papers which are published in several languages.<P>
