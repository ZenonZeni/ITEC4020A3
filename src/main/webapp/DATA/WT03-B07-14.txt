ESOP'S (Employee Stock Ownership Plans) have unique tax

ESOP'S (Employee Stock Ownership Plans) have unique tax
characteristics which make them an attractive ownership vehicle
for some firms. ESOP's are IRS approved retirement plans that
require investment in stock of the employer company. Because of
the organizational, tax, and financial complexities surrounding
ESOP's, implementation requires careful study. Since ESOP's
became popular in the mid-1970's, we have worked with firms of
all sizes to determine the advisability of establishing an ESOP.
This includes: Performing feasibility studies to decide whether
an ESOP is workable for a particular client; Determine if an
ESOP is the best alternative to meet the client's needs;
investigate the long term consequences of using an ESOP; explore
ESOP feasibility from every angle so that the implemented plan
will function smoothly and without unforseen liability to the
corporation.  (B)  13170

The best candidates for an ESOP BUYOUT have the following
characteristics: shares held by individual (non-corporate) owners__
non-union employees__good cash flow or borrowing base. Other
considerations: 1.) an ESOP transaction can be completed much more
quickly than a sale to a third party and will therefore increase
the volume of transaction. 2.) your fee can be structured according

In conjunction with, and through our Investor Database, we can
provide promising corporations with INVESTOR EQUITY OR DEBT,
ACQUISITIONS, MERGERS OR DIVESTITURES, STRATEGIC ALLIANCES, AND
ANY PREPARATORY FINANCIAL CONSULTANCY. Our primary focus, however,
is providing $1 MM- $10 MM investor equity to firms that show
$5 MM- $75 MM in sales, have at least a three year operating
history, and have solid management in place. Our fees are paid
only upon successful completion of a funded project.  (B)  13137

Company structures transactions between clients seeking to raise
capital through DEBT FINANCING OR THE SALE OF EQUITY. In
addition, we assist companies in the sale, acquisition, merger or
divestment of their assets or entire business. Affiliated with a
finance sourcing group headquartered in New York City. Have a
network and database of funding sources including venture
capitalists, commercial banks, pension funds, insurance companies
and a limited number of individuals. Fees are competitive with
major financial houses in the major cities in the United States.
All financing fees are payable out of the proceeds of any equity
or debt financing raised. If the funds are not received by the
company, we do not get paid. Our use of contingent fees obviously
means we are successful in a large number of the financings we
undertake. Since the expenses of the offerings are ours until
the financing materializes we are selective as to the companies
we accept as clients.  The minimum financing is $100,000. Startups
are generally acceptable as long as the principals have invested
a reasonable amount of financing in the company as well as "sweat
equity."  (B)  13136

Private Investment firm focused on providing EQUITY AND DEBT CAPITAL
TO GROWTH COMPANIES. Our firm seeks to invest between $500 M and
$5 MM in public and private companies with $2 to $20 MM in annual
revenues. Generally, we prefer to review companies which have some
sort of proprietary feature, whether it is a technology, brand name,
well defined distribution network, or a superior management team. At
the moment, one of our specific interests is manufacturers and
distributors of spare parts for industrial machinery. We look for
meaningful investment positions and input on key issues, i.e. exit
strategy, financings, and other non-operational issues. Most
desirable are opportunities in the Northeast region of the United
States. Finally, we typically avoid high-tech industries and
start-up ventures. In addition to providing funds for growth, our
firm seeks an active role in corporate development and business
strategies through consulting/advisory efforts and Board
representation. Our principals and associates have had considerable
success as entrepreneurs, investors and strategists. Corporations
have found our skills, backgrounds and contacts with Wall Street
to be valuable to their business-building processes.  13050
