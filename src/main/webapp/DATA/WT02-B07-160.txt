<h3>Transportation</h3>
<P>
<img align=left src="t.gif">oday, millions of cars powered by ethanol-blended fuels are on America's roads, and the number continues to grow. While ethanol's original use was as a gasoline extender, today ethanol is marketed as a high quality octane booster and oxygenate capable of reducing emissions and improving automobile performance. Ethanol-blended fuel sales represent over 11% of all automotive fuels sold in the United States.  Ethanol is a versatile fuel, used as a blend component, a feedstock for ethers and as a replacement or alternative fuel.<br>
<br>
<h3>Major Automakers Recommend Ethanol<br>
</h3>
<P>
Ethanol blends are approved under the warranties of all domestic and foreign automobile manufacturers 
marketing vehicles in the United States. In fact, the nation's top three auto-makers, Chrysler, Ford and General Motors, recommend the use of oxygenated fuels, such as ethanol, because of their clean air benefits.<br>
<br>
<h3>ETBE
</h3>
<P>
Clean Air Act requirements to make cleaner burning, reformulated gasoline (RFG) with lower volatility and fewer toxins have created an increased interest in ethanol-based ethers such as ETBE (ethyl tertiary butyl ether). ETBE is a chemical compound produced by reacting ethanol and isobutylene (a petroleum-derived by-product of the refining process). Relative to other oxygenates, ethanol-based ethers provide refiners with greater flexibility and economic advantages in making reformulated gasoline. ETBE has characteristics superior to other ethers including:<Br>


<img align=right src="transp1.gif">


<ul>
<li>low volatility
<li>low water solubility
<li>high octane value
<li>excellent distillation curve response
<li>large reductions in carbon monoxide (CO) and<br>
hydrocarbon (HC) emissions
<li>superior drive-ability
</ul>
<br>
<BR>
ETBE also enhances energy security by displacing more 
gasoline produced from imported crude, and reduces our dependency on imported methanol and MTBE sources for reformulated gasoline production.<br>
<br>
These combined characteristics establish ETBE as one of the most cost-effective means for refiners to reduce gasoline volatility. As federal and state air quality programs continue to require reductions in fuel volatility, the marketplace opportunities for ETBE will continue to grow.<br>
<br>

<h3>E-85/E-90/E-100 Fleets</h3>
<P>
<img align="right" src="transb.gif">
Provisions of the Clean Air Act of 1990 and the National Energy Policy Act of 1992 created significant new market opportunities for alternative fuels, by phasing in requirements for fleet 
vehicles to operate on cleaner fuels.<br>
<br>
In the United States, state governments are recognizing the economic, energy and environmental benefits of fuel ethanol. A number of Midwestern States operate as many E-85 vehicles (blend of 85% ethanol/15% conventional gasoline) as the federal government. Heavy duty vehicles are also being operated on blends of 90% ethanol (E-90) and 100% ethanol (E-100) in successful demonstration programs. In ten years as many as 5 million vehicles may be running on non-petroleum motor fuels.<br>
<br>
In Brazil, where ethanol has been used in blends with gasoline since 1939, the government mandated the production of neat-ethanol fueled vehicles in order to reduce its dependence on imported energy while providing value added markets for its sugar cane producers.  Today, there are more than 4.2 million ethanol-powered vehicles (approximately 40% of the total fleet of passenger vehicles) operating in Brazil.<br>
<br>
<h3>Biodiesel</h3>
<P>
Animal fats and vegetable oils are reacted with methyl or ethyl alcohol and sodium hydroxide (esterfication) to produce biodiesel (methyl or ethyl ester).  Alcohol ester can be made from many vegetable oils including soybeans, sunflowers, corn or palm.  Biodiesel can be used as a substitute for or blended with diesel fuel. The benefits of biodiesel fuels include:<br>

<ul>
<li>Biodiesel is organic and biodegradable.
<li>Biodiesel mileage and power performance are comparable to conventional diesel.
<li>Biodiesel is safer because it has a high flash point and does not produce combustible air mixtures 
under normal conditions.
<li>Biodiesel mixes easily and completely with conventional diesel fuel and requires no modifications 
to fuel systems.
<li>Biodiesel contains no sulfur so it does not create sulfur dioxide, a major source of acid rain, when combusted.
<li>Biodiesel burns clean because it contains oxygenates.  Smoke is reduced by 70% when biodiesel is burned as a pure fuel and 25% when burned as an 80/20 diesel/alcohol ester blend.
</ul>
<br>
Biodiesel is widely used in Europe and in some U.S. cities to meet air emission standards. The city of St. Louis, Missouri, operates a fleet of 164 buses on a biodiesel blend of 30% biodiesel and 70% diesel. Several research programs are underway on the growth and processing of safflower and rapeseed oils into biodiesel.<br>
