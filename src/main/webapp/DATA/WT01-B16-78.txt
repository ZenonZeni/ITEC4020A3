<P>
The use of radioisotopes in research centres, universities, industrial companies and in medicine results in a comparatively high volume of compressible or combustible substances such as plastic, paper and protective clothing, small metallic objects or crushed glassware, together with worn out or damaged equipment, metal components, air filters, debris and miscellaneous waste.  Accordingly, this type of waste is particularly characterised by a very heterogeneous composition, including a broad spectrum of materials, contaminants and specific activities.  Additional heterogenous radioactive wastes are produced from sources which do not directly involve radioisotopes, for example, particle accelerators. 
<P>
The radioactive waste from research, industry and medicine is either stored as primary waste or processed and packed according to its properties.  For immobilization, mainly cement and concrete are used.  For the packaging of the conditioned and unconditioned waste, drums are most often used.
<P>
This waste is not a very large proportion of total radioactive waste - in what used to be FR Germany it is about 3 per cent of the total and the use of radioisotopes in medicine contributes a minor share to this 3 per cent.  Important radionuclides are tritium, cobalt-60, carbon-14, americium-241, caesium-137 and iodine-121.  It can be classified as radioactive waste generating negligible heat.  However, there is a large number of establishments producing this waste, and for most of them, dealing with radioactivity is not central to their activities, so there is some potential for problems to arise, and effective regulatory control is essential.  The accident at Goiana in Brazil in September 1987, when a strongly radioactive caesium-137 source was removed from its protective housing in a teletherapy machine in an abandoned clinic, resulted in the deaths of four people and the generation of nearly 3500 cubic metres of radioactively contaminated waste.
