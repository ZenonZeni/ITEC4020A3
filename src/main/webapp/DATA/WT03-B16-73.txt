<h1>Level 1A</h1>
<hr>
<center><table width=100% border=5 cellpadding=10 ><tr><td><STRONG>This is a raw image data level where detector normalization only is performed in each spectral band. This level is normally selected by users wishing to obtain information that has undergone the least possible processing</STRONG>.</td></tr></table><P>
The image appears as a square, leading to a panoramic effect for oblique viewing, as the number of pixels remains constant while the East-West image size varies according to viewing angle.<P>
<hr>
<table cellspacing=20><tr valign=top><td><H3>Corrections</H3></td><td>
No geometric corrections are performed. Only detector normalization is performed using a linear model which equalizes the difference in sensitivity between CCD detectors (Coupled Charged Detectors).<P>

These basic corrections are systematically performed on all SPOT data.</td></tr>

<tr valign=top><td><H3>Use</H3></td><td>
This preprocessing level is used in particular for stereoplotting and detailed radiometric studies. Stereopairs are available and usable at this level.</td></tr>

<tr valign=top><td><H3>Image size</H3></td><td>
Level 1A products can be supplied as full scene or as quarter scene. 
The image is not resampled.<P>
The volume is constant and comprises (for a full scene) 6000 lines each 
containing 6000 pixels in panchromatic mode, and 3000 lines each containing 
3000 pixels in each band of multispectral mode, irrespective of the viewing angle.</td></tr>
