<P>
Many physical, chemical and biological factors can potentially affect growth and
survival rates during the larval and juvenile stages of marine fish. My research
focuses on biological and physical factors that limit or alter larval fish
growth and development. This information is critical for understanding variable
survival in natural populations and for maximizing production in aquaculture
systems. Current research using this approach includes several studies designed
to decipher trophic interactions of larval fish, identify ontogenic changes in
nutritional requirements, and explore biochemical techniques useful for
determining physiological condition. 
</P>
<P>
Specific research projects include investigations of: 1) the influence of
salinity on feeding rates, development of osmoregulatory ability, and the
significance of free amino acids during osmotic adjustment, 2) the role of
microbial ecology in culture systems and microbes as a source of exogenous
enzymes for larval digestion, 3) lipid requirements with specific interest in
long chain fatty acids, 4) reproduction, larval growth, transport and
recruitment of Caribbean coral-reef fish, and 5) dynamics of larval fish visual
predation on zooplankton.
