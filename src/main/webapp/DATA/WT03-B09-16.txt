LOBBYING ORGANIZATIONS PUT UNDER FEBRUARY 14
DEADLINE TO COMPLY WITH NEW REGISTRATION LAW

     Lobbying organizations are under a February 14 deadline to
identify their lobbyists and disclose their legislative or
regulatory interests under a new law which took effect January 1.
     Also, lobbyists who were active during the fourth quarter of
1995 are required to file activity reports, even though the law
requiring them has been repealed.
     The 1946 Federal Regulation of Lobbying Act was repealed on
January 1. Thus, its repeal didn't affect the quarterly activity
report for the period that ended on December 31.
     In a joint statement published in the December 22 edition of
the Congressional Record, Secretary of the Senate Kelly D.
Johnston and Clerk of the House Robin H. Carle said all lobbying
organizations must register under the new law.
     While individuals and lobbying organizations that were
registered under the old law must file a final quarterly activity
report, registrations under the old law are no longer valid.
That's because the new law's disclosure requirements are
different from those contained in the old law. Moreover, the new
law shifts the registration and reporting requirement to lobbying
firms and lobbying organizations.
     "All lobbyists active after January 1, 1996, must register
under the new Lobbying Disclosure Act," Johnston and Carle said.
The February 14 registration deadline, they added, applies "to a
lobbyist who has a retainer agreement with a client in effect on
January 1, 1996."
     A new registration form was to have been released on January
12. But, due to the snow blizzards that hit Washington in recent
days, the Government Printing Office was unable to meet the
delivery date. Forms will be made available later this month at
the House Legislative Resource Center, 1036 Longworth House
Office Building (202/225-1300), and the Senate Office of Public
Records, 232 Hart Senate Office Building (202/224-0758).

AN UNRULY LEGISLATURE CAN MAKE ITS OWN RULES,
APPEALS COURT SAYS RHODE ISLAND HOUSE CAN BAN LOBBYISTS

By Edward Zuckerman, Editor & Publisher

     Boston--Rhode Island might have an unruly legislature, but
it at least has the right to set its rules. So, the U.S. 1st
Circuit Court of Appeals held in a recent divided opinion, a 1993
rule that banishes lobbyists from their traditional roosting
place around the floor of the Rhode Island House of
Representatives is valid, no matter what other constitutional
issues it might provoke.
     The 2-1 opinion handed down in late November by a
three-judge appeals court panel overturned an earlier decision by
U.S. District Judge Raymond J. Pettine. He held the rule had to
be set aside because it didn't apply equally to all lobbyists.
While private sector lobbyists were affected, lobbyists from the
state's own agencies retained their access to the House floor.
     Instead of relaxing the rule, the Rhode Island Legislature
reacted to Judge Pettine's decision by extending it to the state
government's lobbyists, too. The legislature's action served only
to harden efforts by a coalition of lobbying organizations to
have the rule declared unconstitutional.
     Inexplicably, Judge Pettine wasn't asked to consider whether
the Rhode Island legislature was entitled to immunity from
judicial intervention. There is a time-honored doctrine, derived
from the Constitution's "speech and debate" clause, which allows
legislatures to conduct their affairs without judicial scrutiny.
     "Parties must speak clearly in the trial court on pain that,
if they forget their lines, they will likely be bound forever to
hold their peace," Circuit Judge Bruce M. Selya noted in the
opinion he wrote for himself and Circuit Judge Conrad K. Cyr.
     But "foolish consistency is reputedly the hobgoblin of
little minds," Judge Selya continued, drawing upon the widsom of
Ralph Waldo Emerson to explain why he and Judge Cyr were making
an exception.
     "In our republican system, different institutions of
government occupy different spheres. Within its own domain, the
legislative branch of a state government is entitled to a
reasonable measure of independence in conducting its internal
affairs," they said.
     And they concluded: "As a rule, a legislature's regulation
of the atmosphere in which it conducts its core legislative
activities--debating, voting, passing legislation and the
like--is part and parcel of the legislative process and, hence,
not subject to a judicial veto."
     Failing to raise a "legislative immunity" defense, the two
circuit judges said, "had the regrettable effect of blindsiding
the district judge and prolonging the litigation."
     Circuit Judge Sandra Lynch, the panel's dissenting member,
felt the Rhode Island House wasn't entitled to immunity and that
its rule did extinguish a First Amendment right.
     "When the government chooses to listen only to its own voice
in the political process by excluding the voices of private
citizens, core First Amendment values are violated.
     "The First Amendment does not permit the government to put
its thumb on the scale in this way and favor itself in the arena
of political speech," she said.

     Connecticut journalist Charles Dudley Warner's century-old
aphorism that "politics makes strange bedfellows" remains true,
Judge Selya said of the "improbable alliance" that banded
together--social workers, school teachers, gun ownership
advocates, pro-life and pro-choice activists and the American
Civil Liberties Union--to protest the Rhode Island House's rule.
     To understand why such a disparate group of organizations
found fellowship, one merely must know that the Rhode Island
House of Representatives is a part-time legislature that meets a
few afternoons and evenings. Its members have their own full-time
jobs. They have no offices, no staff aides, just a chair and a
desk on the House floor. Sometimes, during long legislative
sessions, amendments are offered and approved in the same day.
     There is a gallery overlooking the floor, but there is also
an aisle with a few dozen chairs around the floor's perimeter
which have been occupied for many years by lobbyists. When the
House convened under new leadership in 1993, a rule was approved
that unceremoniously dispatched the private sector lobbyists, who
must be registered and wear identifying badges, to the gallery.
House Rule 45, besides leaving the state government's lobbyists
unaffected, also allowed floor access to the general public.
     House Rule 45 creates a hardship for lobbyists, particularly
when it prevents them from communicating their views on
amendments which are proposed and voted on in the same
proceeding, the trial court acknowledged. Even so, the circuit
court decided, "we think it is beyond serious dispute that
enforcing a duly enacted legislative rule which prohibits
lobbying on the House floor during House sessions is well within
the legislative sphere."
     Judge Lynch, in a dissent which gave First Amendment
concerns priority over a legislature's immunity to judicial veto,
cited several examples where the rule's enforcement gave the
state's lobbyists an unfair advantage.
     For example, when the House took up bills relating to public
funding of abortion, reinstatement of the death penalty and cuts
in public welfare spending, lobbyists from the Rhode Island Right
to Life Committee, the American Civil Liberties Union and the
National Association of Social Workers could only "wave from the
balcony" while the governor, attorney general and state welfare
department officials promoted their views directly to lawmakers.
     "Prison-related bills received the same treatment," Judge
Lynch said. "Department of Corrections officials were on the
floor with legislators during debate while ACLU lobbyists who
opposed the Department's position watched ineffectively from the
balcony. There were numerous other instances where the Governor's
Office, the State Police, the Department of Economic Development,
the Banking and Insurance Department, the Fire Marshal, the
General Treasurer's Office and the Department of Business
Regulation lobbyists spoke directly with legislators on the floor
regarding pending legislation."
     Even if legislative immunity had been raised earlier, Judge
Lynch said it wouldn't have foreclosed "a judicial determination
of the constitutionality of the defendant's practices."
     "The legislative immunity doctrine is not meant for the
protection of the legislators for their own benefit, 'but to
support the rights of the people, by enabling their
representatives to execute the functions of their office without
fear of prosecution, civil or criminal,'" she said, quoting from
a 1972 Supreme Court decision in a bribery case that involved
former Maryland Democratic Sen. Daniel Brewster.
     Lobbying is a form of political speech that deserves First
Amendment protection, Judge Lynch said.
     "The dangers...are plain. By simply excluding all voices
save the voices of government lobbyists, the government could
easily 'suppress support for a minority party or an unpopular
cause, or...exclude the expression of certain ideas from the
marketplace of ideas.' These effects are 'so plainly illegitimate
that they would immediately invalidate the rule,'" she said,
quoting from a 1984 Supreme Court decision.
     And, quoting a more recent Supreme Court decision, she said
the Rhode Island House "has no authority to license one side of
the debate to fight freestyle, while requiring the others to
follow Marquis of Queensbury Rules."
     "The point is that the government has permitted itself to
speak while prohibiting non-government speech. Speech from
non-government speakers, including lobbyists, is also valuable.
Indeed, while lobbying may be subject to registration and
disclosure, no case has ever suggested that lobbying, including
its information-gathering and providing component, could be
banned entirely," Judge Lynch said.
     And she added elsewhere in her dissenting opinion:
     "There is another danger, and that is that the government's
voice will not truly represent the interests of the public.
Government should theoretically represent the people and not
represent itself. Theory and reality often depart. The government
is not always a mirror of the people. Government employees today
are recognized as constituting their own interest group," Judge
Lynch warned.

COLORADO REPUBLICAN PARTY SPENDING CASE
IS NOW GOING TO U.S. SUPREME COURT

     The U.S. Supreme Court said it will review a 10-year-old
legal dispute involving political expenditures by the Colorado
Republican party.
     The case is being watched closely by Democrats and
Republicans. If a decision reached last summer by the U.S. 10th
Circuit Court of Appeals is overturned by the high court, then
the Federal Election Campaign Act's restrictions on political
party expenditures might become unraveled by enabling them to
make unlimited expenditures to elect or defeat federal candidates
without counting against contribution or expenditure limits which
otherwise apply to them.
     At issue in the case is a $15,000 payment by the Colorado
GOP for radio commercials that aired in 1986, fully eight months
before the general election and before the party selected its
candidate to oppose incumbent Sen. Timothy Wirth's (D-Colo.)
re-election. It described it as an "operating expense" in its
financial disclosure to the Federal Election Commission which
opened an investigation after a formal complaint was filed by the
Colorado Democratic party.
     The FEC filed a civil suit in Denver when the Colorado
Republican party refused to admit it violated federal law in a
conciliation agreement. But the FEC's effort to press the case
was dealt a setback when U.S. District Judge Edward Nottingham
ruled the GOP expenditure wasn't subject to government regulation
because the commercials didn't contain an "express advocacy"
message.
     Nottingham cited election law cases dating back to the 1976
Buckley vs. Valeo decision in which the U.S. Supreme Court has
held that political expenditures are immune from government
regulation if they do not convey "express advocacy"--that is,
they don't expressly advocate the election or defeat of a federal
candidate with explicit words such as "vote for" or "vote
against."
     Last summer, though, a three-judge appeals court panel in
Denver held that the "express advocacy" standard applies to
independent expenditure activities. Because political parties
cannot engage in independent expenditure activity, the Colorado
GOP expenditures can only be treated as "coordinated
expenditures" which are subject to the FECA's requirements if
they are made "in connection with a federal election."
     "Any reasonable reading of the commercial would leave the
reader (or listener) with the impression that the Republican
party sought to 'diminish' public support for Wirth and 'garner
support' for the unnamed Republican nominee. The commercial
unquestionably contained an electioneering message.
     "We conclude that the anti-Wirth publicity was an
'expenditure in connection with' the 1986 Colorado senatorial
election because it named both a clearly identifiable candidate
and contained an electioneering message," the appeals court said.
     In its order, the three-judge panel ordered the case back to
the trial court with instructions to enter a finding in the FEC's
favor.
     Instead, the Colorado GOP sought an en banc review by the
U.S. 10th Circuit Court of Appeals. When its petition for review
was rejected by the appeals court, the state party applied for
review by the U.S. Supreme Court.
     In its petition to the high court, the state party argued
that the election law violates its First Amendment right of free
speech. But the U.S. Justice Department, in an opposition brief,
said the appeals court decision complied with Supreme Court
precedent.

CONGRESS PAVES THE WAY FOR ELECTRONIC
FILINGS TO FEDERAL ELECTION COMMISSION

     Congress completed action late last month on legislation
that will speed disclosure and pave the way toward electronic
submission of campaign finance reports.
     Effective immediately, the legislation eliminates the Clerk
of the House as the official filing point-of-entry for House
candidates. Instead, congressional candidates will file their
reports directly to the Federal Election Commission, thus
eliminating a two-day period for delivering copies of reports to
the FEC.
     The legislation does not affect senatorial candidates who
will continue filing their campaign disclosure reports to the
Secretary of the Senate.
     Also, beginning next year, the FEC will be allowed to accept
campaign disclosure reports without requiring a treasurer's legal
signature. By permitting other means for meeting the law's
signature requirement, the FEC will be enabled to accept
electronic submissions.
     Finally, the new law, when signed by President Clinton, will
waive a provision of present election law which requires
candidates, PACs and political parties to make duplicate filings
of their reports in states where computer terminals provide
access to the FEC public records.

MICHIGAN POLITICAL DONORS CAN BE
SOLICITED BY OTHER CANDIDATES

     Lansing, Mich.--Individuals whose gifts to state and local
candidates are publicly disclosed are fair game to other
candidates, Michigan Secretary of State Candice S. Miller said in
an interpretive ruling.
     The state's election law prohibits the use of contributor
information for "commercial" solicitation. But, unlike federal
law, the prohibition doesn't specifically cover "political"
solicitation.
     Miller noted that the U.S. 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals, in
a case involving use of federally disclosed contributor
information, ruled that the publication and sale of contributor
information by Political Contributions Data Inc. did not by
itself constitute a prohibited commercial use.
     Thus, Miller said, Aristotle Industries, the
Washington-based company which requested the ruling, can compile
and sell information about contributors to Michigan
officeseekers.
     "The interpretation of the term 'commercial purposes'
adopted by the 2nd Circuit espouses a rationale that applies
equally well to that same term, as used in the Michigan Campaign
Finance Act. The difference between Michigan's prohibition under
the Michigan Campaign Finance Act and the federal prohibition
under the Federal Election Campaign Act is that the federal
prohibition applies to 'all kinds of solicitations,' whereas the
prohibition of the MCFA applies only to commercial
solicitations," Miller said in her ruling.

DOLE, CLINTON LEAD PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES
IN PRIMARY MATCHING FUND CERTIFICATIONS

     While large portions of the federal government remained
closed, two agencies close to the hearts of most presidential
candidates--the Federal Election Commission and the U.S. Treasury
Department--were open for business.
     As the 1995 calendar year came to an end, the FEC certified
$37.4 million worth of matching fund payments to 10 eligible
presidential candidates.
     They will receive 60% of the certified amount from Treasury,
due to a shortfall in the primary matching fund account, with the
rest to be paid later in the year when taxpayers begin filing
their 1995 federal income taxes.
     Republican hopeful Sen. Bob Dole (R-Kan.) led all recipients
with a $5.6 million payment from Treasury. President Bill
Clinton, facing no serious opposition for the Democratic party
nomination, drew $5.4 million.
     Also on the recipients' list were perennial Democratic
candidate Lyndon LaRouche who received $156,740 and Natural Law
Party candidate John Hagelin who received $60,000.
     Under presidential fund rules, candidates lose their
eligibility 30 days after failing to receive at least 10% of the
vote in two successive primaries.
     Last week, LaRouche appeared to gain a few extra days of
eligibility by becoming the lone Democratic candidate in the
February 24 Delaware primary. President Clinton said he wouldn't
enter the Delaware contest after New Hampshire officials
complained that Delaware scheduled its election only four days
after their state's first-in-the-nation presidential primary.
     Delaware Democrats said last week they would draft
85-year-old former Gov. Elbert Carvel as a "favorite son" to
prevent LaRouche from gaining delegates to the party's
presidential nominating convention.

BOND DEALER ASKS U.S. SUPREME COURT
TO REVIEW CONSTITUTIONALITY OF RULE G-37

     Alabama bond dealer William Blount celebrated the New Year
by asking the U.S. Supreme Court to review lower court decisions
that have upheld the constitutionality of a government regulation
that restricts political contributions by municipal bond firms
and their employees.
     The Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board's Rule G-37
"places unprecedented restrictions on the First Amendment rights
of securities professionals and the Tenth Amendment rights of the
states," Blount claimed in a 21-page brief that was filed with
the high court on January 2.
     Under Rule G-37, which took effect in 1994 with U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission approval, a bond firm cannot
do business with a state or local bond issuing agency for two
years after the firm or an employee makes a contribution to the
campaign of a candidate or official who can influence the
agency's decisions.
     The rule hit particularly hard against Blount because he was
chairman of the Alabama Democratic Party when it took effect.
Because he was expected to help candidates raise money for their
campaigns, Blount won a temporary order that suspended the rule's
application to him.
     Rule G-37, Blount charged in his petition, "does violence to
constitutional principles" and usurps the power of states to
enact their own campaign finance laws.
     Blount went to the Supreme Court after the U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia said it wouldn't
review a three-judge panel's conclusion that the MSRB rule was
constitutional.
     The appeals court upheld the rule, even in the absence of
evidence of so-called "pay-to-play" practices which the MSRB said
its rule was designed to prevent.
     "No smoking gun is needed where, as here, the conflict of
interest is apparent, the likelihood of stealth is great and the
legislative purpose is prophylactic," the appeals court said.

REFORMERS CRITICIZE USE OF STATE-OWNED
BUILDINGS FOR POLITICAL FUNDRAISING EVENTS

     Albany, N.Y.--Reform advocates think its "outrageous" for
New York state lawmakers to hold campaign fundraising events in
restaurants which are located in the state-owned Empire State
Plaza which has underground passageways to the state capitol and
its office buildings.
     Representatives of four organizations--New York Common
Cause, New York Public Interest Research Group, the League of
Women Voters and United We Stand America--criticized the practice
at a late December press conference.
     They said there was nothing illegal about holding campaign
fundraising events in the privately-owned, rent-paying
businesses. But they also said it was unethical to raise campaign
funds on state-owned property.

New problem for Mrs. Waldholtz

     Fees paid to a private detective who worked for Rep. Enid
Greene Waldholtz's (R-Utah) 1994 campaign do not appear in
campaign finance disclosure reports to the Federal Election
Commission, the Salt Lake Tribune reported.
     Malcolm Shannon, a private investigator, told the newspaper
he only provided personal security consulting services to Mrs.
Waldholtz. But sources in Waldholtz's campaign claimed Shannon
checked the backgrounds of people who were contributing to the
campaigns of her opponents, Democratic incumbent Karen Shepherd
and independent Merrill Cook.
     The newspaper said the Utah Democratic Party filed a formal
complaint to the Federal Election Commission last October,
alleging the Waldholtz's campaign violated the federal election
law by failing to disclose the fees paid to Shannon.

Eating words

     "PACs just try to buy influence and buy incumbents...(I
don't) accept PAC money and I'd like to see an end to this type
of money-funneling." That was Massachusetts Republican Gov.
William Weld speaking to the Boston Ad Club a few years ago.
     Last month, Weld said he would raise PAC funds for his
campaign against Sen. John Kerry (D-Mass.).
     Kerry doesn't accept PAC contributions but, the Boston Globe
noted, Kerry raised PAC funds while he chaired the Democratic
Senatorial Campaign Committee.

Disclosure compliance

     Baltimore City Council members Agnes Welch and Martin
O'Malley filed tardy campaign finance disclosure reports and paid
fines for missing the deadlines just in time for their December 7
inaugurations, the Baltimore Sun reported.
     Under Maryland law, elected state and local officials cannot
be sworn into office without certification by the State
Administrative Board of Election Laws that all disclosure reports
have been filed and all fines have been paid.

Wooing Catholics

     Christian Coalition, which mixes anti-abortion politics with
conservative social and welfare issues, has created a subsidiary
called the Catholic Alliance to increase its membership in
Massachusetts where voters tend to be Catholic, Democratic and
liberal.
     The Virginia-based political organization claims that
250,000 of its 1.7 million members are Catholic, even though the
church doesn't support its views on such issues as gun control,
immigration, welfare reform and budget cuts. Church officials
have remained neutral, allowing the Catholic Alliance to buy a
full-page ad in the Boston archdiocese newspaper to promote
attendance at a membership recruitment event.
     Catholic Alliance, described as a "wholly-owned subsidiary"
by Christian Coalition director Ralph Reed, will lure Catholics
into membership by focusing entirely on abortion and school
prayer.

Spinning out of control

     "Hopefully, they learned a lesson: not all politicians are
bad," State Rep. Alex Diaz de la Portilla said after fined $500
by the Florida Elections Commission for filing a false campaign
finance disclosure report.
     "We feel totally vindicated. They threw out five charges. To
not embarrass the elections department, they decided to find him
guilty of something," Portilla's brother and lawyer, Miguel Diaz
de la Portilla, told the Miami Herald.

Letter of the law

     Alaska Democratic Gov. Tony Knowles has come under fire for
refusing to disclose an estimated $300,000 worth of contributions
collected by his Governor's Fund at two fundraising events prior
to the February 15 disclosure deadline. Besides waiting for the
last minute, the gifts are expected to be treated as Alaska
Democratic Party receipts.
     "The governor's decision to delay disclosure, while within
the letter of the law, violates the spirit of the law. So does
his decision to report the fundraiser in the Democratic Party's
1995 report, which will not break out the information in a
quickly accessible separate report," the Anchorage Daily News
editorialized.
     "State disclosure statutes were designed so Alaskans would
know who contributed to elected officials and candidates...(T)he
law says the contributions must be reported by Feb. 15, not on
Feb. 15," the newspaper said.

Doctors' bill

     The Massachusetts Medical Society was fined $45,000 by the
state's ethics commission for providing at least $15,000 worth of
illegal gratuities to state lawmakers between 1989 and 1993. As
part of its settlement, the 214-year-old society which represents
15,000 physicians and medical students, admitted that its
lobbyist, Andrew Hunt, made gifts to lawmakers to ensure friendly
treatment of health-related legislation.
     Hunt, according to the Boston Globe, hosted key lawmakers on
a 1992 fishing trip to Puerto Rico and a 1993 golf trip to
Florida. Hunt submitted expense accounts to the society which
described the purpose of his expenditures as "medical
malpractice" or "Medicare" without identifying those who were
entertained.
