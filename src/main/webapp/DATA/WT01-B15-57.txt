We are now up  by about 15% since our bond buy signal in the May issue. You shoulda been in the Canadian equity market, you say!!? You could have also bought GIC's and have earned about 2% over the same time. Incidentally, research people at the Royal Bank just reported that even GIC's are actually paying a very good "real rate of return."  Real rate of return is the difference between the inflation rate and the actual return on the GIC. Royal thinks people shouldn't feel bad about the apparent poor performance.<p>The Royal Bank should know better. Although they're dead right, you'll never persuade a rate-shocked retiree that all's well. The last time I tried to explain this very point to a senior was years ago. I thought that she was going to hit me.<p>The Canadian bond market is moving to new all time highs. How far will it go? As usual, it's hard to say, but there's huge <i>potential</i> still ahead. The God of Bond Traders will tell you that when any market moves to new all-time highs, there is normally more positive action ahead. One caveat here is that this rally is has gone farther than any other intermediate term rally over the last five years. As always, be careful out there.<p>Several important Intermarket factors come into play. Firstly, the US bond market is trying to catch up. Our 10 year T Bond index shows yields of about 6% with the potential to fall to about 5.5% so there's probably a little room left for higher bond prices. The US Dollar is stronger too, another positive for higher US bond prices. Note that in Canada, our Dollar did not breakout through 75 ct. and has lost ground. Several newspapers quickly blamed the Bank of Canada. However the change factor was from outside Canada and was the US Dollar, because both the DM and the Yen lost ground, too. </td><td> &nbsp</td><td background="../images/tbltile.gif" bgcolor=#c6d6c6 valign=top><center><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2><br><img src="../images/charts.gif" width=80 height=15><font face="Arial" size=-1><hr noshade color=#297b63></center>Note: Charts are<br>designed for full<br>screen viewing.<p><center><b><a href="charts/10yrustb.gif">10 Yr.
