<B>VAXCEL ANNOUNCES LICENSE AGREEMENT
WITH CORIXA<BR>
</B>
<P>
<B>Atlanta, Georgia, (April 9, 1996)
<BR>
</B>
<P>
Vaxcel, Inc. today announced the
signing of a definitive license agreement with Corixa Corporation
for use of Vaxcel's Optivax&#174; in combination with vaccines
being developed by Corixa.<BR>

<P>
Optivax is Vaxcel's proprietary
vaccine delivery and adjuvant system that is based on synthetic
copolymers. In preclinical studies, Optivax has been shown to
significantly improve the effectiveness of a variety of different
vaccines. In January Vaxcel announced the initiation of a Phase
I human clinical trial to evaluate the safety of Optivax administered
in combination with a  human chorionic gonadotropin based vaccine
in patients with metastatic cancer.<BR>

<P>
Terms of the deal with Corixa were
not disclosed. However, Paul Wilson, president &amp; CEO of Vaxcel,
said Corixa received worldwide, exclusive rights to use Optivax
with a variety of cancer and infectious disease vaccines being
developed by Corixa. Corixa also has the right to sublicense vaccines
containing Optivax. Corixa or its sublicensees will be responsible
for conducting all development, regulatory submissions and marketing
activities for their vaccines combined with Optivax.<BR>

<P>
“We are pleased that Corixa
has licensed Vaxcel's Optivax for a number of vaccines
they are developing,” Mr. Wilson said. “Corixa is an
excellent partner for Vaxcel. This agreement is another example
of our strategic plan to enter into multiple corporate alliances,
each having the potential to generate significant revenue for
Vaxcel.”<BR>

<P>
Corixa, a privately-held Seattle-based
biotechnology company formed in late 1994, is discovering and
developing T cell therapeutic vaccines for the treatment of certain
infectious diseases and cancer. Corixa has two announced corporate
partners, S.B. Biologicals for an infectious disease program and
CellPro, Inc. for the development and marketing of <I>ex vivo</I>
applications of Corixa's cancer technology.<BR>

<P>
Vaxcel is engaged in the development
and commercialization of Optivax and offers field-of-use licenses
to companies developing new vaccines or improving existing ones.
In addition to this license agreement with Corixa, the company
also has option agreements with Connaught Laboratories, Inc. and
Medeva PLC to evaluate and develop human vaccines using Optivax.
Vaxcel is a wholly owned subsidiary of CytRx Corporation (NASDAQ:
CYTR).<BR>

<P>
CytRx Corporation and its subsidiaries
are engaged in the development of pharmaceutical products. In
addition to Vaxcel, CytRx has two other subsidiaries. Vetlife
is developing products to enhance food animal growth and Proceutics
provides high quality preclinical development services to the
pharmaceutical industry.<BR>
