<H2 ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER>The More <EM>Natural</EM> Teeth You Are 
Missing, the Quicker You Will Age</CENTER></H2>

If you want to live a long, healthy life, then you should try your best to keep as
many of your natural teeth as you can. In the more than 30 years I have been in
dental practice, I have noticed that the healthiest people are those who have the
most natural teeth. Conversely, those people who have the fewest of their original
teeth usually have been those people with the most health problems. I know for a fact
that missing your natural teeth is one of the greatest 
causes of premature aging. Hippocrates, the &quot;father&quot; of Western medicine, once said:
&quot;The greater the number of teeth, the longer one's life.&quot; He may not have been a
dentist, but he underscored a principle important to my way of doing dentistry.

<P>That's because life flows from the teeth. When any of your 32 original teeth is lost,
a small bit of your life is also lost. If there is a &quot;master plan&quot; for the human
body, surely it includes a life lived with all 32 teeth intact, and not for people to
be wearing full dentures at age 40. My golden rule of dentistry is this: Save a tooth
at all costs. If more people believed in this rule they would feel a hundred times
better than they do right now.

<P>Let's take wrinkles. I contend that poor dental structure, which means worn-down,
crooked, or missing teeth, or a poor dental bite, can often result in facial lines
and wrinkles. The teeth help support your facial structure, especially around the
lips. When your teeth are missing or excessively worn down, you will lack what
dentists call sufficient &quot;vertical dimension&quot; to support the facial skin. This means
your face may develop lines and wrinkles and  that &quot;caved-in&quot; look so prevalent in
the elderly.

<P>
Then there is the matter of dental stress. This can cause rapid aging. The stress
caused to the entire body from missing teeth is often the most severe kind of stress
your body can experience. When your natural teeth are missing, your face may
experience less than adequate blood circulation. This is why you see so many people
with excessive dental problems sporting a pale and pasty look to their facial skin.
My advice here is simple: The more natural teeth you have and the more missing teeth
you have replaced (so there are no gaps), the better your skin and facial structure
will look-and the better you will feel.

<P>In fact, anyone with missing teeth usually should have them replaced if he is
concerned about staying young and healthy. It is far better to have teeth in your
mouth, even if they're false teeth, than to go around with a mouth full of holes.
This is surely the road to rapid aging. If you need to replace a tooth that has been
out of your mouth for many years, be sure your dentist first &quot;pretreats&quot; your mouth
by repositioning any teeth that may have moved from their original position after a
specific tooth has been pulled.

<P>Better think twice before having any teeth extracted. I rarely pull teeth and I am
proud of it. I believe in saving the tooth at all costs, even if it's inconvenient.
For example, if a person had a tooth pulled instead of trying to save it with a full
crown, she would lose not only the tooth but the tooth's root. This is important
because when a root is extracted from the jaw, the jaw will become that much smaller
and narrower as it fills in the area left open from the extracted root. One of the
golden rules to living a long life is to have as wide a jaw as possible. Dentally
speaking, the big mouths live the longest!

<P>Even the crooked or crowded teeth of children should and can be saved from
extraction. Many teeth can be saved in the mouths of children that do not have enough
room for all their teeth. In my practice I use a &quot;Crozat removable appliance&quot; that
puts mild pressure on the jaw bone to widen it and thereby make room for all the
teeth. 

<P>The Crozat appliance works with adults, too. I treated a patient who had been advised
to have gum surgery and teeth extractions. Instead, I had her wear the Crozat
appliance for 2 years, after which there was no need for any teeth to come out or any
surgery. The beauty of this device is that it cannot be seen from outside the mouth
which is why it's often called the &quot;invisible braces.&quot;

<P>Your teeth are like the keys on a typewriter operating 24 hours a day as the
terminal endings of sensory nerve pathways. When you extract a tooth, you leave a
pathway with no terminal ending, and this alters nerve reflexes, for the worse. On
the other hand, when you restore the tooth's enamel surface with a filling or crown
you also alter the way this tooth works as a sensory receptor for the body. This
means any change you make to a tooth must be physiologically compatible with the
patient's nervous system. 

<P>Your teeth are &quot;connected&quot; to the rest of your body, as these examples show. A
patient had chronic back pain for 17 years, cause unknown. Within 5 minutes of giving
this patient's lower jaw bone proper dental support, the pain disappeared. Another
patient had stiff or locked knee for 6 years; after his dentures were put into
physiological balance with his body, the stiffness released. 

<P>Want to stay mentally sharp as you age and not lose any neuronal strength to the
years? Keep your 32 original teeth intact because the fewer natural teeth you have,
the less mental acuity you will usually have. There is a very strong possibility that
the reason many people seem to lose their sense of mental quickness as they age is
because they have missing teeth. The brain was designed for 32 teeth in the jaw.
Since the teeth support the face via the facial muscles and bone, the fewer teeth in
the mouth, the less support. 

<P>The teeth are connected to the brain and, as a consequence, the teeth are constantly
stimulating the brain. This is something false teeth cannot do. The fewer teeth, the
less stimulation to the central nervous system; and the less neural stimulation, the
more aging. This concept is not observed in today's dentistry yet it is why I contend
the relationship between teeth and the brain is one of the most important areas in
all of dentistry. So keep your teeth and live long.
