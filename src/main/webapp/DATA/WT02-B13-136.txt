<h2>
Immigration and the California Election</a>
</a></h2>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>California Governor Pete Wilson declared an "immigration emergency" on
September 21 and argued in a third lawsuit against the federal government that
the "foreign invasion" of California requires federal reimbursement for
educating, incarcerating, and providing emergency health care to undocumented
immigrants who arrived since 1986.  Wilson cited the Tenth Amendment, which
guarantees states protection against invasion.  According to the suit:  "The
massive and unlawful migration of foreign nationals...constitutes an invasion
of the state of California against which the United States is obligated to
protect California..." Florida made a similar argument in its suit demanding
federal reimbursement for the costs of illegal immigrant. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Democratic gubernatorial candidate Kathleen Brown on September 13 called
for a doubling of the number of Border Patrol agents along the US-Mexican
border, to be accomplished by closing the inland checkpoints and moving agents
toward the border and raising additional funds for 400 additional agents by
imposing a $1 border crossing fee.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>On September 17, US Attorney General Reno announced that the 300 agents now
stationed at the interior California highway checkpoints would be transferred
to the border as part of the a new border control plan called Operation
Gatekeeper. California politicians have been calling for an Operation
Hold-the-Line in San Diego, after the El Paso INS achieved 90 percent local
approval for an operation that kept 400 Border Patrol agents on the border
around the clock.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>On the San Diego-Tijuana border, the INS built a 14-mile fence, 10-foot
high fence that, with bright lights, has encouraged aliens attempting illegal
entry to try to cross by overwhelming the INS with numerous small groups, so
that some groups can elude the INS.  Under a plan announced by President
Clinton, there will be 1,600 Border Patrol agents on the San Diego border in
1995, double the 814 agents in 1991.  Apprehensions in the San Diego area are
down--from an average 45,000 monthly between 1991 and 1993, to about 36,000
monthly so far in 1994.</tt><p>
<tt><b></b></tt><p>
<tt><b></b>Reno announced that a second part of "Operation Gatekeeper" is to
have the federal government reimburse states for the costs of incarcerating
criminal illegal aliens.  The "Crime Bill" signed by President Clinton on
September 13, 1994 includes $1.8 billion over six years to cover the cost of
imprisoning illegal immigrants convicted of committing crimes, including $130
million in FY 95.  California , expected to get 70 percent of these funds, will
receive its first payment on December 31, 1994.  On September 15, 1994,
California Governor Wilson called a press conference to ask US Attorney General
Reno to take custody of 19,000 unauthorized aliens in California prisons or to
reimburse California for the costs--estimated to be $474 million-- of
incarcerating them.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>On September 29, Reno joined the criticism of Governor Wilson by asserting
that he, while a US Senator from 1983-1991, "fostered some of the illegal
immigration that we're trying to deal with."  California farmers in the early
1980s wanted a non-contractual temporary worker program through which they
could get foreign farmworkers without having the US Department of Labor certify
that Americans were not available to fill each vacant job.  With the help of
Tony Coehlo and Leon Panetta, farmers won such a free agent program in the
House in 1984, and Wilson successfully got a similar provision included in the
Senate version of what became IRCA in 1985, albeit with a cap of 350,000 such
floating foreign farmworkers.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The compromise included in IRCA in 1986 substituted an easy-to-defraud SAW
legalization program for these free agent foreign worker programs; the US
permitted over 1.1 million illegal aliens to become legal immigrants through
the SAW program.  This fraud and ineffective border and interior enforcement
have produced in the fields about the same levels of illegal immigration as
existed before IRCA--20 to 40 percent of the peak workforces are believed to be
so-called "documented illegals." </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The US Housing and Urban Development Department announced on September 16
that it was going to begin enforcing a federal ban on illegal aliens receiving
housing subsidies that was enacted in 1980.  Some 1.4 million poor American
households live in public housing, and another 1.3 million households receive
assistance to live in private housing, and unknown number of the estimated four
million illegal aliens in the US in October 1994 are among those getting these
housing subsidies.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>One complication in enforcing housing subsides rules is the reality of
mixed families, especially US citizen children with illegal alien parents,
often a result of children being born to such parents here.  Such mixed
families will be eligible for  partial housing assistance. </tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC2">
US Sets Quota for Cuban Immigrants</a>
</a></h2>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The US and Cuba negotiated an agreement on September 9 in New York which
calls for the US to accept a minimum 20,000 Cubans annually, and on September
13 Cuba began to prevent the exit of those trying to leave Cuba.  By September
15, when it was reported that the exodus of Cubans had been virtually stopped,
some 30,000 Cubans were being held in detention camps at the US base in
Guantanamo Bay, Panama and elsewhere.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>This policy change can be seen as the continuation or the end of special
treatment of Cubans in immigration matters.  Since 1965, all Cubans who arrived
in the US were eligible for US immigrant status--Cuba was the one country for
which there were no numerical immigration limitations.  Under the new
agreement, there will be an annual limit on Cuban immigration, but only Cuba
will be guaranteed an annual minimum number of immigration slots. <b>
</b></tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Because the US has agreed to accept at least 20,000 Cubans annually, the US
will likely have to bend the usual entry rules for Cubans.  The two major front
doors for immigrants to the US are for family unification and because a US
employer identifies a foreigner with a special skill to fill a vacant job.
There are long queues for Cuban immigrants wanting to enter as relatives, so
the US plans to use a combination of a lottery and an expanded definition of
refugee to ensure that the 20,000 quota is fulfilled. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Cuba wanted a comprehensive solution, including a lifting of the US trade
embargo, but the US succeeded in confining the talks to immigration.  By
refusing to discuss the trade embargo, the only concession that the US  could
offer in exchange for Cuban help to stop the exodus was at least 20,000 minimum
immigration slots annually.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The Clinton Administration agreed to the negotiations because its August 19
change of policy failed to stem the exodus.  On August 19, the US announced
that it would no longer admit automatically to the US Cubans who arrived; those
found at sea would be detained outside the US, and would have to qualify for
admission individually.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Cuba believed that the US committed itself to accept 20,000 Cubans annually
in 1984, the maximum number of "quota immigrants" from any country (raised to
27,845 by IMMACT in 1990).  The US asserted that there was no firm commitment
to take a certain number of Cubans in any year; about 11,000 Cubans have
emigrated to the US since 1984, including 2,700 in the past 12 months ending
July 31, 1994.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>All Cubans who wish to migrate to the US will be processed at US facilities
in Cuba.  For most Cubans, the only choices for entry are as the adult brothers
and sisters of US citizens, or as refugees.  The US will first clear the
backlog of 4,000 to 6,000 Cubans on the brothers and sisters list, and then use
both a lottery and a relaxed definition of refugee to satisfy its commitment to
take 20,000 Cubans annually.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Some Cubans may be paroled into the US to wait for their names to get to
the top of the immigration queue.  About one-third of all legal immigrants
"admitted" each year have to leave the US to present themselves at a US
consulate abroad and show that they are eligible to immigrate.  It is believed
that two-thirds of the immigrants "admitted" from Mexico are in the US when
they are called for interviews. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The only way Cubans held in camps such as those at Guantanamo Bay and in
Panama can apply for US immigration status is to return to Cuba and apply
there.  There is speculation about the fate of the 30,000 Cubans now being held
in these camps--will they voluntarily repatriate to Cuba, and apply for exit
permits there, or will they remain as a costly and perhaps troublesome reminder
of past US immigration policies?</tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC3">No
Haitian Invasion</a>
</a></h2>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>On September 15, President Clinton announced that the US would lead an
invasion of Haiti if necessary to restore elected President Aristide to power
according to the terms of UN Security Council Resolution 940.  Throughout the
speech, Clinton stressed the need to restore democracy in Haiti, and the
self-interest of Americans in preventing costly refugee flows, as a reason to
invade.  On September 18, with American planes in the air, Haitian leaders
resigned, and the invasion was called off.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>According to Clinton, 21,000 Haitians were picked up at sea by US ships
since the beginning of the year.  Some 14,000 Haitians are being held in
Guantanamo, at a cost to the US of $200 million to date.  Since the US Army
arrival in Haiti, 221 Haitians have returned to their country. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Another 300,000 Haitians are reportedly in hiding, ready to flee their
country if they can.  This "threat of a mass exodus of refugees and its
constant threat to stability in our regions and control of our borders" was a
major justification for American action.</tt><p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC4">INS
Mismanagement</a>
</a><br>
</h2>
<tt>The New York Times, in a series of articles September 11-16, criticized the
Immigration and Naturalization Service as an agency that is mismanaged and
demoralized, unable to perform its functions of welcoming wanted immigrants and
non-immigrants, and deporting and keeping out those that are not wanted.
</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The September 11 article describes "mismanagement" at the 19,000 employee,
$1.6 billion INS--one third of the INS's budget is collected as fees from
persons requesting INS services.  Telephones are often not answered, and mail
is sometimes not opened, while INS inspectors, and sometime their families,
take Caribbean cruises to check passenger travel documents on board in order to
speed up their return.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The agency's budget has tripled and its work force has grown by 50 percent
since 1986.  Doris Meissner, head of what she terms a "dysfunctional" agency,
has an aggressive strategy to change the agency, but the problems of the
decentralized INS appear daunting.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The INS, for example, does not aggressively collect from all airlines the
$6 each passengers is charged upon arrival in the US, thereby losing about $23
million per year.  Bonds posted by immigrants who do not show up for their
hearings can be forfeited to the INS, but the INS often fails to collect this
forfeited bond money--some $38 million over the past six years. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The September 12 story focused on corruption in the INS, detailing how a
few  INS employees in Arlington, Virginia--one of 32 INS district offices-- had
sold work authorization to 4,000 aliens, and immigrant status to 1,000.  The
INS has for years offered low pay and inadequate support services to employees
who have enormous discretion to provide or withhold documents for which
immigrants are willing to pay huge sums.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The September 13 story used an example of a Mexican national living in
Gilroy, California to show how hard it is to deport criminal aliens.  There are
about 200,000 convicted criminal aliens in the US, and about 20,000 were
deported in 1993.  Federal and state prisons hold about 90,000 foreign-born
inmates, and most are deportable after they serve their sentences.  In many
cases, the INS sends letters to aliens ordering them to show up at an INS
office for deportation, but 90,000 are fugitives, and the INS tracks down
relatively few of them.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>On September 14, Operation Hold-the-Line was profiled.  This INS operation
in El Paso, Texas successfully stopped the types of immigration that most local
residents disliked--teenagers committing crimes and peddlers.  However, it was
not clear that INS leadership in Washington supported the El Paso approach of
preventing aliens from entering the US, rather than the usual practice of
catching and returning them, especially when Mexico complained that the INS was
souring relations in the middle of the NAFTA debate. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The September 15 concluding story focused on the "cold, rude, and
insensitive" INS by highlighting stories of the INS not answering its phones,
making mistakes that force immigrants to sometimes wait years for visas and
work authorizations to which they are entitled, and for which they paid fees of
$576 million in 1994.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>There seem to be three major reasons why the INS has such a poor reputation
for providing efficient and humane services.  First, the INS has the sometimes
competing missions of keeping out illegal aliens and providing services to
legal aliens, and the law-and- order side of the agency has tended to dominate
its culture.  Second, aliens are generally powerless to complain if they get
poor service, so there is relatively less client pressure for improved
services.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Third, the INS budget has been inadequate, and there has been a tradition
of considerable autonomy in various regions and districts, so that there was no
strong central pressure for e.g. a centralized computer system.  It has been
alleged that some in Congress kept the INS underfunded in order to have
constituents turn to their representatives in despair, and thereby win the
constituent's loyalty for helping them through the immigration
labyrinth.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>In a harbinger of the troubles that may befall the national registry
proposed by the Commission on Immigration Reform (MN, August), it was reported
that in 1993, California sent for verification to the SAVE system the
immigration numbers of 3.6 million aliens who had applied for benefits.  Even
though 18 percent were not in the INS computers, nearly all were in the US
legally.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>A July 1994 poll by ABC News found that 74 percent of those polled agreed
with the statement that "the US government is allowing too many immigrants to
enter this country."</tt><p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC5">Immigration
and Farmworker Unions</a>
</a></h2>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The United Farm Workers (UFW) union held its twelfth constitutional
convention in Fresno, California on September 3-4, 1994.  Perhaps more than any
other US union, the UFW's fortunes mirror illegal immigration.  The UFW burst
onto the national scene with a grape boycott in the late 1960s, after the
Bracero Program was terminated and before illegal immigration surged--212,000
illegal aliens were apprehended in 1969.  By 1970, the UFW had contracts with
most of the major producers of table grapes, and in 1975, California enacted a
farm labor relations law that granted organizing and bargaining rights to
California farmworkers.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The UFW won 200 elections on California farms in the fall of 1975, and by
1978 had over 100 contracts.  The number of contracts slid to about 60 in 1982,
and has remained at 25 to 30 since 1983.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>There were four types of arguments advanced for why the UFW failed to
become one of the nation's largest unions by organizing most of California's
900,000 farmworkers.  First, it was argued that UFW leadership and strategy
changes led the union to quit organizing and to isolate itself from
farmworkers.  Second, it was alleged that Republican governors have since 1982
failed to properly enforce the farm labor relations law.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Third, it has been noted that the structure of farm employment is
changing--farming companies only lease land, and rely on farm labor contractors
who can "control" their workers or custom harvesters who are employers in their
own right and have thereby insulated themselves from union activities.  Fourth,
there is more illegal immigration than ever before, especially after the SAW
program permitted about one sixth of the adult men in rural Mexico to become
legal US immigrants.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Journalists tend to blame the UFW's troubles on UFW leaders, and they see
new hope now that Cesar Chavez's son-in-law has become UFW president.  The UFW
blames Republican governors for making anti-UFW appointments to the state's
Agricultural Labor Relations Board, and is campaigning vigorously for
Democratic candidate Kathleen Brown.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>If personalities or politics explain the rise and fall of the UFW, then
there should be a UFW resurgence that may be accelerated after the November
1994 elections.  But economists have downplayed these reasons for the UFW's
demise; which  means a continuation of the pattern that fewer than 10 percent
of the state's farmworkers will be covered by collective bargaining
agreements--unless farm employment patterns change or illegal immigration is
reduced sharply.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The UFW's most significant victory during the summer of 1994 was with
Dole's Fresh Vegetable Oceanview Produce Company division.  Employing as many
as 25,000 farmworkers during a typical year, it is California's largest
agricultural employer.  Dole employs 800 farmworkers to work in strawberry and
vegetable fields during the spring and summer in Oxnard, north of Los Angeles.
The UFW won the May 12, 1994 election, but Oceanview announced in August that
it would stop growing labor-intensive strawberries, eliminating 450 of these
jobs.  Dole could easily do this because all of its 2,000 acres of farmland in
the area is leased rather than owned.  The UFW has threatened a boycott of Dole
products if the company in fact eliminates strawberry production. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Farmworker wages have been falling since the early 1980s, when the UFW's
statewide influence on farm wages became only local as growers with contracts
went out of business or did not re-negotiate agreements.  The rise of labor
contracting has also hurt farmworkers, since more of them live off the farm,

Immigration and Welfare in Canada</a>
</a></h2>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Ontario has 40 percent of Canada's 29 million people, but 50 percent of
Canada's welfare recipients and costs.  Most of the welfare recipients are
Canadians, but there several immigration smuggling-welfare rings have recently
been uncovered, including one that charged $18,000 to $20,000 for each alien
smuggled to Canada, and then collected half of the welfare payments received.
Half of the 28,000 refugees in Ontario are on welfare, including Somali warlord
Adid's second wife.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>It has been alleged that some sponsors of family unification immigrants
take two or three jobs to prove that they can cover the costs of the immigrants
they seek to bring into Canada, but then lose their jobs or renege on their
sponsorship agreements.  There are reportedly 16,000 cases in which Canadian
sponsors of immigrants have reneged on their sponsorship agreements. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt> A Gallup Poll conducted in Canada in August found that 35 percent of
Canadians feel that refugees use more than their share of health and social
services, and that only 46 percent feel that refugees are interested in giving
something back to Canada.  Forty-seven percent feel that accepting Southeast
Asians more than a decade ago has cost taxpayers too much money.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>However, a study of Southeast Asians admitted between 1979 and 1981 by the
Clarke Institute of Psychiatry and the University of Toronto found that only
eight percent of the refugees from Vietnam, China, Laos and Cambodia were
unemployed in 1991, when unemployment in Canada was 10.3 percent.  One in five
former refugees has started a business, often employing Canadians. </tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC7">Immigrants
and the US Labor Market</a>
</a></h2>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Economists disagree about the effects of immigrants on jobs and wages, and
partisans tend to exaggerate their effects.  Economic theory and history are
clear:  immigrants should reduce wages or increase joblessness among similar
American workers, and increase the wages and profits of skilled and wealthy
Americans.  The disputed issue is how much.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Studies of the effects of a large number of immigrants entering a local
labor market, such as the 125,000 Cubans into Miami's labor market in the early
1980s, typically find little wage depression and labor displacement.  This led
many to conclude that there were no such effects.  But now the evidence seems
to suggest that the wage depression and labor displacement predicted by
economic theory were real, and the problem was one of measuring these effects.
For example, it has been suggested that the mobile and unskilled American labor
force moves out of areas in which there are large numbers of immigrants, or
does not move to such areas.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Some argue that the increased number of immigrants in low-wage jobs in the
1980s contributed to the economic recovery after the 1990-91 recession.  The
demand for low-wage workers has grown, in this view, as the economy has shifted
from manufacturing to services.   <b></b></tt><p>
<tt><b></b></tt><p>
<tt>Robert Reich, Secretary Labor, says that he is as not concerned about
immigrants displacing Americans from jobs as he is about the tendency of
immigrants to lower the quality of US jobs, as employers look to them as the
ultimate flexible workers.  Employers prefer these flexible work situations,
and "at times[such jobs] result in the avoidance of social security taxes,
workers' compensation, unemployment insurance and benefits such as health
insurance and pensions."  For the immigrants, these casual jobs are still a
step up from their native countries.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>At a September 20 hearing of the US Civil Rights Commission on racial and
ethnic tensions in American communities, a Chinese-American labor union leader
testified that the employer sanctions provision of IRCA is known in New York
City's Chinatown as the "slave law," because it pushed low-wage workers into
illegal sweatshops.  The labor union representative said that employer
sanctions left only the most exploitative employers, who bring in thousands of
Chinese aboard "slave ships" such as the Golden Venture, which ran aground
outside of New York City last year.  The New York INS office reported that,
since IRCA was enacted, there had been 605 completed cases that proposed fines
of $12 million against employers and collected $4 million. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>On September 9, Reich announced that the Labor Department will be stepping
up its investigations of illegal sweatshops.  Reich said there is evidence that
the problem of sweatshops in the United States is growing more serious.  A DOL
survey of garment manufacturers in California found the more than half of the
firms were paying below the minimum wage of $4.25 per hour and 68 percent were
violating federal overtime requirements.  DOL has the authority, not used since
the 1940s, to prohibit the shipment of clothing that was produced in violation
of minimum wage and overtime laws.  In five cases during the past year, DOL has
prohibited the shipment of  clothing until workers were paid back
wages.<b></b></tt><p>
<tt><b></b></tt><p>
<tt>How does immigration affect America's "competitiveness."  DOL Secretary
Reich defined competitiveness as rising living standards for MOST Americans,
linking economic growth with economic equality.  In 1978, a white male college
graduate earned 49 percent more than a white man with only a high school
diploma, yet both were considered middle class.  Today, this gap has widened,
so that the college graduate earned 82 percent more in 1992, and the relatively
lower incomes of high school graduates puts them at risk of falling out of the
middle class.  Indeed, Business Week asserted in a recent cover story that "you
can all but forget about joining the middle class unless you go to college"
(p.78).</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Current immigration patterns accentuate growing earnings inequality, since
immigrants tend to be bunched at the extremes of the education distribution,
and years of education is the best single predictor of earnings.  If
large-scale immigration continues, and most newcomers continue to be either
college graduates OR high school dropouts, immigration is likely to figure in
what many are predicting will be the major economic debate of the 1990s:  what
to do about economic inequality.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The traditional view is that a rising tide lifts all boats, or that general
economic growth helps both rich and poor.  This did not happen in the 1980s.
The richest 25 percent of American families--those with incomes of $64,000 or
more in 1992--get 51 percent of national income, while the poorest 25
percent--with incomes of less than $22,000--got six percent.  Over three in
four children from top-25 percent families get college degrees, versus 1 in 25
of bottom-25 percent families.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Some economic studies suggest that too much education and earnings
inequality can slow economic growth because co-workers do not have the skills
needed to make the educated with high earnings as productive as they otherwise
would be.  In the US, the average hourly earnings of the highest paid 10
percent of men in 1992 was almost six times that of the lowest 10
percent--e.g., $30 hourly versus $5, twice the average 3 to 1 ratio in Western
Europe and Japan. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Immigration is only one of several factors responsible for increased
earnings inequality.  A new Economic Policy Institute study attributes the
decline in real wages-- 2.6 percent from 1989 to 1993-- to the expansion of
low-wage service jobs and the increasing globalization of the US economy,
reflected in both rising trade and more immigration.  Other studies point to
technologies that require more skills, the decline of unions, and tax cuts on
the wealthy.  According to EPI calculations, entry level wages declined 8
percent for high-school educated men, and 6 percent for college educated men,
calling into question the notion that more education always leads to higher
earnings. </tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC8">
Studies Continue to Dispute Immigration's Benefits and Costs</a>
</a></h2>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>In response to pleas and suits by governors seeking federal reimbursement
for the costs of illegal immigration, the Urban Institute in Washington, DC
recently completed a White House-commissioned study of the taxes paid and the
cost of benefits provided to illegal immigrants in seven states--Arizona,
California, Florida, Illinois, New Jersey, New York, and Texas.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The Urban Institute concluded that illegal immigrants cost the states more
in services than they pay to the states in taxes, but that all immigrants
collectively pay $25 to $30 billion more in taxes to all levels of government
than they cost in services to all levels of government.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Using INS estimates developed by Robert Warren, the Urban Institute
estimated that in October, 1994 there will be about four million illegal aliens
in the US, with 85 percent in seven states (MN, May 1994).  The number of
illegal immigrants is believed to be increasing by 300,000 annually.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>In the case of California, Urban Institute calculations for 1992 suggest
that California spent $1.8 billion on prisons, education, and health care for
illegal aliens, while California's Department of Finance estimated that $2.4
billion was spent on illegal aliens in 1993-94.  The Urban Institute estimated
that illegal aliens paid $732 million in taxes in 1992, while California
estimated that they paid $528 to $1.4 billion in taxes.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>A similar study released on September 22  by the Center for Immigration
Studies, also in Washington DC,  found that in 1992, immigrants produced a
national deficit of $29 billion.  David Simcox and George High argue that the
Urban Institute used a very conservative figure for the number of undocumented
residents and inflated their tax revenues.  The CIS study estimated that there
are 22 million foreign-born residents in 1992, or seven million more than the
Urban Institute.  This means that costs associated with illegal immigrants
would be substantially higher, which also means that the amount the immigrants
contribute in tax revenues is about $7 billion to high. </tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC9">
SOS in California</a>
</a></h2>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Proposition 187, Save Our State, on the November 8 California ballot would
amend California's constitution to deny benefits such as public
education--there are believed to be 300,000 illegal immigrant children in
California schools-- and social services to illegal aliens, require state and
local government employees to report suspected illegal aliens to the Attorney
General and the INS, and make it a state felony to produce or distribute false
documents.  Those campaigning for and against SOS are emphasizing its symbolic
message to the rest of the US--its passage would, they believe, send a signal
that the federal government should get serious and do something to reduce
illegal immigration.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Proponents of SOS argue that the alternative to SOS is doing nothing,
meaning that illegal immigration would continue.  Governor Wilson made this
argument on September 15, when he endorsed SOS, and promised to campaign for
its passage.  According to Wilson, the major benefit of SOS would be to
generate lawsuits that would force the US Supreme Court to re-examine its 1982
decision that states must educate illegal alien children in public
schools.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Opponents make two arguments.  Some acknowledge that though illegal
immigration is a problem, the SOS approach of denying social services to
children and other illegal residents is not the best way to deal with it.
Others argue that illegal immigration has not been proven to be a problem, and
that SOS is a xenophobic reaction to the changing state's demography--shortly
after the year 2000, a majority of California residents will be non-white,
largely because of immigration.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Democratic gubernatorial candidate Kathleen Brown on September 13
acknowledged that illegal immigration is a fair and legitimate issue facing
California, but she opposes SOS.  Mexican Deputy Foreign Minister Rozenthal on
September 14 in Los Angeles assured SOS opponents that the Mexican government
would "work closely" with them to defeat the initiative.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Two recent polls of California voters show that SOS is supported by about
two-thirds of the voters.  The Field Poll released September 26, 1994 found
that 57 percent of voters supported the measure and 31 percent did not.  A Los
Angeles Times poll released on September 14 found that SOS was leading among
registered voters 62 to 29 percent, and 52 to 42 percent among Hispanics
registered to vote.  One third of those surveyed said that they supported SOS
because "we've got to do something about illegal immigration."  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Los Angeles Times Poll director John Brennan warned that many voters remain
uninformed about the details of the initiative and that neither side has begun
what are expected to be intensive campaigns.   </tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC10">English-only
Rule Upheld by Supreme Court</a></h2>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The US Supreme Court let stand a lower court ruling that English-only
workplace rules do not discriminate against Spanish-speaking employees.
Employees Garcia and Buitrago sued Spun Steak in San Francisco after the meat
and poultry company imposed an English-only rule on its 30 employees in 1990.
The district court found that English-only rules violate federal anti-bias
rules, but the Court of Appeals reversed the district court, holding that, in
this case, most of the 30 employees were bilingual, so Spun Steak did not
violate their rights when it required them to speak English at work.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Such rules may be illegal if the workforce does not speak English.  One
result of the Garcia v. Spun Steak ruling is that employees have been calling
for employer-subsidized English classes. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Some legal scholars argue the English-only workplace rules violate the 1964
Civil Rights Act, which prohibits discrimination based on national origin.
However, federal appeals court decisions have made proving employment
discrimination based on national origin extremely difficult.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Many cities and states have considered or adopted English-only rules.  In
Allentown, Pennsylvania, the City Council passed an ordinance on September 7
declaring English as the city's official language.  The ordinance made English
the official language of all city business, except when federal or state law
requires otherwise.  Allentown's Latinos feel that the action is a "slap to
their community;" Latinos are about 12 percent of the city's 100,000 residents.
</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>English was made the official language of Dade County, Florida government
in the early 1980s.  The statute was overturned in 1993, but poll after poll
indicates that white voters in FL do not want more immigrants.  Florida
Governor Lawton Chiles is up for re-election, and observers say that his
declaration of an immigration emergency and his suits to have the costs of
immigration reimbursed have helped him.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Two bills that are now in the US House of Representatives Labor and
Education Committee would make English the official language of the US and
mandate that government business be conducted in English. One of the bills
would require the Immigration and  Naturalization  Service to create standards
of English proficiency that all prospective citizens would have to pass, and
eliminate bilingual education and bilingual ballots.  Proponents of the bills
deny that they are anti-immigrant or targeted at Hispanics; they argue that the
bills encourage immigrants to learn English and promote their integration

Unions and Immigration Policy</a></h2>
<tt>The AFL-CIO Executive Council has called for a re-examination of the
employer sanctions provisions of IRCA and the defeat of the SOS initiative in
California.  The AFL-CIO said in a statement that the impacts of illegal
immigration on states and cities have "been grossly exaggerated," and that
immigrants are being used as a scapegoat for "the general deterioration of
employment opportunities and wages."</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>According to the Executive Council, sanctions have led in some instances to
discrimination against US citizens and legal immigrants, as employers shun
hiring them in order to avoid penalties for hiring illegal workers.  Other
employers prefer to hire unauthorized workers to take advantage of their
illegal status.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The AFL-CIO recommended that the Justice Department step up its enforcement
of IRCA's anti-discrimination provisions, and that DOL stop checking on the
immigrant status (under current policy, DOL inspectors refer suspected
unauthorized workers to INS as they check for minimum wage and overtime
violations).  The AFL-CIO also recommended that border controls be improved,
and that a fraud-proof, non-discriminatory, non-card system [be developed]to
enable employers to verify very quickly every new hire's eligibility."</tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC14">Russian
Immigration Controls</a>
</a></h2>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The government of Russia passed two resolutions on September 8 aimed at
developing measures to control immigration into the Russian Federation and
spelling out the powers and duties of the Federal Migration Service.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The resolution said that  immigration control is under the purview of the
Federal Migration Service: it is responsible for regulating migration,
preventing illegal migration, and considering petitions for asylum.  The
Russian Federal Migration Service and other government agencies affected by
migration have been given several months to develop proposals on:  bilateral
and multilateral agreements between Russia, the CIS States, Latvia, Lithuania
and Estonia to prevent uncontrolled migration by foreign citizens; quotas for
those seeking asylum in Russia; and the establishment of Russian Federal
Migration Service offices in the "near and far abroad."  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The staff of the Foreign Ministry and the Federal Migration Service  will
be increased and 12 centers for the temporary housing of immigrations will be
created.  All foreign citizens requesting asylum in Russia will be housed in
temporary housing centers until a decision on their case has been made.  The
deputy director of the Federal Migration Service announced at an early
September press conference that the FMS will soon be setting up immigration
control posts at border checkpoints. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The Federal Migration Service estimates that there are 500,000 illegal
immigrants in Russia, primarily from CIS countries as well as Iraq, Iran,
Somalia, Ethiopia, Afghanistan and Sri Lanka.  Many of them receive no help
from the Russian government.  Most fear that any protest on their part will
lead to expulsion.  Recognizing the problem, the Russian Federal Migration
Service wants to impose stricter visa requirements for those from the former
Soviet republics and develop a streamlined procedure for granting refugee
status. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Scams are springing up in Russia as immigration consultants promise to help
those eager to go West.  One consultant charged $8,000 per person for a family
to emigrate, and forced them to sign over their apartment to the smuggler as
payment.  The Canadian embassy in Moscow advises those interested in emigrating
to never pay more $1,000 for services.  But Russians traditionally do not trust
the bureaucracy and can be easy targets for unscrupulous immigration
consultants. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>According to the Federal Migration Service , about 104,000 Russians
emigrated in 1990, but only 60,000 to 80,000 per year leave today.  Most
emigrants are well-educated, and include Jews, Armenians, ethnic Greeks and
Germans, who have immigration rights to Israel, Greece, and Germany.</tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC15">Immigration
and Germany's Elections</a>
</a></h2>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>On October 16, German voters will choose a new Parliament.  The Christian
Democratic Union and its sister Bavarian party, the Christian Social Union,
have an election platform that acknowledges the enriching role that foreigners
provide, but states that "Germany  is not an  immigration country" and will not
grant automatic citizenship to children of foreign parents born on its
territory, or dual citizenship to foreigners.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>SDP candidate Ruldof Scharping had carried a gloom and doom message to
Washington DC in April, warning that unemployment and the large number of
foreigners in the country could lead to a xenophobic backlash in an economic
downturn.  But Gross Domestic Product in Germany grew an unexpected 2.3
percent; boosting Kohl 18 percentage points to lead Scharping in the polls by 8
percent this summer. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The SPD asserts that Germany is in fact an immigration country and supports
an immigration law to manage migration.  The SPD platform asserts that
foreigners should have the right to vote in local elections.  The SPD also
supports allowing the children of foreigners born in Germany to automatically
receive German citizenship.  In addition, the SDP would ease naturalization
procedures and permit dual citizenship.    </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The FDP favors controlled immigration based on an immigration law that
would establish annual quotas.  Like the SPD, the FDP wants to promote the
integration of immigrants, reform the law granting German nationality, and
introduce dual citizenship. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The Green Party views Germany as an immigration country and supports a
"multicultural society."  In order to become integrated, immigrants need legal
and political equality; this would include easier naturalization procedures and
the option for dual citizenship.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>There are also several small right wing parties on the ballot, the
strongest of which is the Republicans.  The Republicans do not want any
immigration, believing that the "German identity" is threatened by immigrants
and foreigners.  </tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC16">Czech
Republic Releases Report on Permanent Residents</a>
</a></h2>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>A new report released by the Czech government on September 12 says that
there were 77,688 foreigners with long-term or permanent residence in the
republic last year. About 18,000 more received permanent or long-term residency
the first part of 1994.  There were only 5,000 requests for refugee status
since 1990.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>In the first six months of 1994, 620 refugee requests were made, primarily
from citizens of Bulgaria and countries of the former Soviet Union.  Only 63
were granted refugee status.  The Interior Ministry has 14 humanitarian centers
which accommodated 1,417 people at the end of June, 1994.   Half of those with
temporary asylum in the Republic are children under 16 or people over 55.  A
total of 14,350 illegal immigrants were discovered or arrested in the first
half of the year.  Nearly 90 percent of the illegal immigrants come from the
former Yugoslavia, Bulgaria and Romania.  Entrance into the Czech Republic at
the 109 border crossings was denied to 35,738 foreigners. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The Czech Interior Minister says that it is vital that a Czech-German
readmission agreement be drawn up or the republic "could turn into a rubbish
pool for the countries participating in the Schengen Agreement."  The agreement
is expected to be signed after the October 16th German parliamentary elections.
The Czech Republic expects about 60 million marks ($93 million US) over three
years beginning in 1995, to help mitigate the effects of immigration, improve
the border police's technical equipment, and set up a central data system for
the foreigners' police and asylum department. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The Interior Minister says that the accord draws attention to the need for
a Pan-European system of returning illegal immigrants to their country of
origin.  He adds that historically, Germany has acted as Europe's buffer
because of its location, but with the signing of the Schengen Agreement, the
buffer moves to the East, toward the Czech Republic and Poland.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The Czech government does not expect the number illegal immigrants returned
from Germany to be significant.  In the first half of 1994, 1,500 were
returned.  The first half of 1993 saw 19,000 returned, and 11,000 were returned
in the second half of the year.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The agreement between Germany and the Czech Republic will change the
readmission time from the former seven days to six months.  That means that
illegal immigrants found further in the interior of Germany can be returned.
The Czech Republic would like to sign an agreement with Hungary and Slovakia so
that it can return immigrants to those countries.  Germany signed such an
agreement in September with Bulgaria.  </tt><p>

Recruits 17,000 Indonesian Workers</a>
</a></h2>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The Development Minister of Malaysia has requested that Indonesia provide
17,000 agricultural workers for the oil palm plantations.  The Development
Minister said that the Malaysian government would only accept workers with
legal documents and would stop illegal workers from entering the country.
</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The senior director of United Plantations, Datuk Seri B. Bek-Nielsen, said
that in the future, oil palm production will shift from Malaysia to Indonesia,
South and Central America, the Philippines, Papua New Guinea and West Africa,
primarily because of labor shortages in Malaysia.  The children of plantation
workers no longer remain on the estates; today, they seek manufacturing jobs.
</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The oil palm plantations currently employ several hundred thousand foreign
workers, primarily from Indonesia and Bangladesh.  These workers, says the
senior director for United Plantations, are not as disciplined or committed to
the plantation as the Indian workers who remained with an estate for
generations.  Extraction rates in Malaysia are about two percent lower due to
worker inefficiency, particularly a lack of harvesting discipline and failure
to collect loose fruits.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>World oil palm production is expected to increase from 14 million tons in
1994 to 20 million tons in 2000 and 36 million tons in 2020.  Malaysia's palm

Britain and  Germany also objected to strongly to the suggestion that families

language urging governments to 'recognize the right of family reunification'
might be used to challenge immigration laws.</tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC25">Tariffs
and Foreign Workers Effect Australian Wages</a>
</a></h2>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>A report on the effect of lower tariffs by the Australian Reserve Bank
found that Australian and American workers who remain in import-competing
industries have been forced to accept lower wages in order to be competitive
with foreign workers. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Economists Jerome Fahrer and Andrew Pease found that only one industry
satisfied the expectations of theory, that low tariffs, and thus low prices,
would lead to the decline of import-competing industries and lower real wages
for unskilled workers.  Clothing and footwear manufacturers, as expected, cut
employment by one-third.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Others industries reduced their employment, but not in response to a fall
in the price of imports--manufacturing employment fell fastest in industries in
which foreign competition is not important.  Increased productivity has been
the main cause of job losses in Australian manufacturing in the past decade.
Instead of falling wages, Australian manufacturers responded to lower tariffs
by raising productivity. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Another study by the Center for Population and Urban Research at
Melbourne's Monash University,  found that Australia's immigration policies are

<tt></tt><p>
<tt>This monograph notes that the immigration of one million persons annually
is making immigration a major issue at the end of the 20th century, as it was
at the beginning.  Incoming foreigners differ from native-born Americans in
several ways, notably in that they are much more likely not to have finished
high school, or, alternatively, to have had a graduate school education than
are Americans.  They are also ethnically different from the native
population--over 80 percent of all immigrants today are from Latin America and
Asia. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>There are four major categories of newcomers to the US--legal immigrants,
legal nonimmigrants, refugees and asylees, and unauthorized migrants.  Four
waves of immigration over the course of US history are described, highlighting
the similarities and differences between the current fourth and earlier waves.
</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The monograph explains how recently created legal categories--entrants,
family fairness, and temporary protected status, for example--contribute to one
of the paradoxes of immigration--most "immigrants" are already in the US when
the US government recognizes them as immigrants.  Fourth-wave immigrants are
concentrated in a few states and cities--Los Angeles has replaced New York as
the chief port of entry through which most of today's immigrants begin their
life in America.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Most immigrants come to the US because it offers better economic
opportunities than at home.  The individuals who come to the US generally
become better off than those still at home.  Their effects on the US economy
and labor market are not, however, unambiguously positive.  Case studies show
that unskilled immigrants, especially if they are unauthorized, may displace
similar Americans and depress their wages.  Mexican immigrants, for example,
now do the work that black janitors used to do in Los Angeles.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Econometric studies that tried to measure the effects of immigrants in
cities such as Los Angeles, however, could find few of the wage depression and
job displacement effects that were apparent in case studies.  Initially, it was
believed that the failure to measure these effects meant that they did not
exist; more recent analyses emphasize that mobile Americans move away from
immigrant cities or do not move to them.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The one point of agreement among economists is that even 10 to 12 million
immigrant workers have only small economic effects in the 130 million strong
labor force.  The US will not get rich and it will not get poor because of
immigration--or the lack of it.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Some of the most contentious questions provoked by immigration are
non-economic:  are immigrants learning English fast enough?  Is their low rate
of naturalization appropriate?  Do naturalized citizens vote?</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>As in earlier eras, there are those who worry that newcomers are not
integrating quickly enough into American civic culture, while others point to
America's historical experience.  Typically, by the third generation, the civic
participation of immigrant descendants is similar to other Americans.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The United States is not alone in worrying about the uncertain destination
to which today's immigration is taking us.  Germany, a country with a
population one-third as big as the US, has also taken one million immigrants
annually over the past few years, making immigration a major political issue.
Only 1 in 100 people in Japan are foreigners, but that country too is engaged
in a serious debate over how do deal with an aging and slow growing labor force
at home, and workers eager to migrate from nearby nations.  </tt><p>

<tt></tt><p>
<tt>This very ambitious two-part book surveys migration for employment around
the world, includes an overview global migration table, and highlights the
migration experience of 20 countries.  Part 1 provides a history and general
overview of the issues raised by people crossing borders for jobs, and Part 2
highlights the migration experience of 20 countries.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The book reflects an admirable survey of the literature, and is especially
valuable for pulling together conclusions on everything from the effects of
indentured servants to the costs and benefits of illegal immigrants.  However,
this breadth can also be a weakness, since an overview may miss important
subpoints.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The book opens with definitions of five major types of border crossers:
settlers, contract workers, professionals, illegal immigrants, and refugees and
asylum seekers.  However, Stauker emphasizes that "migrants are human beings to
whom labels need not stick for very long." (p. 3).  Most people move to better
their economic prospects, and they follow their networks to particular
destinations rather than simply moving to the richest destination, so more
Bangladeshis move to Malaysia for employment than to Japan, even though Japan's
per capita GDP was 10 times Malaysia's in 1992.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Stalker provides brief reviews of the history of labor migration.  The
Portuguese began to enslave Africans in 1442, but it was only after 1550, when
African slaves were first taken to the Caribbean, that the "peculiar
institution" was established firmly in the new world, to be followed by some 15
million African slaves (most scholars estimate that 10 to 11 million slaves
crossed the Atlantic, excluding perhaps one million who died en route).
</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Alongside both slaves and indentured workers were European emigrants
dislodged by the agricultural revolution in Europe, but not yet absorbed in the
factories of the industrial revolution.  Stalker repeats the hypothesis that
emigration peaked about 30 years after the onset of the industrial revolution
in each of the European countries, and the industrial revolution in turn is
dated from when a country had 1,000 km of railroad track.  Almost 48 million
Europeans left between 1846 and 1924, equivalent to about 12 percent of
Europe's 1900 population.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Stalker reviews briefly theories of why people move, concluding that the
push-pull-network framework is most useful when applied to individuals and
households.  He emphasizes that the income gap between rich and poor countries
widened over the past three decades, and that there will be striking
discrepancies in labor force growth between neighboring regions that differ in
wealth.  The EU/EFTA labor force, for example, is projected to rise by one
percent in the 1990s, while the labor force of the southern and eastern
Mediterranean is projected to increase by 27 percent (p. 27).  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Disruptions on the path to successful development can produce migration
humps, or temporarily more emigration and, according to Stalker, export
processing zones are especially prone to stimulate emigration.  However,
Stalker agrees with the assertion that "virtually all the international labor
flows in this century have been deliberately initiated by the industrialized
countries" (p. 29).  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>However, after labor recruitment sets migration in motion, it can take on a
life of its own.  In the Middle East and Asia, recruitment agents handle most
of the workers going abroad, extracting from them fees that can be as much as
one-third of their first year's pay.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Stalker then turns to the costs and benefits of labor migration.  He notes
that immigration, even on a large scale, cannot make aging populations young
again, since immigrants tend to be only a bit younger than the median resident.
In other words, immigrants are unlikely to ever again have the demographic
impacts on their host areas that they did in 19th century North and South
America.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>There are three major economic impacts of temporary and permanent migrant
workers:  their effects on jobs and wages, their effects on economic growth and
productivity, and their effects on the distribution of income and wealth.
Stalker deals only with the jobs and wages issue, concluding on p. 53-4 that
there is little or no displacement, at least in the long run, and that there is
little evidence that the wages of citizen workers are depressed.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>According to Stalker, "there seems in principle to be no reason
why...immigrants might take jobs from native workers (p. 51)...nor will
bringing in immigrants at the bottom of the ladder necessarily reduce the ages
of natives."  (p. 53).  These are curious conclusions, since economic theory
predicts that additional workers must depress wages or displace workers, at
least in the short run.  The important question is how much, and in the
evidence reviewed by Stalker, the answer seems to be that there is not much
wage depression or job displacement. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Stalker's review of the evidence fairly reflects the literature of the
1980s, when there was high immigration and job growth.  The 1990s literature,
by contrast, has a different tone.  Studies of the effects of even large number
of immigrants entering local labor markets, such as the 125,000 Cubans adding
seven percent to Miami's labor force in the early 1980s, typically find little
wage depression and labor displacement.  This led many, including Stalker, to
conclude that there were no such effects.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>But now the evidence seems to suggest that the wage depression and labor
displacement predicted by economic theory were real, and the problem was one of
measuring these effects.  For example, it has been suggested that the mobile
and unskilled American labor force moves out of areas in which there are large
numbers of immigrants, or does not move to such areas.  In other words, the
final chapter on the effects of immigrants on the labor market has not yet been
written.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Stalker does not deal with the effects of immigration on productivity or
inequality, although most of the recent articles on growing inequality in the
US list large-scale immigration as one of the three or four factors promoting
inequality.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Stalker deals briefly with what may be the major issue raised by the
economic impacts of immigrants--should immigration be treated as a way for
individuals to better themselves, or is it seen as a threat to disadvantaged
natives and to the ideal of equality.  Stalker gives greater weight to
immigrant opportunity when he discusses the foreign maids whose presence
permits better educated women to hold jobs outside the home in industrial
countries (p. 52).  Others might give more weight to equality and the avoidance
of the appearance of a class of helots.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Stalker deals briefly with the issue of whether immigrants pay more in
taxes than they cost in public services.  Most of the discussion centers on the
US debate, and Stalker concludes that there is as yet "no clear picture...on
the welfare effect of immigrants."  What is clear, however, is that regardless
of the disputed overall balance of taxes paid and costs of services received,
in the US fiscal system, immigrant taxes tend to flow to the federal
government, while the cost of the services consumed by these mostly young
people are borne by state and local governments.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Stalker touches at least briefly on most of the issues raised by
immigration, from the two major ways of granting citizenship--jus sanguinis, or
the principle that all persons born whose father, or, in some cases, mother, is
a citizen is also a citizen, a system that reportedly evolved from defining
membership in non-immigrant nomadic societies(p63).  Jus soli, by contrast,
grants citizenship to all persons born in the territory, and is more common in
immigrant societies such as the US, Canada, and Latin America.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Similarly, there are two different approaches to naturalizing immigrants.
Canada and Sweden, for example, encourage immigrants to become citizens to
promote their integration, while Germany and Switzerland tend to see awarding
citizenship as a reward for successful integration.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Stalker discusses various approaches to integrating foreigners, from
assimilation to multiculturalism, and concludes that race is the greatest
barrier to any kind of integration--anti-immigrant parties, he asserts, spring
up when there are "too many" non-white immigrants (p. 75).  Mainstream
politicians then feel compelled to adopt some of the anti-immigrant parties'
rhetoric, or find their rhetoric to be a convenient excuse to hint at
anti-foreigner sentiments in a more moderate way themselves.  Religious
differences can add to native-immigrant tension, as Muslim immigrants
reportedly do in Europe.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The broad scope of this book is illustrated by its discussion of language,
education, and economic mobility.  Stalker emphasizes that immigrants begin a
the bottom of the job ladder, and they and their children remain there in part
because of discrimination against them (p. 99).  However, in some cases,
immigrants become entrepreneurs and discriminate by hiring fellow nationals,
aggravating tensions with native residents.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Stalker reviews arguments for controlling immigration, and finds neither
preserving ethnic composition, nor economic worries, nor the cost of resettling
refugees compelling.  He reviews the effects of emigration on sending
countries, discusses three options for immigration countries:  free up trade,
increase foreign investment, and redirect aid to promote stay at home
development.  Neither is likely to have desired migration-reducing effects
quickly,</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The country studies begin with the traditional settlement countries of the
US, Canada, and Australia, then turn to Western Europe, Eastern Europe, Latin
America, Sub-Saharan Africa, the Gulf states, and Asia.  In every case, there
is a review of the number of immigrants, a discussion of immigration policy,
and an assessment of the current immigration debate.  For example, the
discussion of Malaysia notes that it is simultaneously a labor exporter and
importer, and that indentured worker immigration during British colonial rule
gave the country a population that is about 60 percent Malay, 30 percent
Chinese, and 10 percent Indian.  Some Chinese Malaysians emigrated after the
government in 1971 launched a program to favor Malays, Stalker concludes by
noting that the widespread illegal immigration of mostly Muslims is a
potentially explosive issue in a country in which one requirement for being a
Malay is to be a Muslim.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The book concludes with a global migration table that lists, for 98
countries, whether they send at least two percent and 200,000 of their
nationals abroad, or whenever they receive foreigners, meaning that at least
two percent of their populations and 200,000 residents are non-citizens, or at
least one percent of their labor forces and 100,000 workers are non-citizens.
Under these criteria, 24 countries are both sending and receiving countries,
including most of the former USSR member-states and surprises such as Haiti and
Jamaica.  According to the table, the major country of emigration is Russia,
with 25 million nationals abroad. </tt><p>

<tt></tt><p>
<tt>In 1990, 40 percent of the elderly immigrants sponsored by their US
resident and often US citizen children were receiving Supplemental Security
Income, versus nine percent of the US elderly.  SSI is a cash assistance
program that typically provides about $400 monthly to the aged, blind, and
disabled; some states, including California, supplement SSI, bringing the
average monthly payment to $600.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>There has been a very sharp increase in the percentage of elderly
immigrants receiving SSI--the number of such recipients quintupled between 1982
and 1992.  When elderly parents join their US resident children who "sponsor"
them, both the sponsoring child and the immigrating parent must sign an
affidavit of support on INS form I-134 stating that the child will support the
immigrating parents and the parents will avoid applying for welfare.  However,
the courts have ruled that these affidavits are not binding and, after three
years, elderly immigrants without other assets are eligible for SSI.  In the
case of many elderly Asian immigrants, the majority soon apply for SSI.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Based on interviews with elderly immigrants and social workers, Matloff
describes how the children sponsoring their parents plan to get them on SSI as
soon as possible.  Matloff decries what he considers to be an organized
subversion of the US immigration and welfare systems by often professional
Asians who have "made it" in America.  </tt><p>
