<H2>TOPEX/POSEIDON IS HELPING MARINE BIOLOGISTS STUDY WHALES</H2>
<p>
<h3>
Marine biologists aboard a ship in the Gulf of Mexico are 
using maps of ocean currents produced with data from the 
ocean-observing satellite TOPEX/Poseidon to help them locate and count 
sperm whales and dolphins.
<p>
       The TOPEX/Poseidon altimeter data, combined with information 
from the European Space Agency's ERS-2 satellite, are being used in 
near-real-time to generate circulation feature maps that will be faxed 
to scientists aboard the research ship R/V Gyre. These maps provide 
scientists with timely information about rapidly changing ocean 
features so that scientists can direct the ship toward those areas to 
determine if whales and dolphins are present.
<p>
         "There is evidence that whales prefer to feed in the edges of 
cyclonic eddies, and the satellite data give us a good picture of 
where those oceanographic features are located," said Dr. George Born, 
a principal investigator on the TOPEX/Poseidon project from the 
University of  Colorado at Boulder.
<p>
        The university is generating the ocean maps and sending them 
directly to the scientists in the Gulf.  "The data from TOPEX/Poseidon 
and ERS-2 greatly enhances our ability to identify and map circulation 
features as they occur in the Gulf," said Dr. Robert Leben, a 
co-principal investigator on the project at the University of Colorado 
at Boulder.
<p>
         The R/V Gyre left Pascagoula, Mississippi, on October 10 and 
will survey the northeastern Gulf of Mexico until October 28.   A 
previous survey indicated that whales and dolphins were contacted most 
frequently in the area where warm water eddies break off from the Gulf 
Loop Current, a strong ocean current that circulates around the Gulf 
of Mexico.
<p>
       "The goal of our cruise is to make a visual and acoustic census 
of marine mammals and to define their physical and biological habitat 
in the northeastern Gulf in areas potentially affected by oil and gas 
activities now or in the future," said Dr. Randall Davis, head of the 
Marine Biology department at Texas A & M University at Galveston. 
"Altimeter data like that from TOPEX/Poseidon are the only information 
that enable on-site adjustments to the cruise plan to optimize the 
survey track, ultimately saving us time and money."
<p>
        The TOPEX/Poseidon satellite was developed to study global 
ocean circulation but it is providing unexpected benefits for marine 
biologists. "We are very excited that these data are being used in new 
and different ways.  Scientists are continuing to find new
applications for this project and are proving they can study not only 
ocean currents, but also the creatures that inhabit the oceans," said 
Dr. Lee-Lueng Fu, TOPEX/Poseidon project scientist at NASA's Jet 
Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, CA.
<p>
        The TOPEX/Poseidon satellite uses an altimeter to bounce radar 
signals off the ocean's surface to get precise measurements of the 
distance between the satellite and the sea surface.  These data are 
combined with measurements from other instruments that pinpoint the 
satellite's exact location in space.  Every 10 days, scientists are 
able to produce a complete map of global ocean topography, the barely 
perceptible hills and valleys found on the sea surface.  With detailed 
knowledge of ocean topography, scientist can then calculate the speed 
and direction of worldwide ocean currents.
<p>
        The R/V Gyre expedition is sponsored by Texas A & M 
University,  the Texas Institute of Oceanography and the National 
Biological Service.
<p>
        TOPEX/Poseidon is a joint mission of NASA and the French space 
agency, the Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales (CNES).  The Jet 
Propulsion Laboratory manages the U.S. portion of the mission for 
NASA's Office of Mission to Planet Earth, Washington, DC.  The Mission 
to Planet Earth is a long-term, coordinated research effort to study 
the Earth as a global environmental system.
