<H3>Become a Surrogate Mother and help create a family for an infertile couple.
</H3><P>For many couples, surrogacy is a last hope to have a child.
<P>Being a surrogate mother offers a woman a chance to share the joy of
parenthood, experience pregnancy again, do something that makes a difference,
and changes the lives of the couple she chooses.
<P>The Center for Surrogate Parenting &amp; Egg Donation, Inc. (CSP) offers
an "Open" Program in which you choose and meet your couple. You are in contact
with them throughout the pregnancy, and will remain so after the birth with
pictures, letters, etc.
<P>CSP provides coordination of all aspects of the surrogacy arrangement.
Our goal is to provide care, protection and guidance to each person involved
in the experience. This includes having a counselor assigned to your case
during and after your participation in the program, and providing monthly
support group meetings where you will meet with other surrogate mothers.
<P>To quote a recent Surrogate Mother:
<BLOCKQUOTE><I>Seeing the couple's faces light up when their baby was born,
I know I gave someone such a precious gift of a lifetime. The Mom is always
telling me I'm her guardian angel. I hope other Surrogates accomplish the
same satisfaction I did</I>.
