<p>U.S. Department of Justice </p>

<p>Drug Enforcement Administration </p>

<p>Rocky Mt. Division </p>

<p>115 Inverness Drive East </p>

<p>Englewood, CO 80112 </p>

<p>(303) 784-6300 </p>

<p>The Honorable Don Ament, Chairman </p>

<p>Agriculture, Natural Resources &amp; Energy Committee </p>

<p>Senate Chambers </p>

<p>State Capitol Building </p>

<p>200 East Colfax Ave. </p>

<p>Denver, Colorado 80203 </p>

<p>Dear Senator Ament: </p>

<p>I am taking this opportunity to offer , for the record, the
Drug Enforcement Administration's views on Senate Bill 95-132,
&quot;Hemp Reclassification&quot; which is currently before your
Committee. </p>

<p>As the Special Agent in Charge of DEA's Rocky Mountain Field
Division, I am charged with enforcement of the Federal Controlled
Substances Act (CSA) in Colorado. In this capacity, it is
imperative that I advise you that the &quot;Hemp Reclassification
Bill&quot;, which attempts to legalize the production of the
Cannabis Sativa or Cannabis Indicia, providing the THC content is
under 1.4%, violates both the letter and the spirit of the CSA. </p>

<p>Under 21 USC 812 (c) (10), marijuana is a Schedule I
controlled substance, regardless of the percentage of THC
content. The production, distribution or dispensing of marijuana
is a felony under federal law pursuant to 21 USC 841. The
possession of marijuana is also a federal criminal offense under
21 USC 844. </p>

<p>As you are no doubt aware, in cases where Federal and state
law are in opposition, the question of which law would control is
well settled. In view of these facts, passage of the &quot;Hemp
Reclassification Bill&quot; would have the effect of leading
otherwise law abiding farmers down the road to the commission of
a felony, under the color of a seriously misguided state statute.
If even one honest farmer faces such a dilemma, it would be an
insupportable miscarriage of justice. </p>

<p>Beyond the bare facts of the matter on the legality of what
this Bill attempts to do, its passage would send a harmful and
dysfunctional message to the people of the State of Colorado. A
recent nationwide survey conducted by the University of Michigan
has shown that the use of marijuana by the nation's school
children is on the rise. Enactment of this legislation would add
the force of a Colorado statute to the perception that marijuana
is &quot;OK.&quot; </p>

<p>And let us be clear that what we are talking about in this
Bill is marijuana. Calling it &quot;hemp&quot; on the basis of an
artificial threshold level of psychoactive ingredient does not
erase the fact that it is botanically and legally the same plant.
An illegal drug by any other name is still an illegal drug. </p>

<p>The threshold level of THC content which the Bill proposes as
the imaginary dividing line between marijuana and hemp
communicates another delusional message. No less an authority
than Dr. Charles Ksir of the University of Wyoming points out
that the marijuana sold of the streets is the 1960s and 1970s was
of this strength. To think that those interested in the criminal
use and distribution of marijuana would forsake the
&quot;hemp&quot; as defined by the Bill is altogether naive. </p>

<p>The claims of the Bill's proponents that Colorado would derive
some economic benefit from the commercial production of Cannabis
are equally deceptive. In the words of Joseph E. Atchison, Ph.D.,
an international consultant to the pulp and paper industry,
&quot;...it would make far more sense for U.S. Industry to
consider returning to the use of agricultural residues which are
grown for other purposes, such as wheat straw, seed grass straw
and grain sorghum stalks, rather than attempting to grow a plant
just for its fiber content, such as kenaf and hemp.&quot; </p>

<p>Although I am not an expert in the economics of crop
production, I believe that my 31 years as a federal drug agent
make me an expert in drug law enforcement. From that standpoint I
can tell you that, in my professional opinion, this legislation
is no more than a shallow ruse being advanced by those who seek
to legalize marijuana. The people of Colorado deserve to be
protected from this sort of subterfuge. </p>

<p>The federal criminal law on this subject does provide such
protection and will be enforced with all the vigor at DEA's
command. </p>

<p>Thank you for giving consideration to my statements on this
matter. </p>

<p>Sincerely, </p>

<p>Philip W. Perry </p>

<p>Special Agent in Charge <br>
