<p>&quot;The difficulty in life is the choice.&quot; </p>

<p>George Moore (1900) </p>

<p>A constant tension exists in our society between individual
liberties and the need for reasonable societal restraints. It is
easy to go too far in either direction, and this tendency is
particularly evident where drugs are concerned. </p>

<p>We have guided our decision-making by the belief that the
state is obliged to justify restraints on individual behavior.
Too often individual freedoms are submerged in the passions of
the moment, and when that happens, the public policy may be
determined more by rhetoric than by reason. Our effort has been
to minimize the emotional and emphasize the rational in this
Report. </p>

<p><b>Drugs In a Free Society</b> </p>

<p>A free society seeks to provide conditions in which each of
its members may develop his or her potentialities to the fullest
extent. A premium is placed on individual choice in seeking
self-fulfillment. This priority depends upon the capacity of free
citizens not to abuse their freedom, and upon their willingness
to act responsibly toward others and toward the society as a
whole. Responsible behavior, through individual choice, is both
the guarantor and the objective of a free society. <br>
</p>

<p><b>DRUGS AND SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY </b></p>

<p>The use of drugs is not in itself an irresponsible act.
Medical and scientific uses serve important individual and social
needs and are often essential to our physical and mental
well-being. Further, the use of drugs for pleasure or other
non-medical purposes is not inherently irresponsible; alcohol is
widely used as an acceptable part of social activities. </p>

<p>We do think the use of drugs is clearly irresponsible when it
impedes the individual's integration into the economic and social
system. A preference for individual productivity and contribution
to social progress in a general sense still undergirds the
American value structure, and we emphasize the policy-maker's
duty to support this preference in a public policy judgment. </p>

<p>At the same time, in light of the emerging leisure ethic and
the search for individual meaning and fulfillment noted in
Chapter 1, we cannot divorce social policy from the questions
raised by the recreational use of drugs. Productivity and
recreation both have a place in the American ethical system. They
are not inconsistent unless the individual's use of leisure time
inhibits his productive role in society. </p>

<p>Drugs should be servants, not masters. They become masters
when they dominate an individual's existence or impair his
faculties. To the extent that any drug, including alcohol,
carries with it risks to the well-being of the user and seriously
undermines his effectiveness in the society, that drug becomes a
matter of concern for public policy. </p>

<p>An essential step in the process of policy-formation is a
determination of the circumstances under which use of any given
drug' poses such risks. For some drugs, the risks may be so great
that all permissible measures should be taken to eliminate use.
For other drugs, such risks may be present only under certain
specific circumstances, in which case society may defer to
responsible individual choice on the matter of recreational use
but take appropriate steps to minimize the incidence and
consequences of dysfunctional use. In our Report next year, for
which studies are already underway, we will consider from this
perspective the whole range of drugs now used for non-medical
purposes. </p>

<p>A Social Control Policy for Marihuana </p>

<p>In formulating a Marihuana policy, our strongest concern is
with irresponsible use, whether it be too often, too much,
indiscriminate, or under improper circumstances. The excessive or
indiscriminate use of any drug is a serious social concern; and
this is particularly true of marihuana since we still know very
little about the effects of long term, heavy use. We have little
doubt that the substantial majority of users, under any social
control policy, including the existing system, do not and would
not engage in irresponsible behavior. </p>

<p>In identifying the -appropriate social control policy for
marihuana, we have found it helpful to consider the following
policy options: </p>

<p>I Approval of Use. </p>

<p>II Elimination of Use. </p>

<p>III Discouragement of Use. </p>

<p>IV Neutrality Toward Use. <br>
</p>

<p>APPROVAL OF USE </p>

<p>Society should not approve or encourage the recreational use
of any drug, in public or private. Any semblance of encouragement
enhances the possibility of abuse and removes, from a
psychological standpoint, an effective support of individual
restraint. </p>

<p>For example, so long as this society (not only the government,
but other institutions and mass advertising as well) in effect
approved of the use of tobacco, the growing medical consensus
about the dangers of excessive use did not make a significant
impression on individual judgment. With the Surgeon General's
Report on Tobacco in 1964, Smoking and Health, a very real change
has occurred in the way society now thinks about cigarettes. </p>

<p>The institutions of society definitely add their influences to
the variety of social pressures which persuade individuals to use
any kind of drugs. Rational social policy should seek to minimize
such social pressures, whether they come from peers, from the
media, from social custom, or from the user's sense of
inadequacy. Official approval would inevitably encourage some
people to use the drug who would not otherwise do so, and would
also increase the incidence of heavy or otherwise irresponsible
use and its complications. On this basis we reject policy option
number one, approval of use. </p>

<p>ELIMINATION OF USE </p>

<p>For a half-century, official social policy has been not only
to discourage use but to eliminate it (option number two). With
the principal responsibility for this policy assigned to law
enforcement, its implementation reached its zenith in the late
1950's and early 1960's when marihuana-related offenses were
punishable by long periods of incarceration. This policy grew out
of a distorted and greatly exaggerated concept of the drug's
ordinary effects upon the individual and the society. On the
basis of information then available, marihuana was not adequately
distinguished from other problem drugs and was assumed to be as
harmful as the others. </p>

<p>The increased incidence of use, intensive scientific
reevaluation, and the spread of use to the middle and upper
socioeconomic groups have brought about the informal adoption of
a modified social policy. On the basis of our opinion surveys and
our empirical studies of law enforcement behavior, we are
convinced that officialdom and the public are no longer as
punitive toward marihuana use as they once were. </p>

<p>Now there exists a more realistic estimate of the actual
social impact of marihuana use. School and university
administrators are seldom able to prevent the use of marihuana by
their students and personnel and are increasingly reluctant to
take disciplinary action against users. Within the criminal
justice system, there has been a marked decline in the severity
of the response to offenders charged with possession of
marihuana. </p>

<p>In our survey of state enforcement activities, only 11% of all
marihuana arrests resulted from active investigative activity,
and most of those were in sale situations. For the most part,
marihuana enforcement is a haphazard process; arrests occur on
the street, in a park, in a car, or as a result of a phone call.
Among those arrested, approximately 50% of the adults and 70% of
the juveniles are not processed through the system; their cases
are dismissed by the police, by the prosecutors or by the courts.
Ultimately less than 6% of all those apprehended are
incarcerated, and very few of these sentences are for possession
of small amounts for personal use. </p>

<p>In the law enforcement community, the major concern is no
longer marihuana but the tendency of some users to engage in
other irresponsible activity, particularly the use of more
dangerous drugs. Official sentiment now seems to be a desire to
contain use of the drug as well as the drug subculture, and to
minimize its spread to the rest of the youth population. Law
enforcement policy, both at the Federal and State levels,
implicitly recognizes that elimination is impossible at this
time. </p>

<p>The active attempt to suppress all marihuana use has been
replaced by an effort to keep it within reasonable bounds. Yet
because this policy still reflects a view that marihuana smoking
is itself destructive enough to justify punitive action against
the user, we believe it is an inappropriate social response. </p>

<p>Marihuana's relative potential for harm to the vast majority
of individual users and its actual impact on society does not
justify a social policy designed to seek out and firmly punish
those who use it. This judgment is based on prevalent, use
patterns, on behavior exhibited by the vast majority of users and
on our interpretations of existing medical and scientific data.
This position also is consistent with the estimate by law
enforcement personnel that the elimination of use is
unattainable. </p>

<p>In the case of experimental or intermittent use of marihuana,
there is room for individual judgment. Some members of our
society believe the decision to use marihuana is an immoral
decision. However, even during Prohibition, when many people were
concerned about the evils associated with excessive use of
alcohol, possession for personal use was never outlawed federally
and was made illegal in only five States. </p>

<p>Indeed, we suspect that the moral contempt in which some of
our citizens hold the marihuana user is related to other behavior
or other attitudes assumed to be associated with use of the drug.
All of our data suggest that the moral views of the overwhelming
majority of marihuana users are in general accord with those of
the larger society. </p>

<p>Having previously rejected the approval policy (option number
one), we now reject the eliminationist policy (option number
two). This policy, if taken seriously, would require a great
increase in manpower and resources in order to eliminate the use
of a drug which simply does not warrant that kind of attention.<br>
</p>

<p>DISCOURAGEMENT OR NEUTRALITY </p>

<p>The unresolved question is whether society should try to
dissuade its members from using marihuana or should defer
entirely to individual judgment in the matter, remaining benignly
neutral. We must choose between policies of discouragement
(number three) and neutrality (number four). This choice is a
difficult one and forces us to consider the limitations of our
knowledge and the dynamics of social change. A number of
considerations, none of which is conclusive by itself, point at
the present time toward a discouragement policy. We will discuss
each one of them separately. </p>

<p>1. User Preference Is Still Ambiguous </p>

<p>Alcohol and tobacco have long been desired by large numbers
within our society and their use is deeply ingrained in the
American culture. Marihuana, on the other hand, has only recently
achieved a significant foothold in the American experience, and
it is still essentially used more by young people. Again, the
unknown factor here is whether the sudden attraction to marihuana
derives from its psychoactive virtues or from its symbolic
status. </p>

<p>Throughout this Commission's deliberations there was a
recurring awareness of the possibility that marihuana use may be
a fad which, if not institutionalized, will recede substantially
in time. Present data suggest that this is the case, and we do
not hesitate to say that we would prefer that outcome. To the
extent that conditions permit, society is well advised to
minimize the number of drugs which may cause significant
problems. By focusing our attention on fewer rather than more
drugs, we may be better able to foster responsible use and
diminish the consequences of irresponsible use. </p>

<p>The more prudent course seems to be to retain a social policy
opposed to use, attempting to discourage use while at the same
time seeking to deemphasize the issue. Such a policy leaves us
with more options available when more definitive knowledge of the
consequences of heavy and prolonged marihuana use becomes
available. </p>

<p>2. Continuing Scientific Uncertainty Precludes Finality </p>

<p>In 1933 when Prohibition was repealed, society was cognizant
of the effects of alcohol as a drug and the adverse consequences
of abuse. But, because so many people wished to use the drug,
policy-makers chose, to run the risk of individual indiscretion
and decided to abandon the abstentionist policy. There are many
today who feel that if the social, impact of alcohol use had then
been more fully understood, a policy of discouragement rather
than neutrality would have been adopted to minimize the negative
aspects of alcohol use. </p>

<p>Misunderstanding also played an important part when the
national government adopted an eliminationist, marihuana policy
in 1937. The policy-makers knew very little about the effects or
social impact of the drug; many of their hypotheses were
speculative and, in large measure, incorrect. </p>

<p>Nevertheless, the argument that misinformation in 1937
automatically compels complete reversal of the action taken at
that time is neither reasonable nor logical. While continuing
concern about the effects of heavy, chronic use is not sufficient
reason to maintain an overly harsh public policy, it is still a
significant argument for choosing official discouragement in
preference to official neutrality. </p>

<p>3. Society's Value System Is In a State of Transition </p>

<p>As discussed in Chapter 1, two central influences in
contemporary American life are the individual search for meaning
within the context of an increasingly depersonalized society, and
the collective search for enduring American values. In Chapter
IV, we noted that society's present ambivalent response to
marihuana use reflects these uncertainties. </p>

<p>For the reasons discussed in the previous Chapters, a sudden
abandonment of an official policy of elimination in favor of one
of neutrality toward marihuana would have a profound
reverberating impact on social attitudes far beyond the one issue
of marihuana use. We believe that society must have time to
consider its image of the future. We believe that adoption of a
discouragement policy toward marihuana at this time would
facilitate such a reappraisal while official neutrality, under
present circumstances, would impede it. </p>

<p>4. Public Opinion Presently Opposes Marihuana Use </p>

<p>For whatever reasons, a substantial majority of the American
public opposes the use of marihuana, and would prefer that their
fellow citizens abstain from using it. In the National Survey,
64% of the adult public agreed with the statement that
&quot;using marihuana is morally offensive` (40% felt the same
way about alcohol). </p>

<p>Although this majority opinion is not by any means conclusive,
it cannot be ignored. We are well aware of the skeptics in with
which marihuana user, and those sympathetic to their wishes, view
the policy making process; and we are particularly concerned
about the indifference to or disrespect for law manifested by
many citizens and particularly the youth. </p>

<p>However, we are also apprehensive about the impact of a major
change in social policy on that larger segment of our population
which supports the implications of the existing social policy.
They, too, might lose respect for a policy-making establishment
which appeared to bend so easily to the wishes of a
&quot;lawless&quot; and highly vocal minority. </p>

<p>This concern for minimizing cultural dislocation must, of
course, be weighed against the relative importance of contrary
arguments. For example, in the case of desegregation in the
South, and now in the North, cult-Lire shock had to be accepted
in the light of the fundamental precept at issue. In the, case.
of marihuana, there is no fundamental principle supporting the
use of the drug, and society is not compelled to approve or be
neutral toward it. The opinion of the majority is entitled to
greater weight. </p>

<p>Looking again to the, experience with Prohibition, when an
abstentionist policy for alcohol was adopted on the national
level in 1918, its proponents were not blind to the vociferous
opposition of a substantial minority of the people. By the late
1920's and early 1930's, the ambivalence of public opinion toward
alcohol use and the unwillingness of large numbers of people to
comply with the new social policy compelled reversal of that
policy. Even many of its former supporters acknowledged its
futility. </p>

<p>With marihuana, however, the prevailing policy of eliminating
use had never been opposed to any significant degree until the
mid-1960's. Unlike the prohibition of alcohol, which had been the
subject of public debate off and on for 60 years before it was
adopted, present marihuana policy has not until now engaged the
public opinion process, some 50 years after it first began to be
used. Majority sentiment does not appear to be as flexible as it
was with alcohol.<br>
</p>

<p>5. Neutrality Is Not Philosophically Compelled </p>

<p>Much of what was stated above bespeaks an acute awareness by
the Commission of the subtleties of the collective consciousness
of the American people, as shown in the National Survey. There is
a legitimate concern about what the majority of the non-using
population thinks about marihuana use and what the drug
represents in the public mind. The question is appropriately
asked if we are suggesting that the majority in a free society
may impose its will on an unwilling minority even though, as it
is claimed, uncertainty, speculation, and a large degree of
misinformation form the basis of the predominant opinion. If we
have nothing more substantial than this, the argument goes,
society should remain neutral. </p>

<p>To deal with this contention, one must distinguish between
ends and means. Policy-makers must choose their objectives with a
sensitivity toward the entire social fabric and a vision of the
good society. In such a decision, the general public attitude is
a significant consideration. The preferred outcome in a
democratic society cannot be that of the policy-makers alone; it
must be that of an informed public. Accordingly, the policy-maker
must consider the dynamic relationship between perception and
reality in the public mind. Is the public consensus based on a
real awareness of the facts? Does the public really understand
what is at stake? Given the best evidence available, would the
public consensus remain the same? </p>

<p>Assuming that dominant opinion opposes marihuana use, the
philosophical issue is raised not by the goal but by how it is
implemented. At this point, the interests of the unwilling become
important. For example, the family unit and the institution of
marriage are preferred means of group-living and child-rearing in
our society. As a society, we are not neutral. We officially
encourage matrimony by giving married couples favorable tax
treatment; but we do not compel people to get married. If it
should become public policy to try to reduce the birth rate, it
is unlikely that there will be laws to punish those who exceed
the preferred family size, although we may again utilize
disincentives through the tax system. Similarly, this Commission
believes society should continue actively to discourage people
from using marihuana, and any philosophical limitation is
relevant to the means employed, not to the goal itself.<br>
</p>

<p>FOR THESE REASONS, WE RECOMMEND TO THE PUBLIC AND ITS
POLICY-MAKERS A SOCIAL CONTROL POLICY SEEKING TO DISCOURAGE
MARIHUANA USE, WHILE CONCENTRATING PRIMARILY ON THE PREVENTION OF
HEAVY AND VERY HEAVY USE. </p>

<p>We emphasize that this is a policy for today and the immediate
future; we do not presume to suggest that this policy embodies
eternal truth. Accordingly, we strongly recommend that our
successor policy planners, at an appropriate time in the future,
review the following factors to determine whether an altered
social policy is in order: the state of public opinion, the
extent to which members of the society continue to use the drug,
the developing scientific knowledge about the effects and social
impact of use of the drug, and the evolving social attitude
toward the place of recreation and leisure in a work-oriented
society. In our second Report next year, we will carefully review
our findings to see if our perceptions have changed or if society
has changed at that time.<br>
</p>

<p>Implementing The Discouragement Policy </p>

<p>Choice of this social control policy does not automatically
dictate any particular legal implementation. As we noted in
Chapter 1, there is a disturbing tendency among participants in
the marihuana debate to assume that a given statement of the
drug's effects, its number of users or its social impact compels
a particular statutory scheme. </p>

<p>Law does not operate in a social vacuum, and it is only one of
the institutional mechanisms which society can utilize to
implement its policies. Consequently, the evaluation of
alternative legal approaches demands not only logic but also a
delicate assessment of the mutual relationship between the law
and other institutions of social control, such as the church, the
family and the school. <br>
</p>

<p>THE ROLE OF LAW IN EFFECTIVE SOCIAL CONTROL </p>

<p>Social control is most effectively guaranteed by the exercise
of individual self-discipline. Elementary social psychology
teaches us that restraint generated within is infinitely more
effective and tenacious than restraint imposed from without. </p>

<p>One of the participants at our &quot;Central Influences&quot;
Seminar observed: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>When people grow up into a society, the principal aim is
    to internalize drives-that is, I assume they come up 'with
    certain drives which can be satisfied in many ways and you're
    trying to internalize, ways of satisfying those drives which
    will be compatible with life in a community and also
    satisfying to the individual. The external restraints can
    only complement this, they cannot possibly substitute for it.
    </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The supplemental effect of external restraints, particularly
legal restraints, must also be weighed against the nature of the
control sought. It was put this way at our Seminar: </p>

<p>Think of the social welfare function as a mountain-the hill of
the Lords really. Large parts of it are something of a plateau;
that is you can be all sorts of places on it and be safe. You
don't have to maximize. This is an economist's fallacy. You can
have all sorts of variations, you can be Socialists, Capitalists,
Mormons, Adventists and get away with it-even Liberals. But there
are cliffs, and you can fall off of them. This is what we are
worrying about today. We are nervous about these cliffs. </p>

<p>The &quot;no-no's&quot;-as the kids call them-are the fences
on these cliffs. That is, we have set up taboos and say there's a
cliff there. Now -one of the problems socially is that we set up
&quot;no-no's&quot; where there are no cliffs. There are no
cliffs and people jump over these [fences] and they say, &quot;No
cliffs! See no cliffs!&quot; [Then, over other fences-and]
chop-chop-chop-crash! See, it's just as dangerous to set up
fences without any cliffs as not have fences where there are
cliffs. </p>

<p>To this functional consideration of external restraint, we
must also add the philosophical faith in the responsible exercise
of individual judgment which is the essence of a free society. To
illustrate, a preference for individual productivity underlies
this society's opposition to indiscriminate drug use, the fact
that so few of the 24 million Americans who have tried marihuana
use it, or have used it, irresponsibly, testifies to the extent
to which they have internalized that value. </p>

<p>The hypothesis that widespread irresponsibility would attend
freer availability of marihuana suggests not that a restrictive
policy is in order but rather that a basic premise of our free
society is in doubt. We note that the escalation thesis, used as
an argument against marihuana rather than as a tool for
understanding individual behavior, is really a manifestation of
skepticism about individual vulnerabilities. For example,
one-half of the public agreed with the statement that &quot;if
marihuana were made legal, it would make drug addicts out of
ordinary people.&quot; </p>

<p>At the same time, we do feel that the threat of excessive use
is most potent with the young. In fact, we think all drug use
should continue to be discouraged among the young, because of
possible adverse effects on psychological development and because
of the lesser ability of this part of the population to
discriminate between limited and excessive use. </p>

<p>Social policy implementation in this regard is extraordinarily
difficult. For example, although existing social policies toward
tobacco, alcohol and marihuana alike oppose their use by the
young, those policies are far from being fully effective. For
example: </p>

<p>Tobacco </p>

<p>The National Survey (1971) indicates that of young people age
12-to-17, </p>

<ul>
    <li>50 % have smoked at one, time or another; </li>
    <li>15% smoke now; and </li>
    <li>At least 8% smoke at least a half a pack a day. </li>
</ul>

<p>In a 1970 sample of smoking habits in the 12-to-18 population
conducted for the National Clearinghouse for Smoking and Health,
it was found that: </p>

<ul>
    <li>18.5% of the boys and 11.9% of the girls were regular
        smokers; and </li>
    <li>About 8% of the boys and 5% of the girls smoked more than
        a half a pack a day. </li>
</ul>

<p>Alcohol </p>

<p>The National Survey also ascertained the drinking pattern
during the previous month of young people aged 12-to-17, finding
that: </p>

<ul>
    <li>At least 23% had used beer during that month, at least
        14% had used wine and at least 12% had used hard liquor;
        and </li>
    <li>6% had used beer five or more days during the months 3%
        had used wine five or more days, and 3% had used hard
        liquor five or more days. </li>
</ul>

<p>Marihuana </p>

<p>Of the 12-to-17 population, the Survey found that: </p>

<ul>
    <li>15% of this population had tried marihuana; </li>
    <li>At least 6 % still use it; and </li>
    <li>Less than 1% use it once a day or more </li>
</ul>

<p>The inclination of so many young people to experiment with
drugs is a reflection of a so-called successful socialization
process on one hand, and of society's ambivalence to the use of
drugs on the other. This entire matter will occupy much of our
attention in the coming year, but it is essential that we make a
few anticipatory comments now. </p>

<p>This nation tries very had to instill in its children
independence, curiosity and a healthy self-assurance. These
qualities guarantee a dynamic, progressive society. Where drugs
are concerned, however, we have relied generally on
authoritarianism and on obedience. Drug education has generally
been characterized by overemphasis of scare tactics. Some
segments of the population have been reluctant to inform for fear
of arousing curiosity in young minds. Where drugs are concerned,
young people are simply supposed to nod and obey. - </p>

<p>This society has always been and continues to be ambivalent
about the non-medical (in the strict sense) use of drugs. And
this ambivalence does not escape our children. If we can come to
grips with this issue, we might convince our youth that the
curiosity that is encouraged in other aspects of our culture is
undesirable where drugs are concerned. </p>

<p>The law is at best a highly imperfect reflection of drug
policy. The laws proscribing sale of tobacco to minors are
largely ignored. Prohibitions of sale of alcohol to minors are
enforced sporadically. As to marihuana, there are areas
throughout this nation where possession laws are not enforced at
all. In other sections, such proscriptions are strictly enforced,
with no apparent decrease in marihuana use. </p>

<p>As a guiding doctrine for parents and children, the law is
certainly confusing when it imposes widely varying punishments in
different states, and even in different courts of the same state,
all for use of the same substance, marihuana. That marihuana use
can be treated as a petty offense in one state and a felony in
another is illogical and confusing to even the most sincere of
parents. </p>

<p>The law is simply too blunt an instrument to manifest the
subtle distinctions we draw between the motivations and the
circumstances of use. At the same time, legal status carries a
certain weight of its own, and other institutions must take
account of the law in performing their functions. </p>

<p>In legally implementing our recommended social policy, we seek
to maximize the ability of our schools, churches and families to
be open and honest in discussing all drugs, including marihuana.
The law must assist, not impede. In this respect, we note with
concern the counterproductive tendency in our society to seek
simple solutions to complex problems. Since the statutory law is
a simple tool, the tendency in our society to look to the law for
social control is particularly strong. </p>

<p>We have discussed the four basic social policy objectives of
elimination, discouragement, neutrality and approval of marihuana
use and have selected discouragement of use, with emphasis on
prevention of heavy and very heavy use, as our generalized aim.
We have considered three legal responses, each with a wide range
of alternatives: </p>

<p>1. Total Prohibition. </p>

<p>2. Partial Prohibition. </p>

<p>3. Regulation.<br>
</p>

<p>TOTAL PROHIBITION </p>

<p>The distinctive feature of a total prohibition scheme is that
all marihuana-related behavior is prohibited by law. Under the
total prohibition response now in force in every state and at the
federal level, cultivation, importation, sale, gift or other
transfer, and possession are all prohibited acts. In 11 states
and the District of Columbia, simply being present knowingly in a
place where marihuana is present is also prohibited; and many
states prohibit the possession of pipes or other smoking
paraphernalia. For our purposes, the key feature of the total
prohibition approach is that even possession of a small amount in
the home for personal use is prohibited by criminal law. </p>

<p>From the very inception of marihuana control legislation, this
nation has utilized a policy of a total prohibition, far more
comprehensive than the restrictions established during the
prohibition of alcohol. </p>

<p>Until recent years, society was operating under an
eliminationist policy. The exaggerated beliefs about the drug's
effects, social impact, and user population virtually dictated
this legal approach. During this entire, period, total
prohibition was sought through the use of heavier and heavier
penalties until even first-time possession was a felony in every
jurisdiction, and second possession offenses generally received a
mandatory minimum sentence without parole or probation. Yet the
last few years have seen society little by little abandoning the
eliminationist policy in favor of a containment policy. </p>

<p>Under the total prohibition umbrella, this containment policy
has been implemented by a unique patchwork of legislation,
informal prosecutorial policy and judicial practice. Possession
is now almost everywhere a misdemeanor. Although some term of
incarceration remains as a penalty for possessors, it is
generally not meted out to young first offenders or to possessors
of small -amounts. Instead, most such offenders are dismissed or
informally diverted to agencies outside the criminal system by
those within the system who are trying to help them avoid the
stigma of a criminal record. </p>

<p>Offenders who are processed within the criminal justice system
generally receive fines and/or probation. In many jurisdictions,
enforcement officials make little or no effort to enforce
possession proscriptions, concentrating instead on major
trafficking. Possessors are generally arrested only when they are
indiscreet or when marihuana is found incident to questioning or
apprehension resulting from some other violation. From our
surveys, state and federal, we have found that only minimal
effort is made to investigate marihuana possession cases. </p>

<p>Such a tendency is a reflection of the adoption of a
containment policy. By acting only when marihuana appears above
ground, enforcement officials are helping to keep its use
underground. The shift away from the elimination policy has been
matched by a similar shift in legal implementation, but the
distinctive feature of the total prohibition scheme still
remains: all marihuana-related behavior, including possession for
personal use within the home, is prohibited by criminal law. </p>

<p>Is such a response an appropriate technique for achieving the
social control policy we outlined above? The key question for our
purposes is whether total criminal prohibition is the most
suitable or effective way to discourage use and whether it
facilitates or inhibits a concentration on the reduction and
treatment of irresponsible use. We are convinced that total
prohibition frustrates both of these objectives for the following
reasons.<br>
</p>

<p><b>1. Application of the Criminal Law to Private Possession Is
Philosophically Inappropriate</b> </p>

<p>With possession and use of marihuana, we are dealing with a
form of behavior which occurs generally in private where a person
possesses the drug for his own use. The social impact of this
conduct is indirect, arising primarily in cases of heavy or
otherwise irresponsible use and<br>
from the drugs symbolic aspects. We do not take the absolutist
position that society is philosophically forbidden from
criminalizing any kind of &quot;private&quot; behavior. The
phrase &quot;victimless crimes,&quot; like &quot;public, health
hazard, has become a rhetorical excuse for avoiding basic social
policy issues. We have chosen a discouragement policy on the
basis of our evaluation of the actual and potential individual
and social impact of marihuana use. Only now that we have done so
can we accord appropriate weight to the nation's philosophical
preference for individual privacy. </p>

<p>On the basis of this evaluation we believe that the criminal
law is too harsh a tool to apply to personal possession even in
the effort to discourage use. It implies an overwhelming
indictment of the behavior which we believe is not appropriate.
The actual and potential harm of use of the drug is not great
enough to justify intrusion by the criminal law into private
behavior, a step which our society takes only 'with the greatest
reluctance.<br>
</p>

<p><b>2. Application of the Criminal Law Is Constitutionally
Suspect</b> </p>

<p>The preference for individual privacy reflected in the debate
over the philosophical limitations on the criminal law is also
manifested in our constitutional jurisprudence. Although no
court, to our knowledge, has held that government may not
prohibit private possession of marihuana, two overlapping
constitutional traditions do have important public policy
implications in this area. </p>

<p>The first revolves around the concept that in a free society,
the legislature may act only for public purposes. The
&quot;police powers&quot; of the states extend only to the
&quot;public health, safety and morals.&quot; In the period of
our history when the people most feared interference with their
rights by the government, it was generally accepted that this
broad power had an inherent limitation. For example, early
prohibitions of alcohol possession were declared unconstitutional
on the basis of reasoning such as that employed by the Supreme
Court of Kentucky in 1915 in the case of Commonwealth v.
Campbell: </p>

<p><i>It is not within the competency of government to invade the
privacy of the citizen's life and to regulate his conduct in
matters in which alone is concerned, or to prohibit him any
liberty the exercise which will not directly injure society.</i> </p>

<p>Noting that the defendant was &quot;not charged with having
the liquor in his possession for the purpose of selling it, or
even giving it to another,&quot; and that &quot;ownership and
possession cannot be denied when that ownership and possession is
not in itself injurious to the public,&quot; the Kentucky court
concluded that: </p>

<p><i>The right to use liquor for one's own comfort, if they use
it without injury to the public, is one of the citizen's natural
and inalienable rights.... We hold that the police power-vague
and wide and undefined as it is-has limits. . . .</i> </p>

<p>Even the perceived dangers of opium were not enough to
convince some members of the judiciary that the government could
prohibit possession. It is historically instructive to consider
these words, penned in 1890, by Judge Scott in Ah Lim v
Territory: </p>

<p><i>I make no question but that the habit of smoking opium may
be repulsive and degrading. That its effect would be to shatter
the nerves and destroy the intellect; and that it may tend to the
increase of the pauperism and crime. But there is a vast
difference between the commission of a single act, and a
confirmed habit. There is a distinction to be recognized between
the use and abuse of any article or substance.... If this act
must be held valid it is hard to conceive of any legislative
action affecting the personal conduct, or privileges of the
individual citizen, that must not be upheld.... The prohibited
act cannot affect the public in any way except through the
primary personal injury to the individual, if it occasions him
any injury. It looks like a new and extreme step under our
government in the field of legislation, if it really was passed
for any of the purposes upon which that character of legislation
can be sustained, if at all.</i> </p>

<p>As a matter of constitutional history, a second tradition, the
application of specific provisions in the Bill of Rights, has
generally replaced the notion of &quot;inherent&quot;
limitations. The ultimate effect is virtually the same, however.
The Fourth Amendment's proscription of &quot;unreasonable
searches and seizures&quot; reflects a constitutional commitment
to the value of individual privacy. The importance of the Fourth
Amendment to the entire, constitutional scheme was eloquently
described by Justice Brandeis in 1928 in the case of Olmstead v
U.S.: </p>

<p><i>The makers of our Constitution undertook to secure
conditions favorable to the pursuit of happiness. They recognized
the significance of man's spiritual nature, of his feelings and
his intellect. They knew that only a part of the pain, pleasure
and satisfaction of life are to be found in material things. They
sought to protect Americans in their beliefs, their thoughts,
their emotions and their sensations. They conferred, as against
the Government, the right to be let alone-the most comprehensive
of rights and the right most valued by civilized men.<br>
</i></p>

<p>Although the Fourth Amendment is itself a procedural
protection, the value of privacy which it crystallizes is often
read in conjunction with other important values to set
substantive limits on legislative power. The Supreme Court, in
the case of Griswold vs. Connecticut, held in 1965 that
Connecticut could not constitutionally prohibit the use of birth
control devices by married persons. Although the Justices did not
agree completely on the reasons for their decision, Justice
Douglas stated in the opinion of the Court: </p>

<p><i>The present case, then, concerns a relationship lying
within the zone of privacy created by several fundamental
constitutional guarantees. And it concerns a law which, in
forbidding the use of contraceptives rather than regulating their
manufacture or sale, seeks to achieve its goals by means of
having a maximum destructive impact upon that relationship. Such
a law cannot stand in light of the familiar principle, so often
applied by this Court, that a &quot;governmental purpose to
control or prevent activities constitutionally subject to state
regulation may not be achieved by means which sweep unnecessarily
broadly and thereby invade the area of protected freedom.&quot;
(citation omitted) Would we allow the police to search the sacred
precincts of marital bedrooms for telltale signs of the use of
contraceptives? The very idea is repulsive to the notions of
privacy surrounding the marriage relationship.</i> </p>

<p>Four years later, the Supreme Court, in Stanley v. Georgia,
held that even though obscenity is not &quot;speech&quot;
protected by the First Amendment, a state cannot constitutionally
make private possession of obscene material a crime. The Court's
reasoning is revealed in the following language: </p>

<p><i>[The] right to receive information and ideas, regardless of
their social worth, (citation omitted), is fundamental to our
free society. Moreover, in the context of this case- a
prosecution for mere possession of printed or filmed matter in
the privacy of a person's own home-that right takes on an added
dimension. For also fundamental is the right to be free, except
in very limited circumstances, from unwanted governmental
intrusions into one's privacy ...<br>
</i></p>

<p>While the judiciary is the governmental institution most
directly concerned with the protection of individual liberties,
all policy-makers have a responsibility to consider our
constitutional heritage when framing public policy. Regardless of
whether or not the courts would overturn a prohibition of
possession of marihuana for personal use in the home, we are
necessarily influenced by the high place traditionally occupied
by the value of privacy in our constitutional scheme. </p>

<p>Accordingly, we believe that government must show a compelling
reason to justify invasion of the home in order to prevent
personal use of marihuana. We find little in marihuana's effects
or in its social impact to support such a determination.
Legislators enacting Prohibition did not find such a compelling
reason 40 years ago; and we do not find the situation any more
compelling for marihuana today.<br>
</p>

<p><b>3. Total Prohibition Is Functionally Inappropriate<br>
</b></p>

<p>Apart from the philosophical and constitutional constraints
outlined above, a total prohibition scheme carries with it
significant institutional costs. Yet it contributes very little
to the achievement of our social policy. In some ways it actually
inhibits the success of that policy. </p>

<p>The primary goals of a prudent marihuana social control policy
include preventing irresponsible use of the drug, attending to
the consequences of such use, and deemphasizing use in general.
Yet an absolute prohibition of possession and use inhibits the
ability of other institutions to contribute actively to these
objectives. For example, the possibility of criminal prosecution
deters users who are experiencing medical problems from seeking
assistance for fear of bring attention to themselves. In
addition, the illegality of possession and use creates
difficulties in achieving an open, honest educational program,
both in the schools and in the home. </p>

<p>In terms of the social policy objective of discouraging use of
the drug, the legal system can assist that objective in three
ways: first, by deterring people from use; second, by symbolizing
social opposition to use; and finally, by cutting off supply of
the drug. </p>

<p>The present illegal status of possession has not discouraged
an estimated 24 million people from trying marihuana or an
estimated eight million from continuing to use it. Our survey of
the country's state prosecuting attorneys shows that 53% of them
do not believe that the law has more than a minimal deterrent
effect in this regard. Moreover, if the present trend toward
passive enforcement of the marihuana law continues, the law
ultimately will deter only indiscreet use, a result achieved as
well by a partial prohibition scheme and with a great deal more
honesty and fairness. </p>

<p>A major attraction of the law has been its symbolic value.
Yet, society can symbolize its desire to discourage marihuana use
in many other, less restrictive ways. The warning labels on
cigarette packages serve this purpose, illustrating that even a
regulatory scheme could serve a discouragement policy. During
Prohibition, the chosen statutory implementation symbolized
society's opposition to the use of intoxicating beverages; yet,
most jurisdictions did not think it necessary to superimpose a
proscription of possession for personal use in the home. </p>

<p>Finally, prohibiting possession for personal use has no
substantive relation to interdicting supply. A possession penalty
may make enforcement of proscriptions against sale a little
easier, but we believe this benefit is of minimal importance in
light of its costs. </p>

<p>The law enforcement goal repeatedly stated at both the federal
and state levels has been the elimination of supply and the
interdiction of trafficking. These avowed aims of law enforcement
make sense, since they are the most profitable means of employing
its manpower and resources in this area. </p>

<p>Indeed, the time consumed in arresting Possessors is
inefficiently used when contrasted with the same amount of time
invested in apprehending major dealers. Although a credible
effort to eliminate supply requires prohibitions of importation,
sale and possession-with intent-to-sell, the enforcement of a
proscription of possession for personal use is minimally
productive. </p>

<p>As noted, most law enforcement officials, district attorneys
and judges recognize the ineffectiveness of the possession
penalty. as a deterrent. Its perpetuation results in the making
of what is commonly referred to as &quot;cheap&quot; cases that
have little or no impact on deterring sale. </p>

<p>The marihuana supply system can be viewed as pyramid with the
major bulk of marihuana entering the system at top of the pyramid
and then descending to the base which represents the user
population. Common sense dictates where law enforcement should
devote its efforts. To remove the profit from the traffic
requires arresting sellers, not users. The oft-heard argument
that the police need possession penalties to compel users to
reveal their sources is not convincing. &quot;Turning
informants&quot; at the base of the pyramid is of marginal value
and limited utility in reaching upwards toward the apex. Further,
the National Survey showed that 60% of the users don't
&quot;buy&quot; marihuana but get it from a friend. The volume of
traffic in the drug at these levels is at best minimal. </p>

<p>In short, personal possession arrests and even casual sales,
which account for more than 95% of the marihuana arrests at the
state local level, occur too low in the chain of distribution to
diminish supply very effectively. </p>

<p>In addition to the misallocation of enforcement resources,
another consequence of prohibition against possession for
personal use is the social cost of criminalizing large numbers of
users. Our empirical study of enforcement of state and federal
marihuana laws indicates that almost all of those arrested are
between the ages of 18 and 25, most have jobs or are in school,
and most have had no prior contact -with the criminal justice
system. The high social cost of stigmatizing such persons as
criminals is now generally acknowledged by the public at large as
well as by those in the criminal justice system. </p>

<p>According to the National Survey, 53% of the public was
unwilling to give young users a criminal record and 87% objected
to putting them in jail. The nation's judges expressed an
overwhelming disinclination to sentence and convict users for
marihuana possession. Of these judges only 13% thought it was
appropriate to incarcerate ail adult for possession and only 4%
would jail a juvenile for marihuana possession. This
disinclination is reflected in the low percentage of arrested
users who are convicted, and the even lower percentage who are
jailed. </p>

<p>Even among the nation's prosecutors, a substantial majority
favor the present trend toward avoiding incarceration for first
offenders. Most jurisdictions have devised informal procedures
for disposing of cases in lieu of prosecution. Our empirical
study shows that 48% of the adult cases, and 70% of the juvenile
cases, were dropped from the system at some point between arrest
and conviction. The picture displayed is one of a large
expenditure of police manpower to enforce a law most participants
further along the line are not anxious to apply. </p>

<p>Other disturbing consequences of laws proscribing possession
for personal use are the techniques required to enforce them.
Possession of marihuana is generally a private behavior; in order
to find it, the police many times must operate on the edge of
constitutional limitations. Arrests without probable cause,
illegal searches and selective enforcement occur often enough to
arouse concern about the integrity of the criminal process. </p>

<p>Yet another consequence of marihuana possession laws is the
clogging of judicial calendars. President Nixon has noted that
one of the major impediments to our nation's efforts to combat
serious crimes is the fact that the judicial machinery moves so
slowly. Swift -arrests, prosecution, trial and sentence would
significantly improve the deterrent effect of law. Yet the
judicial system is overloaded with petty cases, with public
drunkenness accounting for about 50% of all non-traffic offenses.
</p>

<p>In his March 1971 address to the National Conference on the
Judiciary, President Nixon said: </p>

<p>What can be done to break the logjam of justice today, to
ensure the right to a speedy trial-and to enhance respect for
law? We have to find ways to clear the courts of the endless
stream of &quot;victimless crimes&quot; that get in the way of
serious consideration of serious crimes. There are more important
matters for highly skilled judges and prosecutors than minor
traffic offenses, loitering and drunkenness. </p>

<p>To this list we would add marihuana possession, which accounts
for a rising percentage, of judicial caseloads. In Chicago alone,
during the last half of 1970, there were more than 4,000
possession arrests. </p>

<p>A final cost of the possession laws is the disrespect which
the laws and their enforcement engender in the young. Our youth
cannot understand why society chooses to criminalize behavior
with so little visible ill-effect or adverse social impact,
particularly when so many members of the law enforcement
community also question the same laws. These young people have
jumped the fence and found no cliff. And the disrespect for the
possession laws fosters a disrespect for all law and the system
in general. </p>

<p>On top of all this is the distinct impression among the youth
that police may use the marihuana laws to arrest people they
don't like for other reasons, whether it be their politics, their
hair style or their ethnic background. Whether or not such
selectivity actually exists, it is perceived to exist. </p>

<p>For all these reasons, we believe that the possession offense
is of little functional benefit to the discouragement policy and
carries heavy social costs, not the least of which is disrespect
and cynicism among some of the young. Accordingly, even under our
policy of discouraging marihuana use, the better method is
persuasion rather than prosecution. Additionally, with the sale
and use of more hazardous drugs on the increase, and crimes of
violence escalating, we do not believe that the criminal justice
system can afford the time and the costs of implementing the
marihuana possession laws. Since these laws are not mandatory in
terms of achieving the discouragement policy, law enforcement
should be allowed to do the job it is best able to do: handling
supply and distribution. </p>

<p>A criminal fine or similar penalty for possession has been
suggested as a means of alleviating some of the more glaring
costs of a total prohibitory approach yet still retaining the
symbolic disapproval of the criminal law. However, most of the
objections raised above would still pertain: the possibilities of
invasion of personal privacy and selective enforcement of the law
would continue; possessors would still be stigmatized as
criminals, incurring the economic and social consequences of
involvement with the criminal law; the symbolic status of
marihuana smoking as an anti-establishment act would be
perpetuated. </p>

<p>On the other hand, a fine most likely would deter use no more
than does the present possibility of incarceration. It would
continue to impede treatment for heavy and very heavy use and
would persist in directing law enforcement away from the policy's
essential aim which is to halt illegal traffic in the drug. </p>

<p>For all these reasons, we reject the total prohibition
approach and its variations.<br>
</p>

<p><b>REGULATION</b> </p>

<p>Another general technique for implementing the recommended
social policy is regulation. The distinguishing feature of this
technique is that it institutionalizes the availability of the
drug. By establishing a legitimate channel of supply -and
distribution, society can theoretically control the quality and
potency of the product. The major alternatives within this
approach lie in the variety of restraints which can be imposed on
consumption of the drug and on the informational requirements to
which its distribution can be subject. </p>

<p>We have given serious consideration to this set of
alternatives; however, we are unanimously of the opinion that
such a scheme, no matter how tightly it might restrict
consumption, is presently unacceptable.<br>
</p>

<p><b>1. Adoption of a Regulatory Scheme at this Time Would
Inevitably Signify Approval of Use</b> </p>

<p>In rejecting the total prohibition approach, we emphasized the
symbolic aspects. In essence, we do not believe prohibition of
possession for personal use is necessary to symbolize a social
policy disapproving the use. Theoretically, a tightly controlled
regulatory schemes with limited distribution outlets, significant
restraints on consumption prohibition of advertising and
compulsory labeling, could possibly symbolize such disapproval.
Our regulatory policy toward tobacco is beginning to slowly to
reflect a disapproval policy toward Cigarette smoking.
Nonetheless, given the social and historical context of such a
major shift in legal policy toward marihuana, we are certain that
such a change would instead symbolize approval of use, or at
least a position of neutrality. </p>

<p>The Commission is concerned that even neutrality toward use as
a matter of policy could invest an otherwise transient phenomenon
with the status of an accepted behavior. If marihuana smoking
were an already ingrained part of our culture, this objection
would be dispelled. However, we do not believe that this is the
case,. We are inclined to believe, instead, that the present
interest in marihuana is transient and will diminish in time of
its own accord once the major symbolic aspects of use are
deemphasized, leaving among our population only a relatively
small coterie of users. With this possibility in mind, we are
hesitant to adopt either a policy of neutrality or a regulatory
implementation of our discouragement policy. The law would
inevitably lose its discouragement character and would become
even more ambiguous in its rationale and its enforcement. </p>

<p>The effect of changing a social policy direction may be seen
with tobacco policy. In recent years, society has ostensibly
adopted a policy of discouraging cigarette smoking. This new
policy has been implemented primarily in the information area
through prohibition of some forms of advertising and through
compulsory labeling. Yet, the volume, of cigarettes used
increased last year. We believe that the failure of the new
policy results from the fact that it supplants one that formerly
approved use. This set of circumstances argues against any policy
which would be regarded as approval of use, including a
regulatory scheme. It is always extremely difficult to transform
a previously acceptable behavior into a disapproved behavior.<br>
</p>

<p><b>2. Adoption of a Regulatory Scheme Might Generate a
Significant Public Health Problem<br>
</b></p>

<p>We noted above that institutionalizing availability of the
drug would inevitably increase the incidence of use, even though
that incidence might otherwise decrease. Of greater concern is
the prospect that a larger incidence of use would result in a
larger incidence of long term heavy and very heavy use of potent
preparations. </p>

<p>There are -now approximately 500,000 heavy users of less
potent preparations in this country, representing about 2% of
those who ever tried the drug. Even if the prevalence of -heavy
use remained the same in relation to those who ever used, this
at-risk population would inevitably increase under a regulatory
scheme. If the emotional disturbances found in very heavy hashish
users in other countries were to occur in this country, the
adverse social impact of marihuana use, now slight, would
increase substantially. </p>

<p>We have acknowledged that society, nonetheless, chose to run
such a risk in 1933, when Prohibition was repealed. But alcohol
use was already well-established in this society, and no
alternative remained other than a regulatory approach. In light
of our suspicion that interest in marihuana is largely transient,
it would be imprudent to run that risk for marihuana today.<br>
</p>

<p><b>3. Adoption of a Regulatory Scheme Would Exacerbate Social
Conflict and Frustrate a Deemphasis Policy</b> </p>

<p>A significant segment of the public on both sides of the issue
views marihuana and its &quot;legalization&quot; in a highly
symbolic way. Any attempt to adopt a regulatory approach now
would be counterproductive in this respect. The collision of
values resulting from such a dramatic shift of policy would
maintain the debate at a highly emotional level and would
perpetuate the tendency to perceive marihuana use as a symbol of
the struggle between two conflicting philosophies.<br>
</p>

<p><b>4. Not Enough Is Known About Regulatory Models In This Area</b>
</p>

<p>Advocates of legalization of marihuana are often inclined to
propose a licensing scheme or an &quot;alcohol model&quot;
without offering a specific program of regulation taking all the
variables into account. Responsible policy planning cannot be so
cursory. Consequently, we have given serious study to the many
issues presented by such a scheme and to the nation's experience
with other drug licensing schemes. On the basis of our inquiry,
we are convinced that such a step should not be taken unless a
realistic assessment of the efficacy of existing schemes and
their potential application to marihuana indicates it would be
successful. Such an assessment raises a number of disturbing
questions. </p>

<p>The regulatory approaches which this nation has used in the
cases of alcohol and tobacco have failed to accomplish two of
their most important objectives: the minimization of excessive
use and the limitation of accessibility to the young. Despite the
warning and restraints on distribution and consumption, more than
50 million Americans smoke cigarettes regularly, and more than
nine million Americans are &quot;problem&quot; drinkers. We have
previously cited data indicating how many of our children begin
habits which have been legally forbidden to them. Since the young
user and the chronic user of marihuana are of primary concern to
our public health officials, the lack of success with alcohol and
tobacco discourages an assumption that the regulation of supply
would minimize use by the younger generation. </p>

<p>Another important purpose of a regulatory scheme is to channel
the product through a controlled system of supply and
distribution. In that way the quality and quantity of the
substance can be regulated. The efficacy of such a scheme as
applied to marihuana is questionable. </p>

<p>Cannabis can be grown easily almost anywhere in the United
States with little or no human assistance. Even if a legitimate
source of supply were established, it is likely that many persons
would choose to ignore the legitimate source and grow their own,
the purity of which would not be in question. If such a practice
were illegal, the necessity for a concerted governmental
eradication program is raised, which would involve a monumental
law enforcement effort. According to the U.S. Department of
Agriculture, there are presently an estimated five million acres
of wild marihuana growing in this country and an undetermined
number of acres under cultivation. </p>

<p>Yet, if such a practice were not forbidden, the
revenue-raising, product-control and consumption-restriction
features of a regulatory scheme would be threatened. Instructive
to note is the fact that intensive regulation of alcoholic
beverage production 'has not eliminated illicit production.
During 1970, in fact, 5,228 illegal stills were destroyed by the
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms Division of the U.S. Treasury and
5,279 persons were arrested. In 1971, 3,327 illegal stills were
destroyed and 5,512 persons were arrested. </p>

<p>Another disturbing question is raised by the issue of potency
regulation. Most advocates of legalization stipulate potency
limitations as one feature of their scheme. Presumably they would
limit the THC content of the regulated product. This is not an
easy undertaking. Especially when cannabis is so easily grown and
a black market is so easily created, we are dubious about the
success of a regulatory scheme distributing only a product with
low THC content. Again, attention must be paid the prospect of
increased hashish use under a regulatory scheme; merely
stipulating potency control is not sufficient. As we noted in
Chapter II, the heavy, long-term use of hashish is a source of
major concern to the Commission from both private and public
health standpoints. </p>

<p>These are a few of the problems confronting the policy-maker
if be seeks to devise an effective regulatory system of
distribution for what is, in fact, a universally common plant.
Our doubts about the efficacy of existing regulatory schemes,
together with an uncertainty about the permanence of social
interest in marihuana and the approval inevitably implied by
adoption of such a scheme, all impel us to reject the regulatory
approach as an appropriate implementation of a discouragement
policy at the present time. </p>

<p>Future policy planners might well come to a different
conclusion if further study of existing schemes suggests a
feasible model; if responsible use of the drug does indeed take
root in our society; if continuing scientific and medical
research uncovers no long-term ill effects; if potency control
appears feasible and if the passage of time and the adoption of a
rational social policy sufficiently desymbolizes marihuana so
that availability is not equated in the public mind with
approval. <br>
</p>

<p><b>PARTIAL PROHIBITION<br>
</b></p>

<p>The total prohibition scheme was rejected primarily because no
sufficiently compelling social reason, predicated on existing
knowledge, justifies intrusion by the criminal justice system
into the private lives of individuals who use marihuana. The
Commission is of the unanimous opinion that marihuana use is not
such a grave problem that individuals who smoke marihuana, and
possess it for that purpose, should be subject to criminal
procedures. On the other hand, we have also rejected the
regulatory or legalization scheme because it would
institutionalize availability of a drug which has uncertain
long-term effects and which may be of transient social interest. </p>

<p>Instead we recommend a partial prohibition scheme which we
feel has the following benefits: </p>

<p>Symbolizing a continuing societal discouragement of use; </p>

<p>Facilitating the deemphasis of marihuana essential to
answering dispassionately so many of the unanswered questions; </p>

<p>Permitting a simultaneous medical, educational, religious, and
parental effort to concentrate on reducing irresponsible use and
remedying its consequences; </p>

<p>Removing the criminal stigma and the threat of incarceration
from a widespread behavior (possession for personal use) which
does not warrant such treatment; </p>

<p>Relieving the law enforcement community of the responsibility
for enforcing a law of questionable utility, and one which they
cannot fully enforce, thereby allowing concentration on drug
trafficking and crimes against persons and property; </p>

<p>Relieving the judicial calendar of a large volume of marihuana
possession cases which delay the processing of more serious
cases; and </p>

<p>Maximizing the flexibility of future public responses as new
information comes to light.<br>
</p>

<p>No major change is required in existing law to achieve all of
these benefits. In general, we recommend only a decriminalization
of possession of marihuana for personal use on both the state and
federal levels. The major features of the recommended scheme are
that: production and distribution of the drug would remain
criminal activities as would possession with intent to distribute
commercially; marihuana would be contraband subject to
confiscation in public places; and criminal sanctions would be
withdrawn from private use and possession incident to such use,
but, at the state level, fines would be imposed for use in
public.* </p>

<p>Specifically, we recommend the following statutory schemes.<br>
</p>

<p><b>RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FEDERAL LAW<br>
</b></p>

<p>Under the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act
of 1970, Congress provided the following scheme with respect to
marihuana, by which was meant only the natural plant and its
various parts, not the synthetic tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) : </p>

<ul>
    <li>Cultivation, importation and exportation, and sale or
        distribution for profit of marihuana are all felonies
        punishable by imprisonment for up to five years for a
        first offense and by up to 10 years for a second offense
        (the available penalty is doubled for sale to a minor). </li>
    <li>Possession of marihuana with intent to distribute is a
        felony punishable by imprisonment for up to five years
        for the first offense and by up to 10 years for a second
        offense. </li>
    <li>Possession of marihuana for personal use is a misdemeanor
        punishable by up to one year in jail and a $1,000 fine
        for first offense and by up to two years in jail and a
        $2,000 fine for second offense (expungement of criminal
        record is available for first offenders). </li>
    <li>Transfer of a small amount of marihuana for no
        remuneration is a misdemeanor punishable by up to one
        year in jail and a $1,000 fine for first offense and by
        up to two years in jail and a $2,000 fine for second
        offense (Congress singled out marihuana in this way to
        allow misdemeanor treatment of casual transfers and
        permitted first offender treatment, as allowed for
        possession for personal use). </li>
</ul>

<p>The Commission recommends only the following changes in
federal law:<br>
</p>

<ul>
    <li>POSSESSION OF MARIHUANA FOR PERSONAL USE WOULD NO LONGER
        BE AN OFFENSE, BUT MARIHUANA POSSESSED IN PUBLIC WOULD
        REMAIN CONTRABAND SUBJECT TO SUMMARY SEIZURE AND
        FORFEITURE. </li>
    <li>CASUAL DISTRIBUTION OF SMALL AMOUNTS OF MARIHUANA FOR NO
        REMUNERATION, OR INSIGNIFICANT REMUNERATION NOT INVOLVING
        PROFIT WOULD NO LONGER BE AN OFFENSE.<br>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>The Commission further recommends that federal law be
supplemented to provide:<br>
</p>

<ul>
    <li>A PLEA OF MARIHUANA INTOXICATION SHALL NOT BE A DEFENSE
        TO ANY CRIMINAL ACT COMMITTED UNDER ITS INFLUENCE, NOR
        SHALL PROOF OF SUCH INTOXICATION CONSTITUTE A NEGATION OF
        SPECIFIC INTENT. <br>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>* Commissioners Rogers, Congressman from Florida, and Carter,
Congressman from Kentucky, agree with the Commission's selection
of a discouragement policy and also agree that criminalization
and incarceration of individuals for possessing marihuana for
their own use is neither necessary nor desirable as a means of
implementing that policy. </p>

<p>At the same time, both Commissioners feel that the contraband
concept is not a sufficiently strong expression of social
disapprobation and would recommend in addition a civil fine for
possession of any amount of marihuana in private or in public. </p>

<p>Both Commissioners feel that the civil fine clearly symbolizes
societal disapproval and is a simple mechanism for law
enforcement authorities to carry out. If a person is found by a
law enforcement officer to be in possession of marihuana, the
officer would issue such person a summons to appear in court on a
fixed day. Although a warrant would not issue for Research of a
private residence unless there were probable cause to believe a
criminal offense was being committed, a police officer
legitimately present for other reasons could issue a civil
summons for violation of the &quot;possession&quot; proscription.<br>
</p>

<p>Commissioners Rogers and Carter believe that the legal system
must be utilized directly to discourage the person from using
marihuana rather than being utilized only indirectly as In the
case of contraband. </p>

<p>This civil fine would not be reflected in a police record, nor
would it be considered a criminal act for purposes of future job
consideration, either in the private sector or for government
service. </p>

<p>Agreeing with the other Commissioners that the casual
transfers of marihuana for no profit should be treated in the
same manner as possession for one's own use, Congressmen Rogers
and Carter do not agree that it should extend to transfers
involving remuneration. They prefer the limiting language of the
Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970 which
does not include the term &quot;or insignificant remuneration not
involving a profit.&quot; </p>

<p>Apart from the addition of the civil fine to the contraband
recommendation in the respects set out above, Congressmen Carter
and Rogers are in complete agreement with the statutory
recommendations set out in the Report. </p>

<p>Commissioner Ware concurs completely with the statements made
by Congressmen Rogers and Carter but wishes to reemphasize that
the social policy and legal scheme adopted is applicable only to
marihuana and should not be construed to embrace other
psychoactive drugs. The policy set forth in this Report, subject
to the already noted comments of the two Congressional
Commissioners, makes sense for marihuana on the basis of what is
known about the drug and in the absence of any conclusive showing
which would verify some of the anecdotal law enforcement
testimony heard by the Commission regarding criminal behavior
exhibited while under the influence of marihuana. </p>

<p>Commissioner Ware feels that some penalty short of
criminalizing the user, such as a civil fine or some type of
intensive drug education, will act as a positive deterrent toward
minimizing the incidence of marihuana use especially among the
young. Further, he is opposed to the use of any drug for the
express purpose of getting intoxicated, and includes alcohol
within this category. The Commissioner feels that what is needed
is an internalizing of discipline among our citizenry, with the
legal system assisting this process through the use of
disincentives. </p>

<p>Commissioners Hughes, Senator from Iowa, and Javits, Senator
from New York, feel that the Commission has taken a major, highly
laudable step in recommending that the private use of marihuana
be taken out of the criminal justice system. They concur in its
threshold judgment that overall social policy regarding this drug
should seek to discourage use, while concentrating primarily on
the prevention of irresponsible use. They disagree, however, with
three specific recommendations relating to the implementation of
this discouragement policy. </p>

<p>First, they would eliminate entirely the contraband provision
from the partial prohibitory model adopted by the Commission.
They want it eliminated first because its legal implications are
confusing and the subject of disagreement even among lawyers.
Whether or not possession of a given substance is criminal,
possession of material designated as contraband makes that
possession unlawful. Also, marihuana designated as contraband
would be subject to government search and seizure, even though
the underlying possession is no longer criminal. The
provision-which does not apply to marihuana held for personal use
within the home is considered by both Commissioners to be an
unnecessary &quot;symbol&quot; of the discouragement policy. It
will not foster elimination of the misunderstanding and mistrust
which is a hallmark of our current marihuana policy. </p>

<p>Commissioner Hughes and Javits seek to eliminate it also
because as a practical matter it serves no useful law enforcement
purpose within the overall partial prohibitory model. If
marihuana held for personal use within the home is not
contraband, why should marihauna held for personal use within
one's automobile be contraband? The area of operation of the
contraband provision is extremely narrow. If one possesses more
than one ounce of marihuana in public, it may be seized without
regard to the contraband doctrine since such possession is a
criminal violation. </p>

<p>Since the contraband provision does not apply to marihuana
possession and use in private, the only effective area covered by
the contraband provision is the area of possession in public of
less than one ounce. The Commission has chosen to remove the
stigma of the criminal sanction in this kind of case. To impose
instead a contraband provision, which it is argued is in the
nature of a civil &quot;in rem&quot; seizure which does not
operate against the person, is to cloud the issue and to weaken
the force of the basic decriminalization. A persuasive
justification simply has not been made. </p>

<p>Both Commissioners seek to eliminate it also because they
believe that the voice of the Commission should be loud and clear
that the preservation of the right of privacy is of paramount
importance and cannot be casually jeopardized in the pursuit of
some vague public or law enforcement interest which has not been
defined and justified with clarity and precision. </p>

<p>The second area of disagreement with the Commission's
recommendations concerns the casual distribution of marihuana and
the not-for-profit sale. As understood:<br>
</p>

<p>(1) The totally donative transfer is not subject to criminal
penalty, regardless of where it takes place. </p>

<p>(2) The transfer of small amounts for insignificant
remuneration not involving a profit is not subject to criminal
penalty (except if it is accomplished in public, in which case it
is subject to criminal sanction), but (3) The transfer of
&quot;large amounts&quot; for &quot;significant&quot;
remuneration not involving a profit is subject to criminal
penalty. </p>

<p>Footnote 4 on page 158 of the Report, the Commission refers to
a Report of The Senate Judiciary Committee on the Comprehensive
Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970. In substance, it
implies that within the meaning of the Act, transfers of -more
than one or two marihuana cigarettes in return for 50 cents or
one dollar to cover cost are not intended to be covered as casual
transfers, but rather are to be treated as unlawful sales. </p>

<p>Commissioners Hughes and Javits feel that the Commission has
failed to set forth a clear standard which will adequately inform
the public of their obligations under the law. The recommendation
and its discussion in the Report are confusing and fail to
provide the individual with sufficient guidance to allow him to
act without having to dodge in and out of illegality. It also
undermines a basic, stated objective of the Commission i.e., to
concentrate the weight of the criminal sanction upon significant
supply and distribution activities, rather than upon casual
consumption. </p>

<p>Moreover, proscribing even the most casual not-for-profit
transfers when they occur in public is, in their opinion, wrong.
Such transfers are necessarily incident to private possession and
use. To hold that they should be subject to criminal sanction is
logically inconsistent with the Commission's rationale and
recommendation on decriminalization of such private activities. </p>

<p>Instead, both Commissioners recommend that all not-for-profit
sales be excluded from the criminal sanction. It Is fundamental
that there be a clear separation between the serious, commercial,
profit-making-seller, or &quot;pusher&quot; as he is known, and
the individual who merely splits the cost of a reasonable supply
of the drug with his friends or acquaintances. </p>

<p>Thirdly, exception is taken to the retention of the criminal
sanction on public possession of more than one ounce. The
individual who buys an ounce and a half would be a criminal when
he buys on the corner, when he puts it in his pocket, when he
gets in his car and drives home, when he is on his doorstep, but
not when he crosses the threshold of his home. Commission policy
should direct the attention of the law enforcement community to
the person who sells the drug for profit, and not to the person
who uses the drug privately. </p>

<p>If an individual has more than a few ounces in his possession,
and there is probable cause to believe that he intends to sell it
for profit, that activity is already covered under the
Commission's recommendation that possession with intent to sell
is illegal. Therefore, there is no need to further proscribe
simple public possession. </p>

<p>All the component parts of the recommended policy of the
Commission should be consistent with its objective of
non-interference with casual transfers and possession and use
which is essentially and fundamentally private and personal. </p>

<p>The contraband device, the not-for-profit sale, and public
possession of some reasonable amount which should be presumed to
be necessarily incident to private use should all be removed from
the ambit of legal sanction. To do so would be to strike down
&quot;symbols&quot; of a public policy which had never been
adequately justified in the first instance. Such steps would in
no way jeopardize the firm determination of the Commission that
the use of marihuana ought to be discouraged. <br>
<br>
</p>

<p><a name="Lastedit"><b>RECOMMENDATIONS FOR STATE LAW<br>
</b></a></p>

<p>Under existing state marihuana laws, cultivation distribution
and possession with intent to distribute are generally felonies
and in most states possession for personal use is a misdemeanor.
The Commission strongly recommends uniformity of state laws and,
in this regard, endorses the basic premise of the Uniform
Controlled Substances Act drafted by the National Conference of
Commissioners on Uniform State Laws. The following are our
recommendations for a uniform statutory scheme for marihuana, by
which we mean, as under existing federal law, only the natural
cannabis plant and its various parts, not the synthetic
tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) <br>
</p>

<p><b>Existing Law<br>
</b></p>

<p>CULTIVATION, SALE OR DISTRIBUTION FOR PROFIT AND POSSESSION
WITH INTENT TO SELL WOULD REMAIN FELONIES (ALTHOUGH WE DO
RECOMMEND UNIFORM PENALTIES).<br>
</p>

<p><b>Private Activities<br>
</b></p>

<p>POSSESSION IN PRIVATE OF MARIHUANA FOR PERSONAL USE WOULD NO
LONGER BE AN OFFENSE. </p>

<p>DISTRIBUTION IN PRIVATE OF SMALL AMOUNTS OF MARIHUANA FOR NO
REMUNERATION OR INSIGNIFICANT REMUNERATION NOT INVOLVING A PROFIT
WOULD NO LONGER BE AN OFFENSE. <br>
</p>

<p><b>Public Activities<br>
</b></p>

<p>POSSESSION IN PUBLIC OF ONE OUNCE OR UNDER OF MARIHUANA WOULD
NOT BE AN OFFENSE, BUT THE MARIHUANA WOULD BE CONTRABAND SUBJECT
TO SUMMARY SEIZURE AND FORFEITURE. </p>

<p>POSSESSION IN PUBLIC OF MORE THAN ONE OUNCE OF MARIHUANA WOULD
BE A CRIMINAL OFFENSE PUNISHABLE BY A FINE OF $100. </p>

<p>DISTRIBUTION IN PUBLIC OF SMALL AMOUNTS OF MARIHUANA FOR NO
REMUNERATION OR INSIGNIFICANT REMUNERATION NOT INVOLVING A PROFIT
WOULD BE A CRIMINAL OFFENSE PUNISHABLE BY A FINE OF $100. </p>

<p>PUBLIC USE OF MARIHUANA WOULD BE A CRIMINAL OFFENSE PUNISHABLE
BY A FINE OF $100. </p>

<p>DISORDERLY CONDUCT ASSOCIATED WITH PUBLIC USE OF OR
INTOXICATION BY MARIHUANA WOULD BE A MISDEMEANOR PUNISHABLE BY UP
TO 60 DAYS IN JAIL, A FINE OF $100, OR BOTH. <br>
</p>

<p>OPERATING A VEHICLE OR DANGEROUS INSTRUMENT WHILE UNDER THE
INFLUENCE OF MARIHUANA WOULD BE A MISDEMEANOR PUNISHABLE BY UP TO
ONE YEAR IN JAIL, A FINE OF UP TO $1,000, OR BOTH, AND SUSPENSION
OF A PERMIT TO OPERATE SUCH A VEHICLE OR INSTRUMENT FOR UP TO 180
DAYS. </p>

<p>A PLEA OF MARIHUANA INTOXICATION SHALL NOT BE A DEFENSE TO ANY
CRIMINAL ACT COMMITTED UNDER ITS INFLUENCE NOR SHALL PROOF OF
SUCH INTOXICATION CONSTITUTE A NEGATION OF SPECIFIC INTENT. </p>

<p>A PERSON WOULD BE ABSOLUTELY LIABLE IN CIVIL COURT FOR ANY
DAMAGE TO PERSON OR PROPERTY WHICH HE CAUSED WHILE UNDER THE
INFLUENCE OF THE DRUG.<br>
</p>

<p><b>DISCUSSION OF FEDERAL RECOMMENDATIONS <br>
</b></p>

<p>The recommended federal approach is really a restatement of
existing federal policy. From official testimony and record
evaluation, we know that the federal law enforcement authorities,
principally the Federal Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs
and the Bureau of Customs, do not concentrate their efforts on
personal possession cases. The avowed purpose of both Bureaus is
to eliminate major traffickers and sources of supply. For the
most part, the federal agencies have left possession enforcement
to the states. Underlying this approach is a need -to maximize
the use of enforcement resources for major priorities and allow
the states, in exercising their &quot;police powers,&quot; to
assume the responsibility for local activities, including
possession for personal use. </p>

<p>By withdrawing the criminal sanction from possession for
personal use we are, in effect, codifying official policy. In
addition, such a scheme follows the model chosen for alcohol in
the Volstead Act, and also revives the approach taken by Congress
in the Drug Abuse Control Amendments (DACA) of 1965. We are in
agreement with the original thrust of DACA, when Congress brought
previously uncontrolled drugs, LSD, barbiturates and
amphetamines, under control but did not assess criminal penalties
for possession for personal use. </p>

<p>Instead, Congress placed on the prosecution the burden of
proof that the possession was for purposes of sale. Regardless of
whether or not Congress was wise in imposing a penalty in 1968
for possession for personal use, a subject we will consider in
our next Report, we think the original DACA concept is
enlightened where marihuana is concerned. </p>

<p>At the same time, present federal law classifies marihuana as
contraband, and this feature should be maintained. The contraband
concept serves the discouragement policy in two ways: it assists
the removal of supply from the market and it symbolizes a
continuing societal opposition to use. Accordingly, if a person
is found in possession of marihuana in public and the government
is unable to prove any intent to sell, it may nevertheless seize
the marihuana and confiscate it is contraband. </p>

<p>The contraband provision would apply only to possession in
public and would not extend to possession for personal use in the
home. During Prohibition, the Federal Government and most of the
states employed a similar statutory limitation. For example, the
Volstead Act provided that a private dwelling could not be
searched &quot;unless it is being used for the unlawful sale of
intoxicating liquor. . . .&quot; I The impact of this contraband
concept is that marihuana possessed or found in public can be
summarily seized by law enforcement officials and forfeited to
the state for subsequent destruction .2 The criminal justice
system is not involved in the process. The individual receives no
record of any kind; he simply loses the economic value of the
marihuana.3 </p>

<p>With regard to the casual distribution of small amounts of
Marihuana for no remuneration or insignificant remuneration not
involving a profit we are following the approach taken in the
Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970 which
in essence treats such casual transfers as the functional
equivalent of possession. In doing so, Congress recognized that
marihuana is generally shared among friends and that not all
people who distribute marihuana are &quot;Pushers.&quot;* </p>

<p>' 39. Unlawful P0ssession of liquor or property designed for
manufacture thereof ; search warrants. It shall be unlawful to
have or possess any liquor or property designed for the
manufacture of liquor intended for use in violating this chapter
or which has been so used, and no property rights shall exist in
any such liquor or property. A search warrant may issue as
provided in [sections 611 to 631 and 633 of Title 181 and such
liquor, the containers thereof, and such property so seized shall
be subject to such disposition as the court may make thereof. if
it is found that such liquor or property was so unlawfully held
or possessed, or had been so unlawfully used, the liquor, and all
property designed for the unlawful manufacture of liquor, shall
be destroyed, unless the court shall otherwise order. No search
warrant shall issue to search any private dwelling occupied as
such unless it is being used for unlawful sale of intoxicating
liquor, or unless it is in part used for some business purpose
such as a store, shop, saloon, restaurant, hotel, or boarding
'house. 'Me term &quot;private dwelling&quot; shall be construed
to include the room or rooms used and occupied not transiently
but solely as a residence in an apartment house, hotel or
boarding house. The property seized on any such warrant shall not
lie taken from the officer seizing the same on any writ of
replevin or other like process. (Oct. 28, 1919, e. 85, Title 11,
 25, 41 Stat. 315) </p>

<p>'The federal and state provisions presently in force regarding
the seizure and forfeiture of an automobile transporting
marihuana would no longer be applicable. They would still remain
in force for other controlled drugs classified as contraband. </p>

<p>3 See the views of Commissioners Rogers, Carter, Ware, Hughes
and Javits expressed in the footnote on pages 151-156.<br>
<br>
The accuracy of Congress' appraisal is underscored by the
National Survey. When people who had used marihuana were asked
how they first obtained the drug, 61% of the adults and 76% of
the youth responded that it had been given to them. Only 4% of
the adults and 8% of the youth said that they had bought it. When
asked who their source had been, 67% of the adults and 85% of the
youth responded that it had been a friend, acquaintance or family
member. </p>

<p>The close association between the concepts of casual transfer
and personal possession is also underscored by the fact that 56%
of the prosecutors in our survey thought that the present law did
not deter casual transfer at all or deterred it only minimally. </p>

<p>With regard to importation and exportation, we recommend no
change in existing law and make the following observations.
First, the United States must maintain its international standing
and, as a member of the community of nations, this country should
do everything in its power to restrict the exportation of
marihuana to other countries and to penalize such international
traffic. </p>

<p>As to importation of marihuana, the most effective way to
discourage use is to cut off supply at the top of the pyramid.
Recognizing that most of the marihuana consumed in the United
States comes from abroad, we feel that the Bureau of Customs at
the borders should have all necessary authority to halt and
interdict supplies intended for consumption in this country.
There has been a long-standing practice of excepting ports and
borders from procedural rules applying within the United States.
One example is that Customs officials are allowed to search
without the showing of probable cause, even though such a showing
is mandatory for searches conducted within the United States. We
can see a legitimate reason for continuing this policy. <br>
</p>

<p>*In considering this relationship, the Senate, in the Report
of the Committee on the Judiciary of the United States Senate
regarding S. 3246 (a precursor bill to the new Federal law)
stated:<br>
</p>

<p>The language &quot;distributes a small amount of marihuana for
no remuneration or insignificant remuneration not involving a
profit&quot; as contained in section 501 (c) (4) is intended to
cover the type of situation where a college student makes a
quasi-donative transfer of one or two marihuana cigarettes and
receives 50 cents or a dollar in exchange to cover the cost of
the marihuana. </p>

<p>Transfers of larger quantities in exchange for larger amounts
of money, or transfers for profit, are not intended to be covered
by this section, but rather are to be covered by section 501 (c)
(2) which deals 'with unlawful distribution. This language
sketches a prototype situation which the Committee had in mind;
however, the wording of the Federal Act and of our
recommendations is not intended to establish inflexible rules.
The objective in both provisions is to distinguish between
commercial sellers and casual distributors. Ultimately the courts
will have the responsibility of drawing this distinction
according to the evidence in individual cases. The recommended
provision intentionally establishes a loose standard not tied to
specific amounts of marihuana or money.<br>
</p>

<p>See also the views of Commissioners Rogers, Carter, Ware,
Hughes and Javits expressed in the footnote on pages 151-156.<br>
</p>

<p><b>DISCUSSION OF STATE RECOMMENDATIONS <br>
</b></p>

<p>The states have primary responsibility for enforcing the
existing proscriptions against possession for personal use. Their
present efforts are designed mainly to keep marihuana use
contained, and in private. Such an enforcement policy is
consistent with our social policy approach, and is an appropriate
exercise of the states' obligations to maintain public order. So
while we see no need for criminal sanctions against possession
for personal use or against casual transfers, we recommend a
number of provisions for confining marihuana use to the home. </p>

<p>The first point is that even marihuana possessed for personal
use is subject to summary seizure and forfeiture if it is found
in public. This concept is now applicable under federal law which
we commend also to the states. In our view, the contraband
feature symbolizes the discouragement policy and will exert a,
major force in keeping use private. </p>

<p>Another means of symbolizing the discouragement policy which
has been suggested is the imposition of a civil fine on those
possessing marihuana outside the home for personal use.* Under
such an approach, a fine would be levied and processed outside
the criminal justice system. Essentially, possession of marihuana
would be the equivalent of a traffic offense in those
jurisdictions where such an offense is not criminal. </p>

<p>Such a scheme would accomplish little more than that achieved
under a partial prohibition scheme. Warrants would presumably not
be issued for searches of private residences, and possession
offenses would be detected only by accident or if the offender
uses the drug in public. The more direct way to confront such
behavior is a penalty against public use. </p>

<p>A further problem with the civil fine approach lies in the
area, of non-payment of the fine. With traffic tickets, or with
civil fines levied against industrial polluters, society can
compel compliance by withdrawing its permission to engage in
regulated activity. For example, it can revoke the motorists'
license to drive or the polluters' license to do business within
the state. In short, the state has remedies beyond the criminal
law to achieve its policy goal. The same would not be true for
the marihuana user and enforceability of the statute would
ultimately require court action.<br>
</p>

<p>*See the views of Commissioners Rogers, Carter and Ware
expressed in the footnote on pages 151-153. <br>
</p>

<p>As we have suggested, a central feature, of our statutory
approach at the state, level would be a vigorously enforced
prohibition of public use. No intoxicant should be used in
public, both because it may offend others and because the user is
risking irresponsible behavior if he should be under its
influence in public. Moreover, where marihuana is concerned,
continuing societal disapproval requires that the behavior occur
only in private if at all. Public use, under the proposed scheme,
would therefore be punishable by a fine of $100. </p>

<p>We also recognize the need for some prophylactic measure for
anticipating distribution, even though there may be no intent to
sell for profit. To this end, and in order to deter public use,
possession and transfer, we have drawn a line at one ounce of
marihuana. Possession in public of more than this amount would be
punishable by a fine of $100. </p>

<p>For these same reasons, we believe the states should prohibit
all transfers outside the home, whether or not for remuneration.
A transfer for profit would be a felony, as under present law. A
casual transfer of a small amount would be punishable by a fine
of $100. </p>

<p>Taken together, the contraband feature, the proscriptions of
public use and public possession of more than an ounce (even if
for personal use) and the prohibition of public transfers will
reflect the discouragement policy underlying the entire, scheme. </p>

<p>The remaining set of recommendations alms at irresponsible
behavior under the influence of marihuana. Whatever the precise
legal scheme employed, these provisions should be included. </p>

<p>First, the &quot;drunk and disorderly&quot; statutes presently
in force in the states are useful tools for maintaining public
order. We would suggest similar statutes in the case of
marihuana, punishing offenders by up to 60 days in jail, a fine
of $100, or both. Law enforcement authorities must have a means
to halt antisocial behavior exhibited incidental to marihuana
use. </p>

<p>The second aspect of irresponsible behavior is the operation
of automobiles, other vehicles, or any potentially dangerous
instrument while under the influence of marihuana. Such behavior
is gross negligence in itself, risking harm to others
unnecessarily. In addition to penalizing a person who
&quot;drives under the influence&quot; as a serious misdemeanant,
we would impose absolute civil liability on anyone who harms the
person or property of another while under the influence of
marihuana. </p>

<p>Finally, no one should be able to limit his criminal
accountability by alleging that he was under the influence of
marihuana at the time of the crime. Under both federal and state
law, the defendant should not be able to negate the mental
element of &quot;specific intent,&quot; which some offenses
carry, by pleading that he was under the influence of marihuana
and was therefore unable to have formed such an intent. Unlike
many users of heroin, the user of marihuana is not physically
dependent on the drug. The use of the drug is usually a matter of
choice. Although we believe on the basis of available evidence
that there is no causal connection between marihauna use and
crime, we would under no circumstances allow a person to escape
the consequences of his actions by hiding behind the cloak of
marihuana use.<br>
</p>

<p><b>DISCUSSION OF POTENTIAL OBJECTIONS<br>
</b></p>

<p>Having discussed our recommended scheme at the federal and
state levels, we think it useful to answer some objections we
anticipate will be raised. Possible objections are:<br>
</p>

<p>1. Partial prohibition is not a sufficient reflection of the
discouragement policy. </p>

<p>2. Partial prohibition is logically inconsistent. </p>

<p>3. A possession penalty is necessary for effective enforcement
of sale proscriptions. </p>

<p>4. Partial prohibition won't &quot;work&quot; for marihuana
any more than it did for alcohol. </p>

<p>5. A possession offense is essential as a device for detecting
problem users. </p>

<p>6. Retention of a possession offense is required by our
international obligations. </p>

<p>7. A firm distinction should be drawn between less potent and
more potent preparations. <br>
</p>

<p><b>1. The Partial Prohibition Approach Is a Sufficient
Reflection of the Discouragement Policy<br>
</b></p>

<p>To those who would argue that a criminal sanction against use
is a necessary implementation of an abstentionist policy, we need
only respond that this country has not generally operated on that
assumption. We would be astounded if any person who lived during
the 1920's was not aware of a definite governmental policy
opposed to the use of alcohol. Yet, only five states prohibited
possession for personal use during Prohibition. The failure of
the 18th Amendment, the Volstead Act and 43 state prohibition
acts to criminalize private possession certainly did not signify
official approval of or neutrality toward alcohol use. </p>

<p>As we pointed out in Chapter 1, our nation has not generally
seen fit to criminalize private drug-related behavior; only in
the narcotics area was possession made a crime and marihuana was
brought within the narcotics framework because of unfounded
assumptions about its ill effects. We think it is time to correct
that mistaken departure from tradition with respect to marihuana.
As during Prohibition, the drug will remain contraband, and its
distribution will be prohibited.<br>
</p>

<p>Even as late as 1965, an abstentionist drug policy was not
thought to require prohibition for personal use. At that time,
Congress enacted the Drug Abuse Control Amendments, bringing LSD,
amphetamines and barbiturates under federal control. National
policy was clearly opposed to use of the hallucinogens and the
non-prescription use of amphetamines and barbiturates, yet
Congress did not impose a penalty for possession. Whether or not
Congress' subsequent decision in 1968, to impose such a penalty
was appropriate is an issue we will cover in our next Report
after analyzing the individual drugs controlled. The important
point now is that such a penalty is not a necessary feature of a
discouragement policy for marihuana, regardless of its, propriety
for other drugs.<br>
</p>

<ol>
    <li><b>The Partial Prohibition Approach Is Not Logically
        Inconsistent </b></li>
</ol>

<p>It will. be, argued that a law which permits a person to
acquire and use marihuana but does not permit anyone to sell it
to him for profit is logically unsound. We do not agree. If we
had recommended a social policy of approval or neutrality toward
use, partial prohibition would indeed have been illogical.
However, under a discouragement policy, such a, scheme is
perfectly consistent. </p>

<p>Under partial prohibition, use is discouraged in three main
ways. First, law enforcement authorities will make a concerted
effort to reduce the supply of the drug. If a person wishes to
use marihuana, he will have to seek out a person to sell it to
him; and if his seller is in the business of distributing
marihuana for profit, the seller is violating the law. </p>

<p>Second, the user will have to confine his disapproved behavior
to the home. If lie uses the drug in public, he has committed an
offense; if lie possesses it in public, it may be summarily
seized as contraband. </p>

<p>Third, continuing efforts will be made by educators, public
health officials, and official government spokesmen to discourage
use. Realizing that educational efforts are not always
successful, we would hope for a sound program. In any event, the
law should be an ancillary rather than a focal consideration. </p>

<p>There is nothing theoretically Inconsistent about a scheme
which merely withdraws the criminal sanction from a behavior
which is not immoral but which is disapproved. The individual is
being allowed to make his own choice. Hopefully, he will choose
not to use marihuana. If he chooses to do so, however, he will
have to do so discreetly and in private. Apart from its ultimate
possession by the user, however, all marihuana-related activity
is prohibited. The drug is contraband from its initial growth,
through its harvest and distribution. It ceases to be contraband
only when possessed and used in the home.<br>
</p>

<p><b>3. Prohibition of All Possession Is Not Essential to
Prohibition of Sale<br>
</b></p>

<p>The other side of the &quot;inconsistency&quot; objection is
the argument by law enforcement officials that they cannot
adequately enforce proscriptions against sale without a
possession penalty. We disagree. We have already explained that
enforcement of a possession offense to some extent impedes the
effort to reduce supply. Possession cases are generally regarded
in the law enforcement community and by judges and prosecutors as
&quot;cheap&quot; cases. Few seriously contend that prosecution
of possessors reduces supply. </p>

<p>Some persons argue in response that the law should remain on
the books as a tool not against the possessor but against the
seller. They say that a possession offense is helpful in three
ways. First, a prosecution can be used as a bargaining tool to
encourage the possessor to reveal his source; this is called
&quot;turning an informant.&quot; Second, the police may know
that a person is a seller, but may not be able to prove either
sale or intent to sell, so they can at least charge such
suspected sellers with simple possession. </p>

<p>Third, a corollary of the second argument is that the
possession offense provides a useful tool in the &quot;plea
bargaining&quot; process. That is, a seller may plead guilty to
the lesser offense of possession, now generally a misdemeanor,
instead of running the risk of trial and conviction of the more
serious offense of sale, generally a felony. The prosecution may
accept such a &quot;bargain' if it is uncertain of the strength
of the case, to avoid delay in sentencing, to reduce judicial
backlog or in return for information from the defendant. </p>

<p>From an institutional standpoint, we do not find these
arguments persuasive. First, if a possession offense is on the
books, possession is a criminal activity. We oppose criminalizing
conduct when its purpose and intent is directed not toward that
conduct but toward another behavior. </p>

<p>In answer to the informant argument, the marihuana user (and
this may not be true of other drugs) is simply too low in the
distributional chain to help very much. As indicated earlier, the
National Survey shows most users receive their marihuana from
their friends or acquaintances either as a gift or at cost.
Rarely is the time spent on him or on his &quot;source&quot; a
fruitful allocation of the law enforcement official's time. Also,
it is institutionally improper to hold the criminal sanction over
a person to force him to talk, when we otherwise would be
unwilling to use that sanction. </p>

<p>As to the &quot;lack of proof&quot; and &quot;plea
bargaining&quot; arguments, we believe they challenge a
fundamental tenet of our criminal justice system. That is, under
our law, a person is not guilty just because the police think he
is guilty; his offense must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt
to a judge or jury. If a possession offense were not on the
books, the police would have to gather enough evidence to convict
the seller of sale or of possession with intent to sell, and the
prosecution would have to convince the judge beyond a reasonable
doubt. The defendant, suspected seller or not, is entitled to due
process of law. </p>

<p>The &quot;lack of proof&quot; argument is nothing more than a
plea for an &quot;easy out&quot; when the police do not have
enough evidence. This simply represents an admission that law
enforcement officials want a possession offense which they can
apply selectively, to people whom they think, but cannot prove,
are sellers. Such a notion is inconsistent with the basic premise
of our system of equal treatment under the law. If
&quot;simple&quot; possession is not an offense for some, it is
not an offense for all. A &quot;known seller&quot; is entitled to
the same rights as anyone else: criminal conduct must be proved
beyond a reasonable doubt. We do not favor coddling criminals. We
do insist, as did the framers of the Constitution, that suspected
criminal behavior be proved.<br>
</p>

<p><b>4. That Partial Prohibition Did Not &quot;Work&quot; For
Alcohol Doesn't Mean It Won't For Marihuana<br>
</b></p>

<p>Prohibition failed to achieve its avowed purpose of
eliminating the use of intoxicating liquors from American life.
Risking an oversimplification, we think two reasons were
essentially responsible for this failure: the unwillingness of a
substantial minority, and probably a majority, of the American
public to discard a habit deeply ingrained in their lives; and
the inability of the law enforcement community to eliminate the
bootlegging traffic which catered to this continuing demand. </p>

<p>As we have repeatedly noted, one of the reasons for adoption
of a partial prohibition approach is uncertainty about the extent
to which marihuana use is ingrained in American culture. Indeed,
adoption of partial prohibition is the best way to find out for
sure. If the social interest turns out to be only transient, this
policy will prove particularly appropriate. </p>

<p>Similarly, an increase in marihuana use may be prevented by a
concerted effort to eliminate major trafficking, the scope of
which is presently only a small fraction of Prohibition
bootlegging. We do not pretend that supply of a plant so easily
grown can be eliminated. However, an intensive effort to
eliminate commercial criminal enterprise should have some impact
on the extent of use. <br>
</p>

<p><b>5. The Possession Offense Is Not Required as a Detection
Device <br>
</b></p>

<p>In addition to their deterrent and symbolic functions, the
drug possession laws serve a third function not shared by most
other criminal laws. Like laws against public drunkenness, they
facilitate societal detection of drug-dependent persons. Ideally,
such persons, although apprehended by law enforcement
authorities, may be detained for purposes of treatment and
rehabilitation. </p>

<p>Whatever the merits of such an argument for the opiates and
alcohol, such an argument does not apply to marihuana. Only a
very small percentage of marihuana users are drug-dependent or
are in need of treatment. Their dependence is generally upon
multiple drug use, not on marihuana. In any event, the existence
of such a small population does not justify retention of the
possession offense as a detection device.<br>
</p>

<p><b>6. International Obligations Do Not Require Maintenance of
a Possession Penalty<br>
</b></p>

<p>Some have raised the possibility that removal of simple
possession criminal penalties would contravene this country's
obligations under the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs (1961),
to which it became a signatory in March, 1967. We do not believe
the provisions of that Convention compel the criminalization of
possession for personal use. </p>

<p>Nowhere in the Convention are its Parties expressly required
to impose criminal sanctions on possession for personal use.
Article 4 requires Parties to &quot;take such legislative and
administrative measures as may be necessary . . . . to limit
exclusively to medical and scientific purposes the production,
manufacture, export, import, distribution of, trade in, use and
possession of drugs.&quot; Penal sanctions are not necessarily
included in this formulation. </p>

<p>Article 36, which deals specifically with penal provisions,
requires each party to adopt &quot;such measures as will
ensure&quot; that the listed activities, including possession,
&quot;shall be punishable offenses.&quot; Some have argued that
this provision requires prohibition of personal use. </p>

<p>However, from a comprehensive study of the history of the
Convention, the Commission has concluded that the word
&quot;possession&quot; in Article 36 refers not to possession for
personal use, but to possession as a link in illicit trafficking.
This interpretation is bolstered also by the failure to include
&quot;use&quot; in Article 36 even though it has been included in
Article 4. </p>

<p>Finally, we must consider Article 33, which provides that
&quot;the Parties shall not permit the possession of drugs except
under legal authority.&quot; This Article also does not require
the imposition of any sanctions on possession for personal use.
Experts consulted by the Commission have indicated that this
Article may, nevertheless, require that the Parties to limit
possession and use to medical and scientific purposes. To
affirmatively allow drugs to remain in the possession of persons
for non-medical use would in this view contravene Articles 4 and
33 to read together. From this perspective our international
obligations may require the classification of marihuana, as
contraband. For this reason, together with a desire to symbolize
our discouragement policy in a clear way, we have included the
contraband feature in our legal implementation scheme. </p>

<p>In conclusion, our reading of the Convention is that a Party
may legitimately decide to deal with non-medical use and
possession of marihuana through an educational program and
similar approaches designed to discourage use.<br>
</p>

<p><b>7. No Potency Distinction is Necessary at the Present Time</b>
</p>

<p>Following the approach taken in the Comprehensive Drug Abuse
Prevention and Control Act of 1970, we have drawn a line between
the natural cannabis plant and the synthetic
tetrahydrocannabinols. &quot;Marihuana&quot; is defined as any
and all parts of the natural plant. That we choose this approach
for purposes of statutory implementation does not mean that we
are unaware of the difference between the less potent and more
potent preparations of the natural plant. </p>

<p>As noted in Chapters 11 and III, the highest risk of cannabis
use to the individual and society arises from the very long-term,
very heavy use of potent preparations commonly called hashish. No
such pattern of use is known to exist in the United States today.
</p>

<p>The predominant pattern of use in the United States is
experimental or intermittent use of less potent preparations of
the drug. Even when hashish is used, the predominant pattern
remains the same. In addition, whatever the potency of the drug
used, individuals tend to smoke only the amount necessary to
achieve the desired drug effect. </p>

<p>Given the prevailing patterns of use, the Commission does not
believe it is essential to distinguish by statute between less
potent and more potent forms of the natural plant. Reinforcing
this judgment are the procedural and practical problems attending
an effort to do so. </p>

<p>If the criminal liability of ail individual user is dependent
on the THC content of the substance, neither lie nor the
arresting officer will know whether he has committed a crime
until an accurate scientific determination is made. Even if such
accurate determinations were feasible on a large scale, which is
not now the case, such after-the-fact liability is foreign to our
criminal laws. </p>

<p>Under present circumstances, then, a statutory line based on
potency is neither necessary nor feasible. We emphasize also that
any legal distinction is an artificial reflection of the
Commission's major concern: the heavy use of the drug over a long
term. The most emphatic element of official policy should be to
discourage such use, especially of the more potent preparations.
Unfortunately precise legislative formulations regarding the
amount of the drug presumed to be for personal use do not assist
this effort at all. Whether it is lawful to possess one ounce of
hashish or a proportionate amount based on potency (for example,
one-fourth ounce), an individual prone to use the drug heavily
will do so. Society's resources should be committed to the task
of reducing supply of the drug and persuading our citizens not to
use it. Expenditure of police time and financial resources in an
attempt to ascertain the THC content of every seized substance
would make little, if any, contribution to this effort.<br>
</p>

<p><b><u>A Final Comment<br>
</u></b></p>

<p>In this Chapter, we have carefully considered the spectrum of
social and legal policy alternatives. On the basis of our
findings, discussed in previous Chapters, we have concluded that
society should seek to discourage use, while concentrating its
attention on the prevention and treatment of heavy and very heavy
use. The Commission feels that the criminalization of possession
of marihuana for personal is socially self-defeating as a means
of achieving this objective. We have attempted to balance
individual freedom on one hand and the obligation of the state to
consider the wider social good on the other. We believe our
recommended scheme will permit society to exercise its control
and influence in ways most useful and efficient, meanwhile
reserving to the individual American his sense of privacy, his
sense of individuality, and, within the context of ail
interacting and interdependent society, his options to select his
own life style, values, goals and opportunities. </p>

<p>The Commission sincerely hopes that the tone of cautious
restraint sounded in this Report will be perpetuated in the
debate which will follow it. For those who feel we have not
proceeded far enough, we are reminded of Thomas Jefferson's
advice to George Washington that &quot;Delay is preferable to
error.&quot; For those who argue we have gone too far, we note
Roscoe Pound's statement, &quot;The law must be stable, but it
must not stand still.&quot; </p>

<p>We have carefully analyzed the interrelationship between
marihuana the drug, marihuana use as a behavior, and marihuana as
a social problem. Recognizing the extensive degree of
misinformation about marihuana as a drug, we have tried to
demythologize it. Viewing the use of marihuana in its wider
social context, we have tried to desymbolize it. </p>

<p>Considering the range of social concerns in contemporary
America, marihuana does not, in our considered judgment, rank
very high. We would deemphasize marihuana as a problem. </p>

<p>The existing social and legal policy is out of proportion to
the individual and social harm engendered by the use of the drug.
To replace it, we have attempted to design a suitable social
policy, which we believe is fair, cautious and attuned to the
social realities of our time.<br>
