<b><i>Health Hazard in Your Intestines</i><br>
<tt>William Lee Cowden, M.D. </tt></b>
<p>

<b>In what ways can a problem in the intestines be interfering with good health?</b><p>
For centuries, physicians across many disciplines have said that health begins and ends in the intestines. Many illnesses, such as colon, liver, breast, and prostate cancers, most allergies, infections, liver diseases, acne, psoriasis, and asthma, start in the intestines. The intestines become clogged, toxic, and diseased by what and how we eat and by how poorly we eliminate waste material. <p>
The intestines, when stretched out, are over 25 feet long. In fact, if the inner surface of the small intestines was smooth and flat rather than convoluted, they would stretch for 2-1/4 miles or completely cover an area the size of a tennis court. You can see how crucial intestinal health is to your well-being. Once the bowel is toxic, it creates toxicity for the entire body and an inability to absorb the nutrients necessary for healing.<p>
About 100 years ago, most people in the U.S. had a short intestinal transit time. That means it took only about 15-20 hours from the time food entered the mouth until it was excreted as feces. Today,  many have a seriously delayed transit time of 50-70 hours. <p>
This means there is more time for the stool to putrefy, for harmful microorganisms to flourish, for “friendly” bacteria to die off, and for toxins to develop and poison the tissues. When you eat mucus-producing foods, this further slows down the transit time. <p>
It should now be easier to understand how a toxic bowel can lead to cancer, allergies, and infections. It should also be clear how important it is to prevent and reverse bowel toxicity.<p>
A material similar to papier-mâché can develop in the lining of the small and large intestines as a result of eating white flour products combined with fluid and cellulose, which is found in vegetables. When you eat other foods that produce mucus, such as dairy products, the result is a rubbery-like material that combines with the papier-mâché lining, and it builds up even faster. <p>
Mucus-producing foods are nearly all foods aside from most vegetables and fruits; however, the most mucus-producing foods are milk products. Other foods include meats, fish, fowl, eggs, soybeans, oily seeds and nuts, and cooked beans and grains (but not beans and grains that have sprouted and grown for 6 days). Fruits and vegetables tend to cause the mucus in the intestines to break down somewhat and be eliminated.<p>
As this sticky mucoid false lining builds up in the small intestines, it blocks absorption of essential nutrients into the bloodstream and produces a hiding place in both intestines for bacteria, fungi, yeast, and parasites that are harmful to human health. <p>
When these abnormal life forms start growing too freely in the intestines, they kill off Lactobacillus acidophilus and other “friendly” bacteria. They also create a situation called dysbiosis (or an imbalance among intestinal microflora) in which the contents of the intestines putrefy and harmful chemicals are generated. <p>
The result is a toxic bowel and a body-wide condition of toxicity as toxins leech out of the intestines into other tissues. The toxins pass through the intestinal wall and accumulate in the lymph vessels. Too many toxins can block the lymphatic syste, which, no longer able to drain and filter poisons efficiently, becomes overloaded. <p>
As toxins build up in all the tissues, the result can be swelling of the torso and legs and damage to the immune system, liver, and, eventually, the other organs. The inevitable result is illness.<p>

<b>Are there general precautionary steps to improve intestinal health?</b><p>
There are 7 steps anyone can adopt, starting today, to improve their intestinal health as a way of preventing illness.<p>
First, make some dietary changes. Start eating a diet that is high in fiber, fresh raw vegetables and fruits, and very low in mucoid-producing foods. It would be wise to completely stop eating all milk products from cows and all refined white flour products, such as pastas, breads, and baked goods. It is also advisable to reduce your intake of sugar, eggs, meats, fowl, most fish, nuts, seeds, and unsprouted beans and grains.<p>
Second, reduce your stress load. Practice stress reduction techniques before each meal. These might include  muscle relaxation, deep breathing, or the visualization of a favorite and pleasant natural setting. Listen to a stress reduction audiotape before eating, then try to have your meals in a calm, pleasant environment. <p>
Third, practice lymphatic drain-age. It is important to take steps to clean out your lymphatic system, especially the lymph vessels that attach to the intestines. You can do this by gently bouncing on a mini-trampoline or rebounder for 5-15 minutes once daily, but don’t overexert yourself.  This will stimulate the numerous lymph nodes in your neck, chest, and groin to start draining toxins into the bloodstream for removal from the body.<p>
Fourth, brush your skin. In the early morning, soon after you get up, take a wooden brush with stiff natural bristles and lightly brush your skin. Move the brush across the skin towards the middle end of the collarbones on each side of the body, as important lymph drainage sites are located there. Spend 8-10 minutes dry brushing your entire body. <p>
This procedure will mechanically aid your lymph system in its detoxification efforts. Do the dry brushing before taking a bath, but be aware that skin brushing just before bedtime can make it difficult to fall asleep. <p>
Fifth, try ozonated bathing.  Many of the toxins that build up in the body are fat soluble and gather in the fatty tissues. Immersing yourself in a bathtub of warm ozonated water for 30 minutes once daily for 2-3 weeks, will aid in their removal from your body. <p>
Ozone purifies the bathwater by killing living viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites. It will also oxidize the water-insoluble toxins on the skin and in the bathwater, turning them into water-soluble toxins. Once water-soluble, they are easily flushed from the system.<p>
Here’s how to ozonate a bath. Purify the tap water by running it through a KDF solid charcoal showerhead filter as you fill the tub. This filter can remove up to 99% of the toxic substances found in tap water.  <p>
Next, bubble ozone (O3, a form of oxygen) into the water using an ultraviolet ozone generator and an ozone-diffusing bath bubbler. Bubble the ozone for 15 minutes before you get into the tub and keep it going during your 30-minute soak. The bath bubbler converts the ozone that is accumulating in the air above the bubbling water back into oxygen so that it is not irritating to the lungs. <p>
Adding 1/2 cup of Body Soak Gold to your bathwater, and increasing this amount to 1 cup over 2-3 weeks, will usually produce a faster removal of toxins from the body than ozonated water alone. <p>
	  After you have used one full bottle of Body Soak Gold, you may gain additional detoxification benefit by switching to 1/4 cup of Liquid Needles Foot Soak added to the bathwater; over a period of several days, increase this amount to 1 cup for each 30-minute bath. Best results are obtained if both soaks are added to KDF charcoal-filtered water. Scrub your entire skin surface with a loofah sponge or natural fiber brush 3 times during the 30-minute soak. <p>
	  Sixth, I generally recommend the following, taken 30-40 minutes before your ozonated bath or 10-15 minutes after it: at least 400 IU of vitamin E; 25,000 IU of beta carotene and/or mixed carotenoids; 2000 mg vitamin C; and 100 mg of grape seed extract (pycnogenol).<p>
Seventh, I generally recommend 1 lozenge of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and 100 mg of L-glutathione powder (an amino acid). Dissolve both substances under your tongue before each bath; this enables it to be absorbed faster and more completely. These nutrients will facilitate toxin removal from your system. <p>
SOD is an antioxidant enzyme that protects the system against free radical damage from chemicals or radiation. L-glutathione is a sulfur-containing peptide (made of amino acids, which are protein building blocks), an antioxidant essential to the body’s toxic waste disposal system. <p>

<b>Do you have a long-term intestinal detoxification and disease prevention program?</b><p>
I often recommend a 5-month gentle detoxification program. Here, you are required to maintain a diet that is low in mucus-forming foods and to take herbs and fiber that help to break up the intestines’ mucoid lining. <p>
This program, which takes about 3-5 months to clean out the intestines’ false lining, is effective for people with allergies, irritable bowel syndrome, yeast and fungal overgrowth, parasites, severe liver or kidney disease, or for anyone seeking an improved state of health.<p>

 <ul>
  <li><b>PRELIMINARIES</b>. Begin a low-mucus-forming diet (as described above) and practice dry skin brushing once daily for 3 months, then twice weekly afterwards. In collaboration with Health Restoration Systems, I have developed products that make it easy for people to do this program at home.<p>
  <li><b>HERBAL FIBER</b>. Take an herbal fiber product as a bowel-bulking agent 2 times daily at first, building up to 3-4 times daily after a week. We developed the NatureSpring Friend-ly Flora and Fiber formula specifically for this purpose. This product may be taken daily for maintenance after the 3 to 5 month cleanse is finished.<p>
	Along with this, I generally recommend an herbal product called NatureSpring Intestinal Cleanse at the rate of 1 capsule twice daily, building up gradually to 1-2 taken 3-4 times daily. The goal is to have 2-3 bowel movements per day. The herbs in the Cleanse—slippery elm, Cascara sagrada, papain, cay-enne, ginger—will help break down the mucoid lining of the intestines and stimulate the intestines to push toxic feces out. Of those who use the Cleanse, most should taper off after 4-5 weeks.<p>
  <li><b>MUCOID REMOVER</b>. On the third day of the program, I generally recommend Nature-Spring Bowel, Blood and Body Cleansing Formula, starting with 1/2 to 1 tablet, 2 times daily then building gradually to 2 tablets taken 3-4 times daily. This formula has 30 ingredients that break down mucus, cleanse the blood, drain the lymphatics, and stabilize the function of various organ systems.
</ul><p>

Based on transient symptoms that you notice once you begin this program—release of toxins, increase in frequency and size of bowel movements—the user may adjust the dosage. Be sure to drink copious amounts of pure water (nonchlorinated and nonfluoridated but not distilled) while on this program. <p>
