 <TITLE>Transportation and Emergency Response Training Policy and Procedures </TITLE>
<BODY>

<NOBR><h2>Release of Proposed Policy and Procedures <br>
for the Safe Transportation of Spent Nuclear Fuel<br>
and Emergency Response Training</h2></NOBR>
<hr>

DOE has published in the <A HREF="http://www.rw.doe.gov/pages/resource/fedreg/180c.htm">Federal Register</A>, a proposed policy statement to implement a program of technical and financial assistance to states for training local and tribal government public safety officials. The officials eligible for the funding and technical assistance are from the states and Indian tribal lands through which the department plans to transport spent nuclear fuel or high-level radioactive waste. The training would cover both safe routine transportation procedures and emergency response procedures. <P>
<P>
The public comment period on the proposed policy closed September 30, 1996.  The Department received 38 comments from various states, Indian tribes, county governments, professional organziations and other interested parties.  The Department will consider these comments during development of the final policy and procedures.  The final policy and procedures will be published in the Federal Register in June 1997. <P>
