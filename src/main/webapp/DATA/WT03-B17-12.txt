<font size=+3><b>Selling Ice to the Eskimos</font></b>
</center>

<hr>
<i>by Joshua Levine</i><p>

<img src="../caps/bcap.gif" align=left border=0 alt="B">ITI'S, a sandal retailer that is ubiquitous in Vietnam, with 500 shops and 3,500 workers, is one of few Vietnamese firms to operate an office in the US. Located in Manhattan, the office has been opened since 1994. The privately-held company, established in 1982, is admired for its seeming ability to "sell ice to the Eskimos."<p>

Or more precisely, to inspire a nation of sandal-wearers to keep buying more sandals and slippers. A team of 20 designers for the HCMC-based company continually develop new styles and colors of footwear, which BITI'S sells at prices that are lower than imports and only slightly higher than regional competitors.<p>

One of few companies implementing a variety of styles (over 500), the firm enjoys 30% per year growth, according to an informed source, and exports to 30 countries. In 1994, turnover was $12.5 million, representing 7 million pairs of slippers and sandals. This generated a profit margin of about 15%. In 1995, turnover was about $20 million and 9 million pairs of slippers and sandals with export markets accounting for larger profits.<p>

BITI'S is short for Binh Tien Imex Corporation, whose original purpose was to make and sell rubber beach sandals to State-owned companies. It merged with another group four years later to form the Binh Tien Rubber Cooperative, which traded with State-owned exporters trading with the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe.<p>

In 1986, BITI'S became the first private Vietnamese company licensed to import and export directly. After the former Soviet Union collapsed, its primary owners, Mr. Vuu Khai Thanh and his wife, Mrs. Lai Khiem, studied ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) sandal production in Taiwan and in 1989 ordered a production line able to make 5 million pairs per year.<p>

Mr. Thanh served as representative of the People's Committee of District 6 in HCMC in 1990 and has led powerful urban industrialists' associations including the Dai Bo Chinese Community Center. He is also a leader of the Vietnam Fatherland Front Committee.<p>

BITI'S also has more recent investments or interests including in Bitas (also a footwear retailer), Kiti's (trading) and a shoe-making JV with a Korean firm. In addition, it has investments in refrigeration and electrical equipment manufacturing in the Dong Nai Industrial Zone. BITI'S also is expanding into the areas of construction material manufacture, real estate, and general investment. The company is now a group of separately owned companies.<p>
