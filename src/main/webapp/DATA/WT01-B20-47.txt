<p align="center"><b>Plight Of Oklahoma Paraplegic Pot Prisoner
To Be Topic<br>
At Major London Human Rights Convention</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">London: The continued imprisonment of Oklahoma
paraplegic Jimmy Montgomery will be addressed at a three day
Human Rights Convention to be held in London from June 15 to
17.&nbsp; The Convention, billed as &quot;A Festival of
Rights,&quot; is being sponsored by Liberty, the London based human
rights organization.&nbsp; It is expected that more than 5,000
people from around the world will attend the convention.&nbsp;
This will be the first time that the excesses of America's war on
marijuana users will be recognized as a violation of human rights
comparable to other forms of political persecution. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">NORML National Director, Richard Cowan, will be speaking at one
of the convention sessions about the inhumane treatment of Jimmy
Montgomery.&nbsp; Montgomery is a paraplegic who has almost died
several times while serving a ten year sentence in Oklahoma
prisons for less than two ounces of marijuana.&nbsp; Despite
months of calling the Oklahoma Governor's office by hundreds of
concerned Americans, Montgomery is still being held in Oklahoma's
severely overcrowded prisons. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Cowan will also speak about the killings by Wisconsin police of
two suspected cannabis users.&nbsp; One victim was a 15 year-old
boy allegedly shot by a drunken narc.&nbsp; &quot;I hope that the
international media and human rights community will focus on the
rising tide of violence and hatred being inflicted on American
cannabis users, which is being ignored by the American
media,&quot; said Cowan.&nbsp; He added, &quot;having the
persecution of cannabis users recognized at this convention is a historic
breakthrough in our efforts to get the world to count the cost of
cannabis prohibition.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">There will be more than 100 speakers at the convention, including
Pierre Sane, the Secretary General of Amnesty International;
Kader Asmal, a Minister in the South African government; and Lord
Lester, QC. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Back in America, Jimmy Montgomery's parole hearing has been
delayed to July 12, supposedly because the June 21 schedule is
full.&nbsp; NORML urges that concerned citizens continue calling Oklahoma
Governor Keating and other state opinion leaders to urge that
Montgomery's case be dealt with immediately.&nbsp; It is
unfortunate that Oklahoma is to be subjected to international opprobrium
because it cannot find a way to free a man who did not belong in
prison in the first place.</p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">[To reach Governor Frank Keating, call (405)
521-2342 or fax (405) 521-3353.&nbsp; To reach the editors of the
two major newspapers in Oklahoma call 1.) <i>The Daily Oklahoman</i>,

<p align="center"><b>Oregon House Votes To Re-criminalize
Marijuana Possession</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>June 6,</b> Salem, Oregon:&nbsp; In a surprise
move under new rules that allow for only one hour's notice to be
given before legislative hearings, the Oregon House of
Representatives voted 47 to 13 to re-criminalize the possession
of less than one ounce of marijuana.&nbsp; The bill would raise
the maximum fine for possession from $1,000 to $5,000 and the
minimum fine from $100 to $500 per gram.&nbsp; This would mean a
minimum fine of $2,800 per ounce.&nbsp; Although there is no
direct jail penalty, persons unable to pay the higher fines could
be jailed.&nbsp; The bill also makes it a crime to be &quot;under
the influence&quot; of marijuana without defining just what that
means. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In 1973, Oregon was the first state to decriminalize marijuana,
but it does not have a higher rate of marijuana use than other
states.&nbsp; The sponsor of the bill cited the usual reasons,
the supposed &quot;increase&quot; in potency of marijuana, the
claim that it is the &quot;gateway&quot; to hard drugs (in 1973
it was the &quot;stepping stone&quot;), and the claim that 9 and
10 year-olds are smoking -- so adults mast be arrested. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Critics point out that the bill would cost the state at least one
million dollars per year by requiring the appointment of public
defenders for indigent defendants, plus the cost of imprisoning those
who cannot afford the much higher fines.</p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">This bill demonstrates that Oregon is not immune
to the massive hate campaign against cannabis users being waged
by the prohibitionist establishment and the mass media.&nbsp;
This week, Gannett News Service carried a three-part series
claiming that teenagers who use marijuana just once in a year are
ten times more likely to be involved in violent crimes than
non-users.&nbsp; Of course, no comparable numbers were given for
alcohol use.&nbsp; This is the sort of &quot;reporting&quot; that
leads to the shooting of a 15 year-old by a drunken narc, which
-- of course -- was not mentioned in the Gannett articles.&nbsp;
So much for their concern for teenage violence.</p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b><u>Update</u></b>:&nbsp; The U.S. Sentencing
Commission is considering an amendment that impacts cannabis consumers.&nbsp;
The following is from the Drug Reform Coordination Network
(DRCNet):</p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Earlier this spring, the U.S. Sentencing
Commission passed some amendments to the federal sentencing
guidelines that would reform the penalty structure for certain
drug offenses. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><u>One amendment</u>, passed 7-0, would change the plant-weight
ratio use for marijuana to 1 plant = 100 grams.&nbsp; (Currently
1 plant is considered 100 grams for 49 plants or fewer, but
becomes 1 kilo [1000 grams] for 50 plants or more, with the
effect that defendants convicted for 50 plants spend almost 3
times as long in prison as those convicted for 49 plants.) <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><u>A second amendment</u>, would provide a two point reduction in
offense level for certain non-violent, first time offenders who
qualify for the &quot;safety-valve&quot; exemption included in
last year's Crime Bill.&nbsp; This Amendment essentially matches
the exemption the law now grants from the mandatory minimum
statutes. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The amendments will become law if Congress doesn't act by
November 1 to overturn them.&nbsp; <b><i>Clarification</i></b><i>:&nbsp;
What the Sentencing Commission </i><i><u>has not decided</u></i><i>
yet is whether the amendments will apply retroactively to current
inmates.</i> <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Please write the commission and ask them to make the following
amendments retroactive: </p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="5" width="100%">
