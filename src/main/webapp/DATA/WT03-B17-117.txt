<H2><B>History of ACTCM</H2></B><P>

<P><H4>

The American College of Traditional Chinese Medicine is a private independent graduate 

school founded in 1980 as a nonprofit corporation.  The American College of Traditional 

Chinese Medicine is governed by a Board of Directors and the College is administered by 

officers appointed by the Board. 

<P>

The historical development of the College started in January 1981 with the entry of the first 

class of 34 students.  Lectures were first given in the upper floor of a private residence and 

in May 1981, the College moved to 2400 Geary Blvd.  In 1983, an adjoining building at 1303

-05 Baker Street was leased to provide additional classroom and office facilities.  In November 

1987, the College acquired its present campus at 455 Arkansas Street in the Potrero District of

San Francisco providing the College community with modern educational facilities.  

<P>

From 1981 to 1984, the College offered a two year (eight quarter) professional certificate program

which qualified students for the profession and licensure in eleven states. 

<P>

In 1984 a professional degree curriculum was developed in response to the upgrading of licensure 

standards by the California Acupuncture Committee which sought to make the level of professional 

education for Chinese medicine commensurate with expansion of the scope of practice to primary 

health care responsibility. The new degree program is supported by carefully defined pre-professional

requirements to insure the necessary foundation for graduate studies in Chinese medicine.  Students

now enter the College with a baccalaureate degree that combines studies in the humanities and the 

sciences.

<P>

On December 15, 1986, the Superintendent of Public Instruction approved the American College 

of Traditional Chinese Medicine as a California Degree-Granting Institution.  This approval allows 

the College to offer a Master of Science (M.S.) degree in Traditional Chinese Medicine.  The 

approval marked the first recognition of traditional Chinese medicine as a graduate discipline within 

American higher education.  In 1990, the College was reapproved as a California Degree-Granting

Institution offering the Master of Science (M.S.) in Traditional Chinese Medicine.

<P>

In 1981, the College started the Clinical Training Program in its Community Clinic.  The Community 

Clinic provides low-cost health care through the use of traditional Chinese medicine to the people of 

San Francisco and the greater Bay Area.  In the Community Clinic, students, under the supervision of 

Attending Practitioners gain practical experience in the application of acupuncture and traditional Chinese

 herbal prescriptions for the treatment of disease.

<P></H4>

<HR>

<H2><B>Admissions</H2></B><P>

<P><H4>

to its Masters degree program, mature students with demonstrated academic

Fall quarter.  Applicants for admission to the part-time Non-degree  program
