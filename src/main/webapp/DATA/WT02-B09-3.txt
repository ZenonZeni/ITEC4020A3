<p align=center><strong>HENRY GEORGE, TAX REFORM AND THE CANADIAN ECONOMY</strong></p>
<p>From June 17 to 22 the Council of Georgist Organizations held its annual meeting in Santo Domingo, Dominican 
Republic. The conference was organized by the Henry George School of Social Science of Santo Domingo. The 
energetic and much-loved, Lucy Silfa, the founder and director of the School, hosted the gathering of economists, 
tax experts and scholars. Ben Sevack of Montreal attended in his capacity as President of the Canadian Research 
Committee on Taxation and represented Canada along with the writer.<br>
</p>
<p>Why would representatives from the United States, Argentina, the Cayman Islands, Canada and the Dominican 
Republic itself meet to discuss as a matter of vital contemporary concern the little known works of the 
nineteenth-century American philosopher and economist Henry George? The answer lies in recognizing the cause 
of the malaise that is currently gripping the political, economic and social institutions of societies around the world 
and in the studied inability of these institutions to account in a convincing way for the problems they perpetrate. 
These institutions systematically discourage what is beneficial to the community while subsidizing and rewarding the 
unproductive and environmental degradation.<br>
</p>
<p>There is a tendency today to link intuitively the global and the competitive. On the other hand, seldom are the 
reasons for the current worldwide economic downturn universalized so that the distortions of economic life which 
make it possible and profitable to grow bananas in Scotland are not unlike the distortions of the property tax in 
Montreal which contribute to urban blight, unaffordable housing and the wasteful subsidization of land speculation. 
It is primarily the structure of taxation not necessarily its level which impedes economic life.<br>
Henry George's fundamental theme in his well known Progress and Poverty, and in other works such as Social 
Problems, Protection or Free Trade, and the Science of Political Economy is that the burden of running society 
should fall the least upon those activities that are beneficial to the well-being of the community and more on those 
activities that are a detriment to social and economic betterment.<br>
</p>
<p>What does this philosophy mean in practice? A good example would be the current efforts of Georgist 
organizations in Canada to promote meaningful and genuine reform to a system of taxation that has become in all its 
prosaic complexity a tremendous burden on the Canadian economy and indeed on the spirit of the nation.<br>
The two tier or two rate method of property taxation, advocated by some Georgist organizations such as the 
Peterborough, Ontario Two Tier Property Tax Committee in its Report of January, 1992, lowers the tax burden 
on buildings and improvements. The trade-off is that revenue from holding land idle and underutilized is increased. 
The tax system is thus adjusted to give those who are contributing constructively to the community a break. High 
housing costs, land speculation, costly urban sprawl and the overall deterioration of our cities are some of the 
negatives ameliorated by this tax. Fairness in taxation is not simply a matter of promoting greater equity, it must be 
a matter of structuring taxes so as to reduce social overhead costs while at the same time creating more wealth for 
all to share less unequally.<br>
</p>
<p>Henry George is not only the inspiration for equitable land reform and economic advancement in impoverished 
countries like the Dominican Republic. Canada and the U.S. are becoming more and more impoverished and 
polarized primarily because the counter-productive tax and expenditure policies of the government work 
incrementally to undermine the social, economic and psychological fabric upon which the liberal democracies were 
founded. There is a cruel irony here for traditional liberals. Progressive social programs do not achieve their 
objectives because the revenue engine created to fund them exacerbates the conditions which necessitate the 
programs. Hence the current downward spiral of increasing expenditures achieving less and less social justice and 
increasing taxes requiring greater social expenditures.<br>
</p>
<p>It is the knowledge that there are viable, and yet generally unknown, alternatives to the current malaise that brought 
participants in the various Georgist organizations together in Santo Domingo. George's life and work encompass 
abiding insights into human nature and socio-economic relations. The non-profit Georgist research organizations, 
their paid professionals and volunteers, work diligently to undertake and promote research into the detailed 
economic application of Georgist principles to modern economic circumstances. The result has been a diverse yet 
coherent and still growing body of research that is beginning to have a wide-ranging influence in academic, 
governmental and business circles.<br>
</p>
<p>While in Santo Domingo, a delegation from the Georgist organizations met with President Joachim Balaguer, who 
was a student of the Georgist philosophy while in exile in the U.S. in the 1960s. The Dominican Republic, like 
many other countries, is burdened with an immense foreign debt, increasing poverty and malnutrition, and the 
continual decay of basic infrastructure. The persistent interruption of electrical power in Santo Domingo is just one 
of the more visible hardships. Land and tax reforms on the Georgist model in the Dominican Republic will be 
difficult on account of the concentration of landownership among 35 or 40 families. Everyone was enthusiastic that 
a reform would finally be undertaken which would result in real change for the 7 million citizens of the Dominican 
Republic. How long can the institutions of the status quo hold out against a philosophy of economics that is a 
theoretical and practical answer to the same detrimental policies that have strangled such seemingly different 
economies as those of Canada and the Dominican Republic?</p>
