<P>
Most outsiders probably think that the fund accountant's work
is done once the funds' NAVs or unit values are cut each afternoon.
In fact, if you manage the fund accounting team, you know that
some of the most critical work still remains to be done: getting
the correct information to the people and systems that need it.
<P>
FundStation was built for this purpose. FundStation collects,
calculates and distributes all the information to all the places
it needs to go. This information includes NAVs, yields, expense
ratios, and total rates of return and FundStation distributes
it regardless of whether that information needs to arrive on paper,
fax, e-mail or in a data file.
<H2><A HREF="detail-addedvalue.htm" >Benefits </A></H2>

<P>
Consider some of the benefits you can realize with FundStation:

<LI>Elimination of data entry errors
<LI>Increased control over end-of-day processing; reduced stress
<LI>Quicker delivery of information to clients
<LI>Customized delivery of information to clients
<LI>Quicker delivery of pricing data to other systems (shareholder
recordkeeping, et al)
<LI>Accurate and timely calculations of yields and total rates
of return
<LI>Automated preparation and delivery of reports/data to third-party
agencies
<LI>Ability to process increased volumes without increasing staff

</UL>

<H2>Process Overview </H2>

<P>
FundStation achieves these benefits by automating many of the
processes currently performed manually by the fund accounting
or transfer agency teams. FundStation performs the following tasks:
<UL>
<LI>Extract pricing data from the fund accounting system(s)
<LI>Calculate yields for the previous one, seven and thirty days
<LI>Calculate total rates of return for a large range of time
periods
<LI>Transfer NAVs and income amounts to the shareholder recordkeeping
system(s)
<LI>Transfer NAVs and distribution amounts to other systems (trust,
defined contribution, voice response units)
<LI>Distribute fund pricing data daily via the Daily Fund Profile
(DFP) to external clients via FAX, E-mail, hardcopy or direct
file transmission 
<LI>Provide a repository of descriptive and historical pricing
data to facilitate regulatory and third-party reporting (Lipper,
Morningstar, ICI, NASDAQ)

No changes are required to the existing fund accounting system.
<H3>Data Feeds to Other Systems </H3>

<P>
Transfer data from the fund accounting system into other applications,
including shareholder recordkeeping, trust accounting, participant
recordkeeping or voice response systems. This can often be done
without changes to existing systems. FundStation will also transfer
data to PC applications like spreadsheets and databases in a variety
of formats.
<H3><A HREF="detail-AvailableYields.htm" >Yield Calculations </A>
</H3>

yields. 
<LI>Yields include simple and effective yields.
<LI>Yields can include or exclude capital gains.
<LI>Yields can include or exclude the fund's load. 
</UL>

<H3><A HREF="detail-AvailableReturns.htm" >Total Rates of Return Calculations </A>
</H3>

<UL>

and since inception of the fund.

or back-end loads.
<LI>Month-to-date, year-to-date and fiscal year-to-date RORs are
also available.
<LI>RORs can be calculated daily or at month end. 
</UL>

<H3>Customized Presentation </H3>

<P>
Use a different presentation format of the Daily Fund Profile
for each fund and each fund group. Users control the design and
layout of the report template, including any desired calculations
or graphics.
<H3>Automated Distribution </H3>

<P>
Specify different distributions to each client:
<UL>
<LI>the funds on which to report, 
<LI>the type of delivery (print, FAX, file, e-mail, special transmission),

<LI>the format of the data (which data and in what layout)
<LI>when to distribute the data (as soon as each fund's data is
received from fund accounting, as soon as all data for all of
a recipient's funds are available, at a specified time of day,
or only upon manual initiation). 
</UL>

<H3>Nasdaq Interface </H3>

<P>
FundStation will automatically submit NAVs and Money Market yields
to the NASDAQ system. This feature will be available in the Second
Quarter of 1995.
<H3>Third Party Reporting </H3>

<P>
FundStation provides the data and the reporting mechanisms to
automate the constant flow of information required by third-party
agencies. Information can be provided daily, weekly, monthly or
on other frequencies.
<H3>User-defined Fields </H3>

<P>
FundStation provides over one-hundred and twenty user-defined
fields of various types. Users have tremendous flexibility in
customizing their use of FundStation.
<H3>On-line, Real-time Status </H3>

<P>
FundStation provides users with an instantaneous status of each
fund and each client. Users see at a glance what work has been
completed and what still remains.
<H3>Data Repository </H3>

<P>
FundStation stores historical NAVs, rates and other pricing data
for as long as required. Reports and data files can be recreated
on an historical basis. Yields and rates of return can be calculated
as of any date stored in the database.
<H3>Flexible Reporting </H3>

<P>
FundStation provides the tools to create both predefined and ad-hoc
reports using any of the data stored in FundStation. Reports are
easy to build, even easier to run and can be set up to run right
from FundStation's main menu. Confluence is available to assist
in building additional reports, as needed.
<H3>System Calendar </H3>

<P>
Specify processing and non-processing days for each fund. FundStation
uses the calendars to determine the number of days for which a
rate is valid, based on weekend, end-of-the-month, and dividend
cycle considerations.
<H3>System Security </H3>

<P>
Restrict users to only authorized activities and funds. Access
is maintained by a System Administrator.
<H3>Process Control </H3>

<P>
During daily processing, users can require that each fund must
be manually released prior to FundStation distributing any of
its data. On-line review of tolerance reports and Daily Fund Profiles
ensure that all data is correct prior to its release. FundStation
also keeps an audit trail of all system activity. Authorized users
can determine what activities happened, when they happened and
who performed them.
<H3>Data Conversion </H3>

<P>
Confluence will convert historical data from any existing system
to FundStation. This allows for calculation of yields and rates
of return on the first day of live processing.
