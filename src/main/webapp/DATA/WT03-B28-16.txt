NTSB TARGETED FOR MORE MONEY FROM SENATE FOR 1992

Senate Appropriations Committee has recommended increased funding for the
National Transportation Safety Board in fiscal 1992, including $1.5
million more for salaries and expenses than the $34.2 million approved by
the House. The committee specified that NTSB use the extra money to
relocate to new offices and for laboratory space. The amount recommended
provides for 360 full-time employees, an increase of 16 over fiscal 1991.
Aviation safety accounts for the largest portion of the funding -- $12.6
million.
   The Senate also suggested the same level for the essential air service
program as did the House bill (H.R. 2942) (DAILY, Sept. 13). Both chambers
recommended funding the requested level of $38.6 million, which is $12
million more than last year. The carrier projected to receive substantially
more than any other is Exec Express II at an estimated annual compensation
of $3.6 million.
   The Senate report accompanying the bill contains several general
provisions that are not included in the House version, or are changed from
the House version. Aviation-related provisions: -- Direct the DOT secretary
to prepare and implement a plan for providing slots at Chicago O'Hare
Airport for essential air service carriers. -- Allow FAA to increase the
amount of an airport improvement grant for Ames, Iowa. -- Allow for the
sale of Atlantic City Airport to proceed. -- Make a technical legislative
change that allows soundproofing of public/private buildings to be paid
with airport improvement grant funds. -- Allow combination aircraft to
operate in Alaska until FAA conducts a study. -- Allow the DOT secretary to
enter into a sole-source contract with the Puerto Rico Ports Authority for
the construction of an air traffic control tower. In 1991, $4 million was
appropriated for the project, which was to be arranged through a five-year
lease/purchase agreement. The administration now wants to fund the
procurement fully, which may delay other major airport improvements. The
tower and these improvements must be concurrently constructed; otherwise
line-of-sight safety may be diminished. -- Allow the FAA and Nashville
Airport to use airport improvement formula grant funds to relocate an ASR-9
air traffic radar and to purchase a temporary VORTAC system. -- Direct the
DOT secretary to conduct a noise impact study covering New York and
Connecticut to determine ways to reduce airport noise. It will go far
enough north to cover Stewart Airport in the Newburgh/Poughkeepsie area,
and also will encompass the Westchester, Staten Island, Queens and Nassau
areas. -- Direct the DOT secretary to issue regulations on airports'
ability to conduct criminal background checks for security purposes.
   House Appropriations Committee staff member Tom Kingfield last week
predicted that if the Senate is able to get the appropriations bill to the
floor soon, the two chambers could go to conference in early October and
have a package for the President to sign by mid-October. He said aviation
benefits well in both the Senate and House funding levels, noting that the
House recommendation of appropriating $8.9 billion for FAA is a 200%
increase from just 10 years ago. The Airport Improvement Program,
recommended at $1.9 billion, is up from $450 million in 1982, an increase
of 300%. Prospects for satisfactory funding of aviation programs in the
near future, however, are not looking bright. In fiscal 1994 and 1995,
there will be only one cap on spending, which will be over total domestic
spending, meaning competition among individual government agencies will be
fierce.
   Kingfield, addressing the American Association of Airport Executives and
Airport Operators Council International fall legislative issues conference,
said airport operators are fortunate they have the passenger facility
charge (PFC) to fall back on. They were advised, however, to break the link
that ties the full funding of AIP with allowing the charge of PFCs,
considering AIP probably will not be appropriated at the full level.

DOT is expected early this week to grant antitrust immunity for airlines to
discuss schedule adjustments at Honolulu Airport. The federal inspection
services have refused to accept any new arrivals in the overcrowded
international arrivals building between 5 a.m. and 10 a.m., presenting
problems for All Nippon Airways' new service to Honolulu.

NORTHWEST RETREAT FROM SHUTTLE DEAL OPENS DOOR FOR OTHERS

Collapse of the Northwest-Trump Shuttle deal leaves Trump in tough
financial straits and an opportunity for another carrier to step in and
purchase the assets or operation at relatively little cost. Airlines said
to be interested in the New York-Washington-Boston operation include
American, United and USAir. American, according to sources, has offered
$115 million for pieces of the operation, including gates and valuable
takeoff and landing slots. Delta paid $113 million for the Pan Am shuttle
operation, but that transaction was part of a larger deal that included
European routes, a number of aircraft and an investment in a revamped Pan
Am.
   USAir showed interest in the airline in earlier discussions, but
financial troubles at the carrier make an acquisition of the operation or
the bulk of the assets unlikely. While United is said to have expressed
interest in the shuttle, an attempt to purchase the airline could face
Justice Department opposition because of United's strong presence in the
Washington, D.C., area. The government objected to efforts by that airline
to purchase Eastern gates and slots at Washington National Airport earlier
this year. Those assets wound up being sold to Northwest.
   The Trump Shuttle, although in financial trouble, has enough cash to
operate at least through the end of the month, one source told The DAILY.
The carrier has been earning a steady stream of money from its charter
operations, and its revenues are up slightly, as business travel in the
market has returned after the slow summer period. But the Trump
organization and its shuttle operation still face a heavy debt burden.
Trump bought the shuttle from Eastern in 1989 for $365 million and has
invested tens of millions of dollars in refurbishing the operation's 727
aircraft and fitting them with hush kits. Meanwhile, the market has
contracted drastically over the past few years, pushing revenues down
sharply.
   Signs were evident as early as two weeks ago that the deal might be
falling apart (DAILY, Sept. 6) Northwest said it was unable to conclude an
agreement with its Machinists union that would allow it to assume control
of the shuttle, but one union leader at Trump suggested that an impasse
with the union might be a way for Northwest to back out of the transaction.
A lack of money on the part of Northwest, stiffening competition from Delta
and the possibility of a deal with Continental, which could give Northwest
a shuttle operation all are likely to have contributed to the decision to
pull back.
   While other unions at the carrier agreed to alter their contracts to go
ahead with the deal, Machinists had been holding out for several
concessions. One included a provision to put Trump workers at pay parity
with employees at Northwest, a move which would have cost Northwest more
than $10 million extra, one source said. Other conditions were that they be
automatically recognized as the collective bargaining agent of the ticket
agents at Trump and that a rival union, Aircraft Mechanics Fraternal
Association, agree to step down as the representatives of mechanics at
Trump, which AMFA agreed to with some conditions.
   Delta took possession of the Pan Am Shuttle at the beginning of the
month. The carrier initially had some problems integrating the airline into
its operation but now says those problems have been worked out. A Delta
spokeswoman said the carrier has been running extra sections almost daily
during the week to accommodate passengers and has established an on-time
record so far of about 95%.

DOT ASKS CARRIERS FOR INTEREST IN GREECE-PARIS BEFORE DESIGNATING UNITED

United has notified DOT it holds the requisite operating authority to
provide service between Paris and Greece and has asked the department to
notify the Greek government that it plans to exercise its fifth-freedom
traffic rights. Under the U.S.-Greece air agreement, only one U.S. carrier
may be awarded the traffic rights. Before DOT designates United, it has
asked all interested carriers to file applications no later than Sept. 24.
Under the bilateral agreement, only once carrier may serve Greece from
Boston and only one from Chicago, with only of those allowed to serve
Paris.

LOT POLISH AIRLINES ORDERS NINE 737S

LOT, national carrier of Poland, ordered nine 737 -400 and -500 aircraft
from Boeing to be delivered between 1992 and 1994. New aircraft are to be
used on LOT's intra-European routes. LOT now has three 767s and is pursuing
options for five more with delivery in 1994. Earlier last week, the Polish
government refused to investigate an aircraft deal in which McDonnell
Douglas claimed it had a firm commitment from LOT for the purchase of its
aircraft (DAILY, Sept. 9).

BAA REDUCES TRAFFIC GROWTH FORECAST

BAA plc, formerly the British Airports Authority, has reduced its forecast
of traffic growth over the next five years. BAA, an airport management and
development company, now expects to handle a total of 86.5 million
passengers in 1995, a decrease of 3.5 million from the number it predicted
a year ago. But BAA also said that, over the 15-year forecast, annual
passenger traffic is expected to grow from the current 74 million to
between 115 million and 150 million, implying average growth of between 3%
and 4.8% anually. U.K.-based BAA said it reduced its forecast because of
the depth of the current recession.
   BAA's core business is the ownership and operation of airports.
Through its subsidiaries at London Heathrow, London Gatwick, London
Stansted, Glasgow, Edinburgh, Prestwick, Aberdeen and South-ampton, BAA
handles 70% of U.K. passenger traffic and 85% of air cargo. Company
forecasts that air transport movements will grow at an average rate of
1.7% to 2.4% per year,with levels by 2005 reaching 30% to 40% higher than
in 1990. Cargo tonnage also is expected to grow, with volume by 2005
expected to be between 40% and 100% higher than that recorded in 1990.

IATA CALLS FOR GOVERNMENT TO DROP PLANS FOR APHIS FEE

International Air Transport Association (IATA) is the latest to put
pressure on the Agriculture Department to withdraw its proposal to charge
user fees to pay for aircraft inspection by the Animal and Plant Health
Inspection Service (APHIS). IATA said it believes the fee would "contravene
the obligations of the United States under the Chicago Convention, U.S. air
transport services agreements and U.S. treaties of friendship, commerce and
navigation." Several foreign carriers have complained about the proposed
fees, saying they violate air agreements. IATA said a rule setting up the
fee would exceed the service's statutory mandate.

UNITED LOOKING AT SINGAPORE AS POSSIBLE HUB

United plans to build on its presence at Singapore over the next few years
and sees an opportunity to develop a small connecting hub there, according
to William Speicher, senior VP-Pacific. Speicher said United has informed
the government of Singapore that the airline is considering flying to other
destinations in the region -- such as Malaysia and Indonesia -- from
Singapore. Carrier currently operates three flights a day from Singapore
and has just won approval from the government of Singapore to build an
8,000-square-foot passenger lounge at Changi Airport. Speicher said United
would not have made the type of financial commitment it has made in
Singapore if it did not intend to grow at Changi. United's primary
Asia/Pacific region hub is Tokyo, and it has smaller hub operations at
Seoul and Taipei.
    In 1990, Pacific division traffic growth accounted for much of
United's full-year increase in systemwide revenue passenger miles. But
1991 has been a different story. Through the first eight months this year,
United's Pacific division traffic was down 3.5% from a year ago. Large
part of the problem has been the slow recovery of traffic from Japan since
the end of the Gulf War. Japanese traffic did not return to even 1990
levels until last month, and Speicher said traffic in the market will
probably remain flat, compared to 1990, for the rest of this year. He
described the Japanese market as the cornerstone of United's Pacific
division.
   Decline in United's Pacific RPMs also can be traced to the carrier's
relatively small growth for the year. Through the first eight months this
year, its Pacific division capacity increased only 4.5% from year- ago
levels, which is nearly 12 percentage points below the carrier's plan for
the year. Speicher said the airline had planned to increase its Pacific
capacity 16% this year, but when the year is over, the gain will probably
be only 4% over 1990. United's traffic also has been diluted by an increase
in overall available capacity in the Asia/Pacific region. Speicher said
capacity in the area is finally beginning to catch up with demand. United's
Pacific plans for 1992 do not include any new routes, but the carrier does
plan to switch existing aircraft for 747-400s on some routes. Overall,
United expects its Pacific capacity to increase 8%-10% next year.

AMERICA WEST, NORTHWEST SIGN STANDSTILL AGREEMENT

America West has signed a standstill agreement with Northwest that
precludes any merger or takeover activity between the two airlines for the
duration of their 10-year marketing alliance. Standstill agreement is
subject to approval by the bankruptcy court in the America West Chapter 11
proceeding. Agreement, however, contains an escape clause releasing
Northwest from the terms of the pact should a third party attempt a hostile
takeover of America West. Also, the pact will not affect Northwest's
two-year option to acquire America West's Honolulu- Nagoya route or America
West's two-year put option, which would require Northwest to buy the route
if requested to do so by America West.
   "This standstill agreement reaffirms both our intentions and those of
Northwest that the marketing alliance is not a prelude to any change of
control," said Michael Conway, president ofAmerica West, who adds the title
of chief executive this week. "We entered into the agreement based on our
conviction that both airlines would benefit by working together as
independent carriers, and nothing has occurred to alter that view," he
said.
   While the marketing agreement may not be a prelude to any change in
control, Northwest will have at least a voice in America West's operations.
Agreements signed by America West with Northwest and GPA, which together
are putting up $55 million in debtor-in-possession financing for America
West, give GPA and Northwest each one seat on America West's board. Pact
also call for America West to establish a five-member executive committee
of the board to monitor the company's progress against its operating plan.
Board is to be composed of representatives from GPA, America West's primary
aircraft supplier, and Northwest in addition to three members selected by
the board.
   Conway said America West and Northwest are meeting to work out the
details of the code-sharing and joint marketing efforts that will initially
include feeding passengers between America West's route network and
Northwest's Pacific gateways. Marketing alliance also includes the
possibility for mutually agreed upon passenger and cargo fare proration
levels; the review and possible consolidation of frequently flyer and other
marketing programs; the reciprocal use of airport clubs, as well as the
review and revisions to mutual benefit of service levels to certain
cities.

VASP TARGETING WEST COAST FOR SERVICE FROM BRAZIL

Brazilian carrier Vasp has requested an exemption from DOT to allow it to
provide scheduled combination service to Los Angeles and San Francisco from
Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paulo and Manaus via Lima, Peru. The carrier said it
intends to begin operating three weekly flights from the Brazilian cities
to Los Angeles with continuing service to San Francisco Oct. 26. On Oct.
27, it plans to offer one weekly flight from only Rio de Janeiro and Sao
Paulo to Los Angeles and San Francisco via Lima. All flights would use
255-seat DC-10-30 aircraft.
   "VASP makes this request as the first step of its effort to inject
competition into the United States-Brazil markets," the carrier said.
VASP's new international directorate has made international growth and
improvement in service its top priorities for 1991, the carrier said. It
also asked DOT to make a decision on its request no later than tomorrow.
As of Dec. 31, 1990, VASP's fleet consisted of 21 737-200s, 10 737-300s,
three A300 B2s and two 737-200 all-cargo aircraft. It has since obtained
more cargo aircraft and the DC-10s for the service to the West Coast.
Several U.S. carriers currently are involved in a selection proceeding to
win new rights to serve Brazil. (Docket 47745)

NIPPON CARGO SEEKS QUICK ACTION ON CERTIFICATE AMENDMENT

Nippon Cargo Airlines has asked DOT to take immediate action on its request
to serve several U.S. cities from Tokyo, which it filed almost eight months
ago. The carrier asked that it be authorized on its certificate to provide
all-cargo service to co-terminal points San Francisco and New York, Chicago
and New York and Los Angeles and San Francisco. Nippon requests action no
later than Oct. 15.
   The carrier's permit currently allows it to conduct nine scheduled
frequencies per week from Tokyo to San Francisco and New York, as well as
provide additional flights per year, and to conduct charter flights. NCA
was granted exemptions in March to co-terminalize its service to Chicago
with New York and its service to San Francisco with Los Angeles. That
authority was granted for only a short term because of U.S. concerns about
landing slots at Tokyo Narita Airport, and expires Oct. 28. The carrier,
therefore, is asking the department to add the Chicago/Los Angeles
co-terminalization authority (Docket 47387)

LEBANESE AIRLINES SEEKS PERMISSION TO FLY DIGNITARIES TO U.N. ASSEMBLY

Middle East Airlines Airliban (MEA) has requested an emergency exemption
from DOT to operate one roundtrip charter from Beirut to New York on or
about Sept. 21 and from New York to Beirut Sept. 27. The purpose of the
trip is to transport Lebanon's president, prime minister and speaker of the
house to attend the General Assembly of the United Nations. A 747- 200
would be chartered for the trip. MEA in the past operated Lebanon- New York
flights via Paris, but the carrier's exemption was revoked in 1985 because
of the volatile political situation in Lebanon and "the possibility of
interference with aircraft bound for the U.S. while on the ground in
Lebanon." (Docket 47746)

OLYMPIC AIRWAYS TAKES FIRST 737-400

Olympic Airways has taken delivery of its first 737-400, its first jet from
Boeing in 10 years, and the first in the carrier's new livery, Boeing
announced. With the delivery, Boeing confirmed that Greece's flag carrier
has ordered six 737-400s and taken options on six more. Value of the firm
orders is approximately $220 million. Loukas Grammatikos, Olympic's
director general, said the airline ordered the aircraft to continue
expansion of its medium-range fleet and to begin replacing less efficient
727s, which the airline has been flying since the late 1960s.
   Grammatikos also said that, with the delivery of the new aircraft, the
airline is eliminating its current first and business classes and replacing
them with "Olympian Executive Class," which it described as a high-quality
business-class service. He also said Olympic will be one of the few
European airlines offering inflight movies on flights in Europe and the
Middle East.

United is seeing a change in the booking pattern of Japanese travelers.
Where reservations used to be made three to six months in advance, they are
now being made three weeks to two months in advance, and the Japanese seem
to be moving away from the practice of traveling in large groups, which
could mean higher revenue traffic from Japan if the trend continues.
