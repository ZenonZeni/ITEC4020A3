<H1>Are Soy Products Dangerous?</H1>
<P><B>by Charlotte Gerson</B>, with portions reprinted by
permission of <I>Newlife Magazine</I></P>
<P>A considerable percentage of the world's population is
undernourished or outright starving. For many years,
proteins, preferably from animal sources, have been
considered to be the best and most acceptable source of
nutrients. However, we also know that it takes some 16 pounds
of grains, fed to cows, to produce one pound of meat. In his
book <I>Diet for a New America</I>, author John Robbins
points out that we could easily feed the whole world if
everyone were to become vegetarian. This is an unlikely
scenario in the affluent Western world. So, in order to try
to feed the hungry, we are always looking for new sources of
&quot;good&quot; protein. </P>
<P>Much attention has been focused on the soy bean, a widely
grown legume that fulfills both the requirement for a high
protein food and a widely publicized health advantage: it is
low in fat and devoid of cholesterol! This should make it an
ideal food, but is it safe?</P>
<P>An extensive discussion on the subject written by Sally
W. Fallon, M.A., and Mary G. Enig, Ph.D. appeared in the May
1966 edition of <I>Newlife </I>magazine. Since we have often
been asked by a number of our <I>Gerson Healing
Newsletter</I> readers why Dr. Gerson prohibited soy
products, we should like to report on this thoroughly
researched material.</P>
<P>The authors trace the origin of the soy bean to the
Orient, where it was apparently used during the Chou Dynasty
(1134-246 BCE) as a crop rotation material, for its capacity
of fixing nitrogen in the soil. Soy products did not serve as
food until fermentation techniques were developed. When a
method was developed to make soy into a curd by precipitating
it with calcium sulfate or magnesium sulfate, the use of soy
products started to spread. Fermented soy products, such as
miso and tamari sauce, are apparently less harmful than the
precipitated ones, such as tofu or bean curd. But tofu
accounts for about 90% of the processed soybeans in Asia
today, say the authors. It seems that bean curds as a source
of protein did not come into use until about 700 A.D.</P>
<P>Fallon and Enig state that the &quot;Chinese did not eat
the soybean as they did other legumes, such as lentils,
because the soybean contains large quantities of a number of
harmful substances.&quot; Did the Chinese know this? Perhaps
they did, possibly they observed that disease symptoms
appeared after eating tofu or other cooked soy products.
Among the harmful substances, the authors name &quot;potent
enzyme inhibitors, which block the action of trypsin and
other enzymes needed for protein digestion.&quot; Apparently,
cooking does not deactivate these enzyme inhibitors, and they
can produce serious digestive problems such as reduced
protein digestion, chronic deficiencies in amino acid uptake,
enlargement of the pancreas (in animals) and cancer. </P>
<P>Soy products also contain another chemical, hemaglutinin
which promotes clumping of red blood cells. These clumped red
cells are unable to fully take up oxygen and carry it in the
blood stream to all tissues. Hemaglutinin has also been
observed to act as a growth depressant. Fermentation
deactivates these enzyme inhibitors, or at least reduces the
amounts present.</P>
<P>Soybeans are also high in phytic acids which is present
in the bran of hulls of all seeds. This material blocks the
uptake of essential minerals in the intestinal tract,
including such important ones as calcium, magnesium, iron and
especially zinc. Again, only the process of fermentation will
significantly reduce the phytate content of soy products.
Soybeans have a higher content of phytates than any other
legumes, making them of questionable safety and nutritional
value.</P>
<P>Bearing the above in mind, the authors feel that soy
products consumed with meat have a reduced mineral blocking
effect; however they warn particularly that vegetarians who
eat tofu with the idea that it may act as a protein
substitute, risk severe mineral deficiencies. They also feel
that most people appreciate the problems of calcium,
magnesium and iron deficiencies, but that zinc deficiency
produces some especially serious problems: zinc is needed for
optimal development and function of the brain and nervous
system, aside from its role in the immune system.</P>
<P><B>The profit motive</B>. </P>
<P>The average American has not adopted soy products (tofu,
tempeh, miso) as a principal food. Soy sauce may be the
exception to this rule, even though soy oil is also quite
widely used. About 140 billion pounds of soy beans per year
are grown in the US since the end of W.W.II, and the industry
is looking for new markets. At this time, the major use for
the bean is animal feed, and soy oil is used for hydrogenated
fats, margarine and shortening. New soy products are being
marketed to the growing &quot;health product&quot; consumers:
soy milk, soy baby formula, soy yogurt, soy ice cream, soy
cheese, soy flour for baking, and soy protein as a meat
substitute for the vegetarians. </P>
<P>During the production of soy milk, in order to remove as
much of the trypsin inhibitor as possible, the pur&eacute;ed
beans are soaked in an alkaline solution, then heated to
about 115&#186; C. in a pressure cooker. Unfortunately, even
though most (but not all) of the antinutrients are destroyed,
this processing also denatures the proteins, so the remaining
soy protein is very difficult to digest. The phytate content
remains in soy milk to block the uptake of essential
minerals. Worse, the alkaline soaking solution produces a
carcinogen, lysinealine, and reduces the cystine (an amino
acid) content in the soybean. Without cystine, the protein
complex is virtually useless unless the diet is fortified
with meat, eggs or dairy products, an unlikely situation for
vegetarians. </P>
<P>These problems arising from soy production are not
mentioned on labels, and the public is not aware of
them.&quot;Soy based infant formulas, along with trypsin
inhibitors, contain a high phytate level. Use of soy formula
has caused zinc deficiency in infants. Aluminum content of
soy formula is ten times greater than milk-based formula and
100 times greater than unprocessed milk.&quot; While soy milk
is tried on infants with milk allergies, allergy to soy
products is almost as common. The lack of cholesterol in soy
infant formula could inhibit brain development since
cholesterol is essential for the brain and nervous system.
Chemical additives to soy based foods further add to the
problems. </P>
<P>Soy products are widely distributed in third world
countries, presumably to overcome a protein deficiency in the
diets of starving people. They are also used extensively in
school lunch programs, commercial baked goods, diet beverages
and fast food products. New publicity promotes soy products
for their &quot;cancer preventing properties&quot;. While
traditionally fermented soy products may contain a cancer
preventing chemical, these are contained in an altered state
in non-fermented soy products and have no anti-carcinogenic
effect. On the contrary, it has been suggested that the rapid
increase of liver and pancreatic cancer in Africa is due to
the increased use of soy products.&quot;...to remove oil from
the soy bean, particularly high pressures and temperatures
are required, since this is an unusually difficult process.
Furthermore, hexane or other solvents are always used to
extract oil from soy beans, and traces remain in the
commercial product. But the high temperatures destroy some of
the possible beneficial fatty acid fractions of the soy oil:
the Omega-3's, which are especially susceptible to rancidity
when subjected to high pressures and temperatures.&quot; </P>
<P>&quot;Claims that the fermented soy products can be
relied on as a source of B12 have not been supported by
scientific research.&quot; Nor do they supply the essential
fat soluble vitamins D and A, needed for the absorption of
all minerals. Unfortunately, soy products increase the
requirements for vitamin B12 and D.</P>
<P>The authors summarize all the above, and possible
arguments that soy products have been used for many centuries
in the Orient, as follows: &quot;traditional fermented soy
products have a long history of use that is generally
beneficial when combined with other elements of the Oriental
diet including rice, sea foods, fish broth and fermented
vegetables. Precipitated (Western) soy products can cause
serious problems, especially when they form the major source
of protein in the diet.&quot; </P>
