<HR>
<H1><A NAME="HDRMOREAB" HREF="icsurmst.html#ToC_6">Chapter 2. More about your server</A></H1>
<P>
The IBM Internet Connection Secure Server
provides the foundation for building your
company's presence on the Internet.
Your business can use the Internet Connection Secure Server on the World
Wide Web to reach customers and suppliers around the world.
Or you can use the Internet Connection Secure Server
within your business to communicate with employees.
<P>
With the IBM Internet Connection Secure Server, your business can implement
Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)
to ensure that your business transactions are secure.
<P>
This chapter describes some of the key features of the server.
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Header_7" HREF="icsurmst.html#ToC_7">Installing and configuring the server</A></H2>
<P>
You can easily install the server using the
OS/2 installation tool, Software Installer.
<P>
After you install the server, you can start it using the
configuration values you specified during installation.
Default values are supplied for all the other configuration values.
Using a Web browser, you can then connect to the server.
<P>
Once you connect to your server, you'll see the Front Page, which it
uses as its home page.
The Front Page provides a valuable assortment of
tools and information, including links to:
<UL COMPACT>
<LI>Configuration and Administration Forms
<LI>Sample Home Page
<LI>Internet Connection Family Web Site
<LI>Documentation
</UL>
For installation steps, see <A HREF="icsur006.html#HDRINS">Chapter 4. "Installing your server"</A>.
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Header_8" HREF="icsurmst.html#ToC_8">Using other programs with the server</A></H2>
<P>
The server supports the Common Gateway Interface (CGI),
which allows you to create external programs (CGI programs)
that interface with your server
and perform tasks such as searching and forwarding e-mail messages.
<P>
To assist you in writing CGI programs, the server
includes utilities for extracting forms data, writing
document headers, and processing image maps.
<P>The server also supports the Internet Connection
Application Programming Interface (ICAPI).
This interface is designed specifically for the server's
threaded processing and allows you to easily extend the server's
base functions.
Using the ICAPI you can write extensions to perform
site-specific processing, such as publishing customized
pages based on client's code level, enhancing the basic
authentication, and adding error routines to track problems
or alert you about serious conditions.
<P>
For more information, see the <CITE>Web Programming Guide</CITE>
and the <CITE>Webmaster's Guide</CITE>.
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Header_9" HREF="icsurmst.html#ToC_9">Managing your server with Simple Network Management Protocol</A></H2>
<P>The Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) subagent built
into Internet Connection Secure Server maintains server information and performance data
in an SNMP Management Information Base (MIB).
The MIB data describes the server being managed, reflects current
and recent server status, and provides server performance data.
From any SNMP-capable network manager, you can display, monitor,
and adjust thresholds for your server's performance to proactively
tune or fix server problems before they become server outages.
<P>
For more information, see the <CITE>Webmaster's Guide</CITE>.
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Header_10" HREF="icsurmst.html#ToC_10">Restricting access</A></H2>
<P>
Most likely, you will not want everyone to be able to access
all the information on your server.
For example, you probably would not want everyone to be able to
access your CGI programs.
<P>
You can restrict access based on user name and
password, or the address of the requester.
Access authorization is controlled using the configuration file and
possibly one or more other files, including:
<UL>
<P><LI>A protection setup, which defines the protection being used
<P><LI>A password file, which allows you to define user names and
passwords
<P><LI>A group file, which allows you to define groups of user names
<P><LI>An Access Control List (ACL) file, which allows you to define access
for individual files or groups of files on a protected directory
</UL>
For more information, see the <CITE>Webmaster's Guide</CITE>.
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Header_11" HREF="icsurmst.html#ToC_11">Mapping resources</A></H2>
<P>
You can create a virtual hierarchy of Web resources.
As part of the server's configuration, you can specify
resource mapping rules, which associate a request template
with the actual path to a document or resource.
Each request that comes to the server is checked against
these rules to determine if the request should be accepted
and where the requested resource is actually located.
<P>For more information, see the <CITE>Webmaster's Guide</CITE>.
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Header_12" HREF="icsurmst.html#ToC_12">Logging requests and errors</A></H2>
<P>
To help you determine whether or not your Internet message
is reaching the intended audience, you can keep <B><I>access logs</I></B>
that show who is accessing your server and when.
To see internal server errors, you can check your server's
<B><I>error logs</I></B>.
If your server is a caching proxy,
you can keep logs of requests
for cached files in a <B><I>cache access log</I></B>.
<P>
In addition, your server creates <B><I>agent logs</I></B>,
<B><I>referer logs</I></B>, and <B><I>CGI error logs</I></B>.
Agent logs
indicate which Web browser was used to access a Web page.
Referer logs indicate the page that linked to or referred to the page.
CGI error logs contain standard error output (stderr) from CGI
programs.
<P>
You can control what gets logged by filtering out entries
that match a particular pattern.
Your server automatically creates a report for each log,
so you can view the contents of the log.
You can modify these default report templates so that you include
and/or exclude log entries contained in the report.
<P>
Because the logs are written in a format that is common to most Web
servers, you can use any of several generic statistical programs to
analyze the log contents.
<P>
You can compress log data,
archive reports, and include old
log data in reports.
<P>For more information, see the <CITE>Webmaster's Guide</CITE>.
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Header_13" HREF="icsurmst.html#ToC_13">Running the server as a caching proxy</A></H2>
<P>
When you configure your server as a caching proxy server,
you can improve performance, as well as allow users
of your internal network to access documents on the Internet.
<P>
You can specify many configuration options
for a caching proxy, including:
<UL COMPACT>
<LI>Which files you want (and do not want) to store in cache
<LI>The maximum amount of space allotted to cache storage
<LI>Automatic reclamation of cache storage space
<LI>Routing of requests to other proxy servers
</UL>
<P>For more information, see the <CITE>Webmaster's Guide</CITE>.
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Header_14" HREF="icsurmst.html#ToC_14">Running the server with multiple IP addresses or virtual hosts</A></H2>
<P>
You can configure your server to serve different files based on
the IP address of the network connection a request comes in on
or the host for whom a request is made.
This is particularly valuable to Internet service
providers who want to use one server to provide Web sites for
multiple customers.
The server allows you to configure:
<UL>
<P><LI>Welcome Pages: to determine
how the server responds to requests that do not contain a file name
<P><LI>Mapping Rules: to set map requests to physical files
and to determine whether the server processes a request
<P><LI>Access Control: to activate different protection rules for
requests depending on which address the request comes in on or
which host name is specified in a URL
</UL>
<P>For more information, see the <CITE>Webmaster's Guide</CITE>.
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Header_15" HREF="icsurmst.html#ToC_15">Using server-side includes</A></H2>
<P>Server-side includes enable the server to do some processing
of Web pages before the page is sent to the client.
The current date, the size of the file, the last change of a file are
examples of the kind of information that can be sent to the client.
<P>For more information, see the <CITE>Webmaster's Guide</CITE>.
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Header_16" HREF="icsurmst.html#ToC_16">Customizing the server's error messages</A></H2>
<P>The Internet Connection Secure Server design is based on the work at CERN.
You can customize basic CERN messages that your server
sends back to the client when error conditions are encountered.
For example, you can change a message
to include more information about the cause of the
problem and suggest possible solutions to fix it.
For internal networks, you might provide
a contact person for your users to call.
<P>For more information, see the <CITE>Webmaster's Guide</CITE>.
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Header_17" HREF="icsurmst.html#ToC_17">Adding a search facility to your Web site</A></H2>
<P>
The Internet Connection Secure Server includes the NetQuestion search facility in a package that
you can install separately.
NetQuestion enables
you to build and maintain searchable indexes to the information on
your Web site.  NetQuestion includes a search engine, a command
interface, and HTML forms that aid Web site navigation and
administration.
<P>
For more information, see the documentation that comes with
the NetQuestion package.
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Header_18" HREF="icsurmst.html#ToC_18">Using proxy authentication</A></H2>
The server distinguishes
between authorized user IDs and passwords that are used
by the end-point server and the proxy server.  This allows
you to require authentication for proxy requests.
<P>For more information, see the <CITE>Webmaster's Guide</CITE>.
