1974 RX-4 <A HREF = "#Wagon">Wagon</A>

<P> The powerful 13B engine made its debut in 1974 with the advent of
the RX-4 and broadened its availability when it appeared in the RX-5
Cosmo in 1976.  That year ports were shrunk for better fuel economy.
When both lines were discontinued in 1978, the engine went into
hibernation until 1984 when it appeared in the RX-7 GSL-SE.

<P> Rotor tips came with cast-iron <A HREF = "seals.html">seals</A>
and the design was changed to two pieces.  There were now only three
side seals (from six).  Engine cooling was improved by increasing
the size of the passages.  Rotor recesses were deepened.

<P> Seats were either vinyl or crushed velour.  The speedometer read up
to 130 mph, the tach up to 8000 rpm.  The dash and the center console
were integrated.

<H2> <A NAME = "Sedan"> RX-4 Sedan </H2>

<P> The bumpers on the sedan and wagon had full length barrier strips,
unlike the coupe.  The sedan was overdecorated compared to the coupe and
wagon since it had an odd adornment of the C pillar (rear pillar).

<H2> <A NAME = "Wagon"> RX-4 Wagon </H2>

<P> Road and Track praised the wagon's power, smoothness, and
responsiveness.  They rated it best of six wagons for "all-around fun".
