SO WHAT'S UP WITH FREE FLIGHT?

       With the conclusion of the RTCA Task Force on free flight,
the publicly visible activity on this fast rising endeavor has
dropped down a couple of notches. Publicly, the industry is awaiting
the formal response of FAA Administrator Hinson to the Task Force
report and recommendations. At a less visible level, there is much
afoot. The outcome of these activities will go far to determine the
eventual success or failure of the free flight effort, as well as
identify who will emerge as the key players in the ongoing
evolution of our airspace system.
       There is little doubt among industry observers that the FAA
will roundly endorse the Task Force report. The most likely scenario
is some sort of public meeting, probably in the DC area, within the
next 3-4 weeks, at which FAA will endorse the report, outline how
it intends to move on the report recommendations, and introduce to
industry the members and structure of the key Free Flight Steering
Committee, which has quietly been organized over the past 4 weeks.
       This Steering Committee of high ranking and prestigious
individuals from the aviation community will exist and operate under
the auspices of RTCA. It will provide the forum for the much needed
industry/government collaboration in carrying out the evolving
requirements of the emerging CNS/ATM system. It will be led by two
co-chairs, one from industry and one from government, both high
ranking individuals who have the position and the power to help
ensure that the Steering Committee's actions are taken seriously in
both camps and are carried out expeditiously.
       On the industry side, the notion and even the phrase free
flight have taken hold more quickly than anyone could have
anticipated. It is almost impossible to read any industry trade
publication without seeing these magic words. Daily mention in
company press releases is common.
       Special free flight marketing packages abound. I just received
one of the most clever mailings from one of the giant avionics
manufacturers, in a large box, delivered by express mail, which
included a "free flight" frisbee, a well-written pamphlet on the
background and concept of free flight, and a second booklet mapping
the products and services of the company to the requirements of
free flight in a CNS/ATM environment.
       Companies are jockeying for position, each trying to present
itself as an organization that can contribute successfully to the
evolution of the airspace system, in accordance with the free flight
concept. The MITRE Corporation recently held the first of an
intended series of invitation-only meetings that deal with specific
free flight issues and the technologies that will support them.
       Interesting and valuable forums for moving the concept
forward, these meetings are also clearly intended to ensure MITRE
carves out a key position in this rapidly changing industry. Other
companies are striving for the same end, many forming "strategic
partnerships" that combine key business and technology talents and
experience, and better position the resulting entity to win a large
share of the developing CNS/ATM market.
       On the government side, work is rapidly progressing on the
documenting of the official FAA architecture of the national
airspace system. It is certain that the Task Force report is being
used as a key input to this process. The first cut at this
architecture document is due out next month.
       Although we have no formal FAA response to the free flight
report, this has been a busy and interesting two months. The
intensity of activity can only increase once the FAA goes public
with its endorsement.

FAA REPORTS FURTHER PROGRESS ON DGPS PSEUDOLITE APPROACH NAVIGATION

       FAA recently reported the successful conclusion of a second
round of feasibility testing on local area DGPS with pseudolite (PL)
augmentation for approach navigation. The FAA Technical Center and
Stanford Telecommunications (STel) have been investigating the
feasibility of using PLs to improve DGPS system availability and
continuity of function. STel has a contract to develop a code-based
DGPS nav system that uses PLs both as a data link and as a ranging
source. Actual flight tests were completed in November.
       By using PLs as ranging sources, the number of GPS satellites
needed to meet RNP standards is decreased, thereby increasing system
availability. It is expected that the PL will also increase system
accuracy. In the flight tests, differential corrections were
transmitted via the PLs to the aircraft in a WAAS-compatible format
at 250 baud. The tests were conducted in ILS look-alike approaches
of 3 degrees from 12 nmi out. The Center's Convair 580 was used for
all flight testing.
       Due to a software glitch, the tests were unable to validate
the expected improvements in system accuracy. Use of the PL as a
data link transmitter was successful. The PL used the same antenna
system as is used to receive signals from the GPS constellation, PL
transmissions did not interfere with the signals from GPS
satellites, and the transmitted corrections were sufficient to
enable the GPS receivers to calculate a real-time differential
solution.
       The LAAS program office is reportedly considering funding a
second phase of such tests to further explore the possible and
potential roles that PLs might play as a component of the LAAS
architecture.

PETAL PROGRAM CONTINUES IN EUROPE

       Since last May, Eurocontrol and Aerospatiale have been
conducting "real world" trials of data link on Airbus aircraft
transiting Maastricht airspace. The Preliminary Eurocontrol Test of
Air/ground data Link (PETAL) aims to capture first hand operational
requirements feed-back and increase operational awareness of the
potential value of data link in an ATC environment.
       The aircraft being used are all Airbus aircraft being ferried
from the Toulouse, France, assembly plant to the DASA plant in
Hamburg, Germany. Each aircraft is equipped with an FMS, ACARS MU,
VHF3 radio, and a specially configured ACARS MCDU. Controllers use a
touch panel input device and electronic data display for message
input and display. Data link messages are transmitted over the SITA
network using AEEC, SITATEX, and AIRCOM compliant message formats.
       PETAL allows aircrews and controllers to carry out ATC comms
by air/ground data link daily. Specific exchanges include: ATC
requests, clearances, and acknowledgments for flight levels and
direct routing; ATC instructions and acknowledgments for voice
frequency management; manual downlink of aircrew preferences such as
top-of-descent and flight levels; and automatic, periodic downlink
of airborne data such as winds.

STUDY: FAA SHOULD REPLACE ATC CENTER POWER SYSTEMS QUICKLY

       A team of electric power experts says the FAA should continue
to replace the power systems at the nation's 21 Air Route Traffic
Control Centers (ARTCCs), but warns that the transition to the new
systems ought to be made as quickly as possible.
       "The existing systems are sufficiently reliable to be used
until transition is complete, assuming that the FAA keeps to the
planned two-year schedule," writes the Blue Ribbon Power Outage Team
in a report released Jan. 19. "The old systems are deteriorating,
though, and it is imperative that replacements be installed as soon
as is feasible."
       The $350-million program to replace ARTCC Critical/Essential
Power Systems (ACEPS) is under way and scheduled for completion next
year.
       In the meantime, the panel, formed last year, had almost 50
recommendations, including:
       *  Enhance training of power-system technicians;
       *  Improve training on the transition to ACEPS equipment, and
increase communication among centers; and
       *  Review the management of critical and essential power
systems.
       The FAA says the recommendations either have been implemented
or are being examined.

  ...FAA Needs Money to Train ATC Technicians

       Until new computer hardware and software arrives at the
nation's ARTCCs [see chart at right], FAA technicians will have to
make do with what's there. But the FAA doesn't have enough money to
train the technicians: the agency requested $30 million for training
this fiscal year but got only $23 million.
       "My highest priority is to find the money for this training,"
said Monte Belger, FAA Associate Administrator for Air Traffic
Services.
       Developing a training plan is one of more than four dozen
steps the FAA says it is taking to minimize the problems caused by
the aging computer equipment at the ARTCCs. Some of the equipment
is decades old, and breakdowns last year delayed thousands of
travelers, and focused media and congressional pressure on the FAA.
       In the second of two reports released Jan. 19, the agency
outlined steps it is taking to reduce the effects of future
breakdowns.
       Among the steps are:
       *  Revamp contingency plans at the 21 centers and test them;
       *  Do a better job of getting input from workers at the
centers about acquisition of new equipment;
       *  Establish a national process for disseminating information
about problems at the centers and lessons learned from the problems.
       Belger said Jan. 19 he didn't yet know how much it will cost
to implement all of the plans.

AIRWAYS OF NEW ZEALAND SELECTS ARINC TO PROVIDE DATA LINK FOR FANS
I

       AIRWAYS Corporation of New Zealand (ACNZ) has selected ARINC
Inc. as its data link service provider for their FANS I
communications service. The contract will facilitate air/ground
communications in the Auckland Flight Information Region (FIR)
during the final phase of ACNZ's upgrade to an automated ATC
system. ARINC has provided internetworking communication services
for the ACNZ Oceanic ATC Automation Workstation since it became
operational in September 1995.
       The ARINC-provided services are scheduled to be operational in
time for the site integration of the new ATC equipment in April.
These include Controller-Pilot Data Link Communications (CPDLC) and
Automatic Dependent Surveillance (ADS), linking air traffic
controllers and flight crews of FANS 1-equipped aircraft.
Participating aircraft must have Boeing's FANS 1 FMS enhancement for
the B747/400 or similar equipment on other aircraft types.
       ARINC provides FANS I services to the FAA Oakland and
Anchorage ARTCCs, which control the Pacific Ocean FIRs. It is also
providing similar services for operational trials of ATC automation
in the Russian Far East.  These on-going trials began in September
1995, when a United flight first used the system to fly from
Chicago to Tokyo.

TRIPLE TRIMBLE GPS UNITS REPLACE INS ON B747 FOR SOLE MEANS
NAVIGATION

       The FAA has granted Canard Aerospace an STC for a triple
installation of the Trimble 8100 GPS navigation system on an
Evergreen International Airline B747-100. This is the first time
that an INS on a B747 has been completely replaced by GPS, which
provides sole means of navigation in revenue service.
       The Trimble-equipped Evergreen B747 flew the first around the
world flight using only GPS for navigation, departing JFK on
December 22 and returning on December 25. "In many of these cases
throughout the world, navigation and communications facilities fall
short of modern standards," said Peter Russo, Flight Captain for
Evergreen. "The airlines sees the accuracy of GPS, transportable
anywhere on the globe, as a big investment in flight safety, which
will yield both economic and performance quality dividends for
decades to come."
       Commenting on the specific operational benefits of GPS, Russo
added, the new GPS equipment "improves navigational accuracy and
thus reduces the cost of freight transportation for our customers.
Secondly, GPS allows Evergreen to participate in advanced oceanic
navigation routes requiring high precision to sequence aircraft more
efficiently. Lastly, the cost of GPS will be immediately recouped by
the avoidance of INS repair and replacement costs."

NEW SKYBLAZER XL GPS NAVIGATOR OFFERED BY MAGELLAN

       Magellan has upgraded its SkyBlazer line by increasing the
number of pixels in its new XL GPS Navigator to more than 20,000,
providing ultra-high resolution for its moving map display. This
gives pilots a more detailed, sharper picture of where they are and
where they're going, according to Marc Henegar, Marketing and Sales
Manager of Magellan's Aviation Products Marketing group. "With finer
detail, screen clutter is significantly reduced and the image is
crystal clear, which greatly benefits the pilot's situational
awareness."
       The unit will also display the location of all airports with
1,500 ft or longer runways, nav aids, intersections, special use
airspace, user waypoints, airport diagrams, airspace boundaries,
track history and courseline, and a Track Situation Indicator, which
combines a CDI and glideslope to facilitate en route and vertical
navigation. The moving map scale can be adjusted to allow scanning
of the map ahead, behind, or to the left or right of current
position. The unit includes a PC-updatable Jeppesen database of
North and Central America.
       The SkyBlazer XL measures 6.1"x3.5"x1.3", weighs 14 ounces,
and is powered by three AA batteries. It lists for $699.

COLLINS ANNOUNCES NEW FAMILY OF FLAT PANEL DISPLAYS

       Collins has launched a program to provide a family of state-
of-the-art liquid crystal displays for retrofit on existing airline
fleets. Designated the 5ATI display, the unit will replace existing
FD-108, FD-109, and FD-110 electro-mechanical instruments. Collins
claims the new unit will also provide the additional functionality
needed by airlines for operation in the evolving CNS/ATM
environment.
       "To meet this requirement we've developed a family of 'drop-
in' products designed to meet multiple market requirements and
retrofit applications," according to Clay Jones, VP and GM of the
Collins Air Transport Division.  The 5ATI retrofit family will be
TSOd in about August 1996, per Collins, and will provide format
flexibility to permit easy transition for flight crews, with minimal
training needed to master the added functionality selected by the
airlines.
       Based on experience and technology from the B777 program,
Collins has developed the 5ATI display. It has a larger active area
than current displays, 4.2" x 4.2", and uses a proprietary
technology that enables viewing angles of up to +/-60 degrees. It
has a nominal MTBF of 12,000, roughly four times greater than
today's electro-mechanical instruments. Acquisition cost is
estimated by Collins to be about 50% of that of current displays.
The unit is capable of future expansion to include weather radar,
TCAS, and GPS navigation.

FAA SEEKS INFORMATION ON REPLACEMENT AIR-GROUND RADIO FOR FUTURE
ACQUISITION

       The FAA has sent out a request for information in support of
a new program, the Next Generation Air/Ground Communications
(Nex_Gen_A/G) program, to replace the air-to-ground system currently
used for voice communications between pilots and air traffic
controllers. FAA hopes to learn of the existence of a system that
is off-the-shelf and based on existing technology, rather than be
forced to develop a system to meet its specific needs. This RFI is
part of a market survey to determine what products and technologies
are currently available, what developmental activities are under
way, and what products/technologies are expected to be available
within the next five years.
       The system FAA seeks must be capable of:
       *  ensuring that available RF spectrum can be used efficiently
for voice and data requirements;
       *  reducing susceptibility to RFI;
       *  improving communications system security;
       *  supporting remote maintenance monitoring; and
       *  providing consistent voice quality over a range of
operating conditions.
       The new system is expected to incorporate a multi-mode VHF
radio using digital modulation and TDMA to provide a flexible mix
of 25 kHz-separated voice and data channels. It should also be
backwards compatible with existing AM radios. Interested parties
should contact Mr. Ed Cornell, Product Engineer, at 202-358-5206,
before January 31, 1996.

ASM MAKES ITS MARK IN GPS COMMERCIAL AVIATION INTEGRATION

       In the world of aviation, where profit margins are slim and
retrofitting older aircraft with new equipment can have a healthy
effect on the bottom line, a small Texas company seems to have
found a niche in the business of integrating avionics into jet
aircraft.
       Aircraft Systems & Manufacturing (ASM), based in Georgetown,
Texas, near Austin, is working to develop a standard for the
integration of global positioning system (GPS) equipment and other
avionics into the cockpits of commercial airliners.
       "There are a lot of varying [integration] packages," says ASM
President Dan McKenzie. "We want to come up with a universal design
that [can equip] Airbus, Lockheed, McDonnell Douglas and Boeing
aircraft."
       Founded in 1987, the company now employs 30 people, and has
contracts worldwide. Although it has looked into all kinds of
aircraft, including the business jet and general aviation (GA)
markets, ASM plans to keep integrating GPS systems into the higher-
end commercial aircraft. 
       "We are concentrating on the 15,000 commercial aircraft in the
United States," McKenzie says. "There is a 4-6 percent drop in the
number of aircraft each year due to aircraft age. We are stronger
domestically, so we are going to aggressively target this market."
       Among the company's projects is the updating of the cockpits
of about 140 Northwest Airlines DC-9s. Just last week, the company
got FAA supplemental type certification to integrate Honeywell-
Trimble's HT 9000 GPS equipment into 16 Boeing 727s owned by Guam-
based Continental Micronesia.
       Although ASM is concentrating on U.S. commercial aviation
markets, the world beckons. For example, a meeting late last year
between Federal Aviation Administration officials and members of the
Gulf Cooperation Council met to discuss GPS use in the Persian Gulf
region could spur GPS integration activities there. The company
recently installed a satcom system on a Boeing 747 belonging to a
Gulf nation head of state, says Marnie Sablan, ASM's corporate
communications manager.
       The company also plans to market its integration kits to
government agencies, including the military. "We've performed
integration for the U.S. Customs Agency. For us to look at the
military market, we would have to assess their design criteria,"
McKenzie says.
       Although McKenzie admits the company does not offer the lowest
cost GPS integration kit, he says buyers can tell the difference
between ASM's and the other brands. "Some outfits are calling a few
connectors, cables and a tray and are calling it a kit. It's a huge
ambiguity that is reflected in cost," he says. "Sometimes the time
it takes to integrate kits cramps the styles of maintenance
managers. We think we are unique in that we are not reactionary [to
the market]. We have conducted enough research to know that
[aviation managers] do not want to integrate [GPS without]
unnecessary cost."
       McKenzie says aircraft manufacturers' decision-makers must
weigh cost vs. value. "The guy making the decision to buy [GPS
integration kits] has to evaluate the cost and the ability of a
company," he says. "They have to evaluate all of the elements --
the kit, the ability to stick it into any airplane."
       To speed the installation, ASM provides its customers with
three dimensional computer-developed designs. Later this year the
company hopes to begin providing information to customers on-line,
Sablan says. That, she says, would make it easy to provide updates
and changes to integration information.
       A key to the company's GPS integration success, says Leonard
Olson, ASM vice president of operations, is its ability to customize
its kits to an aircraft. That cuts integration time, in some cases
drastically. "Some integration companies take upwards of six months
to [integrate GPS]," Olson says. "We are almost to the point that
we can take any GPS design package and integrate it in a couple of
days."
