<h1>6TH INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON THE MAILLARD REACTION.</h1>

<h2>RELEVANCE TO FOOD, HEALTH AND DISEASE.<br>

ROYAL COLLEGE OF PHYSICIANS, LONDON, UK.<br>
JULY 27-30 1997.</h2>

</ADDRESS>
<p>
The first Maillard Reaction Symposium was held at Uddevalla, Sweden, in 1979. Subsequent meetings were held in Las Vagas, USA, in 1982, Kyoto, Japan, in 1985, Lausanne, Switzerland, in 1989, Minneapolis and St Paul, USA, in 1993. The 6th International Symposium on the Maillard Reaction will take place in London from July 27-30, 1997. The meeting will provide a forum for scientists from different disciplines to discuss the importance of the Maillard reaction in relation to the sensory characteristics of food, food processing and human nutrition, with a special focus on "in vivo" reactions affecting human health and diseases such as diabetes and kidney failure.
<p>
London is one of the world's great capitals with a unique range of venues of outstanding historical, cultural, and recreational interest. Readily accessible through several airports, principally Heathrow and Gatwick, and with excellent public transport and reliable taxis in the central area.<p>

<b>Programme</b>
<BR>
Topics to be covered include:<br>
<ul>
<li>reaction mechanisms<br>
<li>kinetics<br>
<li>technological aspects<br>
