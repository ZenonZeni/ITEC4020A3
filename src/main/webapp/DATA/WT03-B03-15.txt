Toxin law case ends in defeat: Worker pledges to press on with her
three-year battle

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 01

Thaksina Khaikaew and Chakrit Ridmontri

A woman's three-year battle against a former employer she blames for
aluminium poisoning was thrown out by the Central Labour Court yesterday.

The verdict ended a case that symbolised a fight for justice by an
ordinary worker against a multi-national with government backing.

In 1993, Mayuree Taevivat filed a six-million-baht damages action against
Electro Ceramics (Thailand) Co, a Thai-Japanese venture in Lamphun.

Mrs Mayuree, who started work at the Electro Ceramics plant in the
Lamphun industrial estate, said she had been exposed to aluminium dust
for five years.

Handing down its ruling, the court said Mrs Mayuree had failed to prove
alumina dust was the cause of her illnesses. It ruled the company, which
produces electronic parts and components, was not obliged to compensate
her because it had been entitled to terminate her employment after she
had been absent for more than six months.

Five years after beginning work at the plant, Mrs Mayuree suffered body
pain and headaches. Tests at Chiang Mai's McCormic Hospital established
she had been exposed to chemical poisoning.

Some 13 workers have died of suspected chemical poisoning in Lamphun but
the Industrial Estate Authority of Thailand contends they died of Aids.

After the verdict, a tearful Mrs Mayuree said she would appeal. Mr
Praphan, her husband, said the family had accumulated more than 300,000
baht in medical bills.

He said his family was waging a lone battle against a big corporation.
None of their neighbours, who work at the estate, dared lend them support
for fear of losing their jobs.

The authority is cooperating with the SSPA Maritime Consulting Co of
Sweden on an environmental risk assessment in electronics plants at the
Lamphun estate.

The study, funded by Sweden's International Development Cooperation
Agency, aims to identify the risks so appropriate safety measures can be
introduced. Factories will assist the study.

Ingemar Palsson, of SSPA, said the assessment is focusing on factors that
may have adverse effects on workers. After the assessment, he said,
safety measures would be introduced.

Mr Palsson said safety measures must comply with legal standards and must
be acceptable to the workforce.

Environmental risks in the electronics industry mostly concern solder and
cleaning work. Soldering, which involves melting lead to connect
electronic components on circuit boards, produces toxic fumes that are
extremely hazardous to health. Cleaning involves solvents that are also
toxic.

Kasemsri Homchean, director of the authority's Environment and Safety
Control Division, confirmed that the assessments would be carried out
soon but said it was up to factories to decide if they were to adopt
prescribed measures.

Factories that adopt the recommendations would manage their own
environmental management performance, he said. It could be a stepping
stone towards environmental management under ISO 14000, he added.

Help sought in condo scam

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 01

Over a hundred people in Pathum Thani are in debt to Siam City Bank for
failing to make mortgage payments for condominium units they did not buy.

They sought help yesterday from the Office of Civil Rights Protection and
Legal Aid.

One of them, Arunee Vijitkraisri, 55, said the bank is demanding that she
repay a loan plus 19% annual interest, adding up to 476,107 baht.

Otherwise it will ask the court to confiscate the unit she is alleged to
have bought at Maitreekij Estate Co's MT Condominium in Thanyaburi.

But Mrs Arunee said she did not buy the condo or apply for a mortgage
from the bank.

She said she had been told by a broker, Somchai Kulhiransawat, that she
would be paid 2,000 baht by Maitreekij Estate Co for helping to reserve
a unit of its project.

As her husband makes only 4,500 baht a month to feed six mouths, Mrs
Arunee said she and her four children agreed.

Her family and neighbours went with Mr Somchai to Thanyaburi Land Office.

Officials there asked her to sign some documents. Mrs Arunee, who is
illiterate, said she did not know what the documents were about.

She was then paid 2,000 baht. Her four children also reserved four units
and were also paid 2,000 baht each.

Prosecutor Yuenyad Jaisamut said the people, most of them low-income
workers, demanded about 500,000 baht each from the bank in suits filed
with South Bangkok Civil Court and Thanyaburi Court.

Mr Yuenyad alleged the condo project owner conspired with bank officials
to cheat the people and could be charged with fraud.

The penalty for fraud is not more than five years in prison or a fine not
exceeding 10,000 baht or both.

Mr Somchai, the broker, was among the victims filing complaints with Mr
Yuenyad yesterday.

Mr Yuenyad said he had ordered the agency's lawyers to investigate and
gather evidence.

The agency provides assistance free of charge, but the people must pay
a 1,000 baht court fee by themselves.

He called on the Government to help pay the fees for these poor people.

British royals warmly greeted: Second time here by UK queen since 1972

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 01

Anjira Assavanonda and Varalee Sinlarat

Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II renewed her acquaintance with Thailand for
the first time in 24 years yesterday.

The British monarch and the Duke of Edinburgh, her consort, who are on
a five-day state visit, were greeted at Don Muang airport by Their
Majesties the King and Queen.

Hundreds of people, Thais and foreigners, watched the greeting before the
King and Queen accompanied their royal guests to motorcade.

From the airport, they went to Maha Jesadabodin Pavilion, where city
officials were in attendance. Thousands of people lined Rajdamnern Avenue
waving the tri-coloured Union Jack and Thai flags.

Silence descended moments before the motorcade arrived at 3.40 p.m.

Queen Elizabeth, in an emerald green dress and hat, stepped out of the
car, drawing expressions of delight and excitement from the crowd.

Chariya Rattakul, wife of Bangkok Governor Bhichit, and Sunantha
Samalapa, wife of City Clerk Prasert, presented garlands to Queen
Elizabeth, Queen Sirikit and Prince Philip.

On behalf of Bangkok, Governor Bhichit welcomed the monarch and presented
her with a key to the city.

The key is gold-plated, eight inches in length engraved with the emblem
of the city showing Indra, keeper of Amarawadi heaven, atop Erawan, the
white elephant.

In response, Queen Elizabeth thanked the people of Bangkok and expressed
pleasure at a welcome that was as friendly as in 1972.

She said she arrived in Bangkok then by river, but this time she entered
the city from the newly-expanded airport. From the short drive, the UK
Queen said Bangkok had changed almost beyond recognition.

She said she was glad the city, despite modernisation, had retained its
rich cultural heritage which would be enjoyed not only by Thais but by
an increasing number of overseas visitors, including Britons.

"I am sure the citizens of Bangkok, in facing up to the demands of modern
living, have lost none of their warmth and humour," she said.

The Queen told Mr Bhichit he had been elected governor of one of the
great cities of Asia and had accepted a responsibility both exciting and
rewarding.

She also wished the governor and the people success in continuing to make
Bangkok a thriving and happy place in which to live in years ahead.

After the ceremony, the King and the Queen accompanied Queen Elizabeth
and Prince Philip to Boromabhiman Mansion, where they will stay.

Most people in the crowd expressed delight for a chance to welcome the
royal visitors even though many of them did not have a clear view.

Porntip Pimcharoen, 57, and her daughter, from Min Buri, had arrived at
Rajdamnern at 5 a.m but missed seeing the Queen because she left her spot
for a few moments just as the motorcade arrived.

She said, however, she was glad to be there. "As a Bangkok citizen, I'm
glad she has come here. It will be a long, long time before she comes
here again. I keep reading about her in the newspapers every day."

Having missed her chance, Mrs Porntip said she would try again.

At Boromabhiman Mansion, Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip gave an
audience to Thai and foreign journalists. As the gathering was a social
event, press coverage was not allowed at the request of Buckingham
Palace.

The royal visitors have a busy itinerary. Today's engagements include a
visit to Ayutthaya where they will view ancient temples, floating
lanterns on the Chao Phraya, a light and sound display at the old capital
and a private dinner with the King and Queen.

Scholarship was watershed in boy's life

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 01

When Queen Elizabeth was taken to Bhumibol Dam on her last visit 24 years
ago, she said she wanted to support the education of some hilltribe
students.

Lee Suk, then 17, said to be the brightest of the H'mong students, was
selected and told Queen Elizabeth he wanted to become a doctor.

He was granted a queen's scholarship for five years, which enabled him
to complete MS5 secondary education, but he did not make it to medical
college.

He said he tried to do too much and his marks fell short of the minimum
requirement for medical college. Instead, he entered the agriculture
college at Chiang Mai University, which was a blessing in disguise.

After MS5, Lee Suk was on his own, but reluctant to give up education,
he borrowed money for university fees and books. He brought his problem
to the attention of representatives of His Majesty the King's hilltribe
programme. As a result, he was granted scholarships from the government
and Australia, which enabled him to finish his BA in agriculture in
Chiang Mai.

Three years ago, he took leave to study for a master's in agricultural
promotion in Chiang Mai, and in January, he graduated.

Born in Pa Wai, Nakhon Thai, Phitsanulok, Lee Suk's childhood was spent
fighting malaria and poverty. He barely knew Thai until 11 when a group
of volunteer teachers set up a school for H'mong children in his remote
village. It was the first time he had learned the Thai language.

Lee Suk excelled over his peers. He picked up the language faster and was
praised by all the teachers. But his studies came to an abrupt end when
communist insurgents raided the village and shot dead the headmen.

His parents and their nine children fled to a temple in Nakhon Thai town
where they took refuge for three months before they settled in Tak, where
Lee Suk resumed his studies at a state school.

Today, Lee Suk, or Lee Suk Rithnettikul, as he is known to his
colleagues, works at the Hilltribe Development and Welfare Centre in
Chiang Mai, where he is using his knowledge for his people.

Lee Suk counts himself as lucky to have been granted the scholarship from
Queen Elizabeth, which was a turning point in his life. Many other H'mong
children wanted to study but were not as lucky.

Plaintiff's lawyer can talk to media

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 01

The South Bangkok Criminal Court has ruled that the lawyer of a Khon Kaen
businessman, who brought a 695.62 million baht lawsuit against Samitivej
Hospital in the death of his pregnant wife, can speak to the media.

In its ruling last Friday the court said the lawyer has the
constitutional right to speak to the media and his action would not be
interpreted as contempt of court.

The court also set December 16 for the first examination of the
plaintiff's witnesses after the two sides failed to reach an out-of-court
settlement.

In the lawsuit filed April 30, Burin Seriyothin said his wife, Jureerat,
died on September 6 last year after being left unattended in the delivery
room.

Mrs Jureerat died of suffocation after being given an injection. No
doctor was present to help her.

Mr Burin claimed that his wife, who was manager of Khon Kaen Hae Uan Co
at the time of her death, had an annual income of 25 million baht.

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 01

Chiang Mai

Five Israelis were seriously injured in a cable car accident at Wat
Phrathat Doi Suthep yesterday.

A car carrying 20 tourists derailed and crashed after the cable snapped
halfway up Doi Suthep at 3 p.m. yesterday.

The Israelis, whose names were not released, suffered serious injuries,
including broken legs.

Temple worker Phrommin Doatraphan said the car derailed because it was
full while another on the way down was empty.

The service has been halted pending investigations in which police are
looking for evidence of negligence.

Samak fumes over defeat in latest poll: Clean sweep for the Democrats
predicted

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 03

Prachakorn Thai leader Samak Sundaravej was enraged by the latest
Matichon opinion poll which says he will lose the November 17 general
election.

The poll predicts a clean sweep for the Democrats in all but two Bangkok
constituencies -- 7 and 12 -- which are Palang Dharma's and Prachakorn
Thai's respective strongholds.

The poll was conducted on 2,550 people in the 13 constituencies of
Bangkok on Saturday. Between 146-205 respondents were selected at random
from each constituency.

Mr Samak questioned the reliability of the poll, saying its results were
misleading since the number of respondents was too small to represent
Bangkok's entire population.

He also doubted all the respondents were eligible voters.

The survey predicts a clean sweep by Democrats Vinai Sompong, Thawatchai
Satchakul and Gen Panlop Pinmanee in the three-seat Constituency 1, with
Mr Samak coming in fourth.

Mr Samak blasted the poll, saying it was aimed at classifying political
parties into good and bad ones in a misleading way.

"Let me ask you this. Will the (pollsters' relatives) at home die or get
sick all of a sudden, or will their office buildings collapse if they go
without the poll?" he said.

The Interior Ministry has instructed its officials to stay neutral in the
lead-up to the election to ensure a fair and clean poll.

Speaking to a meeting of some 966 district chiefs and provincial police
chiefs yesterday, Deputy Interior Minister Arsa Meksawan warned them not
to side with any candidates.

"Some officials have close ties with local politicians who may ask them
to do something to boost their chances of getting elected. As state
officials, we have to ensure fair and clean elections. Don't let
unscrupulous people order you to do something that violates the law," Mr
Arsa said.

The ministry's permanent secretary, Chuwong Chayabutr, who was also
present at the meeting, asked district authorities to warn local
community leaders against helping canvass votes for candidates.

"Every election season, there are complaints that kamnan and phuyaiban
(tambon and village heads) serve as canvassers for some candidates.
Therefore, it is the task of the district chief to warn local leaders in
his or her area of jurisdiction not to become a tool of politicians," Mr
Aree said.

Three-party coalition seen

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 03

Phetchabun

There is a distinct possibility of Democrat, Chart Pattana and Chart Thai
parties forming the next coalition government, former House Speaker Panja
Kaesornthong said yesterday.

Mr Panja, who recently quit Chart Pattana and will contest next month's
election on the Chart Thai ticket, said his party could play a crucial
role in the formation of the new government.

He said Chart Thai leader Banharn Silpa-archa was not angry with the
Democrats, who questioned his nationality and academic qualification
during the censure debate, for deep inside he understands that they were
only performing their duty as an opposition party.

Mr Banharn would not accept any cabinet posts if his party was invited
to join the new coalition, said the veteran politician and former
Phetchabun MP.

In a way the mass defection of former MPs did the party a world of good,
Mr Panja said, because Chart Thai was now left with only quality members.

Mr Panja, who once left Chart Thai to help Gen Chatichai Choonhavan form
Chart Pattana Party, said he returned to Chart Thai because Mr Banharn
wanted him to help salvage the party.

Party policies on army TV

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 03

The army is to air a programme for parties to explain their policies.

"Last Lap of Election '96" will be televised live on Channel 5 on
November 6 from 8.15 p.m. to 11.15 p.m. from Kittikachorn Hall at army
headquarters.

Lt-Gen Jaturit Phromsakha na Sakon Nakhon, assistant chief-of-staff for
civilian affairs, said parties will use the first segment to outline
policies, after which the audience, mostly military personnel, will raise
questions that have been screened.

"The army will not allow politicians to attack one other. They can only
present their views and visions," Lt-Gen Jaturit said.

Leaders or representatives of 13 parties in the poll will be invited to
the office of the army secretary tomorrow to discuss the programme.

If the programme is too short for all parties to make their policies
known, the army may consider another programme on November 8.

MP accused of forging document: Used against PM at no-confidence debate

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 03

Democrat Chamni Sakdiset was yesterday accused of falsifying an alien
registration paper which he used to attack Prime Minister Banharn
Silpa-archa in last month's no-confidence debate.

The accusation was made by a complaint filed with the Crime Suppression
Division by Somsak Phakhipho, a 58-year-old lawyer.

The lawyer said the copy of an alien registration paper produced by Mr
Chamni during the September 18 censure debate and which the Democrat
claimed to have been issued to Sengkim sae Bay, Mr Banharn's father,
showed that Mr Sengkim arrived in Thailand in B.E. 2480 (1937), while the
genuine document showed the year of his arrival to be 2450 (1907).

Mr Chamni, meanwhile, said in Nakhon Si Thammarat yesterday that doubts
over the legality of Mr Banharn's Thai nationality raised by him during
the September 18 censure debate have been distorted and used by three
political parties with support bases in Bangkok to attack the Democrats
in a bid to maintain their popularity.

He said what he raised during the debate was the suspicion that Mr
Banharn might have obtained his Thai nationality illegally, basing his
arguments on the alien registration paper issued to the premier's father.

However, he said, the Prachakorn Thai, Muan Chon and Palang Dharma
parties have twisted the real issue to accuse the Democrats of racial
discrimination.

Mr Chamni said before the debate he had tried to verify the document with
the police but they refused to cooperate.

The Democrat said he was responsible for what he had done and would not
mind if Muan Chon leader Chalerm Yubamrung filed a complaint with the
police over this matter.

"Pol Capt Chalerm himself should not have stayed on as caretaker justice
minister because he was one of those who had betrayed Mr Banharn by
forcing him to resign after the censure debate," Mr Chamni said.

Democrats go for Islamic votes: Pledge to open a new world for Muslims

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 03

Somchai Meesane

The Democrats are going high-tech to win the hearts of Muslim voters in
the four southernmost provinces of Pattani, Yala, Narathiwat and Satun.

Campaign director Surin Pitsuwan said yesterday a party which could "open
a new world" for Muslim communities stands to win.

The Democrats are relying on video multivision and the print media as
their main weapons in the battle for votes in the four Muslim-dominated
provinces.

Mr Surin used video multivisions in the Yawi and Malay languages for the
first time during his campaign in Pattani's Yaring district on Sunday.
The new technology was warmly welcomed there.

The former deputy foreign minister said the battle between the Democrats
and New Aspiration in the South has boiled down to a race to build up "a
new process of learning" for Muslim communities.

The old strategy of the Wadah Group headed by New Aspiration's Wan
Muhamad Nor Matha, which demands that Muslim people look up to their
religious leaders as the only channel for news and information will not
work this time, Mr Surin said.

The Democrats lost in the past because it had no chance to clear
themselves of accusations made by the Wadah Group, then led by Den
Tohmeena, which rejected learning through reading, listening and
watching, said the former Nakhon Si Thammarat MP.

Mr Surin said attempts by his party to bring "a new way of learning" to
the Muslims in the South through its campaigns helped it win in the four
southernmost provinces in the last election on July 2, 1995.

He said if the Democrats could instill the habit of learning through
reading, watching and listening in them, he believes Muslims all over the
country will vote for the party.

The four provinces were the strongholds of New Aspiration for about a
decade until the July 2 election when the Democrats managed to snatch
eight seats from New Aspiration, which could hold on to only five.

This time it's going to be a fierce contest again between the two parties
vying for the 13 seats at stake -- four each in Pattani and Narathiwat,
three in Yala and two in Satun.

The Democrats aim to capture 12 seats this time, leaving only one seat
in Yala to deputy New Aspiration leader Wan Muhamad Nor Matha.

New Aspiration, meanwhile, hopes to not only keep its five seats but also
to win three more from Den Tohmeena in Pattani's Constituency 1, Parinya
Jetapivat in Narathiwat's Constituency 2 and Horsaree Mahrem in Satun.

That means Mr Den, a veteran Pattani MP, has to beat Democrat Mareepeng
Pajakiya, while Mr Parinya and Mr Horsaree must defeat Ramree Mama and
Thanin Jaisamut, respectively.

Muslims, who form 70 percent of the total population of the four
southernmost provinces, are therefore the deciding factor.

Apart from video multivisions, Mr Surin will also issue a party journal
featuring Democrat achievements in the South under the theme "Recovering
the Thai Economy and Building the Darussalam (land of peace)."

The journal covers Democrat policies on Muslim communities, the Growth
Triangle, promotion of hadji affairs, Malay language studies.

Some 200,000 copied will be distributed to Muslims all over the country.

The wind of change has been so strong Mr Wan Nor, who now leads the Wadah
Group, admitted he could no longer rely on Muslim religious leaders to
help canvass votes for New Aspiration.

Mr Wan Nor has ordered former Mass Communications Organisation of
Thailand director Rachan Husen to prepare multivision media for the
party's election campaign.

He will also issue leaflets in Thai and Yawi to publicise the Wadah
Group's work in the South.

The group has also stepped up its campaign among young eligible voters
-- those between 18-20 years old -- by promoting sport competitions and
recruiting them to help with the party's work.

Mr Surin claimed young voters who were against the "old process of
learning" were a major force behind the defeat of the Wadah Group in the
last election.

There are about 20,000 young eligible voters in each of the four
southernmost provinces.

Mr Wan Nor admitted the "Chuan Fever" is very strong in the South and
that New Aspiration leader Chavalit Yongchaiyudh could not match the
Democrat leader in terms of popularity in this region.

The Wadah Group has already dropped the "Chavalit for prime minister"
slogan here and switched to "Southerners for NAP ministers" instead.

PollWatch sets eyes on cash transactions: Big sums changing hands in
provinces

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 03

Wut Nontarit

Khon Kaen

Pollwatch is keeping a close watch on unusual cash transactions in this
province, where there has been an upsurge in demand for 100 and 50-baht
banknotes.

Preeda Thumthiang, chairman of the PollWatch committee in the Northeast,
said many banks in the province came across clients asking to have
millions of baht in cash changed into the 100 and 50-baht notes.

Such practices were rare outside the election period, he said, adding
that a PollWatch investigation had found that people who carry large
amounts of cash work for a big political party with a large support base
in the region.

But so far, no one has been caught violating the election law. PollWatch
will continue to keep an eye on activities that may lead to vote-buying.

Mr Preeda said he expected fierce competition in all four constituencies
of Khon Kaen.

The various parties have begun selecting canvassers to work for them in
the different localities.

The parties have spent a lot of money devising election strategies to be
deployed in rounding up support from potential voters.

He explained that canvassers are usually chosen from respected figures
in the community. They will tour the villages recommending their
candidates to the people.

The local people were told the candidates would fulfil their promises if
they were elected.

The canvassers often threatened to withdraw support for the villagers if
they did not vote for their candidates. "Now is just about the time to
find the canvassers," said Mr Preecha.

He said PollWatch volunteers would closely monitor the canvassers' moves.
Legal action would be taken against them immediately if there was
evidence to suggest they had committed wrongdoing.

Mr Preeda opposed New Aspiration's bid to woo local voters by supporting
its leader as prime minister for the Northeastern people, saying this
would only divide people of the different regions.

He said the party's effort to draw votes from the teachers may eventually
prove futile because election victory depended on many other factors.
Vote-buying, for example, looked likely to change the voting pattern.

Starting from November 5, PollWatch would despatch its officials to
educate locals about democracy and the adverse effects of vote-buying.
The campaign is expected to be joined by more than 120,000 residents.

Vote-buying is likely to be particularly heavy during the week preceding
the election.

So far, PollWatch has received reports that some parties have distributed
coupons which can be redeemed for cash to attract people to their
campaign rallies. The coupons have a value of between 20 and 50 baht.

Sukit Wattanasuk, head of Khon Kane's PollWatch Development Office, said
about 1,300 volunteers, mostly Khon Kane University students, were sent
to monitor the pre-election situation in the villages.

PollWatch has also asked the provincial governor that its officials be
allowed to man election units on election day so as to prevent
malpractice.

He said it was found the voters were handed ballot papers which had
already been marked, adding that vote-buyers and officials often worked
as a team.

Election snippets: Party canvassers use lotto-strategy

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 03

The competitive atmosphere in Phuket is heating up, with many canvassers
using a new strategy to seek votes for some candidates by selling
underground lottery tickets to local people.

Some candidates' supporters reportedly sell the so-called "MP lotteries"
to people in Phuket for ten baht each and promise to pay 1,000-5,000 baht
to those buying lottos with the name of the winner.

Many villagers have complained to to Phuket PollWatch chairman Kittipong
Thieng Khunatham, requesting that the agency take action.

Two-time Democrat MP for Phuket Anchalee Vanich Thepbutr and New
Aspiration candidate Revuth Chindapol are fighting a political battle to
capture the single seat in this southern province.

Police officers in the North will face immediate reshuffle if they
support certain political parties, according to the head of Police
Regional Bureau 5, Pol Lt-Gen Prasarn Wongyai.

Pol Lt-Gen Prasarn said he had authorised every provincial police chief
in the North to transfer every officer acting against election laws out
of the area urgently.

"Policemen of every level will be transferred to other remote areas to
prevent more malpractice if they use their authority to benefit some
parties or candidates. I myself will be ready to face the same penalty
if found guilty of any allegations," he said.

Police under the Regional Bureau 5 have also been ordered to ensure
safety for every candidate and canvasser, and keep a close watch on
gunmen who may cause trouble at the election.

A Palang Dharma candidate contesting the poll in Samut Prakan's
Constituency 1 has asked for more PollWatch officials to ensure a fair
election.

Dr Wallop Youngtrong said Constituency 1 was notorious for rigging. He
cited the January 8 election last year when hundreds of voters turned up
but could not cast their ballots because others had already voted for
them.

Several election officials were arrested and charged in court but were
eventually acquitted, said the PDP candidate who expressed concern that
vote-rigging was likely to be repeated here.

He said a shortage of PollWatch officials to man election booths could
cause problems. Worse still, he said some parties had refused to send
their representatives to monitor the ballot casting.

Planned port site a threat to sea-turtles: Pollution would limit chances of
survival

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 04

Kanittha Inchukul

A proposed site for a deep-sea port under the Southern Seaboard
Development Project in Phang-nga is a potential threat to the habitat of
endangered sea turtles.

Its proposed location at Ban Thap Lamu in Thai Muang district, about 20
kilometres north of Khao Lampee-Had Thai Muang Marine National Park, is
a well-known breeding-ground for sea turtles in the Andaman Sea.

The Southern Seaboard Committee chaired by Prime Minister Banharn
Silpa-archa approved the idea last week and is to submit the proposal for
cabinet approval next week.

A recent report on a study by Ecolas, a Belgian consultancy, notes that
oil pollution from the deep-sea port and its activities coupled with
changes in coastal morphology would certainly threaten the survival of
this endangered species.

However, it said that the environmental impact would be lower than that
expected at the original site in Krabi. Based on this assessment, the
Southern Seaboard Committee decided to relocate the port to Phangnga.

Environmental officials agree that any negative impact on the sea turtle
population, if it occurs, would likely occur as a result of many
different activities at the port both during and after its construction,
especially oil spills from large tankers.

The high frequency of transportation would possibly disturb the migratory
route of the sea turtles heading to nest at the peaceful Thai Muang beach
in the national park.

Ecolas suggested that the Phra Thong Island in Ranong province could be
created into a new nesting ground for the migrating sea turtles. However,
environmental officials argued that turtles always lay their eggs on the
same grounds where they are born.

An average of 77 nests with 100 eggs of leatherback and olive ridley
turtles can be found on the current nesting ground each year but the
number is said to be declining, according to the record books of the
Phuket Marine Biological Centre.

Four different species of sea turtles found in Thai waters, apart from
eight other species found worldwide, include the green, hawkbill, olive
ridley and leatherback. The leatherback is found in the Andaman Sea but
not in the Gulf of Thailand.

Suraphol Sudara, a marine biologist from Chulalongkorn University is
disappointed with the decision. He said the Southern Seaboard Committee
has ignored the proposal to study other sites proposed by the Science,
Technology and Environment Ministry.

The ministry favours the site between Trang on the Andaman coast and
Songkhla or Pattani provinces on the east coast because the project will
not have a serious impact on the environment.

He said an impact assessment study carried out by Ecolas concentrates
only on the planned construction of the sea port in Phangnga.

Flags to be posted beside roads in 'dust-free zones': Trucks entering the
zones must cover up

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 04

Poona Antaseeda

Signboards and flags are to be posted along roads designated "dust-free
zones", a senior city official said yesterday. Deputy City Clerk
Kriangsak Lohachala said the move is an attempt to inform motorists of
the programme beguan in August with Sathorn as the first dust-free road.

A month later, each of 40 districts had designated at least one road as
part of the programme.

Trucks entering dust-free roads are required to cover what they are
transporting if it is construction materials or materials that may litter
the roads. Their wheels and bodies must be free of dirt.

Mr Kriangsak said the city's attempt to install the signs came after it
received complaints from people who said they had no way of knowing which
road has been designated dust-free.

It was one of the reasons why motorists unintentionally broke the rules,
he said.

He said the project had so far proved successful, although truck drivers
spurning the rules were still to be found.

Some drivers avoided police checkpoints by using other roads because they
knew the time and place where police usually set up their checkpoints,
Mr Kriangsak said.

The authorities have since suggested to the police that they periodically
change the time and location of their checkpoints or apply a random
system to deter violators.

An American was arrested yesterday on charges of having 350 grammes of
heroin in his possession.

Lee Roy Frank, 55, was stopped at Chiang Rai airport at about 12.30 p.m.
as he was about to board a flight to Bangkok.

Police allegedly found 350 grammes of heroin hidden in a compartment of
his luggage.

Mr Frank had travelled to Thailand 12 times and visited Chiang Rai twice
before his arrest.

Meanwhile, police held two suspected drug traffickers in a separate raid.

Police stopped to search a pick-up believed to have smuggled illicit
drugs on the Chiang Saen-Chiang Khong road.

Driver Wirat Chanthawan, 33, of Chiang Rai's Wiang Pa Pao district, and
Monkasem Chainit, 42, of Nakhon Pathom, were caught after police found
5,000 amphetamine pills and 70 grammes of marijuana hidden in the

New chief for Port Authority

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 04

Amornrat Mahitirook

Thavorn Chunnanond has been nominated as the new Port Authority of
Thailand director, replacing Anuparb Sunananta who is to be transferred
to an inactive post, a source in the PAT board said yesterday.

Mr Thavorn was the agency's deputy director before the nomination made
in a meeting on Thursday of the PAT board headed by Navy chief Adm Vichit
Chamnankarn, its new chairman.

The nomination will be forwarded for cabinet endorsement today.

The source said Mr Anuparb will be made a water transport specialist at
the Transport and Communications Ministry as recommended by Deputy
Minister Chaipak Siriwat who oversees the PAT.

Learning of the upcoming change, Mr Anuparb initially planned to quit PAT
on September 30, but changed his mind after Mr Chaipak urged him to leave
even earlier than that, the source said.

That was why the change had to be effected through the board last week,
the source said.

Mr Anuparb was the deputy secretary-general of the National Economic and
Social Development Board before his appointment to head the PAT in
January last year.

Camp to be cleared by November: About 600 boatpeople to face repatriation

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 04

Prasit Tangprasert

Nakhon Ratchasima

Thailand plans to complete the repatriation of an estimated 600
Vietnamese boat people still at Sikhiu camp by mid-November, officials
said yesterday.

The remaining Vietnamese are to be sent back in groups at the rate of two
flights a week, they added.

Amid varying degrees of protest, Thai authorities have sent back a total
of 1,824 Vietnamese in 12 separate batches since the operation began on
July 1, after United Nations funding support ended.

A Vietnamese who was due to go back with the latest group on October 24
was rushed to hospital and narrowly escaped a suicide bid by swallowing
insecticide. Ninety-nine others made the journey back without him.

The Vietnamese, who have failed to be accepted for resettlement in third
countries, are being reintegrated into Vietnamese society with initial
support of US$240 each from the United Nations High Commissioner for
Refugees.

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 04

A man was killed while running after an elephant panicked by firecrackers
in Klong Toey late on Sunday night.

Butda Saendee was hit by a car outside Queen Sirikit Convention Centre
on Ratchadapisek Road as he ran after the elephant which the mahout could
not control.

Butda had been following the 30-year old elephant and mahout towards
Klong Toey when the animal ran in panic across the road.

Unaware a Mercedes Benz heading towards Klong Toey from Asoke-Sukhumvit
was approaching, he was run over and dragged 20m before the car came to
a halt.

The driver was charged with manslaughter.

Karen rebels to hold ceasefire talks with Slorc

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 04

Supamart Kasem

Tak

The anti-Rangoon Karen National Union is to enter into ceasefire talks
with the Rangoon junta on November 17, a source said yesterday.

Gen Bo Mya, the KNU president, took up Rangoon's offer after it was
discussed at a three-day meeting of 25 Karen executives at the Htee Ka
Per base, opposite Umphang.

The 25-member panel, chaired by Gen Bo Mya, assigned Lt-Gen Tamalabaw to
lead the talks with the State Law and Order Restoration Council.

It was agreed the KNU guerrillas will keep their arms and propose Slorc
withdraw its forces from around Karen-held areas.

If the parties reached a formal agreement, the KNU will ask the junta to
hold peace talks with all anti-Slorc minorities.

In the meantime, hostilities continue. Karens clashed with 100 troops of
Slorc's Battalion 257 near the border opposite Umphang last week.

Rangoon sent troops to guard a company prospecting for ore in the area
after it claimed to have received a protection demand.

Contract farming overhaul agreed: Current system puts farmers at great
risk

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 04

Chakrit Ridmontri

The government has agreed in principle to overhaul contract farming
whereby private firms will be required to share risks with farmers,
Agriculture Minister Suvit Khunkitti said yesterday.

Under the existing system firms submit their projects to the ministry,
and if approved, the Bank of Agriculture and Agricultural Cooperatives
(BAAC) extends soft loans to farmers.

This system puts farmers at a disadvantage because they are obliged to
buy all their production tools from the contracted firms. The firms in
turn buy the produce from them at a pre-determined price in the contract.
If, for whatever reasons, the quality of the produce does not meet the
contractual requirement the prices go down.

"The farmers have to be responsible for debts incurred in undertaking the
project while the private firms risk nothing, lose nothing," he said.

Many farmers are driven into bankruptcy as a result of the low quality
of seeds, fertiliser and equipment supplied by the firms.

The government-private sector coordinating committee for agriculture
development has suggested a cost-sharing system which would require
private firms to share risks with farmers.

"Under the new system private firms will provide the means of production
to the farmers who will repay the loans only after they have successfully
harvested the crops and sold the produce to the firms at pre-determined
prices," he said.

Under the current system farmers borrow money from the Bank of
Agriculture and Agricultural Cooperatives, but in the revised system the
private firms will have to borrow money from BAAC or other commercial
banks at 5% interest and transfer the cash to farmers or provide them
with equipment and production material.

Besides, the firms will have to deposit cash with BAAC amounting to 10%
of the value of the produce. This money will be used to assist farmers
if they face crop failure, he added.

If the farmers fail to meet contractual obligations they will be dropped
from the programme and required to repay their debts at the normal
interest rate.

Conversely, if the firms break the contract farmers can file for
compensation.

Mr Suvit said the ministry will submit the proposal to the cabinet soon.

Private firms, meanwhile, were not happy with the revised scheme.

A representative of Panchaphol Pulp Industry Co Ltd, which specialises
in fast-growing trees, said the company has decided to withhold its
project in light of the new cost-sharing system.

The project, spanning five years, would require soft loans totalling over
1,600 million baht to grow trees in the central region.

"The existing system is good enough. Private companies have no intention
to manipulate farmers," he said.

Move to probe NHA deal

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 04

The Interior Ministry may order a probe into a land deal in which the
National Housing Authority (NHA) allegedly bought a 832-rai plot in
Pathum Thani province at highly inflated prices.

Deputy Interior Minister Sornchai Montriwat who oversees the NHA said
Interior Permanent Secretary Chuwongse Chayabutr will soon decide whether
the deal should be investigated.

The NHA signed a contract on October 4 to buy a 832-rai plot in Lam Luk
Ka district at the rate of 1.8 million baht a rai, which is double the
official rate of 900,000 baht per rai.

Maj Sornchai later put the deal on hold after complaints of
irregularities in the deal.

The previous NHA board, headed by Interior Permanent Secretary Aree
Wong-araya who retired at the end of last month, approved the purchase
and the subsequent contract was signed on the day the cabinet ordered
dissolution of the board.

A new board was appointed with Mr Chuwongse as its chairman.

Maj-Gen Sornchai said he is waiting to hear from NHA Governor Preedi
Buranasiri why the agency paid so high a price for the land.

Land scam probe being speeded up

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 04

The prosecution team handling the Phuket Sor Por Kor 4-01 cases is
working round-the-clock to conclude examination of police investigation
into the land scandal.

"Once the examination of police reports is completed we will immediately
proceed with the cases," said Supreme Attorney-General Kanit na Nakhon.

Mr Kanit has been criticised by Prime Minister Banharn Silpa-archa for
proceeding too slow with the cases despite being handed the police
reports six months ago.

Mr Kanit sent a letter to Mr Banharn last Friday assuring him that his
agency was going slow on the cases. A similar letter was sent to Prime
Minister's Office Minsiter Pokin Polakul yesterday.

Meanwhile Direk Sunthornket, the deputy supreme attorney-general who
heads the prosecution team, said only the cases involving three land
reform officials, including Seri Thongruen, were still to be examined.

A retired army officer was crushed to death in a lift at Phra Mongkut
hospital yesterday.

Sub-Lt Poonsin Thongyoo, 64, was killed instantly when the doors closed
as he was stepping out and the lift started moving up.

Six people had stepped out on to the second flood before Sub-Lt Poonsin,
whose head and chest stuck out of the doors.

The former officer, who had worked at the hospital, had just seen a
doctor about a kidney ailment.

Col Issarachai Chullamok, deputy director of Phra Mongkut, said he felt
terrible about the accident and pledged the hospital would take full
responsibility.

Import of costly medical tools needless: Researcher says local supplies
plentiful

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 05

Increasing quantities of expensive medical equipment are being imported
needlessly, according to the Health Systems Research Institute.

Thailand has plenty of equipment that is not being put to full use, said
Dr Viroj Tangcharoensathien, a researcher at the institute.

Tax exemptions on imports under the free trade policy should be reviewed,
he said, to avoid over-consumption and inefficient use of equipment.

Dr Viroj said the medical equipment market expands at 20 percent a year,
rising from six billion baht in 1984 to 7.2 billion baht in 1995.

While the United States is a free market economy, it controls technology
used in its 52 states and avoids unethical market promotion.

"To bring an extra CT scanner (computer x-ray) into California, a
hospital needs a certificate of need and must prove full use is made of
existing equipment," he said. "In this case, it means it is used in 2,500
cases."

America also limits the number of disease centres, for instance there is
only one heart disease centre per city. "We have sufficient expensive
modern technology but it is under-used and has very low productivity,"
said Dr Viroj.

"To maximise use, it should be distributed to the provinces. Much of it
is in private hospitals in Bangkok."

A survey in May 1995 found there were 205 CT scanners (each costing 10-20
million baht), 20 Magnetic Resonance Image (MRI) computerised x-ray
machines (70-80 million baht), 37 extra corporeal shock wave lithotripter
(ESWL) used for stones of less than 3cm (8-39 million baht), 114 lasers
(cost varies) and 594 ultrasonograms (1-5 million baht).

The survey found that 59 CT scanners are used in public hospitals and 146
in private hospitals. Of those, 43 percent are in Bangkok.

MRIs: eight in public and 12 in private hospitals; 75 percent in Bangkok.
ESWLs: 19 in public and 18 in private hospitals; 38 percent in the
capital. Lasers: 36 in public and 66 in private hospitals; 88 percent in
Bangkok. Ultrasonograms: 259 in public and 309 in private hospitals; 36
percent in Bangkok.

Most of the equipment has a high health care cost impact on patients but
there have been no systematic evaluations of clinical outcome.

Dr Viroj said there is a probability of the needless application of
medical equipment, for which patients pick up the bill. The probability
of abuse involving ultrasonograms is high of lasers and MRI possible and
there is no definite information on CT scanner abuses.

Though there has been lesser abuse of ESWLs, they are only used on 50
percent of patients with stone disease.

Though most patients are from the lower income group, 38 percent have to
pay for treatment out of their own pockets. Since 30 percent come for
treatment when the stone is big -- more than 3cm -- they have operations
rather than ESWL treatment, he said.

Developed countries treat 80 percent of patients with ESWL because they
are treated when the stone is smaller than 3cm, he added.

New operation plan for city bus agency: Private sector to be assigned more
routes

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 05

Amornrat Mahitirook

The director of the Bangkok Mass Transit Authority, Arun Chirachavala,
has prepared an operational plan to help the debt-ridden bus agency
before announcing his resignation at the end of the month.

His resignation will follow the reshuffle of the BMTA board endorsed by
the cabinet earlier this month at the urging of Deputy Transport Minister
Chaipak Siriwat, who has been assigned to supervise the agency.

Mr Arun said the operational plan designed to be used in the next five
years will focus on improving three major areas of the bus agency so that
it can begin generating profit from 1998 onwards.

Under the first area of the plan, the BMTA will improve passenger bus
routes, the fare collection system, and bus conditions, and award more
routes to private operators.

Secondly, the agency will reduce the size of its own organisation by
reducing the number of its buses from 4,624 currently to 4,000 and cut
the number of staff from 23,346 currently to 17,573 within 2001.

The third area of the plan focuses on the BMTA's finances. The agency
will ask the government to subsidise the loss-ridden operation of
ordinary buses, the fares of which have been frozen in the public
interest.

The authority will also ask for approval to introduce a single fare rate
for air-conditioned buses.

The rate will be 12 baht per trip instead of the current one which ranges
from six to 16 baht depending on traveling distances.

The BMTA will also raise capital of 7,698.12 million baht to clear its
old losses.

If the plan is implemented, the agency will have a net profit of 447
million baht in 1998, Mr Arun said.

He described his operational plan as a "masterpiece".

BECL's guided bus project passes technical evaluation: Construction work
to begin next year

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 05

Supoj Wancharoen

The Expressway and Rapid Transit Authority (ETA) has passed the guided
bus project of the Bangkok Expressway Co Ltd (BECL) through its technical
evaluation.

ETA deputy governor Somchai Charukasemratana said an ETA sub-committee
selecting the guided bus operator met yesterday to consider the technical
aspects of the BECL's project, and agreed that the details complied with
the ETA's terms of reference.

The ETA will consider the financial proposal of the BECL next week and
expects that the construction of the system could start next year, he
said.

The BECL is the only contender vying for the contract of the project,
which will be built under the second-stage expressway system for a
distance of 16 kilometres from Chaeng Wattana to Victory Monument. The
firm is now operating the second-stage expressway.

Mr Somchai said the BECL proposed a guided bus system which could serve
5,000 passengers per hour per direction as the ETA required.

The firm also intended to use gas-fuelled buses from Germany with
diesel-fuelled buses as an option, he said.

The service proposed to charge 18 baht per trip, but the ETA would try
to cut it down, he said.

The ETA allows the guided bus operator to develop areas along the bus
route for commercial purposes, but the BECL has said that the areas are
not sufficient for commercial development.

The firm wants to develop the areas into parking lots for motorists to
leave their cars and catch guided buses, Mr Somchai said.

Arrest of saboteurs still to be verified: Army in touch with Malaysian
officials

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 05

The Army has been unable to verify a report that Pattani United
Liberation Organisation's military commander Haji Sama-ae Thanam and the
movement's three other leading members had been arrested by Malaysian
police with a large quantity of explosives, an Army source said.

According to the report Ma Pelis, the PULO secretary, Poh Sube, the
leader of its political wing, and Yama Sateng, chief of its sabotage
unit, were arrested along with Haji Sama-ae Thanam with a huge quantity
of C4 detonators while on their way from Kelentan to Kedah, some 40
kilometres south of Narathiwat's Su-ngai Kolok district.

Yama Sateng is believed to be the mastermind of the bomb blast at the Hat
Yai Railway Station early last year in which many people were killed and
wounded.

PULO is one of the Muslim separatist movements whose bandit groups
operate in southern border provinces.

The source said Army chief Gen Chestha Thanajaro had ordered military
intelligence units to check the report by coordinating with Malaysian
authorities. So far there had been no reply from Malaysia.

If the report is true, problems could arise in seeking their extradition
because it was still uncertain whether Haji Sama-ae held both Thai and
Malaysian nationalities, the source said.

The military is seeking confirmation of the arrests from the
Thai-Malaysian Coordination Office in Songkhla.

"The matter is a delicate one because it concerns political relations
between the two countries," the source said.

UN urged to oust regime

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 08

Asian advocates of democracy in Burma plan to call on the United Nations
to expel the country's military junta from the UN general assembly.

The UN should "take immediate steps to eject the Slorc [State Law and
Order Restoration Council] from the assembly on the grounds that the
Slorc is not the legitimate government of Burma", the activists said in
the draft of a declaration expected to be released tomorrow.

The "Alternative Asean Declaration on Burma" is being finalised at a
two-day meeting opening in Bangkok today that has drawn human rights
activists, trade unionists and academics within and outside Asean, as
well as members of Burma's pro-democracy movement.

An independent source noted that as the UN comprised sovereign states
only countries, not regimes, could be expelled from its assembly, which
meets yearly. Yugoslavia was the last UN member to be expelled from the
assembly, after South Africa.

The draft declaration also urges Asean to review its position on Burma,
saying Asean membership would provide the Slorc with a "de facto licence"
to continue its "attacks" on Burmese people.

Asean gave observer status to Burma in July, but remains undecided and
divided on when to integrate it into the organisation. The Slorc stepped
up pressure on pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi and her supporters
after applying for full membership of the grouping in August.

The activists' draft declaration also calls on the international
community to ban promotion of the Slorc's Visit Myanmar Year "until the
human rights situation improves in that country".

Spearheaded by the Asian Forum for Human Rights and Development (Forum
Asia), the activists also plan to launch an "Alternative Asean Network"
to mobilise regional support for democracy in Burma.

EU on offensive in Asem talks: Saroj: Move seen as ploy to raise touchy
subjects

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 08

Nussara Sawatsawang

The European Union has proposed that the 25 Asian and European countries
involved in the Asia-Europe Meeting (Asem) engage in "comprehensive"
political discussions, a senior Thai official said yesterday.

Permanent secretary for foreign affairs Saroj Chavanaviraj did not reveal
details of the proposal put forward at an informal meeting of senior
officials in Japan last week.

But another official said the EU proposed that the Asem discuss United
Nations reform, nuclear proliferation, regional issues, as well as
unspecified "values".

Launched in Bangkok in March, Asem so far has touched on general
questions, but made no provision for concrete discussion of political
issues.

According to Mr Saroj, Asian participants reacted cautiously to the EU
proposal, which was seen as an "offensive" by Europeans to raise
controversial issues like human rights, democratisation, and labour
standards.

The meeting on October 24 brought together senior officials of the Asem
members, including the 15 members of the EU, and 10 Asian countries:
Brunei, China, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines,
Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam.

"[The European Union] wants to launch an offensive in matters in which
there are still differences [between Asia and Europe]," Mr Saroj said.

"We [Asia and Europe] have our own [values]. They do not have to be the
same," he added.

Mr Saroj said political issues were already being discussed at other
forums, for instance the regular dialogue of foreign ministers of the EU
and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean).

The Asian side agreed to study the European proposal and discuss it
further at the next meeting of Asem officials in Dublin in December,
before their foreign ministers meet in Singapore in February, Mr Saroj
said.

East Timor and Burma are two controversial issues where Asia and Europe
have distinctly different approaches.

The EU did not indicate the format for the political discussions, or the
level of the would-be participants, said the official who asked not to
be named.

The official went on to say that Thailand feels that the discussions
should be informal, pragmatic and flexible, as was the approach of the
first Asem meeting here.

At the same meeting, Japan showed interest in taking part in development
cooperation in Indochina, the official added.

And although Japan was not invited to a meeting in Malaysia in June which
discussed development of the sub-region, Malaysia pointed out that Japan
would "eventually" join the programme, Mr Saroj said.

Thailand and Japan will host separate meetings of Asem finance and
economic ministers in September next year. Stabilising the monetary
system is on the tentative agenda of the finance ministers' meeting in
Thailand.

Based on consensus reached at the recent Asia-Europe business forum in
France, the senior officials agreed to exchange information on
investment, and to finalise discussions on policy and regulations by the
end of this year, the official said.

Vietnam elephant killer jailed for 20 years

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 08

Hanoi -- A Vietnamese man who killed a domesticated elephant for its
tusks has been jailed for 20 years and ordered to pay more than US$10,000
(200,000 baht) in damages, a report said yesterday.

The Supreme People's Court in Danang jailed Ho Van An for 20 years and
also imprisoned three accomplices for between five and 10 years for
killing the elephant in the central highlands province of Daklak, the
Saigon Times Daily said.

Mr An, 60, had several previous convictions for killing elephants, which
are a protected species in Vietnam. Most are killed for their tusks and
skins which can fetch thousands of dollars.

FEATURE / PHILIPPINES: The slums make way for Apec

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 14

CECILIA QUIAMBAO

Manila

They live beneath bridges, on unused lots and soap boxes precariously
propped up by stilts on the banks of rivers and open sewers. They push
shoddy wooden carts on daily prowls through the metropolis, rooting at
garbage cans for food and scraps. Their only contact with the rest of the
city is when they rap at car windows to beg, hawk cigarettes by the stick
or snatch a purse or a wristwatch from pedestrians.

Now, as the Philippines steps on to the world stage with the coming out
party of its once-ailing economy, the great unwashed of the Philippine
capital are under siege as the government lays on a giant snow job to put
a silver lining to its imperfections.

Three people have been killed and several hundred others have so far been
injured, a rights monitor here says, as giant squatter colonies which
blight this city of eight million are torn down by government demolition
crews armed with crowbars and court orders ahead of the November 25
summit of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) forum.

President Fidel Ramos denies any connection between the slum campaign and
Apec, and last week controversially stopped the demolition of a colony
of 4,000 squatter shanties clogging a waterway in the central Manila
district of Paco.

Mr Ramos, who at that time had been holding a dialogue with a church
support group calling for an end to violent demolitions, said that "if
what happened is intentional, this is subverting the government".

The Department of Interior and Local Government said it has relocated
22,320 squatters so far to government-built relocation sites in the
nearby provinces of Bulacan and Cavite, and that about 300,000 remain to
be removed.

Some analysts say the latter figure is grossly understated.

Manila and its satellite cities and towns hold about 12 percent of the
population of 68 million, and a World Bank study shows a third of the
eight million residents do not hold a title or contract allowing them to
stay in their current abode.

The big numbers of these squatters are routinely blamed for causing
crime, flooding, pollution, disease and other ills which how afflict this
city. Last month, Health Department investigators traced the cause of a
cholera outbreak which killed five people to an illegal tap in the water
system, possibly contaminated by human faeces from a squatter colony
which had been stealing the water.

"There is a certain Hobbesian element that sets Manila apart," said
University of the Philippines political science professor Alex Magno.

He described Manila as a "cruel city" where "the air is bad, traffic is
terrible, sewage does not work, a third of the population live in slums,
housing is expensive".

The vice mayor of the city of Manila, Lito Atienza, said the Paco
squatters at the centre of the Apec flap had been notified to vacate the
area two years ago, with them "fully aware that they are occupying a
danger zone".

"With or without Apec, we are using our mandate which maintains the good
living conditions of our constituents," said Mr Atienza.

The congestion of Manila is blamed by the government on the lack of
employment opportunities in provincial areas. Most of the squatters
regularly run over by speeding trains are migrants from provinces south
of Manila which arrived by rail in search of jobs and proceeded to build
their shacks beside the tracks.

"One has to be glad that the Apec meeting has been scheduled here," said
Horacio Paredes, a cabinet member in the previous administration of
Corazon Aquino.

"If the holding of such a meeting clears the city of squatters, at least
along the roads and waterways that the rest of us need to maintain
resident-free for the metropolis to have some breathing space, then well
and good," he said.

"Imagine how much urine, human excrement and garbage those 4,000 families
dump into that canal daily," he said of the Paco squatters.

Some politicians say squatter colonies are coddled by some local
officials, who find in them a big reservoir of swing votes to keep them
in power in the next local election.

"Their presence there is symptomatic of the failure of government to
govern properly," said Mr Paredes.

Complicating the resettlement problem is a law that states that slum
abodes cannot be demolished unless a relocation site has been prepared
for the residents ahead of time. Critics say this gives the act of
squatting an attractive incentive.

The law does not cover those who obstruct roads and waterways and those
who live in zones that are considered dangerous to human habitation, such
as river banks or beside railroad tracks.

Opinion on the whole issue however is divided.

Manila Times newspaper concedes that while "the cost of keeping blighted
communities now exacts a toll on nearly everyone, from questions of
sanitation and health to matters of peace and order", it argued that
"there must be a more dignified way of cleaning up the metropolis other
than chasing people down with truncheons and water hoses".

Looking to the longer term, the government has initiated moves to try to
decongest the city. It is now granting tax incentives to companies which
set up industrial enclaves in other regions and to the factories which
set up there.

Many of the new industrial projects are now being set up in the so-called
Calabarzon growth area, comprising the provinces of Cavite, Laguna,
Batangas, Rizal and Quezon, south of Manila.

President Ramos has also created a government task force to study other
means of dispersing economic growth, which serves as a magnet for
migrants, to other regions.

Parties turn up the heat in the battle for Bangkok

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 14

BANYAT TASANEEYAVEJ

The heat is rising in the lead up to the election two weeks from now, and
the 37 seats in Bangkok will be the determining factor in whether Chuan
Leekpai or Chavalit Yongchaiyudh becomes the country's 22nd prime
minister.

As the centre of information with the largest educated population,
Bangkok has always acted as somewhat of a barometer in measuring the
political climate around the country.

And since the people of the capital are closest to the seat of power,
they follow the moves of politicians and their parties more closely than
their rural cousins and can be turned off or on by the slightest thing.
It is for this reason that no single party has ever been able to dominate
the city for any length of time before falling out of favour.

The Democrats once held the hearts and minds of city people in the years
when they fought the military dictatorship. Prachakorn Thai captured
nearly every seat in Bangkok in the mid-1970s when the country swung to
political right, and Palang Dharma swept aside all challengers in the
late 1980s and early 1990s when the public became fed up with corruption
and opted for a party promising them honesty.

The political wind seems to be blowing again in the Democrat Party's
favour for the November 17 election. The Democrats know their immediate
political future rests with taking the capital since they cannot hope to
beat New Aspiration in the Northeast where vote-buying is the determining
factor.

The Democrat team chosen to contest the city have been selected based on
their perceived ability to undertake the key issues of political reform
and economic management. Most members of the Democrats' so-called
economic dream team are running in Bangkok; Tarrin Nimmanhaeminda,
Supachai Panitchpakdi, Abhisit Vejjajiva and Savit Bhotiwihok.

Mr Chuan went to pains during his two-hour speech at the party rally at
Royal Plaza Saturday to excite the political consciences of city folk.
He told them his party won only seven seats in Bangkok in the last
election, while the other 30 were won by parties which threw their
support behind Banharn Silpa-archa.

History, he said, might repeat itself if the Democrat candidates are not
elected in great numbers.

Most of the Democrat seats last election came from the South, where the
party expects to win most of the 52 available seats this time. But the
largest number of seats, 137, are concentrated in the 17 provinces of the
Northeast, where Gen Chavalit's New Aspiration Party is expected to do
well since it has recruited the largest number of known politicians from
the region.

In the last general election, the NAP captured 36 seats in the Northeast,
Chart Thai 29, Chart Pattana 27 and the Social Action Party and Democrats
14 each.

With such a short campaign period, vote-buying is expected to be even
worse in the Northeast this year. This means Bangkok represents the only
hope for the Democrats in beating the NAP and returning Mr Chuan as prime
minister.

In the last general election in Bangkok, the Palang Dharma Party won 16
seats, Prachakorn Thai 12, the Democrats seven and Muan Chon two.

The other parties will be ganging up on the Democrats this time. Though
Palang Dharma is not an ally of either Prachakorn Thai or Muan Chon, it
will have to join in on the attack on the Democrats.

Both Prachakorn Thai and Palang Dharma have been attacking the Democrats
for raising the issue of Mr Banharn's and his father's nationality during
the no-confidence debate. The raising of the race issue by the Democrats
was not very well received by the ethnic Chinese community in Bangkok.

In the Thanam Ratchawong Chinese community for example, a large poster
declares: "We don't want politicians who look down on the ethnic origin
of fellow Thais."

The community is in Constituency 2, the former stronghold of the PDP
leader. Even though Thaksin Shinawatra is not running this time, party
candidate Orathai Kanchanachusak hopes to keep the three seats there
under the party's control.

The Democrats are fielding a strong team in the constituency made up of
former House Speaker Marut Bunnag, respected academic M.R. Sukhumbhand
Paribatra and dream team member Supachai Panitchpakdi. If all three can
win a seat, this would shatter the PDP's strongest base in the city.

Mr Chuan is now concentrating his efforts on helping party candidates
campaign in Bangkok using a two-pronged approach: Getting people to vote
for them and building fear among constituents of the possibility of Gen
Chavalit becoming premier.

Dateline Bangkok: Race debate is unhealthy

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 15

Destructive criticism seems to be the theme of most campaigns launched
by political parties contesting the coming election. Instead of talking
about the policies of their parties, candidates tend to engage in
mud-slinging that could create political conflict and division among the
people.

In the July 2 general election last year, the Prachakorn Thai and Palang
Dharma parties, the two major political rivals in Bangkok, lost much of
their popularity among voters.

Palang Dharma, in particular, came under much public criticism because
of dramatic changes in its political role and conduct. Both Palang Dharma
and Prachakorn Thai are Bangkok-based parties. They have shown no
interest in expanding party branches outside the capital to make
themselves a truly mass party.

In the September 13, 1992 general election, Palang Dharma lost many of
its seats while Prachakorn Thai won only two seats in Bangkok. The
Democrat Party made considerable gains. In last year's election in
Bangkok, both Palang Dharma and the Democrats suffered a setback, while
Prachakorn Thai made considerable gains. Palang Dharma and Prachakorn
Thai, however, were invited to join the Banharn Government.

The first no-confidence debate in May this year led to a Cabinet
reshuffle. Both Palang Dharma and Prachakorn Thai resigned and then
rejoined the Government in a manner that caused much confusion among the
public. The Democrats, meanwhile, managed to regain its popularity by
explaining its handling of the Sor Por Kor 4-01 land programme to the
public.

Palang Dharma leader Thaksin Shinawatra and his predecessor Chamlong
Srimuang are not contesting the coming election. As the election campaign
hots up in Bangkok, Palang Dharma and Prachakorn Thai are apparently
joining hands to attack the Democrats. Political friendship is a good
thing, but both parties should not bring up the issue of racial prejudice
because it could cause disunity in the country.

Bangkok Post Postbag: Changes at council part of a re-focus

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 15

There has been some speculation in your letters column about the British
Council, and I would like to take this opportunity to respond to the
various queries regarding its function, its library and information
service, art gallery, educational counselling service and English
language centre.

The British Council is Britain's principal agency for cultural relations
with other countries and its work in these countries is supported by a
grant from the British Government. It actively promotes educational,
cultural and technical cooperation between Britain and the rest of the
world. In each country the British Council adapts its services to meet
the particular needs of that country.

Consequently the services offered in India, Malaysia, Japan or Singapore
will differ from those offered in Thailand. In Thailand, the British
Council through its offices in Bangkok and Chiang Mai, offers a wide
range of services. First of all, it provides access to information about
contemporary Britain. Furthermore, it initiates and develops projects
between British and Thai government, educational and non-government
organisations, particularly in the fields of English language teaching,
education, science and engineering, health, the environment, governance
and the law, and the arts. In these areas it has a particular track
record of promoting long-term partnerships between British and Thai
universities and other education institutions.

The British Council Library in Bangkok makes available English language
teaching materials (including audio-visual and multimedia programmes) to
all its library members. When the British Council moved to its new
location at 254 Chulalongkorn Soi 64 on the edge of the Chulalongkorn
campus in Siam Square, it decided to use the opportunity to re-focus its
library and information services so as to respond more effectively to the
demands of the majority of its members.

Based on research and data collected from its members' borrowing habits,
it decided to extend those areas where demand was greatest and also
update its technology to provide a more efficient service. Some areas and
books which were less well used were removed. In addition to information
about all aspects of Britain, the British Council library now offers its
members a comprehensive collection of materials on English language
teaching and study, a selection of British newspapers and periodicals as
well as British films, documentaries and popular television programmes
on video and a collection of modern British fiction.

For the use of library members, government and educational institutions
seeking information on the United Kingdom, a reference section with books
and CD ROM is also available. We are continually adding to this material,
but information not immediately available can be obtained from the
British Library in the UK. The opening hours of the library have also
been extended and we are now open six days a week.

The British Council library was never intended as a general library and
reading room, but as a gateway to information on contemporary Britain.
To make space for the specialist areas that have been in heavy demand
from the Thai public, educational institutions and other users of our
services, we either donated the excess books to Thai educational
institutions or sold them to our library users for a small consideration.

If some residents in Bangkok missed the sale that was held in the library
premises over several months, I am sorry that they lost the occasion to
acquire some excellent books. I can only advise them to turn up for the
annual Ploenchit Fair on Nov 23 at the British Embassy when the British
Council will again be running the second hand book stall (if any Bangkok
Post readers have unwanted books in reasonable condition we would be
pleased to take them off your hands -- the proceeds all go to charity).

The British Council continues to have art exhibitions on its premises,
there have been two since we moved. In addition to the forthcoming
exhibition of "Thailand Drawings" by Justin Knowles (Nov 4-23), whose
work was recently acquired by the Tate Gallery in London, and another
exhibition of prints based on nursery rhymes by Paula Rego (Nov 24-Dec
20), we have acquired from the British Council Collection in London
several works by British artists and sculptors for permanent display.

As in a number of our offices around the world, the British Council in
Thailand offers individual and group counselling and information to all
those interested in study and training in Britain. This service is
offered free of charge by our specially-trained Educational Counselling
Service (ECS) staff who guide applicants through the process of choosing
a course at British educational or training institutions to best suit
their particular needs. They can advise them on how to apply for that
course and even provide a follow-up service if required.

The ECS also holds a broad range of reference materials, as well as
prospectuses, CD ROM databases and videos from schools, institutes and
universities. They also provide detailed information on fees, and
scholastic and English language requirements for entrance to secondary,
graduate and post-graduate courses in the UK. In addition, the British
Council will be holding its 10th annual British Education Exhibition at
Imperial Queen's Park Hotel in Bangkok from Nov 22-24, where interested
candidates can meet with representatives from about 100 British schools,
colleges and universities.

The ECS office is located in the main entrance hall of the new British
Council premises in Siam Square and we are sorry that the two visitors
to our office who wrote to your newspaper failed to notice it. The ECS
is now also available in Chiang Mai and the British Education Exhibition
will this year, for the first time, also visit Chiang Mai (Nov 28-29) at
Lotus Hotel, Pang Suan Kaew.

The English Language Centres of the British Council across the world
believe in setting high standards in English language teaching. This
applies to the range of courses we offer in Siam Square where we cater
for beginner, intermediate and advanced levels of study, for younger and
mature learners and as well as to our other teaching operations in Chiang
Mai and New Phetchaburi Road. We therefore recruit well-qualified and
experienced native-speakers of English as teachers. They use up-to-date
materials and facilities matched to the needs of the class and in Siam
Square have available a CALL (Computer Assisted Language Learning) Room
equipped with purpose-designed CD ROM materials.

I hope this letter will satisfy the queries of your letter writers. Our
records indicate that none of your correspondents on this issue are
currently members of the library. However, my colleagues and I are ready
to answer any queries and complaints, and would encourage those with
concerns to discuss them directly with us so we can improve our services
to library members, centre students and other users of the British
Council.

Bangkok Post Postbag: Not every Aussie has racist views

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 15

I refer to the recent coverage of the racism debate in Australia. It
concerns me greatly that your readers are getting an impression of
Australia as a racially intolerant society simply because of remarks made
by an ignorant minority. I would like to put the debate into perspective.

Australia is a democracy and the second largest multicultural nation in
the world. As such, it represents a wide variety of different cultures
and views. Recently, a very small minority of elected representatives
have made racially based remarks which the majority of Australians reject
and despise. The fact that nine out of 10 members of Port Lincoln Council
resigned because of the racist remarks of its mayor illustrates this
point clearly.

Racism exists everywhere. As a Caucasian, I have also been the subject
of racism during my travels in Asia, but I do not see everyone in Asia
as racist because of an ignorant few.

We must all fight against racism. The fight is happening in Australia
now.

Australians are proud of their rich multicultural heritage and their
position in Asia. Never doubt that.

Bangkok Post Postbag: Ticky-tackyness of US politics

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 15

I was watching the American vice presidential debate recently on Channel
7 and I noticed the similarity between Al Gore and a young Ronald Reagan.
The way Al Gore held his head and looked into the camera reminded me of
how our Ron used to look.

Is Al a secret member of Ron's family or is it a prerequisite for
American politicians to come from the same mould?

It all reminds me of that old song, "Little Boxes", where the chorus
goes: "And they are all made of ticky tacky and they all look just the
same".

Commentary by Paisal Sricharatchanya: Station outside Mater Dei should go

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 15

In the weeks and months after the second school semester reopens this
Friday, Bangkok will witness a new struggle of an extraordinary kind.

After a year of quiet and unsuccessful negotiations with the various
parties concerned, the prestigious, all-girl Mater Dei School on
Ploenchit Road will begin mounting a public campaign to get rid of a
planned electric train station right outside its front door that -- if
built -- will almost definitely worsen the children's quality of life and
pose serious hazards to their health and safety.

The campaign is at the centre of what looks like a grossly uneven match.
A well-behaved and deferential Catholic school is finally forced to stand
tall to fight against the financially-powerful and politically
well-connected BTSC, the concessionaire of Bangkok's elevated electric
train project.

But the solidarity movement that has taken shape among the almost 2,000
students, their parents and teachers plus alumnae is determined to fight
to the very end.

The high point of a comprehensive package of campaign strategies calls
for a petition to His Majesty the King, who spent part of his childhood
at this very school. The petition, however, will be a last resort if and
after all else fails.

This is not simply a fight between the school and BTSC. At stake is the
vital question of whether innocent children who will graduate to become
the country's precious human resources should fall victim to greedy and
irresponsible Big Business.

What is also pertinent to this campaign is another crucial question of
whether greater transparency and accountability should be instilled into
the national decision-making process of granting concessions to
large-scale public projects bearing a direct impact on the environment
and citizens' rights.

In the apparent haste with which the electric-train project was approved
during the tenure of former Bangkok Governor Chamlong Srimuang,
fundamental requirements such as a proper environmental impact assessment
study have either been glossed over or imperfectly fulfilled.

Given the fact that construction of the entire project is going ahead at
full steam, it appears there's no turning back in spite of its known and
unknown shortcomings.

But the ghastly structure that is planned to become one of the main
stations right in front of Mater Dei should be shifted elsewhere. And if
shifting it to another adjacent location is not possible, the station
should be scrapped.

Siting a large and crowded train station at the doorstep of an all-girl
school smacks of extreme irresponsibility on the part of the project
managers. The high-pitch noise and polluting particles resulting from
trains arriving at and departing from the station every two minutes will
pose appalling health hazards to the school children. This is not to
mention other threats to their safety.

Alternatively, scrapping of the Mater Dei station should cause little
financial damage to the project operator -- if finances are their main
concern -- since passengers travelling on the route can still be
adequately served by two not-too-distant stations: one in front of the
Mahathun Building and the other just around the corner near the Regent
Hotel.

A dangerous precedent will be set where innocent students at other
educational institutions may also be victimised in the future if this
serious blunder is allowed to go ahead.

All the phu yais at BTSC and Bangkok Metropolitan Administration will do
a great service not only to the Mater Dei students but also the public
at large if they demonstrate the sort of moral conscience and social
responsibility expected of them by ordering the relocation or scrapping
of the planned station.

Sakchay takes on sport's top job

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 16

Suchin Chirakul

In a surprise decision, Dr Sakchay Tapsuwan was yesterday appointed
Governor of the Sports Authority of Thailand (SAT), taking over from Dr
Somchai Prasertsiriphant who resigned suddenly last week.

Long serving deputy governor Dr Charoenthat Jinthanaseri had been tipped
to take over the post.

Minister of the Prime Minister's Office Pongpol Adireksarn, who is the
SAT president, announced that the SAT committee endorsed Dr Sakchay to
be governor for the next four years.

The meeting acknowledged the resignation of Dr Somchai, who was governor
for six years and who many thought would stay on much longer until his
retirement.

Although Dr Somchai officially retired to give someone else a chance at
the job, it is generally believed major internal conflicts were the real
reason for his resignation.

Late last year he had been sacked as director of the organising committee
of the 1998 Asian Games in Bangkok and there had been some questions
about his administrative ability.

However, Dr Somchai, who has worked for Thai sport for 28 years, is not
totally out of the picture and has been named special councillor where
he will still have a say in decision making.

Dr Sakchay is also vice-president of the International Amateur Boxing
Association and secretary of the Amateur Boxing Association of Thailand.
He is closely involved with the 13th Asian Games.

The new governor is regarded as a good administrator and diplomat, which
is essential for organising big tournaments.

With Dr Somchai's resignation the governorship has now become a four-year
post, but one that can be renewed for two more years.

SAT also announced yesterday its budget for next year would be over 4
million baht, most of which would be used for the Asian Games.

Somprasong chairman faces fraud charges: Prasong evades warrant, employees
try to block search

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 01 (Business Section)

Krissana Parnsoonthorn and Busrin Treerapongpichit

Police are hunting for leading property developer Prasong Panitpakdee on
charges of doctoring financial statements, falsifying his company's
reports and destroying evidence.

There were rumours yesterday that Mr Prasong, chairman and managing
director of troubled Somprasong Land Plc, had fled the country. However,
police believe he is still in Thailand.

An arrest warrant was issued after Economic Crime Investigation Division
police received complaints from a group of Somprasong shareholders. A
preliminary investigation found grounds to believe that Mr Prasong was
responsible for wrongdoing.

A search warrant was also issued for the Somprasong headquarters in the
Klong Sarn area of Thon Buri.

Economic Crime Investigation officers arrived at the building at 10 a.m.
but company employees wouldn't let them in. They relented after police
showed them the search warrant -- and threatened to arrest them if they
resisted.

The employees continued to make the officers' job difficult by refusing
to give them keys to certain rooms. Police had to call a locksmith to
open the rooms, which they found filled with destroyed documents and
piles of others awaiting destruction.

Officers also forced open an out-of-service elevator and found it filled
with destroyed documents.

Police said they believed Mr Prasong knew in advance that they were
preparing to move in on him, and that he ordered his employees to start
destroying documents at 3 a.m. yesterday.

Investigators collected documents hat had not been destroyed but a
Somprasong lawyer would not allow them to take the documents out of the
building.

The Economic Crime Investigation officers called local police at Samrae
Police Station for help. They had called Somdej Chaophraya Station
earlier, but were told that Somprasong executives had asked a senior
officer to refuse the station's help to the Economic Crime police.

Reinforced by local police, the economic police eventually took the
documents to Samrae Station.

Police said Mr Prasong is likely to face additional charges of share
manipulation. Officers said they found many share certificates and some
evidence that Mr Prasong may have been involved in manipulating the
prices of certain stocks.

According to the complaints lodged by company shareholders, Somprasong
had falsified its earnings from several property projects in reports to
the Stock Exchange of Thailand. This misled investors to believe that the
company's performance was favourable, they complained.

News could spark realty share selloff: Somprasong lenders can also expect
investor scrutiny

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 01 (Business Section)

Cholada Ingsrisawang and Busakorn Pothasuthon

News that leading executives from Somprasong Land are under police
investigation is expected to hurt the entire realty sector, with worried
investors looking to sell property stocks.

That said, although the preliminary news about Somprasong was broken by
local newspapers yesterday, the company's stock price closed at 8.40
baht, up 0.30 baht, with stocks worth 11.23 million baht.

Industry analysts said financial firms acting as creditors for Somprasong
would also be hurt by the news even though most had plans in place to
deal with financial troubles of their clients in the reality sector.

The creditors all reported having sufficient collateral from the troubled
firm, though the auction of land used as collateral might not be enough
to recover the total loans under slow market conditions.

The analysts said Somprasong Land had been hurt by long-running rumours
that it was struggling, with rumour-mongers possibly trying to depress
the price of the company's stock so that they could eventually take over
the struggling firm at the cheapest price possible.

Banterng Tantivit, the chairman of National Finance & Securities Plc,
Somprasong Land's major creditor, said yesterday that his firm would not
be hurt by the news because it had sufficient collateral to back up its
loans to the firm.

Siam City Bank president Som Jatusipitak said his bank had extended about
100 million baht to the Somprasong Group, but the collateral placed
against the loan did not meet the loan's worth.

Dr Som said other banks had also loaned money to the group on collateral
of less than the value of the loans.

He explained that the problem had arisen because at the time the loan
contracts were made, the property sector was booming with Somprasong Land
leading the way.

Meanwhile, Stock Exchange of Thailand president Singh Tangtatsawas said
the SET would study the case and decide whether the current problems were
simply personal in nature.

"If it is a personal issue, then the SET will not suspend Somprasong
Land's stock from trading," Mr Singh said.

Promotion zones in Northeast proceed

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 01 (Business Section)

The Board of Investment says it will go ahead with a plan to develop a
special promotion zone in 12 northeastern provinces.

The board said the area was appropriate after calls to establish a
similar zone to the five southernmost provinces.

BoI Deputy Secretary General Chakkramol Pasukvanich said 12 northeastern
provinces were selected for the plan because they were the poorest, with
an average per capita income under the gross national product (GNP).

The income of people in the five southernmost provinces was above GNP and
infrastructure system was better.

BoI feared that to heed private sector calls would create a precedent
which would allow other provinces to also set up a similar zone.

According to World Trade Organisation regulations, average income must
be lower than GNP when offering special privileges to avoid excessive
export advantages over other countries.

Mr Chakkramol said the northeastern plan will be submitted to Cabinet
after the new government is formed, regardless of which political party
is the coalition core.

New tool in money market: Central bank plans more active role in managing
liquidity

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 01 (Business Section)

The Bank of Thailand expects to introduce a new tool by the end of the
year to help it manage the money market more effectively.

Known as open market operation, the system will make the central bank an
active player in the money market through bond trading with local
financial institutions selected as direct dealers..

Central bankers say the system will allow them to allocate liquidity
better and minimise liquidity fluctuation.

The Bank of Thailand currently manages money market liquidity through the
bond repurchase market, meaning it must wait for financial firms' call
to buy or sell bonds with a repurchase agreement.

Once the system is in place, the central bank will be able to adjust
liquidity in the market right away by calling its primary dealers.

Those dealers must have a good liquidity management and be able to quote
the bidding and offering rate of their bonds instantly, so the central
bank can inject liquidity into the market by purchasing bonds and absorb
it by selling them.

"Under the new method, the Bank of Thailand will be able to manage
liquidity more efficiently. The method will create confidence in the
market in times when there might be abrupt impact on the market's
liquidity.

"In a way, the central bank will provide direction and avoid the
fluctuation of local interest rates," said Paiboon Kittisrikangwan, chief
analyst in the central bank's banking department.

He ruled out suggestions by some analysts that the bonds circulating in
the system were insufficient for the operation.

Mr Paiboon said private bonds circulating in the banking sector were
worth about 300 billion baht, with state-enterprise bonds worth 250
billion, Bank of Thailand bonds 19 billion baht and Government bonds 22
million baht.

"The amount is enough for the central bank to intervene in the money
market and guide its monetary policy," he said, adding that this system,
together with the central bank's moves to adjust the mechanisms for
quoting interest in the bond repurchase market, would force financial
firms to adjust their liquidity more effectively.

The central bank will trade only bonds with one-month-up maturity,
resulting in market managed liquidity in the longer term.

In the first stage, the central bank expects to choose 15-20 finance
firms as its dealers. Those dealers must be able to trade bonds worth 10
billion baht with the central bank.

A letter has already been sent to all local financial firms inviting them
to apply for the available positions.

Dealers working with the central bank to manage liquidity will benefit
by being allowed to trade bonds after the operational time of the bond
repurchase market.

GM to take over Opel distribution

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 03 (Business Section)

General Motors will take over the distribution of Opel vehicles in
Thailand from its local distributor Phra Nakorn Automobile Ltd (PNA),
starting on January 1.

However PNA, which has distributed Opels since 1991, "is expected to
continue to play a leading role in marketing Opel products here", the US
automaker said in a statement.

General Motors Thailand will have full responsibility for the import,
distribution, sales, marketing and after-sales of the European car brand.

"The change in our distribution strategy is confirmation of our
commitment to grow the GM business in Thailand," GM Thailand president
Ronald Frizzell said.

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 03 (Business Section)

Citibank has introduced an unsecured revolving-credit account designed
to replace cash with other flexible options.

They include cheques designed for young executives who want liquidity in
the form of a revolving cash fund or capital reserve for operating a
business or other purpose.

A high credit limit allows customers access to funds in an emergency of
up to 3.5 times their monthly income, up to 350,000 baht. No collateral
guarantors are required and the service is not limited to existing
customers, Citibank said in a statement.

Emirates Airlines suspends VN flight

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 03 (Business Section)

Emirates Airlines has decided to suspend its twice-weekly flights from
Dubai to Ho Chi Minh City, starting on December 1.

The service, introduced one year ago, was not viable because Vietnamese
authorities would not allow the airline to carry passengers beyond
Vietnam, the Dubai-based carrier said in a statement.

The airline has been operating services to Singapore and other points via
Bangkok, but was never granted rights to take passengers between Ho Chi
Minh City and Singapore or Bangkok.

In a bid to recover more of their loans to the financially-ailing
Vidhyakom Plc, the company's creditors will hold a second round of stock
sales.

National Finance & Securities Plc and Kiatnakin Finance & Securities Plc
jointly extended loans to Vidhyakom, which gave stocks of subsidiary
Pacific Asset Plc as collateral.

Both National Finance and Kiatnakin Finance plan to sell off another 20%
of the Pacific Asset stock.

National Finance, through subsidiary Supannika Co, last week sold off a
10% stake in Pacific Asset worth 146 million baht. However, Vidhyakom
still has outstanding loans with National Finance worth 30 million baht.

Interbank rate climbs slightly

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 03 (Business Section)

The tight money market and the pending US presidential election are
influencing interbank rates.

Last week the interbank rate was quoted around 12%. It was climbing
slightly up investors bought US dollars and sold other currencies.

One analyst, who declined to be named, said the greenback was
appreciating with the approach of the presidential election and would
slip back to a normal level after the poll. The exchange rate yesterday
was about 25.52 baht, while the mid-rate quoted last week was 25.48 baht.

As a result, the retail rate is close to 26 baht if commissions and other
costs are included.

Customs tell traders to get competitive: Tax subsidies can come later

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 03 (Business Section)

The Customs Department has signalled a warning to exporters, urging them
to sharpen their competitive edge before Government tax subsidies are
waived on exports.

A customs source said the tax subsidy was introduced to promote exports.

Under the subsidy system, the Customs Department would calculate a
subsidy rate for exporters, which it prefers to call compensation.

The source said compensation meant exporters would be exempted from
paying import duties on raw materials used for export-oriented
production, and freed from paying value-added tax. Exporters would also
get tax reprieves on the export of some machinery and fuel.

Compensation rates now range between 0.17-8% of the export value, down
from the previous 11%.

The source said the car industry benefits most with a reprieve of 8%.

But the source said exporters will have to prepare themselves by
sharpening their competitive edge to cope with international competition
when the government help stops.

He said the Government could no longer shoulder the tax burden.

An agreement of the World Trade Organisation also says the compensation
will have to be waived to create fairer competition, the source said.

But Customs Department director-general Supachai Panitchpakdi said
Thailand has to retain compensation to stimulate foreign investment.

But he said the measure might later be reviewed.

He said compensation has caused worries among department officials
because it opens the way for unscrupulous people to claim false tax
export figures to claim tax rebates.

Beginning in January next year, the department would counter false export
tax claims by introducing an accounting system to control tax claims for
imported raw materials.

He said it would not be compulsory for exporters to participate in the
new system, but he would like them to take part and capitalise on its
benefits.

An accounting system would facilitate exporters, therefore the department
would not pressure exporters to participate, he said.

Tripods cut exploration costs: Platforms first to be designed locally

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 03 (Business Section)

Unocal Thailand is introducing new locally-designed platforms for its
extensive gas production in the Gulf of Thailand.

The new platforms will help the US gas prospector to cut the overall cost
of developing gas reserves in the Gulf of Thailand.

Fabrication of the first two fully automated tripod (three-pile)
well-head platforms is near completion and installation of those
structures in Funan and Pladang fields is planned for early next year.

These tripod platforms, the first to be designed and installed in
Thailand, offer substantial savings on fabrication costs over traditional
four-pile platforms. Unocal's offshore wellhead platforms, currently
totalling 60, have traditionally been of the four-pile type.

Unocal's tripod platform is more compact than a four-pile one. It
requires 755 tons less steel, is insensitive to water depth, and is fully
automated. Most importantly, it is as safe and strong as the conventional
type, and can support the same number of drilled wells.

Unocal Thailand president Brian Marcotte said the new concept formed part
of Unocal's attempt to reduce the overall cost of developing gas reserves
in the Gulf.

"Tripod platforms will have a significant impact on how Unocal operates
its fields in the Gulf and elsewhere around the world. They are the
platforms of our future," the American executive said.

A multi-disciplinary team of Thailand-based technical professionals,
including geologists and engineers, came up with a design to suit the
actual geological conditions and drilling experience in the Gulf of
Thailand. From engineering design to completion, the team took less than
a year.

Drilling of gas wells will be carried out by a jackup rig, which will be
able to move between development well and delineation well activities as
needed, thus eliminating the need to use two different rig types.

The company recently sailed away its last four-pile platform from Thai
Nippon Steel's fabrication yard in Samut Prakan. Thai Nippon Steel has
built most of Unocal's platforms to date. It is also the fabrication
contractor for the tripod platforms.

Operating for co-concessionaires Mitsui Oil Exploration and PTT
Exploration & Production (PTTEP), Unocal has been producing natural gas
from fields in the Gulf of Thailand since 1981.

Unocal gas production from fields in the Gulf in the first nine months
of this year came to an average of 735 million cubic feet per day (MMcfd)
and 26,482 barrels per day (b/d) of condensate.

Industry aims to top Malaysia: Call for leaders who can see potential

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 03 (Business Section)

Kornrarath Silsmith

The Federation of Thai Industries (FTI) and the Industrial Finance
Corporation of Thailand (IFCT) are convinced Thailand's electrical
appliances and electronics sectors can overtake those of Malaysia to be
ranked top in the region.

This is possible if the new government has good vision, they said.

Sompong Nakornsri, president of FTI's electrical and electronics group,
told an Industrial Finance Corporation of Thailand seminar of the
potential in Thailand's electrical and electronics industry.

Thai industrialists can produce electrical appliances and electronics
themselves because they have cheap labour, raw materials and good
supporting industries.

Thailand can also develop technology itself and improve products to be
in line with worldwide standards. As a developing country, the local
market has a high demand for these products, which could also be
exported.

But Thailand has before lacked leaders with a long-ranging and clear
vision, which meant the industries were not well developed.

High technology electrical products such as electrical fans, motors,
adaptors and compressors are better than those produced in Malaysia.

To help Thailand occupy the top rank in the production of electrical and
electronics goods within the next decade, the new government should have
five-, 10-and 15-year plans to promote investor confidence.

The tax structure and details of the Customs Department should be
improved. The government should also act urgently when imported goods are
dumped and when import tariffs are raised by trading partners.

Taxes for raw materials are higher than those for finished goods. For
example for the optic-fibre industry, plastic pellets are taxed at 30%,
but finished imports are taxed at 5%.

"Thailand is the only country that imposes a tax for unprocessed
materials at a higher rate than for finished products. The procedures of
the Customs Department is more confusing and slower than those in
Malaysia which permits the imported and exported goods to pass the
Customs Department within 24 hours without any difficulties over
documentation," said Mr Sompong.

Sirikul Jongtanasarsombat, assistant vice-president of the IFCT, said
Thailand needed more engineers. Thai education did not produce workers
with appropriate skills for the jobs at hand. There was also a lack of
markets, market information, export testing centres and money needed as
capital by small firms.

Housing projects likely to increase Supalai profit

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 03 (Business Section)

Real estate firm Supalai Plc expects 40% growth in sales to more top two
billion baht this year, mainly through three housing projects.

The new projects are Supalai Grand Park at Bang Na-Trat Road, Supalai
Orchid Park 3 and Supalai Ville at Thon Buri-Pakthor Road.

"Encouraged by these projects, Supalai's sales volume this year is
expected to reach 2.65 billion baht, up 42% compared to last year's
result of only 1.9 billion baht," said president Prateep Tangmatitham.

Sales from January to September recorded 42% growth to 2.1 billion baht
over the same period last year.

Mr Prateep said Supalai's 15 projects will earn the company more than
12.6 billion baht in 1997. Under other development schemes, Supalai has
formed a joint venture with local investors in Khon Kaen and Hat Yai to
develop real estate, which it expects to earn more than 1.3 billion baht
in 1997.

The company is trying to bring its liability ratio to lower than 2.5:1
in 1997, and to below 2:1 in the next 2-3 years. To stabilise its
financial structure, Supalai requires revenue from customers as a source
of investment.

Downpayments from its 15 projects are expected to represent cash of about
500 million baht, with the last ownership transfer from 13 projects
accounting for another 1.8 billion baht cash.

Supalai has appointed Siam Commercial Bank and SCB Advisory Co to be
financial adviser and underwriter for the local issue of financial
instruments worth one billion baht.

The move is part of an effort to refinance existing debt and to cover its
additional investment fund, said Mr Prateep.

Environmental services exhibition set for June

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 03 (Business Section)

Phusadee Arunmart

Lyon, France

Thailand's largest environmental technology exhibition is scheduled for
June.

Organised by the Thai government and Blenheim Thai Exhibition Co, a
subsidiary of the London-based Blenheim Group, the Entech-Pollutec Asia
'97 show will be held on June 26-29 at the Queen Sirikit National
Convention Centre.

The exhibit will be very similar to Pollutec '96, the twelfth
international exhibition of environmental equipment, technologies, and
services, held in Lyon, France, last week. That exhibition attracted
1,700 exhibitors from 24 countries.

Blenheim Thai Exhibition managing director Steven Seet said the company
decided to host a similar exhibition in Thailand because the country is
a hub within the rapidly-growing Asean group.

"New industrial plants, infrastructure, and property development are
taking place throughout the region. Environmental protection must be
built into those developments now rather than added later," Mr Seet
explained.

He said there were substantial opportunities in Thailand for companies
marketing environmental protection products because the country is in the
midst of adopting the ISO 14000 standard. To receive that standard,
industries must produce their products in a way that is environmentally
friendly.

Thailand relies greatly on the technology and expertise of foreign firms
for its waste-water treatment, air filtering, solid waste disposal, and
hazardous-waste management needs.

He obtained a Master's degree in general administration and a doctor al
degree in administration and sociology research from Miami University in
Ohio state.

An expert in education and research, he was employed as a senior
researcher at the University of Saarland in Germany for 14 years before
joining Robinson Department Store for four years.

COTL has one other Thai director, Mr Suvit Senavatin, who is responsi ble

Call to rethink ETO monopoly: Transport agency's role at port branded
parasitic

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 12 (Business Section)

Wichit Sirithaveeporn

The Express Transport Organisation's monopoly at Bangkok Port needs
reconsideration by the cabinet, according to the Economic Stability and
Security Policy Committee.

It will put the issue to the cabinet, opposing the Transport and
Communications Ministry's endorsement of the ETO's monopoly for another
two years when the contract comes up for renewal in December.

Deputy Prime Minister Amnuay Viravan, a member of the committee, said the
cabinet had full authority to review the ministry's decision because the
ETO was under government control.

"The issue is one of revision. The committee earlier made a strong
commitment that the organisation's monopoly at Bangkok Port would not be
extended. The ministry's endorsement was given without the committee's
consent," Dr Amnuay said.

Currently, the ETO is said to account for only 25% of total trucking
transport services at the port, with 75% belonging to its
sub-contractors.

Dr Amnuay described the ETO's action as that of a parasite waiting to
suck blood from its fellow Thais, particularly exporters.

Liberalisation of the transport industry was the best way to prevent
this, he added. "It doesn't mean the government will stop the
organisation's requirement to continue its business. But the government
needs to create more open competition among operators in the field."

The ETO's board had previously agreed transport services at the port
should be opened to competition because of pressure from customers and
other truckers.

But the liberalisation plan has been delayed, with Deputy Transport and
Communications Minister Chaipak Siriwat championing efforts for the ETO
to continue its port services that provide 87.5% of its annual income
currently totalling one billion baht.

The port's long-term plan envisages ending the ETO's privileges and
encouraging more truckers to offer their services and end bribery and
other corruption allegedly fuelled by the monopoly.

Mr Chaipak's policy aims not only for the ETO's monopoly to remain, but
for it to directly handle 50% of truck services at the port.

MBK shrugs off poll worry: Services takes shape in hope of licence

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 12 (Business Section)

MBK Properties & Development Plc plans to set up a commercial bank
despite political uncertainties posed by the general election.

The group was one of the three groups short-listed by the bank selection
committee. Licences require the finance minister's approval.

Company managing director Pakong Leelawong said yesterday her group had
spent one million baht a month on hiring potential staff for the bank.

National Finance & Securities Plc chairman Banterng Tantivit will be its
chairman and Nopporn Ruangsakul, a former Thai Danu Bank executive
vice-president, will be the managing director.

The group forecasts the new bank, focusing on wholesale banking, will
break even in 5-7 years.

Mr Banterng said he was unsure whether or not the new government would
change the policy on awarding new banking licences to his group.

Mrs Pakong said her group had testified to the police about an allegation
that bribes of 750 million baht per licence were paid to the selection
committee. She stressed all three groups had rejected the claims.

Meanwhile, MBK Properties & Development Plc's one-year net profit to
September 30 was 373.14 million baht, or 2.40 baht per share, up from a
net profit of 273.92 million baht, or 1.62 per share, last year.

The firm will pay a dividend of two baht per share this year.

Mrs Prakong said her company's outstanding total assets this year were
worth 18.38 billion baht, up from 8.17 billion baht last year.

The company expects to benefit when the Mass Rapid Transit Authority's
underground railway, with a terminal near its property, is completed. It
expects its net profit to reach 608.67 million baht.

But the company's 383-room Pathum Princess Hotel in the Mah Boon Krong
centre compound is projected to lose 5.7 million baht next year before
breaking even in 1998.

Plastic club wants duty kept: Manufacturers call for help to cut costs

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 12 (Business Section)

Plastic and petrochemical manufacturers have urged the government to
scrap import tariffs cuts scheduled for January.

The Federation of Thai Industries' Plastic Industry Club has also called
for the current tariff structure to be kept for 3-5 years and for the
government to help manufacturers trim their costs so they can compete
with imports.

Club chairman Virat Kleo-patinon recently put its case to Prime Minister
Banharn Silpa-archa.

Plastics and petrochemicals were basic industries that had only just
begun in Thailand and were not strong enough to compete with imports, Mr
Virat said.

Ethylene and propylene, the industry's main feedstocks, were bought from
the National Petrochemical Corp and Thai Olefins Co at prices higher than
those of imports.

The industry also paid more for electricity than counterparts abroad and
chemical tanks and terminal charges were expensive, he said, adding there
was also the burden of high interest on loans, as well as guarantees and
tax.

Neighbours including Malaysia and Indonesia had offered their
manufacturers tax breaks and other incentives.

But Thailand had lifted its protection measures and had made it easier
to import low-priced foreign supplies, causing serious losses for local
manufacturers, Mr Virat claimed. The government had been cool on their
request for help in integrating production to cut costs, he added.

TA cordless phones can share numbers: Handsets will also work well in
vehicles

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 12 (Business Section)

Suphaphan Plengmaneepun

TelecomAsia Corp says its personal cordless telephone (PCT) service to
be introduced in the middle of next year will enable more than one person
to carry handsets with same numbers.

PCT, previously known as the personal handy phone system, can be used in
vehicles travelling at up to 60 km/h, compared with 30km/h in Japan where
the technology was developed.

TA vice-president Vallobh Vimolvanich said TA's cordless service would
enable users to apply for more extended lines or handsets.

If a family has more than two members, they can apply for extended lines
for each of them. These additional handsets will have the same home
numbers.

For incoming calls, owners can set all lines to ring simultaneously or
just a particular handset. PCT also provides call-waiting services or
conference links.

TA will seek Telephone Organisation of Thailand approval to collect the
monthly fee for extended lines. This will be 100 baht/month for the
second handset in addition to 200 baht/month for the first.

The airtime fee will be three baht for the first two minutes and 1.50
baht for each subsequent minute of each call for each handset used.

PCT will cover 1,600 sq km of Bangkok. By end of 1998, the coverage area
will extend to 4,500 sq km to take in outlying areas.

Mr Vallobh said he expected more than one million subscribers within the
first three years.

The service could be used in cars travelling at 60 km/h because the
system's cell sites were close to each other. TA would have to fix cell
sites on all 800,000 power poles of the Metropolitan Electricity
Authority to provide efficient coverage, he said.

Motorists travelling at more than 100 km/h would find cellular phones
more efficient than cordless sets, he noted.

TA and Thai Telephone and Telecommunication (TT&T) will ask the TOT to
allow them to use the same control frequency that would allow a roaming
service between the two cordless networks.

TT&T's subscribers could then use their cordless phones in Bangkok, while
Bangkok subscribers could use their sets in the provinces.

Both TA and TT&T would have to negotiate their sharing of revenue from
the roaming service, Mr Vallobh said.

TA is also negotiating to provide a cordless service for subscribers to
the TOT's 1.7 million phones in Bangkok in addition to TA's 2.6 million
lines.

TOT wants 21% of the revenue but TA considers this to high.

TA's multi-media fibre network for the 2.6 million lines in Bangkok has
the capacity to handle six million lines, Mr Vallobh said. Therefore when
new fixed-line operators wanted to share the network, they could do so
without having to pay for cables. But they would pay TA a share of the
revenue, he added.

Micro-breweries to be franchised: Boon Rawd plans 10 restaurants

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 12 (Business Section)

Boon Rawd Brewery Co is preparing to open the first of what it expects
to be 10 franchise micro-brewery restaurants, according to executive
chairman Viroj Phutrakul.

The Hartmannsdorfer Brauhaus will be located in SCB Park Plaza on
Ratchadaphisek Road, and will be operated by Pomona Trading, a joint
venture between Boon Rawd and a German partner.

"The concept of the micro-brewery is very popular in Europe and America,
and is fast catching on in Asia," said Boon Rawd chairman Piya Bhirom
Bhakdi. "Asian people are switching to drinking beer, encouraging the
micro-brewery business to grow very fast."

The Hartmannsdorfer Brauhaus has a total brewing capacity of 300,000
litres annually. The 1,500-square-metre restaurant seats 400 people.

Boon Rawd is entering the business after seeing the success of the
Paulaner Brauhaus which has two popular outlets in the Sukhumvit area.
Boon Rawd has operated the Singha Beer Haus on Asoke Road for several
years, but it has not expanded to other branches.

Pomona Trading will invest some 80 million baht in the prototype
Hartmannsdorfer outlet, named for a beer produced by a Boon Rawd-owned
brewery in Germany. After it achieves success, the franchise will be sold
under the responsibility of Boon Rawd Asia Co, within a year.

"We plan to give Hartmannsdorfer franchises to 10 franchisees, half of
which will be in Bangkok. We are hopeful of expanding our franchise
within a year after we succeed with this first restaurant," Mr Viroj
said.

The investment outlay for each Hartmannsdorfer Brauhaus will range from
30 million to 80 million baht.

Boon Rawd is also preparing to franchise the products of its German
brewery, Mittweida Lowenbrau, producer of Hartmannsdorfer and Mittweida
beers.

The first Mittweida franchise is expected to be sold to a brewery in
China. Boon Rawd also plans to open its first joint-venture brewery next
year with the Charoen Pokphand Group in China.

"Local demand for beer in Thailand is growing by more than 20% annually.
We do not have enough production capacity, so we need to find some
production bases to produce our beer to be supplied to the European and
US markets," Mr Piya said.

Thailand's total beer market is currently worth about 40 billion baht.
Boon Rawd is the market leader with more than 80% market share.

Insider: A modest beginning

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 12 (Business Section)

Given all the fuss about telecoms, one would think that the
Telecommunication Association of Thailand would have a very high profile.

Not so, says association president Sribhumi Sukhanetr. With all the
public-and private-sector players involved, the possibility of the
association taking a stand that would annoy someone is high.

Tempted as he might be to sound off, Mr Sribhumi prefers the association
to play a neutral but constructive role. If people want to call the TCT
-- the initials chosen to avoid confusion with the TAT -- a paper tiger,
he doesn't mind.

"At the moment we're concentrating on training courses and I have to
remind myself not to be critical on other issues because it would create
a problem later. The association needs cooperation from both the private
and public sectors so we don't want to have problems with any of them."

Starting on Friday, the TCT will hold a three-day seminar at Central
Plaza. The objective? To help educate the public about uses, trends and
developments in the field.

Registration is 2,200 baht for non-members and 2,000 baht for members.
Proceeds will be donated to the Royal Projects.

Insider: Tried and true

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 12 (Business Section)

For 100 years the New York Times has proclaimed itself the home of "All
the News That's Fit to Print". When it went on the World Wide Web, it
looked for a new slogan.

The newspaper held a contest that drew some 8,000 entries, including the
likes of "All the News That's Fit to Click", and "All the News That's Fit
to Print Out".

So what did the judges finally settle on? "All the News That's Fit to
Print". It has a certain ring to it.

Insider: Air scare

from BANGKOK POST, October 29, 1996, Page 12 (Business Section)

This month's Bad Taste Award goes to Ryanair, an Irish discount airline.

The offending advertisement showed a picture of a hijacked Sudan Airways
Airbus-130 on the tarmac of London's Stansted Airport, with the door open
and boarding stairs nearby, but without a passenger in sight.

"It's amazing what lengths people will go to, to fly cheaper than
Ryanair," the copy proclaimed.

The Irish Airline Pilots' Association -- and consumers -- didn't think
there was anything funny about hijacking. The ad was dropped.
