<B>Problem/Opportunity</B>
<P>
Half of the steel produced in the United States is derived from scrap.  With zinc-coated prompt scrap increasing fivefold since 1980, steelmakers are feeling the effect of increased contaminant loads on their operations.  The greatest concerns are the cost of treatment before disposal of waste dusts and the water associated with remelting zinc-coated scrap.  An economical process is needed to strip and recover the zinc from scrap to prepare it for steelmaking.
<P>
The operating-cost benefits to the steelmaking industry from such a process are estimated to be $140 million per year (compared with using non-scrap sources of iron).  Environmental compliance costs would be mitigated by about $150 million per year.  Foreign exchange could also benefit by some $130 million per year, through reductions in zinc imports.
<P>
<P>
<B>Approach</B>
<P>
Through a cost-sharing program with Metal Recovery Industries U.S., Inc., Argonne National Laboratory is developing a new technology for converting galvanized steel scrap from stamping plant wastes into clean scrap for steelmaking.  With further development, the technology could also process galvanized steel scrap from obsolete automobiles.

<B>The degalvanizing process will be tested on shredded auto scrap.  This is the largest source of ferrous scrap.</B>
</CENTER>
<P>
The process consists of dissolving the zinc coating from scrap in a hot, caustic solution and recovering the zinc from the solution electrolytically.  The zinc-bearing scrap is charged in an electrolytic cell containing a 70­90 degrees C sodium hydroxide solution.  Applying an electric potential dissolves the zinc into the hot caustic.  Clean scrap is removed, rinsed, and recycled.  The electrolyte is then pumped into a second cell, where the zinc is electrolytically removed from the solution.  The zinc can be sold to refiners for purification and resale.
<P>
<P>
<B>Results</B>
<P>
Metal Recovery Industries U.S., Inc., has installed a 50,000-ton/year pilot plant in East Chicago, Indiana.  This plant has dezinced over 1,000 tons of automotive stamping waste, and tests have demonstrated that the process can remove not only zinc, but also many plastic coatings.  Tests continue to evaluate process economics and operation.
<P>
<P>
<B>Future Plans</B>
<P>
Plans are to provide 1,500 tons of dezinced scrap for a melt test to determine the environmental impact of dezinced scrap on furnace operations.  If testing is successful, detailed engineering will begin on a 200,000-ton/year dezincing demonstration plant for late 1996.  Plants like this one could be used for future commercial operations.
