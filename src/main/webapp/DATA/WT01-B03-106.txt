<P><BR> For immediate release: 1/15/96.<BR> For additional information

<BR> January 8, 1996 Coachella, California. Tribal Leaders and gaming
professionals from as far away as Missouri, Wisconsin, and Atlantic City, NJ are
assembling this week at the Spotlight 29 Casino. Featured on the agenda of their
6 day program is training in the latest techniques of casino control and
regulation.<BR>
<BR> According to Chairman Dean Mike of the 29 Palms Band of Mission Indians,
hosts of the Academy, &quot;It's essential that tribal gaming operations
maintain the highest standards of integrity and control. That's what the
<A HREF="TGCAAcc.html">Tribal Gaming Academy</A>'s all about, and we 're proud
to be part of their program.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<A HREF="TGCAaei.html">Arthur E. Irwin</A>, President of the Academy, added
that his firm's program has two primary goals. &quot;The first is excellent
training during each day of the program. The second is to encourage a continuing
dialogue among those playing key roles in the Tribal Gaming Industry.&quot;<BR>
<BR> Irwin's firm, <A HREF="TGCA.html">Tribal Gaming Commission
Administrators, Inc. (TGCA)</A> provides consulting, training, and support
services to the tribal gaming commissions that most tribes establish to regulate
their casino operations. The Tribal Gaming Academy program is designed to
prepare tribal leaders who are newly appointed to gaming oversight positions.
<BR>
<BR> &quot;Our program&quot;, according to Irwin, &quot;focuses on a basic
understanding of tribal gaming's changing legal climate; assessing and managing
risk; understanding casino games; preventing criminal activity; and regulating,
even complex, casino operations. As time passes,&quot; adds Irwin, &quot;the
challenges of successful tribal gaming are handed to new generations of Tribal
leaders who need to quickly gain an understanding of the industry.&quot;
<BR>
<BR> TGCA has been helping with that process, as consultants, since 1993. Their
services frequently include customized training programs to Tribal Council
Members, Gaming Commission Members, and/or Gaming Compliance Officers. Most of
these programs have focused on Gaming Commissions as they were being launched.
The Academy programs will focus on newly appointed Commissioners as they prepare
to join Commissions already in operation. <BR>
<BR> &quot;Modeled after a State Police Academy that meets municipal training
needs by assembling new officers from several jurisdictions,&quot; Irwin
continues, &quot;our academy assembles Tribal Leaders from several tribal
nations for training as a group.&quot; <BR>
