<h2 align=center>A Summary of Findings  by NIH Research
Programs  in Learning Disabilities</h2>

<h3  align=center>Research Centers  Report  at  the  LDA  1996 Conference</h3>

<p><b>Barbara  McElgunn<br>
Research Committee</b>

<p>Close to 300 registrants were present on March 6th to hear from research centers supported by the 
National Institutes of Health. Lynne Cannon of the LDA Research Committee outlined the history of the 
Centers which began in the early 1980s. Through the ongoing efforts of the Research Committee, 
Congress mandated an Interagency Committee on Learning Disabilities in 1982 which included 11 federal 
agencies. Following a comprehensive review of the existing research and information on learning 
disabilities, the Interagency Committee concluded that ... <i>Collaborative, integrated and coordinated 
multi-disciplinary approaches to research questions... a classification system... delineation of 
homogeneous subgroups.... and of more precise and reliable strategies for treatment, remediation, and 
prevention...</i> were critical to the field. 

<p>Dr. Reid Lyon, Director of the Learning Disabilities Research programs at the National Institute of 
Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) outlined the research projects that began under the first 
appropriations of $7,250,000 in 1989. These were located at the University of Colorado, Yale; and at 
Johns Hopkins (Dr. Martha Denckla). These projects have expanded to five, adding Bowman Gray School 
of Medicine and Harvard/Beth Israel. The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke funds 
the Johns Hopkins program. The total expenditure this year will be $21,000.000. He noted that this has 
provided the field with 2,200 journal articles and 26 books on learning disabilities over these past years.    
Dr. Lyon explained that the decision to focus on dyslexia or reading disability was taken because this is 
the most common neurobehavioral disorder affecting children. All the Centers use common diagnostic 
criteria, and all now have an intervention research component, and noted that this is the most difficult 
type of research to do well, requiring a high degree of intensity and hard work.

<p> Dr. Shaywitz (Yale Research Center) reported that dyslexia, a disorder of the language system 
(phonological awareness) cannot be separated from reading disability and is the most common 
neurobehavioral disorder affecting children, about one child in five. Following large groups of children 
prospectively, about three-fourths have a persistent deficit, though all improve, there is still a gap. In 
random samples, nearly as many girls as boys are affected. A central issue in reading disability is 
phonological awareness-that words are composed of sounds. This must be taught to 20-30% of the 
population and is the most important predictor of reading success in children and young adults. Other 
research at Yale, using imaging techniques (functional MRI), is investigating the underlying neurobiology 
of learning disabilities, correlating brain areas with various processes in reading.

<p>Dr. John DeFries (Colorado) said that the Institute of Behavioral Genetics at Boulder began in 1973 
with a family study-followed by a twin study, still in progress. Many investigators are responsible for 
various studies under this program, which include projects on ADHD and executive function.

<p>The Colorado Reading Project found evidence of a genetic linkage to chromosome 15 in 1983 and 
more recently to chromosome 6 with five DNA markers. There is evidence for both shared and 
independent etiologies for different components of reading, e.g., visual/orthographic analysis and 
phonological awareness. There is evidence for a genetic etiology for reading disabilities from two large 
independent samples, and it is interesting that the affected region on chromosome 6 also influences the 
human immune system.

<p>Dr. Michele Mazzacco (Johns Hopkins) described four research projects at the Learning Disabilities 
Research Center at over the past seven years, designed to study specific social and academic learning 
disabilities in children with known syndromes wherein various types of learning disabilities are a part: 
neurofibromatosis, Turner's, and Fragile X.

<p>A comparative core battery of tests are conducted on all children in the program and on some family 
members. Brain imaging studies, using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), allow the identification of 
anatomical correlates of these cognitive and social deficits. Comparing the non-verbal learning disabilities 
of girls with Fragile X and Turner's syndrome allowed ways to study social learning disabilities in depth. 
The goal of these studies is to show how specific genes can impact specific aspects of the bran 
development and how these brain differences lead to different behavioral and cognitive phenotypes and 
symptoms that we need to understand in evaluating learning disabilities and their subtypes.

<p>Dr. Frank Wood (Bowman Gray) described their program, which for over seven years has been 
studying many processes that show how a dyslexic child learns to read and some important genetic 
findings from their study. The genetic and neuroimaging aspects of this project have important 
contributions for teaching approaches also. David Pauls reported on new genetic linkage studies in four 
samples of dyslexics and their families, based on four phenotypes: phonological segmentation, non-word 
reading, rapid naming, and single word reading. Phonological segmentation showed linkage to the HLA 
region of chromosome 6, very close to the Colorado findings. The region on chromosome 15, located in 
1983 by the Colorado group, was found to correspond to word identification. The component processes of 
reading may involve different genes. Dr. Wood said they can image these phenotypes and pinpoint which 
areas of the brain arc working at a specific task. Excessive activity in some areas is related to lowered task 
performance. The left thalamus, related to decoding and phonological segmentation, is underactivated in 
the dyslexics studied.

<p>All of this has meaning for intervention. They have shown that code instruction  <i>(stainless steel 
phonics approach)</i> delivered in the first and  second grades improves reading performance in the 
third and eighth grades and produces stronger outcomes in math, an active frontal-type process.

<p>Dr. Albert Galaburda (Beth Israel/ Harvard) presented a segment of their nine-year project studying 
the neurobiology of dyslexia, which is looking at mechanisms behind developmental disorders of 
language. He said that debate has occurred on whether this involves the processing of sounds (low level 
processing), or is at the cognitive level (high level processing). His lab is exploring whether both low and 
high level processing are affected by the structure of the brain and whether small malformations are 
substrates for developmental language disorders.

<p>The transfer of low to high level processing, or the reverse, is important to decoding. An early lesion 
in one area of the brain will propagate to other levels of processing at the functional and anatomical 
levels, e.g., a lesion in the thalamus will affect the frontal lobe. Abnormal neuronal migration to the 
cortex, found in nine autopsied dyslexic brains would have occurred during prenatal life and might reflect 
a genetic defect in the cellular programming of neuronal migration. Such malformations and subsequent 
changes in the sizes of neurons in the thalamus can be reproduced in animal models with subsequent 
effects on their ability to discriminate fast sounds. Other, but not all, pathways may also be   affected  by 
these changes.

<p>Dr. Lyon introduced the programs on treatment interventions as a research target. He said that 
IQ/discrepancy criteria for services are not very valid for many children with learning disabilities. This 
may not be such a refractory disorder if identified early and attention given to the nature of the treatment 
itself. Dr. Barbara Foorman of the University of Houston and Dr. Joseph Torgesen of Florida State 
University described NICHD-funded studies on the effectiveness of various interventions for reading 
disabilities.

<p>The Houston intervention research program is about halfway through a five year grant. All the studies 
involve teacher training, teacher inservice and feedback. The children are from a mix of the four main 
ethnic groups. This prevention program is designed to help kindergarten children with pre-reading 
activities using listening games, rhymes, and phonemic segmentation and transition activities for 20 
minutes a day. Analysis showed mid-year benefits from this program when compared to a matched control 
group in another school.

<p>The second program involves 114 children in the first and second grades who are poor readers and 
compares different types of instructional interventions used in a resource room program for one and a half 
to two hours a day.

<p>The third study involved designing a program and developing materials for a large school district that 
was moving from a whole language approach to reading to a phonics-based approach.    

<p>Dr. Torgesen described two interdisciplinary projects of prevention and intervention. Four 
assumptions were used to guide this program: phonologically based reading disabilities are common; 
approaches must be affective in word-reading ability; the importance of letter-sound correspondences in 
deciphering the code; a method of stimulating phonological awareness must be included. 

<p>One longitudinal study compared 1500 children, screened in kindergarten for poor phonological 
awareness and assigned to three different treatment groups, with a control group. All experimental groups 
showed good gains by mid-second grade and one group was above average in some reading skills. Other 
research from this program at Florida State University is investigating whether intensive interventions 
make a difference for the poorest ten year old readers.

<p>At the end of the day, members of the LDA research committee remarked that these research 
programs are providing valuable information for parents, teachers, and policy makers and scientific 
evidence for the possible etiologies and mechanisms of this real and most prevalent syndrome. The work 
on treatment, interventions, and in studying known genetic syndromes that involve social and cognitive 
learning disabilities will add to progress in this large and complicated field. This is a summary
