<IMG SRC="http://www.rixan.com/mitsicon.gif" WIDTH=18 HEIGHT=18> <STRONG><FONT SIZE=+1> High Speed and High Precision</FONT></STRONG><P>
Movemaster represents a major improvement in performance over conventional industrial robots, boasting a maximum resultant speed of 3500mm/sec and a position repeatability of +/-0.04mm. That means Movemastercan handle a wide range of real-world industrial applications. What's more, trajectory accuracy which is essential for jobs such as sealing, has been improved 2 to 3 times through the use of 32-bit microprocessor and a high-performance servo-amplifier.<P>

Movemaster uses AC servo-motors, thus eliminating the troublesome chore of replacing brushes which is the case with DC motors. Maintenance has also been simplified and reliability improved through the use of dust-proof oil seals and grease nipples for all joints.<P>

<A NAME="Easy"></A>

Movemaster uses an absolute encoder, which eliminates the need to return to the origin when power is turned on. This also solves the problem of interface by peripheral devices during origin setting, and contact by the robot arm hand attachment with the body of the robot. Thus, the robot can be used as soon as it is turned on. In addition, Movemaster is equipped with a teaching box complete with LCD display. That means it can be operated not only by using programs input from a personal computer, but also by a means of a teaching playback method, allowing programs to be created at the work site.<P>

<A NAME="Attractive"></A>
<IMG SRC="http://www.rixan.com/mitsicon.gif" WIDTH=18 HEIGHT=18> <FONT SIZE=+1><STRONG> Attractive Designs and Safe Operation</STRONG></FONT><P>
Movemaster robots have a pleasant design and color which allows them to smoothly integrate into the work place. And because all wiring and piping has been installed inside the robots, they have a simple external form with no protruding parts. Movemaster robots are also equipped with various protection functions that ensure worry-free operation.<P>
