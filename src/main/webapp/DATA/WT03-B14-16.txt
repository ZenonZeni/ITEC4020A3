SAN DIEGO DEFERS VOTE ON PACIFIC BELL PCS DEPLOYMENT AFTER
OPPOSITION

     Pacific Bell suffered one-month setback last week in deploying
digital PCS network in San Diego, in time for Republican National
Convention Aug. 12-14, when City Council deferred action on
approving permits for antenna sites.  Council's 8-1 vote Feb. 12
came after sometimes heated meeting at which opponents of Global
System for Mobile Communications (GSM) technology argued that
interference with hearing aids, pacemakers, wheelchairs and
electronic braking systems required city to study issue further
before voting.  City Attorney John Witt told Council in letter that
new Telecom Act restricts local govt. role in determining siting of
radio antennas.  Next meeting is March 19.

     PB blamed setback on "well-orchestrated" campaign by
D.C.-based Wireless Communications Council, headed by Hear-It-Now's
James Valentine, which opposes wide deployment of GSM technology. 
"We're disappointed by the Council vote," PB spokesman Lou Saviano
told us.  City Planning Commission earlier had approved PB's
request, but opponents appealed decision to full Council, which
heard testimony but deferred action.  He said city lawyers advised
Council that new Telecom Act supersedes local authority over such
issues in deploying national PCS system.

     Witt told us Sec. 704 of Telecom Act bans local govt. role in
regulating "placement, construction and modification" of PCS
facilities for frequency emissions, provided equipment complies
with FCC rules.  Lawyers for Council challenged legal opinion, and
law office is continuing to research laws, Witt said.

     PB officials said one-month delay in winning approvals won't
derail plans for network deployment, which includes 12 antenna
sites in city to handle phone calls during convention.  PB paid
$695 million for L.A. and San Francisco licenses and is building
network for Cal., most of Nev. and portion of Ariz.  Company plans
rollout of rest of network by year-end.

     Opponents of GSM technology, operating as Cal. Communications
Council and funded by D.C. group, urged City Council to investigate
technology before approving application.  Saviano described
opposition as "well orchestrated" and said company tried to offset
campaign with "facts and figures" about technology.  Advisory
Commission for Persons with Disabilities in Santa Clara County
wrote letter saying GSM phones create interference with assisted
listening devices (ALDs) in public buildings, and use of phones
could deny ALD users access to services.  Council sought
environmental impact report study as "only way" to resolve dispute
and "protect health and safety."

     In related development, Cal. State Architect Div. access
compliance unit issued letter saying it was preparing statewide
policy to address hearing aid interference.  Michael Mankin, assoc.
architect, said in letter to City Manager Regina Williams: 
"[Agency] suggests, if possible, that you consider this concern
when making any decision on the deployment of PCS 1900/GSM
telephones because they undermined the assistive listening devices
required in assembly occupancies in the State Building Code." 
Mankin said office is working with hearing-impaired community to
develop policy.

     PB plans to open San Diego network ahead of rest of state to
provide wireless services during political convention, even though
most delegates, candidates and media won't have equipment.  Some
from D.C. could use Sprint Spectrum telephones because GSM system
has been operating here since last year.  Phone can make all long
distance calls but won't operate outside 1.9 GHz territory.

AMERITECH, BELL ATLANTIC, SBC LAUNCH OUT-OF-REGION LONG DISTANCE
DRIVE

     Bell Atlantic (BA) and SBC Communications jumped quickly into
out-of-region long distance service last week, filing applications
in 18 states and D.C. to resell services under brand name.  At same
time, Ameritech unveiled aggressive plans for in-region long
distance and signed agreement with WorldTel to carry long distance
calls to cities outside region.  RHCs were first to enter
out-region business, with other companies expected to disclose
plans soon.  IXCs also began seeking state approval to deliver
local services.

     BA became first RHC to seek long distance authority outside
territory, filing applications Feb. 13 in Fla., Ill., N.C., S.C.
and Tex. just 3 days after Telecom Act freed RHCs to operate in new
regions.  SBC followed 2 days later with more extensive filing in
16 states and D.C., and in twist said it will use already
established Cellular One wireless brand name as vehicle for selling
wireline services to existing and new customers.  BA and SBC filed
separate applications in Ill., and SBC plans include many states in
BA's territory.

     BA Communications Pres. Al Binford said 5 states represented
prime opportunities for company as it begins building nationwide
service.  It could be offered on resale basis by end of 2nd
quarter, he said.  "These states are important states," he told us. 
BA plans to seek resale agreements with facilities-based carriers
in 5 states after winning state approval, Binford said.  Other RHCs
haven't indicated plans for filing in states.

     Company pledged last week to move quickly on state front,
saying it would submit applications within 5 days to provide
service in 5 states unidentified until Tues.  Binford said each
state represented significant opportunity for BA to provide service
for its existing customers, such as travelers to Disney World in
Fla.  Proximity of Carolinas to BA's territory, coupled with
existing cellular interests in those 2 states, will enhance BA
brand name in region, he said.  BA also is part of PCS partnership
that has licenses in Tex. and Ill. in addition to other markets.

     Eventually, company plans to have nationwide presence aiming
at targeted audiences rather than all customers, using mix of
advertising, including newspapers, Binford said.  He said first 5
states were "attractive," with large amounts of long distance
calling already in place.  He didn't provide details on timetable
for introducing service in other states.

     BellSouth (BS), which provides service in 3 of 5 states,
welcomed potential competition from neighboring company, saying BA
choice demonstrated "attractive" nature of Southeast for business. 
"We anticipate and expect to have a number of competitors in all
our markets," spokesman Tim Klein said.  BS has strategy for
meeting competition, he said, and has developed "very aggressive"
plan to meet checklist conditions for providing long distance
service in its own 7-state territory.  He said company expects to
meet checklist targets first in Fla., entering market as early as
year-end or early 1997.

     BA has said it expects to seek FCC and state approvals to
offer long distance service in its own territory as soon as rules
are established.  Its quick response to Telecom Act signals its
intention to provide long distance services quickly outside region
while concentrating on in-region checklist, officials said.  Other
RHCs have sketched out brief details of service offerings, most
beginning by providing long distance to cellular customers. 
Ameritech unveiled plans for in-region service but will carry
out-of-region calls through LDDS WorldCom.

          SBC Uses Cellular One Brand for Long Distance

     SBC Communications said it expected applications to be filed
by early this week, with regulatory approvals in 2-3 months. 
States generally are in Northeast and Upper Midwest, with further
plans still undisclosed, official said.  SBC plan relies on brand
name recognition of Cellular One, which has been in existence in
some states for decade.  SBC official said market had sufficient
room for numerous competitors.

     SBC targeted BA territory of Del., D.C., Md., Va. and W.Va.
and plans to seek approval in Conn., Ill., Ind., La., Me., Mass.,
Miss., N.H., N.Y., R.I. and Vt.  "We're building on our out-region
base," Chmn.-CEO Edward Whitacre said.  States either are adjacent
to SBC's 5-state territory or to Cellular One network.  Official
said company has tested Cellular One brand recognition and doesn't
expect obstacles in offering wireline services.  In competition
with BA, SBC official said Cellular One brand has high name
recognition in all 16 states and BA lacks presence or name
recognition in at least 3 of its 5 launch states.  Spokesman Dave
Senay said:  "Competition will be nothing new for SBC or Bell
Atlantic."  In Md., for example, Cellular One and Bell Atlantic
Nynex Mobile are 2 cellular providers.

     SBC began offering long distance to cellular customers on
Cellular One and Southwestern Bell Mobile Systems (SBMS) as soon as
President Clinton signed Telecom Act.  Stanley Sigman, pres.-CEO of
SBMS unit that oversees Cellular One, said company expects
customers to select one company for local, cellular and long
distance.  "We'll build on the customer relationships and brand
recognition that characterize Cellular One," he said.  Goal is to
provide bundled services for all customers.

     In separate announcement, Teleport Communications Group (TCG)
unveiled plans for its Md. operation, saying it will invest $20
million in Baltimore by year-end, with $100 million more in next
several years.  TCG Md. Pres. Larry Bugden said company will add
200 employees to Baltimore operation, with 500 jobs created over
next 5 years by company or subcontractors.  "This is a best step
for us in the Baltimore market," he said.  "We can now capitalize
on the technological capability we already have in place."

                    IXCs Begin Local Filings

     LCI International and AT&T filed at Fla. PSC to provide local
service.  LCI already has approvals from Ill., N.Y., Tex.  It said
applications also are pending in Cal., Md., Mich.  Douglas Kinkoph,
PSC dir.-regulatory affairs, said Fla. is one of several states
"ripe" for entry because of promising markets and favorable
regulations.  AT&T said it would provide service for business and
residential customers in state, depending on negotiations with LECs
there, including BellSouth, GTE, Sprint/United Telephone.  AT&T
disclosed plans to begin offering service by resale agreements with
incumbent carriers, although Chmn.-CEO Robert Allen said company
could build own facilities in some areas.

                 Ameritech Targets In-State Goal

     Ameritech expects to offer in-region landline long distance in
9 to 13 months, with strongest start in Ill. and Mich., CEO Richard
Notebaert said.  Statement came in news conference unveiling long
distance cellular service, to be offered over long distance network
that company has built throughout its 5-state region, he said. 
Ameritech wouldn't provide details on cost of digital, fiber SONET
network or its capacity, but Notebaert said it would be enough for
cellular service.

     Efforts have focused in Chicago and Grand Rapids because
that's where Ameritech had Justice Dept. (DoJ) waiver to offer long
distance service, company said.  But landline service in all its
region will be available in at most 13 months, pending regulatory
approvals, Ameritech said.  Notebaert said adding long distance
capability to local network was not "significant" cost. 
Announcement also marked another plum for LDDS WorldCom, which will
provide out-of-region long distance service for Ameritech
customers, companies said.

     Notebaert declined to reveal how much of long distance market
Ameritech hopes to get.  Company spent much of news conference
touting cellular long distance, saying it would be priced at 16-24
cents per min., 10-35% less than long distance carriers.  Ameritech
said it had signed up 126,000 cellular customers in 36 hours since
service began.

TOP 10 OUTCOMES OF TELECOM ACT

     List prepared by consulting firm A.T. Kearney envisions more
RHC acquisitions and entertainment-telecom conglomerates as result
of Telecom Act.  According to Kearney, new law will:

 1. Force consolidations among interexchange carriers and RHCs.

 2. Give wireless carriers competitive advantage over wireline
carriers.

 3. Push state regulators to open local loop to competition.

 4. Open debate on definition of universal service, including
access to information services.

 5. Turn state regulators into implementers of federal policy.

 6. Postpone rate relief for cable systems until 1999, making cable
"vulnerable" to competitors.

 7. Enhance power of broadcast networks by increasing
cross-ownership opportunities.

 8. Set stage for TV licensees to acquire advanced TV spectrum.

 9. Foster growth of Internet.

10. Pave way for few $100-billion conglomerates to dominate world
market in communications, information, entertainment.

COURT TEMPORARILY BARS ENFORCEMENT OF TELECOM ACT'S INDECENCY LAW

     Despite Justice Dept.'s defense of new law, federal judge in
Philadelphia issued temporary restraining order Feb. 15 barring
govt. from enforcing controversial Internet indecency provision of
Telecom Act while case is before court.  Provision, known as
Communications Decency Act (CDA), prohibits making indecent
material available to minors over Internet.  ACLU and 19 other
groups have challenged provision on basis that law is too broad and
will chill speech on Internet.

     U.S. Dist. Judge Ronald Buckwalter appeared to endorse points
made by both sides in memo accompanying his order.  Buckwalter said
Congress has "compelling interest" in protecting minors and "at
least from the evidence before me, plaintiffs have not convinced me
that Congress has failed to narrowly tailor the CDA."  However, he
also said ACLU and others raised "serious, substantial, difficult
and doubtful questions" about whether CDA's use of word "indecent"
is "unconstitutionally vague."

     Buckwalter issued order several hours after DoJ filed brief
telling court there's no need for such action.  In 60-page brief,
Justice said that ACLU and 19 co-plaintiffs haven't met
extraordinary burdens necessary to block enforcement of new law. 
Buckwalter's decision clears way for 3-judge federal panel --
composed of Buckwalter, Dist. Judge Stuart Dalzell and Dolores
Sloviter, chief judge of 3rd U.S. Appeals Court, Philadelphia -- to
consider merits of CDA.

     In related activity, Sen. Leahy (D-Vt.) said that he has
private support of senators for repeal of law, but that chances are
public support won't materialize.  And 6th U.S. Appeals Court,
Cincinnati, upheld conviction of operators of pornographic computer
bulletin board operator in Cal. under Tenn. community standards,
where material from board was downloaded.

                 DoJ Questions ACLU Conclusions

     Justice brief frequently focused on argument that ACLU hadn't
met burden of proof at this stage of case, saying that conclusions
brought by challengers to law haven't been proved sufficiently to
warrant declaring law unconstitutional and because there's no proof
of irreparable injury should law be allowed to take effect.  DoJ
said:  "Plaintiffs fail to show a realistic threat of suppression
of their speech."  Claims that free speech on Internet would be
hurt by new law are "wholly speculative," DoJ said, contending that
ACLU based claims of harm on nothing more than "their own academic
reading of the statute."  Justice said there was ample evidence of
pornographic material on Internet and amount is growing, "far
exceeding anything available prior to the advent of on-line
computer services."  It was concern over that availability that led
to passage of law, Justice contended.

     ACLU argument that indecency portions of law are too vague fly
in face of several years of court decisions, Justice said, noting
that cases involving broadcast language and dial-a-porn touched on
many of same topics.  Congress in passing law "neither purported to
ban, nor effectively ban, on-line indecency in all its various
forms," as ACLU contended, DoJ said.  "Those who create or 'post'
indecent images or texts in cyberspace are on notice that they are
free to do so, so long as they have taken reasonable and
appropriate measures to block access to children effectively." 

     DoJ concluded that Congress knew what it was doing when it
passed Telecom Act, based on extensive record including floor
speeches and hearings.  But one senator, Leahy, said at Washington
news conference same day that many in Congress don't understand
technology.  He was pessimistic that legislation (S-1567) he
introduced with Sen. Feingold (D-Wis.) would get very far.  While
senators privately agree with him on merits of repeal, they're
afraid of 30-sec. attack ads portraying them as proponents of
pornography, Leahy said, adding that he was worried lawmakers are
afraid to stand up for First Amendment.  Leahy said "chilling
effect" on Internet speech already has emerged, citing case of
America Online, which threw off its system Vt. subscriber for using
word "breast."  She was discussing her cancer, Leahy said. 
Americans shouldn't be too quick to criticize Chinese for their
attempts to censor Internet, he said, because much same thing is
happening here.

     Meanwhile, in separate case with similar implications, 6th
U.S. Appeals Court, Cincinnati, upheld conviction of operators of
Cal.-based Amateur Action Bulletin Board.  That case dealt with
obscenity, which is illegal, as opposed to indecent material, on
which there's great difference of opinion.  Attorneys for Robert
and Carleen Thomas argued that community standards for obscenity in
Cal. were different from those in Tenn., where postal inspector
downloaded material from Thomas's service.  Thomases were convicted
2 years ago in U.S. Dist. Court, Memphis, of violating obscenity
statutes.

FCC PROPOSES RULES FOR RHCs OFFERING OUT-OF-REGION TOLL SERVICE

     In most significant response so far to Telecom Act, FCC opened
rulemaking Feb. 14 that proposes giving nondominant regulatory
status to RHC affiliates offering out-of-region long distance
service.  As nondominant carriers, RHC affiliates could begin
offering service almost immediately upon filing their tariffs. 
Commission also proposed that if RHCs offer such out-of-region
service directly, rather than through affiliates, they should be
regulated as dominant carriers.

     To be classified as nondominant, RHC affiliate would have to
meet separation conditions outlined in 1985 Competitive Carrier
Order.  Affiliate would have to:  (1) Maintain separate accounting
books.  (2) Have no joint ownership of transmission or switching
facilities with RHC's LEC.  (3) Obtain all RHC exchange company
services at tariffed rates and conditions.  FCC noted that
independent LECs are classified as nondominant in long distance
market and operate under same rules.

     Commission asked for comments on tentative conclusion and said
parties that disagree with plan should offer alternative regulatory
policies.  Action is required by fact that Telecom Act eliminates
MFJ ban on telcos' offering interLATA service.  Nondominant
classification is given to carriers that don't have enough market
power to engage in anticompetitive conduct.

     In notice of proposed rulemaking, Commission said it wants to
"permit efficient and rapid entry" by RHCs but at same time "we
also seek to ensure that sufficient regulatory safeguards are in
place to prevent a BOC from gaining any unfair competitive
advantage."

     Nynex praised FCC plan, Federal Regulatory Affairs Vp Don
Evans saying action "brings Nynex one step closer to offering long
distance telephone users greater choice."

IXCs TO SEEK NICHES AS THEY PREPARE FOR LOCAL, BUNDLED SERVICES
BATTLE

     Second-tier IXCs, like Big 3 counterparts, will accelerate
offerings of local and bundled services as result of passage of
Telecom Act, they said last week.  LDDS WorldCom and Frontier,
which rank 4th and 5th among IXCs, said they will target largest
business customers, taking on RHCs, AT&T, MCI and Sprint in short
run.  No. 6 LCI International said it will seek broader market,
including residential, small, medium and large businesses.  Cable
& Wireless targeted 2,000 companies ranked below Fortune 500.  All
said they are interested in offering full range of telecom services
and at this stage won't rule out any service or market.

     With own fiber network, LDDS WorldCom will aim for customers
doing at least $500 per month in business, spokesman Gil Broyles
said, and existing customer base will be important.  LDDS filed in
Ill., Mich. and Tex. to enter local market, but he wouldn't
identify first launch state.  He said important factor will be how
LECs set rates for resale capacity.  It also will look at how
states set guidelines to create attractive rates, spokesman said. 
"That's the kind of the next thing that needs to be done," Broyles
said.  LDDS is providing interLATA service for resale to
Southwestern Bell Mobile Systems, Ameritech, GTE.  Talks are
"continuing" with another unidentified LEC, he said.

     Frontier, with $2.1 billion in 1995 revenue, will compete
"door-to-door" with Big 3 to offer bundled services to Fortune 500
companies, Vp John Purcell said.  "We've got real blood to show"
for combat already, he said.  Frontier jumped to No. 5 ranking
after buying ALC last year and combined companies provide long
distance, local and wireless services to more than 2 million
customers.  Purcell said Telecom Act's requirement for LECs to show
competition before entering long distance created incentive for
Nynex to negotiate favorable rates with Frontier on bundling
services.  He declined to specify where Frontier's next local
services might appear.  However, among 120 sales offices in U.S.,
2/3 are in "opportune" markets for bundled offerings, Purcell said,
and about 40 offices are in regions with regulatory barriers.

     LCI International is likely to pursue broader market,
including residential and business customers of all kinds, and
improve on its $693 million annual revenue, Regulatory Affairs Dir.
Douglas Kinkoph said.  LCI's 200% growth in residential revenue
prompted interest in developing market, he said.  LCI's long
distance marketing, based on what he said were "simple, fair and
inexpensive" services, will be thrust of local offerings, he said. 
LCI now offers flat-rate calling plans and 6-sec. billing option,
unlike competitors, Kinkoph said.  Unlike AT&T, LCI doesn't foresee
building its own facilities to provide local service, he said.

     LCI provides Bell Atlantic Nynex Mobile with long distance
service that regional cellular carrier resells to its 3 million
customers.  LCI currently doesn't offer any form of local service,
Kinkoph said.  "No state today is ready to accept local service." 
Spokeswoman Gerry Simone said company is eager for states to set
discount rates.  "Until we know what our price is, we don't know
what our products will be," she said.  In anticipation of state
action, LCI filed at Fla. PSC Feb. 15 to provide local service. 
Kinkoph said Fla. is one of several states "ripe" for entry,
regardless of Telecom Act, because of promising markets and
favorable local regulations.  However, Simone said, should pricing
prove unsatisfactory, LCI also sees options, such as cable, that
could preclude entry into local voice services.  LCI has approvals
from Ill., N.Y. and Tex., with applications pending in Cal., Md.,
Mich.

     Cable & Wireless (C&W) will carve niche by offering bundled
services to 2,000 companies ranked below Fortune 500, company said. 
C&W has approvals from Conn. and N.Y. and has filed applications in
Cal., Ill. and Tex. to provide local service, company said. 
Official offered rankings for C&W's best opportunities:  (1) N.Y. 
(2) Conn.  (3) Cal., Ill., Tex. tied.  Company launched UniLink
bundled local-long distance in N.Y.C. area.  Official said company
targeted Conn. for greatest investment to offer local services to
businesses.  Conn. PSC recently set Southern New England Telephone
(SNET) resale discounts at 20%-50%, which official said will
trigger aggressive competition.  State granted C&W LEC status,
making company first IXC to buy from SNET.  In Tex., C&W will limit
its resale relationship with Southwestern Bell, citing
dissatisfaction with discount rates and "not very attractive"
economics, official said.

RHCs EXPECTED TO DELAY IN-REGION LONG DISTANCE UNTIL FCC FINISHES
CHECKLIST

     FCC Chmn. Hundt said talks with RHC executives indicate they
won't apply for in-region long distance service until Commission
finishes writing rules for checklist that RHCs must pass, process
that could take about 180 days.  He made comment at Feb. 12 news
conference at which FCC released "task list" of 80 rulemakings
required by Telecom Act of 1996 (see pullout feature in this
issue).  List outlines which bureaus will handle various items and
what deadlines they face, most of them in 1996.  Hundt said
Commission hopes to beat deadlines wherever possible.

     Hundt said FCC is excited about opportunities presented by
Act:  "All along we've wanted the chance to write rules that go to
a competitive market.  Our reach for competition no longer exceeds
our grasp."  Move toward competition means that "in the
communications sector, the era of big government is over," he said. 
Two key goals, he said, are to promote competition rather than
individual competitors and to protect "the public interest
forever."

     Asked how FCC will get work done without budget increase it
had sought, Hundt said it will continue urging Hill to provide more
money but "at the same time, we're hitting the ground running." 
Asked how Commission will get routine work done while it
concentrates on implementation, he said "one answer is, don't try
to do everything the same old way.  We're going to need ideas."

     FCC Wireless Bureau met with industry and public interest
representatives day later to discuss ways to make filing processes
more efficient in light of tight deadlines.  Bureau asked parties
to submit short filings, not seek unnecessary meetings and focus on
proceedings with most immediate deadlines, rather than submitting
information for proceedings that are farther down road.  "Don't
give us the rhetoric and don't paper us to death," FCC Chief of
Staff Blair Levin said.  Industry also can help by developing data
that agency needs to make decisions, bureau staffers said.  Bureau
Chief Michele Farquhar said Bureau in turn will help public by
using new home page on Internet for updates on progress.

     Hundt said other bureaus may hold similar meetings, and
Commission also is considering actions such as page limitations,
open forums where agency staff can question parties more directly,
joint filings when several parties have same view.  As expected,
open video systems proceeding has been moved to Cable Bureau from
Common Carrier Bureau to spread workload.  "Our intent is to have
all the bureaus challenged but not overwhelmed," Hundt said.

     Meanwhile, FCC has received first filing under new Act --
application by CSW Communications, affiliate of utility company
Central & South West Corp., to be classified as "exempt
telecommunications company."  Classification would mean it's bona
fide communications company and thus exempt from Public Utility
Holding Company Act restrictions on offering telecom services. 
Office of Gen. Counsel has 60 days to make determination.

JUSTICE DEPT. SAYS TELCO-CABLE BAN CASE IS MOOT BECAUSE OF TELECOM
ACT

     Passage of Telecom Act makes moot U.S. Supreme Court case
testing constitutionality of telco-cable cross-ownership ban, U.S.
Justice Dept. said in court filing.  However, Bell Atlantic (BA)
argued that case isn't moot because, despite legislation, ban
remains in effect for at least 6 months while FCC sets rules for
telco entry into cable.

     Telecom Act means there's no limit on telcos' building cable
systems in their service areas, Justice Dept. said, although it
acknowledged that Act includes some restrictions such as 10%
maximum ownership of incumbent cable operators.  However, Justice
said limits in Act aren't before Court and haven't been tried at
lower levels, so Supreme Court shouldn't consider them, and
cross-ownership case remains moot.  Brief urged court to vacate
U.S. Appeals Court, Alexandria, Va., decision and order lower court
to dismiss case.

     "Sweeping" Telecom Act means that, "at a minimum, the
legislation has been sufficiently altered so as to present a
substantially different controversy than the one the lower courts
originally decided," Justice said.  "Even if the new legislation
does burden the LECs operating open video systems to a modest
degree... it surely does not burden them in the same fundamental
way" as was argued in appeal and "it would not be appropriate for
this court... to review the constitutionality of the new law, which
has not been the subject of briefing and argument."

     Telecom Act "does not moot this case," BA contended, because
it "substitutes new provisions that keep in place, for at least 6
months, the prohibition on a telephone company's provision of video
programming."  It said Act allows telco open video systems only if
they comply with FCC rules, and "no such rules exist today."  Act
gives FCC 6 months to establish rules and BA said "absence of
regulations in the interim translates into a continuation of the
flat prohibition on speech."

     "Far from mooting the controversy, the Act perpetuates the
controversy," BA said.  "It does no more than require the FCC, at
some point in the future, to take regulatory action that might then
moot this case."  Prolonging ban "will produce irreparable injury"
to telcos, BA said, and there's no major burden on Supreme Court to
issue decision, since case has been briefed, argued and Court has
deliberated on it.

     World of "fierce" competition coupled with reduced govt.

     World of "fierce" competition coupled with reduced govt.
regulation will result from Telecom Act, FCC Comr. Chong said in
speech to FCBA Midwest Chapter Feb. 15 in Chicago.  New law will
let FCC "sweep away regulatory underbrush," she said, noting that
Commission has been "trying to regulate in a Star Trek era, saddled
with Gunsmoke-style regulations."  She predicted that consumers
would have "choices galore":  "Every home, business, school,
library and health care facility will have access to multiple
communications providers, at reasonable prices."  Providers may be
wired, wireless, maybe both, she said:  "Providers will not fit
neatly into traditional categories... Instead, they will likely
evolve into full-service communications companies, offering
consumers a tempting smorgasbord of services."

from tariff-filing requirements for nondominant carriers, saying
such action is "explicitly authorized" by Telecom Act.  Hyperion is
competitive access provider.  Company noted that Commission had
instituted such policy several years ago but it was thrown out in
1994 by U.S. Supreme Court ruling on AT&T challenge.  Court had
said FCC didn't have enough authority to forbear on requiring
tariff filings.  Hyperion said Telecom Act now gives FCC that
authority.

that already have been rejected, Commission said.  In past, agency
merely has issued warnings against such filings.  Now, it said,
"all bureaus and offices are encouraged to fully utilize" power to
punish violators, including fines and authority to strike such
pleadings.  Also, said Commission, bureaus "are encouraged to refer
under seal" to gen. counsel names of attorneys making frivolous
pleadings for appropriate action, which could include censure,
suspension or disbarment.

     FCC gave Ameritech access charge flexibility in Chicago and

     FCC gave Ameritech access charge flexibility in Chicago and
Grand Rapids LATAs similar to that approved for Nynex last year. 
Ameritech sought waivers as part of its Customers First plan. 
Waivers will allow company to:  (1) Bulk-bill portions of its
access charges rather than bill on per-min. basis.  (2)
Geographically deaverage one type of access charge called transport
interconnection charge (TIC).  FCC said Ameritech can reduce TIC in
competitive areas but can't raise it in other areas to compensate. 
Actions are expected to result in overall reduction of Ameritech
access charges, possibly in neighborhood of "tens of millions of
dollars," FCC staff member said.  Commission stopped short of
granting full pricing flexibility sought by Ameritech, saying it
would address that issue in future order.  Although action is aimed
at giving Ameritech more flexibility when it faces competition,
rivals say it's premature.  Heather Gold, exec. dir. of Assn. for
Local Telecommunications Services (ALTS), said she's "outraged" by
decision because it lets Ameritech undercut competitors.  She said
that, while Grand Rapids LATA covers about 25% of Mich., Ameritech
could lower access rates selectively only in metropolitan Grand
Rapids, where there's competition from Brooks Fiber.  Action "sets
a bad precedent by inhibiting competition just one week after the
signing of a bill which has the purpose of encouraging
competition," Gold said.  FCC Comr. Barrett said in separate
statement that while he supports decision, action emphasizes need
for comprehensive access charge reform.

     U.S. Dist. Judge Harold Greene, in what could be his last

     U.S. Dist. Judge Harold Greene, in what could be his last
action dealing with AT&T breakup, said in order issued Feb. 8 that
he was "pleased that Congress and the President have now agreed to
set policy for the telecommunications industry."  He said that will
"relieve this court of its stewardship of that industry [telephone
segment of telecom] which, in a sense, it had exercised since
competition was introduced by the judicially ordered breakup of
AT&T."  But Greene said in brief order that his relief "is
mitigated only by a single concern:  That under the bill just
enacted it could turn out that sufficient safeguards do not exist
to prevent domination in the future of the vital information
industry by a few large providers."  He said that if that were to
come about through mergers, acquisitions or other deals, it not
only would have detrimental effect on consumers but also could
"enable a few giant companies (or perhaps even individuals) to
dominate what is rapidly becoming the central factor of American
life -- the control of the dissemination of information in its many
forms."  "Evils of monopoly would be magnified by domination of the
key information industry by one or a few corporations," he said. 
However, he added:  "These problems are now for the Congress and
for another day."  He said he "gladly relinquishes the
responsibility [he] has exercised for the past 15 years over the
telephone segment of the provision of information in the United
States."  He said any parties with motions before court had 20 days
to file papers on whether relief sought in those motions still
could be granted as result of new law.

     Telecom Act will return nation to days when consumer had same

     Telecom Act will return nation to days when consumer had same
carrier for local and long distance service, only difference being
that they now will have choice as to who that provider is, said
panelists at Center for Strategic & International Studies (CSIS)
roundtable last week.  They said more deals like one recently
floated by AT&T and MCI can be expected because "everybody is
talking to everybody else."  AT&T Vp Michael Brown said
re-integration of local and long distance providers is
"inevitable," and long distance companies will have some advantages
such as experience in competitive and international markets, and
high name recognition.  However, he said, RHCs also have facilities
and high name recognition in their markets, and can control resale
prices.  Former FCC Chmn. Richard Wiley noted that RHCs have state
and local competition checklists to pass before they can move
forward, while long distance companies have no such requirement. 
Nynex Vp Jeff Ward said there will be 3-4 facilities-based carriers
per major market plus various value-added service providers.  LCI
International CEO Brian Thompson said RHCs may be challenged if
they seek to enter long distance markets via existing cellular
operations without meeting effective-competition standards.  He
also said that for competition to flourish, facilities of local
providers should be made available to resellers on reasonable
terms.  Ward said his company is positioning itself to be
"carriers' carrier" in approaching new telecom environment. 
Viacom's Ellen Schned said new law will have positive impact on
program distribution business because it will increase number of
distributors.  Without programming, she said, "a wire is just a
wire" and inclusion of more players like telcos will mean "more
eyeballs" that can see company's programs.

     MCI and AT&T have opened talks on possible joint business

     MCI and AT&T have opened talks on possible joint business
ventures, especially building local phone networks but possibly
covering other activities.  MCI cited AT&T's breakup into separate
service and equipment units and new Telecom Act of 1996 as
catalysts for talks between No. 1 and No. 2 IXCs.  MCI officials
were reluctant to offer details on discussions and AT&T declined to
comment on speculation.  "We're going to discuss a lot of things
with a lot of people," MCI official said.  Officials hinted talks
might take weeks or months to reach satisfactory conclusion for
either company.  MCI challenge to AT&T's monopoly in April 1974 led
to Bell System divestiture.  MCI said discussions, in earliest
stages, could include equipment purchases from new Lucent
Technologies company being formed from AT&T's old Network Systems
unit.  MCI-AT&T linkup also could be strategy to force RHCs to
offer improved discounts on resale rates, said William Giak,
national product dir., telecom and electric service, Deloitte &
Touche consulting.  "These [AT&T-MCI] negotiations would add a
dimension of pressure" in talks with RHCs, he said.

     U.S. Supreme Court decision on indecency on cable access

     U.S. Supreme Court decision on indecency on cable access
channels could have significant impact on legality of Telecom Act
provision allowing on-line service providers to limit indecency on
their services, Alliance for Community Media (ACM) said.  Oral
argument on case is set for Feb. 21.  Court decision, due in June,
is expected to hinge on whether federal rules allowing, rather than
requiring, private companies to limit indecency constitute "state
action" subject to strict First Amendment scrutiny.  In cable case,
ACM argued that such provisions actively encouraged private
companies to limit speech, so rules faced tough First Amendment
limits.  If court agrees, ACM Exec. Dir. Barry Forbes said, same
argument may be applied to on-line indecency provision.  "Anyone
who cares about the fundamental American right to free speech
should be watching closely the outcome of Alliance vs. FCC," Forbes
said.

     U S West is claiming 30% market share for its TeleChoice cable

     U S West is claiming 30% market share for its TeleChoice cable
testbed in Omaha after only 4 months, it said in quarterly
financial report.  RHC said it isn't claiming 30% penetration of
all 42,000 households in Western Omaha passed by interactive
testbed, only 30% of all households in area that buy any type of
cable services.  However, incumbent cable operator Cox said it has
had no significant net loss in number of subscribers since U S West
launch.  "We are very delighted in our performance in protecting
our market share," said Michael Kohler, community & govt. relations
mgr. for Cox system.  He acknowledged that system lost "some"
customers to U S West, but said they have largely been replaced by
new subscribers.  Competition has meant "all-time-high" cable
penetration in competitive area, Kohler said, but "I'm not sure
that it has grown enough to support everyone's claims."  Cox
spokeswoman said subscribership in Omaha increased 4% in 1995,
about same level as MSO-wide.  U S West has undercut Cox prices
somewhat, Kohler said, but Cox claims that with its free
line-maintenance plan, prices and program packages are "very
comparable."  Another cable operator overbuilt by U S West, Douglas
County Cablevision, has cut prices somewhat, and each of operators
is offering package discounts, but overall rates in Omaha area
haven't fallen significantly as result of testbed, Kohler said.

     Merrill Lynch (ML) lowered ratings on BellSouth and U S West
and said Ameritech and SBC Communications were likely to see
greater bump in share prices as result of Telecom Act.  Analysts
warned that bullish performance of last 7 months, with prices
averaging 38% higher than Standard & Poor's 500 Index, suggested
adjustment period in near term.  ML said it expects prices for RHCs
and GTE to be about 10% above current levels, with Ameritech
forecast to jump 11% to $74 per share and SBC 19% to $71.  "We
continue to believe the next 6 to 12 months will witness a
multitude of headlines and announcements that could increase
investor awareness of the risks to the long distance companies as
RBOC entry begins," ML said.

     Local implementation of Telecom Act of 1996 will produce

     Local implementation of Telecom Act of 1996 will produce
challenges to state commissions -- many of which are spread thin to
meet existing demands, said Lee Palagyi of National Assn. of
Regulatory Utility Commissioners (NARUC) in interview with Telecom
Monitor.  She's NARUC staff representative on congressional issues
and Ohio PUC aid to Comr. Jolynn Butler.  Key challenges will be: 
Meeting federal deadlines for interconnection;  assessing universal
service requirements;  drafting rules that seamlessly link with FCC
rules.  "It's difficult for states to get an accurate view on this
yet," she said.  "On the whole I'd say the states are prepared"
although small commissions and states not on path to competition
may be "overwhelmed" by new policy making, she said.  States such
as Cal., N.Y. and Ohio will be models, Palagyi said, but even those
may be "inundated" by flood of company filings.

     Cal. PUC approved Pacific Bell (PB) discount rate for ISDN

     Cal. PUC approved Pacific Bell (PB) discount rate for ISDN
deployment in schools, colleges, libraries.  PB will offer to wire
up to 2 rooms at school or library for video and data application,
provide service free for one year followed by flat $40-per-month
charge for each ISDN line with unlimited use, plus cost of access
line.  PUC approved modified version of PB's first offer, which had
offered unlimited interLATA toll and local use but realized toll
portion of rate could result in below-cost pricing, company said. 
AT&T had protested plan on basis discount was effort to gain unfair
advantage over local market entrants.

     Wyo. PSC rejected AT&T bid to reconsider its approval of new
U S West (USW) pricing plan that would raise local rates and cut
in-state long distance, saying petition "restated, repeated and
rehashed" arguments made at public hearings.  New rates took effect
Feb. 15.  Commission earlier approved plan that raises most local
charges and lowers long distance average of 16% over 2 years to end
subsidy that covered some local costs.  AT&T said it was "extremely
disappointed" by denial, which it said allows USW to cut toll
services to level that "undisputedly fails" to include 80% of costs
of providing services, resulting in below-cost rate that it said
will hurt competitors.  Effect of pricing is to boost USW revenue
by $5.46 million, AT&T said.  It said PSC action "struck a
devastating blow to the development of competition" and would
"severely hamper" prospects for local competition.  Commission
lawyer David Lucero said AT&T didn't provide new information to
trigger reconsideration.  "AT&T used the appeal process to restate
a case it could not support with facts during the proceeding," said
Emily Harrison, USW spokeswoman in Casper.  USW set new flat rate
for residential service at $16.25 per month, compared with $12.64
monthly in rural areas and $14.64 monthly in towns with more than
24,300 lines, she said.  AT&T in petition said PSC had failed to
act on eliminating charges for carrier common lines that
competitors must buy from USW to provide toll service in state.

     MCI filed complaint with Ohio PUC (PUCO) seeking order that
would require Ameritech to allow MCI interconnection with LEC's
network in Cleveland, process that began with written request Dec.
26.  "Ameritech's failure to negotiate in good faith demonstrates
how a local monopoly can block competition on the state level,"
said Joan Campion, MCI senior counselor-regulatory affairs. 
MCImetro sought interconnection agreement in Cleveland, asking
Ameritech to defer economic terms of agreement to PUCO for
resolution.  MCImetro plans to install switch for local traffic by
April and offer service later this year.  "What makes Ameritech's
nonaction so galling is that it has already done in Wisconsin what
we are asking it to do here in Ohio," she said.
