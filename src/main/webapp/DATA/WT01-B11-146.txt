<H2>Controlling Fox Rabies in Ontario</H2>
</CENTER>

Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources (MNR) researchers believe they have found a way to stop wildlife rabies in its tracks.  If current trends continue, they expect that by the year 2001 they will have eliminated fox rabies from Ontario by air-dropping from one to two million vaccine-baits a year over southern Ontario.<P>

<B>Why should Ontario worry about rabies?</B><P>

The Arctic strain of fox rabies has been a serious and persistent problem in Ontario since 1959.  Until recently, southern Ontario had more reported cases of animal rabies than any other province or state in North America.  In the past, this has cost governments more than $6 million a year in diagnosis; investigation of reports of animal bites to see if rabies was involved; treatment of humans contacting rabid animals; compensation to farmers for loss of livestock; cost of quarantine and research.  Pet owners spend an additional $50 million a year having their pets vaccinated.  The last human death in Ontario due to fox rabies was in 1967.<P>

<B>How have we approached the problem?</B><P>

The Ministry of Natural Resources Rabies Unit, in conjunction with scientists from Connaught Laboratories and Queen's and McMaster universities and the universities of Toronto and Guelph, attacked rabies at its source: the red fox.  Research has centered on immunizing wild foxes.  Scientists now believe that if they are able to immunize a large enough percentage of the "carrier species" population that spreads rabies, the disease will die out completely.  <P>  

<B>Moving towards a solution</B><P>

Vaccinating wildlife on a large scale poses many challenges.  Several existing rabies vaccines work well when injected, but injecting wild foxes was out of the question.  An alternative was to deliver the vaccine orally, in a bait.  The rabies vaccine is a living virus and, therefore, quite delicate.  It has to be absorbed in the mouth, for if it were released in the stomach it would be destroyed.  Current baits contain 1.8 millilitres of rabies vaccine sealed in a small plastic blister-pack embedded in each one.<P>



Finding a vaccine bait that wouldn't be ignored by foxes was another challenge.  Not only must the bait be attractive for foxes to eat, it must be easy to mass produce, and easy to store, handle and distribute over large areas.  Most of all, researchers needed to ensure the blister pack of vaccine would be chewed along with the bait.  The successful bait is a mixture of fats, wax and flavoring.   <P>   

<B>Testing some answers</B><P> 

In 1989, after many years of small-scale studies, MNR researchers began a five-year trial in rabies control.  They started in a 30,000-square-kilometre area in rural eastern Ontario.  They chose an area large enough to prove that it was the bait program, and not simply a natural cycle, that would change the level of rabies.<P>
    
Every October, specially equipped ministry aircraft have dropped baits for the wild foxes at a density of 20 baits per square kilometre along flight lines spaced from 1.3 to 2 kilometres apart.  Three Twin Otters are outfitted with special bait-dispensing machines.  Navigation is done using the latest satellite and computer technology so that millions of baits are spread uniformly and at a predetermined density.  The number of baits delivered is computer controlled and carefully recorded.  This helps ensure a minimal number of baits are wasted.<P>

<B>How are we doing?</B><P>

A rabid fox has not been found in the region since September 1993.  From 1970 to 1989, the treated region had been averaging 385 cases of animal rabies a year.  By 1993, that had dropped to 16.  Of those 16, seven were bats, and one a fox infected with a bat strain of rabies.  Bats carry their own forms of rabies, and since bats in Ontario are small and insect-eating, they are not affected by the rabies vaccination program.<P>   

In 1993, the experimental program was expanded to the rest of the rabies zone in southern Ontario.  Rabies dropped to its lowest level in Ontario since 1961.  In 1995, three aircraft took 10 days to distribute 1.8 million baits over 84,000 square kilometres, thereby covering all of the rabies-affected area in southern Ontario.  Whereas Ontario had averaged 2000 cases of rabies per year during the 1980s, at the end of 1995, there were only 323.<P>

<B>Rabies in the city</B><P>

In Metropolitan Toronto (pop. 2.4 million), a city with extensive ravines, parklands, large red fox populations, and a history of rabies problems, rabies vaccine-baits are distributed by hand in the spring and in the fall. <P> 


<B>Skunks can spread rabies too</B><P>

Since 1987, the ministry has undertaken an experimental program to vaccinate skunks in a sector of the city (Scarborough) which had been experiencing a consistently, high incidence of skunk rabies.  Since the oral vaccine in a bait does not work for skunks, scientists developed a system (TVR) to live-trap, vaccinate by injection, and release the animals.  Only three cases have been diagnosed to date in that area since 1987, and none since 1990.<P>

<B>Raccoons and Rabies</B><P>

The raccoon strain of rabies has been moving northward in the United States for several years.  It is now established on the New York side of the Niagara River and within 10 kilometres of Gananoque on the St. Lawrence River.  Since raccoons were often attracted to the live traps set out for the skunk population in the Scarborough study, information was collected on raccoons captured in the traps for use at a later date.  This knowledge has been pivotal in the current strategy for keeping raccoon rabies out of Ontario.  In 1994, MNR immunized about 64 per cent of the raccoon population in the Niagara Region in an area between the Welland Canal and the Niagara River, with the intention of creating a buffer zone of protected raccoons at the point where the potential for a rabid raccoon to stray into Ontario is very high.  In 1995, scientists added new buffer zones along the St. Lawrence River to this program.  They also cooperated with a New York State experiment to airdrop an American-made vaccine against rabies for raccoons.  Ontario supported these efforts to stop raccoon rabies before it reaches the province.  MNR will continue to maintain Ontario's buffer zones of vaccinated raccoons in 1996.<P>


<B>Using what we are learning about rabies in foxes on raccoon rabies</B><P>

As part of the long-term strategy for wildlife rabies control, MNR's Rabies Research Unit has also tested and confirmed how many baits are needed to airdrop rabies vaccine to immunize a raccoon population.  They have found the flavor that raccoons prefer and expect to be able to use this method in about two to four years when a cost-effective oral rabies vaccine for raccoons becomes available. <P>
