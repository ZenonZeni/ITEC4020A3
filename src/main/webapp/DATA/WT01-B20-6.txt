<p align="center"><b>Colorado Senate Gives Green Light To
Domestic Hemp Cultivation</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>March 30, 1996, Denver CO:</b>&nbsp;
Legislation (SB 67) that would allow Colorado to become the first
state to legalize the growing of industrial hemp was approved by
the full Senate by a 18-15 vote. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The move surprised many who felt that the controversial
legislation would likely fall three or five votes shy of a
majority.&nbsp; &quot;I feel like I've been through a wringer,
but I'm very happy,&quot; said the bill's sponsor, Sen. Lloyd
Casey (D-Northglenn), in an interview with the <i>Rocky Mountain
News</i>.&nbsp; A similar bill was introduced by Casey in 1995,
but only received one vote of support in its first committee. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The Colorado Industrial Hemp Production Act permits the planting
of no more than 40 acres of industrial hemp (defined by the bill
as marijuana containing no more than 0.5% THC) in Colorado in
1996 for agricultural, commercial, and scientific research.&nbsp;
The legislation allows for full scale hemp production to begin in
1998 and has been endorsed by the Colorado Farm Bureau, the Colorado
State Grange, and the National Federation of Farm Bureaus.&nbsp;
The bill has also received support from Hollywood actor and hemp
businessman Woody Harrelson. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The bill now moves to the more conservative House where Reps.
Steve Acquafresca (R-Cedaredge) and Bill Jerke (R-Lasalle) have
agreed to help carry the legislation. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Often described as &quot;marijuana's misunderstood cousin,&quot;
industrial hemp is from the same species that produces
marijuana.&nbsp; Unlike marijuana, however, industrial hemp has
only minute amounts of delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the
psychoactive ingredient that gives marijuana its medical and
euphoric properties.&nbsp; Industrial hemp is currently grown
legally through much of Europe, Asia, and parts of Canada to
produce a variety of products such as textiles, paper, composites,
paints, cosmetics, and animal feed. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><i>For more information on this bill, please contact the office
of Senator Lloyd Casey @ (303) 866-4865 or the Colorado Hemp
Initiative Project @ (303) 784-5632.&nbsp; For more information
on the value of industrial hemp, please contact either Allen St.
Pierre or Paul Armentano of </i><b><i>NORML</i></b><i> @ (202)

<p align="center"><b>District Attorney To Take No Further Action
In Medical Marijuana Distribution Case</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>April 3, 1996, New York, NY:</b>&nbsp; The
Manhattan District Attorney has agreed to take no further action
in its prosecution of Johann Moore for distributing marijuana for
medical purposes and to dismiss all charges against him in six
months. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Judge William Mogulescu explained in open court that this
decision by the District Attorney's office constituted an extreme
deviation from their internal policies which require that all
defendants must plead to the indictment in all cases of marijuana
sales.&nbsp; Judge Mogulescu further added that he believed the
District Attorney's action to be tantamount to an acknowledgment
by that office of the legitimacy of medicinal marijuana and of
the validity of Moore's claim that his distribution of marijuana
as medicine constituted a justification for his actions. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Immediately after the court proceeding where Moore consented to
the six month deferred prosecution, he informed reporters that he
intends to continue to provide marijuana to those with a legitimate
medical need. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Moore's attorney and President of the National Association of
Criminal Defense Lawyers (NACDL), Robert Fogelnest said, &quot;I
applaud the District Attorney's office for their ultimately making
an intelligent and humane judgment in the disposition of this
case.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;I hope that this will pave the way for a more enlightened
policy regarding the distribution of marijuana for medical
use,&quot; added Moore's other attorney, Ruth Liebesman.&nbsp;
Both Liebesman and Fogelnest are members of the <b>NORML</b>
Legal Committee. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Moore is a longtime New York City drug reform activist and is the
founder of the city's underground cannabis buyer's club -- one of
an estimated 30 clubs that currently operate and distribute
medical marijuana to seriously ill patients who possess a
doctor's recommendation.&nbsp; He was arrested last August for
distributing marijuana and was charged with criminal sales in the
fourth degree. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;The statement made by the District Attorney in this case is
a strong one,&quot; said <b>NORML</b> Deputy Director Allen St.
Pierre.&nbsp; &quot;It appears that they -- like the D.A.'s
offices in San Francisco, Oakland, and Santa Cruz have done
previously -- wish to make the prosecution of buyer's clubs and
those involved in the distribution of marijuana for medicinal use
the state's lowest priority.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><i>For more information on the Johann Moore case, please contact
either Attorney Robert Fogelnest or Ruth Liebesman @ (212)
683-8000.&nbsp; For more information on cannabis buyer's clubs,
please contact Allen St. Pierre of </i><b><i>NORML</i></b><i> @
(202) 483-5500.</i></p>

<p align="center"><b>California Reports Record Numbers Of
Marijuana Prisoners</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>April 1, 1996, San Francisco, CA:</b>&nbsp;
The number of marijuana offenders in California state prisons has
increased to its highest level in history, according to the
latest statistics from the Department of Corrections.&nbsp; As of
December 31, 1995, 1,572 prisoners were serving time for marijuana
felonies, up 18 percent from one year previously. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The new figures appear to belie recent claims that the war on
marijuana in California has let up.&nbsp; California now has two
and a half times more marijuana prisoners than in the early
l970s, before possession was decriminalized from a felony to a
misdemeanor, and 15 times as many marijuana prisoners as at the
record low in 1980.&nbsp; An unknown number of additional
prisoners are serving time in county jails.&nbsp; Nonetheless,
recent surveys indicate that marijuana usage is rising --
especially among adolescents -- suggesting strongly that harsh
penalties are not an effective deterrent in marijuana
consumption. <br>

California NORML @ (415) 563-5858.</i></p>

<p align="center"><b>Prosecutors Seek To Seize Frequent-Flier
Miles Of Man Convicted Of Marijuana Trafficking</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>April 3, 1996, Baltimore, MD:</b>&nbsp; In an
action that appears to be a first for the nation, federal prosecutors
are attempting to seize 117,705 frequent-flier miles of a
convicted marijuana trafficker. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;I think it's ingenious,&quot; said U.S. Attorney Lynne A.
Battaglia, whose office recently filed the forfeiture
claim.&nbsp; Prosecutors maintain that the miles should be
converted into plain tickets and given to law enforcement
agencies. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">A federal judge will decide whether the miles should be
considered as assets and confiscated under forfeiture laws.&nbsp;
Recently, the Supreme Court upheld a Michigan ruling that allows prosecutors
to seize property used in a crime even when the owner was not a
participant.</p>

<p align="center"><b>USA WEEKEND QuickPoll Indicates Majority Of
Americans Favor Marijuana Decriminalization</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>March 31, 1996:</b>&nbsp; Seventy-four percent
of the more than 6,200 individuals who responded to a USA WEEKEND
poll said they favored decriminalizing marijuana.&nbsp; The
outcome came as a surprise to many who felt that the USA WEEKEND
feature: <em>Why more kids are into pot</em> greatly sensationalized
the issue. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;The results of this poll indicates that a clear majority of
Americans favor marijuana decriminalization,&quot; said <b>NORML</b>
Deputy Director Allen St. Pierre.&nbsp; &quot;The results of the
USA WEEKEND QuickPoll mimics the outcomes of similar polls
conducted recently by <i>Parade Magazine</i> and America
Online.&nbsp; A significant number of Americans are fed-up with
the government's war on marijuana consumers.&quot;</p>
