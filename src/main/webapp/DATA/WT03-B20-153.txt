The authenticity of foods is a major issue for the industry. There is always a profit incentive for expensive commodities to be extended by the addition of cheaper ingredients, and such adulteration is becoming increasingly sophisticated. RSSL is acknowledged world-wide for its services in fruit juice authenticity. The full service involves tests of over 15 key parameters which enables our expert analysts to determine both the purity of a juice and its country of origin. These tests can be applied to a number of juices, and fruit products. </P>

RSSL also has authenticity services for oils and fats. Certain oils are traded at a premium because of their alleged quality and/or health properties, and again, adulteration with cheaper oils is a potential problem. RSSL's services can check the purity, quality, safety and properties of all these products.</P>



<P>Other authenticity services are available for coffee, fish, pasta, rice, meat, wines, and honey.</P>

<P>Similar techniques may also be applied in the area of compositional / nutritional analysis, and these are frequently necessary both for accurate labelling and in the detection of counterfeit products, especially perfumes and premium spirits.</P>
