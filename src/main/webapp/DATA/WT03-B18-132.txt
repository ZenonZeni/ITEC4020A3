<P><B>Fort Myers, FL</B> (March 25, 1996): WORKSPACE&#174;, the revolutionary
simulation software that runs on a personal computer - including notebooks, has
added another first to its expanding list of cost-effective features. A
Workspace user who has engineered a robotics or automated system can transmit -
via e-mail, modem or Internet - a complete simulation file to any computer that
uses Microsoft Windows. Only the originator of the simulation must have
Workspace.</P>
<P> &quot;This new capability has created the ultimate engineering, marketing
and manufacturing tool,&quot; says Walter K. Weisel, CEO of Robotic Workspace
Technologies, Inc., exclusive North American marketers of Workspace. &quot;Now
each person on the team can view a simulation in real time, confer by conference
call, make engineering decisions and marketing decisions all at the same time
without ever leaving their individual offices. All that's required is a PC with
Microsoft Windows and a phone to talk with each other.&quot; </P>
<P>The PC-generated simulation to be transmitted (called a &quot;Flick File&quot;)
contains a full-shaded color, 3D simulation, which runs all the peripherals,
including robots in real time. Before sending the file, the Workspace user
converts the simulation being run on the PC into a real time picture file. </P>
<P>This computer file is then sent via e-mail, Internet, or on a 3.5 floppy to
as many worldwide locations as necessary.</P>
<P> During the conference call, all parties watch the same simulation in their
own offices, and discuss and approve proposals, engineering changes, and floor
layouts. Changes can be made quickly in software to verify any new requirements.
 &quot;Before now, the only way to evaluate a workcell or other system was to
coordinate schedules and meet at one location,&quot; Weisel says. &quot;Concurrency
through electronic mail means there's no lost time from the calendar, no flying
in from around the country or around the world, and incalculable time saved in
getting a system up and running. The Workspace software allows everyone to test
drive the application before ordering the hardware.</P>
<P>&quot;Smart buyers around the world are becoming keenly aware of the need to
simulate a system's capabilities before  purchasing expensive hardware,&quot;
Weisel adds. &quot;The power of today's PC makes this job easy and the
portability - both via electronic mail or operating on a notebook - changes the
way we think about proof of concept.&quot;</P>
