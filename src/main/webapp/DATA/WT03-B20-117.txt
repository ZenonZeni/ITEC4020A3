<h1>Renewable Energy</h1><p>
<p>
Renewable energy sources are either continuously resupplied by the sun or 
tap
inexhaustible resources--as in geothermal energy.  In contrast, fossil 
fuels
form so slowly in comparison to our energy use that we are essentially 
mining
finite, nonrenewable resources and could exhaust quality supplies within 
the
foreseeable future.  The use of renewable energy does not produce 
greenhouse
gases and either does not pollute or emits far less pollution than 
burning
fossil fuels.  Renewable energy sources also represent a secure and 
stable
source of energy for our country.  These diverse technologies represent 
an
important source of new industries.<p>
<p>
<h2>Resource</h2>
Solar thermal and photovoltaics use solar energy directly; wind, biomass, 
and
hydropower indirectly use the products of their energy.<p>

For most of the United States, the electrical needs for a typical family 
could
theoretically be met by the solar energy shining on about 30 square feet 
of
roof space.<p>

If solar energy systems that were only 10% efficient (well within reach 
of
current solar cell and solar thermal technology) were placed on 1% of the 
U.S.
land area (such as two or three large counties in Nevada), they could 
provide
energy equivalent to that used by the United States.<p>

Wind energy in North Dakota alone could provide one-third of the U.S.
electrical demand.<p>
<p>
<h2>Advantages</h2>
U.S. industry now spends about $12 billion annually to control air
emissions; most renewable energy uses do not pollute at all; others emit 
far
less pollution than burning fossil fuels; use of renewables alleviates 
air
quality and acid rain problems.<p>

Federal renewable energy and energy efficiency programs will create 
20,000 jobs
in 1995.<p>

Renewable energy equipment exports reached $245 million in 1992; a 
massive
worldwide market is anticipated for environmentally benign technologies 
such as
renewables.<p>

Renewable energy uses do not release carbon dioxide or other greenhouse
gases that threaten to cause global warming, as fossil fuel use does.<p>

Renewable energy would all be generated domestically, creating jobs and
alleviating energy dependence and balance-of-payments problems. <p>
<p>
<h2>Current Use</h2>
In the United States, renewables now supply about 8% of the total energy 
demand
(compared to 18% worldwide) and 11% of the electricity generation.<p>
Hydroelectric power in the United States accounts for about half of the 
total
renewable energy supply and most of the renewable electricity 
generation.<p>
<p>
<h2>Projected Use</h2>
The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) projects that renewable energy 
production
will increase to 15% of U.S. energy needs by 2030; a program of price 
premiums
would increase it to 22%, a program of intensive research and development 
would
increase that projection to 28%. <p>

DOE is seeking to double nonhydro renewable energy generating capacity by

2000.<p>

Within 15 years, renewable energy could be generating enough electricity 
to
power 40 million homes and to offset 70 days of oil imports.<p>

Renewables could be saving 65 million tons of carbon emissions--equal to 
10% of
the emissions produced by the electricity sector.<p>

President Clinton's Climate Change Action Plan estimates that more than
3000 megawatts of electricity will be generated by commercial forms of
renewable solar thermal energy by the year 2000.<p>
<p>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
There will be large-scale retirement of electric generating plants 
starting
around 2000; nearly one-fourth of the electric utility industry's 2010 
capacity
will be built between now and then; this is a major opportunity to 
install
renewable technologies.<p>

The 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments place major new requirements on
transportation vehicles and future power generation; renewables are an
excellent way to meet these demands.<p>

Several studies on energy subsidies, while they differ widely in their 
total
calculation, agree that renewables have thus far received only a very 
small
percentage of energy subsidies.<p>

As much as $200 billion in new capital investment will be needed this 
decade to
meet the nation's growing electricity needs.  These investments will 
determine
the sources of our electrical power for years to come.<p>
