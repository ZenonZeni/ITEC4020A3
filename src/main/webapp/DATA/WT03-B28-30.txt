SPACE INDUSTRIES INTERNATIONAL FORMS
TELECOMMUNICATIONS/ELECTRONICS DIVISION
Houston TX

The Houston-based Space Industries International, Inc. (SIII)
announced last month that it is establishing a new division
called Space Industries Telecommunications and Electronics
Company (SITEC), also to be based in Houston.
SITEC will design and develop telecommunications systems and
interactive applications in a variety of transmission media, as
well as support the spaceflight electronics development efforts
of Space Industries. The new division will be headed by Dr.
Bartus H. Batson, an expert in communications electronics, who
was instrumental to the development of the space shuttle
communications system. Batson, an authority on satellite
communications and voice/data/ video applications, will be joined
by several other associates with whom he has worked previously.
A statement from SIII explains that SITEC will initially focus on
the design and engineering of international educational networks
and the development of new telecommunications products and
services.
SIII also announced the election by its shareholders of three new
members to its board of directors: Dr. Joel S. Birnbaum, Dr.
Christopher C. Kraft Jr., and Rulon G. Shelley. Dr. Maxime A.
Faget, Chief Executive Officer of SIII, said, "We are quite
pleased to add three such distinguished directors to our board.
As Space Industries continues to expand and diversify, input from
these qualified and experienced men on our board of directors
will be extremely valuable to the company."
Formed in 1982, SIII designs, markets and operates commercial
space-based facilities, and provides a variety of space services
to governmental and industrial customers. Its subsidiaries
include Space Industries Inc., in Houston, TX, and Payload
Systems Inc., in Cambridge, MA, which offer an integrated
capability in the design, development, fabrication and operation
of space systems.

NASA RELEASES STUDY ON LUNAR ENERGY ENTERPRISE.

The Space Studies Institute (SSI) of Princeton, NJ, has announced
that NASA has recently released a study on solar power satellites
titled "Report of the NASA Lunar Energy Enterprise Case Study
Task Force." While the initial purpose of the report was to study
mining solar-wind implanted helium-3 from lunar regolith, the
task force also decided to examine the use of lunar materials to
build solar power satellites, as proposed by Drs. Gerard O'Neill
and Peter Glasner of SSI. In addition, the report looks at the
idea of converting surface areas of the Moon into low grade solar
cells and transmitting the energy from the Moon to the Earth. The
report concluded that "the Moon must play a role in long-term
terrestial electricity supply matters," and calls for
comprehensive studies by industry, NASA, and the Department of
Energy so that a national commitment for space power can be
established.

THIOKOL POSTS 100% SUCCESS RATE FOR SOLID ROCKET MOTORS IN 1989.

Thiokol Corporation posted a 100% success rate for their solid
propulsion rocket motors in 1989, after more than 124 of the
motors were used without failure during the year.  Thiokol was
involved last year in five space shuttle missions, 16 satellite
missions, 72 space launch boosts, four individual-stage
sub-orbital research rocket launches, six first-stage Navy
Trident submarine missile launches and three Air Force missile
launches.  Nineteen other motors, ranging from five to 27 inches
in diameter, were also fired successfully during space missions.
Launched in 1989 but not yet fired is a Thiokol Star-48 rocket
motor aboard the Magellan interplanetary probe, which will be
fired in August 1990 to establish orbit around Venus.  For more
information, contact Steve Lawson, Thiokol Corporation, (801)
629-2255.

E'PRIME ANNOUNCES PLANS FOR EQUATORIAL SPACEPORT IN INDONESIA.

E'Prime Aerospace Corp. of Titusville, FL, is proposing to build
the world's first internationally-backed equatorial spaceport on
the island of Irian Jaya in eastern Indonesia. The launching
facility would be placed in the city of Biak, which is precisely
on the equator, and offers potential savings of $2 million per
launch to satellite clients around the world. According to the
Honolulu Star Bulletin, Jim Jeffrey, E'Prime's chief operations
officer, said, "If NASA or Ariane are interested, that would be
fine." The spaceport could be built in three to five years.

NASA SELECTS SBIR RESEARCH PROPOSALS FROM CALIFORNIA, OREGON AND
ARIZONA.

NASA has chosen 70 new research proposals for its Small Business
Innovation Research (SBIR) program, to be conducted by 2 Arizona,
3 Oregon and 54 California firms.  The awards were selected
competitively from over 2,000 proposals made during the first six
months of 1989.  Nationwide, 248 research proposals have been
selected from 198 small, high technology firms located in 35
states.  Approximately $12 million of NASA's 1990 budget will
fund these Phase I projects, which are six-month contract efforts
normally not exceeding $50,000 each.

By far the largest proportion of Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) program contracts have gone to Southern
California firms.  Of the 54 California companies recently
chosen, 36 were from Southern California and 18 from Northern
California, the latter awards concentrated in the "Silicon
Valley" towns of Sunnyvale, Mountain View, Palo Alto and Santa
Clara.  For more information, contact Del Harding, NASA Ames

SOLAR-POWERED HYDROGEN PRODUCTION LOOKING UP.

According to the Christian Science Monitor, the next ten years
will see the cheapness and efficiency of photovoltaic cells
doubled, enabling economic production of hydrogen as a clean,
alternative fuel source.  Drs. Joan Ogden and Robert Williams of
Princeton University predicted that development of solar cells
costing 20 to 40 cents a watt (versus the current $4.00/watt),
will make hydrogen fuel available for "the equivalent cost of
$1.50 to $2.00 a gallon of gasoline."  Current laboratory
research has already resulted in solar cell efficiencies of up to
14%.  U.S. government funding of hydrogen fuel research for 1989
was placed at $3 million a year, versus $50 million spent by West
Germany.  House Bill 2793, a five-year, $155 million program to
increase U.S. hydrogen fuel research, is aimed at reducing that
gap.

DARPA SPONSORING HIGH-TEMPERATURE SUPERCONDUCTOR PROJECT.

The Defense Advanced Research Projects (DARPA) is soliciting
proposals to develop materials processing and fabrication methods
to produce high-temperature superconductors. The major goal of
this program is to demonstrate manufacturable fabrication and
practical applications of superconductors that can operate
effectively at or above 77K. Applications for such
superconductors would include use in computers, motors, magnets,
sensors and electronic devices. Interested parties should contact
Scott Ulrey, Contract Specialist, DARPA, Contracts Management,
1400 Wilson Blvd., Arlington, VA 22209-2308, 202-694-1771.
