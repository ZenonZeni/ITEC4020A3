<P>
<B>BENEFITS</B> 
<P>
A single utility scale wind turbine (500 KW) displaces approximately
500 tons of CO2 emissions annually, based on the current U.S.
energy mix's average emissions. (Source: American Wind Energy Association, April 1996)
<P>
<B>WIND RESOURCE</B>
<P>
Although 37 states have moderate or better wind resources, twelve
states in the midsection of the country, Texas to North Dakota,
contribute over 90 percent of the wind electric potential in the
contiguous United States. These areas have the capacity to produce
several times their own electrical consumption, that allows them
to export or sell electric power, or use it for other applications.
(Source: Pacific Northwest Laboratory Wind Assessment, August
1991)
<P>
<B>WIND POWER SUPPLY</B>
<P>
In 1995 alone, world capacity for wind generated electricity increased
35 percent over 1994 from about 3700 MW to 5000 MW. Nearly two-thirds
of these new wind plants were installed in India and Germany.
(Source: American Wind Energy Association, &quot;Wind Energy Weekly,&quot;
Vol. 15 No. 693, April 15, 1996)
<P>
Wind power plants in California produced over 3.1 billion kWh
of electricity during 1995, about 1.2 percent of the electricity
used by California. (Source: California Energy Commission, 1995)
<P>
The Tehachapi-Mojave wind resource area is the world's largest
producer of wind-generated electricity. More than 5000 wind turbines
collectively generate 1.3 billion
<P>
kilowatt-hours of electricity which is enough electricity to meet
the residential needs of nearly 500,000 people. (Source: Kern
Wind Energy Association, 1996)
<P>
On a typical day, wind can meets up to seven percent of Pacific
Gas &amp; Electric's* electricity load without problems. *Pacific
Gas and Electric is one of the largest investor owned utilities
in the country. (Source: Integrating an Ever-Changing Resource,
Utility Wind Interest Group, September 16992)
<P>
&quot;I believe many communities are beginning to realize that
wind energy is a good hedge against uncertainties in energy costs.
There is also a growing consensus that we simply can't ignore
our obligation to the future, and besides, it's what our customers
are demanding.&quot; (Source: Waverly Light &amp; Power General
Manager Glenn Cannon, Public Power Weekly, March 18, 1996)
<P>
<B>WIND TURBINES</B>
<P>
The largest wind turbine built in the U.S. today, (Zond Z-40, 550 kW), 
stands over 140
feet tall, uses three blades over 65 feet long each, and in windy
locations can produce as much energy each year as is consumed
by over 200 homes. (Source: Zond Systems Inc., 1995)
<P>
&quot;Continued improvements . . . are pushing wind over a technological
hump, allowing this renewable energy source to achieve its vast
potential as the preferred clean and competitively priced energy
source in many parts of this country.&quot; (Source: DOE Assistant
Secretary for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, Christine
Ervin, DOE News Release, September 20, 1995)
<P>
&quot;In general, such technology as high-efficiency blades and
generators, along with power electronics for variable-speed drives,
has contributed to reducing the cost of wind energy.&quot; (Source:
Jay Jayedev, R. Lynette and Associates, in &quot;Harnessing the
Wind,&quot; IEEE Spectrum, November 1995)
<P>
<B>COST TRENDS</B>
<P>
Wind project today are being installed for less than five cents
per kilowatt-hour, nearly a 100 percent decrease in cost from
the early 1980s. (Source: Princeton Economic Research Inc., 1996)
