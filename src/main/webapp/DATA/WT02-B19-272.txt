Reston, VA<P>


Amendments to IDEA may be passed by the Senate this week by unanimous consent
(without debate or a formal vote).  Over the weekend, a package of amendments was
put together in response to House and Senate members.  This package is based upon
the Senate bill, but also takes language from the House bill.  Once the Senate passed a
bill with the new amendments included, the House could pass the same bill without any
further amendments.  The amendments would change the Senate bill's provisions
on:<P>

<ul><li>records transmission
<li> limits on attorney's fees
<li> initial mediation without attorneys
<li> evaluation
<li> IEP contents
<li> membership of IEP team
<li> review and revision of IEPs
<li>"seriously disruptive" children
<li> discipline
<li> notice of intent to file due process
<li> data collection</ul><P>

There is too little time for children, family, and education experts to analyze the revised
bill.  There is far too little time for Congresspersons and/or their staff to fully come to
understand the bill in order to make an educated vote.   <P>

Many members of Congress have demonstrated excellent leadership in developing the
House and Senate bills.  It would be a terrible shame for all of their careful work and
effort to result in a law developed by a quick cut-and-paste process, rather than the
normal procedure of a thoughtful, line-by-line analysis and conference agreement. <P>

We are optimistic that members of Congress who care about the interests of children
and education will NOT support passage of this bill.  We would rather work another year
for a strong bill than to pass a bill that has not had the benefit of careful scrutiny by
administrators, teachers, or parents.<P>

Our most recent information is that the bill may get Senate action late this afternoon
(Tuesday) or early Wednesday morning.  If this occurs, look for House action between
Wednesday afternoon and Friday.  Your Senators can be reached by calling
800-962-3524 or 202-224-3121, and your Representatives can be reached at
800-972-3524.<P>

<b>ACTION NEEDED</b>: Urge your Senators and Representative  to oppose any
further action on the reauthorization of IDEA in this Congress. <P>
