<B>Anthony F. Amos'</B> research in 1995/1996 was centered in two main areas; the Texas coastal zone and Antarctica.  Locally, he completed the Corpus Christi Bay National Estuary Program (CCBNEP) project researching the history and trends of the incidence of bay/marine (anthropogenic) debris, continued the NOAA-sponsored program to monitor remote San Jose Island for sea-turtle stranding and nesting, and continued to survey the Mustang Island Gulf beach and monitor tides, currents, and weather at the UTMSI Pier Laboratory with real-time displays at the Visitor’s Center and the UTMSI Office.  In Antarctica he participated in year 7 or the NOAA/NMFS program Antarctic Living Marine Resources (AMLR) aboard the R/V YUZHMORGEOLOGIYA.
<P>
<B>Dr. Connie R. Arnold's</B> research has emphasized the development
of sustainable mariculture through responsible stewardship of
marine resources and the development of culture technologies.
Closed system research has included the evaluation of the interaction
of feeds and closed system dynamics, the demonstration of recirculation
systems technologies for the production of <I>Penaeus vannamei</I>,
and the development of large scale larval rearing protocols for
<I>Sciaenops ocellatus</I> and <I>Ocyurus chrysurus</I>. Nutrition
research has emphasized the continued development and testing
of &quot;low pollution&quot; feeds for marine species such as
<I>Sciaenops ocellatus</I> and <I>Penaeus vannamei</I>. Work on
early life history of fishes continued with an active field program
involving studies of larval transport and nursery area utilization
by red drum and other sciaenids. Results suggest that events during
the pelagic larval stage are quite important in regulating recruitment
to the nursery and ultimately population size in red drum. Additional
analysis of these data is currently underway. Work with cobia
(ling) is continuing with efforts to capture and transport additional
adults to enhance the population for spawning.
<P>
<B>Dr. Ronald H. Benner's</B> research group investigated various aspects of the carbon and nitrogen cycles in the oceans, estuaries, and rivers.  A new conceptual model, the Size-Reactivity Continuum Model, of the cycling of organic matter in aquatic environmental was developed.  Studies of the microbial utilization and chemical composition of organic matter of varying sizes revealed that macromolecular material is more reactive and less diagenetically altered than smaller molecules.  These findings are contrary to the common notions that small molecules cycle rapidly while macromolecular material is recalcitrant.
<P>
<B>Dr. Edward J. Buskey's</B> research group has completed studies
of swarming behavior of copepods in the mangrove prop root environment
in Belize. By forming these aggregations, the copepods are protected
from predators, avoid being dispersed into unfavorable habitats
and increase their opportunities for mating. They have also continued
studies of protozooplankton in the Gulf of Mexico, including laboratory
studies of sensory perception and feeding behavior of heterotrophic
dinoflagellates.
<P>
<B>Dr. Kenneth H. Dunton's </B>lab is currently focused on a variety of projects ranging from the High Arctic to the Antarctic.  These projects include collaborators from several institutions and have resulted in the development of new approaches and techniques for measuring marine primary productivity in aquatic plants.  In the Arctic, Dr. Dunton is collaborating with Dr. Pat Neale from the Smithsonian on support from NSF to evaluate the response of kelp to UV radiation, the project incorporates in situ (under ice) measurement of chlorophyll fluorescence to examine UV effects as well as experimental manipulations of the plants in the laboratory.  In the Antarctic, Dr. Dunton is collaborating with Dr. Val Gerard (SUNY of Stony Brook) and Dr. Ian Davison (Univ. Maine) on the adaptations made by polar seaweeds to maintain high rates of production at cold temperatures.  On this NSF funded project, Dr. Dunton has developed a new approach for measurement of photosynthesis using the stable isotope, carbon -13.  In Texas, Dr. Dunton’s work on seagrasses has expanded to include the development of integrative model to estimate seagrass productivity in the Laguna Madre.  This work is being conducted with colleagues from Texas Parks and Wildlife and Texas A&M University under funding for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
<P>
<B>Dr. Lee A. Fuiman's</B> laboratory expanded its work on the implications of morphological development for ecological interactions of fish larvae by studying the effects of a model pesticide.  In collaboration with Dr. Peter Thomas’ laboratory, they measured significant changes in the sensory and locomotor abilities of Atlantic croaker larvae whose parents had been exposed to very low levels of the pesticide.  These sublethal effects could be ultimately lethal in an ecological sense because they compromise the ability of larvae to find sufficient food to survive and to escape from predators they encounter.
<P>
<B>Dr. G. Joan Holt's</B> research group developed methodology
for rearing two coral reef species <I>Lysmata wurdemani</I> and
<I>Equetus umbrosus</I>. A manuscript describing larval development
in <I>E. umbrosus</I> compared to the closely related species
<I>E. acuminatus</I> will show definitive differences in larval
development in the two species, resolving a taxonomic dilemma.
A major component of this year's research was a red drum transport
and recruitment study with Scott Holt. Spawning periodicity and
larval abundances provide the first data for the entire spawning
event. Forty-two percent of planktonic larvae were experiencing
some degree of food depravation, but only two percent were starved
or in poor condition. Variation in the biochemical condition of
larvae collected in estuarine seagrass was due to fish size and
water temperature, but not to differences in seagrass species.

<P>
<B>Dr. Ellery D. Ingall's</B> research has focused on the cycling
of nutrients in the ocean. Recent studies have demonstrated that
oxygen depleted bottom waters greatly enhance phosphorus regeneration
from sediments. Based on these observations a positive feedback
between water column anoxia, enhanced benthic phosphorus regeneration,
and marine productivity has been proposed and incorporated into
a large scale mathematical model of the ocean. The feedback effect
helps explain the widespread accumulation of organic-rich marine
sediments deposited from anoxic waters that are observed in the
geologic record.
<P>
<B>Dr. Paul A. Montagna's </B>research focuses on the importance
of benthic invertebrates in the ecology of the coastal zone. This
year, he has proved that grazing by meiofauna, the smallest invertebrates,
can control the rates of many microbial processes in natural and
disturbed sediments. He has also shown that small clams and snails
are good indicators of the importance of freshwater inflow to
maintain productivity in Texas estuaries.
<P>
<B>Dr. Curtis A. Suttle's</B> group has developed a number of
new approaches for investigating the roles of viruses in marine
ecosystems. These include a protocol for staining viruses so that
they can be visualized by epifluorescence microscopy, using fluorescently
tagged viruses to identify and quantify specific types of cells
that are susceptible to viral infection, and developing oligonucleotide
primers for virus DNA polymerase genes that allow the DNA from
known and unknown viruses to be amplified from seawater and identified.
These methods have helped to investigate the dynamics of host
and virus populations in nature, and to determine the existence
of previously unknown viruses in seawater.

<B>Richard K. Tinnin</B> heads the Marine Education Services Program.
MES hosts over 10,000 students each year who stay in the dorms
and participate in research vessel cruises and field trips to
the surrounding marine habitats. One thousand teachers last year
participated in 17 weekend teacher workshops. The Visitors Center
hosted over 40,000 visitors who enjoyed seven marine aquariums,
watched videos in the auditorium and toured the main laboratory
displays. MES is in the 2nd year of a 3 year pilot program for
an elementary education project, Marine Activities, Resources
and Education (MARE) in cooperation with The Lawrence Hall of
Science, UC Berkeley. Six Texas schools are pilot testing the
habitat oriented curriculum and writing Gulf coast activities
to be included in this exciting teacher training project. The
MARE curriculum uses the ocean as a central theme to link all
traditional subject matter in an interdisciplinary approach.
<P>
<B>Dr. Peter Thomas' </B>group has recently identified a steroid
receptor on croaker sperm. Steroid binding activity was previously
found in the sperm of humans and other mammals, but the binding
has not been characterized. Thomas' group have fully characterized
the steroid receptor in croaker sperm, the first extensive characterization
of such a receptor in any vertebrate species. The function of
this receptor is unknown at present, but may be associated with
sperm activation. Previous studies had indicated that somatolactin,
a pituitary hormone recently discovered in fish, is involved in
background adaptation. Further research has demonstrated that
purified somatolactin can act directly on chromatophores in fish
scales to cause melanin aggregation. These results suggest that
somatolactin enables fish to adapt to different backgrounds by
altering chromatophore function and hence body pigmentation.
<P>
<B>Dr. Terry E. Whitledge's</B> work has focused on the relationship
of nutrient availability and growth of the Texas brown tide in
the upper and lower Laguna Madre. Experimental ponds were used
to determine how different types of nitrogen fertilizers affect
relative species composition, biomass and growth rates of the
brown tide and other phytoplankton as a potential means of biological
control. Research was also continued on the enhanced productivity
and ecological effects of proposed freshwater and wastewater diversions
into Nueces Bay and Rincon Delta.
