The Movemaster RV-M2 is the "big brother" of the RV-M1, and it is the ideal choice for all applications which tax the limits of the smaller model as regards path velocity, lifting capacity, and operating range. Compared to the RV-M1, the Movemaster RV-M2 has 70 percent more lifting capacity (2kg), its path velocity is a full 50 percent higher (1,500 mm/s PTP) and its reach is 40 percent graeter (570mm). <p>

Despite its high path velocity, the Movemaster RV-M2 has excellent position repeatability, combined with reliably constant speed. In addition to the many other potential tasks, this makes this robot ideal for the application of adhesives.<p>

The Movemaster RV-M2's instruction set also includes a powerful PALLETIZE command. Together with the robot's long reach, this command makes it possible to process pallets up to DIN A3 format size. This illustrates just how much more varied the potential of the Movemaster RV-M2 is for handling and assembling applications.<p>

Like the RV-M1, the Movemaster RV-M2 is designed for full-time, 24-hour operation. Integrated diagnostics functions ensure maximum reliability.<p>

This compact hand-held unit is used to program the positions of the Movemaster RV-M2, and to check each individual position to which the robot is to be moved. Each position is stored under a unique position number from 1 to 999. The teaching box can also be used to test the operation of the entire robot control program.  The teaching box is available as an optional extra.<p>

<A NAME="Drive Unit"></A>
<IMG SRC="http://www.rixan.com/mitsicon.gif" WIDTH=18 HEIGHT=18> <STRONG><FONT SIZE=+1> Drive Unit</FONT></STRONG><P>
This compact, modular power supply and control unit is an integral part of the Movemaster RV-M2 robot system. The drive unit contains a CPU and power electronics for controlling the robot, and is included with the system as standard equipment. Programs can be written on a PC and then transferred to the drive unit's RAM. The unit is fitted with two standard interfaces for PC connection.<p>

Flexibility and versatility in operation are the strong points of the Movemaster RV-M2 from Mitsubishi Electric. Its great freedom of movement and tremendous reach givethe RV-M2 a large work space. At the same time, the robot's design is still so compact that it only requires minimum space for effective operation.<p>
The Movemaster RV-M2's sturdy construction makes it highly resistant to heavy mechanical stresses during operation, and damage is prevented by an overload monitoring system. All drive elements are well protected against environmental influences, with thick sheet-metal covers over all transmissioncomponents. Internally routed pneumatics lines are installed as standard equipment, facillitating the installation and operation of the pneumatic hand.<P>
