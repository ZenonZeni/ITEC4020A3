<H3><I>The story of the first UA is retold to a meeting of UA coordinators in Brazil</I></H3>
Brazil, 9 December 1995; as Latin American Urgent
Action coordinators gather in São Paulo for a regional
meeting, there are three extra names on the guest list: Luiz Rossi,
María José Rossi and Tracy Ulltveit-Moe. Over the
next two days, the trio will transport the meeting back to a time,
more than two decades ago, when their lives became inextricably
linked.

<P><IMG SRC="pix/rossi.jpg" WIDTH="200" HEIGHT="257" BORDER="1" ALIGN="left" HSPACE="10" VSPACE="10">
S&atilde;o Paulo, Brazil, the night of 15 February
1973; heavily armed military police force their way into the home
of Luiz Basilio Rossi, Professor of Brazilian History at S&atilde;o
Paulo University, and without explanation, take him away into
the darkness. Now, more than 20 years on, he tells the gathered
UA coordinators how, <I>&quot;At the time, many people were being
arrested for political reasons and tortured to death or &quot;disappeared&quot;,
and I had a real fear that this would happen to me too.</I>&quot;

<P>The security forces return to the house, surround
it and even nail boards across the front door to prevent the professor's
wife, Mar&iacute;a Jos&eacute;, and three young daughters from
telling the world what has happened. &quot;<I>We couldn't get
out of the house</I>&quot;, recalls Mar&iacute;a Jos&eacute;,
&quot;<I>not even out to the street, so I had to write a note
to a neighbour without the police seeing</I>.&quot; Via a back
window and the neighbour's young daughter, the message is passed
to a priest, who in turn passes it on to the Bishop of Lins. 

<P>On the other side of the world - not yet &quot;shrunk&quot;
by computers, faxes and e-mail - a small organization called Amnesty
International has for some time been receiving disturbing reports
from Brazil telling of brutal state torture. The organization's
existing action techniques - with their cautious concentration
on prisoners of conscience (POCs) - are beginning to seem hopelessly
inadequate in the face of these horror stories. Tracy Ulltveit-Moe
was AI's Brazil researcher in 1973. She remembers: &quot;<I>We
invited one of our Brazilian contacts, who was in Paris at the
time, to come to London and meet with myself and Martin Ennals,
then Secretary General. We spent the entire weekend discussing
the problem and concluded that what we needed was a quick action
for prisoners in danger, irrespective of the POC issue. I suggested
the name &quot;URGENT ACTION&quot;, and the title stuck.</I>&quot;
More than that - a technique which over the next 23 years and
beyond would spawn millions of appeals on behalf of thousands
of individuals in many countries, was born.

<P>By now the Rossi family's smuggled message has reached
London where it finds Tracy at AI. The case of the Brazilian professor
abducted by the military in the middle of the night is set to
become AI's first &quot;Urgent Action&quot;. Details are typed
up and, on 19 March 1973, using names selected from a &quot;shoe
box&quot; of hand-written address cards, the UA is mailed out,
requesting immediate appeals in order to save the professor from
torture and possible &quot;disappearance&quot; or death.

<P>Two weeks later, Mar&iacute;a Jos&eacute; receives
a telegram ordering her to come to the military police (DOPS)
headquarters in Sao Paulo to &quot;identify her husband's body&quot;.
On arrival, however, she gets a glimpse of her husband alive!
She is also shown a pile of letters. Mar&iacute;a Jos&eacute;
still remembers how the DOPS Director told her &quot;<I>Your husband
must be a more important person than we thought, because we've
got all these letters from all over the world</I>&quot;. She is
forced to sign a letter stating that Luiz is alive and well and
not being tortured, and that the international action should stop.
The authorities send the fake letter to AI in London.

<P>However, as Mar&iacute;a Jos&eacute; now tells: &quot;<I>When
I got home I immediately wrote another letter to AI, telling the
real story, that Luiz had been tortured, but that several hundred
protest letters had arrived which I believed had saved his life.&quot;
</I>Two decades on, she remains firmly convinced of this: <I>&quot;In
my opinion, the intervention of AI was fundamental in saving Luiz
from further torture and worse. I got the impression from the
DOPS Director that he and the authorities were feeling under great
pressure from AI - pressure to produce the prisoner, to show him,
because he was getting so much publicity. Moreover, we were heartened
to know that people outside Brazil knew what was going on, that
they cared, and that they were prepared to do something about
it. It gave us great comfort and hope. I and my family felt lonely
and frightened and kindness from outsiders helped enormously.&quot;</I>

<P>Tracy, too, recalls the events with clarity: &quot;<I>I
have a very clear memory of the case - in AI they say you never
forget your first prisoner! When we received Mar&iacute;a Jos&eacute;'s
second letter, we were overjoyed and very emotional to think that
the Urgent Action had worked and that Luiz was safe&quot;.</I>

<P>
Luiz himself believes that the international appeals
were crucial: &quot;<I>The torturer aims to isolate you, to cut
all your links with the outside world. But AI was able to break
that isolation... Once the authorities know that other people
know you're there and what's happening to you, they are forced
to be more careful about how they treat you... When I saw my wife,
I knew that my case had become public, I knew they could no longer
kill me. Then the pressure on me decreased and conditions improved.</I>&quot;

<P>After his release, the family left Brazil and eventually
settled in Belgium. When they returned to Brazil years later, Mar&iacute;a Jos&eacute;
helped to set up an AI Health Professional's Network and was a
founding member of the AI group in Brasilia where they now live.

<P>S&atilde;o Paulo 10 December 1995, Human Rights Day:
the latest chapter in the story of the first UA closes with Professor
Rossi, by now wearing an Amnesty International UA T-shirt, hugging everyone
goodbye as he leaves the meeting: &quot;<I>I am an example of
your success and a symbol of the importance of continuing your
work. And I will write an Urgent Action appeal anytime - how can
I refuse!</I>&quot;
