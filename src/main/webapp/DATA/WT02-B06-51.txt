(1) FTC RECOMMENDS CHANGES TO PROTECT PERSONAL INFORMATION; RECOMMENDATIONS
    FOLLOW NETIZEN COMPLAINTS ABOUT P-TRAK

On Friday, September 20, 1996, the Federal Trade Commission recommended
that Congress take action to protect the privacy of personal information by
amending the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA).  The FTC's recommendations --
included in a letter to Sen. Richard Bryan (D-NV) -- come on the heels of
consumer outrage being expressed over the recently-released online database,
P-Trak, offered by the information service Lexis-Nexis.  

P-Trak provides personal information on millions of people across the
country.  For a fee of $85 per search, Lexis-Nexis subscribers can obtain
personal information about an individual that can include name, current and
prior addresses, maiden names, birth month and year, and current telephone
number.  In June, Lexis-Nexis stopped displaying Social Security numbers in
response to complaints from consumers and privacy advocates about the 
availability of that information.  However, P-Trak users can still search the
database by Social Security number.

A primary source for this personal information is credit reports from credit
bureaus, such as Equifax, Experian (formerly TRW), and TransUnion.  The
information is found in the header, or top, of a person's credit report.  
Under the current FCRA, credit bureaus may release and sell the type of 
information contained in the P-Trak database without limitation.  The FTC 
proposes amending the FCRA to prohibit the disclosure of certain personal
information by expanding the definition of "consumer report" to include "any
identifying information other than the consumer's name, generational 
designation, current address and telephone number."   

Currently most people are unaware of the vast amount of information that is 
generated, captured, used and disclosed during daily activities -- from the
membership card scanned in at the grocery store checkout, which neatly
tallies our purchases and spending habits, to departments of motor
vehicles which make a profit selling our personal information for
marketing and other purposes.  As the public learns of the collection and
use of personal information by the private sector -- information that is 
increasingly made available in electronic format -- pressure to address
privacy concerns will grow. 

As Congress moves to adjourn for the session at the end of the week, the 
Senate is currently considering amendments to the Fair Credit Reporting Act.
CDT believes adoption of the FTC's recommendations would be an important 
first step in acknowledging that individuals have a privacy interest in 
personal information such as social security numbers, prior addresses, and
maiden names.

To preserve privacy in the digital age, CDT believes that the core privacy
principles of notice and individual control over personal information must
inform both the design of the information infrastructure and public policy
decisions.  CDT supports Congressional approval of the FTC's recommendations
in response to the growing public concern over the loss of privacy.

the FTC response to Sen. Bryan and the FTC press release, links to press
