NEW PUBLIC HEALTH RESIDENCY LAUNCHED IN ST. LOUIS

The department of community medicine at St. Louis University School
of Medicine will soon be offering a new residency program in preventive
medicine/public health.  The two-year program, to begin operation in
July, will be open to individuals who hold a medical or equivalent
degree and who have completed one year of postgraduate clinical
training in an accredited residency program.

Establishing this residency will be SLU's way of helping to increase the
number of public health physicians who are in demand across the
country.  Rodney M. Coe, Ph.D., professor and chairman of the
department of community medicine, told Health Professions Report
that communities and government organizations at the city, county and
federal levels lack the needed public health manpower.  This gap is
especially apparent in rural areas, many of which have no physician at
all.

The program has already proven to be unique in several ways.  First, it
is the only preventive medicine/public health residency in Missouri.
Second, but perhaps more significant, is the program schedule.  Unlike
other programs where a year of classroom study is followed by up to
two years of practicums, this program will integrate the two phases.
Residents will do their practicums in coordination with subjects taught
in the classroom over a two-year period, rather than the usual three
years.

In addition to the public health residency, SLU has opened a residency
in occupational/environmental medicine.  Coe told Health Professions
Report that the two programs will be in close collaboration, sharing
many of the same SLU faculty.  The lecture portions of both programs
will be conducted at SLU's School of Public Health.  James R. Kimmey,
M.D., M.P.H., dean of the school, will serve as program director of the
new public health residency.

The practicum segment of the public health program will  be  provided
primarily  by   the Missouri  Department  of Health.  Corporate entities
such as the Monsanto chemical company will collaborate with SLU to
provide practicums for the occupational medicine residents.

At the beginning, each of the new residencies will have two openings in
each of the two years.  Dr. Coe told Health Professions Report that
SLU has already received inquiries from interested applicants from
other states, as well as local physicians who wish to pursue new careers
in public health.  The school is hoping that the new residency program
will really "catch on."

Residents who complete the public health program will be eligible to be
board certified in preventive medicine/public health.  The majority will
most likely be employed by government public health departments, at
the local, state or federal level, depending upon the extent of their
education.

Applications to both residencies are now being accepted.  For more
information, contact Kath Engelhardt, department of community
medicine, phone (314) 577-8527.

ASSOCIATION OF AMERICAN MEDICAL
COLLEGES, MEDICAL SCHOOLS PROVIDING STUDENTS
WITH DISABILITY COVERAGE

The Association of American Medical Colleges has reported success in
its efforts to help medical schools provide disability insurance to
students.  The impetus for the Association of American Medical
Colleges' initiative was the desire to protect students from the financial
devastation of HIV infection.  And although the Association points out
that the risk of a student acquiring HIV during clinical training is quite
low, students still need access to the basic benefits they don't currently
have, such as workman's compensation.

The Association's staff negotiated with insurance companies to create
disability plans that include the best features of group and individual
policies.  One of the attractive aspects of the plans is their guarantee
that students can both continue coverage after graduation and  purchase
increased  coverage,  without  medical  underwriting.

Robert F. Jones, Ph.D., assistant vice president for institutional studies
at the Association of American Medical Colleges, spearheaded the
organization's move to create these insurance plans.  "Our intention was
not to get into the insurance business but to prod the industry," Jones
explained.  "These companies deserve credit for coming through with
these programs when many dismissed the idea."

Although the threat of HIV transmission prompted the development of
these insurance plans, the broad-based policies will provide coverage for
any disabling condition, however acquired.  Residency and fellowship
programs are eligible to participate in the insurance plans as well.

Two insurance programs are now being marketed independently of the
Association.  One, offered through CM Financial Group of Chicago, is
underwritten by Connecticut Mutual and GroupAmerica.  The second,
marketed by the University Physicians Trust in Boston, has UNUM and
the United States Life company of New York as carriers.

Among the first institutions implementing the insurance are the medical
schools at New York University, Washington University at St. Louis,
Harvard University and Jefferson Medical College and the Medical
College of Wisconsin.

For more information, contact Dick Green at Association of American
Medical Colleges, phone (202) 828-0418.

DEMAND FOR OPTOMETRISTS GROWS BUT NUMBER OF
APPLICANTS AT A VIRTUAL STANDSTILL

The American Optometric Association has reported that despite growth
in the number of minority and women optometrists over the last few
years, the total number of students now studying optometry will not be
enough  to  fulfill  the  country's  future  eye  care needs.

According to Association, the expanding demand for optometrists is
expected to continue, because people of all ages require eye care.
However, there are particular segments of the population that will
contribute disproportionately to that demand.

The population of school age children are expected to multiply from
49.1 million in 1990 to 52.6 million by 2000. One out of five children has
a vision-related learning problem.

The group that includes adults ages 26-44 will remain relatively stable,
changing from 77.7 million in 1990 to only 77.6 million in 2000.
However, as the "baby-boomer" generation ages, the 45-64 age group
will increase from 46.8 million in 1990 to 61.7 million by 2000.  The
nation's workforce is comprised of both groups, 46 million of whom use
video display terminals, placing greater stress on their eyes.  The 40 and
older group will experience the onset of presbyopia, an age-related
condition which makes reading and up-close work difficult.

The segment of adults 65 years and older will grow from 31.6 million to
34.9 million during that same time period. Virtually everyone in this
group develops presbyopia. Older people in this group may also suffer
from cataracts (15.5%), glaucoma (two to three percent), and other
vision impairments.

Who will be caring for the eyes of all these people? According to
Association, fewer students are applying to schools of optometry than
six years ago. In 1986, there were 1.67 applicants for every available seat
in U.S. schools and colleges of optometry. That number declined to 1.49
applicants in 1989, and dropped even further in 1990, to a low of an
estimated 1.42 applicants. By 1991, the number of applicants competing
for each optometry seat had risen, if only slightly, to an estimated 1.52
per seat.

In addition to the slump in overall applications, minorities remain
underrepresented in optometry compared to their populations in
society, despite percentage gains over the last few years.  About one
percent of practicing optometrists are black, less than one percent are
Hispanic, about 0.2 percent are Native American and three to four
percent are Asian.

Fortunately, the diversity of the optometric student body has seen some
recent improvements. From 1979 to 1989, Asian students increased
from fewer than 4 percent of the student population to ten percent. The
number of Hispanic students grew from 1.5 percent to 3.3 percent. The
black student population doubled, from 1.4 percent to 2.8 percent. The
Native American presence in optometry schools tripled from 0.2 percent
to 0.6 percent.

While optometry still has a distance to go in recruiting and training
minority practitioners, the field is about to experience a boost in the
number of women eye care professionals. Of the 26,400 optometrists
currently practicing in the U.S., 4,200 or about 16% of them are women.
Of the current crop of optometric students, over 45% are women. By
2000, the number of practicing optometrists is expected to grow to
30,600, with women numbering 8,000, or 26% of that total.

The positive attributes of a career in optometry that are attracting more
women to the field are a selling point for any interested student. For
example:

* the average annual net income for optometrists is $70,000, while some
practitioners earn up to six-figure incomes;

* recent graduates earn an average of $40,000 in their first year in
practice;

optometrists average 40-hour work weeks, leaving time for family and
leisure;

* career opportunities other than private practices include teaching,
research, public health, the military, multidisciplinary practices, industry
consulting;

* optometrists may specialize in contact lenses, vision therapy, pediatric
optometry, geriatrics, low vision care for the visually impaired and
sports-related eye care;

the growing demand for optometry services creates a larger measure of
job security.

In 1990-91,  the  tuition  for  first-year  optometry  students  ranged
from  $4,342  for  in-state  residents  at public  schools  to  $12,763  for
out-of-state  residents  at private  schools.  These  figures  remain  about
the  same  for  the  succeeding  three  years  of  optometry  school.

The loan programs most commonly used by optometry students include
Perkins and Stafford loans; Health Professions Student Loans; Health
Education Assistance Loans; Supplemental Loans for Students, and
loans made directly from schools. During the 1990-91 academic year,
the Stafford loan program was most widely used by optometry students.

For more information about a career in optometry, contact the
American Optometric Association, 243 N. Lindbergh Blvd., St. Louis,
MO  63141, phone (314) 991-4100, or the Association of Schools and
Colleges of Optometry, phone (301) 231-5944.

BUSH PRESENTS BUDGET, CALLS TO END
FUNDING TO "UNTARGETED" PROGRAMS

The FY 93 budget proposal recently presented by the Bush
Administration includes $585 billion for the department of Health and
Human Services, which represents an increase of $41 billion (7.5%)
over FY 92. With the President calling for the termination of health
professions assistance grants in FY 93, and the elimination of over 200
domestic discretionary programs, it is no surprise that the "new blood"
in the Health and Human Services budget is not targeted toward health
professions education.

On the contrary, the budget document noted that "after two decades of
federal support, the aggregate shortage of health professionals
perceived in the 1960s when these subsidies were initiated, has abated."
The budget goes on to call for the elimination of federal funding to
"untargeted" health professions curriculum assistance programs.  So
what exactly will health professions be getting?

* Medicare/IME: Neither the budget itself nor the Health and Human
Services budget summary contain wording that would reduce Medicare
payments for graduate medical education.  In particular, there are no
provisions reducing the Medicare indirect medical education (IME)
adjustment or the Medicare direct graduate medical education
payments.

* National Health Service Corps: is slated to receive a $20 million
increase (19%), to a total of $120 million.  Of this amount, $65 million
would be available for scholarships and loan repayment.

* Health Career Opportunity Program: would receive an increase of $6
million, as part of a $96 million provision for programs specifically
targeted to health professions education for minorities.

* HIV/AIDS: The Public Health Service has been scheduled to receive
$2.069 billion for research, prevention and other related activities having
to do with these diseases. This funding level is $101 million more than
was apportioned in FY 92. A breakdown of some of the Public Health
Service components receiving HIV/AIDS funding includes the Food
and Drug Administration, $75 million; Health Resources and Services
Administration, $349 million; Indian Health Service, $3 million; Centers
for Disease Control, $505 million; National Institutes of Health, $873
million.

* National Institutes of Health: has been slated for $9.396 billion, an
increase of $443 million (4.9%) over FY 92. The budget proposes $5.277
billion for research project grants in FY 93, a $350 million (7.1%)
increase. This amount would provide funding for 5,800 new and
competing renewal research project grants and 22,132 total research
project grants. These figures show a decrease from the number of
projects funded in FY 92: 6,000 and 21,671 respectively. The budget
provided no funding increases for research centers, research training,
Research Centers in Minority Institutions, Minority Biomedical
Research Support grants or the Minority Access to Research Careers
programs.

* Community and Migrant Health Centers: received a 15% increase in
funding.

* Nursing: education programs failed to be funded again this year, but
the National Center for Nursing Research received $48.5 million.

* Veterans Administration: has been designated to receive $34.3 billion
for FY 93, an increase of $1 billion for the third consecutive year.  Of
that amount, $58.6 million will be used to hire additional health care
professionals.

be distributed as follows: Historically Black Colleges and Universities,
$12,092,527; Hispanic COEs, $1,456,107; Native American COEs,
$996,324.  Approximately $9.6 million will be available to support about
45 competing awards averaging $210,000.  Payments under grants for
COEs may not exceed three years.

Grants awarded under this program may be used to establish,
strengthen or expand programs to enhance the academic performance
of minority students attending the school; establish, strengthen or
expand programs to increase the number and quality of minority
applicants to the school; to improve the capacity of such schools to train,
recruit and retain minority faculty; to carry out activities to improve the
information resources and curricula of the school and clinical education
at the school with respect to minority health issues, and to facilitate
faculty and student research on health issues particularly affecting
minority groups.

In addition, grants for eligible Historically Black Colleges and
Universities may also be used to develop a plan to achieve institutional
improvements, including financial independence, and to improve library
access. Applicants must address at least three of these five legislative
purposes.

To qualify as a Center Of Excellence, a school is required to have a
significant number of minority individuals enrolled in the school,
including individuals accepted for enrollment in the school; demonstrate
that it has been effective in assisting minority students of the school to
complete the program of education and receive the degree involved;
show that it has been effective in recruiting minority individuals to
attend the school, including providing scholarships and other financial
assistance to such individuals, and encouraging minority students of
secondary educational institutions to attend the health professions
school, and demonstrate that it has made significant recruitment efforts
to increase the number of minority individuals serving in faculty or
administrative positions at the school.  For the purposes of this
program, "health professions schools" are defined as schools of
medicine, dentistry and pharmacy.  Applicants will be expected to
incorporate the principles of Healthy People 2000 in their proposals.

Funding preference will be given to applications scoring in the upper
40th percentile or better, submitted by schools located in states which
do not currently have a Center Of Excellence in that discipline.  The
proposed funding preference does not preclude funding of other eligible
approved applications.

LOYOLA SURGEONS PIONEER USE OF
LAPAROSCOPY FOR TRAUMA DIAGNOSIS

Surgeons at the Loyola University Medical Center and Hines Veterans
Administration Hospital are pioneering the diagnostic use of the
laparoscope in emergency medicine, and expanding its use to include
kidney removal and other surgeries.  These innovations are evolving
along with the development of the Medical Center's Laparoscopic
Surgery Center.

The goals of the new center are to train specialists and students in
laparoscopic techniques, research and develop new applications of the
laparoscope and provide a liaison between surgeons and manufacturers
to assist in the development of new surgical devices.  A key component
of the center will be an education and research facility which will allow
faculty to integrate laparoscopy principles and techniques into the
education of surgical residents and students, as well as providing
advances courses for surgeons.

Laparoscopy is currently being used for appendix removal,
cholecystectomy, bile duct exploration and lymph node biopsy.  Other
procedures to which the laparoscope will soon be applied include kidney
removal, colon resection, vagotomy, Nissen fundoplication and hernia
repair.

One of the major breakthroughs in laparoscopy, the diagnosis of
internal injury in trauma patients, has been advanced by Dr. Wendy J.
Marshall, trauma director, and Dr. Christopher K. Salvino.  The
surgeons have shown in an ongoing, randomized study that the
laparoscope is highly effective in evaluating abdominal injuries resulting
from trauma such as stab wounds, auto accidents and assault.

Salvino explained that before the laparoscope, internal bleeding was
detected by a diagnostic lavage -- or needle inserted into the abdomen.
The lavage is not accurate enough to pinpoint the location of the
bleeding, and needs to be confirmed by using a CAT scan.  These two
procedures can consume precious time, and may necessitate moving an
unstable patient.

Laparoscopy combines the best of both procedures, indicating the
source of the bleeding and often enabling surgery to be performed
immediately. The Loyola study has indicated that laparoscopy may
sometimes even eliminate unnecessary surgery, because about 20% of
patients who test positive for bleeding by the lavage method actually
stop bleeding prior to surgery.

Other new uses for the laparoscope still being tested in the lab include
using the method to insert feeding tubes into stomachs of patients
unable to eat; internally stapling stab wounds to stop bleeding, and
injecting fibrin glue to control hemorrhaging.
