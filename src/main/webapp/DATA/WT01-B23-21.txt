<p><b>THE FORBIDDEN FRUIT AND THE TREE OF KNOWLEDGE: AN INQUIRY
INTO THE LEGAL HISTORY OF AMERICAN MARIJUANA PROHIBITION</b> </p>

<p><font size="5"><b>III. THE GENESIS OF MARIJUANA PROHIBITION</b></font>
</p>

<hr>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Until the inclusion of marijuana in the Uniform Narcotic Drug
Act in 1932 and the passage of the Marihuana Tax Act in 1937,
there was no &quot;national&quot; public policy regarding the
drug. However, as early as 1914 the New York City Sanitary Laws
included cannabis in a prohibited drug list and in 1915 Utah
passed the first state statute prohibiting sale or possession of
the drug. By 1931 twenty-two states had enacted such legislation.
In the succeeding section, we shall delve into the circumstances
surrounding the passage of several of these early laws and the
ensuing judicial acquiescence in the legislative value judgments
concerning marijuana. We conclude that the legislative action and
approval were essentially kneejerk responses uninformed by
scientific study or public debate and colored instead by racial
bias and sensationalistic myths. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>A. Initial State Legislation 1914-1931</b> </p>

<p>As indicated above, the Harrison Act, a regulatory measure in
the garb of a taxing statute, left many gaps unfilled in the
effort to prohibit illegal or nonmedical use of opiates and
cocaine. Although Commissioner Anslinger of the Federal Bureau of
Narcotics stated in 1932 that few states had responded to the
Harrison Act,1 most states had in fact enacted or reenacted
narcotics laws in the period from 1914 to 1931.2 In so doing,
twenty-one states had also restricted the sale of marijuana as
part of their general narcotics articles, one state had
prohibited its use for any purpose, and four states had outlawed
its cultivation.3 Our objective in this section is to determine
why these states chose to include cannabis in their lists of
prohibited drugs. </p>

<p>The first consideration was the increasing public awareness of
the narcotics problem. As noted above, the Harrison Act
engendered a shift in public perception of the narcotics addict.
With ever-increasing frequency and venom, he was portrayed in the
public media as the criminal &quot;dope fiend.&quot; This
hysteria, coupled with the actual increases in drug-related
criminal conduct due to the closing of the clinics,4 was the
basis for a good many of the post-Harrison Act narcotic
statutes.5 Other forces such as lurid accounts in the media,6
publications of private narcotics associations 7 and the
effective separation of the addict and his problems from the
medical profession8 all pressed legislatures into action to deal
more effectively with what was perceived as a growing narcotics
problem. </p>

<p>Despite the increasing public interest in the narcotics
problem during this period, we can find no evidence of public
concern for, or understanding of, marijuana, even in those states
that banned it along with the opiates and cocaine. Observers in
the middle and late 1930's agreed that marijuana was at that time
a very new phenomenon on the national scene.9 The perplexing
question remains-why did some states include marijuana in their
prohibitive legislation a decade before it achieved any notice
whatsoever from the general public and the overwhelming majority
of legislators? </p>

<p>From a survey of contemporary newspaper and periodical
commentary we have concluded that there were three major
influences. The most prominent was racial prejudice. During this
period, marijuana legislation was generally a regional phenomenon
present in the southern and western states. Use of the drug was
primarily limited to Mexican-Americans who were immigrating in
increased numbers to those states. These movements were well
noted in the press accounts of passage of marijuana legislation.
A second factor was the assumption that marijuana, which was
presumed to be an addictive drug, would be utilized as a
substitute for narcotics and alcohol then prohibited by national
policy. This factor was particularly significant in the New York
law, the forerunner of nationwide anti-marijuana legislation.
Finally, there is some evidence that coverage of the drug by the
Geneva Conventions in 1925 was publicized in this country and may
have had some influence. </p>

<p><b>1. Rationale in the West: Class Legislation</b> </p>

<p>Geometric increases in Mexican immigration after the turn of
the century naturally resulted in the formation of sizeable
Mexican-American minorities in each western state.10 It was
thought then11 and is generally assumed now12 that use of
marijuana west of the Mississippi was limited primarily to the
Mexican segment of the population. We do not find it surprising,
therefore, that sixteen of these states prohibited sale or
possession of marijuana before 1930.13 Whether motivated by
outright prejudice or simple discriminatory disinterest, the
result was the same in each legislature-little if any public
attention, no debate, pointed references to the drug's Mexican
origins, and sometimes vociferous allusion to the criminal
conduct inevitably generated when Mexicans ate &quot;the killer
weed.&quot; </p>

<p>In Utah, for example, the nation's first statewide prohibition
of marijuana 14 in 1915 was attended by little publicity. The
combination of increasing Mexican immigration15 and the
traditional aversion of the Mormons to euphoriants of any kind16
led inevitably to the inclusion of marijuana in the state's
omnibus narcotics and pharmacy bill. Similarly, when the New
Mexico and Texas legislatures passed marijuana legislation in
1923, the former by separate statute17 and the latter by
inclusion,18 newspaper reference was minimal despite coverage in
both states of legislative action.19 The longest of the Santa Fe
New Mexican references noted: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>The Santa Fe representative, however, had better luck with
    his bill to prevent sale of marihuana, cannabis indica,
    Indian hemp or hashish as it is variously known. This bill
    was passed without any opposition. Marihuana was brought into
    local prominence at the penitentiary board's investigation
    last summer when a convict testified he could get marihuana
    cigarets anytime he had a dollar. The drug produces
    intoxication when chewed or smoked. Marihuana is the name
    commonly used in the Southwest and Mexico.20 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>In its only direct reference to marijuana, the Austin Texas
Statesman stated: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>The McMillan Senate Bill amended the anti-narcotic law so
    as to make unlawful the possession for the purpose of sale of
    any marihuana or other drugs. Marihuana is a Mexican herb and
    is said to be sold on the Texas-Mexican border .21 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The discriminatory aspects of this early marijuana
legislation, suggested only obliquely by origin and apparent
disinterest in Utah, New Mexico and Texas, are directly confirmed
in Montana and Colorado. Montana newspapers gave relatively
&quot;full&quot; coverage to a proposal to exclude marijuana from
the general narcotics law and to create a separate marijuana
statute.22 On seven different days from January 14 to February
10, 1929 (the date of the bill's passage), the Montana Standard
succinctly noted the progress of the bill through the
legislature. The giveaway appeared on January 27 when the paper
recorded the following: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>There was fun in the House Health Committee during the
    week when the Marihuana bill came up for consideration.
    Marihuana is Mexican opium, a plant used by Mexicans and
    cultivated for sale by Indians. &quot;When some beet field
    peon takes a few rares of this stuff,&quot; explained Dr.
    Fred Fulsher of Mineral County, &quot;He thinks he has just
    been elected president of Mexico so he starts out to execute
    all his political enemies. I understand that over in Butte
    where the Mexicans often go for the winter they stage
    imaginary bullfights in the 'Bower of Roses' or put on
    tournaments for the favor of 'Spanish Rose' after a couple of
    whiffs of Marijuana. The Silver Bow and Yellowstone
    delegations both deplore these international
    complications&quot; Everybody laughed and the bill was
    recommended for passage.23 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The same year, a change in Colorado's marijuana law was
precipitated by less comic apprehensions of the drug's evil
effects. On April 7, 1929, a girl was murdered by her Mexican
step-father. The story was lead news in the Denver Post every day
until April 16, probably because the girl's mother was white. On
the 16th it was first mentioned that this man might have been a
marijuana user. Headlined &quot;Fiend Slayer Caught in Nebraska
[;] Mexican Confesses Torture of American Baby,&quot; and
subheaded &quot;Prisoner Admits to Officer He is Marihuana
Addict,&quot; the story, relates in full the underlying events: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>&quot;You smoke marihuana?&quot; </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>&quot;Yes &quot; </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>The Mexican said he had been without the weed for two days
    before the killing of his step-daughter .24 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>On April 17, the story on the Mexican included the following: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>He repeated the story he had told the Sidney Chief of
    Police regarding his addiction to marihuana saying that his
    supply of the weed had become exhausted several days before
    the killing and his nerves were unstrung.25 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>With regard to the legislative news there is no mention at any
time of a bill to regulate marijuana; however, on April 21, the
Denver Post noted the Governor had signed a bill increasing
penalties for sale, possession or production of marijuana.26 </p>

<p>The reader should note that public perception of marijuana's
ethnic origins and crime-producing tendencies often went hand in
hand, especially in the more volatile areas of the western
states. Stories such as the one appearing in the Denver Post,
where defendants charged with violent crimes attempted to blame
their actions on the effects of marijuana were primarily
responsible for the drug's characterization as a &quot;killer
weed.&quot; In any event, from this brief survey of marijuana
prohibition in the western states, we have concluded that its
Mexican use pattern was ordinarily enough to warrant its
prohibition, and that whatever attention such legislative action
received was attended by sensationalist descriptions of crimes
allegedly committed by Mexican marijuana users. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>2. Rationale in the East: Substitution</b> </p>

<p>The first significant27 instance of marijuana regulation
appeared in the 1914 amendments to the New York City Sanitary
Laws. The inclusion by the New York legislature of marijuana in
Its general narcotics statute in 1927 was the precursor of
nationwide legislation .28 For these reasons, we have chosen New
York as the most likely source of information regarding the.
rationale for marijuana prohibition in Maine, Massachusetts,
Michigan, Ohio, Rhode Island and Vermont, all of which had acted
before 1931.29 </p>

<p>In January 1914 the New York legislature passed its first
comprehensive statute-The Boylan Bill-regulating the sale and use
of habit forming drugs&quot;' and did not include marijuana among
its list of prohibited narcotics. It appears that the Board of
Health of New York City then amended its Sanitary Code adding
&quot;Cannabis indica, which is the Indian hemp from which the
East Indian drug called hashish is manufactured,&quot;31 to the
City's list of prohibited drugs. Violation of this provision of
the City Sanitary Code was a misdemeanor punishable by a small
fine and/or a jail term of up to six months. On July 29, 1914, an
article reporting the amendment appeared in the New York Times
wherein the drug was described: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>This narcotic has practically the same effect as morphine
    and cocaine, but it was not used in this country to any
    extent while it was easy to get the more refined narcotics.32
    </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The next day the editors of the Times commented: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>[T]he inclusion of cannabis indica among the drugs to be
    sold only on prescription is only common sense. Devotees of
    hashish are now hardly numerous enough here to count, but
    they are likely to increase as other narcotics become harder
    to obtain.33 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>From these observations, it would appear (1) that there were
few marijuana users at the time; and (2) that use of the drug was
expected to increase as a direct result of the restriction of
opiates and cocaine. </p>

<p>Despite New York City's early classification of cannabis with
known narcotics, New York State did not prohibit sale and
possession of the drug for other than medicinal purposes until
1927.34 And this was true despite a great deal of activity on the
narcotics front from 1914 to 1927, when the legislature acted
four different times.35 Throughout all this tumult and in the
variety of narcotics proposals suggested or enacted,36 marijuana
or cannabis was not classified among the restricted drugs until
the drafting of the 1927 Act. This act37 defined cannabis as a
&quot;habit-forming drug,&quot; 38 and accordingly punished as
misdemeanors39 the control, sale, distribution, administration
and dispensing40 of cannabis except for medical purposes. The
penalty provision of the statute did not discriminate among types
of offenses, first or subsequent violations, or the prohibited
narcotic drugs.41 </p>

<p>There is no apparent indication in the contemporary commentary
of the reasons for inclusion of marijuana in the New York laws.
When the 1927 law was passed, public concern was focused on the
general need to reduce narcotic addiction; none of the
commentators were concerned about marijuana.42 While there were
numerous articles in the media dealing with the problems of the
opiates, morphine, cocaine and heroin, only four articles about
marijuana appeared in the major New York newspaper during the
entire period from 1914 until 1927. In 1923 the New York Times
noted that the &quot;latest habit forming drug ... marihuana,
which is smoked in a cigarette&quot; was exhibited at a women's
club meeting.43 In 1925 the same paper reported that the drug had
been banned in Mexico.44 One year later, the paper reported the
results of testing in Panama on the effects of marijuana. The
article noted that as a result of these tests the study group
concluded marijuana smoking was relatively safe; thus, it was
&quot;recommended that no steps be taken by the authorities of
the Canal Zone to prevent the sale or use of marijuana and that
no special legislation on that subject was needed.&quot; 45
Finally, in July 1927, the Times reported that a Mexican family
was said to have gone insane from eating marijuana.46 Perhaps the
clearest indication of the absence of notice given the marijuana
section of the 1927 Act is that none of the articles discussing
the Act after its passage refer to marijuana .47 </p>

<p>It is likely, then, that the inclusion of cannabis in the
state law was motivated primarily by the same fear that had
provoked the Sanitary Law Amendment in 1914. Use, though still
slight, was expected to increase. Throughout the entire New York
experience the main argument was preventive: Marijuana use must
be prohibited to keep addicts from switching to it as a
substitute for the drugs which had become much more difficult to
obtain after the enactment of the Harrison Act, and for alcohol
after Prohibition.48 Accordingly, the passage of the Harrison and
Volstead Acts were direct causes of the preventive inclusion of
marijuana among prohibited drugs. In fact, it has been observed
that marijuana use did increase during this period .49 </p>

<p>Another factor that may have influenced the passage of the
1927 Act was the Second Opium Conference at Geneva in 1925,50
which included Indian hemp within the Convention against Opium
and other Dangerous Drugs, even though the United States had
withdrawn in 1925 from the League of Nations deliberations on
controlling and regulating the international traffic in dangerous
drugs.51 </p>

<hr>

<p><b>3. The International Scene</b> </p>

<p>The first mention of marijuana on the international front came
with the preliminary negotiations for the Hague Conference of
1912. In preparing for this Conference, which represented an
attempt to deal with the international opium traffic, the
government of Italy proposed that the production and traffic in
Indian hemp drugs be included as part of the agenda of the
Conference.52 During the Conference itself, there was no mention
of the drug, and the Convention did not include cannabis in its
provisions. In addition to the Convention, however, the delegates
signed a closing protocol: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>2. The Conference considers it desirable to study the
    question of Indian hemp from the statistical and scientific
    point of view, with the object of regulating its abuses,
    should the necessity thereof be felt, by internal legislation
    or by an international agreement .53 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>It was not until just before the Geneva Conference of 1925
that the proposal was mentioned again. In 1923 the following
resolution was passed by the Advisory Committee on Traffic in
Opium and Other Dangerous Drugs of the League of Nations: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>IV. With reference to the proposal of the Government of
    the Union of South Africa that Indian hemp should be treated
    as one of the habit-forming drugs, the Advisory Committee
    recommends the Council that, in the first instance, the
    Governments should be invited to furnish to the League
    information as to the production and use of, and traffic in,
    this substance in their territories, together with their
    observations on the proposal of the Government of the Union
    of South Africa .54 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>At the 1925 meeting in Geneva, the Egyptians led the way in
proposing that hashish be included within the Convention.55 An
Egyptian delegate presented a paper on the effects and use of
hashish in Egypt. Mr. El Guindy's study is so typical of the
so-called scientific or empirical evidence that has been
presented to justify the drug's prohibition that the following
excerpt must be included. In stating that the real danger of
hashish is that it will produce insanity, the Egyptian delegate
presented the following: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>The illicit use of hashish is the principal cause of most
    of the cases of insanity occurring in Egypt. In support of
    this contention, it may be observed that there are three
    times as many cases of mental alienation among men as among
    women, and it is an established fact that men are much more
    addicted to hashish than women.56 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Egyptian proposal was referred to a subcommittee for study
and later in the Conference this group reported that the use of
Indian hemp drugs should be limited to medical and scientific
purposes. The proceedings contain no record of what medical or
scientific evidence might have been brought forward to support
the inclusion of the Indian hemp drugs in the Convention.57
Nevertheless, they were the subject of Chapters IV and V of the
Convention.58 </p>

<hr>

<p><b>4. Conclusion</b> </p>

<p>The early laws against the cannabis drugs were passed with
little public attention. Concern about marijuana was related
primarily to the fear that marijuana use would spread, even among
whites, as a substitute for the opiates and alcohol made more
difficult to obtain by federal legislation. Especially in the
western states, this concern was identifiable with the growth of
the Mexican-American minority. It is clear that no state
undertook any empirical or scientific study of the effects of the
drug. Instead they relied on lurid and often unfounded accounts
of marijuana's dangers as presented in what little newspaper
coverage the drug received. It was simply assumed that cannabis
was addictive and would have engendered the same evil effects as
opium and cocaine. Apparently, legislators in these states found
it easy and uncontroversial to prohibit use of a drug they had
never seen or used and which was associated with ethnic
minorities and the lower class. </p>

<hr>

<p align="center"><b>B. Judicial Corroboration</b> </p>

<p>Two significant conclusions appear from a study of the few
cases59 involving convictions for marijuana offenses under the
initial wave of state laws. First, the argument regarding a
private conduct limitation on the police power had been so
discredited it was not even made. Second, the courts, like the
legislatures, relied on nonscientific materials to support the
proposition that marijuana was an addictive, mind-destroying drug
productive of crime and insanity. </p>

<p>In only one case was there a serious constitutional challenge
to the validity of the legislation. Appealing a Louisiana
conviction for possession of five hundred plants of marijuana,
the defendant in State v. Bonoa60 argued not that the state could
not punish mere possession but rather that the statute was
overbroad, since aside from its use as an intoxicant the
marijuana plant was employed in the manufacture of hemp line, in
the preparation of useful drugs and for the production of bird
seed for canaries. Defendant's contention was that only
possession, sale or use for deleterious purposes could be
prohibited. </p>

<p>The court's reply was that the drug's deleterious properties
outweighed its uses, especially since &quot; [t]he Marijuana
plant is not one of the crops of this state.&quot; 61 Defendant
also offered the reductio ad absurdum argument that if possession
of the marijuana plant may be prohibited simply because
intoxicating resin may be extracted from the flowering tops, then
the possession of corn or grapes may be prohibited because
whiskey and wine may be made from them, or possession of poppies
because opium may be extracted from them. To this the court
replied that alcohol was less injurious than marijuana and that
both alcohol and opium were difficult to prepare from these
sources while the marijuana plant was easily converted into
tobacco and cigarettes. </p>

<p>The court's reasoning is admirable if we accept the basic
premise that the marijuana drug is deleterious. To support this
conclusion the court quoted from Solis Cohen Githens'
Pharmacotheraupeutics: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>The first symptom is usually an exaltation of the mind . .
    . . The ideas are joyous Sleep follows . . . . When aroused
    from sleep . . . the mind passes into the same somnolent
    condition, which lasts for several hours and is followed by a
    sense of weakness and extreme mental depression. In certain
    eastern people . . . perhaps because of continued use, the
    somnolent action is replaced by complete loss of judgment and
    restraint such as is seen more often from alcohol. An Arab
    leader, fighting against the crusaders, had a bodyguard who
    partook of haschisch, and used to rush madly on their
    enemies, slaying everyone they met. The name of
    &quot;haschischin&quot; applied to them has survived as
    &quot;assassin.&quot; </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>The habitual use of cannabis does not lead to much
    tolerance, nor do abstinence symptoms follow its withdrawal.
    It causes, however, a loss of mentality, resembling dementia,
    which can be recognized even in dogs.62 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The court also quotes Rusby, Bliss &amp; Ballard, The
Properties and Uses of Drugs: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>The particular narcosis of cannabis consists in the
    liberation of the imagination from all restraint . . . . Not
    rarely, in [the depression] state, an irresistible impulse to
    the commission of criminal acts will be experienced.
    Occasionally an entire group of men under the influence of
    this drug will rush out to engage in violent or bloody
    deeds.63 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>On these two sources, the entire opinion stands. The allegedly
deleterious consequences-criminal activity and insanity-are
supported only by the mythical etymology of the word
&quot;assassin.&quot; The marijuana user's purported propensity
toward crime, based on similar and often weaker authority, was
the primary rationale underlying passage of the Marihuana Tax
Act.64 So preposterous is this assertion that even the proponents
of criminalization-including the Cormmissioner of the Bureau of
Narcotics-later implicitly rejected it.65 </p>

<p>In any event, the courts were as willing to accept such
evidence as the legislatures. In a Utah case, State v. Navaro,66
where the court cited the acknowledged evils of marijuana to
repel a vagueness attack,67 it relied on another set of dubious
authorities. First, the court referred to the case of State v.
Diaz68 wherein a defendant in a first degree murder prosecution
tried to disprove the requisite mens rea by showing that he was
under the influence of marijuana at the time of the offense. Diaz
had claimed that &quot;his mind was an entire blank as to all
that happened to him and stated that after smoking the marijuana
he became 'very crazy.' To corroborate his assertion, defendant
summoned a physician whose testimony was summarized in Diaz in a
passage quoted in full in Navaro: </p>

<p>He stated that [marijuana] is a narcotic and acts upon the
central nervous system affecting the brain, producing
exhilarating effects and causing one to do things which he
otherwise would not do and especially induces acts of violence;
that violence is one of the symptoms of an excessive use of
marijuana. That the marihuana produces an &quot;I don't
care&quot; effect. A man having used liquor and marihuana might
deliberately plan a robbery and killing and carry it out and
escape, and then later fail to remember anything that had
occurred. 70 </p>

<p>Thus an attempt in an adversary setting by an accused to
escape criminal responsibility by blaming his offense on
marijuana intoxication became medical authority for the
scientific hypothesis that marijuana use causes crime. </p>

<p>The second source of support in Navaro for the allegedly
deleterious effects of marijuana was a 1932 article by Hayes and
Bowery (the latter a member of the Wichita, Kansas, Police
Department) entitled Marihuana .71 Calling for stricter penalties
for marijuana use, the authors stated that during the
exhilaration phase, the user is likely to have increased sexual
desires72 and to commit &quot;actions of uncontrollable violence,
or even murder.&quot; 73 For these propositions, they cited
newspaper accounts of crimes the causes of which the reporter
attributed to marijuana74 and police testimony to the same
effect.75 For example, the Chief Detective of the Los Angeles
Police Department was quoted as saying: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>In the past we have had officers of this department shot
    and killed by Marihuana addicts and <i>have traced the act of
    murder directly to the influence of Marihuana, with no other
    motive</i>. Numerous assaults have been made upon officers
    and citizens with intent to kill by Marihuana addicts which
    were directly traceable to the influence of Marihuana.76 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>It should be noted that Hayes and Bowery attributed the
violent impulse to the absence of restraint engendered during the
so-called exhilaration phase, while each of the authorities cited
by the Louisiana court in Bonoa attributed the same impulse to
the sufferings experienced during the &quot;depression&quot;
phase.77 </p>

<p>The authors also asserted that habitual use leads to a
&quot;loss of mental activity, accompanied by a general dullness
and indolence, like that of chronic alcoholics or opium
caters,&quot; to &quot;destruction of brain tissues&quot; and
inevitably to insanity. For this proposition, the authors merely
said that &quot;seventeen to twenty per cent of all males
admitted to mental hospitals and asylums in India have become
insane through the use of this drug.&quot;78 </p>

<p>Finally the court cited an article by Eugene Stanley, the
District Attorney of New Orleans, entitled Marihuana as a
Developer of Crimiinals.79 The title conveys the message. We will
return to Mr. Stanley in the succeeding section.80 </p>

<p>The nonchalance with which Utah and Louisiana courts cited
sensationalistic, nonscientific sources to support the
proposition that marijuana produced crime and insanity suggests
how widely accepted this hypothesis was among decision-makers,
both judicial and legislative, prior to 1931. Given the
prevalence of this attitude, the noninvolvement of the middle
class, and the precedent established in the earlier alcohol and
narcotics cases, it is not surprising that constitutional
challenges were either not made or easily rebuffed. Nor is it
surprising that challenges regarding the ambiguity of the word
&quot;marijuana&quot; were unsuccessful.81 The courts, like the
legislatures, assumed marijuana caused crime and insanity, and
assumed that had public opinion crystallized on the question, it
would have favored the suppression of a drug with such evil
effects.<br>

Act Hearings]. </p>

<p>10 The Bureau of Immigration recorded the entry of 590,765
Mexicans into the United States between 1915 and 1930. Of these,
upwards of 90% in each year were to be resident in the 22 states
west of the Mississippi, and more than two-thirds were to reside
in Texas alone. Information compiled from Tables, Immigrant
Aliens, By States of Intended Future Residence and Race or

<p>14 At its 1915 session, the Utah legislature passed an omnibus
narcotics and pharmacy bill which included under it the cannabis
drugs. Ch. 66, §§ 7, 8, [1915] Utah Laws 77. The law forbade
sale and possession of the named drugs, and provided for medical
use under a system of prescriptions and order blanks.
Interestingly, clinical treatment of addicts was allowed. Id. at
77-80. The law also prohibited possession of opium and marijuana
pipes. Id. at 80. Violations were misdemeanors punishable by
fines and/or imprisonment for terms up to six months, but third
offenders faced prison terms from one to five years. The statute
made no distinction between sale and possession, nor among the
various drugs. The law was revised in 1927. Ch. 65, [1927]1 Utah
Laws 107. </p>

<p>15 See note 10 supra. </p>

<p>16 See THE DOCTRINE AND COVENANTS OF THE CHURCH OF JESUS
CHRIST OF LATTER-DAY SAINTS, CONTAINING THE REVELATIONS GIVEN TO
JOSEPH SMITH, THE PROPHET § 89, at 154 (192 1) (PP, P 5, 7, wine
or strong drink) (P 8, tobacco) (P 9, hot drinks) (revelations
given through Joseph Smith the Prophet, at Kirtland, Ohio,
February, 27, 1833, known as the Word of Wisdom). </p>

<p>17 The statute made importation of cannabis illegal and
established a presumption of importation whenever a person was
found to possess the drug. Ch. 42, § § 1-2, [1923] N.M. Laws
58-59. Violations were punishable by fine and/or imprisonment
from one to three years. Cultivation, sale or giving away
cannabis except for use by physicians and pharmacists was also
prohibited, and violations were punishable on first offense by
one to three years in prison and on subsequent offenses by three
to five years imprisonment. Id. §§ 3, 4. </p>

<p>18 The Texas general narcotics statute, ch. 150, [1919] Tex.
Gen. Laws 277-79, as amended, ch. 61, [1919] Tex. Special Sess.
Laws 156-57, similar in format to the Utah statute and the
Harrison Act, included &quot;any drug or preparation known or
sold under the Spanish name of 'Marihuana........... Id. at 278.
Unlike the Utah and New Mexico statutes, Texas prohibited only
selling, furnishing or giving away marijuana. Except for the
exempted medical purposes, such divestment of any of the listed
narcotics could have resulted in a fine and/or imprisonment from
one month to one year. Id. at 279. </p>

<p>19 The Santa Fe New Mexican, hometown paper of the bill's
sponsor, made only one mention of marijuana at the time of
passage, and that was to note that the drug was being smuggled
into the state prisons. Santa Fe New Mexican, Feb. 1, 1923. </p>

<p>The Austin Texas Statesman gave heavy coverage to legislative
news at this time because the legislature was in special session
called by the Governor to deal with a budgetary problem. </p>

<p>20 Santa Fe New Mexican, Jan. 31, 1923. The statute was passed
on February 27, 1923; during the period from January 20 to
February 28, there were only three other references to marijuana.
The newspaper first noted the bill in a one sentence report that
a ban on sale of marijuana was to be discussed. Id., Jan. 20,
1923. Finally, in articles entitled &quot;A Day In The
Legislature,&quot; the progress of the bill (H.B. 56) was noted
on February 21 and 27 in simple lists of bills enacted. Id., Feb.
21, 27, 1923. So inconsequential was the bill that it was not
even mentioned in two stories describing the activities of the
legislature for that session. Id., Feb. 27, 1923, at 1, col. 1. </p>

<p>21 Austin Texas Statesman, June 19, 1923. Despite heavy
coverage of legislative news and of narcotics generally, the El
Paso Times made no reference to marijuana between June 10 and
June 25. The Texas Statesman mentioned the &quot;McMillan
Bill&quot; only two other times, each time without direct
reference to marijuana. </p>

<p>22 Unlike most states that passed laws early in the 1920's
against marijuana use, Montana in 1927 passed a statute which
merely amended the first section of its general narcotic law,
Rev. Code of Mont. ch. 227, S 3186 (1921), to include marijuana.
Ch. 91, § 1, [ 1927] Mont. Laws 324. The new law, ch. 6, [1929]
Mont. Laws 5, made use, sale or possession without a prescription
a misdemeanor. </p>

<p>23 The Montana Standard, Jan. 27, 1929, at 3, col. 2. 24
Denver Post, April 16, 1929, at 2, col. 1. </p>

<p>25 Id., April 17,1929, at 2, col. 1. </p>

<p>26 Id., April 21, 1929. Ch. 95, (1927] Colo. Laws 309,
penalized possession, sale, gift, or cultivation of any of the
cannabis drugs as a misdemeanor. Offenses carried a fine and/or
imprisonment in the county jail for not less than one or more
than six months. The new law, ch. 93, [1929] Colo. Laws 331,
increased the penalties for second offenders to one to five year
terms in the penitentiary. </p>

<p>27 Although Commissioner Anslinger stated in the 1937 Tax Act
Hearings that the District of Columbia had no law regulating
marijuana, Dr. Woodward of the AMA refuted the Commissioner's
statement by citing a 1906 provision which limited the sale of
cannabis to pharmacists and regulated sale of the drug by such
pharmacists to the public. Tax Act Hearings 92-93. The D.C.
provision, Act of May 7, 1906, ch. 2084, § 13, 34 Star. 175, is
typical of early attempts to deal with the drug under the general
poison laws, but it is noteworthy in its treatment of marijuana
separately from opiates. </p>

<p>28 See pp. 10 30-3 3 infra. </p>

<p>29 In 1913, Maine prohibited the sale of cannabis indica
without a prescription. STATE LAWS 137. Massachusetts passed a
similar law in 1917, id. at 150, and Michigan forbade possession
in 1929, id. at 161. A 1923 Ohio law prohibited sale or
possession with intent to sell, id. at 242; Rhode Island
prohibited sale in 1918, id. at 263; and Vermont barred sale
without a prescription in 1915, id. at 296. </p>

<p>31 Ch. 363, [1914] N.Y. Laws 1120. The first narcotics
legislation in New York was enacted in 1893. Ch. 661, art. XII,
§208, 11893] N.Y. Laws 1561. The 1893 law provided that no
prescription containing opium, morphine, cocaine or chloral could
be filled more than once. Two years later, the legislature
enacted a provision requiring that the effect of narcotics on the
human system be taught in the public schools. Ch. 1041, §1,
[18951 N.Y. Laws 972. In 1897, a law was passed making it a
felony to possess any narcotic &quot;with intent to administer
the same or cause the same to be administered to another&quot;
without his consent. Ch. 42, § 1, [1897] N.Y. Laws 21. The first
provision aimed at the sale of narcotics was passed in 1907 and
provided that the sale or distribution of cocaine without a
prescription was unlawful. Ch. 424, @ 1, [ 1907] N.Y. Laws 879.
This provision was subsequently amended to provide for the
keeping of records of sales and of transactions between dealers.
Ch. 470, § 2, [1913] N.Y. Laws 984; ch. 131, § 1, [1910] N.Y.
Laws 231; ch. 277, § 1, [1908] N.Y. Laws 764. </p>

<p>33 Id., July 30, 1914, at 8, col. 4. </p>

<p>34 Ch. 672, [1927] N.Y. Laws 1695-1703. </p>

<p>35 The 1914 act was amended by the Whitney Act in 1918 which
also provided for the repeal of the 1914 act. Ch. 639, [1918]
N.Y. Laws 2026. In 1921 an act was passed that in effect repealed
all the legislation relating to the narcotics problem. Ch. 708,
[1921] N.Y. Laws 2496. The measure made no provision for other
laws on the subject. This surprising move was made in the
interests of economy, N.Y. Times, Jan. 6, 1921, at 1, col. 8, and
with the belief that the drug problem could be better handled by
local authorities working in concert with federal agencies. See
id., Jan. 9, 1921, S 2, at 1, col. 7; id., May 22, 1921, S 2, at
11, col. 3, An act making illegal the sale of cocaine without a
prescription was enacted in 1923. Ch. 130, [1923] N.Y. Laws 160.
The possession of opium or cocaine without a prescription was
outlawed in 1926. Ch. 650, § 2, [1926] N.Y. Laws 1198. </p>

<p>36 As late as 1918, a legislative committee that had
exhaustively studied the narcotics problem in New York did not
mention the use of marijuana and concluded: &quot;The drugs which
are the sources of the difficulty are cocaine and eucaine with
their salts and derivatives and opium and its derivatives,
codeine, morphine and heroin.&quot; JOINT LEGISLATIVE COMM. TO
INVESTIGATE THE LAWS IN RELATION TO THE DISTRIBUTION AND SALE OF
NARCOTIC DRUGS, FINAL REPORT, NEW YORK SENATE Doc. No. 35 (1918).
quoted in TERRY &amp; PELLENs 833. </p>

<p>37 The Act of April 5, 1927, repealed both the 1923 and 1926
laws and replaced them with a comprehensive narcotic control
scheme. Ch. 672, [1927] N.Y. Laws 1695. This act contained
provisions relating to the control and use of narcotic drugs and
treatment of addicts; it also exempted certain preparations from
its coverage. The act furnished the model for the Uniform
Narcotic Drug Act. See pp. 1030-31 infra. </p>

<p>Subsequently, in 1929, unlawful sale of narcotics was made a
felony and all other violations of the 1927 act were made
misdemeanors. Ch. 377, [19291 N.Y. Laws 881. </p>

similar argument was made with respect to cocaine: </p>

<p>Cocaine in particular is greatly in demand. When prohibition
is in force, persons, especially drinkers from compulsion of
habit who have been robbed of their daily drink, will naturally
resort to cocaine . . . . </p>

<p>Weber, supra note 7, at 372. </p>

<p>49 B. RENBORG, INTERNATIONAL DRUG CONTROL 216 (1947): </p>

<p>As the campaign against the illicit traffic in opium,
morphine, and cocaine drugs made progress and gradually resulted
in diminution of the supplies on the illicit market, a marked
increase in the illicit traffic and the use of Indian hemp drugs
was noticed. more particularly on the North American Continent
(the problem of marihuana) and in Egypt (the hashish problem). </p>

<p>56 Quoted in id. at 378. Mr. El Guindy concludes by saying:
&quot;Generally speaking, the proportion of cases of insanity
caused by the use of hashish varies from 3 to 60 percent of the
total number of cases occurring in Egypt.&quot; Id. at 379. </p>

<p>57 There are no records of these subcommittee hearings, so we
can only surmise that the quality of the evidence might have been
about as bad as that presented in the floor report of the
Egyptian delegation. </p>

<p>58 Geneva Convention of 1925, quoted in W.WILLOUGHBY, supra
note 50, at 539. Moreover, the Convention defines Indian hemp as
follows: </p>

<p>&quot;Indian hemp&quot; means the dried flowering or fruiting
tops of the pistillate plant Cannabis sativa L. from which the
resin has not been extracted, under whatever name they may be
designated in commerce. </p>

<p>Id. at 535 </p>

<p>59 In an extensive surveyof cases appearing in the Fourth
Decennial Digest for the years 1926 to 1936, we could find only
eight cases dealing with marijuana under laws enacted prior to
the Uniform Narcotic Drug Act. In chronological order: Gonzales
v. State, 108 Tex. Crim. 253, 299 S.W.. 901 (1927); State v.

<p>66 see Utah 6, 26 P.2d 955 (1933) </p>

<p>67 Appellant, convicted on an information charging
&quot;possession of marijuana,&quot; contended that the statue
prohibited only possession of the flowering tops and leaves of
the marijuana plant. The court held that marijuana was the
popular name for the drug, not just the plant, and that the
information accordingly charged an offense. For this proposition,
it cited dictionaries, other state statutes, articles, cases and
texts. It is the court's familiarity with the articles describing
the allegedly evil effects of the drug with which we are
concerned. </p>

The Texas court was somewhat stricter in a series of cases
charging simply sale or possession of &quot;narcotic drugs&quot;
without specifying marijuana. On the same day, the court reversed
convictions in Baker v. State, 123 Tex. Crim. 209. 58 S.W.2d 534
(1933) (possession); Baker v. State, 123 Tex. Crim. 212, 58
S.W.2d 535 (1933) (sale or possession); and Horton v. State, 123,
Tex. Crim. 237, 58 S.W.2d 833, (1933) (possession). On the other
hand the Court held that an indictment charging &quot;possession
of marijuana&quot; is sufficient even though it does not allege
that marijuana is a narcotic drug. Santos v. State 122 Tex. Crim.
69, 53 S.W.2d 609 (1932).<br>
