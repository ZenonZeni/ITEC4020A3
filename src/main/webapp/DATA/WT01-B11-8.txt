<H1> The Rotary Engined Chevrolet Corvettes </H1>

<P> In 1970, Chevrolet obtained a licence for the <A HREF =
"dr-wankel.html">Wankel</A> <A HREF = "rce.html">RCE</A> from <A HREF =
"nsu.html">NSU</A> and began building a two-rotor and a four-rotor
Corvette [1, 2].  A fibreglass model is approved in June 1971 by GM
Pres. Ed Cole [4].

<P> On Jan. 14, 1972, a chassis was shipped to Pininfarina, Turin, Italy
so that the body could be constructed by the famed design studio [4].
In June of the same year, a 2 rotor Corvette with a steel body was
viewed by GM management [4, 5].  The same year GM commissioned a
two-rotor version of the XP-882 and built it as the XP-987GT [2].

<P> In January 1973, a Corvette body was built for an experiment
four-rotor car [4].  By April, the GALCIT wind tunnel in California was
used to test the aerodynamic qualities of the 4-rotor Corvette [4].  In
September 13, 1973 a 266 ci two-rotor Corvette was shown in Frankfurt,
Germany [1, 3].  The four-rotor 390 ci Corvette was shown at Paris,
France on Oct. 4, 1973, as well as the two-rotor [1].

<P> On September 24, 1974, GM Pres. Ed Cole postponed the introduction
of the Wankel engine, ostensibly due to emissions difficulties [6].  He
retired the same month.

<P> The 74 Chevy Vega was originally planned for a rotary engine.  This
was delayed to 1975, but this was dropped in 1974.  The engine was a two
rotor water cooled with oil cooling of the rotors.  There was a single
spark plug per rotor.  The housings were all iron.

<P> <A NAME="AMCPacer"> A GM rotary was going to be used for the
American Motors Pacer.  This allowed a flattened hood and radical
styling.
