NICOTINE PATCH CLASS SUIT ALLEGES PERSONAL INJURY, SD CA RULES

     U.S. District Judge Irma E. Gonzalez of the Southern
District of California on Sept. 22 dismissed the RICO-based class
complaint lodged by nicotine patch users against the major
American tobacco concerns, finding their nicotine addiction
claims to be, at bottom, for personal injury, and therefore
incompensable under the statute (Allman et al. v. Philip Morris
Inc. et al., SD CA, No. 94-0504-IEG (CM).

     The plaintiffs had argued that they were not seeking
recovery for injury to their person, such as for pain and
suffering, emotional distress or increased risk of cancer, but
rather only for the money they were forced to spend to break
their addiction to cigarettes -- an addiction, they added, that
the defendant tobacco companies caused.  They asserted that these
damages constituted statutory injury to property.

     "Although theoretically it is not always easy to distinguish
a personal injury from an injury to property," Judge Gonzalez
wrote, "for the purposes of bringing an action under RICO the
courts have been clear that even the economic consequences of
personal injuries are not compensable under RICO....

     "[A]lthough plaintiffs characterize the injury as pecuniary
and thus an injury to their property," she continued, "the Court
is unable to ignore that the core injury alleged in the complaint
is addiction to nicotine."  The judge noted that all courts faced
with the issue have recognized that expenses stemming from
personal injury are not recoverable under RICO.  "Had Congress
intended to create a federal treble damages remedy for cases
involving such claims, it could have enacted a statute referring
to injury generally, without any restrictive language," she
wrote.

     The judge found that the plaintiffs had cited to no cases
that allow recovery of medical expenses under RICO.  She also
rejected the claimants' argument that money is considered
"property" under California law, and that expenditures for
nicotine patches therefore constituted injury to property.
"[T]he Court will not adopt a state interpretation of 'property'
that will contravene Congress' intent in enacting RICO," Judge
Gonzalez stated.
               The defendant tobacco companies' July 15 dismissal motion
had also asserted that the plaintiffs failed to allege that they
were injured by the use or investment of the money the companies
supposedly received from alleged racketeering conduct, as
required under RICO Section 1962(a).  The plaintiffs had rejoined
in their Aug. 15 response that they adequately alleged injury
under Section 1962(a) by asserting that the defendants'
investment of the proceeds of their cigarettes sales, which
occurred due to defendants' racketeering activity, caused injury
to the class.

     The plaintiffs are represented by William S. Lerach, Patrick
J. Coughlin and Randi D. Weinberger of Milberg Weiss Bershad
Hynes & Lerach in San Diego and by Melvyn I. Weiss and Patricia
Hynes in the firm's New York office.

     Counsel for the defendants include Maurice A. Leiter, Andrew
C. Callari and Richard A. Ward of Arnold & Porter in Washington,

9TH CIR.: PATIENTS CAN'T SHOW INJURY FROM OVERBILLING SCHEME

     The Ninth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals on Sept. 19 affirmed
a Nevada district court's dismissal of RICO claims lodged by a
group of hospital patients against a doctor and hospital for
conspiring to overbill their health insurers, finding that the
plaintiffs failed to demonstrate concrete financial loss (Steele
et al. v. Hospital Corp. of America. et al., 9th Cir., No. 92-
17035).

     Dr. Stuart Wyckoff, director of the adolescent psychiatric
care unit at Truckee Meadows Hospital, was among the parties sued
by four former patients and their parents.  The plaintiffs
alleged that Wyckoff and the hospital conspired to bill their
health care carriers for services that went unprovided, or were
inappropriate.

     The U.S. District Court for the District of Nevada granted
summary judgment to the defense, determining that the plaintiffs
lacked standing.  The lower court reasoned that the insurers, and
not the plaintiffs themselves, were injured by the fraudulent
billing.  The trial court further found that the plaintiffs
failed to show that they paid out any money of their own as a
result of the scheme.

     In affirming, the Ninth Circuit rejected the plaintiffs'
assertions of injury due to depletion of insurance benefits.  One
parent asserted that he could have used some of the benefits for
himself; the panel rejoined that he had "not described a concrete
financial loss, but rather a speculative injury, contingent on
actually seeking medical care for himself....  [S]peculative
injuries to not serve to confer standing under RICO, unless they
become concrete and actual."

     Another parent claImed that he had to cover the entire bill
when his son was admitted to another facility because of
exhausted coverage.  "[P]roof of this payment would be
insufficient to confer RICO standing," the Ninth Circuit replied,
"because it alone does not show that the payment was caused by
the alleged billing scheme..., as distinguished from some other
cause."

     While the record revealed direct payments made by two of the
patients to the hospital, the panel found that the record "does
not reveal what these payments were for and there is no
explanation of how those charges were related to the allegedly
fraudulent overbilling scheme."

     The Ninth Circuit also affirmed the lower court's
application of the same reasoning in granting summary judgment on
the Nevada state RICO allegations.

     C. Frederick Pinkerton, Reno, NV, represents the appellants.

     Mark H. Lynch of Covington & Burling, Washington, DC, and
Theodore D. Gamboa of Osborne & Gamboa, Reno, represent the
appellees.

CO. TO HIGH CT.: CUSTOMER BILLING SCHEME DIDN'T INJURE COMPETITOR

     The telecommunications company whose summary judgment on a
competitor's RICO claims was overturned by the Fourth Circuit
last March on Aug. 19 filed a petition for writ of certiorari
with the U.S. Supreme Court, arguing that the appellate panel
improperly found a causal link between the petitioner's alleged
fraud on its customers and the injury claimed by the respondent
(Long Distance Service of Washington Inc. et al. v. Mid Atlantic
Telecom Inc., U.S. Sup. Ct., No. 94-319).

     The petitioner Long Distance Service of Washington Inc. (nee
Long Distance Services Inc.) and respondent Mid Atlantic Telecom
Inc. make wholesale purchases of time on the transmission lines
of common carriers and resell them to their customers.  After a
1986 systems error caused the loss of a weekend's worth of data
concerning customer use, LDS President Richard J. Rice
commissioned the drafting of a computer program that would
randomly pad the length of its customers' billable calls.

     Mid Atlantic sued LDS and Rice in the District of Maryland
in 1992, arguing that LDS continued to utilize the program even
after its losses had been recouped.  Mid Atlantic asserted that
the program enabled LDS to offer artificially lower rates, and
thereby entice away Mid Atlantic's customers, when in fact it was
overbilling said customers.  The plaintiff alleged to have lost
revenues from engaging in a pricing war, as well as customers.

     The trial court granted summary judgment to LDS, finding no
proximate cause linking the alleged conduct could not have
proximately caused the claimed injuries per the U.S. Supreme
Court's 1992 ruling in Holmes v. SIPC.  In reversing and
remanding for further discovery, the Fourth Circuit noted that
the complaint alleged Mid Atlantic's elimination as a competitor
as an end goal of the alleged scheme.  The appellate panel stated
that its findings were consistent with Holmes, noting that Mid
Atlantic was not seeking to vindicate the rights of its ex-
customers, and that Mid Atlantic's claimed injuries were not
derivative of its ex-customers.

     In its certiorari petition, LDS asserted that the underlying
predicate acts alleged "are the use of the mails and wires to
commit a fraud....  These allegations, plainly, are directed
exclusively toward the users of long distance service, the
customers.  There are no allegations that LDS intended to deceive
Mid Atlantic or that Mid Atlantic was defrauded by the fraudulent
billing practice."

     Regardless of whether it intended this alleged fraud on the
customers to also harm the respondent competitively, argued the
petitioner, Mid Atlantic's injury was not directly caused by the
fraud.  "Mid Atlantic's injury is a byproduct, whether intended
or not, of the injury to the customers," LDS argued.

     "RICO, as construed by this court, requires a cognizable
connection between the offending acts and the claimed injury,"
the petitioner contended.  The respondent alleged that one of the
purposes of the scheme was to steal Mid Atlantic's customers; the
petitioner rejoined that "unfair competition of that nature,
however unacceptable it is deemed under state law, is not
prohibited by the federal mail fraud statute."
               The petitioner asserted that "RICO does not, and was
never intended to, prohibit anticompetitive conduct, even in its more
virulent forms, without more.  RICO was aimed at a different
evil."

     Edgar N. James and Martha Walfoort of Guerrieri, Edmond &
James, Washington, DC, submitted the certiorari petition on
behalf of Long Distance Service of Washington Inc. and Richard J.
Rice.

     Harry Martin Rifkin and Franklin T. Caudill of Semmes, Bowen
& Semmes, Baltimore, represent Mid Atlantic Telecom Inc.

ND IL REFUSES TO DISMISS FORCED-PLACED INSURANCE CAR LOAN CLAIMS

     U.S. District Judge Ruben Castillo of the Northern District
of Illinois on Aug. 11 refused to dismiss the RICO claims of
three car loan borrowers against First of America Bank Champion
N.A., sustaining the plaintiffs' allegations that the lender
obtained unnecessary forced-placed insurance on their vehicles
for the purpose of imposing additional loan obligations (Bermudez
et al. v.  First of America Bank Champion N.A., ND IL, No. 93 C
3653).

     The three plaintiffs had each purchased an auto financed via
a motor vehicle retail installment sales contract.  Each sales
contract was immediately assigned to Champion.  The sales
contracts' terms required the borrowers to keep the vehicles
insured against loss or damage, and authorized Champion to obtain
loss/damage insurance if the borrower failed to do so.  The cost
of any such "forced-placed" insurance would be charged to the
borrowers' loan balance.

     In their cases, the plaintiffs urged, Champion, without
authorization, procured insurance that would also cover any
default on their loan obligations.  All three of the plaintiffs
here refused to pay the extra premiums that were added to their
balances due and all had their cars repossessed by the lender.
Their claimed injuries included loss of their vehicles, injury to
their credit and the creation of fictitious indebtedness.

     Champion never provided the borrowers with copies of the
forced-placed policies, and nothing in the "certificate of
insurance" transmitted to each plaintiff suggested that the
insurance also covered default.  The policies also covered
imposition of mechanic's liens on the collateral, and against the
borrower absconding with or secreting the collateral.

     The plaintiffs' complaint was grounded in RICO, the Truth in
Lending Act and numerous state counts.  Champion made multiple
arguments in its bid to dismiss the RICO claim, including lack of
RICO "injury," lack of proximate causation, running of the
statute of limitations, failure to adequately plead fraud,
failure to allege pattern, and immunity under the McCarran-
Ferguson Act.

     Judge Castillo disposed of the McCarran-Ferguson argument
first, concluding that the defendant's unauthorized procurement
of coverage (and passing such costs along) was not part of the
"business of insurance."  The judge found that this practice does
not involve the transferring or spreading of Champion's risk, nor
is it an integral part of the policy relationship between carrier
and policyholder.  Nor were the challenged practices limited to
entities in the insurance industry, the court noted.

     In addressing Champion's RICO standing arguments, the court
noted that the lender "does not dispute that repossession of
plaintiffs' vehicles and payment of money for unauthorized
premiums constitute compensable injuries under RICO."  The judge
rejected Champion's contentions that the plaintiffs suffered no
injury because they did not pay the additional premiums.

     He further rejected the lender's assertion that the car
repossessions were not proximately caused by its conduct.  One
plaintiff had not paid any insurance premiums, much less the
added charges, Champion argued; another was in default for an
amount beyond the premiums.  Judge Castillo found that the
present record "does not permit a parcelling of charges [into]
authorized and unauthorized components," and that the other
plaintiff could possibly "establish facts proving that Champion
would not have repossessed his vehicle if not for the fact that
his outstanding balance was so great."

     The judge rejected the lenders' contentions that the
borrowers in fact benefited from the additional coverage, or that
the coverage would not have been forced-placed but for the
plaintiffs' failure to obtain their own insurance.  The
borrowers, the judge noted, did not complain about the
defendant's procurement of authorized insurance.

     In turning to the time-bar argument, the court noted the
plaintiffs' contentions that their claims accrued in February
1993, when they obtained documents showing that Champion had
procured the unauthorized insurance.  Champion asserted that the
claims began to run in 1988-1989, when the borrowers received
their "certificates of insurance."

     Judge Castillo refused to find that the certificates put the
plaintiffs on notice.  "The statement that the certificate is a
condensed version of the policy and that there are additional
terms and conditions does not suggest to the ordinary consumer
that there is coverage beyond that described in the certificate,"
he wrote.

     He also found that the plaintiffs' authorization in the
contracts did not void their ability to allege fraud.  After
reviewing the documents, the judge refused to hold as a matter of
law that they "authorized Champion to purchase insurance in
addition to that for damage or loss to the vehicles."

     The court also found the pleadings to sufficiently allege
pattern.  The allegations, noted the judge, satisfied the
relatedness inquiry by claiming a course of conduct running at
least five years; the possibility of thousands of victims;
similar injuries (repossession, overpayments); and multiple
fraudulent uses of the mails.

     Continuity was also demonstrated, found the judge, by the
allegations that these were the lender's "normal ongoing
practices" and that such practices had occurred for several
years.

     The judge refused to dismiss the TILA claims as time-barred
under the statute's one-year limitations period, finding the
plaintiffs to have sufficiently averred fraudulent concealment.
The court also rejected the substantive TILA challenge.  Judge
Castillo found that if the default coverage was unauthorized,
then the charges for the coverage would not constitute a charge
for actual unanticipated default, but a finance charge subject to
the statute.

     The judge ordered the submission of a motion for class
certification by Sept. 1 and a defense response by Sept. 29.

11TH CIR. ADOPTS PERSON/ENTERPRISE DISTINCTION IN REVISED OPINION

     The 11th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals on Aug. 19 modified
its April 1994 ruling that permitted members of the United
Steelworkers of America to bring RICO claims against their union
and USX Corp. over a swap of labor concessions for perks to union
negotiators.

     While the modification did not invalidate the claims of the
plaintiffs here, the 11th Circuit has ostensibly voided its 1982
ruling in U.S. v. Hartley, which had rejected the commonly-held
requirement that a defendant entity cannot be both a RICO
"person" and "enterprise" under 18 U.S.C. Section 1962(c) (Cox et
al. v. Administrator United States Steel & Carnegie et al., 11th
Cir., Nos. 91-7215, 92-6218).

     The litigation, which was brought in the Northern District
of Alabama by 38 former union employees of USX's Fairfield mill,
stemmed from a 1983 collective bargaining agreement between USX
and the union.  Leading the negotiations for the Steelworkers
were District 36 director Thermon Phillips and district sub-
director E.B. Rich, both former USX employees.  As alleged,
Phillips and Rich sought to have USX grant them (and other ex-USX
employee/union reps) retroactive leaves of absence, in order to
become eligible for USX pensions.  The negotiators purportedly
made any labor concessions contingent on their receiving
pensions.

     The CBA that was struck contained considerable concessions,
including the elimination of 500 jobs, the abolition of local
working conditions rules, and the dismissal of all pending
grievances and complaints.  USX subsequently amended corporate
policy to grant indefinite retroactive leaves of absence for
employees who had left to work for the union.

     While Phillips, Rich and four other union reps (the
"Fairfield Six") began receiving pension payments, no other
potential beneficiaries under the policy change did.  After
rumors of the Fairfield Six's arrangement surfaced, potential
beneficiaries made demand on USX's pension fund.  USX, Rich and
Phillips were ultimately convicted under 29 U.S.C. Section 186
for their bargaining activities.

     The Northern District of Alabama had granted summary
judgment to the defense on the plaintiffs' RICO and Labor
Management Relations Act claims.  The trial court determined that
the employees did not demonstrate any causal link between the
negotiations that led to the pension grandfathering and their
claimed injuries.

     The 11th Circuit reversed last April 5.  The panel
determined the plaintiffs' RICO claims valid after exhaustive
review, finding that the employees had properly alleged pattern
and that a jury issue could be made that Rich and Phillips'
pursuit of their self-interests resulted in some dollar amount of
concessions in the CBA.  The appellate court also found that the
plaintiffs could pursue arguments under theories of respondeat
superior and aiding/abetting to establish the union's RICO
liability for the negotiators' acts.  The defense sought
rehearing and rehearing en banc from the 11th Circuit.

     While the panel rejected the defense petitions in all other
respects, it altered the text of Section II.B.1.b.  In its
earlier ruling, the court had rejected USX's argument that it
could not be both a 1962(c) "person" and "enterprise" by simply
citing back to Hartley.  The revised portions of the opinion
removed all citations to Hartley.

     The revised opinion found that the plaintiffs' claims did in
fact make a person/enterprise distinction.  "[T]he plaintiffs
have alleged only that USX conducted the affairs of the Fairfield
Works, the Union, District 36 and the Fund through a pattern of
racketeering activity -- not that USX conducted its own affairs
through a pattern of such activity."

     The panel also determined that the pension fund was an
enterprise distinct from USX.  "The pension fund has a separate
corporate existence; it is a nonprofit membership corporation.
Its existence is not dependent upon USX....  Although both USX
and its employees have a role in the pension fund, the role of
each is distinct from the respective role each has in the
corporation itself."

     The amendments also eliminated all reference to Hartley from
the context of its vicarious liability overview at
Section II.B.3.a.

7TH CIR.: POWER TOOL DISPARAGEMENT CLAIMS FAIL TO PLEAD FRAUD

     The Seventh Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals on Sept. 13
affirmed the dismissal of the RICO-based trade disparagement
claims brought by a Taiwanese power tool maker and its American
distributor against Makita Corp. and its subsidiaries, agreeing
that the averments of fraud fail to meet the particularity
requirements of FRCP 9(b) (Jepson Inc. et al. v. Makita Corp. et
al., 7th Cir., No. 93-1606).

     The action is rooted in an April 1988 complaint to the
International Trade Commission by the defendants (collectively,
"Makita") alleging that the distributor Jepson Inc. and some 30
other parties had engaged in unfair trade practices with respect
to the importation and marketing of Taiwan-made power tools.
That August, the ITC began an investigation into possible
breaches of the Tariff Act of 1930.

     While the investigation ensued, Makita allegedly contacted
Jepson customers, apprising them of the ITC activity and
disparaging Jepson's products as low-quality, infringing goods
that would be ordered removed from their shelves.  Makita also
arranged the placement of stories in the trade press concerning
the investigation and predicting that Makita would prevail in the
matter.  One story identified Jepson and the co-plaintiff
manufacturer Ko Shin Electric and Machinery Co. Ltd. as two of
the companies that Makita was seeking to block.  In July 1989,
the ITC found in favor of all but one of the companies named to
Makita's complaint.

     Jepson and Ko Shin filed a RICO complaint with the Northern
District of Illinois in 1990, asserting that Makita's acts were
part of a conspiracy dating back to 1986 calculated to drive
Taiwanese power tool manufacturers from the market.  The
plaintiffs alleged substantial sales losses over 1986-1990, along
with erosion of market position, customer base, and potential for
growth.  The plaintiffs sought a base recovery of $10 million
plus treble damages.

     The trial court dismissed the action with prejudice on
various grounds; the Seventh Circuit's affirmance focused on the
lower court's FRCP 9(b) analysis.  With respect to the phone
calls and mailings to Jepson customers and the trade press, the
Northern District found the plaintiffs' allegations to "fail to
provide any indications of who made the communications or when
they took place."
               The lower court also determined that the plaintiffs'
allegations were not within the scope of the wire and mail fraud
statutes.  As construed by the Seventh Circuit, the Northern
District "thought that the gist of the alleged scheme -- to
disparage Jepson's products and frighten away its customers --
did not fall under the rubric of fraud."  While the statutes are
concerned with property rights, the plaintiffs "had not
identified  damage to a cognizable property interest."

     The Seventh Circuit's analysis opened by finding
"considerable persuasive force" to this latter argument.  The
panel declined to address the issue at length, however, because
it agreed with the lower court's 9(b) findings as grounds for
affirmance.  The panel found the allegations concerning the
communications to Jepson's customers to be "the most glaringly
deficient....

     "Although the amended complaint identifies the general
nature of the purported misrepresentations made to these
customers," the panel continued, "no detail beyond that is
supplied."  The court found that there was no issue present as to
whether the facts were in the sole possession of the defense.
"[E]ven if they learned of the contacts through other sources,"
wrote the panel, "they have as much access as the defendants to
the customers who can flesh out the circumstances of the mailings
and wire communications involved."

     While finding the allegations concerning the communications
with the trade press "not flawed to the same degree," the
appellate panel still found the complaint void of detail
concerning the content of any such communication.  From the face
of the articles that appeared in the trades, the Seventh Circuit
wrote, "we detect only one or two statements that might be
characterized as misrepresentations."

     The panel rejected the plaintiffs' allegations concerning
the article that implicated them in the ITC investigation.  "We
do not see what is false or misleading about such a statement,"
wrote the court.  "Jepson and Ko Shin were, so far as we can
determine, targets of Makita's complaint, and the complaint did
seek an order of the kind described."

     The court found the statements made by Makita's counsel to
the trades "fall within the range of opinions predictions that
parties and their attorneys routinely make while legal
proceedings are underway."  The references made in the trades to
"rip-offs" and "poor-quality copies" of Makita products did not
rise to fraud, stated the panel; Makita did obtain a conviction
against one manufacturer, indicating there were in fact inferior
copies of their products in circulation.

     "Labels like 'poor quality,' 'cheap,' and 'lookalike' may be
offensive to the companies whose products are being described,"
the panel concluded, "but they are also inherently subjective
expressions that are ill-suited as the basis for mail and wire
fraud claims."

4TH CIR.: PTL SHARES ARE 'SECURITIES,' DEFENSE RICO WIN AFFIRMED

     The Fourth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals on Sept. 23
overturned the directed verdict granted to Jim Bakker on the
federal securities fraud claims levied against him by a class of
subscribers to "lifetime partnerships" in PTL, determining that
the partnership interests constitute "securities" under federal
law.  The balance of the North Carolina federal court and jury's
findings, including Bakker's liability for common law fraud and
the defense verdict on federal and state RICO claims, were upheld
(Teague et al. v. Bakker et al., 4th Cir., Nos. 91-2101, 91-2120,
91-2121, 91-2122).

     The "partnerships" solicited by the former televangelist's
organization between 1984-1987 promised benefits that included
annual lodging at PTL's Heritage Village theme park.  Bakker sold
roughly 153,000 partnerships that included lodging benefits,
raising at least $158 million.  The partnerships were oversold;
most of the proposed additional facilities at the park went
unconstructed, and the partnership investments went to PTL's
operating expenses and the support of Bakker's lifestyle.  Most
members never received the promised lodging benefits.  Bakker was
criminally convicted for this conduct.

     A class suit was lodged in late 1987 in the Western District
of North Carolina, naming Bakker; PTL accountants Deloitte,
Haskin & Sells; and various individual PTL principals.  The
complaint was grounded in federal and state securities law,
federal and state RICO, the South Carolina Timeshare Act
("SCTSA"), common law fraud and common law negligence.

     The trial judge granted a directed verdict on the securities
fraud claims, determining the partnership interests not to be
statutory "securities."  The jury determined Bakker to be liable
on the common-law fraud count and found for the defense in all
other respects.

     In overturning the directed verdict on the securities
claims, the Fourth Circuit found that the case turned on the
third inquiry established by SEC v. W.J. Howey Co. (U.S. Sup. Ct.
1946) as to whether the partnerships are statutory "investment
contracts, e.g. whether the investment was made "with an
expectation of profits 'solely' from the efforts of others."

     The lower court found that the investors were attracted
solely to acquire lodging, and not for a financial return on the
investment.  The appellate panel noted that PTL's promotional
materials "represented that the value of the privileges lifetime
partners would receive far exceeded the $1,000 LTP purchase
price."  The court found that the defense representations "can be
read to suggest that LTP purchasers would receive an economic
benefit in the form of discounted lodging privileges at PTL
facilities."

     The defense pointed to the testimony of class members who
stated that they purchased with personal use as their primary
motivation; the panel found such evidence "cannot be dispositive
in the face of evidence that the promoter of the scheme in
question marketed the scheme by emphasizing the potential for
profit."

     The appellees contended that the partnerships are not
transferrable, and that the partners could therefore never
realize capital appreciation.  The Fourth Circuit found there to
be record evidence that the partnerships could be transferred on
an annual basis.

     The panel affirmed the dismissal of the claims against
Deloitte, Haskin for aiding and abetting Bakker's alleged federal
securities violations, finding this theory invalidated by the
Supreme Court's 1994 opinion in Central Bank of Denver v. First
Interstate Bank of Denver.  The panel found Central Bank
persuasive, if not dispositive, in affirming the rejection of the
plaintiffs' comparable state counts.

     The panel also agreed that the partnerships were not
"vacation time sharing plans" for the purposes of the state
timeshare act.  The Fourth Circuit found no abuse of discretion
by the court below in denying new trial on either the claims
against the accountants on the aiding and abetting of Bakker's
common-law fraud, or on the plaintiffs' federal and state RICO
claims.

     The plaintiffs had asserted on appeal that the jury was
improperly allowed to decide if Bakker had committed the alleged
RICO predicates.  They argued that Bakker's criminal convictions
collaterally estopped any such debate issue as to whether he had
committed the RICO predicates; the panel found that this argument
had never been proffered below, and was inappropriate here.

     The partners also argued that the RICO jury instructions
were flawed in three respects.  They asserted that the
instructions erroneously referred to RICO predicates as "crimes";
the panel found this to be harmless error, as the trial court at
no time imposed a "beyond reasonable doubt" proof burden.

     The court had instructed the jury that the North Carolina
RICO statute requires proof beyond reasonable doubt.  The
plaintiffs found this proper with respect to Bakker's primary
violation, but erroneous with respect to Deloitte, Haskin's
aiding and abetting of the primary violation.  The panel found
harmless error here as well, because Bakker was exonerated on the
primary violation.

               The plaintiffs lastly challenged the instruction
concerning 18 U.S.C. Section 1962(b).  They contended that the
instruction wrongly required the jury to find that Bakker acquired an
equity ownership in the enterprise.  The court found that, in its
entirety, the instruction ultimately required a finding that Bakker
had "actual day-to-day involvement in the management and operation of
PTL."

     The panel rejected Bakker's appeal on the fraud count, as
well as the attempts of Deloitte, Haskin and Bakker aide David A.
Taggart to recoup their costs from the plaintiffs.

ND CA DISMISSES SECURITIES FRAUD ACTION AGAINST OMNITRITION

     Judge Saundra Brown Armstrong of the U.S. District Court for
the Northern District of California on July 25 dismissed a
securities action against Omnitrition International Inc. and its
top officials, finding that the company is not an illegal pyramid
sales scheme as alleged by the plaintiffs  (In re Omnitrition
International Inc. Securities Litigation, ND CA, MDL No. 965,
No. C-92-4133-SBA).

     Judge Armstrong granted a motion for summary judgment filed
on May 11 by defendants Omnitrition, Jim Fobair, Roger Daley and
Charles Ragus, holding that the structure of Omnitrition's system
does not lend itself to the definition of an illegal pyramid
scheme.

     "As a threshold matter," the judge said, "the participants
in the company, [Independent Marketing Agents], do not pay money
to obtain sales and/or recruiting rights....  [T]here is no
charge for joining the company.  Once the application is
approved, the participant obtains the right to buy Omnitrition
products at a 20% discount, and the right to sell Omnitrition
products."

     Plaintiffs in this action, individuals who obtained
distributorships with Omnitrition between 1989 and 1992, filed a
complaint against the defendants alleging violations of federal
securities laws, RICO and state fraud laws in the creation,
promotion and marketing of Omnitrition and its distributorships.
Omnitrition allegedly markets a line of health food products.
However, plaintiffs claim that Omnitrition did not engage in or
encourage retail sale of these products.  Rather, plaintiffs
state that Omnitrition actively recruited distributors of the
products, who would in turn be encouraged to recruit more
distributors.

     However, Judge Armstrong said the recruitment of others into
a program does not constitute a pyramid scheme, at least not
until the recruits make any retail sales.

     "More significantly," the judge said, "an IMA does not
obtain the right to earn rewards for recruiting other
participants into the scheme that are unrelated to product sales.
A participant in Omnitrition does not receive any payment or
reward for merely recruiting others into the program.  These new
recruits must make retail sales.  If the recruiter has achieved a
sufficient sales volume to qualify for overrides and/or bonuses,
and the new recruits make retail sales, the recruiter receives a
payment from Omnitrition based upon a percentage of the retail
sales of his downline.

     "Thus," the judge said, "Omnitrition provides rewards for
recruiting participants that are directly related to product
sales.  In fact, the reward is conditional on product sales, and
the amount of the award is based upon the amount of product sales
that occur."

     Judge Armstrong also ruled that the defendants' alleged
misleading statements and omissions are not actionable under the
federal securities laws.  The judge cited the Ninth Circuit's
ruling in In re Apple Computer Sec. Litig., 886 F.2d 1109, 1113
(9th Cir. 1989).  In Apple, the appeals court said that a
projection or statement of belief contains at least three
implicit factual assertions:  (1) that the statement is genuinely
believed, (2) that there is a reasonable basis for that belief
and (3) that the speaker is not aware of any undisclosed facts
tending to seriously undermine the accuracy of the statement.  A
projection or statement of belief may be actionable to the extent
that one of these implied factual assertions is inaccurate.

     "Plaintiffs have challenged every statement [of the
defendants] on the ground that Omnitrition is a pyramid scheme
that was destined to collapse, and that each defendant knew this
to be true," Judge Armstrong said.  "However,...Omnitrition does
not meet the legal definition of an illegal pyramid sales scheme.
Accordingly, plaintiffs' claims that Omnitrition is inherently
destined to collapse are unsupportable.

     "Moreover," the judge said, "defendants have each submitted
declarations in which they maintain that they genuinely believed
and continue to believe that every statement they made is true.
Defendants have therefore met the first prong of the Apple test."

     The judge also noted that each defendant testified that he
had a reasonable basis for believing the statements to be true.
"Plaintiffs have not forwarded any evidence or argument
suggesting that defendants' bases for believing their statements
to be true were unreasonable, thus, defendants have met the
second prong of the Apple test," she said.

     "Finally," the judge said, "plaintiffs have not forwarded
any evidence suggesting that any defendant was aware of
undisclosed facts tending to seriously undermine the accuracy of
each statement.  Thus, the third prong of the Apple test is met."

               In addition, Judge Armstrong found that the
plaintiffs have not sufficiently proven their allegations that the
defendants engaged in RICO predicate acts.  "Plaintiffs maintain that
since they have proven Omnitrition is a pyramid scheme, they need not
prove specific intent," the judge said.  "However,...plaintiffs have
failed to demonstrate or otherwise establish a triable issue of fact
concerning whether Omnitrition is a pyramid scheme.  As there is
otherwise no evidence of specific intent on the part of the
defendants to defraud anyone, plaintiffs' RICO claims are fatally
deficient."

SD NY: BRIBERY ALLEGATIONS DON'T REQUIRE FRCP 9(b) REVIEW

     U.S. District Judge John F. Keenan of the Southern District
of New York on Aug. 17 refused to dismiss the RICO action brought
by CNBC Inc. against a commercial printer that it claims
corrupted an ex-employee into arranging inflated compensation for
the defendants' services.  The judge rejected the defense's
contentions that the alleged predicate acts of commercial bribery
must be pleaded with FRCP 9(b) particularity (CNBC Inc. v.
Alvarado et al., SD NY, No. 93 Civ. 2261 (JFK)).

     The cable programmer alleged that in a period spanning 1989-
1993, Avalon Group Associates Ltd. and its president, Robert
Alvarado Jr., conspired with then-CNBC employee Joyce Gibney to
embezzle from the plaintiff.  Over 1991-1993, Gibney received
some $111,000 in bribes and kickbacks to direct some $3 million
of CNBC business to the defendants, the plaintiff alleged; Gibney
was also supposedly named to Alvarado's will.

     Gibney also purportedly gave the defendants inside
information on CNBC's bidding process; the plaintiff alleged that
this resulted the submission of falsely inflated invoices that
overbilled for over $500,000.  The plaintiff seeks this amount,
plus $100,000 for the loss of Gibney's loyal services and for
compensatory damages, plus an additional $2 million in punitives.
The complaint listed 18 faxed communications as predicate acts of
wire fraud and also claimed the bribery of Gibney as a predicate.

     In rejecting the defense's dismissal motion, the court
rejected Avalon's argument that the bribery allegations must
comport with FRCP 9(b).  The defendants argued that the stricter
standard should apply, because the damage from the alleged
bribery stemmed solely from the fraudulent invoices.
"[P]laintiff," the judge rejoined, "alleges that it was damaged
not only by the invoices, but also by the loss of a loyal
employee."

     The judge found the bribery allegations sufficiently pleaded
under the standard of FRCP 8(a).  The allegations of the fraud
predicates were determined to be sufficient under FRCP 9(b).
While acknowledging that CNBC failed to specify the content of
either the invoices or the faxes, the court noted that the
defendants and Gibney are the only persons with actual knowledge
as to their content.  Noting that the plaintiff will need further
discovery, and had established motive and opportunity for fraud,
the judge refused to dismiss.

     Nathaniel H. Akerman of Seyfarth, Shaw, Fairweather &
Geraldson, New York, represents the plaintiff.

     Arthur J. Golder III of Golder & Golder, Trumansburg, NY,
represents the defendants.

ND IL ALLOWS 1962 (c),(d) CLAIMS AGAINST POWER BUYING CLUB

     U.S. District Judge Harry D. Leinenwebber of the Northern
District of Illinois on Aug. 17 declined to dismiss the RICO
fraud class claims lodged under 18 U.S.C. Section 1962(c) and (d)
by a member of a consumer "power buying" club against the club's
organizers and operators.  The plaintiff's allegations under
Section 1962(a) were dismissed for failure to demonstrate
investment injury (Crawford v. Payne et al., ND IL, No. 93 C
7303).

     Charlie Crawford lodged the instant suit against the
operators of the Combined Purchasing Association Inc. Buyers
Club, which induced memberships by representing that it could
obtain merchandise at substantially below-retail prices.
Memberships were solicited via at-home demonstrations and follow-
up calls; the required membership fee was upwards of $1000.
Crawford alleged that the defendants sought to reap these fees,
while concurrently defeating the efforts of the members to obtain
merchandise at discount prices.

     The plaintiff alleged three separate clusters of defendants:
the individual "designers" who set up the overall enterprise; the
individual "operators" who implemented the scheme on a day-to-day
basis; and corporate defendants that acted in direct concert with
the designers.

     In reviewing the defense's dismissal motion, the judge first
addressed the assertion that Crawford's predicate fraud
allegations failed to plead a scheme to defraud.  The court found
that the tiers of operation alleged by the plaintiff, if proven,
would "constitute an 'elaborate attempt at concealment.'"   The
judge also found the defendants' sales pitches as alleged by the
plaintiffs constituted "specific misrepresentations or half-
truths." He also determined that the allegations demonstrated
scienter and a sufficient link between the alleged fraud and the
use of the mails and wires.

     In rejecting Crawford's 1962(a) count, Judge Leinenwebber
found him to be "in effect...claiming that defendants reinvested
racketeering proceeds into the entities it created to operate the
Buyers Club."  The court cited to the Seventh Circuit's April
ruling in Vicom v. Harbridge Merchant Services (see Civil RICO
LR, April 1994, P. 9,484) for the principle that mere
reinvestment of proceeds, without proximate causation of injury,
is insufficient to create 1962(a) standing.

     The judge denied the defense's attempt to dismiss the
1962(c) count, however.  He found the fraud allegations to be
pleaded with sufficient FRCP 9(b) particularity, noting that
Crawford included a copy of the Buying Club sales pitch
materials, and notified each defendant as to his role in the
alleged fraud.  The court also determined the plaintiff to have
sufficiently identified an enterprise comprised of the three
clusters of defendants.

     Judge Leinenwebber further ruled that Crawford had
sufficiently alleged pattern.  The relationship prong was
satisfied, he found, as each prospective plaintiff was defrauded
by the same misrepresentations.  The judge also noted that the
Buyers' Club's activities are allegedly ongoing, and ruled that
open-ended continuity was therefore established.

     The judge found the conspiracy allegations under 1962(d)
sufficiently pleaded.  He denied the defendants' bid to strike
any claims accruing prior to Dec. 3, 1989 (four years before the
filing of Crawford's suit), as time-barred.

2ND CIR. PROPERLY FOUND NO DAMAGES, MILKENS ARGUE TO HIGH COURT

     Michael and Lowell Milken on Aug. 17 responded to the
certiorari petition lodged by investors in the restructuring of
Ivan Boesky & Co. whose federal securities and RICO claims were
denied by the Second Circuit, arguing that the appellate panel
was correct in finding the petitioners "had no damages in light
of their 100% recoupment (plus a profit)" (Commercial Union
Assurance Co. et al. v. Milken et al., U.S. Sup. Ct., No. 94-
153).

     In 1986, the plaintiff investors bought $10.5 million worth
of partnership interests in Ivan F. Boesky & Co., L.P.  The
plaintiffs opted into the March 1987 lawsuit against Boesky and
debt underwriter Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.; that suit was
amended in 1989 to name the Milkens, who had worked with Boesky
on the reorganization as principals of DBL, as defendants.

     After the respondents were brought into suit, the investors
began to cash distributions from Boesky & Co.'s liquidation
trustee.  By April 1992, the petitioners had received
distributions totaling $12.047 million, or over 114% of their
original investment.  The petitioners opted out of the March 1992
global settlement that the Milkens arranged with Boesky
investors, and brought an amended complaint against the
respondents.

               The Milkens obtained summary judgment from the Southern
District of New York in May 1993.  The trial court's finding of
failure to plead compensable damages was affirmed last March by
the Second Circuit, which wrote that "damages as compensation
under RICO Section 1964(c) for injury to property must, under the
familiar rule of law, place appellants in the same position they
would have been but for the illegal conduct.  Here, appellants
have already been placed in that position."

     The investors asked for certiorari on July 15, arguing that
the Second Circuit in effect resuscitated the "racketeering
injury" requirement rejected by the high court in Sedima v. Imrex
Co.  The petitioners asserted that under such reasoning, a RICO
claim for mail, wire or securities fraud "will not ripen until
all or part of its underlying investment is proved worthless and
its damages are finally determined to be uncollectible."

     In their response brief, the Milkens argued that the
appellate panel's ruling "is fully consistent with the precedents
of this Court and other circuits, and raises no question of
constitutional magnitude or national importance."

     The respondents asserted that Sedima was "simply irrelevant"
in the instant context.  "[T]he Sedima majority emphasized that a
RICO plaintiff 'can only recover to the extent that he has been
injured in his business or property by the conduct constituting
the violation [emphasis added]," they argued.  "[P]etitioners
suffered no injury in their business or property, whether caused
by the Milkens' alleged predicate acts or otherwise."

     The Milkens further deemed the investors' uncertainty of
accrual argument "a red herring.  The decision below did not even
reach the issue of when petitioners' purported RICO claim
accrued, much less the standard stated by petitioners."  The
respondents also rejected the petitioners' reliance on antitrust
precedent that holds a plaintiff damaged even when capital is
recovered.  Those cases, the Milkens argue, involve plaintiffs
that passed their overcharges along to their clients;
"Petitioners here did not recover their alleged losses by
'passing them on' to someone else."

     The Milkens further argued that the investors' bid for
attorneys' fees was never before the courts below, and improperly
raised on appeal.  The respondents asserted that the petitioners
were otherwise unentitled to fees, as they did not suffer a RICO
injury.

     Mark A. Belnick, David L. Kornblau and Steven Pacht of Paul,
Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, New York, submitted the
response on behalf of Michael Milken.  Michael O. Finkelstein of
Lord, Day & Lord, Barrett Smith, New York, submitted the response
on behalf of Lowell Milken.

     George D. Reycraft and Debra Brown Steinberg of Cadwalader,
Wickersham & Taft, New York, represent the petitioners.

SD NY: FRAUD SUIT AGAINST NY BLUES BARRED BY FILED RATE DOCTRINE

     U.S. District Judge John F. Keenan of the Southern District
of New York on Aug. 17 dismissed the RICO counts raised by two
health insurance purchasers against Empire Blue Cross/Blue Shield
of New York for allegedly submitting fraudulent applications for
rate increases to the state insurance department ("NYSID") over
1990-1993, determining the alleged claims to be barred by the
filed rate doctrine (Fersco et al. v. Empire Blue Cross/Blue
Shield of New York et al., SD NY, No. 93 Civ. 4226 (JFK)).

     In the years at issue, Judge Keenan noted, the defendants
obtained rate increases of no less than 13.7% and as much as
25.5%.  The plaintiffs asserted that Empire obtained these
increases through "an intentional scheme of deception and
misrepresentation."  Empire, they alleged, exaggerated its
community-rated losses, understated its experience-rated losses
and exaggerated the impact of competition from large commercial
carriers in its filings with state regulators.

     In granting the defense's bid for summary judgment, Judge
Keenan looked to the Second Circuit's May ruling in Wegoland Ltd.
v. NYNEX Corp. (see Civil RICO LR, May 1994, P. 9,578) in finding
the claims barred.  "There is no dispute that Empire is a
regulated utility whose rates must be approved by a governing
regulatory agency, the NYSID," he noted.

     The plaintiffs' fraud allegations were "of little import,"
the judge found, as Wegoland v. NYNEX expressly rejected a fraud
exception to the filed rate doctrine.  The plaintiffs asserted
that they did not ask the court to engage in the rate-making
process, but only to ascertain whether the increases should have
been granted at all.  The court rejoined that it could not
determine "either the pervasiveness of the fraud or the
reasonableness of the rates existing prior to the increase
without a thorough understanding of the factors involved in
ascertaining a reasonable rate."

     The judge rejected the plaintiffs' citation to County of
Suffolk v. LILCO (2nd Cir. 1990), noting that the Wegoland panel
expressly rejected the earlier ruling as a bar to the filed rate
doctrine in RICO suits against utilities.  He concluded that the
plaintiffs "must pursue their claims through 'the proper
government officials,' who may challenge these rates 'in
appropriate circumstances.'"

NY JUDGE APPROVES $100M SETTLEMENT IN SALOMON BROTHERS ACTION

     Judge Robert P. Patterson Jr. of the U.S. District Court for
the Southern District of New York on Aug. 5 approved a
$100 million settlement of claims in the Salomon Brothers
Treasury Litigation (In re Salomon Brothers Treasury Litigation,
SD NY, No. 91 Civ. 5471 [RPP]; see Civil RICO LR, March 1994,
P. 9,410).

     The defendants in the case include Salomon Brothers Inc.,
Steinhardt Management Co. Inc. and Caxton Corp.

     The suit was filed by investors who were allegedly injured
by defendants' (1) rigging the bids in auctions of Treasury two-
year notes conducted in April, May and June of 1991 and
(2) engaging in a squeeze on the market for those securities from
April 1991 to September 1991 in violation of Sections 10(b) and
20 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Sherman Act, the
Commodity Exchange Act and RICO.

     Under the terms of the agreement, Salomon will contribute
$66 million to the settlement fund; Steinhardt Management and
Caxton will pay the remaining $34 million.  The judge also
awarded the plaintiffs $25 million in attorneys' fees.

     Representing the plaintiffs are Stanley M. Grossman of
Pomerantz Haudek Block & Grossman and Jules Brody of Stull, Stull
& Brody.  Counsel for Salomon is Cravath, Swaine & Moore;
representing Steinhardt Management is Schulte Roth & Zabel; and
counsel for Caxton is Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft.  All of the

11TH CIR.: INTRODUCING BROKER, AGENT CANNOT COMPEL ARBITRATION

     An introducing broker/dealer and its agent were not third-
party beneficiaries of an arbitration agreement between the
plaintiff and a clearing broker and, therefore, cannot compel
arbitration of the plaintiff's securities, racketeering, common
law fraud, breach of fiduciary obligation and, under the Texas
Deceptive Trade Practices-Consumer Act, negligence and conspiracy
claims against them, said the 11th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals
on Aug. 19 (Taylor v. Investors Associates, Inc., et al., 11th
Cir., No. 93-5049).

               The panel said that the defendants did not qualify as
third party beneficiaries because an intent to benefit them was not
apparent from the construction of the arbitration agreement "in light
of all surrounding circumstances."

     According to court documents, co-defendant Mitchell
Goldberg, as agent for co-defendant Investors Associates, Inc.
(IAI), solicited plaintiff Don Taylor to buy and sell stock from
IAI.  On Jan. 6, 1992, Taylor purchased stock through IAI and,
the next day, signed a client's agreement with Prudential-Bache
Securities, which was to serve as clearing broker in the trading
arrangement.

     Taylor subsequently filed suit against IAI and Goldberg,
alleging violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934; Rule 10(b)(5); Section 12(2) of the Securities Act
of 1933; RICO; Texas Blue Sky Law; Texas Business and Commerce
Code; and the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices-Consumer Act.  The
defendants moved to stay proceedings and compel arbitration or
dismiss the action.

     The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas
concluded that the defendants could not compel arbitration, and
the appeals court panel affirmed in a per curiam opinion, which
adopted the trial court's decision.

     In his opinion below, U.S. District Judge William Justice
first noted that the arbitration clause did not mention IAI or
Goldberg by name or function, nor did those parties sign the
document.  Judge Justice rejected the defendants' contention that
they were included as parties to the pact through the use of
"you" (referring to Prudential) in the client's agreement,
because IAI allegedly supplied Taylor with the agreement.

     Second, Judge Justice said that the intent of the parties to
the arbitration agreement was manifest -- to arbitrate claims by
or against the clearing house concerning its handling of Taylor's
account.  In addition, a letter from Prudential, explaining that
it was not Taylor's broker, but his broker's clearing firm, makes
it clear that the defendants were independent from Prudential,
said the judge.

     Third, the defendants cannot rely on agency principles to
support their argument that they are entitled to enforce the
arbitration agreement, said the court.  Unlike the fact
situations in the cases cited by the defendants, here, the
disputed transaction did not involve the liquidation of stock
whereby the clearing house's services were employed, which might
make the clearing house a party to the suit, Judge Justice noted.
No claims in the suit pertain to Prudential's or Taylor's
accounts there, he said, and, hence, there was no contingent
right for the introducing broker to invoke the arbitration
agreement.

               Finally, with respect to the defendants' third-party
beneficiary argument, the defendants are not mentioned in the
arbitration agreement and no consent to arbitration with Goldberg
