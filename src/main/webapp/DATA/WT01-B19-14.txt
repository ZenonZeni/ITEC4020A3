         Appeal from the Superior Court of Riverside County


                Honorable Robert Spitzer, Judge


         OPENING BRIEF SUBMITTED ON BEHALF OF APPELLANT


                   STATEMENT OF APPEALABILITY

     This appeal is from a final judgment following trial and is

authorized by Penal Code section 1237.


                      STATEMENT OF THE CASE

     By an indictment filed on May 25, 1994, appellant was charged

with two counts of violations of the Health and Safety Code.  Count

1 alleged that appellant did wilfully sell, furnish, and

administer, and offer to sell, furnish, and administer, marijuana

and transport and give away, and offer to transport and give away,

and attempt to transport more than 28.5 grams of marijuana in

violation of, section 11360, subdivision (a) of the Health and


                               1
<HR>Safety Code, a felony.  Count 2 alleged that appellant did wilfully

possess marijuana for sale in violation of section 11359 of the

Health and Safety Code, a felony. (C.T. pp. 1-2.)

     A bench trial commenced on April 11, 1995. (R.T. p. 6.)  On

May 19, 1995, appellant was found guilty of transportation of

marijuana and possession of marijuana for the purpose of sale under

counts 1 and 2 of the indictment. (R.T. pp. 519-20.)

     Sentencing was conducted on July 10, 1995. (R.T. p. 523)  The

proceeding was suspended and formal probation was granted for a

period of 60 months. (R.T. pp. 535-539; C.T. pp. 271-273.)


                               2
<HR>                      STATEMENT OF FACTS

     Appellant is a member and priest of the Israel Zion Coptic

Church which is incorporated in the state of Wisconsin. (C.T. p.

71; 114 [Appellant's testimony at the August 29, 1994 hearing<SUP><A HREF="#1">1</A></SUP> was

admitted into evidence at trial. (R.T. pp. 9-10)].  The Israel

Zion Coptic Church is an offshoot of the Rastafarian movement and

the Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church, (R.T. pp. 334-342 and C.T. p.

84.) and is comprised of approximately 200 to 250 members. (C.T.

p. 74.)  The Israel Zion Coptic's doctrine incorporates the use of

marijuana, or ganja, as a sacrament during religious services and

gatherings. (C.T. pp. 71-73; 114.)

     In the past, appellant had attempted to provide the sacrament

for the church by growing marijuana in Wisconsin. (R.T. p. 392.)

However, he was arrested for this activity, and was thus prohibited

from growing the sacrament. (R.T. p. 392-393.)

     Appellant eventually decided to travel to San Diego to

purchase a supply of marijuana for the church's use. (R.T. pp.

391-394.)  Approximately $4,000.00 was collected from appellant and

two other church members in order to make the purchase. (R.T. 349-

395.)

     Appellant then travelled to San Diego and bought 40 pounds of

marijuana. (R.T. pp. 400-402.)  On March 27, 1994, appellant was

driving his automobile through the Temecula border patrol
__________________

     <SUP><A NAME="1">1</A></SUP>On August 29, 1994, the Consolidated Superior/Municipal
Courts of the State of California in and for the County of

<HR>checkpoint when he was stopped at the primary inspection area.

(C.T. p. 19-26 [A transcript of the Grand Jury proceedings was

admitted into evidence at trial. (R.T. p. 14)].)  Appellant's

vehicle was subsequently directed to the secondary inspection area

where a canine sniff was performed. (C.T. pp. 19-21.)

     The canine "alerted," and the border patrol conducted a search

of the vehicle. (C.T. pp. 21-23.)  Consequently, border patrol

agents located the 40 pounds of marijuana which appellant had

placed in two duffle bags in the trunk of his vehicle. (C.T. pp.

23-24.)  Agent Joel Ontiveros then advised appellant of his Miranda

rights and placed appellant under arrest. (C.T. p. 37.)  After

additional searching, agents also confiscated $2,350.00 cash

located in the interior of appellant's vehicle. (C.T. p. 39.)

<HR>                                I

          THERE WAS INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT A
          CONVICTION OF GUILT BASED UPON INTENT TO SELL
          MARIJUANA


<B>A.   Summary of Argument</B>

     Appellant was found guilty of possessing marijuana for

purposes of sale in violation of section 11369 of the Health and

Safety Code. (R.T. pp. 519-20.)  However, the evidence presented

at trial demonstrated that appellant had no intent to sell the

marijuana he had obtained.  Rather, the marijuana was to be given

away as a sacrament.

<B>B.   Standard of Review</B>

     In determining whether a reasonable trier of fact could have

found a defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, the appellate

court must view the evidence in a light most favorable to the

respondent and presume in support of the judgment the existence of

every fact the trier could reasonably deduce from the evidence.

(People v. Johnson (1980) 26 Cal.3d 557, 567-577.)  The court does

not, however, limit its review to the evidence favorable to the

respondent.  Rather, the task is two fold:  First, the court must

resolve the issue in the light of the whole record and may not

limit the appraisal to isolated bits of evidence selected by the

respondent.  Second, the court must judge whether the evidence of

each of the essential elements is substantial.  It is not enough

for the respondent simply to point to "some" evidence supporting

the finding, because not all surface conflicts of evidence remain


                               5
<HR>substantial in the light of other facts. (Id., at p. 577.)


<B>C.   Insufficient Evidence of Intent to Sell</B>

     Unlawful possession of a controlled substance for sale

requires proof the defendant possessed the contraband with the

intent of selling it. (People v. Meza (1995) 38 Cal.App.4th 1741,

1745.)  However, the evidence in this case establishes that the

appellant had no intention, whatsoever, of selling the marijuana he

obtained in California.

     At trial, the prosecution questioned appellant regarding his

intended use of the sacrament as follows:

     Q.   Well, isn't part of that 13 pounds going to go to
          some other people?

     A.   Possibly.  It probably would have.  It would have--
          it was a--it's the sacramental food or object that
          I need to practice my religion, and of course it
          would have been consumed that way within a
          communion and shared with others.

     Q.   But you're not going to break off, say, a pound or
          two and give it to somebody else?

     A.   I've given a pound or two to Brother Michael at
          times.

     Q.   So you just give him the pound?

     A.   Yes.

     . . . .

     Q.   Within your Church, though, you don't have any kind
          of like a --- you might see in Christian church an
          offering plate that people donate money to for the
          ganja to be purchased, do you?

     A.   No.

     Q.   It really comes from the money you earn from your
          work?

                               6
<HR>     A.   Right.  But I would--I would--brothers and sisters
          are free and welcomed to put some money towards--if
          that's what we have to continue to do and that's
          our access to the sacrament, then we'll do that.

     Q.   Do they do that from time to time?

     A.   Yes.

     Q.   And you talked about other people who might not be
          members of the Church.  If they come over and
          partake of the sacrament and stay with you for a
          day or so, do they sometimes contribute money?

     A.   No.  There's no--there's no--I don't require
          somebody to give me some money to be able to
          partake in the sacrament.

     Q.   I understand that.  I'm not saying you require.
          Sometimes do they--

     A.   I don't accept it.  I don't accept it at all.  To
          sit and partake of the sacrament with me, there's
          no--no, there is no money offering like that at
          all.

(R.T. pp. 406-407.)

     It is true that possession of a large amount of a controlled

substance "itself affords a reasonable inference of possession for

sale." (People v. Grant (1969) 1 C.A.3d 563, 570.)  However, the

evidence presented at trial entirely rebutted any reasonable

inference that the appellant was involved in illegal sale of a

controlled substance.  On the contrary, appellant's testimony has

established that he did not require others to pay money in exchange

for partaking in the sacrament.  Moreover, he would not accept

money for the sacrament, even if it was offered to him.  Given this

testimony, there is absolutely no basis upon which to support a

conviction of guilt for the possession of marijuana for sale in

violation of section 11359 of the Health and Safety Code.


                               7
<HR>                              II

          THE TRIAL COURT CANNOT SIDE-STEP THE FIRST
          AMENDMENT FREEDOM OF RELIGION ISSUE ON THE
          BASIS THAT APPELLANT'S ACTS CONSTITUTED A
          COMMERCIAL ACTIVITY


A.   Summary of the Argument

     Although the court acknowledged that appellant's "religious

practices may be constitutionally protected," it nevertheless

convicted appellant for illegal commercial activity, i.e.,

possessing and transporting marijuana, in violation of the Health

and Safety Code.  The court thus "side-stepped" the freedom of

religion issue.  Although appellant has been convicted of

possessing and transporting marijuana, he argues that his

constitutional right to free exercise of religion through the

partaking of the sacrament is meaningless without the right to

possess and transport that sacrament.  Thus, the court must address

the First Amendment issues presented in this case and determine

whether there is some compelling state interest which would justify

the burden which has been placed on appellant's religious freedom.


B.   Appellant's Church Affiliation

     The evidence presented at trial established that appellant was

a bona fide member of the Israel Zion Coptic Church. (R.T. pp.

518-519.)  Appellant testified as follows:

     Q.   . . . Do you follow a practice of a particular
          religion, Mr. Peck?

     A.   Yes, I do.


                              8
<HR>     Q.   What is that?

     A.   I follow the Israel Zion Coptic Church religion.

     Q.   Is that an organized church in some state?

     A.   Yes, it is.  We're incorporated in the state of
          Wisconsin.

     Q.   Do you have a particular position in the church
          that you occupy?

     A.   Yes, I do.  I'm an elder.  And as far as the
          incorporation of the church, I'm the president on
          the document.

     Q.   And would you characterized your position in the
          church as a lay person or an official or priest of
          the church?

     A.   I'm an official priest of the church.

     Q.   And did you, in fact, have in your possession 40
          pounds of marijuana or ganja sometime earlier in
          the year?

     A.   Yes, I did.

     Q.   Why did you have that in your possession, sir?

     A.   To obtain sacramental ganja for the members of my
          church.

(C.T. p. 71, 114 [Appellant's testimony at the August 29, 1994

hearing was admitted into evidence at trial. (R.T. pp. 9-10)].)

     As a member and priest of the Israel Zion Coptic Church, it

was necessary for appellant to obtain the sacramental marijuana, or

ganja, used in the religious practices.  Appellant testified to the

importance of this sacrament:

     Q.   Can you tell me how it is that ganja is a part of
          the religious practices that you practice?

     A.   The Coptic is a three-part doctrine, the way it was
          taught to me.  And the three elements that make up
          the body of Christ are the ganja, the word of
          truth, and the man.


                              9
<HR>     Q.   Do you feel, sir, that the--let me phrase it this
          way:  If ganja, or marijuana, was prohibited to
          you, could you practice the Israel Zion Coptic
          religion?

     A.   No.

     Q.   Is the prohibition of ganja or marijuana, does it
          have an effect on the services that you could
          perform in the church?

     A.   Well, it creates a burden, because we can be
          arrested for it.

     Q.   If you didn't have ganja or marijuana, would it be
          possible for you to conduct the services, the
          sacramental services of the church?

     A.   No.

     Q.   If you--during the church services, what part does
          ganja play in the church service?

     A.   Ganja is shared as communion.  It's the body and
          blood of Christ.  When we share the ganja and touch
          upon the subject of the King, which is the word of
          truth, and blend that with man, ourselves, then we
          are--we are Christ in the flesh.  That is Christ in
          the flesh.

     Q.   When you use ganja, do you use it as something that
          will allow you to achieve a particular state of
          mind?

     A.   No.  It's the herb, the word, and the man.  Those
          three elements together are Christ, that we then
          become a member of that body, which is Christ.

(C.T. pp. 72-73.)

     Based upon this evidence, the trial court found that for more

than ten years appellant had been a practicing member of the Israel

Zion Coptic Church, a religious organization incorporated under the

laws of the state of Wisconsin. (R.T. pp. 518-519.)  Furthermore,

the court found that a principal tenet of the Israel Zion Coptic

Church was to use marijuana as a sacramental herb. (R.T. p. 519.)


                               10
<HR>     The courts have considered similar cases involving controlled

substances and the defense of free exercise of religion in the

past, and yet failed to reach the First Amendment issue.  However,

these cases did not present evidence of a bona fide membership in

a belief system which reguired the use of marijuana as an integral

part of the religion, such that prohibition of the herb would

completely inhibit the religious practice.

     For example, in People v. Mitchell (1966) 244 Cal.App.2d

176, the defendant was charged with possession of marijuana and

with planting and cultivating marijuana in violation of the Health

and Safety Code.  The defendant argued that his use of marijuana

was in accordance with his religious beliefs, and therefore, he had

a constitutionally protected right to possess and use the narcotic.

(Id., at p. 177.)

     However, on cross examination, Mitchell acknowledged that he

was not a member of any organized religion.  Further, when asked

whether his smoking of marijuana was pursuant to a religious

practice, he stated, "in the sense that I believe that religion is

related to law or constitutionality, I was exercising the freedom

in my own home to smoke something actually better than tobacco."

(Id., at p. 181.)

     The Mitchell court thus found that the defendant had offered

no evidence that his use of marijuana constituted a religious

practice in any sense of that term. (Id, at p. 182.)  The court

concluded that because the record raised no issue as to the

exercise of religion, it was unnecessary to address the subject.


                               11
<HR>(Id., at pp. 182-183.)

     Similarly, in People v. Collins (1969) 273 Cal.App.2d 486, the

defendant testified that he used marijuana in order to extend and

intensify his ability to engage in meditative communication with

the Supreme Being, to attain spiritual peace through union with God

the Father, and to search out the ultimate meaning of life and

nature. (Id., at p. 487.)  However, the record demonstrated that

the defendant did not worship or sanctify marijuana, but merely

employed its hallucinogenic biochemical properties as an auxiliary

to a desired capacity for communication. (Id., at p. 487.)  Thus,

the court merely held that the existing law did not bar the

defendant from a practice which was indispensable to the pursuit of

his faith. (Id., at p. 488.)

     Unlike Mitchell and Collins, however, appellant in the instant

case has proven that he is a bona fide member of a legitimate

religious organization, that marijuana is an object of worship to

him, and that his use of marijuana as a sacrament is central,

integral, and necessary to the practice of that religion.

Therefore, the trial court had no rationale to side-step the issue

of free exercise of religion which is presented in this case.


C.   Appellant's Right to Obtain the Church's Sacrament

     The trial court convicted appellant for the transportation of

marijuana in violation of section 11360 of the Health and Safety

Code. (R.T. pp. 519-20.)  In doing so, the court held that

although appellant's "religious practices may be constitutionally


                               12
<HR>protected," his actions on or about March 24, 1994 in California

constituted "commercial activities outside the practice of [his]

religion, and therefore, were not constitutionally protected."

(R.T. p. 533.)  However, the result of such a ruling is to

acknowledge appellant's right to practice his religion, and yet

effectively deny him the means to go about exercising those

beliefs.

     Appellant testified that he had tried to avoid the

transportation of marijuana by growing the sacrament himself:

     Well, we had tried to provide our own sacrament.  I had
     grown the herb in Verona, Wisconsin, and was arrested for
     it.  I tried to provide it growing it with Brother
     Michael in Soldiers Grove, and we were unable to provide
     it that way.  The only alternative that was left was to
     purchase it somewhere.

(R.T. p. 392.)

     In sum, the court has told appellant that he has a right to

practice his religion (which includes the sincere belief in the

worship and use of marijuana as a sacrament); however, he may not

grow the ganja himself, and he may not obtain it by transporting it

from another location.  Such a result is not only disingenuous, but

it renders appellant's right to "free exercise of his religion"

absolutely meaningless.  The court must therefore address the First

Amendment issues in this case and set forth any compelling state

interest which would justify the burden which has been placed upon

Appellant's religious practices.<SUP><A HREF="#2">2</A></SUP>

                               13
<HR><B>D.   Peyote and the Native American Church</B>

     At trial, Randolf White, a member of the Native American

Church, testified with regard to the use of peyote within the

Church:

     Q.   Mr. White, in regards to your religious
          affiliation, sir, are you affiliated with a
          particular church or organization?

     A.   Yes, I am.

     Q.   What is that, sir?

     A.   Native American Church

     Q.   Is that Native American--is that the Native
          American Church of North America Incorporated?

     A.   It is.

     Q.   Are you a member of any particular sect or part of
          that religion?

     A.   I'm active in the group called the Ghost Clan of
          the Native American Church.

     Q.   As part of the rituals of the Ghost Clan, do you
          consume peyote?

     A.   Yes.

     Q.   Do you also consume cannabis as part of those
          rituals?

     A.   Sometimes, yes.

(R.T. pp. 36-37.)


     Q.   Mr. White, are you aware of whether or not there is
          a system in place that allows or accommodates the
          distribution of peyote?

     A.   There is such a system, yes.

     Q.   Could you explain to us how it works?


                               14
<HR>     A.   Someone who wishes to be a peyote distributor
          applies to the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous
          Drugs--or I guess it's the DEA now--for a permit to
          get what's called a narcotics dealership.  Peyote
          is a Schedule 1 controlled substance which makes it
          extraordinarily difficult to meet the reguirements
          of the government, but essentially the state of
          Texas and the federal government have gotten
          together.  There is a permit issued by the DEA for
          the narcotics permission license.  It's issued to
          the location rather than the individual.  It's a
          location that's owned by the church, and there are
          certain security measures which are reguired to be
          in place that I'm not at liberty to discuss.
          Essentially, these are all located in the state of
          Texas, primarily Amarillo City.

     Q.   When the people go out and gather the peyote
          buttons from the field, do they go to an
          intermediary, one of these distributors in general?

     A.   In general, people--members of the Native American
          Church don't have the time to harvest the peyote
          themselves because it's a laborious and time-
          consuming affair.  It's kept by these licensed
          distributors.  They hold it.  The peyote itself is
          never sold as such.  However, you can place a
          monetary value on the peyote, which at this time is
          about $125 per thousand buttons of various sizes.

          Sometimes the cash payment is actually made, but
          it's generally understood the peyote--the medicine
          itself is a gift.  It's not subject to cash, and
          this is part of the bylaws of the church, and it
          is--when you take the peyote--let's say you did
          take it.  You leave something there.  It might be
          a cigar in a plastic case where you picked up the
          first peyote button.  But the philosophy is if you
          take something, you leave something.

          The same philosophy holds true later in what might,
          in other words, be described as commerce where
          there's a trading.  A barter agreement takes place.
          If I would give you a gift, it would not be
          unreasonable to give me another gift.  Some people
          say they buy it, but technically they try to avoid
          it.

     Q.   In obtaining the medicine, peyote, do you have to--
          you have to arrange for transportation from that
          area of Texas to wherever it is in the United
          States that it is being used?


                               15
<HR>     A.   Yes.

     Q.   Does peyote grow naturally in this area of the Rio
          Grand Valley?

     A.   No.

     Q.   So if you were in Oklahoma and you wanted to
          practice your religion, you would necessarily have
          to get that from Texas to Oklahoma somehow?

     A.   You would either do that, or you would have to grow
          it yourself.

(R.T. pp. 43-45.)

     Mr. White's testimony reveals that a state and federal system

has been established for the harvesting, distribution, and

transportation of peyote, a Schedule I narcotic, for use in the

religious services of the Native American Church.  To deny the

Israel Zion Coptic Church members the establishment of a similar

system is simply to discriminate against this religious

organization.  Thus, appellant's right to the free exercise of his

religion requires that he not only be allowed to harvest the

marijuana necessary for the sacrament, but that he also be allowed

to transport marijuana, if necessary, to his place of worship.

<HR>                             III

          THE TRIAL COURT CANNOT SIDE-STEP THE FIRST
          AMENDMENT ISSUE AND IMPOSE PROBATION
          CONDITIONS WHICH BURDEN APPELLAAT'S FREEDOM OF
          ASSOCIATION AND FREE EXERCISE OF RELIGION


<B>A.   Summary of the Argument</B>

     Under the terms of appellant's probation, he is prohibited

from associating with anyone who uses marijuana.  However, such a

prohibition effectively prevents appellant from associating with

his church brethren given that members are typically marijuana

users.  Before appellant's right of religious association can be

burdened, the court must find some compelling state interest.

However, the trial court, in "side-stepping" this First Amendment

issue, has failed to designate such a compelling state interest

which would justify the infringement on appellant's right to

associate.  Likewise, the probation conditions prohibiting

appellant from using marijuana must also be justified by a finding

of a compelling state interest.


<B>B.   Factual Backaround</B>

     Appellant was sentenced on July 10, 1995. (R.T. p. 523.)  The

proceeding was suspended and formal probation was granted for a

period of 60 months under certain terms and conditions.  Under the

terms of probation, appellant is, inter alia, not to associate with

any unrelated person known to be a possessor, user, or trafficker

of controlled substances, and not to possess or use any controlled

substance. (R.T. pp. 536.)


                               17
<HR><B>C.   Freedom of Association</B>

     Although the freedom of association is not explicitly set out

in the First Amendment, the right to associate with others in

pursuit of a wide variety of political, social, economic, and

cultural ends, including religious beliefs, has long been held to

be implicit in the freedoms of speech, assembly, and petition.

(Roberts v. United States Jaycees (1984) 468 U.S. 609, 622 [82

L.Ed. 2d 462, 104 S.Ct. 3244]; Healy v. James (1972) 408 U.S. 169,

181 [33 L.Ed.2d 266, 280, 92 S.Ct. 2338].)

     The freedom to associate with the persons of one's choice,

without unwarranted governmental intervention or interference, is

divided into two components: the freedom of intimate association

and the freedom of expressive association. (Roberts v. United

States Jaycees, sunra, 468 U.S. 609, 617-618.)

     Intimate association stands constitutionally protected because

"choices to enter into and maintain certain intimate human

relationships must be secured against undue intrusion by the State

because of the role of such relationships in safeguarding the

individual freedom that is central to our constitutional scheme."

(Roberts v. United States Jaycees, supra, 468 U.S. 609, 617-618.)

Thus, "freedom of [intimate] association receives protection as a

fundamental element Of personal liberty. (Roberts v. United States

Jaycees, supra, 468 U.S. 609, 618.)

     Freedom of expressive association stands protected as an

"indispensable means of preserving" the liberty to "associate for

the purpose of engaging in those activities protected by the First


                               18
<HR>Amendment--speech, assembly, petition for the redress of

grievances, and the exercise of religion." (Roberts v. United

States Jaycees, supra, 468 U.S. 609, 618.)

     The right to associate for expressive purposes is not,

however, absolute.  Infringements on that right may be justified by

regulations adopted to serve compelling state interests, unrelated

to the suppression of ideas, that cannot be achieved through means

significantly less restrictive of associational freedoms.

(Roberts, 468 U.S. at 623.)

     The probation condition which prohibits appellant from

associating with any unrelated person known to be a user of

controlled substances effectively prohibits appellant from

associating with his brethren in the Israel Zion Coptic Church,

given that the use marijuana is a principal tenet of their

religion. (R.T. p. 519.)  Before appellant's freedom of

association can be infringed, however, there must first be a

finding of some compelling state interest which justifies the

burden.

     The trial court avoided the First Amendment issues in this

case, and convicted appellant for transportation and possession of

marijuana under the Health and Safety Code.  However, even if the

crimes under which appellant was convicted did not implicate a

burden on his religious freedom, the terms of probation do create

such a burden.  Thus, the issue of a compelling state interest must

be addressed, and the court should not be allowed to side-step the

matter.  In addition, without a finding of some compelling state


                               19
<HR>interest which would justify the burden on appellant's religious

association, the condition prohibiting appellant from associating

with marijuana users must be stricken.


<B>D.   Other Terms of probation</B>

     The terms of probation also included the conditions that

appellant would not possess or use any controlled substances unless

medically prescribed, and that he would submit to chemical tests of

blood, breath, and urine, and physical tests for the detection of

controlled substances. (R.T. p. 536.)  However, the trial court

found that "a principal tenet of the Israel Zion Coptic Church is

to use marijuana as a sacramental herb. . ." and that "Church

members believe that God is experienced or that one may commune

with God through the smoking of marijuana." (R.T. p. 519.)  Thus,

by instituting probation terms which prohibit appellant from using

marijuana, the trial court has burdened appellant's freedom of

religion.  However, the trial court then failed to address the

First Amendment issues, as discussed more fully below.  In choosing

to evade these issues, the trial court has failed to designate a

compelling state interest which would justify the probational

infringements upon appellant's right to free exercise of his

religion.  Thus, these conditions must also be stricken.

<HR>                               IV

          APPELLANT'S USE OF MARIJUANA IS PROTECTED BY
          THE FIRST AMENDMENT'S FREE EXERCISE CLAUSE


<B>A.   Summary of the Argument</B>

     Appellant has been a member of the Israel Zion Coptic Church

for more than ten years. (R.T. pp. 518-519.)  As such, he

considers marijuana to be a sacrament as well as an actual object

of worship. (R.T. p. 519.)  Thus, appellant argues that the First

Amendment's free exercise clause protects his use of the sacrament

during worship.  Furthermore, appellant contends that there is no

compelling state interest which would justify the state's

infringement upon his use of marijuana in the free exercise of his

religion.

<B>B.   Applicable Law</B>

     Appellant contends that his use of marijuana is protected by

the free exercise clause of the First Amendment.<SUP><A HREF="#3">3</A></SUP>

     The Health and Safety Code statutes which deal with the use,

possession, and sale of marijuana and hashish were enacted pursuant

to a legislative determination that such laws promote the public

health, safety, and welfare, and are necessary for the protection

of society as a whole. (People v. Aguiar (1968) 257 Cal.App.2d

597, 601.)
___________________

     <SUP><A NAME="3">3</A></SUP>The First Amendment provides in pertinent part, "Congress
shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or
prohibiting the free exercise thereof, . . . ."  The First
Amendment is made applicable to the states through the liberty
component of the Fourteenth Amendment. (Cantwell v. Connecticut
(1940) 310 U.S. 296, 303, 84 L.Ed. 1213, 1217-1218, 60 S.Ct. 900.)


                               21
<HR>     Appellant argues that these statutes unconstitutionally

infringe upon the free exercise of his religion by prohibiting his

use of marijuana, a sacrament in the Israel Zion Coptic Church.  In

support of his argument, appellant relies upon People v. Woody

(1964) 61 Cal.2d 716.

     In Woody, a group of Navajo Native Americans performed

religious ceremonies involving the use of peyote.  The evidence in

Woody demonstrated that the Navajo considered peyote not only a

sacrament, but an actual object of worship similar to the bread and

wine in certain Christian churches. (Woody, supra, 61 Cal.2d 716,

721.)

     The Navajo were convicted of violating former Health and

Safety Code section 11500.  In reversing that conviction, the

California Supreme Court held that the state may abridge religious

practices only upon a determination that some compelling state

interest outweighs the defendant's interests in religious freedom.

(Woody, supra, 61 Cal.2d 716, 718.)  The Court then set forth a

two-pronged test with respect to the defense of religious freedom:

First it must be determined whether the statute in question imposes

any burden upon the free exercise of the defendant's religion, and

second, if there is such a burden, whether some compelling state

interest justifies the infringement. (Woody, sutra, 61 Cal.2d 716,

718, citing, Sherbert v. Verner (1963) 374 U.S. 398 [10 L.Ed 2d

965, 83 S.Ct. 1790].)

     In Woody, the Court held that the Navajo's use of peyote was

such an integral part of their religious faith that it would be


                               22
<HR>impossible to prohibit its use without inhibiting the practice of

the faith itself, and therefore, prohibition of the use of peyote

would constitute a burden on their exercise of religion. (Woody,

supra, 61 Cal.2d 716, 716.)  The Woody Court then found that the

evidence indicated there was no compelling reason for the

prohibition of Peyotism.  Specifically, peyote was not used in

place of proper medical care, and there was no evidence that the

Navajo who used peyote were more liable to become addicted to other

narcotics than non-peyote-using Navajo.  Additionally, the record

did not substantiate the state's fear of indoctrination of small

children.  Finally, the expert evidence demonstrated that the use

of peyote presented no permanent deleterious injury to the Navajo.

(Woody, 61 Cal.2d at 722.)

    In Employment Division Department of Human Resources of Oregon

v. Smith (1990) 494 U.S. 872 [108 L. Ed. 2d 876], the Supreme Court

held that under the Free Exercise Clause, a law that burdens

religious practice need not be justified by a compelling

governmental interest if it is neutral and of general

applicability.  However, Congress responded to that Supreme Court

decision by enacting The Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993,

42 U.S. 2OOObb.  The Religious Freedom Restoration Act, in its

declaration of purpose, states that Congress finds "in Employment

Division v. Smith (1990) 494 U.S. 872 [108 L.Ed.2d 876, 110 S.Ct.

1595], the Supreme Court virtually eliminated the requirement that

the government justify burdens on religious exercise imposed by

laws neutral toward religion."  Congress thus enacted the Religious


                               23
<HR>Freedom Restoration Act in order "to restore the compelling

interest test as set forth in Sherbert v. Verner (1963) 374 U.S.

398 [10 L.Ed.2d 965, 83 S.Ct. 1790] and Wisconsin v. Yoder (1972)

406 U.S. 205 [32 L.Ed.2d 15, 92 S.Ct. 1526] and to guarantee its

application in all cases where free exercise of religion is

substantially burdened." (42 U.S.C. 2OOObb, subd. (b) (1).)


<B>C.   Burden on Appellant's Free Exercise of Religion</B>

     Like the peyote used by the Navajo church in Woody, the

evidence in the instant case demonstrated that the Israel Zion

Coptic Church considers marijuana to be a sacrament as well as an

actual object of worship.  At trial, appellant testified on cross-

examination as follows:

     Q.   You spoke yesterday about the importance of
          religion to your life.  Now describe for us the
          importance of marijuana, ganja, to your religion.

     A.   The herb was part of the whole doctrine that I
          received when I came and reasoned with brothers in
          the church.  They--they told me about the
          Rastafarian doctrine, that it was a three-part
          doctrine, it was the herb, the word, and the man.
          They explained that to me.  They said that the man
          is what we are, and that the word is the truth and
          the wisdom and understanding that God has given to
          us, and the herb is the sacrament, the burnt
          offering that we offer to God, and that the smoke
          carries our prayers up to God then.

     Q.   What I'm asking is not for you to describe the
          particular uses and meaning of marijuana, but just
          to tell us how important it is to the religion
          itself.

     A.   It's one of the three parts of the Trinity, the
          herb, the word, and the man.

     Q.   What I'm saying is--


                               24
<HR>     A.   Without the herb, you wouldn't have the Holy
          Trinity.  You would have the word and the man.  It
          would be a two-part doctrine.  It wouldn't be a
          three-part doctrine.  To be a Trinity, there has to
          be three.  Herb, word, and man.  You can't take any
          one of those parts away and have that three-part
          doctrine.

     Q.   All right.

     A.   It's so important that if you take it away, you no
          longer have a three-part doctrine.  You no longer
          have a holy Trinity.

     Q.   Would it be fair to say that the ganja is at the
          center of the belief?

     A.   When you have three things--I don't know if it
          would be at the center.

     Q.   But sharing with those other two?

     A.   Pardon me.

     Q.   Sharing with those other two, is it at the center?

     A.   It--right.

     Q.   And you said that your life yesterday would lose
          meaning without your religion?

     A.   Absolutely.

     Q.   So would it be fair to say that your world revolves
          around ganja?

     . . . .

     A.   My world revolves around ganja?  Ganja is a part of
          my religion.  It's a part of my spiritual
          expression and understanding and trying to
          understand the mysteries of God.  Whether my--my
          world revolves around ganja as much as it revolves
          around the word of God and my brothers and sisters.

     Q.   When you say that--when you describe that
          centrality of marijuana to your beliefs, how do you
          know that?  How do you know that marijuana is
          critical to your religion, or ganja?


                               25
<HR>     A.   I know that because that's how I began to revelate.
          That's how I began to understand.  And the mystery
          of the scriptures was open to me.

     Q.   This is personal enlightenment?

     A.   Yes, it's personal enlightenment.

     Q.   I assume you had that enlightenment while consuming
          ganja?

     A.   Yes, I did.

(R.T. pp. 377-379.)

     Appellant's testimony demonstrated that under the Israel Zion

Coptic doctrine, marijuana, or ganja, is a sacrament as well as a

part of the holy Trinity.  It is one of the three central elements

of the Israel Zion Coptic doctrine, and is critical to the exercise

of the religion and to personal enlightenment.

     The trial court's decision also reflected that the evidence

had proven the importance and centrality of marijuana to the Israel

Zion Coptic Church.  Specifically. the trial judge held:

     The Court will further find that a principal tenet of the
     Israel Zion Coptic Church is to use marijuana as a
     sacramental herb in an unstructured fashion not confined
     to any particular time/place, or ritual of worship.
     Church members believe that God is experienced or that
     one may commune with God through the smoking of
     marijuana. (R.T. p. 519.)

As in Woody, the evidence in the instant case demonstrated that

appellant's use of marijuana is such an integral part of his

religious faith that it would be impossible to prohibit its use

without inhibiting the practice of the faith itself.  Prohibition

of appellant's use of marijuana would constitute a burden on the

free exercise of his religion.  Therefore, appellant passes the

first prong of the Woody test.


                               26
<HR><B>D.   Compelling State Interest</B>

     The evidence presented at trial demonstrated that there is no

compelling state interest which justifies the impingement of

appellant's free exercise of religion.  The testimony of John P.

Morgan, M.D.<SUP><A HREF="#4">4</A></SUP>, included a discussion of a 1995 study performed in

Jamaica regarding the toxicological effects of marijuana. (R.T.

pp. 150-154.)  The study was funded by the United States National

Institute on Drug Abuse, NIDA. (R.T. p. 151.)  According to this

study, the long-term effects of high doses<SUP><A HREF="#5">5</A></SUP> of cannabis were

extremely modest.

     Specifically, there was no evidence of impaired immune systems

or impaired pulmonary function, and no evidence of cognitive or

psychological dysfunction. (R.T. p. 153.)  Likewise, there are no

epidemiologic studies showing any increased prevalence of cancer in

marijuana smokers (R.T. p. 163).  And there is no evidence of brain

damage as a result of marijuana use. (R.T. p. 168.)  Furthermore,

there is no evidence that cannabis causes harm to the endocrine

system or the reproductive system, (R.T. p. 169) and no evidence of

<HR>damage to newborn babies whose mothers are very heavy ganja users.

(R.T. p. 171.)

     Surprisingly, despite the various studies funded by the United

States Government, the only adverse effect which has been proven is

that chronic marijuana smokers sometimes show bronchitis, or

irritation in their trachea and bronchiolus. (R.T. p. 161.)

However, Dr. Morgan testified that such changes are very minor and

will resolve when the marijuana is discontinued. (R.T. p. 161.)

     The increased incidence and severity of bronchitis in

marijuana users is much less than that of tobacco smokers. (R.T.

pp. 161-162.)  Dr. Morgan testified that:

     . . . [T]he kind of change seen in the large bronchiolus
     is not the kind of change that we see in tobacco smokers
     in the periphery of the lungs which leads to chronic
     bronchitis and emphysema.  None of the cannabis smokers
     have progressed at all to the pulmonary cripples that we
     see in chronic bronchitis and emphysema. (R.T. p. 161.)

     Further, unlike tobacco, cannabis has an extremely low

addiction potential. (R.T. p. 156-157.)  There is no evidence that

the use of marijuana will lead to "hard drugs." (R.T. p. 181-182.)

With regard to addiction and toxicity, Dr. Morgan testified:

     Q.   What is your opinion as to the relative toxicity of
          cannabis as opposed to alcohol?

     A.   Basically, cannabis is much, much lower in toxicity
          than alcohol any way you look at it.  Even given
          that most individuals who consume alcohol consume
          it at relatively low doses and don't have much
          harm, those individuals who consume it in high
          doses often experience harm, harm of a serious
          sort, and cannabis does not produce that kind of
          harm.

          Tobacco is a slightly different issue but still a
          very important one.  Tobacco, because of its means
          of administration and to some degree because of the


                               28
<HR>          effects of nicotine, is also a substance that in
          chronic use produces significant harm to humans and
          much, much greater than this shown for cannabis.

     Q.   Has cannabis ever demonstrated an addictive
          potential as nicotine?

     A.   Not addiction, addiction as an exponentially tested
          concept, and without being wordy, people still
          argue about what constitutes addiction, but there
          certainly--even though there are a few users of
          cannabis that appear to use in very, very high
          doses and say to themselves and to others I wish I
          could stop but I find it hard to stop, and those
          people could be described as having an addictive-
          type behavior.  The prevalence of that is so low in
          comparison to tobacco users or even to alcohol
          users that I prefer to say that cannabis has an
          extremely low addiction potential.

(R.T. pp. 156-157.)

     Dr. Morgan also testified that the Israel Zion Coptic Church

members follow certain rituals to prevent adverse effects from

marijuana use:

     Q.   Briefly for the record, could you describe what you
          mean by a ritualistic use from your observation or
          from the reports you've learned?

     A.   When I use the term "ritual," I'm talking about a
          rule-bound circumstance of use.  Whether the rules
          are written out or lectured about is not important
          but that the rules tend to be followed.

          For example, the Zion Coptic users, both the Israel
          and the Ethiopian sect, tend to use [marijuana] in
          groups, although not always.  They tend to use it
          in the context of a process they call reasoning in
          which they will sit and talk to each other and
          explore the spirituality of their lives and the
          impact of the drug. . . .

     Q.   Do you have an opinion as to what effect this
          ritualistic use has on abuse potential of cannabis?

     A.   I certainly do.  When people use drugs in a rule-
          bound, constrained ritualistic fashion, they really
          are protected from toxicity.  They are protected
          from both behavioral and other kinds of harmfulness


                               29
<HR>          because, of course, it's rules that keeps us all
          safe when using dangerous substances and dangerous
          things.  You know, the power tool manufacturers
          publish rules on how you should use power tools,
          and if you follow those rules, by and large you
          will be protected.

(R.T. pp. 158-159.)

     The evidence presented at trial demonstrated that marijuana,

even in very high doses, is a relatively benign substance, and is

not nearly as detrimental as other legalized substances such as

alcohol and tobacco.  Given these factors, there is no compelling

state interest which would justify the state's infringement upon

appellant's use of marijuana in the free exercise of his religion.

     In conclusion, the final passage of Woody speaks to the

importance of preserving the right to free religious expression:

          We know that some will urge that it is more
     important to subserve the rigorous enforcement of
     narcotic laws than to carve out of them an exception for
     a few believers in a strange faith.  They will say that
     the exception may produce problems of enforcement and
     that the dictate of the state must overcome the beliefs
     of a minority of Indians.  But the problems of
     enforcement here do not inherently differ from those of
     other situations which call for the detection of fraud.
     On the other hand, the right to free religious expression
     embodies a precious heritage of our history.  In a mass
     society, which presses at every point toward conformity,
     the protection of self-expression, however unique, of the
     individual and the group becomes ever more important.
     The varying currents of the subcultures that flow into
     the mainstream of our national life give it depth and
     beauty. . . .

(Woody, supra, 61 Cal.2d 716, 727-728.)


                               30
<HR>                          CONCLUSION

     Although the appellant was found guilty of possessing

marijuana for purposes of sale, the evidence presented at trial

demonstrated that appellant had no intent to sell the marijuana he

had obtained.  Rather, the marijuana was to be given away as a

sacrament.  Hence, the judgment of conviction should be vacated.

     Further, the trial court acknowledged that the appellant

sincerely adheres to a religion which considers marijuana to be a

sacrament as well as an actual object of worship, and that the

appellant's "religious practices may be constitutionally

protected."  Nevertheless, the trial court convicted appellant for

illegal commercial activity, i.e., possessing and transporting

marijuana.  The court thus "side-stepped" the freedom of religion

issue.  Appellant's constitutional right to free exercise of

religion through the partaking of the sacrament is meaningless

without the right to possess and transport that sacrament.  Thus,

the First Amendment issues presented in this case must be remanded

for a determination of whether there is some compelling state

interest which would justify the burden placed on appellant's

religious freedoms.

     Finally, the terms of probation prohibiting the appellant from

associating with anyone who uses marijuana effectively prevent

appellant from associating with his church brethren.  This issue

must also be remanded for a determination regarding any compelling

state interest which would justify the burden on the appellant's

First Amendment rights.
