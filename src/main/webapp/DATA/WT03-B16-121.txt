Teachers of constitutional law courses today are served well by an array
of good casebooks that take a variety of approaches. Lucius Barker and Twiley
Barker have written the successive editions of CIVIL LIBERTIES AND THE CONSTITUTION
with a clear and consistent approach, one of emphasizing the broader political
and social context of civil liberties law. With this approach, their book
is not aimed primarily at courses that give a strong emphasis to legal analysis
of civil liberties decisions. Rather, it fits best in a course whose instructor
gives substantial attention to constitutional politics as well as constitutional
law.<BR>
<BR>
Like most other constitutional law books for political science courses,
CIVIL LIBERTIES AND THE CONSTITUTION is written at an appropriate level
for upper-division students. It could be used in courses ranging in length
from one quarter to two semesters. Depending on their course formats and
use of additional readings, instructors in shorter courses may wish to exclude
some text material and cases. <BR>
<BR>
The book begins with an introductory chapter, followed by a series of chapters
with text material and case excerpts in the various areas of civil liberties.
By chapter, civil liberties law is divided into six areas: religious liberty;
freedom of expression, assembly and association; the rights of the accused;
racial discrimination; political participation (chiefly legislative apportionment
and racial discrimination in the electoral process); and sex, privacy, and
property.<BR>
<BR>
The introductory chapter deals primarily with the political and social context
of civil liberties law, including the roles of interest groups and of the
other branches of government in constitutional politics. The text material
in later chapters focuses chiefly on cases and legal issues, and the book
assuredly is a text on the LAW of civil liberties. But the authors frequently
refer to the politics that shape the Supreme Court's decisions and to the
impact of those decisions. For instance, they give some emphasis to the
effect of changes in the Court's personnel on its doctrinal positions. Readers
gain a clear sense of the larger context of constitutional law that Barker
and Barker seek to emphasize.<BR>
<BR>
Within chapters, the text and cases cover the great majority of issue areas
to which the Supreme Court has given substantial attention. There are a
few areas covered in some courses that the book does not treat as separate
topics. In equal protection, for instance, the authors focus on race, gender,
and economic status; the text does not have sections on other distinctions
such as that between citizens and non-citizens. To take another example,
conflicts between national security and freedom of expression are discussed
chiefly in the context of First Amendment doctrines, and there is no section
devoted specifically to the national security topic.<BR>
<BR>
Discussions of individual issue areas address a wide range of specific issues
within them. But the text material does not offer a comprehensive treatise
on the areas that it covers; rather, it provides a picture of how the law
has developed on the most important issues in each area, especially those
that have been prominent in the Supreme Court's decisions. For instance,
the section on the 4th Amendment focuses on the exclusionary rule and on
warrantless searches rather than describing all the general principles for
interpretation of the 4th Amendment. (Wiretapping also is discussed, in
the context of privacy.) In this respect the book follows what is probably
the majority practice in constitutional law texts for political science
courses. One advantage of this approach is that it helps to protect students
from becoming overwhelmed with the array of legal issues and decisions in
each area.<BR>
<BR>
The book goes beyond constitutional issues to examine some statutory questions
concerning discrimination. Among the cases<BR>

included are some dealing with affirmative action programs under federal
statutes, WARDS COVE V. ATONIO (1989) on &quot;disparate impact&quot; under
Title VII, and GROVE CITY COLLEGE V. BELL (1984) on the scope of coverage
of Title IX. Instructors easily could omit such cases and the associated
text material if they wish. But I think that the book's inclusion of statutory
issues is a good feature, because it helps students to understand the importance
of both constitutional and statutory provisions in defining rights as well
as the interrelationship between them.<BR>
<BR>
The text material is very well written: it is both clear and interesting,
and as a result it communicates effectively with students. This, of course,
is a major virtue of the book. On the whole, material also is organized
well within chapters. The number of excerpted cases in each area is within
the standard range for political science casebooks, though probably smaller
than average. To take some examples, there are fourteen cases in the freedom
of expression chapter, thirteen on the rights of the accused, and thirteen
on racial discrimination. <BR>
<BR>
The authors provide a mix of major decisions from earlier eras and decisions
that present the Court's current and recent positions on important issues.
On capital punishment, the book includes GREGG V. GEORGIA (1976) along with
STANFORD V. KENTUCKY (1989) on execution of juveniles and McCLESKEY V. KEMP
(1987) on racial discrimination; on search and seizure, it includes MAPP
V. OHIO (1961), U.S. V. LEON (1984) (the &quot;good faith&quot; exception
to the exclusionary rule), and CALIFORNIA V. GREENWOOD (1988) (warrantless
search of garbage). I like the selection of cases. Inevitably, some decisions
that individual instructors would want students to read --including a few
decisions that might be considered landmarks -- are not included. But the
selected cases offer a good sample of major decisions, with a balance among
topics and types of decisions. And they serve well in documenting shifts
over time in the Court's collective preferences and the resulting policies
on a number of issues. <BR>
<BR>
The editing of cases emphasizes their settings and the justices' arguments
and holdings on the most fundamental civil liberties issues; the authors
are less concerned with conveying the Court's position on all the legal
issues in each case. Thus, for instance, material on the standing issue
is excised from ROE V. WADE. The editing is effective in achieving the authors'
goals. The opinions are very readable, and I think they communicate the
gist of cases quite well. The excerpts are particularly good in making clear
the essence of disagreements among members of the Court in particular cases.<BR>
<BR>
As my comments suggest, I think that CIVIL LIBERTIES AND THE CONSTITUTION
has some major strengths. First, the book's consistent reflection of its
authors' concern with a balance between constitutional law and constitutional
politics serves well the needs of instructors who emphasize the political
context of constitutional law in their courses. Second, the readability
of both the text and the case excerpts enhances the book's value for students
and increases the freedom of instructors to go beyond the material covered
in the book during class sessions. This is a fine book both in itself and
as a text in civil liberties courses. <BR>
