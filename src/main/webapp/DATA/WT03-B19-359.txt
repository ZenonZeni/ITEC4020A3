To all book reviewers for "Chemistry in Australia".<br>
<p>
Greetings, Happy New Year and thanks for your help in 1996.<br>
<p>
I have established an e-mail list to which I have subscribed<br>
all reviewers whose e-mail address is known to me. This is<br>
the first message I have sent out to the list.<br>
<p>
The list is intended for:-<br>
<p>
1. Messages from the book review editors indicating books<br>
   awaiting review and other general matters.<br>
2. Messages from the "Chemistry in Australia" editor to<br>
   book reviwers.<br>
3. Messages from book reviewers to other book reviewers on<br>
   matters of general interest.<br>
<p>
Messages under 3 are moderated - they go first to me for <br>
approval to send to the list. As a consequence you will<br>
not receive junk messages and in fact the number of <br>
messages should be quite small.<br>
<p>
To send a message to the list, you simply send an e-mail to:-<br>
<p>
<a href="mailto:raci-books@lacebark.ntu.edu.au">raci-books@lacebark.ntu.edu.au</a><br>
<p>
Note that the messages to the list are public in that they<br>
are automatically put on a web page which can be reached <br>
from the Book Review main page:-<br>
<p>
<a href="http://lacebark.ntu.edu.au/raci/RACIbooks.html">http://lacebark.ntu.edu.au/raci/RACIbooks.html</a><br>
<p>
This page is made using software called hypermail.<br>
<p>
The list is run by the software called listproc - the free<br>
version 6.0c, often called unix-listproc. To obtain information<br>
about listproc you send a one line e-mail message:-<br>
<p>
help<br>
<p>
to <br>
<p>
<a href="mailto:listproc@lacebark.ntu.edu.au">listproc@lacebark.ntu.edu.au</a><br>
<p>
To get information about the list, you send the one line <br>
<p>
info raci-books<br>
<p>
To get details of your settings, including a password, which<br>
you will probably not need, you send the one line<br>
<p>
set raci-books<br>
<p>
If you want to stop getting these messages you can unsubcribe by<br>
sending the one line<br>
<p>
unsubscribe raci-books<br>
<p>
Note that these messages are sent to "listproc", not "raci-books".<br>
<p>
You can also do all these things via a web page which is reached<br>
by a submit button on the web page mentioned above. If you have<br>
unsubscribed, you can resubscribe (actually this asks me to<br>
approve your subscribing). This web page can be used by your<br>
colleagues to request joining the list if I have not put them<br>
on it. The web page is seeking new reviewers. We also have<br>
quite a way to go before we have even all known reviewers on<br>
the list.<br>
<p>
All names are concealed. They are not accessible by asking<br>
<p>
recipients raci-books<br>
<p>
or "Who is on the list" from the web form.<br>
<p>
One difficulty is that if the e-mail address I entered on the<br>
subscribers list is an alias and not the actual address you<br>
use, you may not be able to post or get the information detailed<br>
above. Just let me know what your actual e-mail address is and I<br>
will fix it. Also e-mail me if you have any other problems.<br>
<p>
If you are reading this from thr hypermail-created web page and<br>
want to subscribe, please use the web interface indicated above.<br>
As I said we welcome new reviewers and we want to get all<br>
existing reviewers on the list.<br>
<p>
Regards, Brian.<br>
