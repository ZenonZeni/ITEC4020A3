<b>Promoting Literacy through Ecobehavioral Assessment and ClassWide Peer
Tutoring for Racial/Ethnic Limited English Proficient Minority Students with Disabilities
</b><br>
GRANT NUMBER: H023C40064 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  6/01/94 <br>
ENDING DATE:  7/31/97 <P>

ABSTRACT <P>

PURPOSE:  This project will investigate and validate instructional practices that will
maximize the literacy and academic achievement gains of racial and ethnic limited
English proficient (LEP) minority and majority students with disabilities in self-contained,
resource, and regular education settings.<P>

METHOD:  Staff will utilize ecobehavioral assessment and analysis procedures as a
research tool for identifying procedures associated with effectiveness criteria, and
evaluating ClassWide Peer Tutoring (CWPT) as an intervention for LEP students with or
without disabilities.  The first of five project studies will utilize ecobehavioral assessment
procedures to measure the classroom environment to determine ways to naturally
facilitate literacy and academic progress in mainstream regular and special education
classrooms.  A total sample of 180 students will be selected for classroom observations
that will be divided among self-contained, resource room, and regular education
settings.  Measures used will include demographic measures, process measures, and
product measures.  During Year 2, staff will conduct Studies 2 and 3 in order to evaluate
the effectiveness of CWPT as an instructional procedure that facilitates literacy and
academic progress.  In each treatment group, 2 students will receive tutoring in reading,
2 in spelling and 2 in math.  Data will continue to be collected on the literacy, academic
and language performance as a reflection of CWPT procedures.  Study 3 will replicate
Study 2 findings using a larger sample of students.  During Year 3, staff will conduct
Study 4, in which 24 students without disabilities will serve as partners in tutoring target
students in reading, spelling, and math.  At this time, staff will also conduct Study 5 to
verify procedures from Study 4, refine those procedures, and implement CWPT
programs with a larger sample.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:   This project will result in new knowledge concerning the
ecobehavioral features of instruction, systematic replication, adoption of an effective
instructional procedure (CWPT) to a new population, and the translation of research to
practice. <P>

<b>Puerto Rican Families Who have Children with Disabilities: A Comparison Betweeen
Families Living in Puerto Rico and Families Living in Florida</b><br>
GRANT NUMBER: H023B50023 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  9/01/95 <br>
ENDING DATE:  8/31/96 <P>

ABSTRACT <P>
PURPOSE:  The project will identify factors that contribute to the understanding of
Puerto Rican families, particularly as those factors relate to the delivery of intervention
services of young children with disabilities.<P>

METHOD:  This study will survey 40 Puerto Rican mothers of children ages birth
through five with disabilities currently living in Puerto Rico and another 40 living in the
United States. Variables of interest will include family factors (such as socioeconomic
status and parental education), child characteristics (including extent of disability), and
family resources (such as family support systems and religiousity).  All mothers will
participate in a set of structured data collection activities designed to provide a
comprehensive view of family needs and support systems.  The sample will include
married, single, and divorced mothers.  Quantitative procedures to be used will include
T-tests, ANOVA, and Multiple Stepwise Regression Analyses to determine which
variables influence families' expressions of need for help. <P>
ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  Descriptions of the project, details of project findings,
position papers, digests, summaries, fact sheets, news releases, and research reports
will be generated by project staff to disseminate findings.  Results will be disseminated
through state and national professional conferences and related professional journals,
as well as ERIC and the SpecialNet Electronic Bulletin Boards and databases.  Findings
will also be disseminated in Puerto Rico through presentation at state conferences and
publication in local educational journals. <P>

<b>Advancing and Improving the Knowledge Base on Content/Scaffolded Reading
Comprehension Strategies with Parental Involvement: An Asian LEP+LD Student
Perspective </b><br>
GRANT NUMBER: H023A50081 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  7/01/95 <br>
ENDING DATE:  6/30/96 <P>

ABSTRACT <P>

PURPOSE:  The project will advance and improve the research knowledge base on
serving Asian students who are limited English proficient (LEP) and who have learning
disabilities (LD).  The project will explore the extent to which a research-based
content/scaffolded reading comprehension intervention that has been previously found
effective with Spanish speaking students who have learning disabilities and speak
English as a second language (ESL), can be generalized to students from distinctly
Asian backgrounds. <P>
METHOD:  The research design will include parental involvement among two groups of
30 third- through fifth-grade students from Asian backgrounds who have learning
disabilities.  Phase I is designed to prepare LD resource specialists so they will develop
adequate knowledge of the content/scaffolded reading (CSR) intervention strategies
through working with non-target students.  While data on these students will not be
collected and analyzed, information and insights gained from this stage will be
incorporated into the second phase of the study.  In Phase II, the CSR intervention will
be delivered by participating LD resource specialists who facilitate the scaffolding,
eventually leading reciprocal teaching.  Phase III, Peer- and Parent-Facilitated
Intervention, is designed to facilitate target students' practicing and maintaining of CSR
comprehension strategies and content knowledge through in-class peer-mediated
cooperative learning groups and within-home parent-mediated practices through use of
students' native languages.  A combination of descriptive, quantitative, and qualitative
measures and data analysis will be utilized to address research questions on student
change over time and comparison of Asian students' change against that of
English-speaking students with learning disabilities. <P>
ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  Both the research processes and products will advance
the current knowledge base with respect to: (1) educational needs of Asian students
who are limited English proficient and have learning disabilities; (2) professional needs
of monolingual English speaking LD resource specialists; (3) needs of parents for
training and support in forging meaningful partnerships with teachers; and (4) needs of
schools to promote parental involvement in their child's school learning, particularly
inner-city Asian parents who are limited English proficient. Project findings will be 
incorporated into the Project Director's presentations at state, local, national and
international conferences, journal article publications, professional development
workshops, and teaching of method courses in both special and bilingual special
education teacher training programs.<P>

BEGINNING DATE:  9/01/95 <br>
ENDING DATE:  8/31/00 <P>

ABSTRACT <P>

PURPOSE:  The purpose of this project is to improve special educational services
provided to children and youth of native Hawaiian ancestry with special needs. 
METHOD:  This project will focus on: (1) the development of comprehensive and
culturally appropriate instructional models to effectively serve special education
students of Hawaiian ancestry in the least restrictive environment; and (2) on meeting
the needs of students at risk of being identified as needing special education in regular
classroom settings.  Project staff will implement a state-wide parent and community
involvement component to encourage and support the participation of parents in school
programs.  Parent involvement staff will be hired to coordinate efforts within each
community to increase parental participation.  Staff development activities will be
sponsored to support the use of direct instructional practices.  Through the funding of
master teachers and part-time teachers, support will be provided for development and
implementation of school-wide plans.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  Outcomes from the project will include: improved
educational performance among special needs students of Hawaiian ancestry;
increased participation of Hawaiian parents and community leaders in schools;
improved school-level and district-level capacity to serve Hawaiian students in the least
restrictive environment; and increased public awareness of the educational needs of
Hawaiian students.<P>

<b>Parameters of Effective Instruction for Language-Minority Students with Disabilities 
and Those at Risk for School Failure: Research Synthesis and Dissemination </b><br>
GRANT NUMBER: H023E50013 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  7/01/95 <br>
ENDING DATE:  6/30/97 <P>

ABSTRACT <P>

PURPOSE:  The project will begin to develop a professional knowledge base on
effective teaching practices for language minority students with mild disabilities or who
are at risk for school failure.<P>

METHOD:  This study will focus on instructional issues, specifically classroom practices
which demonstrate the greatest promise for improving the academic achievement of
language minority students with disabilities.  Practices which break down barriers
between school and home and those which assist in establishing proactive collaboration
between educators and families will be targeted.  Staff will combine Slavin's (1986)
best-evidence synthesis and Ogawa and Malen's (1991) multi-vocal approach in order
to better grasp the wide range of studies within the literature bases that will have
relevance for addressing the working hypotheses.  The technical quality of each piece
of literature will be assessed.  The overall synthesis will be based on a set of working
hypotheses generated from earlier research and modified and refined with input from a
wide range of stakeholder constituencies.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  A series of audience-specific products will be developed
collaboratively with OSEP.  The project will utilize input from the constituency groups
and from a national forum.<P>

<b>Transition from School to Work and Community Living: Asian-American Students
with Disabilities and Their Needs in Transition</b> <br>
GRANT NUMBER: H023N40016 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  9/01/94 <br>
ENDING DATE:  8/31/97 <P>

ABSTRACT <P>

PURPOSE:  The project will investigate parents' expectations and students' needs for
transition among students with developmental disabilities across six ethnocultural
subgroups. <P>
METHOD:  Ethnocultural subgroups of Asian-American students will include Chinese,
Filipino, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese, and  other Asians.  The project, will study the
level of their awareness of available transition services.  The project will also provide
information about parent and student rights and available transition services in their own
language.  It will equip education professionals with important information for
appropriate and effective transition planning, reflecting a child's cultural values, future
employment preferences, and living arrangements.  Ten families of Asian-American
students between 16 and 22 years of age from each subgroup will be recruited from six
school districts and through public announcements on ethnocultural radio and television
broadcasting systems in the greater Los Angeles area.  Community leaders from the six
highlighted ethnocultural subgroups will be invited to take part in dissemination
activities.  A secondary demographic data analysis will be conducted, followed by a
study of parents' expectations and needs in transition using interview and survey
methods. <P>
ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  A brochure in six different Asian languages, technical
reports, and peer-reviewed journal articles will be prepared as final products of this
project. <P>

<b>Predicting Minority Parent Participation</b><br>
GRANT NUMBER: H023C50038 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  4/01/95 <br>
ENDING DATE:  3/31/96 <P>

ABSTRACT <P>

PURPOSE:  The project will enhance the level of service to traditionally underserved
minority group deaf or hard-of-hearing children by identifying parent characteristics that
do not meet the expectations of current service delivery systems. <P>

METHOD:  Hispanic, African-American, and Caucasian families (N=220 total) in five
cities, who have young children who are hard-of-hearing or deaf, will participate in this
study.  A two-tiered attempt will be made to collect information from this population
through phone interviews, followed by home visits where necessary.  The theoretical
framework for the study will address three general areas of mismatch between the value
systems of those who design family services and traditionally underserved families:
social support systems, family cohesion, and family decision making.  Analysis of data
will address two questions: first, the degree and nature of minority parent involvement in
the education of their deaf and hard or hearing children; second, the degree to which
involvement is reduced as a function of membership in a minority group versus specific
family traits and dyanmics.  Once characteristics of parents with higher or lower levels
of involvement in their children's services and education are identified, this information
could be used to identify children who might be better served through alternative
methods.  For example, some children might be better served if information and training
normally earmarked for parents was rerouted to some other individual more likely to
assist the child.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS: The primary outcome of this work will be to expand
contact with underserved populations by giving practitioners a way to respond to
families who don't fit current models of service delivery.  Initial dissemination will take
the form of presentations at annual meetings of major research, education, and special
education, organizations and those representing individuals who are deaf or hard of
hearing, followed by subsequent dissemination through the submission of articles to
relevant journals.  Additional dissemination will take place through Gallaudet
University's Pre-College Outreach unit, which provides information and services
nationwide through workshops for service providers.<P>

<b>Effects of Use of Authentic Assessment Procedures on Literacy Development of
Bilingual and Monolingual Students with Learning Disabilities</b><br>

GRANT NUMBER: H023C50097 <br>
BEGINNING DATE: 10/01/95 <br>
ENDING DATE:  9/31/98 <P>

ABSTRACT <P>

PURPOSE:  The project will explore the assessment procedures that teachers use in
order to make decisions about the literacy instructional services of students, and to
better understand learner characteristics which may often mask second language
acquisition problems when compounded with learning disabilities.<P>

METHOD:  This will be an exploratory and descriptive investigation using the case study
approach as the main research strategy from an ethnographic perspective.  Three
school sites within the Chicago Public Schools will represent one case study each.  By
studying the three educational settings as well as key figures within each (including
teachers, students, parents, and other school staff), it is expected that the particular
culture of each school will illuminate larger issues about special education teachers'
assessment practices.  Teachers will be interviewed regarding their theories of learning
disabilities, their beliefs about literacy instruction and learning, and their knowledge of
writing process and reading development.  Meanwhile, research staff will engage in
classroom observations and videotaping to establish an ethnographic baseline
understanding of teachers' practices prior to intervention.  Teachers will then receive
training and technical assistance in such assessment techniques as portfolio
assessment, student self-evaluation, and reflecting on both process and product
aspects on student work.  In addition to describing in detail all participating school and
classroom cultures, comparative analyses will be conducted to examine shared
characteristics of teachers' assessment procedures. <P>
ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS: Findings will be incorporated into development of a series
of videotape and other training materials on authentic assessment as it informs literacy
instruction.  Ethnographic findings on interrelationships between second language
acquisition and learning disabilities will be disseminated through these training materials
as well as journal publications.<P>

<b>Accessibility to and Utilization of Intervention Services in the First 6 Years: A
Longitudinal Study of African-American Families and Services and Service
Agencies</b><br>
GRANT NUMBER: H023C40083 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  9/01/94 <br>
ENDING DATE:  8/31/97 <P>

ABSTRACT <P>

PURPOSE:  The project will examine the factors that influence early intervention service
accessibility and utilization within African-American families with children who are
developmentally disabled.<P>

METHOD:  This research is based upon a conceptual framework that links service
utilization to three major components: the personal, familial, and cultural characteristics
of potential users, dimensions of the service delivery system, and the socio-political
context within which service delivery and utilization take place.  The first of two
longitudinal components entails a survey of early intervention and related service
agencies, designed to obtain data on: (1) the representation of African-American
families in intervention programs; (2) agency policies and actions regarding the
recruitment of families from underserved populations; and (3) policies and practices
regarding the delivery of culturally sensitive and appropriate services. The longitudinal
design will enable the research team to ascertain changes occurring in all three areas
over the 3-year period of the study. The second component entails a study of the
intervention experiences of African-American families of children with disabilities during
the first 6 years of the child's life.  The design for this component encompasses two
cohorts of families (45 in each), one with children in the birth to 3-year range and the
other in the 3- to 6-year range.  Qualitative analyses will provide a holistic context for
understanding responses to the various scales and questionnaires, while quantitative
analyses will be used to explore the extent to which relationships implied in the
conceptual model can be validated statistically.  Analysis will also include determination
of the appropriateness, reliability, and validity of the various measures employed in the
study so that the study's underlying conceptual model can be subjected to rigorous
empirical testing in subsequent work. <P>
ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  Through this project, researchers will learn the extent to
which existing early intervention and other related services are accessible to
African-American families of children with developmental disabilities, identify barriers to
service accessibility and utilization, and draw implications for policy, practice, and future
research.  <P>

<b>Discourse Analysis of Culturally and Linguistically Diverse Students with
Exceptionalities </b><br>
GRANT NUMBER: H023B50020 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  8/01/95 <br>
ENDING DATE:  7/31/96 <P>

ABSTRACT <P>

PURPOSE:  The project will conduct an in-depth analysis of bilingualism and
sociolinguistic influences in various contexts.  This analysis will provide insight into the
experiences of culturally and linguistically diverse students with exceptionalities. 
METHOD:  The research site, La Mesa Elementary School, serves 408 students from
rural communities in southern New Mexico.  Approximately fifty percent of the school's
students speak Spanish as their primary language.  Classroom activities will be
observed three times per week for seven months, and interviews will be conducted with
students, teachers, and family members.  Student records will also be analyzed. 
Through classroom observations, videotaping, and interviews, project staff will identify
classroom discourse and language use.  The resultant data and documentation will also
be analyzed to identify effective teaching strategies and unique educational and
sociocultural needs of students.  Emergent themes and grounded local theories will be
identified, and findings will then be disseminated. <P>
ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  Research findings will be disseminated through various
channels, including: presentations at appropriate conferences; publication in refereed
journals; information sharing with colleagues through computer networks; and inclusion
of findings in coursework at New Mexico State University.  A 20-minute videotape will
also be made of various classroom discourse contexts; this videotape will be used for
presentations, teacher training, and instruction. <P>

<b>An Examination of the Effect of Three Spanish Reading Approaches on the Reading
Achievement of Limited English Proficient (LEP) Students with Learning Disabilities and
LEP Students At-Risk for Learning Disabilities</b><br>

GRANT NUMBER: H023B50036 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  9/01/95 <br>
ENDING DATE:  8/31/96 <P>

ABSTRACT <P>

PURPOSE:  This project will examine the effectiveness of three instructional methods
delivered in Spanish for teaching 1st grade students who are limited English proficient
(LEP) and who have learning disabilities (LD), and for teaching 1st grade students who
are LEP and at risk for LD. <P>
METHOD: The first method, Literature-Based Spanish Reading Approach (LB-SRA), is
based on characteristics of effective reading instruction for students who are limited
English proficient and have LD.  The LB-SRA approach attempts to teach meaning by
using a strong literature component and combining reading, writing, and oral language. 
The LB-SRA does not teach phonics or phonological awareness.  The second method,
Systematic-Integrated - Spanish Reading Approach (SI-SRA), which teaches explicit
phonic and phonological awareness as well as meaning, will integrate the
characteristics of effective early reading instruction for students who are LEP and who
have learning disabilities with characteristics of effective early literacy instruction that
have already been validated through previous research with English-speaking students.
The third method, General-Education-Spanish Reading Approach (GE-SRA) will be the
standard reading instruction already provided in the general education classroom, and
can be described as a program teaching meaning and implicit phonological awareness
and phonics.  120 1st grade students who have limited proficiency in English, from four
schools in Los Angeles, California, will be selected to participate in this study. Children
will be randomly assigned to one of the three methods of instruction.  Treatment will
include two weeks of baseline, followed by 20 weeks of daily, 60 minutes per day
intervention, ending with one week of followup intervention.  A between-groups design
will be used to examine effectiveness of different approaches.  Method of instruction will
be the independent variable and the dependent variable will be student performance. 
Student progress also be monitored twice weekly using curriculum-based
measurement, as well as letter naming and letter sound fluency tasks.  Student
progress will be examined using a Hierarchical Linear Modeling analysis.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  Planned project products include an annual project report
and a number of research papers, a handbook reporting on project procedures, a
teacher handbook, and other publications of project outcomes.  Dissemination activities
will include inservice consultations, guest lectures, site visits, and presentations at
professional conferences. <P>

<b>Project SERVE LD: Successful Early Recognition of Variables in the Evaluation of
Learning Disabilities</b><br>
GRANT NUMBER: H023C30010 <br>
BEGINNING DATE: 10/01/93 <br>
ENDING DATE:  9/30/96 <P>

ABSTRACT <P>

PURPOSE:  This project will attempt to reduce the theory-practice gap in identification
of and preparation of remediation plans for students with learning disabilities by
analyzing the decision process and identifying the salient variables that ultimately result
in final diagnosis and interventions for teachers, resource specialists, and psychologists
working with children with learning disabilities. <P>
METHOD:  Beginning with stated definitions and policies for disability determination and
the development of treatment plans, the project will study what actually happens in
practice for approximately 10,000 African-American, Asian, Caucasian, Filipino, Latino,
Indochinese, and Native American children who will be referred and evaluated for all
types of learning disabilities in the diverse San Diego City System.  Through regression
analysis, factor analysis, and discriminant analysis applied to approximately 100
variables per child, the program will analyze the decision process, determine the
variables that are actually employed to qualify a child as learning disabled, describe the
characteristics of children referred for, but not qualified as learning disabled, summarize
the process of developing treatment recommendations, and examine how treatment
plans are implemented.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  Information gained through this study will be
systematically communicated to teachers, resource specialists, psychologists,
administrators, and parents in order to have an immediate positive impact in terms of
streamlining the process of learning disability determination and the development of
treatment plans.  Findings will be further disseminated via reports to school
administrators and parents in communities involved, through a monograph to be
developed and sent to local, state, and national agencies and to researchers in the field,
through symposia presentations at professional conventions, and through publications
in major journals.<P>

<b>A National Study of State Education Policies for Language Minority Students with
Disabilities</b><br>
GRANT NUMBER: H023B50037 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  9/01/95 <br>
ENDING DATE:  8/31/96 <P>

ABSTRACT <P>

PURPOSE:  The project will: (1) identify State policies regarding educational services
for students with disabilities who are also identified as language minority students; and
(2) synthesize experts' recommendations for improvements of these policies through a
Delphi procedure. <P>
METHOD:  Current state policies for serving language minority students with disabilities
will be identified through document review and content analysis.  Existing special
education policies, including statutes, rules, and regulations and state plans will be
reviewed for the 50 states and the District of Columbia.  State Education Agencies
(SEAs) will also be contacted to obtain copies of relevant policy documents.  Next, an
expert panel will review the policies found and make recommendations for
improvements, using a Delphi procedure.  This technological forecasting technique
collects the opinions of experts for analysis, and brings their opinions to consensus. 
The panel will include 15 representatives from the areas of bilingual education, special
education, bilingual special education, and educational policy.  Electronic
communication media will be used to facilitate this process.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  This research will provide recommendations to states that
have not developed specific policies and to those revising policies for educational
programs for language minority students with disabilities. Copies of the project report
will be made available to professional organizations and databases, as well as special
education representatives at each SEA and members of the Delphi expert panel (who
represent colleges and universities nationwide.) <p>
