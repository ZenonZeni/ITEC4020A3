<B>The Dollar Remains Firm</B>
<BR>

<P>
The prospect of the U.S. being the first G-7 country to raise
interest rates this year suggests that the dollar will retain
the bias towards firmness which has been apparent during recent
weeks.
<P>
The German economy should improve during the summer but the Bundesbank
is unlikely to tighten until mid-1997 at the earliest.  Germany
has a large output gap and Bundesbank officials favor a weak D-mark
in order to discourage support from German industry for the introduction
of a new European currency.  The major constraint on further easing
this spring is the industrial unrest now occurring in Germany's
public sector as well as Bundesratt opposition to Chancellor Kohl's
proposed cuts in government expenditure.
<P>
<B>In Japan, there are increasing signs of economic recovery but
officials are downplaying the possibility of monetary tightening
because of the lingering credit quality problems of the financial
system.</B>  Tokyo journalists also report that recent bureaucratic
shuffles at the Ministry of Finance have increased the odds of
Dr. Eisuke Sakakibara being reappointed for another year as the
Director General of the international finance bureau.  As Dr.
Sakakibara has been a strong promoter of a firm dollar with both
Japanese investment firms and the New York hedge funds, his reappointment
should be a psychological plus for the U.S. dollar.  He does not
favor pushing the dollar all the way to 130 yen, as some press
reports have suggested, but he will certainly try to hold the
yen dollar rate in a trading range of 105-110 in order to promote
further improvement in Japanese corporate profitability.
<P>
The only potential negative factor for the dollar during the next
few quarters is increasing political risk in the U.S. and reduced
political risk in other countries.  It now appears that Mr. Yeltsin
will win the Russian presidential election and lessen the danger
of investors selling the currencies of Germany and other central
European countries because of a communist victory.  In the U.S.,
by contrast, <B>the opinion polls suggest that President Clinton
could win such a large victory in this November's presidential
election that he might be able to pull many new Democrats into
Congress with him</B>.  According to some pollsters, the Republicans
have potentially thirty vulnerable House freshmen while the Democrats
are likely to lose about four to six open seats in the south.
 If there is a net swing of 24 seats, the Democrats would be able
to retake control of the House and elect their majority leader,
Rep. Richard Gephardt, as Speaker.  The market would be concerned
about a Democratic recapture of the House for three reasons. 

<P>
First, Rep. Gephardt has often been an advocate of protectionist
trade policies in the past and was hostile to the administration's
financial rescue program for Mexico.  
<P>
Secondly, the Democratic Party has lost so many of its traditional
southern seats that it is a party increasingly dominated by the
big cities of the northeast, the middle west, and California as
well as their lower middle class suburbs.  Whereas the Democratic
Party had over 95% of the southern Congressional delegation as
recently as the early 1960's, it now has only one quarter of the
seats in the old Confederacy and could emerge from the next election
with only 10-15%.  <B>As a result, many of the new committee chairman
in a Democratic controlled Congress would be from poor urban districts
in cities such as Detroit, New York and Los Angeles.</B>  They
would be far more left of center on many economic policy issues,
such as public spending and labor market regulation, than both
the current Republican chairmen and the past Democratic committee
chairmen.
<P>
Finally, many investors would view a Democratic victory as a major
lost opportunity for structural reform of social security, Medicare
and other federal programs.  As the Republicans have not controlled
Congress for two consecutive terms since the 1920's and might
well engage in a demoralizing fratricidal conflict if they lose
control again after only one term, it is unclear when an opportunity
for structural reform would re-emerge.  In fact, the markets are
confronted with a unique set of historical circumstances this
year.  No Democratic President has won re-election for two consecutive
terms since the days of Franklin Roosevelt while the Republicans
have not controlled Congress for two consecutive terms since the
1920's.  Hence, if one were to extrapolate on the basis of history,
they would project that Senator Robert Dole would emerge as the
next president and that Richard Gephardt would be the new House
Speaker.  The odds of such an outcome appear modest today because
a Dole victory would probably guarantee Republican retention of
the Congress while a Clinton victory would not insure a Democratic
takeover of the House unless he won by a landslide.  But unless
Senator Dole rallies in the polls, the markets could become alarmed
about the prospect of the Republicans suffering an electoral debacle
this November.
<P>
Despite the current wide gap in the opinion polls, <B>it would
be premature for investors to conclude that the President is assured
of re-election</B>.  The Dole campaign is currently suffering
from money problems and his responsibilities in the Senate, but
four factors suggest that Senator Dole should enjoy a significant
improvement during the autumn.  First, the Republicans have a
strong hold on several southern and western states with about
160-170 electoral votes.  Secondly, the President has been pursuing
re-election by emphasizing Republican themes, such as a balanced
budget and family values.  While the strategy has worked so far,
the media could ultimately portray him as such a cynical manipulator
of public opinion that it will backfire.  Thirdly, the recent
conviction of the Governor of Arkansas and Mr. Clinton's former
real estate partners on various allegations of fraud will force
the media to probe further into allegations of corruption during
his tenure as Governor of Arkansas.  As Arkansas has many of the
characteristics of an emerging market, press scrutiny of the state
coupled with the Starr investigations of the first family's financial
affairs could easily revive doubts about the president's character.
 Finally, despite Mr. Dole's long history in U.S. public life,
pollsters working with voter focus groups have discovered that
most Americans know very little about him.  At one Republican
focus group, for example, only 25% of the voters were aware of
Mr. Dole's record during World War Two.  As the presidential campaign
intensifies and the media focuses more closely on the character
of the candidates, Senator Dole is likely to benefit at the expense
of the president.
<P>
<I><B>To summarize,</B></I> the U.S. economy is likely to expand
at a 3.0-4.0% annual rate during the second quarter because of
steady growth of consumption and investment as well as corporate
restocking of inventories.  There is still widespread disagreement
about the outlook for third quarter growth but recent reports
on employment intentions and capital goods demand suggest that
output growth should remain close to 3.0%.  As a result, there
will be further increases in the economy's level of resource utilization
which could encourage the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary
policy at the FOMC meeting in early July or late August.  The
recovery now underway in the economies of Latin America, China
and other developing countries, coupled with the cyclical upturn
projected for Europe and Japan also suggest that world output
growth could exceed 4.0% this year and next year for the first
time since 1988.  The dollar should remain firm because of the
strength of the U.S. economy and the desire of government officials
in both Germany and Japan to encourage depreciation of the D-mark
and the yen.
