&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For those of you who love the sea, we invite you to join us as we rediscover the romance and magic of Robert Louis Stevenson's South Pacific aboard the world's most elegant sailing vessel, the Wind Song.  Steep yourself in crystalline blue lagoons, snow-white beaches, sheer volcanic ridges, deep gorges and waterfalls, luxuriantly warm tropical waters, wildlife pursuits and archaeological treasures.  The overwhelming beauty of the exotic Marquesas, Tuamotus, Tongan and Fiji Islands, among the many others we will visit, is perfectly complemented by the luxurious accommodations of the 140-passenger Wind Song, the sleek 440-foot motor-sailing schooner.  Additional Zodiacs, the key to successful expedition cruising, will be brought on board for all three voyages, and of course our team of naturalists and historians will be on hand to offer daily recaps and briefings, as well as lectures and informal discussions both aboard and ashore.  Three itineraries have been planned:<P>
<IMG SRC="tiki.gif" ALT="tiki.gif" ALIGN="RIGHT" WIDTH=180 HEIGHT=360>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<B>Polynesia Under Sail I</B>--This first expedition sails through the Tuamotus, 76 atoll islands which are coral edifices, rising from the sea just high enough above the waves to be called islands.  Snorkeling and diving opportunities here are superb.  Afterwards, we sail for the Marquesas, considered to be one of the most stunning and least accessible island groups in the Pacific.<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<B>Polynesia Under Sail II</B>--This second voyage sails west from Papeete for the Cook Archipelago, where native birds still abound.  The Wind Song's billowy sails then carry us across the sea to Niue and the Kingdom of Tonga, stopping at islands in the remote, northwest corner of Polynesia, including Walls and Futuna, and concluding our exploration in Fiji to a chorus of "Bula," the traditional Fijian greeting.<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<B>Polynesia Under Sail III</B>--This itinerary retraces the route of Polynesia Under Sail II, beginning its journey in the lush paradise of Fiji and disembarking in Tahiti at the end of May.<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<B>Polynesia Under Sail Update</B>--After learning that the Wind Song would not be returning to the South Pacific in 1998, we are taking another two charters through the Tuamotus and Marquesas, October 10-22, 1997 and October 19-November 2, 1997. Both itineraries will be similar to Polynesia Under Sail I, but we will disembark and embark passengers in the Marquesas (Nuka Hiva).  An Easter Island extension will be offered to both voyages.
