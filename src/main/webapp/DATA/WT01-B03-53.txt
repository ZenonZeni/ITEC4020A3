<p><h3>Background</h3>
The U.S. Air Force's over-the-horizon-backscatter (OTH-B) air defense radar 
system is by several criteria the largest radar system in the world.  It was 
developed over the last 25 years at a cost of $1.5 billion to warn against 
Soviet bomber attacks when the planes were still thousands of miles from 
U.S. air space. Six one-million-watt OTH radars see far beyond the range of 
conventional microwave radars by bouncing their 5-28-MHz waves off 
the ionosphere, an ionized layer about 200 km above the earth.  With the end 
of the Cold War, just months after their deployment, the three OTH radars on 
the West Coast were mothballed, but the three radars in Maine were 
redirected to counter-narcotics surveillance.
<p> 
In 1991, NOAA recognized the vast potential of these military relics of the
cold war for environmental monitoring and asked the Air Force's permission to look
at the part of the radar echo that the Air Force throws away -- the ocean clutter. 
NOAA's tests showed that this clutter can be processed to extract ocean 
surface wind direction over huge, data-sparse ocean areas -- vital 
information that affects climate and the ocean's circulation. Tropical 
storms and hurricanes were tracked, and a system for delivering 
radar-derived winds to the National Hurricane Center was developed. The 
combined coverage of the six OTH-B radars is about 90 million square 
kilometers of open ocean where few weather instruments exist. Recent tests 
have also demonstrated OTH radars ability to map ocean currents.
<p>
Whereas OTH radars map surface wind directions on demand over large, fixed 
ocean areas, active and passive microwave instruments on board several 
polar-orbiting satellites measure wind speeds along narrow swaths determined
by their orbital geometries.  Satellites, however, do not measure wind
directions very well.  The capabilities of ground-based and satellite-based 
ocean-wind sensors thus obviously complement each other.  The two products 
have been merged for the first time <a href="http://www1.etl.noaa.gov/othr/othmain.htm#data">here</a>.
<p> 
Our experimental online <a href="othdata.htm">data sets</a> are the products of ongoing tests of OTH 
radar's enviromental monitoring capabilities.  They are provided, with the 
usual caveats, for use by the research community and for evaluation by 
operational weather forecasters.  The cost of converting the OTH-B radars to 
this kind of ocean-monitoring service is less than 1% of their cost.
