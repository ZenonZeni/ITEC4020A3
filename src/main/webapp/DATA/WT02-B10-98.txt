Displaytech is a privately held company in Boulder, Colorado developing miniature liquid crystal displays. The company also develops and manufactures electro-optic component products used in industrial inspection and measurement, medical imaging, and research. All of the company's products are based on its proprietary surface-stabilized ferroelectric liquid crystal technology. (1)<P>

In May Displaytech announced initiation of the  ChronoColor Miniature Display Developers Program. Through this program selected manufacturers of end user display products will be able to receive the company's electronic miniature displays for new product development.<P>

Small, light weight high resolution miniature displays that have low power requirements and can be magnified into high screen quality images bring together the thus far opposing trends of large viewing screens and portability.<P>

"Miniature displays have the capability to change the way people view and retrieve information," said president Mark Handschy. "An entire range of new products are possible with this technology: products such as telefax pagers, videoconferencing cellular phones, information appliances, workstation quality computer displays mounted in eyeglass frames... the list is limited only by one's imagination."<P>

Miniature displays, which generally measure less than an inch diagonally, produce images on a very small surface that can be magnified or projected for viewing. Displaytech's  ChronoColor Miniature Display is built on a silicon chip that measures about 1/2 inch diagonally. The 1280 x 1024  ChronoColor Miniature Display is expected to measure 8 millimeters by 6 millimeters.<P>

The  ChronoColor Display is based on the company's proprietary liquid crystal technology (fast switching ferroelectric liquid crystals) and the standard technologies of CMOS (complementary metal oxide semiconductor) memory and LED's (light emitting diodes). The  ChronoColor Miniature Display will be equipped with interfaces that make it compatible with VGA systems.<P>

The Developers' Program is targeted to experienced manufacturers of display products who are committed to developing miniature display technology. Under the Developers' Program, manufacturers will be able to evaluate the  ChronoColor Display for their particular products. As end user display product manufacturers develop products, Displaytech will ramp up its scalable manufacturing process.<P>

"We have been investing in product manufacturing for the last years and a half. At the end of 1996, we will have facilities in place to produce commercial quantities of the  ChronoColor Miniature Display," said Haviland Wright, CEO.<P>

Dislaytech is currently developing miniature displays with 256 x 256 resolution, and 640 x 480 through 1280 x 1024 resolutions. The company will distribute 640 x 480 displays through the Developers' Program. Developers will receive their first displays in early 1997. (2)<P>
