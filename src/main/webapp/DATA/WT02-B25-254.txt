<P>

Please understand that I am not opposed to involuntary treatment and do not want to convey that impression.  However, here are the thoughts I want to share on the subject.  D.J. Jaffe has presented a cogent argument for changing the statutes for involuntary commitment; but as a sage has said, "For every complex problem there is a simple solution, and it is usually wrong."  

<P>

Every state has some kind of involuntary commitment statute on its books.  The problem is that the interpretation and application of the laws are idiosyncratic.  Tinkering with these laws may tune them up, but it will not address the major issues. 

<P>

Jaffe offers some specific and detailed suggestions that civil rights lawyers and some consumer groups will vigorously oppose.  At best, Jaffe's recommendation is a short-term fix for a longstanding irritant.  It delays grappling with the major public health problems that communities must face now.

<P>

Historically, involuntary commitment to psychiatric hospitals for persons with severe and persistent mental illnesses has been the last resort to safeguard society from aberrant, frightening behaviors and to protect very ill persons from their own poor judgement.  It has failed to do both in many cases. 

<P>

In addition, hospitals and jails are expensive sites to treat persons with severe mental illnesses.  Many psychiatric hospitals are understaffed and unsafe.  Who will clean them up?  Little wonder many consumers are afraid of them.  Prisons, jails, and detention centers that house many court-committed mentally ill persons are dangerous for even healthy people. 

<P>

The political mood is to build more jails for more people.  It is estimated that 10 percent of occupants are seriously mentally ill.  Health care is sparse and non existent in many criminal justice sites.  Jailers are begging for help with this population.  If involuntary commitment to these expensive places doesn't accomplish the objectives of keeping society safe and the person well, we must look for other alternatives.

<P>

A catalog of research studies has shown that involuntary hospitalization is no guarantee that those hospitalized will return for continued treatment, take prescribed medicine, or change violent behaviors.  Ask any psychiatric practitioner about the most common problem in treating persons with schizophrenia and bi-polar disorder and the overwhelming majority will say it is noncompliance with medication. 

<P>

When persons are asked why they stop taking the maintenance medications that control their symptoms, they will answer that the side effects of drugs made compliance intolerable, or that cost of the drugs were prohibitive, or that they had no transportation to procure the medication.  Others will deny their illness and therefore see no need for medication.

<P>

Upon discharge from an involuntary commitment site, a large number of persons will revert to previous lifestyles and high-risk behaviors.  Granted that--for the duration of confinement to acute care settings--society is protected and the ill person may receive state-of-the-art treatment.  But what happens after discharge? 

<P>

With injectable medication regimes the person soon improves and returns to his community where often a fearful, exhausted family waits to deal with his anger.  For those without willing families, it is often the "same old, same old" routines until the next relapse repeats the cycle.

<P>

In Dr. E. Fuller Torrey's excellent article in Hospital & Community Psychiatry (July 1994), he cites the high incidence of violent acts in a subsection of the population who have been diagnosed with schizophrenia.  This reality has frustrated families and communities who have a legitimate concern for their own safety and freedom from harm. 

<P>

Are persons with schizophrenia and manic depression to be considered mad or bad when they commit violent acts?  Science and mental health advocates answer that madness from a state of physical illness of the brain drives the erratic and irrational behaviors of some persons.  The question is what to do about this illness-related outcome of violence in the small number of untreated persons? 

<P>

Equally important is the basic question of how to protect a person from the results of illness-related lack of insight into a life-threatening, deteriorating illness?  The cruelest blow to parents who have raised a child through childhood and adolescence is to witness the slide into self-neglect and confusion.

<P>

As healthcare costs escalate, hospital stays for mental illnesses are often reduced to four or six days.  Responsible public-sector managed care planners look to community care to provide less costly alternatives.  Research on effectiveness of forms of treatment will be used more often in the future to guide decisions about how and where to treat sick people.

<P>

I propose that we use our energy and resources to push for the following long-term approaches.  All follow public health prevention concepts.

<P>

1. Guaranteed health care for all citizens within each state that is individualized, affordable, and of high quality.

<P>

2. Mandatory, state-of-the-art continuing education for all healthcare providers.  Science-based, it must include consumers and families as well as practitioners on faculty teams.

<P>

3. Certification in mental disorders education as a requirement for all judges, lawyers, and justice personnel who work with mentally ill persons.

<P>

4. Education of all citizens early in their lives about warning signs and symptoms of major mental illnesses.  Public school curriculums of elementary and high school health classes should be required to routinely present this information in discussions and materials.  Early self-identification of people at risk could be presented as intelligent healthcare promotion.

<P>

5. Delivery of ongoing continuing public education to local communities about mental illnesses being treatable, common disorders that affect all kinds of people.  Information about where affordable treatment sites are located and how to access them should be routinely given.  Public libraries could be used in this effort.

<P>

6. Increased private and government funding for research into services to persons with severe mental illness.  Knowledge from such research should be given widespread public and professional dissemination without delay.

<P>

7. Pressure to redesign in each state, by law, the present fragmented mental health delivery systems so that emphasis is on early case finding through outreach to community.  Persuasive case management teams can be the ongoing contacts with persons identified as in need of treatment.

<P>

8. The standard expectation of best practice guidelines for all diagnostic and treatment centers.  Monitoring and incentives for compliance should be instituted by all funding agents.

<P>

9. Insistence that all persons with these mental illnesses be tracked by responsible providers to monitor their healthcare status at systematic intervals for the duration of their lives.  Funding could come through capitation grants or similar prepaid plans to replace fee-for-service mechanisms.

<P>

10. Institution of public health mandates, similar to tuberculosis control measures, to provide continuous treatment in the community for persons with a history of violence related to mental illness.

<P>

11.  Requirement that public healthcare authorities provide state-of-the-art dual-diagnosis treatment to all persons identified as having a severe mental illnesses and a substance abuse disorder.

<P>

12.  Advisement to caregivers of persons with severe and persistent mental illness of their rights for support and education with information about access in their geographical area.

<P>

13. Encouragement of the development of new, "clean" pharmacological agents with fewer side effects to treat schizophrenia and other severe disorders by private and public entities.

<P>

14. Proposal and passage of federal legislation that gives all disabled persons the right to an individual treatment plan of care in their community.  It would be comparable to the legislation that mandates a individual education plan for all children with disabilities.  This would supplement the State Planning Act for Comprehensive Services for Mentally Ill Persons.

<P>

If mental healthcare consumers had voluntary access to a continuous and comprehensive range of services and treatments, that access could dramatically reduce the need for involuntary treatment and commitment.  And if involuntary treatment laws were invoked only when they are in the consumer's best interest, that would also cut down on usage.  Laws should not be used to increase hospital profits, provide respite for parents, introduce a form of social control, get votes, or "clean up" streets for visiting conventioneers.

<P>

While it is vital to respect the right of consumers to make their own decisions, we must also recognize that in neurobiological disorders (NBD) the diseased organ is the brain, and the judgement of consumers is sometimes so affected by the disease that they are unable to make the decisions they would make if their judgement was unimpaired. 

<P>

 Severe impairment of judgement happens only to a minority of individuals with NBD, but this minority is often the group most in need of treatment--and the actions of this minority often tar the majority of consumers who never become a danger to themselves or others.  In fact, dangerous actions can make communities less likely to welcome community-based facilities that would help everyone.  In light of this, the following are principles I believe must be incorporated into any involuntary treatment law.

<P>

1. An independent review must be guaranteed in all involuntary treatment determinations.

<P>

To protect the rights of consumers, some form of independent administrative review or judicial review by individuals knowledgeable in the medical issues surrounding NBD must take place.  If a decision is made to involuntarily commit or treat, it should be periodically reviewed.

<P>

2. The definition of dangerous must be broadened.

<P>

Dangerous must be interpreted more broadly than "imminently" and/or "provably."  We must be able to help individuals before they are holding a knife to their own or someone else's throat.

Add a "grave disability" standard.  The concept of dangerousness should be interpreted to include the "grave disability" standard. 

<P>

This would allow the treatment, voluntarily or involuntarily, of a person with NBD who is "substantially unable, except for reasons of indigence, to provide for any of the person's basic needs, such as food, clothing, shelter, health or safety causing substantial deterioration of the person's ability to function on the person's own."

<P>

Add a "substantial deterioration" standard.  The "substantial deterioration" standard would potentially include for commitment someone who "as a result of NBD, is likely to cause harm to himself or others or to suffer substantial mental or physical deterioration if he is not given inpatient or outpatient treatment."  Kansas provides a good model for this.

<P>

Creating a better definition of dangerous will not mean there automatically will be facilities to care for all those needing treatment.  But the constricted standard means that even when treatment facilities are available, care cannot be provided.

<P>

3. Government has a parens patriae obligation, in addition to police-power obligation, to provide care.

<P>

When acutely ill, individuals with NBD can be among the most vulnerable members of society.  They may be imprisoned by their psychosis and unable to make the decisions they would otherwise want to make.  As with children and the developmentally disabled, the state has an obligation to exercise its parens patriae powers and step in to assist those "who as a result of their NBD are unable to fully understand the treatment being proposed and its likely courses and outcomes and/or to provide for their own welfare."

<P>

Add a "need for treatment" standard.  The "need for treatment" standard would allow the treatment of someone "who is suffering from a mental disorder as a result of which he is in need of treatment or care and supervision that can be provided only in an inpatient or outpatient facility."

<P>

Add a "lack of capacity" standard.  The "lack of capacity" standard would allow the treatment of someone "who as a result of the mental disorder is unable to fully understand and to make an informed decision regarding his need for treatment or care and supervision."

<P>

4. The questions of commitment and treatment should be decided expeditiously in a single hearing.

<P>

In many states individuals receive one court hearing to decide whether or not they are dangerous and should be involuntarily hospitalized.  In cases where they resist treatment, they undergo a second hearing to decide whether or not they should be involuntarily treated.  Because these hearings often occur weeks apart, individuals may be hospitalized but not allowed treatment.

<P>

Collapsing the determinations of commitment and treatment into a single hearing would prevent consumers from being warehoused unnecessarily and would also allow advanced directives to become operational earlier.  The treatment determination should be flexible enough to allow adjustable client-centered treatment.

<P>

5. Past activity should be considered in determining the future course of illness.

<P>

Medical science has shown that past activity and historical progression of the illness are the best predictors of future activity and progression of the illness.  Many consumers exhibit predictable stages of deterioration. 

<P>

Yet courts often rule this evidence of past progression of the illness as inadmissable.  Consumers, families, providers, doctors, and other interested individuals must be allowed to submit historical information to the current doctors and courts for their consideration.

<P>

6. Allow involuntary outpatient treatment.

<P>

Right now in many states, when the court finds that an individual is "dangerous to self or others" and needs involuntary treatment, it can only order the most expensive and most restrictive form of treatment, inpatient hospitalization.  The hospital administers medicines and releases the individual.  The individual soon becomes "dangerous" again and needs re-hospitalization.

<P>

Involuntary outpatient treatment would make it possible to offer a less restrictive, less expensive, and often more beneficial alternative for individuals with NBD.  It would cut down on the need for inpatient hospitalization.  Individuals with NBD and a history of dangerousness would be allowed to live in the community by court order only if they agreed to take the medicines and/or follow the treatment plans that can control the illness (much like TB patients). 

<P>

Individuals who fail to comply with the outpatient commitment order could be treated immediately, despite their objection--no additional court hearing would be required--or they could be hospitalized involuntarily if they meet the standards.  Individuals with NBD would participate in developing their own client-centered outpatient commitment order.

<P>

The ability of judges or independent administrative bodies to order client-centered outpatient treatment would provide communities with the incentive (and obligation) to develop appropriate treatment facilities.  So we must reject the argument that the lack of facilities makes outpatient treatment unworkable.

<P>

7. The state should not have to meet standards and burdens of proof that were established for criminals.

<P>

In many states an officer cannot transport someone to a hospital and a judge cannot order involuntary treatment unless he or she has "clear and convincing evidence" or "evidence beyond a reasonable doubt" that the person meets the dangerousness standard.  This usually means the officer has to actually observe overtly dangerous behavior. 

<P>

These standards--which may be appropriate in criminal cases--are inappropriate when deciding whether or not an individual needs medical care.  They are simply too difficult to meet.  If an individual needs medical care, an officer should be able to transport him or her if the decision is based on "information and belief" or "probable cause"--if the officer thinks the individual is a danger to him- or herself or others or needs medical help. 

<P>

Likewise, the court should be able to order treatment if it has "a preponderance of evidence" (more evidence for than against) indicating the individual is a danger to him- or herself or others and needs psychiatric care.  Lowering the burden of proof in this way would ensure that more people who need care receive it.

<P>

8. Include mechanism and funding for judicial education.

<P>

Many AMI members report that there is a great deal of deviation when different judges interpret the same law.  In addition, when the law changes many judges proceed as if it did not change.  For these reasons, any bill dealing with involuntary treatment or commitment should include a mechanism to inform the judiciary of the change in law and its implications.

<P>

I believe if state AMIs lead the way in implementing these changes, we will help eliminate violence, reduce stigma, and make more communities welcome facilities.  I also believe we will help those who lack insight into their illness and are wandering helplessly, hopelessly on our streets.  We should not require individuals sick enough to need help to be well enough to recognize it.  NAMI must not forget those who can't help themselves.  We must have compassion.
