Volkswagen to halt Beetle production in Brazil+

RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil, May 31 Kyodo

     Brazilians will have to say goodbye for the second time to the
hottest-selling car in the nation's history -- the ''Beetle'' model
manufactured by the Brazilian subsidiary of Germany's Volkswagen AG.
     Volkswagen do Brazil announced a plan Friday to cease production
of the popular old-fashioned model June 30, due to the model's low
profit margin.
     Volkswagen has been turning out a sluggish 1,300 Beetles a
month against 2,500 the company had targeted when it resumed assembly
of the model in 1993 after production was halted in 1986.
     Since the first Brazilian-made Beetle left the assembly line in
1959, the model has been the country's best seller, known today as
the ''Fusca.''
     The terminated production of the Beetle will leave millions of
''orphaned fans'' grouped in several fan clubs around the country,
industry analysts said.
     Output of the Beetle has been already ceased in Germany.  As of
July 1, Mexico will be the only country left which still assembles
the model.

Reform of pension fund system outlined, says paper+

TOKYO, June 1 Kyodo

     A government study group has drafted an outline for the reform
of the nation's welfare pension fund system, calling for the use of
money pooled under a government-managed pension plan to rescue
financially troubled corporate pension funds, a business daily said
Saturday.
     Corporate employees are entitled to receive pensions from the
government's pension plan for welfare purposes.  Apart from this
system, many business corporations have established their own pension
funds for their employees.
     Each corporate pension fund also manages part of the premiums
collected under the national pension plan, making the latter
susceptible to the former's financial plight.
     The drafted reform, prepared by the study group of the Health
and Welfare Ministry, proposes the government-managed pension plan
provide financial assistance to corporate pension funds when their
investment yields slip below certain levels, the Nihon Keizai Shimbun
said.
     The step is in response to the deteriorating financial standing
of corporate pension funds following the bursting of the ''bubble''
economy, the daily said.
     The reform plan also calls for the mandatory participation of
corporate pension funds in a deposit insurance system to protect
against bankruptcy, the newspaper said.
     Under the system, corporate pension funds put up a certain
amount of money to ensure pension payments even in the event of
bankruptcy.  At present, participation in the system is voluntary,
making it difficult to raise deposit rates, the paper said.

Health ministry distributes 'mad cow' booklet+

TOKYO, June 1 Kyodo

     The Health and Welfare Ministry has distributed an information
booklet to municipal and prefectural offices and other agencies
concerning the ''mad cow'' disease, officials said said Saturday.
     Topics such as the safety of imported beef from Britain, where a
recent outbreak of mad cow disease occurred, and how people may be
affected by the disease are discussed in a question and answer format.
     For example the booklet asks, ''Is imported beef from Britain
dangerous?'' coupled with the reply, ''Because we cannot verify the
safety of British beef, Japan is not allowing British beef into its
market.''
     The booklet is called ''Questions and answers about bovine
spongiform encephalopathy.''
     Scientists believe there is a link between the disease and its
human equivalent, Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease, a debilitating and
deadly ailment that damages the brain.
     A ministry spokesman said, ''The people in charge of this are
preparing the booklet because there is much confusion about the
issue.''  He added the booklet will provide answers to frequently
asked questions through case studies.
     Ministry officials are hoping to quickly distribute the booklet
to those in the meat importing business and to overseas travelers and
have so far distributed the booklet to about 120 places nationwide,
including airport quarantine offices.
     Information from World Health Organization (WHO) reports and
British authorities has been incorporated into the booklet, ministry
officials said.
     A ministry official said, ''In the end there are many questions
left unresolved.  Our report is based on the knowledge that has been
accumulated so far.''

Communication to start between PHS, cellular phones+

TOKYO, June 1 Kyodo

     Japanese telecommunications carriers are set to link personal
handy-phone system (PHS) users with those of ordinary cellular
phones, to allow communication between the devices just like ordinary
telephones, a business daily reported Saturday.
     The carriers reached the linkup agreement Friday, the Nihon
Keizai Shimbun said.
     The carriers originally planned to start such an arrangement at
the end of 1997, but decided to advance the plan in response to
strong demand from subscribers, the paper said.
     The new arrangement will eliminate the communication headaches
of 11 million cellular phone users and two million PHS users who are
currently unable to link up with each other.
     Users will have to dig even deeper into their pockets, however,
as the carriers are likely to charge around 400 yen for every three
minutes regardless of the distance between conversation partners,
according to the paper.
     PHS users will be able to initiate calls to cellular phones from
July, but the cellular phone system will not be technically ready to
dial up the PHS before September, the paper said.

Gasoline decontrol forcing oil companies to cut workers+

TOKYO, June 1 Kyodo

     Japan's recent deregulation of gasoline imports has eroded the
earnings of two large oil refiners, forcing one to cut staff and
another to give up on hiring new graduates next spring, a business
daily said Saturday.
     Nippon Oil Co. and its wholly owned subsidiary, Nippon Petroleum
Refining Co., will shave their workforce by combined 600, or 14%, to
3,700 in a four-year program ending in fiscal 1999, the Nihon Keizai
Shimbun said.
     Japan Energy Corp. will stop recruiting fresh graduates for
fiscal 1997 for the first time since its 1992 creation through the
merger of Nippon Mining Co. and Kyodo Oil Co., the newspaper said.
     The move is part of Japan Energy's streamlining program to
eliminate 800 jobs from the current 4,100 by the end of fiscal 1997,
the paper said.
     Domestic oil wholesalers and refiners have faced intense
competition from cheaper imports following the April 1 repeal of a
law that confines gasoline imports virtually to refiners.
     Gasoline prices dropped sharply in Japan even before the law's
scrapping, cutting into the refiners' earnings.
     In fiscal 1995 ended in March, Nippon Oil, for example, posted
an operating loss for the first time in nine years.
     Cosmo Oil Co. and Showa Shell Sekiyu K.K. earlier unveiled
similar streamlining plans.

Mistress hidden in Picasso masterpiece, scholar+

NARA, Japan, June 1 Kyodo

     Hidden beneath a masterpiece of Spanish artist Pablo Picasso is
an image of a woman snuggling up with the man who appears in the oil
painting, an art scholar said Saturday.
     According to Sadatoshi Miura, director of scientific preservation
for the Tokyo national cultural assets study center, the 1923 painting
on display at Tokyo's Bridgestone Museum is considered to be a
self-portrait of Picasso (1881-1973).
     Miura used infrared video technology and computer analysis to
find the hidden picture of the woman underneath the painting titled
''Saltimbanque seated with arms crossed.''
     Miura will present his findings about the canvas Sunday at a
symposium of art preservation scholars, which started Saturday in the
city of Nara in western Japan.
     He took 20 images from the infrared camera and analyzed them
with computers to reach his conclusion.
     William Rubin, a Picasso scholar and former curator at the New
York Museum of Modern Art, said he believes the original painting of
the woman, which has remained hidden for more than 70 years, was of a
mistress of Picasso.
     Rubin said that during a three-week period in August 1923,
Picasso drew about 200 images of the mistress and she was a model for
about 40 of his oil paintings.  He added that in one of these
paintings, the face of the mistress supplanted that of Picasso's wife.
     Officials at the Bridgestone museum had no comment about the
findings but said the painting is currently on display, and to the
untrained eye it is impossible to tell if there is another work
hidden beneath the painting.

Red Army member holding forged Japanese passport+

TOKYO, June 1 Kyodo

     A Japanese woman believed to be a member of the Japanese Red
Army wanted by police for more than 20 years was holding a forged
Japanese passport when she was taken into police custody last
Saturday in Peru, sources close to Japanese security authorities said
Saturday.
     The National Police Agency has sent officials to Peru to confirm
the identity of the woman, who is believed to be Kazue Yoshimura, 49,
the sources said.
     Police are expected to prepare an arrest warrant on a charge of
using a forged official document, they added.
     She was detained by Peruvian authorities investigating terrorist
groups in the capital of Lima, the sources said.
     Yoshimura, a member of the Japanese Red Army accused of dozens
of international terrorist crimes, was put on an international wanted
list in 1975 for her alleged involvement in the 1974 seizure of the
French Embassy in the Netherlands.

Flood of new rice retailers riding deregulation wave+

TOKYO, June 1 Kyodo

     About 80,000 newly authorized rice retailers stormed into the
nation's deregulated rice distribution system Saturday, doubling the
number of rice retailers in Japan to 170,000, industry sources said.
     The newcomers were encouraged by the new food control law that
took effect the same day, which allows rice retail business by such
sectors as supermarket chains, fast food restaurants, convenience
stores and gas stations.
     One of the entrants to the market, Lawson Inc., a large
convenience store chain operator, started selling packaged rice
through its network of 5,700 retail outlets nationwide, the sources
said.
     Clerks at Lawson's Toranomon branch in downtown Tokyo were seen
hustling about the store setting up a display of the new goods
Saturday morning.
     While large-scale retailers are waging high-profile marketing
campaigns for their new rice sales business, smaller retailers are
limiting their efforts to telephone orders, the sources said.
     A shop in Tokyo's Ota Ward which previously sold primarily tofu
said it will focus on local newspaper ad inserts.
     A clerk at the shop said, ''Although we would like to sell
high-quality rice at lower prices, we feel restricted by our
relations with conventional rice retailers in the neighborhood,''
with whom the shop is entering competition for the first time.

Hashimoto calls on Israel to continue peace process+

TOKYO, June 1 Kyodo

     Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto said Saturday he hopes the
election of Benjamin Netanyahu in the Israeli prime ministerial
election will not cause the Middle East peace process to regress.
     When asked by reporters to comment on Netanyahu's victory over
incumbent Prime Minister Shimon Peres, Hashimoto said ''The result
(of the election) is a judgment by the people of Israel, but I hope
that it will not reverse the Middle East peace process.''
     ''Because the percentages of votes were so close, I will watch
the formation of the new government very carefully,'' the premier
said in front of his official residence in Tokyo.
     Netanyahu, leader of the Likud Party, edged out Peres, a Nobel
Peace Prize laureate, 50.4% to 49.6% in Wednesday's
national election in Israel, the result of which was announced Friday.

21% of companies increase or resume dividend payments+

TOKYO, June 1 Kyodo

     Reflecting signs of an economic recovery, an increasing number
of polled Japanese companies increased or resumed their dividend
payments for fiscal 1995 that ended March 31, a Kyodo News tally
showed Saturday.
     According to the tally, a combined 21.5% of 1,447 companies
which are listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) and closed their
books at the end of March increased or resumed their dividend
payments.  The figure represented a rise of 6.2 percentage points
from the previous year.
     Companies that increased payments accounted for 249 or 17.8%
while those that resumed payments came to 52 or 3.7%.
     In contrast, the ratio of companies which decreased or skipped
such payments fell by 0.8 percentage point from the previous year to
a combined 12.3%.
     Of those companies, 143 or 10.2% paid a smaller dividend while
30 or 2.1% passed a dividend.
     Other companies kept dividend payments unchanged from the
previous year or continued to skip the payments.
     By industry, pharmaceutical and chemical companies generally
paid larger dividends or resumed payments due to higher profits
stemming from rationalizing efforts.
     Pulp and paper makers also gave better dividend payments as
increased demand boosted prices, as did precision instrument makers,
owing to brisk sales of semiconductor-related products.
     On the other hand, many banks decreased or skipped payments due
to huge pretax losses to write off bad loans to failed ''jusen''
housing loan companies and other nonbank moneylenders.
     Construction companies also showed lower business results,
reflecting sluggish demand from the private sector.

88% of firms not paying during holidays for nursing+

TOKYO, June 1 Kyodo

     About 90% of polled companies that allow workers to take a leave
to take care of family members who need nursing care do not pay
employees during the period, a survey by a nonprofit institute showed
Saturday.
     The survey covered 2,190 listed companies and 366 unlisted
companies, with a combined 329 responding, the Institute of Labor
Administration said.
     According to the findings, companies that have introduced the
nursing-care leave system accounted for 52.6% of the total.
     By size, 79% of companies with 3,000 employees or more already
have such a system, followed by 56.5% for firms between 1,000 and
2,999 employees and a 33.1% of those with less than 1,000 workers.
     Of those that already have the system, only 2.3% of companies
pay a regular salary to the worker during the period while 8% do not
pay a salary but provide a special allowance.  Those that do not pay
anything amounted to 88.5%.
     All companies are obliged by law to introduce the system from
April 1999 but the law does not cover payments to workers.

China agrees to CTBT banning of all types of nuke tests+

GENEVA, June 1 Kyodo

     China has dropped its opposition to a proposal for a planned
comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty (CTBT) that would ban all types
of nuclear explosions, Western negotiation sources said Saturday.
     The Chinese government has virtually given up its own proposal
that the CTBT allow ''peaceful nuclear explosions,'' the sources said.
     However, Beijing still wants the treaty to stipulate that the
issue of peaceful explosions will be discussed in a conference to
review the treaty 10 years after it goes into effect, they said.
     Participants in the nuclear test ban talks at the Geneva-based
Conference on Disarmament plan to draw up the treaty by the end of
this month and send it to the U.N. General Assembly for it to be
signed in September.
     Sha Zukang, China's ambassador to the Disarmament Conference,
said in May that China is ready to make compromises on its demand
that peaceful nuclear explosions should be exempt from the CTBT in
order to settle the issue as scheduled.
     Some nonnuclear states, including Japan and Canada, are
reportedly strongly opposed to referring to the term of peaceful
explosions in any form in the text of the treaty.
     Nuclear powers such as the United States and Russia are
discussing an alternative proposal of releasing a statement that the
issue will be discussed in a review conference, so that China will
not lose face, the sources said.

Regulations on foreign entertainers to be tightened+

TOKYO, June 1 Kyodo

     The Justice Ministry will tighten regulations on foreign
entertainers and athletes performing in Japan to prevent them from
overstepping the bounds of their visas, ministry officials said
Saturday.
     The officials said a revision of the ordinance governing foreign
entertainers and professional athletes will be posted in their
official gazette Monday, effective Sept. 3 this year.
     Under the new regulations, foreign entertainers and professional
athletes will not be permitted to perform in Japan unless they are
licensed by their home governments or public organizations and have
majored in their areas of specialty at educational institutions in
their home countries for more than two years, the officials said.
     The existing ordinance requires them only to have more than two
years of experience in their home countries.
     As for organizations sponsoring their visits to Japan, the new
law stipulates that they must have no record of violating three
relevant laws governing immigration, prostitution and refugees, the
officials said.
     At present, organizations are allowed to sponsor foreign
entertainers and pro athletes if the organizations, their executives
and regular employees have not broken the law over the past three
years.
     The officials said regulations on cultural interchanges
subsidized by central and local governments and public organizations
will be eased.
     The officials said the ministry decided to tighten the
regulations in light of a growing number of foreign entertainers in
Japan working in fields not permitted by their visas, such as working
at clubs as hostesses.
     Of about 60,000 foreign entertainers who entered Japan in 1995,
12,200, mostly Philippine nationals, overstayed their visas, they
said.

Ministry to review dioxine control guideline+

TOKYO, June 1 Kyodo

     The Health and Welfare Ministry has decided to review the
existing guideline for combating highly toxic dioxine for the first
time in five years, ministry officials said Saturday.
     The officials said the ministry was alarmed by reports that high
levels of the chemical have been detected in the air and soil near
garbage incinerators in recent years.
     The organic chlorine-based chemical, which is said to cause
cancer and birth defects, is contained in insecticides, bleaching
agents and ash recovered from garbage incinerators.  It is also used
in a defoliant.
     The officials said the chemical has even been detected in
drinking water and in breast milk.
     The officials said pollution was notable in areas where
small-capacity incinerators are currently in operation.
     The existing guideline set in December 1990 aims to limit the
tolerable level of dioxine discharged from garbage incinerators at
about 0.5 nanogram.  A nanogram is a billionth of a gram.
     The guideline, however, has come under criticism from
environmental groups because it applies only to about a dozen
large-scale incinerators in Japan which operate around the clock.
     Experiments at pollution research institutes in Kyoto and Hyogo
prefectures in western Japan said a greater amount of dioxine is
created in small-scale incinerators where temperatures in the furnace
are stable and combustion tends to be imperfect.
     The new guideline will be worked out by an expert panel formed
by the ministry in mid-May.
     The ministry officials said the tolerable level will be lowered
to less than 0.1 nanogram for large-scale incinerators, the same
level set in Germany and the Netherlands.
     Discussions by the panel will focus on the ceiling for obsolete
and small-scale incinerators, the officials said.

Hashimoto, Kim vow cooperation in co-hosting World Cup+

TOKYO, June 1 Kyodo

     Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto and South Korean
President Kim Young Sam on Saturday pledged full support from their
governments for the 2002 soccer World Cup finals which will be hosted
jointly by the two nations.
     Japanese officials said Hashimoto and Kim reached agreement on
mutual cooperation during talks over the telephone Saturday afternoon.
     The two leaders agreed that co-hosting will provide an
opportunity for the two countries to shape a ''future-oriented
relationship'' between them, a Japanese official said.
     Hashimoto and Kim made the pledge a day after soccer's world
governing body FIFA awarded the 2002 World Cup, the first to be held
in Asia, jointly to the two Asian neighbors.
     Hashimoto told Kim that Japan is determined to cooperate with
South Korea and make the 2002 tournament, to be contested by 32
nations, ''an example to the world.''
     Kim replied he was all for it, Japanese officials said.
     Japanese officials said Kim initiated the telephone call, an
indication that the Korean leader is eager to use the occasion to
erase the bitter rivalry which had engulfed the two countries during
the bidding process.
     Earlier in the day, Hashimoto told reporters that his government
will give its full backing to the co-hosting plan.
     ''There are areas where naturally the government has a role to
play, like (the issue of) passports,'' Hashimoto said.
     The 2002 World Cup will mark the first time that the tournament
will be co-hosted by two nations.
     Japan had vigorously opposed co-hosting the World Cup with South
Korea prior to FIFA's decision Friday but Hashimoto suggested
Saturday political considerations had prevented the government from
speaking out for joint hosting.
     ''It is wrong for politics to stay in front of sports,'' he said.
     The FIFA decision to split the 64-match tournament between Japan
and South Korea has brought anxiety and unease among the 15 Japanese
cities competing to get part of the World Cup action.
     Celebrations that had been scheduled in most of the candidate
cities if Japan had won the sole right to host the World Cup were
canceled.
     ''I feel like I suddenly lost enthusiasm.  Children who were
looking forward to attending the celebration were disappointed,''
said an official in Sapporo, northern Japan, which called off a
celebration scheduled at Atsubetsu Park stadium.
     Ceremonies scheduled in Hiroshima, Kobe and Aomori, northeastern
Japan, were also canceled.
     However, in Toyota, Aichi Prefecture in central Japan, municipal
officials decided to go ahead with their ceremony in a show of
sportsmanship.
     Hisashi Fukuoka, one of the ceremony's organizers, said, ''It's
good that Japan and South Korea will co-host the World Cup.''
     In Oita, southwestern Japan, prefectural officials also decided
to go ahead with their festivities.  One official said, ''South
Korean players are doing well for our local team and Oita is the only
candidate city in Kyushu, so we want to take a positive view of the
co-hosting plan.''

Casual wear popular as present for Father's Day+

TOKYO, June 1 Kyodo

     Casual wear like polo shirts and jackets are replacing neckties
as popular presents for Father's Day on June 16, reflecting the
recent boom in outdoor activities and ''casual Fridays,'' department
store and super market officials said Saturday.
     Seibu Department Stores Ltd.'s Ikebukuro store in Tokyo is
selling about 200 styles of polo shirts with those priced at between
7,800 yen and 9,800 yen selling well, officials said.
     At Mitsukoshi Ltd.'s Nihombashi store in Tokyo, polo shirts and
sweaters are also good sellers, officials said.
     The store is providing customers who buy a sweater with a free
service in which the salesclerk takes a picture of the customer, with
the sweater together with the picture and a message sent to the
father, they said.
     The store has also introduced information on items suitable as
presents on the Internet personal computer network, they added.
     Supermarket chain operator Seiyu Ltd. has also established a
special corner to sell such items in its larger stores.
     Polo shirts priced between 3,000 yen and 5,000 yen are popular,
Seiyu officials said.
     The company will present by lot personal handy-phone system
(PHS) sets to customers who buy men's items worth more than 20,000
yen at its stores, they said.
     ''Flashy designed neckties and belts were main sellers in the
days of the 'bubble' economy.  But recently, customers are turning
their appetite to polo shirts and other casual items, seeking better
goods at cheaper prices,'' said the Seiyu officials.

Miyamoto flatly denies alleged takeover bid against Ascii+

TOKYO, June 1 Kyodo

     Square Co. owner Masafumi Miyamoto on Saturday categorically
denied allegations that he had instigated a hostile takeover bid
against Ascii Corp.
     The denial follows remarks made at a news conference Thursday by
Ascii President Kazuhiko Nishi that four board members of the major
personal computer and video game software maker have tendered their
resignations because of their involvement in an abortive attempt to
take over the company.
     Ascii and Square, both based in Tokyo, are locked in fierce
rivalry in the computer game software market.
     The takeover attempt was alleged to have been masterminded by
Miyamoto, according to press reports published earlier this week.
     At the news conference Thursday, Nishi declined to confirm the
allegation, saying he was indirectly told that the mastermind is set
to file a libel suit if his name is made public.
     Miyamoto said Saturday, ''I was being made out to be a bad guy in
the latest takeover bid drama that had been written and played by
Nishi alone.''
     ''The resignations of the four board members can be viewed as a
move to restore democracy in Ascii which is run autocratically by
Nishi,'' said Miyamoto.
     The latest stir was touched off when the former executives
refused to affix their seals on a ''ringisho'' proposal on a 1.34
billion yen loan to an Ascii subsidiary made by Nishi on the grounds
it is dubious to extend such a loan to the unit, according to
Miyamoto.
     Asked for cooperation by them, Miyamoto, at one stage, had made
up his mind to help them leave the company and set up a new software
publishing house, he said.   But he did not do so, concerned that
such cooperation would spur the flight of Ascii employees to the new
firm, thus throwing Ascii into confusion, Miyamoto said.
     He instead proposed to the Industrial Bank of Japan, Ascii's
main bank, that Nishi step aside to the post of chairman and that
Ascii limit Nishi-proposed business diversification and promote
restructuring, Miyamoto said.
     Miyamoto also suggested that he is ready to buy, if necessary,
new shares if Ascii issues them for allotment to a third party in
order to avoid its net liabilities, he said.
     These proposals were taken by Nishi as an attempt to take over
his company with its executives, Miyamoto said.
     Miyamoto said he explained the restructuring plan to Nishi in
their meeting at a Tokyo hotel in late May but that Nishi rejected
it, saying there is no reason for anyone outside of the company to
meddle in its affairs.

Yeltsin to attend politico-economic talks at G-7 summit+

TOKYO, June 1 Kyodo

     Russian President Boris Yeltsin will attend for the first time a
newly created politico-economic forum at the Lyons summit of the
Group of Seven (G-7) nations in France later this month, Foreign
Ministry sources said Saturday.
     The sources said the forum will be an arena for comprehensive
discussions on problems such as employment, poverty and free trade
which require both political and economic approaches.
     Yeltsin's presence also is designed to support his bid for
reelection as Russian president because he faces a strong challenge
from Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov, they said.
     The leaders of the seven countries have agreed to rally behind
Yeltsin's reelection bid, and the June 27-29 summit is highly likely
to be held before an expected final showdown vote between Yeltsin and
Zyuganov in the presidential election, the sources said.
     The first round of Russian balloting is scheduled for June 16.
     The seven G-7 countries are Britain, Canada, France, Germany,
Italy, Japan and the United States.
     The sources said leaders of the seven nations will discuss a
Russian request for the membership in the Paris Club, a group of
major creditor nations, with a positive approach.
     They said the agenda for the politico-economic discussions will
include topics of a political nature which were incorporated in an
economic declaration issued at the previous summit held in Halifax,
Canada, last year, and those which require politico-economic
approaches.
     A formal agenda is being prepared at presummit meetings attended
by representatives of the seven nations and Russian Economic Minister
Yevgeny Yasin, the sources said.
     Specific subjects being considered for the agenda include
environmental problems and barriers to development, such as natural
disasters, safety of atomic power generation, intellectual property
and approaches to cope with expanding information society, they said.
     The sources said discussions in the new forum will help Russia
and former socialist nations promote transition to a market economy
and free trade.
     Russia will be kept from joining discussions on foreign exchange
and monetary policy coordination as in the past, and Yeltsin's
presence will not lead to expansion of the G-7 into the Group of 8,
they added.

Hatoyama questions moving U.S. bases in Okinawa+

NAHA, Japan, June 1 Kyodo

     A ruling coalition leader Saturday questioned the advisability
of a plan to move the U.S. Futemma air base on Okinawa Prefecture to
the site of an ammunition depot nearby.
     Yukio Hatoyama, a senior representative of New Party Sakigake,
the smallest partner of the three-party coalition, told a group of
voters in Naha that the planned relocation will damage the natural
environment of the area where the ammunition depot is located.
     Hatoyama was in Naha, the capital of Okinawa, Japan's
southernmost island prefecture, to support the party's candidate who
is running in an election for the prefectural assembly.
     In April, the United States agreed to return the Futemma
airfield site and relocate its functions to the site of the depot or
another location.
     He said the question involving U.S. military bases in the
prefecture should be considered by taking environmental problems into
the account, citing reports that high levels of harmful substances
such as mercury and polychlorinated biphenyl were detected in a
sewage disposal storage at the former site of a U.S. communication
facility.
     He called on voters to continue checking environmental pollution
near U.S. military bases.

Landowners to seek compensation after U.S. base return+

NAHA, Japan, June 1 Kyodo

     Local landowners of the U.S. Futemma Air Station in Okinawa
Prefecture said Saturday they will demand that the central government
make ''proper use'' of the base and pay compensation to them after it
is returned by the U.S. military under a bilateral accord.
     A group of landowners in Ginowan in the island prefecture, who
are leasing land to the U.S. military, decided at a rally to lobby
the central and local governments in seeking the measures.
     The rally was held because some landowners of the Futemma base
have expressed opposition to the return of the base as they presently
depend upon government fees for leasing their land to the U.S.
military.
     About 2,100 members, or three-fourths of the group's total, own
land at the Futemma Air Station.
     The United States agreed in April to return the Futemma base in
Ginowan to local landowners within five to seven years as part of
plans to scale down U.S. military facilities on Japan's southernmost
island.
     Seizen Hanashiro, chairman of the group, told some 500
participants that he would do his utmost to realize government
compensation to landowners and the promotion of ''proper use'' of the
base.

Ex-Premier Hata threatens to leave opposition party+

KUSHIRO, Japan, June 1 Kyodo

     Former Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata hinted Saturday that he might
leave opposition Shinshinto (New Frontier Party) unless intraparty
reforms make headway.
     ''It is possible that I will take new political action unless
the party makes resolute efforts to rebuild it to meet the people's
expectations,'' Hata said in a speech and a news conference at a
Kushiro hotel in northernmost prefecture of Hokkaido.
     He made the remark when asked about the possibility that he
might leave the party and join Hajime Funada, former acting chairman
of Shinshinto's general affairs council, in organizing a new group.
     Funada, former Economic Planning Agency chief, has repeatedly
expressed his intention to form a new party with Yukio Hatoyama,
secretary general of New Party Sakigake, the smallest party of the
tripartite ruling coalition.
     Hata, however, said he will stay in the party for the time being
to contribute to the promotion of the party's reforms.

Stocks expected to continue to be mixed next week++

TOKYO, June 1 Kyodo

     Stocks are expected to continue to be mixed in Tokyo next week,
as shares are expected to be sandwiched between selling on rallies
and bargain hunting by public funds and investment trusts.
     It will be hard for the barometer Nikkei Stock Average to stay
above the 22,000 line because an increasing number of market players
are ready to take profits above that mark, traders said.
     Given the expansion of the outstanding balance of
arbitrage-linked buying, anxiety about possible selling to unwind
arbitrage positions is also depressing investor confidence, they said.
     At the same time, shares will be supported at the bottom because
public funds, such as ''kampo'' postal life insurance money, and
investment trusts might buy shares on dips, they said.
     Ahead of the release of the Bank of Japan's ''Tankan'' quarterly
business sentiment survey late next week, a cautious mood might
prevail, with the Nikkei average hovering around 22,000.
     Domestic financial institutions and other market players are
expected to move to sell shares on rallies if the benchmark Nikkei
average breaks through the 22,000 line, they said.
     They also said market players are worried about possible
arbitrage unwinding ahead of the June 14 special quotations (SQ) day
for futures and options trading on June contracts.
     ''Fears of heavy arbitrage-related selling ahead of the SQ day
will continue to linger in the market,'' said Yasuo Ueki, general
manager for equities operations at Nikko Securities Co.
     Therefore, substantial gains cannot be expected, he said, but
shares will be solid at the bottom due to expected buying by
investment trusts, public funds and pension funds.
     About 15 investment trusts were set up this past week, into
which up to 366 billion yen worth of stocks will be included, so
buying by those investment trusts is expected, he said.
     Given the expected tug-of-war between anxieties ahead of the SQ
day and bargain hunting by such players as investment trusts, the
Nikkei average will hover around 22,000, Ueki said.
     However, Kazuyuki Suzuki, manager for equities trading at Daiwa
Securities Co., is more positive.  ''The correction phase is over and
the Nikkei average could challenge 22,500,'' he said.
     As traders have been rolling over the June contract of
Nikkei-225 futures to the September contract, it will be unnecessary
to worry about arbitrage-linked selling ahead of the SQ day, he said.
     In the absence of other leadership, incentive-backed speculative
stocks have led activity for the past several weeks, which has
contributed to the dull movement of the overall market.
     But, Suzuki said, ''After speculative favorites tumbled Friday,
major high-technology and telecommunications issues, including DDI,
are likely to become stellar performers.''
     This is attributable to reduced fears of lower prices of
semiconductor chips, following the announcement by Samsung
Electronics of South Korea that it will cut its chip output by 15%.
     Market players said they will pay attention to the Bank of
Japan's ''Tankan'' quarterly survey of business sentiment, due for
release Friday, as a clue to the direction of interest rates.
     The Nikkei average closed this past week at 21,956.19, up 157.76
points, or 0.72%, from the close of the previous week, when the index
suffered a 0.54% loss.
     On the Tokyo market's first section, trading became less active
with the average daily volume at 387.84 million shares, down 2.73
million shares from the preceding week's average.
     Trading house Kanematsu Corp. was the most actively traded stock,
with a volume of 73.09 million shares.  Its price closed this past
week at 700 yen, up 40 yen from a week earlier.
     Kobe Steel, a major steelmaker based in the western Japan port
city of Kobe, ranked second with a volume standing at 32.05 million
shares.  Its price declined 8 yen to 298 yen.
     The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, the nation's leading commercial
bank reborn from a merger in April, ranked third with a volume of
27.05 million shares.  Its price went up 90 yen to 2,560 yen.
     Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank ranked fourth with a volume of 26.94
million shares.  Its price was flat at 1,950 yen.  Nippon Steel
ranked fifth with 20.72 million shares.  Its price fell 2 yen to 367
yen.
     In terms of trading volume, the five stocks were followed by

Dollar expected to remain firm against yen in Tokyo++

TOKYO, June 1 Kyodo

     The U.S. dollar is likely to hold firm against the yen in Tokyo
next week under the ongoing influence of Friday's comment by Japan's
top cabinet spokesman in favor of continuing low domestic interest
rates.
     Chief Cabinet Secretary Seiroku Kajiyama said at a press
conference that, given the current economic situation, Japan's low
interest rate policy should be continued.
     The dollar is expected to move in the 107.00-109.50 yen range
next week, dealers said.
     ''Kajiyama's remark strengthens views that the Bank of Japan
(BOJ) will keep the official discount rate at the record low 0.5% for
the time being,'' said Nobuo Kihara, customer dealer at the foreign
exchange division of Banque Paribas in Tokyo.
     With the differential between U.S. and Japanese interest rates
remaining relatively large, the dollar's attractiveness can be
maintained, Kihara said.
     Prospects of higher Japanese interest rates were also dampened
by a series of slack domestic economic data, dealers said.
     In particular, the diffusion index of leading economic
indicators for March, released Tuesday by the Economic Planning
Agency, slipped below the 50% ''boom or bust'' line in the reporting
month for the first time in six months.
     The weak economic figures reflect the fragility of the fledgling
economic recovery in Japan, the dealers said.
     The market focus has now shifted to next Friday's release of the
central bank's ''Tankan'' quarterly survey of business confidence for
further clues on the development of Japan's economy, they said.
     The recent strengthening of the Australian dollar against the
yen is also supportive of the U.S. currency's downside against the
yen, said Kihara at Banque Paribas.
     Japanese individuals apparently continue to invest through the
nation's securities brokerages in high-yielding Australian
currency-denominated financial assets, Kihara said.
     The brokerages are believed to be underwriting large amounts of
Australian bonds to be issued ahead of Japan's summer bonus season,
in order to sell the bonds to such individuals.
     The continued rise of the U.S currency against the yen, however,
will be countered by mounting concerns over U.S. securities markets,
said Yoshiki Hamada, senior manager at the treasury trading
department of Asahi Bank.
     Both the key Dow Jones industrial average and U.S. government
bond prices are likely to continue to face downward pressure, due to
the favorable economic growth in that nation, Hamada said.
     This is because fears persist that inflationary pressure could
emerge in the U.S. economy in the near future, Hamada said.  In
theory, inflation should undermine the dollar's value.
     Market players are waiting for the announcement of U.S. nonfarm
payrolls for May, scheduled for next Friday, for further hints of
future trends in the nation's interest rates, dealers said.
     If the economic data turn out stronger than expected, it could
provide a significant boost to U.S. interest rates, they said.
     In Tokyo this past week, the U.S. currency hovered in a narrow
range between 107.60 yen and 108.93 yen.

Short-term money rates expected to weaken next week++

TOKYO, June 1 Kyodo

     Short-term money market rates are expected to weaken in Tokyo
next week under the continuing influence of Friday's comment by
Japan's top cabinet spokesman favoring low interest rates.
     Chief Cabinet Secretary Seiroku Kajiyama said at a press
conference that, given the current economic situation, Japan's low
interest rate policy should be continued.
     Kajiyama's remark reenforced the view that the Bank of Japan
(BOJ) will maintain the official discount rate at the current record
low 0.5% for a while to boost the economy, money brokers said.
     In interbank trading, the key unsecured overnight call money
rate is forecast to trade between 0.45% and 0.50%, compared with late
Friday's 0.49%, they said.
     On the open market, the rate on key three-month certificates of
deposit (CDs) issued by commercial banks will hover in the 0.53-0.58%
range, compared with late Friday's 0.56%, they said.
     Market players will be focusing on the release of the central
bank's ''Tankan'' quarterly survey of business confidence, due out
next Friday, for further hints of future developments in interest
rates, they noted.
     If the economic data turn out to be weaker than expected, this
should put significant downward pressure on interest rates, they said.

Sensitive trading seen on Tokyo bond market next week++

TOKYO, June 1 Kyodo

     Sensitive trading is expected in Japanese government bonds in
Tokyo next week ahead of Friday's release of the Bank of Japan's
''Tankan'' quarterly survey of business sentiment.
     Bond prices could fluctuate wildly, traders said, due to
speculation about the key survey, conducted in May, which is seen as
a clue to the future direction of domestic interest rates.
     There is less risk of bond prices falling, as fears of higher
interest rates have weakened, but substantial gains cannot be
expected ahead of the release of the Tankan report, they said.
     However, there are signs that investors, who retreated to the
sidelines in recent sessions, may try to bring bond prices higher,
the traders said.
     The yield on the No. 182 cash bond fell 0.06 percentage point
during this past week to 3.160%, while the key September contract
increased 0.40 point to 118.90.
     As the prediction for the industrial output index for June came
in weaker than expected, bond prices remained steady in this past
week.  Chief Cabinet Secretary Seiroku Kajiyama's remark supporting
the current low interest rate policy also helped support bond prices.

Clinton renews MFN status for China+

WASHINGTON, May 31 Kyodo

     President Bill Clinton formally extended China's
most-favored-nation (MFN) trade status Friday for another year,
calling it ''the best way'' to advance U.S. economic and security
interests in Asia under his ''engagement'' policy toward Beijing.
     The announcement was anticipated as the president declared his
intention earlier this month to renew the status for allowing China
the lowest tariffs the United States imposes on its trading partners.
     ''The president has taken this step because he believes that
continued engagement with China is the best way to help it become a
constructive force for stability and prosperity in Asia and to
advance important American interests,'' the White House said in a
statement.
     Clinton's decision was immediately relayed in a letter to
Congress, thus setting the stage for debate with legislators opposing
the unconditional renewal of China's MFN status amid lingering
concerns over Beijing's human rights, weapons proliferation, trade,
Taiwan and other issues.
     Under the MFN procedures, Congress has until July 3 to introduce
a resolution to reject the president's decision or until Aug. 31 to
approve it.  Clinton has the authority to veto the resolution.
     The MFN extension came as another step in the complicated zigzag
approach taken recently by the Clinton administration toward China.
     Washington and Beijing on May 15 announced tit-for-tat lists of
sanctions they would impose upon each other if the dispute over the
February 1995 bilateral agreement on intellectual property rights
remains unresolved June 17.  The two nations are to resume talks
next week.
     Shortly before announcing the sanctions list, the U.S. decided
not to impose sanctions over China's alleged sale of nuclear weapons
technology to Pakistan after Beijing gave assurance it would prevent
such exports in the future.
     Addressing these issues, the White House statement said revoking
the MFN status ''would effectively sever our economic relationship
with China, undermining our capacity to influence China in a broad
range of areas, including human rights, nonproliferation, trade,
Taiwan relations and others.''
     But it said, ''Engagement with China does not mean acquiescence
to Chinese policies or practices we oppose.''
     ''Far from giving China a special deal, renewal of MFN confers
on it a trading status equal to that enjoyed by most other nations.
Simply put, it gives China normal trade status.  It is not being
granted as a favor to China,'' the statement said.
     ''The president has demonstrated that he is prepared to use
sanctions and other means at his disposal to promote America's goals
regarding China, whether it is protecting U.S. intellectual property,
deterring dangerous (weapons) proliferation or promoting human
rights,'' the statement said.  ''These are the right tools to use in
advancing U.S. interests.''
     In 1994, Clinton adopted a policy of unlinking Beijing's human
rights situation from the MFN issue.
     The statement also said MFN revocation ''would not advance
the interests of Taiwan or Hong Kong'' because the two economies ''are
enormously dependent on continued trade between the U.S. and China.''

Asian editorial excerpts+

TOKYO, June 1 Kyodo

     Excerpts of selected editorials carried by Asia-Pacific
newspapers in the latest week:
     Defecting N. Korean Pilot's Testimony (The Korea Times, Seoul):
     We often hear that communist North Korea is busy preparing for
war against the South.  But our particular attention was drawn to
press remarks by the defecting North Korean air force Capt. Lee Chol
Su that Pyongyang is poised to attack the South and to defeat it in
one week.
     It appears that a positive, serious assessment is needed of the
war plan claimed by the North Korean defector, as the pilot is likely
to have had access to up-to-date information on changes in North
Korean plans to invade the South, and an attack is more likely to be
a surprise one than not.
     At the same time, Lee's remarks appear to chime in with other
evidence, indicating a need to go onto a national alert against the
communists in the North, who have never abandoned their belligerent
plan to take over the South militarily.
     We are obliged to note that the shocking war scenario envisages
Seoul being seized in 24 hours, Taejon in the next couple of days and
Pusan and all the rest of the country in seven days.  In preparation
for the three-stage war plan, 270 fighters have been or are being
deployed in forward positions for a surprise attack, according to Lee.
     This war plan information and North Korean leader Kim Jong Il's
continued warmongering behoove us to take all necessary
countermeasures and to tighten the discipline of governmental and
nongovernmental organizations and strengthen overall state of
vigilance against the North.
(May 30)
     Dangerous for nations to ignore yen debts (Nation, Bangkok):
     Japan takes great pride in being the world's largest donor
nation, and boasts as well that its development aid policies have
contributed in a big way to the rapid economic growth of Southeast
Asia.
     But while Japan is due some applause for maintaining its
comparatively high level of official development assistance (ODA), a
less considered phenomenon is the debt accrued by recipient countries
-- especially when seen against a strong yen.
     Of total Japanese bilateral credit, around 60% is loaned to East
and Southeast Asian countries.  The increasing indebtedness to Japan
is reflected in the rise in their yen-donominated long-term debt.
     The Japanese yen started to appreciate in value against the U.S.
dollar in the second half of the 1980s.  This trend became more
dramatic in the 1990s.
     Whether on the force of the market or through directed policy,
an appreciation of the Japanese yen was forthcoming.
     Ironically, many countries heavily indebted to Japan turn a
blind eye to the yen appreciation's real effect on their
indebtedness.  This is primarily because of the importance of Japan
in crucial areas of their economies.
     But borrower nations have to be aware that an appreciated yen
would impact negatively on their balance of payments situation.
Also, the additional cost of projects financed by Japanese loans that
result from the yen appreciation put to question the economic
viability of individual projects since the appreciation can result in
serious long-term losses.
     However, to simply ignore the impact of the yen appreciation on
national budgets as well as the economic viability of projects
financed by Japanese loans, would be foolhardy for its bears serious
implications on priority, equity and development questions among
debtor countries.
     A more detailed review of the impact of yen appreciation on
specific countries is thus in order.  When this is done, the next
step will be to find mechanism through which Japan can share part of
the costs of the yen appreciation to the debtor country.
     Such a gesture may seem magnanimous, but it is in the interest
of Japan and other creditor nations that debt service repayments do
not become so much of a burden that they threatens the economic and
social stability of recipient nations.
(May 26)
     Donors only in name? (Business Times, Kuala Lumpur):
     Some Western countries in the International Labor Organization
(ILO) are good at making verbal pledges but not necessarily as good
when it comes to honoring them.  The United Nations, the
International Monetary Fund and the Asian Development Bank are just
some of the agencies that are facing financial crisis because certain
countries will not pay their dues.
     Developed countries' commitment at the Rio (de Janeiro) Earth
Summit have also yet to be met and the importance that they once
attached on development aid and generalized system of preferences is
declining rapidly.
     Yet, these are the same countries that try to dominate the
process in the ILO and in its governing body.  When Malaysia voiced
its views that the ILO should be ''more representative'' of
developing countries' views, it was seen as a nuisance.
     Malaysia has been a member of the ILO since 1957 and has
ratified a fair number of its conventions and recommendations, which
sometimes suggest that the world body lacks empathy for the realities
in developing and least-developed countries but, generally, the ILO
has been involved in measures that are aimed to help improve workers'
lot and improved their rights.
     In this regard, we would not want the ILO to go under just
because some developed countries are not paying their dues.  Perhaps,
the relatively poor countries like Malaysia will have to contribute
more.  But if that is the case, we should have our fair share of say
in the ILO and in the recommendations and conventions that the body
adopts.  At the same time, the ILO will have to learn to be
economical and trim its expenses.
(May 30)

U.S. pondering more food aid to N. Korea+

WASHINGTON, May 31 Kyodo

     The United States is about to decide on whether to provide
additional food aid to North Korea, which is suffering a serious food
shortage since the heavy flooding of last summer, an administration
official said Friday.
     ''There is a positive inclination'' toward further humanitarian
aid, the official said, noting that Washington sees the North Koreans
as near the brink of starvation.
     ''The issue is under active consideration,'' the official told
Kyodo News.
     In February, Washington decided to extend 2 million dollars
worth of humanitarian assistance to North Korea through a U.N.
program for flood-related relief, brushing aside the cautious
approach taken by Japan and South Korea over further aid.
     The February decision came on top of a 225,000 dollar
contribution made last year.
     During a trilateral subcabinet-level meeting May 14, the U.S.
agreed with Japan and South Korea not to extend further food aid to
North Korea for the time being.
     But U.S. sources said South Korea, which has been less positive
about providing food aid before North Korea agrees to the proposed
four-way peace talks on the Korean Peninsula, has begun to soften its
position on further aid.
     U.S. President Bill Clinton and South Korean President Kim Young
Sam in April proposed talks among the U.S., China, and North and
South Korea to negotiate toward a peace accord for the divided
peninsula.
     Against this backdrop, the international community, including
the U.S. and South Korea, may decide in favor of additional food aid
to Pyongyang, taking advantage of a soon-to-be announced emergency
appeal for such aid by the U.N. Department of Humanitarian
Assistance, the sources said.
     In Rome, the home of the U.N. World Food Program,
representatives of the governments involved discussed Thursday how
much additional aid could be provided.

Kim Jong Il likely to emerge from isolation soon+

WASHINGTON, May 31 Kyodo

     North Korean leader Kim Jong Il is expected to emerge from
isolation and his control should become ''more public'' later this
year, U.S. congressman Bill Richardson said Friday.
     ''Kim Jong Il is in control, and I think this will be made more
public later in the year,'' Richardson told a press conference held
to discuss his recent three-day visit to North Korea.
     ''I'm not firmly convinced, but I saw a lot of signs, media and
otherwise and in discussions with officials, that he will be emerging
from his isolation,'' said Richardson, a Democrat from New Mexico.
     ''I think this is positive because that's a civilian leadership,
and it is encouraging for the West because I think there is a
pragmatic streak in those that operate ministries like foreign
relations,'' he said.
     Kim has been considered the de facto leader of North Korea since
the death in July 1994 of his father Kim Il Sung, who headed the
northern half of the Korean Peninsula since its founding in 1948.
     But he has yet to formally assume the nation's top two posts --
state president and general secretary of the Workers Party of Korea.
     This, along with rarity of his public appearances, has sparked
various speculation about the condition of his health and the
possibility of an internal power struggle.
     But Richardson said, ''On the positive side that I saw, the
civilian leadership of North Korea seems to be stronger...I believe
now that through the Foreign Ministry, specifically Vice Minister
Kang Sok Ju who I dealt with, there is strong impressive leadership
that is more moderate and pragmatic.''
     As for conflict with South Korea, Richardson said North Korean
officials ''were more conciliatory toward South Korea than in the
past.  They were more positive.  They have wide differences, but some
of the hostility that I saw before was absent.
     Richardson said the United States, South Korea, Japan and other
nations should help North Korea with its current food shortage to
open the way for Pyongyang to move ahead with dialogue, especially on
the proposed four-way talks for a permanent peace agreement to
replace the current truce accord on the divided peninsula.
     U.S. President Bill Clinton and South Korean President Kim Young
Sam proposed the quadrilateral talks among North and South Korea,
China, and the U.S.
     ''I think this is a good juncture to move with some type of
positive engagement with North Korea, and I think the food and
humanitarian assistance is the key,'' Richardson said.
     The additional food aid ''should be done immediately,'' he said.
''I think the situation is very grave.  I didn't see famine, but
close to it.''
     ''We should provide food assistance on a humanitarian basis,
and I believe that will trigger some positive responses on their
part'' on the proposed four-way talks, Richardson said, noting that
he has made ''this recommendation'' to the White House and Congress.
     North Korea has yet to offer its response to the proposed talks,
but it ''did not eliminate the possibility of participating,''
Richardson said.  ''That is still an option.''
     He added that Pyongyang wants more details such as the venue,
the agenda, and the level of the proposed talks.

Toyota Tianjin venture holds opening reception+

TIANJIN, China, June 1 Kyodo

     A newly established joint engine venture between Toyota Motor
Corp. and its Chinese partner held an opening reception in Tianjin on
Saturday in a move expected to accelerate the Japanese automaker's
full-scale Chinese operations.
     Toyota President Hiroshi Okuda and some 10 executives of
Japanese auto parts makers in the Toyota group attended the ceremony
for the equally owned Tianjin Toyota Motor Engine Co., which was set
up in the Chinese city in mid-May with a capital of 248 million
dollars.
     It marks the first time for Toyota, Japan's biggest automaker, to
establish production of such a key auto component in China.
     The new company will manufacture 1.3-liter engines from early
1998 at an annual pace of 150,000 units, Toyota officials said.
     Most of the engines will be installed in the Charade passenger
cars which the Chinese partner, Tianjin Automobile Industrial (Group)
Co., manufactures with the backing of Daihatsu Motor Co., a Japanese
automaker in the Toyota group, the officials said.
     Some of the engines will be exported, the officials said.
     They said the new company is considering producing 1.6-liter and
1.8-liter engines for use in the Corona passenger car.
     Tianjin Automobile is one of China's eight major auto groups.
     Toyota also established a joint company with Tianjin Automobile
in December last year to manufacture drive trains.
     Toyota is the latest major Japanese automaker that has acquired
Chinese government approval to produce vehicle engines in a joint
venture with a Chinese concern.
     Already, Honda Motor Co. and Mitsubishi Motors Corp. have
received the go-ahead.
     But industry analysts say Japanese automakers, notably big ones,
will face an uphill battle against their U.S. and European
competitors in the vast Chinese market with a population of 1.2
billion as they are far behind in entering the China market.
     Volkswagen AG of Germany, which entered the Chinese market as
early as the 1980s, now holds a dominant position, with its joint car
production ventures with Shanghai Automotive Industry Corp. and
another venture with a carmaker based in Jilin Province, northeastern
China, performing steadily.
     Chrysler Corp. of the U.S. and the French maker of Citroen and
Peugeot cars have consolidated their footholds in China, while
General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co., both U.S. firms, have
reached the point where they will be able to find joint-venture
partners in Shanghai and Nanjing, respectively, in the near future.
     Among Japanese carmakers, Suzuki Motor Corp. is turning out
minicars in the city of Changan, Shaanxi Province, central China, in
a joint venture with a Chinese concern.
     Daihatsu Motor Co. of the Toyota group and Fuji Heavy Industries
Ltd. are extending technological cooperation for vehicle production.
     But Japanese auto giants have yet to acquire a stake in car
production ventures in China.
     This stems largely from the judgment they made in the 1980s that
it was still premature to enter the Chinese car market, analysts say.
     In an automotive industry policy unveiled in 1994, the Chinese
government called for combining a number of automobile enterprises
into eight major groups in an effort to develop the sector into the
nation's key industry.
     Assuming that motor vehicle demand in China will grow by 8 to 9%
a year until 2010, the government established rules for the
introduction of foreign capital for car production.
     Flocking foreign carmakers, however, have made the Chinese car
market a ''seller's market'' where the Chinese are able to strike
favorable deals for themselves with foreign makers, analysts say.
     In the latest deal with Tianjin Automobile, Toyota appears to
have had little choice but to accept unfavorable terms in order not
to lose the deal, industry sources said.

MITI to promote environmental equipment market in Asia+

TOKYO, June 1 Kyodo

     The Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) and 12
companies have jointly launched a full-scale study of how best to
nurture markets for environment-related equipment in developing
countries in Asia, according to ministry officials.
     The move represents an upgrading of the Green Aid Plan initiated
in 1992 with the aim of transferring environment-friendly
technologies to such countries.
     MITI plans to draw up a plan by this fall and will earmark funds
from the nation's official development assistance (ODA) for specific
projects, the officials said.
     Asian developing economies are increasingly concerned that
environmental degradation will put a dent in their economic growth,
analysts say.  But they are giving priority to improving social
infrastructure through the construction of such facilities as
electric power plants, highways and railroads.
     These countries thus lag far behind industrialized nations in
environmental protection measures, they said.
     MITI intends to help expand the overseas operations of
environment-related businesses while striving to check the
cross-border spread of pollution such as acid rain, the officials
said.
     The 12 companies involved in the study include Nippon Steel
Corp., Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd., Ebara Corp. and Chiyoda Corp.
     A joint study panel of MITI and these companies will consider
ways to promote the application of low-cost technologies which
protect the environment and foster environment-friendly industries
through joint ventures with Japanese businesses, the officials said.
     Under the Green Aid Plan, which covered six Asian countries, MITI
and participating companies installed desulfurization equipment in
two electric power plants in China.
     In addition, they developed an exhaust heat recovery system for
use at a cement plant in the Philippines.

China-Taiwan trade up 2.9% in 1st qtr+

HONG KONG, June 1 Kyodo

     Merchandise trade between China and Taiwan for the first quarter
of this year rose 2.9% from a year earlier to 4.84 billion U.S.
dollars, Taiwan's Central News Agency reported Saturday.
     The figure was released Friday by Taiwan's Ministry of Economic
Affairs, the news agency said.
     The ministry attributed the low growth in the value of the
two-way trade in part to a rate cut in China's tax refund on its
exports as well as to recent tensions between Beijing and Taipei, it
said.
     Taiwan's trade with China accounted for 9.3% of the total value
of its foreign trade, it said.
     Trade between China and Taiwan was especially sluggish in March
when China conducted a series of missile tests in the Taiwan Strait,
dropping 5.8% from the same month last year to 1.63 billion dollars,
it said.
     Taiwan's exports to China came to 4.13 billion dollars in the
January-March period, up 3.7% from a year earlier, while its imports
from China fell 1.7% to 708 million dollars, leaving Taiwan with a
trade surplus of more than 3.4 billion dollars, the ministry was
quoted as saying.

India's new premier Gowda sworn in+

NEW DEHLI, June 1 Kyodo

     Hardanhalli Dodde Deve Gowda was sworn in as India's 12th prime
minister Saturday following the collapse of the country's first Hindu
Nationalist government earlier this week.
     Gowda, 63, was administered the oath of office a little past noon
by President Shankar Dayal Sharma at the presidential palace.
     The peasant-turned politician will be heading a coalition
government comprising two national and three regional parties.
     The new government will be India's fourth coalition government
since its independence from Britain in 1947.

Mongolian fire fighters have tough road: journalist+

SAPPORO, June 1 Kyodo

     A Japanese journalist who recently returned from fire-plagued
Mongolia has said fire fighters are still having a difficult time as
water is running out and high winds are spreading the blaze.
     Tadanori Matsuda, chief of the Sapporo-based Japan bureau of the
weekly Mongolian newspaper Mongol Times, said he witnessed the
massive fire that has raged through the forests, fields and mountains
of Mongolia for almost six weeks.
     Matsuda went to the Mongolian capital of Ulan Bator in early May
and visited a mountain where the fire was burning.  About 10 nomads
working with shovels and tree limbs were trying to snuff out the fire.
     Matsuda said a total of 322 places have caught fire and as of
May 23, 29 grasslands and 84 mountains were still ablaze.
     Although firefighters had once put out the blaze, strong winds
have rekindled it, he said.
     The military has been called out around the capital to help
quell the inferno, but efforts to put out the blaze in rural areas
have not made progress, he said.
     In the eastern Mongolian frontier near the Chinese border in
Dornod Province, fire has rolled across 70 to 80% of the
area's grasslands, he said.
     Nomads and other people who live on the frontier lack
necessities for daily life, according to Matsuda.
     Matsuda is conducting a fund raising campaign for relief efforts
and is halfway to his goal of collecting 1.5 million yen from donors
in Japan.

S. Korea posts 1.44 bil. dlr trade deficit in May+

SEOUL, June 1 Kyodo

     South Korea posted an external trade deficit of 1.44 billion
U.S. dollars in May, bringing its cumulative trade deficit for the
first five months of the year to 7.46 billion dollars, the
International Trade and Industry Ministry said in a preliminary
report Saturday.
     Exports for the month under review increased 6.8% from a year
earlier to 11.37 billion dollars while imports advanced a larger 8.3%
to 12.8 billion dollars, the ministry said.
     The May figure came close to the government's revised trade
deficit projection for all of this year of 8 billion dollars.
     The South Korean government projected the 1996 trade deficit to
be 7 billion dollars at the beginning of the year but recently
revised it upward in the face of a rapid deterioration in the
nation's trade balance which started in April.

Japan promises to consult S. Korea over North issue+

TOKYO, June 1 Kyodo

     Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto told South Korean President Kim
Young Sam on Saturday that Tokyo will consult with Seoul before
making any decision on whether to provide additional food aid to
North Korea, Japanese officials said.
     Hashimoto made the remark in a telephone conversation in
connection with an expected call from the United Nations for the
international community to offer humanitarian aid to the North to
help alleviate the food shortage there, the officials said.
     Kim replied that he hopes Japan will talk with South Korea when
making a decision on the issue, they said.
     The two leaders also pledged to cooperate with one another in
co-hosting the 2002 World Cup soccer finals.
     As for proposed four-way peace talks on the Korean Peninsula,
Hashimoto said Japan hopes Pyongyang will agree to participate in the
talks soon.
     Kim and U.S. President Bill Clinton during their meeting in April
proposed that the Korean peace talks be held among North and South
Korea, China and the United States.

H.K. dailies rap high-ranking official's remarks on press+

HONG KONG, June 1 Kyodo

     Hong Kong newspapers Saturday criticized the top Chinese
official in charge of Hong Kong and Macao affairs for remarks he made
hinting at possible limitations on freedom of the press after the
British colony's reversion to China.
     Lu Ping, director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of
China's State Council, said in an interview with Cable News Network
(CNN) on Friday that no statements voicing support for ''two Chinas''
would be allowed after Hong Kong's return to China on July 1, 1997.
     Lu told CNN that the news media in Hong Kong will have freedom
to criticize the Chinese government but that if it leads to movements
to overthrow the government, it would be a different matter.
     The Ming Pao Daily News in an editorial asked for explanation of
what he meant by the remarks, saying if he will not reveal his real
intention, it will create apprehension among Hong Kong citizens
toward the reversion.
     The Hong Kong Economic Journal expressed anger, sarcastically
saying the paper might be forced to carry only Xinhua News Agency's
reports that have criticized Taiwanese President Lee Teng-hui.
     The Apple Daily carried a headline in Chinese that asked, ''Is
this what China means by freedom of the press?''
     Pro-Beijing papers such as the Wen Wei Po, however, only
reported Lu's remarks.
     Lu will start a weeklong official visit to Japan starting Sunday
to discuss with Japanese political and business leaders about Hong
Kong affairs.

500 Vietnamese apply to return home from Philippines+

PUERTO PRINCESA, Philippines, June 1 Kyodo

     More than 500 Vietnamese asylum seekers have applied for
voluntary repatriation and are expected to take Air Vietnam flights
to their homeland starting June 11, administrators of a refugee camp
southwest of Manila said Saturday.
     The group constitutes the biggest number of asylum seekers who
have volunteered for repatriation before the closure, at the end of
the month, of the Philippine First Asylum Camp some 570 kilometers
southwest of Manila, said Maj. Gen. Guillermo Ruiz, the camp
administrator.
     Ruiz said another flight is scheduled for June 15 and more are
expected in the weeks afterward to accommodate all those who have
volunteered to go back and whose return to Vietnam has been cleared
by the government there.
     The camp currently houses some 2,000 asylum seekers whose
applications for resettlement to third countries have been denied.
Earlier efforts to persuade them to go home have resulted only in
trickles of volunteers.
     Asked about the fate of those who refuse to go back or have not
been granted clearances, Ruiz said, ''It will be up to the church to
take care of them.''
     The Catholic Church has proposed a plan that includes the
gradual turnover of the camp to nongovernment organizations, the
legalization of the Vietnamese' interim stay, and assistance in
getting travel documents for remaining asylum seekers.
     The plan was drawn up following church criticism of the violent
dispersal of demonstrators who tried to prevent the forced
repatriation of 84 asylum seekers Feb. 14.
     Estimates of Vietnamese who would be unable to go home for
various reasons were unavailable, but Ruiz said the Catholic Church
has signaled its intention to take care of those people.
     Despite appeals from government officials and the church for the
asylum seekers to return voluntarily to Vietnam, few of the asylum
seekers have returned to Vietnam, officials said.
     In an earlier interview, camp leader Che Nhat Giao said many
Vietnamese families, especially those with children, have decided to
go home because of slim prospects for finding jobs in the Philippines
when the camp closes June 30.

21-member coalition government in India sworn in+

NEW DELHI, June 1 Kyodo

     A 21-member coalition government was sworn in Saturday following
the collapse of India's first Hindu nationalist government earlier
this week.
     While the Hindu nationalist government was formed May 16 in
accordance with the results of the recent general elections, it fell
May 28 following its failure to secure enough support to win a
parliamentary majority.
     The new five-party coalition government headed by H.D. Deve
Gowda was administered the oath of office by President Shankar Dayal
Sharma in a simple ceremony at the presidential palace.
     Apart from Prime Minister Gowda, 12 cabinet ministers and eight
ministers of state took oaths of office in the new coalition
government.
     Prominent among the cabinet ministers whose portfolios have yet
to be announced are P. Chidambaram, the popular commerce minister in
the previous congress and one of the architects of its economic
liberalization program, Inder Kumar Gujral, a former foreign
minister, Mulayam Singh Yadav, a powerful regional leader and
champion of the lower castes and minorities, and Ram Vilas Paswan and
S.R. Bommai, heavyweights in the Janata Dal (People's Party).
     The five-party coalition government comprises the dominant
Janata Dal, the Samajwadi Party (Socialist Party), Telegu Desam,
Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam and Tamil Maanila Congress.
     Aside from those groups, the coalition is supported by eight
other parties, including the left front comprised of four communist
parties, Madhya Pradesh Vikas Congress, Karnataka Congress, Asom
Gana Parishad and All India Indira Congress.
     Asom Gana Parishad, an important constituent of the coalition
government, is still unrepresented because the party has yet to
decide on participation in the new setup.  The Communist Party of
India is also expected to make a decision by Sunday on whether to
take part.
     Gowda, who is the second prime minister from southern India, has
seven ministers of cabinet rank from the three southern states of
Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh.

Backers of 'comfort woman' to seek apology from premier+

TOKYO, June 1 Kyodo

     Some 100 supporters of a South Korean woman, forced to provide
sex service for Japanese soldiers before and during World War II,
adopted Saturday a note of protest to be sent to Prime Minister
Ryutaro Hashimoto seeking a letter of apology.
     Hashimoto has decided to send letters of apology to the
so-called ''comfort women'' along with compensation payments from a
private fund, government sources said last month.
     The 74-year-old South Korean woman told the gathering that she
was abducted by Japanese Imperial Army at the age of 16 and sent to
brothels at the front line in such Chinese provinces as Hebei.
     She said the Japanese government should shoulder part of the
one-time payments to be given from the fund to surviving women in
South Korea, the Philippines and Taiwan.
     The Asian Women's Fund was inaugurated at the government's
initiative last July as an event marking the 50th anniversary of the
end of the war.
     As the first batch of payments from the fund, its operators
plan to start making one-time payments of 3 million yen in July or
later to each of some 300 ''comfort women.''
     The government has maintained a policy that it will not extend
compensation from state coffers to former sex slaves despite a U.N.
report calling on it to compensate them and punish those responsible
for their recruitment.
     Historians estimate that 80,000 to 200,000 women, mostly from
the Korean Peninsula which was then under Japanese colonial rule,
were forced into sexual slavery in front-line brothels for the
Japanese Imperial Army.

Suu Kyi thanks Japan for pressuring junta+

YANGON, June 1 Kyodo

     Myanmar pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi expressed
gratitude Saturday to Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto for
Japan's help in putting pressure on the ruling military junta to
release arrested members of her party.
     Suu Kyi said in an interview with Kyodo News that such pressure
helped to keep the junta from fully preventing a three-day convention
held by Myanmar's National League for Democracy (NLD) in Yangon from
Sunday to Tuesday.
     The junta arrested some 250 NLD members in an apprent bid to
prevent them from attending the meeting, the first large-scale
opposition meeting since Suu Kyi was released from six years of house
arrest last July.
     Soon after the junta's arrests, the Japanese and other
governments criticized the military regime, calling for the release
of those arrested.
     Of those detained, 111 have been released so far, according to
NLD sources.
     Suu Kyi also said Japanese pressure can help lead the junta to
release all the arrested people.
     She said the junta's reported action to have forced two of the
arrested members to sign a paper to leave the NLD is illegal and
should be nullified.
     The NLD won 392 seats of the 485 at stake in the May 27, 1990,
general election, but the junta ignored the results.

Brazil sports media blasts co-hosting of 2002 World Cup+

RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil, May 31 Kyodo

     The Brazilian sports media, which had largely anticipated that
Japan would be picked to host the 2002 World Cup finals, has heavily
criticized the decision by the world soccer governing body to jointly
award the competition to Japan and South Korea.
     Sports editors were unanimous in saying FIFA's decision will
bring on unforeseeable problems for the competition organizers and
has set a troublesome precedent.
     ''What will happen if three countries apply to host the 2006
cup?  If two countries have been selected now, why not three?'' said
Sergio Garcia, editor of the sports magazine Placar.
     Garcia said the co-hosting scheme is an indication that
Brazilian FIFA chief Joao Havelange's influence is waning.
     On the diplomatic front, Garcia speculated on whether the cup
will be officially dubbed the Japan-South Korea, South Korea-Japan or
even the Asia cup 2002.
     In a reported attempt to gain Havelange's support, South Korean
auto manufacturer Hyundai had inked a sponsorship contract with
Fluminense Football Club, of which Havelange is honorary president.
     Last month, however, Hyundai announced its decision not to renew
the contract, which expired Friday, one day before FIFA's official
meeting to choose the host country, and the move was seen to indicate
a successful bid by Japan for the cup.
     ''This decision will trigger unprecedented political problems
which will drag on through the coming months,'' Carlos Macedo, editor
of sports daily Jornal do Sports, told Kyodo News.
     The Jornal do Sports published Friday a full-page story
analyzing why Japan should definitely be appointed to host the cup.
     As with everything related to soccer, in the so-called ''Land of
Football'' the Brazilian media followed the battle of the Japan
versus South Korea hosting bid with great interest.
     Brazil is the only country to have won a World Cup four times
and ironically lost to Uruguay 2-1 in 1950, the only year the country
ever hosted the finals.

Japan, S. Korea back World Cup co-hosting+

ZURICH, Switzerland, June 1 Kyodo

     Japan and South Korea have unconditionally accepted FIFA's
decision to award the 2002 World Cup finals to the two nations amid
hopes that the tournament will break new ground in World Cup history,
Japanese soccer officials say.
     ''We believe a new age has arrived, one in which we will be able
to stage the World Cup finals with South Korea,'' said Shunichiro
Okano, vice president of the Football Association of Japan (JFA), on
the FIFA executive committee's vote Friday.
     JFA President Ken Naganuma said neither Japan nor South Korea
made any conditions when the 21-member FIFA committee took the
unprecedented move in an unanimous vote.
     FIFA's current rules forbid the World Cup from being staged in
more than one nation, apparently out of concern of having to face
momentous problems on how to divvy the matches, revenues and other
organizational work.
     Okano, speaking to reporters after the FIFA vote, said Japan
hopes to avoid a sharp cut in the number of Japanese venues for the
World Cup but conceded that any action will depend on a FIFA task
force report due by December.
     ''We will certainly state our position (to FIFA),'' Okano said.
     The 2002 World Cup finals will be contested by 32 nations, with
a total of 64 matches scheduled to be played throughout the
tournament.
     Okano also gave an outline of the events leading to Japan's
turnaround in its decision to change its all-or-nothing stance for
the bid.
     He said the Japanese delegation received on the eve of the FIFA
executive board meeting a letter from FIFA Secretary General Sepp
Blatter noting that South Korea had offered to consider joint hosting
if the move is endorsed by FIFA.
     Blatter asked what Japan's position would be.
     The Japanese delegation, joined by former Japanese Prime
Minister Kiichi Miyazawa, leader of a Japanese Diet lobbying group
for the World Cup, met for close to two and half hours and decided to
go along.
     The Japanese response was then put in writing and Okano was
dispatched to deliver the letter to the FIFA headquarters Friday
morning.
     ''I personally thought we could have won at the ballot.  But we
thought it would be bad policy to ignore (Blatter's) letter since we
didn't know how the FIFA executive board would react,'' Okano said of
Japan's reversal of its position.
     Saburo Kawabuchi, deputy chairman of the Japanese bid committee
and chairman of the Japanese professional soccer J.League, said he
would have liked to see FIFA award the 2002 World Cup finals to one
country alone.
     ''It would much easier to understand if there are only winners
and losers, as in the J.League.  But then, draw matches are allowed
in the advanced soccer countries, and we can't help that,'' he said.

Terasawa takes 2nd-round lead in Mitsubishi Denki Ladies+

KOBE, June 1 Kyodo

     Norimi Terasawa shot a 3-under-par 70 Saturday, equaling the
day's best score to take a three-stroke lead after the second round
of the 50 million yen Mitsubishi Denki Ladies tournament.
     Terasawa carded a lone bogey on the par-5 first hole before
rolling in four birdies for a two-day total 139 on the 6,263-yard,
par-73 course at Kitarokko Country Club in suburban Kobe.
     ''I think victory will come to me tomorrow if I play the same as
I have yesterday and today,'' Terasawa said.  ''A 2-under-par round
will be enough for me to win.''
     The 36-year-old veteran, who narrowly obtained this year's seed
by finishing in 50th place in last year's money rankings, has won two
Japan LPGA events but has been winless since capturing the 1991 Fuji
Sankei Ladies title.
     Cheng Mei-chi of Taiwan, who matched the second-round best with
her own 70, and Yuka Shiroto are tied in second place at 142.
     Mayumi Murai and Akiko Fukushima are another shot back.
     Overnight leader Wu Ming-yeh of Taiwan carded a 78 for a total
146, seven strokes off the pace.
     A field of 53 players survived the cut at 151 in the 54-hole
event.  The winner Sunday will take home 9 million yen.

Okano takes JCB Classic lead, but looking out for Ozaki+

SHIBATA, Japan, June 1 Kyodo

     Unheralded Masayuki Okano heads into Sunday's final round at the
JCB Classic Sendai tournament with a one-stroke lead, but his hopes
for a first tour title are overshadowed by hard-charging Masahi
''Jumbo'' Ozaki.
     Okano, a 34-year-old pro in only his fifth year on the Japan PGA
tour, shot a 68 with five birdies and two bogeys Saturday for a
three-day total of 204 on the par-71 Omotezao Kokusai Golf Club
course in Miyagi Prefecture.
     ''I can't believe I will be part of the final group in the final
round.  I'm afraid my legs will be shaking tomorrow,'' said Okano,
whose official earnings totaled only 400,000 yen through last year.
     Ozaki, who has already won three tour events this year including
last week's Mitsubishi Galant in a playoff, and Hideyuki Sato each
shot a 67 to equal the day's best score and stand one shot behind
Okano.
     Defending champion and overnight leader Ryoken Kawagishi is two
strokes further back in fourth at 207, followed by Hidemichi Tanaka
and Nobuo Serizawa who share fifth place at 208.
     The winner will pocket 18 million yen Sunday in the 72-hole, 100
million yen tournament.

Japan's World Cup 'virtual stadium' left in the air+

TOKYO, June 1 Kyodo

     Japanese bidders for the 2002 World Cup left the highly touted
''virtual stadium'' virtually up in the air Saturday, a day after
FIFA decided to split the World Cup finals between Japan and South
Korea.
     A senior official of the Japanese bid committee said the fate of
the proposed virtual stadium will hinge on the report from a newly
created FIFA working group in charge of looking into the implications
of the co-hosting decision.
     ''We won't know anything until we find out what the FIFA working
group is up to,'' said Morimasa Kondo, deputy director of the
Japanese 2002 World Cup bidding committee.
     Japan offered the so-called virtual stadium -- essentially a
huge screen to carry high-definition three-dimensional television
images of matches in other venues -- as a major feature of its bid
for the 2002 World Cup finals.
     Japanese bid committee officials argued that the virtual stadium
would enable more fee-paying fans to go out and watch World Cup
matches and promised to channel World Cup proceeds into a trust fund
for the benefit of international soccer.
     The co-hosting decision by FIFA's 21-member executive committee
Friday means Japan will get only a portion of the 64 matches
scheduled to be played during the tournament.
     Kondo said he has no idea how many Japanese cities will lose
their bids to become host venues because of the co-hosting decision.
     ''It is entirely a blank piece of paper,'' he said but noted
that Japanese World Cup organizers intend to utilize as many of the
bidding cities as possible.
     A total of 15 Japanese cities have offered to be venues for
World Cup matches, and 16 South Korean cities are also looking for a
piece of the World Cup action.

Japan, S. Korea to meet in World Cup final?

TOKYO, June 1 Kyodo

     If Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto and President Kim Young Sam
had their wish, Japan and South Korea would meet in the final of the
2002 soccer World Cup finals.
     Pipe dream?
     Not really, said Kim in a telephone chat with the Japanese prime
minister Saturday.
     ''The power of Japanese and Korean soccer has gone up
considerably and it is not impossible (for the two countries to meet
in the final),'' Kim was quoted as telling Hashimoto.
     Japanese officials said Kim placed the phone call to Hashimoto
Saturday afternoon, a day after FIFA awarded the 2002 World Cup
jointly to the two countries.
     After the two leaders pledged full cooperation from their
governments to make the unprecedented co-hosting a success, Hashimoto
raised the possibility for a World Cup final between the two
countries, Japanese officials said.
     ''If our teams can meet in the final, it would be nice,''
Hashimoto was quoted as telling Kim.
     Japan, which has never qualified for the World Cup finals, will
receive an automatic berth this time as a host.  South Korea has
qualified four times but has never gone beyond the first round.

Cuba loses to Mitsubishi in baseball friendly closer+

TOKYO, June 1 Kyodo

     Mitsubishi Motor's Kawasaki baseball team upended Barcelona
Olympic champion Cuba 7-6 in the final game of the Baseball Week in
Japan series Saturday.
     The Cuban amateur squad finished the exhibition with five wins,
three losses and one tie in playing Japan's national team plus a host
of Japanese corporate and minor league pro ballclubs.
     Cuba rallied for three runs on RBI hits by Luis Ulacia and Migel
Caldes to knot the score 5-5 in the fifth, but reliever Omar Ajete
gave up a two-run homer in the bottom of the same inning.
     The Cubans scored another run in the sixth to make it 7-6 but
came up short of extra firepower in losing the game at Tokyo's Ota
stadium.
     Cuba and Japan will compete in the eight-nation Olympic
tournament in this summer's Atlanta Centennial Games.

Chung calls for new int'l club competition in Far East+

ZURICH, Switzerland, June 1 Kyodo

     South Korean soccer chief Chung Mong Joon on Saturday proposed a
new international soccer competition among the club champions of
China, Japan, North Korea and South Korea.
     Chung, also a vice president of the world soccer governing body
FIFA, said the proposed Far Eastern version of the European Champions
Cup will help boost the sport's popularity in the region.
     Chung also called for a resumption later this year of regular
international friendlies between Japan and South Korea, which have
been suspended since the last match took place in Nagasaki in July
1991.
     He unveiled an idea of such bilateral friendlies being held in
Seoul in October and in Japan in December this year.
     Chung's proposals came after the FIFA executive committee
decided to allow Japan and South Korea to co-host the 2002 World Cup
finals.

TOKYO, June 1 Kyodo

     Osaka will bid to host the 1999 rhythmic gymnastics world
championships, Japanese gymnastics officials said Saturday.
     The Japan Gymnastics Association decided on a domestic candidate
venue at an executive committee meeting held the same day.
     The site of the 1999 championships, which will also serve as the
qualifier for the 2000 Sydney Olympics, will be decided at the
general assembly of world gymnastics body FIG this July in Atlanta.
     Osaka, Japan's second largest city, has announced it will make a
bid to host the 2008 Olympics.

S. Korea to propose extension of no-visa visit to Japan+

SEOUL, June 1 Kyodo

     South Korea will propose to Japan that the two countries extend
the period of stay without visa in anticipation of travel growth
ahead of and during World Cup soccer competition in 2002, Yonhap News
Agency reported Saturday.
     Soccer's biggest event will be co-hosted by South Korea and
Japan, according to a decision made by the world soccer governing
body FIFA on Friday.
     The proposal calls for both countries to extend the period of
stay without visa to three months by 2002, the news agency said.
     Under the existing procedures, Japanese tourists are allowed to
stay in South Korea for a maximum of 15 days without visas.  But
South Korean tourists must obtain visas under Japan's present
immigration law unless they are on transit to a third country.  On
transit, they may stay in Japan up to three days.

News focus on problems of World-Cup co-hosting+

TOKYO, June 1 Kyodo

     By awarding the 2002 World Cup finals jointly to Japan and South
Korea, FIFA has stepped into unknown territory, raising more problems
than it has set out to resolve.
     FIFA chief Joao Havelange said FIFA will create a working group
to look into the matter and the following are some of the issues that
must be addressed in its report due back to FIFA by December.
     Logistics.
     Organizers in Japan and South Korea, two countries with
different communications and transport systems, immigration controls
and security apparatuses, must work things out to ensure the free
movement of millions of fans and to cope with an invasion of national
supporters for the 32 nations to contest the tournament.
     Take visa requirements, for instance.
     South Koreans coming to Japan must obtain a visa under Japan's
current immigration law unless they are on transit to a third
country.  For transit proposes, Korean visitors may stay in Japan for
up to three days.
     On the other hand, Japanese traveling to South Korea are exempt
from a visa if their stay in the country as a tourist is less than 15
days.
     World Cup operation.
     Operation of the World Cup tournament itself, some World Cup
experts say, is the easy part.
     One solution to co-hosting, these experts suggest, is to split
the World Cup down the middle, letting 16 nations compete in Japan
and the remaining 16 in South Korea.
     The idea does not sound totally absurd.
     Actually, only 16 nations had been allowed to compete the World
Cup finals until the tournament held in Argentina in 1978.
     Between the 1982 World Cup held in Spain and the last World Cup
held in the United States in 1994, there were 24 nations.
     And starting from the 1998 World Cup in France, the tournament
will feature 32 national teams.
     If the 2002 World Cup is split down the middle, the 16 teams can
be divided into four teams of round-robin play and the two top teams
in each group would advance to the final in each country.
     The South Korea champion would meet the Japan champion to decide
the final World Cup champion.
     This split-down-the-center formula would eliminate the necessity
for the national team supporters -- and their teams -- to crisscross
between the two countries during the tournament.
     One hiccup, of course, is whether Japan or South Korea will get
to be the defending World Cup champion in 2002, which will be decided
in the 1998 World Cup.
     Also, where will Brazil, the only four-time World Cup champion,
play?  Japan?  South Korea?
     The final.
     Under current FIFA rules, the World Cup final is decided by a
single match.
     There are already suggestions that FIFA should adopt the
two-match ''home-and-away'' formula used in Europe's UEFA Cup,
organizing the first leg of the two-match final, say, in Japan and
the second leg in South Korea.
     The home-and-away formula, proponents suggest, would
substantially boost revenues for the World Cup organizers not only
from entrance tickets but also from TV broadcasting rights.
     Opening ceremony.
     Diplomatic protocols could create a headache in organizing the
opening ceremony, which is traditionally attended by the host
nation's head of state.
     If South Korea gets the opening ceremony, will Emperor Akihito,
who serves as Japan's head of state, travel there and become the
first Japanese monarch to visit the former Japanese colony and risk a
backlash from the Koreans, many of whom still harbor bitter memories
of Japan's 35-year colonial rule?
     The list of issues does not end there.  Dividing sponsorship
money, TV broadcasting rights, fees and other sources of marketing
revenues will require leadership from FIFA.
     For their part, the political leaders in Japan and South Korea
vowed Saturday that they will cooperate for the success of the 2002
World Cup and turn the tournament into an ''example to the world.''

Winless Kyoto grabs draw in J.League Cup opener+

TOKYO, June 1 Kyodo

     Kyoto Purple Sanga, following a record 15 consecutive losses in
the first half of J.League play, opened the J.League Cup with a 1-1
draw against Bellmare Hiratsuka on Saturday.
     Ruy Ramos, playing as a forward, injected dynamism into Kyoto's
attack in the first half and the strategy paid off with a 33rd minute
strike by new Brazilian midfielder Raudnei.
     Koji Seki, however, picked up a poor Kyoto clearance and scored
the equalizer in the 64th minute.
     ''The team has changed incredibly,'' said Ramos, a former Verdy
Kawasaki midfielder.  ''But change alone is not enough.  If there are
no results...'' He left the sentence unfinished.
     The two clubs will travel to Hiratsuka stadium Wednesday for
their second-leg match.  The side with more goals on aggregate will
earn three points.
     The 16 clubs are divided into two groups and will conduct seven
preliminary rounds on a home-and-away basis through Aug. 21.
     The top two sides in both groups will play in the Sept. 4
semifinals, followed by the final Sept. 25.
     Kashiwa outclassed host Urawa Red Diamonds 3-1 while Gamba Osaka
staged a 3-2 away win over reigning J.League champion Yokohama
Marinos.  Emperor's Cup holder Nagoya Grampus Eight salvaged a 1-1
draw against visiting Yokohama Flugels.
     Shimizu S-Pulse claimed a 1-0 victory over Kashima Antlers, as
did Sanfrecce Hiroshima over Jubilo Iwata, Avispa Fukuoka over JEF
United Ichihara, and Kawasaki over Cerezo Osaka.
     League play, which ended after the 15th round of matches May 18,
resumes Aug. 28.

Korean FIFA exec believes W-Cup co-host is trouble-free+

ZURICH, Switzerland, June 1 Kyodo

     South Korean soccer chief Chung Mong Joon, the reputed
mastermind behind FIFA's decision to split the 2002 World Cup finals
between Japan and South Korea, said Saturday the two countries should
be able to co-stage the tournament without much fuss.
     ''There is no major problem toward co-hosting.  (Even if there
is), it can be settled through sportsmanship,'' Chung said in an
interview with Kyodo News.
     Chung, who serves as one of the eight vice presidents in the
21-member FIFA executive committee, also said he believes that joint
hosting will help boost mutual understanding between Japanese and
South Koreans.
     Chung said he is sorry to see that the 2002 Cup was not awarded
to a single nation, but added, ''I believe joint hosting has merits
that you don't see in unilateral hosting.''
     ''Not only Korean-Japanese relations, I hope the 2002 World Cup,
the first in Asia, will turn into a festival to foster peace and
prosperity in Northeast Asia,'' he said.
     Chung said, however, he does not expect the World Cup alone will
do away with all historical animosities between the two countries.
     ''Sports alone cannot resolve all these problems.  Historical
fact is historical fact,'' he said.
     Chung said he believes South Koreans and Japanese should be able
to get to know more about each other through the 2002 World Cup and
open up a new page in bilateral ties in the 21st century.

Japan, Netherlands, Ukraine get v'ball Olympic berths+

OSAKA, June 1 Kyodo

     Japan, the Netherlands and Ukraine earned women's volleyball
berths in this summer's Atlanta Olympics on Saturday by securing the
top three spots in the final qualifying tournament.
     Japan overwhelmed Croatia 15-10, 15-4, 15-1, the Netherlands
beat Bulgaria 15-7, 15-9, 15-6 and Ukraine defeated Italy 15-8, 15-8,
15-6 in the eight-nation round robin at Osaka Municipal Central
Gymnasium.
     Japan, the Netherlands and Ukraine have identical 5-1 records.
     Croatia stands at 4-2 while Italy and Bulgaria are 2-4.
     Japanese women qualified for the Olympics for the ninth straight
times since volleyball became the Olympic event in 1964, winning the
gold medals in 1964 and 1976.
     ''By qualifying for the Olympics, we've moved one step toward
reaching my dream.  The next step is to get a medal in Atlanta,''
said ace spiker Tomoko Yoshihara.
     Romania downed Taiwan 16-17, 15-8, 15-9, 15-12 to pick up its
first victory in the tournament and Taiwan is winless.
     Japanese men, the Olympic gold medalists in 1972, failed to
qualify for the Atlanta Games.

Yomiuri rallies past Chunichi, drops Dragons from first+

TOKYO, June 1 Kyodo

     Daisuke Motoki hit a bases-loaded triple with two out in the
eighth inning Saturday to spark the Yomiuri Giants to a 6-3 win at
the Tokyo Dome and drop the Chunichi Dragons from first place in the
Central League.
     With the Giants trailing 3-2 in the eighth, Motoki looped a
slider from reliever Sun Dong Yol over the head of rightfielder
Shigeki Oto, clearing the bases, and then came home on a single by
Kosuke Yoshihara.
     Sun from South Korea, 1-1, absorbed the loss for the Dragons,
which fell one game behind the victorious Hiroshima Carp, while Mario
Brito struck out the side in the Chunichi ninth for his sixth save.
     Chunichi roughed up Giants starter Balvino Galvez for three runs
on three hits in the first inning, but managed only one more hit the
remaining eight.
     At Chiba Marine Stadium, the Yakult Swallows eased past the
Hanshin Tigers 9-0 on a pair of two-run homers by Hensley Meulens and
Tom O'Malley and Tatsuki Yamamoto's four-hit pitching.
     In an afternoon contest, pinch hitter Itsuki Asai arched a solo
homer inside the leftfield foul pole in the top of the 10th inning to
lift the Carp over the host Yokohama BayStars 3-2.
     Asai's four-bagger saddled Yokohama starter Takashi Saito, 4-3,
with the loss despite a 12-strikeout performance while giving
Hiroshima sole possession of first place in league.
     In the Pacific League, Hiroshi Shibakusa, 4-1, scattered five
hits over eight innings, and the front-running Nippon Ham Fighters
downed the last place Daiei Hawks 5-1 at the Fukuoka Dome.
     The Kintetsu Buffaloes overcame five-run deficits twice to claim
an 12-9 victory over the homestanding Seibu Lions in a game  that
included 21 walks and two batters hit by pitches on both sides.
     Norihiro Nakamura wielded the big bat for the Buffaloes, going
4-for-5 with a walk and his 11th homer of the season.
     In Kobe, the Chiba Lotte Marines pounced on Orix starter Hiroshi
Kobayashi, 3-5, for seven hits and four runs early and held on for a
6-3 win over the BlueWave at Green Stadium Kobe.

TOKYO, June 1 Kyodo

     -- U.S. President Bill Clinton formally extended China's

calling it ''the best way'' to advance U.S. economic and security
interests in Asia under his ''engagement'' policy toward Beijing.
     -- Stocks are expected to continue mixed in Tokyo next week, as
shares are expected to be sandwiched between selling on rallies and
bargain hunting by public funds and investment trusts.
     -- The U.S. dollar is likely to hold firm against the yen in
Tokyo next week under the ongoing influence of Friday's comments by
Japan's top cabinet spokesman in favor of continued low domestic
