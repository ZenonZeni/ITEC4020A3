<H2><I>D. </I>Federal Initiatives Continue to Spur Efficiency Successes</H2>

<BR>
Federal and state support for efficiency programs has been critical to the 
success of programs nationwide. According to the Congressional Research 
Service, the federal government has spent a total of $5.7 billion on 
energy-efficiency research and development since 1973. Technologies 
advanced by these efforts have saved American homeowners and businesses 
$226 billion, and will save billions more over the life cycle of the 
efficiency <BR>
improvements.<a href="#112" name="r112"> [ 112 ] </a>Several of the federal program success stories are 
reviewed below.<BR>
<BR>
 <p>     <B><I>U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and U.S. Department of 
Energy "Climate Wise" Program.</B></I> Administered jointly by the EPA and 
DOE, the Climate Wise program is a voluntary program that works with 
businesses (with a focus on manufacturing firms) to install cost-effective 
energy efficiency and pollution prevention strategies. Climate Wise 
participants currently represent almost 4 percent of U.S. industrial 
energy use. <BR>
<p>    <p>      By joining Climate Wise, businesses agree to initiate, expand, 
or accelerate a set of cost-effective measures to improve efficiency, 
including (1) improving equipment and manufacturing process efficiencies, 
(2) utilizing fuel switching and improved management practices, (3) 
integrating efficiency into new product design and manufacturing, and (4) 
participation in other federal voluntary programs, such as Green Lights 
(to install efficient lighting), Motor Challenge (to improve motor 
efficiencies), Waste Wi$e (to integrate waste reduction strategies), and 
NICE3 (to demonstrate energy-efficient, pollution-preventing 
technologies). Companies that have initiated Climate Wise programs have 
achieved significant economic and environmental benefits. By the year 
2000, current Climate Wise companies expect to save more than $80 million 
annually.<BR>
<p>    <p>      In return for their participation, Climate Wise companies 
receive technical assistance from federal agencies and national 
laboratories, utilities, trade associations, and state and local energy, 
pollution prevention, and economic development offices. 
Business-to-business exchange workshops facilitate replication of 
successful efficiency models. Financial assistance can be arranged through 
guaranteed loans, low-interest buy-downs from state providers, state tax 
credits, utility programs, and private-sector financing opportunities. 
Climate Wise "showcases" projects and businesses that demonstrate 
significant greenhouse gas emissions reductions, and sponsors media 
events, awards programs, and other promotional activities.<a href="#113" name="r113"> [ 113 ] </a>
<B><p>     <I><A NAME="Dupont">Dupont<a>,</B></I> headquartered in Wilmington, Delaware, has 
installed energy-efficiency improvements through the Climate Wise Program 
that are currently saving $31 million annually. Dupont estimates that 
further energy-efficiency improvements, including fuel switching, improved 
steam balance and waste heat reductions, will reduce carbon dioxide 
emissions by 18 million metric tons annually by the year 2000 from 1990 
emission levels.<a href="#114" name="r114"> [ 114 ] </a>
<B><p>     <I><A NAME="AT&T">AT&T</a>,</B></I> in Basking Ridge, New Jersey, is installing 
efficiency improvements through the Climate Wise program projected to save 
the company $50 million each year and offset 154,000 metric tons of carbon 
dioxide annually by the year 2000.<a href="#115" name="r115"> [ 115 ] </a>
<BR>
<B><I> <p>     U.S. Department of Energy "Climate Challenge" 
Program</B>.</I> The United States was one of 154 nations and the European 
Community to sign the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate 
Change (FCCC) in Rio de Janeiro in 1992.<a href="#116" name="r116"> [ 116 ] </a>Domestic implementation of the 
U.S. commitment - which is to reduce U.S. greenhouse-gas emissions to 
1990 levels by the year 2000 - follows mostly voluntary measures set 
forth in President Clinton's Climate Change Action Plan. The plan, issued 
in October 1993, seeks 108 million metric tons of carbon dioxide 
reductions and calls on electric utilities to provide much of those 
reductions.<a href="#117" name="r117"> [ 117 ] </a>
<p>    <p>      Climate Challenge is the primary element of the plan that 
directly involves electric utilities. As of March 1995, 79 utilities, 
representing more than half of U.S. electricity generation, had signed 
agreements with DOE to participate in Climate Challenge, pledging to 
reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 41 million metric tons by the year 
2000. DSM programs account for 18 percent of the reductions planned in 
Climate Challenge.<a href="#118" name="r118"> [ 118 ] </a>
<P>
<BR>
<B><I> <p>     Federal Energy Management Program (FEMP).</B></I> As the 
world's largest consumer of goods and services, the federal government has 
a major impact on the marketplace. Energy consumption by the federal 
government can be reduced substantially through energy-efficiency 
measures. FEMP coordinates the reduction effort. If all agencies 
implemented the FEMP requirements of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPAct) 
and Executive Order 12902,<a href="#119" name="r119"> [ 119 ] </a>the agencies would save as much as $400 
million annually by 2000 and $1 billion annually by 2005.<a href="#120" name="r120"> [ 120 ] </a>FEMP has 
successfully cut net energy consumption by 20 percent in four federal 
agencies (Energy, Interior, Justice, and the Federal Emergency Management 
Agency), and by 10 percent in six more (Agriculture, Defense, 
Transportation, Veterans Affairs, General Services Administration, and 
NASA). One of FEMP's strengths is its ability to attract outside resources 
to aid in the task of saving energy; the program leverages about $3 in 
savings for every dollar of taxpayer expenditures.<a href="#121" name="r121"> [ 121 ] </a>FEMP's efforts have 
cut the equivalent of 3 million metric tons of carbon dioxide 
emissions.<a href="#122" name="r122"> [ 122 ] </a>
<B><I> <p>     U.S. Department of Energy "Weatherization Assistance 
Program</B>.<B>"</B></I> The DOE's Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP) 
provides, through state energy offices, grants to community-based service 
providers for weatherization of low-income family residences, particularly 
those housing children, the elderly, and disabled family members. Since 
its inception in 1976, WAP has lowered the energy costs of more than 4.4 
million homes, saving the equivalent of 12 million barrels of oil. A 
typical family served by the program has an annual income of $7,641, and 
as a result of the program, saved 18.2 percent off their annual heating 
costs. State and local agencies have leveraged more than $200 million each 
year to increase the number of assisted homes to about 225,000 annually. 
In fiscal year 1996, WAP is slated to weatherize an additional 116,145 
homes. A 1990 <A NAME="OakRidgeNationalLaboratory">Oak Ridge National Laboratory.<a> study determined that for 
every dollar invested by DOE in WAP, $1.72 in energy savings results. WAP 
is also responsible for substantial job creation - 52 jobs for every $1 
million of federal funds invested, plus another 22 indirect jobs.<a href="#123" name="r123"> [ 123 ] </a>
<BR>
<B><I> <p>     State Energy Conservation Program</B>.</I> The 
federally-supported State Energy Conservation Program (SECP) provides the 
resources for many of the services provided by state energy offices. SECP 
funds are used nationwide for energy training, waste minimization, 
recycling, home energy rating systems, computerized bus routings to save 
energy, energy emergency planning, promotion of natural gas vehicles, and 
many other activities. Many states use SECP funds to provide technical 
assistance to businesses and industries for reducing their energy 
consumption, thus reducing associated costs.<a href="#124" name="r124"> [ 124 ] </a>
<B><I> <p>     Institutional Conservation Program</B>.</I> The 
Institutional Conservation Program (ICP) provides matching funds and 
technical assistance to schools and hospitals for energy-saving capital 
improvements for buildings, equipment, mechanical systems, and controls. 
Approximately 65,000 buildings - 22 percent of all eligible structures 
in the country - have had energy improvements through ICP. DOE 
estimates the cumulative energy cost savings directly attributable to 
ICP-supported retrofits totaled $4.1 billion through 1991. The ICP 
typically provides 50 percent of the efficiency investment costs, which 
are matched either by state or private sources. The average project takes 
three years to generate a positive cash flow from energy savings, but the 
annual return on investment is then greater than 33 percent. In addition, 
the projects generate substantial employment opportunities in the 
construction industry.<BR>
<p>     <BR>
These federal energy-efficiency programs make it possible for numerous 
state and local agencies to provide the technical and financial capacity 
for residential, commercial and industrial DSM programs. The nationwide 
efficiency effort has reduced national energy use; if the United States 
were still consuming energy as intensively as it did in 1973, it would 
have consumed approximately 116 quads in 1992 instead of the 85.5 quads 
actually consumed. This reduction in energy use represents a savings in 
energy costs to the American consumer of approximately $170 billion.<a href="#125" name="r125"> [ 125 ] </a>
Federal energy-efficiency investments have been critical - and 
successful. Still greater financial and environmental gains could result 
from far-sighted national policies that bolster energy-efficiency and DSM 
budgets.<P>
