<A NAME="moss"><H3>Controlling Moss</H3>
<P>For many of our customers who live in more humid regions, like the Pacific Northwest, moss can be a particular problem in the lawn. Controlling moss is relatively simple, but may require some changes in the garden.</P>
<P>Generally moss is favored by thin lawns (see our hints on lawn care), poor drainage, shade, and acid soil conditions. To get existing moss problems under control you can use existing commercial formulations or use Whitney Farms Iron Sulfate. Broadcast it over the mossy areas according to the rates on the label, or dissolve three ounces of Iron Sulfate in five gallons of water to treat 1000 sq. ft. The treated moss will turn black and can be raked out of the lawn. Overseed thin areas if needed.</P>
<P>Unless steps are taken to correct the conditions that favored the moss you will soon have moss again. If necessary, prune or trim trees and shrubs to increase light and air flow to the area. Aerate the lawn to correct compaction; improve the soil drainage if needed. Use shade tolerate varieties of turf grass in shady areas. Reduce frequency of irrigation. Avoid over-fertilization with soluble forms of nitrogen. Increase mowing height to around three inches and mow as frequently as is required to remove less that 1/3 of the blade length at each cutting.</P>

<A NAME="more"><H3>Still More on Planting Trees...</H3><BR>
<H4>or a reader stakes his reputation on correcting one of our oversights</H4>
<P>We recently received a letter from a reader in Illinois reminding us of an omission in our tree planting instructions in our premier issue.  Mr. Tom Vorbeck wrote to remind us that there are instances when stakes are absolutely indispensable‹planting fruit trees on dwarfing rootstocks, particularly apples on M7, M7A, and EMLA-7 rootstocks.  Mr. Vorbeck has a great deal of experience with these trees and reminds us that they require staking to withstand windstorms particularly when they are young and soils are wet.  Along with the M7 rootstock and it's relatives, apples planted on M26, M9, Mark and EMLA 27 must be staked at planting as well. </P>
<IMG SRC="BBQ.gif" ALIGN=right>
<P>Mr. Vorbeck included in his letter an article he had just written for an apple grower's newsletter in which he makes the following recommendations, "You can plant a
2" x 2" x 8' pole with the tree at planting time."  He warns that whatever you use should be a minimum of 2" x 2" and should be of a material that will last up to three years in the soil.  "Lesser quality stakes," he continues, "will keep the tree from getting loose in the ground.  But lesser quality stakes will increase the risk of catastrophe in years four and five in which the winds snap off the stakes and the tree at its bud union." </P>
<P>He notes that a number of varieties in his orchard have "been nearly immune" to getting loose on M7.  Specifically he notes Jonagold, Mutsu, and Spigold.  He warns that all of his Blushing Goldens on M7 got loose.  He also observes that trees planted in soil that had been tilled for crops the previous season stayed better anchored than trees planted into sod.  The good news is that trees planted with a stake "grow taller and bear younger." </P>
<P>The editors of The Dirt encourage readers to stake loosely to allow some movement so that the trunk and root systems are encouraged to develop through the natural swaying motion of the tree.
In most cases trees on M7 and its relatives will only require staking for the first three to five years.  Trees on M26 and Mark will require staking the first 5 to 8 years.  Trees planted on M27 and M9 rootstocks will require staking for their entire lives and are ideally suited for use as espaliers or in a cordon systems because of this. </P>
<P>It had been our intention to include a caution in the original article.  Due to the pressures of our first deadlines it was unfortunately omitted.  We are grateful to Mr. Vorbeck for bringing our omission to our attention.</P>
