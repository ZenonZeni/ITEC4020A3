A Push for Surveillance Software (fwd) <p>

Here are some choice excerpts from the headline
article of the NY Times Business section, 2/28. <p>

A Push for Surveillance Software <p>

by John Markoff <p>

In the age of computer communications and digital telephone
calls, the American people must be willing to give up a degree of
personal privacy in exchange for safety and security, the head of
the Federal Bureau of Investigation said. <p>

In an interview on Friday, Louis J. Freeh (note: is it really
pronounced Free?), the FBI director, defended proposed legislation
that critics say would turn the nation's telephone network into
a vast surveillance system. He said taxpayers would be asked to
pay up to half a billion dollars to develop and deploy the
necessary network software. <p>

The administration wants to impose new technology that
would enable law-enforcement agents to gather a wealth of personal
information by monitoring citizens' calling patterns and credit
card transactions over the telephone network - and over the
two-way cable television networks being planned by cable and
phone companies. The system would go well beyond current wire-
tapping technology, because much of the information could be
gleaned without the police or FBI actually having to eavesdrop
on specific voice or electronic-mail conversations. <p>

"The costs are high, but you have to do a cost-benefit
analysis," said Mr. Freeh, who insisted that fighting terrorists
and criminals was the governments intention - not playing
Big Brother to the citizenry. <p>

... <p>

The administration is trying to line up congressional
support for the legislation, called Digital Telephony and
Communications Privacy Improvement Act of 1994, before having it
formally introduced. <p>

... <p>

There's much more but I don't have a scanner handy. I
can't believe how quickly this appalling threat has developed.
The government always veils its expansion of powers as a need
for increased security: the War on Drugs, criminals, terrorists.
What I'm really surprised by is that they foresee the endpoint
of freely available information technology, a diminishing need
for centralized government. <p>

If the net contributes to the end of centralized control,
it's easy to extrapolate who the target terrorists are going
to be. <p>
