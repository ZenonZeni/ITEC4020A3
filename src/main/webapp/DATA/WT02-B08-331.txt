<H1>Oceanic Kelvin & Rossby Waves:
<br>
April through December, 1993</H1>

<h3>
<p> 
The colors indicate Pacific Ocean sea level variations -- white and red indicate higher than average levels; purple and magenta show lower than average levels.  Black circles show how the sea surface moves east in a Kelvin wave group in April, then west with Rossby waves during July and December.

<p>
In the April image, the two small black circles off the coast of the Americas correspond to sea-level highs on the trailing edge of Kelvin waves moving east. The leading edge of this wave group has already "bounced off" the coastline, creating Rossby waves whose rising and falling sea levels are marked by solid and dashed lines, respectively.

<p>
In the July and December images, the circles are moving west with the Rossby waves. The "X" in the July image marks a sea level low caused by a Kelvin wave moving east. The shapes of the solid and dashed lines indicate that the Rossby waves are moving away from the Americas more quickly at the equator than at higher latitudes.

<p>
For the first time scientists can track Kelvin and Rossby waves as they move through the open ocean.  They have discovered that, at middle latitudes, Rossby waves move 2 - 3 times faster than previously thought.  This may help forecasters improve their ability to predict the effects of El Nino events on weather patterns years in advance.
