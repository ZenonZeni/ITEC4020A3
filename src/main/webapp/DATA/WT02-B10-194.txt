<p><b>Where Can I Get Help?</b> </p>
<p>If you meet <a href="diagAnor.htm">the diagnostic criteria for anorexia nervosa</a> or <a href="diagBuli.htm">the criteria for bulimia nervosa</a> 
you may be eligible to receive <strong>free </strong><b>treatment</b> as part of the research program at the 
Eating Disorders Unit at the New York State Psychiatric Institute, located at the Columbia 
Presbyterian Medical Center in New York City. The Eating Disorders Unit is a nationally 
recognized treatment/research program which provides both inpatient and outpatient 
treatment. The clinic is staffed by psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers, nurses, and 
research personnel, all with training and experience in the treatment of eating disorders. 
The purpose of the clinic is to study bulimia nervosa and anorexia nervosa and to find 
more effective treatments for each. Since ours is a research program, we offer free 
treatment to women with moderate to severe eating disorders who are appropriate for our 
current research and treatment studies. The Eating Disorders Unit receives support from 
private grants and from the federal and state governments.</p>
<p><b>How Do I Get More Information?</b> </p>
<p>If you would like further information, to make a referral, or to apply to the program, 
please contact us at the Eating Disorders Clinic. When you call you will be given a more 
detailed description of the program and asked a series of questions. A personal interview 
is then scheduled, to determine eligibility for participation and to provide additional 
information. You can reach us weekdays from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. E.S.T. at 212-960-5746 or
