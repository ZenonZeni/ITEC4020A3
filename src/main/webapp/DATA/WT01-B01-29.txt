!!!!! HOW TO PREVENT A MASSIVE NUCLEAR WAR--LESSONS OF THE COLD WAR !!!!!

PREFACE
   The enclosed paper is VERY important because it reminds people of the 
horrors of the many Cold War confrontations between the superpowers, 
and tells them what was NOT known by the public at the time, that nearly 
all these Crises were NUCLEAR. It now seems likely that the Comprehensive
Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) will be signed soon, but the USA (and other nuclear 
powers, who have however far less capability for using their weapons to 
intimidate their opponents, as the USA has done repeatedly) clearly intends 
to keep its nuclear arsenal  for the indefinite future.  They have several 
"sub-critical tests" planned  for this year, and computer simulation 
experiments must surely be in progress already, since they are of course 
not detectable, and presumably are funded from a "black budget".

   Thus the public will be lulled into a feeling of false security. History
repeats itself, since we all know now that this is what happened after the 
Limited Test Ban Treaty in 1963.  I believe the only way to avert this 
danger, short of waiting for the actual use of nuclear weapons (which is 
inevitable under the proposed regime, but even that may be by a "terrorist 
nation" or the mafia, thus justifying the continued possession by the nuclear 
powers), is to remind people of what they had almost forgotten (or like me
and most ordinary people never really knew):

!!!THE WORLD WAS OFTEN AT RISK OF A NUCLEAR HOLOCAUST DURING THE COLD WAR!!!

   A public thus aroused by knowing the terrible risks that have been taken 
in the recent past, and one hopes empowered by a forthcoming favourable
World Court judgement that the possesession as well as use of nuclear 
weapons is illegal, might prevent catastrophe--as they did in 1969 (see 
below Nixon's statement of 14 October 1969, VIETNAM Crisis #12).

INTRODUCTION                          
  During the 39 years of the Cold War, the United States of America led 
the nuclear arms race, repeatedly threatened to use nuclear weapons, and 
brought civilization to the brink of destruction on several occasions.  
This is an appalling record, but there is no reason to believe that any 
other great power having the same advantages as the U.S.A. would have acted 
any better.  The human race is ill-equipped to deal with nuclear weapons. 
  The Cold War and the Soviet nuclear threat to the U.S.A. was ended by 
Mikhail Gorbachev.  It is now widely believed, however, that the U.S.A. 
"won the Cold War."  The very dangerous crises of the Cold War, their 
threats distorted by propaganda at the time, are now almost totally forgotten.  The role of the military establishment that led us into these crises remains unquestioned, its prestige untarnished. The public remains in ignorance.  
  This paper is an attempt to inform the public simply and clearly about 
the very dangerous nuclear crises of the Cold War.  Until these are widely 
understood, the great dangers of present policies will not be questioned and 
discussed.  The U.S.A., with its Freedom of Information Act, is the least 
secretive of all the world's great powers.  Much of the information in this 
paper has been made available by the benefit of this Act. Members of the 
public have thus been able to inform themselves of the way that nuclear 
weapons have threatened world security over the years.

   There are 36,000 nuclear weapons in the world in 1996 and the threat of 
the destruction of civilization by these weapons remains very great. The more 
that nuclear weapons increase military power, the more they decrease national 
security.  The only escape from this paradox is by the balanced reduction and 
eventual total abolition of these weapons on a rigid schedule.  This is a 
matter of great urgency; the present lull in great power rivalry may not last 
long.

  Table I shows, in summary, that during the 39 years of the Cold War (more 
precisely 476 months, from the start of Crisis #1 in March 1946 to the 
end of Crisis #16 in November 1985),  there was:
a) a serious threat of nuclear weapons use for 107 months (23% of time);
b) a serious threat of nuclear war that would destroy most of the U.S.A., 
U.S.S.R. and Europe during these major crises:  VIETNAM I, CHINA I, SUEZ, 
CHINA II, BERLIN II, BERLIN III, CUBA, VIETNAM II, IRAN II and FIRST STRIKE, 
a total of 55 months (12% of time);
c) a serious threat of the extinction of much of life on the globe from 
the effects of 	Nuclear Winter during all major crises after Crisis #9, 
BERLIN II:  a total of 	38.5 months (8% of time).

****************************************************************************

PERIOD 1. 1945-49:  U.S. NUCLEAR-WEAPON MONOPOLY          

  1945 was a pivotal year in world history:
- May:       WW-II ends with the defeat of Germany mainly by the U.S.S.R., 
             U.S.A. and U.K. 
- 16 July:   First atomic test explosion,
- 6 August:  Hiroshima destroyed by an atomic bomb,
- 9 August:  Nagasaki destroyed by an atomic bomb.
  The U.S.A. had thus rapidly shown that it was prepared to use this new 
ultra-destructive weapon, with its lingering poisonous effects, in the same 
way as conventional weapons.  President Truman believed that the Soviet Union 
would never be able to make an atomic bomb. He did not hesitate to use the 
threat of the U.S. atomic bomb against the Soviet Union.  The first such 
threats came only ten months after the end of WW-II, in disputes over the 
Soviet-Iranian border area (Crisis # 1, IRAN I) and the Balkans (Crisis #2, 
YUGOSLAVIA I)
  Crisis #3, BERLIN I, was much more serious and lasted for 15 months.  
The terminal event of this period came on 3 September 1949, when the Soviets 
exploded their first atomic bomb.  The U.S. monopoly of nuclear weapons had 
lasted barely four years.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Nuclear Crisis #1 in Year: 1946  
Name of Crisis: IRAN I (Azerbaijan)
Threatened use of nuclear weapons by: U.S.A.
Target: U.S.S.R.
Crisis starts: March 1946 
Crisis ends:   48 hours after Truman's ultimatum
Threat of nuclear attack:  Stated
At issue in Crisis: British pre-war domination of Iran was challenged after 
                    the war by the Soviets.
BACKGROUND: During WW-II there was a U.S.A. and Soviet wartime agreement to 
occupy Iran jointly. This denied it to the Germans and allowed aid convoys to 
enter the U.S.S.R. through Iran.  After WW-II, the Soviets demanded oil 
concessions equal to those of the British, as previously agreed.  To enforce 
this claim Soviet troops remained in northern Iran and supported a 
revolutionary movement in Azerbaijan Province adjoining Soviet territory.  
The Soviets moved tanks to the border and showed no sign of removing their 
troops from Iran by 2 March 1946 as agreed by them at the London Conference 
of the Council of Foreign Ministers.  

CRISIS EVENTS:  President Truman meets personally with Soviet Ambassador 
Gromyko and delivers an ultimatum: Remove Soviet troops in 48 hours or the 
U.S.A. will drop the atomic bomb.  "We're going to drop it on you," Truman
is reported to say to Gromyko.

OUTCOME: Soviets removed their troops in 24 hours.  This threat of an atomic 
bomb attack on the Soviet Union by Truman came only 10 months after the end 
of WW-II.  Three months after this crisis, on 14 June 1946, the U.S.A. 
presented the Baruch Plan for the international control of nuclear material 
for the production of atomic energy.  Soviet rejection of this plan must now 
be viewed in the light of their experience of U.S.A. "atomic control" in the 
IRAN I crisis over Azerbaijan.
****************************************************************************


Crises #2 to #15 omitted here


****************************************************************************

Nuclear Crisis #16 in Year: 1983
Name of Crisis: FIRST STRIKE
Threatened use of nuclear weapons by:  U.S.A.
Target: U.S.S.R.
Crisis starts: 1 December 1983, 9 Pershing II's delivered to Ramstein, Germany 
Crisis ends: 19 November 1985, Gorbachev and Reagan meet in Geneva 
Duration: 2 years
Threat of nuclear attack: Implied (at very great risk)
At issue in Crisis:  U.S. preparation for FIRST STRIKE CAPABILITY

BACKGROUND: In the nuclear arms race the U.S.A. had always held a 5 to 10-year 
lead over the Soviet Union and in the 1980's a system for a FIRST STRIKE 
surprise attack on the U.S.S.R. was nearly ready.   It had 3 parts:  
1) Decapitation: the flat trajectory Pershing II missiles  were extremely 
accurate  and  designed to "decapitate" (behead) the Sovietleadership. Flight 
time to Moscow from bases in West Germany was 6 minutes;  
2) Counterforce: it would be possible by the late 1980's to  knock out all 
known Soviet missiles on land and at sea with MX and Trident-II missiles using
the new very precise "Navstar" guidance system.  In case a few Soviet missiles
survived this First Strike, the U.S.A. needed a "shield";  
3) Strategic Defence Initiative (SDI) or Star Wars, was the "shield", and this
enormously costly and incomplete system was the third part of FIRST STROKE.  
These very threatening plans meant that a world nuclear holocaust might result
from a faulty Soviet radar warning.  Six minutes gave the Soviets little time 
for analysis of U.S. intentions.  The Soviets understood all of these threats 
very clearly.

CRISIS EVENTS: 1983, 26 October: Soviet Premier Andropov stated Soviets will 
walk out at Geneva if deployment of Pershing II and Cruise missiles begins.
-15 November: Britain: First shipment of Tomahawk Cruise Missiles arrives.
-30 November: West German parliament votes 286:226 to accept first shipment of
9 Pershing II missiles on German soil, in spite of demonstrations by 400,000 
Germans, during 1983, opposed to the deployment of medium range missiles.  
-1 December: FIRST STRIKE Crisis #16 begins when U.S. C-5 Galaxy transports 
deliver 9 Pershing II missiles to Ramstein air base near Mannheim, West 
Germany, which are then transported to the U.S. Army 56th Field Artillery 
Brigade base at Mutlangen.  In Geneva, Soviet negotiator Yuli Kvitsinsky walks
out of a meeting with U.S. negotiator Paul Nitze, ending nuclear arms 
negotiations and offering no resumption date.
-8 December: Nuclear Winter, that might kill most nuclear war survivors is
predicted, even if only half of U.S. and Soviet nuclear weapons used (joint 
statement by 4 U.S. and 4 Soviet scientists meeting in Washington).
1985, 11 March: Gorbachev elected General Secretary of the Central Committee 
by a margin of one vote over Grishin, a hard liner who would probably have 
escalated the arms race.  This election may well prove to have been a 
critical event in world history.
-15 March: Nuclear Winter "that would wipe out all life on earth .. is all the
more reason to continue President Ronald Reagan's weapons build-up," Richard 
Perle, U.S. Assistant Secretary of Defence. 
-July: Soviets stop nuclear tests
-19 and 20 November, Gorbachev and Reagan meet in Geneva; Cold War tensions 
ease progressively for the next two years, and the FIRST STRIKEe Crisis also 
abates during this period.
1987, 8 December: Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty signed in 
Washington by Presidents Gorbachev and Reagan. It will eliminate all medium 
and short range nuclear weapons.

OUTCOME: With the end of the worst Crisis of all, the Cold War also ended. 
*****************************************************************************

PERIOD 5:  1985-1991:  GORBACHEV ENDS THE COLD WAR
   The relentless arms race culminated in Crisis #16, FIRST STRIKE. This 
was the most dangerous period in human history.
1985, 11 March: Mikhail Gorbachev is elected General Secretary of the Cental 
Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.  He beats his rival, 
Victor Grishin, a hard-liner, by one vote.  Gorbachev sets to work to end the 
nuclear arms race and the Cold War in a series of bold and visionary steps:
-July: Gorbachev orders the cessation of Soviet nuclear tests.
-July to December: U.S.A. tests 9 nuclear weapons.
-19 and 20 November: GENEVA SUMMIT where Gorbachev meets U.S. President Reagan
and tensions between the U.S.A and U.S.S.R. begin to ease.
1986: "International Year of Peace." Nuclear weapons tests: U.S.A.: 15   
                                                            U.S.S.R.: 0
-15 January, Gorbachev, "The Soviet Union proposes that a step-by-step 
consistent process of ridding the earth of  nuclear weapons be implemented and completed within the next 15 years, before the end of  this century."  Gorbachev proposed three stages for this process:  1) Elimination of all U.S. and Soviet medium range mis


siles in Europe.  All U.S. and Soviet nuclear tests to cease immediately.  All U.S. and Soviet strategic weapons to be reduced by one half.  All U.S. and Soviet space-strike weapons to be eliminated.   2) (1990-95)  Other nuclear powers join in nuclear di


sarmament, eliminating nuclear tests and space-strike weapons.  All tactical nuclear weapons to be eliminated.  A ban on all non-nuclear weapons, based on new physical principles, whose destructive power is close to that of nuclear weapons.    3) (1995-20


00)  Elimination of all remaining nuclear weapons.
-11 and 12 October: REYKJAVIK SUMMIT: Gorbachev offers 50% reduction in 
strategic weapons and removal of all U.S. and Soviet medium range missiles in 
Europe. Reagan, unprepared, flounders and refuses.
-3 November: "Contragate" scandal erupts.  The Reagan administration's illegal
sale of arms to Iran to finance its illegal covert war in Nicaragua is exposed.
1987 February: Soviets resume nuclear tests after a 19 month halt.
-May to August: Iran-Contra affair is probed by Senate and House committees.
The Reagan presidency is increasingly implicated and threatened.
-8 December: Washington: Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty is
signed by Presidents Gorbachev and Reagan.  It will eliminate all medium and 
short-range nuclear weapons. This marks the end of the FIRST STRIKE Crisis
#16 and is a landmark event in the approaching end of the Cold War.
1989 February: Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan complete.
-March: Part of new Congress is chosen in free elections in U.S.S.R.
-June: Elections give Solidarity majority in Poland.
-November: Demolition of Berlin Wall.
1991, 17 January:  U.S. launches war (Desert Storm) against Iraq.
-June: Yeltsin becomes President of Supreme Soviet after first free national 
elections. 
-19-21 August: Gorbachev is toppled in abortive coup by old guard communist 
hard-liners. Had they won - and they nearly did - the nuclear arms race 
could well have resumed its fatal course. 
- 8 December: Yeltsin meets with the leaders of the Ukraine and White Russia 
and abolishes the  U.S.S.R., with no mandate to do so.
******************************************************************************

PERIOD 6   1991-  :POST COLD WAR RE-GROUPING
   Following the break up of the Soviet Union, the United States has emerged 
as the world's number one superpower.  A dangerous conclusion is that the 
U.S.A. "won the Cold War" with Ronald Reagan's weapons build up (see the
APPENDIX for Pozner's comments in "Eyewitness"). 
   This period is similar to the "Scared Straight" period after Crisis #11, 
CUBA. It is a time of precious opportunity for nuclear disarmament. In 1996 
Russia is in economic and political turmoil, China is rapidly emerging as a 
world power, there are still 36,000 nuclear weapons in the world. The world 
situation is not stable.
   The balanced reduction and total abolition of these weapons, on a rigid 
schedule is a matter of great urgency; the present lull in great power 
rivalry may not last long!
