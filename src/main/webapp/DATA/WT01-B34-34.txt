<h2>PCP and Violence </h2>

<p><b>excerpted from : Drug Abuse and Drug Abuse Research, an
annual report to congress by the U.S. Dept. of Health and Human
Services, pg. 153. (1991)</b> </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>

<p>&quot;There are two aspects to phencyclidine (PCP)
intoxication that have warranted particular attention by the
general public, as well as by law-enforcement and clinical
personnel. Both aspects concern the relationship between
phencyclidine abuse and aggressive behavior. There are reports of
increased aggressiveness and 'super-human' strength that develop
in some people who take phencyclidine. </p>

<p>Recent studies, including those of men arrested for criminal
activity in Washington D.C. and New York City (Wish 1986) and
evaluations of published clinical reports of phencyclidine
intoxication (Brecher et al. 1988), indicate that if
phencyclidine induces violent, criminal behavior, it does so only
extremely infrequently. </p>

<p>Although Wish (1986) noted that most men who had urines
positive for phencyclidine were younger than those who had taken
no drugs or other drugs, their crimes were likely to be less
aggressive than the crimes of those who had not taken
phencyclidine. </p>

<p>Khajawall et al. (1982) found no difference in the behavior of
clients admitted for phencyclidine detoxification and those
admitted for opioid detoxification. Thus, phencylidine-induced
aggression appears to be a rare phenomenon, if it occurs at
all.&quot; </p>
