<H2>Federal Qui Tam Actions - Help your government and share in the
recovery.
</H2><P><HR>
<P>Frauds perpetrated against the government -- want to do something about
it, like blow the whistle on scams you have inside knowledge about?
<P>From defense contractor overcharges to Medicare fraud to false reports
to the EPA on hazardous waste materials handling -- indeed, any kind of false
claims to the government (other than to the IRS) -- there's a powerful law
to combat those who bilk the government: the Federal False Claims Act. It
affords a powerful tool to stop this kind of waste and corruption.
<P>An employee or other insider who blows the whistle can maintain
confidentiality through the attorney-client relationship until at such time
as the claim is made public. And federal law prohibits retaliation against
employees who come forward and reveal their employer's fraud against the
government. As a reward for acting as a "private attorney general" for the
U.S. government, you are entitled to from 15% to 30% of any moneys recovered
for the government, including recoveries of civil penalties amounting to
a minimum of $5,000 and a maximum of $10,000 for each separate false claim
made.
<P>To find out more about how this law works and what you can do, check out
the False Claims Act home page of the <A HREF="http://www.taf.org">Taxpayers
Against Fraud</A> (TAF), a nonprofit organization, and their
<A HREF="http://www.taf.org/taf/docs/1Q95.html">Quarterly Review</A> of
whistleblower or "qui tam" cases. Another helpful site is
