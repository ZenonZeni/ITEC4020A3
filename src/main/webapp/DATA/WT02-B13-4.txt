re: October 7, 1994 Fall Workshop at UCSD<BR>


<P>

The Fall Workshop brought 30 UC faculty and graduate students

interested in Comparative Immigration and Integration issues to

the Center for US-Mexican Studies at UCSD to discuss 3 papers

and to hear a presentation on the Commission on Immigration Reform's

recommendations and research agenda. <BR>


<P>

The CIIP is funded by the CGES with funds from a 10-year grant

from the German government to promote German and European studies;

CIIP affiliates were reminded to volunteer to present their papers

at the program's Spring and Fall Workshops and to submit papers

to Martin at UCD or Patricia LaHay at CGES, 254 Moses, UCB. After

review by the CIIP Executive Committee, they will be issued as

CIIP Working Papers. <BR>


<P>

Ed Taylor (UCD) discussed a paper by Roger Waldinger (UCLA) that

asked why low-wage employers, once they begin to hire immigrant

workers, permit and encourage immigrants to &quot;take over&quot;

particular workplaces. Taylor emphasized the advantages of immigrant

networks to employers: current workers know exactly what the job

requires, current workers have an incentive to recruit only good

workers; current workers transfer existing friendships, etc into

the workplace, and networks are a cheap and efficient way to obtain

new workers. <BR>


<P>

Waldinger analyzed trends in US employment, noting that many new

jobs either require higher <B>or</B> lower skills. As the economy

evolves, the job distribution develops an hourglass shape, with

immigrants at both extremes. Waldinger focused on jobs filled

by immigrants at the bottom of this distribution.<BR>


<P>

Using employer survey data, he described how employers ask current

workers to bring friends and relatives to fill job vacancies.

When the current workforce includes immigrants who can draw from

a seemingly endless pool of friends and relatives here and abroad,

then network hiring tends to exclude e.g., native-born Blacks

and Whites, because they do not learn about job vacancies.<BR>


<P>

Why don't employers who are hiring a number of new workers try

to initiate a network of Black or white workers? Many LA employers

believe that immigrants work harder, complain less, and in general

have the &quot;right attitude&quot; toward managers while &quot;getting

along&quot; with co-workers. Interestingly, the &quot;right attitude&quot;

was considered more important for many jobs than education or

English.<BR>


<P>

Waldinger concludes that his study does not make a definitive

case for the hypothesis that immigrants adversely affect Blacks,

but it pushes him toward that conclusion. His survey supports

the hypothesis that most of the displacement due to immigration

is indirect rather than direct, a result of cumulative causation

in the labor market. Non-immigrants do not learn about many job

openings at the bottom of the labor market because the immigrant

network assures that job vacancies are filled by immigrant friends

and relatives, including those still abroad. Many do not want

to learn about these jobs, since many want more than employers

are willing to pay. <BR>


<P>

Such indirect displacement is a sharp distinction from the 1970s

view of, among others, Labor Secretary Ray Marshall, that employers

have separate queues of immigrant and Black workers. In that theory,

employers select from the immigrant line, it is argued, because

they believe that the immigrants will work &quot;hard and scared.&quot;

<BR>


<P>

The logical next step is to professionalize networks, as occurs

when labor contractors make it their full time job to recruit

a particular type of worker. This has long been the case in the

farm labor market, and is increasingly the case in the nonfarm

labor market for &quot;temps&quot; of all types. One comparative

question is the extent to which the labor market deregulation

being urged on the Europeans by the OECD will, in a time of high

migration, also promote network recruiting and labor contracting

in a manner that takes some jobs out of the public employment

system. In Germany, e.g., the public ES normally makes 30 to 40

percent of annual job placements, versus 3 to 4 percent in the

US.<BR>


<P>

The discussion emphasized that immigrants are diverse, and not

all are unskilled and entering the US job market on the bottom

rungs. Some questioned the native-born--immigrant distinction.

As to whether unskilled immigrants are &quot;necessary&quot; for

the CA economy, it was noted that many non-tradeable jobs are

becoming tradable, and that, in agriculture, there is often a

distinction between a short-run need or inelastic demand for unskilled

workers, and a much more flexible or elastic long-run demand for

labor. <BR>


<P>

Jeanette Money (UCD) linked immigration policy changes with economic

variables over the 1955-85 period in the US, UK, Sweden, France

and Germany. It is clear that total foreigner inflows varied from

year-to-year and across countries, but the data do not permit

precise counts of nor distinctions between immigrants, probationary

immigrants(European guestworkers), non immigrants, and illegal

aliens. For this reason, the US is pictured as having a generally

lower immigration rate--the annual inflow as a percent of the

population was about 2/10 of one percent in 1970, when there were

about 375,000 immigrants and the pop was 200 million--while in

Germany the rate was almost 10 times higher. The US immigrants

could stay indefinitely, but most of the German entrants were

guestworkers admitted with one year renewable work and residence

permits.<BR>


<P>

Money regressed these annual immigration flows against country-specific

economic indicators such as interest rates, manufacturing employment,

and unemployment rates, but found none of them statistically significant.

After separating out the US as a traditional country of immigration,

she concluded that &quot;nonimmigrant&quot; European nations had

higher immigration rates that immigrant US.<BR>


<P>

The paper next turns to the hypothesis that it is local reactions

to immigration policy that explain changes in it. Immigrants are

geographically concentrated. In thumbnail sketches of immigration

policy changes in UK, F, and the US, she concludes that immigration

tends to be restricted when a concentrated immigrant population

is combined with high local unemployment rates. Local opposition

to immigration in tough economic times generates pressure for

immigration restrictions, which is most likely to lead to immigration

policy changes if electoral margins are small and political competition.

<BR>


<P>

Manuel Garcia y Griego (UCI) noted that it is hard to evaluate

the relationship between immigration policy changes and immigration

flows because of the &quot;gap&quot; between immigration goals

and outcomes. Regression analysis implicitly assumes that there

is no such gap, and that there are no or uniform lags in implementing

immigration policy changes. It was also note d that, in the US,

many of the most restrictionist legislators are from districts

with few immigrants, while admissionist politicians often represent

districts with many immigrants.<BR>


<P>

Rafael Alarcon (UCB) reported on a study tracing Mexicans who

had moved from Central Mexico to several areas of CA, including

Madera. These workers originally came as solo men, but more and

more are settling with their families in CA. Philip Martin (UCD)

noted that leakage into permanence is an inevitable side effect

of temporary worker programs because of the growing mutual dependence

of employers and immigrant workers, and the complex cumulative

causation processes this dependence sets in motion. However, settlement

rates for Mexican immigrant workers in CA seem to have been lower

than were settlement rates for guestworkers in non- immigrant

Europe.<BR>


<P>

The Alarcon paper also raised other issues. Was the upward mobility

experienced by these workers, from seasonal to more permanent

worker, atypical or likely to be repeated in the 1990s and after

2000? Most European guestworkers started higher on the job ladder

than do the typical immigrants from rural Mexico--how do their

mobility patterns differ? Finally, why are naturalization rates

for these settled immigrants so low--Alarcon suggests that the

immigrants see few advantages to US citizenship, and that some

think that becoming a US citizen is being disloyal to Mexico.

<BR>


<P>

During the afternoon session of the workshop, CIR senior policy

analyst David Howell reviewed 2 major recommendations of the CIR

issued September 30, 1994, those dealing with enforcement and

benefits. The CIR's report is based on the theory that the US

must above all restore credibility of immigration policy by making

immigration easier for legal immigrations, making it harder to

illegal aliens to enter, and locating and removing persons not

authorized to be here. <BR>


<P>

CIR recommendations include support for Operation Hold the Line

in El Paso and Operation Gatekeeper, efforts to put additional

Border Patrol agents near the border to deter illegal entries

and expedite legal entries. The most visible recommendation is

to test in 5 states a registry that would combine SS and INS data.

Under the proposal, an employer would request the SSN of each

new hire after the person begins to work, check it, along with

a personal identifier such as mother's maiden name, and then record

the verification number to prove that the employer complied with

IRCA's employer sanctions provisions. If there is no match, then

the employee would continue to work while the apparent error is

investigated. The CIR recommended that more efforts be made to

educate employers to avoid discrimination, and more funds be made

available for labor law enforcement.<BR>


<P>

The CIR asserted that illegal aliens should not get any more benefits

than they are currently eligible for, primarily public education

and emergency health care. The CIR also recommended that legal

immigrants not be denied access to welfare for 3 to 5 years, as

occurs under some programs today, but that sponsors who agree

to support the family members they ask the US government to admit

should be required to honor these commitments. Further, access

to social services should be decided when new immigration categories

are created. The CIR agrees that the states which have the most

immigrants should obtain federal aid, but only for their actual

additional expenditures due to illegal immigration. <BR>


<P>

The CIR also urged that illegal aliens convicted of crimes should

be deported ASAP, and that the immigration data base be improved.

The CIR is urging that an independent critique be conducted of

existing benefits and costs of immigration, and is the lead agency

to explore ways to cooperate with Mexico to reduce emigration

push pressures. <BR>


<P>

CIIP participants expressed reservations about the registry and

the denial of benefits noting, for example, that denying benefits

may not reduce the incentive to come to the US illegally because

relatively few illegal aliens say that they come here for such

benefits. The CIR was urged to rethink the treat all countries

equally in an effort to give Mexico a larger quota.<BR>


<P>

Gustavo de la Vina and Ann Summers (INS) provided several CIIP

participants with an explanation of Operation Gatekeeper. Unlike

EL Paso, where 70 percent of the illegal entrants were destined

for the El Paso area, over 95 percent of those apprehended south

of San Diego are headed for destinations outside the area, usually

to Los Angeles, 120 miles north. This means the reaction to saturating

the border with agents is likely to be different--in El Paso,

reducing illegal entries and expediting legal entries was supported

by 90 percent of EL Paso. In San Diego, most aliens pay smugglers

$300 for the trip to Los Angeles, and many have a mindset that

they must attempt illegal entry repeatedly until they succeed.

<BR>


<P>

The goal of Operation Gatekeeper is to make it impossible for

aliens to avoid capture along a 14 mile stretch of border. There

is a fence, high intensity lights, and 3 lines of agents, all

designed to get the message out that if you attempt illegal entry,

you will be apprehended. All those apprehended are fingerprinted

electronically, and between October 1 and 6, about 6 percent of

the 6000 aliens apprehended were recidivists caught for the second

or third time. Alien smugglers have been able to evade some past

control efforts--using cellular phones to know when the Border

Patrol checkpoints on Highways 5 and 15 are down, for example,

to smuggle aliens through, and using juvenile drivers and nearly

worthless vehicles to cope with smuggling penalties and vehicle

seizure.<BR>


<P>

The Spring workshop of the CIIP will be held on a Friday in April

at UCB. We will select a date and notify you of the meeting, as

well as the 1995 CIIP RFP, at the beginning of the January or

February Migration News. Please volunteer to present a paper at

the Spring workshop, and send in your working papers.<BR>
