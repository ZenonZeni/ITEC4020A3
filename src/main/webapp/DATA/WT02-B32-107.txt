<b>Research Interests</b><br>

Our research is concerned with the beneficial uses of microorganisms in
food fermentations and in novel applications of microorganisms in foods. The
section has two main interests, one dealing with the kinetics of microbial
growth and the biochemical changes in food fermentations using moulds and the
other with the basic physiology of lactic acid bacteria.<p>
Studies on food fermentations aim to elucidate the microbiological and
biochemical changes that occur in order to improve the technologies and develop
new or modified products or processes. Currently we are working on yoghurt,
tempe (cooked soybeans bound into a cake by growth of a mould) and daddawa (a
flavouring material produced by bacterial growth on legume seeds).<p>
The work on lactic acid bacteria is investigating ways of directing the
metabolism towards the production of specific metabolites. Current work on
flavour compounds is aimed at controlling the production of acetaldehyde and
other flavour compounds in yoghurt and the development of fish sauce-like
aromas in fermented legume seeds.<p>
<p>
<b>Teaching Acitivities</b><br>
Ecology of microbes; non-milk food fermentations; biological aspects  of
control of fermentations; principles of biological waste-water treatment. <p>
