<h3><a name="intro"></a>Introduction</h3>
<p>Depression is a leading cause of failure in school and in life for young people (children, adolescents, and young adults) with learning disabilities. The depressed state can be primary (familial-genetic 
disorder) or secondary (symptomatic depression) to medical conditions or learning disability. 

<p>Depression is feeling sad, lonely, unloved, dumb, and worthless, along
with guilt feelings and beliefs of being mistreated. Depression is having
trouble falling asleep (initial insomnia), restless sleep with 
recurrent awakenings (interval insomnia), or waking early in the morning
unable to fall back to sleep (terminal insomnia). Depression often is
also awakening in the morning anxious, tired, sad, or mad. 
Depression is a loss of interest in friends, hobbies, and school or work.
Depression causes a loss of concentration, poor memory, forgetfulness,
and inattention. Depression is having headaches, 
stomachaches, and other physical symptoms. Depression is feeling angry,
picked on, grouchy, and irritable. Sometimes depression is feeling
hopeless and helpless, and wishing to die. Depression is the 
leading cause of suicide. A clinical depression is a combination of these
symptoms which persist for longer than three weeks and cause failure in
the person's environments of home, work (school), or play. 
Depression has been demonstrated in many studies to be associated with
and the possible cause of school failure, conduct disorder and
delinquency, anorexia and bulimia, school phobia, and panic attacks.

<p>The scientific description of depression and manic-depressive disease
was first prepared by Emil Kraepelin in the early 1900s. For the first
half of the twentieth century, most clinicians did not accept the 
concept that primary depression (or manic-depressive disease: affective
illness) occurred in children and adolescents. However, by the early
1970s, criteria for the recognition of depression in children and
adolescents had been established (<a href="table
1.html">Table 1,  "The Weinberg Criteria"</a>). These criteria were based
upon those used to diagnose depression and mania in adults as formulated
in the Research Diagnostic Criteria (RDC) for adult psychiatric disorders
by the Department of Psychiatry of the Washington University School of
Medicine in St. Louis, Missouri. The Weinberg Criteria for depression in
children and adolescents was published in 1973 and the criteria for mania
in 1976 by Weinberg and Brumback (<a href="table2.html">Table 2</a>). In
1980, the American Psychiatric Association published the Diagnostic and 
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders - Third Edition (DSM-III) [revised
in 1988 as DSM-IIIR and in 1994 as DSM-IV] which contained guidelines for
the diagnosis of depression and mania in individuals of all ages. In the
DSM-III, diagnostic criteria were added for the various temporal patterns
of affective illness. These patterns are characterized by chronic,
long-standing ebbs and flows, "good" and "bad" periods per day, mixed
with  "good" and "bad" days, but without prolonged well (stable) states.
Patterns of affective illness with prominent manic symptomatology
(chronic hypomania, cyclo-thymia, juvenile rapid cycling bipolar disorder
and dysthymia with the manic feature of hostile  anger) are most
prevalent in pre-school years and continue through young adult age.     

<p>Depression and other forms of affective illness are probably genetic
disorders based upon studies of familial clusterings, evaluation of
offspring of both depressed and manic-depressive adults, and studies of 
siblings and twins reared apart. Research is now underway to determine
whether the various patterns of affective illness represent a unitary
genetic disorder modified by other traits or are the result of multiple 
and varied genetic and psychosocial causes. It is possible that even
genetically-based affective illness could remain dormant throughout an
individual's life if inappropriate environmental stressors are not 
present. 

<h3><a name="YoungPeople"></a>Criteria For Depression In Young People</h3>

The "Weinberg Criteria" for depression (<a href="table1.html">Table
1</a>) include 10 major symptom categories: dysphoric mood,
self-deprecatory ideation, agitation, sleep disturbance, change in school
performance, diminished socialization, change in attitude towards school,
somatic complaints, loss of usual energy, and unusual change in appetite
or weight. The individual must manifest: 1) <u>dysphoric moods and
affect</u> and 2) <u>self-deprecatory ideation</u>. We use the term
<u>mood</u> to describe the young person's emotional feelings, while the
term <u>affect</u> indicates the individual's appearance in relation to 
feelings. Symptoms of dysphoric mood and affect are sadness, loneliness,
unhappiness, hopelessness, pessimism, mood swings, moodiness,
irritability, easily annoyed, hypersensitivity, tearfulness and crying, 
negativity, and difficulty being pleased. Generally, a child manifesting
dysphoric moods will have a multitude of these symptoms. Sadness and
hopelessness can be so severe that the young person will withdraw to a
room to sit and cry (melancholy). Self-deprecation is the feeling of
being worthless, useless, dumb, stupid, and guilty, or beliefs of
persecution. Death wishes occur in 35% of pre-pubertal children 
manifesting depression, suicidal ideation (thoughts and plans) in 15%,
and suicidal attempts in 5%.

<p>In addition to  dysphoric moods and  self-deprecation, the child must
have four or more of the following eight symptoms: 

<ul>
<li>agitation
<li>sleep disturbance
<li>change in school performance
<li>diminished socialization
<li>change in attitude toward school (work)
<li>somatic complaints
<li>loss of usual energy 
<li>unusual change in appetite or weight
</ul>
Most young people fulfilling this criteria will have seven or eight of
the ten major symptoms. 

<p>The <u>agitation of depression</u> is irritability, grouchy feelings
and actions, inappropriate sudden anger or fighting, quarrelsomeness,
lack of respect for authority, and difficulty getting along with others. 
The most common <u>sleep disturbance</u> is trouble falling asleep
(initial insomnia). The young child will often manifest restless sleep
with frequent awakenings (interval insomnia) and enter the parents bed 
for comfort. Awakening too early in the morning (terminal insomnia)
strongly correlates with thoughts of suicide. Common to the depressed
adolescent is difficulty awakening in the morning with excessive 
morning sleep. <u>Change in school performance</u> is characterized by
frequent complaints from the teachers of: daydreaming, poor concentration
and memory, and inattentiveness; loss of usual work effort 
in school subjects with a drop in grades; loss of usual interest in
extra-scholastic activities; incomplete classroom assignments; much
incomplete homework; avoidance of homework activity; and disruptive 
behavior.

<p>The depressed young person will often <u>lose interest</u> in friends
and social activities. Occasionally the young person loses the ability to
anticipate or experience pleasure (<u>anhedonia</u>). Commonly, the
individual must be forced or coerced to participate in what previously
were usual, fun activities, but the enjoyment is lessened and the
participation does not restore interest (dyshedonia). <u>School
avoidance</u>, <u>school resistance</u>, <u>discomfort in school</u>, and
<u>school phobia</u>  are symptomatic of depression. <u>Somatic
complaints</u> (physical complaints) of headaches, stomachaches, joint
and muscle aches and pains, and visual disturbances without any physical
cause is depression until proven otherwise. The depressed young person
complains of  <u>poor energy</u> and <u>tiredness</u>. A <u>change in
appetite</u> (either a loss in appetite or excessive desire to eat)   
associated with change in weight is less common in children than adults,
but is still symptomatic of depression. It is important to understand
that depression, as a disease or illness, is a group of symptoms
associated with maladaptation or worsening in usual performance in either
the home, school, or play environments. Most depressed young people will
be failing in school, will be difficult to live with at home, and will
drop out of usual extra-scholastic pursuits. The depressed individual's
judgment deteriorates, interests wane, and failure occurs.

<p>Minor depressions are identical to major depressive episodes in
duration but involve fewer symptoms and less impairment. The Weinberg
Criteria for depression defines severity of a depressive episode in 
relation to death wishes and suicidal ideation: mild (no death wishes),
moderate (positive for death wishes or suicidal thoughts), and severe
(positive for suicidal plans or suicidal attempts).

<h3><a name="diagnosis"></a>Diagnosis of Depression</h3>

<p>Using the Weinberg Criteria, the diagnosis of depression is
established through interview of the individual and the primary
caretaker. The criteria symptoms for depression must represent a change
from the individual's usual self or a worsening of the usual self, be
present for more than three weeks, and be associated with poor
performance and a worsening of adaptation (or failure) in one, two, or
three environments - home, school (work), or play. A symptom is accepted
as positive when at least one of the characteristic behaviors listed for
that symptom category is present (Table 1). Dysphoric moods and self 
deprecation (deteriorated self-esteem) must be reported by the young
person for these symptoms to be considered positive. The other eight
symptom categories can be reported by either the individual or the 
primary caretaker.

<p> Petti (1978; 1985) developed the Bellevue Index of Depression (BID)
from the Weinberg Criteria. The BID offers a systematic interview
approach to both the young patient and the caretaker and can be 
used for diagnosis of depression and assessment of the severity of the
depressed state. The Diagnostic Inventory for Children and Adolescents
(DICA) developed by Herjanic and Reich (1982) is a structured 
interview based upon DSM-III criteria for depression and other
psychiatric disorders. It is administered to both the patient and the caretaker. The Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia (K-SADS-P) developed by Puig Antich and Chambers 
(1978) is a structured interview modified for children based upon the
Research Diagnostic Criteria (RDC) for depression and other psychiatric
disorders in adults. The Children's Depression Rating Scale - Revised
(CDRS-R) was developed by Poznanski and colleagues, in 1985, and modeled
after the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression for adults. It correlates 
with global ratings for depression. 

<p><b>Depression By Self-Report</b><br>
It is possible to recognize young people at risk for depression through
self-report instruments. The Weinberg Screening Affective Scale (WSAS) is
a 56 item self-administered form requiring fourth grade 
reading ability (Appendix A) that takes less than five minutes to
complete. The WSAS correlates with depressive illness in both outpatient
and hospitalized depressed children and adolescents.

<p>Two large populations of high school students have been studied for
depression by self-report using the WSAS. The first study group consisted
of 3,292 students in a large metropolitan urban school district, and the
second population had 1,298 students 
from a rural middle-size college community school district. These two
population studies (in which 96% of the students participated)
demonstrated that about 14% of high school students manifest depression
by self-report. Gender and ethnic group differences were evident.
Hispanic females had the highest percentage of depression by self-report
(22%), while white males (8%) had the lowest. Black students, white
females, and Hispanic males were intermediate in the prevalence of
depression. Three percent (3%) of the students related suicidal thoughts
("I think a lot about killing myself") These studies concluded that
depressive sympto-matology is prominent in adolescents, large numbers of
young people are actively depressed, and a significant number are at risk
for suicide. The WSAS can be used for the screening of depression in
young people and is a strong confirmation instrument in the clinical
setting. Two other widely used self-report forms for depression are the
Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) which has been used in adolescents and
young adults and the Children's Depression Inventory (CDI) developed by
Kovacs in 1987 for ages 7-17 years. 

<p><b>Dysthymia: Chronic or Long-standing Depressive
Symptomatology</b><br>
Dysthymia is characterized by chronic long-standing depressive
symptomatology with ebbs and flows in severity, periods each day of
depressive moods (mixed days), occasional fully-depressed days, and an 
occasional depression-free day; but no prolonged well states. Periods of
major depression are common in individuals with dysthymic disorder.
Dysthymia limits functioning, performance, and enjoyment, but is 
not associated with the same degree of impairment that characterizes
minor or major depressive episodes.

<p>The onset of the dysthymic pattern is usually during the pre-school
years (ages 2-5 years), with major or minor depressive episodes occurring
later in elementary and secondary school years. School phobia 
with the start of school can be the presenting symptoms of a major
depressive episode in the anxious dysthymic young child. The learning
disabled dysthymic child will often develop a major depressive 
episode during the third or fourth grade school years associated with the
increased stress of school tasks. 

<h3><a name="mania"></a>Criteria for Mania in Young People</h3>
<p> The hallmarks of mania (<a href="table2.html">Table 2</a>) are
euphoria and hostile anger. Euphoria has two presentations: a) an elated
mood with inappropriate feelings of well being, cheerfulness, giddiness,
and silliness. However, it can also be b) 
the inappropriate denial of problems or symptoms despite behavior that is
obvious to observers as inappropriate, disruptive, and destructive. The
manic young person can be hyperactive, intrusive, destructive, or
agitated, or display hostile anger, while at the same time reporting, "I
have no problems or concerns."

<p>The irritability of mania is hostile anger, with ranting rages, driven
 impulsive destructiveness, or uncon-trollable antisocial behavior. The
hostile anger of mania can lead to homicidal wishes, thoughts, threats,
or attempts.

<p>Utilizing the criteria established by Weinberg and Brumback (1976) for
the recognition of mania in children and adolescents, the individual must
manifest either euphoria or hostile anger with three or more of the
following six symptoms: 

<ul>
<li>hyperactivity (mental, motor, or sexual), motor drivenness,
intrusiveness;
<li>push of speech;
<li>flight of ideas, racing thoughts, the inability to maintain thinking
on one idea; 
<li>grandiosity with heightened self-worth, self-power, and
self-influence which can be delusional; 
<li>sleep disturbance with decreased need for sleep and nighttime
hyperwakefulness (night-owl insomnia); 
<li>shortened attention span, inability to concentrate, and
distractibility. 
</ul>

Each symptom must be a discrete change from the individual's usual self,
either a new behavior or a worsening of an old behavior. Although the
original criteria stated that this symptom complex must be present for
more than one month, further studies indicate that a duration of only one
week is necessary. 

<p>Diagnosis of mania is established by interview and observation of the
young person and interview with the primary caretaker utilizing a
semi-structured, closed-end interview technique. A symptom is accepted as
positive when at least one of the characteristic behaviors listed for the
category is present. 

<u>Euphoria</u> (most commonly denial of any problems) must be reported
by the individual, but the other symptoms are observational and can be
reported by the individual, the caretaker, or knowledgeable others.

<p>The course of childhood <u>onset classic manic-depressive disease</u>
is exemplified by the child with no previous disturbance of mood and
affect who begins to manifest the symptom complex of depression. On a
rare occasion, a manic episode will precede the first period of
depression. Subsequently there are discrete periods of depression usually
lasting six to eighteen months and mania persisting for 
one to six weeks, with interspersed prolonged well states. Although
classic manic-depressive disease is uncommon in pre-pubertal child-ren,
the patterns of dysthymia, hypomania, cyclothymia, and juvenile 
rapid cycling bipolar disorder often begin during pre-school years, and
are mislabeled as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD),
conduct or oppositional defiant disorder, and over-anxious disorder. As 
the child ages, classic manic-depressive disease becomes evident. 

<p><b>Hypomania, Cyclothymia, And Juvenile Rapid Cycling Bipolar Disorder
(See <a href="glossary.html">Glossary</a>)</b><br>
One of the confusing problems in the recognition and appropriate
management of mania in children and adolescents is the observation that
hypomania is chronic with a very early onset. Hypomania can present 
in utero as a hyperactive fetus; as overly alert, irritable, colicky
infant with poor sleep habits; or as a "supermarket toddler" requiring
restriction in the gro-cery store cart. The hypomanic child progresses 
through preschool years with significant hyperactivity, excessive
cheerfulness, frequent sexual naughtiness, inappropriate silliness,
giddiness, and elation, and nightowl insomnia. As the child ages, 
periodic rants, rages, hostile anger (mania), and even homicidal threats
limit the hypomanic child's ability to function. Hypomania is a common
cause of attention deficit disorder with persistent hyperactivity 
(ADHD): "hypomanic/hyperactivity." Increasing manic moods and classic
manic-depressive disease become apparent as the child ages. 

<p><b>Cyclothymia (See <a href="glossary.html">Glossary</a>)</b><br>
Cyclothymia is long-standing (chronic) hypomania with moments per day of
both depressive moods and "mini" moments of significant anger. Most of
the days are "mixed days" with an occasional all "bad" day, but rarely an
"all good day." The cyclothymic disorder begins in the toddler or early
pre-school years and progresses during late childhood and young
adolescent years to discrete periods of major depression or 
manic episodes. 

<p><b>Juvenile Rapid Cycling Bipolar Disorder (JRCBD) (See
<a href="glossary.html">Glossary</a>)</b><br>
The term juvenile rapid cycling bipolar disorder (JRCBD) is applied to a
group of manic-depressive young people who are free of continuous
hypomanic/hyperactivity but manifest moment-to-moment, day-to-day 
("all mixed days") of depressive moods, actions, and feelings
interspersed with hostile anger, ranting, or rages. Juvenile rapid
cycling bipolar disorder most often is evident during preschool years and
worsens with aging to major depressive or manic episodes during the
adolescent years. 

<h3><a name="history"></a>Family History</h3>

<p>The pattern of affective illness in the young person predicts family
history. If the pattern in the young person is discrete cycles of
depression with or without a manic episode and with prolonged well
states, the family history will only be positive for typical depression
or classic manic-depressive disease. Dysthymia or cyclothymia in the
young person predicts a family history of depression or manic-depressive
disease along with alcoholism.     

<p>Depressed children, who are oppositional and defiant or have a conduct
disorder, have a positive family history of sociopathy, or alcoholism,
along with depression or manic-depressive disease. 
Hallucinations during depression indicate a family member with
schizophrenia. Depressed children with prominent somatic complaints
frequently have a female family member with Briquet's syndrome (a 
disorder characterized by severe hypochondriasis and often multiple
operations without recognizable underlying medical disease). Inherited
traits of these other disorders become apparent as additional 
symptoms during the depressive episodes in young people. When that young
person is free of depression or manic-depressive episodes, those traits
become inapparent. Thus, it is important to try to identify an 
underlying depression or manic-depressive state in any children
presenting with an apparent conduct disorder, somatic complaints, or
other behavior complexes.

<p>It is also noteworthy that 30-40% of affectively ill children will
have a biologic parent who is also affectively ill (most commonly
depression) at the time the young person presents for initial evaluation. 

<h3><a name="neurology">The Neurology and Biology of Affective Illness in
Young People</a></h3>

<p>The neurologic examination is very important in both establishing and
understanding the localization of depression in the brain and the
influence of this metabolic (chemical) disorder of the brain on other 
brain functions. During a depressive episode the young person will often
manifest neurologic abnormalities of tone, posture, or reflexes in the
left arm and leg indicating dysfunction of the right side of the brain
(right cerebral hemisphere). The manic young person will have similar
neurologic abnormalities that involve the right arm and leg indicating
dysfunction of the left side of the brain (left cerebral hemisphere).
Depressed young people have a variety of problems that indicate
disturbances in right parietal lobe functions: they have impaired
coordination and are clumsy (dyspraxias); handwriting deteriorates
(dysgraphia); they have language skills ("math"), wit, and humor suffer.
In mania, the individual demonstrates errors indicative of left cerebral
hemisphere dysfunction: specific word finding (naming) difficulties,
problems with clarity of speech, and abnormal verbalizations. During well
states, these motor findings and disturbances of higher brain
communicative-cognitive functions improve to the individual's more usual
abilities. An important concept is that affective illness can cause a
learning disability or worsen an underlying learning disability.

<p>The right posterior parietotemporal cortex appears to be involved in
the production of the dysphoric and vegetative symptoms of depression.
The left mesial temporal and entorhinal cortex appears to be 
responsible for the key symptoms of mania: euphoria (denial) and hostile
anger. It is likely that obsessions, compulsions, and oppositional
defiant behavior are minor manifestations of the hostile anger 
of mania. It is prudent to mention that some research concerning adult
stroke patients has implicated left frontal lobe lesions in depression
and right frontotemporal lesions in mania. However, studies by Freeman 
and colleagues (1985) and the preponderance of studies reviewed by
Brumback (1985: 1993), indicate that the right parietotemporal area plays
a major role in the genesis of depression. Our ongoing observations of
children and adolescents confirm this brain localization for depression.

<p>Biological correlates for depression in young people are similar to
those reported in adults (<a href="table3.html">Table 3</a>). The most
reproducible have been abnormalities of sleep and disturbances in
hypothalamic-pituitary hormonal activity (abnormal dexamethasone
suppression test and blunted growth hormone and thyrotropin releasing
hormone). The strongest biological correlate is the proven successful
treatment of depression with certain specific medications. Originally,
the monoamine (MAO) inhibitors, and for the past twenty five years, the
tricyclic antidepressant medications (TCAs) have provided beneficial therapy. 

Both these agents augment the activities of the neurotransmitters
norepinephrine and serotonin. Serotonin is produced by neurons in the
raphe nuclei of the brain stem and travels up the axons of these neurons
to the cerebral hemispheres, more right than left, where it is released
into the synaptic clefts. Norepinephrine is produced by another group of
nerve cells, the locus ceruleus, of the brain stem and also travels up
axons to the cerebral hemispheres. In depressed states, there is a
relative deficiency of these two neurotransmitters. The tricyclic
antidepressants, amitriptyline (Elavil) and doxepin (Sinequan), block the
inactivation of serotonin thus allowing this neurotransmitter to be
available for needed use by cerebral cortical nerve cells (<a
href="table4.html">Table 4</a>). Desipramine (Norpramin) and
protriptyline (Vivactil) block the inactivation of norepinephrine, while
nortriptyline (Pamelor) and imipramine (Tofranil) prevent inactivation of
both serotonin and norepinephrine. The second generation antidepressant
trazodone (Desyrel) prevents inactivation of serotonin and maprotiline
(Ludiomil) prevents inactivation of norepinephrine. The new third
generation antidepressants sertraline (Zoloft), fluoxetine (Prozac), and
paroxetine (Paxil) are very specific in preventing inactivation of
serotonin. The underlying mechanisms leading to this relative deficiency
of serotonin and norepinephrine in the cerebral cortex is unknown, but we
believe that a dysfunction of modulating control from the right posterior
emporoparietal cortex initiates a cascade of events causing altered
activity of the key brain stem neurons and consequent deficiency of
norepinephrine and serotonin release by their axons in the cerebral cortex. 

<p>The biology of mania (<a href="table3.html">Table 3</a>) is less well
understood and cannot be explained by any available bioamine
(neurotransmitter) theory. The major tranquilizers widely used to treat
mania in adults block the effect of the neurotransmitter dopamine.
However, the disorder of absent dopamine, e.g., Parkinson's disease, is
not characterized by mania. due to the severe progressive motor problems
associated with the major tranquilizers, we actively avoid their use in
young people). The two most successful drugs in the treatment and
prevention of manic episodes, lithium carbonate and carba-mazepine
(Tegretol), have many different biological actions, none of which are
unique to mania. Although, right limb motor abnormalities, suggesting
left brain dysfunction, is a reproducible observation, various brain
imaging studies have been inconclusive, possibly due to heterogeneous
study populations. 

<h3><a name="concurrent"></a>Concurrent Diagnoses</h3>

<p> Concurrent diagnoses (a combination of two or more diagnoses
occurring in the same individual at the same point in time) are common in
young people with affective illness. There is a high prevalence of 
specific learning disabilities, overanxious disorder, school phobia, and
anorexia in depressed young people. Conduct disorder and oppositional
defiant disorder are common in children with hypomania, cyclothymia, or
juvenile rapid cycling bipolar disorder.


<p>It has been reported (and we concur) that 35-45% of delinquent
adolescents have affective illness prior to their incarceration for
delinquent activity. In this same context, drug-abusing,
learning-disabled adolescents frequently have had major depressive
episodes, chronic minor depression (dysthymia), or long-standing
cyclothymia prior to initiating drug abusing behavior in adolescence. It
has also been reported (and we concur) that at least 50% of the older
adolescent and young adults committing suicide, with a prior history of
drug abuse, had evidence of depression predating the abuse of drugs and
suicide.

<p>Nearly twenty years ago (1977), we reported that hyperactivity
beginning after age two years was most often symptomatic of an underlying
depression. Fifty-five percent (55%) of hyperactive pre-pubertal children
were only hyperactive when in a state of depression (<a
href="table5.html">Table 5</a>). The so-called "rebound" side effects and
vegetative symptoms (loss of appetite, insomnia) attributed to stimulant
medications used to treat hyperactive children are actually the result of
an underlying depression.

<p> The terms "hyperkinetic impulse disorder" (1950s), "minimal brain
dysfunction" (MBD;1960s), "hyper-active child syndrome" (1970s),
"attention deficit disorder with or without hyperactivity" (ADD 
with or without H; 1980s) and now "attention deficit hyperactivity
disorder" (ADHD;1990s) have successively been applied to a heterogeneous
(mixed) group of children, adolescents, and young adults whose 
clinical problem can be more correctly explained by one or more of the
following disorders: affective illness, learning disabilities, and
primary disorder of vigilance (<a href="table6.html">Table 6</a>). ADHD
is just a group of symptoms that demands more accurate evaluation and
correct diagnosis (<a href="figure1.html"><b>Figure 1</b></a>).

<p>The recently described primary disorder of vigilance (PDV) (<a
href="table7.html">Table 7</a>) is the proper diagnosis of a large group
of young people fulfilling criteria for ADHD without hyperactivity or
with only minimal hyper-activity. These young people are busy,
inattentive, and daydream while trying to stay awake due to difficulties
remaining alert (hypovigilance). The individual with primary disorder of
vigilance, when depressed, becomes excessively sleepy and can "sleep the
depres-sion off." Such individuals can go to bed for weeks, months, or
until the depression lifts. Interestingly, during a manic episode, the
individual with primary disorder of vigilance continues to have vigilance
problems ("sleepy") when trying to concentrate. 

<h3><a name="ld"></a>Learning Disabilities, Depression, and School
Failure</h3>

<p>Children, adolescents, and young adults with specific learning
disorders have a high prevalence of depression. Sixty to eighty percent
(60-80%) of learning disabled children failing in school will fulfill 
criteria for depression at the time of initial clinical evaluation.
Evaluation of individuals failing in school necessitates careful
assessment of emotions and cognition and communication skills (higher
brain functions; (<a href="table8.html">Table 8</a>), along with standard
neurologic and physical examinations. This total evaluation, including
history of the present problem, developmental, health and family
histories should take less than 90-120 minutes to complete. Too often an
evaluator takes the short-cut of only evaluating part of the young person
rather than the whole person: the evaluation for learning disability will
be omitted; affective illness will be excluded; none of the young
person's brain functions will be examined (with only a motor examination
performed); or without any examination, the determination will be made
that the environment (home or school) is the sole cause of the
difficulties; or the label ADHD suggested and a prescription of stimulant
medication offered. It is important to undertake a complete systematic
evaluation to establish correct diagnosis and develop a successful
clinical management program.

<p>For children, adolescents, and young adults with learning
disabilities, school can be an unpleasant, noxious, and highly
frustrating environment. Young people with various specific learning
disabilities often manifest poor attention, restlessness, daydreaming,
and limited diligence when asked to do tasks that they are unable to do.
It is postulated that continuous stimulation of a genetically
maldeveloped area of the cerebral hemisphere makes that area, surrounding
cerebral cortex, and homologous cerebral cortex in the opposite
hemisphere all work less well. For example, language-impaired and
dyslexic children (left hemisphere learning disability) often become
moody, irritable, and angry when asked to speak, read, or 
recall words. Poor spellers (left hemisphere learning disability),
practicing spelling for the spelling test, become increasingly dysphoric,
anxious, irritable, and dysattentive as the school year progresses. Some
will cry, show poor self-esteem and express death wishes. The repeated
attempts to perform language functions by these children stimulates
poorly functioning left cerebral hemisphere which leads to dysfunction of
the opposite right hemisphere areas with resultant depressive
symptomatology. These examples represent the interaction between
environmental stress and cerebral dysfunction.     
Right hemisphere learning-communication disorders (RHD) are characterized
by difficulties with social communication including social discomfort,
social dysemotionality, dysprosody (difficulties understanding the
gestures or speech tones of others, difficulties expressing appropriate
gesture or speech tones, or both), ordering problems (difficulties with
sequencing, timing, and context), motor and social dyspraxias
(clumsiness), disturbed attention (both hypovigilance and neglect),
difficulties with calculation  (dyscalculia for the sequencing of
numbers), and poor graphic skills (Table 8). Young people with right
hemisphere learning communication disorders, during adolescence and
adulthood, are at high risk for major depressive disorder often
exacerbated by the inappropriate stress promoted by education directed at their communication difficulties. This population can be divided into an under-expressive group (hypoprosodic; developmental expressive hypodysprosod
ia) and an over-expressive group (Asperger's Syndrome; developmental
expressive hyperdysprosodia). 

<p>In contrast, it is uncommon to see on a referred basis a pure left
hemisphere learning disability (<a hef="table8.html">Table 8</a>). Most,
if not all, children, adolescents, and young adults referred because of
school failure have evidence of bihemispheral (right and left cerebral
hemisphere) learning disorder. With sixty percent (60%) or greater of
these bihemispheral learning disabled children manifesting affective
illness, it is often the exacerbation of the affective illness that tips
the balance from marginal passing to failure. Within this context, there
are several major questions: "Why is this young person now depressed? Can
depression be induced or promoted by asking the right cerebral hemisphere
to do repetitively what it is unable to do? Is it likely that pure left
hemisphere disorders (pure 'classic' dyslexia; pure 'classic' dysphasia)
(Table 8), with no genetic basis for depression, will struggle in the
school setting but be free of depression? (Population studies of
non-referred young people suggest this interpretation). Does asking the
learning disabled individual to work repetitively at tasks he or she is
unable to do cause depression? Is there a biological basis for a
'reactive' depression?" 

<p>The multiple threshold theorem best explains induction of affective
illness. For those individuals with a high genetic load for depression
little or no environmental stressors are needed. These individuals will 
have spontaneous episodes of affective illness throughout their lives. In
contrast, for those individuals with a low genetic load, external factors
are important in the induction of a depressive or manic episode. Such
episodes can be induced by head trauma, viral encephalitis, medical
illnesses (including hyper-thyroidism, systemic lupus erythematosus, and
infectious mononucleosis), and various drugs and medications 
(including minor and major tranquilizers, anti-hypertensives, and
anti-convulsants). Inappropriate educational stress (as indicated above)
can also induce depression. Young people with specific learning 
disabilities who are failing in school and functioning poorly outside of
school must be considered to have depression until proven otherwise. The
treatment of specific learning disabilities should avoid induction of 
depression or worsening of other patterns of affective illness by
providing an appropriate educational environment. If manic or depressive
episodes occur, specific medical management should be undertaken 
(<a href="table9.html">Table 9</a>). 

<h3><a name="treatment"></a>Treatment of Depression, other Patterns<br>
of Affective Illness, and Specific Learning Disabilities </h3>

<p>Depression and other patterns of manic-depressive disease are chemical
disorders of the brain that can occur spontaneously or be promoted or
induced by other medical illnesses, drugs and medications, and
environmental events. Often the school environment is a major stressor
for the learning disabled individual. Treatment strategies for learning
disabled young people should address appropriate educational input/output
systems assuring success in school, including college preparatory and
college classes. The goal of formal education must be the acquisition and
utilization of meaningful information and the pursuit of the individual's
assets, talents, and creativity. The educator provides a structured and
disciplined environment to accomplish these goals. Reading, spelling,
numeric language, graphic skills, vocabulary, and word usage improve with
aging and maturation of the nervous system, something that cannot be
accelerated by remediation or other programs. Young people with specific
learning disabilities are willing, able, capable, and competent learners
if appropriate input/output systems are used. <a
href="table10.html">Table 10</a> summarizes the bypass/ compensatory
strategies and assistive technologies that must be implemented for the
learning disabled person to prevent the induction of affective illness
episodes.

<p>The management of children, adolescents, and young adults with
affective illness is multimodal (<a href="table9.html">Table 9</a>). They
must be informed about the nature, course, and treatment of this disease.
The environments must be supportive and r eassuring. There must be an
emphasis on positive interaction, and the individual must be assisted
with appropriate decision making. The depressed young person should not be allowed to "drop out" of usual pursuits.     

<p>Cognitive coaching on a "mini" daily basis should be offered by
parents and significant others (teachers, coaches, employers, or
friends). Cognitive coaching involves recognizing that actions should 
dictate feelings and intelligence should overrule emotions: "It is not
how one feels but it is how one acts"; "act positive-feel better"; "feel
sad and act sad, then you will be sad"; "feel sad and act happy, then you
will feel better"; "feel mad and act 
with anger, trouble!"; "feel mad and act civil, then good things can
happen". Clinical cognitive psychological counseling may be indicated for
both the individual and the primary caretakers (Wilkes and colleagues,
1994). The emphasis is for all concerned 
parties to act using intelligence and not emotions, with such interaction
being positive, rewarding, reassuring, and supportive, while
intelligently ignoring the disturbing mood or emotion. 

<p>The hallmark of successful treatment is for the brain to be free of
the "chemical imbalance" of affective illness. For this to occur, the
treatment should include appropriate medication management. Prior to
instituting antidepressant medication, it has become standard to obtain
an electrocardiogram (EKG). Complete blood count with differential, blood
chemistry profile, and thyroid profile are also often indicated
(particularly before use of antimanic drugs). An electroencephalogram
(EEG) is obtained if the person has had a seizure in the past, if there
is a positive family history for epilepsy, or prior to the use of 
antimanic drugs. Sometimes an EEG, CT scan, or MRI is indicated as a
result of abnormal neurologic findings.

<p>The drug management of depression, dysthymia, and cyclothymia with
prominent dysphoria continues to be with the first generation
antidepressants (tricyclic antidepressants) in children and young 
adolescents. The choice of drug is dependent upon the body type of the
individual and prior treatment response in family members. Amitriptyline
(Elavil) is the first choice in young people who are not overweight. If
not effective, this is followed by doxepin (Sinequan). These two
medications increase appetite and can increase weight. Imipramine
(Tofranil) followed by desipramine (Norpramin), the metabolite of
imipramine, are the first drugs in overweight young people. Nortriptyline
(Pamelor), the metabolite of amitriptyline (Elavil), is sometimes the
third choice but can also cause excessive weight gain. If the depressed
child or young adolescent does not respond to the above medications, the
third generation antidepressants are then offered. For most, we
use fluoxetine (Prozac) first, followed by sertraline (Zoloft).

<p> In mature adolescents and young adults with depression, dysthymia,
and cyclothymia with prominent dysphoria, the third generation
antidepressants are becoming the first choice rather than the tricyclic 
antidepressants. For those free of prominent hypomania or manic moods, we
prefer fluoxetine (Prozac), followed by sertaline (Zoloft) and then
either imipramine (Tofranil) (a first generation antidepressant), or 
paroxetine (Paxil). Adolescents manifesting dysthymia with bipolar
features, juvenile rapid cycling bipolar disorder, or cyclothymia are
initially offered imipramine (Tofranil) followed by sertaline (Zoloft), 
prior to antimanic medication.

<p>For successful management of depression and dysthymia in adolescents
and young adults, a combination of a third generation antidepressant and
a tricyclic is often needed. The third generation antidepressant is taken
in the morning and the tricyclic at bedtime.<p><a
href="table11.html">Table 11</a> lists the antidepressant medications,
the dosage range, serum levels, indications, contraindications, and
potential adverse effects. These medications are not approved by the FDA
for use in children less than 12 years of age, except for the use of
imipramine for bedwetting. However, they are successful in the treatment
of depression in all ages and their use has become a standard of practice.     

<p>There is a group of depressed learning disabled young people who also
have inherited the primary disorder of vigilance (<a
href="table7.html">Table 7</a>). If this group fails with the above
approach to drug management, protriptyline (Vivactil) is some
times successful. Occasionally a combination of protriptyline during
daytime hours with another tricyclic antidepressant at bedtime proves
beneficial.

<p>The treatment of mania in classic manic-depressive disease, juvenile
rapid cycling bipolar disorder, and cyclothymia will often require
antimanic drugs <a href="table12.html">(Table 12)</a>. However, we
continue to offer individuals 
with these patterns of affective illness an initial trial of
antidepressant medication. If manic symptomatology is promoted then
antimanic medication must be started. The antimanic drugs primarily 
used are carbamazepine (Tegretol) and lithium carbonate. If the manic
state is characterized primarily by hypomania and elated moods, then
lithium is the first choice. If the mania is manifested as hostile anger 
without elation, the first antirnanic drug is carbamazepine. Most
individuals whose mania is successfully controlled with lithium (or
carbamazepine) will require the addition of an antidepressant medication
to be free of depression.

<p>All the antidepressants can promote or induce mania Likewise, the
antimanic drugs can promote depression. For most depressed individuals,
an antidepressant medication will be successful. For some the 
addition of lithium or carbamazepine with the antidepressant will be
needed to achieve stable moods and good functioning.

<p>Serum medication levels are obtained during the course of treatment.
Repeat EKG, blood chemistries profile, and thyroid profile are performed
at appropriate intervals depending upon the medication being 
used and age of the patient. Frequently the young patient (and parents)
will ask: "Do I have to take medicine forever?" Our answer is 
"No." Once a well state is established for a period of 6-9 months,
medication can be tapered on a trial basis. Although affective illness is
a cyclic disorder, recurrent cycles can be expected but not anticipated
or predicted. Sometimes recurrence will be seasonal and on other
occasions associated with stressful events. If, with aging through
adolescence, the dysthymia, hypomania, cyclothymia, or rapid cycling 
bipolar disorder patterns do not stabilize, then appropriate medication
will be needed for a long period of time: "But nothing is forever."
However, individuals requiring and benefiting from lithium can anticipate
long term use of the medication.

<p>A complex issue is the treatment of attentional symptoms with the two
stimulant medications: methyl-phenidate (Ritalin) and pemoline (Cylert).
These two agents heighten vigilance and can be successfully used in the
management of the primary disorder of vigilance. They also lower the
hyperactivity of hypomania (<a href="table12.html">Table 12</a>). However,
these drugs can promote
depression. The mood disturbance ("rebound"), insomnia, and loss of
appetite associated with these two medications are symptomatic of an
underlying depression. Rarely are these two agents helpful in the
management of affectively-ill, learning-disabled young people. With aging
and freedom from depression, those with the primary disorder of vigilance
will stay busy to be alert, to learn, and to perform. If depression
occurs, appropriate antidepressant medication should lift the depression
thus restoring normal vigilance which was worsened by the depression. 

<h3><a name="summary"></a>Summary</h3>
<p>A common cause of school failure in learning disabled young people is
affective illness. Depression is generated by the right cerebral
hemisphere and manic symptoms by the left hemisphere. Affective illness
is a  genetic disorder that can present in several patterns: depression,
dysthymia, mania, hypomania, cyclothymia, juvenile rapid cycling bipolar
disorder, and classic manic-depressive disease. The treatment is
multimodal involving the use of appropriate medication in addition to
appropriate environmental (home and school) communication systems,
cognitive coaching, and counseling. Affective illness is recognizable, 
treatable, and should have a good prognosis.
