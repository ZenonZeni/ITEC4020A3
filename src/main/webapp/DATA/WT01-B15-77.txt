Most recently, the International Monetary Fund has announced that, beginning in 1997, the IMF will sell 500,000 oz. of gold per month for most of that year. The funds are being used to ease the debts of up to forty heavily impoverished third world nations. The Germans object to the sales, pointing out that huge IMF debts still exist to Russia and Mexico. Also several Central Banks (Canada is right in there) have been unloading gold positions, already depressing the gold markets. Well, you guessed it, the IMF deal isn't good for precious metals funds. With a potentially high "supply" level waiting out there in 1997, it's going to take a lot of "demand" for gold to move prices a lot higher. Of course, the IMF deal is already built into gold bullion prices. A positive surprise for prices would happen if the Germans manage to marshall enough forces to defeat the proposal. The IMF need an 85% positive agreement to swing the deal.<p>As mentioned in the Canadian comment, natural resources sectors are bottom of the monthly index survey. However the TSE 100 Resources index is still operating in a solid uptrend, even if underperforming over the past few weeks. We've just covered the gold situation. The TSE Metals index has broken down and is now trading under the multi-year trading channel. That's a sign of weakness to traders and makes me cautious on this sector. The TSE Paper and Forest Products index has made cycle lows and is slowly recovering from a long price decline.<p>The leader among the natural resources sectors is the TSE Oil and Gas index. Technically the Oil and Gas index has the potential to move from the 5500 pt level to 6700-6800 pts. After oil prices were boosted by Saddam's attacks, prices fell back as rumours of large potential supplies of Saudi crude appeared. There is also a rumour in commodities circles that Mr. Clinton is trying to keep the price of oil down going into the Presidential Elections. I saw a great cartoon of Saddam dressed as a schoolboy, writing out his hundred line punishment: "I must not threaten US oil supplies in a Presidential Election year.. I must not threaten US oil suppl..." Finally, it could be a very cold winter, driving up energy prices again. Who sez? Why, the Old Farmers Almanac, of course. </td><td> &nbsp</td><td background="../images/tbltile.gif" bgcolor=#c6d6c6 valign=top><center><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2><br><img src="../images/charts.gif" width=80 height=15><font face="Arial" size=-1><hr noshade color=#297b63></center>Note: Charts are<br>designed for full<br>screen viewing.<p><center><b><a href="charts/tse100re.gif">TSE Resource<p></a><a href="charts/tsegoldi.gif">TSE Gold<p></a><a href="charts/tsemetal.gif">TSE Metals<p></a><a href="charts/tsepaper.gif">TSE Paper<p></a><a href="charts/tseoilan.gif">TSE Oil/Gas<p></a><a href="charts/londongo.gif">London Gold<p></a></td></tr></table><p><p><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><hr noshade color=#297b63><table border=0 width=100%><tr><td align=center><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><a href="canada.html"><img src="../images/back.gif" width=55 height=16 border=0 align=left></a><a href="mutual.html"><img src="../images/next.gif" width=51 height=16 border=0 align=right></a><a href="index.html#contents"><img src="../images/contents.gif" width=106 height=16 border=0></a></td></tr></table><p><p><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><center><address><font size=-1><a href="../copyright.html">Copyright and Disclaimer</a></center><p><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><hr noshade><center><address><font size=-1><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left>Site design by <a href="http://www.compulinks.com">CompuLink Services</a>.<br><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left>Contact <a href="mailto:webmaster@compulinks.com">webmaster@compulinks.com</a> with comments.<br><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><a href="http://www.compulinks.com"><img src="../images/smllogo.gif" width=171 height=26 border=0 vspace=5 alt="CompuLink Services"></a></address></font><p><font color=#ffffff>121</center></body></html>
