May Dictate the Future of Aging </CENTER></H2>


<BLOCKQUOTE><I>Physicians like Leonard Haimes, M.D., think Human Growth Hormone might be the
Fountain of Youth because it appears to reverse or prevent many of the supposedly
inevitable signs and pains of aging.</I></BLOCKQUOTE>

The Human Growth Hormone (HGH) phenomenon is starting to catch on with physicians
nationwide. Leonard Haimes, M.D., medical director of Medicine &amp; Lifestyle-A Medical
Clinic in Boca Raton, Florida, recently devoted 6 months to a thorough review of the
research on HGH before he came on board. Now he's a complete (and enthusiastic)
believer in the effectiveness and future of the substance.

<P>&quot;Everybody wants to be younger, including myself,&quot; says Haimes, who is 67 and has
personally experienced the rejuvenative effects of HGH. &quot;I've been involved in
alternative medicine for 30 years and have seen a lot of new developments, but I
believe this one is a winner. It is extremely exciting because you are literally
creating a younger body. Ideally, everyone should take it.&quot;

<P>

Tidwell, Suite 100, Houston, TX 77092; tel: 800-460-0001. Although supplies of hGH
are somewhat limited and must be imported from Europe, there are now 23 El Dorado
clinics in the U.S. providing hGH therapy. You may also contact: E. Y. Chein, M.D.,

<P>According to Dr. Haimes, who now supervises 21 patients on HGH therapy, recent
research shows an expanding range of conditions for which HGH appears effective.
Adults who have an underactive thyroid gland are deficient in growth hormone. Yet
when such patients are given adequate HGH, they show gains in energy, muscle strength
and mass, mental abilities, and psychological attitude. 

<P>According to recent research, HGH has beneficial effects on surgical patients,
enhancing nitrogen balance and, thus, wound healing and restorative weight gain. In
fact, it is effective in treating &quot;wasting&quot; in HIV patients (severe weight and muscle
loss) enabling them to gain vital weight, according to a 2-year study of 178 AIDS
patients at 12 medical centers nationwide. 

<P>HGH appears to stimulate bone growth in cases of age-related osteoporosis; it is
helpful in cases of severe burns, trauma, and infections; and it relieves menopausal
discomfort. One of Dr. Haimes' patients, a 33-year-old man, had suffered from Chronic
Fatigue Syndrome for 3 years, yet after 20 days of HGH therapy (about 10 injections),
he was able to return to work, his symptoms alleviated.

<P>So impressive are the short-term therapeutic effects of HGH, (foremost among which
is its ability to stabilize the immune system), that these multiple applications may
one day be even more important than its use as an antiaging product, says Dr. Haimes.
While HGH therapy can cost $250 a week, there are many who regard this investment in
antiaging worth the money. (See directly below)

<BLOCKQUOTE>&quot;More energy, fewer aches and pains, and looking 10 years younger,&quot; say HGH users
Here is a sampling of testimonials from patients taking HGH at the El Dorado Clinic
in Houston, Texas.
<P>
A woman, age 88: &quot;After I used HGH for one month, I felt better than I had in a long
time. After I used it 2 months, the skin on my arms and legs flaked off and left my
skin soft and smooth.&quot;
<P>
A man, age 72, after taking HGH shots for 7 months: &quot;The first change I noticed was
that I had more energy. I now feel stronger even though I'm not on any exercise
program. Another thing is that my joints don't seem as stiff...and I'm no longer
constipated as I used to be.&quot;
<P>
An attorney in his forties: &quot;Immediately I had much more energy and stamina and I
developed a decidedly positive mental attitude.  As a result of many changes over a
6-month period, I easily look 7 to 10 years younger than my actual age.&quot;
<P>
A businesswoman, age 44: &quot;Enhancements to my life include increased energy, better
health, fewer aches and pains, loss of body fat, increase in muscle mass, more
optimistic outlook.&quot;

<P>A man, age 52, after 30 months on HGH: &quot;I sleep 5 hours a night instead of 7 and have
more energy and feel better than when I was 30 years old. I now know I can live
longer and more, healthily, and, in addition, have increased mental and physical
capacity.&quot;</BLOCKQUOTE>

  HGH is not an altered product, such as a bioengineered tomato in which the genetic
structure has been changed, Dr. Haimes explains. Rather, it is grown or duplicated
from the &quot;genetic blueprint&quot; of the naturally-occurring hormone found in the human
pituitary gland; thus it is identical to the naturally-occurring hormone.

<P>HGH seems to be quickly fulfilling the positive prognosis given it by Stanford
University medical researchers in 1992, when they wrote:  &quot;It is possible that
physiological growth hormone replacement therapy might reverse or prevent some of the
'inevitable' sequelae [related consequences] of aging.&quot; 

<P>On the plus side, growth hormone therapy (and human supplementation with other
age-related hormones such as DHEA, estrogen, and testosterone) can help allay some of
the burdens and costs of illness among the elderly, of whom more than 7 million now
need long-term medical care. On the negative side, the hotly debated safety issue
regarding estrogen replacement therapy raises a similar unanswered question about the
long-term effects of HGH and other hormone therapy. For those who might hesitate at
HGH replacement, studies show that vigorous physical activity releases more growth
hormone in people of all ages.

<P>HGH is now made by two U.S. drug companies, Eli Lilly and Genentech, technically 
only for use in cases of dwarfism. Yet in 24-36 months, it is likely that these
companies will release HGH for &quot;off-label&quot; (non-dwarfism) use to U.S. physicians,
speculates Dr. Haimes. And that should put this Fountain of Youth contender in the
reach of many.
