<STRONG>Protect Your Most Valuable Asset </STRONG><BR>
As a successful business owner, you have worked hard to reach your goals and it is
possible
that your
business has become one of your most valuable assets. But, have you considered what
would
happen
to your business and family should you unexpectedly die or become disabled?
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Do your heirs have experience operating the business on a day-to-day basis?
<LI>Would your heirs be forced to sell the business?
<LI>Would your heirs receive a fair price?
<LI>Would the IRS seek a higher valuation for your business?
</UL>
<P>
These are difficult questions to answer. You owe it to yourself and your family to
protect
your years of
hard work. At New York Life, we are dedicated to meeting your personal and
financial goals.
Through
proper planning, you can secure the continuation of your business and the financial
security
of your
heirs. 
<P>
<STRONG>How Can You Protect Your Business and Family? </STRONG><BR>
The Buy-Sell Agreement <BR>
When examining different strategies, it is important to select one that insures a
smooth
transition of
ownership and protects your family's financial future. A buy-sell agreement can
help you
accomplish
this goal. <P>
A buy-sell agreement is a contract among business owners.  At the loss of an owner,
the
business
interest is transferred according to the terms of this contract. The other owner(s)
are
obligated to
purchase the deceased's business interest and the deceased's heirs are obligated to
sell. 
Just look
at what a buy-sell agreement can do:<P>
Your Heirs:<BR>
<UL>
<LI>Are free of business worries and guaranteed to receive a fair price for the
sale of the
business
interest.
<LI>May help avoid some of the delays associated with probate.
</UL>

Surviving Owners:	
<UL> 
<LI>Will not have to worry about new and possibly unwanted partners.
<LI>Know the purchase price of the business beforehand.
<LI>Remain in good standing with clients and creditors through a smooth transition
of
ownership.
Simply put, a properly funded buy-sell agreement will benefit your family,
surviving owners
and
creditors. 
</UL>
<P>

<STRONG>Methods of Funding Available</STRONG><BR>

<P>
<STRONG>Option 1: Wait and Pay Cash</STRONG> <BR>
In this option, surviving owner(s) use cash at the death of a co-owner to fund the
buy-sell
agreement.
But, several drawbacks to this method exist.
<P>
<UL>
<LI>At death, funds may not be readily available for payment.
<LI>A savings plan accumulates funds over time. What if funds are needed tomorrow?
<LI>Will a savings plan be depleted to pay for unforeseen expenses?
<LI>Accumulation of cash may cause an accumulated earnings tax problem.
</UL>
<P>
<STRONG>Option 2: Wait and Borrow Funds</STRONG><BR>
In this option, surviving owner(s) borrow funds, usually bank loans, at the death
of a
co-owner to fund
the buy-sell agreement. But, much like the first option, this method has drawbacks.
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Future growth may be slowed due to an increase in expenses (repayment of loan).
<LI>Death of an owner may cause sales to decline, compounding the problem.
<LI>Death of an owner may make it difficult to receive a loan.
<LI>A surviving owner may have to sign for funds, exposing personal assets.
<LI>Surviving owners pay dollar for dollar plus interest for the deceased's
outstanding share
of the
business. 
</UL>
<P>
<STRONG>Option 3: Insurance: The Smart Choice</STRONG><BR>
Purchasing insurance can be the most cost effective funding option for a buy-sell
agreement.
Using
insurance as a funding vehicle will provide the following benefits:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Immediate availability of proceeds when death or disability occurs.
<LI>The funds used to buy the deceased's share are purchased for pennies on the
dollar.
<LI>Death benefit proceeds are generally income 
tax free.
<LI>Premiums may be significantly lower than the cost of repaying the loan
interest.
</UL>
<P>

<STRONG>The Types of Buy-Sell Plans Available</STRONG><BR>
What Will A Buy-Sell Agreement Accomplish?	
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Creates a market for the stock.
<LI>Sets a predetermined price at which owners 
   agree to buy and sell their shares.
<LI>Provides money to fund the plan.
</UL>
<P>

<STRONG>Cross Purchase Plan</STRONG><BR>
In this plan, owners enter into an agreement with one another. To fund this plan,
each owner
applies
for, owns, and pays the life insurance premiums on the other owners.
<p>
<IMG SRC="/nyl/images/pscpbs.gif" ALT="Diagram" ALIGN=RIGHT BORDER="0">
<p>

When an owner dies:	
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Life insurance proceeds are paid to the surviving owner(s) income tax free.
<LI>Proceeds are used to purchase the heirs' business interest.
<LI>Heirs receive an agreed-upon payment for their business interest.
<LI>Surviving owner(s) receive an increased cost basis for the acquired business
interest. 
</UL>
<P>

<STRONG>Entity Plan</STRONG> <BR>
In this plan, owners enter into an agreement with the business. The business
applies for,
owns, and
pays the life insurance premiums on each owner.<P>
When an owner dies:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>The business will receive the life insurance proceeds.
<LI>The business uses the proceeds to purchase the deceased's business interest.
<LI>Heirs receive an agreed-upon price for their business interest.
</UL>
<P>
<STRONG>Stock Redemption Plan</STRONG> <BR>
A stock redemption plan is an agreement between the business and its shareholders.
The
corporation
applies for, owns, and pays the life insurance premiums on each shareholder.
<P>
When a shareholder dies:<P>
<UL>
<LI>The corporation will receive the life insurance proceeds.
<LI>The corporation will use the proceeds to purchase the shareholder's outstanding
stock.
<LI>Heirs receive an agreed-upon price for the shareholder's outstanding stock.
</UL>
<P>
<STRONG>Wait and See Plan</STRONG> <BR>
This buy-sell agreement provides an added level of flexibility, providing the
advantages of
the cross
purchase and entity plans.<P>
<UL>
<LI>The owner and the company form an agreement.
<LI>The surviving owners/company have the option to purchase the deceased's
business
interest.
<LI>If the option is not exercised, the other party is obligated to purchase the
interest.
<LI>Funding the agreement is usually the obligation of the party who has the first
option.
<LI>If necessary, loans between the two can be used to help a party who is
underfunded.
</UL>
