<H3>NEW PUBLICATION SHOWCASES COMMUNITIES'<BR>
EXPERIENCE WITH SUSTAINABILITY<P>
</H3>
	A new publication produced jointly by the U. S. Department of Energy and Public Technology, Inc. (PTI) showcases experiences communities across the country are having with sustainable development.<P>
	"Cities and Counties: Thinking Globally, Acting Locally" contains 10 detailed case studies showing how communities are facing such challenges as air and water pollution, traffic congestion, urban sprawl and decreased quality of life without sacrificing economic development.  Among the many solutions outlined are home energy loan programs, solar access laws, outdoor lighting standards and eco-industrial parks in communities across the nation, including Austin, Tex.; Boulder, Colo.; Chattanooga; Metro-Dade County, Fla.; Philadelphia; Phoenix; Portland; San Jose; Northampton County, Va. and Chittenden County, Vt.<P>


	Sustainable development is a strategy through which communities seek economic development approaches that also benefit the local environment and quality of life.<P>
	"Sustainable development allows economic progress and environmental quality to be compatible goals," said Christine Ervin, DOE assistant secretary for energy efficiency and renewable energy.  "Communities are finding that sustainable development strategies save taxpayer money, improve the profits of local businesses and make the community much more liveable."<P>
	According to PTI President Costis Toregas, advances in building, recycling and conservation technology are putting the goals of sustainability within easy reach of most communities.  "New technological breakthroughs allow local governments to more effectively conserve and safeguard energy and natural resources," Toregas said.  "By those actions--not in spite of them--cities and counties can tone their economic muscle in an increasingly competitive world, and leave future generations the asset base necessary for their prosperity."<P>



	Printed copies of the publication are available for purchase through the PTI Publications Center by calling (301) 490-2188 or faxing requests to (301) 604-0158.  Copies also may be downloaded from the home page for DOE's Center of Excellence for Sustainable Development at "http://www.sustainable.doe.gov".<P>
	The Center of Excellence offers information and technical advice to help communities become more energy-efficient and environmentally sound.  In addition to the home page, interested communities can contact the center toll-free at (800) 357-7732 for other information about sustainable development.<P>
	PTI is the nonprofit, technology research and development organization of the National League of Cities, National Association of Counties and International City/County Management Association.  Now in its 25th year, PTI is dedicated to creating and advancing technology-based services and products in local and state government and is committed to sustainable development.
