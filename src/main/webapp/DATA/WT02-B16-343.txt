<H1>Solar Water Heating</H1>
<I>Well-Proven Technology Pays Off in Several Situations</I>
<P>
<IMG SRC="images/pic1.gif">

<H2>Abstract</H2>
 Solar water heating is a renewable energy technology
that is well proven and readily available and has considerable
potential for application at federal facilities. Solar water-heating
systems can be used effectively throughout the country and most
facilities will have an appropriate near-south-facing roof or
nearby unshaded grounds for installation of a collector. A variety
of types of systems are available and suitable for many applications.
For example, low-temperature unglazed systems can heat swimming
pools and associated hot tubs or spas, saving money on conventional
heating or extending the swimming season. In mild climates, passive
systems without pumps or electronic controllers can provide low-maintenance
hot water for facilities with limited or expensive utility service.
High-temperature parabolic-trough systems can economically provide
hot water to jails, hospitals, and other facilities in areas with
good solar resources that consistently use large volumes of hot
water. And active flat-plate systems can service any facility
in any area with electric or otherwise expensive conventional
water heating. 
<P>
This Federal Technology Alert (FTA) of the New
Technology Demonstration Program, one of a series of guides to
renewable energy and new energy-efficient technologies, is designed
to give federal facility managers the information they need to
decide whether they should pursue solar water heating for their
facility and to know how to go about doing so. Software available
from FEMP's Federal Renewables Program at the National Renewable
Energy Laboratory (303-384-7509) gives a preliminary analysis
of whether solar water heating would be cost effective for your
situation on the basis of a minimal number of data.
<P>
This FTA describes
the main types of solar water-heating systems available and discusses
some of the factors that make the various types more or less appropriate
for particular situations. It also points out the types of situations
where solar water heating is most likely to be cost effective
and gives examples for each of those situations. In addition,
this FTA outlines the basics of selecting, evaluating, procuring,
funding and maintaining a solar water-heating system. Sidebars
highlight indicators that a system will be effective, tips for
ensuring successful operation, and pointers for determining system
data. A case study for a National Park Service facility includes
economic evaluation data and bid specifications. References include
solar water-heating collector manufacturers and system distributors
and contacts for federal facilities that are using solar water
heating.

<A NAME="about"><H2>About the Technology</H2></A>
<P>
An estimated one million residential
and 200,000 commercial solar water-heating systems have been installed
in the United States. Although there are a large number of different
types of solar water-heating systems, the basic technology is
very simple. Sunlight strikes and heats an "absorber"
surface within a "solar collector" or an actual storage
tank. Either a heat-transfer fluid or the actual potable water
to be used flows through tubes attached to the absorber and picks
up the heat from it. (Systems with a separate heat-transfer-fluid
loop include a heat exchanger that then heats the potable water.)
The heated water is stored in a separate preheat tank or a conventional
water heater tank until needed. If additional heat is needed,
it is provided by electricity or fossil-fuel energy by the conventional
water-heating system. By reducing the amount of heat that must
be provided by conventional water-heating, solar water-heating
systems directly substitute renewable energy for conventional
energy, reducing the use of electricity or fossil fuels by as
much as 80%.
<P>
Today's solar water-heating systems are well proven
and reliable when correctly matched to climate and load.  The
current market consists of a relatively small number of manufacturers
and installers that provide reliable equipment and quality system
design. A quality assurance and performance rating program for
solar water-heating systems, instituted by a voluntary association
of the solar industry and various consumer groups, makes it easier
to select reliable equipment with confidence. After taking advantage
of possible use-reduction measures (see the First Things First sidebar below), federal
facility managers should investigate installing solar water-heating
systems.

As a rule, conservation is the most cost-effective way to reduce
water-heating bills. For example, a low-flow showerhead costing $9 saves $22
for 275 kWh of energy per year for a five-month payback. Other examples
of hot-water saving measures include faucet aerators, timed or
optical-sensor faucets, water-saving clothes washers, dishwashers or other appliances,
water heater insulation, lower-setting or timed water heaters,
and swimming pool covers. These energy efficiency measures are all
compatible with solar water heating, and often reduce the size of the systems
needed. Reducing hot-water use saves on water and sewage as well
as energy. For more information, ask the FEMP Help Line (800-DOE-EREC)
about the Water Conservation Program.</TD>

<H3>Application Domain</H3>
<P>
Water heating accounts for a substantial
portion of energy use at many federal facilities. Nationwide,
approximately 18% of energy use in residential buildings and 4%
in commercial buildings is for water heating. Federal facilities
with large laundries, kitchens, showers, or swimming pools will
likely devote even more energy to water heating. Solar water heating
systems can efficiently provide up to 80% of the hot-water needs
of many federal buildings&#151;without fuel cost or pollution and with
minimal operation and maintenance expense.
<P>
Solar water-heating
systems are most likely to be cost effective for facilities with
water-heating systems that are expensive to operate or with operations
such as laundries or kitchens that require large quantities of
hot water. A need for hot water that is relatively constant throughout
the week and throughout the year, or that is higher in the summer,
is also helpful for solar water-heating economics. On the other
hand, hard water is a negative factor, particularly for certain
types of solar water-heating systems, because it can increase
maintenance costs and cause those systems to wear out prematurely.
<P>
Solar water heating can be used effectively throughout the country.
The dominant factor in determining effectiveness for solar water
heating is the available solar resource (see <A HREF="sw_figures.html#fig1">Figure 1</A> and <A HREF="sw_figures.html#fig2">Figure 2</A>),
but do not dismiss the possibility of using solar water heating
because the facility is in a cloudy area. Other factors are also
quite important and solar water heating works better than might
be expected in areas with lesser solar resources. Cold water supply
temperatures (see <A HREF="sw_figures.html#fig3">Figure 3</A> and <A HREF="sw_appends.html#appenda">Appendix A</A>) increase system efficiency
because until the fluid being heated reaches higher temperatures,
it loses less heat to the surroundings. Cold air temperatures
hurt solar water-heating performance by increasing loss of heat
from the collectors to the air. <A HREF="sw_figures.html#fig4">Figure 4</A> shows the performance
that can be expected by average and good solar collectors, respectively,
in various parts of the country.
<P>
<H3>Benefits</H3>
<P>
By tapping available renewable
energy, solar water heating reduces consumption of conventional
energy that would otherwise be used. Each unit of energy delivered
to heat water with a solar heating system yields an even greater
reduction in use of fossil fuels.  Water heating by natural gas,
propane, or fuel oil is only about 60% efficient and although
electric water heating is about 90% efficient, the production
of electricity from fossil fuels is generally only 30% or 40%
efficient. Reducing fossil fuel use for water heating not only
saves stocks of the fossil fuels, but eliminates the air pollution
and climate change gas emission associated with burning those
fuels.
<P>

<TR>
<TD><H3>Recent Track Record Excellent</H3>
The majority of existing solar water-heating systems were installed
in the 1980s when private parties were eligible for a 40% federal
residential energy tax credit or a 15% business energy tax credit
incentive. (There is currently only a 10% business energy tax
credit.) Although solar water heating had certainly already been around
for a while, there was not yet a mature industry prepared to handle
large-volume sales and installation. In the rush to take advantage of sales
spurred by the tax incentives, many systems were poorly designed or installed
or inadequately maintained. This earned solar water heating a
bad reputation that is not deserved by today's industry. Solar water-heating
systems are now well proven, installers are highly professional,
and the industry has demonstrated an excellent track record in recent
years. (See <A HREF="sw_supplier.html#suppliers">"Suppliers"</A> for a list of manufacturers
of collectors and distributors of systems.) With careful selection
of the right system for a particular situation, today's solar
water-heating installations are largely free of problems.
<P>
Although some solar water-heating systems from the 1980s were
not as well designed or installed as they should have been, the majority
are still delivering energy with little or no maintenance. A 1992
survey of 185 residential systems in Colorado, for example, found
that 65% of the systems were functioning properly and that half
of those with problems could be repaired for less than $150. The
1980s was also the most active period at federal facilities with 718
systems installed during or shortly after 1981 through the Solar in Federal
Buildings Program. If you have an older existing system&#151;functioning
or non-functioning&#151;it would be well worthwhile to have it examined
for possible improvements or reactivation.</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
<P>
<H3>Energy-Saving Mechanism</H3>
<P>
Although solar water-heating systems
all use the same basic method for capturing and transferring solar
energy, they do so with such a wide variety of specific technologies
that one almost needs to learn a whole language of terms for distinguishing
different collectors and systems. The distinctions are important
though, because various water-heating needs in various locations
are best served by certain types of collectors and systems. Systems
can be either active or passive, direct or indirect, pressurized
or nonpressurized.  (<I>Note:</I>  the terms open-loop and closed-loop
are frequently used to distinguish between direct and indirect
systems, but technically their meaning is more equivalent to nonpressurized
and pressurized. To avoid confusion, we will not use them here.)
<P>
<STRONG>Types of Systems</STRONG>
<P>
The most frequently used systems for large facilities,
<I>antifreeze</I> systems, are active, indirect systems. <I>Active</I> solar
water-heating systems use pumps to circulate a heat-transfer fluid
between the collector and the storage tank. <I>Indirect</I> active systems
use a heat exchanger to transfer heat from the circulating fluid
to the potable water. Antifreeze systems circulate a non-toxic
fluid, usually propylene glycol, through the collector. See <A HREF="sw_figures.html#fig5">Figure
5</A> or <A HREF="sw_appends.html#appendh">Appendix H</A>.
<P>
Even in freezing climates, however, water is often
the heat-transfer fluid of choice. This is because water has excellent
heat-transfer properties, it is noncorrosive and highly stable,
and it is less expensive. The need to prevent the system from
freezing is, of course, the trade-off for using water as the heat-transfer
fluid. The <I>drain-back</I> system does this by totally draining the
heat-transfer fluid out of the collector loop whenever the pump
is off, which is whenever the water in the collector is not hot
enough to heat the potable water, and therefore also whenever
there is any freeze danger. See <A HREF="sw_figures.html#fig6">Figure 6</A> or <A HREF="sw_appends.html#appendi">Appendix I</A>. In contrast
to most indirect systems, which are <I>pressurized,</I> many drain-back
systems use a <I>nonpressurized</I> heat-transfer-fluid loop. Nonpressurized
systems may use plastic or site-built tanks that are less expensive
and more durable than pressurized metal tanks. Evaporated water
must be replaced and being open to the air poses greater corrosion
potential, but for a large system there may be significant savings
with a nonpressurized tank.
<P>
<I>Direct</I> active systems run the potable
water to be consumed directly through the collector. Because they
do not require a heat exchanger, they average 5%-10% greater efficiency,
but they must, in turn, activate special mechanisms to prevent
the system from freezing. When control systems sense potential
freeze conditions, valves on <I>drain-down</I> systems shut the service
water off from the collector loop water and allow the collector
loop water to drain out into a sump or down a drain. <I>Recirculating</I>
systems respond to freeze danger by pumping heated water through
the collection loop. Although freezing problems have been documented
with both of these direct systems in the past, a newly designed
valve for the former and careful choice of the right situations
to use the latter may prevent those problems. Hard water is particularly
troublesome for direct systems, because scale deposits that form
in the collectors can reduce efficiency, increase the likelihood
of freeze damage by restricting flow, and eventually shut down
a system. 
<P>
For smaller systems in mild climates with modest freeze
threat, <I>passive</I> systems are also a viable option. Passive systems
do not require pumps or electronic controls, greatly simplifying
operation and maintenance, making passive systems very attractive
for certain situations. These are, in fact, the most commonly
used system types in climates with modest freeze threat.  However,
because they usually store water outside at or near the collector,
these systems are subject to greater heat loss. In cold climates
particularly, this heat loss reduces the efficiency of the system
in terms of the percentage of the solar energy originally absorbed
that is eventually used.
<P>
 Of the two main types of passive systems,
<I>integrated collector systems</I> (ICS) store the heated water inside
the collector itself. <I>Thermosiphon</I> systems have a separate storage
tank directly above the collector. In direct thermosiphon systems,
the heated water rises from the collector to the tank and cool
water from the tank sinks back into the collector. In indirect
thermosiphon systems, heated antifreeze rises from the collector
to an outer tank that surrounds the potable water storage tank
and acts as a heat exchanger (be sure meets any code stipulations
about double-wall heat exchangers for separation from potable
water). See <A HREF="sw_figures.html#fig7">Figure 7</A> or <A HREF="sw_appends.html#appendj">Appendix J</A>. In both ICS and thermosiphon
systems, good insulation of the collector or tank helps prevent
freezing and heat loss at night. The critical links, however,
are the pipes connecting the collector or tank to the service
water inside the house. Depending on pipe size and insulation,
they can withstand temperatures that are only so far below freezing
for only so long, so the geographic areas where these passive
systems may be safely used must be carefully calculated. Hard
water is again a concern. Also, most roofs will support the substantial
weight of the water storage, but this consideration cannot be
ignored in adding a system to an existing structure or in designing
a new facility.
<P>
<STRONG>Types of Collectors</STRONG>
<P>
The principal component of a
solar water-heating system&#151;the collector&#151;can be low-temperature,
mid-temperature, or high-temperature. The <I>glazed, flat-plate</I> collectors
most commonly used for commercial or residential domestic hot
water are classified as <I>"mid-temperature"</I> collectors,
generally increasing water temperature to as much as 160&#176;F
(71&#176;C).  As shown in <A HREF="sw_figures.html#fig8">Figure 8,</A> flat-plate collectors consist
of an insulated, weather-tight housing or box, a clear glass or
plastic cover glazing, a black absorber plate, and a system of
passages for the heat-transfer fluid to pass through the collector.
Special coatings on the absorber maximize absorption of sunlight
and minimize re-radiation of heat. Gaskets and seals at the connections
between the piping and the collector and around the glazing ensure
a water-tight system.
<P>
<I>"Low-temperature"</I> collectors, which
generally increase water temperature to as much as 90&#176;F (32&#176;C),
are less expensive because they consist simply of an absorber
with flow passages and have no covering glass (glazing), insulation,
or expensive materials such as aluminum or copper. These collectors
are less efficient in retaining solar energy when outdoor temperatures
are low, but are quite efficient when outside air temperatures
are close to the temperature to which the water is being heated.
They are highly suitable for swimming pool heating and other uses
that require only a moderate increase in temperature and are most
commonly used in warmer areas. For the last several years, they
have been the most frequently installed collectors. In warm climates,
low-temperature collectors are sometimes used in hybrid systems
that heat a pool in the winter and supplement domestic water-heating
in the summer, when pool heating is not needed.
<P>
Large federal facilities
or ones with quasi-industrial operations such as laundries may
be able to efficiently use more sophisticated <I>high-temperature</I>
collectors. Although they are also used in mid-temperature systems,
<I>evacuated-tube</I> collectors can be designed to increase water/steam
temperatures to as much as 350&#176;F (177&#176;C). They may use
a variety of configurations, but generally encase both the absorber
surface and the tubes of working fluid in a tubular glass vacuum
for highly efficient insulation. See <A HREF="sw_figures.html#fig9">Figure 9.</A> Evacuated-tube
collectors are the most efficient collector type for cold climates
with low-level diffuse sunlight. They can be mounted either on
a roof or on the ground, but they need to be protected from vandalism
and can be damaged by hail or hurricanes.
<P>
<I>Parabolic-trough</I> collectors
use curved mirrors to focus the sunlight on a receiver tube (sometimes
encased in an evacuated tube) running through the focal point
of the mirrors and can heat their transfer fluid to as much as
570&#176;F (299&#176;C). See <A HREF="sw_figures.html#fig10">Figure 10.</A> Because they use only
direct-beam sunlight, parabolic-trough systems require tracking
systems to keep them focused toward the sun and are best suited
to areas with high direct solar radiation. See <A HREF="sw_figures.html#fig2">Figure 2.</A> Because
they are particularly susceptible to transmitting structural stress
from wind loading and require large areas for installation, parabolic-trough
collectors are usually ground mounted. For electrical generation
or industrial uses that require very high temperatures (greater
than 392&#176;F [200&#176;C]), a heat-transfer fluid such as an
oil is used, but depending on the degree of danger of freezing,
antifreeze or water is used in the heat-transfer loop for domestic
water-heating systems. Parabolic-trough collectors generally require
greater maintenance and supervision and particularly benefit from
economies of scale, so are generally used for larger systems.
<P>
<H3>System Design</H3>
<P>
System design for solar water-heating systems seeks to effectively
combine solar water-heating with conventional water-heating. Rather
than trying to store enough hot water to last through a long period
of cloudy weather, solar water-heating systems generally have
conventional water-heating systems as backup. Exceptions, such
as the Chickasaw National Recreation Area systems cited later
as a case study, are situations in which a lack of hot water for
a few days is acceptable and the expense of conventional backup
is not justified. Typically, a conventional hot-water heater draws
preheated water from the solar water-heating system storage tank.
If that preheated water is not hot enough, the conventional water
heater operates as it would if it were starting with cold water
and further heats the water until it reaches its set delivery
temperature. Occasionally, the solar-heated water (up to 180&#176;F
[82&#176;C]) is too hot for safe use, so it is mixed with cold
water in a tempering valve.
<P>
As shown in <A HREF="sw_figures.html#fig5">Figure 5,</A> a typical active,
indirect solar water-heating system consists of one or more parallel-connected
glazed flat-plate collectors, a storage tank, a heat exchanger,
piping and valves for the heat-transfer fluid and for the potable
water, pumps, and controls. Whenever the temperature of the water
in the collector exceeds that of the stored water by more than
a certain amount (usually about 12&#176;F [6&#176;C]), the "controller"
(a) turns on both pumps (b and c). The heat-transfer-fluid system
pump (b) circulates heated antifreeze from the collectors to the
heat exchanger (where it transfers heat to the potable water)
and back to the collectors. The potable water system pump (c)
circulates cool water from the bottom of the storage tank to the
heat exchanger for heating and then back to the top of the storage
tank. (Instead of having a separate heat exchanger unit, the heat-transfer
fluid may "wrap around" the potable water storage tank
either with piping or with a surrounding outer tank.) As water
is used from the conventional hot-water tank, it is replaced by
solar-heated water from the top of the storage tank. Inlet water
from the domestic supply system flows into the bottom of the storage
tank to keep the system full.
<P>
Alternatively, a single storage tank
may be used. A common single-tank design disconnects the heating
element(s) from the lower portion of a conventional electric water
heater. When the solar water-heating system is operating, it draws
cold water from the bottom of the tank and returns the heated
water to the top. If the solar heating does not have the water
hot enough, the conventional heating elements in the top of the
tank bring the water up to the desired temperature. Although not
used much in this country, another single-tank design uses a rapid
booster or "tankless" heater in the water line as it
leaves the tank to provide additional heating upon demand, if
needed. This option avoids maintaining the whole tank at the desired
temperature as most conventional water heaters do, minimizing
standby losses. Some two-tank systems add a second direct pipe
connection with appropriate check valves between the two tanks
to increase heat flow from the solar storage tank to the conventional
tank. If the solar storage tank is hotter than the conventional
water service tank, hot water flows by convection into the service
tank, even when there is no draw on the system.
<P>
The most cost-effective
size for a solar water-heating system will often be one that is
just sufficient to meet the full summer demand and that meets
approximately two-thirds of the year-round demand. Including enough
capacity to meet more of the winter demand reduces cost-effectiveness
both because excess capacity is wasted in the summer and because
it is increasingly difficult to serve each additional portion
of the winter demand with the reduced solar resource. The most
cost-effective size can vary widely with specific circumstances,
however, and for commercial building systems especially, it is
sometimes best to plan to supply considerably less than two-thirds
of hot-water use. The key factors in determining the most cost-effective
size for a system are the type and cost of conventional fuel and
the cost of the solar water-heating system to be installed.

<P>
Good
records of past hot-water use help greatly to plan an effective
solar water-heating system, and it is easy to install a water
meter on the incoming line to a hot-water heater. Water use can
vary quite substantially, but for new construction, or if your
uses of hot water are relatively "standard," there are
"rules of thumb" to estimate hot-water requirements
for various building uses. The handbook guideline for residential
use, for example, is 20 to 30 gallons per person or 65 gallons
per household per day. (Note, however, that some more recent studies
have found average use as low as 25-35 gallons per household per
day.) For office buildings, you can expect hot-water use of 0.5
gallon per person per day. (The standard reference for projecting
hot-water use is the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating,
and Air-Conditioning Engineers, Inc. [ASHRAE] <I>Applications Handbook,</I>
Chapter 44.)
<P>
The circumstances for specific large facilities may
vary considerably, but for small systems, a general rule of thumb
is to have storage roughly equal to one day's hot-water use. In
a location with average available solar energy, you will need
approximately 0.5 to 1.0 square feet of flat-plate collector per
gallon of storage tank. The daily pattern and consistency of hot-water
consumption is also an important consideration for determining
the size of collector and storage area needed.  Uses that demand
hot water mostly during the day (laundries, lunch service, or
car washes, for example) will require relatively less storage
than uses such as showers for which the heaviest demand occurs
at night or early in the morning.
<H3>Installation</H3>
Solar collectors
can be mounted on the roof of a building or on nearby grounds.
For year-round uses, the most efficient orientation for the collector
is facing south, tilted at an angle about equal to the latitude
of the site. (The latitude plus 15&#176; maximizes wintertime
heat collection and latitude minus 15&#176; maximizes summertime
heat collection.) Collectors can be tilted to the proper orientation
with mounting racks. For cost savings and aesthetic reasons, however,
they are increasingly being laid flat against pitched roofs. If
the orientation is at all close to optimal, the sacrifice in available
energy is usually quite modest. For Denver, Colorado, for example,
with a tilt of latitude minus 15&#176;, mounting the collectors
as much as 45&#176; off of southern orientation loses at most
10% of available solar energy. Similarly, with a true southern
orientation, you can mount collectors at up to 25&#176; off latitude
tilt with only 10% loss. Solar resource information for Boulder,
Colorado, is presented in <A HREF="sw_appends.html#appendb">Appendix B</A> as an example of available
data.

Incorporating solar water-heating systems in new construction
has the advantages of ensuring that there is an appropriate roof
for collector placement, allowing for aesthetic design, and reducing
installation costs. If the builder, architect, or engineer is
used to working with solar water-heating, it can also save on
design cost. But, almost any building can incorporate a solar
collector retrofit. It is relatively easy to add a solar water-heating
system to an existing facility and the economics will be nearly
as good.
<P>
There are generally relatively few special regulations
to consider in installing solar water-heating systems, but there
are pertinent building, mechanical, and plumbing codes. Areas
with special building regulations because of earthquake or hurricane
danger, might have structural requirements limiting the weight
or type of equipment that can be placed on a roof. Some local
codes for residential or commercial areas regulate the attachment
of collectors to roofs or walls. A few jurisdictions require rigorous
separation between the heat-transfer fluid and the potable water
in closed-loop systems that could rule out single-wall heat exchangers.
Besides regulations such as these, systems need only comply with
standard plumbing and local building codes.
<P>
Numerous manufacturers
make quality solar collectors and solar water-heating systems.
In addition to checking out the various manufacturers, one way
to ensure that your system meets generally applied standards is
to install an Solar Rating and Certification Corporation (SRCC)-certified
system. An independent, nonprofit
organization created by organizations representing solar equipment
manufacturers, state governments, and consumers, the SRCC has instituted a quality
assurance and performance rating program.  As of December 1995,
the SRCC had certified three unglazed collectors and 60 glazed flat-plate
collectors made by a total of 12 different manufacturers, plus
78 total solar water-heating systems made by 12 different manufacturers.
The SRCC certification process also ensures that health and safety
issues have been addressed, that typical code provisions are complied
with, and that durability and reliability standards have been
met and are correctly portrayed. There, of course, may be collectors
and systems of acceptable quality that have not been rated by
SRCC.

system manufacturers was not available, but <A HREF="sw_supplier.html#suppliers">"Suppliers"</A>

<H3>Technology Screening Process</H3>
<P>
The Federal
Technology Alert (FTA) series targets technologies that appear
to have significant untapped federal-sector potential and for
which some federal installation experience exists. Many of the
alerts are about new technologies identified through advertisements
for technology suggestions in the <I>Commerce Business Daily</I> and
trade journals, and through direct correspondence in response
to an open technology solicitation. Those technologies are then
evaluated in terms of potential energy, cost, and environmental
benefits to the federal sector.
<P>
Solar water heating is a renewable
energy technology with clearly known energy, cost, and environmental
benefits, and a large number of manufacturers of a variety of
products&#151;but still with substantial untapped potential for the
federal sector. Solar water heating was selected for the New Technology
Demonstration Program through response to the open technology
solicitation.
<H3>Estimated Market Potential</H3>
The Office of Technology
Assessment reported in 1991 that the U.S. Government owns or leases
approximately 500,000 buildings, owns an additional 422,000 housing
units for military families, and subsidizes utility bills for
nine million private households.  If the objective were to reduce
fossil fuel energy use and associated pollution, regardless of
cost-effectiveness, the potential application of solar water heating
would clearly be immense.  Even limiting application to cost-effective
situations, opportunities for solar water heating may still be
quite substantial. Combining the large number of military and
other housing units with the fact that 18% of residential energy
use is for water heating and an Energy Information Administration
statement that 38% of U.S. residential water heating is electric,
points to a very large potential application for small systems
where economics are likely to be attractive. Federal prisons,
hospitals, and barracks are ideal situations for large, high-temperature
systems to prove cost effective. An estimate of the number of
swimming pools at federal facilities is not available, but there
are certainly a significant number and the likelihood of solar
pool heating being cost effective is quite good.

The cost of operating conventional or backup

Some examples of recently installed
or planned small solar water-heating systems for federal facilities
include a system for the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
headquarters offices in Washington, D.C., three systems for an
environmental education center in the Phoenix, Arizona, area,
and three systems for a National Park Service national recreation
area in Oklahoma. The 480 square foot active, indirect system recently
installed to serve the privately owned building housing the EPA
headquarters will provide 71% of the demand for hot water (approximately
1150 gallons/day), saving $2,656 annually in electricity. System
costs were shared by EPA and the DOE Solar Process Heat Program.
With a 10% federal tax credit to the building owner, plus a rebate
from the local electric utility because the system reduces peak
demand, the system will pay for itself (simple payback) in 6 to
7 years.
<P>
Three small drainback systems will be part of new Bureau
of Reclamation facilities in Lake Pleasant, Arizona. The Bureau
is building a classroom building and two dormitories, which it
will lease to the Maricopa County Outdoor Education Center (OEC).
The classroom building includes a cafeteria and the dormitories
will house 50 students each. The Bureau plans to use solar waterheating
systems for each of the three buildings at this remote site, not
only to reduce the cost of water heating but also to serve as
an educational tool for students. The OEC will be an all-electric
facility except for propane for auxiliary water heating. The system
for the classroom building has 70 square feet of collector and
120 gallons of water storage and will meet 64% of the waterheating
load. It will save 17,800 kBtu/yr. The systems for each dormitory
have 145 square feet of collectors and 240 gallons of water storage.
The dormitory systems will meet 45% of the annual load and each
save 34,300 kBtu/yr.
<P>
A third example is currently being designed
by the National Park Service for the Chickasaw National Recreation
Area in Oklahoma. Three solar water-heating systems are expected
to cost $35,000 and have a simple payback of 9 years. The systems
will have no backup system, must be designed to shut down for
winter and quickly start up in the spring, and must have very
high reliability because of the remote location and the lack of
operation and maintenance staff. See <A HREF="#case">"Case Study&#151;Chickasaw National Recreation Area"</A> for a complete description and <A HREF="sw_supplier.html#whois">"Who Is Using the Technology"</A> for contacts regarding particular projects.

</TABLE>
<P>
<H3>Where to Apply&#151;Small Facilities</H3>
For small
federal facility projects, the cost of conventional water-heating
systems dominates the economic feasibility of solar water-heating
systems. As can be seen from <A HREF="sw_tables.html#table1">Table
1,</A> the cost of conventional
energy varies greatly. Note that these figures are national averages
and utility rates vary greatly by region and individual facility
contract. There may be regions in which the relative effective
energy cost of the various energy supplies differs from that below.
<A HREF="sw_tables.html#table2">Table 2</A> shows average
utility rates by region. Water heater efficiencies
also vary significantly, particularly for larger heaters, from
77% to 97% for electric and from 43% to 86% for gas. You should
therefore also investigate the cost effectiveness of buying a
more efficient water heater either on its own or in conjunction
with installation of a solar water-heating system.
<P>
The cost of
solar water-heating systems can vary widely depending upon the
circumstances for a specific installation, region of the country,
and other factors and are not generally available as published
numbers. To get a ballpark idea, however, we can look at four
residential-size systems approved by the Sacramento Municipal
Utility District for its electrical-demand-reduction incentive
program. The four systems are a 42-square-foot indirect thermosiphon
system, an evacuated-tube integrated collector system, a 64-square-foot
antifreeze system, and a 40-square-foot antifreeze system that
uses a "wraparound" heat exchanger so it needs only
one pump instead of two. The systems vary in cost from $2,860
to $3,180 and from meeting 61% to 74% of an assumed 57-gallon-per-day
demand (averages 8.8 MBtu per year delivered energy). If we assume
20-year continuous operation and 0.5% per year operation and maintenance
cost for the two passive systems and 2% per year for the two active
systems, the levelized cost for the systems falls in the $20 to
$23 per MBtu range. Looking at <A HREF="sw_tables.html#table1">Table
1</A> and <A HREF="sw_tables.html#table2">Table 2,</A>
we can see that
this is less than the average cost of electricity for federal
facilities, nationally and for several of the regions, but there
is little chance of competing with other types of water heating.
<P>
As
it happens, many smaller federal facilities or elements of federal
facilities are located in relatively remote areas where conventional
water-heating utility costs are particularly high. Three-quarters
of the projects built in the 1980s under the Solar in Federal
Buildings Program were small systems (less than 100 square feet
of collector) for facilities in the National Park System. Any
of the mid-temperature technologies will work well for small facilities.
Solar water-heating works well for general domestic needs and
for isolated facilities such as laundries, showers, visitor centers,
ranger stations, and staff housing.
<P> 
"Off-the-shelf" packages
are often quite appropriate for small or remote facilities such
as these, and a variety of SRCC-certified systems are available,
so engineering design work is not necessary. If the potential
system involves more than two or three collectors or will be connected
to unusual plumbing, electrical, or structural systems, a bid
package will likely be needed for a specific design. But in most
cases, you will still be able to use off-the-shelf components
and the ASHRAE <I>Active Solar Heating Systems Design Manual.</I>
<P> 
In warm
climates with limited freeze danger, the low-maintenance nature
of passive systems is an attractive feature for isolated locations.
Solar electric cells can provide power to operate solar water-heating
systems if electric utility connections are unavailable. Even
if grid electricity is available, solar cells are an excellent
match for solar water-heating pumps and often are used as the
main operation control for the system. When there is enough sunlight
for the hot-water system to be operating and power is needed to
run the pumps, the solar cells are also producing power.

<A NAME="large"><H3>Large System Examples</H3></A>
The Federal Bureau of Prisons recently
awarded a contract to build a solar thermal system at its correctional
institution in Phoenix.  Similar to installations at state and
local prisons, the system of parabolic-trough collectors and a
thermal energy storage tank will provide hot water for inmates,
laundry facilities, and kitchens. Another example of a large solar
water-heating system for a federal facility is a hybrid chiller
heat recovery/solar water-heating system for the Prince Kuhio Federal
Building in Honolulu, Hawaii. This building has 1,083,300 square
feet of floor space and houses a number of federal agencies. 
<P>
The
planned hybrid system combines a chiller heat recovery system
with a direct solar heating system. It provides 3000 gallons of
hot water per day and includes 1300 gallons of preheat water storage.
 The chiller heat recovery component of the system uses a compact
brazed heat exchanger with a heat-transfer area of 14 square feet.
The optimized solar heating component of the system has a solar
array with 1361 square feet of collector area on the roof. The
hybrid system allows the solar component to be about two-thirds
the size it would have been without inclusion of the chiller heat
recovery.
<P>
Because of the Hawaiian climate, freeze protection is
not needed and the solar portion of the system circulates the
potable water directly  through the solar collectors without a
heat exchanger. The solar component of the system provides 55%
of the buildings water-heating needs, with the total system providing
82% of annual demand. The system meets approximately 75% of the
water-heating load in the winter and 90% in the summer. The estimated
installed cost for the system is $58,389.  The system offsets
the need for synthetic natural gas at a cost of $1.22/therm. The
project has a simple payback period of 9 years and an adjusted
internal rate of return of 6.75%.

<P>
<H3>Where to Apply&#151;Large Systems</H3>
Although the cost of conventional energy
is still the most critical factor for the economics of solar water-heating
systems, for large federal facilities, it is less likely to be
the factor that makes solar water-heating cost effective. Because
of their size and because they are less likely to be in remote
locations, most large facilities will have moderate or low-cost
energy available. The cost-effectiveness of solar water-heating
systems for large facilities may, however, be improved significantly
by economies of scale in building a large system.  While small
systems with less than 100 square feet of collector generally
cost between $50 and $90 per square foot of collector aperture,
that figure can drop to $40 or $45 per square foot for flat-plate
collector systems with more than 1000 square feet of collector,
$30 per square foot for systems with more than 10,000 square feet
of collector, or even $25 per square foot for parabolic-trough
systems with more than 20,000 square feet of collector.
<P> 
As can
be seen from <A HREF="sw_tables.html#table3">Table 3,</A>
that reduction in cost can make all the
difference in whether a project will beat out the conventional
energy costs cited above. The table divides total system cost
(including 2% per year operation and maintenance) by the amount
of energy the system would produce over a 20-year lifetime.
These costs do not include government acquisition costs, which
tend to be relatively constant regardless of project size, giving
further advantage to larger projects.
<P> 
As can be seen by comparing <A HREF="sw_tables.html#table1">Table
1</A> and <A HREF="sw_tables.html#table3">Table 3,</A>
none of our six sample cities can compete with
conventional water heating paying the effective national-average
cost for electricity of $23.13/MBtu with small solar water-heating
systems costing $75 to $90 per square foot of collector and only
two at $60 per square foot. But with a larger system costing $40
or $50 per square foot, solar water-heating is quite competitive.
These numbers are, of course, ballpark figures that do not take
into account the specifics of particular situations, but they
do illustrate the importance of either competing against expensive
conventional water-heating or having a large water-heating load
that allows building a large enough solar water-heating system
to bring costs down.
<P> 
If hot water use is more than 1000 gallons
per day or conventional energy cost is more than $15 to $20 per
million Btu, prospects are good for a large solar water-heating
system to prove cost effective. At more than 10,000 gallons per
day, parabolic-trough systems should be considered.
<P> 
Nearly all
prisons, hospitals, and military bases, and many other federal
facilities with kitchens, laundries, or showers, use large quantities
of hot water. Many of these facilities also have populations that
are constant throughout the week and throughout the year and therefore
have consistent water use. These factors make it worthwhile to
consider a solar water-heating system&#151;particularly if
conventional
energy costs are relatively high. As indicated by the case study
below, additional savings are often possible during the summer
by recovering heat from chiller systems. It is occasionally possible
to take further advantage of economies of scale by also providing
hot water for space heating or cooling or other purposes. Current
thinking, however, is to look first at providing just for direct
hot water use, because adding heating or cooling makes systems
more complex and may adversely affect economics by increasing
the variation in demand throughout the year.
<P> 
Active indirect systems
with flat-plate collectors work well for meeting large water-heating
demands, but larger water volumes and need for high-temperature
water also make high-temperature parabolic-trough or evacuated-tube
systems attractive, depending on the climate. While flat-plate
collector systems typically provide enough heat to efficiently
raise heat transfer fluid temperatures to as much as 160&#176;F
(70&#176;C), the high-temperature collectors operate more
efficiently
when generating water or steam at much higher temperatures&#151;up
to 350&#176;F (175&#176;C) for evacuated-tube collectors
and up
to 570&#176;F (300&#176;C) for parabolic-trough collectors.
So
these systems are particularly good for facilities with high-temperature
water needs such as laundries, which typically use water as hot
as 180&#176;F (82&#176;C); kitchens, which typically use
water
temperatures from 140&#176;F to 195&#176;F (60&#176;C
to 91&#176;C)
for dishwashing; or industrial processes.

Sandia National Laboratories has
helped Camp Pendleton in Southern California refurbish an inactive
solar pool heating system at one of the Camp's recreational swimming
pools. The refurbishment was completed in the summer of 1995 for
$10,000. The collector array has 2,560 square feet of unglazed
collectors using copper pipes. If the pool was used yearround,
it would save $8,000 per year in natural gas. This pool is used
only 3-4 months per year but was chosen as a pilot project for
Camp Pendleton. The Marine Corps has six more pools with non-operating
solar water-heating systems at the Camp, and these are each used
year-round. Now that the pilot has been completed, the Marines
are looking into refurbishing the other six systems as well.
<P>
The
Barnes Field House on the Fort Huachuca Army Base in Fort Huachuca,
Arizona, uses a 2,000-square-foot solar system for pool heating,
see <A HREF="sw_figures.html#fig11">Figure 11</A>. The system was installed in June 1980, and
supplies heat for a 3,500-square-foot indoor pool. The system meets
49% of the annual load and offsets the need for 835 MBtu of natural
gas per year.
<P>
A noteworthy example of local government use of solar
water heating is the city of Santa Clara, California, solar pool
heating program. Since 1975, the city's municipal utility has been
providing for the design, installation, and ongoing maintenance
of solar pool heating systems. The pool owner pays an initial
installation fee to cover the value of the labor and permanent
materials required to install a solar heating system. The recoverable
components, including the panels and automatic controls, are rented;
the monthly fees are set by the city council as a "Solar Utility
Rate."  Each user and the city enter into a contract that defines
the responsibilities of each party and sets the monthly utility
fee proportional to the size of the solar energy system. Fees
are designed to repay installation costs as though repaying an
amortized loan for a term equal to the expected life of the equipment.
To date, more than 300 of the 800 pools in the city are heated
by the city's solar program.

<H3>Where to Apply&#151;Swimming Pools</H3>
One of the most consistently cost-effective uses for solar
water-heating systems is for heating swimming pools. Low-temperature
collectors&#151;most of which are for swimming pools&#151;have
accounted
for the majority of solar water-heating systems sold since 1991
(more than 85% on a square-foot basis in 1993). Many military
bases and other federal facilities have swimming pools, so there
may be many cost-effective opportunities for installation of solar
swimming pool heaters. If you have a pool and it is now heated,
you may reap great savings, because solar pool-heating systems
frequently pay for themselves within 2 to 4 years&#151;even
when
replacing natural gas heat. If your pool is not now heated, you
may be able to extend your season by several months. If you are
faced with budget cuts, energy savings may allow you to keep a
pool open.
<P>
The pool's filter system pumps the water through the
collector and the heat storage is in the pool itself. Because
only a modest temperature increase is needed, most systems use
inexpensive, unglazed low-temperature collectors, which are often
essentially systems of water tubes built into dark plastic. "Off
the shelf" packages are generally appropriate and maintenance
is minimal. Some smaller systems are operated manually or with
timers, but larger systems are operated by electronic sensors
and controls. When the collector temperature is sufficiently greater
than the pool temperature, a diverting valve&#151;the only
moving part&#151;diverts
water from the filter system through the collector loop. As with
other hot-water uses, conservation of generated heat is generally
the most cost-effective investment and swimming pool covers should
be considered at the same time as a solar water-heating system.
<P>
Brochures
on covers and solar water-heating systems for swimming pools and
a software package that can evaluate the economic feasibility
for your pool are available from the Energy Efficiency and Renewable
Energy Clearinghouse. Call 1-800-DOE-EREC and ask for the "Energy

<A NAME="right"><H3>The Right Collector for the Right Use</H3></A>
Solar collector
efficiency is a function of optical gain<SUP>1</SUP> minus heat loss<SUP>2</SUP>. Collectors
for low-temperature applications (like swimming pools) have high
optical gains (no cover glass and high surface absorptivity) but
they also have high heat loss because they are uninsulated. Mid-temperature
collectors, for domestic water heating, have cover glass and insulation
to reduce heat loss, but the cover glass results in slightly lower
optical gains due to reflection of sunlight off the glass. High-temperature
collectors such as evacuated tubes and focusing parabolic troughs
also have optical losses from cover glass and focusing reflectors,
but they retain heat at very high temperatures, making them ideal
for high-temperature applications like absorption cooling and power
generation.
<P>
The type of collector best suited to a particular
application depends both on the temperature above ambient to which
the water is to be heated and on collector cost. The following
table of energy generation per area of collector (based on selected
collectors from the SRCC <I>Directory</I>) shows that low-temperature
collectors are indeed the most effective for low-temperature applications;
mid-temperature collectors are the best for medium-temperature applications;
and high-temperature collectors are the best for high-temperature
applications. For low-temperature applications the more expensive
insulated collectors offer no advantage, but at high temperatures
they are essential to collect solar heat.

<H3>Application Screening</H3>
The first step
toward installing a solar water-heating system is to assess your
hot-water needs. How much hot water at what temperature do your
various facilities use (or are new facilities expected to use),
on what kind of schedule? How much do you pay for the energy to
heat that water? Can you save money with a more efficient conventional
water heater? What options do you have for reducing hot-water
use or lowering the temperature of water provided?
<P> 
The next step
is to obtain a preliminary estimate of whether solar water-heating
will be cost effective. The FEMP Federal Renewables Program at
the National Renewable Energy Laboratory has developed a computer
program known as Federal Renewable Energy Screening Assistant
(FREScA) that can make such a preliminary assessment for you.
See <A HREF="#howdo">"How Do You Figure"</A>
for a
list of the necessary information. (For swimming pools, you can
use "Energy Smart Pools" software instead of FREScA.)
<P>
For smaller projects, a clearly positive FREScA calculation will
often be sufficient to proceed to system purchase. For large systems,
a positive FREScA assessment should be followed up with a formal
feasibility study (see <A HREF="#econ">"Economic Criteria"</A>). Larger
projects will likely require a private engineer at some point,
but the FEMP Federal Renewables Program staff can provide fairly
extensive assistance.
<P> 
 A general rule of thumb for federal facilities
is that a renewable energy installation should pay for itself
within about 10 to 15 years. Because the lifetime of a system
can be as much as 30 years, that means you can look forward to
as much as 20 years of "free energy."
<H3>System Selection and Procurement</H3>
As a general rule, the optimal type of solar water-heating
system depends on the increase in water temperature that the system
will be used for. Low-temperature systems&#151;with no cover
glazing
or insulation&#151;absorb a high percentage of the available
solar
heat but also lose sizable amounts of energy. They are therefore
best for uses such as swimming pools that only require a modest
increase in water temperature. Adding glazing and insulation cuts
down on heat absorption but greatly increases heat retention,
so the added cost of mid-temperature systems is cost effective
for most applications requiring greater increases in water temperature.
High-temperature systems, such as evacuated tubes with their very
high insulation and parabolic troughs with their concentration
of the sunlight, are most effective when used to provide either
very large amounts of hot water or high temperature uses such
as kitchens, laundries, or industrial uses. (See <A HREF="#right">"The
Right Collector for the Right Use"</A> for detailed discussion.)
<A HREF="sw_tables.html#table4">Table 4</A> summarizes
characteristics
that may make certain system types particularly suitable or inappropriate
for your facility.
<P>
Having found that a solar water-heating system
is likely to be cost effective for your facility, chosen one or
two appropriate system types, and determined the approximate size
of the system, you can now probably pick out the most appropriate
products from the SRCC <I>Directory</I> (for smaller
systems) and proceed
toward purchase in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations.
For most agencies this means small purchase agreements based on
a request for quotes for projects costing less than $25,000, requests
for quotes including notice in the <I>Commerce Business
Daily</I> for
projects costing from $25,000 to $50,000, and going out for bids
for anything more than $50,000. (A new electronic mail advertising
system in the works will allow requests for quotes to be used
for anything up to $100,000.)
<P> 
 For smaller systems, specifics on
your hot-water usage pattern, water supply temperature, and detailed
utility rate schedule will probably be sufficient additional data
for potential vendors to supply the cost, performance, and other
information you need to select a system and to decide whether
to proceed. It is not quite like going to the discount store for
a conventional home water heater, but complete off-the-shelf systems
are available. FEMP is working on getting solar water-heating
systems on the GSA purchase schedule (perhaps by 1997, check with
the FEMP Help Line), which will make it easier to obtain specific
models at fixed prices. They are also developing product recommendations
for solar water-heating systems. In the meantime, certified systems
from the SRCC <I>Directory</I> are a place to start, and there may be
many other good systems to choose from.
<P>
For larger systems, you
will need engineering help to select an optimum system and do
a detailed economic assessment for that system (see <A HREF="#econ">"Economic
Criteria"</A>). You may have to go out for bids to
hire
an engineer to design the system, but can probably do so with
a sole-source contract for professional services. The designer
cannot then be a vendor for the system but can write the specifications
for the bid request and either install or supervise the system's
installation. <A HREF="sw_appends.html#appende">Appendix E</A>
is an example of specifications used
for the Chickasaw National Recreation Area case study. Check with
the FEMP Federal Renewables Program (303-384-7509) for other previously
prepared specifications that may be more similar to your planned
system.

<A NAME="howdo"><H3>How Do You Figure?</H3></A>
To obtain a preliminary analysis of
whether solar water-heating would be cost effective for your situation,
use the Federal Renewable Energy Screening Assistant (FREScA)
software package, available from the Federal Renewables Program
at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL): 303-384-7531.
Federal Renewables Program staff can also do the analysis for
you, if you provide the following data:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Hot water use in gallons per day
<LI>Fuel type and cost
<LI>Zip code
<LI>Incoming cold-water temperature
<LI>Outgoing hot-water-supply temperature
<LI>Area of southern exposure roof or nearby grounds available for system
<LI>Tilt and direction of roof area.
</UL>
<P>
To obtain comprehensive solar resource data (the FREScA system does
include solar resource data based on your zip code), request the
NREL <I>Solar Radiation Data Manual for Flat-Plate and Concentrating
Collectors</I> (see <A HREF="sw_appends.html#appendb">Appendix B</A>) or the CD-ROM of the National Solar
Radiation Data Base.
<P>
To estimate hot-water use, check your hot-water
use records; install a meter and track usage; or project demand
based on average use for various facilities as found in the American
Society of Heating, Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Engineers'
<I>Handbook of Applications.</I> Typical usage per day per occupant in
gallons is 20-30 for housing, 30 for hospitals, 5 for dining facilities,
and 3 for other uses.
<P>
To determine incoming water temperature (may
vary considerably with season), call your water utility, check
the supply with a thermometer, or refer to <A HREF="sw_figures.html#fig3">Figure 3</A> and <A HREF="sw_appends.html#appenda">Appendix A</A>. In some instances, the average annual air temperature also
serves as a rough indication of water supply temperature.
<P>
To calculate system output information more rigorously than the preliminary
analysis provided by FREScA, use a computer tool such as F-chart,
or consult with Federal Renewables Program staff or a solar water-heating
system supplier.
<P>
The optimum size for collector and storage will
depend upon fuel cost, your hot water use pattern, and the cost
of the system being considered, but expect storage to roughly
match one day's use and collector size to be approximately 1.0
square feet per gallon of storage. (The resulting system should
meet as much as about two-thirds of annual demand.) Precise optimization
of system size will require both a calculation of output and an
evaluation of the economics of contemplated systems.
<P>
To evaluate the economics of a contemplated system in detail, use the FEMP
<I>Life-Cycle Costing Handbook</I> and associated BLCC software (call
the FEMP Help Line at 800-DOE-EREC), or consult with the FEMP Federal
Renewables Program or a private engineer.
<P>
To evaluate the economic
feasibility of covers and solar water-heating systems for your
swimming pool, use Energy Smart Pools software, also available
from the FEMP Help Line.
</TD>
</TABLE>
<P>
<A NAME="econ"></A><H3>Economic Criteria</H3>
The policy for evaluating whether solar
water-heating or other renewable energy projects are cost effective
and therefore appropriate for federal facilities is contained
in 10 CFR Part 436A of the <I>Code of Federal Regulations.</I>
The principal
criterion of these regulations is that the life-cycle cost (value
in base-year dollars of all costs for the full analysis period)
for the project must be less than any alternatives, including
projected utility payments with the existing water-heating system.
(Three similar criteria may be used instead for retrofit projects,
and projects with "insignificant" cost are presumed
cost effective.)
<P> 
Executive Order 12902 goes beyond the cost-effectiveness
regulations to stipulate that if a project will pay for itself
(simple payback period time for savings to return the cost of
the investment) in less than 10 years, it shall be built (Sections
103 and 303). For most situations the 10-year payback criterion
will be more rigorous than the life-cycle-cost criterion. Many
projects will meet the life-cycle-cost criterion even though their
simple payback is somewhat longer than 10 years. Agencies must
build projects with a simple payback of less than 10 years, but
may also build any project that meets the life-cycle-cost criterion.
<P> 
Life-cycle-cost
analysis calculates the sum during the life of the project of
the present value of investment costs, operation and maintenance,
replacement costs, and energy costs, minus salvage value of replaced
parts. A manual for life-cycle costing (National Institute of
Standards and Technology [NIST] Handbook 135), an annual set of
prescribed energy prices and discount rates (NISTIR 85-3273),
and Building Life-Cycle Cost (BLCC) software (NIST 4481) are all
available by calling the FEMP Help Line at 800-DOE-EREC. (Some
agencies allow simpler life-cycle calculations, but the BLCC is
required if FEMP funding is involved. You may also need <I>Mean's
Mechanical Cost Data</I> [available from 800-448-8182] for
estimating
system component costs.)
<P> 
In addition to determining whether a
project is cost effective, economic analysis helps to determine
the size of the solar water-heating project that will minimize
costs during the life of the project. The cost of conventional
water-heating options will usually be the biggest factor in determining
optimal project size. The higher the conventional water-heating
cost, the larger portion of the load you are likely to be able
to meet effectively with a solar water-heating system. Calculating
the resulting savings in conventional water-heating (subtracting
any operation and maintenance cost for the system) and using an
appropriate discount rate or interest factor to compare present
system cost to future savings determines whether the system is
a worthwhile investment. The prescribed discount rate for evaluating
renewable energy projects for federal facilities for 1995 is 3%.
A low discount rate such as this favors future savings over initial
investment&#151;and thus encourages renewable energy projects
such
as solar water-heating systems.
<P> 
Although standard life-cycle-cost
analysis does not include a way to take credit for environmental
externalities such as benefits of reducing fossil fuel consumption,
these may be an important consideration if the economic efficiency
calculation is close. The National Park Service has developed
guidelines for calculating and including avoided air emissions
resulting from reduced electrical power production in their internal
economic evaluation of large energy efficiency and renewable energy
projects (Doug DeNio, 303-969-2162). Some agencies have chosen
to relax the economic evaluation criteria somewhat for showcase
buildings in new facilities or demonstration projects at existing
facilities. Projects must be basically cost effective, however,
or else they do not make good demonstrations.
<H3>Funding Sources</H3>
The
first place to look for funding is regular internal agency funding:
local purchasing authority for very small projects; Congressionally
approved line items for very large projects; and regular agency
funding. Special agency-specific funds, such as the Defense Department's
Energy Conservation Investment Program, may be available for energy
efficiency and renewable energy projects. Although there is not
expected to be any funding available for fiscal year 1996, the
Federal Energy Efficiency Fund of the U.S. Department of Energy
(DOE) and other programs have provided funding assistance for
renewable energy projects at federal facilities in the past. Call
the FEMP Federal Renewables Program (303-384-7509) for the current
status of any available funding.
<P> 
An important new financing option
available to federal facilities is energy savings performance
contracting (ESPC). A private energy services contractor designs
and installs the system, paying the full cost of parts and labor,
or the project can be financed by a third party. The federal facility
pays nothing up front beyond initial feasibility studies. The
contractor is responsible for operating and maintaining the system
and training facility personnel in its use. The facility then
pays the contractor for the energy received as a discounted percentage
(usually about 15% less) of what it would have cost from the utility.
The facility pays these "utility savings" bills for
a specified contract period (up to 25 years) from its utility
or operation and maintenance budget, after which the facility
retains the savings and equipment. Thus, the contractor and the
facility share the savings in utility costs. (There are now quite
a few companies set up to do energy service contracts; an association
is listed on page 24.) The facility must announce intent to consider
ESPC proposals in the <I>Commerce Business Daily,</I>
but may accept
unsolicited proposals. The DOE has a list of prequalified energy
service companies and model procurement documents, as well as
a manual on the ESPC program (for copies, call the FEMP Help Line
at 800-DOE-EREC).
<P> 
Through 1995, 17 performance contracts at a total
cost of approximately $30 million have been awarded under the
ESPC program (mostly energy efficiency so far, but solar water-heating
is clearly eligible). Both the contractors and FEMP are developing
a track record and experience base that will help make projects
go more smoothly. FEMP is currently working on setting up indefinite
quantity contracts to allow qualified contractors to serve any
eligible federal facility project within a region. 
<P> 
The obvious
advantages of performance contracting are limited initial investment,
no capital investment, no operation and maintenance responsibility,
and no technical or financial risk for the success of the project.
ESPC contracting is especially attractive for very large projects
that require substantial capital outlay or extensive operation
and maintenance. However, if funds can be obtained to build a
project, straight agency funding brings the full cost savings
back to the facility for the life of the project. Also, even with
prequalified contractors, the paperwork necessary for performance
contracting is significant enough to make it unattractive for
smaller projects for which construction can be more easily funded.
<P> 
More
than half the states and many local governments do provide incentives
for solar thermal collector or solar cell system purchases. These
programs are not generally directly applicable to federal facilities,
but may be helpful in certain situations. 
<P> 
Utility company incentives
for demand reduction and load management are currently an important
nonfederal source of financial assistance for solar water-heating
systems. Demand-side-management activities, such as promoting
solar water-heating systems, can save a utility from investing
in system expansions or help them comply with air quality programs.
Among the utilities that have been actively providing rebates
or other financial incentives for new solar water-heating systems
are the Sacramento Municipal Utility District, Florida Power and
Light, and the Eugene Water and Electric Board. Wisconsin Public
Service and the Hawaiian Electric Company are developing programs.
<P> 
Although most programs such as these were designed for residential
customers, they also generally apply to commercial facilities
including federal buildings. Federal facilities may be able to
negotiate specific incentives for larger projects beyond the scope
of standard programs or where standard programs do not exist.
On the one hand, anticipated utility industry restructuring may
cut back on demand-side-management programs, but on the other,
it may encourage utilities to spin off energy service companies
specifically set up to design and install energy efficiency and
renewable energy projects.
<P>
<A NAME="tech"><H2>Technology Performance</H2></A>
An estimated one million residential
and 200,000 commercial solar water-heating systems have been installed
in the United States. Seven hundred and eighteen systems were installed at federal facilities
during or shortly after 1981 through the Solar in Federal Buildings
Program. For discussion of experiences with recent installations,
see <A HREF="#small">"Small System Examples"</A>, <A HREF="#large">"Large System Examples"</A>, <A HREF="#swimming">"Swimming Pool  Examples"</A>, and <A HREF="sw_supplier.html#whois">"Who Is Using the
Technology"</A>. The technology is well developed
and today's solar water-heating systems are well proven and reliable
when correctly matched to climate and load. The current market
consists of a relatively small number of manufacturers and installers
that provide reliable equipment and quality system design. A quality
assurance and performance rating program, instituted by a voluntary
association of the solar industry and various consumer groups,
makes it easier to select reliable equipment with confidence.
<P>
Solar
water-heating is a renewable energy technology that saves nearly
as much (there is usually some excess capacity) conventional energy
use as it produces. Water heating accounts for about 18% of energy
use in residential and 4% of energy use in commercial buildings.
Solar water-heating can be used to replace much of that electrical
and fossil fuel energy consumption, wherever it is found cost
effective. Cost-effective system design often matches hot-water
use in the summer and partially meets the demand in winter for
a net production of about two-thirds of total hot-water use.
<H3>System Maintenance</H3>
Solar water-heating systems are long-lived and require
relatively little attention. But, as with any mechanical system,
some basic maintenance is essential to keep the system functioning
smoothly. All solar water-heating systems should be checked out
at least twice per year. Proper operation of sensors and controllers
should be tested for active systems. A primary cause of problems
is calcium carbonate deposits (scaling) from hard water. Other
major maintenance concerns are pumps failing and tanks developing
leaks. As with conventional water heaters, pressurized hot-water
tanks will have about a 15-year lifetime. Ten-year warranties
on collectors are the industry standard. 
<P>
Integrated collector
and thermosiphon systems need little maintenance. Relief valves
($10) will require replacement approximately every 15 years, as
with any hot-water system. Unless you have hard water, the systems
should not require flushing and should last 20 to 30 years. Direct
thermosiphon systems are not recommended for facilities with hard
water. For integrated collector and indirect thermosiphon systems,
very hard water necessitates additional maintenance and your contractor
may suggest flushing or other measures. The antifreeze in indirect
thermosiphon systems should be replaced every 5-10 years.
<P>
Direct
active systems such as drain-down and recirculating systems are
also strongly affected by scaling and are not generally recommended
where water is hard. One way to combat scaling problems is to
install an extra anode rod in the water heater. (All conventional
water heaters have anodes and replacing them could extend service
life, but they are often hard to get at.) In addition, controllers
and valves of direct active systems must be very carefully maintained
to prevent freezing problems.
<P>
Because drain-back systems are indirect
and can use demineralized water for the heat-transfer loop, scaling
from hard water is not as serious. Only the potable-water side
of the heat exchanger requires cleaning. (It should be checked
every year or so until you have a sense of the scaling problem
for your water supply.) If the system is not pressurized, it may
require regular replacement of evaporated water or checking the
valve that does that. Sensors, controllers, and pumps should be
checked regularly. Pumps ($50 to $200) can be expected to wear
out after 10 to 20 years, as in any hot-water system. Modern controllers
($100 to $200) have a mean lifetime of at least 20 years.
<P>
As with
drain-back systems, antifreeze systems are subject to scaling
only on the potable-water side, but require maintenance and occasional
replacement of tanks, pumps, and electronics. Antifreeze systems
also require replacement of the propylene glycol (because of breakdown
of corrosion inhibitors) every 5 to 10 years or more often if
the system has excess capacity and frequently maintains a high
temperature.
<P>
Unglazed, low-temperature systems must be drained
when the pool is closed for the winter and when freezing temperatures
are expected. The collectors should last from 15-20 years. Vacuum
relief valves and pressure relief valves ($10 each) will require
replacement every 5-15 and 10-20 years, respectively.
<P>
Because parabolic-trough
systems involve very-high-temperature and -pressure fluid, they
should be closely monitored. Operation and maintenance is generally
included as part of the contract for design and installation of
parabolic-trough systems. The mirror surfaces should be washed
every few months and will require replacement after about 15 years.
Seals on the pumps should be replaced every 10 years or so and
the controls for the tracking equipment may need replacing after
anywhere from 10 to 30 years.  But the large pumps used for trough
systems and the tracking equipment should last for the life of
the project.
<P>
<A NAME="case"><H2>Case Study&#151;Chickasaw National Recreation Area</H2></A>
<P>
The Chickasaw
National Recreation Area is located approximately 100 miles south
of Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. The National Park Service is planning
solar water-heating for one large and two small comfort stations.
They anticipate primarily summer use for all three buildings with
very little winter use. For the months of April through October,
the average hot-water load for each of the small comfort stations
is projected to be 660 gallons per day at a minimum temperature
of 95&#176;F (35&#176;C); for the large comfort station it is
projected to be 1500 gallons per day at a minimum of 105&#176;F
(41&#176;C). There will be no back-up water-heating, so an important
system design criterion was how many hours during the use season
the system would not be able to meet these minimum temperatures.
<P>
The solar water-heating systems for each of the small comfort
stations will consist of 194 square feet of collector area on
the roof and 500 gallons of preheat water storage in the mechanical
room. Each of these systems is expected to provide 32 MBtu (9394
kWh) of heat energy annually&#151;the total hot-water supply. Hourly
simulations estimate that the delivered water temperature will
be less than the desired temperature of 95&#176;F for 345 hours
during the use season. The efficiency of the system in converting
solar radiation to heated water is estimated at 45% averaged over
the use season. <A HREF="sw_figures.html#fig12">Figure 12</A> shows solar energy incident on the array,
energy collected by the array, and annual total hot-water load
for all 12 months for a small comfort station. The estimated installed
cost for each system is $7,804. A cost breakdown is included in
<A HREF="sw_tables.html#table5">Table 5</A>. The calculated rate of return is 6.2% and the simple
payback period is 9 years. The life-cycle-cost estimate for the
project developed using the BLCC software is shown in <A HREF="sw_appends.html#appendd">Appendix
D</A>.
<P>
The solar water-heating system for the large comfort station
will consist of 482 square feet of collector area on the roof
and 1000 gallons of preheat water storage in the mechanical room.
The estimated installed cost for the system is $16,100. This system
meets the use season load with the exception of 579 hours. The
rate of return is 5.9% and the simple payback period is 9 years.
A summary of the characteristics of both systems is shown in <A HREF="sw_tables.html#table5">Table
5</A>.
<P>
A drain-back system is recommended for this application. Other
system types were considered but rejected for this particular
application for the following reasons:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>The high stagnation temperatures
anticipated in wintertime would be damaging to the fluids in an
antifreeze system. 
<P>
<LI>Drain-down systems and recirculation systems
both circulate potable water through the collectors. The hard
well water used at this site would contribute to early obstruction
of the small collector flow passages with mineral deposits.
<P>
<LI>Direct
thermosiphon systems offer no freeze protection and indirect thermosiphon
systems offer no stagnation protection.
<P>
<LI>Site considerations rule
out ground-mounted tracking parabolic-trough systems.
</UL>
<P>
Aesthetics
of the site are a primary consideration. Thus, only the south-sloping
roofs of the buildings were considered for siting solar arrays.
The shading effects of surrounding hills, trees, and buildings
are not of great concern because the solar heating system collects
energy mostly in the middle of the day and in summer, when the
sun is overhead.
<P>
<A NAME="per"><H2>The Technology in Perspective</H2></A>
<P>
Despite problems with some
1980s installations, solar water-heating is a proven technology
that can play a significant role in reducing conventional energy
use at federal facilities throughout the country. There are a
variety of different types of solar water-heating systems available
to match the needs of different situations. Facilities dependent
on high-cost water heating are quite likely to find solar water-heating
systems economically attractive. Use for swimming pool heating
is generally economical regardless of conventional water-heating
cost. Many facilities with large, constant water use loads (prisons,
hospitals and military barracks are frequently good candidates)
will find that large solar water-heating systems can be designed
to economically meet their needs. Even where the economic payoff
is small, such projects are of great value because of the added
benefits of reducing pollution and climate-change emissions by
reducing fossil-fuel combustion. (Federal facilities also need
to comply with Executive Order 12902 and can play a valuable role
by setting good renewable energy use examples.)
<P>
The FEMP Federal
Renewables Program at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory
can quickly assess whether solar water-heating is likely to be
economically attractive for a federal facility with a minimal
amount of information. Financial assistance beyond regular agency
funding will likely be very limited at least for the near future,
but through the Energy Savings Performance Contracting program
of the Federal Energy Management Program, agencies have the option
of avoiding all installation costs and paying for solar water-heating
systems via utility savings bills.
<P>
The outlook for solar water-heating
at federal facilities is excellent from standpoints of technological
feasibility, compatibility with existing facilities, conventional
energy use reduction, and pollution and climate-change gas emission
reduction. Solar water heating can be effectively used at any
facility that wants to make a commitment to using it. For swimming
pool heating, when competing against expensive water heating,
and where hot-water use is very large and consistent, there is
a good possibility of solar water heating being found economically
attractive. Technological breakthroughs to dramatically reduce
costs and make solar water heating economically attractive for
other situations do not appear imminent. Nonetheless, the situations
where solar water heating has good likelihood of being cost effective
are substantial enough that the as-yet-untapped potential for
application at federal facilities is still quite significant.
