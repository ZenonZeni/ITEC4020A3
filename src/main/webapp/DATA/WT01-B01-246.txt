<H1>Sea Semester Course<A NAME="top"></A> Syllabus</H1>

<P>
The courses offered at SEA are divided into those offered on shore
and those offered on board the ships. The following sections provide
detailed information about each of the courses. <HR>

<H3><A NAME="ShoreComponent">Shore Component</A> Courses</H3>

<H4>Oceanography (3 credits)</H4>

<P>
Oceanography provides an overview of the physical, geological,
chemical and biological properties and processes within the world's
oceans. Students develop proposals for research projects which
will be conducted at sea. Prerequisite: one semester of a college
laboratory science or its equivalent.
<P>
Student grades are based on three written examinations, laboratory
reports and the research project proposal and presentation.
<P>
In the study of oceanography, students explore and come to understand
the complex characteristics and dynamic processes of the world's
oceans. The course covers the four interrelated disciplines-biology,
chemistry, geology, and physics-- that make up the science of oceanography.
<UL>
<LI><B>Geological Oceanography</B> covers the structure of the
earth, the origin of the oceans and atmosphere, and plate tectonics
the creation, growth and destruction of ocean basins. Students
examine major features of the sea floor, including sediments and
the records they preserve, and regional features, such as carbonate
banks, that are studied firsthand at sea during the Sea Component.
<BR>

<LI>In <B>Chemical Oceanography</B> students examine the chemical
composition of seawater, salinity, density, vertical structure
of the water column, distribution of dissolved gases and nutrients,
and the balance between inputs and outputs of dissolved materials
in the oceans.<BR>

<LI>Topics discussed in <B>Physical Oceanography</B> include the
Earth's heat budget, vertical, horizontal and global atmospheric
circulation, global warming, waves and tides, air-sea interactions,
vertical mixing processes, and the patterns of water circulation
within ocean basins.<BR>

<LI>In <B>Biological Oceanography</B> students explore factors
controlling the distribution of primary production, cycling of
nutrients in the oceans, and the structure and dynamics of the
food chain. As students become familiar with the diversity of
organisms that live in the sea, they examine their adaptations
to the requirements of life in the ocean. Students also consider
physical and biological factors that determine the distribution
of organizations within the marine environment.
</UL>

<P>
Once students develop an understanding of the ocean as a highly
integrated natural system, they study it as a system modified
by human activity. As they advance through the course, students
have the opportunity to discuss the effects of stresses imposed
by the human population on ocean and coastal resources, and to
examine the interrelationships between the oceans and the earth's
global environment.
<P>
Classes in oceanography include both lectures on general topics
and more specific discussions tailored to the waters of the particular
cruise track. Guest lecturers from the Woods Hole scientific community
present the latest results of oceanographic research.
<P>
With the assistance and direction of the Chief Scientist on shore,
each student develops a proposal for an oceanographic research
project that will be conducted at sea. Student research proposals
include: literature review, hypothesis, sampling plan, and procedures
to analyze and interpret data. Individual research projects reflect
each student's level of science background. Students with stronger
science backgrounds can conduct more sophisticated research. For
every student research project, a great deal of faculty guidance
and peer support is provided throughout the entire research process
from proposal development on shore through data collection, analysis
and final report presentation at sea.<BR>

<H4>Nautical Science (3 credits)</H4>

<P>
Selected scientific theories are applied to the operation of a
sailing vessel at sea. The concepts of the physics of sailing,
navigation (coastal piloting, celestial, and electronic), naval
architecture, ship construction, and marine engineering systems
are taught from their bases in physics, mathematics, and astronomy.
<P>
Student grades are based on written examinations and, with some
faculty, a nautical science notebook or journal.
<P>
This course provides students with the theoretical foundation
necessary to operate the SSV <I>Westward</I> and the SSV <I>Corwith Cramer</I>
at sea. In lectures and lab sessions, the faculty introduce the
principles fundamental to sailing vessel operations. Students
learn and apply essential concepts in general physics, astronomy,
and meteorology. The nautical science content is divided into
four major sections:
<P>
<OL>
<LI><B>Piloting/Coastwise Navigation</B>. In this section of the course,
students are introduced to the principles of navigating a vessel
within sight of land. Discussions include the earth's coordinate
system of latitude and longitude, nautical charts, and the magnetic
compass. Using these tools to determine location and direction,
students explore the concepts of deduced reckoning, line of position,
the navigational fix, and course and speed through the water.
Students become familiar with electronic navigation using radar,
loran, and the Global Positioning System (GPS). 

<LI><B>Celestial Navigation</B>.
Building on their knowledge in piloting, students learn the practice
of taking sights with a sextant-using the earth, sun, moon, stars,
and planets-and reducing them to lines of position to fix the
ship's position at sea. As they construct the celestial triangle,
students come to understand the navigator's view of the universe,
and discuss the basis of the idea of time.
<P>
<LI><B>Ships and their Operation</B>. Topics in this unit revolve
around a series of discussions and demonstrations that have their
roots in basic physics:
<UL>
<LI>Archimedes' Principle - ship stability
<LI>Bernoulli Effect- hydrodynamics and theory of sail
<LI>Boyle's Law- diesel engine combustion
<LI>Ohm's Law- production and storage of electricity
<LI>Newton's Laws and mechanical advantage- blocks, levers, winches,
and pulleys.<P>
</UL>

<LI><B>Meteorology</B> The weather has a major influence on life at
sea. Classroom lectures and discussions focus on global, regional,
and local weather, with special emphasis on the phenomenon of
atmospheric movement-wind. Students develop observational skills
by recording weather data on a regular basis on shore and come
to understand pressure systems, frontal genesis and movement,
and forecasting.
</OL>

<P>
Hands-on sessions reinforce the students' understanding of nautical
science theory. They study the forces acting on the ship's hull
in the water and on the sails in the air, using a towing tank
and a wind simulator to see firsthand the concepts of stability,
hydrodynamics, and aerodynamics. In a workshop on diesel power,
students dismantle and reassemble a small diesel engine. They
work on skills and problem-solving in coastal piloting, offshore
navigation, and weather prediction, all of which are fundamental
to the safety of vessels at sea. The exploration of these essential
concepts provides a foundation for understanding the art and science
of navigation.<BR>

<H4>Maritime Studies (3 credits)</H4>

<P>
This multidisciplinary study of the history, literature, and art
of our maritime heritage concludes with discussions of the political
and economic problems of contemporary maritime affairs.
<P>
Student grades are based on class participation, a short paper,
a mid-term exam, and final exam.
<P>
This course introduces students to our American maritime heritage
as well as contemporary maritime issues. Maritime history, literature
and maritime resource management comprise the primary content
of this course.
<P>
<B>The American Maritime Experience</B>. An introduction to the
richness and complexity of the American maritime heritage, the
first part of this course provides students with an historic and
literary context for understanding their own sea experience.
<P>
To gain an understanding of the role of the sea in the history
of the United States, students explore topics such as the European
discovery of the New World, the early fishing industry of North
America, the whaling industry of New England, and the importance
of overseas trade in early American commercial development. Representative
selections of sea literature--drawn from the writings of Kipling,
Melville, Conrad, London, and Hemingway--introduce students to
the traditions of the literature of the sea voyage. They explore
some of the major themes of maritime literature and are introduced
to different forms and styles of authors of voyaging literature.
Maritime art and music supplement the readings in history and
literature as students explore what has motivated people to test
themselves at sea and to attempt to explain that experience--in
different art forms--to those who remained on the shore.
<P>
<B>Contemporary Maritime Affairs</B>. An introduction to contemporary
maritime affairs, this part of the course provides students with
sufficient knowledge with which to formulate informed and intelligent
questions about selected current maritime problems. Students investigate
such controversial issues as the competition between fisheries
and the oil industry on the U.S. continental shelf; state and
federal government regulation of U.S. fisheries; the role of the
U.S. Navy and the direction it is taking in the &quot;Post Cold
War&quot; world; and the &quot;troubled&quot; U.S. merchant marine
and shipbuilding industries. Against a background theme of the
nationalization of the sea, students address the problem of managing
our maritime resources.<BR>
<HR>

<H2><A NAME="SeaComponent">Sea Component</A> Courses</H2>

<P>
The research programs and the cruise tracks of the SSV <I>Westward
</I>and the SSV <I>Corwith Cramer</I> provide a scientific and
educational experience in oceanography and nautical science. Students
examine diverse marine environments that demonstrate regional
variations as well as local phenomena. In traditional undergraduate
institutions, it is rare that all students have the opportunity
to propose a research project and carry it through data collection,
tabulation, analysis, interpretation and conclusion followed by
a presentation of their research results to their peers. Those
students who do have this opportunity are usually science majors
in specialized programs. At SEA, the opportunity to apply the
scientific method to an oceanographic research topic is integral
to the entire program and a requirement for science and non-science
majors alike. It is through this process that science majors as
well as liberal arts majors develop a fuller understanding of
science and the scientific approach to problem solving. All students
come to understand the difficulties of conducting research within
the constraints of the oceanic environment and weather that they encounter
at sea. In addition to completing their research, students may
collect data for on-going SEA faculty research projects
or collaborate on research projects for scientists from other
institutions.<BR>

<H4>Practical Oceanography I (4 credits) (SEA Semester only)</H4>

<P>
Theories and problems raised in the Shore Component are tested
in the practice of oceanography at sea. During lectures and watch
standing, students learn about: deployment, operation, and retrieval
of oceanographic sampling equipment; methods involved in the collection,
analysis and interpretation of oceanographic data; and the attendant
operations of sailing an oceanographic research vessel.
<P>
Student grades are based on written and practical examinations
as well as on-watch performance in the laboratory and on deck.
<P>
Practical Oceanography I is designed to introduce students to
the oceanic environment and the practice of scientific research
at sea. Students are instructed in the use of oceanographic equipment
and the operation of a research vessel through participation in
oceanographic sampling and conducting a research program coordinated
by the Chief Scientist.
<P>
The SSV <I>Westward </I>and the SSV <I>Corwith Cramer</I> are
well equipped to obtain samples for many types of oceanographic
research. The following list describes some of the techniques
that students learn:
<OL>
<LI><B>Deep sea bathymetric profiling</B> — operation of a Precision
Depth Recorder to determine sea-floor topography and sediment
profile.
<LI><B>Hydrostations</B> — use of a CTD (Conductivity-Temperature-Depth
Probe) for continuous profiling of salinity, temperature, and
pressure plus a series of Niskin bottles to obtain water samples
at specific depths.
<LI><B>BT stations</B> — use of the mechanical bathythermograph
to measure water temperature changes with depth.
<LI><B>Biological tows and trawls</B> - deployment and retrieval
of a variety of plankton nets, neuston nets, bottom and midwater
trawls, as well as methods of preserving and analyzing samples.
<LI><B>Sediment sampling</B> — sampling of sea floor sediments
using bottom grabs and/or a gravity core. Samples are typically
analyzed for grain size, composition, and benthic fauna.
<LI><B>Water analysis</B> — measurement of salinity by conductivity,
dissolved oxygen by titration (Winkler method), nutrients by spectrophotometry,
and chlorophyll a content by fluorometry.
<LI><B>Computer-based analysis</B> — tabulation, graphical presentation,
and data analysis provide ways to organize and present data and
results on board ship. Computers are available on board ship for
data analysis, word processing and preparation of student research
reports. <BR>
<BR>
In addition, students assemble a collection of fauna and flora
from a variety of marine environments to familiarize themselves
with the diversity and distribution of life in the ocean. This
collection serves as the basis for the study and discussion of
different phyla and taxonomic relationships.<BR>
<BR>
The daily lectures serve two functions. First, they introduce
the scientific concepts, sampling methodologies, and attendant
ship operations that the students learn on board. Second, they
provide the opportunity to review the oceanographic properties
of the regions being studied, to review the events of the last
24 hours with the entire ship's company, and to discuss the continuing
scientific activities of the ship.<BR>
<BR>
Approximately 75 oceanographic stations are completed during each
Sea Component. For each station, accurate navigation guides the
ship to a predetermined location. A suitable sail configuration
must be selected and set to maintain a fixed position or move
the vessel ahead at the correct speed for the sampling gear. Oceanographic
gear is deployed, lowered to a predetermined depth, and retrieved
safely. A new course is then set to the next station and the vessel
gets underway. Collected samples are processed and the data is
recorded. During the Sea Component, each student acquires the
knowledge and skills needed to take increasing responsibility
for each of these activities.
</OL>

<H4>Practical Oceanography II (4 credits) (SEA Semester only)
</H4>

<P>
Building on the experience of Practical Oceanography I, students
assume increasing responsibility for the performance of the vessel's
entire oceanographic research program while they complete their
individual research projects. Ultimately, each student is given
the opportunity to be responsible directly to the Chief Scientist
and the Captain for the safe and orderly conduct of the research
activities and related operations of the vessel during his/her
watch.
<P>
Student grades are based on written and practical examinations,
research performance, and oral and written reports on their individual
research projects.
<P>
Practical Oceanography II includes all activities described in
Practical Oceanography I, but at a more sophisticated level as
students take on increasing responsibility for shipboard operations.
In addition, they complete the data analysis and interpretation
for their own research project. Station work continues as the
SSV <I>Westward </I>and the SSV <I>Corwith Cramer</I> follow their
research plans. Individual students, through the Junior Science
Watch Officer (JSWO) and Junior Watch Officer (JWO) program, take
personal responsibility to supervise all activities in the laboratory
or on deck during their watches. The success of each ship's scientific
mission and the safety of its crew are monitored by the professional
staff but, during the final phase of this course, the first line
of decision-making rests with the students.
<P>
In addition, this course includes the completion of research projects
developed by the students during the Shore Component. Students
write a scientific paper and present a seminar on the results
of their research in a format similar to that at professional
conferences. Research project results and presentations play an 
important role in each student's final evaluation.<BR>

<H4>Practical Oceanographic Research (3 credits) (SEA Summer Session
only)</H4>

<P>
Students are guided by the scientific staff from an introductory
learning phase to increasing responsibility in the formulation
of scientific questions, station planning, equipment deployment,
and data interpretation. This multidisciplinary course examines
the ocean through an integrated study of such topics as: the variations
in the physical-chemical structure of the water column; the abundance
and diversity of biologic populations; and the geologic characteristics
of the sea floor. Regional comparisons along the cruise track
are often combined with more focused research on local phenomena
to obtain an understanding of both large- and small-scale features.
<P>
Student grades are based on written and practical examinations,
research performance, and research projects, including oral and
written reports.
