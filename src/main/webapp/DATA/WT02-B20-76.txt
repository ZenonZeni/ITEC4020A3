Definition<P>

Autism and Pervasive Developmental Disorder-NOS (not otherwise
specified) are developmental disabilities that share many of the
same characteristics. Usually evident by age three, autism and
PDD-NOS are neurological disorders that affect a child's ability
to communicate, understand language, play, and relate to others.<P>

In the diagnostic manual used to classify disabilities, the
DSM-IV (American Psychiatric Association, 1994), "autistic
disorder" is listed as a category under the heading of "Pervasive
Developmental Disorders." A diagnosis of autistic disorder is
made when an individual displays 6 or more of 12 symptoms listed
across three major areas: social interaction, communication, and
behavior. When children display similar behaviors but do not meet
the criteria for autistic disorder, they may receive a diagnosis
of Pervasive Developmental Disorder-NOS (PDD not otherwise
specified). <P>

  Integrated Treatment Approaches for Young Children with Multisystem

  Journal Announcement: CIJAPR96<BR>
  An approach to the diagnosis of pervasive developmental disorders is 
presented that considers the difficulties in relationships and communication 
secondary to sensory and motor processing deficits.  These difficulties are 
conceptualized as Multisystem Developmental Disorder (MSDD), and case vignettes 
illustrate typical patterns of MSDD and intervention options.  (Author/SW)<BR>

  Parents and teachers of 83 young children diagnosed with a pervasive 
developmental disorder rated each child on the Autism Behavior Checklist (ABC) 
and the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales (VABS).  Although there was good 
agreement between informants on the VABS, there was virtually no agreement on 
the ABC, with parents reporting more autistic and less adaptive behaviors than 
teachers.  (DB)<BR>

  Diagnosis of pervasive developmental disorders relies on the detection of 
deficits in social, play, and communication skills relative to the child's 
mental age.  A case example illustrates the multidisciplinary process of making 
the diagnosis in very young children.  Psychiatric evaluation criteria are 
examined, and a developmental framework for differential diagnosis is presented.

  Individuals with autism without mental retardation (ages 8-18), Asperger 
syndrome, and nonspecific social problems (controls) engaged in a 10-minute 
conversation.  Compared to controls, the higher functioning autistic group 
referred less to a previous stretch of the conversation and more to an aspect 
of the physical environment.  The Asperger group was very similar to the 
controls.  (Author/JDD)<BR>

  This study of 199 individuals with autism, 74 with pervasive developmental 
disorder or autistic-like symptoms (PDD-NOS), and 215 with non-PDD 
developmental disorders found that the 3 groups differed in the various 
measures of severity of autism.  Sex differences were primarily confined to 
intelligence quotient and were not prominent in other metrics of severity of 
autism.  (Author/JDD)<BR>

  This paper reviews 20 studies that investigated the internal or external 
validity of various subtypes of autistic spectrum disorders.  At least three 
groups could be distinguished from autism on clinical grounds: an Asperger 
syndrome subtype, and two atypical subtypes characterized by either low 
intelligence quotient or high intelligence quotient.  (Author/JDD)<BR>

  This paper reviews whether Rett syndrome is a subtype of pervasive 
developmental disorders (PDD).  The paper analyzes internal and external 
diagnostic validity and discusses whether Rett syndrome is a neurological 
disorder or a mental disorder.  The paper concludes that data support the idea 
of classifying Rett syndrome as a subtype of PDD.  (Author/JDD)<BR>

  This essay notes the complexities inherent in classifying pervasive 
developmental disorders (PDD), especially when a single classification scheme 
is to be used for clinical, research, and administrative purposes.  The paper 
considers principles of classification, symptomatology, the neuropsychiatric 
interface, the value of a multiaxial approach, and PDD subcategories.
