<p><strong>BALTIMORE</strong> - William W. Winpisinger, who served as
president 
of the International Association of Machinists (IAM) from 
1977 to 1990, now enjoys a blissful retirement,touring the 
nation with his wife, Pearl, in their motor home. When at 
home near Baltimore, "Wimpy" (as he likes to be called) 
often picks up his grandchildren after school.</p>

<p>Last summer, the Winpisingers traveled to Alaska. They were 
so impressed by the natural splendor of the state that 
Winpisinger was wearing a T-shirt decorated with the Alaska 
State logo when Communist Party Labor Commission Chairman 
George Meyers and I met him over breakfast recently.</p>

<p>Winpisinger may be retired but his influence is still felt 
in the labor movement. Many say he plowed the ground and 
planted seeds for the AFL-CIO's remarkable rejuvenation 
since its 1995 convention in New York City when John Sweeney 
was elected president in the labor federation's first-ever 
contested election. Linda Chavez-Thompson and Richard Trumka 
joined him as executive vice president and secretary- 
treasurer. "They've made the fur fly ever since," 
Winpisinger said.</p>

<p>Winpisinger is impressed. "I think they get an A-plus for 
their efforts," he said. "There has been a substantial 
energizing of the labor movement since they took over. 
Organized labor's efforts in the 1996 elections really stand 
out. That victory holds the promise of better things to come 
across a broad front."</p>

<p>Labor, Wimpy said, played a crucial role in the defeat of 
GOP presidential nominee Bob Dole and many Republican 
extremists in the House and Senate. "I knew the AFL-CIO was 
doing something right when [Republican Party Chairman] Haley 
Barbour and the rest of the Republican leadership started 
squalling about the $35 million the labor movement raised 
for its election activities. That is peanuts compared to the 
$262 million the corporations contributed to the 
Republicans, but it's the first competition they've had in a 
long time."</p>

<p>Winpisinger said labor should work to avoid open clashes 
with a second Clinton administration but added, "We're going 
to have to cajole the man in order to hold our own. I have 
seen very few instances where you go out and fight the good 
fight that you don't get some kind of results."</p>

<p>But Winpisinger has no illusions about the Democratic Party. 
He told us a story about the struggle during the Carter 
administration to pass Labor Law Reform. The AFL-CIO's 
efforts fell one vote short of the 60 votes needed to end a 
Senate filibuster and Florida's Democratic Senator Lawton 
Chiles promised to vote to end the debate. But at the last 
minute he reneged.</p>

<p>A few months later, Chiles came to the IAM seeking 
reelection help. "I told him we would give him just as much 
support as he gave us on Labor Law Reform." As long as the 
status quo continues, Winpisinger said, "we'll always be 
faced with the lesser of two evils because we never develop 
a candidate recruitment and training program where we put 
our own people in the field and try to elect them."</p>

<p>In this election, labor started to change that, setting up 
its own independent grassroots apparatus to support 
candidates who would challenge the Gingrich gang. "No matter 
where I was during this election year," he said, "you could 
feel labor's new vitality at the grassroots. That's 
contagious."</p>

<p>Winpisinger praised the Communist Party USA for its role in 
exposing and helping to defeat Dole and other right-wing 
extremists. "The Party played an important role in the 
elections this year," he said.</p>

<p>The Republican platform included immediate development and 
deployment of "Star Wars," a space-based weapons system, now 
supported by President Clinton. The system will cost at 
least $300 billion, the costliest in history, with Boeing 
and Lockheed Martin the prime contractors.</p>

<p>I asked Winpisinger for his views. "I don't know of a single 
scientist who says it will work," he said. "I used to debate 
a Reagan administration guy who was obsessed with Star Wars. 
The guy was a nut case." In the mid-1980s, Winpisinger spoke 
out strongly against the arms race and for economic 
conversion, a stand that enraged some IAM members at 
McDonnell Douglas. Winpisinger told us he made many trips to 
St. Louis to meet with the workers - and won them over.</p>

<p>"I asked them: 'What do we do when the government changes 
its mind? If it ever does, you're going to be the first ones 
axed. I think we ought to be prepared with a program of 
conversion to insure that you have jobs and income.' Now 
they sidle up to me: 'Wimpy, how did you know this was going 
to happen?' I didn't - but part of a union's job is to look 
ahead."</p>

<p>Winpisinger pointed to the immense increase in worker 
productivity in the past 30 years and to Bethlehem Steel's 
nearby Sparrows Point mill which once employed 30,000 
workers but now produces more steel with 5,700 workers. For 
Wimpy there's only one answer: "Reduce the hours of work, as 
they have already done in Europe," with no cut in pay.</p>

<p>Winpisinger hailed the AFL-CIO's America Needs a Raise 
campaign. "We need to use our power more judiciously than 
ever before - focus it very tightly and not go out with a 
scatter gun," he said. "We focused on the minimum wage and 
we won a victory. And it's not a selfish interest. It's 
across the board. We're portrayed as a special interest but 
I can't remember an issue that we've fought for that didn't 
advance the living standards of all the people."</p>

<p>The change in the AFL-CIO was not a surprise to Winpisinger 
who said it "came naturally. There was no preconceived plan 
for John Sweeney to emerge. The change was brought about by 
necessity."</p>

<p>Winpisinger pooh-poohs suggestions that he got the ball 
rolling. "All I did was speak my piece," he said. "I felt 
that the labor movement had stagnated because the leadership 
became too complacent. They didn't want to take a chance on 
anything. Life is really a crap game and if you risk 
nothing, you gain nothing."</p>

<p>Winpisinger, an accomplished stump orator with a sharp 
tongue and keen wit, unleashed one broadside after another 
on the delusions peddled by class collaborationist labor 
leaders after he was elected IAM president in 1977. Rank and 
file workers loved his irreverent speaking style. Much of 
Winpisinger's thinking is reflected in his 1989 book, 
"Reclaiming the Future - An Agenda for American Labor" 
(Westview Press, 5500 Central Ave. Boulder, CO 80301). Based 
on Winpisinger's many speeches, the book burns with anger 
against the the Fortune 500 and their agents in government 
who unleashed a brutal drive to impose a "union free 
environment" and covered it with soothing cliches about 
"labor-management partnership."</p>

<p>In the chapter, "Labor Relations Today," Winpisinger writes, 
"You don't need to be a Marxist to observe that the conflict 
between capital and labor is as old as the history of the 
world ... In the last decade, class war has been declared 
not by trade unions or working people on their employers but 
by our employers and recently by our government on us."</p>

<p>For Wimpy, born in Cleveland, Ohio, on Dec. 10, 1924, 
militancy came early. His father was a union typographer at 
the Cleveland Plain Dealer. "I can remember as vividly as 
yesterday when I was 10 years old, my father coming home 
from night shift with the morning edition of the Plain 
Dealer. It had a picture on the front of a mountain of 
potatoes that was being bulldozed somewhere down in Georgia 
- and this in the depths of the Depression and people were 
starving." Winpisinger recalled, "I said to myself, 'What a 
crime! Why not distribute those potatoes to hungry people?' 
And the answer was: You couldn't do that! It would be 
socialism! I became a socialist - not a doctrinaire 
socialist but a seat-of-the-pants socialist."</p>

<p>Now, he said, "we've come full circle - back to the 
situation where the gap between rich and poor is becoming 
wider and wider. They are driving us into a corner and we 
will fight!"</p>

<p>When Winpisinger delivered speeches along those lines in the 
late 1970s, he was greeted by millions of working people 
across the country - yet at the leadership level, his was a 
lonely voice. Then came Ronald Reagan. "Reagan showed people 
what can happen when you've got a despotic s.o.b. in the 
White House," Winpisinger said. "Reagan gets a lot of credit 
for labor's resurgence - unwitting I'm sure, because 
Corporate America didn't believe we could do it. These birds 
are full of hops and are always ready to write our obituary.</p>

<p>"I constantly told people before I retired that there is a 
future for this movement. Without it, everybody is helpless 
before the absolute workplace power of the boss."</p>

<p>There were many harbingers of the things to come during the 
Reagan-Bush years, he said. Reagan's mass firing of the 
Professional Air Traffic Controllers (PATCO) in August 1981 
was one. The AFL-CIO Executive Council was meeting in 
Chicago the morning after the PATCO strike began.</p>

<p>PATCO had endorsed Reagan in the mistaken view that he would 
go easy on them should they strike. Nor had the union 
consulted with the AFL-CIO before walking out. Nevertheless, 
when the walkout and mass firing took place, Winpisinger 
announced that he would support the solidarity walkout 
provided it was an across-the-board walkout. But no one else 
on the executive council picked up on this proposal for what 
would have amounted to a general strike. Rather, the most 
conspicuous action by the AFL-CIO was Solidarity Day in 
which more than half a million trade unionists marched up 
Constitution Ave. on Sept. 19, 1981 with PATCO leading the 
way. Next in line was a huge IAM contingent carrying a curb-
to-curb banner reading, "Jobs Not Bombs."</p>

<p>"It was militancy rearing its head," Winpisinger said. 
"People wanted a more action-oriented labor movement."</p>

<p>Major strike battles followed - the Pittston Coal strike, 
Ravenswood and, more recently, strikes at Boeing, McDonnell 
Douglas and Bridgestone-Firestone. "Grassroots support 
developed for these strikers," he said. "It convinced 
everybody that the will was there. It was a question of 
getting it organized." A source of "disrepute" for labor in 
years past, according to Winpisinger, was "intramural 
warfare when we should have been fighting the boss." He was 
referring to unions competing for members, raiding each 
other and even in some cases crossing each others 
picketlines. Now, he said, the labor movement is entering a 
period of increased solidarity and joint action. That, in 
turn, is promoting the idea of mergers, the biggest of all 
the proposed amalgamation of the IAM with the United Auto 
Workers and the United Steel Workers of America.</p>

<p>Winpisinger told us that he and then-UAW President Douglas 
Fraser had opened talks on a merger back in the mid-1980s. 
When Owen Beiber succeeded Fraser, the talks were halted. " 
Then a few years later, Beiber came up to me and said, 'Hey, 
it's time to talk about a merger.' I told him, 'We never 
stopped talking about it. The ball is in your court.'"</p>

<p>Winpisinger said the unification into one union of 
machinists, autoworkers, steelworkers, rubber workers and 
glass workers is "a monumental task but it will be something 
to behold if they can bring it off. For the first time, we 
will be able to look at our biceps and say, we're not a 
mosquito bite anymore. It's about time that when we sit down 
at the bargaining table we have a howitzer as big as 
theirs!"</p>

<p>As he drained the last of his coffee, Winpisinger turned 
philosophical. "There's no question that the old leadership 
got in a rut and couldn't get out because they didn't have 
enough confidence in the American worker. People are not 
likely to join a powerless organization. If they pay union 
dues, they want a union." Then, his voice taking on the tone 
that that still inspires unionists, he added, "This economy 
is driven by the price-gouging of the entrepreneurs, not by 
wages. Wages have fallen behind and not enough is being done 
to make it up. Now we're beginning to talk about it.</p>

<p>"I see a determination at the grassroots level to get new 
members enrolled. And if that relentless pressure is kept 
on, the movement will grow. If we do our work right, it will 
attract people like honey attracts bees. We're demonstrating 
the ability to get in and mix it up to accomplish labor's 
fundamental goals."</p>
