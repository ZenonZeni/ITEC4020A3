<p><i>Please use these talking points as a guide in presenting
information on brain disorders to your local civic and business
communities. You should tailor your presentation to suit your
particular audience -- civic group, voluntary organization,
business executives, health insurers, etc.</i></p>

<p><b>Introduction</b></p>

<ul>
    <li>In a given year, five million American adults, or
        approximately four percent of the work force, suffer from
        an acute episode of one of the following brain disorders:
        schizophrenia, panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive
        disorder (OCD), bipolar disorder (manic-depressive
        illness), and major depression.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>In the last decade, significant scientific advances have
        provided the first real hope for people with brain
        disorders. Pioneering research has found a biological
        basis for brain disorders and treatments that work,
        helping people live healthy, productive lives.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>In 1990, the indirect cost to society of brain disorders
        in the U.S. was conservatively estimated at $75 billion.
        This cost includes lost productivity and earnings due to
        illness, as well as lost earnings due to premature death.<sup>4</sup></li>
</ul>

<p><b>Mental Illnesses are Brain Disorders</b></p>

<ul>
    <li>It&#146;s scientifically clear that brain disorders are
        not caused by bad character, poor child-rearing, or an
        individual&#146;s behavior. And it&#146;s morally
        repugnant to &quot;blame&quot; people for being affected
        by brain disorders. </li>
    <li>Altered brain chemistry, structure, and functioning, as
        well as genes, are among the causes of brain disorders.
        For example, imbalances in the chemicals serotonin,
        dopamine, and norepinephrine and their receptors have
        been linked to brain disorders such as schizophrenia and depression. Advanced
        imaging technology and other methods have pinpointed structural differences
        in the brains of individuals with brain disorders. </li>
</ul>

<p><b>Treatment for Brain Disorders Works</b></p>

<ul>
    <li>Brain disorders have physiological indicators, which
        allow them to be diagnosed and treated as effectively as
        other physical conditions. </li>
    <li>According to the National Institute of Mental Health, the
        current success rates for treating severe forms of brain
        disorders with medications and other therapies are as
        follows: schizophrenia, 60 percent treatment success
        rate; panic disorder, 70 percent to 90 percent; OCD, 75
        percent; bipolar disorder (manic-depressive illness), 80
        percent to 90 percent; and major depression, 70 percent
        to 80 percent.</li>
    <li>By comparison, the overall success rate of some commonly
        used treatments for cardiovascular disease is only 45 to
        50 percent. </li>
    <li>A new generation of medications recently approved and
        under development makes the treatment of brain disorders
        even more effective by targeting problem areas in the
        brain.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>The Cost of Treating Brain Disorders is Comparable To or
Less Than the Cost of Treating Many Other Physical Illnesses </b></p>

<ul>
    <li>In 1990, the annual cost of treating a person with severe
        diabetes was $7,725, vs. $7,158 for treating a person
        with schizophrenia.<sup>4</sup> </li>
    <li>The total costs (direct and indirect) of cardiovascular
        disease in 1990 were estimated to be $160 billion, in
        contrast to $148 billion for the brain disorders
        schizophrenia, panic disorder, OCD, bipolar disorder (manic-depressive
        illness), and major depression.<sup>4</sup></li>
    <li>In 1994, one managed care company in Texas -- a state
        where parity legislation exists for state employees --
        had 12,233 claimants for cardiovascular disease and 4,617
        claimants for schizophrenia. The average cost for
        treating people with cardiovascular disease was $2,496, compared
        to $1,424 for people with schizophrenia.<sup>9 </sup></li>
</ul>

<p><b>Americans with Brain Disorders Face Serious Discrimination</b></p>

<ul>
    <li>Americans with brain disorders currently face serious
        discrimination, which exacts a significant human and
        financial toll both in the workplace and our communities.</li>
    <li><b>&nbsp;</b>Individuals with brain disorders often
        cannot obtain adequate health insurance coverage. Many insurance
        companies exercise the &quot;pre-existing condition&quot;
        clause, barring people who may have had as few as two
        counseling sessions from obtaining coverage. </li>
    <li>Research indicates that, if you have health insurance, 90
        percent of insurance companies offer lesser benefits for
        brain disorders than for other physical conditions.
        Typically, hospitalization is unlimited for other
        physical disorders, while it is limited to 30 to 60 days
        for a brain disorder. In terms of outpatient treatment,
        visits are unlimited for other physical conditions, while
        visits for brain disorders are often limited to 20 times
        per year.<sup>4</sup> &nbsp;</li>
    <li>Studies show that co-payments are also inequitable --
        usually up to 20 percent for other physical illnesses vs.
        40 or 50 percent for brain disorders.<sup>4</sup> Other
        physical illnesses usually have lifetime maximum benefits
        of $1 million; the maximum lifetime benefits for brain
        disorders are usually $20,000, which barely cover the
        cost of a single hospitalization. Individuals who
        experience first episodes of brain disorders during
        adolescence could easily spend their lifetime benefits before
        reaching adulthood.</li>
    <li>This discrimination and increased financial burden often
        prevent people with brain disorders from getting the
        treatment they need, even though this treatment is often
        more effective than treatment for other medical illnesses. Discrimination
        also results in dumping people into the public sector,
        paid for by taxpayers.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Providing Health Insurance Coverage for Brain Disorders is
Affordable </b></p>

<ul>
    <li>According to some estimates, if all adults received
        access to equal coverage for brain disorders (parity),
        the employer-paid premiums would only increase by 1.5
        percent each month, or approximately $2 per month per
        employee, or less.<sup>4</sup></li>
    <li>Many companies that self-insure have seen the economic
        benefits for years. These businesses include Digital,
        Federal Express, and IBM. </li>
    <li>In states with parity for brain disorders, the costs have
        been minimal. In the Texas state employee parity program,
        the total cost for treating employees and their families
        for brain disorders was $2.47 per person per month (1994/5).<sup>9</sup> </li>
    <li>In Rhode Island, the increased premium costs were just 30
        cents per person each month.<sup>9 </sup></li>
    <li>If only 80 percent of people with brain disorders sought
        treatment, the overall costs to society would be reduced
        by $2.2 billion. Premature deaths would be averted,
        restoring lost lifetime earnings to the economy. There
        would also be a ten percent reduction of general medical
        care for people with brain disorders.<sup>4</sup><b>&nbsp;</b></li>
</ul>

<p><b>People Treated for Brain Disorders Can Lead Healthy,
Productive Lives</b></p>

<p><b><i>[If appropriate, insert your own success stories here to
localize your presentation.]</i></b></p>

<ul>
    <li>Rachel, 35, has experienced schizophrenia for ten years
        and has even attempted suicide. After two years of
        treatment with clozapine, one of the new breakthrough
        medications, she is now a successful human resource
        manager in a small business.</li>
    <li>Mike, 28, has obsessive-compulsive disorder and works at
        a prestigious accounting firm. His illness caused him to
        continually check and recheck figures, spending a week or
        more on a task. Treatment quickly helped him control his
        actions and dramatically increase his productivity.</li>
    <li>Richard, a 45 year-old senior vice president at a major
        corporation, reports his life at home and at work has
        improved since he began taking medication for panic
        disorder. Almost immediately after beginning the
        medication, he recovered from the severe panic attacks
        that used to leave him paralyzed at home, unable to go to
        work.&nbsp;</li>
