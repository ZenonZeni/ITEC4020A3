<H2>Background<BR>
</H2>
<P>
The satelliteborne Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) system is a
promising technique for research in hostile environment like the
Arctic, where weather and ice conditions are a real threat to
traditional in situ observations and measurements (cf. Askne 1994).
This technique has also been proven to be useful for ship and
icebreaker operations in ice infested seas (cf. H&aring;kansson
et al. 1995, and Herland &amp; Berglund 1995). Since SAR data
are obtained as an image, the distribution of different types
of ice and open water can be obtained. <BR>
<P>
The gathered expedition data are used for SAR imagery validation,
and evaluation of its usefulness for monitoring of sea ice properties
of importance for climate change. In particular we are interested
in meltpond distribution, sea ice concentrations and sea ice drift.
The results from Arctic-91 expedition shows that ESA satellite
ERS-1 indeed could be used for retrieving some of these sea ice
variables (Sun &amp; Askne 1994 and Pettersson et al. 1996). However,
the ERS-1 SAR imagery has a much smaller geographic coverage than
the present Radarsat SAR imagery (100*100 km<FONT SIZE=1>2</FONT>
compared to 500*500 km<FONT SIZE=1>2</FONT>) and in addition Radarsat
has a much larger coverage towards the high latitudes (up to about
88&#176; N) than ERS-1 and -2. Since little is known about the
ice distribution and its seasonal variability at high latitudes,
it is possible with this technique to improve our knowledge and
contribute with bits and pieces to the water and energy exchange
between the ocean and the atmosphere in the Arctic area. Processes
which are critical in climate and environmentally related research
activities.
<H2>Work at Oden and on the ice<BR>
</H2>
<P>
The radar emits energy in the microwave range of the spectrum,
for example the Canadian satellite Radarsat is operating at the
frequency of 5.3 GHz, at different angles to the ground. In this
context an important task of the expedition was to get information
of the sea ice conditions for comparison with the image data.
We concentrated our efforts on snow coverage, density, grain size,
temperature, wetness and thickness as well as the ice thickness,
roughness, temperature, salinity, porosity, density and dielectric
properties. In addition it is important to have information on
ridges, leads, meltponds, first-year and multi-year ice distributions.
<P>
Hence, the aim of our project was to gather information of snow
and ice conditions, distribution of ice and open water and of
ice-types, during times when the satellite passed over our observation
area. A helicopterborne video camera connected to a GPS was used
to observe the local scale of the sea ice variability. Helicopter
flights in this part of the world are extremely weather dependent
since the visibility changes rapidly and there is often risk for
icing during high moisture content at air temperatures below 0&#176;
C. During the second leg of the cruise the air temperature never
exceed 0&#176; C and the moisture was almost always around 80
to 90 %. When the cloud cover disappeared, the outgoing thermal
radiation often cooled the atmosphere close to the ground and
the moist turned into fog. Despite the weather conditions we managed
to get 4 stations covered with measurements from the helicopter.
<BR>
<P>
In addition, tests were performed with a skidoo mounted radar,
determining the backscatter from layers where the dielectric properties
of the ice varied rapidly. Large backscatter is generally obtained
from the interface between ice and water. These radar data are
compared with actual observations of the ice thickness, using
a machine driven drill. In general the accuracy of the radar is
&#177; 0.20 meters.<BR>
<P>
A scatterometer mounted on the helicopter was used to determine
the backscatter from different ice-types and water. This information
is of importance for the interpretation of SAR imagery, as a complement
to the calculated backscatter, using a model based on the data
obtained from the ground measurements.<BR>
<P>
Also the sun radiation within the ice was measured. A larger hole
was sawed into the ice and from the side a small horizontal hole
was drilled. A radians meter was put into this hole, from which
the sun radiation, coming through the snow and the ice above it,
was observed. These data will be used to increase the knowledge
of the energy flux parameterisation in snow and ice, which are
important for climate models. Another additional subproject of
the group was to investigate the sediment content in the sea ice.
A presentation of this project will be given elsewhere.<BR>
<H2>Some preliminary results<BR>
</H2>
<P>
In all we were able to cover 12 ice stations. The average snow
thickness varied from 8 to 56 cm, with the thin snow cover (8
to 15 cm) obtained at 85&#176; N 10&#176; E and southward to the
marginal ice zone. The snow can be classified into four different
types, based on density and grain size; a/ new snow with high
void content and small grain size, b/ new but windpacked snow
with relatively low void content and slightly larger grain size,
c/ granular snow particles with low void content and d/ highly
granular snow-ice particles with medium void content loosely bonded
to each other. Statistics shows there are a relation between mean
and standard deviation of snow thickness. These data can be used
to estimate the local average snow cover thickness, information
necessary for thermodynamic modelling and heat exchange between
the water-ice-atmosphere system and for interpretation of SAR
imagery. <BR>
<P>
In the eastern high Arctic there were no signs that a summer melt
has taken place, since relatively high salinity was found in the
surface parts of the second-year ice cores, investigated along
the 85&#176; N latitude between 149 and 160&#176; E. On the other
hand, in areas closer to the ice edge i.e. south of 85&#176; N
along 10&#176; E had experienced melting conditions. A conclusion
based on the vast amount of frozen melt ponds found in this part
of the Arctic. Typically the ponds were covered with 10 to 20
cm of fresh ice above a layer of fresh water on multi-year ice.
<BR>
<BR>
The very first preliminary analysis of a RADARSAT image from September
1 indicate that the ice concentration is on average 85 % in that
particular area, which is close in magnitude to the estimate found
from helicopter video measurements, cf Figure 1. At first glance
it may appear unlikely with such a relatively low ice concentration,
but note that the i/b Oden managed well at these latitudes, since
ice breaking could be avoided to a great extent due to the presence
of leads and openings.<BR>

<P>
The whole group thanks the helicopter and the deck crew on i/b
Oden for assistance with equipment and their patience with us
during loading and unloading at each ice station. In particular
we thank Jan-Erik Johansson for transports on the ice and polarbear
watching during times when the ice party mainly was occupied with
snow and ice sampling. We are also grateful to the Swedish Space
Board and the Swedish Maritime Administration for funding, as
well as ESA and RADARSAT for satellite images as part of announcement
of opportunity projects.<BR>
