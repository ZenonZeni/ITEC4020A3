<P>The nature and extent of oil contamination at a site can range from
major to trivial. More importantly, the potential for this soil and groundwater
contamination to expose a neighbour, an on-site worker, or another potential
receptor varies enormously. The first decision to take is whether the potential
health risks caused by soil/groundwater contaminants are severe enough
to require action. In many cases, if risks to human health or the environment
are minimal, then contaminants can be safely left to degrade naturally.
If action is required, then further decisions have to be taken as to how
much soil or groundwater needs to be cleaned, and what level of contaminants
can safely be left.</P>

<P>In the past, some countries have set fixed numerical criteria to decide
these issues. These limits are based on generic assumptions on site conditions
such as: soil type, depth to groundwater, geology and hydrogeology, and
proximity to potential receptors (e.g. water well, basement, surface water
body). Such an approach ignores the fact that contaminated oil industry
sites vary widely in terms of complexity, and the potential risk they may
pose to either human health or the environment. As fixed numerical criteria
are nearly always set at very low levels to ensure safety, their use leads
to the clean-up of more land than may be necessary. The result is wastage
of industry resources (and ultimately added expense to the consumer) conducting
clean-up with no incremental reduction in risk to human health and the
environment.</P>

<P>In recent years, the principles of risk-based corrective action have
been applied in a number of countries in Europe and in North America where
it has been developed by the American Society for Testing Materials (ASTM).
This follows a flexible approach to decision making whereby corrective
action is appropriately tailored to site-specific conditions and hazards.
This leads to more cost-effective solutions, and allows the greatest effort
to be applied where it is most beneficial. In its broadest sense, risk
assessment in relation to contaminated land can be defined as ‘an evaluation
of whether there is a potential for adverse effects to occur, based on
factual knowledge about a site, scientific theories concerning the environmental
behaviour and toxicity of the chemicals present, assumptions which have
to be made where there is a lack of site-specific data, and predetermined
acceptability criteria’.</P>

<P>Many CONCAWE member companies have been involved with this American
activity but realized that there are a number of differences between the
two continents and even within them. Their wish has been to develop similar
techniques for Europe and they have therefore established a task force
to carry out this work and produce a Guideline setting out the approach
which could be adapted to the situations prevailing in the various European
countries. </P>

<P>This guideline is now nearing completion and describes a three-tiered
approach to corrective action decision making. The CONCAWE guideline is
built on the premise that one begins with relatively little site data (using
conservative generic assumptions) and, through additional investigation
and analysis, progresses towards more site-specific knowledge and less
conservatism. The result is an equal level of protection of human health
and the environment throughout Tiers 1, 2 and 3.</P>

<P>The three-tiered approach in the Guideline is summarized schematically
in Figure 1. It starts with an initial assessment of the site, which involves
gathering general data including potential sources of contaminants, obvious
evidence of contamination, land-use, presence of potable groundwater, etc.
The pathways by which contaminants could reach populations and environmental
compartments at risk are also identified. This initial assessment is followed
by Tier 1 in which chemical data on the degree of contamination of the
site is collected and compared with Risk-Based Screening Levels (RBSL)
and other relevant criteria. The RBSLs comprise of a set of trigger concentrations
for contaminated soil and groundwater. These figures are not intended to
be soil standards or clean-up targets. If exceeded, they are simply an
indication that further study is required. RBSLs are derived using conservative
assumptions and contaminant migration models and, as such, are based on
a generalized risk assessment. If the observed values are below these levels,
then the risk will be insignificant.</P>

<P>In Tiers 2 and 3, the assessment involves refinements of the study to
take into account more site-specific considerations, with the possible
collection of additional data. The actual environmental compartments and
populations at risk are identified, along with the possible pathways. These
pathways are modelled to prepare quantitative risk estimates which can
be compared with acceptability criteria. There is an option at the end
of each of these Tiers to develop a corrective action programme based on
remediation to the newly derived Site Specific Target Levels (SSTL). Corrective
Actions could include taking no action or instituting a long-term monitoring
programme. </P>

<P>Although this procedure may seem complicated, it is expected to provide
a consistent framework for decision making. The outcome should be cost-effective
but still result in the clean-up of those sites where it is necessary to
protect man and the environment. </P>
