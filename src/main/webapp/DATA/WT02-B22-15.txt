<UL>

<!-- FIELD:CMT_PHIL -->
<LI>Religion is just a choice we all have to make.  I am Christian, but I'm not some Bible beater.  Tolerance and the ability to forgive are what God really wants, anyway.  I embrace all of my brothers and sisters, reguardless or race, religion, or orientation.  After all, we are all God's children.  Immerse your soul in LOVE!!!  (Smile daily).
<LI>You can find a church or guru to tell you anything you want to hear.  People deeply believe everything conceivable.  Nothing wrong with religion when it comforts us and helps us be responsible to each other (heck, we _are_ our brothers' keepers); it's awf
<LI>Religion exists so that people who a re otherwise useless can  scam an income and manipulate people without attaining political office.
<LI>Don't try to shove your belifs down my throat unless you want them shoved up you ass.
<LI>Religious beliefs of individuals are too often used for political gains by would-be tyrants
<LI>Government seeks to control man's actions; Religion seeks to control man's mind.  Therefore, I believe in minimal government and no religion.
<LI>$cientology is a DANGEROUS and CRIMINAL cult and NOT a religion in my opinion !!
<LI>Jesus Christ is here for everyone, the way they are.  They don't have to change.  If God wants you change He'll let you know.
<LI>'Ashadu'an La Illaha Ill Allah, Wahdahu La Shareekala'
<LI>Don't hurt yourself. Don't hurt others. Don't meddle.
<LI>CHRISTIANITY IS TRASH!
<LI>Religion is personal and should be lived by the individual, not forced on others who may believe differently
<LI>I believe in me.
<LI>I consider myself more "spriritual" than religious.  I am offended by the Christian Right -- I believe they have turned more people off to the values and principles within personal religious belief than any other factor in our society today.  
<LI>As Buddha said: try to benefit others, not to harm them, and always purify your mind
<LI>I stand on the laws of Physics - matter and energy can't be destroyed...therefore, we have to go SOMEWHERE...
<LI>Spirituality is more important than religion
<LI>Christianity is not suppose to be a religion but a relationship with Jesus Christ 
<LI>The key is finding my purpose for being here.  To find my purpose I need to identify my stakeholders - God, myself, other fellow travellers - and find out what they want.  This then becomes my purpose.  (At 56 I'm still working on it!)
<LI>God so loved the world that he gave his only begoten son so that we could have everlasting life
<LI>I believe mainly in humanitarianism.  Christianity is outdated and merely to guide the sheep of the world through life (for a price, of course)
<LI>The belief in one God and his prophet (Muhammad Ibn Abdullah)
<LI>I hate the word 'religion'.  Jesus saved us from sin and the entrapments of  religion so we could be free to serve and love him and to live as his example on earth pointing to God.
<LI>I believe that there is no god and that religion is a system used to control what people think and do.
<LI>I respect nature and the world we live in. I believe in the cycles of life.
<LI>no faith, no life
<LI>If it harms no one, including yourself, do what you will.
<LI>We are accountable for our own actions, only God is to judge - not man.
<LI>confessing to god that you are a sinner and accepting the perfect sacrifice (Jesus! dying on the cross) as your personal savior.
<LI>Organized religion is the most heinous crime perpetrated in the history of mankind.  The mileniums-long orgy of self repression engendered by organizers of religion is unspeakably vile. Why do we put up with it?
<LI>There is absolutely NO evidence of any higher power. Evolution has volumes of proven evidence.
<LI>Religion should follow a natural path; should not be contrived. Inner-peace, being at peace with one's self, is the key.
<LI>I believe in the Bible as the True source of Jesus Christ and his teachings.  I also believe that to be a Christian I need to be tolerant of others religious beliefs as I would hope they would be of mine.
<LI>I believe Jehovah God's universal soverinty will be vindicated in the upcoming battle of Armagedon.  The history of mankind has proven that us as humans make terrible rulers.  We are wrong to beleive that us as mere humans can bring everlasting peace and an end to all human suffering.
<LI>That which is, shall be.  That which shall be, is.  Such is the way.
<LI>The New Testament presents God's offer of salvation to all who will accept his will and are obedient to it.
<LI>The concept of personal salvation is of paramount importance. By this I mean realizing that you are a sinner, repenting, and accepting the unspeakable gift of salvation given to us freely by Christ's blood sacrifice.
<LI>none
<LI>tHERE IS ONLY ONE gOD
<LI>I believe in direct accountability and service to God in all actions and choices made throughout the day reguardless of manmade religious structures.
<LI>I believe in a higher power, but I think that religion is generally an institution used to suppress the working classes of people, and to guarantee their submission to the rulers of society.  Christianity has been and remains especially bad about this.  In addition, Christianity is basically the used-car salesman of religion.  Throughout its history, it has regularly changed its beliefs to appeal to believers in various ages until now it does not even resemble the Christianity that Jesus tought.  If Ch
istianity were truly the religion of Jesus, it would be a good thing, but it isn't.
<LI>Everyone should have one for others to critisize.  Not allowing critisizm defeats the purpose. Slack!
<LI>There is no beginning or end to religion. It cannot be seperated from the whole of life just as you cannot seperate God from the whole of life any more than you could have a river without the water. Ahhh... But I told and that is cheating in this little game of hide and seek. God's best invention? Time!
<LI>i hate shia because they are not on the true way of islam the are belive in the wrong person to be the proffet .
<LI>Religion is completely personal and should not be enforced upon anyone else.  There are too many religions in the country for there to be one ruling religion.  Until religion is no longer a part of our government, its citizens will never be truly free.
<LI>The purpose of religion is to promote the unity of humankind.
<LI>I believe God has given us the ability to reason about religious injunctions and their place in whatever society we live in.  I also believe that we can only strive to understand that which God has surrounded us with, rather than understand God Himself.
<LI>Jesus Christ died for our sins and he will return and take the ones who have acepted him into there heart to heaven .Also the Bible is the only truth.
<LI>Jesus
<LI>to look for the Truth, you should not be only  emotionnal, but try to be rationnal and objective too. If you find  gross mistakes in your holy book don't try to excuse them, try to find out why.
<LI>Too long to describe here man, but I figured it all out.  Do what feels right, thats the conclusion, want the proof, find me!
<LI>Right now, all I believe is that someone or something is looking after me.  A Guardian Angel, so to speak.  I also believe in treating others they way I would like to be treated in return.  I don't believe in pushing my beliefs on others and I despise those who do.
<LI>I appreciate knowing that after I die I will be reunited with loved ones in Heaven.
<LI>If relating to a structure does help psychologically some people and if the religious structure is not authoritarian nor totalitarian, than it is socially usefull
<LI>to believe in god provides a healthy spiritual life
<LI>There is only one path to heaven --- Jesus Christ
<LI>I have a very hard time beliving in God, and I know that the Bible is a book of fables.  What is there to believe in?
<LI>God has an individual plan for each of us.
<LI>Time exists only because we are unable to precieve everything at once.  Everything that could ever happen has already happened and we may CHOOSE our own path through the infinate choices.  There is only ONE life and YOU are EVERYONE.. (you get multiple trips through the matrix).. Everyone has their own personal reality -> if you believe in something it is REAL for you (like God fot instance) but not always real for others..
<LI>You are the only person in control of your life. Anything else is only escapisim, lack of  your own self worth.
<LI>There is definitely something out there but what it is I don't know, and I don't believe half the people who say they do, do either.  As far as Evolution vs. Creation, one does not necessarily rule out the other.  Perhaps a Creator placed simple life in this universe to see what it would evolve into. 
<LI>Sapien--One cannot be more than a reasoning being. Nothing is greater than REASON.
<LI>Add Quar'an and Haddith to question #13.
<LI>God is our Father; Literally. He loves us, his Children and wants us to suceed, to grow spiritually and to use our time here on earth to exercise our faith, improve on our talents and show love and concern for those about us.
<LI>If there is a devil, it would have to be the Catholic Church.
<LI>In the begining, God was lonely so he split himself up so that he may always have friends. We are all touched by the divine and are ourselves divine if we would but see it. Some people have just lost thier sight of this. What it boils down to os that in the end, though our friends may help us, if we are to be saved we must take responsibility for our actions (no devine scapegoat here) and save ourselves. Get a Life. Take Responsibility. Save Yourself. You're the Only One Who CAN!
<LI>I believe in myself, in people, in the individual, in the golden rule, and in being!
<LI>I want for my sister what I want for myself
<LI>"Religion" is man's attempt to reach God; it's a relationship with Him that counts; specifically, knowing and serving Jesus Christ. Personal acceptance or rejection of Him is the "bottom line" metric in God's books.
<LI>God is everything, God is everywhere 
<LI>I believe there is a difference between religion and spirituality.  Religion eqates institutions with rules and regulations where as spirituality is something much deeper, personal, profound and passionate.
<LI>It is something that you must find, and it is not an establishment, like Mc donalds or something, and it is not in neat little categories, but that is okay for the purpouse of this survey...
<LI>In regards to Christianity--The christian church has taken what was initially a doctrine of peace, love, and acceptance from a beatnik philosopher and turned it into a dogma of hatred and exclusion.  I have no problem with Jesus the philosopher & teacher, but I have every problem with the idea of his divinity and what amounts to a mass cult of personality-The Church.   
<LI>Honor God first and then treat mankind as you should treat yourself
<LI>Islamic is the answer to all the worrys of the world.
<LI>WHERE DID GOD COME FROM?
<LI>I believe that God exists, whether or not people acknowledge Him.  Christ, His Son came to reveal God and save humankind from a fallen state of being--one God allowed as a human choice.  We can receive salvation here and now and in all eternity.  Salvatio
<LI>Treat your fellow man as a friend - till he proves otherwise.
<LI>i believe that god is a spirit and the human names we have given him are making things confussing. because we are dealing with spiritual laws there is no need for color, gender, or anything other then spirit. we must worship in spirit and truth only and god will reveal  himself (spirit) to us.
<LI>All men are sinners.  Jesus Christ was crucified on the Cross to pay the debt for all man's sin.  He was raised on the third day to give all those who believe in him Eternal life in Heaven.  If you do not believe and ask God to be saved, you will spend eternity in Hell.
<LI>I think that religion is a personal choice/belief and it should remain that way. To try and regulate government, etc. etc. etc. by one religion is bigoted.
<LI>Religion first evolved in ancient Mesopotamina as a way to explain and soothe fear of such things as death, sickness, hurt, pain. People are afraid of "their god" and worship it to aid them in things they cannot decifer.
<LI>Your heaven or hell may very well be lived on earth within your lifetime.
<LI>We are normal beings with great intelligence, and we try to make something of life by making up religions.
<LI>Seek truth in all things...there is a higher purpose...
<LI>Jesus is Lord,He atoned for our sins, no one comes to the Father except through Him.
<LI>I am a Southern Baptist, formerly Jewish, who believes that God has a special plan for Jewish people which is different from His salvation plan for Christians.  It upsets me when I see others targeting Jews specifically to be converted.  The Gospel needs to be shared with EVERYONE.  
<LI>Religion is a personal thing and is necessary for us in regulating and disciplining our lives but we should not impose things on others.
<LI>Religion can be a good thing BUT....
<LI>While I am a devout Roman Catholic I do not believe in the Bible. The Bible has been translated, interpreted and twisted to be a horribly bigoted arrangement of words. People need to keep religion to themselves. Attempts to force religion on people has ca
<LI>Religion is best kept inside. Sharing with others is great, but any attempt to convert or push your own beliefs on someone else is juvenile, wrong, stupid, misguided, a sign of insecurity, not in the best interests of that person, and common.
<LI>Religion is one to himself, There are two many different possibilities to decide. 
<LI>In my opinion, religion (defined as a set of beliefs which are organized under one or more leaders or higher beings so that the overall structure is heirarchical) is created and maintained in order to control the masses.
<LI>I prefer not to think of myself as religious, but as a Christian. I have a personal relationship with Christ that affects every aspect of my life. I believe that the only way to heaven is through faith in Jesus Christ and accepting his gift of forgiveness and grace.
<LI>Without God's teachings as a base, you lose your anchor in life; you become too fragile to weather major crises
<LI>Religion is the conerstone of a culture and most be a part of a family and community's belief systems.
<LI>i think spirituality is much healthier than religion
<LI>People have a tendency to accept whatever their parents taught them and do not understand the true meaning of being a Christian nor have they carefully digested the words of Jesus in the New Testament.  When any one tells me they have the only way to Heaven--I run.  If this was true there are many people who can't be "saved"
<LI>Unquestioning FAITH leads to Unquestioned HARM
<LI>Religion is a social construction that helps normalize human interactions, make people more accountable to one another, and to simplify what is unknown or unclear in the world.
<LI>I haven't decided yet, but I believe Christianity is probably right.  I just find it hard to believe such enities as God exist and that humans are anything besides "DEAD" after they die!  It's not logical.  And what will you DO forever and ever in Heaven?  Won't we get so bored after a while we wish we didn't exist??
<LI>I FEEL THAT CHRIST IS HERE TO SAVE AND LOVE US ALL IF WE FOLLOW HIM AND LOVE AS HIS SON DID, THAT MEANS RESPECTING DIFFERENCES IN ALL PEOPLE AND CULTURLES
<LI>The evidence for any God is precisely the same as the evidence for Santa Claus.  There is just no reason to give such credence and respect to what are essentially fairy tales.
<LI>I feel many people use religion as a crutch. Instead of handling their life and problems themselves they wait for some miracle to happen and if it doesn't they can say it was "God's" will. HA! PEople need to take responsibility for their actions, opinions,etc...   
<LI>John 14:6 Jesus said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man comes to the (God) Father but by me."
<LI>Religion is to people what the herder is to sheep... makes them mindless & willing to follow anything!
<LI>Trust in GOD in ALL things.
<LI>Love God with all your heart, and love your neighbor as you love yourself.
<LI>There are many paths to enlightenment.  The worst of all sins is arrogantly believing that your beliefs are 100% absolute and right.  I have a prayer . . Oh Lord, protect me from those to whom you speak directly.
<LI>without religion, my life has no meaning at all  !!!
<LI>God is a Universal Concious, all living things are God.  Respect the life giving earth and we can respect ourselves better.
<LI>The Wiccan Rede: And it harm none, do what thou wilt.
<LI>I believe there must be more than the man. I'm curious about the universum, what it is and how it works. But I don't believe in God as a person. I believe in extraterrestrical intelligence, but not in UFOs !
<LI>respect all religions--they all speak the same language esoterically
<LI>Its About Peace and Joy
<LI>I no longer go to church because I believe that a church is a state of mind and a God is your mind helping you to find what you are looking for 
<LI>There is no god but allah and mohammad is his messenger
<LI>islam is my religion, I am getting the information to follow the shia sect of islam as I am suppose to 
<LI>I am a Southern Baptist, formerly Jewish, who believes that God has a special plan for Jewish people which is different from His salvation plan for Christians.  It upsets me when I see others targeting Jews specifically to be converted.  The Gospel needs to be shared with EVERYONE.  
<LI>RELIGION IS THE KEY TO LIFE GOD IS EVERYTHING
<LI>Religiously, I am extremely proud to be American for two reasons: freedom of religion and separation of church and state.  I am very religious, but I STRONGLY support each fellow citizen's right to believe anything else, or nothing at all.  Thomas Jefferson said it best: "It makes no difference to me whether my neighbor believes in one God or thirty; it neither picks my pocket, nor breaks my leg!  Only a lie needs the support of a government.  The truth can stand on its own!"
<LI>I really do not believe the light is a religion, Forever= Forever
<LI>the removal of all religous  references from public education has transformed our culture into one of feel good irresponsibility  and blame 
<LI>I think w/out GOD you are lost!
<LI>Only a divine guidance can lead the world out of its troubles, man made laws will be implemented and repealed but true guidance is from God, Islam is the truth.
<LI>I believe that Jesus came to earth and took on the sins of the world, and died for all of us.  We must believe in Him and ask Him into our lives.  He gave his life so that all may go to heaven but... God will have no puppets.  It is our choice.  God's way or our way.  If we want to go to heaven then we must choose His way by receiving Jesus into our hearts.  Jesus is the only way into heaven.  There is no other door.
<LI>God is absolutely one. He has no partners, no parents, no children and nothing shares in divinity with him. There is nothing whatsoever like him. He alone created everything from nothing and he alone deserves to be worshipped and obeyed.
<LI>All the religions around are a bunch of garbage.
<LI>The government should keep out of my womb ,take in god we trust off our money,take it out of the pledge of allegiance, and anywhere else the god myth concept shows itself in government documents or proceedings
<LI>Righteous (by prayer+) forces rule over Evil ! 
<LI>Live and let live - Freedom of choice to believe or not believe as long as it doesn't affect anyone else
<LI>i  believe that everyone should have awareness of other religions and be tolerant. i also believe tha
<LI>Matthew 25:31-46  clarifies it all
<LI>I'm an atheist. I get pissed off when religionists say that atheists are amoral (or even immoral). I have very strong moral beliefs: I believe in honesty, integrity, and tolerance of diverse viewpoints, and live my life accordingly. I do feel that religion has worked much good in many people's lives, but it really bothers me that so many supposedly religious people are close-minded, intolerant, mean-spirited bigots, who can't seem to get beyond their "us vs. them" mentality. To a significant degree, a 
hink that organized religion is a destructive and divisive force in society. It should be just the opposite.
<LI>The point is to be reconciled to God who made you.
<LI>I have my own set of values which does not preach to, demean, or judge those with different view than I.
<LI>I believe that you cannot find true inner peace on this demention because of all the suffering.  If we love others and the earth, we will be able to pass into a more peaceful dimention.  Tolerence is almost as important as love.  Anyone who is good at heart will be "Saved", not one group of people with the same beliefs.  No matter what, God and Jesus are always willing to help us.
<LI>Organized religions are too often devoted to rejecting other ways of life, creating intolerance, or (perhaps worse) reassuring members that they deserve what they have, and that the less fortunate need to be patronized to (while they deserve their lot too.)  The history of organized religion is largely one of corruption and hypocracy.  Quakers seem to have the most democratic, least blameworthy history -- if only their religion were more successful in the US, we might see faster progress...
<LI>A  'Soul without a religion'  is the same as a 'Body without a Soul.'.
<LI>I am he who admires the storm.
<LI>I believe in a Greater Being but not like the GOD and JESUS of my childhood.
<LI>I don't understand.  Do people really believe these implausible things?  Are they pretending to believe in order to be accepted?  Are they pretending to themselves that they believe? And why do they all want EVERYONE to be compelled by law to follow the rules of THEIR relilgion?
<LI>Everyone should mind your own damn business!!!  Does the phrase "separation of church and state" ring any bells?  It says "church", NOT "all religions that are not christian".  People have the right to believe anything they want.  I have many morals that 
<LI>Islam is the way to happiness 
<LI>To most people, religion is a formal, structured thing.  It does not need to be that way.  Religion is different for everyone whether they be Catholics, Jews or of no formalized-Christ/God-believing-structured beliefs.  This is what makes us who we are.  IMHO, those that say "be saved or be damned" don't understand the whole concept of personal beliefs.  Personal being the key word.  Believe in the deity of your choice, if you so choose.
<LI>Everything that is in the Bible is correct. Doctrines that interpret the Bible with superb accuracy are fine. The Book of Mormon sucks.
<LI>Though I know there is no god in my life, there very well may be in the lives of others
<LI>religion is the inner peace of knowing that you believe in something that is real...  it makes the universe perfectly clear
<LI>I believe there has to be a supreme being because of the complicity of the human body alone. I was brought up to believe in the Trinity, but at this time of my life I am unsure how everything fits together in the Master's plan! 
<LI>I am a part of the Christian right, and feel the media has maligned us very much.  Please remember that the first schools, hospitals, and orpahages, were founded by Christians who share these same convictions.
<LI>I believe that each person can find their own way religiously. Priests of formalized christianity seem to teach their personal views instead of 'this is how I percieve this, read it and make up your own mind'.
<LI>The doctrines of Christianity are too coincidental, especially to someone with knowledge of Greek mythology
<LI>I believe that the earth is owned by one man(PBUH) and I believe that the folowers of that man(PBUH)are the chosen people of god if and only if they excercise piety.
<LI>I am an open-minded Christian believing in loving thy neighbor as thyself.  Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.  I call my "higher power" (and not from any "ANONYMOUS" group) God, Jesus, Holy Spirit - but that doesn't mean that the Indian or the Jew or the Buddhast or the Jehovahs Witnesses wrong or right.  Maybe we all love the same "higher power" and just call the power by diverse names.  Love is all that matters.  Don't condemn or judge others especially if you've never walked in thei
 moccasins.  Any term a worshipper uses (whether it be God or Jehovah) that leads to good, peace, unity and love is what it's all about.  If we'd all cop that point of view, maybe we could get something done TOGETHER!
<LI>All religions have the power to help or hinder...only humans can taint the divine, and we have.
<LI>We are all spiritual entities here to learn and grow, we are all part of one being.  Love is what will bring us together.
<LI>i believe that everything Is, and Is valid.  my personal approach include, daoism, buddhism, discordianism, chaos, and generally, learning to be the best human being i can manage to be.
<LI>Seek you own answers. Don't rely on some prefabricated notion relayed by some self serving "servents of god".
<LI>Religion helps, if you find the right one!
<LI>Fulfillment and life are found only in the person of Jesus Christ.  Christians are to spread the love and acceptance of Christ, not hatred or political agendas.
<LI>For me religion is a process by which "God" is helping mankind grow up
<LI>Man created God.
<LI>There is magic(or God, sprituality, whatever you want to call it) going on around you, all the time, in everything. The key is to see it and/or experiance it. Develop a sense of wonder. You will be happier for doing so.
<LI>i do not know yet
<LI>Too many "Christians", too little Christianity
<LI>we are born, we live, we die. it has always been so. it is an endless cycle wherein we exist in a constant state of chaos. it's very pretty so why should i not dance?
<LI>Life happens. Supreme being? Why not. Something does not come from nothing.
<LI>Don't harm anyone if possible, contribute to your community, love thyself and as many other people as you can
<LI>Religious beings, including deities, but also including prophets and teachers, and supernatural beings, are metaphors representing concepts in human life.  For example, God (or at least my version of Him) represents the infinite potential of humanity if it overcame all adversity and achieved perfection,  in other words, a gestalt of humanity and all life acting together in harmony.  Real-life humanity has a LOOOONG way to go to approach that ideal.
<LI>Humans should care about humans and not hope for imaginary magical solutions
<LI>prayer was removed from the schools...look whats happened
<LI>Only God is the true judge.
<LI>This was fun.  I always wanted my belief system reduced to a series of multiple choice questions.  It's so...trivializing.
<LI>Ethics derives from metaphysics.  Those who believe in the supernatural will not arrive at a rational ethics.
<LI>God loves us unconditionally.  He is always with us, always wanting to love us, we need only open our hearts.
<LI>God is our Father and we are his children, brothers and sisters in his family.
<LI>The worst things that have happened on this planet have religeon as their cause, when KKKristians abuse me for their sexual orientation they 'forget' that I have not been responsible for the unjustified killing of millions of other people who did not agree with their belief systems
<LI>Basically I believe in the tried and true values of what's right and what's wrong and live by them
<LI>All creatures are equal.One should use their life to help protect the enviornment.Live in peace!
<LI>God is my goal and His Redha is my aim
<LI>I do not believe in a God or supernatural being per se, but there are some aspects of spirituality which I think must be examined in a more scientific empirical manner.
<LI>You need to be open to the Spirit and allow Him to direct you. We need to seek the will of the Father and respond to His directing. 
<LI>Harm none.
<LI>Judaism believes that our purpose here is to make the world better.  Can there be any goal better, higher, or more worthy?  Make the world better by eradicating racism, hate, intolerance, and disrespect.  Take care of that, and 90% of the world's problems will disappear.
<LI>Religion allows people to give up personal responsibility, they often feel that "god" will tell them the right thing to do instead of making their own choices 
<LI>Overly religious people need to get on with their lives.
<LI>Try to treat everyone well. You yourself will be a better person.
<LI>I don't think everything in our great world was created by some freak accident.
<LI>I believe that it is not our place to judge one another's choices in life (i.e abortion or homosexuality)  that is God's job -- not mine.  My "job" is to follow the teachings of Jesus Christ and be the best person I can be so as to set an example for our children.
<LI>To re-establish Islam as the supreme Ideology. To look after the affairs of the poeple, in a just manner.
<LI>I am part of the cosmic spirit, and it flows through me, bringing me the wealth and benefits of the universe
<LI>I used to be a strong, Fundamentalist Pentecostal Christian, but I have come to see (by means of studying modern biblical scholarship) that the inerrant attitude towards the Bible is without a strong logical foundation and thus many of the beliefs derived from the Bible should not be accepted at face value.  Rather, they should be tested for reasonability.  I believe that what God says is true, not because God's word is the standard for truth, but because God only says true things.  In other words, the
standard of truth is independant of God.
<LI>God came to earth and redeemed mankind and founded one,true Church, the Roman Catholic Church.  I believe everything the Church teaches.
<LI>Churches seem to be nothing more than "semi-private" clubs. The building, facilities, and religious/worship-based entertainment is open to the public. You are free to participate as well. BUT...the congregation is by invitation only. It is not possible to be known and accepted inside the church until you are known and accepted OUTSIDE the church. The established members of the church must know you that way or your efforts are in vain.
<LI>Faith is, by definition, something that is not tangible and impossible to prove. I believe its greatest value is that of a source of strength for difficult time. It should be kept as a personal matter.
<LI>The universe is bigger than you can imagine
<LI>There is only one Religion, the Religion of God. All the "world religions" are just chapters in the book.
<LI>Use reason (and spell "Atheism" and "polygamy" correctly next time)
<LI>Take heed of God's phophets (peace be upon them all) and do not be led astray, for Allah can crush you like a blood-swollen tick if He so chooses.
<LI>jews are the devil
<LI>Nothing actually exist in this universe, but we can thouch by our eye, ear, skin, etc. 
<LI>God is an atheist
<LI>Finding a personal path that lends some insight into your experience.
<LI>Organized religion will be reponsible for the decline and eventual extinction of humanity.
<LI>A person without some sort of a positive religious foundation is a lost soul.
<LI>And it harm none, do what you will
<LI>Do what thou wilt and that shall be the law. However, remember that an unjust blow travels the circle three times. So does a "good deed".
<LI>The doorway to reformation is never closed to any soul, here or hereafter.
<LI>Be kind to others. Be tolerant. Work hard. Love.
<LI>I belive that everyone has the right to believe in what they wish to based on their reasoning. As far as the wicca goes, I believe in the duality of life and the sacredness of all things.
<LI>Ephesians 2:8
<LI>I believe there is no hell, because we have enough hell on earth.
<LI>I believe without knowing. Death with reveal the truth.
<LI>Religion = nonsense
<LI>be yourself, and regulate yourself by principles set by the wise men of time, (both religous characters and non-religous)
<LI>It's as naive to firmly not believe as to believe; therefore I am open-minded. However, whilst following no religion, I have my own strong personal code of ethics, and believe always in honesty, loyalty, and the pursuit of understanding.
<LI>If the world does not have religion, the world will end up killing itself
<LI>I think you should live life at its fullest, RESPECTING what other people do and believe, as long as you dont hurt anyone in anyway. "El respeto al derecho ajeno es la paz".
<LI>Be a good person. Don't harm anyone else, and hope for the best.  :)
<LI>I believe that most of the world does not understand the truth about God and his intention for our lives.  I regret that most people use their religion to destroy God's creation through hatred and self-righteousness.  Let us be merciful, loving and forgiving.  None of us are without sin.  All of us fall short of God's grace.  Do you want to be judged the same way you judge others?  I really wonder why God allows us to suffer through this life.  What is his design or purpose?
<LI>I happen to be United Methodist and the lay leader of my local church however I have a somewhat different view than the typical Prodestant in that I believe that God is in all things animate or inanimate and thus we need to respect everything around us because if we don't we are being disrespectful of God.
<LI>Concious will creates reality, but we've lost touch with the part of mind that allows us to connect with the invisible forces behind the world.  The way to get in touch with this is through raw personal mystical experience, and huge late-night festivals full of smoke, bonfires, strobing lights, and half-naked people vibrating to trance-inducing beats couldn't hurt.
<LI>Have respect for the unknowable -- in heaven, in fellow humans and in oneself.
<LI>Everyone needs God and Jesus deep down in their hearts.
<LI>I believe there is a supreme being (possibly) and Christianity is the result of people who are afraid of the unknown
<LI>God was created by man.
<LI>God gave us all our own minds and the ability of choice, therefore it is up to us to live our own lives and not act like His programmed little robots.  As long as we do not intentionally hurt anything or anybody, than nothing is wrong.
<LI>God is  that  which is the same in all people and things -- the simple common denominator, if you will.  (No point in anthropomorphizing it, except  as metaphor.)
<LI>read some books on near death experiences, they're very persuasive and total strangers get almost the same exact conclusions
<LI>tolerante yet accusing of unbending religions and religious leaders such as the Pope and his attitude to abortion and birth control among Catholic people which has led to the huge increase in the number of people with AIDS especially in the South American countries.
<LI>None  (Life philosophy, however: humanism).
<LI>Jesus is coming back, and boy, is He mad!
<LI>No object worth worshiping But Alla(god)
<LI>Sometimes I feel that there are forces at work in the world, both good and bad.  I also think that humans have a hunger and intellectual and emotional drive to explain the unexplainable- why was it someone else on the TWA flight 800 and not me or my loved ones?  I often think that even though this concept of "God" does not exist, it has been necessary for us to create him; to answer our most unanwerable questions.
<LI>religion is a key to heaven 
<LI>Jesus Christ is the our Lord and Savior.  The only way to heaven is through Him in accepting his Lordship and to seek his righteousness daily.
<LI>dispensational orthodox Christianity
<LI>I believe that your soul will last, but I don't believe in "God" I belive that we all hold a great deal of powers that we are unaware of
<LI>It is WHAT Christ taught that is important...and Buddha, and Muhammed, etc.  Not the question as to when he's going to return.  It is the teachings of religions that I use to build my own.  As for afterlife, I believe we are all part of a unified spirit: individuals, yet joined in spirit.
<LI>I believe in a social philosophy. Try to make it better for everyone while you are here.
<LI>I have sinned many times in many ways and cannot make amends or pay my debts. I cannot save myself and I deserve punishment. Only Jesus Christ, the Son of God, who gave His life in payment for our sins, can save us. 
<LI>Regardless of my beliefs, I should respects the rights and feelings of others.
<LI>love one another, and dont be taken in by cults (Mormons and Johova Wittnesses
<LI>I don't have a strict religion, but I believe that God exists within all of us, but that nobody can honestly claim to speak chiefly for Him because we all are a form of Him, even animals and plants.
<LI>Religion is a cruch for crippled minds
<LI>We are here to make the world better.  Being respectful of other beliefs and being intolerant of racism will help achieve that end.  Right wing Christians are dangerous, bigoted, unfair, and murderous.  More people have been murdered in the name of Christ than any other cause.  I know many Christ-loving people who are good, but when I hear people like Pat Robertson and Patrick Buchanan, I am reminded of how dangerous and Hiter-like these two leaders are.  I hope good sense and an obligation to goodness
will overcome the hate they represent.
<LI>Evolution is too obvious, and not just the evoulution of "Us" in the past.  But the obvious indications that everything in our Universe functions acording to laws that are so perfect indicates to me that there is a creator.  It's just that our creator created the "Laws of God" and then let evolution run.  Understanding God means striving to understand the beauty of these laws.  
<LI>Walk in faith with Jesus.
<LI>God didn't make man; man made god.
<LI>i believe that we live through numerous lives in order to progress spiritually.  in order to do this, we must protect life (of all kinds) upon this planet by acting out of and encouraging compassion, peace, and collaboration.
<LI>Go where God says to go, do what God says to do, when God says to do it, and He will confirm His Word with signs following!
<LI>the golden rule
<LI>im a christian 
<LI>Got my own
<LI>born-again
<LI>Sri Sydasti! This statement is a mirror, when a mirror looks in, no prophecy looks out. Keep the Sacred Chao, my life is my apple.
<LI>Like everything else in life, religion is relative. There's a continuum that ranges from the total non-believers to the overly strict adherents. Then ther's everyone in between. You should believe what you feel. Listen to your heart(conscience), it's probably the best guide. Love to you all, smiles and happiness on you and those you love.
<LI>Somewhere out there is a natural law, presented to the world via different religions, with one common goal - maintaining peace.
<LI>Humanism is a commitment to reason, freedom, and responsibility.
<LI>Humans are the true gods!!!
<LI>Apart from REligions few admirable points.. religion is solely the most destructive force on the planet... More wars have ensued because of religion than all the other reasoning combined.
<LI>All people are created by God, born as sinners and will die a physical AND a spiritual death unless they are born again -- to be born again is to believe that Jesus is the Christ, the son of God, and that we are guaranteed eternal spiritual life by accepting and trusting in His gift of grace through his death and resurrection.
<LI>Islam is answer to everything.
<LI>Do what thou will, but harm none.
<LI>Follow the teachings of the Bible.  Homosexual is not a civil rights it is a behavorial problem but if a homosexual asked Gods forgivness and then gives up that life style and accepts Christ as his Lord and Savior then he will reach the Kingdom of Heaven.
<LI>Religion is the cause of most if not all of the world's troubles.
<LI>The whole principle should lay on the love of Jesus into once life
<LI>I dont beleive everything and I hate those damn christians
<LI>Love
<LI>Some people would say I've committed sins; I say that I've made mistakes. But rather than be punished for them, I have learned from them, and that is the reason I am here (on Earth, or in this realm, as it were). "Religion" is very different from Spiritua
<LI>we are all a holotropic projection of God
<LI>All any religions are, are guidelines, by which values are taught.  Religion should never be used as an excuse.
<LI>i have found a greater peace within since i rejected christian teachings and started thinking for myself...walt whitman is my teacher now...
<LI>You find out when you die.  I have no need to worry myself in my lifetime over religion, because I don't know anything.  I don't know what happens when you die or anything.  I don't believe in the bible, but I could defintely agree to believing in God, if I had proof.  One main reason I choose not to believe in life, is to not set myself up for a downfall (because, afterall, what if there is not God, no Heavan; What Then?).
<LI>IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE, THAT THEIR IS A DIFFERANCE IN HAVEING RELIGON AND HAVING A PERSONAL EXPERIANCE WITH THE LORD JESUS CHRIST! IT WAS "RELIGOUS PEOPLE" THAT CRUCIFIED HIM, AND ARE STILL THE MAIN FORCE BEHIND THE WORLD TROUBLES! IN REVELATIONS, SATAN SETS UP HIS THRONE [PLACE OF AUTHORITY AND RULE]...IN THE CHURCH.[RELIGOUS SYSTEMS OF MAN!] BUT GOD IS BRINGING A CHURCH OUT OF A CHURCH! A PEOPLE OUT OF A PEOPLE! A NATION OUT OF A NATION! AND EVERY KNEE SHALL BOW, AND CONFESS HIM LORD,AS THE KINGDOMS
OF OUR LORD. . .BECOME THE KINGDOMES OF OUR LORD AND "HIS CHRIST!"
<LI>God is not unlike Aristotle's "unmoved mover."  We know God through moral interaction with each other and through our experiences with creation.  There is no personal God who intervenes in the daily affairs of humankind.  But the absence of a personal God doesn't preclude moral absolutes.    
<LI>"For the wages of sin is death but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord."
<LI>Religion is something to enlighten and uphold humans through life, but also something God wants us to "participate" in.
<LI>It is possible to improve oneself and live a better life.
<LI>The kingdom of God is within.
<LI>I think that if god exists,  it's not reachable anyone and doesn't particularly care about anybody.  If it exists, that's all it does--exist.
<LI>i just make it up as i go along, so theres much too much to even attempt to place here.
<LI>Religion is the ultimate two-edged sword. When wielded wisely, it is protection. When foolishly, destructive.
<LI>IF YOU BELIEVE ENOUGH, IT WILL DO YOU GOOD. I.E. WITCHCRAFT ONLY WORKS IF YOU REALLY BELIEVE IT DOES.
<LI>Taking from Harriet Martineau, current religious mysticism is a prelude towards an atheist enlightenment.  Reality can be explained by rational means just because people haven't found the answer yet is no reason to conclude that a god is the reason for being.  Everyone is an atheist, I just happen to believe in one less god than those who claim to be theists.  Religion breeds and encourages ignorance, choose science as a better alternative.
<LI>Personal responsibility, love of each other and the earth, value in all life.
<LI>Religion is what each person believes either siritually or morally.  My belief lies somewhere between science and nature.
<LI>I was kind of hoping that human kind grow out of its superstitutions.
<LI>Believe in myself. 
<LI>Let the wankers believe.
<LI>The biggest suvey is yet to come...:)
<LI>be truthful
<LI>A supreme being must have created the universe, and is AT LEAST 50% female.  If everyone followed the Golden Rule, life would be really nice.
<LI>Live and let live, I respect you're beliefs, now please respect mine (or my lack of).
<LI>24, Solar Deity Sun, 1977-1999
<LI>live a decent life and you have nothing to worry about.
<LI>A man without a religion is like a car without headlights.  There is nothing to guide him to get to where he or she wants to be.
<LI>"The worst moment for an atheist is when he is thankful and has no one to thank."
<LI>I believe in the Biblr as the word og God, and tried to live by it to the best of my knowledgr and abiliti.
<LI>Consciousness creates reality; there is only One Mind.
<LI>number 14 said it--besides the Big Bang theory..
<LI>Religions of the world are based on common principles.  These truths are how we accept and live within our humanity while accepting something larger than ourselves..
<LI>Find out who you really are and help others to do the same
<LI>I cannot tell if there is a supreme being or not, but i try to stay away from all forms of organised religion, big or small. I try to be tactfull when talking to religious people, but it is not always possible. However, i do have religious friends, and we get along ok if we don't talk about science or religion.
<LI>God cares greatly for each of us, he is available to us simply by asking, he has given us so very much, and like a parent, is disapointed when his children turn their backs on him.  We will all make our own way, and everyone is not ready for the same thing, I hope that we can all arive where we wish to be.
<LI>God's word is the absolute truth.
<LI>To believe things that lack support and run against proven fact is stupid and dangerous. And that is what religion is.
<LI>God created everything. Science can't prove evolution but it can prove creation...reluctantly!
<LI>If it wasn't for the threat of hell, I would probably be agnostic.
<LI>Live and let life; keep a communal concept and strive to live better.
<LI>i believe that when u die you die...that's it..nuthin, no afterlfe just nuthin but u decomposing in the ground (not that u would notice as u r dead)
<LI>I believe that there is a heaven and hell and every action you take has consequences 
<LI>Agape Love
<LI>Since nothing about religion has been proven, I must assume that none of us have souls.  And upon death we will cease to exist.  As for how the creation of the universe was initiated, I'm not sure.
<LI>This is my body given up for me.
<LI>Do not initiate coercion (force or fraud) -- don't do anything to anyone that you would not want done to you.
<LI>There No deity but Allah & Muhammed is his messanger
<LI>Be Excellent to each other !
<LI>Jesus Christ is the Son of God who dies for our sins and was ressurected.  He desires a personal relationship with everyone and offers Gods grace to all who will accept him.
<LI>Religion is beneficial, if they do not use it as a crutch
<LI>Each to their own - it is up to each of us to find our own spiritual path and to follow it as best we can.
<LI>We're all in this at the same time, make the best of it for self and others
<LI>That only the Almighty Allah swt who created us knows our everyday needs, that's why we have to thank him constantly for the rahmah bestowed on us.
<LI>Trust Jesus...Just say his name.  You will find peace.  Believe.
<LI>Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved.
<LI>The "answer" is not known nor knowable.
<LI>The U.S. was founded on Christianity.  Our move away from the principles of our founding fathers is destroying our country.
<LI>Religion is the greatest evil in the world today.  Death to the meak.  The strong shall inherit the earth.
<LI>Religion provides structure and place to state beliefs.  Spiritualism is belief and love for God    Religion is different from Spirituality
<LI>I wrote that religion is personal. However, I also agree that religion is necessary/helps to maintain values. It's easier to follow a guideline from god than to decide for ourselves; we come back to a cannibal tribe, by whom it is "right" to eat another person. I believe in god, but I also disbelieve that lightening will strike you down if you do something wrong. I think god cares more about how we interact with eachother and the world than if we slight Him. I wrote that religion is somewhat destructiv
 because I've found that instead of religious people understanding that the basis for religion is loving everyone, not despite their beleifs but because they are god's creations, they use their religion to set up barriers between themselves and anyone who does not view god *exactly* as they do. And that is sad.
<LI>THAT YOU MUST CONFESE WITH YOUR MOUTH AND IN YOUR HEART TO BE SAVED
<LI>Do not remove a speck from another's eye until you've removed the board from your own.
<LI>Jesus Christ is the only true living God through whom is eternal life.
<LI>This was hard to complete. Actually, religion is man's attempt to reach god. True Christianity is Gods plan to reach man. 
<LI>Regarding question 6 - I also believe reincarnation is possible.
<LI>Ther are a lot of falsehoods in the field of religion, but without understanding that one IS an immortal spiritual being, and with responsibility for his/her actions, the individual will not do as well. 
<LI>A free state should hae absolute separation of church and state; e.g., churches should be taxed as any other business.
<LI>Yeshua-Jesus-God-is the begining and ending --everyone will see that one day--my one mission in life is to be Jesus'plan on earth and prepare for his return --
<LI>I believe in ten terms/values ,love,friendship,trust,duty,respect,honor, etc these things are important to me a I live my life in accordance to their value.  these values are encompassed in many religions in some form or another.
<LI>There is a god. Nice guy who watches lots of cable tv. I say: Thanks for creating the world. He didnt have to so i won;t worship him.
<LI>To subit to the will of the one Divine being (ALLAH)
<LI>I think it's pure silliness to believe in a make-believe supreme being... I used to believe and now am embarrassed at how foolish I once was.
<LI>I am not religious but I believe there is a god. Religion is human made and that does not impress me.  I've been very angry at religious groups lately for the way they want to tell us what to do. I have something to say to all of them.  Do you want a say? Then start paying taxes like everybody else!!!
<LI>Belief in one God{Allah}& that Mohammad {sas} is the last Profet & Messenger,belief in the Angels,life after death,the day of judgement,all the books of God that were sent {that have not been changed} This is what a Muslim believes for more info about the Truth about Islam please send e-mail to abdeen@megahits.com
<LI>Typically Anglican, and enjoyably so.
<LI>treat people the wayyou like them to treat you ..never lie...
<LI>True Christianity is a relationship with Jesus Christ and living life according to HIS word...not following the rules of any particular church.
<LI>We cannot save ourselves.  God has done it already. When we understand that, we may as well join the party and celebrate.
<LI>I venerate the Celtic and Norse pantheons mostly, but serve the Goddess (in all her guises) above all.  I am her priestess.
<LI>To believe in hocus pocus in this day and age shows a certain amount of ignorance. That might sound harsh but its true.
<LI>There is no god but Allah, and Muhammad is the messenger of Allah!
