Here's what we do know. The Canadian markets, evidenced by the TSE 300, have corrected about 7.5% since the end of May. My 50 favourite Canadian equity funds have ranged from +3% to -17% ( for the small cap. funds). The median fund (25 of 50) was down 5%. That's a decent correction, but not enough to be considered the kind of correction that clears out previous market excesses and gets us ready for a new Bull market. Some pockets of the Canadian marketplace have done well. Over the last month, TSE Financials (especially Banks) were tops, followed by TSE Pipelines, TSE Utilities and TSE Communications indices. The worst performers were TSE Industrial Products, TSE Transports, TSE Merchandising and the TSE Golds. The TSE is still in a clear uptrend. Technically, the market is still bullish and oversold on an intermediate term but not on a long term basis. Potentially positive action in other North American markets suggests to me that a Canadian equity rally is possible from these market levels. Personally, I'd like to hold off buying more until other indices such as the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 are clearly confirming the new rally. Then we can make additional investments in the Canadian markets.<p>On the economic front, both the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC) and the Toronto Dominion Bank (TD) has released major reports on the state of the Canadian economy. They are in agreement on many key points. Our low interest rates, increased consumer spending and reduced anxiety about Quebec separation will fuel strong economic growth in Canada over the next 18 months. However, Joshua Mendelsohn, CIBC's chief economist, warns that the US Federal Reserve will probably adopt a more restrictive monetary policy in early 1997 by raising interest rates. The Canadian Gov. must follow along  just to protect the Canadian Dollar. </td><td> &nbsp</td><td background="../images/tbltile.gif" bgcolor=#c6d6c6 valign=top><center><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2><br><img src="../images/charts.gif" width=80 height=15><font face="Arial" size=-1><hr noshade color=#297b63></center>Note: Charts are<br>designed for full<br>screen viewing.<p><center><b><a href="charts/tse300.gif">TSE 300<p></a></td></tr></table><p><p><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><hr noshade color=#297b63><table border=0 width=100%><tr><td align=center><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><a href="index.html#contents"><img src="../images/back.gif" width=55 height=16 border=0 align=left></a><a href="natres.html"><img src="../images/next.gif" width=51 height=16 border=0 align=right></a><a href="index.html#contents"><img src="../images/contents.gif" width=106 height=16 border=0></a></td></tr></table><p><p><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><center><address><font size=-1><a href="../copyright.html">Copyright and Disclaimer</a></center><p><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><hr noshade><center><address><font size=-1><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left>Site design by <a href="http://www.compulinks.com">CompuLink Services</a>.<br><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left>Contact <a href="mailto:webmaster@compulinks.com">webmaster@compulinks.com</a> with comments.<br><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><a href="http://www.compulinks.com"><img src="../images/smllogo.gif" width=171 height=26 border=0 vspace=5 alt="CompuLink Services"></a></address></font><p><font color=#ffffff>73</center></body></html>
