<B><I>"Don't listen to authorities. Find out what the problem is, find out the
facts, and make up your own mind. Use the scientific method to work
things out. There's no reason why the scientific method should stay in
the lab. It can solve many problems and I wish more people would adopt
the experimental method: 'let's try this and see if it works.' There's
no reason to expect this to be the right answer. Trust your feelings
and try out various things. Use trial and error, objectivity and
plenty of alternatives."</I></B>

<FONT SIZE="+2"><I><B>The Story</B></I></FONT>
<HR>
Tulving is standing at the blackboard before a 4th year cognitive
psychology class at the U of T. They're on the fourth floor of the
newly built Sidney Smith building. It's a long unfriendly room with no
windows. A blackboard stretches the lenght of one wall. Everyone is sitting
around a big table. There's a smell of fresh paint. Tulving is
espousing his theory that memory is two part: laying down the memories
and retrieving them are separate functions. "Just because a person
cannot recall a word seen only a minute ago does not mean that the word
is not in memory," says Tulving.<P>

A student says, "Well, do you have any evidence for this."<P>

Tulving says, "But this is self evident," nevertheless noting the
doubtful expression  on the student's face. They break for coffee and
Tulving goes to his office around the corner. Deep in thought and
troubled about the situation in the classroom he comes up with an
experiment to demonstrate his point to the class. He conducts the
experiment, using the class as subjects.
He tells everyone to concentrate and listen carefully while he says
about twenty words: "Yellow", "Rifle", "Beethoven", "Violin", etc.
After he is finished he asks the class to write down as many as they
can remember. Most can get about 8 or 10. After they are done he
 picks up a student's paper and notices that she did not
remember the word "Yellow". He says, "Do you remember a colour?"
Instantly the student remembers "Yellow". He repeats this
for the other missed words with the same miraculous result. Finally, the
doubting student reluctantly admits, "Perhaps you have a point."<P>

<B>History:</B><P>

Tulving grew up in urban Estonia, the son of a judge, but enjoyed
summers at the family farm. His passion was sports, especially track
and field. "I was not at all interested in science--not one bit." Some
of his teenage thoughts: When did time begin, what was before time,
where does the universe end, ESP--is it possible? etc. Basically
Tulving was a good student, but spent most of his time pursuing
sports. His friends were fascinated by crystal radios, but he was not.
"I found it boring because it was totally predictable whereas I was
concentrating on trying to run one hundred meters in under 12
seconds." Tulving built himself a track on the family farm and
practiced everything there from the 100 meter dash to javelin
throwing.<P>

Tulving went to Gymnasium, a type of high school in Estonia although 
because of the war he finished gymnasium in Germany at age 19.
The only subject he found interesting was psychology, because it was totally
incomplete--he thought everything else was already known.<P>

Tulving left Estonia when he was 17. Because of the war and the Soviet
occupation of his country, Tulving was separated from his 
parents for the next 20
years without knowing what had happened to them.  From 1945-49 he
spent 4 years in Germany. After the war ended he worked for the Americans
 as a translator and spent one year as a medical student at Heidelberg.<P>

<HR>
Cognitive psychologists study the human mind. They ask "How do we know
anything?" or "What is a memory?" To Tulving, the human mind is the
biggest unsolved mystery in the universe. He uses brain scanners to
figure out how memory works.<P>

<BR>

1. Encoding memories<BR>
Tulving showed that memory is a two-stage process. First, memories are laid down. The front left part of the brain plays an important role in laying
down memories for specific events which occur only once (episodic memory).<P>

2. PET Scan<BR>
A PET scanner is a machine that shows what parts of your brain are especially
active while you are doing or thinking something. PET stands for <A HREF="http://www.nucmed.buffalo.edu/petdef.htm">Positron Emission Tomography</A>. <P>

3. Retrieving memories<BR>
In the second stage of memory according to Tulving, memories are retrieved.The right front and rear of the brain appear to be important for the retrieval of episodic memories. Scientists don't know why some parts of the brain encode memories and other parts retrieve them.<P>

<B>The Activity:</B><BR>

Ask a friend to name all the months of the year and time the response.
Most people can do this in about 8 seconds. Now ask the person to name
them in alphabetical order. Almost no one can do this correctly in
less than two minutes. Both questions ask you to use your memory to
retrieve something from your mind that you already know. 
Tulving's research shows why one is so much easier than the other.<P>


<B>Mystery for Future Generations: </B><BR>

Human memory is still a big mystery. 
How do we travel back into our own personal past using only our minds?<P>
