<h1>Job Creation, Economic Development, and Sustainability</h1><p>
<p>
<h2>Current Benefits</h2>
The <b><i>wind</i></b> energy industry presently supports more than 50
businesses in California; 1200 people are employed directly in these 
businesses
and another 4300 jobs have been created indirectly.  Nearly all jobs are
related to operating, maintaining, and servicing wind turbines.<p>

From <b><i>biomass</i></b> alone, 66,000 jobs are supported in the United

States, with a great many in rural areas.  By 2010, biomass power
could support more than 283,000 U.S. jobs.<p>

The Sacramento Municipal Utility District's (SMUD's) Conservation Power 
Program
has (1) spent $59 million locally on <b><i>energy-efficiency</i></b>
measures, (2) avoided spending $45 million to purchase power from other
regions, (3) increased regional income by $124 million,
(4) created about 880 direct jobs, 250 of which were SMUD employees, and
(5) added $22 million to the wage-earning households in the area.<p>

The Massachusetts State Energy Office reports that the state has realized 
a
257% growth in <b><i>energy-efficiency</i></b> firms (such as energy 
service
companies) between 1988 and 1992.<p>

Fox River Mills of Osage, Iowa, has reduced the energy cost of producing  
a
pair of socks by 29% since 1984.  This cost reduction has contributed to
<b><i>increased productivity</i></b> and increased orders from customers.  
The
mill, which employed 110 workers in 1984, employs 310 people today.  The
plant owners have expanded the size of the plant twice and added another
shift.<p>
<p>
<h2>Projected Benefits</h2>
On the <b><i>national level</i></b>, a 1992 study cosponsored by the 
Solar
Energy Industries Association, the American Gas Association, and the 
Alliance
to Save Energy conservatively projects 175,000 new jobs by 2010, with an 
energy
scenario emphasizing efficiency improvements, renewables, and strategic 
use of
natural gas.<p>

The value of renewable energy equipment <b><i>exports</i></b> reached 
$245
million in 1992, including $210 million for photovoltaic equipment.  
Near-term
export market expansion of $800 million in sales of renewable energy and 
energy
efficiency equipment would create approximately 29,000 new jobs.<p>

The U.S. employment base would increase by 67,500 jobs annually from the 
years
1991 to 2000 as a result of the <b><i>lighting efficiency</i></b> upgrade 
under
a federal accelerated technology diffusion proposal.  Wage and salary 
income
would grow $1.15 billion annually during the same period.<p>

With an average increase in <b><i>electric motor efficiency</i></b> of 
6%, the
U.S. employment base would increase an average of 9200 jobs per year from 
1991
to 2000.  An associated annual increase in wage and salary income of $190

million would also be realized during this same period. Electric bill 
savings
of approximately $600 million would be realized by the year 2000.<p>

The Wisconsin Energy Bureau recently found that with a 75% increase in 
the
state's <b><i>renewable energy</i></b> use, the state would realize more 
than
62,000 new jobs, $1.2 billion in new wages, and $4.6 billion in new sales 
for
Wisconsin businesses.<p>

By improving automobile and light truck <b><i>fuel economy</i></b> from 
28
miles per gallon (mpg) in 1990 to 40 mpg in 2000, and then to 50 mpg in 
2010,
large numbers of jobs would be created. Under this fuel economy 
improvement
proposal, 72,000 and 244,000 jobs would be created by 2000 and 2010,
respectively.<p>

About 293,000 new jobs could be created by 1995, 471,000 new jobs by 
2000, and
nearly 1.1 million new jobs by 2010 with a major national commitment to
<b><i>energy efficiency</i></b> improvements.  Less than 10% of the new 
jobs
created are associated with direct investment in efficiency measures, 
while
more than 90% are associated with energy savings and the "respending" of 
those
savings.<p>
