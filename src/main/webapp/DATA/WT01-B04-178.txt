<P><CENTER>POSITION STATEMENT<BR>
ALCOHOL AND TOBACCO: TWO DANGEROUS GATEWAY DRUGS</CENTER>
<P><B>The use of alcohol and tobacco has taken a great toll on youth and
society and is a predictor of future alcohol abuse and addiction, as well
as the use of other drugs. Therefore, Drug Watch International supports
all efforts to prevent use of these drugs by youth and supports efforts
to restrict advertising of them to the general public.<BR>
<BR>
Background:</B><BR>
Alcohol and nicotine are legal drugs for adults in many countries. Even
though these dangerous and addictive drugs are &quot;socially acceptable&quot;
for adults, they are, to one degree or another, controlled substances for
youth throughout the world. Many cultures try to limit their young from
using alcohol or tobacco. Efforts to prevent the use of alcohol and tobacco
by youth should not be confused with efforts to prohibit adult use of either
of these drugs. However, it is time adults looked at their own alcohol and
tobacco use, if they want to influence young people.<BR>
<BR>
In North America and other countries, alcohol is the number one drug used
by teens. It's use is also the number one contributing factor in youthful
deaths. In the U.S., the use of alcohol is associated with at least one-half
of all car crashes, suicides, drownings, crimes of violence, unplanned sex,
poor school performance, and other trauma among youth.<BR>
<BR>
Alcohol and tobacco kill more people annually than all other drugs combined.
Alcohol alone is associated with at least one-fourth of all hospital visits
in the United States. Nicotine is one of the most addictive and harmful
of all drugs.<BR>
<BR>
There is a false perception that if a drug is legal it must cause less problems.
In many countries and cultures, the use of alcohol and/or tobacco is so
deeply woven into the cultural fabric of those countries that neither is
acknowledged as a drug or even as a problem.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Rationale:</B><BR>
In July 1995, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) concluded for
the first time that nicotine is a drug and that it should be regulated as
a controlled substance. Regulations were proposed restricting access to
tobacco products and restricting attempts to make these products appealing
to children and adolescents. Indeed, if alcohol and tobacco were new products
seeking FDA clearance today, each would likely be rejected as hazardous
and addictive.<BR>
<BR>
A recent study by Columbia University's Center on Addiction and Subst,ance
Abuse, states that the earlier children use the gateway drugs tobacco or
alcohol or marijuana, the more likely they are to move on to other drugs.
Youth who drank alcohol were 50 times more likely to use cocaine, and those
who smoked tobacco cigarettes were 19 times as likely to use cocaine. Nearly
90% of cocaine users had smoked tobacco or drank alcohol or used marijuana
first. The study, based on 30,000 American households, established a clear
progression that began with use of the gateway drugs of alcohol, tobacco
or marijuana and led to use of other drugs.<BR>
<BR>
Dr. John Slade reported at the 1989 National Conference on Nicotine Dependence
in San Diego, California, that tobacco smoking teaches drug acquisition
skills to the youth. He said, &quot;For the most part, they're illegal for
kids to buy. In addition, kids who smoke get firsthand experience in using
a substance to adjust emotional states.&quot; Slade reports that tobacco
use teaches drug-taking skills and that tobacco use promotes an attitude
that fosters other drug taking behaviors.<BR>
<BR>
Compounding the problem is the relative ease with which youth can access
alcohol and tobacco. Both drugs are widely available, inexpensive and heavily
marketed, making them especially attractive to youth, who are the most price-sensitive
consumer age group.<BR>
<BR>
The right of adults to consume either of these drugs is a notion heavily
promoted by the alcohol and tobacco industries. This argument is meaningless
for many young people who have reached the legal age for use with no real
choice left, because they are already addicted. They have been seduced into
use of both drugs by slick marketing targeted at youth long before they
have had their first drink or used tobacco for the first time.<BR>
<BR>
Youth are bombarded daily with alluring advertising and marketing techniques.
Because new alcohol or tobacco users are rarely adults, images which imply
sexual prowess, athletic ability, popularity, freedom and escape from problems
are especially appealing to young people. Children grow up thinking that
they cannot have a good time without alcohol or tobacco. They don't realize
that many adults choose not to drink.<BR>
<BR>
Alcohol can kill or cause serious problems any time a young person uses
it. Yet, some youth are convinced that drinking alcohol or using tobacco
does not cause immediate problems in their lives, and most are certain that
they could quit at any time. The average teen smoker had his/her first whole
cigarette by 13 and became a daily smoker by age 14.5.<BR>
<BR>
Drug Watch International recognizes and supports the various efforts of
many concerned drug preventionists who are attempting to prevent the use
of alcohol and tobacco by youth. Many Drug Watch members are local and national
leaders in this aspect of prevention. We must never retreat in our efforts
to prevent drug use by youth.<BR>
<BR>
Drug Watch International supports the many promising practices and strategies
aimed at preventing youthful alcohol and tobacco use, including: changing
social acceptance of use by youth, increasing law enforcement efforts for
those who provide or procure these drugs for youth, increasing excise taxes,
Eating more meaningful and effective consequences for those who provide
alcohol or tobacco to adolescents, increasing prevention programs, restricting
advertising and marketing, and supporting legislation and public policy
that limits the lobbying practices of the alcohol and tobacco industries.<BR>
