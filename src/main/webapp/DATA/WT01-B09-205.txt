<CENTER><H2> The European NGO Consultation on Sustainable
Mountain Development:  Recommendations of NGOs and Mountain Populations to
Governments and to the European Union</H2></CENTER><P>
<P>
<H3>Recommendations of NGOs and mountain  populations
to governments and to the European Union</H3>
<P><H3>
These recommendations were issued by the European NGO
Consultation on Sustainable Mountain Development which took place in
Toulouse, France, on 4-7 July 1996, in the framework of the implementation
of Agenda 21, Chapter 13.</H3><P>
<STRONG>Considering :</STRONG>
<UL>
<LI> the term sustainable development, defined in the report of the world
commission for environment and development (Brundtland report) as
"development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the
ability of future generations to meet their own needs" ;
<LI> the importance of mountains in the global ecosystem, as a source of
water, energy and biological diversity, and a source of such key resources
as minerals, forest and agricultural products and of recreational
opportunity ;
<LI> that about 10 per cent of the world's population depends directly on
mountain resources, and a much larger percentage draws on mountain
resources ;
<LI> the characteristics and specific problems of mountain regions, in terms
of economic difficulties and the fragility of the environment (altitude,
relief, climatic conditions...) ;
<LI> the diversity of mountains at a European scale ;
<LI> the commitment of governments to act in favour of sustainable development
of mountain regions, formalised in chapter 13 of Agenda 21 arising from the
conference of Rio in 1992, and the present intergovernmental working
process leading up to the world conference on mountain areas in 1997 .
</UL><P>
<STRONG>Taking into account :</STRONG>
<P>
<UL>
<LI> the European Consultation by the means of a questionnaire which had been
translated in 16 languages and sent to more than 5000 NGOs in 45 European
countries, and, in particular, the response rate of nearly 19 %, reflecting
the major interest of NGOs and populations in the subject of sustainable
mountain development ;
<LI> the opinions and wishes expressed, and in particular :
<LI> that the majority of the NGOs consider that nothing has changed since the
conference of Rio, concerning mountain regions ;
<LI> that the most efficient defenders of mountain interests are the
inhabitants and the NGOs, and that they are badly represented in the
decision making bodies of European countries ;
<LI> that sustainable mountain development needs first and foremost a
concerted action between all actors involved, and interregional and
international cooperation, especially in the case of transborder massifs ;
<LI> that specific laws for mountains should be created where they do not exist ;
<LI> that human activity may cause considerable damage to the environment in
mountain areas, and that the current measures for environmental protection
are insufficient ;
<LI> that the road system in mountain areas is considered for the most part
adequate or satisfactory.
</UL><P>
<STRONG>
Taking into account the results of the survey of concerned NGOs and
populations of all European countries, the delegates of the Conference on
Sustainable Mountain Development which took place in Toulouse, France, on
4-7 July 1996, representing a range of interests from across society
(associations for nature protection, socio-professional organisations,
cultural and sporting associations...) and coming from 24 European
countries,
recommend the following specific policies and actions in support of
mountain areas.</STRONG>

<P>
<H2>The delegates recommend</H2>
<P>
<STRONG>In matters of general policy</STRONG>
<P>
<UL>
<LI> to support multidisciplinary research in mountain areas, in order to
assess the state of European mountains and the impact to date and potential
impact of climate change on these zones ;
<LI> to clearly define criteria for good and bad practices in sustainable
mountain development, to identify examples of good practice and to launch
and support a series of pilot projects ;
<LI> to promote the implementation of Agenda 21, by integrating the specific
needs of mountain areas into regional, national and European policies and
by defining specific commitments and responsibilities, taking into account
inter alias the proposed European Charter of Mountain Regions, the Alpine
Convention and the Charter for the Protection of the Pyrenees ;
<LI> to introduce a trans-sectoral approach to management of mountain regions,
adjusted to the great diversity of mountains and taking into account
interactions between mountains, lowlands and seas ;
<LI> to give more power to regional authorities in matters of sustainable
development and to establish and implement,  by consulting all interest
groups of the area concerned, a regional sustainable development plan for
each mountain region which analyses the state of the environmental,
socio<LI>economic and cultural quality of the region, the driving forces
behind barriers to sustainability, the ecological and economic impacts of
pressures on the region and the present policy outcomes ;
<LI> to reinforce interregional, interministerial and international
cooperation, which is indispensable for attaining sustainable mountain
development ;
<LI> to create, harmonise and implement legislation on the protection of
environment, to monitor sources of pollution and to introduce detailed
assessment procedures, in order to avoid investment that doesn't respect
the principles of sustainability ;
<LI> to reform the structural funds of the European Union, by redirecting
funds towards the ecological development of mountain regions adopting a
transsectoral approach and to create a structure for offering financial
support for sustainable mountain development in relevant regions outside
the European Union ;
<LI> to take into consideration the special problems of mountain areas
affected by war, in particular humanitarian problems, and to work towards
peace in these regions ;
<LI> that the European Union adopts a directive with a view to promoting
sustainable mountain development.
</UL>
<P>
<STRONG>In relation to Tourism and the Conservation of the Mountain Heritage</STRONG>
<P>
<UL>
<LI> to establish specific mountain tourism laws and policies, based on the
principles of sustainable development ;
<LI> to develop a "gentle" tourism based on promoting opportunity for informal
recreation that enhances the natural and cultural heritage, respects the
environment, is based on local populations and facilities (especially in
matters of accommodation), favours other traditional activities (especially
craft working) and provides a genuine supplementary income to local
populations and communes ;
<LI> to develop codes of good practice for particular mountain activities and
to promote these as international standards, aiming to make visitors, as
well as the local people, aware of the importance of mountains as a
natural, cultural and recreational resource ;
<LI> to develop and implement area plans with a view to achieving sustainable
mountain tourism, favouring integrated action, taking into account the
assessment of carrying capacity and ensuring the freedom of access ;
<LI> to monitor the environmental impact of tourism in sensitive zones, to
identify areas where there is a real or potential conflict between the
needs of mountain protection and those of mountain tourism (construction of
roads, skilifts, buildings...). Artificial snow making should be limited
where it would cause negative impacts on the environment ;
<LI> to develop a European Charter for Mountain Tourism reflecting the search
for an equilibrium between the needs of the natural environment and those
of tourism development. The Charter could include the concept of a "Label"
for quality mountain tourism and standards for pollution control,
environmental quality etc... ;
<LI> to consider favourable tax policies (e.g. tax-free zones) for small or
local organisations working on mountain tourism respecting environment and
to publicise any such support .
</UL>
<P>
<STRONG>In relation to Agriculture and Forests in Mountain Areas</STRONG>
<P>
<UL>
<LI> to support and develop small-scale mixed agriculture (combining farming,
forestry and livestock raising) and multiple employment, based on respect
for the environment, which assumes a particular economic and social
importance in mountain areas and an importance in terms of the conservation
of landscapes and heritage ;
<LI> to sustain, enhance or create a policy of support and compensation for
the handicaps of altitude and slope, remunerating the maintenance and
management of the landscape, opportunities for informal recreation and
supporting the integration of buildings which are in keeping with the
landscape. Such support may take the form of direct aid, reductions and
exemptions from land and other taxes, reduced interest rates for loans... ;
<LI> to promote solidarity between lowland and mountain areas and to change
the fund allocation of the European Union so as to provide greater support
for extensive grassland farming in mountains, for example by flat-rate aid
to farmers ;
<LI> to evaluate the harmful effects that current policies often produce in
mountain areas (farmland concentration, farmland abandonment, dairy
quotas...), and to modify their orientation with a view to sustainable
development ;
<LI> to remunerate at a fair price and to foster the development of
high-quality products often based on traditional know<LI>how, and in
particular organic agriculture, in order to supply local markets and the
ever-increasing demand from urban consumers; national and European
legislation and regulations should provide for such products to be
distinguished in the market-place, for example by creating labels or
appellations ;
<LI> to ensure the stringent health regulations applying to these products are
well adapted to and set within reach of small production and processing
facilities ;
<LI> to promote innovative solutions for better management of farm land ownership ;
<LI> to implement the recommendations of the intergovernmental conference of
Helsinki, and in particular the management and use of forests in a way that
maintains their biological diversity, their capacity for regeneration and
their ecological, recreational and economic functions.
</UL>
<P>
<STRONG>In matters of Planning and Infrastructure</STRONG>
<P>
<UL>
<LI> to undertake land management trying to avoid urban over-concentration and
to maintain viable populations in mountain areas centred on existing
villages;
<LI> that a management and development plan should be established for each
mountain massif and its communities or districts, with full public
participation, respecting the natural and cultural heritage including
habitat, air, water and soil quality and the tranquillity of mountain areas
;
<LI> to promote the grouping together of mountain communes in order to provide
them with enough weight to have responsibility for development and
management planning ;
<LI> that the European Union and national, regional and local authorities
guarantee the assessment of the environmental impact of all projects, right
from the initial phase of their conception, involving the participation of
local authorities, NGOs, local inhabitants and independent experts, and the
study of alternative projects and solutions and any necessary accompanying
measures. Such assessments should be undertaken with a strategic
perspective to take account of incremental development ; old projects
should be re-evaluated ;
<LI> for major projects, to undertake a rigorous public examination of the
need for the development and of alternative means of meeting any proven
need ;
<LI> that an effort should be taken in order to restrict growth in the
consumption of energy, products and raw material, and to develop recycling
of materials, in order to reduce damaging impacts on mountain areas ;
<LI> that the real cost of each mode of transport should be assessed,
including the social and ecological costs, and to switch transport,
particularly through traffic (international transit), to rail transport and
piggyback routes, by :
<UL>
<LI>using taxation and traffic restrictions, in order to reduce the modes of
transport that cause the most pollution and environmental nuisances ;
<LI>limiting drastically the building of new roads and motorways, in
particular new cross mountain axes; an exception may be made in specific
cases, for example to permit commercial relations in Eastern European
countries ;
</UL>
<LI> to modify the system of direct and indirect subsidies of governments and
the European Union affecting the process of production (from the
exploitation of resources to the manufacture of final products), in order
to avoid superfluous traffic ;
<LI> to reduce the nuisance caused by air traffic over and through the
mountains to a level that is bearable to inhabitants and the environment,
by restricting or banning tourist transport (propeller aircraft,
ultralights...) ;
<LI> that technical systems such as telecommunications and teleworking should
be developed in order to reduce the current huge increase in the mobility
of people and goods ;
<LI> to strengthen and to implement more effectively the system for
controlling European funds, in order to ensure projects respect the
environment and to block those that do not ;
<LI> that mountain populations and authorities should receive compensation for
infrastructure and services used by visitors and lowland inhabitants, with
a view to the principles of sustainable development defined above ;
<LI> to take into account the need of mountain inhabitants for affordable housing.
</UL>
<P>
<STRONG>The delegates request the Governments and the European Union officially to
acknowledge the rights of mountain populations and the role of local,
regional, national and international NGOs.</STRONG>
<P>
<STRONG>They request :</STRONG>
<P>
<UL>
<LI> to promote education and raise awareness of sustainable development among
all sectors of the population, to make sure that the right of free access
to information is respected, and to establish such laws in countries where
they do not exist ;
<LI> to ensure the participation of NGOs and concerned populations throughout
decision making (planning agreement, establishment, follow-up and control)
of all projects linked to sustainable mountain development, in particular
through the dissemination of information and formal public hearings ;
<LI> to promote mediation as a means of overcoming conflicts, in view of its
flexibility, speed and efficacy ;
<LI> to ensure that any member of the public is able to take legal action to
oppose major projects with serious environmental consequences ;
<LI> to make available funds for the activities of NGOs involved in
facilitating sustainable mountain development, and to recognise the
important role of local organisations ;
<LI> to promote the introduction of formal partnership structures ;
</UL>
<P>
<STRONG>The delegates express clearly the need for setting up a Network of
Participants in Sustainable Mountain Development in Europe, in order to
exchange information and experiences, and request support, especially
financial support, to promote that exchange network between mountain NGOs
and other actors concerned.</STRONG>
<P>
<STRONG>
The delegates ask that a follow up commission be set up to monitor the
results and impacts of the intergovernmental conference of Trento, in order
to evaluate measures adopted.<P>
NGOs should be properly represented in this commission.</STRONG><P>
