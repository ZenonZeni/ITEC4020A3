<H1>Buildings</H1>
<H4>The Energy Foundation will support innovative programs to encourage greater energy efficiency in buildings. The foundation is particularly interested in efforts to improve building codes and ensure compliance, in the development of financing mechanisms and incentives, and in efforts to ensure that architects make energy integral to building design. </H4>

Large savings in energy can be realized through improvements in the insulation, heating, cooling, and lighting of residential and commercial buildings. More than one-third of U.S. energy is used to heat, cool, and light our living and working spaces. If these buildings were built and operated with off-the-shelf, cost-effective, high-efficiency technologies, energy consumption could be cut by 50 to 80 percent. Studies at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory suggest that it costs little more to build an efficient office building than an inefficient one. 
<P>
These potential benefits are rarely realized.  Most people and corporations fail to consider the benefits of energy-efficiency improvements over the life of the technology and thus are discouraged by their higher initial costs. The best window now on the market, for example, insulates four times as well as its double-paned predecessor. Because it costs 30 percent more, its benefits are routinely ignored. Landlords and developers make structural energy decisions, but they are not directly affected by the higher energy bills paid by renters and buyers. Architects and builders have difficulty keeping up-to-date with new efficiency technologies.
