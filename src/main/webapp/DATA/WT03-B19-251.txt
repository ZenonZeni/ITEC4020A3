The social wage
</H1>

People in need are entitled to draw from a comprehensive package of health 
and social security benefits provided by Commonwealth and State governments.  
This taxpayer-funded social wage provides a high standard of income support 
and health care in line with the social justice values that prevail in 
Australia.

<P>
Medicare, the national health scheme, provides access 
to medical and basic hospital services for all citizens. Taxpayers contribute 
to the scheme by means of a 1.5% levy on taxable income. Patients attending 
the doctor of their choice for a medical consultation receive an insurance 
rebate equivalent to 85% of the Schedule fee for the service. To assist 
patients who need frequent medical attention, Medicare benefits increase 
to 100% of the Schedule fee when total potential payments exceed 
$258.10 in a year. Medicare also provides free hospital services in the 
public hospital system for public patients, and covers 75% of the Schedule 
fee for hospital treatment as a private patient. There is no maximum patient 
contribution for hospital treatment.
<P>
Reciprocal agreements between Australia and some other countries including the 
United Kingdom, New Zealand, Italy, Sweden, Malta, the Netherlands and 
Finland provide for visitors from these countries to receive immediately 
necessary treatment under the Medicare scheme while they are in Australia, 
and for Australian residents visiting these countries to receive health care 
under the particular country's public health scheme. In addition to Medicare, 
private health insurance schemes offer a range of cover to suit individual 
needs.

The Australian social security system is 
designed to assist people in economic hardship by providing targeted income 
support to people at risk because they are unemployed or are not expected to 
work because of age, invalidity, parental status or other factors. Lower and 
middle income families with children also receive additional support. 
Assistance is targeted towards those most in need.
<P>
Most social security assistance is provided in the form of cash benefits 
payable to recipients who satisfy the relevant eligibility criteria. The 
amount received will depend on the particular circumstances of the recipient. 
Most rates of payment are indexed to movements in the Consumer Price Index 
(CPI) to maintain their real value.
<P>
<B><I>Pensions and allowances</I></B>
<P>
Aged pensions are payable to women aged 61 and over (the age at which women 
can qualify will increase incrementally until it is the same as the male 
criteria) and to men aged 65 years and over, subject to residency 
requirements. Income and assets tests are applied to determine the rate of 
pension payable.
<P>
Disability support pensions are payable to persons below aged pension age who 
cannot work full-time or support themselves because of a serious, long-term 
health problem or disability. There are special residency requirements. 
Disability support pensions, apart from the permanently blind who receive a 
non-means-tested pension, are subject to the same income and assets test as 
those applying to aged pensioners. Disability support entitlements are the 
same as for aged pensions.  
<P>
<B><I>Sickness and unemployment assistance</I></B>
<P>
Sickness benefits are payable to persons who are unable to work because of 
temporary incapacity, and who have limited alternative means of support. The 
unemployed are assisted by an income support structure with two components: 
the Job Search Allowance available during the first 12 months of unemployment, 
and the Newstart Allowance for those unemployed for over 12 months.
