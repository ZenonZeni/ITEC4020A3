The National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners (NARUC) is a quasi-governmental
non-profit corporation with members who are engaged in the regulation of public utilities in the
United States. Their chief objective is to serve the consumer interest by seeking to improve the
quality and effectiveness of regulation of public utilities. Under a cooperative agreement with
DOE, NARUC established the Nuclear Waste Program Office (NWPO). The NWPO is dedicated
solely to the civilian high-level nuclear waste and spent nuclear fuel program. The Office
represents NARUC's interest with DOE, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and others. NWPO
will advise state commissioners regarding the development of policies related to high-level nuclear
waste. The NWPO will monitor and review national high-level waste and spent nuclear fuel
legislation and regulations to assess the impact of such laws and regulations on the NARUC
organization, its constituents, and members.
