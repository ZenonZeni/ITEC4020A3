<H2><CENTER>The Need for Psychological and Legal Counseling</CENTER>
</H2><P>Unlike any other alternative method of creating a family, the surrogate
process allows a child to be biologically related to one, or in the case
of embryo transplant, both parents. It also gives the couple the opportunity
to become involved and experience the pregnancy itself. Also, it allows the
couple some control over the ultimate genetic makeup of their child. Having
a child with the help of a surrogate mother can be an exciting and fulfilling
way to experience the joy of parenthood.
<P>Women have varied motivations in their decisions to be surrogate mothers
and egg donors. (Many times this motivation is more instinctive as in "I
am helping someone who desperately wants a baby", or hard to articulate.)
The potential psychological and emotional harm to the surrogate mother or
egg donor and her family is a risk that no couple should ask her to take
until she is fully informed.
<P>Every surrogate mother and egg donor needs a private session with an expert
counselor in the field to enable her to discuss all parameters of surrogacy
and egg donation. She must understand that there will be a child "out there"
that she has carried or help create and yet she will not be considered the
mother. If she participated in the Artificial Insemination (AI) program,
the child so conceived will have a genetic connection to her. Only with fully
informed consent can a surrogate mother or egg donor make a healthy decision
that she can participate and fulfill the obligations of being a surrogate
mother. The desire to assist a childless couple must be approached with full
information and careful consideration.
<P>It is important that the surrogate mother or egg donor meets and talks
to other surrogate mothers or egg donors. During group support meetings,
(held under the guidance of the counselor), surrogate mothers and egg donors
meet other surrogate mothers and egg donors who are in all stages of the
program. Some in the group may be on medication and others may already have
given birth. Through exposure to all stages, the surrogate mother and egg
donor can finally decide if participation is safe for her.
<P><A HREF=Hillbio.html>Hilary Hanafin, Ph.D.</A>, <a href="WhosWho.html#Carol">Carol Wolfe, MFCC</a>, <a href="WhosWho.html#Donna">Donna Robertson, LCSW</a> and <a href="Gordbio.html">Elaine Gordon, PhD</a>, and The Law Offices of Vorzimer, Garber, Masserman &amp; Ecoff, offer a four hour legal and psychological orientation for couples who have their own potential surrogate mother or egg donor. This includes a private session with the counselor to discuss the psychological aspects of surrogacy and egg donation, thereafter they meet with the attorney, whose practice emphasizes this field of law, to discuss the legal ramifications and finalize parental rights. Surrogate mothers and egg donors need to seek independent legal counsel.
<P>Some important issues for discussion during psychological and legal consult
for surrogate mothers: compensation, birth defects, abortion, lost wages
due to complications of pregnancy, guardianship of child in event couple
dies before the birth, death of surrogate while pregnant, financial
accountability for medical bills, insurance coverage and potential denial
of insurance coverage, multiple fetus development and selective termination,
contact during pregnancy and after birth, and effects on all the children
involved. It is important that these issues are discussed in depth and each
party understands the other's feelings, liabilities, duties and responsibilities.
