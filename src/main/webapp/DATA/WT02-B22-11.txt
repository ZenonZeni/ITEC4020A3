<H5>
<UL>

<!-- FIELD:CMT_PHIL -->
<LI>One should live life doing the greatest good for the greatest number of dynamics (dynamics go from one to 8, where one is the self and 8 is an originator or "god"
<LI>Respect yourself and pass it on
<LI>God is perhaps the silliest concept man has ever come up with.
<LI>Each person should endevour to rediscover his spirituality which he/she will do by study, accurate observation, helping others, helping society, leading a highly ethical life and positively enhance him/herself in all areas. 
<LI>The Way, the Truth, and the Life, is the only way to true life--Christ Jesus. One hand He reached out to God, as only God can. The other hand he reached out to man, as only a man can. And He brought the two together. 
<LI>I know that christ lives.  I know that the gospel is true.  I will follow the teachings of the Lord Jesus Christ
<LI>Personal religion of Hinduism (Sanatana Dharma)
<LI>Any individual can improve and be more happy in life if he himself wants to
<LI>Be able to experience anything, and only cause those effects that others can easily experience.
<LI>I truly believe and *know*  that when you have found the truth in life, and about life, you have achieved a high degree of spiritual level, which can mean immortality.  When you are in the right religion, you can make things go right. My religion is very, very practical. It is not esoteric as an "outsider"  may believe.
<LI>Scientology makes one more able.  It is observable.
<LI>We are spiritual beings who never die.  We play and have played many games.  The main purpose of religion is to help us play a better game.
<LI>The purpose of religion is the attainment of knowledge and understanding about life
<LI>A person is completely responsible for his condition and is future existence.  This includes his future lives.  Living in this way is the only guarantee of a happy future - a goal all have in common.
<LI>Religion is and should be a means of achieving both spiritual and material fulfillment.
<LI>It is a constant striving for a higher standard of ethics.
<LI>Mine is an applied religion which requires no "Faith" or "Belief", just the application and then self observation if the results from that application.
<LI>People are more powerful than they believe they are.  They also tend to forget the importance of the welfare of the other beings on this planet to their own survival and happiness.
<LI> Man is a spiritual being who can be helped to be more aware and behave better and is basically good.
<LI>Through careful study and application, I have found that L. Ron Hubbard, the Founder of Scientology, has researched and developed a carefully-mapped route to acheive spiritual enlightenment.
<LI>I find it very difficult to believe in god. More and more, I find god, and the concept of god, man made. 
<LI>Scientology not only gives me great comfort as a spiritual being, it also gives me the tools to live this life better. I have used it to improve myself, my familial relationships, my marriage, my children, and even my work place. It is an invaluable element of my day-to-day life, as I believe religion should be to every man and woman.
<LI>A person is a spiritual being, timeless and deathless.  A spiritual being is far more able than most of us have been led to believe.  Through the application of Scientology there is something an individual can do to increase his own awareness of and willingness to demonstrate these abilities.
<LI>Religion is shit!!
<LI>There is no evidence, concrete or otherwise, supporting the existence of God, an afterlife, heaven, hell, or reincarnation.  Therefore, everyone is welcome to believe whatever they like or are convinced of.  However, religion is self-deluding and destructive of self and society.
<LI>What I do is what works.  I chose a religion that is useful in life, not just after death.
<LI>Man is corrupt deserving separation from Yahwah, but he loves us so much he sent a sacrefice to atone for our corruption. You need only to accept the massiah as your Lord (his athority to rule your life) submit and seek him and you shall find him. Yashua is the only way to regain comunion with the allmighty creator. May I not misslead a sole, Amen.
<LI>Man is a spiritual being with potentialities vastly greater than we are led to believe
<LI>Abandoning religious values has contributed to a decline in the stability of our society.
<LI>I don't think question 7 is well phrased.  My religious guidelines could be the doctrine of my church, it could be what I ahve found to be true through my own study and questioning.  The question doesn't allow for the possibility that part of the religious doctrine is forgiveness from those wanderings.
<LI>I think religion is something people need to have, otherwise we'd all be a mess without something to believe in.
<LI>Although some religions are better than others, I believe that most tend to promote judgemental or hostile attitudes towards people who hold different beliefs, and that they generally do more harm than good.
<LI>We allways talk about tah
<LI>THERE IS ONLY ONE GOD, ALLAH, AND MUHAMMOD IS THE MESSENGER OF ALLAH
<LI>Jesus Christ - Crucified, died, buried, resurrected, eternal life!
<LI>I am a MUSLIM and ISLAM is my religion. There is no God but ALLAH, and MOHAMMAD was His last Prophet. Before Mohammad, there were JESUS, MOSES, ABRAHAM ....... ADAM (the First Prophet). WHY AM I SO SURE THAT ISLAM IS THE RIGHT PATH? Because the Ultimate PROOF is here for all to see! It is in the Holy QUR'AN. Read it with an open mind...Compare it with any other scripture. YOU TOO WILL SEE THE TRUTH!
<LI>Baha'i - focused on esoteric aspects
<LI>Mormonism is not a sect of Chrisitianity, no matter how much they want us to believe. They are a cult, along the lines of Jehovah's Witnesses and Christian Science.
<LI>Belief in GOD and following the principals that he teaches is necessary for a peaceful life on earth.  If everyone on earth followed his teachings there would be peace and not war!
<LI>All organized religions are derived from the one and same spiritual principle, which resides in the very essence of all beings.
<LI>Religion is inextricably tied to philosophy and science.  The answers to what is life, who we are, where we are etc. are the truths every being is ultimately looking for.  A true religion must contain this information and not simply "beliefs".
<LI>I am disappointed that in Qustion #13, you do not list the Quran (which gives guidance to >1 billion people!
<LI>Islam-Shi'sm is the only true faith because it emanates from Imfallible vicegerents of Allah SWT and they preached The TRUTH.
<LI>Live and Let Live
<LI>Everyone on the planet is agnostic but may not be out of the closet.
<LI>That man IS his own immortal soul, (as opposed to having a soul) and that he is capable of far greater acheivements and much higher understanding of himself and his fellows than he has ever dreamed of.
<LI>go with the flow
<LI>I BELIEVE THE TOTAL BIBLE AND WHAT IT TEACHES  AS MAN HAS NOT COME UP WITH A VIABLE ALTERNATIVE THAT MAKES ANY SENSE NOR HAVE THEY BEAT THE SYSTEM.
<LI>Man is basically good and can be totally free if he learns how the mind works and life works.  He is trapped by his reactive mind content and by getting rid of that content, he can regain his freedom to be himself and know life.
<LI>The truth of the past will set you free.
<LI>We are all basically good, immortal spiritual beings, who, because of making incorrect decisions lifetime after lifetime, have deteriorated down to an almost degraded state, having lost our full potentials. Now relying stictly on the physical body, we have lost sight of the fact that with our full potential restored, through appying the truth of natual spiritual laws, we are capable of regaining all the abilities we once had and more, and thus attaining  total spiritual freedom.   Also ridding the worl
 of Psychiatry and its harm to mankind.
<LI>We are all basically good and immortal spiritual beings, but are greatly deteriorated from our original selves and from our full potential and have thus become dependent on the physical body. We are thus stuck in an endless cycle of life after life. But through the application of the truth of natural spiritual laws are capable of re-attaining our original selves and our full potential and thus freedom from the endless cycle of lives. In this way we can attain total spiritual freedom.
<LI>one must tolerate all religions-and coincide to try and maintain a healthy living enviroment
<LI>if you know man, you can solve most of this civilization's problems
<LI>There is only One God, and Prophet Mohammed was the final messenger of God.  I believe in the Oneness of God and all of the Prophets of God, and make no distictions between any of the Prophets (from Adam, Ibrahim, Moses, Noah, John, Jesus, Muhammed) peace be upon them all.
<LI>We each have a responsibility to learn to live our lives, moment by moment, in  the way God would have us live them.
<LI>Religion is a historical construct by a hierarchical male dominant society to control the masses, and women in particular, by denying them their inherent, ancient, direct access to Spirit.
<LI>I am a firm believer in Jesus, however I think that there are other ways to find the Lord.  As long as you are searching for a being of True Love and Trust and Peace and other such virtues, you have found the Lord.
<LI>THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS RELIGION, THERE IS NO PROOF OF ANY KIND! www.geocities.com/Athens/Acropolis/2319 will explain further.
<LI>Worship God, IF that is your choice, but to kill another for thier religious beliefs is ludicrous.
<LI>INNAS-SALATI  WA NUSUKI  WA  MAHYAYA  WA MAMATI  LILLAHIR-RABBIL 'ALAMINN 
<LI>Jesus Christ lives and established his gospel.  The same gospel that my religion teaches and believes in.
<LI>Everyone should have some moral code as a basis for the way they live their lives.  They should never impose it on others.
<LI>Love (to God and the men), tolerance and respect (towards those who not share the same principals I have), peace. 
<LI>Men are basically good, they are spiritual beings and need tools for life to survive better and be happy.
<LI>Tolerence, concern for and respect for others
<LI>That Man is a spiritual being and can do something about changing the condition he finds himself in
<LI>I am an atheist and have no doubts about religion; ie, I am not an agnostic.  I do believe it serves some people well to believe.
<LI>If we all went to church a little more this world would be a much better place!
<LI>Man is a spirit.  He does not "have" a soul - he IS a soul.  And as a spirit, man is eternal.  He has lived many lives and will live many more.
<LI>Unity of all things on a foundation of "love" as the guiding priciples
<LI>Scientology is an APPLIED religious philosophy. When learned and USED, it creates a better life for one and one's fellows.
<LI>I believe that man is a spiritual being capable of attaining a better existence for himself and for others.
<LI>religion is some language, which allows to describe SOME aspects of human being better than other languages (for instance science). It also the best way for SOME people to survive in open (in terms of K.Popper) society.
<LI>I refer to the writings of L. Ron Hubbard.
<LI>We all are spiritual beings who are basically good, that we are much more able than we believe, and can rehabilitate ourselves to become eternally free.
<LI>Scientology isn't easy, but it is very workable and useful. Looking at your interesting survey I would say that religions are generally potentially helpful but that prerequisites are good intentions, tolerance and at least a fair understanding of life.
<LI>That man is a spirit, timeless and deathless.  By his own destructive acts, he limits his future power and abilities.
<LI>To really understand God, one must come to know oneself and one's fellows first.
<LI>Man is a spiritual being and is basically good, but can act badly. What is true for you, is true for you.
<LI>Religion is personal, and as long as it forwards the betterment of mankind and the individual, its fine with me.
<LI>Scientology is a non-denominational applied religious philosophy and is open to all creeds. It helps one to become cause over one's life and destiny.
<LI>DO THE BEST FOR AS MANY PEOPLE ,ANIMALS, ETC. 
<LI>To achieve greater self-confidence and personal integrity thus enabling my to really trust and respect myself and my fellow man.
<LI>Man is not an animal or a mind or a body. Man HAS a mind and HAS a body.
<LI>Religion is what you make it.
<LI>there is no heaven or hell after death. we experience it here right now.
<LI>ALLAHU AKBAR !! (GOD IS GREAT)
<LI>I believer the KJV1611 bible to be the infallible word of God for us today.
<LI>Treat everyone the best way you possibly can.
<LI>TO LOVE THE LORD THY GOD WITH ALL THY HEART, MIND, BODY, AND SOUL AND THY NEIGBER AS THY SELF  AND SALFATION THROUGH CHRIST OWER LORD
<LI>I know in whom I have believed and am persuaded that HE is able to keep that which I have committed unto HIM against that day.
<LI>Life is happiest when I feel that I am OK with God and he sees me and approves of the way I am conducting my life.
<LI>what is lost should be found, what is given should be accepted, that is the key!
<LI>I believe in love, friendship kindness, happyness, and individalism. Not greed, hate, suffering, & being lead around like a bunch of sheep by con men & coned men, following vague rules that dont come even close to meening what they ment when they were first written for another cause & reson. SNOOK
<LI>I believe that Religion should not be used to control a person's way of life.  It should be used as an enhancement or an avenue towards deepening a person's inner soul.
<LI>Spiritual principles based on 12 Steps.
<LI>I was raised as a Catholic, which seems more about control than anything else. I believe honor is its own reward. I believe human warmth is the only real thing there is.     
<LI>There is more to this earth than can be described in words.  Neither nor anyone else knows the answers.  It is our duty to be respectiful of life and of others.  The one rule I try to live by is "Do unto others as you would have done unto you"
<LI>Be harmonious with and respect your surroundings
<LI>I don't believe in the Roman Catholic God as male.. my beliefs are a mixture of Catholic and Witchcraft/New Age. I hold only some things of Catholisism with me and most of the Wicca/New Age beliefs.
<LI>I believe in the oneness of God, His Prophets, his Holy Books and that Mohammad is his last Messanger 
<LI>Objectivism, The Philosophy of Ayn Rand
<LI>I believe in Karma.  Karma dictates a person's "Heaven" and "Hell."
<LI>If there is no God, then nothing here matters. No achievement you will ever make will matter if it's all over when you die. "Then you should feel JOY because you are SAVED!!! "  - Gayle D. Erwin
<LI>In the process of believing in one God, one achieves greatness and finess one would expect in life.
<LI>As a scientist, it is very hard to balance facts with theology. I believe we all possess 'religion' genes - it gave believers a survival advantage - and now we have little choice to believe or not!s
<LI>i do not consider Christianity just some ordinary 'religon'.  'religon is just some set of rules, but  JESUS is The Savior and He is all that matters!
<LI>Jesus is Lord.  He will judge.  He has all authority.  Salvation thru faith in Jesus, not works.
<LI>Humanism with a mishmash of many religious and secular beliefs stirred in.
<LI>Religion totally ruined a previous relationship of mine.  I had a girlfriend that was a christian and myself being an athiest, it was kind of like an oil/water type of thing. I think that religion is a very destructive force in the world.  Look at the number of people who lose their lives because of this!!
<LI>There are two paths that we are constantly at the fork, we choose the correct path by our own free will.
<LI>pantheist
<LI>None
<LI>Each of us possesses a different mental disposition, and therefor cannot be satisfied spiritually/emotionally by one dominant religion. Religion can be an extremely positive force in society, but only if founded upon the principles of diversity, acceptance of others and love; otherwise religion can quickly become a tool for those who wish to oppress the masses.
<LI>Open your heart and give it a try.
<LI>DESTROY THOSE FUCKING CHRISTIAN BASTARDS !!!!!!!
<LI> GOD.  GOD IS EVERYTHING.  EVERTHING.
<LI>There is, and never was, a god...
<LI>Religion is a crutch which people lean on to avoid thinking logically. Historically religion has been more harmful than helpful in promoting hate, violence and intolerance. People use religion to provide easy answers to complex questions rather than accep
<LI>Behave in any way you want as long as it harms no-one else and you are prepared to face the consequences of your actions.
<LI>All talk--No action
<LI>Cross between a Muslim and Jew.  I have a hard time believing in the concept of Jesus as the Son of God.    
<LI>I feel religion should be taught, but not crammed down the throats of those that DON'T want to listen.
<LI>Religious beliefs (not excessive) and respect for others' individual beliefs help this worl to be a better place.  My religion contributes to my inner peace and my outlook on life - be thankful for all that you have, treat others as you would like to be treated, be as good and as kind as you can be. 
<LI>I don't believe that one single person could have created all the world and its creatures.  I believe that people use a supreme being to explain what they cannot.
<LI>I have seen God...and SHE is CHAOS
<LI>Religion is like chocolate. A little bit is okay, too much makes you sick.
<LI>La Illaha ill Allah, Muhammad Rasul Allah ( There is no god but Allah, Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah)
<LI>I believe that everyone is born with the simple knowlege of what's right and what's wrong.  If you live your life by simply following a few basic guidelines such as The Ten Commandments, you're going to be OKAY, in this life and any other life that is hereafter.
<LI>KILL 'EM ALL AND LET GOD SORT 'EM OUT!!!!!!!!
<LI>Be tolerant of others, do nothing that would hurt others, and take time to frequently reflect on your life and your spirituality.
<LI>I am Mormon (the true church)
<LI>There is probably a "psychics" that apply to non-material things: wishes, deeds, etc., and they probably have momentum and eventually causal relationships, but there is no self aware being directly controlling us. And we're probably recycled; at least, I'd hope so.
<LI>Whatever you do if you find that it brings good, continue it. If you find that it brings about harm to someone or something, stop and find another strategy. You will eventually discover the tactics the Creator wants you to use to manuever in life successf
<LI>With my religion (Witchcraft/Paganism, I spend more of my time explaining what I am NOT, rather than what I am
<LI>Strive to love God.
<LI>Religion, due to its universality, seems to me to provide a strong sense of security for many people.  But I also believe that there is a supreme being that created the universe structure in which we live.
<LI>Who can really say that they know anything for sure?
<LI>Prech it brother!!!!!
<LI>I belive that all should worship the almighty bob or die by a thourough spam beating
<LI>Kill em all, and let god sort them out
<LI>I read & try to go by the Urantia Book - truth
<LI>I do not like organized religion, yet it does serve as support for many people.
<LI>peace of mind, in harmony with myself and the external world, the cause, purpose and destination of my life.  o
<LI>I think the heart of the Torah is YHWH telling Moses, "I AM."  Everything else is interpretation.
<LI>Jesus was the homosexual, poetic, oratorally-gifted son of a jewish carpenter.  He was NOT the son of god.  to say so is ludicrous and represents a lack of education , intelligence, and imagination.
<LI>I believe that the Bible is a "Life Guide" and it has answers to every question. It fosters good solid family life and prayer. If you pray your way through the day, you can't go wrong.
<LI>I think religion is very personal and people should be allowed to believe whtever gets them through the night.
<LI>Salvation through Jesus Christ, belief in the Holy Trinity, Old & New Testament, Apostolic faith in Apostles and Nicene Creed, Christianity is only true faith, all others are lies
<LI>Love is what is important.
<LI>Thank you!!
<LI>There are answers beyond our understanding, but there are always answers.  Life ends, but systems are forever.  All actions have consequence, but few are of any importance.  Morality is more than a rule.  Social contracts are destroyed when they are written.
<LI>there is no force in/into religion
<LI>I believe in God who created the universe and Muhammed pb  is his messenger.
<LI>ALLAHU AKBAR
<LI>There are no gods. only assertions that they exist
<LI>Love all, tolerate all...Religion is not the same for everyone.
<LI>To love - to live in peace
<LI>I haven't learned enough about all religions to commit to any one.
<LI>I'm a solitary eclectic pagan and recovering Catholic :)
<LI>Religion is a way of life which guides a person to a goal.  That goal is what helps a person strive and struggle to understand life.
<LI>Could give a shit less what YOU believe; quit forcing onto ME.
<LI>Do unto others as you would have them do unto you, just about says it all!
<LI>There is no god but Allah and Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is His last and final messanger.
<LI>religion and enlightened humanism is the key to personal and communal happiness
<LI>Eight words the Wiccan Rede fulfil, and it harm none, do as ye will.
<LI>I really believe in sprititually not religion. because religion tells you what you must believe, an sprituallty is your own believe in a god or a higher power.
<LI>I believe there is more to life than what we each experience, but no individual can claim to know the answers. Anyone who does is either being controlled or seeks to control others.
<LI>Islam is the only answer to todays problems - if Islam was more and more prevalent previously as it is now becoming, we could have avoided a heck of a lot - a prime example being the Rodney King incident....
<LI>John 3:16 "For God so loved the world that he gave his only son, that whoever believes in him may not perish but have eternal life."
<LI>We should kill all o f the muslims becasue they bring so much pain to the rest of the world.  We should also kill all of the budhists because they are pagan savages.  My infinately living and tolerant God told me these things, I think.
<LI>I believe that religion should not only be a weekend thing, but that it should be a way of life.  Use it for you not someone else.
<LI>do not commit what Allah had forbidden.
<LI>Religious philosophy:There are many gods and many "bob" but none are the answer. So its best w/ your ownDIY religion so that way everyone is wrong and you are write NO MATTER WHAT and so you can scam all the humans and make tons of $$$ just as "Bob" intended for you. Or you can make it up as you go along. Its even more complicated than that so just go to http://suncite.unc/subsite and bask in the confusion of "Bob"
<LI>Why are people so gullible when it comes to this nonsense
<LI>I am so unsue, that it is frighting
<LI>Truth is a pathless land...one cannot come to it through any creed, dogma, rituals or holy persons.  One has to find it through understanding your own mind.
<LI>All life is connected, and this connective force animates all life--plants, animals, people, deities--all of it.    We're all part of the web, and to damage another is to damage ourselves.
<LI>Religion is responsible for more deaths than any other cause.
<LI>You are your *own* controller. religion is for the weak!!!
<LI>There is one God"ALLAH" and Pophet Muhammad(pbuh) is his last messanger.
<LI>All churches should be taxed as businesses unless they qualify under standard procedures as social charities.
<LI>I believe in the duality of existance, that everything has its complement.  I beleive that everyone has a right to believe what they choose and that there is no ONE way to reach [salvation, nirvana, enlightenment, god].  We should all respect each other's beliefs and not impinge the freedom of religious choice guaranteed in the Constitution.
<LI>The New Testament is my creed
<LI>To believe in a religion is a person's right, but to impose a religion is immoral.
<LI>Peace with self and with the whole world in this life and hearafter
<LI>We are Justified by Grace of a loving God who sent his Son so that we might in faith have a new relationship with our Creator.
<LI>I was born and baptised into the Roman Catholic faith. Throughout school I was herded along with my classmates through ceremonies like first communion, confirmation. I was not permitted to express thoughts, concerns, doubts, etc.. Finally I met a priest who encouraged me to think for myself (not let parental influence be my only guiding factor). I was encouraged to explore and make choices that would spiritually satisfy ME, not anyone else. To this day I remain agnostic (unsure) of the exixtence of a s
perior being. I enjoy the freedom to explore a religion, and usually come away with aspects that I can agree with and believe. You could say that my beliefs are a pot pourri of many religions.
<LI>A person's connection to God is personal.  God exists within every human being.  Knowledge is born.  
<LI>God is absolutely great, and he cares about everything and everyone. If you truly repent the he will forgive you.
<LI>Too hypocritical
<LI>Religion is a natural extension of man's fear of death and the unknown.  It can help greatly through positive teachings but can also destroy by being the guise for hatred of "different" people.  ex. Spanish Inquisition.
<LI>I thank Allah for showing us the siratel mustakiym.  Our purpose in life is to worship Allah
<LI>I've got nothing against other people having differing beliefs to myself, but personally find no need to resort to religion in order to control my life or impose "good behaviour" on myself. I don't need a book to tell me what's right and wrong.
<LI>i know right from wrong, good from bad without ever having had a religious upbringing.  i know i am a good person, and i know i am good because i want to be, not because there are rules to obey, and threats of damnation or returning in my next life as a bug...i understand most people need encouragement to be "good", and that's allright with me.  i don't need it.  just DONT tell me your god is better than his god, or not to use birth control or not to have an abortion...and don't hand me flyers for bibl
 study or knock on my door to tell me about your religion.  i see the negatives of religion as exclusionary, elitest and patriarchal.
<LI>No one religion can be right and another wrong... my religion consists of many elements of many different religions.
<LI>Religion is merely eartly traditions, what is really required is a relationship with God. This transcends all cultures and traditions.
<LI>My beliefs are personal and private.  I am somewhat of an agnostic, but I pray anyway because it makes me feel better.  I am accepting of everyone else's faiths, but I am very annoyed at people who try to convert me to their 'one true way'
<LI>I say if you meet god, tell him to prove it.
<LI>Islam is a continuation to the teachings of all the prophets of God(peace be upon them) 
<LI>It defines our concept of self, purpose and function.  It is a basis for support in our lives.  Without it we lack the necessary sense of purpose and quality in our lives.  Although it exists in many forms, probably the important question is 'How in my life have I used my abilities and efforts to be truly helpful to others in theri life and in their quest to be the kind of person they want to be?'.
<LI>i think as one grows and experiences life, a person wants that freedom to do what s/he believes to be right and will not truely believe a religion until s/he truely loves it themselves. One cannot be forced into believeing a certain belief- s/he has to choose it himself!
<LI>Religion is a manner in which to control the weak.  Those who are incapable of adhereing to a positive moral philosophy need it.
<LI>Love all, understand nothing tangible, but weed.
<LI>Do unto others...  be honest, be kind, try to leave the planet a better place than when you arrived, try to do the right thing.  I don't believe morality is God-given, each society re-invents it but that doesn't make it unimportant or mean that without it, we wouldn't live in less happy communities.
<LI>I think that there is too much to know to be concerned with answers to ultimate questions. I am satisfied with the wonders of the natural world.
<LI>"Fuck 'em if they can't take a joke"  --Jr. "BOB" DOBBS
<LI>Respect towards everybody regardless of religion.
<LI>live and let live
<LI>Slack - 'frop - Noise - Dad (11 11)
<LI>Frog Croaked For Your Sins! Take A Leap Of Faith!  (Humor is a great spiritual force!)
<LI>Gott ist tott
<LI>There is no Jesus only "Bob"
<LI>Jesus Christ is my personal Savior, since I have given my life to Him and He has forgiven all my sins, I will spend eternity with Him in heaven.  Anyone who does not believe in Christ will go to hell for the punishment of their sins.  God does not send people to hell, He loves them, People choose not to accept Christ and send themselves to hell.
<LI>I'm very much unsure at this time, but I think I'm being brainwashed.  Traditional Christian religion is bad...they said to love everybody, yet burned witches at stake...as if!
<LI>I feel religion is very important, but it is a personal decision. If you decide that you don't believe in God, then thats fine, because thats your decision. I believe that God will base it on what you did during life, and not what others did.
<LI>Religion is an often usefull source of hope and belief for those that lack it. It provides a sense of guidance and belonging. It is, especially in the case of Christianity, an outdated and restrictive control that is based on the opinions and beliefs of another millenium. Christianity is responsible for the perversion and destruction of many beoples live by imposing upon them a false feeling of guilt for "offenses before God". There is no offese before God, only before yourself.
<LI>When I die, time will stop.
<LI>My body is an extention of my mind, and my mind is an extention of the universe.
<LI>Jesus said in John 14:6, I am The Way, The Truth and The Life: no one comes unto The Father, but by Me.  The basic tenets of Christianity are founded on John 3:16, For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believes in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.  That life is abundant, eternal Life that starts now, lasts throughout eternity, and is available to any who will ask.
<LI>Religion is like food, to eat only apples is unhealthy and uninteresting.
<LI>(1) Universe = God; (2) God isn't human, don't pretend to understand; (3) all religions, including atheism, are FALSE, but you can't avoid believing... just keep that in mind; (4) you'll stop laughing when the Saucers come.
<LI>People made up religion because they did not know what to beleive.  There is a scientific explination for everything except religion...think about that.
<LI>Although I believe strongly in God, I believe that every other person has the right  to their own choices and I do not ha ve the right to impose my values on them.
<LI>WITHOUT GOD  I WOULD BE LOST
<LI>Walt Whitman writes:  ...I find no sweeter fat than sticks to my own bones.  That seems closest to the truth.
<LI>Live and let live--everyone has a choice.
<LI>http://sunsite.unc.edu/subgenius/
<LI>Religion is a personal thing.  I believe that religion should be a one-on-one relationship with God.  You do not necessarily have to 'fit' into a major sect of religion to be with God.
<LI>I've never met any gods.
<LI>God wants us all with Him in heaven. The truest path to Heaven is provided by the 2,000 year old Roma Catholic Church.
<LI>The self is the highest being in the world.
<LI>`There is one God, He sent His son to die on the cross so that the people of the world could be saved from sin and be born again.  If you do not believe, you are lost, and will go to hell when you die.
<LI>There is a supreme being who is the same God all religions pray to.  Adhereing to one dogma is not required.
<LI>Religion and/or a belief in a supreme being is a key aspect of a strong mental stability as well as a strong societal stability.  It can be shown "Statistically" that since the decline of the religious society in America, there has been a significant increase in catagories such as teen pregnancy, violent crime, etc. .  If we have no one to answer to other than man and we have no regard for our fellow man, then what is to keep us from the desicration of man in whatever fashion desired?
<LI>I believe that Jesus of Nazareth is the Son of God and brings us a message of Love and salvation. Love God with all your mind, heart, and strength and love your neighbor.
<LI>materialist and existentialist, but I distrust the strict dualisms that are sometimes associated with these: mind/brain and tool/free being
<LI>I believe in tolerance for those who believe diferrently, and respect their right to choose, until they start trying to foist their crap onto me.  e.g. Jehovah's Witness knocking on my door at 7am and barging right in while I'm still in my underwear.  Damn safe storage gun laws.
<LI>SITUATIONAL ETHICS.
<LI>Lack of faith in God is the reason Bubba is the President and the reason for the moral decline in this country. Morality is not relative; it is defined by God and is absolute. Denial of this does not change the truth of it.
<LI>Religion makes me peaceful, it's ggood to have someone to trust.
<LI>Religion like other social institutions is in constant danger of being corrupted.  Faith should be sought avidly and humbly and sincerely.  To the extent that the church is considered a community of individuals seeking to love God, each other and their enemies, growth occures.  The institutional church must be constantly questioned.
<LI>I am not religious and do not expect others to follow my beliefs
<LI>Millions of people have died in the name of "religion"
<LI>there is no God, forsay, he is the great spirit we will all go meet in the afterlife.  We have also been doing this life thing for a very long time.  why do you think they've found life on Mars?  someone folowed the right path and pushed the button to stop life there and send the seed of life to Earth.
<LI>There is only one God and Mohammad PBUH is his last massenger
<LI>comprehensive way of life.
<LI>It has a little buddhism, a little hinduism, a little islam, a little confusciousism, a little native american,  all wrapped up with alot my own beliefs.  It is right to me because it is the core of my own beliefs. God is as much of me as I am of him.  I don't pray, just wonder and observe the beautiful and distructive forces of nature that can't ultimately be labeled by the scientific community as something fully explainable or  predicted.  I am fully at peace with myself and with what ever is coming.
<LI>Jesus is Lord
<LI>Religion made more dammages to the society than good things.
<LI>All religions have the same theme- LOVE
<LI>I think that religion destroys and creates but I could not enter that in the field above. I think that extremists of any kind are a little odd and worrying. Any person who attempts to force their own opinion on others, whether right or wrong, is an asshole and deserves contempt. I realize that some 'religious' people would not approve of my use of swearing but it hurts no-one and allows me to express myself.
<LI>All forms of life should be respected.
<LI>One should act in a truthful, ethical manner, to the greatest benefit of all one's areas of living.
<LI>Religion is extremely unimportant.  What is important is spirituallity.  They are different and until we realize that will not have the tolerance to live together peacefully.
<LI>Religion is different than spirituality--a religious person may not necessarily be spiritual.
<LI>TIME IS SHORT,TRUST IN GOD--HE'S COMING BACK!!
<LI>keep looking
<LI>Way of life
<LI>religion creates connection and disipline
<LI>Be of service
<LI>Love the Lord your God with all your soul, all your heart and all your mind and your neighbor as yourself
<LI>Reconstructionist Judaism
<LI>Religion is a difficult concept to grasp, but essentially it is a slave morality. It states that sufferring is an acceptable means for life; dignity and its pursuit are the only activities of life and to suggest otherwise is to limit the will of a human being which is intolerable.
<LI> Scientologists believe that most human problems can be traced to lingering spirits of an extraterrestrial people massacred by their ruler, Xenu, over 75 million years ago. These spirits attach themselves by clusters to individuals in the contemporary world, causing spiritual harm and negatively influencing the lives of their hosts.  --Judge Leonie Brinkema, opinion in RTC v. Lerma.  (RTC , a scientology front group, so disliked the above quote that they attempted to the opinion)  (*The Oregon Ghost *)
<LI>Religion evolves as people understand the world around them. Religious groups need to accept this. We should practice tolerance and acceptance of differences.
<LI>Becoming a Christian has turned my life completey in a whole differen't direction.  Now I live my life life for him and carry out his word.
<LI>I believe God loves us all and showed His love by sending His son Jesus Christ to be the final sacrifices for ours transgressions.  If we believe in Him he will forgive us of our sins no matter what they are or how many.
<LI>We have no objective proof of anything, however some things are much less likely than others to be true.
<LI>Born Catholic with strong interest in Busshism
<LI>That God loves and cares for all people no matter what their view of him is
<LI>My religious philosophy is that Jesus Christ died and rose again to give eternal life to those who believe in Him 
<LI>Religion was and is something that people made up to comfort them when they couldn't answer the question, "What else is there?"  Personally, I am athiest, but I firmly believe in a person's right to worship however they chose as long as it doesn't infringe on anyone else's rights.
<LI>Polyglot including Zen as a base, but including elements of Ceremonial Magick (Golden Dawn), Christianity (NOT Christianism), Kabbalah,... kinda complex, actually  :-)
<LI>I think it rather odd that "atheist" and "Scientologist" are listed as religions--- they are not. Asking atheists and Scientologists about religious beliefs is like asking bald people how they comb their hair--- N/A! Scientology is nothing more than a corrupt business out to victimize as many suckers as they can, for the almighty dollar--- any examination of the nefarious business will show that fact!
<LI>One's spirituality is as important to one's as identity as sexuality or physicality.
<LI>the Golden rule is the most important thing.
<LI>I have never had a religious belief.
<LI>Anything but Scientology. Are you aware that the staff overlords are ordering the benighted scientologists to answer this survey? Takes some of the fun out of it? And all of the information? Narconon is a front. Travolta and Cruise are afraid to speak out because Scinentology's very first step is worming secrets out of you and keeping them forever.
<LI>Scientology lies. Xenu is good. L. Ron is the Antichrist. Scientology is the thriving cult of greed and power. Murder, torture, child abuse, treason, espionage, all Fair Game for the destroyers of the lonely and unwary.
<LI>Organized Religion is leading to the downfall of our society.  Spirituality is more important than Religion.
<LI>Xenu is coming. Scientologists eat their young. Scientologists drain blood to feed the Hive Queen. L. Ron Hubbard was a shoggoth in human guise. Satanism is warmer and fuzzier than Scientology.
<LI>When life sucks, come in its mouth.
<LI>Modern culture should have no need for superstitious beliefs.  The religions of the world have been responsible for untold suffereing and inhuman treatment of one human by another.  Brainless stupidities like creationism threaten to undermine the continued development of science and technology, the real avenues to a better future.
