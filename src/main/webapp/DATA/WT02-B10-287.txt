<h4>Now, you can have immediate access to Original Zippo News, by selecting "continue" at the end of this page. Before you do, please take a moment to read the following text, to make sure Original Zippo services and policy meet your expectations for a News Service.</h4> 
<h4>News Groups - free to the public through Direct Read News ™ access</h4>

alt (except restricted), comp.*, sci.*, soc.*, news.*, rec.*, misc.*, talk.*, and zippo.* <p>
Full <a href="http://news.zippo.com/newsgrpr.txt">list</a> of free news groups.<p>

<h4>Membership Services</h4>
<ul>
<li>Membership can access through NNTP or Direct Read News</li>
<li>Membership can access <a href="http://news.zippo.com/newsgrpm.txt">restricted</a> access news groups</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<center><h3>The Few Simple Rules - For Everyone</h3></center>
<ol>
<li>No SPAM or Cross Posting to more than 15 newsgroups. If you are not sure what's appropriate, read the FAQs in <a href="http://drn.zippo.com/news-bin/wwwnews?news.announce.newusers">news.announce.newusers.</a><p></li>

<li>Access to restricted news groups is by specific request only, and only for adults. If you have selected the optional news groups, <strong>do not give your password to minors</strong>.</li><p>

<li>Don't do anything illegal. Pyramid schemes, and posting pictures of minors in  sexual context are examples of illegal posts. At the very least, it will get you removed from the service.</li><p>
<li>Zippo is not to be used as a feed for other services, and is not for resale or redistribution. Exceeding access to 500 news groups each day, or connecting for more than 6 hours during a 24 hour period, will cause the system to lock you out for 24 hours. Repeat violations will terminate a membership.</li><p>
</ol>
<center><h3>Rules for Us</h3></center>
<ol>
<li>We will do our very best to keep the servers running at all times and keep equipment in good repair</li><p>
<li>While the servers will get slower as more members are added and traffic builds, we will limit membership to a reasonable level </li><p>
<li>We will maintain news groups at approximately the same count and range of topics. We will routinely update hierarchies and replace obsolete groups with current groups in similar categories.</li><p>
<li>We will not edit, censor or cancel posts on content, and we will not take sides in disputes over appropriate posts.</li><p>
<li>We will continue to add features to the service, and upgrade program modules to enhance the performance of the service.</li><p>
</ol><p>
