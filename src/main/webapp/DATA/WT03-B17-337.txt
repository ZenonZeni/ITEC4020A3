 <STRONG><H1> The Elixir of the Earth</H1></STRONG>
     To grow a greener lawn, have healthier trees, and cultivate bigger
vegetables, the soil needs to be enriched. Before reaching for that bag
of  nitrates or other chemical fertilizers, the conscious homeowner  or
farmer  should stop for a moment to consider what needs to be put  back
in  the  soil to enhance its life-giving properties. Like the magnified
form  of  the  human  body, the earth has the  wondrous  capability  of
healing  itself.  When forested areas of the world use up the  nutrients
in  the soil, the earth has a built-in remineralization system that can
be  learned  from and applied right in the back yard.  The  process  is
known as remineralization through rock dust application. John Hammaker,
a  research scientist in Massachusetts, postulates that each ice age in
the  history  of the earth regenerated its topsoil.  When  the  planet's
forests  deplete  the  soils  of nutrients,  they  begin  to  die  off,
releasing  their  stored carbon into the atmosphere.  All  this  carbon
builds up in the atmosphere, creating a "greenhouse effect" and causing
a the earth's temperatures to rise.

    This  heat  is  most  concentrated around the  equator  where  the
sunlight  is  greatest. The higher temperatures cause evaporation,  and
the  moisture rises, creating a vacuum underneath which pulls in cooler
air  from the polar regions. As the air is pulled in from the North and
the  South,  another vacuum ensues, pulling the warm moist air  towards
the  poles.  During  this time there is a lot of strong  activity  like
typhoons  and  hurricanes  that  occur  in  the  earth's  sub-tropical
regions. When the moist warm air from the tropics arrives in the  polar
regions,  it hits the cooler temperatures and condensates as snow.  The
snow  builds up, and the weight causes it to pack into the ice and push
southward from the north pole and northwards from Antarctica.  At  this
time  there is an increase in earthquakes and volcanoes caused  by  the
extra  weight on the continents. The glaciers descend, grinding up  all
rocks  and mountains in their path, remineralizing the soil.  When  the
forests  again  take root, they absorb the carbon from  the  atmosphere
through photosynthesis, and the ice age diminishes.

     Hammaker has extended this hypothesis to explain what is currently
occurring   on   earth  right  now.  According  to  Hammaker,   earth's
inhabitants have accelerated the onset of the next ice age through  the
burning  of fossil fuels and the deforestation of large forested  areas
like  the Amazon. Hammaker says the only way to stop the glaciers  from
knocking  down  our back doors within this generation or the next,  is  to
reduce  our  dependence on fossil fuels, reforest the  cities  and  the
countryside by replanting and remineralizing the earth through  rock
dust   applications.   While   Hammaker   advocates   going   out   and
remineralizing  all forests and fields, the average  homeowner  usually
does not have the time to take on such a large task. However, by simply
taking  care  of  one's  yard  and garden through  natural  means,  the
cumulative effects will yield significant results on a global scale.

<STRONG><H2>About Rock Dust</H2></STRONG>
     The  amount of minerals and the quality rock used to produce  rock
dust  depends  on  the location of the quarry, and the mining  process.
Many  companies  sell rock dust, but it is best to inquire  about  what
minerals  it  contains and if there are any chemicals added.  If  their
manufacturing  plant  is  nearby, ask to take a  tour.  Some  companies
simply  sell  the  dust  that  is left over  from  manufacturing  other
products.  This  may  not have the necessary minerals  for  plants  and
trees,  so it is best to buy rock dust from those companies which  make
it  specifically  for this use. They will be happy  to  provide  a  lab
report for you.

     Rock dust is usually high in calcium, iron, magnesium, sulfur, and
more  than  100 other trace minerals. The PH level is often  very  high
(eight  or nine) and therefore must be used in small amounts,  combined
with  compost, with peat moss if acid soil is required, or made into  a
liquid form. The rock dust does not dissolve when mixed with water, but
forms  a  colloid, making it instantly available to the  plants  it  is
sprayed  on.  Rock dust can replace many other  natural  mineral
products which are harder to get and more expensive.

<STRONG><H2>The Bacteria Eat First</H2></STRONG>
     Not all the food that you add to your soil makes it to the plants.
Initially, it must be broken down by soil microbes. The microbes live
in  many  different areas of the soil, some live on the root  hairs  of
many plants, some live only deep in the ground. The bacteria which live on the
root  hairs  of  plants convert minerals found  in  the  soil  into  a
different  form of the same mineral which is available to  the  plants.
Microbes  tear  apart or combine minerals. Also when the  microbes  die
they leave behind minerals in a changed form which is also available to
the plants as food.

<STRONG><H2>Mix The Dust</H2></STRONG>
     For  best  results mix different sources of rock dust together  to
get more complete trace minerals. There are many companies now offering
rock  dust. We have listed as many of them as possible in our  Resource
Directory. (coming soon)

<STRONG><H2>Making your own Rock Dust</H2></STRONG>
     While  this is not the easiest way, it can be done. Obtain a fifty
gallon  steel drum, weld bicycle gears at both ends. Hook up a  bicycle
through the chain gears. Set up the front wheel on a non-moveable base.
Get  a  large round river stone to place inside. Make an opening  which
can be closed and locked. Then place local rocks into drum and exercise
while crushing the rocks! Most soft rocks will work well. You can  also
crush  lobster  tails, clams, and other seafood materials.  Add  oyster
shells to increase calcium.
