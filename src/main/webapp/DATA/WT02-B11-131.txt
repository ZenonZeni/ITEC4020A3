Technology &amp; Health: Visa and Sony, in an Ambitious Effort, Plan an Internet <br>
Entertainment Service ----<br>
11/16/95 02:15<br>
  Visa International and Sony Corp. are expected to announce today a <br>
partnership<br>
to create one of the most ambitious entertainment services on the Internet.<br>
<p>
  The service, targeted for the multimedia portion of the Internet known as <br>
the<br>
World Wide Web, would be filled with information and games born from Sony's <br>
vast<br>
array of movies, music and entertainment. The on-line fare could be <br>
purchased<br>
with Visa credit cards, 400 million of which are used world-wide. Dubbed <br>
Sony<br>
Station, the site would include new programming produced for the on-line<br>
environment when it launches in April.<br>
<p>
  "It would be wrong to think of this as an alternative delivery system," <br>
said<br>
Michael P. Schulhof, president and chief executive officer of Sony Corp. of<br>
America. "We will develop a host of new services drawing from all of the<br>
creative talent from all of our operating units," which include Sony <br>
Television<br>
Entertainment, Sony Music Entertainment and Sony Pictures Entertainment, he<br>
said.<br>
<p>
  The move underscores the intention of big media companies to cut out the<br>
middlemen of commercial on-line services and take control of their own<br>
electronic services on the Internet's World Wide Web. America Online Inc., <br>
the<br>
largest commercial on-line service, reaches four million users, while the <br>
Web,<br>
according to a recent survey, has 24 million users in North America. A <br>
Web-based<br>
service, said Sony's Mr. Schulhof, "reaches a much larger audience."<br>
<p>
  Sony executives shied away from details, but they said the site would be<br>
rendered in three-dimensional "space." Users could "enter" various <br>
"pavilions"<br>
to play, for example, an on-line game of "Wheel of Fortune" or "Jeopardy!"<br>
Winners might use their Visa cards to purchase their discounted prizes. <br>
Users<br>
also may be able to tap into behind-the-scenes information about "Seinfeld" <br>
and<br>
soap operas such as "The Young and the Restless," or "chat" on-line with <br>
stars<br>
of a new on-line soap opera that might be offered on a pay-per-view basis. <br>
They<br>
may eventually be able to download new songs from unreleased albums from the<br>
likes of Michael Jackson and Barbra Streisand.<br>
<p>
  But marketing a Web site amid the flood of new Web sites is increasingly<br>
difficult. Sony and Visa face fierce competition from major media concerns <br>
and<br>
individual users who already offer their own database of anything relating <br>
to<br>
"Seinfeld," for example. Moreover, the companies have to overcome the<br>
overwhelming fear in the marketplace that the Internet is no place for <br>
passing<br>
credit-card data.<br>
<p>
  People "don't have to worry about some hacker coming in and ripping off <br>
their<br>
credit-card number," vowed Todd Chaffee, a senior vice president at Visa, <br>
which<br>
is leading one of the biggest industry efforts to develop secure on-line <br>
payment<br>
systems for the Internet.<br>
<p>
  Industry watchers said the two companies, with their consumer and <br>
financial<br>
expertise, could significantly step up the consumer realm of electronic<br>
commerce. Consumers are "looking for familiar names that they trust, and <br>
Sony<br>
and Visa are names that fall into that category," said Gary Arlen, president <br>
of<br>
research firm Arlen Communications Inc.<br>
<p>
  Executives close to the companies said that Visa and Sony are investing <br>
more<br>
than $20 million in the service in the next "several years."<br>
