<TITLE>Trans Union/DATEQ - Youthful Drivers Legislation</TITLE>

<P>
Research conducted by the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration in Washington, D.C. indicates traffic accidents
are the <b>#1 cause of death </b>for youth ages 15-20; their accident
rate is 4 times that of adults; and they make up 7% of the population
yet account for about 14% of vehicle-related deaths.

<P>
In an effort to reduce the number of young people injured
and killed in traffic accidents and to control costs of insuring
youthful drivers, the graduated licensing system is becoming more
and more commonplace. <b>Graduated licensing</b> is a progressive approach
by which 16-year-olds may earn the privilege of unrestricted driving.
A model bill proposed by the National Association of Independent
Insurers (NAII) is being examined by several states. The bill
calls for stricter education and examination procedures, automatic
suspensions for major traffic offenses, zero tolerance for blood
alcohol content, and provisional licenses that limit driving to
the hours of midnight to 6 am.

<P>
Although no states have passed a complete graduated licensing
law, numerous states have enacted<b> elements of the law</b>. Since January
1995, Delaware, Maine and Washington instituted zero alcohol tolerance
for drivers under 21. Iowa, Montana and Rhode Island's law provides
for reduction of the minimum blood alcohol level to .02 for drivers
under 21. North Carolina passed a law with limited license provisions
and zero alcohol tolerance. California and Louisiana made seatbelt
enforcement primary. In addition, Arkansas, Connecticut, Indiana,
Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, South Carolina, Tennessee,
Texas, Virginia and Wyoming legislatures have graduated licensing
bills pending.
