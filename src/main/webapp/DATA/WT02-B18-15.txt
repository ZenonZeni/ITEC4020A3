NEC And Intel Announce Partnership For Global Biodiversity Conservation

<!-------------------------This is the release text---------------------------->
<P>
Jakarta – Computer giants <A HREF="http://www.nec.com" TARGET="main">NEC</A> and <A HREF="http://www.intel.com" TARGET="main">Intel</A> announced a partnership for conservation of the world's  biological diversity today, with joint support of a project to bring computer technology to 25 biosphere reserves in Asia, Latin America and Africa.
<P>
The partnership was announced during the opening ceremony of a two week training workshop for biosphere reserve managers from the Asia region, with representatives from China, the Philippines, Indonesia, Mongolia and Thailand. Conservation International, a U.S. environmental group and a leader in applying computer technologies to conservation will conduct the training. The project is in cooperation with the <A HREF="http://www.unesco.org" TARGET="main">United Nations Education, Scientific and Cultural Organization</A> (UNESCO), which created the concept of biosphere reserves in 1971 and today coordinates a network of 334 reserves in 84 countries.
<P>
"This project demonstrates how NEC's commitment to Computers and Communications can increase the human potential to maintain the health of our planet's ecosystems. It extends our long-standing support of environmental initiatives by making the most of technology for nature conservation at a global level," said Mr. Ono, Senior Vice President of NEC Corp.
<P>
"Bringing the power of the personal computer into these biosphere reserves allows researchers to collect and process vast amounts of data and quickly share crucial information with colleagues around the world. Strengthening this capacity will have a multiplying effect throughout the regions in which they work," said Intel Chairman Dr. Gordon E. Moore.
<P>
Indonesia's Ministry of Forestry is hosting the training at the Cibodas reserve near Jakarta. 

<P>

Indonesia is among the world's megadiversity countries, with an extremely high number of 
plant and animals species. It is also experiencing rapid development, which puts pressure on natural ecosystems necessary to support biological diversity.
<P>
The main goals of the project are to strengthen institutional capacity and provide sophisticated computer equipment to allow for the transfer of technology and networking among biosphere reserves. Conservation International, which has projects in several biosphere reserves, will provide training and software for its <A HREF="../../../science/cptc/capbuild/training/cisigbro.htm">Geographic Information System</A> (GIS), Global Positioning Systems (GPS), biological databases and Internet communications.
<P>
"This project illustrates the power of partnerships. NEC and Intel are providing support and technology. Conservation International is providing on the ground expertise and UNESCO is providing global coordination for the network of biosphere reserves," said Peter A. Seligmann, CI Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "Together we're bringing the most sophisticated technology to bear on conservation while ensuring economic health."
<P>
Designed to offer local conservationists in developing countries access to critical technology, GIS is particularly useful in biosphere reserves, because it integrates geographical, biological and ecological data with social and economic factors, displaying them as visual images. Among its many applications are assessing the environmental impact of development projects and evaluating trends in deforestation and human disturbances. Access to the Internet is critically important for scientists who can use electronic networks to access data, exchange information, and communicate with their colleagues in other countries.
<P>
"This is conservation at work in today's high-tech world. Getting the right kind of equipment and technology to people in developing nations is a tremendous help in confronting a multitude of rapidly changing environmental challenges . . . " said Silvio T. Olivieri, CI's Vice President for Conservation Planning and Technical Cooperation. "This kind of commitment from corporate leaders is essential in keeping up the necessary momentum to balance the ever increasing pace of environmental destruction throughout the world."
<P>
<A HREF="../../../science/cptc/capbuild/unesco/what_is.htm">Biosphere reserves</A> are dedicated to the conservation of critical ecosystems, scientific research on biological diversity, and the establishment of sustainable alternatives for the 
management of natural resources. However, despite their international recognition, biosphere reserves often face critical shortages in the technology needed to manage natural resources and establish electronic communication links to the outside world.  This 
lack of technical capacity is greatest in developing countries, which frequently claim the highest concentration of biological diversity under the greatest threats.
