<H3>The Detailed Picture: Individual Landcover Types </H3>
<HR>

<P>
The previous chapter reported the big picture; an overview of
the continent and States and Territories.
<P>
This section is a preparation for the next on <A HREF="content5.htm">Case Studies</A>.
Both of these sections report in detail on individual landcover
types.
<P>
Before doing so, we remind the reader that the primary focus of
this project was the entire continent: we systematically sought
to derive a consistent overall view. This objective required that
we worked at coarse spatial scales and what is particularly relevant
here, paid equal attention to all landcover types.
<P>
As a consequence, the results may be puzzling. Some of the landcover
types that are the subject of frequent public debate do not occupy
a central place, or even seem important.
<P>
One such example is the closed forests of the tropical coasts
(xTML4 - the closed forests), which cover only a few percent of
the area of the continent; see Table 3 and the following image
of Townsville. <HR>

<A HREF="reptill/townsvil.gif"><IMG SRC="reptills/townsvil.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></A>
<P>
<I>The 1: 1, 000, 000 scale map sheet TOWNSVILLE covering the
tropical Queensland coast and inland; total area approximately
120, 000 km2. A very large proportion of the tropical rainforests
was located in this region. A moment's interpretation of the colours
and patterns in this image results in the conclusion that the
landscapes are now significantly modified. Landuse has, and continues,
to influence this landcover type.</I><HR>

<P>
We also remind the reader that we have no index of biodiversity
importance with which to sensitise or further stratify our analysis.
<P>
No doubt, because of their intrinsically high biodiversity complement,
the tropical rainforests have high conservation value. Unfortunately,
the equivalent data and understanding are lacking whereby the
remaining landcover types can be ranked for biodiversity significance
or even conservation status.
<P>
At present, importance for biodiversity is most commonly assigned
simply on the basis of the presence of small populations of a
rare species, usually fauna. We would prefer to assign importance
and stratify our study on the basis of continental datasets of
the level of endemism, and on the nature and level of threat.
We believe this report contributes to the latter approach.
<P>
Unfortunately, there is no continental assessment of endemism.
<P>
The remainder of this chapter details how and what will be reported
in <A HREF="content5.htm">Case Studies</A>.
<P>
If you are interested in the Case Studies, then it is worth your
while to continue with this section.<HR>

<H4>Reporting Methodology </H4>
<HR>

<P>
The current level of landcover disturbance and vulnerability to
further disturbance were separately assessed for each of the 33
landcover types within both the ILZ and ELZ.
<P>
From this complete list, a subset of 16 types is presented in
detail with this common format of reporting and scoring.
<P>
<B>Description</B> 
<P>
Each landcover type is identified with its number and symbol,
described in terms of the structural and floristic grouping, and
illustrated with a landscape photograph.
<P>
To convey an overall impression of where a particular landcover
type is found in a regional landscape, a pair of satellite images
is provided. The first image of the pair shows the entire regional
landscape: the second shows just the landcover type.
<P>
<B>Size And Location</B> 
<P>
A tabular summary of the absolute and relative aggregate area
within the ILZ and ELZ is provided along with an image of the
relative size and distribution of all locations of this landcover
type for the following:
