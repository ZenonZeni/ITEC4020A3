<P>
As a result of the assessment team's discussions,
a number of important opportunities for coordinated efforts and
possible joint ventures between DOE and industry were apparent.
 Each of these areas can produce important near term results that
will spur the continued development of the biomass resource and
generation capacity in the 1990s.  These opportunities received
strong consideration in the development of the DOE Five-Year Plan.
<P>
<A NAME="4.1"><B>4.1 Co-firing Biomass and Coal in Utility Boilers</B></A>
<P>
Co-firing alternative fuels, such as biomass and coal (or other fossil fuels), has been
conducted on an experimental basis by utilities without much fanfare
throughout the U.S. Experience
varied with boiler configuration.  In pulverized coal boilers,
cofiring has been limited to a few percent of heat input.  In
coal stokers, the percentage co-firing has been increased into
the 25% to 50% range, while fluidized bed boilers have been fired
with mixtures that span the full range.
<P>
 Co-firing, as a strategy
element of the Biomass Power Program, provides one of the best
opportunities to quickly bring the utilities into the fold of
biomass resource users.  IPPs that build or own coal-fired stations
may also be interested.  From the utility point of view, co-firing
is attractive for several reasons.  Co-firing of inexpensive byproduct
fuels solves two problems.  It helps  mitigate a waste wood disposal
problem that is becoming increasingly burdensome for industrial
customers, municipalities, and citizens.  As landfill restrictions
are tightened and operating costs spiral upward, the diversion
of waste wood from landfills to the power generator as a low/no-cost
fuel resource can provide direct consumer benefits.  Not only
is landfill space preserved, but consumer waste disposal costs
and customer power rates may be lowered.  If the byproduct fuels
can be procured at a near zero cost, it may provide the only opportunity
to revitalize some smaller capacity coal units that are no longer
economical to dispatch as base or intermediate load plants.  Co-firing
is also a low-risk, low-capital cost option.  This makes it a
much easier sell to both utility management and the Public Utilities
Commission.  Other cogent factors favoring co-firing from the utility
perspective include: 
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Direct environmental benefits of both
reduced air emissions (lower SOx, NOx, and CO2 emissions) and
reduced solid waste streams.  Thus, biomass provides power while
demonstrating corporate commitment to a cleaner environment.
<P>
<LI>Possible economic benefits accruing to SO2 allowances and avoidance
of potential carbon taxes.
<P>
<LI>Fewer permitting problems by introducing
this 'new' fuel on a partial basis at existing permitted
facilities.
<P>
<LI>Fuel flexibility providing negotiating advantages
in fuel procurement for coal and biomass.
</UL>
<P>
From the DOE perspective
several factors make this strategy attractive:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>This strategy
element is also a low risk to DOE on both the investment and technical
ends.
<P>
<LI>Co-firing offers the best near-term opportunity to bring
the traditional utility companies into the biomass power arena
providing them with fuel procurement, permitting, and operational
experience.
<P>
<LI>Environmental regulators and the public are afforded
the opportunity to evaluate the use of biomass fuels in a permitting
setting that is far less threatening.
<P>
<LI>Co-firing is a technology
choice that can deliver its share of the power generation capacity
goal set for the biomass power program in SOLAR 2000.
<P>
<LI>Co-firing can provide the lower risk transition step to DFSS development.
</UL>
<P>
Only
two utilities have cofired coal and biomass on a continuous basis.
 These are Tacoma Public Utilities and Northern States Power.
 Burlington's McNeil plant was designed to operate solely on wood
fuel but was later converted to cofire natural gas (at low summer
rates) and biomass to improve plant economics and dispatchability.
<P>
In
the Southeast and mid-Atlantic region, several utilities have
experimented with co-firing biomass and coal in existing utility
boilers.  Santee Cooper has successfully fired a 5% mix of biomass
and coal on a temporary basis.  Others, including Delmarva and
Carolina Power and Light, have run wood/coal co-firing tests. 
TVA is undertaking a year long study of retrofit options for its
coal-fired power stations as well as resource assessments.  Early
results indicate that there are units that could be adapted for
pulverized wood firing with minimal impacts on boiler operation.
 The Southern Company is in the midst of a similar assessment
and is already co-firing wood and paper processing byproducts on
a limited basis at several facilities in the system.  In fact,
the Southern Company affiliated utilities have expressed a desire
to implement pilot plant conversions at several smaller stations
in the system.
<P>
In the Northeast, Niagara Mohawk is investigating
opportunities to cofire a number of alternative fuels in its coal-fired
facilities primarily to take advantage of very low cost byproduct
fuels to improve the dispatchability of existing coal-fired stations
on an economic basis.  NYSEG is already co-firing wood chips on
a limited basis (less than 1%) and has expressed similar reasons
for its interest in co-firing.
<P>
It is important to note that utilities
did not feel that SO2 reductions alone will have a significant
enough benefit to make co-firing a good investment.  It is clear
that other factors will have be present to make a co-firing retrofit
worthwhile.  In some discussions, previous attempts to cofire
more difficult biomass fuels, such as peat, or cofire by directly
mixing minimally processed biomass on the coal pile, led to operational
problems that has left some plant operators skeptical.  A co-firing
initiative on the part of DOE will have to consider these concerns
in addition to the other concerns typically raised for use of
biomass fuels.
<P>
Several strategy elements and issues are evolving
from these and other similar assessments in the region.  For interested
utilities, the unknowns and concerns that need to be addressed
include:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Potential boiler operation impacts: efficiency losses,
increased slagging potential, boiler capacity derating, fuel feed
control and boiler response, downtime for retrofits, combustion
instability, and unknown levels of emissions (NOx, VOCs, CO, SOx,
PM10).
<P>
<LI>Fuel delivery, handling and stocking concerns: fuel
deliveries (access and congestion), on-site fuel storage area
required for low density fuel, fuel pile emissions, fire hazards
and decomposition, separate on-site fuel processing equipment
needs, fuel feed and boiler interconnections, fuel processing
and handling safety, system flexibility for coal/biomass interchange
and systems reliability.
<P>
<LI>Fuel procurement: availability,
price and its impact on plant dispatchability, fuel contract administration,
fuel quality assurance and variability.
<P>
<LI>Impacts on environmental
controls: ESP, baghouse or scrubber  performance impacts and their
consequences for permit compliance or review.
<P>
<LI>Impacts on plant
staffing.
</UL>
<P>
In addition, plant managers will want to know if the
positive benefits of co-firing outweigh the possible problems of
plant and operational modifications to accommodate the use of
the fuel.  To convince system and plant managers to pursue co-firing
projects, joint venture activities must address the issues in
three ways.  First and foremost, there is a desire to see that
retrofits can be made with minimal impacts on plant capacity,
operations, and dispatchability.  Second, the benefits of co-firing
must translate into meaningful incentives.  This could include:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>achieving NOx or SOx compliance through co-firing without
further modifications
<P>
<LI>increased run-time (capacity factor)
due to reduced operating costs and/or environmental dispatch incentives,
such as carbon dioxide caps on generation
<P>
<LI>reductions in loadings
of local municipal landfills from industrial sources due to diversion
to co-firing facilities
</UL>
<P>
Third, the fuel procurement systems must
be demonstrated to assure plant managers that a sufficient long-term
source of known quality fuel will be available to the plant.
<P>
The
types of projects that are required include generic design studies
for each of the major boiler configurations, demonstration projects
designed to address all aspects of the retrofit and cofiring operations.
 Specific joint venture hardware tests might include:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>evaluation
of preprocessing equipment capability to meet desired fuel specifications
that minimize boiler modifications (fuel dryers, and mills);
<P>
<LI>evaluations of alternative boiler retrofit options to optimize
combustion stability, completeness, and minimize regulated emissions;
<P>
<LI>evaluations of boiler and fuel feed equipment configurations
that permit a high degree of flexibility with respect to fuel
mix and boiler response to load changes;
<P>
<LI>on the institutional
side, initiatives that address possible evaluation of changes
in dispatch rules and system operations and accounting that provide
incentives based on the demonstrated benefits of cofiring.
</UL>
<P>
<A NAME="4.2"><B>4.2 Expanded Resource Availability</B></A>
<P>
One general area of need and
opportunity will be projects and activities that expand the current
resource base available to power producers.  As can be seen in
Byproducts such as agricultural residues represent the upper
end of the current supply curve in California.  The possibilities
raised span the potential market from wood and paper byproduct
streams to energy crops as a supplemental source.  Nearly all
the IPP and utility representatives expressed the desire to be
able to use a wider base of fuel resources economically.  It was
very clear from the meetings that the continued survival of the
nascent biomass power industry would depend on the expansion of
availability of diverse, low-cost fuel sources.  Each potential
resource has a specific set of issues to be addressed although
environmental, collection and permitting issues pervade them all.
 Many of the potential feedstock sources are byproducts of industrial
or agricultural operations.  It will be more efficient for the
Biomass Power Program to work jointly with DOE Industrial Energy
R&D Programs and USDA Product Development Programs to develop
these resources.
<P>
<B>Efficient collection of agricultural residues</B>.
 Orchard prunings, and wheat and rice straw are a few of the sources
that the IPPs and utilities expressed interest in utilizing as
a fuel source.  However, these residues can be costly to collect
and their availability is seasonal.  The further tightening of
open field burning restrictions could prove to be a strong motivating
factor for these efforts.  Estimates of the farmer's cost to collect
and bail wheat materials range from $17 to $30 per ton.  Furthermore,
the resource is low density, on the order of 1 to 3 tons per acre
per year.  The desirable solution appears to be the development
of collection processes that are integrated with harvesting. 
By densifying and collecting the material as a part of the harvesting
process, these fuels could be affordably collected.  Collection
must then be augmented by an efficient delivery system to transport
fuels to the plant.
<P>
<B>Increasing the availability of residues
from improved forest management practices</B>.  

<p>In California
and the Pacific Northwest, concerns for habitat protection continue
to be strongly supported.  However, the economic downturn coupled
with recent experiences with forest fires and the desire to use
forest resources to benefit economic growth have spurred efforts
to institute forest management practices that consider the benefits
of removing salvageable materials that would otherwise be tinder
for forest fires.  The industry that must operate in this region
generally feels that the level of emotion that pervades the forum
on the use of forest lands is hamstringing productive and environmentally
sound uses of the resource.  The initiative that the industry
is seeking here is to involve DOE and the Forest Service in efforts
that would gain acceptance for good management practices that
provide for the health of forests while permitting economic use
of the available resources.  Opportunities to demonstrate these
practices are being developed by the owners of Biomass One in
eastern Oregon at a 5-MWe site.  Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E)
has indicated its willingness to offer a renewable generation
rate for such projects and the Bonneville Power Administration
(BPA) could also be a player in this process.  The situation in
Vermont is similar, but the driving force for access to forest
resources has been towards management programs designed to cull
the low-value species that predominate in Vermont woods to allow
high-value species to make a comeback.  Burlington Electric considers
its fuel harvest management approach to be a model for the industry.
 Burlington suggested that one area where federal support could
be of direct assistance would be in providing resources to the
state forestry and agriculture programs to underwrite the costs
of surveying forest resources, developing harvest management plans,
and providing manpower for inspection to assure compliance with
authorized harvest plans.  This would directly reduce costs born
solely by the utility that increase fuel procurement costs. 
<P>
<B>Tapping treated mill byproduct materials</B>.  In addition
to untreated wood byproducts, the industry would like to access
other mill byproduct streams such as pulping process byproducts
or treated wood byproducts (fiberboard, plywood).  The ability
to economically process these byproducts into transportable fuel
forms and burn them without environmental permitting repercussions
is the primary issue.  JWP Energy Products, Inc., is concluding
a project in Virginia that burns paper mill sludges at a rate
of 32 DTPD.  Wheelabrator expressed interest in processes that
would pelletize pulp and paper sludges for fuel.  These fuels
are potentially of most value to the mills for cogeneration.
<P> 
<B>Tapping low-value paper byproduct streams</B>.  Treated
paper products such as newsprint, colored or finished paper and
chemically impregnated cardboard byproducts are difficult to recycle
into new paper products.  Rather than landfill these materials,
recycling them as fuels would be desirable.  One of the industry
contacts pointed out that the recycling of low-value paper sources
to produce paper often generates more mill sludge than paper.
 For these materials, fuel uses may be the higher value use with
the least environmental impact.  JWP Energy Products, Inc., is
particularly interested in developing a multi-fueled energy project
in northern Idaho to demonstrate low emissions from today's fluidized
bed combustion technology.
<P>
<B>Tapping urban wood materials
from the solid waste stream</B>.  Several efforts are being pursued
that tap into the urban wood materials supply, thus diverting
it from the solid waste stream.  Burlington is accepting yard
and tree trimmings at the McNeil station.  Wheelabrator is in
the process of building a 39-MWe energy facility in Polk County,
Florida, that will burn a combination of yard and tree trimmings,
used tires, and landfill gas.  Thermo Energy has three operating
facilities and is completing a fourth that use urban wood as a
fuel source.  Use of urban wood has been extensively evaluated
by New York State and others as an important source of fuel for
power production.  Use of urban wood directly reduces landfill
loading and provides low-cost fuel for power production.  The
primary issue has been concern with air emissions from the use
of treated wood products.  The NYSERDA work generally indicates
that with the exception of CCA-treated wood, the exposure risks
of combusting most treated wood are very slight or insignificant
and meet state guidelines.  NYSEG is particularly interested in
specialized used wood streams and is evaluating fuels such as
railroad ties and telephone poles.  Forced recycling goals for
California and other jurisdictions may make these fuel sources
more accessible.
<P>
<B>Early development of dedicated feedstock
supply system (DFSS) projects to supplement other fuel sources</B>.
 Possible use of DFSS as a source of fuel is being considered
for projects in Alabama, Minnesota, Virginia, Wisconsin, New York,
the Tennessee Valley, and California.  EPRI is very supportive
of this approach for two reasons: long term supply assurance and
disassociation of biomass from the potential environmental problems
of misusing forest resources, and limitations of byproduct or
waste fuels.  Two things appear to be necessary for the DFSS concept
to be accepted as economic for current industry projects-assurances
that the EPACT 92 production tax credits can be used by the project
and the ability to serve several markets with the biomass products
(eg. white wood going to paper production, bark and lesser grades
of wood harvested going to fuel uses).  

<p>In New York, NYSEG, Niagara
Mohawk, and SUNY (Syracuse) are pursuing a trial DFSS project
based on hybrid willow clones.  The fuel produced would be test
co-fired in utility coal-fired boilers.  

<p>In Virginia, poplars
grown on existing farm acreage are being considered as a potential
fuel supplement option for obtaining a secure long-term fuel supply
required by lenders for a wood-fired IPP project.  

<p>In California,
the DFSS option is being given consideration as a supplemental
fuel source to provide an alternative to current sources that
are in high demand by competing uses.  Ag West Resources has proposed
a DFSS project to support the Thermo Energy project at Woodland,
California.  The Sacramento Municipal Utility District (SMUD)
is working with the University of California-Davis to identify
the four most productive DFSS species for the Sacramento valley.
 With passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)
pending, California is very concerned about the decline in state
agriculture with the opening of markets to products produced in
Mexico.  

<p>In the Tennessee Valley, DFSS projects offer the ability
to expand the use of biomass fuel sources needed to implement
TVA's coal- and wood-cofiring strategy without recourse to harvests
from environmentally sensitive resources.  Another interesting
concept put forth is the dual purpose use of energy crops as erosion
control and ground water filtering systems.  This increases the
value of the DFSS as a dual-purpose system.  

<p>In the San Joaquin
Valley, 600,000 eucalyptus and casuarina trees (some poplars also
tested) have been planted to control erosion and absorb selenium
salts from irrigation runoff.<sup>1</sup>
<P>
<A NAME="4.3"><B>4.3 Repowering Existing Steam
Turbine Stations</B></A>
<P>
Many of the generating units built by IPPs
were constructed when available biomass resources were inexpensive
and purchased power agreements were generous.  As such, combustion
efficiency was not considered a major issue at that time.  As
power purchase agreements expire and new contracts are negotiated,
the ability of many of these facilities to continue to be economically
productive will be in question.  In addition to tougher power
contracts, stricter environmental regulations and a tighter wood
supply situation are threatening the economic health of the industry.
 
<p>In California, IPP and QF biomass power stations now account
for approximately 4% of total generation for PG&E.  Repowering
projects can improve the efficiency and availability of some of
these plants to extend their useful life until a new generation
of conversion systems becomes commercially available.  This is
also true for two other classes of power facilities: wood-fired
units operated by the pulp and paper industry, and aging coal-fired
plants operated by the utilities or industry.  The pulp and paper
industry would benefit from a greater degree of self sufficiency
while the utilities could upgrade and extend the life of older
units.  Options include:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Gasification of agricultural biomass
fuels to fire boilers previously plagued by slagging problems.
 Low-temperature gasification can produce a fuel gas that will
be free of slagging materials and can be fired in existing boilers
at relatively high efficiency  and with increased plant availability.
 There are a number of plants that have plentiful resources of
agricultural byproducts but cannot keep the boiler in operation
due to severe slagging problems.  Gasification could provide the
solution to reintroduce the agricultural byproduct fuels into
the operation.
<P>
<LI>Gasification combined cycle retrofits to increase
efficiency and reduce operating costs.  Repowering existing boilers
with a gasification combined cycle offers the potential to salvage
projects where fuel costs have made biomass operations uneconomic.
Green Mountain Power, with assistance
from EPRI, is giving this option consideration.  Burlington Electric's
McNeil Station is currently dispatched on an economic basis at
a low capacity factor and is a possible candidate for repowering.
 Approximately 40% of generated power is currently produced using
gas available during the summer at very low cost.  Gasification
combined cycle would reduce fuel operating costs by as much as
25%.  Paper and wood products industries such as Weyerhaeuser
have expressed interest in the gasification combined cycle with
the intent of being even more self sufficient in terms of self-producing
power for plant operations.
</UL>
<P>
<A NAME="4.4"><B>4.4 Modular Scale Prepackaged Generating
Systems and Custom Built Agripower Systems for International Markets</B></A>
<P>
For
international markets in areas where power is frequently needed
in smaller increments and biomass resources are plentiful, small
scale packaged biomass generators will be very attractive.  Several
companies are evaluating the market and the technology that would
best serve the market.  One company, Energeo, is committed to
development of those markets with the intent to offer a line of
prepackaged indirect-fired gas turbine generators sized from 200
kW up to several Megawatts.
 PGI is also developing a product (direct-fired small gas turbines)
well suited to this market.  The opportunity exists for small
scale, modular biomass systems to compete in the international
marketplace with diesel-powered generators.  By using an inexpensive
indigenous resource, biomass power systems reduce dependence on
high-cost, imported fossil fuels.  Other companies have indicated
interest in offering prepackaged systems for biomass fuels based
on more conventional conversion equipment.
<P>
On a larger scale,
Agrilectric, JWP Electric, and other companies have targeted the
existing agricultural processing industry as potential power producers.
 The sector that has attracted the most initial interest is the
sugar industry, which typically uses its byproducts to produce
process heat.  By converting to higher efficiency cogeneration
equipment at these facilities, the industry and local economy
stand to benefit by the additional income generated by power sales.
 Both JWP and Agrilectric offer products that are suited to the
combustion of agricultural fuels.
<P>
Industries actively pursuing
international markets are aware of the programs sponsored by USAID
and Winrock and in several instances are already benefiting from
these 'technical assistance missions' to developing
nations.  The industry generally felt that these programs were
helpful and should not be duplicated by DOE.
<P>
One element these
programs do not address is the need to demonstrate performance,
maintainability, and reliability claims of the manufacturers.
 The need to see, first hand, a system operating on local feedstocks
for an extended period of time (up to one year) and to realize
the projected cost savings for replacing aging diesel equipment,
is commonly expressed by the purchasing agents of the governments
of developing nations.  An opportunity exists for DOE to pursue
joint venture projects in strategic locations worldwide that make
it easy for representatives of developing nations to see U.S.-built
systems in operation.  A second issue that is clearly of concern
to U.S. firms is the protection of the company's technology rights.
 Reverse engineering of the patented portions of U.S. equipment
is commonplace.  Once a product is available from in-country or
regional sources, there is little market left for the U.S. product
unless the company licenses the technology to in-country manufacturing
concerns and competes with local manufacturing labor.
<P>
<A NAME="4.5"><B>4.5 Developing
Markets for Biomass Power Byproducts</B></A>
<P>
Potential productive uses
of biomass ash include: liming agents and nutrients for agriculture,
landfill caps, sewage sludge stabilization, and structural fill.
 The issues for application of biomass ash are regulatory.  In
the state of Washington, wood ash is classified as a hazardous
waste based on pH>12.  This restricts both the handling and
application of the ash for agricultural uses.  A far more difficult
problem has arisen in California where rice straw ash has been
declared hazardous due to its high silica content.  One project
has been stockpiling the ash on site with the potential of becoming
a hazardous waste clean-up site unless appropriate disposal arrangements
are made.  For urban wood materials, the presence of heavy metals
and other contaminants from chemical treatment pose a problem
for ash disposal.  The approach recommended by industry to overcome
some of these regional restrictions is to develop environmental
consensus standards for biomass ash based on the real risks posed
for transport, application, and use.
<P>
Coproduction of chemicals
and power make it possible to operate plants at full capacity
to generate two product streams.  For gasification, methanol production
is a logical coproduct.  Methanol can be used as a turbine fuel,
a transportation fuel, or a chemical feedstock for other processes.
 Development of coproduction facilities was discussed only as
a future option.
<P>
<A NAME="4.6"><B>4.6 Capturing Legislative and Regulatory Incentives
</B></A>
<P>
The cofiring and niche opportunities described above may be
enhanced considerably by legislative and regulatory incentives
that encourage the use of renewable resources and resources that
have positive environmental attributes unlike conventional fuels.
 The picture for the biomass power industry is still somewhat
unclear, however.  For example, industry is generally aware of
the nature of the incentives provided under the recently-passed
Energy Policy Act of 1992, but is unsure of the direction of implementation.
 Thus, the influence of these factors can be potentially positive
for development of biopower projects, but may also lead to a 'wait
and see' approach that would postpone projects until a clear
direction for implementation is assured.  In addition, a number
of state organizations and utilities have instituted programs
that provide incentives for renewable technologies, and the Clean
Air Act Amendments also may provide for improved opportunities.
<P>
<B>Energy
Policy Act of 1992</B>
<P>
The Energy Policy Act of 1992 includes several
incentives for renewable energy power production, including a
renewable power production incentive (section 1212), a tax credit
for renewable energy electricity production (Section 1914), and
joint venture funds for renewable projects (Section 1201).  The
renewable energy production incentive provides for a payment from
DOE of 1.5 cents per kWh produced.  The coverage for this incentive,
however, is limited to plants with ownership by a governmental
entity (such as a state, political subdivision of a state, or
an instrumentality of a state) or a nonprofit electrical cooperative.
 The tax credit is to be part of the General Business Credit,
and applies only to qualified closed-loop biomass (and wind) plants,
and is set at a maximum of 1.5 cents per  kWh.  A closed-loop
biomass plant is defined as utilizing crops specifically grown
for fuel for an electricity plant.  The amount of the credit is
reduced if the average power purchase rates for biomass power
facilities exceed 8 cents per kWh or if there is federal or other
government cost sharing (grants, subsidies, etc.).  Both incentives
(sections 1212 and 1914) cover the first 10 years of the plant's
operation and are indexed for inflation.  A 1.5 cent per kWh production
incentive is equivalent to a $.90 - $1.25 /MMBTU subsidy for the
biomass fuel at a plant with heat rates ranging from 16,000 to
12,000 Btu/kWh.  This incentive could make a difference for marginal
projects.  The industry could easily see the benefits for project
development but seemed skeptical about being able to realize the
potential benefits.  Issues raised by the industry include:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>The law specifies that the credit applies to 'new facilities'
built after 1992.  Many of the real opportunities are repowering
or cofiring retrofit projects, which are, by definition, upgrades
to existing facilities.  As such, the law bypasses some of the
most realistic near-term opportunities available for biopower
development.
<P>
<LI>Early DFSS projects are likely to serve two markets
simultaneously: fiber and fuel.  Extension of the definition of
DFSS to cover these projects will increase the chances that DFSS
will be considered by plant developers.
</UL>
<P>
The renewable energy joint
ventures program seems particularly attractive to utilities or
project developers who are considering use of DFSS as a supplemental
fuel supply.  There is also interest in the use of joint venture
funds for both cofiring and gasification demonstrations.
<P>
<B>Externality
Valuation and Regulations</B>
<P>
Many jurisdictions of the U.S. are
giving consideration to the recognition of externalities in the
utility resource planning process.  The impetus for this consideration
comes from many sources, including implementation of the Clean
Air Act Amendments of 1990, state and local legislation/regulations,
and a number of other sources.  In addition, this recognition
comes in many forms, but there is no consensus concerning methodology
or the degree to which externalities should impact decision making.
 In its broadest sense, any credit or debit based on social or
environmental interests that is used to alter decisions that would
normally be based on a purely economic and technical risk assessment
serves as an externality.  An immediate example is the proposed
BTU tax, which provides a favorable treatment for biomass fuels
for power generation by exempting them from the tax. The biomass
IPP industry generally favors the use of externalities because
they believe that they will tend to favor renewable energy projects
and, more specifically, biomass fuels.  The utilities, on the
other hand, generally favor the traditional economic assessment
approach with qualitative consideration given to other factors.
 While some utilities are adamantly opposed to the quantitative
use of externalities, others have developed and used them in their
resource planning process.  Some examples include:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Vermont
has issued an executive order for 20% CO2 reduction for energy
uses and has instituted a renewable power purchase program.
<P>
<LI>Puget Power provides a 10% credit for renewable regeneration
sources in bidding.
<P>
<LI>Idaho offers 6.5 cents per kWh for renewable
generators less than 10 Mwe.
<P>
<LI>The CAAA have instituted allowance
trading for SO2 emissions.  The low sulfur content of biomass
fuels permits utilities to earn allowances when they substitute
biomass for coal fuels.

At
the level of current externality valuations, most in the industry
felt that the gap between biopower projects and gas turbine projects
could not be made up.  There is, however, a good deal of concern
about the possible imposition of carbon taxes or carbon limits.
 Most of the industry seemed to feel that this could make the
difference as long as the 'no net CO2' principle for
biomass is accepted.  Until the rules for valuing reduced CO2
emissions are in place, the industry has suggested that a systematic
approach for 'banking' credits for reductions would
provide some initial incentive for companies considering biomass
cofiring or repowering projects.  These early reductions would
be credited to the utilities' CO2 accounts pending the imposition
of caps and allowance trading.  Without such a system there will
be some inertia against reducing what may become the baseline
emissions under future regulation.
