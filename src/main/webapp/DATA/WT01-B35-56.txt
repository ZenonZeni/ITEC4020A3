<h3>10. Various Visitors </h3>
</center>

<hr>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The diverse aspects, the multi-faceted emanations
of LSD are also expressed in the variety of cultural circles with
which this substance has brought me into contact. On the
scientific plane, this has involved colleagues-chemists,
pharmacologists, physicians, and mycologists&#151;whom I met at
universities, congresses, lectures, or with whom I came into
association through publication. In the literary-philosophical
field there were contacts with writers. In the preceding chapters
I have reported on the relationships of this type that were most
significant for me. LSD also provided me with a variegated series
of personal acquaintances from the drug scene and from hippie
circles, which will briefly be described here. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Most of these visitors came from the United States
and were young people, often in transit to the Far East in search
of Eastern wisdom or of a guru; or else hoping to come by drugs
more easily there. Prague also was sometimes the goal, because
LSD of good quality could at the time easily be acquired there.
[Translator's Note: When Sandoz's patents on LSD expired in 1963,
the Czech pharmaceutical firm Spofa began to manufacture the
drug.] Once arrived in Europe, they wanted to take advantage of
the opportunity to see the father of LSD, &quot;the man who made
the famous LSD bicycle trip.&quot; But more serious concerns
sometimes motivated a visit. There was the desire to report on
personal LSD experiences and to debate the purport of their
meaning, at the source, so to speak. Only rarely did a visit
prove to be inspired by the desire to obtain LSD when a visitor
hinted that he or she wished once to experiment with most
assuredly pure material, with original LSD. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Visitors of various types and with diverse desires
also came from Switzerland and other European countries. Such
encounters have become rarer in recent times, which may be
related to the fact that LSD has become less important in the
drug scene. Whenever possible, I have welcomed such visitors or
agreed to meet somewhere. This I considered to be an obligation
connected with my role in the history of LSD, and I have tried to
help by instructing and advising. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Sometimes no true conversation occurred, for
example with the inhibited young man who arrived on a motorbike.
I was not clear about the objective of his visit. He stared at
me, as if asking himself: can the man who has made something so
weird as LSD really look so completely ordinary? With him, as
with other similar visitors, I had the feeling that he hoped, in
my presence, the LSD riddle would somehow solve itself. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Other meetings were completely different, like the
one with the young man from Toronto. He invited me to lunch at an
exclusive restaurant&#151;impressive appearance, tall, slender, a
businessman, proprietor of an important industrial firm in
Canada, brilliant intellect. He thanked me for the creation of
LSD, which had given his life another direction. He had been 100
percent a businessman, with a purely materialistic world view.
LSD had opened his eyes to the spiritual aspect of life. Now he
possessed a sense for art, literature, and philosophy and was
deeply concerned with religious and metaphysical questions. He
now desired to make the LSD experience accessible in a suitable
milieu to his young wife, and hoped for a similarly fortunate
transformation in her. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Not as profound, yet still liberating and
rewarding, were the results of LSD experiments which a young Dane
described to me with much humor and fantasy. He came from
California, where he had been a houseboy for Henry Miller in Big
Sur. He moved on to France with the plan of acquiring a
dilapidated farm there, which he, a skilled carpenter, then
wanted to restore himself. I asked him to obtain an autograph of
his former employer for my collection, and after some time I
actually received an original piece of writing from Henry
Miller's hand. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A young woman sought me out to report on LSD
experiences that had been of great significance to her inner
development. As a superficial teenager who pursued all sorts of
entertainments, and quite neglected by her parents, she had begun
to take LSD out of curiosity and love of adventure. For three
years she took frequent LSD trips. They led to an astonishing
intensification of her inner life. She began to seek after the
deeper meaning of her existence, which eventually revealed itself
to her. Then, recognizing that LSD had no further power to help
her, without difficulty or exertion of will she was able to
abandon the drug. Thereafter she was in a position to develop
herself further without artificial means. She was now a happy
intrinsically secure person&#151;thus she concluded her report.
This young woman had decided to tell me her history, because she
supposed that I was often attacked by narrow-minded persons who
saw only the damage that LSD sometimes caused among youths. The
immediate motive of her testimony was a conversation that she had
accidentally overheard on a railway journey. A man complained
about me, finding it disgraceful that I had spoken on the LSD
problem in an interview published in the newspaper. In his
opinion, I ought to denounce LSD as primarily the devil's work
and should publicly admit my guilt in the matter. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Persons in LSD delirium, whose condition could have
given rise to such indignant condemnation, have never personally
come into my sight. Such cases, attributable to LSD consumption
under irresponsible circumstances, to overdosage, or to psychotic
predisposition, always landed in the hospital or at the police
station. Great publicity always came their way. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A visit by one youn American girl stands out in my
memory as an example of the tragic effects of LSD. It was during
the lunch hour, which I normally spent in my office under strict
confinement&#151;no visitors, secretary's office closed up.
Knocking came at the door, discretely but firmly repeated, until
eventually I went to open.it. I scarcely believed my eyes: before
me stood a very beautiful young woman, blond, with large blue
eyes, wearing a long hippie dress, headband, and sandals. &quot;I
am Joan, I come from New York&#151;you are Dr. Hofmann?&quot;
Before I inquired what brought her to me, I asked her how she had
got through the two checkpoints, at the main entrance to the
factory area and at the door of the laboratory building, for
visitors were admitted only after telephone query, and this
flower child must have been especially noticeable. &quot;I am an
angel, I can pass everywhere,&quot; she replied. Then she
explained that she came on a great mission. She had to rescue her
country, the United States; above all she had to direct the
president (at the time L. B. Johnson) onto the correct path. This
could be accomplished only by having him take LSD. Then he would
receive the good ideas that would enable him to lead the country
out of war and internal difficulties. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Joan had come to me hoping that I would help her
fulfill her mission, namely to give LSD to the president. Her
name would indicate she was the Joan of Arc of the USA. I don't
know whether my arguments, advanced with all consideration of her
holy zeal, were able to convince her that her plan had no
prospects of success on psychological, technical, internal, and
external grounds. Disappointed and sad she went away. Next day I
received a telephone call from Joan. She again asked me to help
her, since her financial resources were exhausted. I took her to
a friend in Zurich who provided her with work, and with whom she
could live. Joan was a teacher by profession, and also a
nightclub pianist and singer. For a while she played and sang in
a fashionable Zurich restaurant. The good bourgeois clients of
course had no idea what sort of angel sat at the grand piano in a
black evening dress and entertained them with sensitive playing
and a soft and sensuous voice. Few paid attention to the words of
her songs; they were for the most part hippie songs, many of them
containing veiled praise of drugs. The Zurich performance did not
last long; within a few weeks I learned from my friend that Joan
had suddenly disappeared. He received a greeting card from her
three months later, from Israel. She had been committed to a
psychiatric hospital there. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For the conclusion of my assortment of LSD
visitors, I wish to report about a meeting in which LSD figured
only indirectly. Miss H. S., head secretary in a hospital, wrote
to ask me for a personal interview. She came to tea. She
explained her visit thus: in a report about an LSD experience,
she had read the description of a condition she herself had
experienced as a young girl, which still disturbed her today;
possibly I could help her to understand this experience. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; She had gone on a business trip as a commercial
apprentice. They spent the night in a mountain hotel. H. S. awoke
very early and left the house alone in order to watch the
sunrise. As the mountains began to light up in a sea of rays, she
was perfused by an unprecedented feeling of happiness, which
persisted even after she joined the other participants of the
trip at morning service in the chapel. During the Mass everything
appeared to her in a supernatural luster, and the feeling of
happiness intensified to such an extent that she had to cry
loudly. She was brought back to the hotel and treated as someone
with a mental disorder. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; This experience largely determined her later
personal life. H.S. feared she was not completely normal. On the
one hand, she feared this experience, which had been explained to
her as a nervous breakdown; on the other hand, she longed for
arepetitionof the condition. Internally split, she had led an
unstable life. In repeated vocational changes and in varying
personal relationships, consciously or unconsciously she again
sought this ecstatic outlook, which once made her so deeply
happy. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I was able to reassure my visitor. It was no
psychopathological event, no nervous breakdown that she had
experienced at the time. What many people seek to attain with the
help of LSD, the visionary experience of a deeper reality, had
come to her as spontaneous grace. I recommended a book by Aldous
Huxley to her, <i>The Perennial Philosophy</i> (Harper, New York
&amp; London, 1945) a collection of reports of spontaneous
blessed visions from all times and cultures. Huxley wrote that
not only mystics and saints, but also many more ordinary people
than one generally supposes, experience such blessed moments, but
that most do not recognize their importance and, instead of
regarding them as promising rays of hope, repress them, because
they do not fit into everyday rationality. </p>
