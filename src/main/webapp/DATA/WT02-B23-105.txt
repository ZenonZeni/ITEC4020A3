Three CompTIA Programs Make the 
'Associations Advance America' Honor Roll</STRONG></CENTER>
<PRE>
LOMBARD, Ill. — For the second year in a row, the Computing Technology 
Industry Association (CompTIA) has been elected to the 'Associations 
Advance America' Honor Roll for several of its outstanding programs.

The 'Associations Advance America' Awards, sponsored by the American 
Society of Association Executives (ASAE), recognize significant 
contributions made to society by associations in areas such as 
education, product and safety standards, codes of ethics, research 
and statistics, international activities and community service.

This year, CompTIA was recognized for its A+ Certification Program 
for computer service technicians, its Electronic Commerce (EDI/Bar Coding) 
efforts and the Association's Public Policy Education Program.

The A+ Certification Program sets industry standards through standardized, 
vendor-neutral testing of computer service technicians.  The multi-phase 
program benefits the computer industry by reducing the time and money 
technicians spend on vendor-required training.  In addition, corporate 
computing end users gain confidence in the service they receive from 
A+ Certified technicians.  More than 16,000 computer service technicians 
have become A+ Certified since the program was launched in July 1993.  
Solid proof that the A+ Certification program continues to gain momentum 
in the U.S. and Canada can also be found in the number of A+ Authorized 
Service Centers.  As of the end of July 1995, there were more than 1,110 
companies that showed their commitment to computer service excellence by 
becoming A+ Authorized Service Centers.  In order to be designated an 
A+ Authorized Service Center, an organization must have 50% or more of 
its computer service technicians become A+ Certified.

The Public Policy Education Program provides funds to brief legislators on 
how political issues affect the computer industry.  During the past year, 
CompTIA has been an active participant in a variety of discussions in the 
Congress and within various federal agencies concerning computer industry-
related issues, such as:  telecom reform, reform of FCC certification 
procedures, tax fairness, software with encryption capabilities, unfair 
competition, digital telephony, and a rating system for video and computer-
based software games.  Through these efforts, CompTIA has helped ensure 
that the effects of such legislation and regulations on computer industry 
manufacturers, distributors and resellers is well known.

Electronic Commerce is an essential element on today's business landscape. 
Electronic data interchange (EDI), a niche of electronic commerce, is the 
electronic transfer of data in a standardized format between dissimilar 
computer systems. It replaces paper, fax and phone transactions. Among its 
benefits are:  inventory tracking; elimination of the need to reprocess or 
re-enter data; paperwork, errors and delay can be eliminated; overhead 
costs can be reduced; sales may increase; and efficiency, convenience and 
accuracy can be greatly increased. EDI can be a critical factor in 
establishing the competitive advantage of one company over another in the 
same field. 

During the past three years, CompTIA has been instrumental in bringing 
electronic commerce to the computer industry. The Association took it to 
a global level this past March at CompTIA's first International EDI meeting 
in Paris where North American and European computing technology business 
partners were given an opportunity to better understand how to take EDI 
initiatives beyond their own borders.

For more information on CompTIA programs or the Association's member 
benefits and services, call Terri Baron at (708) 268-1818, ext. 312.

The Computing Technology Industry Association (formerly ABCD: The 
Microcomputer Industry Association) is a national not-for-profit 
association of more than 6,150 microcomputer resellers, manufacturers, 
software publishers, distributors and service companies. Its mission is to 
foster high levels of professional competence and business ethics among 
its members and the computer industry. Combined sales of CompTIA members 
account for 62% of all microcomputer sales in North America.

Do you know an individual or company in the computer industry who 'just 
does it' or who 'makes it happen'?  A person or an organization you 
would nominate for the Computer Industry Awards of Excellence?

For the first time in 1995,  the Computing Technology Industry 
Association (CompTIA) established a program to honor those organizations 
and individuals who have made outstanding contributions to the computer 
industry.  The following awards categories recognize companies and/or 
individuals whose primary business focus is related to the computing and 
information technologies industry:

1)	Manufacturer of computer hardware, software and related products 
	(Gold award);

2)	Distributor/aggregator/franchisor (Gold award);

3)	Computer reseller/VAR/VAD/Systems Integrator (Gold and silver awards).

Criteria by which the nominees are judged:

a)	Active participation in the development of the Association (CompTIA) 
	and/or active participation in its various programs or adoption and 
	use of voluntary standards, such as:  A+ Certification for computer 
	service technicians, Voluntary Product Returns Guidelines or the 
	streamlined Co-op/MDF process including the Marketing Expenditure 
	Agreement Letter (MEAL), Electronic Commerce standards and 
	transaction sets, etc.

b)	Innovation in new products, technologies and/or the discovery of 
	unique client-market niches.

c)	A proven track record of customer satisfaction as evidenced by 
	client testimonials, awards, etc.

d)	Participation locally or nationally in the business community, 
	educational institutions, and/or industry affairs that helped 
	create an awareness and enhancement of the stature of the computing 
	industry.

e)	Unique and significant company success and growth as measured by 
	revenues, number of employees, return on investment and/or 
	profits during the past five (5) years.

The winners of these four prestigious awards are announced and 
congratulated at the industry's premier channel event – CompTIA's 
Breakaway Conference – which was held this year from August 26-29 
at the New Orleans (LA) Hilton Riverside Hotel.
