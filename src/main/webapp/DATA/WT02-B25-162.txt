<P>
<H4>HUD's Reports Significantly Understate The Housing Needs Of People With Disabilities</H4>
<P>

<P>Unfortunately, during this time when people with disabilities are experiencing an increasingly acute housing crisis, the federal government has not accurately quantified their housing needs.  Nor has the federal government made a good faith effort to compare the housing needs of people with disabilities with the housing needs of elderly households.  This comparison is important because elderly households will now have access to more federally subsidized housing units because of "elderly only" designated housing policies.  The lack of accurate information on the relative housing needs of these two population groups is due to the flawed methodology currently used by HUD to collect housing needs data for people with disabilities -- a methodology which has the effect of discriminating against non-elderly people with disabilities because it results in a significant under-reporting of their actual housing needs.

<P>Every other year, HUD issues a <I>Worst Case Housing Needs Report</I> to the Congress documenting the magnitude and trends in worst case housing needs among very low income households, categorized as families with children, elderly households, and disabled households.  Households are considered to have worst case housing needs if they are very low income (below 50% of median income) and if they are either (1) paying more than 50% of their income for rent, or (2) living in severely substandard quality rental housing.  HUD's <I>Worst Case Housing Needs Report</I> highlights, for the Congress, the implications of federal housing policies and specific legislative proposals and are often cited as federal housing policy and funding decisions are made.

<P>The findings contained in HUD's  <I>Worst Case Housing Needs Report</I> have potentially greater significance for people with disabilities given the enactment and implementation of "elderly only" designated housing policies.  Unfortunately, both the <I>1994 and 1996 Worst Case Housing Needs Reports</I> prepared by HUD are flawed and significantly understate the number of people with disabilities who may have worst case housing needs.  

<P>The <I>1994 Worst Case Housing Needs Report </I>relied exclusively on data collected through the American Housing Survey (AHS), a face to face survey of current renters conducted for HUD by the Bureau of the Census.  This methodology is obviously not a valid approach to accurately assess the housing needs of people with disabilities,  many of whom are not current renters and whose housing history may be one of living in institutions, congregate or group settings, or with family during their adult years.  The fact that the AHS considers only current renters means that people with disabilities are seriously undercounted, and that their particular housing circumstances are not taken into consideration in HUD's methodology.  To illustrate, the 1994 HUD report was based solely on a universe of 532,000 people with disabilities who were believed to be in the rental market, even though over 4 million adults of all ages with a disability were receiving SSI benefits at that time.

<P>In the <I>1996 Worst Case Housing Needs Report</I> issued in March, HUD discussed relying on incomplete data for people with disabilities from the AHS, admitting that the AHS does not even ask any questions related to disability.  Nevertheless, HUD continued to highlight AHS-based data on the housing needs of people with disabilities in key sections of the 1996 report.  Because of this lack of accurate data, HUD also incorporated a separate data extract from the Social Security Administration (SSA) in the 1996 report which was based on a random audit of 5,000 SSI recipients in 1994.  While the SSA data extract clearly demonstrates the complete inadequacy of AHS data, it was never designed as a tool to measure housing needs.  For example, it specifically excluded people with disabilities in certain settings, such as community residences, residential care facilities, institutions, treatment facilities, educational/vocational training settings, and emergency shelters.

<P>The table below illustrates the discrepancies in recent HUD estimates of the housing needs of people with disabilities:

<h4>CCD Housing Task Force Estimates Of Worst Case Housing Need</h4>

<P>Because of the undercounting of people with disabilities in HUD's reports, the CCD Housing Task Force has collected and analyzed data which provides a more accurate estimate of the number of people with disabilities currently experiencing an acute housing crisis.  

<P>The CCD Housing Task Force estimates that approximately 1.8 million people with disabilities receiving SSI benefits may have acute housing problems.  This estimate is 10 times greater than HUD's AHS 1996 estimate and twice the estimate HUD derived from the SSA audit data.  Significantly, this CCD estimate of housing needs still does not include any people with disabilities with income from sources other than SSI who may also be eligible for HUD assistance.  If these households were included, the total number of people with disabilities with worst case housing needs would undoubtedly increase.

<P>The chart below contrasts CCD estimates of the housing needs of people with disabilities with HUD's AHS estimate contained in the <I>1996 Worst Case Housing Needs Report</I>.

<P>The CCD Housing Task Force bases its estimate of worst case housing needs on:<P>
<ol>
<li>Generalizable data contained in HUD's 1996 report; 
<P>
<LI>A 1995 Social Security Administration report on all individuals receiving SSI benefits; and 
<P>
<LI>Information obtained from a national study of SSI income levels undertaken in 1992 entitled "A National Study of Housing Affordability for Recipients of Supplemental Security Income."<P>
</OL>
<P>The SSI income study, which was published in the May 1993 <I>Journal of Hospital and Community Psychiatry</I>, documented that, on average, SSI income levels nationally were equivalent to 23.85% of the median one person household income.  Based on this finding, all adults receiving SSI under age 62 are income eligible for HUD assistance and should be considered in a worst case housing needs assessment. 
<P>

<P>The CCD Housing Task Force used an SSA report published in the fall of 1995 to calculate that there are approximately 3,125,000 adults with disabilities <I>under age 62 </I> who receive SSI benefits. HUD's <I>1996 Worst Case Housing Needs Report</I> states that approximately 70% of unassisted households with incomes below 30% of area median have worst case housing needs.  Therefore 70% of people with disabilities receiving SSI can be considered to have worst case housing needs, except for those already receiving HUD assistance.

<P>HUD's own tenant data used in the 1996 report indicates that 565,000 adults with disabilities under age 62 are currently receiving HUD assistance.  CCD excluded all of these households and then calculated that 1,792,500 people with disabilities (70% of unassisted adult SSI recipients under age 62) have worst case housing needs.  Again, it is important to note that this is an SSI-based estimate and does not include other very low income people with disabilities with other sources of income.  When data is available on these individuals, the total estimate of worst case housing needs among people with disabilities will undoubtedly be higher.

<P>
<h4>The Housing Needs Of Elderly Households And Disabled Households</H4>
<P>The outcome of federal "elderly only" designated housing policies is that the supply of subsidized housing for people with disabilities will decline dramatically.  This decline directly benefits elderly households that will have exclusive access to the subsidized housing units no longer available to people with disabilities.  Given these housing supply dynamics, it is important to compare the housing needs of both groups, and their relative access to existing federally subsidized housing.  This information can then be used to guide federal housing policy and the future allocation of very limited federal housing resources.

<P>Unfortunately, HUD's <I>1996 Worst Case Housing Needs Report</I> is both confusing and misleading when trying to compare the relative housing needs of very low income elderly and disabled households.  By selectively using AHS data and SSA audit data on individuals receiving SSI,  HUD's report both <I>understates</I> the housing needs of people with disabilities using AHS data and <I>overstates</I> their use of federal housing assistance by relying on the SSA data extract.
<P>

<P>The CCD Housing Task Force has used its more accurate estimate of worst case housing needs among people with disabilities and HUD estimates of worst case housing needs of elderly households to begin to evaluate the impact of designated housing policies.  HUD data is used to illustrate the number of households receiving HUD assistance.

* <fontsize=-1> Only individuals receiving SSI</fontsize>


<P>CCD data indicates that 56% of people with disabilities on SSI have worst case housing needs, as compared to only 34% of very low income elderly households.  This chart also illustrates that elderly households currently benefit much more from federal housing assistance.  According to HUD's own occupancy data for 1995,  33% of very low income elderly households currently receive HUD assistance as compared to only 14% of people with disabilities living on SSI.   Significantly, HUD's <I>1996 Worst Case Housing Needs Report</I>  comments on the housing needs of people with disabilities, stating  that, "persons with disabilities living alone are consistently more likely than other worst case household types to have multiple housing problems because they frequently pay more than half their income for severely or moderately inadequate housing."  The 1996 HUD Report also comments on the housing needs of elderly households stating that, "strong targeting of housing assistance to the elderly and the protection from declines in real income enjoyed by many of these elderly (e.g. indexing of Social Security, SSI, and other pensions) have kept down the growth in worst case needs among the elderly."    

<P>In conclusion, it is clear that HUD has not made a meaningful effort to accurately assess the housing needs of people with disabilities, despite having been directed by the Congress to do so in section 661 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992.  The CCD Housing Task Force believes that HUD must develop more accurate methods of assessing the housing needs of people with disabilities -- methods which take into consideration their unique housing circumstances.   The CCD Housing Task Force assessment indicates that people with disabilities have a much higher rate of worst case housing needs, yet elderly households benefit much more from federal housing programs.  This disproportionate balance between housing needs and allocation of resources is a serious housing issue that must be addressed by federal housing policy makers as designated housing policies are implemented by public and assisted housing providers.
