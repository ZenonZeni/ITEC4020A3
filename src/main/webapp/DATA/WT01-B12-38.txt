 <IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> SPECIFIC SUPPORT </H2>

<P>  SUPPORT TABS is one of the leading Life Plus products.  The original research this great formula is based on was completed at Rutgers University. The goal was to understand specific support needed by alcoholics because of the damage done to specific organs in their bodies by the excessive use of alcohol.</P>
<P>   Alcoholics are all hypoglycemic, a condition that is characterized by wide and varied blood sugar levels. Millions of Americans are affected by this condition to some degree. Our blood sugar levels fluctuate normally within a limited range, but problems can develop if those levels change too rapidly or if they get too high or too low.  When they are too high for extended periods of time, diabetes is the result. If the levels become too low, a condition known as hypoglycemia can cause problems.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> BLOOD SUGAR LEVELS</H2>
<P>  Carbohydrates   stimulate   the   pancreas   to produce insulin. Insulin transfers sugar out of the blood into the cells, where it is used for energy. The chronic eating of too much refined carbohydrate such as sugar over-sensitizes the pancreas and after a time it begins to over react to sugar in the diet.  The pancreas then produces too much insulin and blood sugar levels fall too low.   People then get the "blahs" and eat more sugar-containing foods to overcome the slump.  The pancreas over reacts again with too much insulin and the "blahs" strike again.   This condition is called hypoglycemia.</P>
<P>  The  cycle  continues  until  eventually  the pancreas  becomes  exhausted  and  can  hardly produce any insulin at all. This condition then becomes diabetes.</P>
<P>  The adrenal glands also stimulate the pancreas to produce insulin. Caffeine and nicotine stress out and exhaust the adrenals in a similar way. This aggravates hypoglycemia just like eating too much sugar.</P>
<P>  SUPPORT TABS nutritionally support the pancreas, pituitary, liver, adrenals, hypothalamus and the whole body as well. The hypothalamus has long been known to be involved in most habit forming processes in the body and needs special nutritional support when trying to break habits.</P>
 <P> Much research has been done more recently at MIT on "carbohydrate hunger."  They have proven that Seratonin production in the brain is increased when increased levels of the amino acid, L-Tryptophan, get
into the brain. When enough Seratonin is produced, carbohydrate hunger increases.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> AMINO ACIDS</H2>
<P>  SUPPORT TABS contain amino acids associated with the metabolic pathways of L-Tryptophan in the brain. Even though most people notice an energy boost when they take SUPPORT TABS, about 3% notice a feeling of relaxation, rather than increased energy.  A reaction of this type should be considered positive.</P>
<P>  L-Glutamine is considered to be helpful in mental alertness.   Vitamins B-l, B-2 and B-6 are included because they assist in the burning of glucose, which produces energy. However, the typical large amounts of B-vitamins, usually contained in stress formulas, are intentionally not included in SUPPORT TABS as they would cause the body to burn too much blood sugar quickly.   Mega-doses of B-vitamins give temporary energy, but once the sugar is burned, the same hypoglycemic "blahs" return in full force.  Thus, SUPPORT TABS contain a reasonable amount of B-vitamins to support the process naturally without creating a false stimulant effect that ultimately does more harm than good.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> PHYTOZYME BASE</H2>
<P>  SUPPORT TABS are formulated in the proprietary Life Plus PhytoZyme base, which contains a unique blend of over thirty natural concentrates of numerous valuable phytonutrients from plants.
  When you take Life Plus products, you have the added benefit of receiving the numerous health supporting phytochemicals and other micronutrients contained in them.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HOW TO TAKE THEM</H2>
<P>   It  is  difficult to  say  exactly  how  one  should  take SUPPORT TABS as we all have different needs at different times. For best results, we recommend that you experiment.  Take at least three tablets per day. The general recommendation is three tablets two times per day, usually three early to mid afternoon and three in the late afternoon or evening.   Some people also prefer taking them in the morning. An ideal regimen is to take<A HREF="mcardio.htm"> CARDIO-CHELEX</A>  in the morning and SUPPORT TABS in the afternoon.</P>


<P>
Suggested Use:  Three tablets once or twice a day for energy and to fight stress or when trying to break 
habits such as overeating, smoking, etc. They are also useful in athletic programs.</P>
