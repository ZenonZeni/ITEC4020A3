<pre><b>NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF SENTENCING ADVOCATES
DRUG AND ALCOHOL TREATMENT OPTIONS
By Sharon Caulum
Client Service Director

</b></pre>

<hr>

<p>Our clients are often sent to prison to receive drug and
alcohol treatment. Sentencing advocates need to be aware of
treatment options in the community in order to argue persuasively
that such clients can be effectively treated outside of prison.
This article will describe both traditional and non-traditional
drug treatment and how sentencing advocates can develop plans
which include community-based treatment.<br>
Community-based treatment may use the following methods:
therapeutic interventions, support groups,
detoxification/emergency treatment, pharmacologic assistance,
acupuncture or homeopathic therapy. The settings for treatment
are outpatient, day treatment, in-patient, residential, or
therapeutic community. <br>
<b>Methods of Treatment<br>
</b>Therapeutic intervention includes individual or group
counseling and psychotherapy, and treatment is usually provided
by trained therapists. Most therapeutic intervention programs
rely on cognitive-based therapy which addresses irrational
thinking and attempts to restructure thought processes.<br>
Support groups are usually conducted by a member of the group
with the assistance of prepared materials by a national
organization. The most well known support groups are Alcoholics
Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous. Most support groups are
modeled on the Twelve Steps of AA and rely on faith in a
&quot;higher power&quot; to assist in achieving goals.<br>
Detoxification treatment is a program of planned withdrawal which
may or may not include medication to assist in withdrawal. Length
of detoxification depends on the substance ingested and the
methods used for detoxification. Detoxification without other
treatment has not been found to be effective in maintaining
sobriety. <br>
Acupuncture is gaining in popularity as a treatment for
addictions. In addition to its use in community-based treatment
programs, more than 500 inmates are taking acupuncture treatments
around the country each day. For substance abusers, the process
involves inserting three to five needles into precise points of
the outer ear just beneath the skin for <br>

about 45 minutes while the patient sits in a chair. The needles
signal neurotransmitters that release natural pain relieving
endorphines which reduce cravings for drugs or alcohol and help
calm the patient. Some programs use acupuncture in combination
with other traditional forms of addiction treatment. <br>
Examples of pharmacological medications which are used to treat
addictions are disulfiram, methadone, and ibogaine. Disulfiram,
which is more commonly known by its trade name, Antabuse, is
taken daily by mouth to deter the consumption of alcohol by
causing severe but temporary discomfort when combined with
alcohol. Symptoms include weakness, vertigo, decrease in blood
pressure, throbbing head and neck, flushing of the face, chest
pain, labored breathing, nausea and vomiting. For most people,
the threat of such a noxious reaction is enough to deter alcohol
consumption. Disulfiram therapy is usually used in combination
with a comprehensive treatment program. Calcium carbimide,
marketed under the trade name Temposil, is also used as an
alcohol deterrent.<br>
Methadone is a narcotic analgesic similar in potency to morphine.
Under a special license, some treatment facilities provide drug
dependent persons with methadone as a substitute for heroin,
morphine, or exycodone (Percodan). Initially, daily dosages of
methadone are gradually increased until a stabilization dose
level is achieved. Users are maintained on the stabilized dose
for an extended period of time. The eventual goal of many
methadone programs is to decrease the daily dosage of methadone
to help the dependent person achieve a drug-free state without
suffering the distress of abrupt withdrawal. For most users,
methadone suppresses withdrawal symptoms and the chronic
&quot;drug hunger&quot; for other narcotics without renewing
euphoria. Nausea and vomiting are common side effects and must be
endured until tolerance is developed. Constipation and physical
dependence on the drug are chronic, long term side effects.<br>
Ibogaine is a naturally-occurring hallucinogenic alkaloid which
comes from the roots of a West African plant. Ibogaine has
received some media attention recently for its use in controlling
addiction to cocaine. Critics of its therapeutic use point out
that ibogaine is a hallucinogenic which produces early effects of
nausea, vomiting, sweating, weakness, dizziness, tremors, and
numbness. Users then become physically relaxed and tend to lose
interest completely in their surroundings. They experience long
dreamlike sequences of vivid images and fantasies, dominated by
specific intense colors. The duration of the hallucinogenic
activity is approximately six hours. <br>
Proponents of ibogaine's therapeutic use point to the user's
decrease in intense craving for cocaine. Some users of ibogaine
assert that their dependency on crack is based on their inability
to control their craving. By substituting ibogaine for crack,
they are able to control their crack use and are able to
re-establish productive lives. Another medication used to reduce
cocaine craving is Bromocriptine (Parlodel), a drug used to treat
Parkinson's disease. Bromocriptine mimics the action of dopamine
by stimulating dopamine receptors. This may lead to reduced
craving for cocaine. Anti-depressants have also been used with
some limited success to treat the craving for cocaine.
Pharmacologic approaches are almost always used in conjunction
with other forms of drug treatment. <br>
Homeopathic treatment for drug and alcohol abuse is provided
under the care of a homeopath physician or practitioner.
Homeopathy and naturopathy medicine rely on natural treatment
remedies such as herbs, along with diet and massage, to achieve
chemical balance in the body. Most homeopath physicians have
doctor of medicine degrees. Naturopathic physicians are not
medical doctors, but have a doctorate in naturopathy. A listing
of homeopath physicians is found in the yellow pages under
&quot;Homeopaths.&quot; Not all homeopath physicians treat
alcohol and drug dependence.<br>
<b>Treatment Plans<br>
</b>The best treatment for one client may differ from the
treatment intervention for another. The type of drug, the
client's background, length of abuse, motivation for treatment,
environment and social support play a part in determining the
most appropriate treatment intervention.<br>
When treatment is part of your sentencing proposal, advocates
should make the treatment referral as early as possible.
Sometimes, early intervention can be used as an indicator of <br>
the client's motivation for change. In addition, if the treatment
staff have some history with the client, they may provide
testimony on the progress of the client's treatment at the
sentencing hearing. Early referrals also help address the problem
of lengthy waiting lists. <br>
Some treatment agencies will not interview clients in the jail.
Defense attorneys sometimes file a motion with the court asking
that the client be released to go to an agency for an assessment
interview. Another option used by sentencing advocates is to find
a person who will go to the jail to provide assessment. At the
sentencing hearing, the attorney provides this information which
shows that if the client was assessed, he or she would likely be
accepted into the treatment program.<br>
If sentencing advocates use treatment agency personnel who are
not familiar with the interview practices in the jail, they
should provide the interviewer with information such as what
identification to bring, whether the interview can be arranged
with direct contact with the inmate, and a copy of the jail
rules, including time restrictions on jail visits. It is good
practice to provide the jail with written notification of the
interview. Some jails require a background check of the
interviewer to be completed prior to a professional contact
visit.<br>
In some cases, sentencing advocates provide probation and parole
agents with information about their referrals to treatment
agencies. Frequently, agents do not have the time or interest in
referring clients to programs; however, they are often not
opposed to others making referrals. Sentencing advocates'
treatment plans are more likely to be accepted if they have joint
agreement between the defense and probation agents. <br>
In some cases, probation officers are opposed to a
community-based treatment plan, and they will not facilitate the
referral. In these cases, sentencing advocates should make the
referral themselves if the agency will accept the client, or ask
the defense attorney to bring a motion before the judge to order
the probation officer to make a referral.<br>
<b>Funding Sources<br>
</b>Funding for alcohol and drug treatment comes from a variety
of sources, including government, donations, insurance, private
pay, and gambling revenues. Some state and federal funding for
treatment is funneled through state agencies and then dispersed
to the local level.<br>
Other sources of governmental funding for treatment are Title 19
(Medicaid), veteran benefits, Treatment Alternatives to Street
Crime (TASC) grants, and legislatively-mandated specific
appropriations. Sentencing advocates should find out if their
clients have Title 19 or veteran benefits. If they have or
qualify for veteran benefits, they may refer their clients to the
county veteran service office which will provide information on
local services. If clients have Title 19, sentencing advocates
may refer clients to private service providers, or any agency
which accepted Title 19 funding. <br>
Frequently, your Department of Corrections (or Probation
Department) also has funds to purchase treatment services. When
using this source of funds, the agent preparing the presentence
report or the parole agent is usually required to make a formal
referral. Sentencing advocates may encourage agents to make
referrals for treatment by making the initial contact themselves
to treatment agencies, and providing information to the agent
about the feasibility of acceptance. Occasionally, staff of
treatment agencies will contact the agent, and encourage the
agent to make the referral. <br>
Donations are used to augment funding for non-profit agencies
such as United Way. Often, services in United Way agencies are
provided on a sliding-scale fee basis. Donations, usually from
the participants, are used to fund support groups.<br>
Funds for treatment are often provided by an insurance carrier.
In addition to insurance provided through employment or school,
Health Maintenance Organizations (HMO) insurance may be purchased
by counties for persons on general assistance. As part of the
contract, some HMO's provide treatment for persons receiving
general assistance. <br>
Gambling revenues are providing new sources of income for Indiana
tribes. Most tribes provide treatment for their members.<br>
<b>Effectiveness of Treatment<br>
</b>Studies conducted in the last fifteen years show that drug
treatment is effective in reducing drug abuse, increasing
employment, improving psychological adjustment, and decreasing
crime. The most persuasive evidence of the effectiveness of
treatment is found in the results of the Treatment Outcome
Prospective Study (TOPS). See Robert L. Hubbard, et.al., <b>Drug
Abuse Treatment: A National Study of Effectiveness</b> (Chapel
Hill, NC: U of North Carolina Press, 1989).<br>
TOPS studied 10,000 individuals admitted to 37 programs in 10
cities. They found that &quot;drug abuse treatment has been
notably effective in reducing drug abuse up to five years after a
single treatment episode.&quot; The study also reported, &quot;By
serving as an alternative to incarceration, treatment can be
particularly beneficial for drug abusers identified in jails or
prisons, and it can play a central role in combating the spread
of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) by reducing the
intravenous use of heroin and other drugs.&quot; The TOPS study
also found that legal pressure tended to keep people in treatment
for longer periods and that this coercion did not interfere with
treatment goals. <br>
The potential for reducing criminal behavior is one of the most
compelling reasons in favor of drug treatment. The TOPS study
found that &quot;three to five years after leaving treatment, the
proportion of clients who were involved in predatory crimes was
one-third to one-half of the pretreatment proportion.&quot; <br>
