CPSR Clipper Petition /rsp to Denning
Dave, <p>

Nice to see you in SF. <p>

I hear that you circulated Dorothy's comments on the
CPSR Clipper petition to Interesting People.  How
about circulating the response? <p>

Thanks, <p>

Marc. <p>

<hr> <p>

Dorothy Denning has raised important questions about the Clipper proposal.
As she says "the issues are extremely complex and difficult." Below I've
tried to answer the points she has raised.  Please read her comments and my
response.  Speak with others interested in the Clipper proposal.  If on
balance, after reviewing the arguments, you decide Clipper is a mistake
then you should express your opposition by sending a message to: <p>

CLIPPER.PETITION@CPSR.ORG <p>

with the words <p>

"I oppose Clipper" <p>

in the subject header.  If you have already signed the petition, ask a
friend or colleague to sign. <p>

Your help is needed. <p>

Marc Rotenberg, director, CPSR Washington office <p>

&gt;&gt;  The Clipper proposal, developed in secret by the
&gt;&gt;  National Security Agency, is a technical standard
&gt;&gt;  that will make it easier for government agents to
&gt;&gt;  wiretap the emerging data highway. <p>

&gt;  The standard (FIPS 185) is not a standard for the
&gt;  Internet or any other high speed computer network.  It
&gt;  is for the telephone system. <p>

The letter to the President makes clear that we are concerned about
"Clipper and associated standards" which include the Capstone EES
configuration for data transmission. <p>

It is clearly the intent of the EES proposal to cover both voice and data
transmissions. <p>

&gt;  The standard will not make it any easier to tap phones,
&gt;  let alone computer networks.  All it will do is make it
&gt;  technically possible to decrypt communications that are
&gt;  encrypted with the standard, assuming the communications
&gt;  are not superencrypted with something else. <p>

This is a little bit like saying that leaving a master key for every house
on your block with the police will not make it easier for the police to
open locked doors. <p>

We may disagree about whether this is a good idea, but let's be clear about
the intent of the proposal. <p>

&gt;  The purpose of the standard is to provide a very strong
&gt;  encryption algorithm - something much stronger than DES
&gt;  - and to do so in a way that does not thwart law
&gt;  enforcement and national security objectives.  Keys are
&gt;  escrowed so that if someone uses this technology, they
&gt;  cannot use it against national interests. <p>

The NSA is responsible for foreign signal interception.  It has no legal
authority to conduct wire surveillance.  What are the NSA's "national
security" interests in domestic wire surveillance? <p>

&gt;&gt;  Industry groups, professional associations and
&gt;&gt;  civil liberties organizations have expressed almost
&gt;&gt;  unanimous opposition to the plan since it was first
&gt;&gt;  proposed in April 1993. <p>

&gt;&gt;  The private sector and the public have expressed
&gt;&gt;  nearly unanimous opposition to Clipper. <p>

&gt;  As near as I know, neither CPSR nor any other group has
&gt;  conducted any systematic poll of industry, professional
&gt;  societies, or the public. <p>

To the best of my knowledge, there has never been a proposed technical
standard that generated more opposition.  Firms across the
telecommunications and computer industry oppose Clipper.  Computer security
people and cryptographers oppose Clipper.  Privacy experts oppose Clipper. <p>

&gt;&gt;  The Administration ignored the overwhelming
&gt;&gt;  opposition of the general public. When the Commerce
&gt;&gt;  Department solicited public comments on the
&gt;&gt;  proposal last fall, hundreds of people opposed the
&gt;  plan while only a few expressed support. <p>

&gt;  Hundreds of people is hardly overwhelming in a
&gt;  population of 250 million, especially when most of the
&gt;  letters were the same and came in through the net
&gt;  following a sample letter that was sent out. <p>

I would encourage Dorothy, or anyone else, to take a poll of any
representative user group -- Interesting People perhaps -- if there
is any doubt about how the public feels about the proposal. <p>

&gt;&gt;  The technical standard is subject to misuse and
&gt;&gt;  compromise. It would provide government agents with
&gt;&gt;  copies of the keys that protect electronic
&gt;&gt;  communications. "It is a nightmare for computer
&gt;&gt;  security." <p>

&gt;  I have been one of the reviewers of the standard.  We
&gt;  have completed our review of the encryption algorithm,
&gt;  SKIPJACK, and concluded it was very strong.  While we
&gt;  have not completed our review of the key escrow system,
&gt;  from what I have seen so far, I anticipate that it will
&gt;  provide an extremely high level of security for the
&gt;  escrowed keys. <p>

Dorothy endorsed the proposal before she joined the "review" team.  The
group that she refers to, a White House task force, has an interesting
history.  The majority of cryptographers asked to participate declined. <p>

&gt;&gt;  The underlying technology was developed in secret
&gt;&gt;  by the NSA, an intelligence agency responsible for
&gt;&gt;  electronic eavesdropping, not privacy protection.
&gt;&gt;  Congressional investigations in the 1970s disclosed
&gt;&gt;  widespread NSA abuses, including the illegal
&gt;&gt;  interception of millions of cables sent by American
&gt;&gt;  citizens. <p>

&gt;  NSA is also responsible for the development of
&gt;  cryptographic codes to protect the nation's most
&gt;  sensitive classified information.  They have an
&gt;  excellent track record in conducting this mission. <p>

Senator Frank Church, who conducted the most extensive hearings ever held
on the National Security Agency, said that the NSA's intelligence gathering
capabilities were important for the security of the United States.  He also
said that the massive eavesdropping capability created "A tremendous
potential for abuse." If ever turned against the communications system of
the United States: <p>

no American would have any privacy left . . . there
  would be no place to hide. <p>

We must see to it that this agency and all agencies
  that possess this technology operate within the law and
  under proper supervision, so that we never cross
  over that abyss.  That is an abyss from which there
  is no return. " (NBC Meet the Press, 1975) <p>

&gt;&gt;  Computer security experts question the integrity of
&gt;&gt; the technology. Clipper was developed in secret and
&gt;&gt;  its specifications are classified. <p>

&gt;  The 5 of us who reviewed the algorithm unanimously
&gt;  agreed that it was very strong.  We will publish a final
&gt;  report when we complete or full evaluation. Nothing can
&gt;  be concluded from a statement questioning the technology
&gt;  by someone who has not seen it regardless of whether
&gt;  that person is an expert in security. <p>

The original CPSR letter to the President, asking for the withdrawal of
Clipper, was signed by Hellman, Rivest, Diffie, Merkle, and others.  Many
more experts are adding their names daily to the CPSR petition. <p>

&gt;&gt;  NSA overstepped its legal authority in developing
&gt;&gt;  the standard.  A 1987 law explicitly limits the
&gt;&gt;  intelligence agency's power to set standards for
&gt;&gt;  the nation's communications network. <p>

&gt;  The 1987 Computer Security Act states that NIST "shall
&gt;  draw on the technical advice and assistance (including
&gt;  work products) of the National Security Agency." <p>

The original replacement for DES, proposed by the Department of Commerce in
1989, would have had these characteristics: <p>

-- public, unclassified
-- implementable in both hardware or software
-- usable by federal Agencies and U.S. based multi-national corporation
-- a level of security sufficient for the protection of unclassified,
   sensitive information and commercial propriety and/or valuable
information. <p>

The final proposal, developed with the "technical assistance" of the NSA,
has these characteristics. <p>

-- The Clipper algorithm Skipjack is classified
-- Public access to the reasons underlying the proposal is restricted
-- Skipjack can be implemented only in tamper-proof hardware
-- It will not be used by multi-national corporations
-- The security of the configuration remains unproven. <p>

The Computer Security Act was passed precisely because the NSA tried
previously to grab civilian computer security turf.  The law was
specifically intended to control the type of abuse that results from secret
standard-setting arrangements. <p>

If there any doubt among Interesting People about the illegal activities of
the NSA in the development of the EES, please consult the minutes of the
NSA/NIST Technical Working Group (TWG) that produced the standard.  The
minutes should be available from the National Security Agency Public
Information Office.  That phone number is 301/688-6524. <p>

&gt;&gt;  There is no evidence to support law enforcement's
&gt;&gt;  claims that new technologies are hampering criminal
&gt;&gt;  investigations. CPSR recently forced the release of
&gt;&gt;  FBI documents that show no such problems. <p>

&gt;  CPSR obtained some documents from a few FBI field
&gt;  offices.  Those offices reported no problems.  CPSR did
&gt;  not get reports from all field offices and did not get
&gt;  reports from local law enforcement agencies.  I can tell
&gt;  you that it is a fact that new communications
&gt;  technologies, including encryption, have hampered
&gt;  criminal investigations. <p>

The statement is illogical.  There is still no evidence to support the FBI's
claims. <p>

The FBI made certain claims that cryptography was impeding criminal
investigation conducted by wiretap.  CPSR investigated the FBI's claims by
filing a Freedom of Information Act suit to obtain the relevant documents.
The documents provided to us by the Department of Justice revealed that
none of the FBI field officers had encountered any obstacles.  The
Department of Justice has just informed us that they provided to us all
relevant documents concerning the Clipper proposal. <p>

There is one reported case where cryptography made it difficult for law
enforcement to obtain evidence. That case concerned reading the contents of
a file on a hard disk after it was seized. <p>

If this is the problem that the Clipper proposal is intended to solve, then
the key escrow scheme must be extended to every single encrypted file -- not
just encrypted communications -- everywhere in the world. <p>

Every encrypted file. Everywhere. <p>

&gt;&gt;  If the plan goes forward, commercial firms that
&gt;&gt;  hope to develop new products will face extensive
&gt;&gt;  government obstacles. Cryptographers who wish to
&gt;&gt;  develop new privacy enhancing technologies will be
&gt;&gt;  discouraged. <p>

&gt;  The standard is voluntary -- even for the government. <p>

An FBI legislative proposal now under consideration at the White House
would mandate a Clipper-like scheme.  That proposal is backed by fines up
to $10,000 per day and jail time. <p>

That's not voluntary. <p>

&gt;&gt;  Mr. Rotenberg said "We want the public to
&gt;&gt;  understand the full implications of this plan.
&gt;&gt;  Today it is only a few experts and  industry groups
&gt;&gt;  that understand the proposal. <p>

&gt;  I support this objective.  Unfortunately, it is not
&gt;  possible for most of us to be fully informed of the
&gt;  national security implications of uncontrolled
&gt;  encryption.  For very legitimate reasons, these cannot
&gt;  be fully discussed and debated in a public forum. <p>

This assertion has never been supported by evidence.  It has been used
simply to stifle criticism. <p>

&gt;  The Feb. 4 decision was made
&gt;  following an inter-agency policy review, headed by the
&gt;  National Security Council, that examined these issues
&gt;  using considerable input from industry, CPSR, EFF, and
&gt;  individuals as well as from law enforcement and
&gt;  intell <p>

CPSR did not participate in the inter-agency policy review.  Our position
from the very beginning is that these decisions must be made openly. <p>

&gt;  In the absence of understanding
&gt;  the national security issues, I believe we need to
&gt;  exercise some caution in believing that we can
&gt;  understand the full implications of encryption on
&gt;  society. <p>

This premise, if accepted, would mean that people in the United States
would have no right to express political views when the government claimed
"national security." Certainly, there are matters of national security that
must be protected, but when an agency with expertise in wire surveillance
develops a secret standard for eavesdropping and tells those who raise
questions that there are matters of national security that they would not
understand, there is good reason for concern. <p>
