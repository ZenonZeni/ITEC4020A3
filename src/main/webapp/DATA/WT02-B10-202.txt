<h3 align=center>Case Example #1 </h3>
<p align=center>(names and details altered to prevent identification)</p>
<p>A 23-year-old woman from Arkansas wrote a letter to the head of a New York research 
group after seeing a television program in which he described his work with patients with 
unusual eating patterns. In the letter, which requested that she be accepted into his 
program, the woman described her problems as follows: </p>
<h5><font size=3><strong>Several years ago, in college, I started using laxatives to lose weight. I started with a 
few and increased the number as they became ineffective. After 2 years I was taking 
250-300 Ex-Lax pills at one time with a glass of water, 20 per gulp. I would lose as 
much as 20 pounds in a 24-hour period, mostly water and some food, [and would be] 
dehydrated so that I couldn't stand, and could barely talk. I ended up in the 
university infirmary several times with diagnoses of food poisoning, severe 
gastrointestinal flu, etc., with bland diets and medications. I was released within a 
day or two. A small duodenal ulcer appeared and disappeared on X-rays in 1975. </strong></font></h5>
<h5><font size=3><strong>I would not eat for days, then would eat something, and, overcome by guilt at eating, 
and hunger, would eat, eat, eat. A girl on my dorm floor told me that she occasionally 
forced herself to vomit so that she wouldn't gain weight. I did this every once in a 
while and discovered that I could consume large amounts of food, vomit, and still lose 
weight. This was spring of 1975. 1 lost nearly 50 pounds over a few months, to 90 
pounds. My hair started coming out in handfuls, and my teeth were loose. </strong></font></h5>
<h5><font size=3><strong>I never felt lovelier or more confident about my appearance: physically liberated, 
streamlined, close-to-the-bone. I was flat everywhere except my stomach when I 
binged, when I would be full-blown and distended. When I bent over, each rib and 
back vertebra was outlined. After vomiting, my stomach was once more flat, empty. 
The more I lost, the more I was afraid of getting fat. I was afraid to drink water for 
days at a time because it would add pounds on the scale and make me miserable. Yet 
I drank (or drink; perhaps I should be writing this all in the present tense) easily a 
half-gallon of milk and other liquids at once when bingeing. I didn't need the laxatives 
as much to get rid of food and eventually stopped using them altogether (although I 
am still chronically constipated, I become nauseous whenever I see them in the 
drugstore). </strong></font></h5>
<h5><font size=3><strong>I exercised for hours each day to tone my figure from the weight fluctuations, and 
joined the university track team. I wore track shoes all the time and ran to classes 
and around town, stick-legs pumping. I went to track practice daily after being sick, 
until I was forced to quit; a single lap would make me dizzy, with cramps in my 
stomach and legs. </strong></font></h5>
<h5><font size=3><strong>At some point during my last semester before dropping out I came across an article 
on anorexia nervosa. It frightened me; my own personal obsession with food and 
body weight was shared by other people. I had not menstruated in 2 years. So, I 
forced myself to eat and digest healthy food. Hated it. I studied nutrition and 
gradually forced myself to accept a new attitude toward food&#151;vitalizing&#151;something 
needed for life. I gained weight, fighting panic. In a rigid, controlled way I have 
maintained myself nutritionally ever since: 105-115 pounds at 5'6&quot;. I know what I 
need to survive and I eat it&#151;a balanced diet with the fewest possible calories, mostly 
vegetables, fruits, fish, fowl, whole grain products, and so on. In 5 years I have not 
eaten anything like pizza, pastas or pork, sweets, or anything fattening, fried or rich 
without being very sick. Once I allowed myself an ice cream cone. But I am usually 
sick if I deviate as much as one bite. </strong></font></h5>
<h5><font size=3><strong>It was difficult for me to face people at school, and I dropped courses each semester, 
collecting incompletes but finishing well in the few classes I stayed with. The 
absurdity of my reclusiveness was even evident to me during my last semester when I 
signed up for correspondence courses, while living only two blocks from the 
correspondence university building on campus. I felt I would only be able to face 
people when I lost &quot;just a few more pounds.&quot; </strong></font></h5>
<h5><font size=3><strong>Fat. I cannot stand it. This feeling is stronger and more desperate than any horror at 
what I am doing to myself. If I gain a few pounds I hate to leave the house and let 
people see me. Yet I am sad to see how I have pushed aside the friends, activities, 
and state of energized health that once rounded my life. </strong></font></h5>
<h5><font size=3><strong>For all of this hiding, it will surprise you to know that I am by profession a model. 
Last year when I was more in control of my eating-vomiting I enjoyed working in 
front of a camera, and I was doing well. Lately I've been sick too much and feel 
out-of-shape and physically unself-confident for the discipline involved. I keep myself 
supported during this time with part-time secretarial work, and whatever unsolicited 
photo bookings my past clients give me. For the most part I do the secretarial work. 
And I can't seem to stop being sick all of the time. </strong></font></h5>
<h5><font size=3><strong>The more I threw up when I was in college, the longer it took, and the harder it 
became. I needed to use different instruments to induce vomiting. Now I double two 
electrical cords and shove them several feet down into my throat. This is preceded by 
6-10 doses of ipecac [an emetic]. My knees are calloused from the time spent 
kneeling sick. The eating-vomiting process takes usually 2-3 hours, sometimes as 
long as 8. I dread the gagging and pain and sometimes my throat is very sore and I 
procrastinate using the ipecac and cords. I sit on the floor, biting my nails, and pulling 
the skin off around my nails with tweezers. Usually I wear rubber gloves to prevent 
this somewhat. </strong></font></h5>
<h5><font size=3><strong>After emptying my stomach completely I wash thoroughly. In a little while I will 
hydrate myself with a bottle of diet pop, and take a handful of Lasix [furosemide; a 
diuretic] 40 mg (which I have numerous prescriptions for). Sometimes I am faint, 
very cold. I splash cool water on my face, smooth my hair, but my hands are shaking 
some. I will take aspirin if my hands hurt sharply . . . so I can sleep later. My lips, 
fingers are bluish and cold. I see in the mirror that blood vessels are broken. There 
are red spots over my eyes. They always fade in a day or two. There is a certain 
relief when it is over, that the food is gone, and I am not horribly fat from it. And I 
cry often . . . for some rest, some calm. It is foolish for me to cry for someone, 
someone to help me; when it is only me who is hiding and hurting myself. </strong></font></h5>
<h5><font size=3><strong>Now there is a funny new split in my behavior, this honesty about my illness. 
Hopefully it will bring me more help than humiliation. Sometimes I feel a hypocrisy in 
my actions, and in the frightened, well-ordered attempts to seek out help. All the 
while I am still sick, night after night after night. And often days as well. </strong></font></h5>
<h5><font size=3><strong>Two sets of logic seem to be operating against each other, each determined, each 
half-canceling the effects of the other. It is the part of me which forced me to eat 
that I'm talking about . . . which cools my throat with water after hours of heaving, 
which takes potassium supplements to counteract diuretics, and aspirin for torn 
hands. It is this part of me, which walks into a psychiatrist's office twice weekly and 
sees the liability of hurting myself seriously, which makes constant small efforts to 
repair the tearing-down. </strong></font></h5>
<h5><font size=3><strong>It almost sounds as if I am being brutalized by some unrelenting force. Ridiculous to 
feel this way, or to stand and cry, because the hands that cool my throat and try to 
make small repairs only just punched lengths of cord into my stomach. No demons, 
only me. </strong></font></h5>
<h5><font size=3><strong>For your consideration, I am </strong></font></h5>
<h5><font size=3><strong>Gratefully yours, </strong></font></h5>
<h5><font size=3><strong>Nancy Lee Duval </strong></font></h5>
<p>Ms. Duval was admitted to the research ward for study. Additional history revealed that 
her eating problems began gradually during her adolescence, and had been severe for the 
past 3-4 years. At age 14 she weighed 128 pounds and had reached her adult height of 
5'6&quot;. She felt &quot;terribly fat&quot; and began to diet without great success. At age 17 she weighed 
165 pounds and began to diet more seriously for fear that she would be ridiculed and went 
down to 130 pounds over the next year. She recalled feeling very depressed, 
overwhelmed, and insignificant. She began to avoid difficult classes so that she would 
never get less than straight A's, and began to lie about her school and grade performance 
for fear of being humiliated. She had great social anxiety in dealing with boys, which 
culminated in her transferring to a girls' school for the last year of high school. </p>
<p>When she left for college, her difficulties increased. She had trouble deciding how to 
organize her time&#151;whether to study, to date, or to see friends. She became more 
desperate to lose weight and began to use laxatives, as she describes in her letter. At age 
20, in her sophomore year of college, she reached her lowest weight of 88 pounds (70% 
of ideal body weight) and stopped menstruating. </p>
<p>As Ms. Duval describes in her letter, she recognized that there was a problem and 
eventually forced herself to gain weight. Nonetheless, the overeating and vomiting she had 
begun the previous year worsened. As she was preoccupied with her weight and her 
eating, her school performance suffered, and she dropped out of school midway through 
college at age 21. </p>
<p>Ms. Duval is the second of four children and the only girl. She comes from an 
upper-middle-class professional family. From the patient's description, it sounds as 
though the father has a history of alcoholism. There are clear indications of difficulties 
between the mother and the father, and between the boys and the parents; but no other 
family member has ever had psychiatric treatment.</p>
<hr>
<h3 align=center>Discussion </h3>
<p>Ms. Duval has Anorexia Nervosa, a disorder that was first described 300 years ago and 
given its current name in 1868. Although theories about the cause of the disorder have 
come and gone, the essential features have remained unchanged. Ms. Duval poignantly 
describes these features. </p>
<p>She had an intense and irrational fear of becoming obese, even when she was emaciated. 
Her body image was disturbed in that she perceived herself as fat when her weight was 
average and &quot;never lovelier&quot; when, to others, she must have appeared grotesquely thin. 
She lost about 30% of her body weight by relentless dieting and exercising, self-induced 
vomiting, and use of cathartics and diuretics. She had not menstruated for the past 3 years. </p>
<p>Significantly, Ms. Duval's dieting takes place despite persistent hunger; thus, the anorexia 
(loss of appetite) in the name of the disorder is a misnomer. In fact, she also has recurrent 
episodes of binge eating&#151;rapid, uncontrolled consumption of high-caloric foods. These 
binges are followed by vomiting and remorse. This pattern of recurrent binge eating and 
purging, if it occurred by itself, would warrant the diagnosis of Bulimia Nervosa, Purging 
Type. However, when it occurs during the course of Anorexia Nervosa, only the diagnosis 
of Anorexia Nervosa is made, but qualified as Binge Eating/Purging Type. </p>
<p>When an emaciated patient with Anorexia Nervosa insists that she is fat, this suggests the 
presence of a somatic delusion, as might be seen in Schizophrenia or Major Depression. 
However, such a patient is generally not considered to have a delusion because she is 
describing how she experiences herself rather than disputing the facts of her weight. </p>

<h3 align=center>Follow-up </h3>
<p>Ms. Duval remained in the research ward for several weeks, during which time she 
participated in research studies and, under the structure of the hospital setting, was able to 
give up her abuse of laxatives and diuretics. After her return home, she continued in 
treatment with a psychiatrist in psychoanalytically oriented psychotherapy two times a 
week, which she had begun 6 months previously. That therapy continued for 
approximately another 6 months, when her family refused to support it. The patient also 
felt that, although she had gained some insight into her difficulties she had been unable to 
change her behavior </p>
<p>Two years after leaving the hospital, she wrote that she was &quot;doing much better.&quot; She had 
reenrolled in college, and was completing her course work satisfactorily. She had seen a 
nutritionist, and felt that form of treatment was useful for her in learning what a normal 
diet was and how to maintain a normal weight. She was also receiving counseling from 
the school guidance counselors, but she did not directly relate that to her eating 
difficulties. Her weight was normal and she was menstruating regularly. She continued to 
have intermittent difficulty with binge eating and vomiting, but the frequency and severity 
of these problems were much reduced. She no longer abused diuretics or laxatives. </p>
