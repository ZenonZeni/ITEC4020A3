<b>Chemical Kinetic Modeling of Hydrogen Applications;<br>

Octane ratings are important because they can be used to assess

whether a fuel will produce knock in an automotive engine.  Ultimately,

the fuel octane rating determines the upper limit of the compression

ratio at which an automotive engine can operate.  Automotive engine

knock limits the thermodynamic efficiency of the engine and thus

the fuel economy of the vehicle.  This will affect spark ignition

engines using hydrogen as a fuel just as it affects those burning

conventional hydrocarbon fuels.

<P>

Calculations were carried out to assess the octane ratings of

hydrogen, methane, and hydrogen/methane mixtures.  A previously

developed correlation for a knock-rating engine was used to obtain

the octane ratings, developed for a CFR engine operated by Dr.

William Leppard at General Motors Research Laboratories.  The

fuel/air mixtures were stoichiometric mixtures, as required for

octane ratings.  Leppard has performed experiments to determine

the critical compression ratio for primary reference fuels and

hexanes with measured octane ratings ranging from 0 to 104.  Critical

compression ratio is the compression ratio at which a fuel/air

mixture will autoignite as a result of compressional heating without

using a spark plug.  We have developed the capability to compute

critical compression ratios with a chemical kinetic model for

the fuel chemistry and a thermodynamic model for engine compression,

expansion, and heat transfer.

Using a previously developed correlation curve and computed critical

compression ratios for methane, hydrogen and methane/hydrogen

mixture, predicted octane ratings were obtained.  A predicted

research octane rating (RON) for methane of 119 compared to an

experimental value of 120.  Our predicted RON for hydrogen is

111, compared to an experimental value of 100.  The predictions

show the correct experimental trend that hydrogen has a lower

octane number than methane.  Under slightly different experimental

conditions, Siebers at Sandia National Laboratories found that

hydrogen is slightly easier to ignite than methane, also consistent

with our kinetic modeling predictions.  Further study is needed

of both the prediction and the experimental uncertainty in the

octane number for hydrogen.  A 50:50 mixture of methane and hydrogen

apparently has a higher octane rating than either neat methane

or hydrogen.
