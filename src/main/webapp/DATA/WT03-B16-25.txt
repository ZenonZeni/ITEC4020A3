<br><h4>April 1995<hr></h4>

<h2><a name="eu">EUROPEAN UNION (EU)</a></h2>
<h4>Pensions mobility: progress at last?</h4>

<p>In spite of strenuous efforts by the European Commission, cross-border pensions mobility has remained elusive. The Commission's attempts to achieve cross-border freedoms of pension fund management services, pension fund investment and pension membership have, over recent years, been stalled by objections from member states. The most recent disappointment was the withdrawal of the EU Directive on pension fund investment (see <I>Headlines</I> of <a href="9408.html#eu">August 1994</a>).

<p>The last sign of progress was the ruling by the European Court of Justice (ECJ) on 28 January 1992 in the case of Bachmann v Belgium. The implication of this ruling was that it is illegal to tax contributions to a company pension plan based in another EU state in a different way from those paid to a locally approved plan.

<p>However, two developments this year mean that pensions mobility may be moving back up the agenda. The first concerns the ECJ's ruling on 14 February in the case of Finanzamt Köln-Altstadt v Roland Schumacker. The court decided that national income tax regimes must be exercised consistently with EU law, in spite of the fact that direct taxation does not currently fall within the jurisdiction of the EU.

<p>Mr. Schumacker is a Belgian national who works in Germany but lives in Belgium. He was taxed in Germany as a non-resident and was therefore not entitled to certain allowances. He claimed that he should be treated no less favourably under the German tax regime than a German resident. Having decided that national tax regimes have be exercised consistently with Union law, the court insisted that the free movement rules of the Treaty of Rome required the abolition of discrimination based on nationality between workers of different member states.

<p>The European Commission had issued a Recommendation in December 1993 which, although not binding on member states, was intended to encourage member states to adopt legislation to eliminate discrimination in personal income tax between residents and non-residents. The ruling of the ECJ in this case follows the principle of the Recommendation.
Although this case has no direct application to pension plans, the principle could equally well be applied to argue that existing tax barriers to cross-border pensions mobility within the EU are unlawful. Some double tax treaties between member states (for example between the UK and France)already go some way towards recognising pensions in each other's jurisdiction for tax purposes. It may be that other member states will follow suit in the light of this case and the EU Recommendation.

<p>The second development concerns the inclusion of measures to ensure the portability of pensions across member states in the Commission's 1995 work programme. A draft migrant workers directive had already been published in November 1994. This has now been replaced by a working document which indicates a slower timetable. While this acknowledges that problems still lie ahead, it also shows that the Commission is determined to ensure that, in the long term, the movement of workers within the EU should not have a detrimental effect on their pensions. Although pan-European pensions are still a long way off, progress— of one sort or another— is definitely being made.

<h2><a name="au">AUSTRALIA</a></h2>
<h4>Tax law on overseas funds changed</h4>

<p>With effect from 1 July 1994, individuals will only have a six-month period from becoming a tax resident in Australia to transfer their overseas retirement benefits into an Australian fund tax-free. If the amount is not transferred within this period, there may be a tax implication for the individuals in the tax year in which the amount actually comes into Australia. Growth in the benefits from the time they become tax residents of Australia to the date the amount enters the country is deemed to be assessable income of the individuals and is taxed at their personal marginal tax rate in the year the amount comes into Australia.

<p>There is also a change to the ability of Australian employers to gain tax deduction for most contributions to overseas superannuation funds for Australian resident workers. Such contributions are now both non-deductible for tax purposes and subject to fringe benefits tax. Previously, the amounts were deductible and exempt from fringe benefits tax.

<h2><a name="be">BELGIUM</a></h2>
<h4>Appointed actuaries introduced</h4>

<p>Following a Royal Decree issued at the end of 1994, pension funds have to appoint one or more actuaries to be consulted on matters of funding, technical reserves and reinsurance. Details of the appointed actuary or actuaries, who must satisfy certain requirements (eg EU national, minimum of five years' experience), have to be lodged with the Insurance Control Authorities (CDV/OCA) before 31 March 1995. Pension funds already had to file an actuarial statement each year that was signed by an 'actuary' but the latter was not officially appointed and did not have to satisfy any requirements.

<p>Further information: Geert De Ridder, Brussels, (32) (2) 676 1811


<h4><a name="be2">Sex equality in pension plans implemented</a></h4>

<p>The Belgian Insurance Control Authorities (CDV/OCA) have issued a communication, dated 20 January 1995, regarding the harmonisation of pension plans in the context of EU legislation on sex discrimination. The following procedures are imposed:
<ul>
<li>Pension funds that seek approval of the amended plan from the CDV/OCA must outline in a covering letter how the modifications satisfy EU requirements. Insurance companies that are only subject to the control a posteriori have to make an internal file note on behalf of their clients with group insurance contracts.
<li>If the plan amendments reduce benefits for certain categories of employees, the accrued benefits at the date of modification have to be guaranteed.
<li>Plans that are not yet amended must already be financed on the basis that the more favourable benefits apply to all categories of employees for years of service after 17 May 1990 (cf the levelling-up principle).
</ul>

<p>Finally, the control authorities have stated that they can make a reservation for all plan improvements which fall outside the scope of the Barber case (see the article about the salary freeze outlined in the global plan in <I>Headlines</I> of <a href="9404.html#be">April 1994</a>).  
Clearly, companies that have not yet brought their plans into line with EU legislation should do so as quickly as possible.

<h4><a name="be3">Social security contribution on pensions introduced</a></h4>

<p>With effect from 1 January 1995, the global plan introduced a progressive social security contribution on all pension income (see <I>Headlines</I> of <a href="9406.html#be">June 1994</a>). A Royal Decree issued at the end of 1994 gives more details:
<ul>
<li>Pensions in payment as well as lump sums paid since October 1980, of national or foreign origin, state-provided or not, are subject to the new contribution.
<li>For the purpose of calculating the contribution, lump sums must be converted into pensions, based on actuarial factors already in use for similar conversions under occupational accident insurance in the public sector.
<li>The contribution rate varies from 0.5% to 2% depending on gross income level and family situation.
<li>The national sickness and disability institute (INAMI/ RIZIV) is responsible for the calculation of the contribution which is withheld from the state pension.
</ul>

<h4><a name="be4">Unfunded or internally funded pension promises no longer permitted?</a></h4>

<p>On 16 June 1994, the Court of Appeal of Ghent ruled that internal reserves for pension promises are tax-deductible. This was good news as the judgment not only seemed to justify and confirm internal reserves but even recognised that they qualify as tax-deductible expenses.

<p>However, the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Economic Affairs, in their reply to a parliamentary question on the subject, adopted a strict interpretation of the General Insurance Law. According to this interpretation, all collective and individual pension promises have to be externally funded. And it was specified that only group insurances, pension funds and individual insurance contracts could be retained as external funding vehicles.

<p>The status of individual pension promises is currently unclear and requires clarification. The question is whether, in practice, internal promises remain permissible and whether so-called 'keymen insurances' ('assurances dirigeant d'entreprise'/'bedrijfsleidersverzekeringen') qualify as external funding vehicles for such promises. For the time being and until the relevant authorities issue clear regulations, companies that have introduced individual promises do not seem to have a compelling reason to alter their arrangements.

<h4>Benefit trends highlighted</h4>

<p>The Towers Perrin 1994 survey of corporate benefit trends in Brazil reveals that 48% of the 308 participating companies operate a formal pension plan. The vast majority of these use defined contribution or hybrid plans. This is mainly because they give companies increased flexibility and reduce longer-term risks.

<p>The other benefits most commonly provided are medical care, meal allowances and group life insurance, with more than 80% of participating companies providing at least one of these benefits. The full pattern of corporate benefit provision is shown in the chart below.

<h2><a name="it">ITALY</a></h2>
<h4>Pension reform back on track?</h4>

<p>Mr. Tiziano Treu, the recently appointed Labour Minister, is working towards defining the broad outlines of reforms for Italy's bloated pension system. Talks with union representatives have begun amid turmoil in the financial markets. Pressure from these markets has meant that Mr. Treu has been set a tight deadline of the end of March 1995 for reporting on his progress. Doubtless there will be lively discussions over the following weeks, and the deadline of the end of March will probably prove optimistic.

<h4>Pension deregulation continues</h4>

<p>The pensions environment is being deregulated with beneficial effects. Funded pension plans have been highly regulated. A key investment regulation has been the 5:3:3:2 rule which applies separately to each fund manager:

<p>Since April 1990, this regulation has been partially eased so that (2), (3) and (4) are exempted for large employee pension funds (EPFs— retirement funds which are contracted out of earnings-related social security), allowing the use of investment advisory firms. However, several related restrictions concerning exemption have been introduced:

<ul>
<li>Eligible EPFs have to have existed for at least eight years.
<li>Investment advisory firms can only manage funds accumulated after they have been approved by the Ministry of Health and Welfare.
<li>The funds must not exceed one-third of total assets.
Key recent changes for EPFs are as follows:
<li>The contribution abatement for contracted-out benefits was increased from 3.2% to 3.5% from November 1994, and will vary by EPF experience from 3.2% to 3.8% from March 1996.
<li>Restrictions on assets which are accumulated after a date approved by the government (the earliest approved date is 1 April 1990) for purposes of partial exemption from the 5:3:3:2 rule have been eliminated since November 1994. In addition, the eight years' requirement will be relaxed to three years.
<li>The mortality rates which must be used in EPF actuarial valuations will be revised on 1 April 1995 to reflect increased longevity and therefore increased pension costs.
<li>EPFs will be required to develop written investment policy statements, including investment objectives and asset allocation, in order to take advantage of the partial exemption from the 5:3:3:2 rule from April 1996.
<li>The government will implement market value-related accounting in lieu of the current book value system by 1997 at the latest.
</ul>

<h2><a name="nz">NEW ZEALAND</a></h2>
<h4>New disclosure regime published</h4>

<p>The second report from the government working party considering the information which trustees and companies must provide to superannuation scheme members was published recently. As well as corporate-sponsored superannuation, the working party has considered most investment products available to the average New Zealander.

<p>In line with New Zealand's tax-neutral savings regime, it is proposed that corporate superannuation be subject to the same disclosure requirements as other savings products. If the current proposal is not changed to exempt corporate superannuation, schemes will have more onerous future reporting requirements for new members and annual trustee reports.

<p>It is expected that the local industry body, the Association of Superannuation Funds of New Zealand (ASFONZ), will lobby hard for major changes to the current proposal. At a time when there is substantial renewed interest by employers in their superannuation and benefit programmes, it would be a mistake if further government legislation discouraged this interest.

<p>The latest ASFONZ benefits survey is due to be published shortly.

<h4>1995/6 budget has few surprises</h4>

<p>The budget presented by Finance Minister Chris Liebenberg on 15 March 1995 contained relatively few surprises for retirement funds, given the earlier recommendations of the Katz Commission (see <I>Headlines</I> of <a href="9502.html#za">February 1995</a>).

<p>The proposed 'cap' on tax-deductible employee and employer contributions to pension funds, as well as on contributions to retirement annuity funds, was not forthcoming. The proposals had drawn sharp criticism and debate from many quarters following the release of the Commission's report.

<p>The Minister acknowledged that this debate had highlighted various other issues regarding retirement benefit provision. The government is of the view that the matter should be pursued further in an holistic manner, with consideration being given to issues other than taxation. No changes beyond those discussed below can be implemented until further work has been done; this will be undertaken in close co-operation with the Katz Commission.

<p>Tax avoidance measures using the lump sums payable from pension and provident funds have been curtailed. Lump sums will, in future, not be considered as part of non-retirement funding income, and hence the ability of individuals to make significant tax-deductible retirement annuity contributions in the year of retirement to reduce taxable income is largely removed. In addition, if the average rate of tax in the year of accrual of the lump sum benefit is less than that in the previous year, the prior year's rate will be used.

<p>The tax-free status of lump sums payable from public sector retirement funds was not modified in the budget, and continues to be one of the most glaring anomalies in the taxation treatment of retirement funds.

<p>The budget speech makes clear reference to the constitutional imperative of no discrimination in respect of gender or marital status. Such issues were addressed in part in the budget.  With tax reform leading the way in this regard, it is probably fair to say that it is only a matter of time before other areas are also addressed, with definite implications for retirement funds.

<h2><a name="se">SWEDEN</a></h2>
<h4>Labour laws reinstated</h4>

<p>With effect from 1 January 1995, the new Social Democratic government has decided to reinstate labour legislation that was changed by the previous government (see <I>Headlines</I> of <a href="9406.html#se">June 1994</a>). The legislation concerns redundancy and probationary periods.

<p><b>Redundancy:</b> It is no longer possible for companies to exempt two 'highly-valued' employees from the last-in-first-out (LIFO) order of termination of employment.

<p><b>Probationary periods:</b> The maximum initial probationary period is once again six months (reduced from one year).

<h2><a name="uk">UNITED KINGDOM</a></h2>
<h4>Executive pay review body established</h4>

<p>The employers' federation, the Confederation of British Industry (CBI), has announced the formation of a study group on directors' remuneration (the Greenbury committee). It will be composed of leading industrialists and institutional shareholder representatives and will be chaired by Sir Richard Greenbury, chairman of Marks & Spencer. This initiative is in response to growing controversy over the level of executive pay, particularly in the privatised industries.

<p>Shortly after the CBI group was announced, the Institute of Directors(IoD) published its own guidelines on the subject. These recommended that:
<ul>
<li>remuneration committees should weigh up a number of considerations (such as performance, responsibilities, risk, market comparisons) when deciding upon directors' remuneration, and
<li>there should be greater disclosure of pay packages.
</ul>

<p>As the CBI group will not report until later this year, the IoD's recommendations will not be the final word on the subject.  But the IoD is a member of the Greenbury committee, and the committee will seriously consider the IoD's points. The committee will also examine share options and the length of executive contracts.  

<p>Although the outcome of the committee's wider deliberations is unknown, it is safe to predict that greater disclosure will be a main recommendation. Companies wishing to get an idea of the degree of detail that may be expected should look at the 1994 accounts of BOC and Grand Metropolitan, which are the definition of current best practice.

<h2><a name="us">UNITED STATES</a></h2>
<h4>Survey finds health cost growth under control</h4>

<p>Towers Perrin's <I>1995 Health Care Cost Survey</I> shows that employers have made even more progress in their efforts to restrain health care cost increases, with some companies reporting zero or negative cost growth this year. As recently as 1993, most US employers were experiencing double-digit cost in-creases for their employee and retiree health plans.

<p>At less than 2% for almost every type of health plan for active employees, the average 1995 cost increase reported by the 145 large employers participating in the survey was the smallest in the six years Towers Perrin has been tracking employer health care cost trends. What's more, the average 1995 cost for health maintenance organisations (HMOs)— pre-paid health plans that provide comprehensive services for a pre-determined annual premium— actually declined from reported 1994 levels by a little over 1%.

<p>Retiree medical cost increases also slowed dramatically among the employers surveyed— to about 3% this year. Last year, by contrast, employers were seeing retiree health care cost increases approaching 10% on average.

<p>Clearly, intensifying competition in the US health care marketplace and the positive effects of managed care are helping US employers control costs. However, in light of the cyclical pattern of health care cost movements over the last 20 years, it remains to be seen how long this good news will last. Moreover, given that employee and retiree health benefits still represent a large share of total remuneration costs— and more than 26% of overall benefit costs according to the latest US Chamber of Commerce benefit survey— effective health plan management will likely remain a key goal in most US companies for the foreseeable future.

<h4><a name="us2">FASB backs away from stock option expensing</a></h4>

<p>For the past few years, many companies have been working to head off a Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) proposal that would have required them to recognise an accounting expense for stock options and other forms of stock-based remuneration. Opponents of FASB's proposal scored an important victory recently as the Board decided to drop its proposed expensing requirements.

<p>Instead, FASB has decided to give companies a choice between recognising a remuneration expense for stock-based programmes or continuing to follow current rules, which generally do not require expense recognition. However, those taking the latter approach would be required to disclose in footnotes what the impact of expensing would have been on net income and earnings per share.

<p>While few companies are likely to choose the first alternative (expense recognition), most see the disclosure-only option as a burden in its own right. And some fear expanded footnote disclosure is just a prelude to another move towards expensing in the future.
