<h3>SUBJECT:<br>

SENATOR EXON INTRODUCES ONLINE INDECENCY LEGISLATION</h3>





<b>A.	OVERVIEW</b><p>



Senators Exon (D-NE) and Senator Gorton (R-WA) have introduced 

legislation to expand current FCC regulations on obscene and indecent 

audiotext to cover *all* content carried over all forms of electronic 

communications networks. If enacted, the "<a href="///policy/legis/!s314.bil">Communications Decency Act of 

1995" (S. 314)</a> would place substantial criminal liability on 

telecommunications service providers (including telephone networks, 

commercial online services, the Internet, and independent BBS's) if 

their network is used in the transmission of any indecent, lewd, 

threatening or harassing messages. The legislation is identical to a 

proposal offered by Senator Exon last year which failed along with the 

Senate Telecommunications reform bill (S. 1822, 103rd Congress, Sections 

801 - 804). The <a href = "#text"> text of the proposed statute, with proposed amendment</a>, is appended at the end of this document.<p> 



The bill would compel service providers to chose between severely 

restricting the activities of their subscribers or completely shutting 

down their email, Internet access, and conferencing services under the 

threat of criminal liability. Moreover, service providers would be 

forced to closely monitor every private communication, electronic mail 

message, public forum, mailing list, and file archive carried by or 

available on their network, a proposition which poses a substantial 

threat to the freedom of speech and privacy rights of all American 

citizens.<p>



S. 314, if enacted, would represent a tremendous step backwards on the 

path to a free and open National Information Infrastructure. The bill 

raises fundamental questions about the ability of government to control 

content on communications networks, as well as the locus of liability 

for content carried in these new communications media. <p>



To address this threat to the First Amendment in digital media, CDT is 

working to organize a broad coalition of public interest organizations 

including the ACLU, People For the American Way, and Media Access 

Project, along with representatives from the telecommunications, online 

services, and computer industries to oppose S. 314 and to explore 

alternative policy solutions that preserve the free flow of information 

and freedom of speech in the online world. CDT believes that 

technological alternatives which allow individual subscribers to control 

the content they receive represent a more appropriate approach to this 

issue.<p> 





<b>B.	SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS OF S. 314</b><p>



S. 314 would expand current law restricting indecency and harassment on 

telephone services to all telecommunications providers and expand 

criminal liability to *all* content carried by *all* forms of 

telecommunications networks. The bill would amend Section 223 of the 

Communications Act (47 U.S.C. 223), which requires carriers to take 

steps to prevent minors from gaining access to indecent audiotext and 

criminalizes harassment accomplished over interstate telephone lines. 

This section, commonly known as the Helms Amendment (having been 

championed by Senator Jesse Helms), has been the subject of extended 

constitutional litigation in recent years.<p>



<i>CARRIERS LIABLE FOR CONDUCT OF ALL USERS ON THEIR

NETWORKS<p></i>



S. 314 would make telecommunication carriers (including telephone 

companies, commercial online services, the Internet, and BBS's) liable 

for every message, file, or other content carried on its network -- 

including the private conversations or messages exchanged between two 

consenting individuals.<p>



Under S. 314, anyone who "makes, transmits, or otherwise makes available 

any comment, request, suggestion, proposal, image, or other 

communication" which is "obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, or indecent" 

using a "telecommunications device" would be subject to a fine of 

$100,000 or two years in prison (Section (2)(a)).<p>



In order to avoid liability under this provision, carriers would be 

forced to pre-screen all messages, files, or other content before 

transmitting it to the intended recipient. Carriers would also be forced 

to prevent or severely restrict their subscribers from communicating 

with individuals and accessing content available on other networks. <p>



Electronic communications networks do not contain discrete boundaries. 

Instead, users of one service can easily communicate with and access 

content available on other networks. Placing the onus, and criminal 

liability, on the carrier as opposed to the originator of the content, 

would make the carrier legally responsible not only for the conduct of 

its own subscribers, but also for content generated by subscribers of 

other services.<p>



This regulatory scheme clearly poses serious threats to the free flow of 

information throughout the online world and the free speech and privacy 

rights of individual users. Forcing carriers to pre-screen content would 

not only be impossible due to the sheer volume of messages, it would 

also violate current legal protections.<p>



<i>CARRIERS REQUIRED TO ACT AS PRIVATE CENSOR OF ALL PUBLIC FORUMS AND ARCHIVES</i><p>



S. 314 would also expand current restrictions on access to indecent 

telephone audiotext services by minors under the age of 18 to cover 

similar content carried by telecommunications services (such as America 

Online and the Internet). (Sec (a)(4)).<p>



As amended by this provision, anyone who, "by means of telephone or 

telecommunications device, makes, transmits, or otherwise makes 

available (directly or by recording device) any indecent communication 

for commercial purposes which is available to any person under the age 

of 18 years of age or to any other person without that person's consent, 

regardless of whether the maker of such communication placed the call or 

initiated the communication" would be subject of a fine of $100,000 or 

two years in prison.<p>



This would force carries to act as private censors of all content available in public forums or file archives on their networks. Moreover, 

because there is no clear definition of indecency, carriers would have 

to restrict access to any content that could be possibly construed as 

indecent or obscene under the broadest interpretation of the term. 

Public forums, discussion lists, file archives, and content available 

for commercial purposes would have to be meticulously screened and 

censored in order to avoid potential liability for the carrier.<p>



Such a scenario would severely limit the diversity of content available 

on online networks, and limit the editorial freedom of independent forum 

operators.<p>



<b>ADDITIONAL NOTABLE PROVISIONS</b><p>



<i>AMENDMENT TO ECPA</i><p>



Section (6) of the bill would amend the Electronic Communications 

Privacy Act (18 USC 2511) to prevent the unauthorized interception and 

disclosure of "digital communications" (Sec. 6). However, because the 

term "digital communication" is not defined and 18 USC 2511 currently 

prevents unauthorized interception and disclosure of "electronic 

communications" (which includes electronic mail and other forms of 

communications in digital form), the effect of this provision has no 

clear importance.<p> 



<i>CABLE OPERATORS MAY REFUSE INDECENT PUBLIC ACCESS 

PROGRAMMING</i><p>



Finally, section (8) would amend sections 611 and 612 of the 

Communications Act (47 USC 611 - 612) to allow any cable operator to 

refuse to carry any public access or leased access programming which 

contains "obscenity, indecency, or nudity".<p>



<b>C.  ALTERNATIVES TO EXON: RECOGNIZE THE UNIQUE USER CONTROL

CAPABILITIES OF INTERACTIVE MEDIA</b><p>



Government regulation of content in the mass media has always been 

considered essential to protect children from access to sexually-

explicit material, and to prevent unwitting listeners/views from being 

exposed to material that might be considered extremely distasteful. The 

choice to protect children has historically been made at the expense of 

the First Amendment ban on government censorship. As Congress moves to 

regulate new interactive media, it is essential that it understand that 

interactive media is different than mass media. The power and 

flexibility of interactive media offers a unique opportunity to enable 

parents to control what content their kids have access to, and leave the 

flow of information free for those adults who want it. Government 

control regulation is simply not needed to achieve the desired purpose.<p>



Most interactive technology, such as Internet browsers and the software 

used to access online services such as America Online and Compuserve, 

already has the capability to limit access to certain types of services 

and selected information. Moreover, the electronic program guides being 

developed for interactive cable TV networks also provide users the 

capability to screen out certain channels or ever certain types of 

programming. Moreover, in the online world, most content (with the 

exception of private communications initiated by consenting individuals) 

is transmitted by request. In other words, users must seek out the 

content they receive, whether it is by joining a discussion or accessing 

a file archive. By its nature, this technology provides ample control at 

the user level. Carriers (such as commercial online services, Internet 

service providers) in most cases act only as "carriers" of electronic 

transmissions initiated by individual subscribers.<p>



CDT believes that the First Amendment will be better served by giving 

parents and other users the tools to select which information they (and 

their children) should have access to. In the case of criminal content 

the originator of the content, not the carriers, should be responsible 

for their crimes. And, users (especially parents) should be empowered to 

determine what information they and their children have access to. If 

all carriers of electronic communications are forced restrict content in 

order to avoid criminal liability proposed by S. 314, the First 

Amendment would be threatened and the usefulness of digital media for 

communications and information dissemination would be drastically 

limited. <p>





<b>D.	NEXT STEPS</b><p>



The bill has been introduced and will next move to the Senate Commerce 

Committee, although no Committee action has been scheduled. Last year, a 

similar proposal by Senator Exon was approved by the Senate Commerce 

committee as an amendment to the Senate Telecommunications Bill (S. 

1822, which died at the end of the 103rd Congress). CDT will be working 

with a wide range of other interest groups to assure that Congress does 

not restrict the free flow of information in interactive media.<p>
