        <font color="#800000"><h3>What is Medical Payments
        Coverage?</h3>
        </font><br>
        </center> <i><font color="#800000">William Wilson,
        Underwriter</font></i><p> Medical Payments coverage is an
        additional coverage provided under the Commercial General
        Liability policy with a sublimit of $5,000 for any one
        person. This coverage is often referred to as &quot;first
        aid coverage&quot; as it affords automatic payment of
        limited medical expenses. </p>
        <p> Medical Payments coverage is designed to pay
        reasonable medical expenses for bodily injury caused by
        the insured's operations, or by an accident on the
        insured's premises, including areas next to premises the
        insured owns or leases. It is important to note, payment
        is limited to those expenses which are incurred and
        reported within one year of the date of the accident, and
        the injured person must submit to an examination, at our
        expense, by physicians of our choice as we reasonably
        require. </p>
        <p> This additional coverage basically intends to pay for
        bodily injury sustained by persons of the general public
        while on the insured's premises or while being exposed to
        the insured's operations. The important aspect of this
        coverage is that payment is made without regard to the
        legal liability of the insured. It is believed that in
        providing this coverage, we will assist in decreasing
        both frequency and severity of bodily injury suits. This
        is based on the assumption that the inclination of the
        injured party to sue is reduced if they receive
        conciliatory care at the time of the accident. </p>
        <p> This coverage is designed to be somewhat limited in
        scope, and there are a number of exclusions. These
        exclusions include bodily injury to any insured, any
        person hired to do work for or on behalf of an insured,
        any person injured on the insured's premises that the
        person normally occupies, any person for which workers
        compensation benefits are payable, any person injured
        while taking part in athletics, and bodily injury due to
        war, whether or not declared, or any act or condition
        incidental to war. </p>
        <p> If the general liability has a deductible, there will
        be no Medical Payments coverage. However, there will be
        coverage for expenses incurred by the insured for first
        aid administered to others at the time of an accident.
        Similar to the terms of the Medical Payments coverage,
        the accident must arise from bodily injury caused by the
        insured's operations, or by an accident on the insured's
        premises. </p>
        <p> Although this is no-fault coverage, all medical
        payments paid by TVIR on behalf of an insured will be
        reflected as an incurred loss under the Commercial
        General Liability policy. Consequently, these payments
        may have a direct impact on your General Liability
        premium calculation through the experience rating
        program. </p>
        <p> Should you need any additional information regarding
        this coverage, contact your Agent or TVIR Account
        Manager. </p>
