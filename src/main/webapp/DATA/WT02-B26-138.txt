Environmental Education</CENTER>
</H4>
Getting markets to support cleaner products and technologies is firstly
a matter of educating them as to the need for and benefit of such environmentally
benign advances. Green processes and products are based (and often priced)
on environmental ethics and principles (such as eco-justice, zero waste
and sustainable development) that few end-users fully understand or empathize
with. <BR>
<BR>
Market environmental education, however, can be too time-consuming and costly
a process for one company to bear alone. Coddington Environmental, therefore,
links marketers up with programs or partners that have similar educational
goals and similar target audiences. These partners bring additional personpower,
expertise and financial resources to the table.
