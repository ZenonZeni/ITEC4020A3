<H1>DPT, Oh My!</H1>
<p>
Every supporter of the administrations continued policies prohibiting
strong encryption technology and supporting GAK says that
without these controls, we will be at the mercy of Drug dealers,
pedaphiles, and terrorists.
<p>
This is a completely goundless statement, yet it has been repeated
in many forums. 
<p>
If the government really wanted to stop drug dealers who harm
American society, when are they going to take on RJ Reynolds, Phillip Morris,
and Anheusier Busch?
