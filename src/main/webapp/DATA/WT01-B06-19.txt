</h3></center>

<i>Palaetiology</i>: ``The term `palaetiology' was coined in 1837 by
English philosopher, historian, and educator William Whewell (1794-1866)
to refer to those sciences which have as their object the reconstruction
of the past based on the evidence of the present.  Whewell's two
exemplary palaetiological sciences were geology and comparative
philology, but he recognized that many different disciplines had
palaetiological divisions.'' [Robert J. O'Hara, <a
href="http://rjohara.uncg.edu/palaetiology.html">Palaetiology</a> on the
<a href="http://rjohara.uncg.edu/">Darwin-L Web Server</a>.]

<p>
I am convinced, for reasons which I hope will eventually be made clear on 
this web server and elsewhere, that law, like language, can only be 
understood by taking a palaetiological approach--that law, and especially
our Common Law, can only be understood by studying how it has evolved
over the centuries.  We can only understand the past by studying the 
"evidence of the present" and we can only understand the present by 
understanding how we came to be where we are right now.  

<p>
I am convinced that we can only 
understand the present by understanding the past.

<p>
The key resource on the web for the comparative study of the historical 
sciences is the Darwin-L Web Server maintained by Robert J. O'Hara:

There are many Buddhist resources available on the Internet and the
World Wide Web:

<p>
<ul>
<li> <a href="http://coombs.anu.edu.au/WWWVL-Buddhism.html">
Buddhist Studies WWW Virtual Library </a>
(The Internet Guide to Buddhist Studies) 

<li><a href="http://www.psu.edu/jbe/jbe.html">Journal of Buddhist Ethics</a>
(Buddhist ethics is to ethics as Buddhist theology is to theology)
<p>
<li><a href="/links/ol.html#bd">Other Links</a> Relating to the Buddhadahrma
</ul>

Here is an article that I presented at the 
<a href="http://www.psu.edu/jbe/confer2.html">
Online Conference on Buddhism 
and Human Rights </a>that was sponsored by the 
<a href="http://www.psu.edu/jbe/jbe.html">Journal of Buddhist Ethics</a> 
and held on October 1-14, 1995.  (For the moment this is just a link
to the ASCII text as it was presented at the confernce and included in
the <a href="http://www.psu.edu/jbe/papers.html">
Conference Papers</a>.  In time I hope to make it available in postscript and
in HTML format.)
