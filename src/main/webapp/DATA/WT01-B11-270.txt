<UL>
<LI>The Fund's diversified structure enabled it to perform well in last year's volatile fixed income market with a return that placed it near the top third of its Lipper peer group of 176 Intermediate Investment Grade Debt Funds for the year.
<LI>Bond prices were volatile and reacted swiftly to changes in economic news, particularly on inflation.  Concerns that foreign demand for Treasury bonds was drying up also negatively impacted bond prices during the fourth quarter.
<LI>Bond yields rose during the year -- the 30-year Treasury bond, which yielded 5.95% at the beginning of 1996, traded in a 125 basis point range during the year to end at 6.65%.  Intermediate maturity bonds also traded in a similar fashion through the year.  Total returns for bonds of all maturities, however, were modestly positive.

<B><I>Information presented is for the Fund's I Shares. The yield provided is for the 30 days through the end of the above period. Average annual total returns were 3.44%, 4.54%, 5.49% and 6.90% for the 1, 3, 5 and 10 year periods, respectively, for the period ending 12/31/96. </I></B></I>

<P><I>
<B><I>These returns include reinvestment of dividends and capital gains. During this period, some of the Fund's fees may have been waived; if these fees were not waived, total return would have been lower. Results represent past performance and do not guarantee future results. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate, and shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than original cost.Prior to November 11, 1994, Norwest Bank Minnesota, N.A. managed a collective trust fund with investment objectives and policies substantially the same as those of the Fund. The performance for the Fund includes the performance of the predecessor collective investment fund for periods before it became a mutual fund on November 11, 1994. The collective investment fund performance was adjusted to reflect the Fund's 1994 estimate of its expense ratio for the first year of operations as a mutual fund. The collective investment fund was not registered under the 1940 Act or subject to certain investment restrictions that are imposed by the Act. If the collective investment fund had been registered under the 1940 Act, the collective investment fund historical return may have been adversely affected. Distributed by Forum Financial Services, Inc. Mutual Funds are NOT FDIC OR FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD INSURED AND MAY LOSE VALUE. NO BANK GUARANTEE.</I></B></I>
