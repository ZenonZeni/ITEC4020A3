<STRONG><FONT SIZE="+1">New York Life Reaches Out to Young Families with New Insurance
Package</FONT>
</STRONG><P>

<STRONG>New York, August 21, 1996</STRONG> - Recognizing the need to assist growing families
with their insurance requirements, New York Life Insurance Company announced
today a new package of life insurance plans called Spectra Life, which
combines the lower costs of term life insurance with tax deferred cash value
whole life insurance.<P>
        "We recognized that young families often have limited resources but still
require protection," said Mike Gallo, senior vice president of the Company's
Individual Life Department.  "Spectra Life will provide flexible, needed
insurance protection at a reasonable cost to a segment of the population
that studies show is often underinsured."<P>
        Indeed, New York Life believes Spectra Life is the ideal insurance package
for growing families headed by individuals between the ages of 20 and 45
with an income between $30,000 and $75,000 - a market that represents
approximately 14.4 million households in the United States. <A HREF="#1"><SUP><STRONG><FONT
SIZE="-1">1</FONT></STRONG></SUP></A><P>
        <A HREF="psinmm.html">Spectra Life</A> offers growing families three different options of life
insurance protection designed to provide insurance coverage at a premium
cost that can be, in some cases, up to 60 percent less than a traditional
whole life policy.  The options are as follows:<P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>Spectra 1 - offers families a 25 percent whole life and 75 percent term
	insurance mix that maintains a level of cost for a five-year period.  In
	addition, customers have the privilege of converting the term insurance
	portion of the coverage into cash value whole life.<P>

	<LI>Spectra 2 - offers families a 50/50 mix of whole life and term life
	insurance that maintains a level cost for a five-year period.  In addition,
	customers have the privilege of converting the term insurance portion of the
	coverage into cash value whole life.<P>

	<LI>Spectra 3 - offers families a 50/50 mix of whole life insurance with a
	Dividend Option Term rider and the Option to Purchase Paid-Up Additions
	rider.  This blend maximizes insurance coverage and eventually replaces the
	term insurance with paid-up additional insurance.<P>
</UL>

        "We believe New York Life's Spectra Life plans will give young families the
ability to purchase insurance when their needs are greatest - at a low
economical cost - and to allow them to increase their coverage as their
needs mature," added Gallo.<P>
        New York Life Insurance Company, a Fortune 100 company, is one of the
largest financial services companies in the United States and the world.
