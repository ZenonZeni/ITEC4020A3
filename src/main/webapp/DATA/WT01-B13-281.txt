Your financial representative is a licensed professional, trained to
have an in-depth understanding of the financial markets. What's more, he
or she is expected to maintain the highest level of integrity and
respect in dealing with clients.
<BR><BR>

Entrusting your investments to an investment professional can actually
lift a weight off your shoulders. 
<BR><BR>

<STRONG>Why? Because your financial representative can...</STRONG>
<BR><BR>

<STRONG>Evaluate and help choose the best investments alternatives for you.</STRONG> Your
representative can pre-screen investment choices, and present you with
the ones that make the most sense for your situation. 
<BR><BR>

<STRONG>Help you manage risk.</STRONG> Investing to build capital always involves some degree of risk. A
financial representative can help you find the most comfortable
combination of risk and reward for you, based on your goals and
time-frame. Likewise, he or she can help you employ a variety of
risk-reduction strategies to help protect your investments.
<BR><BR>

<STRONG>Monitor the markets - and everything that impacts them.</STRONG> You won't have
to worry and watch the markets, because that's your representative's
full-time job. He or she will help keep your focus on long-term results
- and put short-term ups and downs in perspective. This can help reduce
losses due to "panic selling" - losses that result from selling
investments at the wrong time, for the wrong reasons. 
<BR><BR>

<STRONG>Relieve you of administrative details.</STRONG> Your investment transactions can
go much more smoothly when handled by a professional financial
representative. In fact, he or she can take most of the time-consuming,
but necessary, paperwork off your hands. And, if you make all of your
investments through one representative, matters like address, telephone
number, and name changes can be handled with one phone call.
Furthermore, your representative can even help you organize and report
your investments' performance at tax-time.
