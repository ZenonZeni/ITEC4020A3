<p><i>Tailor the opening sentence of this sample letter to the
editor to reinforce or challenge an argument made in an article
on brain disorders that has been published in your local
newspaper. Once you send this to the editor, make sure to follow
up with a phone call.</i></p>

<p>Dear Editor:</p>

<p>In regard to <b><i>[insert reporter&#146;s name]</i></b>
article, <b><i>[insert article title]</i></b>, which appeared on <b><i>[insert
date]</i></b>, I would like to <b><i>[clear up some errors and
misperceptions about brain disorders/applaud (reporter) for
his/her accurate reporting on brain disorders]</i></b>. Contrary
to what many Americans believe, severe mental illnesses are not
caused by bad character, poor child-rearing, or an
individual&#146;s behavior. A severe mental illness is a brain
disorder that, like epilepsy or Alzheimer&#146;s disease, is a biologically
based medical problem.</p>

<p>Thanks to major scientific advances, researchers have been
able to identify several biological factors -- such as brain
chemistry, structure, and functioning, as well as genes -- that
cause the brain disorders schizophrenia, panic disorder,
obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), bipolar disorder (manic-depressive
illness), and major depression. </p>

<p>For example, scientists have identified brain chemicals that
determine much of our mental and physical activities. Imbalances
in the chemicals serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine and
their receptors have been linked to brain disorders such as
schizophrenia and depression. New medications have been created
to balance these chemical levels and thus effectively treat
symptoms of brain disorders.</p>

<p>Science has proven that brain disorders have physiological
indicators. Through advanced imaging technology, scientists have
identified structural and functional differences in the brains of
individuals with brain disorders, as compared to those with
normal controls. These disorders can now be diagnosed and treated
as effectively as many other medical conditions.</p>

<p>Citizens of this country need to start learning the facts
about the causes and treatment of brain disorders. Only then will
the stigma and discrimination associated with these disorders be
eliminated.</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p><b><i>[Insert your name and affiliation]</i></b>&nbsp;</p>
