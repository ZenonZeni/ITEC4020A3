<H2><B>A Unique Perspective<br>
For An Unusual Golf Tournament</H2></B><br>
<H3>by James Achenbach, Senior Editor, GOLFWEEK</H3>
You think being a golf journalist is a piece of cake?  Hey, sometimes I'd rather be run over by a greens mower.
<P>
Working alongside professional golfers -- and writing about them regularly -- is no easy task.  Friendships with players, for example, can be an impediment to objective journalism.  There has to be a clear distinction between reporting the news (telling the truth, if you will) and being a friend.  There has to be a line in the sand, over which an ethical writer will not step.
<P>
It may sound unorthodox or even revolting, but I am not in the business of creating friendships.
<P>
I have known <a href="bios.html#zinger">Paul Azinger</a> for more than 20 years.  I knew him when he played on his high school golf team and would shoot 35 one day and 45 the next.  Nine holes with him was an adventure to be continued, and there is no way I can adequately express the depth of my admiration for what he has accomplished.  Because of our professions, however, we became adversaries as much as friends.
<P>
Once I had a prolonged difference of opinion (I am tempted to call it a war of words) with <a href="bios.html#strange">Curtis Strange</a>, who didn't agree with something I wrote.  It was a very unpleasant experience.  Even <a href="bios.html#jake">Peter Jacobsen</a>, who gets along with everybody in cleats, has not exactly been my greatest admirer.  "You're too critical," he pronounced one day.
<P>
So why did Peter's event management company, which produces The Fred Meyer Challenge, ask me to write this article?  I guess <a href="pjp.html">Peter Jacobsen Productions</a> thought I would tell the truth, which in this case is simple: The Fred Meyer Challenge is the most entertaining golf tournament you will ever see -- anywhere, any time.
<P>
Entertaining in the sense that it combines effervescent personalities and great golf shots better than any other tournament I know.  Entertaining in the sense that a lot of money, $750,000, is on the line, and yet the players joke around as if it were a $2 Nassau.
<P>
Be assured, however, that the competition is very serious.  You can see it clearly in the emotion-filled faces of the players as they contend with <a href="club.html">The Oregon Golf Club's</a> outrageously tough 18th, which may be the most difficult closing hole in America.
<P>
My idea of a nightmare?  I have to break 90, or the devil takes my soul.  I get to the course and realize that all 18 holes are the same -- the uphill, creek-lined, bunker-protected 18th at The Oregon Golf Club.  Peter must have finished his tax return the night before he designed this diabolical hole.
<P>
Speaking of Peter, the free-wheeling personality of The Fred Meyer Challenge is a tribute to his distinctive character and to his popularity among players on the PGA Tour.  Could anyone else assemble such a fabulous lineup of players and celebrities?  Yes, but I can think of only three or four superstars who could pull it off.  And the founder of the Flounders (that's the mock musical group Jake Trout and the Flounders) is right at the top of the list.
<P>
How strong is the field for this year's event?  Together these players have won almost three dozen major professional championships.  This is golf at its best -- past, present and future, from the legendary <a href="bios.html#arnie">Arnold Palmer</a>, 65, to the soon-to-be legendary <a href="bios.html#els">Ernie Els</a>, 25.
<P>
And how many golf fans have had the opportunity to see <a href="bios.html#bear">Jack</a> and son <a href="bios.html#gnick">Gary</a> Nicklaus play together in a team event?  Not many.  In my mind, this alone is worth the price of admission.
<P>
What happens when you put players of this magnitude in the friendly, no-pressure atmosphere of The Fred Meyer Challenge?  It's like dynamite, all this golfing talent exploding in a let-'er-rip environment.  Boom!  The byproduct is an astounding collection of daring golf shots.
<P>
If you're like me, you'll be amazed by what you see.  The skill of these golfers is phenomenal.  I love the sounds as well as the sights.  I love standing by a tee, listening to the whack of the ball and watching the flight pattern as it soars toward the tree tops.
<P>
But the bottom line, as Peter would wish, is the camaraderie and the fellowship.  This is golf, the best of all games, played by a fraternity of some the most gifted golfers to lace on cleats and spike the face of the earth.
<P>
The Fred Meyer Challenge is unique.  But it's more than that -- it's something to be thankful for.  A tournament like this doesn't just happen overnight.  All the stars in the heavens must have been lined up in the just the right fashion when this event fell into place.  I know of no other golf tournament quite like it.
<P>
It's enough to make me cross that line in the sand.  It's enough to make me think about new friendships.
<P>
Oh boy, this tournament must be getting to me.  Excuse me while I go write a few nasty words about somebody.
