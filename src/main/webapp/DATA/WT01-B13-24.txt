The American dream of taking the wheel of a brand new automobile and
heading down the highway has become a dream less available to the middle
class. 
<P>

According to Zurich Kemper Investments Economist David Hale, auto prices have
risen so sharply during recent years that today's new auto buyer has an
average income that's about 40 percent above the national median
household income. Ten years ago, new auto buyers had a household income
that was about 20 percent above the national median, according to Hale. 
<P>

For the would-be car buyer, these higher auto prices may require a more
planned, longer term investment strategy. To the economy and to auto
manufacturers, Hale says, "This compression in the share of population
now able to qualify for new auto purchases has greatly increased the
sensitivity of auto sales to factors that influence the income or
confidence of people in the top income quintile of the population." The
1995 income tax hike, for example, hurt upper-income Americans and
resulted in an auto slump, Hale says.

<B><FONT SIZE=-1>The graph below tracks the U.S. average new car transaction price as a
percentage of disposable income per household. As you can see, today's
new car buyer commits about as much of his or her disposable income as
the new car buyer in 1960. Over the last 35 years, 1973 was the low
point, when a new car purchase consumed the smallest amount of the buyer's
disposable income.</FONT SIZE=-1></B><BR>
