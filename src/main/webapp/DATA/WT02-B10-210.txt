The Psychiatric Institute Computer Center (PICC) has consolidated with the Computer Center at Nathan Kline Institute (NKI) to form the Integrated Research Information System (IRIS). The mainframe computer, now located at NKI, is an IBM ES/9000 with 64 MB of memory. The PICC continues to serve users with computer programming and statistical consultation; remote terminals and PCs are used to access the mainframe.

PICC also provides its users with technical support for Macintosh and IBM clones. A large variety of up-to-date statistical and graphics (illustration, statistics related) software on PCs is provided as well as professional consulting in these areas.
