<P><B>ARGENTINA</B>  &#167;   The government's revenue-boosting program is
making progress in congress and a September  approval is in sight. While this
has helped calm the market, challenges to President Menem from the Peronist old
guard are keeping a worrying degree of political dissonance in full view.  Page
2</P>
<P><B>BRAZIL</B>  &#167;   In a bid to raise exports and close the trade gap,
the government is proposing to get rid of the ICM tax  that heavily burdens
exporters. Under the plan, the federal government would reimburse states for
lost tax revenue through bonds the states could use to reduce their large debts
to the federal government. &#167; Asian auto makers are still not satisfied by
President Cardoso's decree extending lowered tariffs to some imports from
companies without Brazilian plants. Page 3</P>
<P><B>CHILE </B>  &#167;   Seattle-based Bayside Ltd. is not giving up its
battle against environmentalists who have already  delayed by a year its $300
million project to exploit native lenga hardwood forests in Tierra del Fuego. &#167;
Bema Gold's planned investment of up to $1 billion to develop massive new copper
and gold reserves at Cerro Casale will stimulate already-rising Chilean gold
production. &#167;  The government is once again searching for a new central
bank president after the senate's surprise rejection of Massad. Page 4</P>
<P><B>COLOMBIA</B>  &#167;   President Samper's anti-narcotics package is
turning out to be a constitutional reform in disguise,  and one which critics
say would dangerously expand executive powers. But the anti-narcotics
provisions, so important for maintaining good US relations, have been all but
lost in the shuffle. &#167; Union strike threats have forced the government to
delay opening the telecom sector to private investment. &#167;  American
Airlines will be able to resume flights to Bogota under a deal reached by US and
Colombian negotiators.  Page 5</P>
<P><B>MEXICO</B> &#167;   Political parties will scrutinize President
Zedillo's annual state of the union address as they strategize  for July 1997
mid-term elections. The president is fortunately in a position to deliver an
upbeat assessment of economic trends.  &#167;  But will economic recovery and
early political reforms overcome renewed suspicions over the Colosio
assassination and the rise of a new guerrilla group?  Page 6</P>
<P><B>PERU</B>  &#167;   Canada's Barrick Gold's spectacular bid of $202
million eclipsed the $5 million base price for  undeveloped gold mining property
Quicay. This potentially lush property is just one prize in the rush to exploit
reserves as Peru moves to surpass Brazil as Latin America's largest gold
producer.  Page 7 </P>
<P><B>VENEZUELA  </B> &#167;   The long-awaited sell-off of state enterprises
has stalled again, with the abrupt suspension of  the much-heralded Banco de
Venezuela privatization and failed auctions for grounded state airline
Aeropostal and eastern Venezuelan timber rights. &#167;  The oil industry is one
of the few bright spots, as Arco and PDVSA sign a $3.5 billion heavy crude oil
exploration joint venture. &#167; In a last resort, Pepsi-Cola has appealed to
anti-trust agency Procompetencia to punish its franchise partner for defecting
to rival Coca-Cola.  Page 8</P>
<P><B>TAX REPORT</B>  &#167;   <I>Lagniappe's</I> annual survey of taxation
in Latin America reveals that the region's governments,  having largely adopted
like-minded regimes over the past few years that feature lower corporate rates,
high sales taxes and levies on assets, are now focusing on ways to improve
collections. Argentina is way out front in this regard. Brazil, the lagging
exception to sweeping tax reform, caught up with the pack this year and made
major revisions that dramatically lowered the tax burden on companies.  &#167; 
A country-by country comparison highlights the tax levies companies face.  Pages

<H2>Lavish Offers for Quicay Give New Boost To Thriving Gold Sector
</H2>
<P>The dramatic late July auction of a largely unexplored Central Andean gold
deposit has again underlined foreign mining companies' keen interest in staking
claims to Peru's most attractive sector. And it underscores Peru's meteoric rise
as a major gold producer. 
</P>
<P><B><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="CG Times">High Stakes Bidding. </FONT></B>Some 13
big-name international bidders presented sealed-envelope offers for Quicay, an
undeveloped property belonging to state mining giant Centromin. Base price had
been set at $5 million. 
</P>
<P>The offers took observers' breath away as Quicay finally fell into the hands
of Canada's Barrick Gold with a $202 million shutout bid. Barrick has up to two
years to decide whether to take up its development option, and pay the sum in
cash. The runner-up was Inmet Mining, also of Canada, offering $81 million. Four
other companies also bid over $50 million.   
</P>
<P><B><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="CG Times">Latin America's Gold Belt. </FONT></B>The
fierce competition reflects the lure of Peruvian gold. The country has been the
outstanding performer in Latin American gold for the past few years and is now
the second most important producer on the continent (see chart). Output has
risen five times from around 10 metric tons a year in 1986 to more than 50 tons
last year. By comparison, Chile doubled gold production in the same 10-year
period while Mexico and Bolivia both registered an almost three-fold increase.
The gold committee of Peru's national mining society predicts that output will
rise to 100 tons by the end of the century, probably making Peru the region's
largest gold producer.  
</P>
<P><B><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="CG Times">High Returns. </FONT></B>Yanacocha, the
joint venture between Newmont of the US and Peru's Buenaventura, is primarily
responsible for this stunning growth. In the first five months of this year,
Yanacocha produced 36.5% of all Peru's gold, representing 9.4 tons of a national
total of 25.8 tons, up 48% over the same period a year ago.

<P>The newly won but little explored Quicay is a disseminated deposit
considered similar to Yanacocha, the US-Peruvian joint venture in the province
of Cajamarca. When it came into production in 1993, it quickly became the
largest and by far the most profitable gold mine in Latin America. This year's
output was officially projected at 650,000 ounces, though this seems certain to
be exceeded. The Quicay site, near Cerro de Pasco, covers 7,400 hectares and is
thought to average some 1.84 grams of gold per metric ton. 
</P>
<P><B><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="CG Times">Deep Pockets. </FONT></B>At the same
time as the Quicay bidding, Barrick, North America's largest gold producer, made
a surprising $670 million offer for the Vancouver-listed Arequipa Resources,
whose main asset is Peru's Pierina gold property. Arequipa Resources, however,
seems to be holding out for a counteroffer in view of recent excavation results
indicating a deposit with 6-7 million ounces and the prospect of 10-12 million
ounces. <BR> 
</P>
<P>The extravagant Barrick offers could reflect disappointment with its Cerro
Corono deposit, also in Cajamarca and close to rival Newmont's Yanacocha. The
Canadian company has been drilling for the past couple of years but has not yet
made the decision to go ahead with development.<BR> 
</P>
<P><B><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="CG Times">More Gold In The Mountains. </FONT></B>The
rest of Peru's gold belt is represented by the underground mines of the Pataz
mining district, 200 miles east of Trujillo along the Maranon river. Way behind
the spectacular Yanacocha but still extremely important, these privately-held
mines are expanding fast and, in some cases, actively seeking risk capital or
associations to fund further exploration.<BR> 
</P>
<P>Minera Aurifera Retamas (Marsa), majority-owned by the reclusive Andres
Marsano, is now Peru's second largest producer. Last year's output was around
four times that of 1990; sales in 1995 reached $41 million. Output for the first
five months of 1996 soared to 1.5 metric tons, 26% higher than the same period
last year. The company is reinvesting heavily to expand its camp facilities and
infrastructure. At 1,000 metric tons a day, Marsa's plant is still at only 80%
of capacity. <BR> 
</P>
<P>Consorcio Horizonte, alongside Marsa in the Pataz gold belt, has also
quadrupled output since 1990. Production last year reached 2.1 metric tons, up
52% from 1994, with sales topping $26 million. Horizonte plans to invest some
$15 million to boost output steeply from the current 750 metric tons a day to
1,200 by late 1997 according to company officials.
<BR> 
</P>
<P>Poderosa, owned by the powerful Aria mining group, is the third Pataz mine.
Current production is 550 metric tons a day with last year's output reaching 2.5
metric tons of fine content. Poderosa is actively seeking risk capital to
finance further expansion. Several potential North American suitors, including
Echo Bay, Sunshine Camber and TVX, have made recent inspection visits. Poderosa
is also building a small subsidiary plant a couple of hours away.
