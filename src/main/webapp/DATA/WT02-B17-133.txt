<H2>A Big Leap Forward for Biomass Gasification</H2>
<P><I>With valuable contributions from all across the nation-frompeople at all levels of government 
working with dedicated individualsfrom private enterprise-the Battelle gasification process surges
ahead.</I>
<P>By Susan Moon, National Renewable Energy Laboratory<P><b>September, 1995</b>
<P><img align=left border=0 hspace=20 vspace=3 src="images/pic2.gif">
A technology that stands at the vanguard of biomass gasificationhas found a home in a state with the 
resources, the leadership,and the track record to prove its merit. Vermont has forests covering80% of 
its land, leaders who vigorously support the value of harvestingwood residues from this home-grown 
energy source, and experienceoperating the nation's largest wood-fired power plant.

<P>That plant, the 
McNeil Generating Station in Burlington, is alsothe site of the first industrial scale-up of Battelle 
ColumbusLaboratory's biomass gasification process. Patrick Leahy, UnitedStates Senator from Vermont, 
has been a long-time project supporter.At groundbreaking ceremonies on August 17 of this year, he 
offeredcongratulations to all. "It was kind of taking a leap offaith in this when I started moving for 
help from the Departmentof Energy and, thank goodness, the Secretary and those in hertop organization 
have been so helpful to us," he said.

<P>Senator Leahy added, "Whether we're talking about gasification
or wind energy or any of the other major energy areas, the federalgovernment can help-at least in the 
development... and once youprove it can be done, you can be on your own. And here's a casewhere we as 
Vermonters can be extremely happy to see somethingthat will work, that uses the renewable resource 
that we have,and cuts dependence on foreign oil. If it works here... it willwork everywhere else in 
this country. We're proving as Vermonters,and with help from the federal government, that if we work 
togetherrather than at cross purposes, all of us benefit."

<P>The Vermont gasifier project is part of a major U.S. Departmentof Energy (DOE) initiative to demonstrate gasification of renewablebiomass for electricity production. The project will integratethe Battelle high-throughput gasifier with a high-efficiency gasturbine. DOE has provided financial and technical support forthe project since 1980 in a variety of ways-by supporting Battelle'sgasifier technology since its inception, by providing technicalexpertise and stewardship through DOE's National Renewable EnergyLaboratory (NREL), and by participating in the McNeil scale-upas a cost-share partner.<P>Karl Rabago, who heads up DOE's Office of Utility Technologies,was clearly pleased to be taking part in the groundbreaking ceremonies."We're here on the verge of a really, really exciting future,"he said. "It's a future in which we can enjoy entirely neweconomic vitality in rural areas and in agricultural productionin this country. It's a future in which our business and our industrycollaborate to make and sell these technologies not just aroundthis country, but all around the world. That future begins withefforts 
like these."

<H3>Planting the Seed in Ohio</H3>

<P>The effort referred to by Rabago began 15 years ago in the agriculturallyand technologically 
fertile valley of central Ohio with Battelle'sinitial investigations of biomass gasification from a 
coal-gas perspective. After all, says Battelle's Mark Paisley, "We'ddone that. Battelle has had 
experience in coal gasification sinceour starting in 1929."

<P>Those early investigations showed that 
wood gasification is muchless troublesome than coal, and that wood is much more reactivethan coal--this 
high reactivity is one of the characteristics ofbiomass in general that make it an excellent feedstock 
for gasificationpurposes. With funding from DOE throughout the process, Battellein 1980 built a pilot 
plant to take advantage of these inherentproperties of biomass and, in 1983, expanded the size of the 
gasifierto 10 inches in diameter and made other improvements, such asautomating the feed system.

<P>"We found that the generation of gas, the characteristicsof what went on, and the throughputs that 
we could get were unique,"says Paisley. During 1983 the substance of the patent was defined
(with Paisley and Herman Feldmann as inventors of patent), andsince then, ongoing experimentation has 
helped to further definewhat the process is all about. The McNeil design will be finetuned from the 
perspective gained from 15 years of meticulousresearch and the resulting solid data base--and Paisley 
is convincedthat this can make the difference between success and failurein Burlington.

<P>Referring to the Battelle gasifier as "high throughput"is no exaggeration. Paisley notes, "The 
upper limit in ourpilot plant is how fast can the feeder be run. It is not the reactor,it is not 
reactivity, it is not residence time--it's the motorwill only go that fast. That really has been our 
limit so far." 

<P>The scale-up design is based on the same throughput (pounds ofbiomass per unit cross 
section of the reactor) as the pilot plant,which means that Paisley, along with others who have been 
monitoring the technology over the years, will be watching with great interestto see if that upper 
limit will be reached in Burlington.

<P>Any kind of gasification is an endothermic, or heat-consuming,
reaction; with Battelle's process, that heat is provided by circulatinghot sand (1800  to 1900 F) 
through the gasifier. "We're literallysurrounding every particle of biomass with hot sand and that 
makes it break down very quickly and produces as much gas as possible,"says Paisley. "In that 10-inch 
gasifier, we're feeding overa thousand pounds of wood an hour. That's one of the reasons theprocess is 
as economical as it is. Burlington's gasifier, forexample, is three and a half feet in diameter. It 
will feed 200tons a day of dry wood. That's 400 tons a day of the green woodas it comes in."

<H3>With Contributions from Colorado</H3>

<P>Based in Golden, Colorado, NREL is a national laboratory responsiblefor facilitating DOE's mission 
with regard to research, development,and implementation of renewable energy technologies. During the
last few years of the1980s, the interest level and funding forbiomass gasification had waned. But the 
picture brightened in1990. As DOE's contract administrator, NREL issued a request forproposals on 
projects involving hot gas cleanup and hot gas conditioning.Battelle was selected to do, primarily, the 
hot gas conditioningwork at its gasifier pilot plant.<P>In the ensuing years, NREL continued to work 
with Battelle throughthis subcontract, which has propelled the overall biomass 
gasification process forward. During this time, the two laboratories have workedclosely on identifying 
catalysts for the hot gas conditioningwork, which is of critical importance because of the presence of 
tars in biogas. These tars constitute only a small componentof biogas, but they can cause large 
problems (e.g., equipmentfouling) during the gas's downstream use. Working together, researchers at 
Battelle and NREL have identified and tested an extremely promisingcatalyst, DN-34.  

<H3>Biogas Powers the Turbine</H3>

<P>The technical advantages of Battelle's biomass gasification 
processversus other comparable technologies offer ample proof that DOE'sinvestment over the years has 
arned major dividends. The Battelleprocess:<P>
<UL> 
<LI>Features an inherently high throughput, which allows for smallerand less costly reactors.
<LI>Incorporates the use of indirect heating, thereby producinga gas with consistent heating value 
regardless of the feedstock'smoisture content. 
<LI>Produces a medium Btu gas--one that is interchangeable with naturalgas--without the added expense 
of an oxygen plant.
<LI>Produces a gas that is free of nitrogen, resulting in a productgas with a higher energy content 
than would be the case if airgasification of biomass were used.
</UL>

<P><img border=0 align=right hspace=15 vspace=3 src="images/gassifier.gif">
All of these factors have allowed biogas production technologyto take a huge and long-awaited 
efficiency leap. As part of Battelle'sgas-conditioning subcontract work with NREL, the next logical
step--or in this case, leap--was to use biogas to power a gas turbine.
Accordingly, biomass industry history was made on June 23, 1994,at Battelle's pilot plant when biogas 
successfully powered a gasturbine--from wood chips to biogas to gas turbine to electricalpower. 
<br clear=all>

<P><img border=0 align=left hspace=15 vspace=3 src="images/mcneil.gif">Solar Turbines, a division of 
Caterpillar, loaned Battelle a standardSpartan&#174; 200 kW natural gas turbine; its only 
modificationis an added parallel fuel line so that either natural gas or productgas can be run. 
The turbine itself is unchanged--the operator simplythrows a switch to go from natural gas to 
biomass-derived gas.

<P>The gasification process--and particularly the Battelle process--getsmore Btus from the wood than 
simply burning the wood, and also captures waste heat for recycling back into the process. A gas 
turbine is much more efficient for power generation than a steamturbine. These factors have propelled 
the Battelle pilot plant toward a net wood-to-electricity efficiency of 35%. For comparison,the net 
efficiency of the current McNeil mode of operation, wherewood chips are burned in a boiler to run a 
steam turbine for electrical power, is on the order of 25%. This 10% efficiency improvement is 
dramatic--especially when one considers that such improvementsare typically measured by a few tenths 
of one percent at a time.

<H3>Two Brothers from Georgia</H3>
<P>No wonder Milton and Glenn Farris are so excited.  These Atlanta brothers are big believers in the 
technology--so big, in fact,that their Future Energy Resources Company, or FERCO, stands readyto 
invest millions of dollars in it. FERCO signed on as Battelle'slicensee in 1992 and will share the cost 
of the scale-up withDOE and the McNeil joint owners.

<P>The Farrises have backgrounds in finance and 
real estate development,which includes energy-related projects such as oil and gas drilling and 
pipeline drilling. By virtue of their father's 45 years ofemployment with Gulf Oil, the brothers grew 
up with an appreciation of the energy business.

<P>Glenn Farris, Project Director for the McNeil scale-up, commentsthat FERCO couldn't pass up the 
opportunity to take advantageof the licenses and patents on Battelle's gasifier technology. FERCO 
likes the technology's potential for applications in thepower industry, the pulp and paper industry, 
and the gasification of biomass fractions from municipal solid waste. "We never looked at it purely 
from the stand point of alternative energy,but as an environmentally friendly technology that produced 
energy."

<P>As Battelle's exclusive licensee for North America, FERCO owns the technology. The company's role 
involves providing up-front risk money--the money that's needed to do the first demonstrationof a 
technology; identifying potential customers for the nextinstallations; and making sure that the best 
interests of thetechnology are being represented through potential conflicts withother technologies. 

<P>Of particular interest to Glenn Farris is that "It's a greatopportunity to work on something that 
could be incredibly important one day. It may sound trite--and don't get me wrong... we expect to make 
bags of money--but there aren't too many opportunities that come along that give one the ability to do 
something that at the end of the road can make a difference--that have a place in the future of energy 
development."

<H3>Vermont's Biomass Energy Vision</H3>
<P>The Farrises found leaders in Vermont's state government who sharethis vision. The state's offices 
in Montpelier are heated withwood-chip power--and have been since the mid-1970s. A state-sponsored
program has enabled schools to install self-contained, fully automated,wood-chip gasifiers that fill 
all heating and hot water needs--andtrim heating bills by up to 80%.

<P>It's readily apparent that Richard Sedano, Commissioner of thestate's Public Service Department, 
relishes discussing the biomasscomponent of Vermont's overall energy plan. "First, we havea sense that 
our economy is greatly affected by how successful our wood industry is. A lot of folks in rural Vermont 
rely onwood harvesting for some of their income. The idea is to promote integrated harvesting--lumber, 
paper, energy--three different linesof products rather than just two--to create a volume of energy 
from wood that will create economies of scale. Those are the kinds of real growth opportunities that 
rural Vermont really needs."

<P>He points out that New Englanders are very interested in air quality--andthe prospect of hastening 
the retirement of some dirty power plantsand replacing them with clean biomass facilities is 
attractive. "I don't have any illusions that we're going to replace the whole kit and caboodle with 
biomass, but to the degree that wecan go from 5% to 20%, that will create a lot easier nut to 
deal with."

<P>Sedano credits the pioneering spirit of the Burlington ElectricDepartment (BED) for its 
installation of the 50-megawatt McNeilwood-fired generating plant in 1984. "It has worked terrifically 
for 11 years," says Sedano, "except that oil pricesdidn't hit $70 a barrel like we had all thought."

<P>Nonetheless, the experience gained from operating this plant--learning about silvicultural practice 
as it relates to energy, what kindof ordering cycles are needed, how to manage fuel contracts between
utilities and the fuel supplier--convinced Sedano and others that
biomass was something Vermont needed to view as a strength. But25% efficiency? "The break for me came 
when I learned about gasification," says Sedano.

<P>Vermont's "Wood Energy Specialist" is in full agreementon that score. Norm Hudson is a 66-year-old, 
lifelong forester who believes that treetops, and other parts of trees not used by loggers, should 
never be wasted. He wants foresters, loggers,and forest landowners to have markets for selling those 
materials--andfor selling their "weed" trees as well. More than this, he wants his fellow Vermonters 
to get full value from forest assets. "Wood-chip gasifiers are efficient and clean burning," says Hudson, "but most people don't understand that. That'swhat I'm about. That's what I do."<P>He makes videos such as "Heating Schools with Wood Chips"and shows them to local Lions and Kiwanis clubs, to townspeople,and to businesses that could profit from gasifier technology.He knows that the gasifier and gas turbine technology representedby the McNeil project is the way of the future... that it mayrevolutionize the way electricity is generated in the world. Hewhispers (yes, whispers), "The wood-fired steam turbine isa dinosaur--we're not going to make those here anymore." Thisis awful knowledge to keep all to yourself, but saying it outloud... well, what would people think?<P>"One of these days, I've got to quit," Hudson says."But I get charged up--almost every day I get some high becauseof what I see happening around me." He says the Burlingtonscale-up will be tiny in comparison to the rest of the plant,but it's going to have close to the wallop of the big one. And he's already planning that video.  

<H3>Coming Together in Burlington</H3>

<P>All the ingredients were in place--an ace technology, a wood-firedpower plant with years of 
successful operation, private investorseager to drive the project, and multiple layers of government
support. So from here, it must have been easy--right?

<P>Well, not quite. A year's worth of tenacity 
was required of allparties involved. To begin with, says Sedano, "In a marketplacewhere there was some risk of overcapacity, where people are retrenchingand regrouping, to try something new is sort of against the grain."<P>McNeil was an ideal situation, says FERCO's Glenn Farris, but"negotiations were an arduous task." <P>Sedano acknowledges that "it was a tough road... and finally,it was the ability of the government and the developer and theutilities to realize that we just needed to talk about it."He says the breakthrough came when the disparate entities finallygot to the point of asking, "How can we do it?" ratherthan just rehashing everything that was "wrong" withit.<P>The McNeil Generating Station is jointly owned by BED, CentralVermont Public Service Corporation, Green Mountain Power Corporation,and the Vermont Public Power Supply Authority. A major impetusin driving the project forward is the joint owners' interest inhaving access to commercially available, clean, efficient, andcost-effective renewable resource generating technologies.

<H3>Construction Begins</H3>

<P>FERCO has designated Zurn NEPCO as the project's Engineering andConstruction firm. In the last 
decade, Zurn has built approximatelyone-third of all the biomass electric facilities in North America.
The company is keenly interested in maintaining its involvementin biomass gasification, especially 
where it concerns advancedconversion technologies (such as the gas turbine component ofthis project).

<P>This industrial scale-up, which is 20 times the size of Battelle'spilot-scale plant, is being 
constructed in three phases. Phase1, which included the design, engineering, and permitting, has
been completed on time and under budget.<P>Under Phase 2, scheduled to last approximately 15 months, a 
400 green ton per day gasifier will be installed and tested. The gasifieroutput will be fired as a 
supplementary fuel in the existing McNeilboiler.<P>Phase 3 will begin after operating experience is 
gained with the gasifier, and specific emissions from product gas combustion aredetermined. Under this 
phase, a gas combustion turbine will be installed to accept product gas from the gasifier and form 
an integral part of a combined-cycle system; the biogas producedshould account for 15 megawatts of the 
plant's current 50-megawatt capacity.  <P>The launching of the gasifier construction phase seems long 
overdue to many of those involved. From Battelle's Mark Paisley: "WhenI was in college and was told it 
took 10 years to develop new technology, I thought the professor was crazy. And now here I am with a 
piece of new technology that's taken 15 years."

<P>He notes that it takes a long time and a lot of resources, pointingout that FERCO has identified 
many companies interested in buildingthe second gasifier system, but only one that was ready to try
the first one. The fact that even one stepped forward speaks tothe risk reduction that DOE funding has 
brought about. With thisfunding, says Paisley, "We have been able to demonstrate not just pieces of 
the technology, but rather an integrated system."

<P>At the project's ground breaking on August 17, 
DOE's Karl Rabago looked out over the crowd of interested onlookers. Many of thoseassembled had 
worked energetically and diligently for many yearsto make the day's events a reality. "We're here 
because ofthe potential of what can and will be done by the collaboration of all these people, this 
wonderful technology, and all the supportwe've seen," he said. 

<P>And, once again, Rabago looked to 
the future. "It's a future in which vital energy... doesn't come at the expense of our environment,
doesn't come with huge price tags for capital investments andfor decommissioning. It doesn't come with 
an enslavement to somebody else's energy supply. We didn't get here by accident. It has taken years of 
long commitment by Senator Leahy and his staff, by peoplein industry and business with vision, and 
yes, even those bureaucrat sat the Department of Energy and the National Renewable EnergyLaboratory, 
to make this event possible. It will take years more commitment. We can't leave the grabbing of this 
golden ring tochance."
