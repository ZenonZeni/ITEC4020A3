Most of us are resigned to lead ordinary lives. Secure in the daily routine of job, commute and the week's laundry, there's no reason to question the balance. There are those who dream of something more: wild secret fantasies of intigue and adventure in some faraway exotic paradise, indulging in the pleasures of life while riding off into the crimson-red sunset. And then there are the select few who live their dreams.	
<BR><BR>Most of us are resigned to the predictable future of growing old with everyone else, with its attendant consequences of Alzheimer's, incontinence and nursing homes. There will be 1 million American centenarians by the year 2040. If your goal is to soar with the eagles--to reach for and grasp a full active life well beyond 100---then you must seek information and act on it before your time is up. And you must realize there is more to this game than diet alone, especially when vested financial interests do not share your goals.	<BR><BR>Since the Industrial Revolution beginning in 1848, Western society has fundamentally altered the biological basis of human existence (diet and environment) from which health arises. Chronic disease is now considered normal. Well people are disappearing.
<BR><BR><B>U.S. Health Care</B>
<BR>Despite its armamentarium of powerful drugs and aggressive treatment strategies, conventional medicine demonstrates scant progress against the growing specter of resistant infections, autoimmune disorders and environmental afflictions of unknown origin.	
<BR><BR>Heart attack patients, after undergoing heroically complex surgical procedures, are served the same abysmal foods that brought them to the hospital in the first place. President Bush was served steak on the night of his heart scare. U.S. soldiers returning from the Persian Gulf War were welcomed back with first-class medical treatment, ice cream and hot dogs. America has the world's most expensive health-care system, yet we rank 16th in life expectancy. No intervention with drugs or surgery can erase a lifetime of self abuse.
<BR><BR>Each year, nearly 400,000 Americans undergo heart bypass surgery for blocked coronary arteries. Most patients believe surgery will correct their problem. However, it is an immutable law of biology that a disease cause dby a detrimental diet cannot be corrected by surgery. We ignore this principle at our peril.	
<BR><BR>Following heart bypass surgery, 50% of bypassed arteries clog up within 5 years. Following balloon agioplasty, 33% of dilated arteries clog up within 4Ð6 months. Each heart bypass operation replaces only 6 inches of an arterial system, but leaves the other 60,000 miles of total length. In most cases, these procedures do not improve survival.	
<BR><BR>By treating symptoms with drugs or surgery while ignoring the underlying cause (diet), treatment often becomes an expensive exercise in futility. During recent doctor strikes in Canada, England, Israel and America, the death rates actually fell. Dubious and mercenary procedures lie at the core of America's health-care crisis.	
<BR><BR>In 1985, the National Research Council recommended that U.S. medical schools include more courses in nutrition. Since that time, the number of medical schools offering nutrition courses has dropped. U.S. medical schools receive large endowments and grants from pharmaceutical companies.
<BR><BR><B>The Practice of Medicine</B><BR>
Most physicians practice early detection or treatment to the exclusion of prevention. Doctors know that a 10% fat diet can prevent or reverse degenerative disease, yet few make this recommendation. There are several possible reasons:
<BR><BR><B>Insurance coverage</B> - there is no realistic reimbursement for nutritional counseling.
<BR><BR><B>Tradition</B> - doctors are not comfortable requiring behavioral change.
<BR><BR><B>Compliance fear</B> - doctors are afraid people won't do anything if the changes are too drastic.
<BR><BR><B>Peer review fear</B> - doctors don't wish to practice differently from their colleagues.
<BR><BR><B>Expectations</B> - patients expect doctors to perform procedures, but successful prevention means no procedures performed.
<BR><BR>Lack of nutrition education - most physicians receive less than 3 hours of nutrition training during medical school.
<BR><BR><B>High-tech training</B> - MDs trained in high-tech procedures think nutrition is beneath them. Real doctors don't talk about food.
<BR><BR><B>Personal eating habits</B> - fewer than 20% of doctors have improved their own diets.
<BR><BR><B>Economics</B> - moderate fat reommendation (20-30% fat) insure the continuing supply of cancer and heart disease patients. Patients generate profit.
<BR><BR><BR><B>Prevention</B>
<BR>The healthiest, longest-lived people on earth have no access to modern medicine. They practice prevention. Profound social changes will occur when it's no longer considered normal to die young. The medical profession, pesticide industry, cattle ranchers and general public all share the same philosophical aspirations for a better world. There is, however, disagreement over the best way to get there.	
<BR><BR>During the 1950s, dentists became so successful in promoting prevention (dental hygiene) that their efforts resulted in fewer cavities, fewer patients and a tougher environment to make a living. Several dental schools have since closed. This economic lesson is not lost on the medical profession.
<BR><BR><B>Dietary Advice</B>
<BR>Despite their education and training, physicians, chiropractors, dietitians and government scientists have a track record of dying from the same degenerative diseases as everyone else, because they have the same diet as everyone else. You can do better.	
<BR><BR>Expert nutritional advice carries an air of reasonableness that often masks deeper, more vexing issues. Everyone, it seems, has a different opinion. At a time when contradictory studies and dueling authorities on both sides are the norm, it's little wonder why controversy prevails.	
<BR><BR>The airwaves are now awash in oat bran commercials, claims, counterclaims and hype--as are we. Wading through the muddled piles gets pretty slippery when droppings of nutritional nuggets lie thick on the ground. The best defense is to realize that dietary advice originating from government agencies and prestigious national institutions is, in fact, economically-driven. As always, the devil is in the details, not the headlines.
<BR><BR><B>Disinformation</B>
<BR>Powerful special interests often influence national organizations. Protect yourself by recognizing corporate tentacles, tactics and marketing practices. Do not gracefully surrender your youth by falling prey to deception. To beat the system, don;t play by the company rules.	<BR><BR>Major industries know quite well that contentious issues are often adjudicated in the court of public opinion. Corporate public relations firms manipulate public opinion using various deceptive practices.  Corporations often hire "third party" scientists to argue their case before the media. They represent themselves as independent and objective institutions, yet their positions closely follow those of their sponsors:
<BR>In 1990, the National Dairy Board hired a PR firm to promote growth hormones in milk. 
<BR>The California Department of Agriculture claims that counties with the highest exposure to pesticides have the lowest breast cancer rates. This position conflicts with current evidence. 
<BR>The Ad Council's Partnership for a Drug-Free America receives funding from the alcohol, tobacco and pharmaceutical industries. Consequently their public-service ads ingore America's real drug problems, caused by legal prescription drugs.
<BR>Monsanto Corporation, which ranks among the 10 worst polluters, recently joined Earth Day USA and Business for Social Responsibility.
<BR>The American Council on Science and Health (funded by Burger King) promotes fast foods.
<BR><BR><B>Dietary Components</B>
<BR>The U.S. holds the dubious distinction of consuming more meat than any other nation, with 70% of its protein from animal sources. Less fortunate nations forego that luxury and their low chronic disease rates contrast sharply with ours.
<BR><BR>There's a parallel between our nation and the Roman Empire: the Romans ate themselves to death. Emperor Claudius I regularly served banquets of port-stuffed sea urchins, roast deer, jellyfish, flamingo and parrot. The Roman upper class suffered from lead poisoning because their aqueducts, water pipes, wine vessels and glazed cooking pots all contained lead. Meanwhile, the poorer folks enjoyed good health by doing without banquets and lead pipes.	
<BR><BR>Lest one believe that such indiscretions are a quaint oddity of the less enlightened and distant past, consider the billions spent by industrialized nations in waging war on degenerative disease (cancer, heart disease, osteoporosis) afflictions rare in developing countries.
<BR><BR><B>Informed Choices</B>
<BR>Health does not spring from magic bullets or soundbites. Modern diseases of affluence arise primarily from dietary exess, not deficiency. The notion of excess doesn't sit well in corporate circles since it doesn't sell products. 	
<BR><BR>To focus on products while ignoring the underlying cause is a formula ripe with failure. Isolated nutrients are not substitutes for the thousands of undiscovered essential components which whole foods likely contain. And isolated nutrients are no substitute for changing the diet either.	
<BR><BR>Studies report that increasing fruit and vegetable intake can cut cancer and heart disease risk by 35-50%. Therein lies the seeds of dangerous advice: that the way to counteract dietary intemperance is to eat more of something else. The underlying cause (excess fat and protein) is seldom addressed due to aggressive marketing by the meat and dairy industries.	
<BR><BR>In America, health is a business and most businesses operate by giving the public what they want. National institutions advocate 30% fat diets, while assuming anything less is "unrealistic and culturally unacceptable." Such cosmetic advice is arrogant. Consumers have a right to the information they need to make informed choices.	
<BR><BR>No one wants their life cut short. No one wants to waste away in a nursing home as a stagnant pond of body fluids, bedsores and clogged conduits tethered to an IV pole. Immunity from chronic illness requires building a fortress of knowledge, hardened against the vagaries of artful deception, ornamental government recommendations and deeply-instilled aberrations that corporations would have you believe.

<A NAME="Ultimate"</A><H1>The Ultimate Cure: The Healing Energy Within You</H1>
<H3>by Jim Dreaver, D.C.</H3>
<IMG SRC="rbline.gif">
<BR><BR><FONT SIZE= 4>
All healing stems from the fundamental spiritual energy of life itself, the beauty and power that is the source of creation. This energy is a rich and vibrant reality that can be accessed in every moment. It is experienced in the body as aliveness and joy, in the heart as peace and love, and in the mind as clarity and wisdom. The more you open to it, the more it heals, renews, and transforms every aspect of your life. 	
<BR><BR>How to connect with this energy is the subject of my just-released book, <I>The Ultimate Cure: The Healing Energy Within You</I>. The theme of the book--and the goal, or "ultimate cure," of the healing journey--is to discover the happiness that is your true nature, that is the direct manifestation of the source energy within you. 	
<BR><BR>This happiness is completely independent of circumstances. Once you're in touch with it, everything takes on new meaning. Physical pain and illness either clear up completely, or become much more tolerable. Psychological and emotional  conflict fall away. You no longer worry about anything, or struggle to make things happen. You're more in tune with the deeper creative rhythm of life. You begin to discover for yourself that when your intention is clear and you have no attachment to outcomes, things happen very quickly. Your relationships become richer and more satisfying. Life in general is more spontaneous, more effortless, and more truly rewarding on all levels.	
<BR><BR>How do you get to this place, where you live each day in the "flow"? Here are the three elements that I have found to be most important:	
<BR><B>FIRST</B>, and foremost, you must learn to be very present, grounded, and centered in your body. Tapping into the source of inner peace and happiness is so much easier when you're relaxed and comfortable in your body. Slow, deep, conscious breathing--all the way down into your belly--is an excellent technique for releasing physical stress and tension. Movement and exercise are very important too. I love to do yoga and run along the country roads near where I live. The secret is to learn how to move your own energy, so that it doesn't stay stuck or contracted.	
<BR><BR><B>SECOND</B>, your heart must be open. This means being sensitive to what you're feeling. It's allowing space for your emotions to be there. It's practicing self-acceptance, not judging yourself for the mistakes you've made. It's accepting, feeling, your own suffering, and being open to the lesson in it. (Once you get the lesson, you won't have to go through that particular form of suffering again). Then it's extending self-forgiveness out to others, especially those who have wounded you. 	
<BR><BR>When people do hurtful things, it's because, at a heart level, they're completely unconscious. They're out of touch with the source, with the underlying unity, beauty, and sacredness of life. Their souls are crying out. People who wound others are themselves very wounded. Only through compassion and forgiveness are these deep wounds healed.	<BR><BR>The <B>THIRD</B> component of this threefold approach to transformation has to do with quieting and clearing the mind--and, ultimately, getting free of the grip of ego, of the attachment to "I," "me," and "mine." Meditation teaches you to dispassionately witness, or observe, the thoughts, images, and sensations that arise in your awareness. This in itself is an incredibly liberating skill. It gets you unhooked from the ever-changing drama and chaos of worldly and mind/body phenomena, and brings you to ease, clarity, spaciousness. You start to tap into the deeper spiritual energy that is always here.	
<BR><BR>Then you can begin to observe the "observer," this "self" you've taken yourself to be. Enlightenment is simply living without any self-image or self-concept. It's to live from the openness and spontaneity of your being. You still have an ego, but it becomes much more transparent. It doesn't get in the way. When you stop holding onto any image of your self (even as a "spiritual seeker") an enormous amount of energy is released. Your real beauty and magnificence start to shine through.

<A NAME="Tachyon"</A><H1>Future Tachyon Energy Brings Better Health Today</H1>
<H3>by Coleen Rehm</H3>
<IMG SRC="rbline.gif">
<BR><BR><FONT SIZE= 4>

<P></P><I>"Physicists John Wheeler and Richard Feynman calculated that there is enough energy in the vacuum of a single light bulb to boil all the seas."
</I>OMNI, February 1991

<P></P>I first heard tachyon energy mentioned on <I>Star Trek: The Next Generation</I>, little realizing modern technology had advanced so much that this space-age energy is available today. For over a decade now, people have reaped benefits from Takionic<SUP>R</SUP> Original Tachyon Products--for everything from pain relief and improved athletic ability to enhanced mental acuity. The list of top athletes, leading healers and other professionals who use these products reads like a modern-day <I>Who's Who</I>: Sheri Howard (three-time Olympian), Barbara Brennan, Dr. Gary Null (health advocate and author) and Curtis Sliwa (founder of the Guardian Angels) among others.
	<P></P><P></P>On a recent NBC television show, <I>The Other Side</I>, host Dr. Will Miller illustrated (to his amazement!) how wearing a Takionic¨ belt dramatically increased his weight-lifting ability in only minutes.
	<P></P><P></P>Tachyon energy exists naturally in space and in the air we breathe. It's an environmentally sound resource that's virtually impossible to deplete. The biggest challenge has always been finding ways to harness it for ready use.
	<P></P><P></P>Twenty years of research, development and testing resulted in the creation of a unique, highly complex, patented silica-ceramic composite (known as Optimum Resonant Materials<SUP>TM</SUP>) that can only be found in the Takionic line of products, such as Takionic belts, beads, wrist bands and insoles.
	<P></P><P></P>This unique compound of Optimum Resonant Materials<SUP>TM</SUP> simultaneously attracts tachyon energy and focuses photon (light) energy from the particular wavelength of sunlight that's essential to good health.
	<P></P><P></P>The most unique benefit of these products is their ability to restore order from chaos. Stress of any kind (pollution, poor diet, electromagnetic radiation, lack of sunlight) creates water clustering in the body, decreasing water's permeability through body cells, tissues and organs. 
	<P></P>This traps water in cells and tissues, resulting in poor micro-circulation that reduces the body's ability to absorb oxygen and vital nutrients, and remove toxins and waste products.
	<P></P>According to research done by Professor Toyoda at the National University of Shiga in Japan, Optimum Resonant Materials<SUP>TM</SUP> increase permeability and molecular organization of water in the body, breaking up large water clusters, to maximize micro-circulation and improve delivery of oxygen and nutrients through blood and tissues. Scientific research shows this results in up to 90% faster recovery from muscle fatigue, increased physical and mental well-being, and improved focus and concentration (20-30% increase in test scores in double-blind studies). These products also balance energy flows, contributing to the harmony and integration of various energy fields (physical to spiritual).
	<P></P>The benefits of this technology are individualized to those who wear them. For example, S. Priebe, a radiation therapist in Idaho Falls, suffered from a circulatory disorder (Raynaud's syndrome), a heart murmur and fibrosystis in both shoulders. Within an hour of wearing Takionic beads, she felt a warm flush and ". . .an incredibly relaxed, peaceful, light feeling. My heartbeat calmed and evened out. I'm able to exercise my arms and not suffer excruciating pain in my shoulders."
	<P></P>Dr. Andrew Ptak, a chiropractor with lumbar scoliosis, used a Takionic bead patch and his anatomically shorter leg straightened our in 5 seconds, lengthening to perfectly match his right! X-rays later revealed the curvature in his lumbar reduced 7 millimeters in one hour, and computerized muscle testing (using the Digital Myograph) showed all-over muscle improvement, but "the greatest improvement was with my lower back and hip--strengthened 528%!"
	<P></P>As Thomas Edison said, "The doctor of the future will give no medicine, but interest his patient in the care of the human frame, in diet and in the cause and prevention of disease."
	<P></P>These stories can give you an idea of the benefits you might reap using these amazing products. But to fully appreciate this technological breakthrough, you've got to experience if for yourself.
