<h1 align="center"><font size="6"><b>The NYSE Rate of Change</b></font></h1>

<p>This month we are presenting a new type of chart. I do not
recall having seen this type of analysis done elsewhere but the
chart is definitely revealing.</p>

<p><img src="../images/ROC996.gif" align="left" hspace="12"
width="382" height="280">While contemplating different ways of
analyzing the stock market data, I began thinking about how we
analyze interest rate data and realized that we could apply some
of the same analyses to the stock market.</p>

<p>When we look at the stock market data we typically look at the
index itself. We see it rising or falling but we don&#146;t get
an accurate picture of how much it is actually rising or falling. </p>

<p>However, when we look at inflation data we typically ignore
the index itself and concern ourselves more with the rate of
change since last year. We say inflation is up 2.88% since last
year and don&#146;t really care what the actual index is. Since
we at <font size="4" face="Monotype Corsiva">Financial Trend
Forecaster</font> specialize in tracking and predicting the
inflation rate, you our subscribers should be much more familiar
with the Consumer Price Index than the average person&#151;so
here is a brief quiz: Without looking at the back page&#151;Is
last month&#146;s Index? (on a 1982-1984 basis)</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>A) 471 </p>
    <p>B) 157 or </p>
    <p>C) 1057 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The correct answer is B), however, if you answered A) you were
correct on the 1967 basis (<i>i.e.,</i> something that cost $1.00
in 1967 will cost $4.71 today). The point is that we are not
usually concerned with the actual index&#151;simply with how much
it has increased since last year.</p>

<p>The same should be true of the stock market. Do we really care
if the market is at 360 or 4900 or 20,000? Actually that depends
on whether we are looking at the NYSE, the Dow or the Nikkei Dow.
In the final analysis the actual number itself is meaningless.
What really matters is the rate of change over the last day,
week, month, year or over the period you have been holding it.</p>

<p>Our NYSE Rate of Change Chart (ROC) calculates the increase
(or decrease) in the NYSE Index over the past year and figures it
as a percentage of the previous year&#146;s index. If
&quot;A&quot; represents last year&#146;s index and &quot;B&quot;
represents this year&#146;s index then the formula for any annual
rate of change is (B-A)/A.</p>

<p>Several previously difficult to discern factors become readily
apparent when looking at this chart.</p>

<p>The first is that there have been several brief periods when
it was possible to earn 30-40% returns or more.</p>

<p>There have also been years when it was possible to lose
30-40%. </p>

<p>With a bit of thinking we can see that as a market rises
rapidly the rate of return also rises rapidly, but as the market
levels off the ROC begins to <b><i>fall</i></b>. This is a very
important concept to keep in mind. If the market rises 10% the
first month and then stays flat, the longer the flat period lasts
the lower the total return. Obviously, a year long flat period
results in a zero return for that year (as represented by the
horizontal center line). </p>

<p>The ROC chart makes it easy to see when the rate of return is
falling. This does not mean that you are losing money, simply
that you are earning less. This could mean that the market has
leveled off, that it is not growing as fast as it was, or, of
course, that the market is actually falling.</p>

<p>The opposite situation is where the market has been flat for
the last 11 months and is now up 10% this month. Obviously, as
the rate of return is increasing we want to be in the market.
This particular situation would be signaled by an upturn in a
line that was approaching zero.</p>

<p>Another factor to keep in mind is that in order to compound
your gains you have to take them. If you make 20% one year and
loose 20% the next, you have done worse than break even. You have
actually lost! (100 plus 20%= 120 but 120 minus 20% is only 96.)
So over the two year period your total return is a negative 4%.</p>

<p>Therefore, by following the ROC chart we can easily tell when
the market is producing a positive return and when it is losing
ground. The ROC makes it especially easy to spot market
reversals.</p>

<p>In a nutshell&#151;when the ROC is rising (even from below
zero) we want to be in the market and we want to be out when it
is falling. A fall from above zero indicates a market that has
risen in the recent past but is now flat or falling. A fall below
zero is a declining market. </p>

<p>A rise from below zero indicates a reversal from a declining
market. Remember in order to earn the 30% at the peak you have to
have been in the market for the entire previous year. </p>

<p>In the RSI chart we see the NYSE in a sideways channel since
January, consequently the ROC has been falling and has even
crossed below its 12 month moving average. Since it has moved
from the bottom of the channel to the top the return is still
about 10% but we would not want to ride it down to zero!</p>

<h2 align="center"><font size="4"><b>NYSE (RSI) and Moving
Average</b></font></h2>

<p><img src="../images/NYSERSI996.gif" align="left" hspace="12"
width="447" height="362">The relative strength is very close to
overbought again indicating another peak may be in the making. In
addition, the overhead resistance of the channel should stop the
current rebound unless the market finds a lot more strength
somewhere. The key we need to watch at this point is how high the
RSI goes&#151;will it just touch the over bought line and
reverse? Or ... will it barely cross or ... strongly cross? If it
does not cross, it will show a definite weakening of the overall
market setting up for a big decline. However, if it replays last
September&#151;we would be in for more growth. This is not very
likely since the peaks have been getting progressively lower.</p>

<p><img src="../images/NYSEma996.gif" align="left" hspace="12"
width="428" height="298">The NYSE is above its moving average but
has tested both the 1 month and 6 month averages (see circles).
This increased volatility is a sign for caution but the moving
average has not yet flashed a sell signal.</p>

<p>The combined ROC, RSI and moving average signals indicate
caution and that the return is declining. <b><i>Once again, we
are probably within 10% of the top.</i></b></p>

align="left" hspace="0" width="242" height="311"></b></font><font
size="4"><b> </b></font>Despite all the talk and worry about
inflation resuming Gold has done very poorly this year with the
market peaking the first week of February. Both representatives
for the FED and Treasury Secretary Rubin himself have been saying
for months that inflation was not a problem. The market has been
disregarding their comments since they often prove to be smoke.
But recently their comments have been on target. </p>

<p>We have seen the RSI making lower peaks and it has just broken
down through its 3 month support line. However, RSI will probably
make a higher low just touching the 30% oversold line with the
price not breaking below July&#146;s low. This would set the
stage for the rebound due around October&#146;s end. Our one
caution is that Rubin has said recently that the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) may be selling Gold soon to finance a
reduction in debt for &quot;some of the world&#146;s poorest
nations.&quot; </p>

latest plunge almost to the oversold line has provided the
opportunity for a final bounce up to overbought. This will
probably be our exit signal and should correspond with
Gold&#146;s plunge to oversold. This peak should exceed
August&#146;s peak and take BTTTX into the $23-24 range.</p>

<p><font size="4"><b><img src="../images/GvB996.gif" align="left"
hspace="12" width="446" height="305"></b></font>The ratio has
been favoring Bonds for the last few weeks. Last month I
mentioned there was a distinct possibility of a
&quot;whipsaw&quot; effect. As predicted it has crossed back
below the 4 week moving average giving us that whipsaw. We have
not yet crossed the 8 week average but the timing of the crossing
will probably correspond with the ratio turning up favoring Gold,
thus giving us another whipsaw in the opposite direction. It is
unfortunate that we could not play this most recent rise. Even
though both RSI and the moving average predicted it, it was
simply too short a move for a monthly newsletter or even for the
weekly hotline. As we said last month the best we can hope for is
to average into Gold at a good price.</p>

<p><font size="4"><b><img src="../images/MIP996.gif" align="left"

on the money again this month with a predicted very slight down
trend. Next month should be flat to slightly down and the
following month should be down a bit steeper. That will be
October&#146;s data which will be released in November. The
coming uptrend will still only last about 3 months but at this
point it looks fairly steep providing a short term profit
potential. </p>

<p>There are two outside factors (which Dr. Moore referred to as
Abnormally Severe Market Aberrations) that may affect the
outcome. The first is the possible IMF Gold Sales which could
flatten out this entire peak. The second would be an increase in
tensions with IRAQ which could aggravate the increase and
multiply the profit potential of Gold. Both of these factors are
outside the scope of technical analysis but we should be aware of
their effects and be prepared for those possibilities.</p>

Silver or possibly Gold.</p>

is the final portion of this up thrust, the price has not made
new highs and we are probably in for a sizable decline. If,
however, we see a drop in the RSI to halfway to the midpoint and
then another rise to overbought&#151;as in March and April, we
could extend the Bull market a bit more. </p>

Select Transports provides our most interesting relative strength
chart this month. As we can see, it entered deep into oversold
territory in July and did not have the strength to muster a
rebound above midpoint. In September it once again crossed
oversold but by a much smaller margin. This provides a good
positive divergence between lines &quot;A&quot; and
&quot;B&quot;. All that is necessary is a strong break through
line &quot;C&quot;. Transports are dependent on Energy (see
Energy RSI). Some of the recent weakness may be the result of the
market's inflation fears and tensions in the mid-east. But ...
based strictly on RSI Transports look promising. </p>

since then it has been basically sideways. Our RSI signaled

weaker and were the process of working out the strength exhibited
December - April. Of course we could see a couple of more spikes
up (especially if Mid-East tensions accelerate), but the energy

must watch the RSI for the next few weeks to determine whether
this is true strength like March-August, 1995, or the end like
May, 1996. It is probably the latter but since we have just come
off an oversold point like July it is possible to go either way.</p>

<h2 align="center"><font size="4"><b>Overall Indicators</b></font></h2>

<p>Overall the market looks more like a top than a new buying
opportunity. Most charts are in overbought territory with the
exception of Transportation. The ROC is headed down and the
moving average has been crossed downward twice in recent months.
All the pieces continue to point toward caution.</p>

<h2 align="center"><font size="4"><b>Updates</b></font></h2>

<p>In January our Aggressive Portfolio gave a buy signal for
individual Bonds based upon the RSI at the time. Ann Taylor
(AAN.F) recently traded at $96.25 up from $83 in January. This is
an increase of 16% in 8 months. This is in addition to the
approximately 9% you have earned in interest payments. A nice
annualized 37.5%. Hechinger on the other hand is &quot;only&quot;
up about 10% and has yielded about 10% interest for an annualized
30%.</p>

<p>Other recommendations: July&#146;s AMD @ $11 is currently $14
3/8 and Valujet (VJET), which we recommended at $11, but by the
time you got the newsletter you could have bought it for $9.50,
is currently at $12 1/8.</p>

<p>Iomega (IOMG), which we projected would fall from $30 in June
is currently $15 for 50% profit in three months! And is below our
target of $18 so you should take profits. However, its P/E is
still about 50 so it is still overpriced!</p>

<p>The only loser on the list is June&#146;s Syquest (SYQT) which
has become even more of a bargain by falling from $9 to $6 3/8,
.even though electronics as a whole are over bought.</p>
