<h2 align=center>January 1997 Quarterly Update - Our View of the Market </h2>
<hr>
<p><b>Portfolio Manager's Corner - Risk Management Individual Funds and Variable Annuities</b></p>
<p><b>Domestic Equities - </b>OMNI has proven to be on target with the re-entry signal generated August 2nd. The Lipper Mid Cap 
Index has surged ahead 9.21% as of December 31st, with the Lipper Growth and Income Fund charging ahead 12.55%. As 
in 1995, the Energy, Banking, and Semiconductor sectors have led the way, benefiting from their ability to impose their pricing 
power on the consumer.</p>
<p>As we moved into the fourth quarter, LBS' proprietary systems were indicating the market was poised to move 5-7% higher. 
Interest rates were on the decline, and the overall sentiment of the market was constructive. Ours was cautious optimism, 
however, as earnings season was once again upon us.</p>
<p>The Dow broke through the 6,000 barrier for the first time on October 14th, as earnings ranged from in-line to better than 
expected. The overriding concern for the market remained the tenuous control over Congress held by the Republican party. 
This concern led to increased jockeying by portfolio managers, and the market held in a tight trading range through the 
election.</p>
<p>The election results brought relief to the financial markets, as Republicans were able to maintain control of the Congress. This 
resulted in a drastic increase in trading activity, as well as a tremendous volatility breakout to the upside. Heavy short covering 
fueled the breakout, and the equity market played catch-up with the bond market. Investors were looking for liquidity, and 
large capitalization stocks were the recipient of heavy inflows. A gap began to develop between the S&amp;P 500 index and the 
Frank Russell 2000, a broader-based index. This divergence is typical of a market which may be on the last legs of a rally. 
However, the market continued to exhibit upward momentum.</p>
<p>Alan Greenspan wrecked havoc on the psyche of the market in early December, as he wondered aloud how we would know 
when investors were exhibiting &quot;irrational exuberance&quot;. Perhaps when all regard to inherent market risk is discounted? Despite 
Mr. Greenspan's musings on the rationality of the markets, the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee elected to leave 
interest rates unchanged. This news was digested well by the exchanges, and we continued to probe the upper resistance 
levels.</p>
<p>As we head into the New Year, we remain cautiously optimistic. The market has formed a &quot;double-top&quot;, and interest rates 
have begun to rise. In general, the equity markets have moved inversely to interest rates. Caution, vigilance, and a disciplined 
approach will be the keys to navigating a potentially volatile 1997.</p>
<p><b>International Equities - </b>LBS remained headed into the fourth quarter fully invested in both international equity categories. 
Many international indices were at all-time highs heading into the quarter, with several European bourses exhibiting particular 
strength. The Eurotop 100 index (similar to the S&amp;P 500) advanced 20% in 1996, benefiting from slow growth and strong 
bond markets. The bond market was fueled by nations running budget deficit reduction programs to comply with the 
standards set for the pending European Monetary Union. London's FTSE 100 Index returned 22.1% in dollar terms.</p>
<p>Asia did not fully participate in the international rally. In fact, Japan was down 16.2% in dollar terms, and has sustained 
several 2%+ daily losses. LBS exited the Asia Pacific category on December 19th, and as we go to press the Nikkei Index 
has broken down through the 19,000 support level.</p>
<p><b>Utilities, Gov't Bonds, Muni Bonds, Int'l Bonds</b> - We entered the fourth quarter fully invested in all bond categories. The 
yield on the 30 year long bond tumbled as traders began to discount any possibility of the Fed hiking interest rates. A slowing 
economy, as evidenced by the 2.1% annual increase in 3rd quarter GDP (this versus the 4.8% seen in the second quarter) 
and rising unemployment figures were the impetus for the declining yield. Labor costs have not increased as rapidly as in the 
past, which helped keep inflation moderate.</p>
<p>Utilities, which normally presage activity in the bond market, staged a nice rally in late October. The bond market, however, 
was focused on the pending election. The Republicans were able to hold their majority in Congress, and the bond market 
celebrated, driving the yield on the long bond down to 6.46%, a thirty basis point drop from the first day of the quarter.</p>
<p>December saw a marked increase in the volatility of the bond market. December 11th brought rumors from London of waning 
Japanese demand for our bonds (the Japanese are by far the biggest foreign owners of our debt securities). LBS exited all 
interest related categories on the heels of this news, with the exception of high yield bonds, which continue to show incredible 
resiliency. We move into the new year with bonds at a critical juncture. We remain on the sidelines, with a readiness to 
re-enter these categories should fourth quarter economic growth be softer than anticipated.</p>
<p><b>Gold - </b>LBS entered the fourth quarter as we had the third, in the safety of money markets. This market was suffering from a 
marked malaise, and was having trouble finding any legs. Given the deterioration earlier in the year (most of which LBS had 
sidestepped), our system was looking for any signs of strength. Again, the pending election seemed to affect this highly volatile 
and illiquid market. </p>
<p>Just after the election, the gold market seemed to bottom. LBS re-entered the gold market on November 13th. This entry was 
met with a quick uptick in prices, but the market never truly found its legs. European central banks are rumored to be selling 
heavily, regardless of their effect on the market. The seeming lack of inflation was also contributing to the continued troubles of 
this market. We move into the first quarter with a sell signal pending.</p>
<p><b>Int'l Maximizer - </b>This portfolio remains invested in Europe, which has outperformed the Asia Pacific area (see above). </p>
<p><b>Domestic Maximizer</b> - These portfolios have retained their large market capitalization bias, which has served us extremely 
well over the past quarter. Investors have been making the flight to liquidity, and this has bolstered the valued of large cap 
stocks<font size=2>.</font> &#160;</p>
