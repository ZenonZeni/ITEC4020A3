SALE OF HERCULES' FIRM UPSETS SEMITECH

by Lucy Reilly
Sematech officials are attempting to block the anticipated sale
of a key U.S. company to Nippon Sanso of Japan, claiming the sale
would violate a proprietary and confidential information
contract.

Nippon subsidiary Matheson Gas Products Inc. wants to purchase
Semi-Gas Systems Inc., a subsidiary of Wilmington, Del.-based
Hercules Inc. With sales of $20 million last year, Massachusetts-
based Semi-Gas is the largest supplier of gas handling equipment
to the semiconductor industry worldwide, Hercules officials said.

"Sematech feels very strongly that it is against the best
interests of the U.S. semiconductor industry and the nation as a
whole for Semi-Gas Systems to be sold to a foreign competitor
whose apparent intentions are worldwide market domination," wrote
Turner Hasty, executive vice president and chief operating
officer of Sematech, in a letter last week to David
Hollingsworth, chairman of Hercules.

Sematech is concerned that a final sale would provide inside
information on Sematech strategies to Nippon, thereby harming
national security and divulging proprietary U.S. technology
information. Semi-Gas and Sematech have been collaborating for
more than two years on technical development projects.

"Unauthorized disclosure of this information or any improper
attempts to obtain access to it will cause Sematech irreparable
harm," Hasty wrote.

Sematech General Counsel Robert Falstad, in a similar letter last
week to Nippon's legal team in New York City, wrote, "Hercules
Inc. and Semi-Gas Systems are not at liberty to disclose this
information to any third parties, including Matheson Gas Products
and/or Nippon Sanso, without Sematech's prior written consent."

Sematech is a joint government/industry consortium with 14
corporate members. The $250-million consortium receives half of
its funding annually from the Defense Department's Defense
Advanced Research Projects Agency.

"I want to express my deep disappointment with your intentions to
sell Semi-Gas Systems to a foreign company," Hasty wrote. "In his
Jan. 10 letter, Dr. Sam Harrell, president of Semi/Sematech Inc.,
told you of our concern about the proposed sale of Semi-Gas
Systems, particularly to a foreign concern. We offered to work
with Hercules to help you find an American buyer for Semi-Gas
Systems. We did not even receive the courtesy of an
acknowledgement of Dr. Harrell's letter.

"We understand that Hercules Inc. has refused to consider a
leveraged buyout by Semi-Gas Systems management that would have
enabled it to remain an American company," Hasty continued. "The
interests of the U.S. Department of Defense may be affected by
any sale of Semi-Gas Systems to a foreign buyer. Accordingly, we
believe that appropriate agencies of the U.S. government will
review the propriety of this proposed transaction."

BABY BELLS BATTLE BIG BUSINESS: Regional Phone Cos. Undertake
`Misinformation Campaign'

by Lucy Reilly
The seven regional Bell companies are waging a "disinformation
campaign" in an effort to alter federal policy by arguing that
the nation's telecommunications industry is becoming second rate
to international competitors, charges a group of large U.S.
corporations.

Fourteen powerful firms, operating under the banner of the Ad Hoc
Users Committee, submitted their claims to the Department of
Commerce's National Telecommunications and Information
Administration recently. The committee blasted statements from
the Bell holding companies that other nations are surpassing the
United States in network modernization programs because of
regulatory and structural impediments in the United States.

"These arguments are nothing more than an attempt by the RBHCs to
build a case for expansion of their present monopolistic
positions to include services from which they are now restricted
and to use their positions to reap even greater financial rewards
than they have to date," the committee told NTIA.

"In short, far from being second rate, the United States
telecommunications infrastructure is unsurpassed by any other in
the world," the committee's report states. "There is absolutely
no basis for believing that existing regulatory policies and
practices have impeded maintenance and improvement of the
domestic telecommunications infrastructure. The United States is
investing in its telecommunication's infrastructure at rates of
23 to 92 percent higher than in Japan and the major European
nations."

The committee includes Aetna Life and Casualty Co., American
Airlines Inc., American Express Co., Boeing Computer Services,
Electric Data Systems Corp., Ford Motor Co., General Electric
Co., Honeywell Corp., IBM Corp. Monsanto Co., Online Computer
Library Center, J.C. Penney Co., Procter & Gamble Co., and Sears
Roebuck & Co.

The Ad Hoc Committee submitted its claims along with 120 other
groups this spring in response to a notice of inquiry published
by NTIA regarding a comprehensive study on the domestic
telecommunications infrastructure.

The majority of respondents want to revise the nation's
telecommunications policy. In particular, an abundance of state
governments and small companies filed wish lists for introducing
and improving the use of fiber-optic networks to rural areas.
States that filed extensive plans for comprehensive networks
include Minnesota, Tennessee and Washington.

Many submissions proposed plans for improving technological gaps
or enhancing local medical and educational programs. However,
comments by the nation's large corporations focused more on
controversial federal policies which regulate the industry.

Such policies "are burdens and critical liabilities to the U.S.
position in the global economy," wrote the National Center for
Telecommunications and Information Policy, the research and
political analysis division of the Public Service Satellite
Consortium.

"Until U.S. policymakers come to terms with these facts, both the
future of the U.S. industrial base and critical constitutional
protections embedded in our political culture will be placed in
continuing jeopardy," the division's report states.

Contrasting the Ad Hoc Committee's comments, the strongest plea
to loosen existing regulations was filed in a joint submission by
the Regional Bell Holding Cos., Southern New England Telephone
Co. and Cincinnati Bell Telephone Co.

Other nations "are leapfrogging us by focusing on their own
future telecommunications needs and adopting policies to meet
these needs, whether the United States remains in the game or
not," the joint report states.

The phone companies argue that the use of private networks can
have unfair advantages for corporations using them. Private
networks can be designed to have excess circuitry. Operators of
these networks would then be in a position to resell switching or
line capacity to outside clients. Sears, Westinghouse, Merrill
Lynch, Northwest Airlines and Federal Express have spun off
telecommunication subsidiaries to do just that, the phone
companies's report notes.

The joint report urges NTIA to favor abandonment of the AT&T
Consent Decree and several other regulations in favor of
"forward-looking public policies," including:

 *  the establishment of depreciation rates that reflect the
    reality of technological change;
 *  the adoption of incentive regulations; and
 *  the elimination of cable cross-ownership restrictions, which
    ban local exchange carriers from offering video programs in
    their own territories.

AT&T agreed that policy changes are needed to end regulation of
the industry. Moreover, AT&T's comments to NTIA stated that the
U.S. government should foster competition abroad, promote
standard setting for interconnection and interoperation of
networks, adopt price-caps similar to what British Telecom did
several years ago and foster domestic research and development.

However, "the assertions that the nation's telecommunication
industry is `second best' and `falling behind' other nations are
nonsense," AT&T's report states. "This system has been planned
and built by private enterprise, not by the government, and
national telecommunications policy has been to place maximum
reliance on competition and market forces for three decades.

"Indeed, since the competitiveness policy was fully implemented
with the [divestiture of the Bell system in 1982], the
telecommunications industry has experienced economic growth,
technological innovation, and benefitted...users [which
is]...virtually unprecedented in American economic history,"
AT&T's report continues. "The decision was thus a necessary and
logical step and, indeed, the watershed event in implementing the
longstanding national competitiveness policy."

The National Cable Television Association expressed its concern
that the NTIA announcement suggested the adoption of mandatory
investment in a network to be funded by higher monthly telephone
rates levied on all citizens.

"Such a policy would create serious inefficiencies in the
delivery of telecommunications services and end up costing
average consumers billions of dollars for plant and equipment
designed to deliver services that they neither want nor need,"
the cable association wrote.

CONGRESS LEVITATES OVER MAGLEV
by Kimberly Dozier

Another magnetic levitation bill has been launched in Congress,
this one by Rep. Robert Mrazek (D-N.Y.), a member of the House
Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation.

At a news conference last Wednesday, Mrazek said that if the
United States does not have its own maglev system designed and
ready to be put in place in the next three years, foreign
competitors will fill the void.

Mrazek's bill calls for $50 million in the 1991 transportation
budget for a national design competition to set the standard for
domestic maglev systems. The program would be managed by a maglev
administration set up within the Department of Transportation.
This group would establish minimum health, safety and
environmental standards for the industry, and establish safety
rules and regulations.

The $50 million would be the preliminary portion of $350 million
to be awarded to no more than six finalists in the design
competition, with an additional $600 million to be given out to
build a prototype system. The second-phase funding would be
available to any state or local government, public-private
consortium or any combination of government or private entities.
The prototype, at least 40 miles long, must comply with the
federally selected design standard and demonstrate the commercial
viability of the technology.

The funds are not meant to be the bread and butter of maglev R&D,
but a way to entice the domestic defense and aerospace industry
into joining the program. Maglev is seen by many as one of the
financial saving graces for defense contractors as they face a
decline in large military projects. Few industries, however, are
willing to risk R&D on what would be a radical departure from
today's transportation system without government leadership and
at least token financial support.

Should the program be successful, and contracts abound for
various new maglev routes around the country, industry investment
is expected to exceed the original $950 million from the federal
government. Mrazek predicts that maglev could become a $30-
billion to $60-billion industry.

Mrazek said that though he and others were disappointed by the
$6.1 million for maglev R&D in Transportation Secretary Skinner's
budget request for fiscal year 1991, he does not anticipate
administration roadblocks to the proposed legislation. He added
that he doesn't expect maglev to be a hard sell in Congress,
since many congressmen represent areas with companies that would
benefit from the program.

A growing number of bills are floating around on Capitol Hill
that favor maglev, including Sen. Ernest Hollings' (D-S.C.)
S.2236 which would require the Department of Transportation to
support more maglev research and foster a maglev system, and Sen.
Daniel Moynihan's (D-N.Y.) bill that would initiate maglev R&D
under the Federal Highway Administration's jurisdiction. Mrazek's
bill is the first to call for a federal maglev agency, and create
a competitive program both for prototype design and corridor
location.

FIRST CLEAN COAL RESULTS IN

The first test results are coming in for the $5-billion
government-industry Clean Coal Technology program, Department of
Energy officials say. An advanced pollution control process that
works inside the ductwork of existing coal-burning power plants
has met its design objectives, removing up to 70 percent of the
acid rain-causing sulfur pollutants from the exhaust gases of a
high-sulfur coal-burning plant in Ohio.

The $19.4-million project could lead to commercial use of the
"Coolside" technology, developed by Consolidation Coal Co. of
Pittsburgh. Coolside, an alternative to the more costly scrubber
technology, is the first of two processes to be demonstrated by
Babcock and Wilcox Co. of Alliance, Ohio, to control pollution
from older utility generating stations.

"The key advantage of the Coolside process is that by using the
plant's existing equipment to capture pollutants, it avoids the
need to build large, costly add-on scrubbing vessels," says
Robert Gentile, the Energy Department's Assistant Secretary for
Fossil Energy. "This is especially important in smaller or older
plants that are tightly spaced or have short remaining operating
lives. And, because the process operates downstream of the
boiler, it does not affect boiler performance and can be used on
a wide range of boiler types and sizes.

The Coolside process works by injecting sulfur-absorbing hydrated
lime powder into the combustion gases after they leave the coal
boiler. A mist of water droplets, along with sodium-based
additives, are sprayed into the gases as they move through the
plant's ductwork. The lime particles absorb the sulfur pollutants
which are then captured by existing particulate collection
devices. The water mist improves both the level of sulfur removal
and the performance of the particulate collection equipment. The
process produces a dry, disposable waste product, rather than the
wet sludge typical of today's scrubbers.

U.S COCOM PROPOSAL MAY FREEZE OUT USSR

by Aviva Freudmann
The U.S. government's Defense and Commerce departments are
finalizing a proposal for a two-tier approach to relaxing
controls on high technology exports to the Soviet bloc. The plan
calls for more liberal rules for Eastern Europe than for the
Soviet Union.

The Bush administration's aim is to introduce new rules at a
"historic" meeting of the 17-nation Coordinating Committee on
Multilateral Export Controls (Cocom) in Paris on June 7 and 8.
The proposed two-tier structure will be the subject of talks next
month between the U.S. and its Western allies.

U.S. Commerce Department Undersecretary for Export Administration
Dennis Kloske, the point man for U.S. export control policy, told
a business conference last week that there is "an emerging
consensus" in the administration favoring the two-tier approach.

His remarks followed disclosure, two weeks earlier, that the
Defense Department had decided not to block exports of many U.S.
computers to the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, thereby
allowing the Commerce Department control over the sales. The move
was seen as a victory for the Commerce Department, which has
pushed for sole authority to monitor high technology sales.

In his remarks last week, Kloske stressed that the proposed two-
tier export regime means that Eastern European governments will
have to introduce controls to prevent re-export of Western
technologies to  the Soviet Union.

Kloske also said that West Germany, in particular, should pay
more attention to ensuring that its high technology exports to
East Germany do not end up in Soviet hands.

The reason for retaining controls on high technology exports to
the USSR is fear that they will be used for military purposes.
The U.S. is not opposed to relaxing the rules on sales of
civilian non-strategic technologies to the Soviet Union, Kloske
said.

But trade experts quoted by Reuters say that Soviet officials are
unlikely to stand by idly while the rest of the Warsaw Pact
countries catch up with Western technology.

The Soviet Union "has been able to get its hands on much of this
technology for years, even when it was restricted," said Randy
Bregman, director of Soviet and East European services for Apco
Associates, a Washington-based consulting group.

Many of the export controls have more political than practical
value, he added. If Hungary or Poland acquires certain new
technologies, it won't take long for the know-how to show up in
the Soviet Union, in spite of formal controls, he said.

Western manufacturers have much to gain from relaxing controls on
exports to the Soviet Union because of that nation's large
market potential compared with Eastern Europe, Bregman added. He
said that keeping formal controls in place would cause the Soviet
Union short-term difficulties, particularly as it tries to
modernize its backward telecommunications system.

The Soviets use a phone system that is more than 30 years old. It
has only about 10 phone lines per 100 people, a ratio lower than
that in Hungary, East Germany or Czechoslovakia. This compares
with 90 phones per 100 people in the U.S., and 60 lines per 100
in Western Europe.

U.S. Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher said recently that the
United States would agree to exports of 10-year-old telephone
technology, which he said would help the Soviet economy. However,
the older technology would force the Soviets to use an analog
dial-up system rather than the digital push-button technology now
common in the West.

Mosbacher, speaking in West Germany, explained that United
States policy is to support perestroika, "but the reality is that
[the Soviets] have the potential to be a great military threat."

The use of 10-year old technology is not likely to be acceptable
in the Soviet Union, argued Stepan Pachikov, a Soviet computer
scientist who heads ParaGraph, a joint venture with a U.S. firm
that publishes Moscow's first computer newspaper.

"If we wanted to just upgrade 30 or 40 percent of our phone
system, then the answer would be `yes,' 10-year-old technology
is good enough," Pachikov said.

But he pointed out that Western nations had a tough time of it
when they tried to adapt their analog phone systems to digital
computer transmissions. "If we want to communicate adequately
with the West, then the equipment on both sides of the line must
be equal."

The head of ParaGraph's U.S. partner, IDG, agreed that export
barriers are increasingly unenforceable. On a recent trip to
Hungary, IDG president Patrick McGovern learned from government
officials that returning Hungarian tourists had brought with them
at least 70,000 computers of the sort that appear on CoCom's
restricted list.

DOE CONSIDERS FOREIGN PARTICIPANTS IN SSC

by Lucy Reilly
The Department of Energy is considering a controversial proposal
to accept bids from foreign companies to construct the magnets
for the $8-billion Superconducting Super Collider. Ideally, DOE
(and its contractors) would prefer direct financial contributions
from foreigners, but foreign governments "would prefer to
participate in the hardware as opposed to simply outright grant
of cash," says Russ Wylie, director of external affairs at the
SSC site headquarters in Dallas.

U.S. industry executives are concerned that if the SSC contracts
are opened up, they won't be able to compete against foreign
companies who often are bankrolled by their own governments.

"Foreign companies operate under a subsidized umbrella and will
be able to underbid U.S. industry and run away with the whole
ball of wax," says Carl Rosner, president of Intermagnetics
General Corp. of Guilderland, N.Y.

The companies that are thought to have the best chances of
landing contracts to make the magnets for the SSC include General
Dynamics, Westinghouse, Grumman and Italian-based Ansaldo.
Ansaldo has hooked up with Grumman in pursuit of an SSC contract.

The request for proposals for the magnet portion of the SSC are
expected to be released in the next few weeks. A total of 10,000
magnets, worth an estimated $1 billion, will be used in the
collider.

The exclusion of foreign firms could generate further conflict
for the United States, which recently began negotiations with the
European Community to conduct joint research in several areas of
technology. In addition, closing the process to foreigners may
not bode well for U.S. officials, who have been pushing for other
nations to open access to their consortia and industrial
contracts.

"I think there are other ways [the government] can get sufficient
funding" without having to open bidding to foreign firms, said
one industry source. "It's unlikely in the initial stages of the
project that DOE will open the floodgates. For the U.S. to be
competitive, it needs to keep some of the technology inside."

SUPERCOMPUTER RESEARCH PICKING UP IN TENNESSEE

Using a new massively parallel Intel supercomputer at the Oak
Ridge National Laboratory as a hub, officials at Oak Ridge and
the University of Tennessee are setting up a cluster of new
research institutes. The institutes, which receive backing from
major computer companies, will carry out research in physics, the
environment and computer sciences.

The effort is designed to bring supercomputer-based research in
Tennessee to the same level as other high-tech oriented states,
especially neighboring North Carolina and Alabama.

Use of the Intel iPSC/860 machine instead of the more common Cray
non-parallel supercomputers should also give the state a lead in
parallel processing techniques, says Jack Dongarra, who is
directing the new computer studies program.

Dongarra, who left the Argonne National Laboratory last September
to take a joint Oak Ridge/University of Tennessee position, says
use of the lower cost parallel processors appears to be a more
efficient way to produce supercomputing power than the Cray
approach which uses more expensive single components. The new
Intel machine costs $3 million compared to at least $20 million
for a Cray.

"We take the long-term view that parallel processing is not a fad
but is here to stay," says Dongarra. "We believe that what we are
starting to do here is the way supercomputing will be done in the
future."

Intel unveiled the iPSC/860 in January saying it provided high-
speed processing at one-tenth the cost of industry leader Cray.
Besides Oak Ridge, NASA's Ames Research Center in California has
received one, and some large corporations including Ford Motor
Co. and Prudential-Bache Co. have placed orders.

The new Oak Ridge machine, delivered in January, has 128
processors or separate nodes arranged to work together. Working
at full capacity, using a "hypercube" networking principle, it
can perform 5.2-billion operations per second (5.2 gigaflops).

It replaces an Intel-PSC/2 machine which has 64 processors and is
not classified as a supercomputer. The Oak Ridge lab "traded in"
the older computer when it bought the new one, but Intel has
decided to donate the older machine, worth about $500,000, back
to the University of Tennessee.

Thus, says Dongarra, the new Computational Sciences Institute
will be able to use the smaller machine to do preparatory
research for projects involving the larger supercomputer. Oak
Ridge itself has had a parallel processing research program since
1984 based on the smaller machine.

The new institute, with a start-up budget of $500,000, will
concentrate on developing new algorithms for parallel processing.
It also will develop graphics applications for use with parallel
processors.

At the same time, it will work with the other joint institutes to
tackle several "grand challenges," including world climate
modelling andd superconductivity theory, says Dongarra. In these
cases, the computer group will lend special expertise to the
other research groups when they get stuck on problems.

The Computational Sciences Institute has recently held talks with
both IBM and Digital Corp. which could lead to corporate funding
for some of the research.

The Oak Ridge/University of Tennessee project that is farthest
along is the Institute for Heavy Ion Research, created in 1988.
This group has focused on the behavior of atomic nuclei under
stress using supercomputer techniques.

As a side effect of the heavy ion research, the institute has
proposed a new gamma-ray detection device, the "gammasphere," and
has been selected by DOE as the preferred site for building the
$16-million machine.

A second joint physics research unit, the Institute for High-
Energy Research, is being started by Oak Ridge and the University
of Tennessee. This institute will focus on building detector
equipment for the Superconducting Super Collider and developing
SSC experiments.

Oak Ridge officials have recently started efforts to bring work
on the proposed L-Star SSC detector to the lab using the new
institute as a means of attraction.

Another joint institute, still in the planning stages, would
perform research in both the energy and environment fields,
complementing work on greenhouse effect problems underway at Oak
Ridge. The supercomputer would be used particularly for
atmospheric modeling.

University of Tennessee officials say that the two Intel machines
give them direct access to a level of supercomputer power that is
rare for most universities. They hope this will give their
researchers an advantage in winning research funding.

At the same time, the new computational sciences institute is
looking forward to the purchase of an improved supercomputer with
1,024 parallel processors and a capacity of one-quadrillion
operations per second (1 teraflop). The $15-million unit will be
available in two to three years.

According to Dongarra, securing a one-teraflop machine would put
the institute in a world leadership position for parallel
computing and attract additional research work from several
industrial and government sources.

FLORIDA CENTER COOLS WITH SOLAR

Researchers at the Florida Solar Energy Center have developed a
system capable of cooling and dehumidifying interior air while
consuming less energy than traditional air conditioners. The
system, known as DESRAD, utilizes a sun-absorbing metal roof and
a special drying agent to cool and dehumidify the air in a
building.

Muthusamy Swami of the Florida Solar Energy Center in Cape
Canaveral, said the plan for DESRAD has been submitted to the
Department of Energy in hopes of receiving funding. "If funding
can be secured, I'd say a prototype could be ready for testing in
two or three years," adds Swami.

ASME TO SCREEN COUNTERFEITS

Counterfeit and substandard screws, bolts, washers and other
fasteners will have a harder time making it into U.S. markets
thanks to the newly initiated American Society of Mechanical
Engineers' fastner accreditation program (FAP).  "In many
instances, suppliers provided bogus quality certifications and
other misrepresentations to their buyers," says SME. This has
lead to millions of counterfeit fasteners with have cracked,
sheared or otherwise failed in helicopters, trucks, bridges,
nuclear power plants, coal mines, tanks and other military
equipment.

SME hopes that the accreditation program will help government
efforts in stemming the flow of counterfeit goods by subjecting
would-be fastener suppliers to stringent reviews. Until now, the
Defense Department and aerospace industry had no way of
determining whether or not they were dealing with a supplier
capable of producing high strength, high quality and safe
fastener products, says ASME.

U.S. FIBER-OPTIC STRATEGY PROPOSED

The fiber-optic public interest group called "Opt In America" has
filed a formal complaint with the federal government charging
that the United States lacks vision for the future of fiber
optics. "We hear a parochial debate on process and
technique....We need a driving vision of where we want to end
up," says Opt Chairman John Eger. "We had that with telephones,
cable and broadcasting. We do not yet have that with
fiber optics."

Eger says that of 94 million homes in the United States, a scant
15,000 are scheduled for fiber-optic wiring. Meanwhile, Japan and
several European countries are moving ahead with fiber-optic
plans for homes. Opt advocates a switched, broadband fiber-optic
network to the home.

AST MARKETS COMPUTERS TO JAPAN

Irvine, Calif.-based AST Research Inc. is testing the waters of
the Tokyo marketplace with the first U.S. personal computer that
can run both the most popular Japanese and American software
packages. The company's SX/16 "will be seen as a test case of
the openness of the Japanese market," says one Tokyo analyst.
"If it doesn't do at all well, there will be a lot of harsh
words." The machine can run the many Japanese-language software
packages developed for computers made by NEC Corp., the Japanese
giant that controls about half the domestic PC market.

James Ashbrook, senior vice president of AST, says the computer
would be ideal for multinational companies that work in both
Japanese and English. Industry analysts say AST's success will
depend on how successful the company is at cultivating
distribution channels in the tough Japanese market rather than
the quality of the product.

U. WASH. MANY COLORED DISPLAY

University of Washington engineers have invented an
image-processing system that may be "the world's sharpest,
fastest and least expensive," says the Seattle-based university.
The system consists of a single circuit board for the NeXT
computer that produces images with several million colors rather
than the 256-line limit of most computers, says Yongmin Kim,
professor of electrical engineering and leader of the research.
"It executes incredibly complex functions with a speed
approximating that of a supercomputer...but will cost about half
as much to manufacture as other image-processing systems, which
sell from $65,000 to $30,000 depending on the application."

The system will have the most immediate application in medical
technology, researchers say. The computer will yield
three-dimensional, true-color X-rays, which can be manipulated to
examine all sides. "New X-rays can be popped onto the screen in
a second, and up to 16 images can be called up at once with the
push of two buttons," says the University of Washington.
Previous technology could display only one picture with poor
color resolution and difficult manipulation of the image.

Kim's team received primary funding for system development from
University of Washington with some money contributed by the Navy.
The system has been licensed non-exclusively to Daewoo Telecom
Co. of Korea, and will be marketed by Leading Edge Products Inc.
in the fall.
