MK PROJECT WINS 1996 OUTSTANDING CIVIL ENGINEERING AWARD<p>

</b></center>
	BOISE -- Morrison Knudsen Corporation announced today that the American Society of Civil
Engineers has named Boston's Ted Williams Tunnel the Outstanding Civil Engineering
Achievement for 1996.   The 3,840 foot-long underwater tunnel is the first major component of the
$7.8 billion Central Artery / Third Harbor Tunnel Project and was placed on the floor of the Boston
Harbor by an MK-led joint venture including Interbeton, Inc. and J.F. White Contracting Company.<p>

	The new four-lane tunnel is an immersed marine tube comprised of 12 sections, each 320 feet long,
80 feet wide and 40 feet high and links South Boston to Logan International Airport.   MK served
as the primary construction contractor for the project and was responsible for placing the tube
sections in water up to 100 feet deep.   Work on the $250-million tunnel began in 1993 and was
completed on schedule in 1995. <p>

	"The success of this project reflects MK's operational excellence in marine construction,"  said
Robert A. Tinstman, MK President and Chief Executive Officer. "Our Heavy Construction Group
has a rich heritage in completing challenging underwater work.  Marine construction, as one of our
core operational strengths, will continue to be important in the future."  <p>

	In 1993, MK's emergency repair work on an ocean outfall pipeline off  the coast of San Diego won
the company the Contractor of the Year Award.  MK repaired the ruptured outfall, which extends
two miles into the Pacific Ocean, in 56 days.<p>

	The 33,000 ton sections of the Ted Williams Tunnel were fabricated at Bethlehem Steel's Baltimore
shipyard and barged 560 miles to Boston where  MK placed the tubes on the harbor floor within 1
inch tolerances, using global positioning systems and underwater divers.<p>

	Morrison Knudsen Corporation, founded in 1912, serves the world's heavy construction,
environmental, industrial, mining, operations &amp; maintenance, power, process, and 
transportation markets as an engineer and constructor. <p>
