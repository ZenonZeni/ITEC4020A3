<H1>World Acclaim for Newcastle Firm's PC Based Robot Simulation system</H1> 

<P>Recognised authorities from international academic and manufacturing circles have acknowledged the advances in robotics simulation made by a pioneering Newcastle business</P>

<P>4 year old Robot Simulations, now Robot Simulations Ltd., of Lynnwood Business Centre in Newcastle has developed the "WORKSPACE" range of PC based robotics 3D simulation, calibration and off-line programming software claimed as the first to compete with mainframe or graphics workstation based systems at a fraction of the cost. The opportunities, says Managing Director Roger Verrall, are almost limitless. With 20,000 educational potential users around the world and some 500,000 industrial robots, the world is our oyster.</P>

<P>Developed by ex-Newcastle University Dr. John Owens ( now Technical Director ), WORKSPACE has already been bought by many UK and European companies and colleges and also USA, Taiwan, Korea, Turkey, Singapore, Malaysia, India, Brasil and has attracted enthusiastic response from the Japanese and USA Robotics Associations. A distributor covering the whole of North America has recently been appointed with an identified user base of 20,000 industrial sites.</P>

<P>Closer to home RSL are working with Pilkington Glass and Estil ( one of the leading UK automotive system integrators ). Plymouth University was the first in the UK to use WORKSPACE as the core software for its new BSc. (Hons) course in Robotics and Factory Automation with Liverpool John Moore, Leeds Metropolitan and Middlesex Universities are among many that are using it as a major learning tool. Paul Robinson, senior lecturer at Plymouth University's School of Electronics, Communications and Engineering joined Robot Simulations to develop a user friendly learning manual for WORKSPACE, the placement, the first of it's kind, being made through the DTI Senior Academics in Industry Scheme (SAIS) managed by the much vaunted Cranfield Institute of Technology who are also co-operating with RSL on important research projects.</P>

<P>Locally, Komatsu have been working with RSL to help design a new workcell within their Birtley Plant. This contact is seen as very important as Komatsu, being a major international company could use WS on a world-wide basis.</P>

<P>Major US car maker invites RSL to demonstrate WS at their new production facility near Detroit. US Waterjet cutting company have bought WS for their new process. Major Swedish furniture manufacture bought after a student now employed at the company recommended WS. Roger Verrall sees potential in almost every area of industry and the growing service robotics market.</P>
