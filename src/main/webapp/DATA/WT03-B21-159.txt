<P>TVX GOLD STRENGTHENS ITS SENIOR OPERATING MANAGEMENT TEAM

<P>Toronto, Ontario, May 15, 1996 ... Mr. Eike Batista, Chairman and CEO of TVX Gold Inc. is pleased to announce the strengthening of its Senior Operating Management Team with the appointments of Mr. David Murray as President and Chief Operating Officer and Mr. Clifford J. Davis as Senior Vice President, North American Operations. The Company also anticipates the announcement of a third member of this Senior Operating Management Team as Senior Vice President, European Operations, to be made by month end and whose qualifications and mining industry-related experience are in keeping with those hereby announced.

<P>David Murray, as President and Chief Operating Officer, brings to TVX Gold Inc. over twenty-five years of mining industry-related experience as well as strong leadership in operations and project management. Prior to joining TVX Gold, Mr. Murray held the position of President and CEO of RTZ Mineracao, the wholly owned Brazilian subsidiary of Rio Tinto Zinc ("RTZ"), whereby he established a long-term relationship with the Corporation through the TVX/RTZ joint venture Paracatu (Brasília) mine. He joined the RTZ Group in Zimbabwe in 1970 and has held senior executive positions in England, Wales, Germany, Spain and Portugal. In Portugal, he was responsible for the $400 million development and operation of the Neves Corvo underground copper/tin mine, an achievement for which he was named to the Order of the British Empire. In 1993, he moved to Brazil as President and CEO, RTZ Mineracao, which interests included the $230 million Fortaleza nickel mine and the $65 million expansion of the Brasília mine in which TVX has a 33% interest.

<P>Clifford Davis, as Senior Vice President, North American Operations, joins TVX Gold from Echo Bay Mines where he held the position of Vice President, Projects since 1992. Mr. Davis joined the RTZ Group in 1979 as General Manager of two underground tin mines in Cornwall, England. In 1985, he moved to Neves Corvo, Portugal as Project Manager and, later, held the position of Production Manager at this large underground copper/tin mine. In 1989, he became General Manager of Kennecott Corporation's Green's Creek lead/zinc/silver/gold mine in Alaska, and later, General Manager of Kennecott's Ridgeway gold mine in South Carolina. In 1992, he returned to Alaska as Vice President, Projects for Echo Bay Mines.

<P>Mr. Batista is also pleased to announce that Mr. John Hick will now serve in the capacity of Vice Chairman of the Corporation. The promotion of Mr. Hick and the appointments of the three new senior members of its Operating team (with over 90 years of mining industry-related experience) will strengthen TVX Gold's management as the Corporation continues the successful development of its global assets.
