ORGANIZATION OF AFRICAN UNITY (OAU)

     The organization of African Unity (OAU) was established on May
25, 1963 in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia for the purpose of: 1) promoting
unity and solidarity among African States, 2) intensifying and
coordinating efforts to improve living standards, 3) defending the
sovereignty , territorial integrity and independence of African
states, 4)eradicating colonialism, and 5) promoting international
cooperation, in keeping with the United Nations Charter.
     Membership: Algeria, Angola, Benin, Botswana, Burkina Faso,
Burundi, Cameroon, Cape Verde, Central African Republic, Chad,
Comoros, Congo, Cote d'Ivoire, Djibouti, Egypt, Equatorial Guinea,
Eritrea, Ethiopia, Gabon, The Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau,
Kenya, Lesotho, Liberia, Libya, Madagascar, Malawi, Mali,
Mauritania, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, Niger, Nigeria, Rwanda,
Sao Tome and Principe, Senegal, Seychelles, Sierra Leone, Somalia,
Sudan, Swaziland, Tanzania, Togo, Tunisia, Uganda, Zaire, Zambia,
Zimbabwe.
     Organization: There are four main organs of the OAU.  The
Assembly of Heads of State and Government, which meets in rotating
countries, is the highest authority.  The Council of Ministers,
comprised of foreign ministers from the member countries, meets on
a bi-annual basis, elects its own chairman each session, and
prepares the Assembly meetings.  The Secretariat General is the
permanent headquarters of the OAU.  Its Secretary General is
elected to a four-year term by the Assembly.  The final OAU organ
is the Council of Mediation, Councilitation and Arbitration, which
meets when necessary to hear and peacefully settle disputes between
member countries.  There are also several "specialized commissions"
attached to the OAU for economic, social, transport and
communications affairs; education, science, culture and health;
defense; human rights; and labor.
     Budget: Members contribute with their U.N. assessment.  No
member is assessed for an amount exceeding 20 percent of the
yearly regular OAU budget.
     Current Activities: At the 61st meeting of the OAU Council of
Ministers in late January, members concentrated on finding a
practical solution to the four-year-old Somali conflict by the end
of March when United Nations Operation in Somalia (UNOSOM) is
scheduled to end.  Although no solutions were put forward,the
members resolved to hold two meetings, one ministerial and the
other at the summit level, in March to work out the details for
OAU to replace UNOSOM as the oversight body for Somalia.  The decision
is the second collective move by African countries toward the
Somali issue since the beginning of the year.  On January 4,
Africa's Inter-Governmental Authority on Drought and Development
(IGADD) Committee called on all factions to avoid further
hostilities and bloodshed.
     OAU members view the resolution of the Somalia problem in
regional terms.  They stress that Africa's problems should be
solved by Africans.  OAU-mandated mediator, President Meles Zenawi
(Ethiopia) has stated that African nations have a better
understanding of the Somali social structure, mentality, and
relationships between clans than an outside force such as UNOSOM.

Therefore, African nations working in concert in the OAU enjoy
advantages in helping the Somalis solve their problems.  While no
one believes that the Somali conflict can be resolved in the near
future, there is great optimism among informed African Sources that
the OAU can begin to lay the foundation for a lasting peace.

WHO IS WHO IN BULGARIA

     By a vote of 138 to 91 with two abstentions, Zhan Videnov,
chairman of the Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP) was elected prime
minister on January 25.  Soon after his confirmation, the 35-year
old Moscow-trained economist presented his cabinet to the
parliament for approval.  In spite of complaints by opposition
deputies that the new cabinet is populated with member of the
former communist elite, all ministers were approved.
     While it is true that the cabinet is dominated by former
senior communist officials, it also includes technocrats in some
key posts.  Videnov will be assisted by four deputy prime
ministers: Rumen Gechev, Doncho Konakchiev, Kiril Tsochev and
Svetoslav Shiravov.  The first three also have economic
portfolios,
with Gechev exercising overall control over the economy as
minister
for economic development.  Georgi Pirinski, who was deputy
foreign
trade minister under the Zhivkov regime but hails from the
reformist wing of the BSP, has been named foreign minister.
Historian Ilcho Dimitrov is the new minister of education - a
post
held in the 1980s.  Res. Adm. Dimiter Pavlov is the new defense
minister and Lyubomi Nachev, a former police officer, takes over
the Ministry of Interior.  The Ministry of Finance is headed by
Dimitar Kostov.  The BSP's coalition partners will hold three of
the 17 posts.  Svetoslav Shivarov and Vasil Chichibaba of the
Bulgarian Agrarian People's Union "Aleksandar Stambliyski" are
deputy prime minister and minister of agriculture, respectively,
and Georgi Georgiev of the Political Club Ekoglasnost is the
environment minister.
     In his speech as prime minister, Videnov announced an "anti-
crisis program" and pledged to cut unemployment and inflation.
He
said the new government will also speed up privatization and
agricultural reform while continuing to develop ties with
international lending organizations.  With regard to foreign
policy, Videnov said his government will promote Bulgaria's
integration into Europe and continue to take part in NATO's
Partnership for Peace program.  He promised to present a
four-year
legislative plan within 100 days and said the 1995 budget would
be
approved by the end of March.

LEBANON'S PRESIDENTIAL RACE TO BEGIN IN MARCH

     The race for Lebanon's presidency is expected to begin in
March when the parliament will be able to consider introducing
constitutional amendments that would make it possible for
President Elias Hrawi to run for a second term. The current 
constitution does not allow an incumbent president to be
reelected or a civil servant to run for president if he did
not resign from his post two years before the polls. Amendments 
to these two articles will be considered.
     Even though Hrawi has recently stated that he does not want to
run for another six-year term, information out of Syria, and from 
within the Lebanese ruling establishment suggests that he would be 
reelected with little difficulty. If the law which prohibits civil 
servants rom running for office is repealed, Army Commander Gen. Emile 
Lahoud has been mentioned as a strong candidate.

IRAQI LEADER'S SON REPORTEDLY APPOINTED INTELLIGENCE CHIEF

     Citing reliable sources, a Kurdistan newspaper reported on
February 10 that Abd Hasan al-Majid, the director of the General
Intelligence, has been replaced by Qusayy Saddam, the son of
Saddam Hussein.  Qusayy was last referred to as the chief of the Special
Security Organization (Jihaz Amn al-Khass), President Saddam's
personal secret service.
     Al-Majid was apparently sacked in connection with
revelations concerning several Iraqi assassination operations against such
targets as German Journalist Lisi Schmidt in Kurdistan and Ghalib
al-Suhayl, a leading Iraqi opposition figure, in Lebanon.  It is
curious to note that this was the same reason given for the
removal of al-Majid's predecessor, Maj. Gen. Sabir al-Duri in June, a
move generally regarded as a part of widespread purge of the al-Duri
family from the Iraqi leadership.

PAKISTAN INTELLIGENCE BUREAU EXPANDED

     Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto approved an unprecedented
expansion of the Intelligence Bureau (IB), Pakistan's domestic
intelligence service, on January 28, creating 24 new posts at
levels below grade 20.(The News, January 29)  The move was taken
to broaden the agency's network and invigorate its anti-terrorist
activities.  According to informed sources, however, the
expansion has not yet received the consent of the Ministry of Finance 
or the Establishment Division, which must approve any financial or
administrative change in IB's status.

RAO RESHUFFLES INDIA'S CABINET

     Prime Minister Narasimha Rao expanded the Council of
Ministers on February 9, inducting three new ministers of cabinet rank,
three as ministers of state, and elevated two ministers of state to the
cabinet rank.  He also reallocated the portfolios of some other
ministers.  This reshuffle, which was the second since Rao came
to power in 1991, was designed to resuscitate a cabinet depleted by
a string of sackings and resignations following the ruling Congress
party's defeats in regional polls last November.(See WGR, Vol
4.,No2)
     Two appointments stand out.  Rao has recalled Madhav Rao
Scindia, an Oxford educated scion of the ruling family Gwalir and
loyal Congress party stalwart, to be minister of human resources
development.  Scindia quit as civil aviation minister in January
1993 after accepting moral responsibility for the crash of a
Russian aircraft leased by the government-owned Indian Airlines.
The other major appointment is P. Chidambaram as a minister of
state for commerce.  A Harvard-educated lawyer and former home,
personnel and commerce minister, Chidambaram is widely admired in
industry for his strong advocacy of India's economic reform
program.

INDONESIAN PRESIDENT APPOINTS ARMY CHIEF OF STAFF

     President Suharto installed Gen. Raden Hartono as Army chief
of staff on February 11, replacing Gen. Wismoyo Arismunandar, who
retired the day before.  As a 1962 graduate of the National
Military Academy, Hartono is senior to Wismoyo, who graduated in
1963.  Hartono, 53, however, is two years younger that his
predecessor, for he was the youngest graduate in his class.
     Officially, the 55-year old Wismoyo, the president's
brother-in-law, chose to retire because he has reached the military age
of retirement.  But Suharto could have kept him on until he was 60.
Gen. Fesal Tanjung, 57, chief of the Joint Service and commander-
in-chief of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Indonesia (ABRI),
has had his retirement deferred twice.  According to informed
sources, the president's decision not to extend Wismoyo's service
is related to the latter's tumultuous private life, which has
irritated his extended family.  And in order to show his
independence, he has at times shown more solidarity with the Army
than Suharto might have liked.  Having turned down an
ambassador's post, Wismoyo will become head of the National 
Indonesian Sports Committee.
     Wismoyo's retirement will not weaken Suharto's position
within the military.  The appointment of Hartono, considered to a be a
loner in the Army, reflects the president's desire to surround
himself with officers who owe their positions solely to him.
Before his recent appointment, Hartono was the chief of the Armed
Forces Sociological Department.  The son of a Muslim religious
scholar from Pamedasan, Madura, he held several senior posts in
the ABRI.  After his tenure as commander of the Brawijaya Regional
Military Command in East Java, he was appointed commandant of the
Army Command and Staff College (Bandung).  He then served as
governor of the National Defense Institute.

NORTH KOREAN LEADER FAILS TO APPEAR AT BIRTHDAY CELEBRATION

     On February 16, North Korea began a two-day celebration of
Kim Chong-il's 53rd birthday in what is believed to be a prelude to
his formal assession to power in the spring.  Kim, living up to his
reputation as a recluse, failed to make an appearance at the
festivities.  This did not stop the celebration from being
officially proclaimed as the "greatest holiday of nation," a
title that used to be formally reserved for the April 15 Birthday of
Kim's father, the late President Kim Il-sung.
     Kim Chong-il's avoidance of the lime-light since his
father's death last July has fed speculation that he was ill, which was
delaying his formal takeover of the two key posts of national
president and secretary general of the Korean Worker's Party.  In
the past six weeks, however, he has made four public appearances,
seemingly in better health than last summer when the emaciated
Kim appeared to suffer from facial paralysis.  Although these recent
appearances have laid to rest speculation about poor health, they
raised new questions whether Kim is engaged in a political
struggle with hardline elements within the high command since all were
liked to military events.
     According to informed South Korean sources, Kim wants to
extend the period of mourning for this father in order to
increase public acceptance of his succession.  One indication that he may
take power in Late April is the staging at that time of an
international sports and cultural festival in Pyongyang to which
10,000 foreign guests have been invited.  The event will most
likely also correspond with his father's embalmed body being
brought to its final resting place in the capital, which would
formally end the mourning period.

SOUTH KOREAN ARMY RELEASES REFORM PLAN

     In early February, the ROK Army revealed its plan for
drastic reorganization and downsizing of its headquarter.(Hangyore
Sinmun, February 3)  According to the plan, which was apparently overseen
by Chief of the General Staff Yun Yongnam, around two-thirds of
the officers attached to the present headquarters will be
transferred, many to field army staffs and educational institutes, such 
as the National Defense college and Military Staff College.
     The Army plans to merge the posts of Assistant Chief of
Staff for Information and the Assistant Chief of Staff for Operations
in order to streamline the General Staff bureaucracy.  In another
move, several independent administrative branches of the Army
will be reduced.  The Office of Communication and the Office of
Adjutant Generals will be incorporated into the Assistant Chief of Staff
for Logistics.  The Office of Personnel Management may also be
abolished for it overlaps with the duties of the Assistant Chief
of Staff for Personnel.

THAILAND'S FOREIGN MINISTER ANNOUNCES RESIGNATION

     Thaksin Shinawatra, one of Thailands's most successful
businessmen, announced his resignation as minster of foreign
affairs on January 31 after a controversy involving potential
conflict of interest with his business empire.  He said that he
would resign before the end of February when a constitutional
tribunal is scheduled to rule on whether he can legally hold the
government portfolio.
     Thaksin, who is not an elected member of parliament, was
offered the foreign affairs post in November when Prime Minster
Chamlong Srimuang, the leader of the Palang Dharma party, sacked
all 11 of his party's ministers to try to boost its flagging
popularity.  Critics criticized the prime minister for giving
such a delicate job to an aggressive entrepreneur who had built up his
company (Shinawatra Telecommunications Group) on his ability to
win contracts for Thai and foreign governments.  Thaksin's position
was made more difficult in December when the legislature passed a new
constitution that banned ministers from holding government
monopoly concessions.(Financial Times, February 1)  He refused to divest
his more than $2 billion worth of shares in the Shinawatra group
which owns the country's two commercial satellites and a mobile phone
concession.  On becoming foreign minister, he resigned as
chairman of his flagship Shinawatra Computer and Communications group but
simply passed the reins to his wife.  This was not thought enough
to distance him from the corporate empire.  Under constant
pressure for critics inside and outside the government, Thaksin decided to
give up his government work and return to the private sector.
     Because of his short tenure, Thaskin's departure is unlikely
to disrupt Thai foreign policy.  Most of the more innovative
policies, covering cross-border economic cooperation, have been
overseen by Deputy Prime Minister Supachai Panichpakdi.  As for
Thaksin's successor, the new foreign minister will probably be a
Palang Dharma MP.  Although there are few qualified candidates,
informed sources point to Krasae Chanawong, the current
university minster.

RESIGNATION OF FINANCE MINSTER CALLS INTO QUESTION HUNGARY'S
COMMITMENT TO REFORM

     Prime Minister Gyula Horn on February 7 nominated Budapest
Bank President Lajos Bokoros as minister of finance and Gyorgy
Suranyi, current head of the Central European International Bank,
as Hungarian National Bank Chairman.  The nomination of two
respected bankers is designed to restore confidence in Hungary's
financial management structure which was undermined by Finance
Minister Laszlo Bekesi's resignation on January 30.
     Bekesi, the architect of the Socialist party's economic
reform program, resigned after a long battle with government hardliners
over control of privatization.  Coming just two weeks after the
sacking of another prominent reformer, Privatization Chief Ferenc
Bartha, and a two month delay in naming a new central bank
governor, Bekesi's resignation cast doubt on the government's
commitment to economic reform.  In addition, his departure
reflected a growing strain within the ruling coalition.
     The uneasy ruling coalition, which was formed last July
between the Socialist party and the Alliance of Free Democrats
(ADF), began to show signs of serious disagreement over economic
policy almost from its inception.  The ADF, which is composed of
refugees from the former dissident movement, prefers market
reform and rapid privatization of state industries.  The Socialist
party, made up of reform elements of the former communist party,
however, prefers market reform and rapid privatization of state
industries. The Socialist party, made up of reform elements of the 
former communist party, however, prefers a slower pace to economic
reform and is not enthusiastic about widespread privatization.  The
tension between the two parties increase dramatically in January
with signs that Socialist Prime Minister Gyula Horn, whose ruling
style has become progressively more autocratic, had decided to
slow the pace of reform.  Bartha, who was the finance ministry's
ostensibly independent privatization commissioner, was seen as a
threat because he answered to Bekesi and not the prime minister's
office.  His sacking spurred ADF protests that the Socialists
were abandoning the coalitions's agreed economic program for the
steady transformation of the country's economic system.  Horn was also
criticized for not sufficiently consulting his coalition partners
before making policy decisions.
     In an attempt to repair the damage caused by Bekesi's
resignation, the two ruling parties agreed on February 14 to
appoint a new minister without portfolio to supervise
privatization.  The two parties also agreed to extend the
authority of the finance minister, giving him veto power over all
economic proposals forwarded to the government, a responsibility that
Bekesi had requested.  The ADF originally opposed creating the new post
and wanted the finance minister to supervise privatization.  The
extension of the finance minister's authority was a compromise
solution.

POLISH PRESIDENT FORCES CABINET'S RESIGNATION

     On February 6, President Lech Walesa called for the
resignation of Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak and reshuffle of
the coalition government composed of the ex-communist Left Democratic
Alliance (SLD) and Pawlak's own Peasant Party (PSL).  Walesa
accused Pawlak of incompetence and said his government was making
little progress in reforming the country.  Three days later,
Pawlak in a speech before the PSL executive committee announced that he
would resign after the formation of a new government.  Walesa has
given preliminary backing to Speaker of the Parliament Jozef
Olesky, a compromise candidate from the SLD, to become the fifth
Polish prime minister in the post-communist era.
     Political and personality conflicts have plagued the
coalition since its creation in 1993, in particular between Alexander
Kwasniewski, the pragmatic SLD leader, and Prime Minister Pawlak.

Walesa, for whom the prospect of a long-term, stable government
led by his former communist opponents meant relegation to virtual
irrelevance, was quick to seize upon the internal stresses to
undermine the coalition.  By delaying the appointment of the
heads of the "power ministries" (defense, internal and foreign
affairs), he has campaigned to erode the government's efficacy.  Following
the resignation or sacking of all three ministers in the last few
months, none of the portfolios have been filled.  In addition,
Walesa in recent weeks has sought to drive a wedge between Pawlak
and Kwasniewski, denigrating the former and pointing to the
virtues of the latter as a potential prime minister.
     Walesa's actions are directly linked to his plans to seek a
second-five-year term in November.  Politically isolated by a
parliament in which he has few allies and which was elected in
1993 for a four-year term, the president decided that his political
survival was based on his ability to win the non-communist right
behind his candidacy.
     Pawlak's resignation may, however, prove to be a pyrrhic
victory.  For, while agreeing to replace the prime minister, the
PSL refused to nominate Kwasniewski as Wales had suggested.
Since Kwasniewski is regarded as one of the main potential contenders
for the presidency in November, his diversion into the premiership
would have removed a major obstacle to Walesa's reelection.
Instead, the PSL opted for Jozef Olesky, an intelligent and
deeply cynical former communist turned pro-market reformer.  Olesky is
openly contemptuous of Wales who he describes as the "proletarian
president."  An SLD-led government under his control would be
more efficient and less amenable presidential sabotage, leaving
Kwasniewski free to run against Walesa as the candidate of the
left.

RUSSIA MAY CREATE NATIONAL GUARD

     President Boris Yeltsin's advisers are preparing to
establish a National Guard directly subordinate to the president's
office.(Izvestiya, January 24)  According to informed sources,
the guard will be used during times of turmoil as "an armed
organization that will be an instrument in the battle for
political power."  In periods of stability, the National Guard will be an
"armed pillar of the political leader of the state."  Its
responsibilities will mostly revolve around internal problems and
threats which are outside the army's jurisdiction.  Its
membership will be small, but elite.  Aleksandr Korzhakov, chief of the
Presidential Guard, is said to be the main force behind the
guards' creation.  The idea for it sprang from an "analytical center"
under his control which employs between 60 and 100 former KGB experts
and headed by Georgii Pagozin, Korzhakov's deputy.  If reports of the
creation of yet another internal security force is true, they add
to the increasing evidence that Korzhakov is exercising a
hardline influence on the president.

RUSSIAN DEFENSE MINISTRY RESHUFFLED

     President Boris Yeltsin issued a decree on January 19
appointing new deputy defense ministers as part of a shakeup of
the Ministry of Defense.  Civilian Andrei Kokoshin retained his
position as first deputy minister as did chief of the General
Staff Col. Gen. Mikhail Kolesnikov.  Deputy ministers Col. Gen.
Konstantin Kobets, the inspector general of the armed forces and
Col. Gen. Vladimir Toporov, who had been in charge of logistics,
also retained their posts.  Toporov was described in the decree
as a deputy minister without portfolio, although subsequent reports
have stated that such tasks as physical fitness training and
cultural and recreational activities will fall under his purview.

Col. Gen. Anatolii Solomatin, chief of construction and billeting
for the armed forces, and Col. Gen. Vladimir Churanov, chief of
rear services, became deputy ministers for construction and
billeting and logistical support, respectively.
     As expected, Col. Gen. Boris Gromov, Col. Gen. Georgii
Kondratyev and Col. Gen. Valerii Mironov were not reappointed,
nor was previously dismissed Col. Gen. Matvei Burlakov.  It is clear
that their removal was linked to their negative attitude to
Russian operations in Chechnya.  While Kondratyev and Mironov were
"assigned to other duties," presumably within the Ministry of
Defense, Gromov was appointed to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
as the "chief military expert at large."  He is to serve as a
liaison between the two ministries as well as handle issues relating to
relations with NATO, strategic stability in Europe, and military
cooperation between CIS countries.
     In the wake of the debacle in Chechnya, rumors have begun to
surface concerning an new purge of the high command aimed at
Minister of Defense Gen. Pavel Grachev and his immediate circle
of advisers.  The Kremlin is said to be unhappy with his handling of
the war, which he promised would be over soon.  The Security
Council is particularly angry that Grachev has disclaimed
responsibility, shifting blame to it.  Andrei Kokoshin is being
considered for the minister's post, while Col. Gen. Andrei
Nikolayev, presently chief of the Federal Border Service, is
apparently a strong candidate for the post of Chief of the
General Staff.  The planned reshuffle is rumored to be set for March or
April.

     President Pascal Lissouba appointed Gen. Daniel Mabika as
chief of the Army staff of the Congolese Armed forces (FAC) on
January 23.  Mabika succeeds Gen. Claude-Emmanuel Etat-Onka, who
was appointed on the same day as minster of sports in the
country's new government.  Trained in the former Soviet Union, Gen. Mabika
had since 1985 been chief of operations of the FAC headquarter,
thus making him Gen. Etat-Onka's first deputy.  The new
government is expected to reorganize the armed forces in the near future, as
well as the police and gendarmerie.  The militias of the various
political parties will be dismantled.

AFTER FOILING COUP PLOT, GAMBIA'S LEADER PROMOTES ALLIES

     Capt. Yahya Jammeh, Gambia's military leader, promoted
Defense Minister Lt. Edward Singhateh to vice president and former
Western Division Commissioner Capt. Lamin Bajo to interior minister after
a purge of hardliners from the ruling council on January 30.(AFP,
January 30)  The reshuffle came in response to an alleged coup
attempt three days earlier by Vice President Lt. Sana Sabally and
Minister of Interior Capt. Sadibu Haidara.  Sabally and Haidara
have been arrested and are confined to Banjul's Mile Two prison.
     The dramatic events occurred as a commission was due to
publish its report on a timetable for the return to civilian
rule. Jammeh, who toppled civilian leader Sir Dawda Jawara last July,
unleashed a storm of protest in November when he said he did not
plan to hand over power until the end of 1998.  But in response
to international and local pressure, he set up a civilian commission
to canvass opinion and make a recommendation on the transfer of
power.  The commission recommended that the Armed forces
Provisional Council relinquish power by July 1996 and appoint an
interim government headed by a civilian prime minister, with
Jammeh remaining as head of state.  Hardliners within the Council, led
by Sabally and Haidara opposed the early transfer of power, wishing
to extend the present form of government to at least 1998.

NIGERIAN CABINET DISSOLVED

     Lt. Gen. Oladipo Diya, the number two person in the Nigerian
government, announced on February 9 that military ruler Gen. Sani
Abacha had dissolved the cabinet in order to allow some minister
to enter active politics.  The ministers are seeking to run for
office under a program for the military government's transition to
democratic rule which is yet to be announced.(Reuters, February
9) In light of an apparent narrowing of support for Abacha within
the military and a recent Constitutional Conference's decision to
force a transition within on year, many of the more ambitious ministers
are eager to establish their individual political credentials.
Diya said that a new cabinet will be named after a meeting of the
ruling all-military Provisional Ruling Council (PRC) but did not
indicate when it would meet.
     In the wake of last year's opposition attempt to force
Abacha to cede power to Moshood Abiola, the businessman widely believed
to have won an annulled 1993 presidential vote, Gen. Abacha promised
to make major changes in the government to make it more
effective. He also promised to announce a new transitional program that
would conclude with elections and a return to civilian rule.  A
Constitutional Conference was convened in Abuja to consider these
questions.  In december, the Conference stunned the government by
announcing that the military should turn over the reins of power
by January 1, 1996.  Almost immediately, the government began
lobbying to overturn the decision.  Conference delegates were courted and
envoys were sent abroad to explain that a quorum was not present
when the hand over vote was taken.  The Conference reconvened on
January 9, it decided to adjourn proceedings for two months thus
delaying the submission of its constitutional report to the
government and setting back the timetable for the unbanning of
political parties and fresh elections.  Even though Abacha was
successful in stifling the conference's attempt to enforce a
schedule for transition to civilian rule, the episode revealed
the limited amount of political loyalty he enjoys.
     In the midst of this leadership crisis, 14 of the 32-member
cabinet have signified their intention to quit the government to
pursue political careers.  All of these ministers belong to the
two political parties that vied for power after former military ruler
Gen. Ibrahim Babangida's promised transition to civil rule, which
led to Abacha a coming to power.  They are not keen to be linked
to an increasingly unpopular government and want to be free to from
their own alliances before it is too late.  Two of the more
notable politicians in the cabinet are Baba Gana Kingibe, foreign
minister, and Lateef Jakande, works minister, who have both run for
president in the past.
     As Nigeria attempts to establish a foreign exchange market,
crucial to the operation of the import-dependent economy, and
prepares for the start of a two-week international soccer
tournament in March, it is important that the government put this
crisis behind it as soon as possible.  Gen. Diya in his statement
announcing the dissolution of the cabinet said that outgoing
ministers who were not politicians could be considered for
reappointment. This indicates that Abacha will most likely not
use the cabinet reshuffle to stack the cabinet with proteges, which
would reveal an intention to abandon his promise to turn over
power to a civilian government.

NEW POLICE COMMISSIONER APPOINTED IN SOUTH AFRICA

     President Nelson Mandela announced the appointment of Gen.
George Fivaz as the new national commissioner of the South
African Police Services (SAP) on January 29.  Fivaz succeeds Gen. Johan
van der Merwe, who announced his retirement earlier this month.  In
addition, four new deputy commissioners were appointed: Gen.
Morgan Chetty, Gen. Mike Bester, Gen. Zolisa Lavisa and Gen. John
Manuel. 
     Gen. Fivaz's appointment came as little surprise , for he
has no connection with the SAP security apparatus responsible for the
enforcement of apartheid.  In fact, he has a reputation as a
reformer.  Having joined the SAP in 1964, he began his career as
a police officer at Bayswater in Bloemfontein.  In 1972, he was
appointed branch commander of the South African Narcotics Bureau
in the Orange Free State.  Four years later, he became a member of
the SAP National Inspectorate where he developed a particular
interest in policing styles, including community policing.  As chief of
Division Efficiency Services, he has played a critical role in
decentralizing authority within the national police force and
restructuring the SAP.

FRENCH SOCIALISTS FIND A PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE

     The French Socialist party (PS) had an embarrassingly
difficult search for a presidential candidate after the
withdrawal of former EU President Jacques Delors from the race.  They
rebounded on February 5, overwhelmingly approving the nomination
of Lionel Jospin to represent the party in preliminary elections on
April 23.  Jospin, a 57-years old former education minister,
defeated PS First Secretary Henri Emanuelli with two-thirds of
the PS delegate votes.  In what will probably remain a three-man
race, Jospin is hoping to defeat Gaullist mayor of Paris Jacques Chirac
and himself face frontrunner and current Prime Minister Edouard
Balladur in the final round on May 7.  Early polls released on
February 15, put the Socialist candidate one point ahead of
Balladur.

ITALIAN PRIME MINISTER WINS NO-CONFIDENCE VOTE

     Former Central Bank Director Lamberto Dini took the helm of
the 54th post World War II Italian government, having been
confirmed by the Senate by a margin of 191-17 with two
abstentions on February 3.  However, 114 senators backing media magnate
turned politician  Silvio Berlusconi chose not to be present at the
vote, demonstrating tepid support for the new government.  On January
26, Dini survived a no-confidence vote in the Chamber of Deputies by
a margin of 302 in favor, 270 abstentions and 39 against.  The new
government bears all the indications of instability: it is
composed entirely of non-parliamentarians, had defined itself as a
transitional government and enjoys uncertain support.
     Ironically, Dini was endorsed by the enemies of the previous
rightwing government (in which Dini was finance minister) and
opposed by Dini's erstwhile Forza Italia  allies.  The Party of
the Democratic Left, the Democratic Alliance and the Northern League,
wanted to avoid early elections, while the Forza Italia faction
insisted on but did not get a fixed date for elections.

NEW LEADERS FOR THE EU AND LUXEMBOURG

     On January 23, the first new EU president in 10 years,
Jacques Santer, presided over a new European Commission in Brussels.
He is expected to carry out the mandates of the Maastrict Treaty:
consolidating the single market, advancing the European monetary
system, and fashioning common foreign and defense policies.  More
important may be his ability to adapt EU edicts to the changing
times, a logic which will be exercised in the 1996
Intergovernmental Conference, designed to amend the 1991
Maastrict Treaty.  Finally, he will be required to formulate an expansion
policy for new members and policies of engagement for non-EU
Europe.
     Succeeding Santer as head of the government of Luxembourg,
Jean-Claude Juncker took the reins as prime minister on January
21. The 40-year old former finance and labor minister pledged to
continue the work of Santer's Social Christian party.  He will
serve out the remainder of Santer's term, which ends in June
1999.

PORTUGAL'S PRIME MINISTER WITHDRAWS FROM NEXT ELECTIONS

     On January 24, the district and regional leaders of the
prime minister's Social Democrat (PSD) party met to choose a successor
to Anibal Cavaco Silva after he announced he would not run in
elections in October.  His government's popularity has fallen
prey to economic recession, projected loss of parliamentary majority,
and a scandal stemming from a state corporation's breach of the
embargo on Indonesia.
     The government drew a wave of anger when it was revealed on
January 22 that General Aeronautical Workshop's (OGMA) had
accepted a contract to repair Indonesian Air Force helicopter engines.
The contract violates 1992 trade sanctions against Indonesia for
abuses of the population of East Timor.  This is the second such case in
as many months, the first involving illegal OGMA cooperation with
Angolan government armed forces.
     Opposition Communist party chairman Carlos Carvalhas called
for the government to resign and petitioned President Mario
Alberto Soares to call for early elections, while the more moderate
Socialists encouraged avoiding hasty dismissals and appeared to
wait for the October election.  Defense Minister Fernando Nogeira
was called upon to resign but refused, and denied that repairing
the engines either harmed the East Timorese or affected their
cause.  The prime minister defended OGMA and his government,
declaring that no government had fought as hard as the Portuguese
in favor of the East Timorese cause.  Opinion polls indicate his
PSD is unlikely to win a majority in the next election.  A
January 26 poll has the Socialists at 44.8 percent of the vote and 
PSD at 39.8 percent.

SPANISH PRIME MINISTER RECEIVES CATALAN ENDORSEMENT

     On February 9, the Catalan coalition Convergencia i Unio
supported the current Gonzalez government remaining in office at
least until the conclusion of the Spanish EU presidency at the
end of this year.  Felipe Gonzalez's grip on power withstood an
onslaught of criticism stemming from a difficult scandal in
January.  On January 10, El Mundo produced evidence that the
government had secretly paid 200 million peseta (about $1.5
million) to the families of policemen serving terms for
involvement in anti-ETA death squads in Basque country.  Euskadi to
Askatasuna (ETA-Basque Homeland and Liberty) is a "terrorist" 
organization in operation since 1959. The Grupos Antiterroristas 
de Liberaction (GAL) were formed in 1983 to opposed ETA.  Both 
groups are illegal.
     Pressure mounted on Gonzalez to resign as the private sector
also started taking a dimmer view of this continued tenure.  But
the prime minister of 13 years filed libel suits against all
those who linked the government with the GAL.

REFORMISTS APPOINTED IN CUBAN RESHUFFLE

     Cuba reshuffled its cabinet on January 24, replacing several
veteran bureaucrats with younger, reform-minded technocrats.  The
shakeup, which removed two vice presidents and appointed six new
ministers, was designed to give fresh momentum to the economic
reforms being carried out by President Fidel Castro's government.
     Osvaldo Marinez, a 51-year old economist, replaces Antonio
Rodriguez Maurell as minister of economy and planning.  As head
of the economic commission of the National Assembly, Martinez had
played a prominent role in implementing recent reforms to
decentralize and revitalize the country's recession-hit economy.
Maurell, who also lost his vice president post, had previously
headed the now-abolished central planning board that ran Cuba's
economy while the country was still a member of the Soviet bloc
Comecon.
     The most intriguing appointment was that of Francisco
Soberon Valdes as president of the central bank.  He had previously
headed Acemex, a Liechtenstein-registered management group of 23
companies engaged in shipping and finance operations between Cuba and 18
other nations, including Japan, Greece, Norway and Netherlands.
Soberon is a former Ministry of Trade official who has negotiated
financing deals in Britain and Europe.  He replaced Hector
Rodriguez Llompart, a veteran member of Cuba's economic policy
team and former planning board chairman.
     Over the past 18 months, the Cuban government has moved to
open up more of the economy to foreign investment and market-
oriented reforms.  In addition to creating more flexibility in
the bureaucracy through purges and reshuffles, the Cuban leadership
also intends to cut state subsidies, reduce the government budget
deficit and encourage profitability in state companies.

estimate that balloting can be organized within three months
after the election bill becomes law.  If Aristide signs the bill and
publishes in the official state gazette, a procedure necessary
for a bill to become law, elections can be held as early as May.  It
is unclear how Aristide will govern in the meantime with most of the
