Dear Ms. Mentz,<BR>

<P>
Thank you for dropping by our office last week. I am rolling a cigarette now. After consulting with my colleague, Hiram Rabinowitz, I have decided to take on your case. <BR>

<P>
How sorry I was to hear of the disappearance of your son, Randy, into the clutches of the Anka-Right Society. How terrible for you this must be. I am now shaping the cigarette into a fine cylinder with my slender, manicured fingers. My research into this cult shows that they exhibit a deranged fascination with the famous pop singer of the 1970s, Paul Anka. They believe that the lyrics to Anka's hit tunes, such as &quot;Havin' My Baby,&quot; &quot;One Man Woman, One Woman Man,&quot; and &quot;Lonely Boy,&quot; contain certain keys to successful living that only those with the proper awareness can decode. <BR>

<P>
I am now lighting the cigarette with my engraved platinum Zippo. The smoke curls mysteriously above my glossy, razor-cut hairstyle. <BR>

<P>
I think, Candace--may I call you that?--that we can find your son. Discreet inquiries have traced the Anka cult to the Haight-Ashbury district of San Francisco. Luckily my colleague, Hiram, has close ties with the San Francisco P.D. vice squad. I am exhaling through my sculpted nostrils. We are now commencing this inquiry. As you know, our fees are $200 per day plus expenses. We will let you know when we have achieved results in this important investigation.<BR>
<BR>

<P>
Warmest salutations,<BR>
<BR>
