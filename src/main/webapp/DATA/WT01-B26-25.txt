<p> This briefing report provides information on drug courts,\1 a
new </p>

<p> approach used by state and local governments to address
drug-related </p>

<p> crime. These courts monitor the treatment and behavior of
drug-using </p>

<p> defendants. </p>

<p> Title V of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act
of 1994 </p>

<p> (the 1994 Crime Act) authorizes the award of federal grants
for drug </p>

<p> courts. The act requires that we assess the effectiveness and
impact </p>

<p> of these grants and report to Congress by January 1, 1997. To
assist </p>

<p> Congress in its deliberations on whether to fund drug courts,
we </p>

<p> developed this preliminary report. Specifically, we gathered </p>

<p> information on drug courts in existence prior to the awarding
of </p>

<p> grants under the 1994 Crime Act, assessed evaluations of
these </p>

<p> courts, and reviewed the Department of Justice's (DOJ) </p>

<p> responsibilities and plans for implementing the federal drug
court </p>

<p> grant program. </p>

<p> During April and on May 11, 1995, we briefed the Committees
on the </p>

<p> results of our work. </p>

<p> -------------------- </p>

<p> \1 Throughout this briefing report, we use the terms drug
courts and </p>

<p> drug court programs interchangeably. </p>

<p> RESULTS </p>

<p> ------------------------------------------------------------
Letter :1 </p>

<p> In response to the deluge of drug cases since the late 1980s
and the </p>

<p> cycle of recidivism (rearrest rates) common to drug
offenders, some </p>

<p> state and local jurisdictions created drug courts, the
majority of </p>

<p> which have been operating since 1993. The main purpose of
drug </p>

<p> courts is to use the authority of the court to reduce crime
by </p>

<p> changing defendants' drug-using behavior. In exchange for the
</p>

<p> possibility of dismissed charges or reduced sentences,
defendants are </p>

<p> diverted to drug courts. Judges preside over drug court
proceedings, </p>

<p> monitor the progress of defendants through frequent status
hearings, </p>

<p> and prescribe sanctions and rewards as appropriate in
collaboration </p>

<p> with prosecutors, defense attorneys, treatment providers, and
others. </p>

<p> Although there are basic elements common to many drug court
programs, </p>

<p> they vary in terms of participant eligibility, length of the
program, </p>

<p> penalties and rewards, and other practices. The courts are
supported </p>

<p> by a variety of local, state, federal, and private funds and </p>

<p> participant fees, according to the Drug Court Resource
Center.\2 </p>

<p> As of March 1995, there were at least 37 drug courts
operating </p>

<p> nationwide, most of which had been fully operational for at
least 9 </p>

<p> months. Thirty-three drug courts responding to our
questionnaire </p>

<p> reported having accepted over 20,000 defendants, of whom a
third had </p>

<p> completed their programs. According to the Project Director
of the </p>

<p> Drug Court Resource Center, none of the drug courts accept
defendants </p>

<p> currently charged with a violent offense, and most do not
accept </p>

<p> defendants with prior violent convictions. However, at least
one </p>

<p> drug court accepts defendants regardless of prior offenses.
(See </p>

<p> sect. I for more general information on drug courts.) </p>

<p> We assessed six evaluations of five drug courts completed as
of March </p>

<p> 1995. Although some evaluation results indicated that drug
courts </p>

<p> may have some beneficial effects, limitations in their
designs and </p>

<p> methodologies, as well as the relative newness of drug
courts, </p>

<p> precluded firm conclusions about the overall impact of these </p>

<p> programs. The evaluations showed mixed results in recidivism
and </p>

<p> other defendant outcomes. For example, two evaluations showed
less </p>

<p> recidivism by drug court defendants. However, three other </p>

<p> evaluations showed no significant differences in recidivism. </p>

<p> Additionally, two evaluations of the same drug court showed </p>

<p> contrasting recidivism results. (See sect. II and app. III
for </p>

<p> more information on the evaluations we assessed.) </p>

<p> The 1994 Crime Act authorized the Attorney General to award
and </p>

<p> administer discretionary grants for drug court programs. A
key </p>

<p> requirement of the act is that violent offenders are
prohibited as </p>

<p> drug court participants. The act authorized $1 billion from
fiscal </p>

<p> years 1995 through 2000 to support drug court programs. For
fiscal </p>

<p> year 1995, $29 million was appropriated. However, Congress
has </p>

<p> proposed fiscal year 1995 budget cuts in a pending rescission
bill. </p>

<p> In addition, the House has passed legislation repealing the
drug </p>

<p> court grant program authorized in the 1994 Crime Act. </p>

<p> DOJ expects to award grants beginning in the summer of 1995.
The </p>

<p> 1994 Crime Act also authorizes the Attorney General to
provide for a </p>

<p> national evaluation of drug courts supported by federal
grants. DOJ </p>

<p> expects to complete the evaluation to assess the impact and </p>

<p> effectiveness of drug court grants in about 2 years. (See
sect. III </p>

<p> for more information.) </p>

<p> -------------------- </p>

<p> \2 The Bureau of Justice Assistance funds the Drug Court
Resource </p>

<p> Center. The Resource Center began operating October 1, 1994,
under </p>

<p> the direction of The American University in partnership with
the </p>

<p> National Center for State Courts and the National Consortium
of </p>

<p> Treatment Alternatives to Street Crime Programs. The Resource
Center </p>

<p> assists state and local justice system officials in planning,
</p>

<p> implementing, managing, and evaluating drug courts. It also
acts as </p>

<p> a clearinghouse and provides technical assistance and other
services </p>

<p> to jurisdictions interested in developing or expanding drug
courts. </p>

<p> OBJECTIVES, SCOPE, AND </p>

<p> METHODOLOGY </p>

<p> ------------------------------------------------------------
Letter :2 </p>

<p> In preparation for our 1997 mandated study, we initiated a </p>

<p> preliminary review of drug court programs. Our objectives
were to </p>

<p> determine </p>

<p> the number, location, and key elements of drug courts; </p>

<p> the results and validity of evaluations of drug courts; and </p>

<p> DOJ's responsibilities and plans for implementing statutory </p>

<p> requirements for the federal drug court grant program. </p>

<p> The Drug Court Resource Center, which is based at The
American </p>

<p> University, Washington, D.C., provided us with general
information on </p>

<p> drug courts. To obtain more current information, we sent a </p>

<p> questionnaire to 37 drug courts. We received responses from
33 drug </p>

<p> courts as of March 31, 1995. We did not verify the accuracy
of the </p>

<p> data provided to us by the Drug Court Resource Center and
drug </p>

<p> courts. In addition, we attended a January 1995 national
training </p>

<p> conference for drug court professionals in Las Vegas, NV, and
visited </p>

<p> drug courts in Las Vegas and Washington, D.C. </p>

<p> To determine the results and assess the validity of
evaluations of </p>

<p> drug courts, we obtained 11 drug court evaluations completed
as of </p>

<p> March 1, 1995, from the Drug Court Resource Center. These </p>

<p> evaluations were done by a variety of sources, including
independent </p>

<p> researchers, county officials, and court representatives. We </p>

<p> reviewed them and assessed the evaluative methodology used
and the </p>

<p> validity of reported findings. We did not analyze the
reported </p>

<p> results of three of them because they reported outcome data
for drug </p>

<p> court defendants without any reference to comparison or
control </p>

<p> groups. We were unable to assess the validity of one because
it did </p>

<p> not include a description of the methodology used. Two dealt
with </p>

<p> one drug court and were assessed as one evaluation because
one was a </p>

<p> follow-up to the other and contained the same methodology and
</p>

<p> findings. </p>

<p> To determine DOJ's responsibilities and plans for
implementing the </p>

<p> federal grant program, we met with representatives of the
Office of </p>

<p> Justice Programs, DOJ. We held discussions and reviewed
documents </p>

<p> regarding their responsibilities and plans for implementing
the </p>

<p> federally supported drug court program. We also obtained drug
court </p>

<p> funding information from the Department of Health and Human
Services' </p>

<p> Center for Substance Abuse Treatment. </p>

<p> Our review was done from January 1995 to April 1995 in
accordance </p>

<p> with generally accepted government auditing standards. </p>

<p> AGENCY COMMENTS </p>

<p> ------------------------------------------------------------
Letter :3 </p>

<p> In April 1995, we provided a draft of this report for comment
to the </p>

<p> Attorney General and the Project Director of the Drug Court
Resource </p>

<p> Center. </p>

<p> On April 21, 1995, we discussed the report with the Project
Director </p>

<p> of the Drug Court Resource Center. On May 5, 1995, we also
discussed </p>

<p> the report with the Deputy Assistant Attorney General and
other </p>

<p> officials from DOJ's Office of Justice Programs. These
officials </p>

<p> generally agreed with the information presented in the report
and </p>

<p> provided comments that we incorporated as appropriate. </p>

<p> DOJ officials said the report was positive, informative, and
will be </p>

<p> helpful to drug court professionals. They explained that
there is no </p>

<p> universal model for drug courts, and as a result, each drug
court </p>

<p> operates differently due to local needs and conditions.
Similarly, </p>

<p> the Project Director of the Drug Court Resource Center said
that the </p>

<p> information presented in the report was comprehensive,
accurate, and </p>

<p> objective. </p>

<p> ----------------------------------------------------------
Letter :3.1 </p>

<p> We are sending copies of this briefing report to other
interested </p>

<p> congressional committees and Members and the Attorney
General. </p>

<p> Copies will also be made available to others upon request. </p>

<p> The major contributors to this briefing report are listed in
appendix </p>

<p> IV. If you have any questions about this report, please call

Letter </p>

<p> TYPES OF DRUG COURTS </p>

<p> ------------------------------------------------------------
Letter :4 </p>

<p> (See figure in printed </p>

<p> edition.) </p>

<p> In the late 1980s, state and local criminal courts were
inundated </p>

<p> with drug cases. One response to this challenge was the
creation of </p>

<p> drug courts, a relatively recent grassroots movement to deal
with </p>

<p> drug-related crime and drug-using defendants. </p>

<p> According to DOJ, two main types of drug courts have evolved,
those </p>

<p> that (1) expedite the processing of drug cases and (2) use </p>

<p> court-monitored drug treatment to attempt to achieve changes
in </p>

<p> defendants' drug-using behavior. In addition, some drug
courts </p>

<p> combine these two types. </p>

<p> The 1994 Crime Act authorizes grants for those drug courts
that have </p>

<p> programs offering court supervised drug treatment. The act
does not </p>

<p> authorize grants for courts designed solely to expedite the </p>

<p> processing of drug cases. This briefing report provides
information </p>

<p> on drug treatment courts. </p>

<p> Courts offering court-monitored drug treatment are referred
to as </p>

<p> &quot;drug treatment courts&quot; or simply &quot;drug
courts.&quot; Although there is no </p>

<p> standard definition applicable to drug treatment courts, the
National </p>

<p> Association of Drug Court Professionals\3 defines them as
follows: </p>

<p> &quot;A Drug Court is a special court given the
responsibility to </p>

<p> handle cases involving less serious drug using-offenders
through </p>

<p> a supervision and treatment program. These programs include </p>

<p> frequent drug testing, judicial and probation supervision,
drug </p>

<p> counseling, treatment, educational opportunities, and the use
of </p>

<p> sanctions and incentives.&quot; </p>

<p> One of the first drug courts to employ drug treatment as an
integral </p>

<p> part of the processing of drug felonies is located in Dade
County </p>

<p> (Miami), FL, and began operations in June 1989. This court
became a </p>

<p> model for other jurisdictions that implemented drug courts. </p>

<p> Although drug courts share certain common elements such as </p>

<p> court-monitored treatment, the courts are uniquely designed
to meet </p>

<p> local needs and can vary considerably in the way they
operate. </p>

<p> Organizationally, drug courts generally are distinct parts of
trial </p>

<p> courts. </p>

<p> -------------------- </p>

<p> \3 This is the principal organization of professionals
involved in </p>

<p> the development of treatment-oriented drug courts. Its
members </p>

<p> include judges, prosecutors, defense attorneys, treatment
service </p>

<p> providers, educators, researchers, and community leaders. </p>

<p> DRUG COURT APPROACHES </p>

<p> ------------------------------------------------------------
Letter :5 </p>

<p> (See figure in printed </p>

<p> edition.) </p>

<p> DRUG COURT APPROACHES </p>

<p> ----------------------------------------------------------
Letter :5.1 </p>

<p> According to a report provided by the Drug Court Resource
Center, </p>

<p> drug courts have generally taken two approaches to processing
cases: </p>

<p> (1) deferred prosecution and (2) postadjudication. In the
deferred </p>

<p> prosecution approach, shortly after being charged, defendants
waive </p>

<p> their right to a speedy trial and enter a treatment program. </p>

<p> Defendants who fail to complete the treatment program have
their </p>

<p> charges adjudicated. Defendants who complete the treatment
program </p>

<p> are not prosecuted further or have their charges dismissed.
This </p>

<p> approach is intended to capitalize on the trauma of arrest
and offers </p>

<p> defendants the opportunity to obtain treatment and avoid the </p>

<p> possibility of a felony conviction. </p>

<p> In the postadjudication approach, defendants are tried and
convicted, </p>

<p> but their sentences are deferred or pronounced and
incarceration is </p>

<p> suspended until they complete or withdraw from the treatment
program. </p>

<p> This approach provides an incentive for the defendant to
rehabilitate </p>

<p> because progress toward rehabilitation is factored into the </p>

<p> sentencing determination. </p>

<p> Appendix I presents examples of how cases are processed under
the two </p>

<p> drug court approaches. </p>

<p> PARTICIPANT ELIGIBILITY </p>

<p> CRITERIA </p>

<p> ------------------------------------------------------------
Letter :6 </p>

<p> (See figure in printed </p>

<p> edition.) </p>

<p> PARTICIPANT ELIGIBILITY </p>

<p> CRITERIA </p>

<p> ----------------------------------------------------------
Letter :6.1 </p>

<p> According to the Drug Court Resource Center, drug courts
generally </p>

<p> accept defendants with substance abuse problems who are
currently </p>

<p> charged with drug possession and/or other nonviolent offenses
such as </p>

<p> property crimes. Some drug courts accept defendants who have
prior </p>

<p> convictions, and others do not. </p>

<p> The Project Director of the Drug Court Resource Center also
pointed </p>

<p> out that drug courts do not accept defendants currently
charged with </p>

<p> a violent offense. The Project Director further commented
that most </p>

<p> drug courts do not accept defendants with prior violent
offenses. </p>

<p> However, at least one drug court accepts defendants
regardless of </p>

<p> prior offenses possibly including defendants with prior
convictions </p>

<p> for violent crimes. Under the 1994 Crime Act, federal grants
cannot </p>

<p> be awarded to any drug court that allows either current or
past </p>

<p> violent offenders to participate in its program. </p>

<p> DRUG COURT PLAYERS </p>

<p> ------------------------------------------------------------
Letter :7 </p>

<p> (See figure in printed </p>

<p> edition.) </p>

<p> DRUG COURT PLAYERS </p>

<p> ----------------------------------------------------------
Letter :7.1 </p>

<p> According to a DOJ-funded report on the first national drug
court </p>

<p> conference,\4 judicial leadership is the foundation on which
the </p>

<p> overall drug court approach is most often built. A
jurisdiction's </p>

<p> trial court provides the leadership, authority, and
management </p>

<p> capacity to enable the drug court to operate. The drug court
is </p>

<p> headed by a judge whose role is generally expanded beyond
normal </p>

<p> court duties to include active involvement in monitoring the
status </p>

<p> of defendants in the treatment program. The judge's duties
may </p>

<p> include conducting hearings, reviewing treatment progress
reports, </p>

<p> issuing bench warrants, and deciding who may enter the
program and </p>

<p> who should be terminated considering recommendations of
prosecutors, </p>

<p> public defenders, and treatment providers. </p>

<p> The judiciary alone, however, cannot successfully implement
and </p>

<p> operate a drug court, according to the conference report.
Rather, a </p>

<p> drug court requires a special collaborative effort among
judges, </p>

<p> prosecutors, defense attorneys, and related criminal justice
agencies </p>

<p> along with treatment providers and other social services and </p>

<p> community organizations. This collaborative effort is based
on local </p>

<p> needs and the targeted population being served and may differ
</p>

<p> considerably among drug courts. </p>

<p> Specifically, drug courts create new and different roles for </p>

<p> prosecutors and defense attorneys. In most drug courts these
players </p>

<p> are not adversaries in the traditional sense but rather are
to work </p>

<p> in concert with the court for the sole purpose of helping
defendants </p>

<p> become drug free. This nonadversarial role is significant
because </p>

<p> the court does not arbitrate in the usual fashion and has the
</p>

<p> opportunity to address addiction-related issues. Further,
drug </p>

<p> courts place the defendant in the unique role of being held
publicly </p>

<p> accountable for his or her actions. </p>

<p> COMMON ELEMENTS OF DRUG COURT </p>

<p> PROGRAMS </p>

<p> (See figure in printed </p>

<p> edition.) </p>

<p> COMMON ELEMENTS OF DRUG </p>

<p> COURT PROGRAMS </p>

<p> ----------------------------------------------------------
Letter :8.1 </p>

<p> According to the Drug Court Resource Center, in most drug
courts, </p>

<p> treatment is designed to usually last at least 1 year and is </p>

<p> administered on an outpatient basis with limited inpatient
treatment </p>

<p> as needed to address special detoxification or relapse
situations.\5 </p>

<p> These courts operate with the philosophy that because drug
addiction </p>

<p> is a disease relapses can occur, and that the court must
respond with </p>

<p> progressive sanctions and/or enhance treatment rather than </p>

<p> immediately terminate a participant. </p>

<p> The central element of all drug court programs is attendance
at the </p>

<p> regularly scheduled status hearings at which the drug court
judge </p>

<p> monitors the progress of participants. Monitoring is based on
</p>

<p> treatment provider reports on urine test results that detect
drug </p>

<p> use, attendance at counseling, etc. The judge reinforces
progress </p>

<p> and addresses noncompliance with program requirements. The
primary </p>

<p> objective of the status hearing is to keep the defendant in </p>

<p> treatment. </p>

<p> -------------------- </p>

<p> \5 These programs recognize that some individuals will
require a </p>

<p> longer period to complete the program. </p>

<p> Overall, according to the Drug Court Resource Center,
treatment </p>

<p> program requirements are more demanding than the applicable
sanction </p>

<p> received through traditional adjudication. Most drug court
programs </p>

<p> require that defendants attend status hearings, participate
in </p>

<p> counseling sessions, and submit to urine tests with the goal
of </p>

<p> becoming drug free. Some programs focus on special classes of
</p>

<p> defendants such as women. Many programs also provide support </p>

<p> services such as public health services; assistance with
housing, </p>

<p> food, and child care; vocational training; and job placement.
</p>

<p> TREATMENT PHASES </p>

<p> -----------------------------------------------------------
Letter :10 </p>

<p> (See figure in printed </p>

<p> edition.) </p>

<p> TREATMENT PHASES </p>

<p> ---------------------------------------------------------
Letter :10.1 </p>

<p> Treatment services are generally divided into three phases:
(1) </p>

<p> detoxification, (2) stabilization, and (3) aftercare. First,
the </p>

<p> defendant's physical dependence on drugs is eliminated
through </p>

<p> detoxification. Acupuncture is sometimes used as an adjunct
to </p>

<p> treatment in the detoxification phase. According to the
Project </p>

<p> Director of the Drug Court Resource Center, 9 of 20 drug
courts </p>

<p> responding to the Center's 1994 survey indicated that they
used </p>

<p> acupuncture. Second, the defendant's psychological craving
for the </p>

<p> drugs is treated during stabilization. Frequent group and/or </p>

<p> individual counseling sessions are employed during this
phase. And </p>

<p> third, aftercare focuses on helping the defendant obtain
education or </p>

<p> job training, find a job, and remain drug free. </p>

<p> PROGRAM SANCTIONS </p>

<p> -----------------------------------------------------------
Letter :11 </p>

<p> (See figure in printed </p>

<p> edition.) </p>

<p> PROGRAM SANCTIONS </p>

<p> ---------------------------------------------------------
Letter :11.1 </p>

<p> Sanctions for failing to abide by program rules can include
(1) </p>

<p> verbal admonition from the judge; (2) demotion to an earlier
stage of </p>

<p> the program; (3) incarceration for several days or weeks,
increasing </p>

<p> with the number and severity of the violations; and (4) more
frequent </p>

<p> status hearings, treatment sessions, or urine tests. Many
programs </p>

<p> also use graduated sanctions, increasing the severity of the
sanction </p>

<p> with subsequent violations of program rules. </p>

<p> DOJ also pointed out that most drug courts use sanctions not
to </p>

<p> simply punish inappropriate behavior but to augment the
treatment </p>

<p> process. For example, many drug courts will place a defendant
in </p>

<p> residential treatment if he or she is unable to achieve
satisfactory </p>

<p> progress in an outpatient setting. In addition, many drug
courts </p>

<p> incarcerate defendants for the purpose of detoxification
rather than </p>

<p> detain them for inappropriate behavior. </p>

<p> REASONS FOR TERMINATING </p>

<p> DEFENDANTS FROM THE PROGRAM </p>

<p> -----------------------------------------------------------
Letter :12 </p>

<p> (See figure in printed </p>

<p> edition.) </p>

<p> REASONS FOR TERMINATING </p>

<p> DEFENDANTS FROM THE PROGRAM </p>

<p> ---------------------------------------------------------
Letter :12.1 </p>

<p> Drug courts use various criteria for ending a defendant's </p>

<p> participation in the program before completion. These may
include a </p>

<p> new felony offense; multiple failures to comply with program </p>

<p> requirements, such as not attending status hearings or
treatment </p>

<p> sessions; and a pattern of positive urine tests. According to
DOJ, </p>

<p> many drug courts do not terminate defendants for a new drug </p>

<p> possession offense. </p>

<p> Before terminating a defendant for continuing to use drugs,
drug </p>

<p> courts will use an array of treatment services and available </p>

<p> sanctions. There are no uniform standards for the number of
failed </p>

<p> urine tests and failures to attend treatment sessions that
result in </p>

<p> a participant being terminated that apply to all programs.
Each drug </p>

<p> court sets its own standards. Relapses are expected and the
extent </p>

<p> to which noncompliance results in terminations varies from
program to </p>

<p> program. </p>

<p> Generally, the drug court judge makes the decision to
terminate, but </p>

<p> the prosecutor or treatment provider can recommend the
termination. </p>

<p> Once a defendant is terminated, he or she will be referred
for </p>

<p> adjudication or sentencing. </p>

<p> PROGRAM GRADUATION REQUIREMENTS </p>

<p> -----------------------------------------------------------
Letter :13 </p>

<p> (See figure in printed </p>

<p> edition.) </p>

<p> PROGRAM GRADUATION </p>

<p> REQUIREMENTS </p>

<p> ---------------------------------------------------------
Letter :13.1 </p>

<p> Drug courts typically require defendants to complete a
treatment </p>

<p> program in order to graduate. Some impose other conditions </p>

<p> defendants must meet after treatment. These could include
remaining </p>

<p> drug free and not being arrested for a specified period of
time, </p>

<p> paying restitution, being employed full-time, or performing
community </p>

<p> service. </p>

<p> For example, the Seattle, WA, drug court requires that a
defendant </p>

<p> complete all phases of the program to graduate. However, the </p>

<p> Beaumont, TX, drug court requires that, in addition to
completing the </p>

<p> treatment program, the defendant maintain sobriety for a
specified </p>

<p> time and participate in education and vocational training
and/or be </p>

<p> working full-time. </p>

<p> EFFECTS OF PROGRAM GRADUATION </p>

<p> ON CASE OUTCOME </p>

<p> -----------------------------------------------------------
Letter :14 </p>

<p> (See figure in printed </p>

<p> edition.) </p>

<p> EFFECTS OF PROGRAM </p>

<p> GRADUATION ON CASE OUTCOME </p>

<p> ---------------------------------------------------------
Letter :14.1 </p>

<p> In many jurisdictions, completion of the drug court program
leads to </p>

<p> a dismissal of charges or cessation of prosecution. In
others, the </p>

<p> guilty plea can be stricken, the defendant can be sentenced
to </p>

<p> probation in lieu of incarceration, or the defendant's
probation can </p>

<p> be shortened. </p>

<p> DOJ pointed out that some drug courts will seal all case
records, </p>

<p> including arrests, when defendants complete the program. The
sealing </p>

<p> of records is particularly significant when attempting to
measure the </p>

<p> impact of drug court programs at a later date. </p>

<p> ---------------------------------------------------------
Letter :15.1 </p>

<p> According to the Drug Court Resource Center, as of March
1995, there </p>

<p> were at least 37 drug courts operating across the country.\6
Of these </p>

<p> drug courts, 29 had been fully operational for at least 9
months, and </p>

<p> 8 others had been operating for a lesser period. </p>

<p> The number of drug courts steadily increased from 1991 to
1994, with </p>

<p> substantial increases since 1993. As of March 1995, 24
jurisdictions </p>

<p> were developing drug courts. Another eight jurisdictions had </p>

<p> exhibited interest in starting drug courts by initiating
feasibility </p>

<p> studies. </p>

<p> Appendix II lists the number of drug courts in operation and

<p> DRUG COURT PARTICIPANTS' </p>

<p> STATUS AS OF MARCH 1995 </p>

<p> ---------------------------------------------------------
Letter :17.1 </p>

<p> Data obtained from 33 of 37 drug courts responding to our </p>

<p> questionnaire showed that since inception of the first drug
court in </p>

<p> 1989, 20,421 persons have participated in drug courts. Of
these, </p>

<p> 7,235 participants have graduated, and 7,595 are currently in
the </p>

<p> programs. The remaining participants did not complete the
programs. </p>

<p> Generally, when participants do not complete drug court
programs it </p>

<p> is because they were terminated, voluntarily withdrew, or
died. </p>

<p> Based on the data received, these totaled 5,591.\7 </p>

<p> The number of participants currently in each of these drug
court </p>

<p> programs varied widely, ranging from a low of 1 participant
in Santa </p>

<p> Ana, CA, a new drug court,\8 to a high of 1,200 participants
in </p>

<p> Miami, FL, one of the oldest drug courts. The median number
of </p>

<p> participants in these drug court programs is 105. </p>

<p> It should be noted that many of the drug courts have been
operating </p>

<p> for less than a year and would not yet have graduates. As
shown, </p>

<p> more than one-third of the total participants are currently
enrolled </p>

<p> in drug court programs. </p>

<p> -------------------- </p>

<p> \7 We calculated the number (5,591) of participants not
completing </p>

<p> the programs by subtracting the number (7,235) of graduates
and the </p>

<p> number (7,595) of participants currently in the programs from
the </p>

<p> total number (20,421) of participants in the programs since
their </p>

<p> inception. </p>

<p> \8 At the time of our review, Orange County, CA, had filed
for </p>

<p> bankruptcy and curtailed resources for its drug court. </p>

<p> FUNDING SOURCES </p>

<p> -----------------------------------------------------------
Letter :18 </p>

<p> (See figure in printed </p>

<p> edition.) </p>

<p> According to the Drug Court Resource Center Project Director,
drug </p>

<p> courts generally piece together funding from a variety of
sources. </p>

<p> Information reported to the Drug Court Resource Center by 15
drug </p>

<p> courts showed that these sources included local taxes and
surcharges, </p>

<p> state alcohol and drug agency funds, private foundation
monies, </p>

<p> participant fees, and federal grants. </p>

<p> Some drug courts have developed innovative funding
approaches. For </p>

<p> example, a drug court judge from Orange County, CA, told us
that when </p>

<p> the county filed for bankruptcy, it cut back services
necessary for </p>

<p> the drug court operation. The judge said that he was forming
a </p>

<p> nonprofit corporation to try to provide funding for the drug
court </p>

<p> outside of the bankruptcy proceedings. </p>

<p> Until the 1994 Crime Act, there was no federal grant program </p>

<p> specifically designed for drug courts. However, some drug
courts </p>

<p> have received federal grants and technical assistance from
the </p>

<p> Department of Health and Human Services' Center for Substance
Abuse </p>

<p> Treatment (CSAT) and DOJ's Bureau of Justice Assistance
(BJA). </p>

<p> According to CSAT, it has provided or plans to provide an
estimated </p>

<p> $15 million in assistance to some drug courts. Of the $15
million, </p>

<p> about $6 million is for a drug court demonstration project
for the </p>

<p> District of Columbia Superior Court. </p>

<p> BJA could not provide us with complete information on DOJ
grants used </p>

<p> in support of drug courts. According to a BJA official,
&quot;drug </p>

<p> courts&quot; was not a specific grant category that grantees
could </p>

<p> designate for funding. However, this official commented that
BJA is </p>

<p> aware that DOJ grant funds provided under other grant
categories such </p>

<p> as &quot;corrections options&quot; have been used in support
of drug courts, </p>

<p> and that three drug courts had received $2.5 million from the
</p>

<p> Corrections Options program.\9 </p>

<p> -------------------- </p>

<p> \9 The Corrections Options program assists states with
design, </p>

<p> development, and implementation of innovative alternatives to
</p>

<p> traditional modes of incarceration. </p>

<p> PARTICIPANT FEES </p>

<p> -----------------------------------------------------------
Letter :19 </p>

<p> (See figure in printed </p>

<p> edition.) </p>

<p> PARTICIPANT FEES </p>

<p> ---------------------------------------------------------
Letter :19.1 </p>

<p> We obtained data (based on our questionnaire and information
provided </p>

<p> by the Drug Court Resource Center) from 34 drug courts on
fees </p>

<p> charged to participants in drug court programs. Twenty-three
of the </p>

<p> 34 drug courts reported that they charged fees, and 11
reported that </p>

<p> they did not. Insufficient data on fee amounts actually
collected </p>

<p> precluded us from determining the extent to which drug courts
relied </p>

<p> on participant fees as a funding source. </p>

<p> Of the 23 drug courts charging participant fees, the amounts
charged </p>

<p> for the total cost of treatment ranged from $20 to $2,500.
One drug </p>

<p> court reported charging fees on a sliding scale from $60 to
$300 for </p>

<p> treatment based on a defendant's ability to pay, while
another </p>

<p> reported charging on a sliding scale from $500 to $2,500. At
least </p>

<p> nine courts responded that they charged fees ranging from
$200 to </p>

<p> $350. </p>

<p> Several drug courts reported applying participant fees to
counseling </p>

<p> and treatment costs, drug testing costs, and other program
expenses. </p>

<p> In addition, DOJ commented that many treatment providers
believe </p>

<p> participant fees are a useful therapeutic tool and should be
charged </p>

<p> regardless of the extent to which fees are needed to cover
program </p>

<p> costs. </p>

<p> COST SAVINGS </p>

<p> -----------------------------------------------------------
Letter :20 </p>

<p> (See figure in printed </p>

<p> edition.) </p>

<p> COST SAVINGS </p>

<p> ---------------------------------------------------------
Letter :20.1 </p>

<p> Drug courts have reported information to the Drug Court
Resource </p>

<p> Center on savings that they believe their programs have
achieved in </p>

<p> the costs of court and other criminal justice system
operations. </p>

<p> One of the larger categories of savings reported by drug
courts was </p>

<p> jail costs avoided, i.e., the estimated costs of
incarcerating a </p>

<p> typical drug court defendant that would be expected to incur
if </p>

<p> he/she were not participating in a drug court program. One
court </p>

<p> estimated savings of $5,400 per drug court participant, and
another </p>

<p> estimated savings of $2,566 to $5,185. </p>

<p> Another drug court claimed a savings of $2 million over a
3-year </p>

<p> period resulting from drug court participants spending fewer
days in </p>

<p> custody and the consequent ability of the county to rent
unused jail </p>

<p> cells to other law enforcement agencies. Still another drug
court </p>

<p> estimated it had saved about $875,500 in jail costs for its
program </p>

<p> but did not specify the time frame. </p>

<p> The National Association of Drug Court Professionals noted
that drug </p>

<p> court programs are much less costly than the incarceration of
</p>

<p> drug-using offenders. The Association reported that
incarceration of </p>

<p> drug-using offenders ranges from $20,000 to $50,000 annually,
and the </p>

<p> cost to build a prison cell is $80,000 to $90,000. It also
said that </p>

<p> drug courts cost less than $1,500 annually for each offender.
</p>

<p> Some drug courts identified savings such as reduced caseloads
of </p>

<p> other trial judges not in the drug court program. In
addition, some </p>

<p> drug courts claimed savings in court-appointed attorney fees,
reduced </p>

<p> probation office caseloads, and costs of prosecution,
arrests, and </p>

<p> police overtime. </p>

<p> We did not verify this information, and further analysis of
all drug </p>

<p> court costs is essential to fully understanding the benefits
of these </p>

<p> programs. </p>

==============================================================
Letter </p>

<p> DO DRUG COURTS MAKE A </p>

<p> DIFFERENCE? </p>

<p> -----------------------------------------------------------
Letter :21 </p>

<p> (See figure in printed </p>

<p> edition.) </p>

<p> In evaluating the effectiveness of drug courts, the basic
question </p>

<p> is: Do drug courts make a difference? Specifically, do
defendants </p>

<p> who successfully complete drug court programs exhibit reduced
</p>

<p> recidivism, decreased drug use, and other socially beneficial
effects </p>

<p> as a result of participating in drug court programs when
compared to </p>

<p> their counterparts, i.e., control groups who were not exposed
to the </p>

<p> same drug court treatment? </p>

<p> Based on evaluations we reviewed, drug courts generally may
have some </p>

<p> beneficial effects. However, because of the nature of the
study </p>

<p> designs and the short periods of time elapsed between
treatment and </p>

<p> measurement of outcomes (drug courts are relatively new),
firm </p>

<p> conclusions cannot be drawn about the effects of drug courts.
</p>

<p> It is both difficult and costly to conduct program
evaluations that </p>

<p> can measure program effects. Although the strongest design
involves </p>

<p> assembling and randomly assigning defendants to control
groups </p>

<p> (comparing drug courts versus traditional courts, for
example), such </p>

<p> studies raise serious logistical and ethical issues.
Additionally, </p>

<p> according to the Project Director of the Drug Court Resource
Center, </p>

<p> control groups cannot be used properly unless a drug court is
</p>

<p> originally designed to define such groups. </p>

<p> An alternative approach is to design studies allowing the
researcher </p>

<p> to create comparable groups from existing programs, through
the use </p>

<p> of various analytical techniques. However, even such studies
are </p>

<p> often made more difficult by the fact that existing programs
change </p>

<p> over time, resulting in individuals at the end of the study
period </p>

<p> being exposed to different treatments than those at the
beginning. </p>

<p> Also, different locations of the same program may have very
different </p>

<p> implementation needs, making it more difficult to compare
such </p>

<p> programs. </p>

<p> GAO ASSESSED DRUG COURT </p>

<p> EVALUATIONS </p>

<p> -----------------------------------------------------------
Letter :22 </p>

<p> (See figure in printed </p>

<p> edition.) </p>

<p> We assessed six evaluations that compared performance
outcomes for </p>

<p> drug court defendants to the experiences of other defendants,
i.e., </p>

<p> previous divertees or unsuccessful drug court defendants or </p>

<p> defendants who had never been in a drug court. In order to
determine </p>

<p> whether a drug court has an impact on its participants, an
evaluation </p>

<p> should compare outcomes of drug court defendants to those of
other </p>

<p> groups of similar defendants who are not in drug courts. </p>

<p> The six evaluations covered five drug courts and varied
considerably </p>

<p> in terms of the study designs, types of outcomes measured,
and scope </p>

<p> of analyses performed on the available information. Our
assessment </p>

<p> indicates that the evaluations differed particularly in terms
of the </p>

<p> validity of the designs, which determine the extent to which
the </p>

<p> reader is able to draw conclusions from any findings. Of the
six </p>

<p> studies: </p>

<p> two studies had fairly strong designs; of these, one provided
some </p>

<p> evidence of an effect of the drug court program, and the
other </p>

<p> study's results were too preliminary to draw any conclusions;
</p>

<p> two studies had designs with more serious problems; of these,
one </p>

<p> suggested possible effects of the program, and the other was </p>

<p> inconclusive; and </p>

<p> two studies had design weaknesses that prevented any
conclusions </p>

<p> about the effects of the program. </p>

<p> The major outcome measure used, in five of the six
evaluations, was </p>

<p> recidivism (rearrest rates). To a lesser degree,
recidivism-related </p>

<p> measures were also used, such as length of time before
rearrest and </p>

<p> days spent in custody for felony offenses. We focused on
these </p>

<p> measures in this report because they provided the strongest
evidence </p>

<p> for the long-term effect of the drug court programs, even
though </p>

<p> other measures were used in these studies. </p>

<p> EVALUATION OUTCOMES </p>

<p> -----------------------------------------------------------
Letter :23 </p>

<p> (See figure in printed </p>

<p> edition.) </p>

<p> Two of the six evaluations were well-designed. However, the
results </p>

<p> in terms of recidivism outcomes were mixed. One of the
evaluations </p>

<p> showed that drug court defendants had significantly lower
rearrest </p>

<p> rates than defendants not in drug court, and that they spent
fewer </p>

<p> days in custody for felony offenses (app. III, evaluation 1).
This </p>

<p> evaluation also showed that drug court defendants had a lower
rate of </p>

<p> failures-to-appear for required court hearings than did other
</p>

<p> defendants. However, the other evaluation, with preliminary </p>

<p> information only, showed no significant difference so far in
rearrest </p>

<p> rates between drug court defendants and defendants who were
not in </p>

<p> the drug court (app. III, evaluation 2). </p>

<p> Although these evaluations have strong study designs and one </p>

<p> indicates some beneficial effects on defendants resulting
from the </p>

<p> drug court programs, the evidence does not permit firm
conclusions </p>

<p> about the effects of the drug courts studied. Additionally,
for one </p>

<p> of the evaluations, insufficient time had elapsed to provide
firmer </p>

<p> evidence of program effect. </p>

<p> Of the next two evaluations, both of the same drug court, one
</p>

<p> provided some suggestive evidence of program effect. It
showed lower </p>

<p> recidivism by drug court defendants and longer time before
rearrest </p>

<p> (app. III, evaluation 3). The other generally showed no
difference </p>

<p> in recidivism rates (app. III, evaluation 4). Design problems
made </p>

<p> it difficult to attribute these findings to the programs.
There are </p>

<p> too many potential differences between the drug court
participants </p>

<p> and the groups to which they were compared to develop strong </p>

<p> conclusions. </p>

<p> The final two evaluations did not provide reliable evidence </p>

<p> concerning the effects of the programs. One showed no
substantial </p>

<p> difference in recidivism between drug court defendants and
defendants </p>

<p> who left the drug court (app. III, evaluation 5). The other </p>

<p> evaluation measured defendants' drug abstinence and
failure-to-appear </p>

<p> rates and showed positive results for drug court defendants
as </p>

<p> compared to defendants terminated from the drug court (app.
III, </p>

<p> evaluation 6). Because the study design did not control for a
number </p>

<p> of factors, such as motivation and susceptibility to
treatment, these </p>

<p> evaluations do not permit conclusions to be drawn about the
effects </p>

<p> of the programs. </p>

<p> evaluations. </p>

with </p>

<p> drug court grants. Title V of the Violent Crime Control and
Law </p>

<p> Enforcement Act of 1994 (Public Law 103-322) authorizes the
Attorney </p>

<p> General to award discretionary drug court grants to states,
units of </p>

<p> local government, Indian tribal governments, and state and
local </p>

<p> courts. Grants may be awarded to drug court programs when a
judge </p>

<p> continuously supervises the progress of nonviolent offenders
with </p>

<p> substance abuse problems. </p>

<p> The act requires the Attorney General to issue regulations to
ensure </p>

<p> that jurisdictions receiving drug court grants to support
their </p>

<p> programs do not allow violent offenders to participate. It
defines a </p>

<p> violent offender as a person who is charged with or convicted
of an </p>

<p> offense involving a firearm, dangerous weapon, death, serious
bodily </p>

<p> injury, or force; or who has one or more prior convictions
for a </p>

<p> violent felony crime. </p>

<p> Drug court programs must also integrate a number of judicial </p>

<p> sanctions and treatment services. Specifically, the act
requires </p>

<p> programs to include (1) mandatory periodic testing for the
use of </p>

<p> addictive substances; (2) substance abuse treatment; (3)
diversion, </p>

<p> probation, or other supervised releases with the possibility
of </p>

<p> prosecution, confinement, or incarceration when participants
do not </p>

<p> comply with program requirements or fail to show satisfactory
</p>

<p> progress; and (4) program and aftercare services, such as
relapse </p>

<p> prevention, health care, education, vocational training, job </p>

<p> placement, housing placement, and child care. </p>

<p> FEDERAL FUNDING FOR DRUG COURTS </p>

<p> -----------------------------------------------------------

<p> (See figure in printed </p>

<p> edition.) </p>

<p> FEDERAL FUNDING FOR DRUG </p>

<p> COURTS </p>

<p> ---------------------------------------------------------
Letter :25.1 </p>

<p> The 1994 Crime Act authorized a total of $1 billion for
fiscal years </p>

<p> 1995 through 2000 to support drug court programs. Although
the act </p>

<p> authorized $100 million for fiscal year 1995, DOJ's fiscal
year 1995 </p>

<p> Appropriations Act (Public Law 103-317) included only $29
million for </p>

<p> the drug court program. However, Congress has proposed fiscal
year </p>

<p> 1995 budget cuts for the drug court program. On March 16,
1995, the </p>

<p> House passed H.R. 1158, the Emergency Supplemental
Appropriations </p>

<p> Act of 1995, which rescinds $27.75 million for the drug court
</p>

<p> program. During its consideration of H.R. 1158, the Senate
reduced </p>

<p> the rescission to $17.1 million. On April 6, 1995, the Senate
passed </p>

<p> its version of the bill and requested a conference with the
House. </p>

<p> The House and Senate conferees began May 3, 1995, to try to
reconcile </p>

<p> the separate provisions of the bill. </p>

<p> The President's fiscal year 1996 budget requests $150 million
for </p>

<p> drug court grants. However, H.R. 667 (The Violent Crime </p>

<p> Incarceration Act of 1995) passed by the House of
Representatives on </p>

<p> February 10, 1995, would amend Title V of the 1994 Crime Act
and in </p>

<p> doing so would repeal the 1994 Crime Act's drug court
discretionary </p>

<p> grant provisions. On February 22, 1995, H.R. 667 was referred
to </p>

<p> the Senate Committee on the Judiciary. </p>

<p> DOJ'S RESPONSIBILITIES FOR DRUG </p>

<p> COURTS </p>

<p> -----------------------------------------------------------
Letter :26 </p>

<p> (See figure in printed </p>

<p> edition.) </p>

<p> DOJ recognizes that no single model exists for an effective
drug </p>

<p> court. Consequently, DOJ plans to maintain flexibility in
awarding </p>

<p> grants to programs that use a variety of approaches to
coordinate </p>

<p> drug treatment and persuade offenders to abstain from drugs
with the </p>

<p> goal of becoming drug free. In addition, given the great
diversity </p>

<p> in the structure and operation of state and local courts and
criminal </p>

<p> justice systems, DOJ plans to allow jurisdictions to tailor
local </p>

<p> initiatives to best suit their needs and local conditions. </p>

<p> DOJ's Office of Justice Programs (OJP) has overall
responsibility for </p>

<p> the new federal drug court program, including policy setting.
To </p>

<p> carry out this responsibility, OJP has hired an acting
director and </p>

<p> policy analyst to staff its Drug Court Program Office. In
addition, </p>

<p> BJA, an office of OJP, recently established a Drug Court
Program </p>

<p> Office to manage and monitor drug court program grants,
according to </p>

<p> an OJP official. BJA has hired four people to staff this
office. </p>

<p> Since November 1994, OJP and BJA staffs have worked together
to </p>

<p> develop program guidelines and application materials.\10 </p>

<p> Currently, these staffs are considering the most appropriate
and </p>

<p> effective ways of providing technical assistance to federally
</p>

<p> supported drug courts, operating drug courts, and related
federal </p>

<p> projects to be funded with other fiscal year 1995 resources.
The </p>

<p> level and source of funding to support this technical
assistance is </p>

<p> also under review. </p>

<p> OJP's National Institute of Justice (NIJ) is responsible for
funding </p>

<p> a national evaluation of drug court program impacts. This
evaluation </p>

<p> will assess whether federally supported drug court programs
have </p>

<p> helped their participants to break the cycle of substance
abuse and </p>

<p> crime. It will also assess the cost-effectiveness of these
programs. </p>

<p> NIJ is also responsible for ensuring that drug court programs
use </p>

<p> part of their grants to conduct process evaluations. These
are aimed </p>

<p> at determining, among other things, if the drug court is
achieving </p>

<p> its objectives, if it was implemented as originally intended,
and </p>

<p> whether major changes are appropriate. They will also examine
how </p>

<p> drug courts affect the rest of the court system and other
elements of </p>

<p> the criminal justice system. </p>

<p> -------------------- </p>

<p> \10 In March 1995, DOJ published Drug Court Grant Program
Guidelines </p>

<p> and Application Information. </p>

<p> FISCAL YEAR 1995 DRUG COURT </p>

<p> GRANT PROGRAM </p>

<p> -----------------------------------------------------------
Letter :27 </p>

<p> (See figure in printed </p>

<p> edition.) </p>

<p> FISCAL YEAR 1995 DRUG COURT </p>

<p> GRANT PROGRAM </p>

<p> ---------------------------------------------------------
Letter :27.1 </p>

<p> If Congress does not rescind the fiscal year 1995
appropriation, DOJ </p>

<p> plans to award grants for planning, implementing, and
improving or </p>

<p> enhancing drug court programs. Eligible applicants may apply
only </p>

<p> for one type of grant. Assuming no rescission is enacted, of
the $29 </p>

<p> million appropriated for fiscal year 1995, DOJ plans to award
up to </p>

<p> 100 planning grants for not more than $35,000 each to
jurisdictions </p>

<p> interested in establishing drug courts, </p>

<p> 10 implementation grants for not more than $1 million each to
</p>

<p> jurisdictions that have identified their target populations
and </p>

<p> case processing procedures, </p>

<p> 3 additional implementation grants for not more than $2
million to </p>

<p> larger jurisdictions with populations exceeding 1 million,
and </p>

<p> 20 improvement and enhancement grants for not more than $1
million </p>

<p> to jurisdictions that have already established drug courts. </p>

<p> Federal grants for each drug court program will be 75 percent
of </p>

<p> program costs. The grantees will be required to provide cash
to fund </p>

<p> the remaining 25 percent. </p>

<p> Applications are due by May 23, 1995. Then, OJP and BJA
staffs will </p>

<p> focus on screening and processing qualified applications for </p>

<p> potential grant awards, pending final congressional action on
the </p>

<p> fiscal year 1995 budget rescission. If the current deadline
for </p>

<p> filing drug court applications does not change, the first
grants are </p>

<p> expected to be awarded in the summer of 1995. </p>

<p> EVALUATION REQUIREMENTS FOR </p>

<p> FEDERALLY FUNDED DRUG COURTS </p>

<p> -----------------------------------------------------------
Letter :28 </p>

<p> (See figure in printed </p>

<p> edition.) </p>

<p> Evaluating effectiveness is a critical element of the federal
drug </p>

<p> court program. The 1994 Crime Act authorizes the Attorney
General to </p>

<p> carry out or make arrangements for evaluations of programs
that </p>

<p> receive discretionary program grants. The act also mandates
us to </p>

<p> study and assess the effectiveness and impact of these
discretionary </p>

<p> grants and report to the Congress by January 1, 1997. </p>

<p> OJP program guidelines require recipients of drug court
grants to </p>

<p> cooperate with a national evaluation team. The evaluation
will be </p>

<p> aimed at measuring program impact primarily through the use
of the </p>

<p> following criteria: </p>

<p> reduction in recidivism rates of program participants, </p>

<p> maintenance of acceptable treatment completion rates, </p>

<p> decreased participant drug use, and </p>

<p> maintenance of a cost-effective program. </p>

<p> NIJ is responsible for overseeing the national evaluation.
The </p>

<p> evaluation will focus on treatment and its impact and is
expected to </p>

<p> take at least 2 years to complete. At the time of our review,
NIJ </p>

<p> was developing the solicitation for proposals to conduct the </p>

<p> evaluation. </p>

<p> Program guidelines also require each drug court grant
recipient to </p>

<p> conduct process evaluations of their programs. For these </p>

<p> evaluations, grantees are expected to collect descriptive
information </p>

<p> on the role of drug court players, potential eligible
population, and </p>

<p> participant program characteristics. Grantees will also be
asked to </p>

<p> collect information on program procedures used to identify
and screen </p>

<p> eligible offenders, accept and assess offenders, respond to
relapses, </p>

<p> manage and monitor cases, and discharge and refer
participants. </p>

<p> DRUG COURTS </p>

<p> =========================================================
Appendix III </p>

<p> EVALUATION 1: F.I.R.S.T. </p>

<p> OAKLAND </p>

<p> -------------------------------------------------------
Appendix III:1 </p>

<p> TREATMENT GROUP </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------- Appendix
III:1.0.1 </p>

<p> Drug use defendants granted admission to a diversion program.
</p>

<p> Admission requirements changed during the course of the
study. </p>

<p> STUDY DESIGN </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------- Appendix
III:1.0.2 </p>

<p> Comparison of 110 defendants in a program with a similar
group of 110 </p>

<p> defendants in a different program a year earlier. </p>

<p> TIME OF STUDY </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------- Appendix
III:1.0.3 </p>

<p> Drug court participants referred in January and February of
1991; </p>

<p> earlier group referred in January 1990 through March of 1990.
The </p>

<p> report contained a 3-year follow-up study. </p>

<p> KEY MEASURES </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------- Appendix
III:1.0.4 </p>

<p> (1)Felony rearrests: Drug court defendants had a lower
average rate </p>

<p> of felony rearrests per defendants (0.75) than had previous
divertees </p>

<p> (1.33). </p>

<p> (2)Days in custody for felony offenses: Drug court
defendants, on </p>

<p> average, spent fewer days in custody per defendant (44) than
had </p>

<p> previous divertees (78). </p>

<p> (3)Bench warrants: Drug court defendants, on average, had
fewer </p>

<p> bench warrants issued for failures to appear at court
hearings (0.67) </p>

<p> than had previous divertees (1.1). </p>

<p> ASSESSMENT </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------- Appendix
III:1.0.5 </p>

<p> There were some questions concerning the comparability of the
two </p>

<p> groups, as well as the eligibility requirements for the two
programs. </p>

<p> (The report stated that eligibility requirements were relaxed
for the </p>

<p> drug court program participants in order to obtain a broader
group </p>

<p> for comparative purposes.) In spite of these concerns, the
evaluation </p>

<p> suggested some fairly strong evidence of program success
after 3 </p>

<p> years. </p>

<p> EVALUATION 2: MARICOPA COUNTY </p>

<p> -------------------------------------------------------
Appendix III:2 </p>

<p> TREATMENT GROUP </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------- Appendix
III:2.0.1 </p>

<p> Offenders sentenced to probation for first-time drug
possession </p>

<p> convictions. </p>

<p> STUDY DESIGN </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------- Appendix
III:2.0.2 </p>

<p> Random assignment to four groups: </p>

<p> (1)No drug testing, frequent visits (n=approximately 154). </p>

<p> (2)Monthly random drug testing, occasional visits
(n=approximately </p>

<p> 154). </p>

<p> (3)Biweekly scheduled drug testing, limited visits
(n=approximately </p>

<p> 154). </p>

<p> (4)Drug court, with testing and treatment supervised by a
probation </p>

<p> officer (n=177). </p>

<p> TIME OF STUDY </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------- Appendix
III:2.0.3 </p>

<p> Participants in program between March 1992 and April 1993.
Current </p>

<p> data reported only preliminary findings after 6 months. </p>

<p> KEY MEASURES </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------- Appendix
III:2.0.4 </p>

<p> (1)Rearrest rates: No statistically significant differences
(16.95 </p>

<p> percent for the drug court group vs. 15.37 percent for
others). </p>

<p> (2)Rates of technical probation violations: Drug court group
had </p>

<p> lower rates than those of others (7.9 percent vs. 11.9
percent). </p>

<p> ASSESSMENT </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------- Appendix
III:2.0.5 </p>

<p> Although the evaluation design was quite strong, the results
were </p>

<p> preliminary; insufficient time had elapsed to provide a firm </p>

<p> indication of program effect. Future comparisons may be
complicated </p>

<p> by the fact that the drug court sample had lower rates of
reported </p>

<p> history of prior marijuana use. Otherwise, the control groups
</p>

<p> (groups 1-3) were quite similar to the drug court group
(group 4). </p>

<p> EVALUATION 3: DADE COUNTY </p>

<p> (GOLDKAMP AND WEILAND) </p>

<p> -------------------------------------------------------
Appendix III:3 </p>

<p> TREATMENT GROUP </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------- Appendix
III:3.0.1 </p>

<p> Persons arrested for 2nd and 3rd degree drug-related
felonies. </p>

<p> STUDY DESIGN </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------- Appendix
III:3.0.2 </p>

<p> Five key groups:\11 </p>

<p> (1)Persons admitted to drug court program (n=326). </p>

<p> (2)Sample of felony drug defendants in same period not
eligible </p>

<p> because of more serious drug-related offenses (n=199). </p>

<p> (3)Sample of nondrug felony defendants in same period
(n=185). </p>

<p> (4)Sample of felony drug defendants in period several years
earlier </p>

<p> (n=302). </p>

<p> (5)Sample of felony nondrug defendants in period several
years </p>

<p> earlier (n=536). </p>

<p> In addition, the evaluation compared persons completing the
drug </p>

<p> court program with those failing to complete. </p>

<p> -------------------- </p>

<p> \11 An additional sample of offenders could not reliably be
used as a </p>

<p> control group because they were exposed to the drug court
program. </p>

<p> TIME OF STUDY </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------- Appendix
III:3.0.3 </p>

<p> Participants in groups 1-3 had charges filed in August 1990
and </p>

<p> September 1990. Charges for groups 4-5 were filed in the
summer of </p>

<p> 1987. Data report results after 18 month follow-up. </p>

<p> KEY MEASURES </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------- Appendix
III:3.0.4 </p>

<p> (1)Rearrest rates: Drug court defendants were rearrested at a
</p>

<p> statistically significant lower rate (33 percent, vs. 40
percent to </p>

<p> 53 percent for other groups). </p>

<p> (2)Time before rearrest: Drug court defendants had
statistically </p>

<p> significant longer time before rearrest (median of 235 days,
vs. 52 </p>

<p> to 115 days for other groups). </p>

<p> (3)Rearrests and treatment completion: Rearrest rates were </p>

<p> associated with failure to complete the treatment program. </p>

<p> ASSESSMENT </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------- Appendix
III:3.0.5 </p>

<p> The results suggested an effect of the program. However, the
study </p>

<p> design was unable to make the comparison with offenders in
the same </p>

<p> situation with similarly serious drug offenses; therefore,
the </p>

<p> results must be interpreted cautiously. In particular, the
drug </p>

<p> court sample had fewer prior arrests than had the other
comparison </p>

<p> groups, and the key group of felony drug defendants used for </p>

<p> comparative purposes were not eligible for the drug court
program </p>

<p> because of the seriousness of their charges or prior records.
</p>

<p> The comparisons between those completing and failing to
complete the </p>

<p> program must also be viewed with caution, due to possible </p>

<p> motivational and other differences between the groups. </p>

<p> In commenting on a draft of this report, DOJ officials noted
that </p>

<p> this study had a strong design with carefully drawn
comparison </p>

<p> groups. We agree that the study's design was generally
strong. </p>

<p> However, as we state in this report, there were some
potentially </p>

<p> important differences in prior arrest rates between the
groups, and </p>

<p> the study was not able to compare similarly situated drug
defendants </p>

<p> in a roughly similar time period. Therefore, as we noted, the
</p>

<p> study's results should be interpreted cautiously. </p>

<p> EVALUATION 4: DADE COUNTY </p>

<p> (SMITH, DAVIS AND GORETSKY) </p>

<p> -------------------------------------------------------
Appendix III:4 </p>

<p> TREATMENT GROUP </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------- Appendix
III:4.0.1 </p>

<p> Defendants with no prior convictions charged with a drug
possession </p>

<p> offense, admitting to a drug problem for which they wanted
treatment. </p>

<p> STUDY DESIGN </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------- Appendix
III:4.0.2 </p>

<p> Comparison of 318 defendants assigned to the drug court with
a sample </p>

<p> of 99 narcotics cases in early 1988. In addition, a group of
drug </p>

<p> court defendants who were accepted into the drug court
program were </p>

<p> compared on rearrest rates. </p>

<p> TIME OF STUDY </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------- Appendix
III:4.0.3 </p>

<p> Participants were assigned to the drug court in January 1990
through </p>

<p> March 1990. The comparison group was charged between January
1988 </p>

<p> and March 1988. </p>

<p> KEY MEASURES </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------- Appendix
III:4.0.4 </p>

<p> (1)Rearrest rates: There was no statistically significant
difference </p>

<p> in the rate of felony rearrests after 1 year between those
assigned </p>

<p> to drug court (32 percent) and the comparison group of
defendants </p>

<p> charged 2 years earlier (33 percent). Those defendants
accepted by </p>

<p> the drug court did have lower rates of rearrest (15 percent),
but the </p>

<p> authors noted that these individuals constituted &quot;a
highly select </p>

<p> group . . . least disposed to commit new crimes.&quot; The
rearrest </p>

<p> results in this evaluation differed from those in the other </p>

<p> evaluation of Dade County (evaluation 3). </p>

<p> (2)Sentencing dispositions: There were statistically
significant </p>

<p> differences in dispositions between those assigned to drug
court and </p>

<p> the comparison group of earlier defendants. Those assigned to
drug </p>

<p> court were more likely not to face further prosecution and
less </p>

<p> likely to serve probation or short jail terms. </p>

<p> ASSESSMENT </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------- Appendix
III:4.0.5 </p>

<p> There were concerns about the comparability of the
participants in </p>

<p> the various groups. In particular, the finding of lower
rearrest </p>

<p> rates for program participants should be viewed cautiously in
light </p>

<p> of the selectivity of admission to the program. As a result,
there </p>

<p> were strong reservations about the results reported. </p>

<p> DOJ officials, in commenting on a draft of this report,
indicated </p>

<p> that this study had several flaws. They pointed out that the
study </p>

<p> was done when this drug court was less than 10 months old.
They </p>

<p> further noted that information on successful drug court
participants </p>

<p> was not available for evaluation because the participants'
records </p>

<p> were sealed. We concur with these comments. </p>

<p> Rearrests: Persons remaining in the program committed
felonies at a </p>

<p> slightly lower rate than did those leaving the program (7.7
percent </p>

<p> vs. 12.0 percent). (Cases dismissed were not included in
these </p>

<p> comparisons.) No differences occurred in comparing the
proportions </p>

<p> having committed misdemeanors (4.1 percent for persons
remaining in </p>

<p> the program vs. 5.0 percent for those leaving the program). </p>

<p> ASSESSMENT </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------- Appendix

1994. </p>

<p> KEY MEASURES </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------- Appendix
III:6.0.4 </p>

<p> Graduates had lower rates of bench warrants for failure to
appear, </p>

<p> went slightly longer before the first bench warrant was
issued, and </p>
