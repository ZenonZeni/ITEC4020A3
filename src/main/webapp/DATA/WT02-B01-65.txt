Strategies </p>

<p> <b>by Clifford A. Schaffer</b> </p>

<p> This is a first crack at the kinds of political strategies we
must use to end the drug war. </p>

<p> <img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="BOTTOM"> </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="BOTTOM">We must
win by knockout. </h2>

<p> I believe that we must pick issues where we can by knockout.
The odds are so stacked against us that, unless we win by
knockout, we will not win at all. </p>

<p> While I agree with the economics and civil liberties
arguments for decriminalization, I do not favor the use of these
issues as a primary focus. The primary reason that I do not like
the arguments on economics or civil liberties is because they are
highly intellectual arguments which could be debated all day with
no clear resolution. They make people think too much, and that
slows down decision-making. We want issues which will change
people's minds forever -- and do it today. I believe that these
arguments may be useful to convince other people like us, but it
will not convince large masses of Americans. </p>

<p> There are two primary issues where I believe we can win by
knockout right now. They are the treatment of medical patients,
and the issue of African-American men. In both cases we have
clear, overwhelming arguments which would get the immediate
agreement of large masses of Americans. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="BOTTOM">We must
build a coalition of constituencies. </h2>

<p> We must bring people of different persuasions together to
support our cause. In our Resolution, we have already chosen a
broadly based statement which does not use the &quot;D&quot; word
and which could be supported by people of all persuasions. That
is step one. </p>

<p> Next we, need to formally identify our constituencies and the
specific arguments which will be most relevant to those groups. </p>

<p> Some constituencies are: </p>

<p> Doctors - The relevant issues here are the persecution of
doctors and the treatment of medical patients. </p>

<p> Medical Patient Groups - The relevant issue is the treatment
of medical patients. </p>

<p> African-Americans - The relevant issue is the incarceration
and economic destruction of African-American men. </p>

<p> I believe that doctors and African-Americans are absolutely
vital to our success and that every one of us should take
immediate steps to recruit them to our cause. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="BOTTOM">We must
form &quot;intervention groups&quot; and target specific
individuals that we need on our side. </h2>

<p> We have used an approach which someone likened to an Alcohols
Anonymous intervention group. We assembled a group of people that
we knew an important person would find persuasive. Then we all
went together to that person and explained our concerns in terms
that were important to that person. Then we asked for support,
not for the &quot;D&quot; word, but for general drug policy
reform. </p>

<p> This technique is highly effective and will enable us to
change the thinking of many important people, or at least start
them down the slippery slope to the &quot;D&quot; word. I believe
that we should all commit to participating in at least one of
these intervention groups to change the mind of at least one
important person. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="BOTTOM">We must
seek action. </h2>

<p> We have already asked for public hearings. As many of you
have already stated, public hearings may not come about and, even
if they do, they may not change anything. Therefore, we must seek
other means which will also bring about clear public
confrontations on the issue. When those confrontations occur, we
must all respond unanimously. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="BOTTOM">We must
provide support for people who speak out for drug policy reform. </h2>

<p> We all know that many people are reluctant to speak out for
reform because of the McCarthy-like tactics of our opposition. We
must come to the defense of anyone who is criticized or vilified
because of their support for a change in drug policy. Point out
that people are not vilified because they are Republican,
Democrat, or Libertarian, but people are vilified if they even
want to discuss a different drug policy. This is McCarthyism. <br>
