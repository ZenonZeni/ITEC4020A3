Newsletter Profile</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+3>Andrew Hill</FONT></P>

<P>A Church Minister on the VESS Committee? Yes, it's true. &quot;My congregation
would expect me to take a fairly liberal view on moral issues,&quot; says
Reverend Andrew Hill. In his 22 years as minister at St Marks Unitarian
Church in Edinburgh, he can't recall strong opposition to his views on
euthanasia, many of which were shared by his early role models while studying
for the ministry. Andrew is a 5th generation Unitarian minister - following
in the footsteps of his family to his great grandfather. He is no born-again
v.e. supporter - rather his views have become pragmatic over the years
as he looks for ways to further the responsible moral environment that
made such an impression on him in his formative years. &quot;I've not so
much changed my position as changed the way it's expressed.&quot;</P>

<P>Graduating with a Degree in Theology at Manchester, he recently spent
six years compiling the Unitarian manual on births, deaths and unions.
Not missing out on the latest technology, he is has been using the Internet
to begin looking at the possibility of an inter-faith group for assisted
suicide. He describes the religious right as &quot;possibly the most intolerant
organised body of opinion that exists.&quot; In America, church attendance
is very high, but does it build a better nation? Andrew thinks not. He
is put off by the refusal of the anti-euthanasia groups to consider opposing
arguments. When the founder of VESS, Sheila Little, died, he conducted
her (Humanist) funeral. &quot;For the Christian, people come before principles
any day,&quot; he wrote in VESS Newsletter back in 1982. Later, as a VESS
member, he says that later years on the Executive Committee gave him a
greater knowledge of the problems. Just three years after his latest sermon
on euthanasia, he is planning another - this time on assisted suicide and
in the light of the new research from Glasgow University.</P>

<P>How does he feel about the current campaign? &quot;I prefer the Dutch
model to the one recently tried in Australia. We constantly talk of 'autonomy',
but no-one lives in isolation in this world. In the Netherlands, everyone
is involved - the family are consulted and the doctor must know the patient
well; in Northern Territory, an unknown foreigner can apply for euthanasia.&quot;</P>
