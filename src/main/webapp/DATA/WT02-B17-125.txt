<p>  
    Despite the fact that technical and societal factors stand in the way 
of 
    hydrogen becoming a fuel for the masses, a new analysis conducted by 

    Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) suggests that there are 

    viable scenarios for making the transition to high-mileage electric 
    vehicles powered by a combination of batteries and hydrogen-fueled 
power 
    systems.
<p>     
    In the report, "Hydrogen as a Transportation Fuel: Costs and 
Benefits," 
    analysts look at hydrogen's economic viability for powering a 
five-passenger 
    vehicle such as a Ford Taurus with a range of about 80 miles per 
gallon.  
    LLNL concluded that over time there are compelling reasons to try to 
shift 
    away from conventional gasoline-fueled vehicles.
<p>     
    For example, with a sizable fleet of alternative vehicles operating 
in the 
    United States by 2030, oil imports could be cut by two billion 
barrels per 
    year, saving $1.2 trillion at $30 per barrel of oil.  But such 
savings 
    cannot be achieved overnight, LLNL warned.
<p>     
    "The most striking point about oil-use reductions and 
alternative-fuel 
    vehicles is the very long lead times necessary for large-scale 
change.  
    Alternative-fuel cars introduced in 2005 do not begin to materially 
    influence aggregate oil use for another decade, and two decades more 
(2035) 
    are required to replace gasoline vehicles," the report says.
<p>     
    "We have shown that you could put hydrogen-fueled vehicle on the road 
in the 
    near term," said Robert Schock, associate director for energy at 
LLNL.  "It 
    does not have to be as far off as people have supposed."
<p>     
    Schock added that policymakers have erred in the past by focusing on 
the 
    total costs of a hydrogen-fueled auto economy and the associated 
    infrastructure requirements.  "What DOE needed to do is to look at 
the 
    transition phase and ask, How do you get there?"
<p>     
    The study points out that hybrid-electric vehicles (HEVs) can fill 
the niche 
    for hydrogen vehicles without awaiting the development of 
cost-effective 
    fuel cells.  "HEVs coupled with small-scale hydrogen production 
and/or 
    storage are among the most promising systems," the LLNL report says.
