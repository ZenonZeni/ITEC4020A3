<h2>SPRI Library personnel: who we are and what we do</h2>

<p>

<h4>Librarian and Information Officer: <a href="../people/wjm13/home.htm">
William J. Mills</a></h4> 

In addition to having overall responsibility for running the Institute's Library and Information 
Service, William acquires and processes all publications relating to the 
North American Arctic.  This includes all Alaska (except the Panhandle); the Canadian 
Territories (Yukon and Northwest); and those parts of Quebec and Labrador occupied by 
the Inuit.<p>

<h3>Library Office:</h3>

<h4>Information Assistant: Shirley Sawtell</h4>

Shirley has prime responsibility for reader services and is the initial point of contact for 
all enquiries.  She also supervises the running of the Library Office.  Shirley is the best 
person to contact if you want to send an e-mail to the Library.  To do so, click here:
<a href=mailto:ss119@cus.cam.ac.uk>ss119@cus.cam.ac.uk</a>.<p>

<h4>Librarian's Secretary / Archivist's Assistant: Philippa Hogg</h4>

As you can see, Philippa has two jobs.  As Archivist's Assistant, she is the first point of 
contact for the Archives.  Whilst no special arrangements are necessary to use the Library,  
the Archives may only be consulted by appointment.  To arrange an appointment, send an 
e-mail to Philippa by clicking here: <a href=mailto:pmeh2@cus.cam.ac.uk>
pmeh2@cus.cam.ac.uk</a>.<p>

<h4>Library Assistant: Sharon Banks</h4>

Without Sharon no books would get shelved, no articles photocopied and many questions 
not answered, since Sharon deals with these when neither Shirley nor Philippa are
available.  Sharon also maintains the files recording new periodicals and is responsible for
listing new accessions on the database.

<h3>Bibliographers:</h3>

<h4>Antarctic Bibliographer: Hilary Shibata</h4>

Hilary is responsible for acquiring and processing publications relating to Antarctica and 
its surrounding waters and islands. To send an e-mail to Hilary, click here:

<h4>Nordic Bibliographer: Jonathan Pinhey</h4>

Jonathan is responsible for acquiring and processing publications relating to Greenland, 
Iceland (natural history only), Svalbard and the European Arctic south to the Arctic Circle.  
He also processes all materials published in the Nordic languages. To send an e-mail to 
Jonathan, click here: <a href=mailto:jlgp101@cus.cam.ac.uk>jlgp101@cus.cam.ac.uk</a>.

<h4>Russian Bibliographer: Isabella M.T. Warren</h4>

Isabella is responsible for acquiring and processing publications relating to the Russian 
Federation south to 63 deg. in European Russia and to 57 deg. in Asia, including all of 
Kamchatka and Sakhalin.  She also processes all Russian-language material. To send an
