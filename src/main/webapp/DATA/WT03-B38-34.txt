SHORT TAKES ON HIGH YIELDS

Rickel Home Centers filed with the U.S Bankruptcy Court in
Delaware to restructure its outstanding 13.5% senior notes through a
Chapter 11 proceeding. The proposal called for the exchange of its $126.5
million in outstanding senior notes due 2001 for $63.25 million in new
13.5% notes, roughly 84% of the reorganized company's common stock and cash
equaling approximately 7% of the original notes' principal balance. Over
two-thirds of the noteholders had agreed to the swap, company officials
said.
     The plan, which also provided for the payment of vendors
and other unsecured creditors, must now receive the approval of the
company's creditor committee and the bankruptcy court`

     Moody's Investor Service placed Spreckels Industries'
senior secured notes under review for possible upgrade. Any ratings change
would affect $70 million in 11.5% securities due 2002 which currently carry
B2 ratings. The issuer recently announced the imminent sale of its
unprofitable sugar unit to Imperial Holly for $24 million and will
concentrate on its material handling equipment business, Moody's said. The
notes were rated B+/developing by S&P.
     Separately, Spreckels rejected an unsolicited acquisition
offer from American Enterprise LLC`

     Trump Hotels & Casino Resorts Inc. will augment its real
estate portfolio with the acquisition of the Taj Mahal casino from Taj
Mahal Holding Corp. The purchase will result in the retirement of $726.4
million in outstanding Trump Taj Mahal 11.35% first mortgage bonds due in
1999 at par plus accrued interest. Bondholders will also be able to redeem
780,242 shares of Class B common stock at $0.50 per share. A debt offering
of up to $750 million would generate the funds necessary for the merger and
retirement of outstanding debt, the company said.
     In addition to the Taj Mahal casino, Trump Hotels & Casino
Resorts operates the Trump Plaza Hotel in New York and the Trump Indiana
riverboat, which is scheduled to open in Michigan in April. Trump Castle
stands as the last remaining Trump property outstanding and is widely
expected to be folded into the public company in the near future.
     Despite the combination of the various facilities within a
single corporate structure, several market players expected the fortunes of
the underlying properties would continue to drive credit perceptions.
"Investors will continue to look through to the fundamentals of each
subsidiary, so they'll still trade like separate non-recourse entities,"
said John Barnes, assistant vice president at Prudential Securities`

     Standard & Poor's withdrew Maxtor Corp.'s B corporate
rating and CCC+ rating of the company's $100 million in outstanding
subordinated debt. The moves resulted from Maxtor's ongoing discussions
with unrated Hyundai Electronics of America concerning the purchase of all
of Maxtor's outstanding stock, the rating agency said`

     The U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Eastern District of Louisiana
approved the sale of Crescent City Capital Development Corp. to Mirage
Resorts. Parent company Capital Gaming International, Inc. sold its
bankrupt Louisiana subsidiary to the Mirage for $55 million plus the
assumption of $6.5 million in equipment debt`

     Moody's also assigned a B3 rating to Alvey Systems Inc.'s
first public issue. Due in 2002, the $100 million in senior subordinated
notes will be used to fund a buyout/acquisition of the company by a portion
of its current management. The notes will be subordinated to a $30 million
secured bank facility and future senior debt`

     Primeco Inc. reached an agreement to purchase fellow
equipment rental and sales company Vibroplant U.S. for approximately $67.5
million. The transaction will be funded by Primeco's credit facility as
well as an additional $10 million equity investment from shareholders
including Investcorp S.A. Primeco currently has $100 million in senior debt
outstanding carrying BB- ratings from S&P`

     Benton Oil and Gas Co. agreed to sell the bulk of its
domestic properties to Shell Offshore Inc. The Shell Oil Co. subsidiary
will purchase the stock of Benton's wholly-owned subsidiary Benton Oil and
Gas Company of Louisiana for $35.4 million.
     Benton will devote the subsequent pre-tax gain of roughly
$10 million to the development of its Venezuelan operations and de-
leveraging roughly $10 million in debt, according to company officials. The
transaction was expected to close before the end of the first quarter.

JOHN HANCOCK CONSTRUCTIVE DESPITE CREDIT CONCERNS

Flush with cash from retail investors, John Hancock
Advisers has accelerated its high yield purchasing while jockeying to guard
against declining credit fundamentals.
     Indeed, the Boston-based mutual fund has kept pace with
increased cash inflows even as senior vice president Fred Cavanaugh has
scaled back high yield holdings as a percentage of the firm's Strategic
Income Fund.
     "The technicals are in fantastic shape," said Cavanaugh,
who manages the Strategic Income fund and oversees all of John Hancock's
junk purchases. "There's a lot of interest [in high yield bonds] from
cross-over buyers from the high-quality corporate sector and we've seen a
tremendous amount of interest from retail investors."
     Faced with looming credit concerns, however, Cavanaugh has
reduced the diversified portfolio's high yield allocation to roughly 40%
from the "high to mid-40's" a year ago. Beyond some $200 million in
domestic high yield securities, the Strategic Income fund also contains
international debt, governments and preferred stock.
     John Hancock holds nearly $1 billion in high yield bonds
among its Strategic Income, High Yield and High-Grade Bond funds, the
latter of which currently holds some 15%-20% in junk bonds. All told, the
firm manages pver $16 billion in assets for retail  and private investors.
Bullish Near Term
     Despite rising default rates and the reduction of exposure
levels, John Hancock's expectations for the coming year in the high yield
market aren't especially dire. Cavanaugh remains "constructive" on credit
fundamentals for the first half of 1996 and is "more cautiously optimistic"
regarding the latter portion of the year.
     "We should see sufficient economic activity to support cash
flows, even in the cyclicals" during the first portion of the year,
Cavanaugh said.
     This view has been bolstered by the recent price increases
posted by several steel and paper issuers. "A little bit of inflation can
be good" because it indicates healthy demand and bolsters short-term
profitability, Cavanaugh said.
     Away from cyclical issues, Cavanaugh looked for each sector
of the telecommunications market including cable and paging to continue
posting strong performances as their product offerings and user markets
steadily mature.
     Despite this generally positive outlook, Cavanaugh has
taken several moderate steps to reduce credit risk by shortening high yield
maturities and turning to higher coupons.
Reining In Credit Risk
     "Higher coupons tend to temper the pricing change needed to
get a particular yield," Cavanaugh said. "But if you run into a distress
situation, [the security] will begin trading strictly on a price basis, so
it offers little or no protection" in a default scenario.
     Otherwise, the firm has gravitated toward the stronger
names and more senior paper in the cyclical sectors. Hancock hasn't pushed
credit quality above the single-B level since cross-over buying has
inflated double-B pricing and driven down yields, Cavanaugh said.
     Hancock has also rotated into overseas debt, which has
risen from roughly 30% to 40% of the Strategic Income fund. International
purchases have included some sovereign issues from Western Europe and high
yield corporates such as the UK cable offerings.
     "It's in a growth stage comparable to where we were eight
or nine years ago, and there are some fairly well-heeled investors
involved," Cavanaugh said of the set of UK cable deals.
     Meanwhile, Cavanaugh has avoided the retailing and
restaurant sectors of the domestic high yield market, where he predicted a
difficult operating environment going forward.
     "I would want to see the fourth quarter numbers,
particularly for the retailers, before I'd change my view," Cavanaugh said.
"I'm not expecting robust results out of any of them, so it could be a
sector to avoid this year."

PUERTO RICAN BANK TAPS MARKET VIA 144A OFFERING

After eyeing the market throughout 1995, FirstBank of
Puerto Rico became the second bank from the island to issue subordinated
debt last December.
     The state-chartered commercial bank completed a $100
million offering of 10-year subordinated notes with a coupon of 7.625% at
99.277 to yield 7.730%, or 200 basis points over Treasuries.
     The bank's first independent bond offering carried a split
rating of BB+/Baa3 and was packaged as a Rule 144A transaction, enabling a
public-style execution of the offering without SEC registration.
     Lead Jefferies & Co. teamed with co-manager Smith Barney to
place the deal with roughly 15 insurance companies.
     The transaction closely followed the initial subordinate
offering from fellow Puerto Rican bank BanPonce Corp., which placed $125
million in BBB/Baa2 securities through lead CS First Boston. o

KCS Cues 144A Deal
     KCS Energy Inc. began marketing a $150 million Rule 144A
transaction through lead Smith Barney with pricing expected late this week.
     Rated B1 by Moody's Investor Service, the senior notes will
carry a four-year non-call period with a seven-year maturity and a $35
million equity carve-out, sources said. Pricing information was
unavailable.
     The rating reflects KCS' long-standing gas contract

litigation with the Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company, Moody's said. Moreover,
the above-market contract had contributed to the KCS' steady growth in
earnings, the rating agency added.
     KCS will use roughly $120 million of the proceeds to repay
outstanding debt and an additional $25 million to repay a bridge loan from
Nomura Securities, sources said. Bqsed in Edison, N.J., KCS explores for,
develops, markets, and transports natural gas and crude oil.

CHEMICAL RAISES $2.2 BILLION FOR RIVERWOOD PURCHASE

Chemical Securities has arranged a $2.2 billion financing
for the purchase of Riverwood International by a group of investors led by
leveraged buyout firm Clayton, Dubilier & Rice (CDR).
     The funds will be raised through the issuance of $650
million of debt and $1.55 billion in bank loans slated for the syndicated
market, sources said. Officials at both Riverwood and CDR couldn't be
reached by press time while Chemical declined comment.
     Currently a subsidiary of 81% shareholder Manville Corp.,
Atlanta-based Riverwood is involved in the packaging and manufacture of
packaging equipment for the beverage industry. The transaction was
originally announced in October and is expected to close by the end of the
first quarter, Manville officials said.

UPGRADE RATIOS IMPROVE, BUOYING '96 CREDIT OUTLOOK

The ratio of high yield rating upgrades relative to
downgrades improved during 1995, suggesting that credit deterioration
should remain relatively muted during the coming year.
     Standard & Poor's lowered its marks for 126 domestic
speculative grade issues totaling $93.8 billion and upgraded 142 series
worth $108.5 billion during 1995. Moody's Investor Service, meanwhile,
downgraded 123 speculative grade securities equaling $25.3 billion while
granting higher marks to 100 issues of $37.26 billion.
     The figures compared favorably with those seen at the end
of the last economic expansion and should bode well for delinquency rates
during 1996, several analysts said.
     "Further deterioration seems likely. However, the magnitude
of the losses should fall well short of the numbers seen in 1989 and 1990,"
said Moody's senior economist John Lonski. During that period, downgrades
more than doubled upgrades in dollar terms, Lonski said.
     S&P's 1995 results reversed the previous year's totals, in
which downgrades outpaced upgrades in terms of both number and dollar
volumes. Although the number of Moody's downgrades exceeded upgrades in
1995, the ratio of upgrades relative to downgrades improved on a dollar
basis and reached its highest level in 12 years. (See table, page 3.)
     "If it weren't for the retailers and the manufacturers of
non-durable consumer goods, we would have had many more upgrades than
downgrades" in 1995, Lonski said. Indeed, Moody's downgraded 70 such issues
totaling $23.6 billion while uprgrading 24 issues worth $16.4 billion last
year.
     Moreover, the dollar amount of fallen angels dropped to
$9.83 billion from $12.9 billion even though the number of issues increased
to 12 from a record-low nine in 1994, according to Moody's. The rating
agency promoted 24 issues totaling $10.8 billion from speculative to
investment grade, compared to 17 issues representing $10.8 billion in 1994.
     These high yield numbers coincided with an overall
improvement of corporate credit quality during 1995, according to S&P.
Overall, the rating agency upgraded $210 billion in industrial debt and
downgraded $118 billion. Upgrades were concentrated in automotive,
chemical, health care and high tech industries while media and
entertainment, consumer products and retailers bore the brunt of the rating
reductions.

Gradual Credit Decline?
     Despite these encouraging numbers, both agencies registered
a higher number of speculative grade downgrades for the third straight
year. Moreover, the dollar amount of S&P high yield downgrades climbed for
the fourth time since 1991.
     While these trends have more recently coincided with higher
default rates, most observers linked the increased downgrade activity to
the issuance of smaller parcels of riskier debt.
     "You have had a significant increase in single-B debt, so
that would contribute to the higher numbers," said Diane Vazza, director of
fixed-income research at S&P. Vazza added that the abundance of first-time
issuers over the past several years also contributed to the accelerated
downgrade activity.

MARKET SURVIVES TOUGH WEEK;  GROWING CALENDAR NEXT OBSTACLE

The high yield market survived yet another week largely
unscathed despite the fact that the long bond jumped from 6.04% to 6.15%
and the Dow skidded by over 100 points by Thursday's close.
     Replete with fresh insurance allocations and new inflows
from mutual fund buyers, the high yield sector welcomed its first issuance
of the year and once again weathered downturns in other capital markets and
the continuing budget standoff.
     "Most people have a lot of money to put to work right now,
so they're buying yield first and credit second," one high yield trader
said. Indeed, several dealers reportedly lightened their positions in
anticipation of rougher market conditions later month.
     Following light trading earlier in the week due to the
blizzard conditions along the entire East Coast, secondary volumes reached
moderate levels by mid-week. Aggregate high yield prices lost roughly a
quarter point on Wednesday as the 30-year bond widened to yield 6.19%
before tightening on Thursday following a slight comeback by both the stock
and Treasury markets to finish essentially unchanged for the week.
     Typical January favorites casinos and steel continued to
lead the gainers, although several market players questioned the latter
trend given recent declines in auto sales. "People bulled up [on steel]
with the price increases, but the demand for autos will determine whether
that sticks or not," one trader said.

Issuance Resumes
     The continued strength of the high yield sector relative to
other markets could be short-lived with upwards of $5 billion in issuance
expected during the coming weeks.
     Merrill Lynch priced the first deal of the year, launching
$125 million for Young Broadcasting with co-manager JP Morgan. Originally
sized at $100 million, the offering bore a 9% variable-price coupon and
comes due in January 2006.
     Further issuance failed to materialize, although deal flow
was expected to begin in earnest this week with 21 road shows totaling over
$5.2 billion reportedly underway or scheduled before the end of the month.
     "That's a lot of issuance for this market to get through,
so I wouldn't be surprised to see a correction," one high yield trader
said. "The second half of this month should be a lot tougher than the
first."
     Heavy deal flow could stretch into February and even March,
several market players said, as issuers rush to lock in the cheaper funding
afforded by low rates.
     Moreover, the rumored closing of the SEC due to the budget
impasse could spur issuers to crowd the market during the next six weeks,
several traders added.

Deals, Deals, Deals
     Salomon Brothers will burst from the blocks with a full
slate including $100 million from APS, $450 million from MFS
Communications, an $800 million multi-tranche offering from Sprint Cellular
and a $175 million transaction from Miami-based Telemundo, several sources
said.
     Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette should also post a big January
with a jumbo $1.1 billion, six-tranche offering from El Paso Electric Co.
The Texas utility will issue five series of BB-/Ba3 first mortgage bonds
and a sixth level of preferred stock to finance its reorganization
following bankruptcy, sources said. DLJ will also reportedly lead $120
million in nine-year senior subordinates from Doane Products with a five-
year non-call period.
     Merrill Lynch was expected to return with a $150 million
offering from Rogers  Communications that was originally slated for last
week but pushed back to Friday or early this week by the blizzard.
     Otherwise, the underwriter also reportedly held the books for
three Rule 144A offerings: a $115 million deal from steel producer Bar
Technology, a $200 million offering for Hollinger Publishing and $75
million from BE Aerospace.
     Hotel issuers expected before the end of the month included
Prime Hospitality with $120 million through Smith Barney, a $127 million
deal from Courtyard Marriott via Lehman Brothers and a $165 million
offering from Coast Hotel & Casino lead by Bear Stearns.
     Smith Barney also held the reins on a $100 million offering
from financial company First Nationwide, sources said.
     The issuance calendar will apparently be rounded out with a
$100 million offering from Chancellors via Bankers Trust, a $120 million
deal from Dynacare through Citicorp, $150 million from InterCel through
Morgan Stanley and $650 million in Riverwood International debt led by
Chemical Securities. (See related article, page 3.). Viking Star subsidiary
Teekay Shipping Corp. was also in line with $225 million in shipping
mortgage bonds through Goldman Sachs.
