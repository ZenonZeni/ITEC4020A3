Closed-End Fund Rights Offerings and What They Mean for Shareholders  </H2><P>
<HR>

Most investors are familiar with open-end mutual funds, whose shares are continuously issued and whose shareholders can sell shares back to the fund at net asset value, the per share market value of the securities the fund holds.<P>


Closed-end fund shares, on the other hand, are not continuously issued, and shareholders cannot sell their shares back to the fund at net asset value. Instead, after a fund goes public, closed-end fund shares are traded in the secondary markets in the same way that shares in corporations are traded.<P>


Recently, rights offerings have been used by quite a few managers to issue new shares and increase the pool of money they can use for investing. Rights are given to current record date shareholders, allowing them to buy a given number of shares at a specified price and maintain their proportional ownership in the issuing company.<P>


For example, a closed-end fund may want to raise capital by increasing the number of shares outstanding by 50%. It could do so by issuing rights to current shareholders as of the record date; these shareholders can exercise these rights and purchase, for instance, 50 shares of stock from the company for each 100 shares they own.<P>


These rights allow the purchase of shares at a price (the subscription price) that is announced by the fund near the exercise date, and which is usually at a discount from the current market price. The rights are short-term and can be exercised at any time before the expiration date. The rights can be exercised by shareholders of record as of the record date, after which the shares go ex-rights (that is, shares purchased after this date have no rights attached to them).<P>


Because rights allow the purchase of shares at a discount to market, they have value and are often traded in the market during the subscription period. However, in some cases the rights are non-transferable and only the shareholder can exercise them. If a shareholder sells his rights or chooses not to exercise the rights, his proportional ownership in the fund declines, since there will be more outstanding shares than before, yet his own position is unchanged.<P>


Why would a closed-end fund's management want to initiate a rights offering? A few of the reasons might be:<P>

<UL>
<LI>The increase in assets under management potentially results in economies of scale that lower the firm's expense ratio. 


<LI>New attractive investment opportunities can be pursued without having to liquidate current holdings that have good prospects.


<LI>They efficiently allow the targeting of existing shareholders for the distribution of shares.
</UL>

From a shareholder's view, investors purchasing shares before a stock goes ex-rights receive rights allowing them to purchase additional stock before the rights' expiration date at an attractive price.<P>


There is really no difference in value between selling the rights or exercising them. The difference lies in the investor's ending investment position in the fund: If he exercises the shares, he must put up more capital, so he has more of his own assets invested in the fund, and his proportional interest in the fund is maintained; if he sells the rights, his proportional interest in the fund declines, his own commitment declines (due to the decline in net asset value), but he receives cash for the rights. The table at the end of this article illustrates these two situations and compares their results.<P>


Tax law provides that shareholders do not recognize taxable income on the distribution of rights. However, what the shareholder does with these rights can have income tax consequences.<P>


While an investor who exercises rights recognizes no income tax gain or loss, the investor who sells rights recognizes a capital gain or loss on the difference between sales proceeds and basis. This is long-term capital gain or loss if the rights have been held for more than a year at the time of the sale (a short-term gain otherwise). On the other hand, an investor who allows rights to expire recognizes a short-term capital loss equal to the basis of the rights.<P>


This basis of distributed rights is generally zero. However, tax law requires allocation of a portion of the basis of initially held fund shares to the rights when either:<P>

<UL>
<LI>The rights' fair market value on the distribution date equals at least 15% of the fair market value of the fund shares entitling the shareholder to right distribution, or


<LI>The shareholder elects to allocate basis between the two in the year of distribution.
</UL>

In this case, the holding period of initially held shares attaches to rights obtained by the shareholder. Purchased rights, on the other hand, have a basis equal to cost and a holding period that commences on the rights' purchase date. Alternatively, an investor who exercises his rights recognizes no gain or loss. New shares acquired have a basis equal to the sum of the shareholder's basis in the exercised right and any subscription price and a holding period that begins on the exercise date.<P>


Faced with a closed-end fund rights offering, investors owning shares in the fund that are held in street name at a brokerage house can simply instruct the broker to exercise the rights and complete the required paperwork. Usually, no commission is charged and the account is debited in the same manner as a regular purchase. However, an investor holding the certificates must complete the necessary subscription forms and send share payments to the subscription agent.<P>


Sometimes, shareholders don't exercise all of their rights. In this case, an over-subscription privilege allows the associated shares to be offered to shareholders who have exercised all rights initially issued to them. Exercising shareholders wishing to acquire additional shares may indicate the number of desired additional shares on the subscription certificate. All over-subscriptions are fully honored if sufficient shares exist. If sufficient shares are not available, the excess shares are prorated to over-subscribers as follows: <P>

<PRE>
           Holder's Position                Remaining
---------------------------------------  x  Excess
Total Position for All Over-Subscribers     Shares

</PRE>

Closed-end fund rights offerings offer new and unique opportunities to both management and shareholders in closed-end funds. From an economic standpoint, there is no difference between selling the rights or exercising them--the value to the investor is equivalent; the decision boils down to one of preference, and whether the investor wants to commit more cash to the investment. <P>


The only wrong decision would be to ignore the offering, neither selling the rights nor exercising them.<P>
