<H3><A NAME="overview">OVERVIEW</A>:</h3>

This survey and research report arose as an endeavour to help articulate the concerns of many in our community about the less acceptable aspects of modern policing. It attempts to raise some very difficult issues which confront our community. The challenge is not to take these as a personal affront but to constructively work towards the means by which dialogue and consultation will enhance justice and democracy. <P>
Policing is political, not so much in the sense of being connected to formal politics and political parties, nor as being instruments of a particular political group. Rather, it is in the way that policing involves choices, choices that range from those made at the broader policy level, through to choices made by an individual police officer &quot;on the beat&quot; meeting a member of the public. Such choices do not occur in a vacuum, but are shaped by a myriad of factors, such as police officers backgrounds, police training, police occupational culture, the legal framework the police operate under and so on (Finnane 1990:219-20). <P>
There is little doubt that the police themselves would readily recognise their role in the broader political process. We have become very much accustomed to the statements (often outbursts) from the Police Association. <P>
It is worth noting that the recent Inquiry into policing in Queensland (the Fitzgerald Inquiry) commented that the Queensland Police Association is for all intensive purposes a union, and that the union had an important role in supporting and promoting the police occupational culture and code of conduct. The union was an influential source of &quot;opposition to any significant reform&quot; (see Fitzgerald Ch.VII). The behaviour and actions of the Victorian Police Association in recent years suggests that Fitzgerald's comments might, unfortunately, apply with equal force in Victoria. <P>
We have also had to listen to and read the comments of previous senior police now in retirement. Lest we see this as merely &quot;blasts from the past&quot;, that we also have a constant commentary on all types of issues, such as crime, road safety, (im)morality, and sentencing, from contemporary police administrations. <P>
In making their political comments police are often attempting to focus what it is that we are to discuss and how it will be discussed. For instance, the police are quite happy to accept that there are some &quot;rotten apples&quot;, (police personnel who bring disrepute to the Police Force), and that such &quot;rotten apples&quot; should be exorcised before the rot spreads. Even they realise that to deny some level of misbehaviour would be futile. The courts have found cases against the police before and since the very introduction of the &quot;modern police&quot; in the nineteenth century. The courts continue to convict police of all types of corruption, misbehaviour and violence. Royal Commissions have also heavily criticised police practices (albeit that Royal Commissions rarely produce convictions). The recent &quot;Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody&quot; (RCIADC) had much to say about policing. <P>
By promoting the idea that there are a few &quot;rotten apples&quot; that the police themselves have identified and cut from their ranks, the police are also concerned to show that they are best able to deal with the few recalcitrant police officers that have somehow managed to exist. Linked to this ethos of &quot;self management&quot;, the police regard &quot;outside&quot; criticism as being from vested interests that do not represent the real views of the community, and that these people are trying to place such unreasonable demands on the police (so they say) that they will no longer be able to effectively perform their duties. <P>
While it might be true that the crude number of police involved in &quot;misbehaviour&quot; is only a percentage of the total number, the way in which this misbehaviour is explained is vital to developing a means of effectively dealing with police mistreatment of people. The report that follows is an attempt to understand the features of police mistreatment in Victoria in the 1990's. <P>
Before examining our analysis of specific cases of mistreatment it must be recognised that there is now a widespread body of literature documenting and examining the extent of police mistreatment. Dr. Mark Finnane argued that, while policing is always political in its broader sense, in recent years the introduction of many agencies and interest groups concerned with police and police practices has changed the level and character of political involvement and power. For instance the introduction of the Deputy Ombudsman (Police Complaints), the now defunct Police Complaints Authority in Victoria, the various Law Reform Commission reports, all examined police behaviour. Secondly, various social and political movements have made the police and policing practices the focus of their attention, arguing for various changes in policing (changes which can involve either <U>more</U> policing, such as violence in the home and corporate crime, or <U>less</U> policing, such as policing the streets, aborigines, young people ). <P>
However, we must not make the mistake of assuming that the police are not, part of the broader political processes as police and policing is fundamentally about politics. <P>
One of the key considerations in the politics of policing has been the continual demands made by the police for continued growth of their share of state resources. However, the latest budget statement from the Victorian State Government, which aimed at attempting to persuade the community about the absolute necessity for all sections of the community and government services to &quot;pay&quot; for the serious financial difficulties that Victoria is currently facing, overlooked such a &quot;contribution&quot; from the police. Even in the most dire of economic circumstances, the police continue to maintain their level of government funding and experience a proportional real increase in this share. However, despite the dramatic and continued growth in police funding, the latest Annual Report (1991-92) contains a Foreword from the now retired Chief Commissioner of Police, Kel Glare, stating that his job has been difficult in part because of the &quot;substantial funding constraints&quot;. <P>
Police have done well under both Liberal and Labor parties. Increased police funding is not deterred by party politics. The police revelled in massive growth in funding under the Labor Government in the period 1981-1992, in terms of the raised capital expenditure on police stations, and significant improvement in their superannuation which has led to the departure of many experienced police officers. <P>
Resources should also be thought of in terms that encompass such matters as police powers. The Labor years witnessed an almost total achievement by the police of the powers they demanded, such as the abolition on time constraints for holding people in custody without formally charging them and powers to use force to take intimate body samples. Exceptions on which the Labor Government refused to submit to police political persuasion included the power to ask for a persons name an address without having reasonable suspicion that they had committed an offence (however this power is currently being sought), and some minor limits on the power to use force to obtain fingerprints and intimate body sample (a power which can be granted to the police by a magistrate if certain conditions are met). <P>
Put simply, the 1980's were good years for the police. They have benefited financially, they have been granted significant increases in their legal powers, and they through discrediting of the Police Complaints Authority(PCA) managed to rid themselves of this independent accountability mechanism. <P>
However, the community has begun to express further concerns about the continued growth in police funding. There is also concern about the level of police mistreatment of the public. It is true that such views are expressed by minority groups, organisations and individuals. It is also true that few publically endorse or embrace the massive police budget, and thus the continued effort by the police themselves to promote the idea that they are the &quot;thin blue line&quot;, working under difficult conditions to protect the community from passing over the precipice of order into chaos. <P>
There is evidence now emerging from the criminal justice system itself that there are some reasons to be concerned about police mistreatment and police accountability. In particular, the latest figures on formal complaints made against the police, as outlined in<B> Figure 1</B> indicates that, since 1988-89 the number of formal complaints against the Victoria Police has risen from 1056 to 4525 an increase of 410%. It is rather stunning therefore that in the latest Police Annual Report, one of the key mechanisms through which the police are accountable to the Parliament and to the People, the head of the Police Internal Investigations Department does not even bother to provide the actual number of complaints (though a Bar-Chart indicates the prevalence of complaints of police assault). Nothing is done to explain in the report the reasons behind the rise in complaints. The Police seem to accept that these figures merely confirm the level of public support for the current complaints procedures. If this is so then proponents of this view are left to explain firstly why there has been such a substantial increase in the number of complaints, and, secondly, why on a per capita basis there is almost one complaint for every two police officers! <P>
While the above view may be taken by police management, the findings of recent surveys on police mistreatment throw more light on the subject. Two recent public phone-in surveys have found remarkably similar results in Victoria and Western Australia. A Victorian Council for Civil Liberties survey found that of those who gave a reason for not formally complaining (N=53) about police mistreatment, 51% indicated that they feared possible repercussions from formally complaining. A further 26% believed that &quot;nothing was likely to happen&quot; (Palmer 1992a). A similar survey conducted in Western Australia found 60% of respondents had not made a formal complaint. Approximately 50% (N=115) didn't complain because they believed it would be of no use and 28% (N=64) of these because of fear of possible repercussions (Hall 1992:10). While policing issues are clearly not able to be compared directly between the states, the importance of these two surveys is the general finding that a significant number of people who allege police mistreatment do not have faith in the complaints mechanisms as they operate in each state. <P>
For those who are subject to the policing experience, and for some others, there is a growing concern about policing practices, concern about the effectiveness of policing, and concern about police efficiency. By their own measure, despite the dramatic increase in powers and in financial resources, the police have openly admitted that they have been unable to reduce crime. The police have responded to these concerns by shifts in the emphasis for the responsibility for crime. In this respect there has been an increased emphasis on the responsibility of the community in reducing crime. In effect the police suggest that they are no longer responsible by themselves for the war against crime. It is now a partnership. Examples of such a discourse has manifested itself in the promotion of the many &quot;Watches&quot; and similar campaigns. They have implemented Police Community Consultative Committees, police on foot patrol, on bike patrol, and police in primary schools &quot;educating&quot; the youth of tomorrow how the community must take measures to protect themselves against crime. <P>
These are just some of the broader issues against which this report is being produced. The police are a very powerful organisation, entrusted with significant powers over individuals - the power to detain, to arrest, to search, to charge and to prosecute. The police decide whether to bring a person into the criminal justice system or whether to keep them out of the system. Thus, any complaints about policing practices must be taken seriously. Beyond this, we believe that there must be greater powers and efforts to examine the nature of bad policing. <P>
This report focuses on the bad practices associated with contemporary policing in Victoria it also considers police mistreatment by focusing largely on police action rather than police inaction. Some might view this as &quot;splitting hairs&quot; but it is important to recognise that police mistreatment can sometimes involve the police denying some citizens protection and undervaluing their claims on police resources. 
<H3><A NAME="introduction">INTRODUCTION</A>
</H3>  <H3><A NAME="purpose">PURPOSE</A>:</H3>
The need for this police complaints survey arises from concern within the Federation of Community Legal Centres about the nature and extent of inappropriate police practices. <P>
The purpose of this survey is to collect information and take a &quot;snapshot&quot; of the way clients of community agencies in Victoria experience police mistreatment. The report examines details about incidents and how citizens respond in these situations. In addition, information is gathered about police practices and where mistreatment occurs. <P>
There is very little independent information available about the everyday practices of Victoria Police. By taking an annual snapshot it is possible to explore the nature of police mistreatment in Victoria and highlight issues for law reform. 
<H3><A NAME="objectives">OBJECTIVES</A>:<!--OBJECTIVES:--></h3>

The specific objectives of this survey were: 
<li>To give a voice to the concerns of citizens attending legal centres and other community agencies who have been mistreated by the police; 
<li>To gather information which helps the Federation of Community Legal Centres to develop a profile of incidents of mistreatment by police; 
<li>To identify trends that are occurring over the year(s) such as: <ul>
<li>the nature and extent of police mistreatment; 
<li>who is mistreated; 
<li>in what ways; 
<li>by whom; 
<li>what action is or isn't taken and what the reasons might be for such action OR inaction; </ul>
<li>To ascertain what, if any, gender, race, age or other discrimination practices are occurring; 
<li>To provide a practical focus for the development of recommendations. <P>
This report is based on the analysis of the results of a survey distributed by participating Victorian Community Legal Centres to individuals through a network of metropolitan and country community agencies in 1991-92. It is the second report on police mistreatment undertaken by the Federation of Community Legal Centres (Vic) Inc. and is one of many works in the area which have been presented in Victoria in the last decade.

Much of the research conducted by legal centres and other groups documents the prevalent nature of police mistreatment. The first survey (1990-91) initiated by the Federation of Community Legal Centres into police mistreatment of young people by police indicated that: 
<ul>
<li>84% of those surveyed were male, 
<li>78% were from an English speaking background, 
<li>51% were unemployed and 
<li>7% were from a professional/non-working class background. </ul>
Verbal abuse comprised 33% and physical abuse consisted of 29% of the incidents. <ul>
<li>31% of cases recorded on survey forms was a police record of interview completed 
<li>34% of cases no formal police action was taken 
<li>23% were charged by summons, 18% were charged and bailed 
<li>20% were kept in cells. </UL>
Some 64% of respondents indicated that they had not formally reported the incident. <ul>
<li>46% of these were either too frightened, feared reprisals, or were threatened, 
<li>27% didn't know how to make a complaint, and 
<li>22% believed that it would not have made any difference. </ul>
Of those who had reported only 20% had reported to an authority officially empowered to investigate complaints of police mistreatment. <P>
The first surveys' findings are similarly, to a Victorian Council for Civil Liberties telephone survey which found that of those who gave a reason for not formally complaining about police mistreatment, 51% indicated that they feared possible repercussions from formally complaining and 26% believed that &quot;nothing was likely to happen&quot; (Palmer 1992a). A similar survey conducted in Western Australia (N=380) found 60% of respondents had not made a formal complaint and that approximately 50% of these didn't complain because they believed it would be of no use and 28% because of fear of possible repercussions (Hall 1992:10). <P>
Existing research also indicates that those most frequently affected are vulnerable people who have little chance of defending themselves. 
<ul><li>The National Inquiry into Racist Violence heard evidence that many of the attacks upon Aborigines, young and old, were perpetrated by police. 
<li>Research undertaken in Victoria on homeless young people reports that 47% females and 50% per cent of males reported being physically hurt by police. 
<li>A report on young people and the police found that police were more likely to be heavyhanded in their dealings with young men, Aboriginal youth and marginal youth. These groups were more likely than other youth to be stopped and spoken to by the police, taken to a police station, and to report being roughed up. 
<li>A report by G.L.A.D., Gay men and Lesbians Against Discrimination, describes as &quot;the most disturbing aspect&quot; of the survey they undertook, the extent to which gay men and lesbians reported harassment, discrimination and violence at the hands of the police. 
<li>The 1991 survey undertaken by the Federation of Community Legal Centres into police mistreatment included a number of examples of police assault on young people and sexual abuse of women. </ul>
The latest figures indicate that the number of formal complaints against the Victoria Police has risen from 1056 to 4525 since 1988\89. This is an increase of 410% in four years. On the figures currently available there is now one complaint per year for every two sworn police officers in Victoria. <P>
Victoria Police have consistently denied the legitimacy of Victorian studies which demonstrate police misbehaviour. Further, while police themselves have recognised that traditional policing has failed Government funding of law and order policies has increased from $M495 in 1988-89 to $M634 in 1991-92 an increase of 30% in 4 years. It appears that police operating budgets have become sacrosanct, the State Government has indicated that police resources and police numbers for 1992-93 would not be cut, despite the massive cutbacks being made to all other state funded services. <P>
<!--<PRE> 0<B>Figure 1. <I>Formal Complaints Against the Police 1988/92 </I></B> </PRE> -->  <P>
Ironically, the ineffectiveness of pro-active policing by traditional police forces has been publically expressed. In the 1987-88 Annual Report the Chief Commissioner openly admitted that by themselves the police were unable to reduce crime. In this regard the police have responded to growing concern about police practices, the effectiveness of policing, and police efficiency, by imposing responsibility for crime prevention on the community. While we recognise the possible benefits that can arise out of various community policing initiatives such as Neighbourhood Watch, Police Community Consultative Committees, Police in Schools and via crime prevention programs, the point remains that law and order responses don't work, that the police say that they don't work and therefore rather than pursue more police, more resources, more police powers, and harsher sentencing, we must invest far more in community development. Similarly, the heavy promotion of community policing as an accountability mechanism fails to recognise the serious limits placed on community policing structures. These structures have no control over policing policy and practices and may in fact confuse accountability with public relations rather than a fundamental enhancement of police accountability. <P>
This report endeavours to do no more and no less than raise for debate important issues regarding police practices in Victoria. As the Deputy Ombudsman (Police Complaints) recently suggested: <P>
<B>&quot;the goal of any democratic community should be to have a trustworthy, professional and impartial police force....[t]he present system can be improved by [amongst other things]...most importantly, greater consideration given to the complainant's perception of the [complaints] system.&quot;(Perry, B. 1992)</B> <P>
We agree totally and present this report on the complainant's views of their experiences of police mistreatment. 
<H3><A NAME="methodology">METHODOLOGY</A>: </h3>
Some 2,500 survey forms were distributed to community agencies throughout metropolitan and country Victoria <B>(see <a href="police6.htm#a1">Appendix 1</a>.)</B> at the beginning of October 1991 seeking information on incidents occurring between June 1991 and January 1992. The survey time frame for return of completed questionnaires was the 4 months between October 1991 and January 1992. A total of 189 survey forms were returned to the Federation. <P>
The questionnaire was designed so that it could be completed quickly and simply, and guarantee the confidentiality of the person completing it <B>( <a href="police6.htm#a2">Appendix 2</a>)</B>. The 1991-92 survey has incorporated modifications based on information from the previous police survey conducted in 1990-91. The improved format of the 1991-92 survey is designed to provide a more detailed picture about the provision or denial of interpreters during police interviews as well as more detailed information regarding women and mistreatment of victims from Non-English Speaking Backgrounds (NESB). Other changes were also made to assist data-entry and computer analysis. <P>
Except where agencies have identified themselves on the form surveys remained anonymous so as to allay respondents' fears about confidentiality. <P>
<B>Methodological Limitations: </B> <P>
The key limitation on surveys of the type outlined above is that they only document the cases coming to the attention of the relevant agencies and relies on the clients willingness to participate. Police have legitimately criticised previous surveys on these grounds. This criticism can also be applied to police statistics about levels of crime. They are also based only on offences reported to or by police and so reflect response rates rather than true crime rates. <P>
Given the mixture of legal workers, para-legals, youth and welfare agency workers who co-operated with the survey, we have obtained a spread of case types beyond those which might normally come to the attention of Community Legal Centres. Nonetheless, we recognise that the method is still limited by the need for the respondents to develop a sense of victimisation and a willingness to at least discuss this with one of the workers who had agreed to facilitate the surveying process. <P>
Other limits to the survey include: <ul>
<li>the survey was conducted in English written form; 
<li>for self-completion the survey demanded a certain level of literacy skills; 
<li>cultural factors may have limited the degree of co-operation with the survey; 
<li>lack of control over sample; 
<li>sample anonymity precluded follow-up; 
<li>no information was collected about psychological trauma; 
<li>agency-worker resistance to surveying; 
<li>a failure to target Aboriginal agencies </ul>
All these limitations are more likely to have underestimated the frequency of reported police mistreatment. Furthermore, respondents were given a choice of 14 categories of types of mistreatment <B>(see <a href="police3.htm#s2_4">Section 2.4</a>)</B> to ensure consistency in their responses but only up to three responses were coded as it was felt that the use of three categories would provide sufficient data to provide an understanding of the types of mistreatment being experienced. In effect there are two limits to the use of the data in this question. First, a code was constructed to rank the responses in order of perceived seriousness. While at face value it would appear fairly easy to construct a hierarchy in the response categories available, this contains a danger of imposing the researchers views of seriousness and not that of the victim of the mistreatment. <P>
The second limitation to the results in this question is that at the time of completing the forms there were some doubts about whether respondents were able to tick more than one category. Discussions with agency workers who assisted in the completion of the forms confirm that there was some confusion about whether more than one box could be ticked. The impact of this methodological problem is that the extent of mistreatment is likely to be understated. <H3><br><hr></ul>
