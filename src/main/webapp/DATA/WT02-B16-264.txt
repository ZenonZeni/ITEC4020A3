<p><font size=+2>L</font>arge-scale photovoltaic power plants, consisting of many PV
arrays installed together, can prove useful to utilities.
Utilities can build PV plants much more quickly than they can
build conventional power plants because the arrays themselves are
easy to install and connect together electrically. Utilities can
locate PV plants where they are most needed in the grid because
siting PV arrays is much easier than siting a conventional power
plant. And, unlike conventional power plants, PV plants can be
expanded incrementally as demand increases. Finally, PV power
plants consume no fuel and produce no air or water pollution while
they silently generate electricity.

enough power to serve 660 Sacramento-area homes. The 1600
modules are spread across an 8094-m<sup>2</sup> field in this very sunny
region of California. Incidentally, SMUD
opted to close down the nuclear reactors in favor of "cleaner" energy
technology. (Photo: W. Gretz, NREL)</font>

<p>Unfortunately, PV generation plants have several characteristics
that have slowed their use by utilities. Under current utility
accounting, PV-generated electricity still costs considerably more
than electricity generated by conventional plants, and regulatory
agencies require most utilities to supply electricity for the
lowest cash cost. Furthermore, photovoltaic systems produce power
only during daylight hours and their output varies with the
weather. Utility planners must therefore treat a PV power plant
differently than they would treat a conventional plant.
