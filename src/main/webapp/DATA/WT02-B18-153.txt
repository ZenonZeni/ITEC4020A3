<h1>Q & A's Excerpted From 2/6/96 Conference Call</h1>

<b>
Opening Remarks by Jack J. Luchese</b>
<P>
Good morning.  Over the past week we had the pleasure of making two important announcements.  One was the start of Phase I clinical trials for Vaxcel’s Optivax®  vaccine delivery system.  The second was the signing of Vetlife’s deal with Ivy Laboratories to market cattle growth promotants.
<P>
Our plan is to have a series of conference calls like this supplemented by visits to our major investors and broker networks throughout 1996.  We will be including individual subsidiary presidents on these investor updates to give you the opportunity to become better acquainted with our subs and their leadership.
<P>
With that said, I would like to turn this over to Rich Shuler, Vetlife’s president and CEO to review the Vetlife / Ivy agreement and respond to your questions about Vetlife.  Then, I’ll be happy to answer your questions on CytRx in general.

<P>

<b>Richard Shuler (RS)</b> 


Thanks, Jack.  I thank all of you for your interest in joining us this morning.  You may not be familiar with Vetlife -- I’ve been here about a year and a half.  I came here as President and CEO to develop and commercialize technologies that were part of the CytRx family.  I also came here with a vision to build a viable animal health company.  Last week we took the first major step towards realizing that vision.
<P>
Before I joined Vetlife, I was responsible for Syntex’s North American Animal Health Products company.  We became the dominant market share leader in cattle products, particularly in growth promotants.  One of the companies that I competed successfully against was a generic producer named Ivy Laboratories. I became acquainted with their owner and we built a mutual respect for each other, though I must say we really were his nemesis! 
<P>
Last fall, Ivy decided to end their distribution relationship with Upjohn.  Their owner contacted me to see if I would be interested in joining him to grow his business.  I am pleased to report that the results of my  discussions with him is a 10-year agreement to market and distribute Ivy’s line of cattle growth promotant products.
<P>
Vetlife’s agreement with Ivy has three significant elements.  First, on January 1, 1997, we will take over Ivy’s current line of growth promotant products for the US and Canada.  Second, Ivy has applications pending with the FDA for new generic growth promotant products which we will market as soon as they are approved.  And third, we have rights to other technologies that Ivy will develop for the North American market.
<P> 
I am confident that Vetlife’s Cattle Marketing Group will be successful.  Here’s why:
<P>
You may be aware that since I left Syntex, they were bought by Roche who subsequently sold much of the animal health business to American Home Products.  My key Syntex team members elected not to join American Home and are available and excited about joining Vetlife’s new venture.  We have done this before and our template is successful. 
<p>
We will be beginning with a proven team that is highly respected.  At Syntex, we were ranked number one in large cattle customer service in the US for five consecutive years.  My team has a track record of successfully differentiating products to build market share.
<p>
At Syntex we relied heavily on distributors.  We built a high trust bond with them.  In the US, three distributors -- all of whom are personal friends -- generate about 85% of the sales for this $100 million market.  We also worked closely with the cattle producers.  There has been consolidation in the beef industry, just like we’ve seen in other industries, and 25 corporate organizations now feed about 40% of the beef we eat.  We just met with them all in San Antonio, and they’re pleased my team is back in this business because we have a reputation for adding valuable services that differentiate us from the others. 
<p>
This agreement is an excellent fit with Vetlife’s other technologies currently in development.  We have a non-antibiotic growth promotant that we’re in the process of licensing out.  Second, we have two other classes of compounds that we’re evaluating.  One is for adjuvants to improve vaccines -- something that  is desperately needed in the food animal industry.  The other is for potentiators to improve the performance of anti-microbials.  The Vetlife Cattle Marketing Group will provide us with the brand name and awareness that will enable us to market direct in North America should these technologies prove efficacious and safe.
<p>
The bottom line is that I’m excited about having a presence in the beef market no later than January 1.  We will be generating sales, profits and cash flow from the sale of established products.  And, I am excited about the potential of other growth promotant products that Ivy has in development. 
<p> 
<b>
Rich, What did you accomplish at the Cattle Show in San Antonio?  </b><p>

RS - We wanted to establish three things.  One was to let the producers know we will be back in the business, and that the services and value we established at Syntex will be there again.  Second, along with Ivy, we met with the three privately owned distributors who control 85% of our target segment, so that they were aware of our strategies and would continue to be supportive of us at launch.  I’m pleased that all three gave excellent feedback, and we can expect a high level of cooperation from them.  The third was to conduct customer input sessions to explore and test novel differentiation strategies.
<P>
<b>When do you plan to sell your products nationwide?
</b> 

<p>  

RS - We will sell nationwide from the start.
<p>
<b>Please give us some kind of feel of what you’d expect to do in this $100 million dollar marketplace in the first year or two.</b><p>

RS - We anticipate sales in the $6-$8 million dollar range with the current products that are already approved for marketing.  New products, when approved, will be in a family of products that have an average selling price about three times higher than the current line.  Assuming FDA approvals of these new products, these could add $4 to $6 million to our sales.
<p>
<b>Are you going to be bringing more people in-house, or are you going to do a "virtual" organization for this?</b><p>

RS - We plan a hybrid.  We’re already lean and mean, and because of the consolidation of this industry, we don’t need a large organization.  But we’ll be heavy into technical services to provide added value to our line of products.  We’ve already hired one of my former tech service managers.  And also, my former Global Business Unit Manager, joined me on Monday.  We’re in the process now of slowly firing up so by December, we’ll have a full complement of top quality former Syntex tech services professionals, backed by a small group of operations people.  We’re going to maintain a lean presence because of two things -- a heavy reliance on distributors, and a consolidating industry that doesn’t require large sales organizations to reach the growth promotant market.
<p>
<b>Will you have to carry large inventories to supply your customers?</b><p>


RS - These are long-dated products and our distributors are willing to carry full lot runs. It’s pretty much a year-round market.  We’ll rely on the major distributors to maintain large levels of inventory and sell direct to market and to smaller distributors.

<p>
<p>
<b>Remarks by Jack J. Luchese </b><p>

I’d like to give you an overall recap of CytRx and where we are today.  Keep in mind, when you buy CytRx shares, you’re essentially buying four distinct business units.  You’re buying Vetlife, which needless to say, we’re very excited about.  Rich Shuler is a first-rate, first-class executive -- and a proven leader.  He is well-respected in this industry and has received a number of honors by the cattlemen.  With CytRx, the second business unit you buy is Vaxcel.  Vaxcel’s strategy is really developing in 1996 as they have entered Phase I human trials with their Optivax  vaccine delivery system. This is the first time Optivax has been in man, and we’re excited about that.  You’ll hear more about that in a couple of weeks when we plan to have a conference call with Paul Wilson, Vaxcel’s president.  Also, we own Proceutics, which is a pharmaceutical development services company.  This is a cash business, and we expect it to generate cash flow for CytRx.  And, finally you have CytRx’s human therapeutics portfolio of which RheothRx is the most important.  There’s a new story on RheothRx, that you’ll be hearing more about over the next several months.  
<p>
I want to also recap some important issues.  After the reverse split, we now have about 7.9 million shares outstanding.  We are currently selling at a market capitalization of approximately $36 million dollars.  Since we have cash and fixed assets of $31 million dollars, the market is assigning a technology value of only $5 million dollars.  That is incredibly low -- I think we are one of the most under-valued stocks in the market today, and I think CytRx is a great buy for 1996, and the story will develop very nicely throughout 1997.  
<p>
Looking ahead to 1997,  we are comfortable saying that CytRx  (including subsidiaries) will generate $10 million in sales from our various businesses.  So we’re putting our financial house in order, and we’re building a lot of sustainable value for our shareholders.
<p>
I’ll be happy to respond to your questions about CytRx
<p>
<b>I’d like to follow-up on a series of comments that were made immediately following the adverse RheothRx announcement back in October.  At that time, I believe it was stated by the company that upon receipt of all of the documentation, you would review those materials and see if there was anything further that could be pursued with regard to RheothRx.  What has been the progress so far?</b><p>

About three weeks ago, we received a copy of the 11,000 page IND document from Glaxo Wellcome.  We’re poring through that as it contains a lot of good information. The next milestone is when Glaxo Wellcome files its annual report to the FDA.  Once they file the annual report, they will officially transfer the IND to CytRx.  That is important as CytRx is not permitted to speak directly with the FDA about RheothRx until we have control of the IND. 
<p>
We are looking at the potential of a purified form of RheothRx for an orphan indication sickle cell crisis.  We have not made a firm decision to proceed.  We plan to meet with the FDA and assess their attitude towards that possibility.  Then we will make a business decision as to whether we will continue with RheothRx.  I expect that decision to be made sometime in the middle of the year.
<p>
<b>Do you have any time frame for how long the Optivax Phase I study will take?</b><p>

This Phase I study is expected to take most of 1996.  It is a dose escalating study to determine maximum tolerated doses.  You start lower, and go progressively higher with different patient groups.  The current protocol requires completion of each lower group before starting a higher dose group.  It’s possible that could be accelerated, but I wouldn’t want to speculate on that right now.
<p>
Thank you for your time and your questions. We appreciate your interest in CytRx and look forward to talking to you again in a couple of weeks.
