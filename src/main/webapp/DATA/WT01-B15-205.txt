The Council of State Governments is a non-profit, state supported and directed service
organization that provides research and creates a network for legislative, executive, and judicial
branch representatives.  The Council of State Governments/Eastern Regional Conference
(CSG/ERC) represents ten northeastern states (Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Massachusetts,
New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and Vermont), as well as
the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the Province of Quebec. The
CSG/ERC strives to increase the effectiveness of state government by promoting multi-state
initiatives, facilitating cooperation between legislative and executive branch policy makers, and
educating state officials in policy areas of special concern to the region.  CSG/ERC also acts as a
catalyst to forge closer ties between the public and private sector.
<P>
The Northeast High-Level Radioactive Waste Transportation Project (The Project), directed by
CSG/ERC staff, helps the U.S. Department of Energy identify and analyze issues pertaining to the
transportation of high-level radioactive waste and spent fuel from commercial nuclear power
generators in the Northeast.  The Project also educates state legislative and executive branch
officials in the Northeast on legislative, technical, and regulatory matters related to the
transportation of high-level radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel in the Northeast.
