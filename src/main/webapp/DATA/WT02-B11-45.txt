What is good practice in a Danish gymnasium and similar upper secondary institutions?</B><P>
This booklet is an attempt to sum up the criteria used in the evaluation of educational practice of upper secondary schools  of particularly relevance to &quot;school inspections&quot;.<P>
<P>
In Denmark we introduced upper secondary school evaluations in 1989 based on <B>voluntary participation</B> and <B>a selfcritical attitude</B> of the staff: Schools apply to the ministry in order to participate, and the evaluation proces begins with a selfevaluation by the school, followed by a fourday visit by a group of subject advisers and general inspectors from the ministry. The visiting team produces a public report that is sent to all schools.<P>
<P>
The English text of this booklet is a translation from the Danish original from 1993, which was sent to all teachers, school leaders and  all school boards.<P>
<P>
Student organisations, teacher organisations, The Danish associations of principals (for gymnasia as well as for adult education centres) and The Association of County Councils in Denmark have been involved in the formulation of these &quot;quality indicators&quot;.<P>
<P>
Thus what is descibed an explication of the shared  but hitherto mainly tacit  understanding of what constitutes effective teaching and learning at this level in Denmark. In its choice of words and selection of topics the Danish original reflects a particular national tradition for nonhierarchical schools and informal studentteacher relations. These and other characteristics of our particular educational context are naturally presupposed in the translation, so my best advice to the foreign reader is:<P>
<P>
Come and see for yourself! <P>

<a name="intro"></a><h3>Introduction</h3></B><P>
<P>
<B>Central educational supervision</B><P>
This booklet is the result of the Department of Upper-Secondary Education's deliberations as to what constitutes a good school, good instruction and good educational leadership.<P>
<P>
The Department of Upper-Secondary Schools in the Ministry of Education supervises the subjects and the pedagogical work in the country's upper-secondary schools, adult upper-secondary courses, higher preparatory courses and higher preparatory instruction at adult education centres. The Department sets goals for upper-secondary and higher preparatory education, checks whether the goals are achieved, gathers and disseminates information, gives advice, and follows the subject-specific, pedagogical and administrative developments at these institutions.<P>
<P>
This supervision is carried out by thirty subject advisers from the whole country, all of whom concurrently teach at a school, and by ten staff members (eight with a background in education, two with a background in the law), who have their offices in the ministry.<P>
<P>
By means of these basic comments, the Department of Upper-Secondary Education wishes to put into words a number of school phenomena about which there has hitherto been implicit agreement or perhaps an ambiguous policy. The Department's work on this booklet has corresponded to the process that any upper-secondary school, higher preparatory course or adult education centre must go through, at a time when more and more decisions are put in the hands of the School management.<P>
<P>
Successful local management requires that the employees of the school or course have a shared attitude to questions like: What do we find especially important? How would we like to develop in the years to come? How do we find out whether we are achieving the goals that we set for ourselves?<P>
<P>
<B>Why &quot;Signs of Quality&quot; now?</B><P>
Just like other public institutions, the various types of schools must thoroughly reconsider and re-describe their function at the present time. Leaders, teachers and boards of upper-secondary and higher preparatory schools state that they find it increasingly desirable, indeed necessary, to have a consciously considered attitude towards the basic values of the school. Routine and habit, which were taken for granted some years ago, must be formulated anew and justified, both internally vis-&agrave;-vis the students, and externally vis-&agrave;-vis parents and the institutions at which the students may continue their studies. More than ever before, the school must make an effort to show its worth.<P>
<P>
In the upper-secondary school and the higher preparatory courses there is a long tradition of quite detailed descriptions of the content of the individual subjects. However, when we need to formulate everything that is important for the quality of education that exists around and about the subjects themselves, we often lack precise expressions. It is difficult, for instance, to speak precisely about that &quot;little bit extra&quot; that we want to give the students beyond &quot;mere subject matter&quot;. It is a widespread view that schools cannot employ concepts of leadership and co-operation used in industry, for example; there is a need for new concepts, for a new vocabulary about school development.<P>
<B><P>
The contents of this booklet</B><P>
The first section of this booklet gives an outline of the history of the types of schools that aim at general education and education for further study. This history goes back a very long time, and the content and structure of the upper-secondary school and the higher preparatory examination are still strongly influenced by it.<P>
<P>
The next section deals with the concepts of general education and education preparatory to further study, key words in the descriptions of the aims of the upper-secondary school and the higher preparatory examination.<P>
<P>
The following sections deal with the school's pedagogical climate, with teachers, students, instruction, assessment of students' progress, school leadership, co-operation and physical setting. Each chapter consists of a brief, descriptive section. Next there is a catalogue of quality criteria, &quot;signs of quality&quot;, for the area concerned, which, as mentioned in the foreword, does not pretend to be exhaustive. In most cases the items are arranged to proceed from the general to the specific.<P>
<P>
<B><P>
<P>
<P>
Choice of words</B><P>
For stylistic reasons, the word &quot;student&quot; is used throughout when referring to young people as well as adults, and the word &quot;class&quot; is used, even though &quot;group&quot; might have been more precise in some cases. The word &quot;school&quot; covers all types of institutions.<P>

<a name="history"></a><h3>The History of the Upper-Secondary School and the Higher Preparatory Examination</h3><P>
<P>
<B>Roots in the Middle Ages</B><P>
In order to understand the position of the upper-secondary school and the higher preparatory examination in the educational system as a whole, one must know their history.<P>
<P>
The upper-secondary school has its roots in the medieval &quot;Latin schools&quot; or grammar schools, which prepared young men for a life of service in the Roman Catholic Church. Thus, almost all the cathedral schools can trace their histories back to the time before the Reformation. When a university was founded in Denmark at the end of the 15th century, it became the task of the grammar schools to prepare students for university studies as well.<P>
<P>
One hundred years ago,&quot;the learned school&quot;, as the upper-secondary school was called up to the beginning of this century, prepared approximately one per cent of the male population for the university studies that led to public office.<P>
<P>
<P>
<B>The reform of 1903</B><P>
The Act on Higher General Schools of 1903 confirmed the upper-secondary school's function in preparing students for further study and in giving general education. At the same time the Act introduced three crucial reforms: Living languages, especially English and German, were allotted more lessons. Girls were now allowed to take school leaving examinations at state schools. A transition from elementary school to higher education was made possible.<P>
The reform meant that students could now choose one of three sides: one for classical languages, one for mathematics and the natural sciences (from 1871), and one for modern languages (from 1903). From having been moulded on the classical educational ideal of previous centuries, with Greek and Latin as the main subjects, the upper-secondary school developed into a school in which the individual student was able to specialize through choosing one of the three sides. Danish, history, religion and a new subject called &quot;classical studies&quot; were common to the three sides, as these were considered the most important subjects for a general education.<P>
<P>
The Act created cohesion in the educational system from the first school year to the school leaving examination by concurrently introducing a four-year middle school that qualified students for the upper-secondary school. In this way a greater part of the population were able to take a school leaving examination. Along with industrialization, a larger, well-educated middle class had become necessary, and the Act became a tool for meeting this need.<P>
<P>
<P>
<B>The reform of 1958</B><P>
The Act of 1958 was an extension of the development started by the reform of 1903. A number of new options for students were introduced. On entering the upper-secondary school students still had to choose between the language and the mathematics side, but from the second year, the students chose lines within the sides.<P>
<P>
Three new lines were introduced: biology, social studies and music. The classical languages were reduced to line status.<P>
<P>
The options offered in this reform turned out to strengthen the tendency already apparent in the Act of 1903: the upper-secondary school was becoming a broader form of education for the young.<P>
<P>
<P>
<B>The higher preparatory examination and single-subject courses</B><P>
The Act on the Higher Preparatory Examination was adopted in 1966. The background for it was a political wish to establish a new path within the educational system and a path back to the educational system. The higher preparatory examination aimed at being open &quot;at the top&quot; and providing qualifications for higher education. It also aimed at being open &quot;at the bottom&quot;, i.e. not only accessible for those who came direct from school, but for everyone who had acquired the necessary qualifications in one way and another.<P>
<P>
The examination could be taken after independent study, and all students were to be assessed purely on the basis of their examination results. Periodic marking was abolished and examinations were held in all subjects.<P>
<P>
This new two-year course of study contained a core of obligatory subjects in addition to optional subjects, and more independent forms of studying were to be employed. The higher preparatory examination was expected to appeal both to adults and young people who had experienced more than going to school, or who wished to take an examination preparatory to further study that was different from the school leaving examination.<P>
<P>
From 1970 it became possible (at first as an experiment, later permanently) to take a higher preparatory examination consisting of tests in single subjects taken over several years. Parallel with the two-year course, which was usually established at an upper-secondary school or a college of education, a single-subject system was set up at the higher preparatory courses (later called adult education centres). The two-year courses and the single-subject system evolved into an educational course for young people and adults during the 70s and 80s - growing quite vigorously. <P>
<P>
The higher preparatory examination has fulfilled a political wish for an alternative to the upper-secondary school that could make a course of education for further study attractive to young people and adults from milieus in which continuing on in the educational system had not been the ordinary thing.<P>
<P>
<B><P>
The upper-secondary school reform of 1988</B><P>
This reform retained the division into language and mathematics sides, but in such a way that the language students are now able to take more science and the mathematics students more foreign language. At the same time the structure of lines has been replaced by a system of optional subjects, so that the students no longer choose groups of subjects, but are now able to combine various subjects. All students choose two or three subjects at the high level and one or two subjects at intermediary level.<P>
<P>
At the same time the common core areas of the subjects have been clearly indicated, and the content descriptions and instruction guidelines have been modernized.<P>
<P>
This reform is an extension of the other reforms of this century, with increasingly greater possibilities for specialization and for free combinations of optional subjects across the boundaries of the sides. The large group of subjects that is common to all students has been retained, however.<P>
<P>
As part of this reform, the individual schools have been given greater economic and pedagogic powers (management by objectives) vis-&agrave;-vis the counties and the Ministry of Education.<P>
<B><P>
<P>
The higher preparatory reform of 1991</B><P>
After twenty-five years a need had arisen for revision of the higher preparatory examination. Amongst other things better possibilities for co-operation were established between the two-year courses and the single-subject system. The number of subjects offered was adjusted, and the possibility to take subjects at high level was introduced into the higher preparatory examination.<P>
<P>
<B>Adult upper-secondary courses</B><P>
Until the higher preparatory examination was introduced by the Act of 1966, adult upper-secondary courses were the only option for adults who wished to qualify themselves for higher education. Since the beginning of this century the courses had been an essential aspect of the educational structure and they still constitute an option for the adults who wish to take a school leaving examination in two years. Since 1991, when it became possible to take a school leaving examination as a single-subject examination, these courses have gained new opportunities for combining traditional two-year courses with single-subject courses.<P>
<P>
<P>
<B>Four upper-secondary courses of education for</B> <B>young people</B><P>
The upper-secondary school and adult upper-secondary courses no longer have a monopoly on preparing students for higher education. Today there are four different upper-secondary courses of education for young people. Just as the higher preparatory examination has done from the beginning, the higher commercial examination and the higher technical examination now qualify students for higher education. More flexibility has been attained by formally making the four courses of education comparable. In several subjects it is possible to be credited for course units that have been completed (&quot;getting credit&quot;), if one transfers from one course of education to another.<P>
<P>
What is characteristic of the upper-secondary school and the higher preparatory examination - despite their differences - is that they are &quot;general&quot;, i.e. they do not in themselves qualify the students for occupations, and the subjects offered comprise a relatively large number of obligatory common core subjects that stress the humanities, music and creativity in general. In the upper-secondary school and the higher preparatory examination, the concept of preparing for higher education is closely linked with general education from the outset, as was the case in the grammar school and in the &quot;Latin school&quot; before it.<P>
<P>
<P>
<B>The upper-secondary school and the higher preparatory examination in the 1990s</B><P>
The expectations of a general education preparing young people for further study  have not decreased over the past twenty-five to thirty years. The information-orientated society, which is now replacing the industrial society at full speed, makes great demands on general knowledge and on linguistic as well as mathematical and scientific skills. In the flow of information from the printed and the electronic media, the ability - as well as the courage - to differentiate between essential and non-essential has become more important than ever, and a crucial quality of any course of education is to develop this ability in its student. This is done by letting the students gain an understanding of the structure of the physical world, for instance, of the course of history and of social and technological development - and by reflecting on their own place in it.<P>
<P><hr>
<a name="general"></a><h3>General Education and Education for Further Study</h3><P>
<P>
<B>The aims</B><P>
The task of the upper-secondary school and the higher preparatory examination is to provide an education that ensures the necessary basis for higher education and to provide a general education. The formally stated objects reflect a view of schools and education that makes the student's personal and academic development the aim of the instruction. Through the subjects, students gain access to a larger world, and the examination is a guarantee that the academic aims of the instruction have been achieved. This holds true even though examinations may only be held in part of the instructional content. <P>
<P>
In the upper-secondary school and the higher preparatory examination there are no short cuts to a general education: The development of both young and adult students towards greater personal independence and responsibility proceeds through acquiring subject-specific knowledge, insight and skills. In this instance a general education means the process by which the student develops, throughworking with the areas and contexts of a subject and through interplay with teachers and other students. By encountering that which is new and different and by meeting others, the students learn to understand themselves, their backgrounds and their possibilities.<P>
<P>
Students cannot take over a finished &quot;education package&quot;; they must work along on the project themselves by building on their own experience, taking the consequences of the choices they make, and making use of the give and take provided by their teachers.<P>
<P>
This give and take occurs in the instruction, both in the academic subjects and in the social extra-curricular events that the school offers, e.g. choir, drama, sports and study groups.<P>
<P>
<B>General education and the subjects</B><P>
The idea that students become mature personalities in the course of the time they spend in school has existed in European thinking since the Renaissance. As an extra bonus to knowledge, the students were supposed to develop and become prepared to assume lives as responsible and independent individuals. This is the educational ideal that lives on for young and adult students in the formally stated objects of the upper-secondary school and the higher preparatory examination, but no indication is given of how the ideal is to be made a reality. Every school must therefore deliberate how the concept is to be utilized in the present reality and link it to the school's group of students and the requirements made by the contents of the subjects.<P>
<P>
<B>All subjects lead to a general education</B><P>
Obligatory as well as optional subjects are obliged to fulfil this double aim: In other words, all subjects lead to preparation for further study and to a general education. Thus no subjects in themselves qualify students for an occupation, but they prepare students for further study. At the same time the student's personal education is furthered through the thinking processes that the instruction in the subjects stimulates, for instance, about the basic conditions of existence, the norms of society and the individual's attitudes and experience.<P>
<P>


<P>
<P><hr>
<a name="goodsch"><h3>A Good School</h3></a><P>
<B><P>
The atmosphere of the school</B><P>
Every school has a particular atmosphere, which may be difficult to define. The ambience of the place, the special mood, which is the result of a long period of major and minor decisions, has a great effect on how much benefit the students derive from the instruction. A frank and open-minded sense of fellowship in the classes can determine whether the individual students get the opportunity to open up and demonstrate what they can do as regards subject matter and more general areas. A sense of taking pleasure in one's work and a sense of being involved in the interplay between teacher and student are difficult phenomena to document - although it is plain to anybody if they are missing.<P>
<P>
Although instruction is the main thing, the intensity of everything else that happens at a school is also of great importance. The quality of events arranged for the whole school and of the school's various extra-curricular activities affects the academic and social benefit that the students derive from their time at school. Activity days, or theme days, and school parties create a sense of unity within the individual class and between classes and year groups. Morning assemblies with brief notices, songs and performances underline this fellowship day by day. Excursions and assemblies can be academic and social highlights of the students' school-days. Furthermore the involvement that students exhibit in the school's extra-curricular activities, like a class play, choir and orchestra, athletics, art, and study groups, contributes to their total school experience.<P>
<P>
<B><P>
Adult education centres (VUC)</B><P>
At adult education centres the picture is different. <P>
Normally an adult education centre consists of both a higher preparatory section (hf) and a section for general adult education (AVU). The most important elements in determining the institution's atmosphere are:<P>
     <P>
- 	the institution's ability to project itself as a unit, one milieu, despite the fact that instruction is spread out over the whole day and evening and takes place in several different venues,<P>
     - 	the involvement of teachers and students in activities at the centre that take place at times other than lesson times.<P>
<P>
It can be difficult to get students involved in the centre as an institution if, for instance, they are only taking a single subject. In addition many teachers at adult education centres also have other teaching jobs, e.g. related to courses set up for businesses and firms in the area, so they are unable to participate in the daily life of the school during these periods. The same is true of those teachers at adult education centres who are employed by another institution.<P>
<P>
On the other hand, these outside activities can bring life to the institution. A dynamic is created in the interplay between ordinary instruction at the centre and work on developing instruction for new groups of students. <P>
<P>
<B><P>
The school's understanding of itself</B><P>
What does the individual school want to characterize its atmosphere and educational environment, beyond the features common to all upper-secondary schools and higher preparatory courses? The goals and priorities of a school can be seen at several levels: from the overall ideas of the distinctive character of the school to the kinds of extra-curricular instruction offered and on to the &quot;social traffic regulations&quot; that apply inside and outside the classroom.<P>
<P>
For instance, one school may wish to stress its interest in international contacts, another school may attach great importance to the students' having a say in decision making, and at the same time the school may wish to emphasize its strength in certain academic areas: the natural sciences, the school's creative activities, music, or its use of new technology for instruction.<P>
<P>
<P>
<B>The school's development</B><P>
A good school is dynamic. Among other things, this means that it is constantly developing and has worked out a form of self-assessment which is a regular feature of the school's life. This implies that there is a feeling of loyalty among colleagues on the staff, which allows the school's goals and priorities to be discussed and revised regularly.<P>
<P>
Through various forms of repeated analysis of aspects of the school's function, the school forms a picture of what its strengths and weaknesses are. By means of a conscious and well-planned common effort, any faults can then be redressed.<P>
<P><hr>
<P>
<I>	<h3>SIGNS OF QUALITY</h3><P>
<B>The School's Atmosphere</B><P>
<P>
The school has a clear policy on the following:<P>
     *	the school's understanding of itself and its role in the local community,<P>
     *	the academic subjects and activities the school wishes to offer,<P>
     *	the demands made to students and staff concerning social conventions and personal responsibility, and the consequences of not living up to the demands,<P>
     *	activities and events available to students outside class hours,<P>
     *	regular assessment of the students and information about their level of attainment.<P>
<P>
The school has traditions that the teachers and students appreciate, maintain and renew.<P>
<P>
There are frequent events at the school that affect all or great numbers of teachers and/or students, e.g. acitivities for the whole school, a class play, a choir in which teachers and students participate, theme days, study trips, exchanges with foreign teachers and students.<P>
<P>
<P>
<b>
The School's Development<P>
</B><P>
A feature of the school is that teachers and administration discuss how general education and education for further study are best dealt with in practice.<P>
<P>
The school has a clear policy on the subjects offered, experimental instruction and extra-curricular activities that reflects the overall goals.<P>
The school has discussed and decided what changes in its usual way of doing things will be made as a result of the greater degree of self-management in the following areas:<P>
<P>
     *	distribution of resources for teaching materials, teachers' inservice training and study trips <P>
     *	the use of monies allocated through collective bargaining agreements.<P>
<P>
At various levels (in departments, in the administration, in the teachers' council, among students, etc.) a time and place are provided for reflecting on how the school functions. Topics of general pedagogic interest are discussed.<P>
<P>
The school has a sense of loyalty among colleagues that makes it natural for teachers to discuss one another's teaching. Teachers may sit in on one another's lessons, where this is agreed upon.<P>
<P>
The school has attempted to shed light on how the students, the staff and/or parents or others outside the school assess the quality of the instruction, e.g. in the form of a questionnaire.<P>
</I><P><hr>
<a name="climate"><h3>A School's Pedagogical Climate</h3><P></a>
<P>
<B>Good teaching</B><P>
There is no simple recipe for good teaching. Teaching is a dynamic process and each lesson is a living experiment. A lesson is not necessarily bad, of course, because something happens other than what the teacher and students had imagined.<P>
<P>
Successful teaching depends on whether the teacher can utilize the students' background and interest in the subject and get them to continue to work on it in an independent manner. If that happens, the result will be a high academic standard and valuable general qualifications. Serious work with the subject matter furthers independence, creativity and a critical faculty.<P>
<P>
The ability to proceed independently in working on academic and general problems is becoming increasingly more important in a rapidly changing world. Therefore, students must learn to ask questions - not least of themselves. The teacher must contribute to stimulating the students' thirst for knowledge, open-mindedness and desire to experiment. One of the ways of doing this is to ensure that the students themselves are involved in planning the course of instruction.<P>
<P>
<B>Imparting knowledge and general education</B><P>
Obviously a teacher must have good academic and pedagogical qualifications in order to teach a subject. The teacher's task is to arouse the students' interest, show them the possibilities of the subject, and evoke initiatives from them by making demands. It is important to combine experience and reflection, and it is also important that the students work with the subject matter in a serious, imaginative and independent way.<P>
<P>
If the instruction is to be called general education, it requires that the subjects are dealt with in a way that links the individual student's world to the larger world that exists in the subjects and in the various sets of technical language. The sum of the subjects and the links between them is part of what makes up general education.<P>
<P>
<B><P>
Requirements and consequences</B><P>
Students have rights and duties while they go to school. A positive feature of a school is that it has many academic and social activities to offer, that it emphasizes the students' own responsibility for benefiting from the instruction, and that it expects that they make an effort themselves. However, in order not to confuse requirements with what is offered, the school must show the students that their actions have positive and negative consequences.<P>
<P>
<P><hr>
<I><h3>SIGNS OF QUALITY</h3><P>
<B>The School's Pedagogical Climate<P>
</B><P>
The instruction is characterized by high academic standards, and by teachers' and students' planning, carrying out and evaluating the instruction as a joint effort, for which they are all responsible.<P>
<P>
All teachers vary the format of the instruction to suit the requirements of the subject matter and the students' backgrounds.<P>
<P>
Written and oral work, data processing and other means of communication are employed in all subjects.<P>
<P>
Various activities take place outside the classroom as part of the instruction, e.g. field trips. <P>
<P>
The school's teachers co-operate within the subjects and across them:<P>
<P>
The instruction is co-ordinated in an attempt to further the students' understanding of unity and cohesion, strengthen their skills at expressing themselves and give them sound working habits.<P>
<P>
The teachers' diversity is made a fruitful part of the life of the school and is appreciated by the school's administration.<P>
<P>
                                  <P>
P>
Requirements and Consequences<P>
</B><P>
From the outset, students are aware that attend-<P>
ance is required and aware of the amount of work required in each subject.<P>
<P>
The school's teachers are in agreement as to the penalties that apply to insufficient preparation and poor motivation, and they employ them.<P>
<P>
The school informs students and parents about its policy on excessive absenteeism. At the same time the students are informed about the school's procedure, which clarifies the students' situation at an early stage in an open and honest manner.<P>
<P>
Written assignments are required to be given in at the time appointed; by the same token they are marked, commented on and returned quickly, i.e. as a rule within one week.<P>
<P>
Negligence about written assignments is quickly pointed out.<P>

<P>
<B>Academics and educationalists</B><P>
At the start of their first year in an upper-secondary school or higher preparatory course, some students may find that their new teachers seem a bit distant and difficult to understand. <P>
<P>
However, at the same time the students appreciate having teachers with great academic knowledge and appreciate being treated as grown-up, responsible people. A good faculty finds an appropriate balance between distance and familiarity and delegates tasks in a way that utilizes the resources within it, which result from the make-up of the faculty as to gender and age, among other things.<P>

A good faculty knows its strong and its less strong points and delegates tasks accordingly, in the distribution of subjects and planning the timetable, as well as in other areas.<P>
<P>
In academic, professional terms, a good faculty is characterized by exchanges of ideas and experience, by participation in pedagogical activities, and by the confident sharing of successes and disasters with colleagues.<P>
<P>
Social life among colleagues is characterized by helpfulness, a sense of humour, and good fellowship, in the individual departments as well as in the faculty as a whole.<P>

<h3><a name="teacher">A Good Teacher</a></h3></B><P>
<P>
<B>A teacher's personality</B><P>
A teacher uses his/her entire personality when teaching, and the fundamental differences between teachers are probably related more to their different personalities than their different methods of teaching. It is a positive quality for students to encounter teachers who do their jobs in different ways and who are willing to give the students varying degrees of critical response.<P>
<P>
The purpose of the instruction is not, of course, to convince the students that the teacher's personal views are right; it is the subject matter that is central. But, for the teacher as well, it is a fact that the best instruction arises when the teacher is genuinely interested in what is being worked on. <P>
<P>
The objective communication of subject matter is no guarantee for good teaching, whereas all-round, open-minded discussions may be the key. As long as the inviolability of the students' private sphere is respected, the teacher must be able to act and react as the person he or she is, in the same way as the students each set their mark on the instruction.<P>
<P>
Academic qualifications are not in themselves sufficient for creating a good teacher. A teacher's instruction can be prepared by advice and guidance, and one can learn a certain pedagogical technique. But not everyone is cut out to be a good teacher for life. Teaching requires talent. Thus there are teachers who fail despite considerable academic knowledge.<P>
<P>
The Department's school visits have shown that students attach importance to the following (in the order given):<P>
<P>
     -	the teacher's personal characteristics<P>
     -	the teacher's academic proficiency<P>
     - 	the teacher's pedagogical ingenuity and ability to vary the instruction<P>
     -	the teacher's preparation and completion of the individual lesson<P>
     -	the teacher's ability to incorporate the 
	class's other subjects<P>
     - 	the teacher's involvement (in non-academic matters as well)<P>

<a name="service"><h3>In-Service Training for Teachers</h3></a><P>
<P>
<B>Subject-specific and pedagogical development</B><P>
Upper-secondary and higher preparatory teachers have an academic education that ensures that the instruction is of a high standard. As a result of their education they are able to keep up with developments in their own subjects and are able to acquaint themselves with related subject areas.<P>
<P>
The original degree course, along with the ensuing course in practical pedagogy, is the basis for teacher's entire career. But academic qualifications need to be maintained; this can be done in various ways. There are always short courses, and in connection with new subjects and subjects at new levels, in-service training is offered.<P>
<P>
A considerable portion of a teacher's working hours are spent getting acquainted with new subject matter, keeping up with a subject and preparing instruction. This division of working time means that a great deal is left to the individual teachers to attend to the subject-specific and pedagogical maintenance of their educations, for instance in a network of colleagues from other schools and at regional courses.<P>
                                  <P>
<P>
<B>In-service training courses</B><P>
The Ministry of Education normally subsidizes the following kinds of courses and meetings on 
subject-specific and pedagogical topics:<P>
<P>
Two- to three-day residential courses for colleagues from the whole country, at which a topic is dealt with from several points of view, alternating between presentations by people not on the course and contributions to discussion by the participants themselves.<P>
<P>
Regional one-day meetings. The teachers' organizations for a single subject may, for example, offer a series of meetings on a topic over the course of half a year.<P>
<P>
One-, two- or three- week residential courses or study trips abroad during a school holiday (usually in July and August), often paid for by the teacher to a great extent.<P>
<P>
It is valuable if the teachers' in-service training can be linked to some experimental project at their schools.<P>
<P>
<I><P><hr>
<h3>SIGNS OF QUALITY</h3><P>
<b>In-Service Training<P>
</B><P>
In collaboration with the teachers, the principal has decided on the priorities for in-service training within the school's budget and set down principles for allocating funds. Consideration of the whole faculty's need for in-service training carries greater weight than the individual teacher's spontaneous wish to take a course.<P>
<P>
The school's administration ensures that funds for in-service training are spent as well as possible, for instance, by encouraging teachers who ordinarily would not apply for a course to do so.<P>
<P>
Teachers who have participated in residential courses, for instance, pass on their impressions and course material to colleagues.<P>
<P>
Suggestions for allocating funds for in-service training are made by the teachers, but the final decision as to who is given the funds is made by the principal as part of his/her responsibility for pedagogical leadership.<P><hr>
</I><P>
<P>

<a name="class"><h3>A Good Class</h3></a><P>
<P>
Even though the school divides new students to achieve a suitable distribution as regards gender and school background, classes can turn out surprisingly differently: everyone who teaches knows the concept of &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; classes. A &quot;bad&quot; class can mean that the students will have a less satisfactory school experience than they might have had individually in another class. On the other hand a &quot;good&quot; class can help weak students along, students that might otherwise have dropped out.<P>
<P>
There is no reason to give up in advance on improving the attitudes towards work and the general atmosphere of a class. The teachers of a class can, together and with the support of the principal, identify the sources of a &quot;bad&quot; class's negative attitudes, speak to the individuals and make an agreement with the class on a change of behaviour. <P>

<P>
Students in the class take their opportunities to influence decision making seriously, choose a student council representative and use him or her as a link to the governing bodies of the school.<P>
<P>
In a good class a chance to work in peace and being in good spirits are not contradictory.<P>
</I><P>
<P><hr>
<a name="student"><h3>A Good Student</h3></a><P>
<P>
<B>Interplay</B><P>
Successful instruction is based on interplay between interesting subject matter, an academically sound teacher and students who make an effort to acquire knowledge, are willing to present arguments for their points of view, and who take responsibility for their part of the educational and learning process. A good student is not synonymous with a proficient student, but rather with a student who wants to become more proficient. From a teacher's point of view, the student who always performs at top level is not a better student than one who makes perceptible progress from an average level.<P>
<P>
The double goals of the upper-secondary school and the higher preparatory course, i.e. education for further study as well as a general education, create a tension between subject and pedagogy, which makes it a great and satisfying challenge for most students to encounter the school's requirements and the social and academic activities it can offer. <P>
<P>
The instruction is carried out by teachers with a university degree. This means that the students rarely have the same teacher in more than one subject, and that they encounter more kinds of technical language and more abstract words than they have been accustomed to. In addition it is expected that the students will manage their preparation and their efforts themselves. This requires that the students take responsibility for making the instruction succeed.<P>

<a name="lesson"><h3>A Good Lesson</h3></a><P>
<P>
Varied forms of instruction</B><P>
Good class instruction is characterized by lively dialogue. Starting with the students' own world,   the dialogue on the subject matter evolves in such a way that customary ideas and new views become the object of debate - resulting in new perception. A candid and open-minded atmosphere in the class is important in making it possible for students to express themselves with confidence on subject-specific as well as general matters.<P>
<P>
&quot;Chairing&quot; the classroom dialogue, the teacher has a particular responsibility to create continuity, i.e. to ensure linkage back to previously achieved insight and ahead to the goals of the instruction.<P>
<P>
A good lesson can also be planned as experimental work, group work, alternation between class work and pair work, problem solving, etc. What is crucial is the intensity of what takes place and whether the format of the instruction is varied according to the type of subject matter, the students' background and the situation in general: It is vital that the teacher seizes a pedagogical opportunity now and then and deviates from the plan, by using a current event, for instance, as a starting point.<P>

In the instruction, formats that suit the subject matter are employed. The students are activated individually, in pairs or in larger groups so that in connection with projects, for example, they take part of the responsibility for the progress and the content of the instruction.<P>
<P>
All students, whether good, average or mediocre, receive assignments that suit their academic backgrounds and at the same time make new demands of them.<P>

<h3><a name="assess">Assessment and Differentiation</a></h3><P>
<P>
<B>Differentiation of instruction</B><P>
Well-organized instruction offers the students challenges and introduces the subject at a reasonable pace. The interplay between the teacher and the various groups of students, and between the students themselves, can open up new perspectives that the individual student would not have seen otherwise. Individualized instruction, therefore, is not always the most expedient means of increasing what the individual student gets out of the instruction. <P>
<P>
The best thing is to make use of formats of instruction that allow the teacher as well as the individual student to make varied contributions to the joint work of a class: at times the teacher is the one who listens, and one or more students analyse, discuss or summarize. At times it is the other way round. Differentiation of instruction is not just the teacher using various teaching materials to drive each student consistently towards the degree of attainment that the teacher thinks the student capable of.<P>
<P>
Experimental work is well-suited to differentiating the instruction. Various students can attack an experimental problem in vastly different ways and with varying degrees of understanding.<P>
<P>
The school can support the individual student's planning and completing of written as well as oral homework so that demands are made that suit the various students' backgrounds.<P>
<P>
Students can work individually at home and at school with handbooks, computers or other aids. It is the teacher's job to contribute to what the individual student gets out of the instruction and to attaining the goals of the subject by constantly having differentiated material and topics ready.<P>
<P>
<B>Marking and continuous assessment</B><P>
In the upper-secondary school and in the higher preparatory course, there is a long tradition of being interested in the external assessment of the student's knowledge and skills at the conclusion of the course of study. On the other hand, methods that make it possible for the students to measure and evaluate what they are getting out of their own learning process on a regular basis are less widespread.  The same is true to a certain extent of students' and teachers' evaluation of the instruction. Systematic (self-) evaluation of instruction is not a widespread phenomenon, but it is gradually finding favour as a useful supplement to traditional marking.<P>
<P>
According to the regulations, students in the higher preparatory course and the upper-secondary school must be informed regularly about their level of attainment. In the same way, teachers are obliged to discuss the instruction with the students. In the upper-secondary school the student's level of attainment is expressed in a mark. It is up to the schools to decide how to put these regulations into practice.<P>
<P>
The marks that are given are absolute. This means that the students' level of attainment must not be assessed in relation to each other, but in relation to a number of fixed criteria for what one must achieve to get a given mark.<P>
<P>
With restrictions on intake in higher education, interest in marks has increased drastically, with a corresponding obligation on the part of teachers to be meticulous in their assessment: consult the Ministry's guidelines for external examiners, discuss assessment with colleagues in the department and give reasons for marks to each individual student.<P>
<P>
Meticulous and well-founded marking with colleagues' agreement on the criteria is also a good means of ensuring that students and parents understand and accept the marks that are given.<P>

The school's departments have discussed the consequences of absolute marking and through discussing the guidelines for external examiners, exchanging scripts, assessing one another's mock exams, etc., have reached a consensus on marking.<P>
<P>
In addition to assignments for a whole class, students are occasionally given individual assignments (experimental, written or oral) with subsequent collective and individual guidance.<P>
<P>
The teacher, in collaboration with the students, sets up clear goals not just for the long term, but also for shorter teaching units, and parts of the subject content - in some cases perhaps for a single lesson.<P>
<P>
The instruction is discussed regularly by the teacher and the students so that both parties' responsibility for getting something out of it is clear. The teacher must also be able to allow his/her part of the effort to be evaluated by the students and be willing to discuss the choice of format for instruction, teaching materials and methods, etc., with them.<P>
<P>
Regular evaluation takes place in a secure atmosphere which has a purpose and according to a procedure previously agreed upon by the teacher and students.<P><hr>
</I><a name="coherence"><h3>Coherence and Co-ordination</h3><P></a> 
<P>
<B>Co-operation between subjects</B><P>
The content and the working methods of the individual subjects are the main thing in upper-secondary and higher preparatory education. However, one essential criterion for good general education is that the students do not always experience the subjects one at a time, but also have an opportunity to see the individual subjects as parts of a greater whole. The ideal is that the course of instruction, over two or three years respectively, constitutes a whole: The regulations for the upper-secondary school and for the higher preparatory course require that the instruction be organized so that the subjects support each other.<P>
Various kinds of co-operation between teachers can contribute to students' being better able to see the connections in the subject matter: common use of terminology and symbols in related subjects, studying the same topic in two subjects simultaneously, joint study of a theme and other forms of co-operation between subjects, e.g. concerning written and oral assignments or having teachers sit in on one another's lessons. The same is true of the teachers' co-operation on marking and assessment in subjects with written work.<P>
<P>
Instruction in the individual classes must be co-ordinated in order to ensure an appropriate distribution of the students' workload. Of course, there are often genuine practical difficulties involved in carrying out this kind of co-ordination, however, it can be done. For example, a plan is necessary for the giving in of students' written assignments, taking into account various other events at the school, in order for students and teachers to be able to put their work into perspective and to distribute it.<P>

<P>
<B>Non-hierarchical schools</B><P>
It is characteristic of Danish schools that they are non-hierarchical institutions, in which only one person has the authority and the responsibility of leadership. This structure means that all employees, of necessity, have an obligation to take responsibility and tasks upon themselves that in schools in most other countries would be delegated to a kind of middle management with specific jobs and titles (e.g.&quot;head of department&quot; or &quot;senior teacher&quot;).<P>
<P>
The principal is the central person at at a school by virtue of being responsible to the authorities (county and state), as well as to students and employees of the school. The principal prioritizes, delegates, co-operates and disseminates. With knowledge of the functions and resources of the school and by virtue of his/her personal credibility, he or she stands as the guarantee of the quality of the school.<P>
<P>
Thus, the principal has final responsibility for allocating teachers to subjects and classes, making use of subject-specific and pedagogical considerations, including the teachers' own wishes.<P>
<P>
The framework for instruction is set down by the Ministry of Education, and the school's economic framework is determined by the authority in charge of the school. Within these frameworks the school sets up its goals. It is the principal's job to ensure that they are clear to students and parents. Not simply as an avowed intention, but as daily practice that is supported by the school's employees.<P>
<P>
For this reason, among others, it is important for the principal to keep up with general discussions on society, culture and education and communicate new pedagogical thinking so that his or her own views are made apparent.<P>

The purpose of counselling on the choice of subjects, education and careers is to enable the students to make their own decisions on an objective and neutral basis. The counsellors give information about possible consequences of a student's choices, e.g. if the student applies for admission to higher education.<P>

</I><a name="physical"><h3>The Physical Setting</h3></a><P>
<P>
The standard of the buildings used by upper-secondary schools and higher preparatory courses in Denmark varies a great deal. One cannot reach any conclusions as to the educational quality of an institution based simply on the age of the building, its maintenance or decoration. Excellent instruction can take place, for example, in buildings that still bear the mark of decades of poor funding for maintenance, or in those built for an entirely different purpose.<P>
<P>
Many of the Danish upper-secondary schools that have been built in the last thirty years are some of the best architecture of the period, and they are decorated with sculptures and paintings that few other places of work can equal. These buildings, their aesthetic and equipment are an expression of the importance the local community has attached to schools and education during the period. The setting does not in itself guarantee the quality of what takes place in the building, of course, but the physical setting can show symptoms of possible problems at the school. Untidiness in a classroom, for example, or a store-room or a notice-board that has not been kept up to date can indicate that the distribution of responsibility is vague in other areas of the schools as well.
