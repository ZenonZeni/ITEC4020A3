<p align="center"><font color="#008000" size="7"><em><b>Growth
Stocks Report</b></em></font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="6"><b><img src="jazzy.gif"></b></font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="7">D</font><font size="3">on't be
fooled by the elegant simplicity of the Growth Stocks Report. As
you can see, it is clear, concise and easy to use. Yet it
generates enormous profits when followed correctly and with
proper discipline.<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Our <i>Alpha()-RSM System</i> is designed to
ferret out those stocks that have a high alpha as well as high relative
strength &amp; momentum. Alpha is that measure of the return that
is not explained by the general market. For example, if the S&amp;P500
has an average monthly return of 1.5% and a stock has an average
monthly return of 8.5%, then the stock has an alpha of 7%. This
7% is the excess return that the stock generates over the general
market.<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Once we have selected our list of 400 high
alpha stocks, we run them through our proprietary mathematical
models that rank them based on their relative strength and
momentum. We want to buy only those high alpha stocks that also
have high relative strength and are going up at the present time. We
have no interest in stocks that are going sideways, or worse, are
going down.<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The top 100 stocks are then presented in each
issue of the Growth Stocks Report. Their percent change over the
past 1, 3 , 6 and 12 months is also shown. Stocks from the top of
the list are added to the model portfolios as space becomes
available in them, i.e., when we sell some stocks. We do not necessarily
sell a stock in the model portfolio when it falls out of the top
100.<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Our research and computer analysis are designed
to select and choose growth stocks for at least a one month
period. Our system is not designed to trade intra-week or
inter-day. Remember, all the stocks on our Top 100 list are technically
very strong. <br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="3">We don't sell a stock based solely on a few
good or bad days of trading. Therefore, we will not issue a buy
or sell signal on individual stocks between issues. <br>
<br>
</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="6"><b>How Do I Start?<br>
<br>
</b></font></p>

<p><font size="3">Each portfolio is designed to provide a
different level of diversification ranging from 10 stocks to 40. Once
you have decided which level of diversification you wish to
follow, you can decide what to buy. As a new subscriber you have three
options when you start building your portfolio.<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>1.</b> The aggressive option is to go ahead
and buy all stocks in your selected model portfolio at their current
prices. This way you'll be fully invested instantly. Even though
some of these stocks may be up 100-200% since we bought them, it doesn't
mean that they cannot go up another 100% or more from these
levels.<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>2.</b> The more conservative option is to
buy only those stocks that have a new buy recommendation for that
month and leave the rest of your portfolio in cash. This way,
it'll take you a few months to get fully invested, but you'll be
buying each stock at the most appropriate time and price.<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>3.</b> If you decide not to follow one of
our model portfolios, you may use this list of 100 most attractive stocks
to pick and choose and build your own personal portfolio. <i><u>One</u></i><i>
strategy</i> is to buy stocks that appear close to the top of
that list. Hold a stock as long as it in the list of 100. When a stock
drops out of the list, sell it and then buy again from the top of
the list. This is just <u>one</u> way of using the list. You may
prefer to use it differently and tailor it to suit your personal taste.<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="3">For each portfolio, the number of shares is
listed next to each stock. Because we are perpetuating a portfolio,
you should adjust the number of shares to accommodate your
personal portfolio. When first starting, is preferable to invest equal
dollar amounts into each of your new buys rather than overweighting
any one particular issue. When you get the next issue of the <i>Growth
Stocks Report</i>, check your selected model portfolio. You'll
notice that the new sells and new buys in each issue are highlighted
in <i>italics</i>. Sell a stock when a sell signal is given. Then
purchase the new recommendation. It is as simple as that.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="5"><b>Set Realistic Expectations -
Discipline Is Your Key To Success<br>
<br>
</b></font></p>

<p><font size="3">Can we expect 100% plus returns every year. It
would be great, but it just isn't realistic. In fact 100% returns
happen once only 4 or 5 years. We don't know when that is going
to happen. That is why we need to fully invested in the best high-alpha,
high-RSM growth stocks.<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Many investors, particularly those with less
than 5 years experience with their own money in the market, have unrealistically
high expectations regarding returns. This is perhaps the biggest
source of frustration for newer investors. Over a 10-year period,
stocks will be up only about 65 percent of the time on average.
The rest of the days are spent drifting sideways or falling.
These negative periods can last months or even years. The good
news is that our Alpha()-RSM System can find the best stocks even
when the general stock is going down.<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Successful investing requires a mental
determination and emotional commitment to stay invested for at least
one market cycle, which usually lasts four to six years. Often
investors lack the stamina to hold out through high period of
volatility. They bail out, usually at the worst possible moment, forgetting
that the extraordinary returns generated by small-cap stocks will
eventually compensate them for the risk or volatility.<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Please remember ... <i>patience and discipline</i>
are the two most important cornerstones of successful investing.
Don't expect miracles or think you'll get rich overnight. Also,
don't let the day to day market volatility and ups and downs bother
you. That is all part of investing in the stock market. Focus on
the longer-term. Look at the bigger picture. Think where you want
to be 3, 5 or 10 years from now.<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Generally, the longer you can leave your money
in the market, the more risk you should be willing to take. You
also need a proven investment strategy. Without a plan, investors
often jump from one idea or philosophy to another.<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Jumping around from one investment program to
the next can be detrimental to your wealth building efforts. Once
you have found a good system, like the <i>Growth Stocks Report</i>,
try it for at least 2-3 years before passing judgment on it.<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Don't expect to make money each and every
month. When faced with the inevitable down periods, don't lose
patience and throw in the towel. Hang in there. Wait for the
right opportunities, because sooner or later, they will surely
come. We at Growth Stocks Report hope to make your investing profitable
and enjoyable.</font> </p>

<p align="center"><font size="4"><b>Frequently Asked Questions
about the Growth Stocks Report<br>
</b></font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Q. When is the newsletter published?</b></font> </p>

<p><font size="3">A. The Growth Stocks Report is published by the
5th of every month. The prices in the newsletter are as of the
last business day of the previous month. We finish our analysis
by the 4th of the month, and then the newsletter is faxed or mailed
by the 5th. Like any other monthly service, there will always be
a lag of 4-5 days from last months close. In fact, some of the
time this lag may work in your favor.<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Q. Is there a telephone hotline?</b></font> </p>

<p><font size="3">A. Yes, we have a telephone hotline that is
updated by the 5th of every month. This hotline was established
so that we may be able to bypass mail delays. It contains our
list of top 10 stocks for the month and any new buys or sells for
each of the model portfolio. A second hotline has been added to provide
informational updates on stocks that have had significant moves
either up or down. This second hotline is updated weekly by 9 am
every Monday. Both hotlines were included on a brightly colored
card included with your kit and are available 24 hours a day,
seven days a week.<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Q. Do I buy at the market or at the price
listed in the newsletter?</b></font> </p>

<p><font size="3">A. When you get the newsletter via mail or FAX,
and decide to buy a stock, just buy it at the market. In some
cases you will get a worse fill than the price listed in the
newsletter and in other cases you will get a better fill. Over
time, your fills should average out. A good rule of thumb to follow
is to not purchase a stock 30% higher than our buy price and to not
buy it 30% lower than our buy price.<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Q. Do you use stops or time the market?</b></font> </p>

<p><font size="3">A. No market timing or stops are used in the
Growth Stocks Report. All portfolios remain fully invested 100%
of the time. If you wish to use stops, you must be responsible
for determining at what price you wish to implement them. These
stops would be based upon your own personal tolerance for risk.<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Q. How do you select stocks?</b></font> </p>

<p><font size="3">A. Our stock selection process incorporates
both fundamental and technical criteria. Every month, we screen
thousands of stocks looking for the handful that have the
potential for spectacular stock price increases. We are we
looking for emerging companies poised for enormous growth or established ones
that are about to make major advances. We want companies whose
products are in such demand that they can't make them fast
enough. Ones with entrepreneurial leadership that is taking advantage
of technological breakthroughs to create new, super-fast growing
businesses. And we want to find them before they're discovered by
the financial media and hordes of investors. So we can buy them ahead
of the pack and take full advantage of the run-up in their
stocks. We set very strict risk/reward guidelines and whittle the
possibilities down to a handful of companies with superior balance
sheets and liquidity and little or no debt. Then we take this
short list and subject it to a rigorous proprietary system based
on cutting-edge computerized technical analysis. This system ranks
the stocks according to their short-term momentum and relative
strength. We list the top 100 in every issue of the Growth Stocks
Report and when there is space, we add the ones at the top of this
list to our model portfolios.<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Q. Are these stocks risky?</b></font> </p>

<p><font size="3">A. On an individual stock basis, these
small-cap stocks are quite volatile and most people would characterize
them as being very risky. <u>That is why you must diversify over
at least 10-15 stocks, preferably more</u>. If you have 15 stocks
in your portfolio and if four of them lose 25% each, your total portfolio
loss is only 6.66%. Furthermore, its quite possible that some of
the other stocks in the portfolio will go up thereby making up
for the small loss. That is why it is imperative that you diversify your
holdings over a number a stocks.<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Q. My stock is down 5 points in 2 days. Are
you going to sell the stock?</b></font> </p>

<p><font size="3">A. We don't sell a stock based solely on a few
good or bad days of trading. Therefore, we will not issue a buy
or sell signal on individual stocks between issues. Our research
and computer analysis are designed to select and choose growth
stocks for at least a one month period. Our system is not designed
to trade intra-week or inter-day. Remember, all the stocks on our
Top 100 list are technically very strong.<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Q. My stock is up 250%. Should I take
profits and sell?</b></font> </p>

<p><font size="3">A. No. Wait till the next issue comes out. If
we deem it to be a sell, it'll be sold. But till we ask you to sell
it, don't sell just because it is up substantially.<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Q. A certain stock is down 4 points. Are you
still recommending it?</b></font> </p>

<p><font size="3">A. Yes. Recommendations on a stock can only
change once a month. If a stock is not rated a sell, then it is
rated a buy.<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Q. As a new subscriber, should I buy all the
stocks in my chosen portfolio, or should I go with only the new buys?</b></font> </p>

<p><font size="3">A. Either strategy if fine. The aggressive
option is to go ahead and buy all stocks in your selected model
portfolio at their current prices. This way you'll be fully
invested instantly. Even though some of these stocks may be up
100-200% since we bought them, it doesn't mean that they cannot
go up another 100% or more from these levels. The more conservative
option is to buy only those stocks that have a new buy
recommendation for that month and leave the rest of your
portfolio in cash. This way, it'll take you a few months to get
fully invested. Just make sure that you divide your portfolio in the
right proportion. For example, if you are following the $75000
model portfolio and there are 3 new buys this month, then you
will buy $5000 worth of each of these stocks (total $15000) and leave
the rest of the $60000 in cash.<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Q. Why are you recommending or buying XYZ
stock?</b></font> </p>

<p><font size="3">A. The answer to a question like this is always
the same -- &quot;because our computer models rank it as an
excellent buy at this time&quot;.<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Q. How do I use the list of top 100 stocks
ranked in order of attractiveness based on relative strength?</b></font> </p>

<p><font size="3">A. If you decide <u>not</u> to follow one of
our model portfolios, you may use the list of 100 most attractive stocks
to pick and choose and build your own personal portfolio. <u>One</u>
strategy is to buy stocks that appear close to the top of that
list. Hold a stock as long as it in the list of 100. When a stock
drops out of the list, sell it and then buy again from the top of the
list. This is just <u>one way</u> of using the list. You may
prefer to use it differently and tailor it to suit your personal
taste.<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Q. A stock does not appear in the list of
top 100. Why are you are still holding it in the model portfolio?</b></font> </p>

<p><font size="3">A. We do not necessarily sell a stock in the
model portfolio when it falls out of the top 100. Our sell discipline
is such that we only sell a stock when it falls into the lower
half of our rankings. Remember, the ranking provided in the newsletter
is only a partial listing of approximately 400 stocks we rank. <br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Q. The 1, 3, 6 and 12 month % change in the
list of top 100 stocks is projected or actual?</b></font> </p>

<p><font size="3">A. That is the actual % change for each stock
in the last 21, 63, 126 and 252 trading days.<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Q. I expect the market to have a correction.
Should I sell my stocks?</b></font> </p>

<p><font size="3">A. Since we are not trying to time the market
and have a long-term time horizon (5 years or more), we intend to
remain fully invested at all times. The stocks in our rankings
and model portfolios are very strong both fundamentally and technically.
Even if they do go down with the general market, they are also
likely to rebound faster.<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Q. What other services do you provide?</b></font> </p>

<p><font size="3">A. We provide newsletter services with the <i>Growth
Stocks Report</i> and <i>Mutual Fund Bulletin (MFB)</i>. The <i>MFB</i> seeks
to provide magnificent market timing to dramatically reduce risk
while earning spectacular returns with mutual funds. Our sister
companies, <i>Select Sector Research Management (SSRM)</i> and <i>Saxena
Capital Management (SCM),</i> offer professional money management
services. <i>SSRM</i> manages individual commodities accounts and <i>SCM</i> manages
a hedge fund called the Index Timing Fund, LP. Please call if you
have an interest in any of the above services.<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Q. Can I call you with questions?</b></font> </p>

<ol>
    <li><font size="3"><i>We are not in a position to give
        individualized investment advice.</i> Everything you need
        to know is contained in the newsletter. The purpose of
        the newsletter is tell you what to buy, when to buy and
        when to sell. The newsletter subscription price does not
        include telephone consultation. We would like to spend
        our time researching new investment opportunities rather than
        answering questions that pertain to just one individual.
        You should consult a financial planner for your specific
        needs. However, if you have a question of a general
        nature that other people may also be interested in,
        please write or fax it to us and we will try to answer it
        in subsequent issues of the newsletter.</font> </li>
