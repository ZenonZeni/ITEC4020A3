<SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=15>A probation hearing for a Waterloo man who could go to prison for using marijuana for medicinal purposes has been delayed.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=15>Allen Helmers, 48, had been scheduled to be in Black Hawk County District Court Monday.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=15>His attorney, Tom Frerichs of Waterloo, said a new date has not been set.&nbsp;  It is the second time the hearing has been pushed back.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=15>Helmers has said he believes marijuana is the safest way to relieve pain caused by fibromyalgia syndrome, a disease that attacks the body's soft tissue.&nbsp;  The cause is unknown and there is no cure.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=15>Helmers has already been sentenced to two five-year suspended prison sentences and $1,800 in fines stemming from a police search of his home that uncovered about three ounces of marijuana.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=15>He was also placed on two to five years of supervised probation, including periodic urine tests.&nbsp;  Because he has continued using marijuana, the probation could be revoked and a prison term could be imposed.
