<center><p><b>The Compassionate Use Act of 1996</b> </p></center>

<p><b>INITIATIVE MEASURE TO BE SUBMITTED DIRECTLY TO THE VOTERS
<br>MEDICAL USE OF MARIJUANA. INITIATIVE STATUTE.
<br>
<br></b>Provides that patients or defined caregivers, who possess or cultivate
marijuana for medical treatment recommended by a physician, are exempt
from general provisions of law which otherwise prohibit possession or cultivation
of marijuana. Provides physicians shall not be punished or denied any right
or privilege for recommending marijuana to a patient for medical purposes.
Declares that the measure not be construed to supersede prohibitions of
conduct endangering others nor to condone diversion of marijuana for nonmedical
purposes. Contains severability clause. Summary of estimate by Legislative
Analyst and Director of Finance of fiscal impact on state and local government:
Because this measure restricts the use of marijuana to only those persons
for whom it is prescribed by a licensed physician, it would probably have
no significant state or local fiscal impact.
<br>
<br>To The Honorable Secretary Of State Of California:
<br>We, the undersigned, registered, qualified voters of California, residents
of __________________________County (or City and County), hereby propose
an addition to the Health and Safety Code, relating to the compassionate
use of marijuana, and petition the Secretary of State to submit the same
to the voters of California for their adoption or rejection at the next
succeeding general election or at any special statewide election held prior
to that general election or otherwise provided by law. The proposed addition
to the Health and Safety code shall read as follows:
<br>Section 1. Section 11362.5 is added to the Health and Safety Code,
to read:
<br>11362.5. (a) This section shall be known and may be cited as the Compassionate
Use Act of 1996.
<br>(b) (l) The people of the State of California hereby find and declare
that the purposes of the Compassionate Use Act of 1996 are as follows:
<br>(A) To ensure that seriously ill Californians have the right to obtain
and use marijuana for medical purposes where that medical use is deemed
appropriate and has been recommended by a physician who has determined
that the person's health would benefit from the use of marijuana in the
treatment of cancer, anorexia, AIDS, chronic pain, spasticity, glaucoma,
arthritis, migraine, or any other illness for which marijuana provides
relief.
<br>(B) To ensure that patients and their primary caregivers who obtain
and use marijuana for medical purposes upon the recommendation of a physician
are not subject to criminal prosecution or sanction.
<br>(C) To encourage the federal and state governments to implement a plan
to provide for the safe and affordable distribution of marijuana to all
patients in medical need of marijuana.
<br>(2) Nothing in this act shall be construed to supersede legislation
prohibiting persons from engaging in conduct that endangers others, nor
to condone the diversion of marijuana for nonmedical purposes.
<br>(c) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no physician in this
state shall be punished, or denied any right or privilege, for having recommended
marijuana to a patient for medical purposes.
<br>(d) Section 11357, relating to the possession of marijuana, and Section
11358, relating to the cultivation of marijuana, shall not apply to a patient,
or to a patient's primary caregiver, who possesses or cultivates marijuana
for the personal medical purposes of the patient upon the written or oral
recommendation or approval of a physician.
<br>(e) For the purposes of this section, &quot;primary caregiver&quot;
means the individual designated by the person exempted under this act who
has consistently assumed responsibility for the housing, health, or safety
of that person.
<br>Sec. 2. If any provision of this measure or the application thereof
to any person or circumstance is held invalid, that invalidity shall not
affect other provisions or applications of the measure which can be given
effect without the invalid provision or application, and to this end the
provisions of this measure are severable.</p>
