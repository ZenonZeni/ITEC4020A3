<h1>How to Write Letters to the Editor</h1>

<p> A personal note by Cliff Schaffer: </p>

<p> Over the years, I have written a lot of letters to the editor
and about three out of four of them get published. A lot of
people have asked me what are the good techniques for writing
letters to the editor. The first thing I tell people is to
remember that they fit about ten letters in a typical editorial
section (out of the hundreds they receive) so the ones they
publish either: </p>

<p> 1) Are the best single expressions of what many people said. </p>

<p> 2) Make some point exceedingly well. </p>

<p> 3) Are signed by some prominent person. </p>

<p> In all cases, the letters are usually short and to the point,
and the editors have edited them even further to make them
shorter. Most people who write letters to the editor would
probably like the satisfaction you get when you see your letter
published. That way, at least you are certain that they read it.
However, it is also apparent that the media can be influenced by
letters they do not acknowledge. We have found many times that a
simple letter to someone in the media wound up in major media
coverage weeks or months later. </p>

<p> I was going to write up a formal set of rules for how to
write letters to the editor, but I found someone who had done it
already. He did quite a good job in saying the same essential
things I would have said. </p>

<p> =================================== </p>

<p> How to Write Letters to the Editor by Richard Rider </p>

<p> Short, concise letters are always more likely to be published
than long, meandering ones; try to keep them under 150 words. The
longer letters are also more likely to be edited. It's better
that you do your own editing. </p>

<p> Ever notice how you read letters to the editor in the paper?
Most people read the shorter letters first and then perhaps later
read the longer ones. Thus your shorter letter has a better
chance of being read. </p>

<p> WHAT TO WRITE? Unlike single-issue or special-interest
groups, libertarians can select from an enormous range of
subjects. Replying to editorials, agree or disagree, is very
effective. </p>

<p> Every day the news offers us all too many topics on which to
comment. </p>

<p> Be timely; try to respond within two or three days of the
article's publication. Pick an issue of particular importance to
you - don't be afraid to let some passion show through. </p>

<p> Here are some stylistic considerations: </p>

<p> 1. State the argument you're rebutting or responding to, as
briefly as possible, in the letter's introduction. Don't do a
lengthy rehash; it's a waste of valuable space and boring to
boot. </p>

<p> 2. Stick to a single subject. Deal with one issue per letter.
</p>

<p> 3. Don't be shrill or abusive. Editors tend to discard
letters containing personal attacks. Even though you're dying to
call Jesse Jackson a preachy parasite, stifle the urge. </p>

<p> 4. Your letter should be logically organized. First a brief
recitation of the argument you are opposing, followed by a
statement of your own position. Then present your evidence. Close
with a short restatement of your position or a pithy comment </p>

<p> (&quot;Jimmy Breslin says possession of firearms should be
limited to law enforcement officers. I say when only the police
have guns, the police state is just around the corner.&quot;). </p>

<p> 5. Use facts, figures and expert testimony whenever possible.
This raises your letters above the &quot;sez you, sez me&quot;
category. For instance: &quot;Anthony Lewis calls for taxing the
rich as a way to balance the budget. Is he aware of the fact that
if we confiscated the entire income of the top wage earners in
this country (those with income above $200,000), this would run
the federal government for exactly 8 days?&quot; </p>

<p> Readers respect the opinions of people with special knowledge
or expertise. Use expert testimony to bolster your case
(&quot;George Will claims we need to draft to defend America. But
General Edward C. Meyer, Army Chief of Staff, recently stated . .
.&quot;). </p>

<p> 6. Proofread your letter carefully for errors in spelling,
punctuation and grammar. Newspapers will usually edit to correct
these mistakes, but your piece is more likely to be published if
it is &quot;clean&quot; to begin with. Read your letter to a
friend, for objective input. </p>

<p> One suggestion is that a letter shouldn't be mailed the same
day it is written. Write, proofread and edit the piece. Then put
it aside until the next day. Rereading your letter in a fresh
light often helps you to spot errors in reasoning, stilted
language and the like. On the other hand, don't let the letter
sit too long and lose it's timeliness. </p>

<p> 7. Try to view the letter from the reader's perspective. Will
the arguments make sense to someone without a special background
on this issue. Did you use technical terms not familiar to the
average reader? </p>

<ol>
    <li>Should your letter be typed? In this day and age,
        generally yes. Double or triple space the letter if it is
        short. For faxing purposes, we appreciate it if the
        letter is all on one page, so single spacing might be the
        only option available. </li>
    <li>Direct your missives to &quot;Letters to the
        Editor,&quot; or some similar sounding title. </li>
</ol>

<p> 10. Always include your name, address, day-time phone number
and signature. The papers will not publish this information, but
they may use it to verify that you wrote the letter. If we are
fax broadcasting your letter, do not put a date on it. We may
have to wait a day or two before broadcasting it out, depending
on how many letters are waiting for dissemination. </p>

<p> 11. Most important - WRITE! Do not try to do a perfect
letter. Just give it a good effort and send it off. Letter
writing is the one thing that any one of us can do on our own
without the need to work through a group. No committees are
necessary. Just do it! </p>

<p> Don't be discouraged if your letter isn't published. The
editor may have received more responses on that issue than he
feels he can handle. </p>

<p> If we are faxing your letter, you will almost certainly be
published somewhere. The only drawback is that we do not have a
good feedback system, so you may not know which of the papers
publish your letter, particularly the smaller ones. </p>
