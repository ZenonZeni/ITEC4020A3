<H1>Telecommunications</H1>
<P>
Melbourne is the hub of Australia's telecommunications industry,
with services equal to any in the world. They are cost-competitive
and reliable.
<P>
The City of Melbourne is fully cabled with optical fibre. A range
of
leading-edge and cost-effective business services are being
introduced with further development of the Integrated Services
Digital Network (ISDN).
<P>
Carriers are investing in networks to provide advanced broadband
and interactive services for business and residential customers.
<p>
Deregulation of the industry has stimulated innovation based on
technology, and competitive pricing for voice, data and video
communications.
<P>
The KPMG data shows that relative to other major centres in the
region, Melbourne is a particularly competitive location for
international telephone services, with call charges, both
international and domestic, comparing very advantageously with
other centres.

<em>
There are significant variations in the levels of major
non-call
related charges. Melbourne is a cost competitive location
on this
measure. Note: Non-call charges are a relatively small proportion
of
the annual telecommunications costs incurred by most businesses.
