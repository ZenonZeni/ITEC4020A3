Long-Term Prime Rate Up


   The long-term prime rate at long-term credit institutions,
including the Industrial Bank of Japan <8302>, is expected to
rise for the first time in four months.  IBJ will review trading
trends on interest-bearing debt and make its decision as early
as next week.  Implementation will follow soon after.  The Long-
Term Credit Bank of Japan <8303> and the Nippon Credit Bank
<8304> will likely follow suit.  The bank-to-bank gap on the
coupon rate for interest on interest-bearing debt will probably
remain.  At December- end, this was 1.7% at IBJ; 1.9% at LTCB;
and 2.05% at NCB.

Dai-Ichi Kangyo in Electronic Settlement


   In a first for Japanese banks, Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank <8311>
plans to establish a special section for fund settlements, in
response to the growing number of companies engaging in cross-
border, electronic data transfer.  As outlined in the bank's new
medium-term business plan, on which the bank will embark in
April this year, Dai-Ichi Kangyo will make electronic settlement
services the new pillar of its international network business.
If trials of electronic settlements on the bank's corporate
network succeed, the resulting service will help Dai-Ichi Kangyo
secure main bank status.  The bank may also team up with foreign
banks and data communication businesses.

Nov. Construction Equipment Shipments Down


   The Japan Construction Equipment Manufacturers Association
announced that November 1995 shipments of construction equipment
fell 9.4% YOY, to a value of 143,116 million yen, dropping for
the third consecutive month.  Of this figure, domestic shipments
decreased 10.0%, to 108,432 million yen, while exports fell
7.4%, to 34,684 million yen, as a result of increased overseas
production.  By product, shipments of hydraulic excavators
dipped 8.2% YOY, to 3,476 units, and shipments of mini-shovels
fell 6.5%, to 4,109 units.  However, demand for wheel loaders,
particularly smaller models, expanded 21.4%, to 1,671 units.
