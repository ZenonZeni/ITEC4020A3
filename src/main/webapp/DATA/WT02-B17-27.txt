     In 1993, Dr. Kamal was named Executive Director of the Research and


Development Center of General Motors Corporation, where he has been 
involved  in or

managed engineering R&D projects since 1957.  In his current capacity, 
he directs

seven departments conducting R&D in the areas of advanced engines and

transmissions, chassis systems, fuels and lubricants, electrical systems 
and

electronics, hybrid electric vehicle systems, and intelligent vehicle 
systems.  He has

also successfully demonstrated a number of advanced products, systems, 
and

computer-aided tools, and proposed and managed projects involving 
mathematical

models of numerous vehicle component functions.

professional

affiliations include the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, the 
Society of

Automotive Engineers, and the Engineering Society of Detroit.


<p>   The author or editor of a number of publications on fluid 
mechanics, structural

mechanics, acoustics, and other subjects related to applied research in 
automotive

engineering, Dr. Kamal received master's degrees in mechanical 
engineering and

engineering mechanics from the University of Michigan in 1958 and 1962, 
and a

doctorate in engineering mechanics from the same institution in 1965.
