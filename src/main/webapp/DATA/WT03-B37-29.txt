RAYMOND JAMES PLANS BIG BOOST FOR BANK SERVICES

In the financial equivalent of "man bites dog," Raymond James
Financial Inc. has underway a major thrust into traditional banking
services via its wholly owned bank, Raymond James Bank. The St. Petersburg-
based financial conglomerate will offer in February FDIC-insured products
like checking and savings accounts. And, in a few months the bank will
market home equity lines of credit, and, possibly, residential mortgages.
     If all goes well, the securities dealer's bank might become the
nation's largest virtual bank. Theresa Schefstad, the president and CEO of
Raymond James bank, promises to reach her market "telephonically and
electronically. Our objective is to provide consolidated financial services
so all their financial services can be received from our firm," she said.
     The bank's initial target market will be the company's hefty customer
base of some 300,000 securities clients. Raymond James actually has
400,000, but some of the accounts are linked and Schefstad preferred the
more conservative estimate of 300,000 to describe her potential customer
base.
     "We'll be able to offer our clients several product choices. We have
the FDIC option, our credit interest program (sweep account) option, and
the third is our Heritage mutual funds," Schefstad explained. The Heritage
funds are Raymond James' proprietary mutual funds.
     The company will continue its tradition of not incenting brokers to
sell proprietary products. "The compensation for our three options is
consistent for all three product options," Schefstad pointed out. In fact,
this compensation practice has worked to the detriment of the Heritage fund
family. Growth of its individual funds hasn't even come close to other
brokerage houses proprietary funds despite the company's nationwide branch
network.
     Schefstad claims that James is the only broker/dealer to wholly own a
full-service bank. Unlike other nonbanking companies, which must resort to
the "nonbank bank" strategy to get into the banking business, James
purchased the bank branches with a total deposit base of $12 million from
the Resolution Trust Co. In May, 1994 the company chartered the Raymond
James Bank FSB, which has a capability to operate in all 50 states. The
bank ended 1995 with approximately $162 million in assets and $136 million
in deposits.
     Over the past 20 months, Schefstad, the bank staff has been wrestling
with regulatory approvals, developing disclosure policies and integrating
the bank's systems into the Raymond James computer network.
     "Because of who owns us for everything we have done we obtained
regulatory approval. For example, when we developed our consolidated
statement we received approval (beforehand) of our disclosure policy and
separation of accounts," Schefstad said.
     The bank will maintain a physical branch office near its headquarters
in Florida. Schefstad envisions the remainder of the bank's efforts to take
place electronically, particularly through the nationwide automated teller
machine networks. Of course, deposit-taking via the ATM isn't yet possible
but Schefstad said the firm's brokerage clients are sophisticated enough to
understand and use direct-deposit options available through the automated
clearing house system.

OCC READIES INSURANCE EXAM ACTIVITIES

The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency is preparing for the day
when national banks receive insurance powers. The Washington-based
regulator has created a task force to consider how a national bank's
insurance activities should be supervised. The Comptroller has created the
task force in anticipation of Barnett Banks winning its landmark case
scheduled for this month in the U.S. Supreme Court. A win for Barnett is
generally interpreted as blanket permission for national banks to sell
insurance.
     "They (the OCC) are laying the groundwork for determining quickly how
national bank insurance activities should be supervised," said one banker
familiar with the OCC's secret task-force meetings. He said similar
meetings were held several years ago to discuss how the OCC should regulate
the sale of mutual funds by banks -- well before the OCC published its
guidelines.
     Under examination, sources said, are the issues of licensing for bank
employees and the development of either regulations or guidelines governing
insurance sales but not both. The difference is crucial. Violating
guidelines usually brings little more than a wrist-slapping to the
offending bank. Violating regulations brings down the whole panoply of
fines, dismissals, and bank takeovers.
     For example, violating an OCC cease-and-desist order can bring fines
up to $1 million daily against the banks as well as their officers and
directors.
     The Comptroller's Office decided to go ahead with the insurance
examination task force after meeting with representatives of the American
Bankers Association and the Bankers Roundtable. Attending the task force
sessions, sources said, were Konrad Alt, chief assistant to Comptroller
Eugene A. Ludwig, and General Counsel Julie Williams. The task force
reportedly is expected to decide its next steps -- still unclear -- by
today.
     The OCC task force is apparently a reaction to rumblings on Capitol
Hill where, reportedly, insurance industry lobbyists are telling members of
Congress that the Supreme Court ruling will not address the issues of
supervising and licensing bank insurance activities.
     Banking industry officials charge the insurance lobbyists are
indulging in "scare tactics" to influence Congress to answer the court
ruling with legislation that will brunt the effect of a win for Barnett.
The banking officials characterize the insurance lobbyists' concerns as
unwarranted. They further say the OCC is trying to be proactive to reassure
Congress that the OCC will continue to monitor, examine, and regulate all
national bank activities.
     "Indeed, this oversight would be considered suffocating by regular
insurance agents," a banking industry lobbyist said.
     Among the questions raised during the task force meetings, according
to a banker who attended, was the issue of whom the agency should consult
before putting the final touches on its insurance rules. Among those
suggested were state insurance commissioners and the banking and insurance
industry trade groups.

FED ALLOWS ANNUITY SALES IN SECTION 20 SUBSIDIARIES

The Federal Reserve Board will allow banks to consolidate their
annuity sales and brokerage activities under the terms of a no-action
letter the Fed published last month. The regulatory agency declined to name
the bank holding company receiving the permission.
     The newly permitted activity allows a bank to use its employees of a
nonbank subsidiary of the holding company, i.e., a Section 20 subsidiary,
to also sell annuities. The Fed's general counsel, Virgil Mattingly, signed
the letter which is an indication of the importance the letter had taken in
the eyes of the Fed staff and the Board of Governors.
     The no-action letter, dated December 6, establishes a format that
contemplates two forms of contracts. The first is a contract between a
third-party vendor and the Section 20 subsidiary. The other involves a
contractual lease of space between a vendor and the bank. The assumption of
the no-action letter is that the banking subsidiary of the holding company
can either engage in annuity sales under state law or can sell annuities
because it is a national bank.
     The particular format approved by the Fed works only if the bank
holding company uses a vendor offering brokerage services through the
Section 20, and the employees selling the annuities work for both the
Section 20 subsidiary and the third-party vendor.
     Some critics of the Fed's action charge that the arrangement is
convoluted and not as simple as the authority granted freely by the
Comptroller of the Currency. This is true. And a 14-year-old banking law is
the reason. There is a specific reference in the Garn-St Germain Act of
1982 barring annuity sales by holding companies. So, the Fed created the
convoluted annuity sales structure to accommodate the Garn-St Germain
restrictions.
     The Comptroller has already allowed dual employee relations for
national bank annuity sales. The structure is simpler for two reasons.
First, the Valic decision gives national banks the power to sell annuities
and, second, the incidental powers authority of the Comptroller makes it
easier for the regulator to authorize annuity sales.

KEYCORP PURSUES SMALL BUSINESS 401(K) PLANS

Add Cleveland's KeyCorp to the list of banks eyeing the hotly
contested small-business market for defined contribution plans. It appears
the entire banking industry has carved out this niche as a way to make
money and to further boost sales of bank proprietary mutual funds.
     In KeyCorp's case, the program consists of five Victory proprietary
mutual funds.
     KeyCorp will eventually market the product, dubbed PRISM Small
Business, nationwide to businesses with fewer than 100 employees. It will
start offering the system to businesses in Albany, Buffalo, Cincinnati,
Northern Indiana, and Syracuse. The heavy concentration of New York state
markets reflects the former headquarters of Key Bank before it merged with
Society Bank to form KeyCorp. The banking company markets its PRISM product
to large company 401(k) plans. KeyCorp developed PRISM in 1991 and claims
to serve more than 750 plans in 14 states with assets under management
totaling $4 billion.
     The market for small business 401(k) plans is expected to swell to
$199 billion by the end of the decade. In 1994 the market stood at $70
billion in plan assets, according to widely published research numbers.

TORONTO-DOMINION BREAKS NEW GROUND

In the U.S., the average bank mutual fund customer faces the quandary
of which funds to select in addition to the bank's proprietary fund. Not so
in Canada where, until recently, banks were allowed to sell only their own
proprietary funds clearly marked with the bank name. Now, Toronto- Dominion
Bank has received approval from several provincial securities commissioners
to sell other brand-name mutual funds in its 900-branch network throughout
Canada. Toronto-Dominion is the first Canadian bank to receive this power.
     Mark Wettlaufer, president of TD Asset Management (TDAM), also
announced that the bank was creating an asset-allocation account in which a
customer may accumulate not only the bank's Green Line No-Load mutual funds
but also the other funds the bank has received the power to sell.
     Investment advice will come from TDAM's portfolio managers; the bank's
discount brokerage company, Green Line Investor Services, will provide the
back-office execution.
     Last year, Toronto-Dominion announced the first of its expansion plans
in the U.S. with the opening of several Green Line investment centers
anchored by the company's office in New York. While the company would
specialize in servicing the Canadian investments of U.S. and Canadian
investors, it also aims to break into the competitive discount brokerage
market in the U.S.
     Wettlaufer said Green Line operates a sales force of 5,000 throughout
its branch network and has C$10 billion (roughly US$7.3 billion) in assets
under management

FIDELITY ADDS UNIT TRUSTS TO BANK OFFERINGS

Fidelity Investments has decided it's time the investing public at
banks had a shot at unit investment trusts. The Boston-based financial
behemoth has added a series of Fidelity-sponsored unit investment trusts to
its well-known line of Fidelity Advisor funds, the principal Fidelity funds
sold through banks.
     The funds come through Fidelity Capital Markets. The Fidelity unit
calls them Fidelity Defined Trusts. Fidelity Rolling Government Series
(FRoGS), will feature one short-term Treasury portfolio product and
Fidelity Laddered Government Series (FLaGS), will feature a short-term
Treasury portfolio product and a short/intermediate-term Treasury
portfolio.
     Fidelity Investments Institutional Services Company will offer all
three UITs as part of its Fidelity Advisor family of mutual funds sold
through investment professionals at brokerage firms, banks, and insurance
companies. Fidelity also will continue to make third-party UIT products
available to its retail and institutional customers.
     "UITs are a viable alternative for investors who want a fixed maturity
date and a maturity value in their fixed-income investments," said Tim
McKenna, executive vice president of Fidelity Capital Markets fixed-income
division.

Fixed, Unmanaged Treasury Portfolio
     While Fidelity mutual funds are managed by Fidelity Management &
Research Company, Defined Trusts are selected by Fidelity Capital Markets.
Fidelity's new FRoGS are designed to provide monthly income and
preservation of principal through a fixed and unmanaged portfolio of U.S.
Treasury securities.
     Maturities on FRoGS will be distributed in 25% increments every three
months over a one-year period beginning in March 1996.  Spreading the
return of principal over a period of time allows investors to increase
flexibility and minimize risk.
     Proceeds from maturing U.S. Treasury notes on FRoGS will be used to
repurchase an additional one year U.S. Treasury note.  Fidelity will "roll"
these distributions four times a year beginning in 1996 and ending in 1997.
The Trust will distribute principal in 25% increments in 1998.
     Treasury securities maturing every six months beginning in November
1996 and ending in November 1998.  The average maturity is about two years.
Series 2 consists of five short- and short-intermediate U.S Treasury
securities maturing every 12 months beginning in May 1996 and ending in May
2001.  The average maturity of the Series 2  FLaGS is approximately 3.5
years.

STEIN ROE PICKS NEW FUND NAME

Stein Roe Mutual Funds has renamed the Stein Roe Prime Equities Fund
the Stein Roe Growth & Income Fund effective the beginning of next month.
      "We believe the new name more accurately reflects the Fund's
investment philosophy by recognizing both its growth and income
components," said Tim Armour, president of Stein Roe Mutual Funds. The
fund's investment objective also will be revised to better reflect the
income mission of the fund.
     The revised objective will be to pursue both growth of capital and
current income. It is  designed for investors seeking a diversified
portfolio of securities that offers the opportunity for long-term growth of
capital while also pursuing a steady stream of income.
     The fund's investment strategy will remain the same, which is to
invest in well-established companies whose common stocks are believed to
have both the potential to appreciate in value and to pay dividends to
shareholders.
     The fund will continue to emphasize investments in equity securities
of companies having market capitalizations in excess of $1 billion.
Securities of these well-established companies are believed to be generally
less volatile than smaller companies.
     Founded in 1932, Stein Roe & Farnham is a Chicago-based investment
management firm. It provides professional investment management for
individuals and institutions and serves as investment adviser to the Stein
Roe family of 18 no-load mutual funds.

CALENDAR

With the winter storm still a very fresh memory in the minds of many
on the East Coast, two investment product groups have wisely opted to hold
their meetings in Palm Springs, CA. And it appears the popularity of the
site has caused at least one group to run out of rooms for the time being.
The Bank Securities Association's Tom Cote said the group is negotiating
with hotels in Palm Desert to cough up more rooms for the February 24-27
annual convention of the BSA.
     The meeting starts Saturday, February 24, with an address by Phil
Feigin, the securities commissioner for Colorado. Other featured speakers
are Robert Novak, a syndicated columnist and (invited) Rep. Sonny Bono, a
member of the House Banking Committee, and the former mayor of Palm
Springs. For the latest update on the meeting call the BSA at (415) 924-
8010.
     Starting six days before the BSA's meeting is the popular marketing
conference of the National Association for Variable Annuities. It'll be
held in a "suburb" of Palm Springs in La Quinta, CA. The exhibit area opens
on Sunday, February 18, but the real meeting starts the next day. The
conference runs through February 24, with concurrent sessions running each
morning. The keynote address comes from Robert Palmer, the California
insurance commissioner. So far, the lone banking representative speaking at
the meeting is Philip Corwin, the American Bankers Association's director
of operations and retail banking. For more information contact NAVA at
(703) 620-0674.

SUPERMARKET MUTUAL FUND SALES EXPECTED TO INCREASE

The supermarket banking trend appears to be maturing beyond plain
vanilla banking, according to a survey conducted by supermarket banking
consultants, National Commerce Bank Services in Memphis.
     The consulting company, a subsidiary of National Commerce Bancorp.,
also in Memphis, surveyed 800 shoppers in 20 states.
     "We've said for years that in-store banking was the wave of the
future. Well, the future has arrived," said Douglas W. Ferris, the
consulting company's president. What's more, he said, the number of
services shoppers want from their supermarket bank branches has increased.
"In the early days of in-store banking, customers used the branches for
withdrawals and deposits," Ferris said. This has clearly changed.
     For example, 40% of the survey's respondents said that sale of mutual
funds in the supermarket branches was important. Only a few banks operating
in-store branches offer investment products but this is likely to change as
the number of in-store branches continues to grow.
     Ferris' group estimates the number of in-store bank branches will grow
by 150% in four years. These branches, the consulting company said, will
play an increasingly import role in bank delivery systems.

ANGLIM JOINS FLAGSHIP AS NATIONAL SALES MANAGER

Phil Anglim has become the national sales manager of Flagship Funds,
effective immediately. Anglim had been a regional sales manager for the
company before this most recent promotion. He will administer the company's
15 regional sales vice presidents.
     This is almost a new position for Flagship, since Richard P. Davis,
the Flagship president, served as national sales manager since the
company's inception in 1984.
     The fund company, located in Dayton, OH, specializes in fixed-income
municipal securities. It has $4.5 billion in assets under management. It
previously had been the money management arm of Mead Corp. before Davis and
the current chairman, Bruce Bedford, led a management buyout.
