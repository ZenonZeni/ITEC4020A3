<H3><a name="Argonne">Argonne National Laboratory Scientists Win Tech 
Transfer Award</a></H3>

<P>

A group of Argonne National Laboratory researchers won a 1996 Federal 

Laboratory Consortium (FLC) Award for Excellence in Technology Transfer 
for 

developing an efficient new process for producing high-temperature 

superconductors. 

<P>

The FLC recognized Roger Poeppel, Jim Emerson, Stanley Johnson, and Balu 


Balachandran for their outstanding effort in transferring technology 
developed 

in the laboratory to outside partners.  The process efficiently removes 
the 

carbon dioxide formed during the preparation of high-temperature 

superconductors.  Carbon dioxide released during heating of the 
constituent 

salts reacts with the superconductor to form nonsuperconducting 
impurities 

that lower the current-carrying ability of the final product.  Compared 
to 

conventional methods, researchers can now make high-temperature 

superconductors in one-tenth the time and at forty percent the cost.  
The 

process also won a 1993 R&ampD 100 award from R&ampD Magazine as one of 
the 100 most 

significant technical products of the year.  The FLC is made up of 

representatives from federal laboratories, industry, academia and state 
and 

local governments.  The award will be presented to Argonne's winners at 
the 

FLC' s National Technology Transfer Meeting, May 6-9, 1996, in Seattle, 
WA.
