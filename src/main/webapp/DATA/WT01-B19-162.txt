<p><font size="4"><tt>Louv Brother Carl, </tt></font></p>

<p><DD><font size="4"><tt>First let me tell you that I did receive
both of your last packages and I did find the contents very
interesting, in fact that's just the kind of stuff that I've
wanted (I'm referring to the </tt></font><a href="../coptic.html"><font
size="4"><tt>literature</tt></font></a><font size="4"><tt> on the
brothers) because every time I try to explain to people how I
grew up it's hard for them to comprehend or relate to the full
picture of the spirit and mind set of the thing.&nbsp; Of course
they can all grasp and usually like the concept of smoking ganja
in Church but it's hard for them to understand (which was far more
important) the powerful spirit of louv and brotherhood that drew
the true brothers together.&nbsp; Even though everyone loved to
burn ganja that was not the main essence of the spirit, that just
intensified the spirit that was already there.&nbsp; I love to
burn herb and I know that you do too (we used to smoke it
together all the time) but that is not what makes us
brothers.&nbsp; What makes us brothers is that we care about and
try to uplift a fellow brother or sister in whatever little way
we can.&nbsp; Everyone might disagree on certain things but when
you can come together in unity and put aside your differences or compromise
on them I don't think that there is any greater feeling than that
and I believe that that was the essence of the brothers.&nbsp;
That spirit was even why the brothers were so successful in the
ganja movements, it's just sad that most of them carry bad
thought against or even hate each other now.&nbsp; Anyway, back
to the subject of trying to get people to try to understand the
kind of life that I grew up in, that's the reason why one time I
had asked you to send me some of the old pictures (since I know
that you were the main picture man) so that I could show them to people,
but I remember that you told me that you had left all of your old
pictures out at Jim's farm in Miami. :-(&nbsp; Now second, I want to
thank you for the money that you sent me, that was very kind and
thoughtful of you, I do appreciate it and I won't ever forget
it.&nbsp; Shit, that's two weeks at the commissary for me. :-)&nbsp;
Loyalty and devotion is also something that I learned to value
and respect from both growing up in the Church and, of course,
from my </tt></font><a href="../ganjaman.html"><font size="4"><tt>father</tt></font></a><font
size="4"><tt> which has always been a very loyal person.&nbsp;
Shit, I could have been out of prison a long time ago if I would have
wanted to sell out my so-called friends and brothers (I say
&quot;so-called&quot; because most of them wouldn't even take the
time to write me a letter now) but growing up the way I did
tought and instilled in me to hate &quot;Judas&quot; (informer)
which is a principle (even though most of the people that I was
loyal to didn't really appreciate it) that I'm happy I have
because I know that it's a principle that no amount of money in
the world can buy, either you have it or you don't.&nbsp; Still
even in the belly of the beast I have to count my
blessings.&nbsp; Speaking of bing in the &quot;Belly of the
beast&quot; I don't know if you know it of not but I'm still in
the &quot;Hole&quot; where I've been now for nine months now
(since October 24) and they say that I have nine more to
go.&nbsp; Yes, they've put me on &quot;Terrorist status&quot; and
they're trying to punish me hard for the riot that happened last
year.&nbsp; Of course, this is against their own law (in the BOP
rule book it says that it's a violation of our human rights to
keep us in segregation for any longer than 180 days) but they're
getting around their own laws by saying that we are a &quot;long
term hold over.&quot;&nbsp; As I'm sure you know the law was made
only for us, they can break them whenever they get ready, it's a
prime example of &quot;Just-us.&quot;&nbsp; Supposedly we are
waiting on bed space in a penitentiary but the truth is that we
are down here being punished over and over again.&nbsp;
&quot;This is definitely the bloodclot beast.
<DD>Now to bring you up to date on a little of the recent gossip on
some of your old brethren.&nbsp; I heard that the government was
revoking </tt></font><a href="../tropic.html"><font size="4"><tt>Brother
Louv</tt></font></a><font size="4"><tt>'s (new name &quot;Brother Nate&quot;)
appeal bond or whatever the fuck he was out of prison on, I had
thought that he was all finished with (especially since he's been
out so long) that bullshit but I guess that there is still
something hanging over his head.&nbsp; Anyway I heard that they
want him to go back to prison for a few months and then start on
his five years of parole.&nbsp; If that was his reason for not
wanting to talk to any of the old brothers they ended up fucking
him anyway and now he'll really have a good reason.&nbsp; Another thing
I heard is that brother (elderberry) Dogie was suing the brothers
for the farm up in St. Thomas because he says that &quot;He's the
last surviving elderberry so the farm is rightfully
his.&quot;&nbsp; It's really something how some brothers gave
their life to build the thing and then other ones reaped all the
rewards.&nbsp; I mean why wasn't sister Jane given a piece of the
land after brother Carl died?&nbsp; I don't know but I would say
that the elderberries were some real shit when it came to looking
out for their brothers and sisters.&nbsp; Oh yes, by the way, I
talked to Michael Hatfield (the lawyer) the other day and he
asked me if you were hooked up to the &quot;Internet computer
system&quot; which at the time I hadn't gotten your package yet
so I told him that I didn't know.&nbsp; Needless to say that it
was quite a coincidence when a couple of days after he asked me
that I received your package telling me about your </tt></font><a
href="../../"><font size="4"><tt>Internet</tt></font></a><font
size="4"><tt> work.&nbsp; Anyway he was curious to know what you
were doing lately so if you want to give him a call sometime
here's his phone number 352-669-2131.&nbsp; I would give you a
call but I only get one phone call every two weeks so I usually call
my Mother.&nbsp; Can you believe that the Warden here has the
same name as you?&nbsp; Maybe he's some family to you and you
could call him up and tell him to take it easy on me.
<DD>Well my brother I'm going to end this letter here but let me say
that I think the &quot;Internet&quot; thing is a good idea.&nbsp; Obviously
it's a good way to spread the word, you've already found a good
brother (</tt></font><a href="harrison.html"><font size="4"><tt>Christopher
Harrison</tt></font></a><font size="4"><tt>) that's hungry for
some true brothers and some doctrine, it sounds like he already
has the spirit.&nbsp; I'm not much of a letter writer but I'll
write him a letter as soon as I get caught up.
<DD>I thank you again for being a good brother to both me and my </tt></font><a
href="../ganjaman.html"><font size="4"><tt>father</tt></font></a><font
size="4"><tt>. <br>
<DD>Much louv and respect, <br>
<DD>your brother <br>
<DD>always, <br>
