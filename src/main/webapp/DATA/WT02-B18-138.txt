<h1 align="center">Your APWU Health Plan--</h1>
<h1 align="center">Protection and Peace of Mind </h1>
<p><strong>This Open Season the APWU Health Plan again offers
great benefits, protection and peace of mind--all at a
hard-to-beat premium. Not only will APWU Health Plan members have
the protection of an excellent, comprehensive benefits package,
they'll also get peace of mind, knowing that the Health Plan will
be there for them when they need it. </strong></p>
<p>For 1997, active postal employees pay only <strong>$10.70 </strong>biweekly
for Self Only coverage, just <strong>$25.21</strong> biweekly for
Self and Family. With the benefits and flexibility you get for
these premiums, it's clear the plan is a great value for APWU
members. </p>
<p><strong>Many Services Paid At 100 Percent! </strong></p>
<p>With the APWU Health Plan, you get important services such as <strong>Emergency
First Aid</strong> treatment for accidental injury, <strong>Well
Child care, generic prescriptions</strong> purchased through the
Mail Order program, and more, <strong>paid at 100 percent with no
deductible. </strong></p>
<p>Other services, such as office visits to Preferred Providers
and Preferred Chiropractors, have no deductible and are paid at
100 percent after a $10 copayment. </p>
<p>Of course, the Plan will continue to offer its popular
toll-free voluntary <strong>Nurse Advisory Line</strong>--members
have a medical practitioner as close as the telephone, 24 hours a
day! Also, new members of the Health Plan will receive an
award-winning medical guide book. </p>
<p>In addition to strong medical/surgical/hospitalization
coverage, the Plan continues to feature some of the most
comprehensive prescription drug benefits in the Federal Employees
Health Benefits (FEHB) Program. With the mail order program,
there's no deductible to pay, and generic drugs are paid at 100
percent; brand-name drugs are covered at 85 percent of the
discounted price. For immediate-care prescriptions, you'll get
discounts at more than <strong>52,000</strong> retail pharmacies.
There's a $50 deductible, then you only pay 20 percent of the
discounted price. With either program, you never file a claim! </p>
<p><strong>Huge Preferred Provider Network Still Growing </strong></p>
<p>The Health Plan offers its members 3,000 hospitals and 200,000
outpatient care providers where they can get excellent medical
care with less out-of-pocket expenses. The plan's Preferred
Provider Organization (PPO) network cover all 50 states, as well
as Washington, DC and Puerto Rico. </p>
<p>At PPO hospitals, the APWU Health plan will pay 100 percent
for room and board charges and 95 percent for all other inpatient
hospital based charges. The network's 200,000 outpatient care
providers include primary care physicians, specialists, surgeons,
outpatient medical facilities, chiropractors, mental conditions
specialists and laboratories. </p>
<p>You'll always get a great deal by choosing to use these PPO
providers--but, as always, <strong>APWU members are free to
choose any hospital or health care provider they wish. </strong></p>

<h1 align="center">Michigan State Convention Raises</h1>
<h1 align="center">$4,100 for APWU COPA </h1>
<p><strong>APWU members attending the Michigan State Convention
combined their political fundraising efforts to contribute $4,100
to the APWU COPA--Committee On Political Action--war chest.
Members of the San Francisco, CA Local also understand the
importance of raising money for political action. In the weeks
leading up to Election Day, local members organized several
fundraising activities that raised $3,614.48 for COPA. </strong></p>
<p>Although the November 5 elections are over, the struggle to
protect the future of American workers and their families
continues. APWU and auxiliary members should not abandon
political action! Despite President Bill Clinton's re-election,
Republicans have reclaimed victory in both the House and the
Senate. Judging from the vicious attacks working people faced
over the past two years, APWU and all of labor will have a rough
road ahead. </p>
<p>Legislation on Capitol Hill can have a tremendous impact on
postal/federal workers and retirees. But with every member's COPA
contribution, it will help APWU back supporters in Congress who
pledge to vote for postal workers' interests and help defeat
those who aim to cut back jobs, wages, hard-earned benefits, and
eliminate workers' rights to collective bargaining and a safe
workplace. Make an investment to protect the future! It's never
too late to give to COPA! </p>

<h1 align="center">Eligible Workers to Get </h1>
<h1 align="center">Lump-sum on December 13, 1996 </h1>
<p><strong>APWU-represented career and non-probationary employees
are scheduled to receive a $400 lump-sum payment consistent with
the terms of the 1994 National Agreement. (Transitional employees
and Support Services employees not included in the master
agreement are excluded.) Employees will receive payment on
December 13, 1996, incorporated into their regular pay checks.
Efforts to have the payment made prior to Christmas in a separate
check were unsuccessful; while it may have been possible to make
payment by separate check after Christmas, it was anticipated
that employees would prefer to have access to the monies for the
holiday season. </strong></p>
<p>Executive Vice President Bill Burrus has concluded discussions
with the Postal Service and following are the agreed-to
conditions of payment. </p>
<p>Eligibility: Those non-probationary, career employees on the
rolls in an APWU craft (Schedules C &amp; P) on November 21, 1996
will be eligible for payment if they were in a pay status anytime
from November 11, 1995 through November 8, 1996, unless in an
AWOL status or serving a suspension/discharge for the entire pay
period from October 25, 1996 through November 8. Employees who
are not on the (APWU craft) USPS rolls on November 21, 1996 will
not be eligible for payment under the APWU contract. There will
not be separate payments for eligible employees who were not in a
pay status during the pay period immediately preceding the
effective date (October 25 through November 8) but were in a pay
status during the preceding year. All eligible employees will
receive payment on the same date. </p>
<p>All eligible full-time employees will receive $400. Hourly
rate employees will receive a percentage of that based upon the
number of hours worked in the preceding year, as follows: </p>
<p>1 and under 500 hours -------- $100 </p>
<p>500 and under 1000 hours ----- $200 </p>
<p>1000 and under 1500 hours ---- $300 </p>
<p>1500 hours and over ---------------- $400 </p>
<p>The lump-sum payment will be included in the amount paid in
the December 13, 1996 check covering the period of November 23,
1996 through December 6, 1996. Deductions will include federal,
state and local taxes at the rate deducted for each employee,
Social Security and Medicare taxes. (Employees who have earned
the maximum $62,700 subject to Social Security deductions by
December 6, 1996 will not have Social Security deducted.) The tax
rate for the lump sum will be the average tax rate for each
employee for the year 1996; and even though the lump sum will be
combined with the regular check, the tax rate for the lump sum
may differ from that for hours worked. Retirement, health
benefits and union dues will not be deducted from the amount
included in the lump-sum payment. </p>
<p>Employees who left the covered APWU bargaining unit (Schedules
C &amp; P) prior to November 21, 1996 will not receive payment
under the APWU lump-sum payment procedures. Those APWU employees
who transferred to the Letter Carrier or Mail Handler crafts
prior to November 21, 1996 and were on the rolls of those crafts
on the eligibility date for payment will be eligible under the
lump sum payment procedures of their respective negotiated
agreements. APWU bargaining-unit employees who transferred to
non-bargaining-unit positions prior to November 21, 1996 will not
receive payment, as non-bargaining-unit employees are not
scheduled for a lump-sum payment based on the period covered.
Former letter carriers who transferred to an APWU craft prior to
November 21, 1996 will receive payment under the APWU payment
procedures, with credit for hours worked as a letter carrier. </p>
<p>Transferees from the Mail Handler craft to an APWU craft who
transferred prior to November 21, 1996 will receive payment under
the APWU payment procedures, but the allocation of hours worked
in the Mail Handler craft during the previous year has not been
resolved. Discussions are continuing for former mail handlers who
have not been paid under the APWU or Mail Handlers 1995 lump-sum
payment and who will not meet the eligibility requirements for
full 1996 payment. Further information regarding these
discussions will be provided. Inquiries should not be made
regarding eligibility for former mail handlers as Executive Vice
President Burrus is currently negotiating the resolution of this
issue, and no further information will be available until these
negotiations are concluded. </p>
<p>Employees who are on the OWCP rolls on November 21, 1996 or
who have not received pay from the USPS anytime from November 11,
1995 to November 8, 1996 will not be eligible for payment and
will not receive a check. Note: Employees who are on continuation
of pay, or whose conversion to OWCP rolls has been delayed, and
who appear on the USPS rolls on November 21, 1996 will be
eligible for payment if they meet the other criteria. </p>
<p>Former letter carriers who transferred to an APWU craft prior
to November 21, 1996 will receive the lump-sum payment on
December 13 consistent with the payment amounts afforded
full-time and hourly-rate employees. Hourly-rate transferees who
worked hours in the Letter Carrier craft from November 11, 1995
through November 8, 1996 shall have their hours computed to
include time spent in the Letter Carrier and APWU crafts to
determine the amount received. </p>
<p>Eligible employees who do not receive payment on December 13,
1996 should forward to the local union president a copy of their
December 13, 1996 pay stub with time records indicating that they
were on the rolls on November 21, 1996 and were in a pay status
anytime from November 11, 1995 to November 8, 1996. The local
president should review with the local payroll section the error
of non-payment, and, if the issue is unresolved, forward the
records to: </p>
<p align="center">Industrial Relations Department </p>
<p align="center">Lump-sum Payment </p>
<p align="center">1300 L Street, NW </p>
<p align="center">Washington, DC 20005 </p>
<h3><strong>Grievances should not be initiated over payment or
non-payment of the lump sum. </strong></h3>
<p><strong>Reminder:</strong> Although the lump-sum payment will
be included in regular pay checks, the payment will not be taxed
at a rate as if compounded with regular pay. The tax rate for the
lump sum will be the average tax rate for each employee for the
year 1996. </p>

<h1 align="center">Flexible Spending Account Open Season </h1>
<p><strong>Postal workers have a great opportunity to save money
during Flexible Spending Account (FSA) open season, November
11-December 9, 1996. Money set aside in FSA accounts is not
subject to federal, Medicare, Social Security, or (in most
states) state taxes. Postal workers can save on out-of-pocket
medical, dental and child/dependent care expenses by paying with
these tax-free dollars. </strong></p>
<p>Following is a brief description of the FSA program. For
complete information, eligibility requirements and restrictions,
see your personnel department or postmaster. </p>
<p><strong>Health Care FSA </strong></p>
<p>For a Health Care FSA, workers estimate their expected
out-of-pocket medical expenses (for example, copayments,
deductibles and medical expenses not covered by your health
insurance) and commit that amount to the FSA in equal
installments each pay period. The minimum is $5 per pay period
($130/year); the maximum is $100 per pay period ($2,600/year). Be
advised that any funds remaining in the account at the end of the
year must be forfeited. </p>
<p><strong>Dependent Care FSA </strong></p>
<p>Postal workers can contribute a minimum of $130 a year, up to
a maximum of either $5,000 or $2,500 per year, to a Dependent
Care Flexible Spending Account, depending on their marital
tax-filing status and their spouse's earnings. These funds can be
used for nursery school, kindergarten, child care centers, summer
day camps, babysitters, dependent care centers and household
services related to dependent care. Covered dependents include
children under 13, children physically or mentally unable to care
for themselves, or relatives or household members physically or
mentally incapable of self care (if you claim them on your tax
return and they spend eight hours or more each day in your home).</p>
<p>If you have expenses such as these, don't miss this great
money-saving opportunity. Enroll in a Health Care or Dependent
Care FSA as soon as possible. </p>
<p>Participating employees must enroll in the FSAs each year. For
complete information, see your personnel department or
postmaster. </p>

<h1 align="center">'Not in Our Town II' Airs on PBS December 23 </h1>
<p><strong>When victims of violence are targeted because of their
race, religion or sexual orientation, fear spreads throughout the
community. Instead of allowing citizens to be terrorized, many
people respond in positive ways. &quot;Not in Our Town II&quot;
profiles communities across the country that have come together
to fight intolerance. The one-hour documentary airs on PBS
Monday, December 23 at 10:00 pm ET (check local listings). </strong></p>
<p>&quot;Not in Our Town II&quot; is the sequel to &quot;Not in
Our Town,&quot; the highly acclaimed story of the people of
Billings, MT who joined together when their neighbors were under
attack by white supremacists. The new program includes stories
from communities around the nation, in South Carolina, Illinois,
Ohio and Oregon. </p>
<p>The broadcast of &quot;Not in Our Town II&quot; coincides with
the second Not in Our Town Campaign, &quot;A Season of
Tolerance&quot;--a series of events designed to increase public
awareness of the danger of hate activity. The campaign begins
December 10 with a speaking tour of people who participated in
the Billings, MT response to hate. Seven weeks of video
screenings, town hall meetings and classroom lessons in
communities across the nation will follow, culminating with
activities planned in conjunction with the Martin Luther King,
Jr. Birthday holiday in January. </p>
<p><strong>Promote a Season of Tolerance' </strong></p>

<h2 align="center"><strong>A Rare Opportunity to Own a Classic
Labor Film </strong></h2>
<h1 align="center"><strong>Acclaimed Drama, '</strong><em><strong>The
Killing Floor</strong></em><strong>'</strong></h1>
<h1 align="center"><strong>Available on Video </strong></h1>
<p><strong>Videocassettes of the Sundance award-winning, widely
acclaimed labor film, </strong><em><strong>The Killing Floor</strong></em><strong>,
are now available directly from Made in USA Productions, the
non-profit company which produced the film. </strong></p>
<p>This compelling dramatic feature film (1985, 118 minutes,
color) tells the timeless, true story of the courageous drive to
build an interracial labor union in the Chicago Stockyards in the
face of the brutal efforts by management to divide the workforce
during the 1919 race riots. <em>The Killing Floor</em> is an Elsa
Rassbach Production directed, by Bill Duke, and stars Damien
Leake, Alfre Woodard, Clarence Felder, Dennis Farina and Moses
Gunn. The research effort was led by scholars David Brody and
William Tuttle. </p>
<p>Shown on PBS in the 1980s, this union-made production was
supported by more than 30 unions and the AFL-CIO, as well as
federal and foundation grants. Reviewers have often called <em>The
Killing Floor</em> &quot;brilliant.&quot; <em>The Village Voice</em>
wrote that it's the most &quot;clear-eyed account of union
organizing on film.&quot; </p>
<p>This classic film has long been unavailable but
life-of-cassette leases are now available to labor and community
groups at prices ranging from $89.95 for one cassette to $49.95
each for 100 or more cassettes, plus shipping and handling. 16mm
film rentals are also available. Made in USA Productions will use
all proceeds for new labor film projects. For information or to
