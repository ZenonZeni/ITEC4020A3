<blockquote>
<p> The Conservative Policy Consultant Group is a division of The American Family Policy Institute and was formed out of the increasing demand by conservative citizens to be pro-active.
<p> Many conservative Americans are deeply troubled by the rising tide of governmental control over their daily lives. Government control is found in our nations public schools, private schools, home-schools, our churches, in the family business, the family farm, and the family itself. On May 16, 1995 USA Today reported that 39 percent of Americans believe that government has grown so big it represents an "immediate threat" to basic freedoms. Remove the word "immediate," and 52 percent of Americans believe the government represents a threat to basic freedoms.
<p> Today, conservative Americans clearly understand that all it takes for evil to triumph is for a good man to do nothing. Yet, in this age of information, packaging and marketing, the task of being an effective activist requires the first hand knowledge and experiences of those who have done battle with the cultural elite.
<p> The Conservative Policy Consultant Group is skilled at taking a group of committed, passionate citizens, be they mothers, fathers, grandmothers, grandfathers, college students, school board members, butchers, bakers or candle stick makers and turning them into a powerful brigade of revolutionaries. The Conservative Policy Consultant Group provides:
<ul>
 <li> Monthly 60 to 90 minute phone conferences with all your members to assist your group in long and short term goal setting, and strategic planning and training.
 <li> For your groups first phone conference you will among other things receive a personal message from national talk show host Michael Reagan.
 <li> Assistance in studying your local and state education plans and documenting their connection to outcome-based education, Goals 2000, HR 6, the Careers Act or the School to Work Act.
 <li> Assistance in writing issues briefs that explain the bill, or ordinance your trying to pass or defeat.
 <li> Assistance and training in writing press releases to promote your groups goals, meetings, and initiatives.
 <li> Training on how to get on your local talk show host as a guest to promote your cause and recruit more activists.

 <li> Legislative analysis
 <li> Political campaign management
 <li> Marketing and public relations training
 <li> How to hold successful town hall meetings

</ul>

As Michael Reagan says, there are three guys of people, those who make it happen, those who watch it happen and those who wonder what happen.
<p> Call The American Family Policy Institute today for more information on how you can make it happen. (612) 739-4112
