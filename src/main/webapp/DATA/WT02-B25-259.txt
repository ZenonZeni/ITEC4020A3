<H2>The Journey Of Hope:  View From The Field</H2>
by Joyce Burland, Ph.D., and Donna Mayeux, National Program Directors
<HR>
Last July NAMI became the sponsor of The Journey of Hope Family Education 
and Support Group Program (JOH), a family-to-family project that has swept
across NAMI grass roots in the past three years.  Developed independently by
AMI-Vermont and Louisiana AMI and joined in 1993 to form a national program,
the 12-week course and structured support group sessions are conducted
exclusively by trained AMI family-member teachers and facilitators working
in co-leader pairs.  Some 31 states and municipal AMI organizations now 
offer ongoing classes and support groups for family members in their
communities.  Five more states are already scheduled to start the JOH in
1996.  Across the country, family members new and old are flocking to this
program by the thousands, testimony that the JOH experience has helped them
immeasurably in dispelling the trauma and despair of coping with loved ones
who are suffering from serious brain (or mental) disorders.
<p>
It would miss the mark entirely to interpret the success of the JOH as 
any kind of commentary on established professional programs in the field.  
Given the millions of families seeking guidance, there can never be enough 
education and support in the world to go around.  Every program serving to 
educate and support families is a precious resource.  Rather, the JOH must 
be understood as a natural corollary to existing programs.  The JOH 
represents a new dimension in family education and support--a legitimate 
venture in self-help that reflects the maturing of the family movement 
itself.  
<p>
Think about it:  Can anyone imagine, 15 years into our mission, that we 
would fail to recognize that a nationwide program of family education and 
support was absolutely essential?  That we would not acknowledge the wisdom 
and strength AMI members gain through long years of struggle?  That we would
fail to capitalize on their potential to help others in this way?  Or miss
the opportunity to entitle our members to direct such a program?  Not on 
your life.  The JOH "phenomenon" speaks to the natural evolution of the 
family movement, to our members staking claim as full-fledged educators and
facilitators and collectively meeting this enormous community need as a 
progressive step in family leadership.
<p>
The national JOH project is conceived as an ongoing community-service 
program that can be offered by AMI affiliates.  The course is free, the 
"staff" of volunteer family-member teachers and facilitators agree to serve 
for two years as a condition of their training, and new family members 
taking the course are urged to join the local affiliate and support the 
NAMI mission.  The support group is open to all families in the community 
who want to come, regardless of membership, and it is accepted that family 
members will go in and out of the group according to their own personal 
needs.  Affiliates in the JOH report that their membership is expanding 
rapidly, that younger people are coming on their boards and work committees,
and that mental health departments are readily providing service contracts 
to run these community-based classes and support groups.  Fully two-thirds 
of the state AMI organizations now in the JOH are receiving direct state 
funding to sustain and expand the program.
<p>
The JOH support-group model follows a distinctive format that helps 
facilitators guide the group discussions in ways that are constructive and 
hopeful for the families who attend.  Through practical problem-solving and 
group focus on specific principles of self-care, family members are 
encouraged to develop proactive skills and attitudes for assisting their 
ill relative while giving attention to their own needs as well.  
Seasoned AMI support-group facilitators tell us that using this structured 
approach enables them to keep the discussion process from falling into the 
kind of gripe sessions known to discourage newcomers to the group.
<p>
Although the JOH family-education curriculum includes comprehensive 
psychoeducational and clinical information, an equal emphasis is placed 
on the emotional issues families and consumers face as they struggle to 
regain their balance and come to terms with this intensity of life 
misfortune.  The course addresses the critical needs families have in each 
stage of coping and assists families in self-care by interpreting their 
feelings of frustration, grief, disillusionment, and guilt as normal 
responses to a catastrophic illness process.  Family members who "take the 
Journey," often relate that this experience has radically reframed the way 
they regard their ill family member and has positively affected their 
relationships.  
<p>
The Journey of Hope is a crucial mission whose ideal can now be fully 
realized.  Let's give others what we needed when we started down this 
long road.  Let's bring them into our movement with our special brand of 
knowledge, compassion, and hope.  It is an idea whose time has come.  
That's why the program has met with such enthusiasm in the grass roots; 
that's why a consumer-directed education and support program based on JOH, 
developed by Tennessee AMI, will soon follow; that's why families and 
consumers are jointly teaching a JOH-based course for professional 
providers in public agencies piloted by AMI-Vermont and why AMI-Illinois 
has won a grant to translate the program into Spanish.  These developments 
signify the advent of family/consumer empowerment.  At last, the 
not-so-meek-anymore are inheriting their rightful place in the lexicon 
of providing vital, effective service.
<p>
At the NAMI Convention in Nashville this July, we will offer the first 
full-day Journey of Hope Institute.  Join us there to celebrate the superb 
job 1,500 AMI members are doing to expand the world of education and support
for families coming into our movement.
