DMTF Alters Mgm't Course

By:
BETH DAVIS

In a move that will delay the management of remote desktops,
the Desktop Management Task Force has scrapped its work on
a pivotal specification, opting instead for a standards-based
approach.

The group last week said it has stopped working on its Remote
Desktop Management Interface, slated for completion by the
new year.

Instead, the task force is now advocating the use of remote
procedure calls as the best approach for sending and accessing
information about the desktop across distributed networks.

The change of heart has slowed the DMTF's progress on a remote
specification, and network managers were divided on whether
the move will prove advantageous.

"I think it's a positive move to go with standards that are
already out there,'' said Arnold Howard, a senior PC LAN analyst
at a large financial institution in Boston. "Why reinvent the
wheel? Even if it doesn't have all the bells and whistles,
you end up with a broader base of customers and products."

Others see potential pitfalls. A single specification-like the
original RDMI-would ensure that the industry follows one set
of guidelines and applications vendors would have to write
code for only one method of communications.

Allowing use of different RPCs as the pipeline between the client
and server will force third-party vendors to either choose
which RPC they want to support or include code for all the
RPCs in their applications, said Glen Farrell, LAN system coordinator
at Firestone Textiles Co., Woodstock, Ontario.

"When it's multiple choice, it is not a standard. And RPCs are
proprietary solutions, even if they are widely implemented,''
said Rick Sturm, a principal at the Enterprise Management Institute,
San Francisco, and a network manager at one of the Bell companies.

"From a user's perspective, as long as the functionality is
there and you are able to exchange information even if you
are using more than one management application, it shouldn't
matter," said Ki Wilson, a senior microcomputer analyst at
Stone Container Corp., Chicago. "But since there is not a dominant
RPC on the market, that leaves an open-ended question for the
vendors as to which one to support."

DMTF chairman Ed Arrington said the switch keeps pace with the
organization's goals and objectives. "It is kind of a step
back, but we really want the market to make the decision here.
We don't want to be in the business of telling people what
to do," he said. "We're not a standards-forcer.''

In fact, that was the reason DMTF initially hesitated on a specification
that outlined a common way to access or send DMI information
across the network. The group had hoped the industry would
settle on a de facto standard.

Without a remoting specification, however, users must rely on
proprietary mechanisms to pass the management information that
is gathered by DMI across the network. When the industry failed
to rally around a single method, DMTF decided to develop its
own.

Since work began on the RDMI, several DMTF members have proposed
alternatives.

Last September, two proposals were presented: Distributed Computing
Environment, an IBM- and Microsoft Corp.-backed RPC; and the
Common Agent technology developed by IBM, Sun Microsystems
Inc. and several other companies.

After considering all options, DMTF decided on a Procedural
Interface, which Arrington said is "an easily remotable interface
that uses standard RPCs.''

Although the interface requires use of an RPC, it does not specify
which RPC to use. DMTF likely will allow the use of at least
three different RPCs, including DCE, Sun's Open Network Computing
and Novell Inc.'s Transport Independent RPC, Arrington said.

The interface enables an RPC to set up a pipeline between the
management application and the managed desktop. Like the original
RDMI, it will work with any connection, whether it is a LAN,
WAN or telephone link.

And though the work is several months behind DMTF's original
target of December 1995, using RPCs as the remoting technology
could mean products come to market faster. Many applications
ship with RPCs already embedded in them; for example, Microsoft
Windows 95 includes support for DCE.

The interface document has been drafted and is now undergoing
a second revision. It is expected to be completed in the next
few months, Arrington said.

In addition to the RPC remoting method, DMTF is completing its
work on the Simple Network Management Protocol-to-DMI mapping
agent. The technology will let SNMP applications manage DMI
compliant systems.

Although both the Procedural Interface and the SNMP-to-DMI mapping
agent are expected to be completed before the second half of
1996, Arrington said, they will be published with DMI 2.0,
which is slated to be introduced in March.

"Rolling those up into DMI 2.0 is going to provide a tight,
fully integrated, really powerful architecture,'' Arrington
said.

The next version of DMI includes several clarifications and
improvements, such as enhanced mapping technology and the addition
of an event model.

In addition, the DMTF this month will publish a formal product
registry that lists products that have undergone and passed
DMI-compliance tests.

The DMTF can be reached at http://www.dmtf.org or 503-264-9300.

SCO Unix to Get New Kernel

By:
EVAN SCHUMAN

Aiming to combine the best of two worlds for PC Unix users,
The Santa Cruz Operation Inc. is preparing a version of Unix
that will blend its popular OpenServer user interface and developer
tools with the guts of Novell Inc.'s UnixWare.

And though the project has the same code name-Gemini-as Novell's
former plan to merge UnixWare with NetWare at the microkernel,
SCO's strategy will abandon the so-called "SuperNOS" idea in
favor of a purer Unix approach, with NetWare technologies added
only for networking support.

Analysts and Unix OEMs said SCO's plan makes sense, and could
produce a server platform that carries with it a substantial
installed base and user familiarity, strong weapons in SCO's
battle with Microsoft Windows NT, the foremost competitor to
Unix in the Intel-based application server arena.

Tim Sheppard, PLC operating systems product manager in the server
system division at U.K.-based ICL, said he found the proposed
division of technologies for the merged Unix to be an ideal
combination.

"In terms of APIs [application programming interfaces] and in
terms of the user interface, I think it is a very logical way
of doing it," he said. "If it's done correctly, there is great
potential to get the best use of both."

Ever since the announcement last September that Novell would
sell Unix to Santa Cruz, Calif.-based SCO, technical managers
from both companies have been meeting to hammer out which elements
of their respective operating systems would survive in the
ultimate merged release, a product SCO plans to ship in early
1997.

The ultimate overriding concern was retaining existing independent
software vendor support, an area where SCO claimed a substantial
edge over Novell. SCO estimates that OpenServer has been outselling
UnixWare 2-to-1, with 12,000 applications shipping for Open
Server, compared with 850 for UnixWare, according to Jeff Ait,
SCO's vice president in charge of transition.

The strength of Novell's (and now SCO's) UnixWare is that it
is based on more advanced technology-namely, Unix System V
Release 4.2 (SVR4.2). SCO's OpenServer line was based on a
previous version of Unix, SVR3.2. So what SCO will combine
in the Gemini version of Unix, according to discussions with
SCO executives and Unix OEMs, are more advanced capabilities
of UnixWare. These include the SVR4.2-based kernel, as well
as its device drivers and multiprocessing support, security
and kernel-level threads, along with the attributes of OpenServer
that most attracted ISVs, such as its graphical user interface
and its systems administration tools. For years, SCO has opted
not to license any version of SVR4, preferring to stay with
the older license and replicating most of the SVR4 capabilities
with its own code. But the Novell deal changed all that, analysts
said.

"It sounds like they are really delivering on what they committed
to," said Tracy Corbo, a senior research analyst at International
Data Corp., Framingham, Mass. "They are actually taking this
to the next stage.

"The rules have changed. The whole game has changed," Corbo
said. SCO "now owns Unix" and the battle will be Microsoft
Windows NT versus Unix, rather than OpenServer versus UnixWare.

With Microsoft as a clear competitor, SCO's decision to go with
UnixWare's multiprocessor implementation is significant. NT
has been having difficulty scaling cleanly, as has NetWare,
while UnixWare has proven itself much more stable in high-end
Intel multiprocessor systems.

The lead SCO's OpenServer enjoys in third-party applications
support made the choice of an interface an easy one. "As a
platform, SCO was outselling UnixWare, so it would absolutely
make sense that they went with OpenServer as a GUI," said David
Watson, marketing manager at Informix Software Inc., one of
the largest UnixWare and OpenServer ISVs.

The change that SCO executives endorse most is the death of
Novell's SuperNOS concept. SuperNOS was a Novell proposal essentially
to merge UnixWare and NetWare using a microkernel approach.

SCO chief technical officer Doug Michels criticized the Novell
SuperNOS concept, saying Novell announced it before it figured
out how the concept would work. "They had a plan, which really
wasn't a plan: It was a goal," he said.

Although the next version of UnixWare integrates many of the more
popular features of NetWare-such as file, print and NetWare
Directory Services support, which also will be included in the
Gemini version of Unix-it falls far short of SuperNOS.

One of the reasons SCO is going out of its way to distance itself
from SuperNOS is because OEMs have told SCO that talk of SuperNOS
prompted several ISVs to hesitate to embrace the next version
of UnixWare.

Gerald Kerr, software product marketing manager at Unisys Corp.'s
Personal Computer division, a leading Unix OEM, said when Novell
first started talking up SuperNOS, "Unix users saw this tunnel.
And when these Unix users looked down the tunnel, they saw
these great big words: NetWare."

Kerr said users felt as if Novell was treating UnixWare as little
more than a migration for Unix users to move to NetWare.

With SCO, which has been championing Unix since its inception,
it is different, Kerr said. "Now those Unix users are starting
to look into the tunnel and they're seeing the word 'Unix,'
not 'UnixWare' or 'Unix Something Else.' "

Scott McGregor, SCO's senior vice president for products, said
although SCO will continue to use many NetWare capabilities,
the company is stopping short of claiming that one operating
system can handle everything equally well. "We're not saying
we're going to be as good at file and print," he said.

Compatibility Tools

SCO is also preparing a set of compatibility tools designed
to move users from the next UnixWare and OpenServer products
to Gemini. But the move won't be effortless.

"There's no way around the fact that OpenServer folks will have
to do some level of work" to port their applications to the
Gemini-merged Unix release, said Bob Sprowls, director of server
marketing at Unisys Corp., headquartered in Blue Bell, Pa.

TECH TRENDS: WEB INTERGRATION: CALL CENTERS GO ON-LINE

By:
MARGIE SEMILOF

A few network managers are looking to bring the same "page-pop"
principles used in computer-telephony applications to the Web.

Although industry pundits agree this is not a technology that
will take hold overnight, some managers of large call centers
believe they can extend their service offerings by giving on
line customers a way to speak directly to a service representative.

Robert MacRae at First Union Corp., a Charlotte, N.C., bank,
is one such manager. He wants to use Edify Corp.'s Electronic
Workforce application-development software to build Web applications
that give Individual Retirement Account customers a live agent
callback in response to a query from the Web.

First Union already operates a call center for 400,000 IRA customers,
as well as a Web site that posts information on the bank's
IRA services. It is looking for a way to bridge the two.

"Customers on the Internet get more information than those calling
in" on the voice-response unit, MacRae says. "But if someone
on the Web server has a question or a problem, we want them
to be able to click on a button and have their call transferred
to a representative, who can read from the same Web page."

Other managers also say they are interested in integrating call
centers with Web servers, though most aren't as far along in
plans.

"We are looking at ways to use live call-center reps to support
the provision of financial services on the Web," says Richard
Graham, vice president of telebanking administration at Signet
Banking Corp., Richmond, Va. "As to how that is done, we will
experiment. This [Edify] may be part of the answer, or our
answer may be as simple as a fax back or E-mail in response
to a question."

"We are just now looking into making our products available
to the public on the Internet," says Greg Johnston, manager
of integrated networks at Household Credit Services, Salinas,
Calif. "This Web call-center idea does pose interesting possibilities."

Edify's Solution

Edify, a Santa Clara, Calif., software developer, is doing its
best to make it as intriguing as possible. The company patented
an element to its Electronic Workforce application development
software last November that delivers what it calls "Web telephony
integration."

"In the long term, I think, this has a chance to redefine call
centers,'' says Charles Jolissant, Edify's chief technology
officer.

Electronic Workforce uses smart software agents to build interactive
response systems. Electronic Workforce sits on an IBM OS/2
server. The server sits on the network between phones and a
Web server. Edify officials say versions for additional platforms
also are in the works.

The telephony-integration software creates a Web session for
the call-center agent, giving the agent access to the same
information as the customer. Edify is also looking at ways
for the customer and agent to share information on-line.

Target applications include anywhere users browsing a Web page
may want additional information. For example, catalog shoppers
logged into a Web server may see an interesting item, but they
may find that the Web page does not answer all of their questions.

Developers can place a "call-me" button on the page that, once
clicked, alerts an agent from the catalog company's call center.
Moments later the agent can call the customer to help close
the sale.

Linking Mechanisms

There are two basic technical components that make it possible
to link a Web server to a PBX. The first is telephone control,
which is handled through computer-telephony-integration software
such as Northern Telecom Inc.'s Meridian Link or AT&T's ASAI
software-on the PBX.

But there also must be a way to get transaction information
to the call-center agent's desktop. One way is to develop a
custom application. Another is to use a Web browser to go through
the Electronic Workforce for the transaction information.

Despite this early enthusiasm for linking Web sites to call
centers, analysts said they are skeptical about the approach's
viability any time soon. They cite numerous unresolved technical
problems, Internet-related and otherwise.

"One issue is how do you establish a phone call and live link
to the screen, since the target customer is probably a consumer
with one phone line," says David Goodtree, an analyst at Forrester
Research Inc., a Cambridge, Mass.-based consulting company.

The Internet itself poses several problems, says Bart Stuck,
president of Business Strategies, a Westport, Conn., consulting
company.

"The Internet is an unmanaged network and callback times are
likely to be unpredictable," he says. "Can the Web provide
the quality of service someone with a customer-service application
is looking for, or are you better off with something that is
private and dedicated?"

Some users with sophisticated call centers are also skeptical.

At Holiday Inn Worldwide, Atlanta, customers can reserve hotel
rooms via the Holiday Inn Web site. Les Ottolinghi, director
of emerging technologies at the hotel chain, says giving customers
access to an on-line chat room is a better way to answer their
questions than having them switch to a telephone.

"Using intelligent agents to search a database is more important,"
Ottolinghi says. "If for some reason a customer has to talk
to a person, they are better off going right to the call center
in the first place."

Frame-Relay Bargain Hunt

By:
JOHN RENDLEMAN

Looking for a frame-relay bargain? Now may be the best time
for some shrewd negotiating, industry experts say.

That's because it's still unclear whether an FCC mandate for
carriers to file tariffs for frame-relay services, starting
next month, will crimp their ability to cut good deals.

Already fierce competition among long-distance carriers has
put users in the driver's seat. But with service providers
offering complicated incentives, discounts and special offers,
users must carefully consider frame-relay service contracts,
industry experts said.

For frame-relay service "customers are knowledgeable enough
to get a good deal, but the shopping process is so complex
that getting the best deal is difficult,'' according to Steven
Taylor, president of Distributed Networking Associates, a Greensboro,
N.C., consulting company.

GAB Robins North America Inc. got a favorable frame-relay deal
from Sprint a year ago, after carefully renegotiating the rates
and terms of Sprint's standard frame-relay contract, said Carl
Longo, director of telecommunications at the Parsippany, N.J.
based insurance company.

"Since then, when I've talked to other potential Sprint frame
relay customers, they hadn't thought of a lot of things I told
them to think about,'' Longo said. "They don't look at the
terms of the contract very closely. They just look at the standard
agreement and sign on the bottom line.''

Customers who use competition to their advantage can negotiate
up-front financial credits, substantial discounts off carriers'
standard rates, initial waivers of minimum volume commitments,
free installation and free service for an initial month or
more, according to attorneys at Levine, Blaszak, Block & Boothby,
a Washington law firm that helps large companies negotiate
telecommunications-service contracts.

"If I had to give potential frame-relay customers one piece
of advice, it would be to use the market,'' said James Blaszak,
a partner at the law firm. "The only way to figure out where
frame-relay prices bottom out is to use competitive bids.''

As an example of the competitive environment, MCI Communications
Corp. often gives users with small-to-medium-sized networks
free installation and volume and term discounts ranging from
4 percent to 30 percent, said William Callahan, senior manager
of broadband data marketing at MCI.

A second level of higher but unspecified discounts offered by
MCI on a customer-specific basis kicks in if a customer spends
anywhere from around $15,000 a month or more on frame-relay
or if the customer has a substantial amount of other traffic
on MCI's network, according to Callahan.

Three Months' Free Service

In addition, MCI offers up to three months of free service for
customers who want to try frame-relay service or who want to
compare MCI's frame-relay service in a side-by-side test against
another carrier's, according to Callahan.

Sprint has a different approach, trying to avoid promotional
rates, said Brad Hokamp, director of advanced data services
at Sprint, although he added that "in specific cases, there
will be times when we are pressed to do that.''

Sprint's volume and term discounts, which range from 5 percent
to 30 percent, are part of its standard frame-relay rates and
will be included in Sprint's frame-relay tariff once the FCC's
tariff rules take effect, Hokamp said.

"The price level overall in the [frame-relay] marketplace will
decline a certain percentage in the next one to two years,''
Hokamp said. Once the tariff rules are in place, however, "there
will be a decline in the number of special deals that you will
see, but it won't be significant,'' he said.

Although officials at AT&T and LDDS WorldCom, the network-services
division of Worldcom Inc., Jackson, Miss., declined to comment
on their frame-relay incentives, evidence suggests that they,
too, offer lower prices to compete for specific customers.

'Very Aggressive'

"AT&T was very aggressive in their pricing strategy with us,''
said Bob Beck, director of enabling technology services at
Inacom Corp., an Omaha, Neb.-based provider of computer and
communications systems and services.

Inacom received "a very agreeable discount'' on AT&T's standard
rates, Beck said. Although Beck declined to provide an exact
figure, "the number is very competitive with the numbers we
received from their competitors,'' he said.

Today's environment of secrecy about frame-relay rates is expected
to end next month, when service providers will tariff their
frame-relay transport services to comply with a recent FCC
decision classifying frame-relay as a basic service that must
be tariffed.

Public Record

Although industry analysts differ on whether tariffing will
help or hurt frame-relay customers, they agree it will provide
a public record of the carriers' standard rates. And though
carriers still will be able to make special deals, the rates
contained in those deals will have to be tariffed individually,
the analysts said.

That could either hurt customers, by making the providers reluctant
to lower their rates beyond a certain level, or help customers,
by letting them compare rates paid by other customers in similar
situations.

For now, Levine, Blaszak, Block & Boothby advises clients to
disregard carriers' quoted rates for frame-relay service because
savvy customers, especially those with larger networks, can
save substantially by negotiating individual deals.

Limited-time promotions are also of questionable value, because
they don't reduce the rates a customer pays for the life of
a contract, attorneys at the firm said.

Looking to the bottom line, the law firm advises potential frame
relay customers to seek bids from numerous providers, compare
actual rates and keep contract terms to a minimum in case frame
relay rates continue to decrease.

Buying Into Objects -- Illustra will give Informix key database
technology

By:
MARTIN MARSHALL

With its acquisition of Illustra Information Technologies Inc.,
Informix Software Inc. could leapfrog giants Oracle Corp.,
IBM and Sybase Inc. in the race to integrate management of
multimedia data objects in networked environments.

Through the acquisition, announced late last month and valued
at more than $400 million, Informix gained technology that
lets users create, store, manage and analyze complex data types,
such as images, audio, video and World Wide Web documents in
traditional relational database management systems.

Although the user base of such data is somewhat specialized,
the potential market has spurred other leading database vendors
to claim they, too, will be able to support similar functionality
in the near future.

Oracle, Redwood Shores, Calif., has already committed itself
to an object-relational model with its next-generation database,
Oracle8 (CommWeek, Aug. 21), while IBM is working on adding
new data types to DB2.

And Sybase Inc., Emeryville, Calif., has been quietly researching
adding object management to RDBMS server technology for four
years, according to company insiders.

Officials at Informix and Illustra said the Universal Server,
a merged object-relational database combining the technologies
of the two companies, would be delivered by the end of 1996.

Sanjeev Barma, research director for the Gartner Group Inc.
in Stamford, Conn., sees the ability to customize data types
and processes as the most important part of the object-relational
paradigm.

"Object-relational technology is going to be for 'Type A' companies
very aggressive ones that do much of their own programming,"
he said.

What Illustra lacks is what Informix has: on-line transaction
processing capabilities, multithreading, scalability to multiple
parallel-processing servers, enterprise-level reliability and
about 25 percent of the existing Unix-based relational database
market.

'Good Complement'

"Informix is a good complement to Illustra in that [Informix]
is highly scalable, reliability-tuned and massively parallel,"
said Linda Dozier, chief technologist at America Online Inc.'s
NaviSoft Inc. division in Santa Barbara, Calif. NaviSoft is
Illustra's biggest customer, using the Illustra Server as the
driving engine for AOL's Naviserver Web server.

"With AOL's on-line users growing at 30 percent per month, we
need that scalability," Dozier said.

The particular segments of the market that Oakland, Calif.-based
Illustra may add to Informix include the image and multimedia
management sectors. Illustra extends the search capabilities
to include the contents of images, rather than just the text
keys that have been entered along with images.

"From what I've read of Oracle8, it can't search within the
[multimedia] data types," said Steve Sommer, vice president
of marketing at Informix, Menlo Park, Calif. "We will be able
to search for images similar to a given image, with searches
based upon color, form and text."

Another Illustra user, Larry White, publisher of Hyperzine,
a World Wide Web-based magazine for professional photographers,
uses both Illustra's Web Data Blade and fuzzy search engine
in his implementation of Hyperzine.

"People can do a fuzzy search on the word camcorder and come
up with a review of a palmcorder, even though the review did
not contain the word camcorder," White said. White is not yet
using the image-form search capabilities of the Illustra database.

A Question of Meshing

In bringing these capabilities to an Informix product, the underlying
question for Informix and Illustra engineers may be one of
how readily the two companies' technologies will mesh.

"Before the acquisition, engineers from both of our companies
did a great deal of work to validate that our code bases could
be married together," said Bruce Gordon, vice president of
marketing at Illustra. "We feel very confident that we'll be
able to bring in the combined product by the end of the year."

"It's not a slam dunk," said Herb Edelstein, a partner at Euclid
Associates in Potomac, Md. "Each of these products has lots
of details and lots of events that must occur over the next
year before a merged product can come out." When it does, he
said, it will be "way ahead of Oracle8."

Oracle's Ken Jacobs, vice president of product strategies for
server products, would not give a time frame on the delivery
of Oracle8, but said "development is going along very well."

He also said Oracle is working on ways for the user to create
new data types in a way that is less intrusive than Illustra's
current methods.

"We don't consider it very robust to have to bring down a database
in order to add a new data type, as you have to do with Illustra,"
he said. "We feel the user should just be able to create a
new data type with a 'create-data-type' statement, the same
way they currently do to create a new table."

Study Critiques New Mail Systems

By:
JEFFREY SCHWARTZ

As many network managers choose new electronic-mail platforms
this year, they likely will discover that next-generation systems
from IBM, Microsoft Corp. and Novell Inc. are far from ideal
as enterprise-messaging backbones, according to a report published
late last month.

IBM's Lotus Notes Server, the Microsoft Exchange Server and
Novell's GroupWise XTD Server are new client/server-based-platforms
that provide marked improvements over aging earlier LAN-based
messaging systems, the "Decision 96" report from Rapport Communication
Inc. said. Rapport is a Washington consultancy specializing
in messaging systems.

Microsoft, Novell and IBM, through its acquisition of Lotus
Development Corp., sell the lion's share of LAN-based E-mail
systems. But although they supportindustry standards and offer
workgroup-computing features,all three emerging platforms will
vary and all have room for improvement, analysts said.

For instance, all three are weak when used in heterogeneous
messaging environments, said Rapport analysts, who gathered
their data from briefings with vendors and beta users.

Client and server directory structures on all platforms work
fine until connected to other E-mail platforms, said Gary Rowe
a Rapport principal. But none of the three products supports
true X.500 directory services at a protocol level.

IBM Scores Higher

Although Microsoft's and Novell's support for X.500 directory
services were considered insufficient, IBM received better
marks because of Lotus' expected support for native X.500 protocols
in its forthcoming Lotus Message Switch, said Dan Blum, a Rapport
consultant.

Officials from IBM and Microsoft could not be reached for comment
last week, but a Novell spokesman said the information about
GroupWise appeared to be accurate. Rapport analysts advised
network managers to run exhaustive pilots on more than one
system.

"I don't see a one-size-fits-all [solution] to messaging, but
the vendors that win out will be those that provide plug-and
play connectivity in heterogeneous shops," said Steve Cropper,
director of messaging systems at Charles Schwab & Co., a San
Francisco brokerage firm that is migrating 8,000 users off
of a host-based messaging system.

Most industry experts said they expect IBM, Microsoft and Novell
to remain the dominant suppliers of LAN-based E-mail software,
but there are competitive products from Banyan Systems Inc.,
Digital Equipment Corp., Hewlett-Packard Co. and Netscape Communications
Corp. worthy of consideration.

Lotus Notes 4.0 and Microsoft Exchange are expected to ship
early this year; Novell has said it expects to ship GroupWise
XTD in the second quarter.

The 130-page report critically analyzes the three platforms
and is available for $395.

Rapport can be reached at 513-777-4529.

Banyan Banking on Back-to-Basics Strategy

By:
SHARON FISHER

Users of Banyan Systems Inc.'s Vines say they are are hoping
the company's new "back-to-basics" approach will allow them
to hang on to their Banyan networks and the advantages they
offer.

John Curtis, senior vice president of Banyan's enterprise networks
division, said last week that this year the company will concentrate
more on enhancing and supporting its current line of products
and will focus less on vision statements.

Some users had been concerned about previous Banyan statements
that had left them with the impression that the company was
not committed to Vines, Curtis said.

"There'll be no more talk about 'Vines is dead' and there'll
be not as much talk, but more action," he said. "You won't
see us pronouncing grand visions."

As part of that plan, the company intends to release in the
next two or three quarters a new version of Vines will be easier
to use and that is better integrated with Windows NT (CommWeek,
Nov. 6, 1995)

Mixed Reviews

Analysts said Banyan's new strategy, which was outlined at news
meetings last month, is a solid move.

"They're pedaling as fast as they can from a development standpoint,
building on their core competency," said Glenn Gabriel Ben
Yosef, president of Clear Thinking Research Inc., a Boston
consultancy.

Users said they hoped the reorganization would help Banyan because
Vines offers features that are not provided by any other network
operating system. But the same users were not necessarily confident
about the future.

"As it is right now, there is still only one choice for an enterprise
network, and unfortunately I don't think Banyan realizes it,"
noted Gary Wescom, a computer systems engineer for Pacific
Gas & Electric Co., San Francisco. PG&E has some 20,000 PCs
on its Vines network.

"There are some things that companies, like PG&E, can't do without
the services of a network operating system like Banyan's, and
it doesn't appear that Microsoft is going to be able to provide
it very quickly," Wescom said. "We were looking at a pretty
scary time. Banyan had shown an interest in basically going
away-that was all the signs we were seeing-and to have them
still out there trying to continue on at least gives us the
feeling that we'll be able to keep our Banyan network operating
until something else comes along.

"But," he continued, "it's hard to have a whole lot of confidence
of Banyan withstanding the Microsoft onslaught for very long,
even if it is a superior product."

Other Banyan users said they were preparing for a future where
Vines would be integrated with other NOSs, such as Microsoft's
Windows NT.

Clinging to Vines

"I've invested in Vines, so I have a deep desire [that Banyan
survive], but at the same time we are doing everything we can
to integrate other Windows NT networks in with Vines," said
Eddie Albert, project manager of Banyan network operations
for the U.S. Air Force at the Pentagon. He is responsible for
251 Vines servers, and said he thinks the Air Force as a whole
which is integratingits bases worldwide-has 500 to 1,000 Vines
servers.

"Windows NT is a very good LAN and a very good file server,
but for the underlying backbone I would still use Banyan's
Vines, and that's the way I'm setting my networks up," Albert
said.

Banyan's Curtis said the new strategy is an extension of a company
wide reorganization last year that also included appointing
John Paul to head a division focused on Internet services (CommWeek,
Nov. 13, 1995)

"We've got good technology, but we haven't been focused on bringing
it into the modern world, on making Vines more friendly and
bringing Windows NT into it," Curtis said. "We had a lot of
things running at cross-purposes when it was a monolithic organization.
What John Paul and his people are doing requires a turn on
a dime; what we do is a consistent story and predictable path.
We were getting to where we weren't doing either one very well."

Keeping Customers Happy

Will Banyan still be an independent company by the end of this
year? "I can't disagree with that being a good question," Curtis
said. "If somebody big wants to acquire us, I think our customers
would say 'fine.' That's really my measure-are the customers
happy?"

Interview: Directing IBM's Server Strategy


Nicholas Donofrio is one of the most influential executives
in the server industry. Reporting directly to IBM chairman
and CEO Lou Gerstner, 29-year IBM veteran Donofrio oversees
all server activity at IBM, including mainframes, the AS/400,
the RS/6000 Unix workstations and a line of Intel-based PC
servers.

His current title is senior vice president and group executive,
but Donofrio began his career at IBM as a designer of semiconductor
chips.

Recently, Communications-Week editor at large Evan Schuman met
with Donofrio at IBM's headquarters in Armonk, N.Y., for a
wide-ranging discussion of server issues. Here are some excerpts.

CommWeek: The Internet and multimedia applications are placing
unprecedented demands on hardware. How is this demand affecting
IBM's development of Internet and video servers?

Donofrio: In the final analysis, the power is in the bandwidth,
the I/O capability and the storage of most of these servers,
not necessarily in the processor. The exception is numerically
intensive processes, which need the processor to give all of
the answers. But that's not what the rest of the world is driven
by. That's probably not what the Internet is driven by. That's
not what multimedia is really driven by. It's just driven by
bandwidth and storage capability.

All of these servers are trying to grow up-to go from megabytes
to gigabytes to terabytes to petabytes. All of them need faster
channel and I/O structure. All of them have to get multiple
gigabit channel access to keep up with the demands-either multimedia
or data-in all kinds of forms. And they need the ability to
feed thousands of people in this very, very far-flung thing
we call the Internet.

Right now, people tolerate "server down, server busy, no access."
In the future that'll be less tolerated.

CommWeek: Are they tolerating it? Conventional wisdom today
has many users not returning to sites where they get repeated
busy signals.

Donofrio: Well, that depends on how badly you need the answer,
doesn't it? If you're browsing, I agree with you. Don't go
back. But that's not going to work if it's a transaction you
want to complete; if we're putting real commerce on the Internet.
Then it's not going to be "don't go back." You need to go back.
You started the transaction. You want to complete it or you
want whatever those goods or services are at the other end.

Not going back is not going to work as we get to electronic
commerce. We're going to need something more reliable, something
more predictable and something more deliverable. That's what
people are working on, trying to make these things more industrial
strength, along with security.

CommWeek: A recent trend is the proliferation of specialized
ser-vers, for electronic mail and Internet and other applications.
Do you see this continuing?

Donofrio: Depending on your size and scale, maybe you can have
four or five servers in your business. But when four or five
servers become 50 or 100 servers, that's a chore.

People are consolidating. One very simple example is how SP2
has gone into large businesses as a file or as a server consolidation
system. People just collect 50, 60, 100 servers, put them inside
an SP2 frame or two, and then manage them all from the same
physical point-all with the same system software. That's a
cost statement for a lot of our customers. They can't keep
up with a server a month for this or for that. And I don't
think a server a month is going to be in the future.

CommWeek: So you don't think there's a trend toward more specialized
servers?

Donofrio: No.

I think that during the last couple of years, that's what's
happened. But I think it is reversing now. Again, it depends
on the business or a small business, maybe two or three specialized
servers is all they need.

CommWeek: What about replicated sites? Or small branch offices
where users want an isolated E-mail server?

Donofrio: That works for some period of time. But what happens
when the server is the limiter? Suppose you have a server handling
500 people. When you're above that limit, replication is the
answer and you can stick gateways between the two so that they
can communicate. That's fine as long as you just don't need
more than 500 people interacting at the same time. But there
are lots of applications where you need tens of thousands of
people to interact at the same time.

The world can't just take what you've got and build replications
and put gateways in place. Res-ervations systems will not work
in that way. Large transaction, financial clearing systems
won't work that way. If the business has to close its books
every night, it won't work that way.

CommWeek: How would you describe the changed uses of mainframes?

Donofrio: More people are trying to use them as a central server.
We're trying to change our image and we're trying to change
the nomenclature, but we're not foolish. These 390 servers
still do the highest logical form of computing.

More people are using them for repositories. Whether they are
repositories of data the way we understand it today, or whether
it's more complex forms of data such as multimedia mixed with
regular data, they like the fact that it has all the bandwidth,
all the interconnectivity. They like the fact that it has the
systems management abilities.

CommWeek: Are there any mainframe applications that you've seen
disappearing over the past couple of years?

Donofrio: I think it's a matter of scale and some people can
get the job done with something that's different, that's smaller.
In some cases, they may be better serviced with a PC server
or an RS/6000 server. In a lot of cases, the applications aren't
available on a System 390.

CommWeek: A lot of users say there's too much capability on
the desktop, with servers relatively underutilized. Do you
agree?

Donofrio: We see a lot of that and you're going to see even
more of it. People are tired of trying to manage it. They're
tired of the costs and the questionable return on the investment.
And they know one size doesn't fit everybody in their business.
Not everybody needs the world's most powerful desktop or workstation.

We'll never go away from graphical user interface front ends
and things of that nature. But people are trying to figure
out what they're getting for the buck. There's always going
to be a balance.

ATM Gear to Support SVC -- StrataCom to emphasize extemporaneous
connections, security for ATM switches

By:
ERIC LACH

StrataCom Inc. will begin shipping software for its asynchronous
transfer mode switches next week to support switched virtual
connections.

SVCs let users build up and tear down connections on demand,
providing considerable savings over permanent virtual connections,
the other common means of connection for ATM.

Although StrataCom is not the first company to announce SVC
support on its ATM switches, it is the first major switch vendor
to do so. Analysts claim SVCs are key to ATM's long-term value.

"If ATM doesn't have the ability to support these casual collaborative
relationships, it is going to be tough to achieve the benefits
we think we will get out of ATM," said Tom Nolle, president
of Cimi Corp., a Voorhees, N.J., consultancy.

Other Selling Points

Users are likely to welcome the economies that SVCs offer.

"Right now we are using only PVCs because that is the only thing
we can get from both our switch vendors and carrier," said
John Steedman, an electronics engineer in the NASA communications
division at the Goddard Space Flight Center, located in Greenbelt,
Md.

Steedman said he has had problems with PVCs, particularly the
variable bit rate PVCs, because they steal resources whether
or not they are in use.

"SVCs would be a real advantage to us so that we could tear
down some of these VBR PVCs when we do not need them,'' Steedman
said.

StrataCom officials confirmed that the announcement would be
made this week.

Security Assurances

Sources said the company will offer ATM signaling and security
features to give users better control over SVCs on their ATM
networks. One key feature is support for both source- and destination
address screening, which lets users specify port by port a
list of ATM addresses for which they can receive or initiate
SVC calls.

StrataCom "is trying to address some of the security issues
that come with SVCs, because an SVC is like an ATM telephone
number-a dial-up call," Nolle said. "One problem with SVCs
is that someone who knows your ATM calling ID could breach
your network security because you might be running applications
that don't know they are using SVCs, and don't protect against
intrusion."

Some protection is considered mandatory for public networks
where many different companies are connected to the same ATM
service, giving them access to each other's ATM connected devices.

In addition to offering its own security safeguards, StrataCom,
San Jose, Calif., has said it will add more ATM security mechanisms,
such as those under consideration by the ATM Forum's new security
working group, once those specifications are available.

StrataCom's SVC software is available as a system upgrade. It
complies with the ATM User-to-Network Interface specification.
The ATM SVC signaling scheme also conforms to both ATM UNI
3.0 and 3.1 and provides a translation between these standards.

The company also will support ATM SVC signaling for the ATM
Frame UNI and ATM Inverse Multiplexed interfaces when they
are delivered early this year.

StrataCom is also expected to announce support for the Interim
Inter-Switch Signaling Protocol, which provides interoperability
between multiple vendors' ATM switches and the Interim Local
Management Interface protocol for ATM connection management.

Congress Continues To Tinker With Bill

By:
MARK ROCKWELL

Landmark telecommunications legislation was put on hold until
after the budget crunch is resolved, but that didn't stop some
final tinkering on the bill by legislators late last month.

Although Congress adjourned at the end of December without acting
on the legislation, lawmakers negotiated and crafted a bill
that can be acted on quickly when it does comes up for a vote.
In recent weeks, conference committee members managed to get
the long distance and local telephone industries' support for
the legislation by granting limited concessions on key issues.

The recent alterations would increase government supervision
of Bell company entry into long distance and allow the Bell
companies to jointly market local and long distance services.
Legislators also decided to keep language that allows states
to continue their individual price-cap initiatives, according
to Capitol Hill sources.

Unresolved Issues

The work puts the finishing touches on the telecommunications
issues in the bill, but leaves more contentious broadcast issues,
mainly foreign ownership of stations, to be addressed. Both
the long distance and local telephone lobbying forces have
given a "grudging OK" to the bill, according to one long distance
lobbyist.

Initial language in the bill concerning the entry of the Bell
companies into long distance gave the FCC the decision-making
role in that process, but relegated the Department of Justice
to an advisory role (CommWeek, Dec. 18, 1995)

Before adjournment, the committee put greater weight behind
the Justice Department's simple advisory role, indicating that
Justice's opinion should be given "substantial weight" in any
decision made by the FCC.

"It's very important that they're back in the picture. It could
create a situation where the FCC is embarrassed into doing
something," said Jeffrey Kagan, president of Kagan Telecom
Associates, an Atlanta consulting company.

The Bell companies got the OK to jointly market local and long
distance services, something that was precluded in the original
language of the joint bill.

"That got the Bell companies on board," the lobbyist said.

Depending upon whom you talk to, the bill could either be passed
early this week or at the end of the month. A spokesman for
the Senate Commerce Committee said that if enough signatures
could be collected on the conference committee report, the
bill could be approved by Tuesday.

The House side holds the key to the bill, however, and observers
there said representatives are more guarded in their assessment
of the bill's timing.

New Year Ushers In More Urgent Role for Nets

By:
THE COMMWEEK STAFF

With the new year comes the promise of new products and technologies
that will let corporate networks take on a more critical role
in how business is conducted.

Key to this transformation of the corporate network from information
utility to strategic resource will be the Internet and Internet
related technologies. But they certainly won't be the only
driving force; corporate network managers will grapple with
a variety of other technologies and industry issues, such as
consolidation and new levels of competition in the telecommunications
market.

First drawn to the Internet and World Wide Web by the hype surrounding
it in 1995, network managers are expected to play a crucial
role in moving already established Internet connections to
a new level, using several new classes of products.

"Today we have generic software tools with base-level functionality,"
said Steve Franco, research analyst with the Yankee Group,
Boston. "In 1996 we'll see tools that add value and improve
existing business processes, like increased groupware functionality
for Internet software."

By the end of the year, many of those applications will include
encryption and digital signature techniques, which will let
users secure their communications. Companies will be able to
rely on more than firewalls to provide point-to-point encryption,
Franco said.

Also of particular importance will be a means to secure corporate
networks, especially those with an on-line presence. This likely
will induce businesses to use outside Web service bureaus,
which now host 50 percent of all commercial Web pages.

Web authoring and management tools will continue to gain momentum,
as applications accessed over the Web become more interactive.

As media buyers become accustomed to the Web, they increasingly
will seek to spread out expenditures to reach the specialized
audience segments that can be delivered reliably via the Web.

About $12.4 million was spent on paid HyperText links between
October and December alone, according to WebTrack Inc., a New
York-based market research company.

No doubt this amount will continue to grow at an exponential
rate as the pieces are put in place during 1996 to make electronic
commerce a reality.

Also, look for third-party auditing services to hammer out ways
to adequately track activity on a Web site.

Like the Internet, electronic mail will continue to gain acceptance.
Although Microsoft Exchange and the Lotus Message Switch will
be available this year, organizations will not make the move
overnight. Many are likely to pilot the new systems as well
as others, including Hewlett-Packard Co.'s Open Mail and Novell
Inc.'s GroupWise XTD.

E-Mail Possibilities

Because of the distributed nature of organizations, many shops
are likely to use a variety of E-mail clients and servers.

"People are going to start to understand how badly they need
directory services,'' said Terry McCarthy, president of New
York-based systems integrator Neoterik.

Also, as evidenced last year, messaging will become a core function
of collaborative computing systems and Web browsers, several
analysts said.

The Internet Engineering Task Force's newest version of the
Remote Monitoring specification will help that cause. The next
version, RMON2, expected to be completed this month, will boost
RMON's capabilities, letting network managers gather information
about network traffic at the application layer.

Leading network management platform vendors also are expected
to deliver their next-generation platforms.

Indeed, HP is aiming for the first half of 1996 for the rollout
of its fully distributed version of OpenView. The new version
enables the graphical user interfaces to be off-loaded onto
individual workstations while main-

taining one workstation as the Network Node Manager server.

Sun Microsystems Inc. has promised that its fourth iteration
of Solstice Enterprise Manager will ship this year; the commercial
version of the distributed management platform, which will
include object-oriented capabilities, will be available in
the second half of 1996.

Although some technologies will be regarded with skepticism,
others, such as ISDN and frame-relay, will continue to be adopted
en masse, according to experts.

"Frame-relay service is probably going to experience the same
tremendous amount of growth that it did in the last year,"
said Beth Gage, broadband consultant at TeleChoice Inc., a
Verona, N.J., consultancy. "Remote-LAN connectivity is probably
the largest application for frame-relay networks and that probably
won't change for awhile."

Slow Growth for ATM

The use of asynchronous transfer mode service for wide-area
connections is not expected to grow dramatically in the coming
year, although the planned introduction during 1996 of frame
relay-to-ATM service interworking by providers will let users
with frame-relay networks adopt ATM at high-speed sites, analysts
said.

"Interworking is a key issue for ATM," Gage said. "Interworking
will help ATM get off the ground, although we don't think 1996
is going to be the year for ATM."

Also during the year, FCC rules that require service providers
to tariff their frame-relay services probably will take effect,
although it's difficult to predict what the impact of tariffing
will be on frame-relay rates, observers said.

In the protocol arena, analysts said they expect to see more
consolidation in the TCP/IP software vendor arena, as competition
grows among companies that want to provide applications that
run over operating systems' native stacks.

More often than not, users will opt to use the stack that comes
with the operating system, and look for bells and whistles
elsewhere.

IBM is expected to make its proprietary operating systems more
open by enhancing its TCP/IP offerings, including offering
upgraded versions of its TCP/IP for MVS. The company may also
soup up its OS/2 Warp operating system with new TCP/IP features.

In the network operating systems area, Novell's plan for the
year is to focus on networking, its core competency. It will
also continue to compete with Microsoft Corp.'s Windows NT,
and, in particular, will encourage applications developers
and users to look on its NetWare Directory Services as an enterprise
wide, industry-standard directory.

"I think how [Novell's reorganization] plays out next year is
Novell really focuses their attention on keeping their installed
base, and driving NDS and NetWare services to become de facto
standards," said Jon Oltsik, an analyst at Forrester Research
Inc., a Cambridge, Mass., consultancy.

For Banyan Systems Inc., the future is more problematic. "1996
is the 'do-or-die' year in terms of continuing to permeate
this idea of enterprise network services, and leverage StreetTalk
as an Internet directory or a corporate directory," said Mike
Rothman, vice president of the Meta Group Inc., a Reston, Va.,
consultancy.

Continued Acquisitions

Analysts predict the consolidation frenzy will continue in 1996.
In particular, they said, look for Cisco Systems Inc. to continue
making acquisitions.

3Com Corp.'s acquisitive mood may be diminished, however, because
of the difficulties it has had bringing Chipcom into its fold,
but Cabletron Systems Inc. and Bay Networks Inc. can be expected
to fill out their product lines or develop their customer base
or channels to market through small tactical purchases.

Even more turmoil can be expected in the telecommunications
market-with or without national telecommunications reform legislation.
But if the pending bill is signed into law, the telecommunications
industry will begin anew.

Getting Ready

All parties with a stake in the telecom market have been making
quiet preparations to enter into an intense battle.

For instance, AT&T's strategy is to use an existing structure
to enter the local services market. It is anticipating entering
local telecom markets this year and has even assigned sales
figures to some of its executives for 1996 that go beyond Ameritech's
Chicago and Grand Rapids, Mich., local competition trials.

If the telecommunications bill doesn't make it past President
Clinton's desk, state initiatives will carry the deregulatory
trend forward.

Blending Tech Into OpenDoc

By:
MARTIN MARSHALL

The melding of Taligent Inc.'s compound document framework into
IBM's OpenDoc cross-platform, object-development environment
should give network managers wider access to more complex objects.

The Taligent technology will start to appear in IBM's Open Class
library next month, giving developers the ability to use it
to generate OpenDoc or Object Linking and Embedding parts,
said Jon Slitz, vice president of object technology marketing
at IBM.

The company is looking at a variety of ways to weave the Taligent
technology into the Open Class libraries and make it CORBA
2.0 compliant, according to IBM executives.

IBM took over Taligent as a wholly owned subsidiary last month
after a four-year venture with Apple Computer Inc. and Hewlett
Packard Co. The three companies formed the Cupertino, Calif.
based Taligent in 1991 to develop an object-oriented development
environment and operating system for the next generation of
PCs and workstations.

In addition to giving details about the role Taligent technology
will play in IBM's overall object strategy, IBM executives
said IBM will use its System Object Model (SOM) to capture
Microsoft Corp.'s OLE custom-control (OCX) component technology
for use in multiplatform environments. The company also outlined
future plans for its DB2 database.

Users of IBM's object solutions expressed disappointment about
the failure of the Taligent initiative and wondered if integrating
Taligent's compound-document framework was the right course
to take.

"I would have been more excited if IBM was defining a business
process engine rather than a compound-document engine," said
David Taylor, president of Enterprise Engines Inc., San Mateo,
Calif. "IBM has brought objects to the mainframe, which takes
the MIS guys out of a terrible conflict, but they just haven't
delivered on the [Taligent and OpenDoc] stuff," he said.

Taylor is more enthusiastic about the prospects of IBM's SOM
technology embracing OCX. "I heartily endorse that. OCXs are
brain-dead, in my opinion, and they will give the world a bad
impression of object technology. But, within a SOM wrapper,
they can become truly object-oriented, taking on polymorphism
and inheritance, and that would be great."

IBM's Slitz said, "You'll see from us a way to use OCXs in concert
with SOM, and they will be more robust in the sense that they
will be able to run in cross-platform environments. This is
part of IBM's continuing recognition that OLE exists in the
marketplace. We will create high-value ways of integrating
OLE into larger environments."

Future Plans

IBM also will bring its object technology to the World Wide
Web, developing a common application programming interface
to interface SOM objects with network middleware layers that
will bond the Web to back-end and legacy applications. In 1996,
IBM also will bring distributed naming and directory services
to the Web and expand its compound document architecture to
new data types, including coded and non-coded information.
"You will also see Java-based applications from IBM this year,"
Slitz said.

DB2 Expansions

IBM's plans for DB2 this year will include a growing number
of user-defined data types, according to Tim Negris, an IBM
vice president.

"In 1996, we will add to DB2 something called Cubic Query, or
querying based upon the contents of an image," he said.

For the real number crunchers, IBM will come out with a financial
modeling tool, called a Differential Equation Blaster.Negris
said that IBM, along with consulting service partners, would
introduce several data-mining applications.

IBM can be reached at http:// www.ibm.com or 800-426-3333.

WorldCom Extends Frame-Relay Services

By:
JOHN RENDLEMAN

LDDS WorldCom will expand its frame-relay network-to-network
interface service to Europe through agreements with undisclosed
European service providers this quarter.

The expansion will open another avenue for users to extend their
frame-relay networks globally.

In addition, LDDS WorldCom has extended its domestic WilPak
frame-relay network-to-network (NNI) capability to 10 additional
U.S. cities. During the first half of this year, the company
plans to continue an aggressive effort to extend its NNI reach,
said Emily Hansen, frame-relay product manager at LDDS WorldCom,
the network service division of WorldCom Inc., Jackson, Miss.

This will be an easy way for LDDS WorldCom "to expand its international
frame-relay coverage," said Tim Burke, an analyst at the Yankee
Group, a Boston consulting company.

For overseas connections, "NNI allows us to partner with another
company whose deployment of switches is denser than our own,"
Hansen said.

With LDDS WorldCom's NNI offering, customers connect localized
or regional sites using short-haul frame-relay circuits provided
by their local service providers. They connect the regional
frame-relay network to more distant sites through a physical
NNI connection to LDDS WorldCom's frame-relay network, the
company said.

Domestically, customers of LDDS WorldCom's NNI service pay standard
rates for the long distance portion of their networks, plus
the tariffed rate charged by the local provider for regional
frame-relay connections and a monthly fee for each 64 kilobit
per-second increment of capacity on the NNI connection.

In Brief: TELCO MEGA-MERGERS IN STORE?


Merger rumors continued late last week as Congress inched closer
to agreeing on the telecommunications bill that would allow
long distance, local telephone and cable companies to compete.
Rumors of AT&T's buying out GTE Corp. and of Bell Atlantic
Corp.'s acquiring Nynex Corp. topped the list. None of the
companies would comment.

In Brief: THE BALL DROPS WITHOUT NEW NOTES


IBM's Lotus Development Corp. would not confirm late last week
whether it met its year-end deadline to ship its new version
of Notes. But even if the vendor had Notes 4.0 out the door
before the ball dropped at New York's Times Square, analysts
said the company effectively missed the deadline because users
were unable to install the final commercial Notes 4.0 release
in 1995. Most users doubted Lotus would meet its promised deadline,
according to Dale Johnson, president of Johnson Consulting
Inc., a Woburn, Mass., consultancy.

In Brief: CISCO KILLS BUG


Cisco Systems Inc., San Jose, Calif., last week said that a
software bug temporarily shut down some of its Grand Junction
workgroup switches, knocking out about 300 LANs worldwide.
A glitch in the internal clocks of some FastSwitch 2100 and
2800 switches caused them to shut down at 12:01 a.m. on Wednesday,
Dec. 27, and then restart at 12:01 a.m. on Sunday, Dec. 31.
The problem was not a virus but a system software error, Cisco
said last week. Engineers corrected the problem and do not
expect a recurrence.

MICROSOFT STRIKES BACK -- Besieged by Netscape, BackOffice delivers
a powerful and reliable NT-based Web server

By:
WAYNE RASH JR.

Microsoft Corp.'s Internet Information Server is clearly aimed
at the high end. Available only as a free beta download, there's
a good chance that you've already seen this product, since
it's the platform that's been running Microsoft's site on the
World Wide Web since last summer. As a result, Microsoft has
gained a great deal of experience at designing and implementing
a Windows NT-based Web server designed for heavy volumes and
high performance. The company has used this experience in creating
the commercial version of its Internet server.

In addition, when Microsoft ships the final version (available
either as a free download or for $99 in shrink-wrap), it will
bundle the ability to work with its SQL Server database. This
means that users who want to progress beyond "brochureware"
have an easy way to provide information to the Net. In fact,
the SQL Server database does not need to be located on the
Internet server, but instead can be located elsewhere on the
company network, which can ease the administration load and
reduce the requirement to duplicate data. Of course, if you
have a machine with enough capacity, you can locate SQL Server
on the Windows NT server that's running the Internet Information
Server.

The Microsoft Internet Information Server must run on a Windows
NT Server, version 3.51. In addition, it requires that Service
Pack 2 be applied before you attempt to install the server
software. Server Pack 2 was included on the CD-ROM that also
included the Internet Server, but it still requires an extra
step. Specifically, you must first apply the update software
(which is essentially an automatic process), reboot the computer
and load the Internet Server.

Installing the Internet Information Server is a nearly hands
off process. Once you make some basic choices, the installer
takes over and handles the rest. Adding to the ease of use
is a set of well-designed management and access tools. For
example, the server management package can run either on the
Windows NT machine itself or on a workstation elsewhere on
the network. In addition, the package can manage several Internet
Information Servers at a time, which can reduce workload and
make large sites much more practical to administer.

As you'd expect from a server aimed at high-end users, Microsoft's
Internet Information Server ships with effective management
tools. Able to run either on the server platform itself or
on a remote workstation, these tools manage server function
on any attached Internet Information Server. Although the nature
of Internet servers is such that the vast majority of such
management involves monitoring status, you can use Microsoft's
now-familiar tabbed notebook metaphor to change a variety of
operational and security settings.

In addition to its own management service, Microsoft includes
a Simple Network Management Protocol agent so you can keep
tabs on the Internet server as a part of a larger management
solution.

What Microsoft doesn't include, at least in this beta version,
is a World Wide Web authoring tool. Although such a tool is
available from Microsoft for use with Microsoft Word, it wasn'tshipped
in the Internet Information Server box. On the other hand,
Microsoft includes its Internet Explorer Web browser for Windows
3.1, Windows 95 and Windows NT. Unlike the vendors of some
World Wide Web-browser software, the versions included by Microsoft
can be distributed by network managers without additional fees.
Microsoft says that its server also will work with browsers
from other manufacturers, which we confirmed via Net-scape
Communications Corp.'s Netscape Navigator.

Another factor that makes the Microsoft Internet Information
Server easier to absorb into an organization is that it runs
on any hardware platform that supports Windows NT. This means
you can start running it on an Intel computer, but can move
to a PowerPC, MIPS or Alpha machine as your needs change.

Microsoft puts a lot of stock in its feature set, and with some
justification. Although it's not clear that most users will
need all the features included with the Internet Information
Server, at least if you do need them, they're there. Some of
the most useful features include an FTP service and a Gopher
service. Although these services are readily available from
third parties, it's convenient to have them bundled instead
of needing to purchase new software.

Likewise, Microsoft takes advantage of Windows NT Server's excellent
security to provide a server that can handle both password
and data encryption. You can disable anonymous log-ins, for
example.

Whether you should wait for the Internet Information Server
to ship or choose to move ahead now with Netscape Netsite or
O'Reilly & Associates Inc.'s WebSite depends on your level
of experience and needs. Netscape, for example, has shown an
admirable dedication to making sure its products are secure,
even to the extent of offering rewards to people who can break
its security. O'Reilly has long promised easy setup of a site
on the World Wide Web. Microsoft appears to offer both capabilities.

The fact that Microsoft has developed its Internet Information
Server for its own use in an extremely busy environment is
encouraging. Of course, the same can be said for Netscape's
products, so though Microsoft ranks with the leaders here,
it's not unique.

We found the process of installing and using Microsoft's Internet
Information Server to be anticlimactic. Unlike a number of
beta products we've been reviewing, this one works. If it ships
with complete documentation and competent support, Microsoft's
Internet Information Server could be an excellent solution
for businesses and organizations both small and large, especially
if valuable database content will be provided along with pretty
pictures.

CrossWind Multithreads

By:
RON COPELAND

CrossWind Technologies Inc. will announce next week a new version
of its real-time, enterprise-wide collaboration software, which
features a new multithreaded architecture to improve application
performance and extend application scalability to more than
50,000 users.

Synchronize 2.0 does this by taking advantage of the multi-threaded
capabilities of Microsoft Windows NT server and other Unix
environments. Multithreading, which optimizes the interaction
of the software with the underlying server hardware, is administrator
configurable. Client requests, inter-server communications
and disk I/O also can be optimized.

Synchronize is a platform- and electronic-mail-independent calendaring
and scheduling application that supports users and resources
across an enterprise network. The software lets users easily
schedule meetings and resources, distribute agendas and memos,
assign and track tasks and issue reminders, the company said.

The Synchronize software communicates directly across the TCP
IP network at network transport speeds to provide real-time
scheduling, task and resource management, said David Wellington,
president and CEO of CrossWind, Santa Cruz, Calif.

Synchronize 2.0 adds an Apple Macintosh client to the currently
available Window 3.x, Windows NT, X11/Motif and ASCII environments.
LAN-based and remote access are supported.

Synchronize 2.0 will be available in mid-February and will sell
for $100 per client.

CrossWind Technologies can be reached at http://www.crosswind.com
or 408-469-1780.

Sybase Previews App Upgrade

By:
MARTIN MARSHALL

Sybase Inc.'s PowerSoft Corp. subsidiary has begun showing selected
corporate users a beta version of its next-generation PowerBuilder
5.0.

PowerSoft's new offering maintains the drag-and-drop simplicity
of previous versions and a 16-bit capability for Microsoft
Windows 3.1, but adds the 32-bit capabilities of Windows 95,
Windows NT, Unix and Apple Macintosh environments. Only PowerBuilder
for Windows 95 and Windows NT beta copies were shown to users.

Observers said they expect to see released copies of the Windows
versions in March, with Macintosh and Unix versions appearing
later this year.

"We're going to use it to solve maintenance and management problems
across thousands of clients," said Tom Cervenka, senior research
programmer for the University of Illinois university system,
in Urbana.

The new version of PowerBuilder performs practical application
partitioning across the network and offers an object management
facility, new data windows, the look and feel of Windows 95
and support for extended Object Linking and Embedding 2.0 automation.

In a future release PowerBuilder will offer "a World Wide Web
object inside it that would allow the creation of Web-enabled
applications and the recognition" of OLE Controls-based HyperText
Markup Language components," said Robert Zurek, director of
research and development for Sybase's PowerSoft division.

Depending upon the application, compiled code can run from two
to 10 times faster than the interpretive code of previous versions.

Pricing for PowerBuilder 5.0 has not been set.

EDA/SQL Gets Messaging Middleware

By:
MARTIN MARSHALL

The next generation of Information Builders Inc.'s EDA/SQL will
offer corporate users both synchronous and asynchronous replication
options and the benefits of messaging middleware.

The New York middleware vendor announced last month it has licensed
message-oriented middleware technology from Mo- mentum Software
Corp. and will incorporate it into EDA/ SQL 4.0, which is expected
in March.

The incorporation of Momentum's X*IPC messaging middleware will
enable IBI's replication and gateway facilities to connect
remote servers in an asynchronous fashion.

"One of the advantages of the asynchronous aspect that Momentum
brings is performance. Users can fire off four queries or so
without having to wait for the first query results to come
back," said Alan Tonnesen, executive vice president of Insync
Software Corp., Ronkonkoma, N.Y.

EDA/SQL 4.0 can replicate data bidirectionally to roaming, heterogeneous
environments.

Pricing for the new version of EDA has yet to be determined.

Banyan's New TCP/IP Backs Win 95

By:
Sharon Fisher

Banyan Systems Inc. has introduced a version of its TCP/IP applications
suite that supports Microsoft Windows 95 and includes a Web
browser.

Banyan TCP/IP Applications Suite 2.0 is an enhancement of software
licensed from Ipswitch Inc., Lexington, Mass. Originally, users
of Banyan's Vines network operating system obtained TCP/IP
access from FTP Software Inc., but Banyan, Westborough, Mass.,
switched to Ipswitch last year (CommWeek, Jan. 23, 1995)

"I like it so far," said John Herzog, network and information
center coordinator for Silicorp Ltd., Toronto. The company
is in the process of migrating directly from the FTP software
to the Ipswitch software, and is running it on 20 workstations,
planning to expand that to 300 this month, he said. "We're
about to try it out on the Internet. Corporately, it's solving
all of our needs."

The software has been rewritten to offer a 32-bit kernel, TCP
IP stack and applications, said Jeff Bernard, director of enterprise
marketing. This means that the software now works with Windows
95, he said. But the software is backwards-compatible with
16-bit applications, both from the previous version of the
Ipswitch product and with the FTP product, Bernard said.

In addition, the TCP/IP applications can run on the TCP/IP stack
built into Windows 95, Bernard said. In the next three months,
the company will release an Internet Protocol client that will
let network administrators integrate the Vines desktop with
TCP/IP services so only TCP/IP leaves the desktop, he said.
Ordinarily, Vines communications use Vines/IP, which is based
on TCP/IP, but is not compatible with it.

Other new features include IMosaic, a World Wide Web browser,
he said. "It is integrated, which makes it very easy for people
to get a well-supported product from us that leverages the
Internet."

The software now includes support for the Dynamic Host Configuration
Protocol, which lets organizations share TCP/IP addresses through
dynamic configuration.

In addition, the software's VT320 emulation has been enhanced
to support The Santa Cruz Operation Inc.'s American National
Standards Institute terminal emulation, Bernard said. The software
is compatible with the industry-standard Winsock 1.1 application
programming interfaces, giving developers a standard way to
communicate with TCP/IP protocol stacks from Windows applications.
Winsock 2.0 will be supported when that specification is final,
Bernard said.

The software also is easier for network administrators to install
on multiple PCs, he said. Previously, the applications needed
to be installed individually on each PC from a floppy disk.
With the new version, the software can be installed from a
CD on the server to all the PCs simultaneously.

The software is available now. Prices start at $4,995 for a
50-user pack.

Banyan can be reached at http://www. banyan.com or 508-898-1000.

New UnixWare on Tap

By:
Evan Schuman

As officials of Unix's new owners-The Santa Cruz Operation Inc.
prepare for their first merged version of the operating system,
two new versions of UnixWare, formerly owned by Novell Inc.,
and SCO's OpenServer are in the wings and will start shipping
in volume in a matter of weeks.

The main attribute of the new version of UnixWare, code-named
"Eiger," which Novell had been calling UnixWare 2.1, is that
it will start integrating NetWare features, such as native
NetWare 4.1 file, print and directory services. This is meant
to let NetWare clients access files and printers via a UnixWare
server as if that server were running NetWare.

Gianfranco Enrico, the chief architect and architecture director
for Ing. C. Olivetti and Co. SpA, a Unix OEM, said he considered
the inclusion of the NetWare features to be essential. "We
expect it really will become standard for any Unix offering
to have NetWare services," he said.

Bob Sprowls, Unix OEM Unisys Corp.'s director of server marketing,
said his company's priorities were different from Novell's,
and the resultant release shows it. Novell's "goal was not
Unix, but was bringing in the NetWare stuff," he said. "Our
interest was more in enhancing the overall Unix environment."

Speedier Version

Other than NetWare features, the new version of UnixWare will
be slightly faster. Michael DeFazio, Novell's senior vice president
of development for the company's operating systems division,
estimated that the new version would be about 5 percent to
10 percent faster. Scott McGregor, SCO's senior vice president
for products, agreed with DeFazio's estimate for likely end
user impact but said the enhancements will be more dramatic
for OEMs performing benchmarking.

The next version of the operating system also supports some
of the newer disk drives and graphics cards and has a new C++
compiler.

A traditional sore spot with Unix licensees historically has
been pricing and licensing terms. Although OEMs generally say
Novell has done a far better job with licensing than its predecessor,
AT&T, SCO has nonetheless established a different pricing structure
with next month's release of Eiger.

The pricing change is "to make it more in line with OpenServer
pricing," said SCO's Jeff Ait, a vice president in charge of
the transition. Asked why Santa Cruz, Calif.-based SCO didn't
wait for the merged release to change pricing details, he said
the changes made market sense, regardless of the operating
system's sale.

SCO will be charging extra for various licensed capabilities,
which have not been offered before.

One OEM who was briefed said the changes involve moving away
from some of the unlimited number of user licenses Novell offers
to pricing determined by the number of users. "There are situations
where buying UnixWare will now be cheaper and situations where
it will now be more expensive," the OEM said.

With OpenServer's new version-code-named "Comet" and likely
to ship about 30 to 60 days after Eiger ships-the most significant
improvement is an increase in the maximum amount of RAM supported,
to 4 gigabytes from 512 megabytes.

"A lot of people who use large databases are concerned about
the amount of memory," McGregor said. "If you're a customer,
you just really want to know that you're not going to run out
of gas," he added.

IBM Support Uncertain for Warp Connect

By:
MARCIA A. JACOBS

IBM's commitment to the PowerPC version of its Warp Connect
operating system software is waning. The company missed its
year-end "shipment" date and announced a complex ordering plan.

The product's lateness and the uncertainty about exactly which
features of Warp Connect made it into the PowerPC version have
users and analysts questioning the need for it.

"I don't think the market cares anymore,'' said Tom Kurcharvy,
an analyst at Summit Strategies Inc., Boston. "IBM did more
to destroy momentum for the PowerPC than any company ever did.''

George Szatckowski, senior technical support specialist at the
Chicago railroad company Metra, agreed. "At the moment, we
have no PowerPCs. There are no specific plans for it.'' The
company uses Unix for its high-end graphics programs and doesn't
see any reason to switch.

Would-be Warp Connect PPC users must order custom machines for
desktops or servers from IBM.

At least one user cited scalability as a need for Warp Connect
PPC. "I'm definitely interested from the perspective of having
a more scalable architecture,'' said Arlene Allen, assistant
director of information systems at the University of California
at Santa Barbara.

IBM said Microsoft Windows applications that run on Warp will
run on Warp Connect PPC, but Warp applications must be recompiled
first. Kurcharvy said that if Warp Connect PPC only runs Windows
applications, the need for buying Warp Connect PPC does not
exist because Microsoft Windows NT already runs on the PowerPC
(CommWeek, May 15)

Warp Connect for the PowerPC will be priced the same as Warp
Connect, which retails for $299 with Windows included, and
$229 without the upgrade.

IBM can be reached at http://www.ibm.com or 800-426-4968.

Microsoft Hones In on IP

By:
AMY ROGERS

In hindsight, 1995 may be regarded as the year that TCP/IP hit
the big time.

This is due in no small part to Microsoft Corp.'s bundling of
a TCP/IP protocol stack into its Windows 95, thus making the
protocols upon which the Internet operates widely available.

Last year, many users opted to run Microsoft's less-sophisticated
Internet Protocol stack to save themselves the hassle of substituting
another vendor's stack. The Windows 95 "stack is not elegant,
but it works," said Doug McDonald, a technical services manager
in the MIS department at Rogue Valley Medical Center, Medford,
Ore.

But, he added, "it doesn't have all the applications that NetManage
or Frontier or WRQ has."

Last year, traditional stack vendors, such as NetManage Inc.
and WRQ, started focusing on creating value-added applications
that run equally well on their own stacks and over Microsoft's.

For example, NetManage, Cupertino, Calif., said it would provide
software to let users access extra bandwidth for running applications.

Frontier Technologies Corp., Mequon, Wis., bundled a suite of
TCP/IP applications with its CyberJunction gateway, which converts
Novell Inc.'s Internetwork Packet Exchange protocol into TCP
IP for running network utilities and for Internet access.

TGV Software Inc., Santa Cruz, Calif., upgraded its MultiNet
for Windows by adding a feature that lets users choose among
various TCP/IP applications.

In many cases, Internet access is not the primary reason network
managers are rushing to implement stacks and applications.
In 1995, managers wanted stacks for file-sharing applications,
to send and receive electronic mail and to access host data
via terminal emulation.

As these managers turned elsewhere for TCP/IP applications,
theyhad to integrate a mix of vendors' applications, while
other users have begun to sample Microsoft's own IP utilities.

Jeff Matchan, a systems support specialist for the Los Angeles
Philharmonic Association, said he replaced Microsoft's Internet
Explorer with Netscape Communications Corp.'s Net-scape Commerce
Server for economic reasons. "We get [Commerce Server] free
because we are a non-profit organization," he said. "With Internet
Explorer, I'd have to buy a license for each workstation."

Matchan said he could not access a Hewlett-Packard Co. Unix
based server with LAN WorkPlace for DOS, a TCP/IP package from
Novell Inc., with Windows 95 running. Instead, he used the
Telnet application included in the Microsoft stack

Translation Feature on Its Way -- Hypercom to bundle legacy
TCP gateway into routers and FRADs

By:
AMY ROGERS

Hypercom Network Systems Inc. is bundling a protocol-translation
feature into its routers and frame-relay access devices this
month to help network managers trying to incorporate legacy
data into a TCP/IP LAN.

The feature, which is called Legacy/TCP gateway, will be bundled
into Hypercom's Integrated Enterprise Networking routers and
FRADs. The gateway interprets legacy protocols such as bisynchronous
or Systems Network Architecture in a TCP/IP format to give
users access to the Internet and other TCP/IP services.

Legacy interfaces correspond to their own TCP/IP sessions, eliminating
the need to encapsulate data in a non-native format, according
to officials at the Phoenix-based company. Thus, all legacy
based data arrives at the server as TCP/IP traffic.

"Each side sees data in its native form," said Dave Matusow,
lead SNA architect at Hypercom. "Routers take SNA data and
throw it into an IP frame and route it like any other traffic."

He said the problem with that approach is network managers may
experience TCP/IP session failures.

Legacy/TCP Gateway takes care of distributing sessions through
the enterprise to ensure that no node becomes overloaded. Consequently,
network management traffic is reduced, he said.

Legacy/TCP Gateway is already bundled into many Hypercom products.

Hypercom can be reached at 602-866-5399.

SMC Unveils Hub, Switch

By:
ERIC LACH

Standard Microsystems Corp. has announced a hub aimed at small
work groups and an Ethernet switch.

The six-port switch, called the EZswitch-6x, is designed as
a low-cost plug-and-play version of the company's TigerSwitch.
The switch provides simultaneous wire-speed Ethernet connections
on all ports, delivering 60 megabits per second of throughput
in half-duplex mode or 120 Mbps in full-duplex mode, said Jim
Colantropo, senior product marketing manager at SMC, Hauppauge,
N.Y.

The switch uses a crossbar switching matrix, which allows simultaneous
support of multiple packets across the switch. As many as six
switching paths can be established at a time, with each path
crossing two ports.

Of the six ports, five are RJ-45 10Base-T ports; one is a combination
AUI/TP/BNC 10-Mbps port.

SMC's new shared Ethernet hub, the EtherEZ Hub, comes in five
, eight- and 16-port configurations and costs about $25 per
port, said Mike Pellicone, SMC product marketing manager.

The EZswitch-6x sells for $1,199 and ships immediately. The
EtherEZ Hub, also available now, comes with five RJ-45 ports
for $125; or eight RJ-45 ports and one BNC port for $239; or
16 RJ-45 ports, one BNC and one AUI port for $499.

SMC can be reached at http://www.smc.com/ or 800-762-4968.

FCC OKs Sprint's European Plans

By:
JOHN RENDLEMAN

The FCC last month approved Sprint's alliance with France Telecom
and Deutsche Telekom AG, clearing the way for Sprint and its
European partners to begin offering business customers integrated
international voice- and data-communications services.

The FCC's approval of the venture eliminated the final U.S.
regulatory barrier to Sprint's plan to sell each of its European
partners a 10 percent equity stake in Sprint for a combined
total of between $3.5 billion to $4.2 billion and establish
a separate international-services joint venture.

Once established, the venture will benefit users by giving them
a single source for seamless voice and data connections between
the United States and international locations, although hurdles
remain before the three partners will be able to make their
plans a reality, users and analysts said.

Global Connectivity

"Anywhere you could get global connectivity from your local
provider would be a good thing," said Scott Cervenka, manager
of network services at Hartmarx Corp., a Chicago apparel maker.
Sprint may have some initial difficulties working with its
new partners, but "I'm sure that it's nothing that couldn't
be worked out eventually," Cervenka said.

"Sprint is doing this to bring its service portfolio up to par
with what MCI and AT&T already offer through their global partnerships,"
said Christine Heckart, director of broadband consulting at
TeleChoice Inc., a consultancy in Verona, N.J.

The Sprint venture resembles MCI Communications Corp.'s Concert
alliance with BT and AT&T's WorldPartners cooperative agreement
with a number of European and Asian carriers. It is intended
to give customers one contact for international voice and data
circuits, Heckart said.

"There is a definite market need among multinational companies
that want a single source provider of their communications
needs" to eliminate the cost of procuring and maintaining dissimilar
communications services from different providers around the
world, Heckart said.

The venture's first service offerings, expected to become available
to consumers early this year, will be integrated versions of
services already offered separately by each of the three partners,
said Stuart Mathison, assistant vice president of strategic
planning at Sprint International, Reston, Va.

The three companies have begun the integration process. They
said they plan to launch the services and announce features
and prices, as well as a name and logo for the venture, following
a Jan. 12 Sprint shareholder vote on the European partners'
equity investment in Sprint, Mathison said.

Alliance to Extend Data Services to Users

By:
MARK ROCKWELL

AT&T subsidiary AT&T Network Systems Inc. and Hewlett-Packard
Co. said they will develop software and hardware in a broad
marketing alliance that will help telephone and cable-television
providers extend broadband data services to users.

The alliance is expected to boost the capabilities of each company
to provide broadband data services and equipment to cable and
telephone companies. Products resulting from the alliance will
primarily target the consumer market, though there will be
some business applications.

According to AT&T Network Systems, the alliance is expected
to provide products for Internet access, home shopping, telecommuting,
interactive games, personal audio channel, distance learning,
interactive advertising and telemedicine in wired and wireless
environments.

The companies said they hope to develop a common network software
platform for interactive data networks, applications for that
platform, interactive television technology, network elements,
computing systems, test instruments, cable TV modems, network
management and software technologies.

Hardware, such as cable modems and high-speed network elements,
will be rolled out in the next six months, said Carly Fiorina,
president of AT&T Network Systems. In the next year, AT&T Network
Systems and HP plan to deliver head-end equipment for cable
and telephone companies that allows the two companies to manage
broadband services to business and residential customers.

"This is a very good sign. AT&T and Hewlett-Packard are legitimizing
the effort to bring broadband services to the home,'' said
Amy Reiber, a broadband consultant at TeleChoice Inc., a Verona,
N.J., consultancy.

Deal Targets Desktop Services

By:
MARK ROCKWELL

Aiming to offer more desktop communications services to a burgeoning
outsourcing market, Ameritech and IBM have teamed up to sell
each other's services to their existing customers.

Together, the companies are vying for a piece of the estimated
$33 billion global outsourcing market, especially in the areas
of integrated voice and video services and support.

"There's a lack of voice and video integration,'' said Sam Pomazano,
a vice president at IBM's subsidiary Integrated Systems Solutions
Corp. (ISSC)

"Customers need convergence help,'' said Jack Wright, president
of custom business services at Ameritech.

The two companies formed an alliance recently to market integrated
voice, video and data services, providing customers with a
single point of contact for desktop-based communications. The
seven-year agreement will first extend the outsourcing capabilities
to existing ISSC and Ameritech customers.

A selection of equipment and services will be available to telecommunications
managers through the alliance, such as PCs, software and videoconferencing
equipment and service.

IBM's ISSC subsidiary will work with Ameritech to manage Ameritech's
desktop computing and LAN requirements. Ameritech will provide
ISSC with voice and video desktop-support services for sites
throughout the country, Ameritech and ISSC officials said.

Internet Scanner Ported to Win NT

By:
Karen Rodriguez

Internet Security Systems Inc. has announced plans to ship a
version of its Internet Scanner software for systems running
Microsoft Windows NT, providing users with a tool to detect
weak security links in their Internet-connected networks.

Employing the same techniques used by hackers to penetrate large
corporate networks, ISS' Internet Scanner will detect up to
130 network vulnerabilities, including those found on PCs running
Microsoft Windows NT and Windows 95.

ISS said it plans to provide in mid-1996 a version of its software
that runs on Windows NT servers. Scanner runs on major Unix
platforms and the Linux operating system, and is priced according
to the number of devices in the network. It ranges from $800
for a small network to $80,000 for 10,000 devices.

The currently shipping version 3.2 of Internet Scanner gives
network administrators more control over all local and remote
PCs. Such nodes are often the sites in a network from which
hackers gain access to corporate network resources, said Chris
Klaus, founder and CEO of ISS, Norcross, Ga.

"Our focus on Microsoft holes stems from our understanding that
the weakest link on a network is often the common PC," Klaus
said.

Scanner Specifics

Scanner is a diagnostic tool that simulates Internet hacker
attacks, similar to the highly publicized Security Administrator
Tool for Analyzing Networks software that is available free
on the Net. But, as a commercial product, Scanner is supported
and regularly updated with detections for newfound vulnerabilities.

Scanner directly tests for Internet Protocol spoofing; firewall
checks, such as source porting; and other risks to Web servers.
It also tests for mail security holes and vulnerabilities in
X-Windows, as well as access to Network File System and brute
force break-in attempts.

The tool automatically tests a network and generates a report
that can be viewed by a Web browser with links to patches and
references to Computer Emergency Response Team advisories and
other software solutions.

"We use Scanner as a diagnostic tool," said George Kurtz, data
security consultant at Price Waterhouse's Management Consulting
Group in Morristown, N.J. "It's been a real big help. It's
comprehensive and Chris Klaus is always looking for the latest
vulnerabilities and immediately building them into the product.
There is no lag time between discovery and update."

Scanner can be used in tandem with firewalls and other packet
filtering devices to ensure they are configured correctly and
remain current with the latest security measures.

"As a sanity check, administrators should be running these tools
against their firewalls for an overall security check. If there
are any holes, you can bet a hacker will find out," Kurtz said.

He added that in their zeal to connect to the Net, many companies
neglect to define a security policy or firewall implementation,
which can lead to break-ins despite efforts to put the best
security measures in place.

ISS can be reached at http:// iss.net or 404-441-2531.

Hummingbird Enhances Columbus Software

By:
KAREN RODRIGUEZ

Hummingbird Communications Ltd. will broaden its intranet strategy
by integrating advanced portable document technologies into
its Columbus suite of Internet/intranet software.

By adding Common Ground Software Inc.'s suite of document authoring,
management and collaborative documentation-development technologies,
acquired in late December with its $6 million purchase of Common
Ground, Hummingbird will be better positioned to help its users
build their internal distributed networks using the Internet.

"Common Ground's electronic-document technology offers more
than just document authoring and archiving tools-it provides
organizations with a highly functional platform for information
management and workplace collaboration," said Fred Sorkin,
chairman, president and CEO of Hummingbird, Toronto.

Hummingbird had licensed Common Ground's technology for inclusion
in Columbus, Hummingbird's intranet/Internet desktop suite
for PCs. Common Ground 2.0, which will be integrated into Columbus
and ship Jan. 15, includes a platform-independent, electronic
portable document technology that competes with Adobe Systems
Inc.'s Acrobat. It also contains a collaborative document-authoring
environment, intranet/World Wide Web publishing and archival
tools, and utilities that enable legacy documentation to be
converted easily to a portable electronic-document format for
enterprise-wide distribution.

Columbus is expected to cost between $150 and $300 per desktop.
Initial versions will run on Microsoft Windows 3.11 clients;
versions for Win 95 and Win NT will follow later in the year.

A personal Web server has been built into Columbus to let users
in the intranet create their own home pages, as well as an
intelligent agent that automatically collects information within
the company.

Additional technologies available include Common Ground's Web
publishing system that includes a batch-file-format converter
for moving legacy documents onto the Web.

Common Ground, Belmont,Calif., pioneered the electronic-document
technology market with the release of Common Ground 1.0 in
1993.

Hummingbird can be reached at 416-496-2200.

Ganymede Lets Its Chariot Ride

By:
RUTRELL YASIN

Network managers looking for a way to determine how their client
server applications will have an impact on network performance
should find what they are seeking with a product from Ganymede
Software Inc.

The start-up has launched Chariot, a software tool that lets
network operators simulate application data traffic on their
networks, letting them gauge the effect an application will
have on the network before deploying it.

The emergence of such technologies as frame-relay and asynchronous
transfer mode (ATM) have prompted network managers to search
for tools that can handle a variety of performance- analysis
duties, the Research Triangle Park, N.C., company said. Network
managers and vendors are using a combination of products-modeling
tools, Remote Monitoring software and frame generators-to test
performance, said Steve Joyce, vice president of marketing
at Ganymede.

Beta testers said Chariot will complement their traditional
testing and analyzer tools because it gives them a way to measure
the end-to-end performance of complex networks.

Performance Evaluation

North Carolina's Microelectronics, Communications and Networking
Center, an interoperability testing lab in Research Triangle
Park, is using Chariot to evaluate the performance of its ATM
network. With its ATM infrastructure, MCNC is providing a way
for customers and vendors to evaluate high-speed networking
technology and applications.

"We're trying to see what happens to applications running in
an ATM" network that typically has voice, video and data running
across it, said Nancy Agosta, director of MCNC's Center for
Network Testing Services.

Chariot consists of an IBM OS/2-based console and end points
that reside on OS/2 or Microsoft Windows 95-based client workstations.

Chariot will be available at the end of the month. Pricing starts
at $11,000.

Ganymede can be reached at 919-558-1138.

Clientele Boosts Wares -- Help-desk features enhance suite of
automation tools

By:
BETH DAVIS

Clientele Software Inc. expanded its suite of automation tools
by adding help-desk capabilities.

The company, formerly known as AnswerSet Corp., has added Clientele
IS, a software package that builds on its flagship product,
Clientele, combining asset management and problem resolution
with Clientele's call-tracking and management capabilities,
the Tualatin, Ore., company said.

Kevin Roberts, MIS director at Clark, Klein and Beaumont plc,
a Detroit law firm, said he originally bought Clientele a year
ago "because of its flexibility and ability to be molded into
your environment.''

Because Clientele was designed to support external customers,
Roberts tweaked it to fit his internal IS department. In the
past month, however, Roberts said he has been impressed with
the new software. "I think they did a better job than I did,''
he said.

Dale Wetzelberger, operations manager for Baltimore-based Aerotech
Inc., said he chose Clientele/IS to support the approximately
1,500 employees working for the personnel and temporary placement
firm because it's easy to customize.

The software maintains a list of preferred products, services
and vendors. It also processes and tracks new equipment orders
and converts received orders to registered inventory. Assets
can be identified by pre-defined categories, such as serial
number, asset number or user.

Call-tracking features enable incoming calls to be assigned
to specific support representatives or user-defined groups,
which can represent physical location or other attributes.

Running under Microsoft Windows on a PC platform, the software
costs $3,495 and includes three concurrent user licenses, training
and one year of support and maintenance. It is available now.

Clientele Software can be reached at 503-598-4500.

Management Insight: RESOLUTIONS? BAH, HUMBUG! HERE'S AN ENTERPRISE MGM'T 
WISH LIST INSTEAD

By:
Rick Sturm

Now that the holiday season is behind us, most of us are looking
forward to the new year. It's the time to set goals and make
resolutions. I won't make my New Year's resolution here, but
I do submit a wish list for things I would like to see happen
in the world of management in 1996.

First, as many people are thinking about peace, I add a much
more modest wish. The acrimony and divisiveness that emerged
last year around the SNMPv2 issue has been appalling and incredibly
destructive. Not only have friendships been ruined, but many
other Simple Network Management Protocol-related efforts have
been stalled pending resolution of this issue, and the effectiveness
of the entire Internet Engineering Task Force standards process
has been called into question. So, the first item on my wish
list is for peace within the SNMP community.

The second item is very closely related to the first. I would
like to have a secure, effective way to control and configure
devices remotely on a network. I don't care if you call this
solution SNMPv2. All I care about is getting this ability as
soon as possible.

Next, I'd like to see the major vendors of management software
declare a moratorium on the acquisition of independent companies.
The current trend in the industry is for larger companies to
wait for someone to develop a new product and then buy it.
This approach carries far less risk than attempting to develop
something new. On the other hand, it seems a little like cheating
on an exam in school.

I would also like to see the platform vendors agree on a common
set of application progamming interfaces for their products.
This would allow third-party developers to develop and introduce
products more quickly and at a lower cost.

My fifth wish is that all of the major platform vendors participate
in the Enterprise Management Shoot-Out at the Enterprise Management
Summit. This is the one concrete way in which they can allow
users to compare their products in an objective environment.

Finally, I want people to understand better the issues of network
and systems management. First, I'd like to have the end users
understand it, so they can be more realistic in the demands
they place on operations. Second, I'd like for middle and upper
management to raise their levels of awareness so they can make
higher-quality decisions about funding network and systems
management.

I do not limit this just to users. I would like to see people
on the vendor side have a better grasp of these issues, too.

Each area is important and each of us can have an impact on
them. I plan to do all that I can in those areas and hope that
you will as well.

Rick Sturm is a principal at San Francisco's Enterprise Management
Institute Inc., dedicated to advancing enterprise management
through education and research. He also has been extensively
involved in network and systems planning at one of the Bell
operating companies. The opinions expressed are his own. He

Editorial: MIDDLEWARE TO BOOST APP SMARTS IN '96


There's ample evidence to support the contention that 1996 may
be the year network applications finally get some needed smarts.

And middleware will be the magic pill that's going to boost
application intelligence. Middleware is the first incarnation
of component software-the application model the industry is
slowly moving toward.

Middleware solutions will provide the glue companies will need
to design and build applications that are integral to a new
dynamic computing model.

Over the course of last year we saw such vendors as Sun, IBM
and Microsoft lay out their middleware and object strategies.

Last fall, Sun began shipping its Network Enterprise Objects.
NEO relies on Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA),
the industry-standard way for objects to communicate across
the network. The NEO platform includes OpenStep, an object
oriented development environment to build clients that can
access CORBA services or CORBA objects running on the server;
and Java, which can provide a client front end for NEO/CORBA
business objects running on the server.

IBM is a member of the Object Management Group, which promises
to support CORBA with its system object model and future distributed
system object model products.

IBM has also detailed plans to integrate its own asynchronous
messaging product, MQSeries, with several of its products.

Microsoft's approach centers on Object Linking and Embedding
(OLE), which has had a desktop-centric view of the world. Network
OLE, however, which is Microsoft's version of the Open Software
Foundation's DCE RPC, is expected sometime in 1997. It will
provide distributed features to OLE.

There's also ample evidence that distributed applications will
change the way we do business. We're beginning to see a glimpse
of this in the way access to corporate networks has been affected
by the Internet.

With asynchronous, store-and-forward technologies and distributed
objects, the need for expensive, full-time server-to-server
connections has diminished and the move toward smarter applications
is a given. Increasingly, the presence of middleware on enterprise
networks is becoming the norm.

With its adoption, the structure of the network will undergo
a healthy change, one that will allow it to mirror the way
people work.

Inside Perspective: NETWORK MANAGERS FACE A CHALLENGING YEAR

By:
Chris Roeckl

Like me, many of you probably spent the past couple of weeks
cleaning up your office, preparing for the new year. After
all, the end of December seems to be the only time in the networking
business when things slow down.

You also may have spent some time contemplating what this year
will bring in terms of new products and services that will
help make designing, implementing and managing your enterprise
network and the network applications that ride on that network
easier.

Certainly, many products will be delivered. We'll play our role
in helping you find them, as well as track the trends that
affect your business.

For example, the lines separating many technologies continue
to blur. There's been talk about the convergence of networking
and computing technology for years, where industry nirvana
amounts to the networked multimedia desktop. In the past couple
of years, major progress has been made to bring these technologies
together.

Such developments necessitate that companies take a team approach
when buying technologies. No longer can a network manager be
isolated from client/server applications developers or vice
versa.

Further, technologies within the enterprise network infrastructure
itself continue to become muddled. Thus, the decision about
whom to partner with for an array of networking equipment becomes
more difficult.

Layer on top of this trend the Internet and things really start
to get confusing. The Internet is changing the way companies
think about how they conduct their businesses. And beyond the
frenzy of preparing for electronic commerce, smart companies
are realizing that the structure of the Internet is suitable
to their business models; hence, the rise of the corporate
"intranet."

The Internet also stands to turn the telecommunications market
upside down, as companies begin to view the Internet as a viable
vehicle for handling network traffic that had been the sole
domain of traditional telephone companies using private leased
lines.

This comes at a time when the telecom industry is going through
significant change. While Congress tries to break up the remaining
monopoly of the local loop, the phone companies and local regulators
are working at the state level to bring competition into the
local services market.

These are just a few of the major areas that are reshaping the
world we work in today. So, if you were expecting your job
to get a little easier in 1996, it won't. Indeed, it will probably
be more difficult than ever.

What's different from years past, though, is that corporate
management is now fully cognizant of the importance of the
enterprise network. This puts the corporate network manager
in the spotlight.

We're aware that critical decisions can make or break the career
of a corporate network manager. That's why we take our job
of helping you make the right choices so seriously.

I wish you the best of luck in 1996.

Letters to the Editor: ISDN EVERYWHERE



Your article "ISDN Links Get Coded" has shed a glimmer of hope
on our efforts to make ISDN as "easy" to use as possible [CommWeek,
Dec. 4]

We are an Internet-service provider in the process of testing
ISDN connectivity in hopes of being able to offer this service
within the first quarter of 1996.

We are going to be performing many tests on installation procedures,
equipment configuration, software configuration and the whole
process of ordering ISDN. It is our hope that the lessons learned
through this exercise will let us set up a template and guidelines
for our clients interested in Internet connectivity via ISDN.

This has not been an easy task. Fortunately, our phone company
(Nynex) has changed its ISDN division management and is now
actively supporting ISDN requests and installations in its
service area. It has been very forthcoming in helping us establish
a test platform for its service.

I am confident that with Nynex's help, we will be able to jump
the ISDN hurdle and get this service up and running.

Letters to the Editor: BEHIND THE TIMES



I read with interest your story about Infonet Software Solutions
Inc.'s Messenger 400 and its ability to support message archiving
["MTA Archives Mail Messages," CommWeek, Dec. 11]

In fact, Messenger 400 is far down the power curve in its support
of archiving. Innosoft International Inc.'s PMDF message-transfer
agent has included message archiving for several years and
several of my consulting clients, including CGnet Services
and the Executive Office of the President, have used this feature
with great success. The latter, in fact, is using message archiving
specifically to support the requirements of the National Archives
and Records Administration mandate-since they were the agency
that originally brought this issue to the public eye.

Letters to the Editor: GETTING THE MESSAGE OUT


I just read the excellent editorial in CommunicationsWeek [Perspective,
"The Internet Phone Is Poised to Conquer," CommWeek, Dec. 11].
I could not agree with you more.

I wish this piece would somehow get into the "old media" to
wake up the rest of the world. The Internet has given the common
person the "fire of the gods" and I hope it will indeed change
the world for the better.

Joe Zuccaro

I found your article interesting. I had thought Howard Bubb
[CEO and president of Dialogic Corp.] or Mitel Corp. would
have led the way and made the concept and market mature. I
see that Micom Communications Corp. has the closest thing to
something practical along these lines. The stuff you talk about
will happen.

Fortunately, Microsoft Network, America Online, CompuServe and
Prodigy will still have to compete with the small POP.

Letters to the Editor: MISSING THE MARK


You have missed the point [Rash's Judgment, "The World According
to Gates: Universal Access and the Benefits of the Internet,"
CommWeek, Dec. 4]. The reason there is no detail is that up
until now, Microsoft was pursuing a proprietary (again) solution
to Internet business, the Microsoft Network. Not until they
realized they missed the mark by a long shot did the tone change
at Big Blue, er, Redmond.

Gates has been hammered lately by those who fail to bow to his
Redmondship and their "steal-anything-at-all-cost" philosophy.
Faced with an Internet marketplace where innovation is king,
Microsoft has a lot of catching up to do.

Gates impresses people with his power and money, especially
media types. Just take a look at the millions of dollars of
free publicity he got for that sophomoric fiasco called the
Windows 95 launch. The media ate that up like candy. Too bad
most of them know nothing about what Microsoft technology really
does and doesn't do.

This mail is being sent from a Windows 95 workstation. In spite
of the horsepower I have (100-megahertz Pentium), it is dog
slow. The interface is clumsy, and in no way comparable to
my other computer, my Apple Macintosh Quadra. If I had to send
you an attached document from this mail station, the non-Multipurpose
Internet Mail Extension-compliant Microsoft Mail would automatically
"un-encode" the software, forcing you to run it through a binary
converter so you could read it. I have no options to turn that
nonsense off.

Thank heaven they don't force me to go through the Microsoft
Network to get to the Internet. I would quit.

Microsoft is good at selling to the masses. I would guess they
spend more as a percentage on marketing than on research and
development. It's too bad their products are second-rate, clear
across the board.

Bill Gates is definitely not the person to lead us boldly forward.
He misguessed the Internet and is back-filling. This industry
is driven by demand and competition, not by self-appointed
pundits.

THE CHANGING ROLE OF THE NETWORK MANAGER -- As networks become
strategic corporate assets, business savvy becomes key to most
managers' success

By:
MARGIE SEMILOF

Sure, the network is still what matters most. But traditional
network managers are learning that business acumen, not technical
know-how, now holds the key to their future success.

Almost overnight, the information industry's computer fixation
has shifted from the desktop to the network. Along with this
metamorphosis comes a number of major changes for those charged
with developing the corporate computing infrastructure.

"I come from the days when Mr. Fixit was all anyone needed,"
says Anthony Iorio, director of telecommunications at ITT Corp.,
New York. "Today, my technical expertise is not as important
as knowing how to negotiate or whom to call if I need some
outside help."

Iorio's new role reflects the business changes taking place
at his company. As ITT splits into three companies this month,
Iorio's job will be transformed as well. In the past, Iorio
was responsible for hands-on development for a corporate telecommunications
network that incorporated the ITT Hartford insurance company,
the ITT Industries defense contractor and the corporate headquarters
owner of the Sheraton Hotels and Caesar's World casinos.

Wheeling and Dealing

Increasingly, Iorio is more of a deal maker, managing and negotiating
corporate contracts for the parent company. He also evaluates
new technologies before they are introduced into the corporate
architecture, and he's not alone in his new responsibilities.

As in the past, Iorio and other network managers still must
deliver 100 percent uptime, but their bigger challenge is marrying
applications to business processes when the technology itself
is a fast-moving target.

In addition, managers must explain the vast amount of technology
innovation to senior managers, who read about networking in
just about every magazine and hear about it every time they
turn on the television.

It's not easy to make a business case for, say, Lotus Notes,
when executives read that these technologies could be obliterated
by something called the World Wide Web.

Despite the upheaval, network managers are making their mark
on business. In an October 1995 study conducted by Valley Forge
Information Services, a Langhorne, Pa., market research firm,
80 out of 100 corporate network managers said they have a direct
influence on the business strategy of an organization.

The same study puts about 18 percent of network managers in
the executive tier of management in their companies.

And with the cost of failure higher than ever, change management
means balancing interest in new products and services with
the need to make firm decisions about technology directions.

"We need to be shrewd about what we choose to go with and what
is a passing fancy," says Colin Crook, senior technology officer
at Citicorp, New York.

For nearly four years, Crook has developed a global banking
network that makes increasingly intelligent devices available
to the bank's customers.

Although a rigid organizational model might be more comforting
to handle internal technology changes, the continually shifting
computer-industry landscape makes this nearly impossible. "The
World Wide Web didn't exist for us five years ago, and now
it's the hottest thing since sliced bread," Crook says.

Even though the full story of the Internet has yet to be told,
this late-blooming technology is largely responsible for showing
corporations new ways of connecting to internal users and external
customers.

Companies, such as Xerox Corp., are building Web sites as inexpensive
and easy ways to connect the company's far-flung employees
to a single, common bulletin board.

Other factors-most notably, the advent of truly distributed
computing-also are contributing to the network's ascent. And
though the actual price of technology stays about the same,
what $2,000 can deliver on a desktop keeps increasing.

"We have become indifferent to forms of computing, but we need
a network to help us put an application anywhere in the world,"
says John Hammit, a former CIO at United Technologies Corp.
in Hartford, Conn., and president of J. Hammit Group Inc.,
a Hartford consulting company.

Managers say they must nurture different skill sets compared
to what was required at the beginning of the decade. Business
planning once proceeded without technology input in most companies
but no more. Today, though network infrastructure experts may
not have moved any farther up the company flow chart, they
are deeply involved in the business-planning process.

What makes today's managers tick? Compared to five years ago,
there's added emphasis on working with multinational networks,
says Beverly Lieberman, president of Halbrecht Lieberman Associates,
a Stamford, Conn., search firm that specializes in hiring senior
information technology executives.

"This isn't just about working with others, culturally speaking,"
Lieberman says. "It's about getting work done-working with
carriers and overseas vendors." The nature of the job is more
complex than in the past.

Network managers typically have a degree or two in engineering
or computer science, but fewer than 10 percent have a master's
degree in business administration. But this may change as senior
executives demand their network staff become more business
focused-the MBA holds higher value.

Top managers are paid aggressively, Lieberman says. In a Fortune
200-size company, a top person in charge of the corporate network
infrastructure can earn $200,000 to $275,000, with a salary
bonus and stock options. Small-to-medium-size businesses will
pay about $100,000 to $150,000.

Although the network manager's position in the company hierarchy
hasn't changed much, the job has certainly ratcheted up in
importance.

"The infrastructure person is viewed as more front and center,
not back office," Lieberman says.

Though business skills are more highly prized than ever, technology
innovations over the past few years have altered the course
of career paths as well. Consider, for example, network outsourcing,
one of the biggest concepts in the 1980s that flip-flopped
in the 1990s.

A network manager five years ago would have made a buying decision
based purely on its cost benefit, choosing not to outsource,
even though vendors might have positioned it as a money-saving
measure.

Now, even if outsourcing turns out to cost more, a network manager
is just as likely to go for it.

A study conducted six years ago by Cimi Corp., a Voorhees, N.J.,
consulting company, polled 267 CIOs and found that only four
had outsourced some aspects of their information technology.
An updated survey this year revealed 121 out of the 267 CIOs
are now outsourcing.

What fuels this trend? No company will tolerate a network crash.
It was a shock to many managers when, in the mid-1980s, large
companies such as Merrill Lynch & Co. Inc. handed over all
of their telecommunications management to a carrier. Now outsourcing
is commonplace.

Outsourcing keeps staff sizes small, and though it may cost
more, the network manager can hold the outside party contractually
responsible for a certain degree of performance.

Bob Galovic, managing director of information resources at the
national headquarters of the Automobile Association of America,
Heathrow, Fla., was ahead of his time on this trend. He says
that for years, he preferred Centrex service to owning a PBX.
It was worth it to offload the daily grind of running an internal
phone system to someone else.

ITT's Iorio says he outsources most of his corporation's network
management functions. And John Hodge, CIO at NAC Reinsurance
Co., a Hartford insurer, says he outsources the management
of his legacy computing systems. Hodge also has taken steps
to compartmentalize network services, so, if necessary, he
can change a carrier or buy some specialized service, such
as fax or electronic mail, without a major restructuring. "This
job becomes a management of those services," Hodge says.

To Outsource or Not to Outsource

Of course, there is outsourcing, and then there is outsourcing.
Even where managers retain network control, outsourcing can
exist within a technology, like frame-relay, saving managers
the trouble of building a private multiplexed network.

In these cases, "you are essentially letting the carrier do
the multiplexing for you," says Thomas Nolle, president of
Cimi. "The corporate network is smaller, even though service
costs go up."

Network sustainability isn't the only thing dictating the buying
habits of network managers. Network spending also solves immediate
business requirements, Nolle says. In the past, spending on
the technical infrastructure tended to be more in anticipation
of future business needs.

If senior managers want to see a return on their investments,
technologies, such as asynchronous transfer mode, will be harder
to justify, unless the senior executive has a strong knowledge
of what ATM does. Network managers must provide that expertise.

And although network managers and CIOs in traditional information
system hierarchies balance technical innovation with business
need, in some industries there's a growing shift in political
power that can't be ignored.

Rebel Armies

Workgroup knowledge workers-historically leery of central technology
organizations, which they view as tyrannical and expensive
are seizing control of their own technologies.

"Populist technology is flourishing in an unprecedented manner,"
Nolle says. "One of the little-heralded effects in the shift
toward personal computing is that first-line managers have
purchase authority over computers without needing anyone to
sign off."

Today, many end-user organizations want to buy and roll their
own applications. A CIO or network manager is often not in
a good position to set technical policy if numerous departments
in a multinational company are running their own show.

"We see the CIO as holding the coalition together," Nolle says.
"It's very Eisenhower-esque."

Local efforts are less likely to happen in industries with high
levels of transaction processing, such as retail, transportation
and utilities, says David Passmore, president of Decisys Inc.,
a Sterling, Va., consulting company.

"These companies still control networking from the top down.
Bank tellers don't aspire to be LAN managers," Passmore says.

Telecom's Role

Another consequence of the past five years is that in many companies,
the uproar over voice- and data-integration issues appears
to have subsided. Telecommunications and data communications
managers in the post-divestiture world assumed they would merge
under one collective umbrella.

But, again, the populist effect of downsizing technology makes
consolidation irrelevant in some cases. Since the evaluation
of new technology is often determined by budget, local departments
can easily afford a powerful PC that can do a number of complex
computing and networking tasks.

Carriers can sell services, such as AT&T's Network Notes, for
example, that take on the administration of Lotus Notes, or
they can buy Sprint's InfoXchange, which lets network managers
link their E-mail to a WAN without using a premises switch.
These products are a boon to local business departments, which
can-at least in theory-solve networking problems on their own
terms.

Although some product ideas have been hits, there are misses
as well. Local management of networks in many cases was more
successful than managing a network from a single console. Five
years ago, networking vendors were hawking a concept called
the "manager of managers," which included products, such as
AT&T's Accumaster Integrator, as a means of overseeing devices
throughout the enterprise.

These technologies were based on the assumption of a hierarchical
support structure that would require central management. Today,
line departments are buying LAN hubs for local activity and
managed by the department.

Some analysts and CIOs lament the fact that a decentralized
organization has less purchasing power and lacks a cohesive
plan. But there's an optimistic side to this scenario. Local
branches may spur innovation that could benefit the entire
corporation.

According to AAA's Galovic, his office sets a technical course
for 113 national clubs. But it's possible that a regional club
may choose to build something on its own.

"Our organization does not discourage a local club from doing
something different, but they need to know we have a core direction,"
Galovic says.

"If they fail at what they do, that's the risk they took. If
they succeed, maybe we have to jump on their bandwagon."

With this outlook, the network manager is surely entering a
new era.

TECHNOLOGY: WHAT'S ON THEIR MINDS?

By:
Margie Semilof

Ask 10 network managers their top technology picks for the next
three years and expect to get just as many answers.

There is some agreement, however. The Internet, asynchronous
transfer mode, multimedia, computer-telephony integration (CTI)
and mobile and wireless computing top most lists. Additionally,
truly distributed, object-based computing that goes beyond
the creation of a mere client/server architecture is on their
minds, as well.

And, they say, don't write off so-called "old" technology. Five
years ago the World Wide Web held little appeal and everyone
predicted the demise of the mainframe. Now, the mainframe still
endures and technologies like the Internet are taking off.

In no particular order, here is a sampling of technologies network
managers consider their priority over the next three years.

- The Internet-more specifically, the World Wide Web. Managers
of corporate infrastructure all agree that the Internet is
important, but are not yet sure how it can help them. In the
same breath, network managers say they want quantum improvements
to network security.

- High-speed networks. These are needed to support faster, low
cost multimedia on the desktop. The convergence of voice, data
and video will be assisted by the simultaneous introduction
of high-speed networks. Anthony Iorio, director of telecommunications
at ITT Corp., New York, says CTI and multimedia are key to
providing personalized services to guests at ITT's hotel and
casino operations.

"Today, if a guest calls in to a hotel 100 times we will have
no prior information about that person," Iorio says. "Using
one basic CTI application, if that guest calls in, a screen
can pop up and we will have all we need to know about that
person: what type of room they like, what type of services
they prefer."

- Object-based systems. Object technology lets corporations
speed the time it takes to build applications and therefore
respond quickly to market changes. Network managers will continue
to distribute computing-storing information where it can do
the most good-rather than consolidating information in one
host repository.

- Mobile communications. Mobile networks will serve thousands
of sales forces and telecommuting users, as well as those at
remote sites. The Automobile Association of America, Heathrow,
Fla., says it considers mobile and wireless technology to be
the basis for developing a vehicle locator and a primary means
of member-club communications.

HE'S IN THE DRIVER'S SEAT

By:
Margie Semilof

Not long ago pundits predicted the demise of telecommunications
managers. Word was that IS shops would absorb corporate telecommunications
and those who ran the voice networks would report to computer
network gurus.

Bob Galovic disproves the theory. The Automobile Association
of America's director of information resources crossed the
boundary from manager of voice services to corporate information
systems administrator, and now he's steering the course.

Galovic is a nine-year veteran of AAA, based in Heathrow, Fla.,
with previous telecommunications management experience at Procter
& Gamble Co., Cincinnati.

The reason for his success has to do with AAA's long-held view
that telecommunications is central to its internetworking strategy.
Before Galovic was hired, the nationwide AAA had not yet tied
together its 113 member clubs-an effort that began in the late
1980s when Galovic took an active role in building LANs using
10Base-T Ethernet.

Today Galovic oversees management of all PCs, software and data
center support, including legacy systems, voice systems and
data networking. The information systems staff now numbers
70

people.

"I don't claim to be a PC guru," says Galovic, who has a degree
in mathematics. "I just need to know enough to understand it.

"In the next few years, based on the changing needs of AAA,
our next round of activity will be looking at delivering core
business products and services to external customers," he says.

Technologies such as the Internet and new call-distribution
techniques will alter the way AAA communicates with its customers,
he says. The biggest challenge does not center on any one technology,
however. Rather, it's the management of change-knowing what
technologies to adopt and what roads to bypass.

"You need to keep creativity high but still adhere to some basic
principles," Galovic says. "We want to remain cost-effective
and present ourselves as a unified organization with consistent
high-quality products."

So far, it seems, he's driving AAA down the right road.

Industry Insight: Understanding the 'Net's Business Model

By:
Don Gooding

At Venture Market East, in the shadow of Harvard University,
dozens of entrepreneurs recently had an opportunity to tell
their stories to crowds of eager but skeptical financiers.
At each presentation the same question was raised by the suit
and-tie crowd: "What's your business model?"

Now, for any self-respecting MBA, this is practically question
No. 1.

The business model is the qualitative and quantitative answer
to a set of important, basic questions: Who are your customers?
How expensive and time-consuming is customer acquisition? How
much do they pay you? What are the profit margins?

In the brave new world of the Internet, however, the answers
are not easy.

Internet business models are different from models of most existing
businesses, different this quarter from last quarter-and probably
next quarter.

For example, between Microsoft and Netscape, the traditional
desktop-software model has been trashed. Microsoft doesn't
sell desktop software-it is in the desktop-software upgrades
business, which is why Windows 95 was a seminal marketing event
for it. Netscape, too, is in the software-upgrades business,
and now is facing its first major test with Navigator 2.0.

Netscape also is in the server/client business: give away clients
to drive server sales. And Netscape, in its short life, has
moved quickly from being Internet-driven to being "intranet"
driven.

The Netscape business model is at least understandable. More
problematic for analytic types are Internet content companies.
Many entrepreneurs at the conference were in the "spaghetti
strategy" mode-throw a lot at the wall and see what sticks.
From the audience, the suits ask: "Will you get your revenue
from advertising, transaction fees, subscription fees, merchandising,
software sales, systems integration or custom development?"

Jane Webpreneur responds: "Yes."

These are not businesses that fit nicely onto a spreadsheet,
or at least a spreadsheet that converges on a single number
for internal rate of return (MBAese for investment profit)

Though content models are vexing today, the Internet Service
Provider (ISP) model was not altogether clear when we invested
in Uunet. It took a lot of experimenting and strategizing by
management and investors to reach the point where the company
could make a profit. Many ISPs are still refining their models.

All of the early Internet winners are led by management that
moves fast, is flexible, willing to experiment and can quickly
spot winning strategies and rapidly focus resources on what's
working.

Very few large companies are run on this people model. That's
why entrepreneurs will continue to dominate the Internet until
the business models settle down.

based venture-capital firm. He can be reached at DGOODING@ACCEL.COM

Xylan Moves on Fast Track

By:
JOHN T. MULQUEEN

The local-area switching market is hot. Just look at the success
of Xylan Corp. over the past 12 months.

The Calabasas, Calif.-based company only began shipping its
switching product early in 1995. To help bring it to market,
the vendor sold 10 percent of its stock to an OEM partner,
Alcatel Data Networks, Reston, Va., in March 1995 for $10 million.

Xylan followed up that distribution deal with OEM contracts
with Networks Systems Corp., Hitachi Inc. and Digital Equipment
Corp. as well as the rapid expansion of its own operations.

The result has been explosive growth for Xylan, which reported
$14 million in sales through the first nine months of 1995
but expects to close out its books for the year with almost
$28 million in sales, said Douglas Hill, director of marketing
and a Xylan founder.

Just as important, Hill said, Xylan will be profitable for the
fourth quarter, after running in the red for the first nine
months.

A few good profitable quarters built on top of rapid revenue
growth usually precedes an initial stock offering. For its
part, Xylan reportedly is talking with several top investment
banking firms about an initial public offering sometime early
this year.

William Becklean, a securities analyst at Hanover Institutional
Securities Inc., a Boston investment firm, said Xylan can be
compared with San Jose, Calif.-based Alantec Inc., another
switch vendor, to estimate Xylan's market value. For the year
ended Dec. 31, the publicly traded Alantec is expected to have
estimated earnings of $10.5 million on revenue of $52.5 million.
The company recently had a market valuation of 8.4 times revenue.

On that basis, Xylan might command a market valuation of about
8.5 times revenue, or about $240 million, Becklean said.

Another analyst, who asked to remain anonymous, said $240 million
would be a good starting point, but Xylan would probably want
a higher valuation.

During the last round of venture capital financing, Xylan was
valued at about $200 million and the company would probably
want "to kick up'' the valuation to more than $240 million,
the analyst said.

Troops Benefit From Key Software

By:
JOHN T. MULQUEEN

A small Pittsburgh company is supplying the U.S. Army with a
key piece of software and professional services to provide
support to American soldiers in Bosnia.

Carnegie Group Inc. has installed its Knowledge-Based Logistics
Planning Shell (KBLPS) at three U.S. Army sites in Germany
to analyze and recommend solutions for military supply problems
in Bosnia. KBLPS uses a Unix 2.4 operating system running on
Sun Microsystem Inc. Sparcstations connected primarily to Ethernet
LANs, a Carnegie spokesman said.

Carnegie, a 12-year-old systems integration and software-development
company, specializes in developing client/ser-

ver-based applications that work with existing computer systems.
Carnegie derives more than 90 percent of its revenue from providing
services. Carnegie also licenses a small amount of software,
which accounts for less than 10 percent of its revenue.

For the nine months ended Sept. 30, 1995, revenue was up 52
percent, to $19.1 million, compared with the same nine months
in 1994, largely because of an increase in software services,
which jumped 56 percent, to $17.9 million.

Most revenue from services came from an extension on a logistics
contract with the Defense Department and a contract with U
S West Communications Inc.

Carnegie has focused on the telecommunications, financial services,
manufacturing and defense markets. Its largest customers include
U S West, BellSouth Telecommunications Inc., Ford Motor Co.,
First USA Bank and the U.S. Army.

Ford is the largest shareholder in the company. Its 560,000
shares of common stock represent 9 percent of Carnegie's stock.
U S West owns 6.5 percent; Digital Equipment Corp. owns 5.6
percent and Texas Instruments Inc. owns 5.4 percent.

In November Carnegie raised $10.6 million in its initial public
offering, consisting of 2 million shares. The company sold
1.5 million of the shares and officers and other investors
sold the remaining 500,000 shares. The offering share price
was $8.

Scopus Builds Help-Desk Operations

By:
JOHN T. MULQUEEN

Scopus Technology Inc. has rapidly built a business of selling
software that can be used for enterprise-wide help-desk operations,
to support sales and marketing operations and to automate product
design.

Revenue more than doubled to $12 million from $5.4 million for
the six months ended Sept. 30, compared with the same period
in 1994, which is close to the $15.25 million revenue Scopus
reported for all of fiscal 1994.

Scopus' product line consists of three applications packages
 SupportTeam, to handle customer support; Quality Team, for
product design; and SalesTeam, to handle marketing and sales
automation. Other modules and tools are responsible for communications,
data replication or customization of applications.

Prices of the application packages range from $12,000 to $120,000
per server and from $3,000 to $3,500 per user. Other modules
and tools are priced from $3,000 to $20,000.

Scopus, Emeryville, Calif., is developing HelpDesk for internal
help-desk applications and as an extension to SalesTeam to
handle field sales forces. Both are due out the first half
of 1996.

Scopus' products run on standard networking operating systems
and relational database management systems, except for Informix
Software Inc.'s Informix. Support for Informix will be added
early this year, a spokeswoman said.

But Scopus faces increasing competition from various vendors
and has had to call on outside systems integrators and consultants
to help it with larger projects.

Outside contractors are expensive and Scopus was unable to pass
along all the costs to its customers. Gross margins on service
and maintenance revenue fell to 7 percent from 42 percent for
the six months ended Sept. 30, compared with the same period
the year before.

Overall, net income for the six months ended Sept. 30 was down
42 percent to $227,000 from the $388,000 reported in 1994.

Scopus has hired Joan Beardsley as senior director of professional
services to manage those outside contracts, a spokesman said.

Ward Off Virus Invasions -- Central House's MimeSweeper helps
isolate infected documents

By:
JEFFREY SCHWARTZ

Central House Technologies Inc. this week will unveil software
to help administrators prevent viruses from invading their
networks from the Internet and from external electronic-mail
services.

MimeSweeper scans message attachments for viruses and isolates
any E-mail with files believed to contain infected documents,
said Joe Rohde, president of Central House, Plymouth, Calif.
The company initially will ship MimeSweeper for Lotus cc:Mail
networks or any Internet E-mail system based on the Simple
Mail Transport Protocol.

Later releases of MimeSweeper will support Microsoft Corp.'s
Microsoft Mail and Novell Inc.'s GroupWise office-automation
software, according to Rohde. MimeSweeper runs on a Windows
NT server and is connected to an incoming message gateway by
scanning all attachments prior to routing E-mail within the
corporate network.

"If the message is OK it is routed to the post office, but if
it's infected the message is quarantined and the administrator
is alerted,'' Rohde said.

The software interfaces with most anti-virus scanning applications;
multiple programs can be invoked, he added.

E-mail networks are susceptible to network viruses and network
managers often hesitate to implement defensive measures in
their networks until after they are hit by a virus, said Mark
Levitt, an analyst at International Data Corp., a Framingham,
Mass., consulting company. Levitt said one drawback to using
MimeSweeper is that it does not support encrypted messages.

"If you and I use encryption, MimeSweeper will consider it a
suspect message,'' Levitt said. "Encryption is not widespread
today, but as more companies start using encryption, this could
be an issue.''

Rohde said Central House plans to support encryption in future
releases.

Available now, MimeSweeper is priced at $2,850 for the first
100 users and $650 for an additional 100 users.

Central House can be reached at 209-245-5900.

Case Ventura, Net Detective: Buyouts & Binges In the New Year



Noon was just a few minutes away when I reached my office. I
paused at the door and my eye fell upon a small brown parcel
left lying on the walk. As I bent to pick it up, I heard heels
clicking behind me on the sidewalk. Rita Telco and Belle Nomour
wheeled up to me, their faces distraught.

"You don't want to go in there.''

They were trembling like network managers with massive investments
in Vines. What's the problem, I wondered?

I already had had a lousy week. I hate New Year's because it
means I am another year older. Plus, I ate too much during
the holidays and my stomach was as shaky as Lotus' ship dates
for Notes 4.0.

There are other things on my mind. For instance, I heard that
Hewlett-Packard was finally bringing its NetServer management
tools up to snuff for OpenView. Today, a user can set performance
thresholds, but the system won't say anything is wrong unless
it is specifically asked about it. So what was the point of
having performance thresholds? The new version sends an alert
to the administrator, just as in the current Windows version.

And Oracle is expecting a mid-January release of Oracle Lite,
a database for mobile users. It will sell for only $99 and
be a preview of Oracle8 with its handling of new data types.
Oracle built this object/relational hybrid database from the
ground up.

My secretary, Lotta Memory, also said Novell will partner with
Aurora Systems to bring telephony features to Novell's GroupWise
office-automation software. It's likely that the software could
be one of the biggest hits at the Computer Telephony Expo in
March.

Aurora makes FastCall, a middleware platform used by most telecommunications
companies to bring telephony features to Windows applications.
At the same show, Applied Voice Technology, a company that
makes LAN-based messaging software, will release a slew of
unified messaging products.

Then there are the year's first buyout rumors. From the deserted
gin mills of Wall Street, Caseworkers said they overheard that
Netscape Communications wants to acquire FTP Software.

Netscape would get a TCP stack, access to some major FTP customers
and some substance to go with its $5 billion capitalization.

I suddenly realized Rita had a bottle of my favorite scotch
tucked under her arm. Belle took the brown package from my
arms.

"You won't find a buyer for Novell in there, Case.''

I put the key in the lock and turned it. My office door opened
and I was shocked at what was on my desk.

Rash's Judgement: MY EDITOR MADE ME DO IT: GUESSING WHAT'S HOT IN NETWORKING 
THIS YEAR

By:
Wayne Rash Jr.

Given the mind-boggling frenzy surrounding the Internet last
year, I'm not sure if it's safe to predict what might come
to communications in 1996. I don't think anyone foresaw the
magnitude of the Internet's impact. Yet one way or another,
it's affected nearly everything in networking.

On the other hand, one of the tasks we columnists are saddled
with by our editors is to predict the future accurately. This
being my first column of the new year, I'm discharging this
awesome responsibility as quickly as possible. Besides, that
way, by the end of the year, no one will remember whether I
was right or not.

In any case, some trends are obvious, even if some of the moves
haven't been played out yet. For example, it's pretty clear
that the entertainment industry and the information industry
are developing a real synergy. The deal between Microsoft and
NBC Television is only one example, although it's probably
one of the more spectacular.

By this time next year, you can expect to see a considerable
crossover between entertainment and the on-line world. Of course,
that's already happened, as anyone can see when television
programs start flashing Uniform Resource Locators on the screen
along with the credits. What's going to change is that much
more of the actual content will cross over, and it'll be much
more substantial material than just being able to replay David
Letterman's Top Ten list. In effect, both Cyberspace and television
will become adjuncts of the other, meaning that people will
have to access both to get the full range of information from
either.

This merging will continue in other areas as well, but not all
of them will be positive. For example, cable-television companies
will start making a real push to provide access and bandwidth
to the Internet. Ask yourself, though, if you're willing to
wait for long, undefined periods of time for the cable-repair
technician to arrive when your Internet connection is down.
I know that if I had to depend on the companies here in the
Washington, D.C., area to provide access, I'd probably never
get on the Internet again.

If the company you work for still doesn't have Internet access,
expect that to change. The existence of the vast quantity of
information to be found on the Net will create its own demand.
Many companies will find that such access is a competitive
necessity. Being cut off from this rapidly swelling pool of
knowledge will be like doing without a stock wire or a business
news service. You can do it only in industries where information
and timeliness don't matter. Outside of the government, I can't
think of any.

Network managers will also be expected to contribute to this
rising tide of content. For example, if you run the network
at your company, you can expect to be asked to start supporting
a server on the World Wide Web if you don't already. If you
have that job now, you can expect it to get bigger, bringing
along a new level of involvement to staffers working with everything
from router maintenance to security firewalls.

Because of these pressures, few network managers will be in
a position to resist the demands for greater connectivity.
And those network managers who find ways to manage this connectivity
effectively will find their positions growing in importance.
Many of those managers will be having a very good year, indeed,
by the time 1997 gets here. Many of their suppliers-everyone
from Internet service providers to on-line security specialists
will have a very good year, as well.

Now, just promise me you won't go back and read this next January
and tell me how short- sighted I was. Remember, my editors
made me do it.
