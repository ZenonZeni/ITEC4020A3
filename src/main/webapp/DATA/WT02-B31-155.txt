<FONT SIZE=+1><STRONG>Tips on Purchasing Life Insurance</STRONG></FONT><P>


Buying life insurance is not in the same category as getting a new car or spring wardrobe. 
It
is a lot
more complex and infinitely more important.  The primary reason individuals purchase life
insurance is
to protect the financial security of their loved ones.  It makes good sense then to use the
same care in
buying life insurance as you would when making any significant purchase.  
<P>

Before you begin your search for a life insurance policy, it is important to do some
preparation.  To help
you determine the amount of insurance you need, you should identify your dependents (this
may
include children, parents, spouse), your financial obligations and resources.  This way, in
the
event of
your death, your family will have the financial resources it needs to continue to run a
household.  An agent can help you find the right type and amount of insurance
for your
family's needs at an affordable price.
<P>
In addition, here are 10 things you should do to help you and your family make the most
appropriate life
insurance purchase:
<P>
<OL>
<P><LI>Make sure your agent and company are licensed to do business in your state.  Call your
state
insurance department if you are not sure.
<P><LI>Take your time.  Make sure you understand fully any policy you are considering and
that you are
comfortable with the company, agent and product.  Do not rush into a decision just because
you are
feeling pressured.  On the other hand, do not put off an important decision that protects
your
family.  If
you have any questions - ask!
<P><LI>Ask your agent if the company offers any "healthy lifestyle" discounts on your policy. 
For example,
nonsmokers can save from 10% to 20% on their premiums.  This discount can even apply to
ex-smokers if enough years have passed since quitting!
<P><LI>Do not omit any part of your medical history on your life insurance application.  If
you
do, the
company may be able to refuse coverage, deny a claim, or cancel the policy.
<P><LI>Read the insurance contract carefully and, if necessary, ask your agent for a
point-by-point
explanation of the language.  Insurance policies are legal documents and you should be
familiar with
what they promise, even though some technical terms are used.
<P><LI>Expect delivery of your life insurance policy within two weeks of purchase.  If it
does not
arrive,
contact the company for a written explanation.
<P><LI>Remember that you may have a 10-day "free-look" period that entitles you to change
your mind
about purchasing the policy.  If you do so, the company will return your premium, without
penalty.
<P><LI>Write the check for your insurance premium to the company, not the agent.  Be sure you
are given a
receipt.  Pay premiums annually or semiannually, rather than monthly or quarterly, if
possible.  That
way, the company saves money by billing you less frequently, and the savings are passed
on to you. 
(Also, look into "electronic" billing arrangements that authorize the insurance company to
automatically
withdraw premiums from your bank account.  This can relieve you of the burdensome task of
having to
write regular checks.)
<P><LI>Inform your beneficiaries about the kind, amount and location of any life insurance
policies you
own.  Keep your policy in a safe place at home and, in addition, keep your insurance
company's name
and your policy number in a safe deposit box.
<P><LI>Review your life insurance coverage at least once every two years to be sure it meets
your current
needs.  Be cautious if another agent or company contacts you and wants you to cancel your
current
policy to buy a new one.  Contact your original agent or company before making any
decisions. <P>
