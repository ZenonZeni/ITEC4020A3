South-West Victoria comprises Geelong, Warrnambool, Portland, Hamilton,
Colac, and surrounding districts.
The region also covers the fertile and renowned farming area known as
the 'western district'.

Geelong is the largest and most important industrial centre in South-West
Victoria.
The city of Greater Geelong is Victoria's second largest city and one of
Australia's most important industrial centres.
Geelong and the surrounding district has a population of about 201,000.

and manufacturing of vehicles, chemicals, metal products and textiles.
Increasingly, new industries are emerging in Geelong.

 Clarke's Pies is a fast growing company based in Mortlake, north
of Warrnambool. Clarke's employs 170 people and supplies a large
area. The Shire of Mortlake has plans to assist the company to
relocate onto an industrial estate so that Clarke's can meet its
export objectives.

contract to build Austops Parkes'NSW wool scouring building.
