         <BLOCKQUOTE><P><FONT SIZE=4>EMERYVILLE, CA (May 13, 1996) --
         SuperGen, Inc. (Nasdaq: SUPG &amp; SUPGW), a development
         stage pharmaceutical company, today reported financial
         results from the quarter ended March 31, 1996. Total
         operating expenses for the quarter decreased to $1,216,464
         in 1996 from $1,244,092 for the same period in 1995.
         Revenues were $10,047, compared to $73,499 in the same
         quarter last year. The net loss for the quarter was
         $1,158,960 ($0.09 per share), compared to $1,138,035 ($0.09
         per share) in last year's period. As of March 31, 1996,
         SuperGen had approximately $19,588,000 in cash and cash
         equivalents.</FONT>
         
         <P><FONT SIZE=4>During the quarter, SuperGen completed an
         initial public offering of 3,500,000 units (each consisting
         of one share of common stock and one warrant), which netted
         the company approximately $18,600,000. In April, 1996, the
         underwriter's exercise of its overallotment option resulted
         in additional net proceeds of approximately $2,900,000
         (which is not reflected in the currently reported cash
         balance).</FONT>
         
         <P><FONT SIZE=4>"The successful IPO was a significant
         financing milestone that allows us to proceed confidently in
         meeting our clinical and product development milestones,"
         said Joseph Rubinfeld, Ph.D., SuperGen's Chief Executive
         Officer. "We already have met two of those milestones in the
         beginning of the second quarter, with Phase II clearance for
         our obesity pill and Phase I clearance for our supergeneric
         MitoExtra."</FONT>
         
         <P><FONT SIZE=4>Based in Emeryville, CA, SuperGen is a
         development stage pharmaceutical company dedicated to the
         development and commercialization of products intended to

         portfolio of six generic products and five enhanced or
         "supergeneric" products. Blood cell disorder products under
         development currently target anemias associated with
         chemotherapy and radiotherapy, renal failure and aplastic
