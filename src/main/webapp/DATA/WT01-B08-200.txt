 </font> <font size=4 color=navy></CENTER><A NAME="index"></A><A NAME="index2"></A><B>(WASHINGTON)</b></FONT><font size=3> --The Bureau of Export Administration today issued a regulation implementing the Clinton Administration encryption policy announced on October 1, 1996.  Key elements of the regulation include the transfer of commercial encryption items from the U.S. Munitions List to the Commerce Control List, liberalized treatment for recoverable products and a two-year transition period during which non-key recovery 56 bit DES or equivalent strength encryption products may be approved for export based on company commitments to build and market key recovery products and to support a key management infrastructure for electronic commerce.<P>	"The new export rules for encryption products will promote the robust growth of international electronic commerce and secure global communications while balancing our nation's economic and national security needs," said William A. Reinsch, Under Secretary of Commerce for Export Administration announcing the new regulations.<P>	"The Administration's policy will help to maintain our nation's share of world computer markets and the jobs that go with it.  This flexible, balanced approach can protect individuals' data and their lives and property.  To the extent a critical mass of industry cooperates with us, we can collectively achieve our goals," Reinsch continued.<P>	The regulation establishes procedures and conditions for companies to follow for approval to export encryption products and creates a new license exception for recoverable encryption products.  It spells out time lines for interagency review.  In addition, beginning on January 1, 1997, nonrecoverable 56 bit DES or equivalent strength encryption products will also be exportable under a special six month license exception, which can be renewed during the two year transition period.  This special license exemption requires a one time review of the product and assurances that satisfactory progress is being made to build and market recoverable encryption products.  Finally, the regulation provides for a 45-day period for the public to submit comments.<P>	The rule is effective upon publication and companies may begin to apply for licenses or consult with Export Administration officials immediately.  <P><center><img src="rainbwln.gif" height=13 width=550></center><P>
