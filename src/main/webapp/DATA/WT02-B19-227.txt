One article from every issue of <i>TEC</i> will be highlighted for electronic discussion among authors and readers on the World Wide Web. We anticipate this innovation will merge the best attributes of print publication and electronic communications technology to provide <i>TEC</i> readers with an important new benefit.<p>    The authors of our first <i>TEC</i> Author Online event are Pam Campbell, a professor at the University of Connecticut, and Jack Tierney, Executive Director of Educational Technologies, Inc. Their article <a href="campbell.htm">"How Teachers Can Use Technology to Collaborate on Teaching Effectively"</a> appears on pp. 4 to 8 of <i>TEACHING Exceptional Children</i>. We encourage everyone to read the article first, then join the authors and other readers online. We've designated November 4-22, 1996, as the dates for this online event.<p>    During this 3-week electronic event, visit the site as often as you like. We look forward to having you share your comments and experiences with authors Pam and Jack, as well as other <i>TEC</i> readers. We'll report on this historic event in a future issue of <i>CEC Today</i>.<p>
