<p><font size="6"><strong>D</strong></font>on't be fooled by the
elegant simplicity of the Hot Funds Analyst. As you can see, it
is clear, concise and easy to use. Yet it generates enormous
profits when followed correctly and with proper discipline.<br>
</p>

<p>Our research and computer analysis are designed to select and
choose mutual funds for at least a four-week period. Our system
is not designed to trade intra-week or inter-day. Remember, all
the funds on our Top 50 list are technically very strong. We
don't sell a fund based solely on a few good or bad days of
trading. <br>
</p>

<p>However, we will send you a <i><u>SPECIAL FLASH UPDATE</u></i>
anytime our Best intermediate Term Timing System (BITS) signals a
major change in stock market direction.<br>
</p>

<p>We also have a telephone hotline that is updated <i>every
Monday by 9:00 am eastern time</i>. This hotline will give you the
current position of BITS and any portfolio changes.<br>
</p>

<p>The Hot Funds Analyst features 4 Model Portfolios. The <i>first
portfolio</i> uses the Rydex Family Of Funds (1-800-820-0888) in
conjunction with our BITS market timing system. This is known as
our INDEX FUNDS PORTFOLIO. By using these funds (Nova, OTC and
Ursa) we can go both long and short depending on the signal from
the market timing system. Rydex Nova is an S&amp;P500 index fund.
Rydex OTC is a NASDAQ index fund. Rydex Ursa is an index fund
that is short the S&amp;P500.<br>
</p>

<p>BITS was developed in late 1988 and was tested on historical
data from 1963 to 1988. The Nasdaq and the S&amp;P500 index were
used to generate the buy/sell signals and compute the returns. Since 1989,
BITS has been in use real-time and it has proven itself in both
backtesting and actual trading. On average it signals a trade
every 4 months. The accuracy rating is over 80%, with every 4 out
of 5 winning trades. The compounded annualized return is over 24%
per year.<br>
</p>

<p>There are a number of reasons why we are using the Rydex
family of funds for trading BITS signals. <u>Rydex Nova</u> is an S&amp;P500
index fund with a beta of 1.5. This means when BITS is correct in
its long signal, you make 50% <i>more</i> than the S&amp;P500
index itself. <u>Rydex OTC</u> is the an index fund that tracks the
Nasdaq index. The combination of Rydex Nova and OTC lets us
participate in both the large and the small-cap stocks.<br>
</p>

<p>Rydex is the only family that offers a fund that is short the
S&amp;P500. This makes <u>Rydex Ursa</u> a rather unique fund. It goes
up when the S&amp;P500 goes down and vice-versa. This means when BITS
is correct in its cash/short signal you can make money as the
S&amp;P goes down. If you are able to find other similar funds,
you may be able to substitute them for the Rydex funds. Jack
White &amp; Company (1-800-233-3411) offers all three Rydex funds
while Charles Schwab offers only the Nova fund.<br>
</p>

<p>The <i>second portfolio</i> consists of no-load funds that can
be bought and sold through Charles Schwab (1-800-2-NO-LOAD) or
Jack White (1-800-233-3411). This is known as our NO-LOAD FUNDS PORTFOLIO and
it consists of funds from excellent families like Twentieth Century,
Janus, Invesco, Berger, Oakmark, Strong, Steinroe, Founders,
Montgomery, Lexington, Cappiello-Rushmore, IAI, Dreyfus, Kaufmann
and many others. These funds are also available through the
Fidelity Funds Network (1-800-544-7777).<br>
</p>

<p>The <i>third portfolio</i> is called the FIDELITY GROWTH
PORTFOLIO and it consists of 4 <i>diversified</i> Fidelity funds. The <i>fourth
portfolio</i> is called the FIDELITY SECTOR PORTFOLIO and it
consists of 4 Fidelity Select <i>sector</i> funds. Fidelity
Select funds have a <i><u>one time</u></i> 3% sales load. After
that you may switch to other funds within the family without any
loads. There is also a $7.50 redemption charge which can be
avoided by using their automated telephone touch-tone trading
system. Fidelity can be reached at 1-800-544-8888.<br>
<br>

<p align="center"><font size="5"><b>How To Get Started<br>
<br>
</b></font></p>

<p><b>1. Choose One Or More Model Portfolios</b> </p>

<p><b>2. Invest In Those Mutual Funds That Have A </b><b><u>Buy</u></b><b>
Rating.</b> </p>

<p><b>3. Sell When A </b><b><u>Sell</u></b><b> Signal Is Given<br>
<br>
</b></p>

<p>Once you have decided on a portfolio to follow, you can decide
what to buy. For each portfolio, an allocation percentage is
listed next to each fund. Use this allocation to decide how many
shares to buy depending on your <i>personal</i> portfolio/account
size. Every portfolio gives you a specific percentage for each
mutual fund. <u>Just multiply this percentage by the total amount
of money you have to invest. This way any size investment can be
accommodated.<br>
</u></p>

<p>You'll then see the individual funds in every issue of the Hot
Funds Analyst. You simply invest in the mutual funds that are in
your selected portfolio. Whenever there is a change, just call
your broker or mutual fund and ask them to switch your money to
the recommended fund. By keeping your money in a winning fund,
you automatically win.<br>
</p>

<p>When you get the next issue of the Hot Funds Analyst, check
your selected model portfolio and look at the <u>Status</u> of your
fund. Sell your fund when a sell signal is given. Then purchase
the new recommendation. It is as simple as that.<br>
</p>

<p>Please remember ... <i><u>patience and discipline</u></i> are
the two most important cornerstones of successful investing.
Don't expect miracles or think you'll get rich overnight. Also,
don't let the day to day market volatility and ups and downs bother
you. That is all part of investing in the stock market. <u>Focus
on the longer-term. Look at the bigger picture. Think where you
want to be 3, 5 or 10 years from now.<br>
</u></p>

<p>Jumping around from one investment program to the next can be
detrimental to your wealth building efforts. Once you have found
a good system, like the Hot Funds Analyst, try it for at least
2-3 years before passing judgment on it.<br>
</p>

<p>We at the Hot Funds Analyst hope to make your investing
profitable and enjoyable. </p>
