<CENTER>HOW ARE YOUR CONGRESSIONAL VISITS GOING?</B><BR>
</CENTER><BR>
Well, by now, we are sure most of you (and your PAN networks!) have either completed your visits to your new Representatives and Senators, or you're very close to it -- right?!!!  If you haven't started yet, there's still time; but not a lot!  We're hoping that all visits will be completed by the end of this month.  <P>
As you know, now is an especially crucial time to get to know your policymakers.  You, as a constituent, have the strongest pull with your elected officials (isn't it nice to be so powerful?!!).  And, they need to know where you stand on issues affecting students with exceptionalities.  Here in Washington, we're closely monitoring a variety of topics, including a Constitutional amendment that would implement a balanced budget; a bill that would relieve states from the effects of "unfunded mandates;" as well as the President's proposed FY 1996 budget for special education and gifted programs and how it will impact exceptional students.  Information on all of these proposals can be found in this PAN mailing.  You and your network need to be involved in these issues!!  We will provide all the information and the tools you need to actively participate at the state and local levels.  <P>
Please let us know if you're having any trouble arranging your visits.  We'll help you find some alternatives if necessary.  Remember, if you absolutely cannot schedule an appointment with your legislators, it's perfectly fine to meet with their education staff.  Also, <B>don't forget to send us all of your reporting forms! </B>They can provide us with crucial information on what your members of Congress think about special education and related issues.  <P>
Thanks again for your support of this massive education mission.  Please know that we appreciate your efforts, and so will the population of students that we represent and advocate for.<BR>

<CENTER><B>EXECUTIVE BRANCH NEWS<BR>
</CENTER></B><BR>
<B>Administration's FY 1996 Budget Request</B><P>
On February 6, President Clinton released his budget proposal for FY 1996.  The Administration's proposal was sent to Congress and marks the official "kick-off" for the FY 1996 budget year.  In the coming weeks the House and Senate Budget Committees will hammer out their 5-year budget plan and decide the overall funds for budget categories.  Using the total amount of funds allocated, appropriators will then decide the line-by-line funding for education programs. <P>
For the Department of Education, President Clinton has proposed $24 billion for discretionary education program, an increase of $878 million, or 3.8 percent, over FY 1995. The major increases proposed are: Goals 2000 (an increase of $347 million, for a total of $750 million in FY 1996); Title I programs for the disadvantaged (an increase of $302 million for a total of $7 billion in FY 1996); and Title II professional development programs (an increase of $415 million, for a total of $735 million for FY 1996).   <P>
<B>Part B State Grant and Preschool Grant.  </B>For Special Education, Clinton is proposing an overall increase of $89.3 million, a 2.7 percent increase.  The entire increase would be for the Part B State Grant program and/or the Preschool Grant program.  The Administration has not provided a distinct appropriation line for the two grant programs.  Instead the Administration has<BR>
requested an appropriation of $2,772.5 million for both the Part B programs, an increase of 3.3 percent for FY 1996.  President Clinton proposes freezing the Part H program at $315.6 million for FY 1996.  <P>
<B>Special Purposes Funds. </B>(Also known as the IDEA discretionary programs.)<B>  </B>President Clinton proposes collapsing the 14 special purposes programs into 5 main categories and freezing the funds at $240 million for FY 1996.  The five main categories are:<P>
<B>Research and Demonstrations</B> is proposed to receive $63 million. Of the funds available, $41.5 million would be used for the continuation costs of current research projects and related activities; $21.5 million would be available for new <BR>
awards.  <P>
<B>Technical Assistance and Systems Change</B> is requested to receive $50 million for FY 1996 for technical assistance, dissemination, and systems change activities.  Of the $50 million, $36.9 million would be used for continuation costs for current activities.  <BR>
<BR>
<B>Professional Development</B> is proposed to receive an appropriation of $97 million, of which $82.9 million would be used for the continuation of current activities. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Parent Training</B> would receive $14.5 million under the Administration's proposal.  The funds would support at least one center in each State to provide parents with training and information.  Of the funds, $11.1 million would be for the continuation of current activities.<BR>
<BR>
The last broad discretionary program proposed is <B>Technology Development and Support.  </B>The Administration proposes $29.5 million in FY 1996 for a variety of media-related purposes, and for research and development for the application of new technologies.   Of the funds, $18 million would be for the continuation of current activities.<BR>
<BR>
Currently, there is no formal legislative proposal from the Department of Education fleshing out their consolidation proposal.  CEC is concerned that if the Department is moving toward consolidation that it does so with caution and with necessary input from those communities that would be affected.  As you know, CEC has outlined its criteria for any consolidation of education programs in its January 5, 1995 IDEA Recommendations.  <P>
Further, CEC is urging the budget and appropriations leadership in the Congress to work only from the 14 program designations currently in law until such time as the reauthorization of IDEA is completed.  To do otherwise would break with established Congressional rules, and would not allow for thorough consideration of consolidation proposals.  We will continue to keep you informed on this issue.<B><P>
Javits Gifted and Talented Program. </B>The Administration requested $9.5 million for the Javits program for FY 1996, the same level as appropriated in FY 1995. While this appears to be a  freeze on the Javits program, it is actually a cut when inflation is taken into account.  <P>
Unfortunately, many believe the Administration's request to be the "high water" mark for education programs in FY 1996.  CEC, however, will be working hard with CEC-PAN to ensure that Congress surpasses the Administration's funding request for programs for exceptional children.  <P>

<CENTER><B>CONGRESSIONAL ACTION</B><BR>
</CENTER><BR>
<B>House Budget Update<P>
</B>The House strategically delayed its rescission package until after the President's budget request was released.  The Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, HHS, and Education will be taking up two rescission bills.  The first one will be legislation to cut FY 1995 funds in order to provide supplemental funds for defense.  It is our current understanding that $300 million will need to be cut from the labor, HHS, and education budgets.  The second rescission bill will total a cut of $7 billion, 30 percent of the cut will need to come out of our subcommittee.  It is expected to be voted on on the House floor the week of Feb. 24.  <P>
Although we do not have any formal information, we have been assured that IDEA programs and the Javits gifted and talented program will not be included in either of the House rescission bills.  We will keep you posted as this legislation moves forward. <BR>
<B><BR>
Unfunded Mandate Legislation</B><P>
Unfunded mandate legislation passed the House on January 31 by a vote of 360-74.  Similar legislation passed the Senate last week by a vote of 86-10.  It is now headed for conference where conferees will iron out the minor differences between the two versions.  <P>
The House and Senate bills require a bill or amendment imposing a federal mandate of more than $50 million on a state or local government, or $200 million on the private sector, to include an estimation of the cost and specify the money or taxes to pay for it.  If the bill is to be paid for with a subsequent appropriation, the bill must stipulate that the mandate will expire if it is not funded or will be scaled back if the appropriation is less than anticipated.  Legislation that is brought to the floor and does not include these provisions will be subject to a point of order.  If a point of order is brought against the bill, a majority of Members would have to vote to continue to consider the legislation; otherwise the bill would be sent back to the originating committee.  <BR>
Both bills would only affect prospective legislation.  However, it was initially unclear whether a reauthorization or an amendment to an "old law" would make that law subject to the unfunded mandate provisions.  During debate in the Senate, Senator Glenn (D-OH) successfully sponsored an amendment that clarifies S.1's affect on reauthorizations.  Legislation that is reauthorized will not have to comply with the provisions in the bill, unless funds are reduced for existing mandates, or new mandates are added that will cost a net increase of $50 million on state or local governments, or $200 on the private sector.  The final House bill includes similar language.  <BR>
      <BR>
Also included in both bills are provisions that exempt any legislation that "enforces Constitutional rights of individuals; or establishes or enforces any statutory rights that prohibit discrimination on the basis of race, religion, gender, national origin, or handicapped or disability status".<P>
It is CEC's understanding that both the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and the Individuals with Disabilities Act (IDEA) will not be affected by this legislation.  The reauthorization of IDEA will not be affected unless any "unfunded federal mandates" are added to the legislation.<P>
<B>Balanced Budget Amendment<P>
</B>Another piece of the Contract With America that is currently moving in Congress is the Balanced Budget Amendment.  The BBA would amend the U.S. Constitution to require the Federal government to balance the budget by 2002.  To make such an amendment to the Constitution, the BBA has to pass the House and Senate by a 2/3rds majority vote and then be ratified by 3/4ths of the States (38).   The House has passed the legislation but it has run into trouble in the Senate.  Senator Robert Byrd (D-WV) is leading the opposition in the Senate by questioning the wisdom of amending the Constitution for this purpose.  <BR>
 <BR>
While requiring a balanced budget, the proposed legislation does not specify the necessary funding cuts that would be required to achieve a balanced budget in 2002.  The bipartisan Congressional Research Service estimates Congress will need to find over $1.2 trillion in savings to balance the budget.  Without the specifics on the Federal programs Congress will cut to achieve a balanced budget, it is difficult for education advocates to support such legislation. The bill would amend the Constitution to enforce a budgetary mechanism but leave the hard choices for later.  <P>
CEC is concerned that programs for children with disabilities and gifted children may be significantly cut if this balanced budget amendment is passed.  With such dramatic cuts necessary to balance the budget, we believe that domestic programs such as education initiatives will face extreme funding cuts.  We also believe that this type of funding constraint will, at the very least, prohibit any significant new investment in education programs.  With the  current federal share of spending for IDEA at 8 percent instead of the promised 40 percent, enactment of the currently proposed balanced budget amendment would make it more difficult, if not impossible, for the federal government to meet its commitment to children with special needs. <P>
Without the specifics on how the necessary funding cuts will be achieved, CEC believes the legislation only gives half the story.  Hard decisions will have to be made in order to balance the budget and the American people should know exactly what will be sacrificed.  While CEC supports the objective of a balanced budget amendment, CEC firmly believes that we cannot afford to cut or eliminate programs that will significantly better the future of our children and the nation. <P>
<B>Committee Lists<P>
</B>Attached are relevant committee lists for both the House and the Senate.  We have included appropriations, budget, and education committee membership.  We hope the lists will be useful for you  throughout the year.  <P>
<B>House Panel Examines Cash Benefits of Children's SSI Program</B><P>
The current system of providing monetary benefits for children determined disabled under the Supplemental Security Income Program (SSI) is completely out of control, and is abused by many families whose children don't really need to be covered, said a member of the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Human Resources last month.  According to Subcommittee member Rep. Jim McCrery (R-LA) during a January 27 hearing on the SSI issue, the number of children covered by the program has more than tripled since 1989, and without restrictions on how the money awarded is used, many families are taking advantage of the program.  <P>
<B>Background</B>:  The SSI program, which was established in 1974, is administered by the Social Security Administration (SSA).  The program provides the families of children with disabilities with a monthly check; the maximum each child can be awarded each month is $458.  Before 1989, the growth in child beneficiaries had been relatively low.  However, over the last 5 years the number of children receiving SSI benefits has grown from almost 300,000 to almost 900,000. <BR>
According to the U.S. General Accounting Office (GAO), most of the growth is likely due to concerted outreach efforts as a result of the <I>Zebley</I> decision and subsequent major changes in eligibility criteria for children.  <P>
In the 1990 Supreme Court decision in <I>Sullivan v. Zebley</I>, the Court ruled that SSA had to go beyond its previous disability criteria and assess a child's ability to do things that another child of a similar age can do.  The definition of disability for SSI eligibility requires that a child have a physical or mental impairment expected to last at least 1 year and to substantially reduce the child's ability to function independently, appropriately, and effectively when compared with other children of the same age.  If a disability cannot be found solely on medical grounds (meeting a listing), the SSA must evaluate how the impairment affects the child's ability to function, known as an individualized functional assessment (IFA).  If the assessment shows that the child does much less than expected in one area or is moderately restricted in several areas of development or functioning, the child is considered disabled and can be eligible for SSI.  <P>
<B>Charges Against the Program</B>:  The House panel's concern is not focused on those children who are truly disabled, McCrery charged.  He alleges that parents tell their children to "act crazy," so that they could qualify for SSI.  Another of the panel's concerns is that parents don't have to use the money for therapeutic or medical aid.  They can spend it in any way they wish, as long as they can prove that it benefits the child in some way.  This opens the way for purchases of cars, household goods and clothing, even a television set and video games, McCrery stated.  "The key problem (with the SSI program)," added Rep. Gerald Kleczka (D-WI), "is that it fails to adequately state what providing assistance to these children is meant to achieve.  Lacking clear direction, the program often fails to serve a constructive purpose."<P>
The government's lack of program oversight could conceivably allow the families who currently receive SSI payments for their children to continue to receive them during the child's entire life, without adequate follow-up to determine whether the children are still disabled, the panel noted.    <BR>
In an attempt to remedy the situations of fraud and abuse, and to ensure that the "system targets services directly to the needs of qualifying children," the House panel is seriously considering several alternatives to the current system of cash benefits.  Rep. McCrery said he intends to offer an amendment to the Personal Responsibility Act (which was introduced under the Contract with America), which would drastically change the children's SSI program.  <P>
<B>Proposed Changes to the Program</B>.  McCrery's amendment would limit cash benefits only to families who, in the absence of such assistance, would have to institutionalize their child.  The federal funds that now pay for benefits to all other children -- estimated to be about 90 percent -- would be converted into a block grant to the states.  Each state Medicaid agency would design a set of services based on a treatment plan for each SSI child and, in some way, arrange for the family to receive the services.<P>
McCrery's amendment would also change the eligibility standards by eliminating the individualized functional assessment (IFA), which was originally mandated by the <I>Zebley</I> decision.  Children would only be eligible on the basis of the listings.  It is expected that his proposal would make that change applicable to children now receiving SSI benefits who were determined eligible through an IFA.<P>
If SSI changes from an entitlement program to a block grant, it will probably be capped at a reduced level.  In order to stay under the cap, Congress would have to make major changes in the program's eligibility criteria, rules, and benefit levels, such as those outlined in McCrery's proposal.  Other alternatives mentioned include replacing the cash benefits with vouchers, which could be limited in their use to medically related items or services.  The panel has also considered providing assistance only to seriously disabled children (which they did not define); requiring, in most cases, a redetermination of eligibility every 5 years.<P>
<B>The Disability Community Speaks Up</B>.  The disability community, citing a recent SSA report, testified that a majority of the fraud charges are unfounded.  "It is nearly impossible for children to feign disabilities to qualify for benefits," insists the Consortium for Citizens with Disabilities (CCD).  "The severity of a child's disability must be so fully documented that children with minor physical or behavioral problems cannot qualify for SSI."  The Consortium noted that of the more than 600 random cases that SSA examined, not one case of alleged coaching was found that resulted in a benefit award.<P>
In addition, some have pointed out that the proposal to eliminate cash benefits in lieu of a block grant or service voucher would drastically affect the ability of families to keep their children with disabilities at home.  "Families use cash payments to cover expenses such as medications and physician visits to regulate medications, children's wheelchairs, and family counseling," explained Barbara Otto of the SSI Coalition.  "These are all medical related costs that are not covered by either private or public health insurance.  Some use the benefits to offset their loss of income because a parent must remain unemployed or under-employed to care for a child with disabilities." <P>
Without the financial assistance and the flexibility to use the money, CCD notes, some families could be  forced to surrender custody to guarantee proper care for their children, either through the foster care system or in state institutions at a higher cost to taxpayers.  <P>
<B>CEC Response</B>.  CEC has urged the Subcommittee to wait to make drastic changes to the program until more information about its effectiveness -- and abuses -- are better known.  Congress has established a Commission on the Evaluation of Disability in Childhood, which has been charged with conducting an extensive study on SSI benefits.  The Commission is expected to report its findings by November 1995; therefore, CEC urged Subcommittee Chairman E. Clay Shaw in a letter to wait for the report's findings before beginning any action that may unnecessarily restrict SSI benefits for children with disabilities.<P>
We will update you on this issue as any changes or actions arise.<P>
<B>Key Legislators, Key Contacts</B><P>
Following is a list of very important federal legislators who can have a great deal of impact on programs that affect students with exceptionalities.  We need to make sure that we have a CEC member in each of the legislators' state and/or district who can initiate and maintain access with  the legislators' office.  If that person is not yourself, he or she should be familiar enough with the legislative process to make an impact with the legislator should the need arise.<P>
Rep. Bill Goodling (R-PA)               Rep. Randy "Duke" Cunningham (R-CA)<BR>
Rep. Ernest Jim Istook, Jr. (R-OK)     Rep. Bob Livingston (R-LA)<BR>
Senator Arlen Specter (R-PA)          Senator James Jeffords (R-VT)<BR>
Senator Nancy Kassebaum (R-KS)          Senator Bill Frist (R-TN)<P>

TWO ADVOCACY TRAINING SESSIONS HELD DURING CONVENTION</B><BR>
</CENTER><BR>
In order to supplement the advocacy training you all do in your federations/divisions, CEC's Department of Public Policy will be holding two sessions during the Indianapolis Convention.  The first is our Second Annual Public Policy Workshop, entitled "Making A Difference: Taking Charge of the Political Process."  This all-day workshop, held on Wednesday, April 5 from 8:30 to 4:00, is for any CEC member who is unfamiliar with the political process, but is interested in finding out!  DPP staff and other leaders in the advocacy field will present on topics such as "How a Bill Becomes a Law," an overview of the federal regulatory process, how state legislatures differ from Congress, how to establish coalitions, and how to create or expand your own political action network.<P>
This workshop is not intended for PAN Coordinators, or those who already have a great deal of experience in the political arena.  It is a very basic session -- an "Advocacy 101" if you will! -- and our goal is to help you create a cadre of CEC members who become more active and interested in the political process.  <P>

If you know of anyone in your federation or division who is interested in learning the basics, or just brushing up on their rusty advocacy skills, please let them know about this interactive, informative Workshop!<P>
<CENTER><B>Session on the <I>CEC Special Education Advocacy Handbook</I> at Indy!</B><BR>
</CENTER><BR>
On Saturday, April 8, from 3:45 to 4:45 p.m., Jacki Bootel, DPP's Policy Specialist for Field Operations, will be conducting a session to help familiarize you with the new <I>CEC Special Education Advocacy Handbook</I>.  She'll discuss how you can fit the <I>Handbook'</I>s contents into your current training programs, and will give you an opportunity to let her know what other types of<BR>
training materials you might need in order to more effectively teach CEC members to be more effective advocates!  Join Jacki for this helpful session -- and bring your federation/division officers or any interested members as well!<P>
