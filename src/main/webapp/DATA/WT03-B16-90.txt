<H2>Sar Single Look Complex Image</H2>
<P>Acronym: <STRONG>SAR.SLC</STRONG><BR>The product is a single look complex digital image generated from raw SAR data takes using
up-to-date auxiliary parameters. The image, projected on slant range, referred to as quarter scene  or quadrant corresponds to
approximately one half (range) by one half (azimuth) of a full scene image.

$       - the use of the $  (dollar  sign) in the documentation denotes a 
          requirement for the blank character (ie. the ASCII or EBCDIC 
          space character).

(n)     - this expression is used to denote the contents of an integer
          binary field which will vary depending on the product type or
          data origin and will have to be supplied on the CCT by the
          facility generating the CCT.

<.....> - this expression is used to denote the contents of an alphanumeric
          field, which will vary depending on the product type or data
          origin and will have to be supplied on the CCT by the facility
          generating the CCT.

<$...$> - this expression is used to denote a blank field.
