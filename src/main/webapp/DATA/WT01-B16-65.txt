<P>
Radioactive wastes can be safely and economically dealt with by a variety of known methods all of which fulfil the same broad principles.  There is international consensus on these principles, whose goal is to ensure that all these radioactive wastes are managed so that human health and the environment are protected now and in the future without placing an unacceptable burden on later generations.  The crucial problem is public confidence:  there has been a failure to communicate that adequate ways are known of managing radioactive wastes with responsibility towards the present and future generations at reasonable cost. 
<P>
Broad knowledge exists on methods that will achieve these objectives, and on the scale of their costs.  Short lived waste, which forms the bulk of all the waste, is already taken care of on an industrial scale.  Facilities for final disposal of the very small quantity of high level long-lived radioactive waste have not been urgently required, because initial storage minimises the total radiation exposures from all management of this wastes, including final disposal.  However, taking into account the length of time needed to completion of construction of final repositories, the time has now come to start.  What is needed is for the industry to earn the confidence of the public and for governments to support the steps necessary for this start to be made.  The technological knowledge to site, build and operate the facilities and estimate their costs exists. They can be built and managed at reasonable costs in relation to the costs of the associated electricity generation.

<I>Facts which should be known about radioactive wastes and their management:</I>
<UL>
<LI>Amounts are relatively small
<LI>High level waste is an extremely small part of the total.
<LI>Radioactivity can be very precisely measured
<LI>Toxicity of radioactive materials decreases with time
<LI>Most of the toxicity of radioactive materials disappears soon
<LI>Much is known about the effects of radioactivity on people
<LI>Safe, proven temporary storage methods for all wastes exist
<LI>Final disposal facilities exist for short-lived waste
<LI>Safe methods for high level waste final disposal are known
<LI>Information on techniques is internationally exchanged
<LI>Only a minor part of nuclear electricity costs is for waste
