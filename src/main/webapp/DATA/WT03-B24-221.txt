<h1>Isis: The power positioning deal</h1></center><p>

<center><b>By Karen Bernstein<br>
Editor-in-Chief</center></b>

The big cell adhesion deal between Isis Pharmaceuticals Inc. and Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH is one of only a handful of transactions in which pharma and biotech companies have combined R&D programs. But more are likely to follow, as companies seek power positions in the new pharmaceutical environment by combining broad platform technologies or building disease management portfolios.<p>

The companies last week announced that they had signed a letter of intent to combine Boehringer's monoclonal antibody programs in cell adhesion with ISIP's antisense and small molecule combinatorial chemistry programs in that area. The collaboration is focused on inflammatory diseases. <p>

<center><b>Combining strengths</center></b><p>

The program therefore will combine Boehringer's strengths in MAbs, small molecules, molecular and cell biology and high throughput screens, with ISIP's antisense and combinatorial chemistry expertise. <p>

Other program combinations that come to mind are Nextran, which allies technologies from Baxter Healthcare, Cantab Pharmaceuticals plc (CNTBY), DNX Corp. (DNXX) and SangStat Medical Corp. (SANG) in the transplant field; and the retinoids deal between Allergan and Ligand Pharmaceuticals Inc. (LGND).<p>

Perhaps key to these transactions are terms that seem especially favorable to the biotech partner. In ISIP's case, the deal gives the biotech company a financial independence that will allow it to choose the timing of its next foray into the equity markets. A combination of equity investments, a large line of credit, and 50-50 profit sharing elevate ISIP's stature as a partner going forward.<p>

"The pharmaceutical companies are seeing a role for relationships with smaller companies and understanding the importance of providing a mechanism for ensuring their survival, rather than just extracting products from them," said ISIP Chairman and CEO Stanley Crooke. "This is the first step on the way to thinking Îwhat happens to you happens to us.' <p>

<center><b>Ensure survival</center></b><p>

"If the smaller companies are valuable for their ability to create technology and product opportunities, it's important to structure deals that ensure they can survive. This is a more constructive model than some past models."<p>

However, PaineWebber investment banker Stelios Papadopoulos cautions that these kinds of deals won't become common: their frequency will be limited by the number of biotech companies with deep technologies and cash resources.<p>

Nevertheless, more of these transactions will be created as the pharmaceutical companies gain a greater appreciation of what the biotech companies with good science have to offer. Papadopoulos said he's been working on an even larger deal, but with similar characteristics to the ISIP agreement. <p>

John Wilkerson, chairman of The Wilkerson Group, also is working on several major deals. But he pointed out that acceptance of the importance of the biotech industry to big pharma is still uneven. Many pharma companies are still debating the big issue of 1994 ÷ the importance of dominating market channels versus drug innovation ÷ with most spread across the spectrum between those two extremes.<p>

George Rathmann, chairman and CEO of Icos Corp., agreed with Wilkerson's assessment. However, the fact that at least some pharma companies are more willing to look favorably on biotech companies as true partners is a big improvement over the situation 10 years ago, when Rathmann was at Amgen Inc. Back then, he said, potential partners would turn down offers of EPO for $10 million and a 10 percent royalty, and they'd  argue about whether milestones would be credited against future royalties.<p>

"So a lot has progressed since 1985 -- but the needs are greater," Rathmann said. "Companies weren't expecting to spend $1 billion to get a product to market. A lot of the pain is being caused by how much it costs to succeed."<p>

Rathmann also pointed out that, even with a changed attitude on the part of pharma companies, it's still not easy for biotech companies to get a good deal. <p>

"The leverage of the pharmaceutical companies and the needs of the biotech companies makes it hard on average to wait for the good deal. And when you're negotiating you have to use your leverage -- pharmaceutical companies have to represent the interests of their stockholders, not the interests of the world. It's not so simple to get a fair deal that brings a return commensurate with the value of what the biotech company is bringing."<p>

Two changes are making the pharmaceutical companies more interested in Isis-Boehringer type deals, according to Papadopoulos. "Pharmaceutical companies are appreciating that some of the technologies being pursued by biotech companies are meaningful," he said.<p>

<center><b>Pharma limits</center></b><p>

Pharma companies also realize they're not structured to tackle the newer technologies, due to the limits and inertia that arise from their size, as well as their preoccupation with the restructuring of pharmaceutical markets, Papadopoulos said. "So they're saying, ÎWe'll work with biotech companies.'<p>

Ten years from now, Papadopoulos said, biotech companies may play a critical role in the early-stage translation of technology into product development opportunities, a capability that hasn't existed historically in the pharmaceutical sector.<p>

The Boehringer deal is potentially worth more than $100 million to ISIP, including more than $50 million in potential milestones. Boehringer will make a $28.5 million equity investment, buying 1.9 million shares for $15 a share, giving the Ingelheim, Germany, company an 8 percent equity position. <p>

Subsequent equity investments, predicated on milestones, will be done at a "significant premium" to the market value at the time, according to Crooke. <p>

While Boehringer's ultimate stake in the Carlsbad, Calif., company depends on the stock's price when additional investments are made, Crooke said he doubted it would exceed 15 percent. Because the purchases would be at a premium to market, Boehringer's investment would represent less dilution than if ISIP sold stock in the public market. ISIP has 20 million shares outstanding prior to the deal.<p>

<center><b>Credit line choices</center></b><p>

The deal also includes a $40 million line of credit to ISIP, repayable in stock or cash, which the company would use only if the equity market remains unattractive. "The line of credit has a fairly long payback period, making it an attractive insurance policy for us," Crooke said. "The deal provides us the financing strength and flexibility to go back to the market when the opportunity is right. This changes the financial fundamentals of the company in a very real way."<p>

While ISIP doesn't have to go back to the markets in the near term, it probably will raise money once more if the price is attractive, Crooke said. ISIP had $43 million in cash at Dec. 31. The Boehringer transaction, plus the renewal of the company's agreement with Ciba-Geigy, will provide enough funding for the company to "run its business aggressively for several years," he said. The targets in the Ciba deal are undisclosed.<p>

Products in the collaboration include Boehringer's BIRR1, which is a murine anti-ICAM-1 (intracellular adhesion molecule 1) monoclonal antibody in Phase III trials for kidney transplant rejection and stroke, and in Phase II for burns. The partners' clinical stage portfolio also includes ISIP's 2302 ICAM-1 antisense drug in Phase I studies for inflammation. <p>

<center><b>Profit sharing</center></b><p>

In preclinical development are a humanized version of BIRR1; an anti-E-Selectin MAb; an anti-P-Selectin MAb; and ISIP's VCAM and E-Selectin antisense drugs, which will target a range of inflammatory conditions.<p>

The companies will share equally in funding the R&D program and will share equally in profits from any commercialized products. The exception is BIRR1, which Boehringer will continue to fund. <p>

ISIP will receive a "modest" royalty on BIRR1 sales, Crooke said. "It made more sense for BIRR1 to be outside the basics of the program because it was so far along, but we wanted to tie it in," he said. He noted that it would have been difficult for ISIP to fund half of the expenses for the trials. <p>
