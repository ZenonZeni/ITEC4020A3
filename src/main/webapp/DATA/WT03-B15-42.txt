<FONT SIZE="-1">Döne Talun</FONT></Center>
<P>DÖNE TALUN was just 12 years old when she was arrested in January 1995. Her crime? She was suspected of stealing bread. For five days she was illegally held at Ankara Police Headquarters without access to her family or a lawyer: <I>"They tied me up and connected a wire to my fingers. Then one of them switched on the generator. They also gave me shocks to my face... One of them beat me with his walkie-talkie hard on the head"</I>. No one was prosecuted for torturing Döne Talun. The system which propagates torture in Turkey had once again served to protect torturers.<P>

<FONT SIZE="-1">The trial of Mahir G. and 15 other young defendants<BR>
allegedly tortured at Manisa Police Headquarters</FONT></Center>
<P>MAHIR G. was 14 years old when he and 15 other students and young people were detained in December 1995. The authorities claimed that they were members of the outlawed Revolutionary People's Liberation Party/Front and accused them of writing slogans on walls, distributing leaflets and of starting a fire in a barber's shop - despite reports from the fire brigade that the fire appeared to be an accident. The students say that they were held in Manisa Police Headquarters and tortured for 10 days. Mahir's testimony shows what can happen when members of the security forces feel they are above the law. <I>"...about 10 police fell upon me...They kept hitting my head and stomach...They forced me to undress and kept me under a cold shower...they twisted my testicles...Four of them held me by the hands and gave electric shocks to my right thumb, to my sexual organs, to my arms and to my stomach..."</I><P>

<P>HALIL IBRAHIM OKKALI, aged 12, was arrested on 27th November 1995 on suspicion of theft. When his father came to pick him up later that evening he was covered in bruises. He was subsequently treated in intensive care and had his arm put in plaster. Halil says that when he was taken to Çinarli Police Station in Izmir two police officers interrogated him. They beat him repeatedly with their truncheons and kicked him when he fell down. A complaint was filed and a trial against two police officers was opened in March 1996.<P>

<FONT COLOR="#0000B0"><h3 align=center>Children at risk</h3></FONT>
No one who finds themselves in a Turkish police station is safe from torture, not even a child. Children and young people, many arrested on suspicion of minor offences, are being tortured and ill-treated in police stations and denied the special protection which the law provides for them. Turkish law recognises that children need special safeguards. It states that those under 16 years old can only be interrogated by a prosecutor and in the presence of a lawyer. But these provisions are often flouted.
<P>Children from less advantaged backgrounds seem to be particularly at risk. So are children and young people charged under the Anti-Terror Law. For decades Amnesty International has been drawing attention to the underlying causes which allow torture and ill-treatment to persist: incommunicado police detention, the failure to investigate torture allegations and the failure to ensure that those responsible for torture and ill-treatment are brought to justice. Turkish law recognises that children are particularly vulnerable; in order to make these safeguards effective, the Turkish Government should not only prosecute and punish torturers but also impose strong penalties against police or gendarmerie officers who ignore proper custody procedures for children.<P>

Döne Talun, Mahir G. and Halil Ibrahim Okkali are three of the children whose cases we are highlighting in our campaign. Add your voice to ours. Write to the Turkish Prime Minister. Urge that directives be sent affirming that all detained children should only be questioned by a public prosecutor in the presence of a lawyer as required by Article 19 of Law 2253, that relatives will be promptly informed of detention and given access to the child, and that strong sanctions will be taken whenever such provisions are ignored by police.
