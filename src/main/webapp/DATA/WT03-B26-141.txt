<B>Space images are new! </B>
<P>
In the last twenty years, frequent exposure to satellite images,
such as the cloud images used in TV weather segments, has generated
a familiarity with space images that disguises just how modern
this technology is. Three thousand years ago, Greek natural philosophers
(scientists) deduced from its shadow on the Moon that the shape
of planet Earth was a sphere. That deduction was not completely
confirmed until 1969 when a small and privileged group of United
States astronauts en route to the Moon observed that the Earth
is truly a globe.
<P>
The most revealing views of Earth are not to be had on its surface.
An individual standing on top of Mt Everest with the best telescope
available and under the best viewing conditions, might be able
to see about 0.000025% of the total surface of the Earth. It is
difficult to appreciate and describe the curved surface of a sphere
with surface observations only. Cartography was crude and inaccurate
until aerial photography provided a new perspective from 10 kms
or so above the surface of the Earth. Now observations from heights
of 1000 kms, or in the case of the TV weather cloud images, 30
000 km are routine. Nonetheless it is notable to remember that
until remote sensing technology became routinely available, it
was easier to draw maps of the Moon than of the Earth.
