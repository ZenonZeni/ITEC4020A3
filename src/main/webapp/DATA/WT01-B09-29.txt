<img align=left src="/image/arpaw94e.gif"><blockquote><b><i>"The Sacramento Consortium has embraced the vision of 'dual-use' technology development, demonstrating it as a practical reality by developing super efficient composite vehicles, better batteries and state-of-the-art fuel cells for transportation use." -- Mike Wirsch Project Manager, SMUD</i></b></blockquote><br clear = all><br><p>

Utilities throughout California have demonstrated their commitment to alternative fuel vehicles not just to provide the "fuel" for tomorrow's vehicles, but to increase the peak efficiency of their own power generation, and, just as important, to meet the needs of their customers who want cleaner air.<p>
The Sacramento Municipal Utility District (SMUD) has taken a clear leadership role in electric transportation research and development.  It has led the formation of a unique public/private effort which utilizes the technological capabilities of the Sacramento Air Force Logistics Center (SM-ALC) housed at McClellan Air Force Base.  <p>

<h3><FONT COLOR=#808080>The Sacramento Consortium Mission</FONT></h3><p>
Already a model for "dual use" technology, the Sacramento Consortium has successfully leveraged federal funds with millions of private dollars to dramatically enhance electric transportation technology research and development on a national scale.  This venture seeks to:<p><ul>
<li> Provide for a stronger national defense through economic and energy security;
<li> Develop advanced, efficient electric vehicle components and charging infrastructure to minimize utility system impacts of military and civilian electric vehicle charging;
<li> Create and maintain jobs for the nation, state, community, and SM-ALC; and
<li> Improve air quality throughout the nation.<p></ul>

<h3><FONT COLOR=#808080>Accomplishments</FONT></h3><p>
The Sacramento Consortium's significant success to date is attributed to a systems approach to satisfying diverse consumer needs while applying valuable dual-use technologies in the commercial sector.  For the military, drive element flexibility, reduced vehicle silhouette, signature and volume, as well as increased mobility and deployability are considered.  For the commercial side of "dual-use", project goals include consideration of fuel economy, efficiency, air quality, manufacturing scenarios, safety and military benefits --  as many "commercial" vehicles are used to perform various military tasks.<p>

To date, Sacramento accomplishments include:<p><ul>
<li> Developing a lightweight, safe, freeway-capable electric utility pickup, utilizing structural composite materials. The market potential is more than 80,000 units for both military and civilian uses;  
<li> Placing a pre-production prototype vehicle into service in May 1994.  The vehicle is being road and lab tested, and has a range potential of 100 - 155 miles per charge;  
<li> A redesigned second phase prototype vehicle will be in service by April 1995, meeting 1996 FMVSS standards.  Full production assembly is feasible by 1998;
<li> Field testing advanced lead-acid Horizon batteries in 12-16 vehicles within SMUD and McClellan Air Force Base fleets.  These long-life batteries offer marked improvement in vehicle range, efficiency and performance in "real-world" tests;
<li> Producing six hundred of these batteries at a pilot plant; over 36,000 are expected to be produced in 1995.  Site evaluation is underway to locate a full-scale manufacturing facility;
<li> Developing the world's first electro-mechanical flywheel battery (EMFB) intended specifically for vehicular applications;
<li> Designing an optimization model for this flywheel battery that has identified an optimum storage capacity of nearly 4 kWh per unit at minimal cost, in a unit weighing less than 100 pounds; and
<li> Fabricating a vacuum test fixture for the EDU and developing and testing a high-efficiency motor/generator  at speeds approaching 100,000 RPM. <p></ul>

<h3><FONT COLOR=#808080>Future Directions</FONT></h3><p><ul>
<li> Internationally acclaimed Oak Ridge National Laboratories is developing a lightweight, durable rotor.  A fully operational EDU is scheduled for availability by April 1995;
<li> A clear "dual use" example is the development and demonstration of a hybrid-electric propulsion system in a M113 Personnel Carrier;  
<li> 48 three-wheeled neighborhood electric vehicles (NEVs) have been field and market tested.  A four wheeled, higher speed vehicle has been designed and is due for completion and testing by January 1995;  and
<li> The Sacramento consortium is developing advanced proton exchange membrane fuel cell stacks that will be smaller, lighter weight and more cost effective than current fuel cell technologies. This work is expected to result in the development of a transportation-use fuel cell that will significantly increase EV efficiency and range while providing jobs within the aerospace industry.<p></ul>
