<H1> Rotary Engine Research, Especially Wankels </H1>

<P> Perhaps the most interesting area of research is Mazda's application
of <A HREF = "hydrogen.html">Hydrogen fuel</A> to the RCE.

<P> <A NAME = "Moller"> <A HREF = "http://bozemanlegg.com/~mi/">Moller
International</A> - Home of the RotaPower Engine.  "Making new concepts
in personal transportation a reality", which refers to their powered
lift vehicle in development, with eight Moller engines. There is also an
Aerobot.  The Air Force has contracted production of 100 engines.
Fascinating history from 1962.  There is a new color photograph of the
engine.

<P> The University of Birmingham School of Manufacturing and Mechanical
Engineering <A HREF =
"http://www.bham.ac.uk/ManMechEng/Research/power.htm">Power Transmission
Laboratory</A> is investigating rotary engines, beginning with "a
seal-less Wankel engine, which has developed into an Advanced Wankel
Engine Concept project" in cooperation with <A HREF =
"mid-west.html">Mid-West</A> "to develop an adiabatic engine of greater
performance."  They are also working on an oscillatory rotary engine
(ORE) (cat-and-mouse principle).

<P> The Southwest Research Institute (SwRI) is a large research facility
that has numerous automotive projects.  At the end of its 1995 Annual
Report section on <A HREF =
"http://www.swri.org/3pubs/ar1995/eflvs.htm">Engines, Fuels, Lubricants,
and Vehicle Systems</A> they remark about their contribution to ARPA
research in hybrid electric vehicles using natural gas: "Rotary and
turbine engines are [also] being investigated because they are able to
generate even higher power for a given engine density, and they can
provide significant reductions in scale and emissions."  On another page
they show an image of a <A HREF =
"http://www.swri.org/3PUBS/BROCHURE/D03/ELHYBVEH/order.HTM">hybrid
electric bus</A> which apparently has a rotary engine.



<P> It was reported in 1992 that research is continuing at Wankel R&D in
Lindau, Germany, under Dinkwort Eiermann.  This may be funded to some
extent by Daimler Benz.  If you know about this, please <A HREF =
"mailto:rce@monito.com">communicate</A> with the editor.

<P> <STRONG> Alternatives to the Wankel </STRONG>

<P> Prof. Jami.J. Shah reports about his research on <A HREF =
"http://asudesign.eas.asu.edu/projects/engine/">An Integrated Model of a
Rotary Engine</A> with David W. Toppenberg, graduate student at Arizona
State University <A HREF = "http://asudesign.eas.asu.edu/">MAE Design
Automation Lab</A>.  NASA is sponsoring.  The engine appears to have six
lobes in the housing and four lobes on the rotor.  The page has links to
three Figures about Heat Transfer, Solid Geometry, and Finite Elements.
Toppenberg did a Masters thesis on "Ultra-light Rotary Engine Design"
(8/92-5/94).

<P> See also the annotations about the <A HREF =
"annotated.html#RandCam">Rand Cam</A> engine and about <A HREF =
"annotated.html#miscellaneous">other variations of rotary engines</A>.
