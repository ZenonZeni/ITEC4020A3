<H1>Fourth Stage of Release.</H1>
<HR>
      The  last,  the  fourth  stage  began  on  6  May  and   was 
characterized by abrupt decrease of the release  rate  because  of 
the undertaken  measures  and  of  formation  of  more  refractory 
compounds of radio nuclides in the process of interaction with  the 
materials introduced into the core. The reason of such abrupt fall 
of the release power is still not clear, and  noticeable  releases 
of activity continued much later during the whole month.
