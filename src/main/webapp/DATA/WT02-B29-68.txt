<STRONG>Bundled Programs</STRONG><BR>
A bundled program, also referred to as a turnkey package, is an integrated network
of professional
services available in many of the MainStay retirement plans. Your company, NYLIFE
Distributors Inc. and
the
MainStay Mutual Funds, the Trustee, and the third-party administrator are all included in one
comprehensive
package. As a result, there is no need for you to hire each service individually.
Depending on the plan
requirements, this full service package can include:
<P>

	<UL>
	<LI>Investment options
	<LI>Plan design and consulting
	<LI>Plan literature
	<LI>Administration and recordkeeping
	<LI>Enrollment support
	<LI>Coordination of data
	<LI>Annual IRS filings
	<LI>IRS approved documents
	<LI>Compliance reviews
	<LI>Trustee services.
	</UL>
	
<P>

<STRONG>Unbundled Programs</STRONG><BR>
An unbundled program allows you to select different service providers for different
features of your plan.
These can include:
<P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>Hiring an ERISA attorney to draw up plan documents and maintain plan
compliance
	<LI>Securing IRS approval of the plan
	<LI>Hiring a third-party administrator and recordkeeper
	<LI>Hiring an accountant to prepare and submit the IRS Form 5500 Series
	<LI>Monitoring the effects of changes and trends in the complex retirement
plan industry.
</UL>
<P>
For most employers, particularly those in the small to mid-size range, the most
cost-effective and
efficient way to administer their retirement plan is through the bundled approach.
However, no matter
which option you select, MainStay Mutual Funds can be utilized and offer many
benefits to your
employees.
<P>
<STRONG>Plan Services</STRONG><BR>
One of the most important ingredients in the success of any retirement plan is the
support services
provided through the investment company and the third party administrator. Without
a comprehensive
support program that will attend to your needs as well as your employees needs in a
timely and
effective manner, enthusiasm for the benefit you are providing will subside, and
employee morale and
loyalty will begin to suffer. 
<P>
A look at the industry indicates that many providers today are looking to provide
the same  services that
were offered 10-20 years ago. Times have changed, with a greater demand being
placed on getting
information faster, more efficiently, and in proper order. If your retirement plan
does not utilize
investment companies and third-party administrators that deliver state-of-the art
support services, you
run the risk of offering a benefit that is less than what you want it to be. The
following are some of the
service features contained in MainStay's programs. Depending on which retirement
plan you select,
other standard features may also apply:
<P>
<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>Daily access to 800# telephone inquiry for employees
	<LI>Quarterly individual participant statements mailed within 10 days of the
close of the calendar
quarter
	<LI>Daily individual account valuation
	<LI>Daily exchange privileges by telephone
	<LI>Complete recordkeeping of participant and employer contributions
	<LI>Accounting and recordkeeping of financial transactions
	<LI>Plan distributions.
