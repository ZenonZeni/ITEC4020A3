<A HREF="adhes.jpg"><IMG ALIGN=center IMG SRC="adhes.gif"></A> <br>This picture demonstrates adhesions attaching the left ovary and tube to the sigmoid colon and rectum the right ovary appears normal.  <hr><p>
<A HREF="adhes2.jpg"><IMG ALIGN=center IMG SRC="adhes2b.jpg"></A> <br>This picture demonstrates adhesions from the omentum to the uterine fundus (top).  The yellow portion is the omentum, a fatty apron that is suspended from the colon.  This patients left tube and ovary can also be seen.  <hr><p>
<A HREF="hydro.jpg"><IMG ALIGN=center IMG SRC="hydrob.jpg"></A> <br>The large dilated fallopian tube can be seen on the left side of this picture.  Pregnancy rates after surgery for this condition are very low. Most patients have a better chance of conception with IVF.  Pregnancy rates run between 10-30% with up to 25% of those pregnancies implanting in the fallopian tube rather than in the uterus (ectopic pregnancy).  <hr><p>
<A HREF="usfib.jpg"><IMG ALIGN=center IMG SRC="usfib.gif"></A> <br> An ultrasound picture demonstrating compression of the uterine lining in a patient with multiple miscarriages.  This myoma was removed with outpatient hysteroscopy.<hr><p>
<A HREF="sept.jpg"><IMG ALIGN=center IMG SRC="sept.gif"></A> <br> Recurrent pregnancy loss can also be caused by a uterine septum.<hr><p>
<A HREF="ov1.jpg"><IMG ALIGN=center IMG SRC="ov1.gif"></A> <br>Patients with polycystic ovarian disease may benefit from ovarian drilling with an electrocautery needle or a laser fibre.  Many of these patients will have normal cycles for the next four to six months and up to 30% can conceive.  However, within a short while, the abnormal pattern of menstrual cycles resumes.  This procedure may result in adhesions forming around the tube and ovaries.<hr><p>
<A HREF="myo1.jpg"><IMG ALIGN=center IMG SRC="myo1.gif"></A><A HREF="myo2.jpg"><IMG ALIGN=center IMG SRC="myo2.gif"></A> <br>After three spontaneous pregnancy losses (miscarriages), this patient was reviewed for evaluation.  A saline contrast transvaginal ultrasound was performed.  First, a tiny balloon catheter is inserted through the cervix.  The balloon is inflated and saline is slowly injected into the uterine cavity.  A large myoma is clearly seen bulging into the uterine cavity.  The patient received a dose of GnRH agonist (depot Lupron) and underwent hysteroscopic resection 6 weeks later.  The photographs document the findings at the time of hysteroscopy.<HR><P>
<A HREF="myo3.jpg"><IMG ALIGN=center IMG SRC="myo3.gif"></A> <BR>A leiomyoma (fibroid) is seen on the back wall of the uterus.  A fibroid this size (~1 inch) and in this location usually causes no symptoms.  Surgical removal may result in formation of scar tissue (adhesions) which could jepoardize fertility. <HR><P>
