BIGGER MAY NOT BE BETTER

The general condition of the U.S. chemical industry in 1995 shows
a pattern of slight production growth, substantially increasing
corporate earnings growth and an equally consistent decline in
employment. This pattern shows certain corporate operating
principles that deserve critical judgement. These are as follows.

     1) Profits will be higher if you pay fewer people.
     2) A declining dollar can create a market without investment
     in the human resource for process improvement and change.
     3) It is possible to meet market demand without production and
     process improvement by expanding older system and design
     concepts. The steel industry is a historical precedent.
     4) The investment in human capital can be forfeit now to be
     recovered in the future at a lower price.

The following reference expresses concern for the next year. The
dollar is gaining value and controls are being relaxed. There are
many  talented people in the marketplace. It should not be long
before "mom and pop" operations can distribute rubbing alcohol to
the local pharmacies at half the price. Microbrewries are now a
commonplace on the east coast. At a price they offer quality and
choice not available since before prohibition. Long Island now has
its own wine industry. It will soon recognize that its potato crop
would be useful for production and pipeline delivery of vodka to be
drunk in Manhattan and shipped world wide from the Port of New
York. A right-of-way along the Long Island Railroad will do.

Most of the processes operating in the chemical industry now can
and will be copied and improved by the Chinese. Chemical production
is an ongoing process of growth based on improvement. There are
many aspects to improvement. Purity, safety, reliability, speed,
applications of new materials and computer resources are examples.
The present state of affairs is a one way ticket to obsolescence.

SILICON SENSORS

Few materials can compare to silicon for its usefulness in sensor
design. The first commercial use of the material was in preparation
of photosensors in 1960. In the last 35 years silicon has not
changed but there have been numerous changes in technology and
market demand that increases its usefulness to the measurement and
instrumentation field.

The following reference describes improvements and devices that
serve new demands. There are 10,000 researchers operating in 200
laboratories that continue the study of silicon sensor devices.
Recent improvement in technology makes controlled doping possible.
It is now possible to make multiwavelength sensor that limit
response as a function of the depth of penetration of the
stimulated carriers.

In addition there are demands that appear out of environmental
monitoring needs and biosensing systems. Surface acoustic waves and
microcalorimetric enzyme catalyst measuring systems are two
examples of these applications. The reference contains many more.

Anyone interested in silicon devices should see this paper. It is
18 pages long with about 100 references. Most of them are to recent
papers.

MICROMACHINING TECHNOLOGY MAKES SMARTER USEFUL SENSORS

Developments in micromachining show considerable advancement in the
fabrication of complex sensors. Earlier work was limited to silicon
optical and pressure sensors. Now there are demonstrations of gas
chromatography on a chip. These devices include valving, a flow
channel and a detector.

There are various applications for these devices, but one of the
more important is biological and biomedical sensing. One
application is the monitoring of biological cells individually. An
example is the observation in vitro of the responses of a cardiac
cell under the influence of various chemicals.

On the small scale of these sensors it is necessary to rethink the
physical properties of familiar materials. The surface tension of
water can have a sealing action on a piston cylinder array.
Chemical sensors based on these devices are currently in commercial
development. Taguchi type sensors on micromachined silicon have an
increased level of versatility. The response time can be controlled
by heaters designed into the system with a fast response and
minimum power.

DIODE-BASED DETECTOR SPEEDS DNA ANALYSIS

Allen Northrup of Lawrence Livermore laboratories describes a
compact assembly that performs the polymerase chain reaction. This
reaction is important in cloning DNA to increase its concentration
for more precise and more rapid detection. It is useful in
detecting viruses, bacteria, mutations associated with cystic
fibrosis and Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV).

The unit is much smaller than the hardware presently available for
these measurements and promises to be an order of magnitude
cheaper. It replaces a laser with a diode in the detection
circuitry. It uses semiconductor fabrication techniques to prepare
the thermal cycling process. This technology incorporates heaters
and controllers in the silicon chambers. The small size and thermal
mass permits rapid heating and cooling.

The technology duplicates a process developed by Kary Mullis that
received the Nobel prize in 1993. Hardware available before this
development to process samples for cloning was between $7000 and
$14,000, requiring hours of processing. This hardware does the
operation in minutes.

The following reference is descriptive. It  would be improved with
a drawing.

PHOTOMULTIPLIER TUBES TO STUDY COSMIC RAYS AND NEUTRINOS

Photomultiplier tubes were among the first photosensors. Most
replacements now are the simpler, cheaper and lower voltage solid
state devices. Photomultipliers have not disappeared. They are
particularly well suited for high sensitivity at high energy
because they depend on charges transported in a vacuum. Their
application seems to be increasing. They are particularly useful
for the detection of charged particles in space and on the ground.
Cosmic ray detection is an example.

Cosmic rays exist in showers that bombard the outer atmosphere.
Some of them reach the surface. There is an active interest in
modelling these showers at various places on earth. These charged
species have significant influence on the chemistry of the
atmosphere. An example is the loss of ozone at the poles.
Photomultiplier tubes serve this need.

There also is an interest in using photomultiplier tubes for the
determination of muons and neutrinos under water. This revived
interest by astronomers and physicists is driven by new
applications of an old detector. New designs include devices that
are about the size of a TO-5 can. They still require high voltage.

ACCESSING SENSORS USING INTERNET

A project at the Winooski One hydroelectric dam is operated by the
University of Vermont. It uses the Internet as a sensor interface
to measure multiple parameters such as flow and pressure. The
computers on line can bring generators on line when the water
levels are high enough to drive them effectively. The system
contains 85 fiber optic sensors embedded in the structure.
Maintenance personnel monitor these sensors remotely to provide
service as required.

This is a considerable economy over a system that requires
individuals to be on site to record measurements as needed. The
system is useful for control functions and also information
gathering. Apart from the analog-digital boards that are part of
any instrument measuring system, the computer hardware is in every
way the same as other computer systems. It uses software that is
available for the Apple or the PC system.

There are the usual traffic delays that are part of the operation
of Internet during periods of high usage. These are difficulties
that are not as likely to occur if one limits operations to low
usage intervals, such as between 4 and 6 AM eastern standard time.

The authors advise that it is possible to access the installation
on Internet. The Web address is http://issri.emba.uvm.edu/. This
Internet address contains drawings and data from the installation.
In addition it is possible to download a publication submitted to
the Journal of Smart Materials and Structures that contains more
information.

DETECTING CRYPTOSPORIDIUM

In 1993 cryptosporidium slipped into Milwaukee's water supply
sickening 400,000 people and killing 104. There remains a need for
new methods of detection and control of these pathogens. The
current law requires a turbidity standard for potable water
delivery. That does not distinguish the viable from the non-viable
5 micron size cryptosporidia.

There are manual test systems for filtration and tagging of the
filtrate with fluorescent materials. These have about 30% error.
Algae and other materials bind with the fluorescent dye and tend to
give false positive results. There are other methods discussed.
Most do not have a measurement capability for use in protecting the
public health.

All the proposed methods are laboratory intensive. They do not
appear to be suitable for continuous analysis. The problem is
further complicated because the intrusion may only occur
periodically, when there is heavy rain. This is a condition that
inspires complacency.

IMPROVED METHOD OF FABRICATION OF NICKEL-METAL HYDRIDE BATTERY

The demand for cheap portable power continues to stir development
of economic processes of producing batteries. A current focus is on
nickel-metal hydride systems in which energy is produced by
reacting the hydride on a catalytic surface exposed to oxygen or
air. Among other applications the large economic interest is in
clean energy sources for automobiles.

These systems are of particular interest because they can be
recharged electrically by discharging oxygen and reforming hydride.
They also can be charged by supplying gases. They are inherently
clean sources of energy and light in weight. The following
references are to work being done in Sweden

An element of cost in fabricating a metal hydride system is in the
fabrication of the electrodes. The second reference describes a
continuous process to do this. This process involves the rolling
fabrication of a band with one side of nickel hydroxide and the
other of mischmetal required to form the hydride.

The following papers describe the performance characteristics of
the prototype devices. Summaries include changes that will be
necessary to accommodate this technology to electric vehicle
applications.

Electrochemical Society, Vol. 142, No. 12, pp. 4040-4045, December

materials.

MODEL FOR METALLIC ELECTROMIGRATION FAILURE

Why would a circuit board that has operated within specification
for a long time fail after six years? There may be several answers
to this question but one may be metallic electromigration between
adjacent anodic and cathodic conductors on the board. The
phenomenon has been recognized since the 70s. It promises to become
a more important concern as multilayer boards find application.

The electromigration phenomenon depends on voltage, humidity,
contamination, distance between electrodes and temperature. To
collect data rapidly observations are generally made at high
voltages, (typically 100 volts). The process occurs more slowly at
10 volts.

The following reference is part of a larger tutorial effort to
focus interest on failure processes. It provides documented
information on the factors that influence the processes involved in
the dendritic growth resulting from metallic electromigration. In
a given application environment these failure processes should
follow a Weibull distribution.
**Krumbein, S.J., IEEE Transactions on Reliability, Vol. 44, No. 4,
pp. 539-549, December (1995)**
NOTE: On page 602 of IEEE Transactions on Reliability, Vol. 44, No.
4, we are advised that much of the federal funding for the very
useful MIL-STD (Military Standards on reliability) is being
transferred to other sources or abandoned. This will be a change in
access and should be examined by those interested in maintaining
access to this information.
