<H4><u>Alcohol and Other Drugs</u></H4>
Some people experiment with drugs for curiosity, for kicks, because of peer pressure, 
or to escape emotional problems. Drugs change the way we act, think and feel. Some drugs 
cause depression; some make users feel invincible and can give them a false sense of security; 
some drugs make users feel that they can do anything. These feelings are often unpredictable.
<p>
The dangers of drug experimentation are:
<ul>
	<li>overdose
	<li>physical illness
	<li>use of impure or unknown drugs
	<li>addiction
	<li>impaired judgment
</ul>
<p>
Becoming dependent (getting hooked) on alcohol or drugs may happen immediately or gradually. 
Using drugs may kill you, especially when taken in excess or in the wrong combination. Drugs 
are very unpredictable and their effects on the body vary from person to person.
Alcohol is the most abused drug in Canada. Alcohol is a depressant (downer).
<p>
Alcohol affects parts of the brain and spinal cord in proportion to the amount of alcohol in 
bloodstream. Usual effects of small doses are euphoria, drowsiness, dizziness, flushing, and 
release of inhibitions and tensions. Larger doses produce slurred speech, staggering, double 
vision and stupor.
<p>
Alcohol, even in fairly low doses, impairs driving. In combination with other drugs, a small 
dose of alcohol may produce exaggerated effects.
Beginning 8 to 12 hours after consumption, excessive drinking may produce headache, nausea, 
shakiness and vomiting (hangover).Very large doses can cause death by blocking the brain's 
control over respiration.
<p>
The effect of alcohol may include:
<ul>
	<li>disruptions of drinker's social, family and school life
	<li>liver damage, brain damage
	<li>blackouts (loss of memory)
	<li>impotence, ulcers, disorders of the pancreas
	<li>heart disease
	<li>certain types of cancer
</ul>
<p>
Regular alcohol use induces tolerance, making increased doses necessary to produce the desired 
effect. Chronic users may drink steadily without appearing to get drunk. Their condition may 
go unrecognized, even by themselves, for some time. Chronic drinkers are likely to become 
physically and psychologically dependent. Withdrawal symptoms include jumpiness, sleeplessness, 
sweating and poor appetite, progressing to tremors, convulsions, hallucinations and even death.
<p>
<b>WARNING:</b>Alcohol is a dangerous drug. Games such as "chugging," "card games" and "quarters" 
can kill you.
<p>
<b>WARNING:</b>Drinking or using any drugs during pregnancy is extremely dangerous to the unborn 
baby. Pregnant women who drink excessively may have babies with abnormalities such as mental 
deficiencies, physical deformities or cardiac defects.
<p>
<b>WARNING:</b>Drinking and driving don't mix. It is an offense to drive with a Blood Alcohol 
Level (BAL) of .08% or greater, or to drive while impaired, even if one's BAL is less than .08%.
<p>
Fetal Alcohol Syndrome effects the unborn child.  When a woman drinks alcohol during pregnancy, 
it can physically or mentally damage her unborn baby (fetus).
The effects of alcohol on the unborn child may include;
<p>
<ul>
<li>mental retardation
<li>low birth weight
<li>small head and small build
<li>poor co-ordination
<li>joint problems
<li>heart defects
<li>seizures
<li>behavioural problems
<li>short attention span
</ul>
<p>
<b>WARNING:</b>There is no safe amount of alcohol for a pregnant woman to drink.  Even one 
drink a day may cause problems.  Marijuana (pot, grass, weed, reefer, ganja, joint) and hashish 
(known as hash) are generally smoked or eaten.  Getting high or stoned can make the user feel 
dull and sluggish for some time after. Concentration and short-term memory can be impaired. 
Physical effects include impaired coordination and balance, rapid heart beat, red eyes, dry 
mouth and throat, and drowsiness. THC, the active ingredient, has been detected in bodies of 
fatally injured drivers and pedestrians in Canada and the U.S.A.. The respiratory system can 
be damaged by smoking a single joint of marijuana as it yields twice as much tar as a strong 
cigarette. Studies suggest that normal growth of a baby can be adversely affected by use of 
marijuana during pregnancy.
<p>
The effects of marijuana may include:
<ul>
<li>loss of motivation and interest
<li>lung damage
<li>depression, anxiety, panic, terror, paranoia
<li>time distortion, short term memory loss
<li>impaired ability to drive
</ul>
<p>
Cocaine (C, coke, snow, nose candy) is snorted, injected or smoked. It acts as a stimulant (upper) of the central nervous system.
The effects resemble those of amphetamines with shorter duration. User feels euphoric, energetic, alert; has rapid heart beat and breathing, high body temperature, dilated pupils, sweating, pallor, and a decreased appetite. Large doses can cause erratic or violent behaviour, tremors, incoordination, twitching, hallucinations, pain or pressure in the chest, nausea, blurred vision, fever, muscle spasms, convulsions and death. Users may experience insomnia and stuffy nose as a "hangover" from cocaine.
Characteristic signs of chronic cocaine sniffing are stuffiness and runny nose, chapped nostrils, and perforation of nasal septum.
<p>
The effects of cocaine may include:
<ul>
<li>restlessness
<li>extreme excitability
<li>insomnia, paranoia
<li>hallucinations and delusions
<li>constipation, impotence, difficulty in urinating
</ul>
<p>
Crack is a form of cocaine which appears as small granules that are smoked in a glass pipe 
or tube. Because crack is more concentrated, its use can result in more severe consequences.
<p>
<b>WARNING:</b>Even first time use of cocaine or crack can cause death.
<p>
<b>WARNING:</b>Crack is highly addictive.  A first time user may become addicted.
<p>
<b>WARNING:</b>Freebasing cocaine can cause injury or death from fire or explosion.
<p>
Inhalants "sniffing" glue, aerosols (hairspray, Pam), nail polish, cleaning fluids or gasoline 
can produce mind-altering effects. The effects of abusing these chemicals can cause 
unconsciousness and death.  LSD (acid) is sold on the street as coloured drops on blotting 
paper, on gelatin sheets, and as tablets, capsules or liquid solutions.
The effects are felt within an hour, lasting up to 12 hours. Thinking and concentration 
become difficult, and short-term memory is impaired. Extreme mood swings, including joy, 
inspiration, depression, anxiety, terror and aggression, are common. The drug can induce 
confusion which can cause accidental death.
<p>
The effects of LSD may include:
<ul>
<li>decreased motivation and interest
<li>prolonged depression and anxiety
<li>flashbacks
<li>(LSD) "high" may spontaneously recur days, weeks or even months later
<li>fetal abnormality
</ul>
<p>
PCP (angel dust, elephant, hog) comes in powder form, in crystals, liquid, tablet, capsule 
or paste.  The effects last 3 to 18 hours. It produces a state of intoxication, a sense of 
separation from surroundings, perceptual distortions, and difficulty in concentrating and 
communicating. Users may become highly confused, paranoid, terrified, aggressive or passive. 
Overdose can cause convulsions, coma and death. Accidental death can result from drug-induced 
confusion.
<p>
The effects of PCP may include:
<ul>
<li>persistent speech problems
<li>depression, anxiety or more severe psychological problems Magic Mushrooms psilocybin 
(psilocin) is the active ingredient in several species of mushrooms and other fungi that grow 
throughout Canada.  The effects are felt after about half an hour, and last several hours. 
Symptoms may include fatigue, separation from surroundings, or a sense of heaviness or lightness.
</ul>
<p>
The effects of Magic Mushrooms may include:
<ul>
<li>perceptual distortions
<li>dizziness, abdominal discomfort
<li>numbness of the mouth
<li>nausea, shivering, flushing, sweating
</ul>
<p>
Heroin (H, horse, junk, smack) is fine white or brown powder, usually heavily diluted with powdered milk, sugar, quinine or other substances. It can be sniffed but is usually injected. It is a derivative of morphine, but proves to be more addictive and requires increased amounts to reach the same high. Newborn infants may suffer signs of withdrawal because of their mother's habit.
The effects of heroin may include:
<ul>
<li>user goes into stupor
<li>restlessness, nausea, vomiting
<li>severe constipation
<li>moodiness, menstrual irregularities
<li>insensitivity to pain, contraction of pupils
<li>cold, moist, bluish skin
<li>breathing may slow to complete stop,resulting in death Amphetamines (speed, bennies, ice) 
are uppers. These drugs cause hallucinations, delusions, and paranoia. Users may feel extremely 
anxious, fearful and suspicious.
</ul>
<p>
The effects of amphetamines may include:
<ul>
<li>malnutrition
<li>mental illness similar to paranoia
<li>prone to violence
</ul>
<p>
Prescription drugs (sleeping pills, pain killers, cold remedies, tranquilizers) can cure 
illness and block pain, and sometimes their beneficial effects are needed.
Prescription drugs can also cause dependency and side effects that interfere with life. 
Prescription drugs are not safe for use by anyone other than the person for whom they were 
prescribed.  
<p>
Tobacco (nicotine) is found in cigarettes, snuff and other tobacco products. A lighted 
cigarette generates 4000 different chemical compounds. Most smokers are physically and 
psychologically dependent on tobacco. Tar accumulates in the lungs. Inhaling smokers subject 
themselves and people around them to very high carbon monoxide levels. Those who quit smoking 
generally achieve the same health levels as non-smokers after a few years, although some damage 
may not be completely reversible.
<p>
Cigarette smoke can be unhealthy and irritating to non-smokers, in particular people with 
allergies, children and people who already have heart or lung disease. Laws and regulations 
restricting use of tobacco in public places have been introduced across Canada.
<p>
The effects of smoking may include:
<ul>
<li>increased heart rate and blood pressure
<li>drop in skin temperature
<li>faster breathing
<li>cancer of the lungs, mouth and throat
<li>respiratory disease
<li>blockage of blood vessels
<li>stomach ulcers
<li>each cigarette cuts 5.5 minutes from smoker's lifespan
</ul>
<p>
The babies of women who smoke tend to weigh less at birth than those of non-smokers; the risk 
of prematurity, miscarriage and stillbirth is greater. Studies suggest that a mother's smoking 
can have a detrimental effect on a child's growth, intellectual development and behaviour.
Caffeine is the world's most popular drug. It is found in coffee, tea, cocoa and cola drinks. 
It is also found in aspirin, non-prescription cough and cold remedies, diet pills and some 
street drugs. People who suddenly stop using caffeine after long term use experience withdrawal 
syndrome. The symptoms may include headaches, irritability and mood changes.
<p>
