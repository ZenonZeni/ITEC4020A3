<h1>Global Climate Change</h1><p>
<p>
Climate change refers to the trends that persist for decades or even 
centuries,
over and above natural seasonal and annual changes.  Climate changes are
influenced, among other things, by a natural "greenhouse" effect that 
maintains
a warm and inhabitable Earth. Climate changes can also adversely affect 
ocean
water levels and agriculture production. Pollution prevention and
energy-efficient and renewable energy technologies can significantly help 
in
efforts to stabilize and reverse global climate change.<p>
<p>
<h2>The Challenge</h2>
The amount of atmospheric carbon dioxide has increased about 25% 
worldwide
since the early 1800s.  In just the last 35 years, amounts of the gas 
have
increased 10% and are currently increasing nearly half a percent each 
year.<p>
Because of excess greenhouse gas emissions caused by human activities, 
average
global temperatures could rise 2.2 degrees F by 2030, and regional 
climate
changes could be dramatic.<p>
<p>
<h2>Current Use</h2>
Among individual countries, the United States is the leading contributor 
of
greenhouse gases. Although the United States accounts for only 5% of the
world's population, we contribute 20% of the world's greenhouse gases.<p>


The United States, with less than 5% of the world's population, is 
responsible
for 25% of the world's carbon dioxide emissions, more than any other 
nation.<p>

The transportation sector produced 32% of U.S. carbon dioxide emissions 
and
will be the fastest growing source of carbon dioxide emissions through 
the year
2000.<p>

The carbon dioxide emission rates for a typical automobile are 1.12 
pounds per
mile.  This means that a car traveling a typical commute of 20 miles can 
emit
more than 20 pounds of carbon dioxide.<p>

Including emissions from electricity generation, the industrial sector
accounted for 33% of U.S. carbon dioxide emissions in 1990.<p>

Our homes were responsible for 20% of the U.S. carbon dioxide emissions, 
and
commercial buildings were responsible for another 16%.<p>
<p>
<h2>Projected Use</h2>
Net emissions of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, methane, 
nitrous
oxides, and hydrofluorocarbons in the United States are projected to grow 
by
about 7% between 1990 and 2000.<p>

Currently, developing countries account for 30% of global energy use and
emissions.  However, that rate is projected to rise from 25% to 44% by 
2025;
this rate is based on the additional electric power needed to maintain 
moderate
levels of economic growth.<p>
<p>
<h2>The Solution</h2>
If extensively used, renewable energy sources could save as much as 10% 
of the
emissions produced by the electricity sector during a year.<p>

Opportunity is ripe for U.S. businesses to increase exports of 
energy-efficient
and renewable energy technologies to developing countries and to offer 
support
to these countries to minimize their greenhouse gas emissions without 
slowing
down needed economic development.<p>

Worldwide, the market for environmentally benign technologies is huge.  
The
Center for the Exportation of Science and Technology estimates that the
European Community will spend more than $400 billion and the United 
States more
than $770 billion to reduce greenhouse gas emissions this decade.<p>

The United Nations is developing a climate fund to channel $200 million 
to
developing countries to help them combat global warming.<p>

Industrialized nations have recently decreased carbon dioxide emissions 
by
almost 10%. Smaller, lighter cars have helped improve gas mileage.  More
efficient refrigerators and ovens and better insulated homes have all 
helped
accomplish the goal of reducing emissions.<p>
<p>
<h2>Projects and Initiatives</h2>
The Climate Change Action Plan prepared by President Clinton and Vice 
President
Gore in October 1993 outlines a goal to reduce U.S. greenhouse gas 
emissions to
1990 levels by the year 2000.<p>

Through the Climate Change Action Plan, U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)
initiatives will produce an emissions savings equivalent to the emissions

produced by electricity generation for all households in California, 
Texas, and
New York combined.<p>

Under "accelerated policies," renewables could reduce greenhouse 
emissions by
40% through 2050, according to a United Nation's Conference on 
Environment and
Development report.<p>
