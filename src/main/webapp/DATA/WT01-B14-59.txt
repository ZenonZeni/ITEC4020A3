By now, you've seen that growth and value are vastly different styles of equity investing. Growth pursues fashionable companies in the penthouse, while value roots around for buried treasures in the bargain basement. Value likes underpriced stocks; growth likes oversized earnings.
<P>
So the question may still linger: <B>Growth or value?</B> Which style is best suited to you as a long-term investor looking to help reduce risks? <B>Both.</B> Like cowboy boots and the matador's slippers, investment styles work best in pairs. For the savvy investor, the issue is not one of growth or value, but rather growth and value. Why? In a word, diversification.

<P>

<IMG BORDER=0 SRC="gifs/growth_and_value_subhd1.gif" ALT="A Two-Handed Approach To Diversifying"><BR>
Every investment professional preaches the value of diversification. Don't put all your eggs in one basket, they advise. Spread your investments across several instruments as a way of helping lower risk.
<P>
Good advice, but many investors fail to realize that real diversification occurs when investments are also spread across the two styles of growth and value.
<P>
Yes, the two disciplines are radically different approaches to stock investing, but investors must come to view them as complementary, not competing. There's plenty of room for both in a well-rounded investment portfolio.
<P>
<B>"Using only one investment style is like rowing a boat with only one oar,"</B> says Steve Reynolds, chief investment officer of equities for Zurich Kemper Investments. "You may eventually reach your destination, but it's going to be a tougher trip."

Despite their many differences, growth and value actually share some significant common threads. Both techniques pursue financially strong, quality companies with steady track records of growth. And, in the case of Kemper's "growth at the right price" philosophy, both also seek mispriced stocks that are selling below their real, or intrinsic, value. For the ambidextrous investor who's equally adept at growth and value, a blended portfolio of both styles may produce better results than a "one-handed" approach.
<P>
And then there's risk to think about.
<P>
If the diversification preachers are right, a portfolio of growth and value should carry lower risks than an all-growth or all-value strategy. And that's exactly what happens. An analysis (see chart at right) reveals that <B>a portfolio containing equal investments in the two styles would have had lower volatility than either style alone.</B>

<IMG BORDER=0 SRC="gifs/growth_and_value_subhd2.gif" ALT="Stick To Your Guns"><BR>
Growth and value are both governed by sets of strict, uncompromising principles about the buying and selling of stocks. That's why both disciplines work so well over time. But in the short term, depending on the temperature of the economy, one style usually outshines the other.

Annualized returns based on year-end data from S&amp;P 500 stock groupings. The chart shows performance of the S&amp;P/Barra Growth and Value Indexes. These unmanaged indexes are generally representative of U.S. growth stocks and U.S. value stocks, respectively. The indexes  assume reinvestment of distributions and do not reflect the effects of sales charges or brokerage commissions. Fund holdings and performance will differ. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Growth and value tend to be counter-cyclical, with one style usually outperforming the other (see
table at left). This year, both styles are up, with growth surpassing value by a fairly healthy margin. Through the first nine months of 1996, the S&amp;P/Barra Growth Index was up 15.6%, compared to 13.5% for the S&amp;P 500 and 11.4% for the S&amp;P/Barra Value Index.
<P>
The tendency of growth and value to flip-flop positions as top performer can be both a blessing and a curse. For the wise investor who steadfastly commits to both schools, it means better diversification. For the impetuous investor, however, the temptation may be to switch back and forth between growth and value, pledging allegiance to whichever style happens to be in vogue at the time. Unfortunately, most of these chameleons tend to jump ship just when their abandoned style is about to set sail.
<P>
"Style switching is one of the main reasons investors and fund managers underperform the market," says Mr. Reynolds. "Style switchers almost never win. That's why it's so important to know that your fund managers are dedicated to their investment style."
<P>
<B>A portfolio of growth and value also provides an additional benefit -- less duplication of stocks.</B> A mutual fund investor, for instance, may choose three different growth funds that each invest in the same industries, maybe even the same companies. While there may be occasional overlaps between growth and value, the two styles generally cast their lines in entirely different waters.
<P>
In the end, the smart investor will resist the urge to time the market and remain faithful to the proven styles of growth and value. "Without a strong commitment to your investment styles, the market usually takes advantage of you instead of you taking advantage of the market," notes Mr. Reynolds.
<P>
So commit to an investment style. Better yet, commit to two. Armed with the cowboy's lasso in one hand and the matador's cape in the other, you'll be fully equipped to take the bull by the horns when you take on your investment challenges.
<P>
Please note that there is no guarantee that a particular management style will be successful and that the past performance of a particular style is not representative of future results.

<I>"At Zurich Kemper Investments, our unique growth and value styles are different enough to offer broad diversification, yet similar enough to ensure consistency. Our growth managers look first for high growth companies and second for reasonable stock prices. Our value managers begin with low-priced stocks and then seek out attractive growth opportunities. Both styles pursue stocks selling at the right price."</I>
