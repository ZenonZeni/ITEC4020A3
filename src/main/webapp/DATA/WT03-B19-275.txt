Stawell's ability to support industries is based on its sound
infrastructure and its history of self help and stable growth.
Stawell is well known throughout Australia. Every Easter, it hosts
the world's richest professional foot race, the Stawell Gift.
Stawell toasts the competitors with Great Western sparkling wine,
which is produced locally and is equally famous.

<H2>Gold and sand</H2>

<P>
<img src="gifs2/stwl1.gif" align=right>
The Stawell Gift emerged from carnivals organised by gold miners
last century, and gold mining remains an important industry. In
the late 1980s, Western Mining Corporation initiated the Stawell
Joint Venture with Central Norseman Gold Corporation, producing
the lion's share of Victoria's gold.
<P>
The mine now operated by Australian Gold Mining Investments continues
to provide employment for nearly 150 people in Stawell and District
as well as presenting opportunities to companies supplying equipment
and services. An opportunity exists to recover ore from tailings.
<P>
Discoveries of mineral sands in the Horsham/Stawell region have
the potential to support a number of spin-off industries. As in
other gold mining areas in Victoria, commerce and secondary industry
in Stawell developed early, supplying the infrastructure needed
to support gold mines.
<P>
Stawell is located on the Western Highway, which provides it with
an efficient road transport link with both Melbourne and Adelaide.
It also has rail links with these cities. Stawell offers a dual
runway airport, situated a couple of kilometres outside the town.
<P>
Stawell's location on the sunny side of the Great Dividing Range
in western Victoria makes it an ideal base for servicing the populations
of central and western Victoria and eastern South Australia.
<P>
Its water supply supports the needs of local industry and has
excess capacity to provide for new industries. Bulk water users
are eligible for discounted rates.
<P>
The town's sewerage and waste disposal system has been upgraded
and plans have been formulated to cater for further growth.
<P>
Stawell has also promoted the development of two industrial estates,
zoned heavy, light and garden industrial.
<P>
A computer register of business and employment in the town is
maintained to provide firms with detailed information on services
provided by established businesses. The Council, the Water Board
and the Development Association provide firms with coordinated
and active support for business development and investment.
<H2>Broad economy</H2>

<P>
Stawell has responded well to changing economic conditions over
the years by encouraging broad development in the manufacturing
sector. This includes the food processing, textiles, non-metallic
mineral products such as bricks, which are produced from local
clay, and miscellaneous manufacturing.
<P>
Firms such as Motorway Tyres Pty Ltd, which produces retreaded
and remoulded tyres, and Frewstall Abattoirs, the largest lamb
processor in Victoria, are examples of this diversity.
<P>
The Seppelts and Bests vineyards in Great Western and other Grampians
wine makers produce premium wines. Southcorp Wines (Seppelts)
has embarked on a major expansion to make the Great Western Winery
the largest producer of sparkling wine in the southern hemisphere.
<H2>Opportunities</H2>

<P>
Outstanding opportunities also exist for further development of
the region's tourist industry. The Grampians district is one of
Victoria's major tourist destinations. Growth is expected to continue
in the large numbers of people visiting the area. This will create
a range of investment and development needs and opportunities.
<P>
Opportunities include increasing the accommodation for international
visitors, and providing a greater choice of services and attractions.
There is also scope for additional self-contained family unit
accommodation and developing specialty guided tours.
<P>
The Stawell and Grampians tourist area offers visitors a wide
range of activities including touring the Grampians National Park,
sampling Grampians wines, flying in hot air balloons or participating
in the activities surrounding the Stawell Gift. Rock climbing
in the Grampians and nearby Arapiles is world-renowned.
<H2>Enviable lifestyle</H2>
<P>
Although a small community, Stawell enjoys community and recreational
facilities more typical of much larger centres. This is due to
local authorities' progressive development attitudes and the area's
high profile tourism status. The proximity of the Grampians National
Park, lakes and the wine district provides outstanding recreational
opportunities.
<P>
To those who have an interest in developing the region, the people
of Stawell enthusiastically extend their invitation; 'Come and
join us!'
