<P>
Since the universe of stocks is huge, the problem
you will be faced with is how to narrow the list down to those
stocks that meet your investment criteria. Many professionals
will try to make sense of it by sub-dividing stocks into various
categories: by industry such as healthcare or technology; by size
(market capitalization) such as large, medium and small; and by
relative sensitivity to the economic cycle such as growth and
cyclical. The following are some of the categories:

<UL>
<LI><I><B>	<A HREF="#stockblu">Blue Chip Stocks</A></B></I></LI>
<LI><I><B>	<A HREF="#stockgro">Growth Stocks</A></B></I></LI>
<LI><I><B>	<A HREF="#stocksml">Small-Company Stocks</A></I></B></LI>
<LI><I><B>	<A HREF="#stockinc">Income Stocks</A></B></I></LI>
<LI><I><B>	<A HREF="#stockcyc">Cyclical Stocks</A></B></I></LI>
<LI><I><B>	<A HREF="#stockdef">Defensive Stocks</A></B></I></LI>
<LI><I><B>	<A HREF="#stockspi">Special Situations</A></B></I></LI>
<LI><I><B>	<A HREF="#stockspu">Speculative Stocks</A></B></I></LI>
<LI><I><B>	<A HREF="#stockval">Value Stocks</A></B></I></LI>
</UL>

<P>
Just by looking at the number of different
categories, you will see that all stocks are not created equal.
Each type of stock has its own unique set of characteristics ranging
from how they are valued to their historical performance during
different phases of the business and market cycles.

<P>
One thing to remember about classifying stocks
is that the lines of demarcation between types are not precise
and clear. In fact, there are times when a stock can fall into
several categories. For example, a utility stock can be classified
as both an income and a defensive stock.

<P>
Stocks can also lose their status. Consider
IBM as an example: once labeled &quot;the bluest of the blue chips,&quot;
it fell from grace during the mid-1980s and early 1990s as computing
power moved from the main frame to PCs. Shareholders who ignored
the fundamental changes occurring at IBM watched their shares
decline from a high of nearly $175 in 1987 to under $50 a share
by 1994. Fortunately, new management has since redirected the
company's focus and the stock has recovered part of the decline.

<UL>
<LI>
<B><A NAME="stockblu">Blue Chip Stocks</A></B> --- high-grade, investment-quality issues of major companies that usually
                  have a long and unbroken record of earnings growth and dividend payments. They usually hold
                  key, if not leading, positions in their industry. The companies have the fundamental strength and
                  size to hold their own during a recession and enough resources to capitalize on an economic
                  recovery. By and large, investors who seek safety and stability and are conservative in their
                  approach to investing will turn to this group.</LI>

<LI>
<B>Growth Stocks</B>
--- usually companies whose sales,
earnings and market share are expanding faster than the general
economy and their industry average. The firms are usually aggressive,
research minded and will facilitate their expansion by plowing
their earnings back into the business. Since investors will generally
place a higher value for this above-normal growth, the price-earnings
ratios of these stocks will be higher than their peers and average
stocks and the dividend yield will usually be lower.</LI>

<P>
<LI>
<B><A NAME="stocksml">Small-Company / Emerging-Growth Stocks</B></A> ---
a label given to smaller or emerging companies that have
survived their formative years and have entered a period of strong
earnings gains with expanding unit sales and profit margins. Usually
these stocks are traded over-the-counter (OTC) or on the American
Stock Exchange (Amex). Technology companies are a good example
of a stock in this category. Although these stocks have the potential
for very high growth, they also have a higher risk so their stock
prices will be very volatile.</LI>

<P>
<LI>
<B><A NAME="stockinc">Income Stocks</A></B>
--- some investors, particularly
the elderly and retired, buy stocks for current income. Although
stocks often yield less than bonds, there are some stocks that
are classified as income stocks because they pay higher than average
dividends. Selecting income stocks can be tricky since a high
dividend yield doesn't always insure safety. The stock
may have a high dividend yield because the shares have fallen
in price over concerns about the safety of the dividend. The stock
could also be languishing in an unpopular industry with no future.
Investors can avoid mistakes by staying with quality stocks that
demonstrate a steady trend of rising dividends.</LI>

<P>
<LI>
<B><A NAME="stockcyc">Cyclical Stocks</A></B>
--- companies whose earnings and
profits are tied to the economy and whose stock prices fluctuate
with the business cycle. When economic conditions are good, the
company's profitability is enhanced and the company's
stock rises. When the economy falters, business for the company
falls off along with its profits and stock price. Industries typically
classified as cyclical include: steel, chemical, paper, machinery,
airline, railroad, and automotive.</LI>

<P>
<LI>
<B><A NAME="stockdef">Defensive Stocks</A></B>
--- recession-resistant companies.
Although these companies may lack the glamour of high-growth companies
and market leaders, they are characterized by their degree of
stability during periods of economic uncertainty and decline.
Examples of defensive stocks would include: electric and gas utilities,
food, beverage, and drug companies.</LI>

<P>
<LI>
<B><A NAME="stockspi">Special-Situation Stocks</A></B> --- it's
sort of a catch-all category for stocks that aren't easily classified
into the other groups. Typically, the reason someone likes the
stock is not due to the normal reasons most investors buy a stock
-- i.e., higher earnings, new product introduction, etc. The
reason someone likes the stock may be new management,
a possible takeover or the possibility of  a favorable
court ruling. In any case, the reasons have a higher degree of
uncertainty because of the difficulty in predicting the outcome
of future events. Although special situations aren't for everyone,
an investor can increase his/her chances of making money if there
is also an underlying fundamental case for buying the stock.</LI>

<P>
<LI>
<B><A NAME="stockspu">Speculative Stocks</A></B>
--- any stock that sells more on
hope than on fundamentals. They usually have a great story, but
lack the earnings and revenue history or visibility of more established
companies. Since there are no guarantees that a company can meet
an investor's future earnings and revenue expectations, the stock
price can be highly volatile. Before investing in any speculative
stock, you should remember the phrase: <I>Caveat Emptor! </I>Buyer
Beware! We are not saying that you can't make money in these stocks,
we just think you should understand the risks up front. Investors
should gather enough information on the company so that they can
tell the difference between a stock with a high potential from
one that is a long shot with no value other than speculative appeal.</LI>

<LI>
<B><A NAME="stockval">Value Stocks</A></B> --- stocks that appear inexpensive
relative to earnings, dividends, sales, or other fundamental factors.
History has revealed that market preference for growth stocks
and value stocks tend to alternate in cycles. For example, when
growth stocks are leading, or in favor, value stocks are lagging,
or out of favor, and vice versa.</LI>
