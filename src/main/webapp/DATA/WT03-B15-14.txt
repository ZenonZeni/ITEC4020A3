<H2><A name="whatis">What is AtemiConnect?</A>
</H2><P><A name="whatis">AtemiConnect is a utility that
lets you establish an AppleTalk network connection over the Internet.  This
product lets you connect your Macintosh to a remote AppleTalk LAN via the
Internet, giving you access to all the data, programs and services on that
LAN.
When used with NetShade(TM), Atemi's network security utility, AtemiConnect
sets
up a <B>secure virtual network</B> across the Internet.  File sharing, remote
backups, groupware, LAN-based e-mail, printing, etc. -- anything that you
can do
over your AppleTalk LAN can now be done over the Internet as well.  (The
client
and server must both be running the AtemiConnect software before the link
can be
established, and the remote LAN's AppleShare security settings will apply
to the
link.)</A>

<H2><A name="whatis">How can I use AtemiConnect?</A>
</H2><P><A name="whatis"> AtemiConnect is designed to bridge the gap between
LAN and
Internet networking.  The old mindset for Internet use is
that the network services available over the Internet are limited -- FTP,
Web
browsers, etc. -- and that you need special Internet-specific programs to
use
them.  With AtemiConnect, anything you can do over a LAN can be done across
the
Internet, using the same LAN-based applications that you use today.  In the
short
term, this product will save you money on long-distance modem connections
and
FAXes.  In the long term, it will help your organization share its resources
more
effectively and efficiently.</A>
<P><A name="whatis"> </A>AtemiConnect offers a number of useful applications,
including:
<UL><LI>Replacement of ARA for telecommuting. &nbsp;The telecommuter can
place a local call to a service provider instead of a long distance phone
call. &nbsp;Also, if high speed lines are available, AtemiConnect can take
advantage of the higher throughputs.
<LI>Replacement of Fax. &nbsp;You can select remote Appletalk printers the
same way as file servers. &nbsp;So, instead of sending faxes, you can print
directly to a printer at a remote location. &nbsp;This allows for high
resolution, color, and no long distance charges.
<LI>Database applications. &nbsp;Use LAN-based database products over the
Internet without modification.
<LI>Games. &nbsp;Some LAN games (such as F18 Hornet) can be played head-to-head
with people across the world.
</UL><P><A name="whatis"><HR WIDTH=90% SIZE=4> </A>
<H2><A NAME=ARA>How is AtemiConnect different from
Apple Remote Access?</A>
</H2><P><A name="whatis">There are two important distinctions between these
two
products. ARA uses your modem and a telephone line to exchange AppleTalk
data,
whereas AtemiConnect uses the Internet to accomplish the same purpose.  Since
the
cost of an Internet connection is usually much less than the cost of a
long-distance phone call -- especially if you are connecting to someone in
another country -- AtemiConnect is a much more cost-effective way to share
information than ARA.</A>
<P><A name="whatis"> The second major difference is connectivity.  If you
want to allow multiple remote users to connect to your AppleTalk network
at once,
ARA requires you to purchase a "multiport server" -- an expensive piece of
hardware that allows you to make multiple modem connections to a server at
the
same time -- and a modem for each simultaneous connection you wish to allow.
 By
contrast, AtemiConnect doesn't require any extra hardware at all; multiple
users
can use AtemiConnect to establish simultaneous AppleTalk sessions with a
single
server.</A>

<A name="intersec"></A></A>
<H2><A name="whatis">Aren't there serious security concerns associated with
Internet networking?</A>
</H2><P><A name="whatis">Yes.  The Internet is a notoriously insecure
medium, and just about anything you send over it can easily be read by an
intruder.  Most experts agree that if you plan to send any important business
information over the Internet, you will need a way to keep it safe from outside
eyes.</A>
<P><A name="whatis"> Fortunately, there is a simple way to keep your AtemiConnect
sessions
private.  By combining this utility with Atemi's
<A
href="netshade.html">NetShade</A> network security software, your
AtemiConnect data will be sent over a <B>secure virtual link</B>.  NetShade
is designed
to protect all the AppleTalk data sent from your Macintosh, making it an
ideal
way to keep AtemiConnect sessions out of the hands of intruders.  (Once
installed, NetShade will automatically protect your ARA and LAN data as well;
see
the description of <A href="netshade.html">NetShade v1.1</A> for more
information.)</A>

<A name="integrate"></A>
<H2><A name="integrate">Can AtemiConnect's technology be integrated into
other
applications?</A>
</H2><P><A name="integrate">Yes, easily.  Application developers will find
AtemiConnect to
be the easiest way to add Internet support to any LAN-based application.</A>
<P><A name="integrate">
AtemiConnect is designed to operate independently of all types of applications,
so this technology can be bundled onto any LAN application just by adding
AtemiConnect to that application's installation disk.  This will add value
not
only to the application, which will now be able to communicate across the
Internet, but also to your customers' Internet connections: they will be
able to
use the Internet to share data and resources around the world.  For more
