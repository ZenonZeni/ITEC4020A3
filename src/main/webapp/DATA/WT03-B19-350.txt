Dear Reviewer,<br>
<p>
In case you have not seen it, this is essentially the current <br>
Book Review web page. I am sending it mainly because it contains<br>
the latest list of books we have for review. If you are interested <br>
in reviewing them please let me know direct.<br>
<p>
Tanks, Brian.<br>

                    Chemistry in Australia. Book Reviews.<br>
<p>
The "Chemistry in Australia" Book Reviews are now edited by Brian<br>
Salter-Duke and Naseem Peerzada from the Northern Territory University.<br>
<p>
New interface for seeking prospective reviewers.<br>
<p>
We want as much as possible to carry out correspondence with reviewers and<br>
to seek reviews using the internet. If you are willing to review books,<br>
please send us some details via a special forms interface or send e-mail to<br>
the Book Review account <a href="mailto:raci@lacebark.ntu.edu.au">raci@lacebark.ntu.edu.au</a>, giving an indication of<br>
the type of book you would like to receive. Alternatively fax us on<br>
08-89410460 or phone 08-89466702 (Brian) or 08-89466360 (Naseem). The forms<br>
interface is now the prefered method.<br>
<p>
RACI-BOOKS - a new e-mail list for reviewers<br>
<p>
We have developed an e-mail list for everyone interesting in reviewing<br>
books. You can request subscription to the list from the forms interface<br>
mentioned above. The list will be moderated by the book review editors but<br>
general comments on book reviewing, of interest to all reviewers, are<br>
welcome. The editor of "Chemistry in Australia" will also be a subscriber to<br>
the list. When we get books we will send out details to the list in order to<br>
seek reviewers. Of course we will also continue the previous editor's<br>
practice of just selecting reviewers in some cases.<br>
<p>
List messages to web page - NEW!<br>
<p>
The list has another special feature. All messages are automatically added<br>
to a web page using software called "hypermail". Click here to enter this<br>
page to read all the messages. This means you do not have to keep the e-mail<br>
messages you receive. You can always read them over the web!<br>
<p>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<p>
Currently (January 17th) we have the following waiting to assign reviewers<br>
(None listed here before!):-<br>
<p>
This is a tentative list as Cyclone Rachel prevented a meeting between the<br>
editors before Naseem went off on recreational leave. There may be others I<br>
have missed.<br>
<p>
   * Alternative Fuels, Sunggyu Lee, Taylor and Francis.<br>
   * Antibacterial Chemotherapeutic Agents, S. L. Dax, Blackie Academic.<br>
   * Archaeological Chemistry, Ed Mary Virginia Orna, ACS.<br>

Interface to listproc raci-books mailing lists<br>
<p>
If you have subscibed to this list, or were put on the list by the editors,<br>
you can use this interface to query the list, unsubscribe, etc.<br>
<p>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<p>
As time goes on, we will add further information to this page on guidelines<br>
for reviewers, etc. or send these quidelines out to the list.<br>
