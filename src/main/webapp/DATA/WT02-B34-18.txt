Mitsui Toatsu forms acrylamide venture

from CHEMICAL BUSINESS NEWSBASE, 12 Nov 1996

Ref: Chemicalweek Asia, 5 Nov 1996, Vol. 2, No. 19, Pg. 5

A project to construct Indonesia's first acrylamide monomer facility is
being undertaken by a joint venture between Baylite, an investment
company based in the British Virgin Islands, Indonesian company PT
Eterindo Anugerah Prakarsa, and Mitsui Toatsu Chemicals.

The joint venture is called PT Mitsui Eterindo Chemicals (MEC) and it
plans to construct a 10,000 tonnes/y facility at Serang, West Java.

MEC says the plant is scheduled onstream in Jul 1997 at an estimated
cost of $9.6 M.

About 50% of MEC's production will be sold on the domestic market and
the rest exported.

NPC-TOC merger may be scrapped

from CHEMICAL BUSINESS NEWSBASE, 12 Nov 1996

Ref: Chemicalweek Asia, 5 Nov 1996, Vol. 2, No. 19, Pg. 5

Plans for a merger between Thailand's National Petrochemical Co (NPC)
and Thai Olefins may be abandoned.

A decision is expected by the end of 1996.

Questions have been raised over the appropriateness of the merger,
since it may adversely affect the profitability of NPC.

State-owned Petroleum Authority of Thailand, which has a 37% interest
in NPC and a 49% interest in Thai Olefins, first proposed the merger in
1H 1996.

In 1995 NPC recorded a net profit of Baht 420 M but Thai Olefins has
been recording losses since it started up in 1995.

Storage market heats up as regional demand rises

from CHEMICAL BUSINESS NEWSBASE, 12 Nov 1996

Ref: Chemicalweek Asia, 5 Nov 1996, Vol. 2, No. 19, Pg. 5

There is a broad diversity of storage tanks farms in Asia in terms of
size and distribution facilities.

As the region's chemical industry expands, a growing number of
companies are building up-to-date tank farms or are currently planning
their construction.

Singapore dominates the Southeast Asian storage market but there is
growing competition from Malaysia.

The tanks farms are needed not only to meet rapid trade demand but also
to supply the expanding domestic industry.

Major storage tanks companies operating in the region include GATX, Van
Ommeron, and Fimachem Sdn Bhd/ Fima Liquid Bulking.

Fima subscribes to Malaysia's Responsible Care programme.

Several new chemical tank farm projects are planned.

In addition, GATX and Petronas are planning a joint venture terminal at
the location of Petronas' worldscale petrochemical facility at Kertih.

GATX will hold a 30% interest in the venture with Petronas taking 40%.

The remaining 30% will be held by Malaysian Capital Ventures and
Dialog.

The Philippines: government steps up search for foreign investment

from CHEMICAL BUSINESS NEWSBASE, 12 Nov 1996

Ref: Chemicalweek Asia, 5 Nov 1996, Vol. 2, No. 19, Pg. 3

The Philippines Board of Investment is attempting to attract more
foreign investment into the country by holding talks with several major
chemical companies.

Chemicals have been identified as a priority industry by the
Philippines Ministry of Industrial Development.

In 1996 a consortium of Petrocorp, BPC, Itochu, BP Chemicals, Bataan
Polyethylene Holdings, PPDC, and Petron Corp have signed a memorandum
of understanding to undertake a $1 bn naphtha cracker project.

The Philippines wants to compete with Malaysia and Singapore for
foreign investment.

Singapore is planning its third olefins facility.

The country is looking to make its investment incentive scheme more
attractive than those of its rival neighbouring countries.

One possibility will be to offer industrial land at a 25% discount for
projects which are joint ventures with local companies.

A list of local companies which are major consumers of chemicals is
also being drawn up so that demand levels can be assessed so that a
ready market for investors can provided.

In the past investors have believed that the government has given
little support to the chemical industry and so have not shown much
interest.

But the government is now trying to improve its image and moves are
also underway to improve the country's development of its
infrastructure.

CPC shelves cracker relocation project

from CHEMICAL BUSINESS NEWSBASE, 12 Nov 1996

Ref: Chemicalweek Asia, 5 Nov 1996, Vol. 2, No. 19, Pg. 2

Plans to relocate Chinese Petroleum Corp's (CPC's) mothballed number 2
naphtha cracker to Indonesia have been dropped as a consequence of a
government freeze on state-owned CPC's foreign investments.

CPC's plans for a petrochemical area in Malaysia have also been
postponed.

The economics ministry of Taiwan has stopped all CPC's foreign projects

Philippines cracker scale up

from CHEMICAL BUSINESS NEWSBASE, 12 Nov 1996

Ref: Chemicalweek Asia, 5 Nov 1996, Vol. 2, No. 19, Pg. 1

A large capacity plant has been recommended following a feasibility
study into the Philippines' first ethylene complex.

It is now anticipated that the capacity of the $500-600 M facility, to
be constructed in the industrial park at Mariveles, Bataan, will be
600,000 tonnes/y of ethylene and 300,000 tonnes/y of propylene.

The original plan was for 450,000 tonnes/y of ethylene.

Japanese interests have also proposed a second polyethylene plant for
the complex.

The Philippines Petrochemical Development Corp is also attempting to
bring in J G Summit to co- invest in the Mariveles cracker.

Local entrepreneur Antonio Garcia has a 33% interest in Petrocorp,
which is constructing the country's first polypropylene facility and is
a shareholder in Bataan Polyethylene Corp (BPC).

Garcia wants control of the cracker and wants PPDC to either reduce its
share or withdraw completely from the consortium.

Offtake arrangements from the cracker are at present being negotiated
by Petrocorp and BPC.

The cracker is scheduled for completion in 2000.

Front-end design is being conducted by BPC on its 200,000 tonnes/y
Innovene-process linear low-density polyethylene facility.

The second polyethylene facility would produce other grades.

Petrocorp has almost completed its polypropylene plant, which in 1Q
1997 will output 160,000 tonnes/y.

Capacity will be expanded almost immediately to 225,000 tonnes/y.

Members of the Mariveles cracker consortium are Petrocorp, BPC, Itochu,
BP Chemicals, PPDC, and Petron Corp.

About 33% of the naphtha requirement will be obtained from domestic
refineries and the rest will be imported by Itochu.

A 70,000 tonnes/y polyvinyl chloride facility will be constructed at
Mariveles by Mabuhay Vinyl, Tosoh, Bank of the Philippine Islands, and
Mitsubishi.

JG Summit is progressing with the building of Unipol process 200,000
tonnes/y polyethylene and 180,000 tonnes/y polypropylene units in
Batangas, south of Manila.

JG Summit also intends to construct a 500,000 tonnes/y ethylene unit in
Batangas.

11-12,14,16,18

The following are examples of new technologies using electrochemistry
for pollution prevention or reduction in industry.

Physical Sciences Inc, Andover, MA, has developed an electrochemical
synthetic method of producing hydrogen peroxide as an alternative to
chlorine for the pulp and paper industry.

It is based on a gas diffusion electrode formulation which has better
operating characteristics than the trickle bed technology developed by
Dow.

Long term tests are planned to determine the lifetime of the cathodes.

The company aims to have cathode lifetimes of the order of 1 year or
more.

Electrosynthesis Co has developed a 'salt-splitting process' to produce
caustic soda without the co-production of chlorine.

The process has been verified in a pilot plant in Saskatchewan.

A full scale plant is under construction at the same site.

The Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, has developed a more
environmentally friendly process for the electrochemical manufacture of
sodium hydrosulfite.

Olin Corp, the only major producer of electrochemically manufactured
sodium hydrosulfite has licensed the technology to Vulcan Materials Co
to be used in its Port Edwards, WI, facility for distribution to local
pulp and paper mills.

Farady Technology Inc, Dayton, OH, is developing a electrochemical
treatment system, together with Los Alamos National Laboratory, NM, to
simultaneously destroy several wastes in plant recycling streams.

The process has been successfully demonstrated at Los Alamos where 10
different wastes with radioactive and other hazardous waste products
were separated.

1995, but the weighted average of prices, mainly petrochemicals and
organic chemicals, fell by 9.6%, except for fertilizers where Chinese
Government intervention caused a rise of 22%.

The plant operated at capacity to process 1.64 M tonnes of crude oil
for 1H 1996 which was 6.5% more than 1H 1995.

The company was having to pay more for its crude oil yet prices of its

There was a shortage of this material in the summer of 1995.

Many companies, both public and private, started to make melatonin,
with manufacturers from India and East Europe.

This brought the price down from $12,000/kg in Aug 1995 to $6000/kg in
spring 1996 and then to the present $1200/kg.

The consumption in the USA has dropped from 1000 kg in Aug 1995 to
200-300 kg/month.

China now has a melatonin capacity of twice the level of consumption in

Bayer has developed a cost-effective process for producing polyaspartic
acids (PAAs) directly from maleic anhydride.

PAAs are good substitutes for polycarboxylates in circumstances where
biodegradability is important.

PAAs are good dispersing and sequestering agents and are therefore
useful in preventing sedimentation in aqueous dispersions and slurries.

They suppress the formation of deposits in cooling circuits and in
boiler and feed water treatment.

PAAs are also suitable for use as dispersing and softening agents in
detergents.

The polyaspartic acids will be supplied as salts in aqueous solution.

A pilot plant of 2000 tonnes capacity will be built within 1997-1998.

Analysts predict no growth for Nycomed between 1996 and 1998

from CHEMICAL BUSINESS NEWSBASE, 12 Nov 1996

Ref: Dagens Naeringsliv, 28 Oct 1996, Vol. 107, No. 250, Pg. 19

Original text in NORWEGIAN

According to analysts' forecasts, Nycomed, Norway, will only achieve
marginal growth between 1996 and 1998 and the company itself is not
predicting much development over this period.

The pressure on prices of imaging products in the US came much sooner
and much more sharply than expected.

Nycomed has made plans to reduce costs in its main areas of operation.

One analyst suggests that cost savings of at least NKR 400-500 M need
to be made in 1998 for any significant effect to be achieved.

AGA reduces 1996 forecast

from CHEMICAL BUSINESS NEWSBASE, 12 Nov 1996

Ref: Dagens Industri, 5 Nov 1996, Vol. 21, No. 237, Pg. 34

Original text in SWEDISH

AGA is reducing its results forecast for 1996 to 15% less than that of
1995, which means around SKR 1.8 bn.

The company reported a turnover of SKR 9523 M in 1-3Q 1996, 5% down on
1-3Q 1995, while operating results were down 19% to SKR 1199 M.

The downturn was attributed to the stronger Swedish krona and also the
fact that AGA is expanding at a time of weak economic development in
several countries in Europe and Latin America.

The company invested nearly SKR 2.1 bn in new facilities over the
period Jan-Sep 1996, equivalent to 22% of sales, while a number of
smaller gas companies were acquired.

Approval was recently granted for the purchase of 4 new gas units from
Praxair for SKR 1.3 bn.

1995, while pretax results were up 8% to SKR 9850 M.

Both figures were in accordance with forecasts.

The majority of the company's products showed an increase in sales of
less than 10%, whereas Losec managed a growth of 12%, meaning that it
accounted for 45% of Astra's sales in 1-3Q 1996, compared with 12% for
Pulmicort and 6.5% for Seloken.

Sales growth occurred mainly in the US, with no increase registered in
Europe.

It is expected that Pulmicort will be approved for the US market within
one month.

In 1-3Q 1996 Nycomed reported pretax results of NKR 898 M, less than
the NKR 1321 M in 1-3Q 1995 and less than analysts' forecast of NKR 914
M.

The fall in profits was attributed to a strong pressure on prices.

Total sales of the contrast media Omnipaque, Imagopaque, and Visipaque
in Europe and other markets outside N America were, however, up 11%,
though it is thought that continuing pressure on the prices of these
products in the US will affect results for the remainder of 1996.

The company's newly launched Fokus 98 programme will lead to
restructuring costs of NKR 700 M in 4Q 1996.

The programme should lead to cost reductions of NKR 600 M/y by 1998.

The Swedish gases company AGA could also be seen to be that country's
fourth largest pharmaceuticals firm, with its Pharma medicines business
group having turnover of SKR 1.7 bn.

AGA hopes that its oxygen and nitrous oxide, which it supplies on a
large scale to hospitals, will be classified as pharmaceuticals.

Nitrous oxide, which is sold by Pharma, can be administered to patients
with serious lung damage, where it opens the injured part of the lung
and secures the acid balance in the blood.

It has been approved as a pharmaceutical in only a few countries,
though it is being used on a trial basis in a number of hospitals.

AGA wants to obtain a European patent for this method and also thinks
that nitrous oxide treatment can expanded to other types of patients.

Nolato is seen as an attractive takeover candidate, though the firm
says it is not interested in selling.

Trelleborg, which now owns Horda and Vaernamo Gummi in Sweden's
so-called rubber belt, aims to double the turnover of its rubber
division from the SKR 4.4 bn reported in 1995, and this could well be

Maize herbicides: the end of an era

Ref: Circuits Culture, Oct 1996, No. Hors serie, Pg. 18,20

Original text in FRENCH

Little change is expected in the strategies employed by French maize
growers in 1997.

However, the market is likely to alter radically with the arrival of
genetically modified varieties and the withdrawal of older active
ingredients.

Compounds which could possibly be withdrawn include dinoterb, atrazine,
alachlor, pendimethalin, bromoxynil and pyridate.

This is unlikely to happen before the year 2000.

Weed control has become a much more pressing problem for growers in
some areas of SW France.

This has led to an increase in the use of graminicides for both pre-
and post-emergence treatments.

Cyanamid is to actively promote pendimethalin in 1997.

Monsanto has abandoned its Toptech formulation of Lasso in favour of
Microtech.

Ciba is putting particular emphasis on the use of Safener.

which currently stands at 650 tonnes/y, is set to rise to 3500 tonnes/y
by 2000.

Current demand for isophthalic acid is 8000 tonnes/y using 5500 tonnes
of m-xylene.

By 2000 consumption of around 12,000 tonnes/y is expected with the use
of 8000 tonnes/y of m-xylene.

Chinese consumption of 2,4-xylidine in the production of amitraz and
danjiami, which currently stands at 700 tonnes/y, is predicted to rise
to 4000 tonnes.

Use of 2,4-xylidine in the production of dyes is 400 tonnes/y.

Demand for 2,6-xylidine for the production of fungicide metalaxyl is
500 tonnes/y and in the production of pharmaceutical ledocain and
xylidinothiazoline is 200 tonnes/y.

Around 2000 tonnes of high purity m-xylene is currently required to
meet the demand for 1800 tonnes/y of 2,4 and 2,6 xylidine.

By 2000 around 5500 tonnes of high purity m-xylene will be required to
meet the demand for 5000 tonnes/y of 2,4 and 2,6-xylene.

Total Chinese demand for m-xylene is expected to rise by 10%/y from its

Incroquat Behenyl HE is a 50% active mono-alkyl amidoamine quaternary
that is suitable for clear systems and which possesses good mildness.

Incroquat HO-80PG is a highly active dialkyl amido quaternary that has
a softening effect on the hair.

Both molecules contain a hydroxyethyl group, giving them greater water
dispersibility than normal quaternaries.

They are also biodegradable since both are based on vegetable oils.

PEI and hair care

from CHEMICAL BUSINESS NEWSBASE, 12 Nov 1996

Ref: Drug and Cosmetic Industry (DCI), Aug 1996, Vol. 159, No. 2, Pg. 55

Summit Specialty Chemical Corp and Polymer Enterprises Inc have formed
an alliance to provide technical and marketing services for
polyethylenimine (PEI).

PEI is a branched aliphatic polyamine that possesses high cationic
charge density and the ability to enhance the binding efficiency of
nonsubstantive materials to a large number of substrates via surface
charge interactions.

It can be used as a levelling agent before shampooing or chemical
treatment as it binds to keratin through charge attachment to anionic
sites on the hair.

It binds to damaged areas first as theses have a higher localised
negative charge.

PEI is removed from the shaft of the hair during shampooing but it
remains in the cracks and damaged areas.

PEI's overall effect is to equalise the charge density of the hair.

A superior performance fixative for low VOC applications, Lovocryl-47,
has been introduced by National Starch and Chemical.

Lovocryl-47 is a hydrophobically-modified acrylic polymer that was
formulated for use in low VOC pump and aerosol hair sprays, setting
lotions and water-containing mousses.

It overcomes the effects of water in a broad range of hair spray VOC
contents and produces extremely low solution viscosity.

Very fine atomization is therefore achievable, even at high solids
levels.

Ref: Dagens Naeringsliv, 1 Nov 1996, Vol. 107, No. 254, Pg. 23

Original text in NORWEGIAN

In 3Q 1996 Nycomed reported an operating income of NKR 5749 M, 7% down
on 3Q 1995, while pretax results were down 32% to NKR 898 M.

The main reason for the downturn was a 23% fall in the price of
contrast agents in the US since 1 Jan 1996, with sales volumes also
down by 2%.

To cope with even stiffer competition Nycomed has launched its Fokus-98
programme which should result in a reduction in costs of NKR 600 M/y by
1998 and 600-700 jobs being cut from the 5700-strong workforce,
including 200 in Norway. 50-70% of the cost reduction target should be
achieved in 1997.

The biggest savings will come in the area of research and development,
where expenditure will be cut by NKR 180 M/y (19%), while production
costs will be brought down by NKR 150-170 M/y (12%) and sales and
marketing costs by NKR 110-140 M (8%).

Jotun results up in Jan-Aug 1996

from CHEMICAL BUSINESS NEWSBASE, 12 Nov 1996

Ref: Dagens Naeringsliv, 31 Oct 1996, Vol. 107, No. 253, Pg. 14

Original text in NORWEGIAN

In the second third of 1996 the paints company Jotun reported an
operating income of NKR 3374 M, which is NKR 274 M more than in the
same period in 1995, while results before extraordinary items increased
by NKR 58 M to NKR 262 M.

These results were weaker than expected and Jotun is continuing its
efforts to improve profitability.

Figures for the whole of 1996 are expected to be better than those of
1995.

The decorative paints division Jotun Dekorativ increased its operating
income as paint sales rose in summer; the markets are in both Denmark
and Sweden.

The international paints division Jotun Paints showed a positive
development in results, whereas Jotun Polymer reported a fall in
operating income but an increase in results.

The powder lacquers division Jotun Powder Coatings achieved higher
operating income but lower results.

In 3Q 1996 Elkem, Norway, reported an operating result which was NKR
148 M down on 2Q 1996 and NKR 115 M down on 3Q 1995.

The company was dissatisfied with the figures and says that in future a
great deal of emphasis will be placed on cutting costs.

It also suggested that a major part of future expansion will be in the
area of energy generation.

The 3Q results were adversely affected by a deficit in Elkem's
production of its own energy, a writing off of ferrochromium stocks,
and a seasonal dip in volumes.

Prices also reduced results for manganese alloys and aluminium.

Axis Biochemicals agreement with Boehringer Mannheim

from CHEMICAL BUSINESS NEWSBASE, 12 Nov 1996

Ref: Dagens Naeringsliv, 30 Oct 1996, Vol. 107, No. 252, Pg. 21

Original text in NORWEGIAN

Axis Biochemicals is entering into an agreement with Boehringer
Mannheim which could double its turnover many times over.

The deal involves the German firm acquiring Axis' technology for the
measurement of glycohaemoglobin in return for royalty payments on 6% of
sales.

The test acts as a more stable alternative to conventional tests of
blood sugar levels for diabetics, the market for which is currently NKR
600 M.

Its launch should take place in a little over 2 years.

When the technology is adapted to Boehringer Mannheim's analysis
apparatus it will enable it to win a major share of the total market
for such tests, of which Boehringer Mannheim has a 35% share.

This will mean royalties of around NKR 40 M/y for Axis Biochemicals.

Czechs back off Norwegian natural gas agreement

from CHEMICAL BUSINESS NEWSBASE, 12 Nov 1996

Ref: Dagens Naeringsliv, 30 Oct 1996, Vol. 107, No. 252, Pg. 16

Original text in NORWEGIAN

At the end of Jul 1996 the Czech gas importer Transgas entered into a
provisional agreement with Gassforhandlingsutvalget (GFU), Norway, for
the supply of 25% of the Czech Republic's gas consumption over the next
20 years but the authorities in Prague are now backing down and
suggesting a compromise deal.

The government's department of industry believes that it was a tactical
blunder to enter into such an agreement before negotiations had begun
with Russia in 1998 over a reform of the existing long term supply
agreement.

It is thought that Russia will always be the Czechs' major supplier and
that the deal could therefore provoke Gazprom, Russia, which has
hitherto had a monopoly of supply to the Czech Republic, into raising
prices for the next long term contract.

Transgas had also shown itself willing to pay up to 20% more for the
Norwegian gas.

The Czech authorities will consider 3 alternative proposals: Russia
maintains its 100% supply; Russia supplies the natural gas but via
Gasunie, Netherlands, and Wintershall, Germany; Norwegian and Dutch gas
is supplied through a number of W European and US distribution
companies.

country.

Petrokemya is to build a world-scale olefins complex that will
incorporate 275,000 tonnes/y of propylene and 800,000 tonnes/y of
ethylene.

Sharq is to invest in a 450,000 tonnes/y ethylene glycol unit.

It will also debottleneck capacity for LLDPE by 300,000 tonnes/y using
technology from Union Carbide.

Both projects are in Al Jubail.

Yanpet is to add a second 830,000 tonnes/y cracker to its site at
Yanbu.

It will also build downstream units, including 535,000 tonnes/y of PE,
260,000 tonnes/y of PP and 410,000 tonnes/y of MEG.

Project management is being undertaken by Lummus Global.

The entire project will cost $2 bn.

Aga, Sweden, and Ohmeda, the healthcare branch of BOC, are to
collaborate on research into the use of nitric oxide (NO) for treating
lung diseases.

The collaboration will focus on phase III trials for treating Acute
Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) and hypoxic respiratory failure in

NO is found naturally in the body, where it has a relaxing effect on
blood vessels, increasing the flow of blood.

It is known to have a short-term effect on patients, but the long-term
benefits are unknown.

The 2 companies have signed a licensing agreement with the
Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston which was granted a patent in
1990 for work it undertook on NO in the 1980s.

The US courts have dismissed a lawsuit taken out by the Schering

Administration over Biogen's drug, Avonex (interferon beta-1a), which
is used to treat multiple sclerosis.

Berlex had alleged that the FDA's approval of Avonex was improper. the
court has found that the FDA acted lawfully when it claimed that
Berlex's Betaseron was clinically inferior to Avonex under the terms of
the orphan drug law and that the FDA's ruling that Avonex is potent,
pure and safe is well supported by the records.

Both companies are still involved in a dispute over a patent for

Award for Chiroscience single isomer research

from CHEMICAL BUSINESS NEWSBASE, 12 Nov 1996

Ref: European Chemical News, 28 Oct 1996, Vol. 66, No. 1738, Pg. 27

Research and development work at Chiroscience has discovered a new
crystallisation method that may be applied to chiral resolution, giving
cheaper technology for manufacturing single isomers.

The researchers found that crystallisation of certain racemates occurs
by oscillation of the enantiomeric composition.

The new process will allow crystallisation processes to be stopped at
the precise point when an appropriate isomer has crystallised, allowing
separation from its mirror image isomer.

The work was undertaken on bicyclic lactam.

Production of this molecule is usually effected by biocatalytic
resolution of the racemate.

The work has received an Industrial Innovation Team Award from the UK's
Royal Society of Chemistry.

Zinc oxide: greater UV block for creams and coatings

from CHEMICAL BUSINESS NEWSBASE, 12 Nov 1996

Ref: European Chemical News, 28 Oct 1996, Vol. 66, No. 1738, Pg. 25

Durham Chemicals, part of the Harcros Chemical Group, has developed a
new grade of zinc oxide, called Nanox, which will be used in varnishes
and sun-blocking creams.

The zinc oxide has been manufactured in very small particle sizes and
is transparent when used in creams.

This innovation allows higher concentrations of the zinc oxide in
creams than existing sunblocks.

Durham is also investigating the use of the zinc oxide in paints and
coatings, as wood undergoes a degree of degradation in UV light.

The company has also started up a 3000 tonnes/y plant at Birtley, UK,
to manufacture its Activox catalysts.

The zinc oxide catalysts are used in the production of rubber and in
desulfurisation.

Criterion Catalysts, US, claims it has made a breakthrough in catalyst
technology with its nickel-molybdenum hydrotreating catalyst.

It will be produced at a $10 M, 4540 tonnes/y plant at Michigan City,
IN, which is scheduled to start up in 1997.

Full production will be achieved in early 1998.

The new catalyst allows extra hydrodenitrification and polynuclear
aromatics separation in cat feed, high-pressure hydrotreaters.

The new catalysts have been undergoing tests with refining companies
and one is expected to install a commercially produced catalyst system
in 1996.

Criterion's catalyst regeneration subsidiary, Catalyst Recovery, has
raised the capacity of its catalyst recycling plant at Lafayette, LA,
by 30-40%.

The expansion includes the installation of the OptiCAT-plus process and
it is expected to start up in mid 1997.

The process uses fluidised pre-treatment to control the elevated
initial exotherms found in regeneration, followed by a moderate heat
soak to eliminate sulfur and carbon for the catalyst.

The company is also raising its alumina powder capacity at Michigan
City by 15% and its catalyst extrudate capacity at Pittsburgh, CA, site
by 30%.

The alumina powder expansion will be completed in 1997 at a cost of $18
M.

The UK chemical distribution trade association, BCDTA, claims that
although Responsible Care figures show a drop in the number of
accidents, results should be interpreted cautiously.

Accidents fell 32% in 1995 to 1121 lost-time accidents for every
100,000 employees.

Dangerous transport incidents, defined as those that required the help
of emergency services or which involved dangerous substances, fell to
28 from 34 in 1994.

This is equivalent to 1 accident for every 27,027 deliveries made.

In 1995, the industry transported 53,000 tonnes of special waste (toxic
chemicals), of which 24,466 tonnes was recycled.

Controlled waste transport fell from 36,312 tonnes in 1994 to 34,681
tonnes in 1995.

Procter and Gamble is facing prosecution over a pollution incident in
Ireland that has left the town of Nenagh, County Tipperary, without
drinking water for 4 months.

Residents have relied on supplies of drinking water brought in by
tanker since siloxanes were discovered in the town's mains water
supply.

A second borehole has also been found to be contaminated, and there are
now concerns that the entire water table may be unfit to drink.

Samples from a third borehole are currently being examined.

The Irish Environmental Protection Agency has blamed the pollution on
the local Procter and Gamble plant and has initiated legal action.

Procter and Gamble is disputing the charge and claims that the
contamination resulted from a fouled drain which was the responsibility
of Shannon Development.

The plant's process effluent was discharged into the drain with the
consent of the local authority.

One of Procter and Gamble's suppliers, the plastic packaging company,
Tubex, will also be prosecuted as well as Procter and Gamble and
Shannon Development.

In the financial year ended 31 Aug 1996, Perstorp, Sweden, reported a
pretax profit of SKR 716 M compared to SKR 745 M in the previous
financial year.

Sales fell to SKR 12.93 bn from SKR 13 bn.

The speciality chemicals sector was blamed for the bulk of the decline.

Sales by the speciality chemicals division fell from SKR 2.34 bn in the
year ending 31 Aug 1995 to SKR 2.13 bn in the year ending 31 Aug 1996.

Lower margins in Europe and poor demand for polyols was cited as the
reason for the decline.

Perstorp hopes that markets in eastern Europe will be opened up by the
marketing agreement with Moravske Chemike Zavody (MCHZ), Czech
Republic.

The venture will start off by selling Perstorp's products in the Czech
republic, although it will eventually become a production site.

The Chemitec division reported a fall in sales from SKR 1.36 bn to SKR
1.26 bn although profits remained at SKR 42 bn in the year ended 31 Aug

Norsk Hydro, Norway, is hoping for an improvement in VCM and PVC prices
in 4Q 1996 to boost its petrochemicals profits.

In 3Q 1996 income fell in its petrochemicals, agriculture and light
metals divisions.

The oil and gas division put in a good performance with sales of NKR

from CHEMICAL BUSINESS NEWSBASE, 12 Nov 1996

Ref: European Chemical News, 28 Oct 1996, Vol. 66, No. 1738, Pg. 11

Reduced demand for ammonium nitrate in the UK and high imports from
Russia may put prices under pressure.

Spot prices from UK producers are put at #132-135/tonne and
#122-125/tonne for imported material.

At the same time in 1995, spot prices were #115-120/tonne.

The target price of #150/tonne for spring 1997 is not expected to be
met. the French market for ammonium nitrate is flat, but prices are 10%
higher than in the UK.

Imports of ammonium nitrate into the UK from Russia, Lithuania and
eastern Europe have risen 54% to 733,000 tonnes in 1995-1996 compared
to 1994-1995.

Imports from Russia doubled from 152,000 tonnes to 398,000 tonnes.

Imports from other countries have fallen from 349,000 tonnes in

The double digit growth rates for polycarbonates experienced in Europe
in the last few years are expected to decline to 5% in 1996.

Underlying growth is however put at 10%/y and the outlook for 1997 is
good. demand for PC for use in the production of extruded sheets for
the building industry is lower than expected and demand from the
compact disc industry has been lower in 1996 than in 1995.

Both these sectors have seen a price drop of 40-50 pfg/kg.

Injection moulding prices have fallen by 10-20 pfg/kg despite growth in
demand of 5%/y.

Upstream, the price of bisphenol A for 4Q 1996 contracts in Europe has
rolled over from 3Q 1996 at DM 2.00-2.20/kg FD and phenol prices have
been set at DM 1150-1250/kg FD.

Para-xylene manufacturers are facing a bleak future in the next 2-3
years, especially in Europe.

There are 11 producers in Europe, with an average capacity of 135,000
tonnes/y.

A further round of restructuring is anticipated, with the smaller
producers being particularly vulnerable.

Prices for para-xylene are forecast to stay in the range 17-19 cents/lb
until at least 1998.

New PTA capacity will keep a cap on PTA prices, thus restraining
para-xylene prices.

Para-xylene producers in the US have the benefit of economies of scale
compared to European producers.

Seven independent manufacturers in the US have an average capacity of
445,000 tonnes/y.

Asia is increasing its para-xylene capacity as part of a move to
greater downstream integration.

Poland's productivity breaks pre-reform levels

from CHEMICAL BUSINESS NEWSBASE, 12 Nov 1996

Ref: European Chemical News, 28 Oct 1996, Vol. 66, No. 1738, Pg. 8

The Polish chemical association, PIPC, claims that the country's
chemical output is exceeding pre-economic transition levels for the
first time.

Output in 1995 was up 2% on 1989, the year that Poland started economic
reforms.

However, production of fertilizers, drugs, fibres and crude oil
processing products are still less than in 1989.

Poland's imports of chemicals still exceed exports by $3 bn.

Since 1992, Poland's negative trade balance has grown, with imports
reaching $5.23 bn in 1995, compared to exports of $2.3 bn.

There is scope for improvement.

Poland's output of plastics rose 9.8% in 1995, but production did not
meet demand.

This resulted in the need to import $2 bn worth of plastics.

This situation could be remedied by investing in a new refinery and
petrochemicals complex.

Poland's exports to EU member countries amounted to $1.27 bn in 1995,
whilst it imported $3.65 M worth of chemical products from the EU.

Its exports to the former Soviet Union amounted to $439.3 M whereas
imports amounted to $302.4 M.

PIPC has criticised the lack of foreign investment in Poland, despite
its cheap and skilled workforce and developed infrastructure.

ventures established with foreign companies.

The launch of any new joint ventures via share swaps has also been
outlawed.

The Chinese government introduced the rule to prevent westernisation of
its domestic products, whilst ensuring the development of priority
segments of the chemical sector, such as tyres and soda ash.

Direct foreign investments are being encouraged in fertilizers,
synthetic materials, ethylene and fine chemicals via wholly-owned or
joint venture operations.

In the past decade, there have been 5450 ventures set up in China with
foreign investment, involving $2 bn in direct investments.

China is planning to list several enterprises on overseas stock markets
to raise funds for priority operations.

Teesside representatives want a direct pipeline from the North Sea to
an onshore site which would separate the gas.

Propane and ethane fractions would be piped to Grangemouth via another
new pipeline and the methane would be piped to Zeebrugge via Bacton.

BP is planning to debottleneck its crackers at Grangemouth to 700,000
tonnes/y to 1.2 M tonnes/y.

The company would prefer to have the gas fractionation plant offshore
as it will need a cost-effective, direct supply of propane and ethane.

C1 streams would be piped to Teesside via an existing pipeline, then to
Bacton, then Zeebrugge.

Recession holds back chemicals

from CHEMICAL BUSINESS NEWSBASE, 12 Nov 1996

Ref: European Chemical News, 28 Oct 1996, Vol. 66, No. 1738, Pg. 5

Federchimica, the Italian chemical industry association, claims that
Italian chemical output will only rise 0.8% over 1995 levels.

The rise will only be 2% if drugs are included.

Growth of not more than 2% is also forecast for 1997, with the bulk of
this being down to exports.

The strength of the lira an poor prices will prevent Italy from
benefiting from strong growth in the global chemical sector.

The Italian chemical industry is out of step with the rest of the
European chemical sector due to the prevailing recession.

Exports will not grow by more than 4% in 1997 and domestic demand will
rise 1.5-2%.

Depressed prices will result in a 1.3% drop in sales to ITL 82 trillion
in 1996.

Exports in 1996 are expected to grow by 3.5% or 4.5% if drugs are
included.

The chemical sector's balance of trade is put at ITL 12 trillion in
1996, an ITL 2.5 trillion gain on 1995.

ICI's industrial chemicals see zero profits in 3Q 1996

from CHEMICAL BUSINESS NEWSBASE, 12 Nov 1996

Ref: European Chemical News, 28 Oct 1996, Vol. 66, No. 1738, Pg. 5

ICI's paints division had a record quarter in 3Q 1996, with sales of
#665 M compared to #569 M in 3Q 1995.

Earnings in 3Q 1996 were #57 M (#32 M).

However, this good result failed to counteract the poor performance of
industrial chemicals which saw a drop in sales in 3Q 1996 to #954 M
from #1010 M.

The industrial chemicals division recorded no earnings in 3Q 1996
compared to #124 M in 3Q 1995.

Overall, ICI's sales in 3Q 1996 rose 1.8% to #2668 M (#2622 M) and its
earnings fell to #147 M (#260 M).

Pretax profits in 3Q 1996 totalled #131 M (up 47%).

The company cites the competitive climate in the worldwide chemicals
industry for the decline.

Industrial chemicals were under pressure from reduced selling prices
for chlorine, titanium dioxide and polyesters.

The good performance of the paints sector was attributed to strong
growth in retail sector and Asia.

The explosives division doubled its profits in 3Q 1996.

Weak PTA leads Interquisa to stay with PIA

Production of purified isophthalic acid (PIA) is to be continued by
Interquisa at its San Roque facility.

One of the company's three purified terephthalic acid (PTA) lines will
be devoted to PIA production because of slow demand for PTA.

Total PTA capacity at the site is 400,000 tonne/y.

Availability of meta-xylene feedstock will limit output of PIA.

A small increase in demand for polyester is understood to have led
Amoco to switch some PIA production at Geel, Belgium, to PTA.

Shareholder pressure: new bid for Rexene

from CHEMICAL BUSINESS NEWSBASE, 12 Nov 1996

Ref: European Chemical News, 4 Nov 1996, Vol. 66, No. 1739, Pg. 4

A 7% stake in Rexene has been acquired by a group called Rexene
Investors.

The stake is worth $16 M.

The group is to seek to remove the current Rexene board through a
special shareholders' meeting.

There was a 30% drop in operating income in 3Q 1996 to $18.3 M, and
sales were slightly down at $150 M.

This poor performance is part of the reason for the shareholders'
dissatisfaction.

In Aug 1996, Rexene rejected a takeover bid from Huntsman.

This has resulted in a number of lawsuits being filed by shareholders
which accuse the board of not making sufficient consideration of the
offer.

Plastic film, styrene, polyethylene, amorphous polyalphaolefin and
propylene are the company's major products.

In the UK, the Department of Trade has decided not to oppose plans by
Elf and Shell to bring dry natural gas ashore at Bacton, East Anglia.

BP will receive oil and gas liquids from the offshore fields at
Grangemouth, beginning in 2000.

The company claims that the additional feedstocks are required for its
planned 500,000 tonne/y expansion to ethylene capacity at the site and
its planned production there of polyethylene and polypropylene.

Investment at the site is planned at #500 M, but the expansion projects
still require approval.

Petrochemical producers on Teesside were hoping to secure the new
feedstocks in order to attract new investment to the area.

Elf and Shell have agreed to make a future connection to Teesside after
2000, but the Teesside Chemicals Initiative does not believe this will
result in adequate supplied.

French clean up their act

from CHEMICAL BUSINESS NEWSBASE, 12 Nov 1996

Ref: European Chemical News, 4 Nov 1996, Vol. 66, No. 1739, Pg. 32

In 1995, effluent discharge by the chemical industry in France was 72%
less than that discharged in 1980.

Over the same period, there was a 75% fall in emissions of SOx, a 57%
drop in NOx emissions and a 52% drop in emissions of particulates.

In 1992, 25% of special wastes were sent to landfill, and this fell to
18.7% in 1995.

Environmental protection investments totalled FFR 1.7 bn in 1993, FFR
0.4 bn higher than in 1992.

There has been a drop in the number of fatal accidents to 11 in 1994
compared with 29 in 1981.

Production has risen by 65% between 1980 and 1995.

Monitoring: UK's Environment Agency takes a radical approach

from CHEMICAL BUSINESS NEWSBASE, 12 Nov 1996

Ref: European Chemical News, 4 Nov 1996, Vol. 66, No. 1739, Pg. 32

Proposals are being put forward by the UK Environmental Agency for
Direct Toxicity Assessment (DTA) of effluent streams.

This would monitor the entire effluent for overall toxicity and would
be used in conjunction with current measures for monitoring discharge
of particular chemicals.

Maximum allowable discharge limits are based on the Environmental
Quality Standard (EQS) set for specific chemicals.

However, EQSs have only be established for less than 0.1% of listed
chemicals.

Companies would be required to take remedial action if their waste
stream was shown to be toxic under DTA.

Publication of the final proposals is due in mid 1997.

C5s contain pot of gold: consultant's analysis

from CHEMICAL BUSINESS NEWSBASE, 12 Nov 1996

Ref: European Chemical News, 4 Nov 1996, Vol. 66, No. 1739, Pg. 24,26

High-value added derivatives can be obtained from the C5 hydrocarbon
stream although their production is not always easy.

Details are given of the processes for production of isoprene (2-
methyl-butadiene), cyclopentadiene (usually produced as
dicyclopentadiene, DCPD), piperylene (trans- and cis-1,3- pentadiene)
and 2-methyl-butene-2 (2MB2).

In 1994, combined consumption of these distillates was more than 1 M
tonnes, and this is expected to rise by an average 4.3%/y to more than
1.5 M tonne/y by 2005.

Isoprene rubber is the major end-use for isoprene, global demand for
which was 566,000 tonnes in 1995.

Styrene-isoprene block copolymers (SBCs) offer the greatest potential
increase in demand for isoprene, and by 2005, this could reach 840,000
tonne/y. 10% of isoprene demand is for production of butyl rubber and
this could increase if natural rubber becomes in short supply.

In 1995, demand for DCPD totalled 271,000 tonne/y, of which 50% was
used for production of hydrocarbon resins. 19% was used for production
of unsaturated polyester resins, and 11% for ethylidene norbornene
production.

To 2005, demand for high-purity DCPD for production of cyclic olefin
copolymers is expected to rise.

If production of this and other new DCPD derivatives increases, global
demand for DCPD could be more than 460,000 tonne/y by 2005.

In 1995, piperylene consumption was 134,000 tonnes worldwide, with an
increase to 180,000 tonne/y forecast to 2005.

For 2MB2, demand is forecast to rise from 34,000 tonne/y in 1995 to
41,000 tonne/y in 2005.

In 1995, the effective capacity for isoprene production worldwide was
983,000 tonne/y, with that for DCPD at 322,000 tonne/y and for
piperylene at 147,000 tonne/y. 49% of the world production of isoprene
is from the former Soviet Union.

The major DCPD producers and consumers are Japan and the US.

Pie charts indicate the regional production of isoprene, DCPD and
piperylene in 1995.

SNPE: attentions turn to chemicals

from CHEMICAL BUSINESS NEWSBASE, 12 Nov 1996

Ref: European Chemical News, 4 Nov 1996, Vol. 66, No. 1739, Pg. 21

As military spending is reduced, SNPE has expanded its chemicals
operations and in 1996 they are expected to record sales of FFR 2 bn,
accounting for 45% of the company's turnover.

There was a 16% increase in chemicals sales in 1H 1996 to FFR 991 M,
accounting for 44.9% of the overall turnover in the period.

Over the next five years, SNPE anticipates average growth of 15%/y,
increasing the proportion of sales from the chemical sector to 50-60%
of the total.

The largest chemical sector is intermediates and agrochemicals, with
sales of FFR 1 bn/y in 1996.

Capital investment plans are for FFR 1 bn, mainly for overseas
expansion projects.

The company has based its expansion on its technical expertise in
nitration and phosgenation to produce intermediates for
pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals and plastics.

It has a close relationship with Rhone-Poulenc, and two phosgene
derivatives facilities with a combined capacity of 20-50 tonne/day are
being built in Institute, WV, at a cost of $45 M, as a joint venture
between the two companies.

Production of derivatives such as isocyanates, carbonates,
chloroformates and acid chlorides is due to begin in mid 1998.

Framochem is a 60:40 joint venture between SNPE and Borsodchem in
Hungary.

The company has sales of FFR 70 M/y.

FFR 25 M has been invested to modernise the fine chemicals facilities
at Kazincbarcika, and over the next three years a further FFR 30 M is
to be spent at the facility.

SNPE holds a 30% share of the global market for nitrocellulose, with
sales of FFR 550 M.

It has formed a joint venture in Hong Kong with TNC, Taiwan.

Through China NitroCellulose, SNPE has gained two small nitrocellulose
units in China, at Xin Xiang and Shanghai.

Their combined capacity is 15,000 tonne/y.

Sales of fine chemicals are FFR 450 M/y.

A production facility is being planned in the US, which may be a joint
venture with a pharmaceutical company.

A table gives details, for 1993-1995, of SNPE's sales, pretax income,
net income, capital expenditure and research and development as a
percentage of sales.

A breakdown of sales by division for 1995 is also given.

Ref: European Chemical News, 4 Nov 1996, Vol. 66, No. 1739, Pg. 18

In 3Q 1996, pretax profits reported by Monsanto were $231 M compared
with $203 M in 3Q 1995.

Sales rose from $2.05 bn to $2.17 bn.

There was an increase in pretax income in Jan-Sep 1996 to $795 M
compared with $659 M in the previous year, and sales rose from $6.8 bn
to $7.1 bn.

Sales of agricultural products rose from $464 M to $613 M in 3Q, with
particularly good sales of the herbicide Roundup in Latin America and
Europe.

Operating income for chemicals was $101 M compared with $83 M, but
sales fell from $873 M to $773 M.

The company achieved higher sales of chemical fibres.

Operating income from food ingredients was up $12 M to $55 M on sales
that declined to $293 M.

Sales of pharmaceuticals rose from $435 M to $497 M but income was $13
M lower at $49 M.

Rhone-Poulenc earnings increase as divestment plans progress

from CHEMICAL BUSINESS NEWSBASE, 12 Nov 1996

Ref: European Chemical News, 4 Nov 1996, Vol. 66, No. 1739, Pg. 18

Net earnings by Rhone-Poulenc in 3Q 1996 were 13% higher at FFR 756 M.

Growth would have been 25.1% if the charge of FFR 81 M taken in the
period because of the recall of albumin products by Centeon in Oct.

In 4Q, the company will take a further charge which has not yet been
specified.There was a 4.7% increase in net sales in 3Q to FFR 20.5 bn.

For Jan-Sep, sales rose 1.9% to FFR 63.7 bn, with net profits 10.5%
higher at FFR 2.2 bn.

In 1995, net profits were FFR 2.1 bn and this is expected to be
exceeded in 1996.

There was little change in sales of chemicals in the nine months, but
those of the health sector rose 6.4% and agrochemical sales were 7.5%
higher.

Although volume sales of fibres and polymers rose, turnover was down
8.2% and operating profits fell 65.3%.

This poor sectorial performance contributed to the disappointing
operating profits which rose only 9.6% in the nine months to FFR 6.4
bn.

By the end of 1997, the company plans to divest non-strategic assets
worth FFR 10 bn.

To Sep 1996, such divestments have totalled FFR 6 bn.

By the end of 1996, this could increase to FFR 7-9 bn.

Michelin seals Taurus buyout

from CHEMICAL BUSINESS NEWSBASE, 12 Nov 1996

Ref: European Rubber Journal, Nov 1996, Vol. 178, No. 10, Pg. 3

The purchase of a 90% stake in Taurus Rubber Co of Hungary by Groupe
Michelin has been completed.

The other 10% is held by Taurus employees.

The price was the equivalent of $66 M in cash and debt assumption, and
Michelin has agreed to invest a further $60 M in updating production
facilities.

Taurus was previously state-owned.

In a separate deal, Michelin then sold Taurus' non-tyre activities to
the German company Phoenix AG.

These businesses have a turnover of more than $32.5 M, and employ 1085.

Turnover is expected to rise by 20% in 1996.

They are known as Taurus Emerge Rubber Industrial Ltd, which makes
conveyer belts and industrial hoses, and Taurus Palma Ltd (expansion
joints, bellows, etc.).

Michelin is thus left with a truck tyre plant in Budapest and an
agricultural tyres plant in Nyireghyhaza, plus minor trading operations
that include a rubber goods company, a calendering company, a carbon
black distributor, a rubber processing equipment company, a joint
venture company making hose, belt and patch materials, and joint
venture company making dipped latex products in Vietnam.

Taurus made sales of $148 M in 1995, of which 71% was tyre-related.

The profit was $4.4 M.

Its truck tyres have a good presence in E Europe, and its agricultural
tyres are known throughout Europe.

Isophthalic acid: Amoco ups PIA capacity at Illinois facility

from CHEMICAL BUSINESS NEWSBASE, 12 Nov 1996

Ref: European Chemical News, 4 Nov 1996, Vol. 66, No. 1739, Pg. 38

By 1Q 1998, capacity for production of isophthalic acid (PIA) is due to
be increased by 107,000 tonne/y to 200,000 tonne/y at Amoco Chemical's
facility in Joliet, IL.

The engineering, procurement and construction contract has been awarded
to Jacobs Constructors.

At Geel, Amoco Chemical operates a 125,000 tonne/y PIA unit.

AGIC, a joint venture between Amoco Chemical and Mitsubishi Gas
Chemical, is expanding PIA capacity in Japan by 15,000 tonne/y to
50,000 tonne/y.

These facilities make Amoco Chemical the world's biggest PIA producer.

In mid 1998, a 68,000 tonne/y PIA unit is due to be brought onstream in
the US by Eastman Chemical.

The company is understood to have secured long-term supplies of the PIA
feedstock, meta-xylene, which is generally in short supply.

An ethylene cracker with a capacity of 800,000 tonne/y is being
considered by Mobil, together with the doubling of its aromatics
capacity.

A study is being undertaken by Exxon for production of ethylene,
polyethylene, polypropylene and lubricant basestocks.

Esso has a refinery at Pulau Ayer Chawan, with which the project would
be integrated.

The feasibility study is to be completed by 2Q 1997.

The possibility of taking a minor stake in these petrochemical
complexes is being considered by Sabic.

Recently, Caltex has begun to consider production of para-xylene and
other aromatics in Singapore.

Within two years, a 2000 tonne/y facility is planned by Bayer for
production of polyaspartic acids using its new technology.

A 300 tonne/y laboratory scale unit has been built at Leverkusen, where
the new unit is also expected to be based.

Eventually, the company plans to build a 25,000-30,000 tonne/y
commercial facility.

Bayer's process involves the reaction of maleic anhydride and ammonia.

New technology, based on the polymerisation of aspartic acid, is being
jointly developed by Donlar, and Rohm and Haas.

Polyaspartic acids are used as sequestering and dispersing agents in
slurries and aqueous dispersions, and can prevent deposits building up
in boilers and cooling circuits.

Detergents used in extraction of petroleum can be softened and
dispersed using polyaspartic acids.

Original text in PORTUGUESE

The Brazilian PET Packaging Makers Association (Abepet) proposes to
raise $1M from its members to fund a franchising business for the
collection and recycling of PET bottles.

The franchisers, investing from $2000-50,000, would organize by boys,
with backyard crushing and packing.

The market pays $300-400 /tonne.

The purchasers will clean, separate and grind up the bottles.

There are uses for the polyester in carpets, fibre and brushes.

Rhodia-Ster has a process for a heat insulator made from recycled PET
used with asphalt.

The use of recycled PET for food packaging is not permitted, so the
bottles cannot be reused, though it is possible to mix the used resin
with new resin in the co-injection process.

Of Brazil's present consumption of 200,000 tones/y of PET, 15% is
recycled material.

The PET market is worth $1 bn, including $500 M for 2 bn bottles/y.

Original text in PORTUGUESE

The rapidly growing demand for PET for bottles in Brazil has lead to a
race to build and open a world scale PTA plant, of 350,000-500,000
tonnes/y.

The Odebrecht group company OPP has entered into a partnership,
Proppet, with the Mariani group company Nitrocarbono to build a plant
next to Petrobras' Replan refinery in Sao Paulo.

On 17 Oct 1996 Odebrecht, Mariani, Ultra and Itausa will sign a
contract with the Governor of Sao Paulo state for investment in the Sao
Paulo gas-chemical complex.

Odebrecht plans to take the paraxylene raw material for PTA from the
present mixture of xylene produced by Replan, even before the pyrolysis
plant for the Paulinia raw material centre is built.

Rhodia-Ster is to expands its present 130,000 tonnes/y PTA plant to

Biological herbicides: fact or fantasy?

from CHEMICAL BUSINESS NEWSBASE, 12 Nov 1996

Ref: Focus on Biopesticides PLUS, Oct 1996, Pg. 1-2

Following the discovery and marketing of the first microbial
herbicides, Collego and Devine, in the USA in the early 1980s, there
was a massive upsurge of research in this area.

By 1989 more than 100 fungal pathogens were being studied as potential
microbial herbicides for control of 69 weed species.

Of these, 19 were considered to have good practical potential.

However, those products on the market in the USA were withdrawn for
commercial reasons (though Devine is now available again) and those
thought to be close to market have disappeared.

Many reasaons have been offered to explain the failure to translate
good microbial herbicide potential identified in laboratory experiments
to practical success in the field.

One possible reason for the failure to make biological weed control
agents work in the field is that virtually all the laboratory trials
use some form of atomiser to apply suspensions of infective propagules
to the target weed.

The spray is applied at an application volume of 1000-3000 l/ha.

Field experiments apply at not more than 500-600 l/ha in a spray
droplet spectrum consisting of droplet sizes ranging from just a few
microns to more than 500 microns in diameter.

Inevitably, there will be a reduction in the inoculum retained on the
target and changes in its distribution.

It is no surprise that field applications have been unreliable and
commercial development constrained.

The answer is that research teams should include expertise in
formulation and spray applications as well as weed and pathogen biology.

36% profit rise forecast at AgrEvo

from CHEMICAL BUSINESS NEWSBASE, 12 Nov 1996

Ref: Farmers Weekly, Nov 1996, Vol. 125, No. 18, Pg. 25

AgrEvo is forecast to record an operating profit of #87 M in 1996, up
36%, thanks to improved sales of agrochemicals.

Worldwide sales are expected to reach #1.63 bn for the full year, up
11% on 1995.

Stronger sales have been recorded in North and South America, India,
Korea, Australia, and Pakistan.

European sales represent 45% of the total.

Investment in research and development will total #174 M in 1996,
representing 11% of turnover.

AgrEvo's research and development budget is expected to increase
rapidly because of investment in biotechnology.

About 6% of research expenditure was destined for biotechnology before
the company acquired the Dutch/Belgian biotechnology company, Plant
Genetic Systems International.

During 1996-2001 this investment is expected to increase to 25%.

By 2005 AgrEvo expects that plant and biotechnology products and
techniques will generate additional sales in excess of DM 1 bn/y.

Principal contributions to revenue will arise from sales of Liberty
Link varieties of oilseed rape. maize, sugar beet, cotton, and soya
beans which are resistant to glufosinate-ammonium.

Efficiency improving measures should reduce AgrEvo's costs by #130 M
before 1999.

Since AgrEvo was established on 1 Jan 1994 its number of employees has
been reduced by about 1300, research and marketing operations
centralised, and the number of production and formulating facilities
reduced from 39 to 26.

Call to investigate OP link in UK

The European Commission has been asked by a Euro-MP to investigate
alleged links between the use of organophoshate (OP) pesticides and
BSE.

A UK farmer has developed a theory that the real cause of BSE is in OP
poisoning, principally through the use of the agrochemical Phosmet to
control warble fly.

The UK government has dismissed the theory.

Part of the evidence lies in the fact that other European countries
which have not used OPs as much as the UK have not experienced the

The restructuring in the central European tyre industry is now largely
complete, with only a few indigenous tyre plants left to be bought by
the majors.

These include Sava Kranj of Slovenia and Matador Puchov of Slovakia.

The business of each of these is reviewed.

Producers in the former Yugoslavia are emerging from a 3-year trade
boycott.

Michelin is the most active of the majors in the E European market.

Within the last year it has established a strong base for low cost
production of truck, tyre and agricultural tyres, which it will ship
back to W Europe or supply to eastern markets as opportunities arise.

Western companies have so far made no inroads into the industry in
Romania, Bulgaria or the Ukraine.

The best near-term growth potential is seen in the Czech and Slovak
Republics, the Ukraine, Byelorus and the Baltic states.

Russia and the other former soviet republics will take longer.

A table shows E Europe's top tyre makers by turnover.

The leader is Barum Continental of the Czech Republic, followed by

1H 1996 saw price discounting in the US tyre market, but prices should
be stable in 2H.

Demand is flat and the market is extremely competitive, because a fall
in demand at the original equipment level has left producers with
excess inventories.

For the year as a whole, some companies may see an increase in unit
sales but there will be little increase in sales values or in overall
shipment volumes.

In passenger tyres, shipments of replacement tyres will rise 3% to 172
M units, but this will be offset by a 3.5% fall in OE shipments to 55 M
units.

Tables show 1995 sales and market share in N America and Latin America
for the leading tyre companies.

The US leader is Goodyear/KS with 27.8% of the market, followed by

1996, Pg. 14

After a record year in 1995 when demand exceeded supply, the European
tyre industry is now back to its normal state of overcapacity and
falling prices.

Demand is tepid and inventories high, so production is being cut back.

The top 6 companies saw sales growth of 8-31% in 1995, but growth for
smaller companies was around 1%.

The top three tyre companies in terms of European sales are Michelin at
$6.76 bn, Continental Group at $3.670 bn, and Goodyear at $2.850 bn.

Goodyear has ambitious plans to overtake Continental.

A table shows European sales in 1995 for the top 21 companies.

The performances of the major tyre companies in Europe are briefly
discussed.

In 1995 the European market for replacement tyres grew 3.1% to 128.3 M
units. 60% of this was in the form of S/T rated summer tyres, with
H-rated summer tyres at 16% and V/W/Z-rated high performance tyres at
10%.

European shipments of medium and heavy truck tyres in 1995 were up 9.2%
to 11.9 M units.

There was a 3.3% rise in shipments of original equipment car tyres to
62.3 M units.

PT Gadjah Tunggal (GT) claims to be the largest integrated tyre
manufacturer in SE Asia.

It is near the end of a 3-year investment programme worth $385 M that
will raise capacity at its Tangerang complex near Jakarta to almost
38,000 units/day.

It had 1995 sales of almost $330 M from radial car tyres, cross-ply
light and heavy truck and motorcycle tyres, and nylon yarn and cord.

It has announced a doubling of nylon tyre cord yarn capacity from the
current 24,000 tonnes/y, and has obtained a licence to become the first
Indonesian producer of SBR.

It uses 225 tonnes/day of rubber at the complex, which also makes
tubes, belts and shoe soles.

It is now looking for an alliance with a tyre major, as well as
discussing ventures with other companies its own size.

By 2000 it will have capacity for 20 M units/y, which will include new
capacity for steel radial truck tyres and a new unit at Anhui for up to
10 M units/y of radial car tyres.

It has a market share in Indonesia of about 33%. 38% of output is
exported, reaching 70 countries.

Its yarn subsidiary Filamendo is spending $140 M on doubling nylon yarn
capacity to 48,000 and expanding into nylon 66 and polyester.

The yarn is made into cord by another subsidiary, Andayani Megah, which
has an output of 18,000 tonnes/y and licenses technology from Goodyear.

It is planning a $75 M joint venture with the Malaysian company Hicom
to produce nylon, rayon and polyester cord in Malaysia.

GT sees a captive source of SBR as a high priority, and has licensed
technology from Nippon Zeon Ltd.

It will start up a 60,000 tonnes/y emulsion SBR unit at Merak in W Java
in 1Q 1998.

1996, Pg. 8

The Japanese tyre industry is entering a mini-boom fuelled by increased
sales, successful cost cutting, investment in overseas capacity and the
fact that the weaker Yen has made exports profitable once more.

Plants are operating flat out.

Production for the first 5 months 1996 was up 3.9% on the same period
1995, and production for the full year could exceed the record 1.04 M
tonnes of new rubber used in 1995.

All Japanese tyre producers are now in profit.

Many are investing elsewhere in Asia to cut costs and take advantage of
growing markets.

A table shows all the major Asian tyre producers together with their
regional sales and their share of the Asian market.

The leading company is Bridgestone, with a market share of 29% and 1995
sales in Asia of $6.370 bn.

According to Vredestein Rubber Recycling BV, recycling is the best way
both economically and ecologically to deal with both production and
post-consumer rubber scrap.

The article discusses the technical, regulatory and economic issues
relating to dealing with rubber waste, and examines the options
available.

Vredestein has developed Surcrum, a surface-activated crumb rubber made
from rubber waste.

Surface activation doubles mechanical stability compared with untreated
crumb and makes the material more suitable for use in compounding.

The process can be used with a wide range of polymers.

Surcrum made from NR and SBR has already been commercialized, and
development of NBR and EPDM grades is underway.

The technical specifications and advantages of Surcrum are reviewed.

It can be cured either in a continuous process or by compression
moulding.

Piltec Chemical (UK) Ltd has gained a SMART award from the UK
government to help develop its Temprene S thermoplastic elastomer
compound for use in the automotive industry.

Temprene S is made from saturated and unsaturated nitrile rubbers and
PVC.

It is very light, and has good compression set, tear and tensile
strength and good ozone resistance.

It is recyclable and has very good flocking properties.

The existing Temprene range has the elastomeric properties of cured
rubber and the processing advantages of a thermoplastic.

Temprene is currently made under licence by Compound Technologies Inc
in the US and Piltec Chemicals Italia in Italy.

Piltec would like to license the new grade to a UK producer, possibly

AES launches new dry Santoprene

from CHEMICAL BUSINESS NEWSBASE, 12 Nov 1996

Ref: European Rubber Journal, Nov 1996, Vol. 178, No. 10, Pg. 33

Santoprene 800 is a new range of thermoplastic elastomers from Advanced
Elastomer Systems (AES).

The company says it is already in use in various applications and sees
it as an important expansion of its product line.

It is based on a new proprietary vulcanization technology and is said
to be the first non-hygroscopic TPE.

As well as offering the standard Santoprene properties it has a number
of unique features.

Because it does not attract moisture it does not need to be dried,
which saves processing costs.

It will be particularly useful in Asia and other hot, humid climates
where drying equipment is not always available.

It also has good colouring properties and a very white base colour
which means that pale colours can be introduced easily.

This opens up new applications in which pale colours are important.

It also has very high purity and low residual halogen content.

It is initially available in 12 grades: four general purpose, five high
flow and three FDA-compliant.

Recyclability drives TPE profiles

from CHEMICAL BUSINESS NEWSBASE, 12 Nov 1996

Ref: European Rubber Journal, Nov 1996, Vol. 178, No. 10, Pg. 33-34

Producers of thermoplastic elastomers (TPEs) are confident that TPEs
will overtake EPDM as the material of choice for automotive profiles, a
market of about 500,000 tonnes/y.

How long this will take is not certain.

The major advantage of TPEs is their recyclability, though the
separation of parts is still a major hurdle for many components.

The European market for thermoplastic vulcanisates is currently
20,000-24,000 tonnes/y, and this would be greatly increased if TPVs
were used in automotive weatherstripping.

Each vehicle has an average of 12kg of rubber weatherstripping, adding
up to a market of over 150,000 tonnes/y in Europe and 441,000 tonnes/y
worldwide.

However, the switch away from EPDM would involve major machinery costs
for rubber processors.

A second advantage of TPEs over EPDM is better tear resistance.

EPDM seals are failing under warranty and causing problems for car
manufacturers.

General Motors is reported to be replacing EPDM trim with alternative
materials within the next 5 years.

Japanese car makers are pioneering the use of new materials.

Foamed grades of TPEs will be very important.

The use of scrap tyres as fuel in cement kilns is less widespread in
the UK than in the rest of Europe and N America.

However, Blue Circle Cement has set up a trial project at its
Northfleet Works in Kent.

Energy represents about one-third of its production costs, and the use
of tyres will save it money.

The trials are going successfully.

The tyres are combusted at 1100 C, at which temperature they do not
produce an increase in emissions from the kiln.

If an application for the permanent use of tyres were successful, the
problem of tyre disposal in the Kent area would be substantially
reduced.

Tyre recycling: pressure lower as industry acts

from CHEMICAL BUSINESS NEWSBASE, 12 Nov 1996

Ref: European Rubber Journal, Nov 1996, Vol. 178, No. 10, Pg. 26,28,30

The political pressure surrounding the issue of scrap tyres in the
European Union is much lower in late 1996 than it was a year earlier.

The European Commission is discussing waste issues in general and no
proposals have yet been forthcoming.

In the mean time, impending legislation and market forces have
stimulated the industry to begin setting up its own programmes.

It is not certain whether the EU will tackle the issue with a directive
or with recommendations.

In the UK, the buoyant retreading market coupled with numerous
pyrolysis, tyres-for-energy and tyres as cement kiln fuel projects,
should increase recovery further in the medium term.

However, it is not known if energy recovery will be seen as an
acceptable form of recycling by the EU.

Various approaches to recycling are discussed, with the emphasis on the
UK.

A table shows the amount of scrap tyre waste produced in each European
country; for the UK the figure is 350,000-400,000 tonnes/y.

Sweden's tyre recycling scheme is briefly reviewed.

JK Industries prepares for boom

from CHEMICAL BUSINESS NEWSBASE, 12 Nov 1996

Ref: European Rubber Journal, Nov 1996, Vol. 178, No. 10, Pg. 25

The Indian tyre market is poised for an explosion in demand, according
to analysts. $7 bn will be invested in new capacity for 3.5 M vehicles
by 2000, leading to an output of 8 M vehicles/y.

JK Industries Ltd says it is the only domestic tyre maker to supply all
the Indian vehicle makers.

Its objectives are to become one of the top 3 Indian tyre producers by
1998, to become a major producer of cross-ply tyres for the world
market, and to improve quality and customer service.

It is currently India's 5th largest producer at over 7900 units/day.

Its sales for 1995-96 were $325 M, 90% of which came from tyres.

It currently exports 10% of its output.

It recently paid $71 M to Vikrant Tyres Ltd for a production plant in
the south of India at Mysore.

It is also in negotiations with Continental AG of Germany over a joint
venture.

Indspec plans European resorcinol plant

from CHEMICAL BUSINESS NEWSBASE, 12 Nov 1996

Ref: European Rubber Journal, Nov 1996, Vol. 178, No. 10, Pg. 21

Indspec Chemical Corp of the US is evaluating three possible sites for
a 9000 tonnes/y resorcinol plant in W Europe.

The project will cost $50 M and is due for startup by early 1999.

Resorcinol is made from benzene and is used to bond rubber and cord in
tyre production.

Indspec predicts continuing healthy growth in resorcinol markets,
including new applications.

The new plant will use a new hydroperoxidation process based on benzene
and propylene and producing acetone as a by-product.

European customers are currently supplied from its US plant, the
company's only resorcinol unit, that has recently been expanded by 18%
to 23,500 tonnes/y.

Indspec says it is the world's leading resorcinol supplier, and is
actively developing new applications.

Currently about half of all consumption is used in the tyre industry.

Rubber chemicals shortage looming

from CHEMICAL BUSINESS NEWSBASE, 12 Nov 1996

Ref: European Rubber Journal, Nov 1996, Vol. 178, No. 10, Pg. 21

According to Bayer AG, the rubber industry will face a supply crisis
for processing chemicals in the next 2-3 years unless prices for the
chemicals recover to reasonable levels.

Prices are only 60-70% of the level of the late 1980s, and it is
questionable whether re-investment can be justified.

Yet up to 200,000 tonnes of new capacity will be needed worldwide
within the next 10 years, equivalent to one new plant each year.

The total necessary investment is around $667 M.

These figures are based on 3%/y demand growth and the need to phase out
older, uneconomic plants.

If supplies become short, prices would fluctuate wildly, which would be
bad for both suppliers and customers.

Bayer says it is not prepared to shoulder supply responsibilities
alone, although it is in the strongest position to weather the crisis
because its rubber business is back-integrated into rubber chemicals.

It is currently looking for rubber chemical production partners in
India and China, and is prepared to spend over $200 M on these
projects.

Bayer says the pricing problem is not just about allowing new
investment, but about producers staying in the industry at all.

Continental AG is reportedly in discussions with Daewoo Corp and
Vietnam Chemical Corp over a joint venture to produce up to 5.5 M
tyres/y at Daewoo's proposed industrial complex outside Hanoi.

Continental has not confirmed or denied the reports.

It would be its third project in Asia within the last year: it has
recently set up joint ventures in India and Indonesia.

Yokohama Rubber Co Ltd of Japan is preparing to set up a production
base in Vietnam to supply Asia and Europe.

A feasibility study is being carried out with Mitsubishi for a $60 M
plant near Ho Chi Minh City for a plant with capacity for 450,000
units/y of car and light truck tyres and 1 M units/y for two-wheeler
tyres.

Vietnam already has five vehicle assembly joint ventures, and up to
nine more are being discussed.

In 1994 it produced 900,000 cars and 4.4 M commercial vehicles.

Three compounding projects for MERL

from CHEMICAL BUSINESS NEWSBASE, 12 Nov 1996

Ref: European Rubber Journal, Nov 1996, Vol. 178, No. 10, Pg. 20

Materials Engineering Research Laboratory Ltd (MERL) of the UK has
launched R&D projects in three areas of advanced rubber compounding.

These are processable low temperature cure compounds; high fatigue
resistant compounds, and mathematical models of rubber compounding.

Each project will last 3 years, and participants will pay about
$15,000/y.

They will start in 1997.

The processable low temperature cure compounds will be based on an
existing set of compounds that show rapid curing at around 70 C, are
easy to process and have good performance characteristics.

The high fatigue resistance project will involve a search for compounds
based on elastomer blends and various particulate fillers, and will aim
to produce compounds that can withstand repeated flexing in harsh
environmental conditions.

Pirelli tyre earnings improve

from CHEMICAL BUSINESS NEWSBASE, 12 Nov 1996

Ref: European Rubber Journal, Nov 1996, Vol. 178, No. 10, Pg. 17

Sales revenue for Pirelli Tyre Holding NV rose 8.9% to HFL 2.903 bn
($1738.7 bn) in 1H 1996.

Operating profit was up 46.7% at HFL 197.4 M, and net group result was
up 418% to HFL 55.4 M.

HFL 83.5 M was allocated in extraordinary charges, primarily to cover
restructuring in N America.

The results reflect ongoing efficiency measures and a renewal of the
product range.

The earnings/sales ratio rose to 6.8%, a step towards the goal of
raising profitability high enough to provide a satisfactory return on
investment.

Factors contributing to the turnover rise were improved sales of
performance tyres to car producers, consolidation of market share in
premium replacement tyres, a significant sales increase for motorcycle
tyres and satisfactory sales of truck and agricultural tyres.

The finances of Pirelli Armstrong Tire in the US improved, but the
plant at Nashville, TN, will still be closed in early 1997.

The company believes that a turnaround in its N American business can
only be achieved by concentrating on the high-margin Pirelli brand,
premium tyres and light truck tyres, all produced at the plant at
Hanford, CA.

Ref: European Rubber Journal, Nov 1996, Vol. 178, No. 10, Pg. 16

Hoechst AG plans to set up a 50/50 joint venture with Sabanci Holding
of Turkey for the production of high modulus/low shrinkage polyester
tyre cord yarn and fabric.

The DM 145 M ($97 M) venture will become operational in 1999, and will
carry out production at Sabanci's tyre production complex near Izmit.

It will have capacity for 14,000 tonnes/y each of Trevira polyester
yarn and complete cord and fabric processing.

About 80% of output will be exported, mostly to W Europe.

Hoechst Trevira says more and more tyre companies are outsourcing tyre
cord production, and it is increasing its forward integration in this
area.

It expects polyester to overtake rayon as the main tyre cord material
in W Europe in 1998, and expects the region's demand for polyester cord
to double to over 50,000 tonnes/y within 6 years.

It currently has a small production plant in Germany and imports cord
made in the US and Mexico.

In the last year it has spent $170 M on new tyre cord capacity,
including setting up a joint venture in India with Reliance Industries.

It expects sales growth of 25% for tyre cord in 1996 due to new
capacity coming on stream; sales are currently over $200 M/y.

It says the world market for high modulus, low shrinkage polyester yarn
for tyre cord is growing at 10%/y and will reach almost 300,000
tonnes/y by 2000.

Two Spanish directors of the Solvay plant near Barcelona have been
fined PTS 1 M and sentenced to house arrest for one month for
discharging excessive amounts of chloride from their PVC plant into the
River Llobregat, which flows into the Mediterranean Sea.

The sentence passed by the judge heavily criticised the local water
authorities for authorising Solvay to emit chloride which was found to
be 15 times over the legal limit.

Solvay has appealed the decision.

Two additional court cases against the same Solvay directors are

Greenpeace prosecutes Tarkett over PVC production

from CHEMICAL BUSINESS NEWSBASE, 12 Nov 1996

Ref: Greenpeace Business, Oct-Nov 1996, No. 33, Pg. 5

Three years ago, Tarkett, the world's second largest manufacturer of
PVC floorings, announced a gradual phaseout of PVC as a raw material in
its products.

In Oct 1993, Tarkett was sold to a German company which is less
committed to phasing out PVC.

Although the company has recently launched a new range of PVC-free
flooring, factory managers admit that they have no concrete plans to
phase out PVC.

They are, instead, actively expanding their PVC products into South
Africa, eastern Europe and the Middle East, where PVC disposal methods
are lax.

In Sweden, Tarkett sells 60% of all PVC floors.

As the single largest user of PVC, it is also the biggest DEHP
polluter.

It is estimated that there is a leaching of DEHP from PVC floors into
the environment of 30-60 tonne/y.

DEHP has been identified as a hormone disruptor which can affect the
health and development of infants at extremely low levels.

In Aug 1996, a fire at the municipal dump in Ronneby, Sweden (where the
Tarkett plant is located) broke out when hot PVC waste was dumped from
the plant.

Greenpeace demanded dioxin tests and widespread publicity ensued.

In addition to carrying out direct actions at the plant, Greenpeace has
also filed a case against Tarkett for breaking the rule of
substitution.

The suit is based on a Swedish law which states that anyone using a
hazardous substance has to substitute this with a less hazardous
substance if there is one on the market.

Greenpeace is demanding a PVC phaseout plan from Tarkett and is
contacting outlets which sell Tarkett floorings asking them to sell
alternative PVC flooring.

Anti-dumping investigation into insecticides from Chile

Pg. 13

Original text in PORTUGUESE

The Brazilian government is considering anti-dumping measures against
imports of magnesium phosphate based insecticides from Chile.

There is only one Brazilian company making such insecticides, which are
used to protect agricultural produce in store: Casa Bernardo Ltda.

But the Ministry argues that the normal cost of the insecticide is
$303.30 /kg, while imports from Chile are reaching Brazil at $9.87 /kg.

Sales by the Brazilian maker have fallen from 100% of the market in
1992 to 80% in Jun 1996, and the growth rate fell from 54% in 1994 to
5% in 1995.

Imports grew 132% in 1994.

The price in Brazil fell 4% in 1995.

The farming industry is concerned that the government intervention will
force up prices and costs.

Change in subsidy will increase fuel alcohol prices

from CHEMICAL BUSINESS NEWSBASE, 12 Nov 1996

Ref: Gazeta Mercantil, 14 Oct 1996, No. 20.940, Pg. A-1,A-4

Original text in PORTUGUESE

The subsidy on fuel alcohol encumbers Petrobras with an average loss of
Reals 80 M/mo, and from Jan 1996 it wishes it to fall entirely on the
consumer.

A study before the government also proposes the freeing of anhydrous
alcohol, with a consequent increase in the price of hydrated alcohol.

The Finance Ministry wishes to bring in the price increases more
gradually because of their inflationary effect, and the Ministry of
Trade, Industry and Commerce considers that cutting the subsidy will
have a serious effect on producers.

The end of the subsidy in 1997 would give an average price increase of
5-7%.

Petrobras would save Reals 40 M/mo from cutting out the subsidy and
Reals 40 M/mo from the resultant lower administrative costs.

The proposals also envisage the end of the subsidy on hydrated alcohol,
for which demand is falling because there are fewer alcohol fuelled
cars.

The subsidy would be maintained to assist producers in North-East
Brazil.

It would be Reals 10/cubic metre, the difference between the general
subsidy and the increased subsidy now paid in the NE.

The strategy of the Odebrecht group

Ref: Gazeta Mercantil, 11 Oct 1996, No. 20.939, Pg. Relatorio 4

Original text in PORTUGUESE

Since 1990 the Odebrecht group has taken advantage of the privatization
of the petrochemical sector and the reduction of the shareholding of
Petroquisa (Petrobras) to 15% in the sector, to add businesses in this
filed, amounting to Reals 1.78 bn in 1995, to its traditional
activities of construction (about Reals 3.5 bn) and engineering
services (Reals 1.935 bn).

In 1990 it had shares in Salgema, Cia Petroquimica de Camacari, and a
38% share in Unipar.

It is now in a position to integrate the chlorine and PVC activities of
Salgema and CPC into Trikem at Bahia, and owns Poliolefinas in Sao
Paulo.

It controls the centre at Triunfo, which it administers with Ipiranga.

In Bahia, Trikem and Poliolefinas give Odebrecht an important share in
the capital of Norquisa, even before Conepar's share's are sold.

While it has 38.78% of the capital of Unipar, Unipar in its turn has
31.47% of the capital of Poliolefinas, so that Odebrecht cannot unite
all its operations within OPP.

Disagreements with Unipar over Unipar's PQU in Sao Paulo, which
supplies all the ethylene for Odebrecht's PE production, have led
Odebrecht to undertake investment in the second Sao Paulo petrochemical
complex.

It is also to take part in a $250 M PET project with the Mariani group,
using both DMT and PTA as raw materials, and in a $300 M propylene
project with Elekeiroz within the second Sao Paulo complex near the
Replan refinery.

Its total investment up to 2000 will be $1 bn, and its 1995 output was
1.189 M tonnes of plastic resins.

CBE produces its styrene at a 120,000 tonnes/y plant at Cubatao (Sao
Paulo).

This will be sufficient to supply its PS expansion, but the new PS
plant will take all its output.

At present the whole operation brings sales of $102 M, with $58 M
coming from Sao Jose and $44 M from Cubatao.

The expansion project will raise Sao Jose's sales to $116 M, but reduce
those from Cubatao to $14 M, because of the ending of sales on the
external market.

Brazil at present produces 215,000 tonnes/y of PS; 140,00 from EDN and
50,000 tonnes from CBE.

Proquigel produces 25,000 tonnes/y and 46,000 tonnes/y is imported,
mostly for the domestic electrical production at Manaus.

Rhodia-Ster increases output of non-woven fabric

from CHEMICAL BUSINESS NEWSBASE, 12 Nov 1996

Ref: Gazeta Mercantil, 11 Oct 1996, No. 20.939, Pg. Relatorio 2

Original text in PORTUGUESE

Rhodia-Ster is to invest $10-12 M/y up to 1999 to increase production
of its Bidim 100% polyester non-woven, spun-bonded fabric.

It will increase production to 85,000 sq metres/y.

In 1996 Reals 10 M was spent on increasing output from 32 M sq metres/y
to 55 M sq metres/y.

It is used in the car industry for insulation and in the shoe industry,
which takes 45% of output, as a base for synthetic leather, as well as
in soil conservation.

Exports will rise from 20% in 1996 to 25% in 1997. 35% of output is
used in civil engineering for soil reinforcement, water barriers etc,
and further 20% as a thermal and acoustic insulator in domestic
electrical goods.

The plant at Sao Jose dos Campos has sales of $25 M/y.

Rhodia has developed special varieties of this fabric, for example for
asphalted waterproofing sheet for water channels, and for shoe use. 10%
of recycled material is used, which is derived from plastic bottles.
$800,000 has been invested in 1996 in providing a finished product.

The Sao Jose dos Campos plant also produces Crykor acrylic non-woven
fabric, making 17,000 tonnes/y.

The plant has 242 employees.

Recent investment has been $8 M, to increase produciton, and a further
$6 M is planned, to add 4000 tonnes/y to output.

Investments in Camacari will reach Reals 500 M

from CHEMICAL BUSINESS NEWSBASE, 12 Nov 1996

Ref: Gazeta Mercantil, 11 Oct 1996, No. 20.939, Pg. Relatorio 1

Original text in PORTUGUESE

Reals 500 M is to be invested in the Camacari petrochemical complex in
1997 and 1998.

The raw materials centre, Copene, which has already increased capacity,
will invest Reals 125 M in increasing ethylene capacity by 100,000
tonnes/y, as well as increasing paraxylene production from 79,000
tonnes/y by a further 200,000 tonnes/y, by Aug 1997.

This will make possible the Reals 240 M PET project by Proppet, an
Odebrecht (49% through OPP) and Mariani group joint venture, which will
start operation in 1998.

Proppet will also take over the intermediate dimethyl terephthalate
production of Mariani's Nitrocarbono.

Odebrecht also has plans to produce PET in Rio Grande do Sul, using
PTA, but these are on hold in case the market is oversupplied.

Camacari's additional ethylene production is already committed to
ethylene oxide production by the Ultra group company Oxiteno, which
will be increased from 130,000 tonnes/y to 235,000 tonnes/y.

Oxiteno will use all this output itself to make glycol ethers, the raw
material for polyester fibre.

The new plant will open in Apr 1997, when Copene's extra ethylene is
available.

Deten Quimica will also increase its output of linear alkylbenzene, the
raw material for biodegradable detergents, from 50,000 tonnes/y to
180,000 tonnes/y, investing Reals 25 M between 1996 and 1999.

Copene is also to increase its propylene output, and Polialden
Petroquimica, controlled by Conepar, is to invest Reals 100 M in a PP
plant at Camacari.

New petrochemical complex in Paulinia will be agreed in Oct 1996

from CHEMICAL BUSINESS NEWSBASE, 12 Nov 1996

Ref: Gazeta Mercantil, 11 Oct 1996, No. 20.939, Pg. Relatorio 1-2

Original text in PORTUGUESE

The contract for Sao Paulo's second petrochemical complex, in Paulinia,
is to be signed on 17 Oct 1996.

In the first phase OPP and Elekeiroz, the chemical branch of the Itausa
group, will invest $20 M in separating propylene from the output of the
nearby Replan refinery.

In the same phase, OPP will build a 150,000-160,000 tonnes/y PP plant,
costing $110,000.

Elekeiroz will invest $125 M in producing butanol and octanol, used for
paint and plastifiers.

The two companies will cooperate in a $125 investment in a 60,000
tonnes/y plant to make acrylic acid and acrylates.

In the second stage, a raw materials centre will be built in
cooperation with other companies, including Petrobras, using Replan's
paraxylene to make PTA.

This unit may possibly be built before the raw materials centre.

Interest has been shown by Oxiteno, which would like to produce
ethylene oxide.

The South-East and Centre-West regions of Brazil which this centre will
serve, contains 65% of Brazil's market for petrochemicals.

The impetus for the development is the inability of PQU, Sao Paulo's
existing petrochemical raw materials centre, to satisfy the demand, in
spite of its increase in capacity in 1996.

Raw material supply the main challenge for the Brazilian petrochemical
industry

from CHEMICAL BUSINESS NEWSBASE, 12 Nov 1996

Ref: Gazeta Mercantil, 11 Oct 1996, No. 20.939, Pg. Relatorio 1;3

Original text in PORTUGUESE

The most urgent problem for the petrochemical industry in Brazil is not
competitiveness in the international market but that of obtaining
supplies.

Most multinationals are either linked to major refineries, refine their
own naphtha or can buy on the open market.

Brazil's petrochemical industry derives from a state decision to obtain
maximum value for its petroleum monopoly, and the state holding company
Petroquisa was responsible for chemical raw materials.

Following the liberalization of the petroleum market the petrochemical
companies are negotiating arrangements with Petrobras to guarantee
their supplies.

They are also seeking the dissolution of Conepar, the chemical arm of
the former Economico group, which controls Norquisa and through it
Copene, Brazil's largest petrochemical complex, in Bahia.

Copene is 2000 km from Brazil's largest market in Sao Paulo and depends
in the agreement of its shareholders to ensure its market role.

Some, such as Odebrecht, Mariani, Suzano and Ultra are already involved
in the Rio de Janeiro gas-chemical complex project or the proposed
Paulinia complex, next to Petrobras' Replan refinery.

The petrochemical industry had a $6 bn investment programme up to the
end of the century, and since 1995 almost 40% of this has already been
spent.

The industry also needs to increase exports above its present 20%.

It is very dependent on imported technology from major multinationals
and in 1994 spent only 0.77% of sales on R&D.

Multinationals are in fact ready to become involved in the growing
Brazilian and Mercosul markets, and the high price Dow paid for the
Bahia Blanca refinery and for Indupa is a sign of this.

Lubricants sector becomes more specialized

from CHEMICAL BUSINESS NEWSBASE, 12 Nov 1996

Ref: Gazeta Mercantil, 11 Oct 1996, No. 20.939, Pg. C-3

Original text in PORTUGUESE

Brazil uses 850,000 tonnes/y of lubricants, 65% for automobiles and 35%
in industry, with a value of Reals 1.4 bn.

By contrast, Mexico uses 450,000 tonnes.

The market in Brazil is expected to rise to 900,000 tonnes/y by 2001,
but as the average age of the vehicles in use Brazil, now 6 years,
continues to fall, and oil is replaced less often, the rate of growth
in the use of lubricants will be restrained.

Products will become more specialized.

Exxon Quimica hopes to be able to introduce new formulas if Petrobras'
monopoly is removed and the import of oils and additives is permitted.

It buys 20,000 tonnes/y of aliphatic solvents from Petrobras, for some
$10 M/y.

Shell Brasil has 19% of the market, while Petrobras' BR Distribuidora
has 21%, and hopes to increase this by 2%, worth Reals 28 M/y.

It is investing $4 M in 1996 in marketing a new product, Lubraz SJ.

In an effort to reduce the cost of agrochemicals, a request has been
made to the Japanese Prime Minister's Office by the Central Union of
Agricultural Cooperatives that the application procedures for generic
agrochemicals be simplified.

Currently, companies wishing to market a drug for which the patent has
expired must undertake independent toxicity tests before the chemical
can be considered for registration.

The authorities are understood to be concerned that such a move would
reduce the effort made by companies to develop new products.

A 20,000 sq m/y facility for production of plastic substrates for
semiconductors is to be built at Atsugi by Mitsui Toatsu Chemicals Inc
at a cost of Yen 500 M.

In 1998, the company aims to achieve sales of Yen 1 bn.

Yen 2-3 bn will be invested to increase capacity to 60,000 sq m/y by
early 1999.

Substantial growth is forecast for these substrates for which the
Japanese market currently stands at Yen 40 bn/y.

By 2000, demand could increase to Yen 200 bn/y.

Two types of substrate are to be produced by Mitsui Toatsu Chemicals.

One combines a superfunctional resin and a special metal, and exhibits
higher heat release characteristics.

The other is a polymer alloy which is easier to process and can
withstand soldering temperatures up to 300 degC.

Hexamine supply tightens in Japan

from CHEMICAL BUSINESS NEWSBASE, 12 Nov 1996

In Jul 1996, Mitsui Toatsu Chemicals Inc halted production of
hexamethylenetetramine (hexamine) because it was unprofitable.

This resulted in lower domestic production.

Increased domestic demand for hexamine in Taiwan and China has resulted
in lower exports of the material to Japan.

Thus supplies of hexamine in Japan have tightened.

The primary application for hexamine is in phenol resins as a hardener
and in resins for shell moulding.

The Japanese market is estimated at 12,000 tonne/y and is not expected
to grow.

However, demand elsewhere in Asia is increasing in line with the
growing production there of household electrical appliances and
automobiles.

No capacity expansions are expected by the two remaining producers,
Nippon Kasei Chemical Co and Mitsubishi Gas Chemical, which are also
finding production unprofitable.

They both have capacities of around 5500 tonne/y.

The technology is protected by patents, preventing small and
medium-sized companies from gaining significant market share.

However, a mixture of PET (90%) and polyethylene naphthalate (PEN)
(10%) has been used by researchers at Aoki Technical Laboratory to
produce a bottle that is resistant to higher temperatures up to 90
degC.

Such bottles can be sterilized and be used for hot-fill products.

New organosilicone adjuvant approved in UK

from CHEMICAL BUSINESS NEWSBASE, 12 Nov 1996

Ref: International Pest Control, Sep-Oct 1996, Vol. 38, No. 5, Pg. 170

Lambson Agricultural Services, UK, has introduced a new organosilicone
adjuvant called Cutonic Booster.

It is authorised for use with all pesticides approved for application
on cereals and grass.

Lambson claims Cutonic Booster has a much broader authorisation than
other organosilicones commercially available.

It is also the most highly concentrated organosilicone approved in the
UK.

The product is a 100% polyalkylene oxide modified heptamethyl
trisiloxane and has a powerful, non-ionic wetting and spreading action
that can provide 5 times the coverage of a traditional surfactant used
at 25% of the rate.

Cutonic Booster will give a 25-fold increase in nutrient or pesticide
contact on the leaf compared with water, when applied at only 0.1% of
the spray solution.

Quickphos: an alternative to methyl bromide fumigation

from CHEMICAL BUSINESS NEWSBASE, 12 Nov 1996

Ref: International Pest Control, Sep-Oct 1996, Vol. 38, No. 5, Pg. 152-153

United Phosphorus Ltd is producing aluminium phosphide, formulated
under the trade name Quickphos, for the post-harvest control of pests
in storage and distribution.

It is a suitable alternative to methyl bromide which has been condemned
as an ozone-depleter and classified under the Montreal Protocol as a
controlled substance.

Aluminium phosphide controls both insect and rodent pests.

United Phosphorus also produces and supplies magnesium phosphide under
the trade name Magnaphos.

This product is used in more specialist situations such as tobacco
stores, warehouses and ships' holds, because of its more rapid release
of phosphine.

Quickphos can only be handled and supplied by specialist operators.

Lobel to introduce new mosquito larvicide formulation

from CHEMICAL BUSINESS NEWSBASE, 12 Nov 1996

Ref: International Pest Control, Sep-Oct 1996, Vol. 38, No. 5, Pg. 147

Lobel Chemical Corp, a US exporter of specialist pesticides, has
introduced LarvX SG, a novel, patented formulation of Bacillus
thuringiensis var israelensis (Bti) mosquito larvicide.

LarvX SG is a highly selective insecticide.

It has 31% higher active ingredient than conventional Bti granules.

Control authorities concerned about the development of resistance to
temephos larvicide may be particularly interested.

Bti is acknowledged as one of the most effective and environmentally
acceptable mosquito control substances currently available.

Bti contains protein crystals that become toxic to the mosquito only
after activation in the insect's intestinal tract.

Humans, vertebrates, and most other insects have an acidic gut
environment and so are unaffected by the proteins.

Microorganisms can metabolise some soil-applied agrochemicals

from CHEMICAL BUSINESS NEWSBASE, 12 Nov 1996

Ref: International Pest Control, Sep-Oct 1996, Vol. 38, No. 5, Pg. 142

A group of bacteria have been identified which could have potential in
a new biological system for degrading persistent organic chemicals.

The bacteria are particularly effective at degrading isoproturon, one
of the UK's most widely used herbicides.

Isoproturon is a significant contaminant of surface water in the UK
agricultural areas.

It can also contaminate water indirectly during the disposal of excess
spray or the cleaning of sprayers.

When the microorganisms are added to soil or water samples containing
isoproturon, they grow and quickly break down the isoproturon.

One of the microorganisms can degrade the isoproturon within days.

Bioremediation of contaminated land or water resources could be
straightforward.

Boots shrugs off price-fixing move

from CHEMICAL BUSINESS NEWSBASE, 12 Nov 1996

Ref: The Independent, 8 Nov 1996, Pg. 20

Boots moved yesterday to defuse worries that the OFT's recent challenge
to retail price maintenance in non-prescription drugs might lead to a
damaging price war.

Sir Michael Angus, chairman, said the decision to refer Britain's last
legal price-fixing arrangement to the Restrictive Practices Court was
disappointing but he said Boots the Chemists was well placed whatever
its conclusion.

He added: "The company believes that retail price maintenance on
over-the-counter medicines should remain in force because consumer
interests are best served by retaining the service to local communities
currently provided by pharmacists.

Only a small proportion of Boots the Chemists' sales would be affected
and past experience suggests that the business would emerge with
increased market share.

John Bridgeman, the OFT's director general, said three weeks ago that a
26 year old agreement which allows manufacturers to set prices on
over-the-counter treatments such as painkillers and vitamins had cost
consumers #180 M a year on average through artifically high prices.

The move, which some analsysts believe could lead to price reductions
of up to 15% and cut Boots' overall profits by as much as 6%, was a
victory for Asda, the supermarket chain, which has led a campaign to
scrap the arrangement.

Sir Michael Angus was speaking as Boots reported a 9% rise in profits
before exceptional items in the six months to Sep 1996.

Boots the Chemists, the core pharmacy chain, saw profits rise from
#164.3 M to #184 M.

British Biotech shares slump on 'complicated data'

from CHEMICAL BUSINESS NEWSBASE, 12 Nov 1996

Ref: The Independent, 5 Nov 1996, Pg. 19

British Biotech's shares slumped 9% yesterday despite test results
which the company claimed provided further confirmation of the
effectiveness of its Marimastat anti-cancer treatment.

The company, whose shares soared a year ago on hopes for Marimastat,
said the phase two trials involving 381 cancer sufferers were the most
wide-ranging yet and gave further evidence of the drug's ability to
restrain the disease across a wide range of cancers.

But it was rewarded with a 21.5p slump in the share price to 207.5p
yesterday.

James Noble, finance director said: "It is rather odd that the shares
have gone down, because these are by far the most important results we
have reported as a company."

He ascribed the reaction to the fact that data was "just very, very
complicated".

Many analysts, however, downplayed the significance of the results,
which for the first time included information on trials with patients
with gastric and colorectal cancers.

One analyst said: "Our broad thinking is that the information dosen't
really add substantially to what we already know."

Questions remained about the dosage regime and the side-effects of the
drug, which causes pains in the arm and shoulder when used over a
prolonged period.

The data was presented at the European Society for Medical Oncology
meeting in Vienna, which brings together cancer specialists from all
around Europe.

British Biotech said the tests confirmed earlier results that showed
higher dosage rates of 10mg, 25mg and 50mg twice a day were more
effective than lower ones.

The group claimed that the outcomes confirmed there was a connection
between a reduction in antigens, used as a marker to monitor the
progression of cancer, and a reduction in the disease.

"It is absolutely proved that we can reduce the antigens in a group of
381 patients and where we reduce the antigens people live longer," Mr
Noble said, "We obviously think it is the drug's effect, but we can't
prove it as yet."

The results in 14 patients suffering from gastric cancers showed half
appearing to respond or showing no further progression of the disease.

Despite microscopic evidence that Marimastat was coating tumours in a
fibre, as predicted, analysts said the sample size was too small to be
significant.

Other studies in colorectal, ovarian and pancreatic cancers had shown
similar results, Mr Noble said.

Phase three trials under way on Marimastat remains the key to the
drug's final approval and launch onto the market, which is unlikely
before 1999 or 2000, analysts say.

A treatment for pancreatic cancer is likely to be first to market, but
external sales forecasts vary widely from $100 M in the first year to
$1 bn.

Later this month, the group will give phase three test data for its
Lexipaphant treatment.

Medeva wins court case

from CHEMICAL BUSINESS NEWSBASE, 12 Nov 1996

Ref: The Independent, 1 Nov 1996, Pg. 26

Medeva, the drugs group, yesterday won final victory in its legal
battle to defend its novel Hepatitis B vaccine against rivals Biogen of
the US.

The House of Lords threw out an appeal by Biogen attempting to overturn
an earlier ruling by the Court of Appeal that Medeva's drug, Hepagene,
did not infringe its patent over a similar treatment.

Alexandra Hockenhull, a Medeva spokeswoman, said: "The outcome sends a
very strong signal.

We had felt extremely confident all along.

We had a decisive victory in the appeal court and now, with another
decisive victory in the House of Lords, we feel even more confident.

The group still faces a separate patent infringement action over
Hepagene filed in 1993 by Pasteur-Merieux, a French drugs group.

However, it had not proceeded "expeditiously" with the claim, she said,
and a trial date had not yet been requested or set.

The drug, which is still under development, was acquired for a little
over $3 M by Medeva in 1992 from a group of Swiss and German scientists
known as Epitec.

Biogen, whose own Hepatitis B vaccine is licensed to SmithKline Beecham
and Merck, won an initial action against Medeva in the High Court in
1993.

But the House of Lords ruled yesterday that Biogen's patent was invalid
in the UK.

Medeva said it hoped to announce the results of phase three trials of
Hepagene as a vaccine in Jan 1997, with phase 2 proof of principal
tests on its effectiveness as a treatment due by the end of the year.

Estimates suggest that around 30 M people in the world carrying the
Hepatitis B virus are highly infectious.

Biogen's chief executive, Jim Vincent, said: "Although we expect to
continue receiving our UK royalties of less than a million dollars
annually based on the surviving Hepatitis B patent, we are clearly
disappointed by today's decision."

recycles nickel-cadmium accumulators.

BG's entrance onto the Polish photochemicals market should be
accelerated by the prepared subsidiary Foma Poland.

BG expects a consolidated turnover of CEK 1.2-1.5 bn in 1996.

The most of the sum should be generated by the parent company,
Bochemie, and the photochemicals manufacturer, Foma, Czech Republic.

Bochemie expects proceeds of about CEK 525 M and a gross profit of
about CEK 45 M.

Foma plans a profit of approximately CEK 400 M.

BG has three field subgroups.

The chemical subgroup is headed by Bochemie, the photochemical subgroup
by Foma and the pharmaceutical subgroup by Bofarma (Brno, Czech
Republic).

BG holds a 60% stake in Permedia, Poland, which used to supply Bochemie
with semi-products for accumulator material manufacture.

Original text in GERMAN

Ormecon Chemie GmbH & Co KG at Ahrensburg in Germany aims to
revolutionise industrial corrosion inhibition with organic metals,
mainly in the aviation and ship-building industries over the next 5-7
years.

This will be achieved with the new plastic Ormecon which exhibits the
properties of a metal.

On average Ormecon provides corrosion protection for between 2 to 5
times longer than conventional materials.

Ormecon Chemie will concentrate the marketing of Ormecon on industry
sectors that still apply toxic materials such as chromate, for example
corrosion inhibitors in aviation building and multi-storey steel
constructions.

Even the US space agency NASA is interested in the new material.

Other application sectors are discussed.

Ormecon is already marketed in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Poland
and Hungary.

The new material is manufactured at Ormecon Chemie in Ahrensburg in
Germany and at the facility of a licensee in Buffalo, NY in the US.

Ormecon Chemie is a subsidiary of Zipperling Kessler & Co.

The company achieves turnover of below DM 1 M/y and still operates with
a loss.

Towards the end of 1996 Ormecon Chemie's capital will be increased to a
double-digit million deutschmark figure.

Ormecon's expansion will be accelerated by the taking up of venture
capital worth around DM 20 M.

Ormecon Chemie is expected to break-even soon.

The company is owned by 6 private investors.

Cautious forecasts envisage a turnover increase of between DM 10-20 M
in the coming decade; optimistic forecasts put this figure as high as
DM 200 M.

Ormecon Chemie GmbH plans to enter the stockmarket in 7-8 years.

Versatile PVC compounds suit broad end-use needs

from CHEMICAL BUSINESS NEWSBASE, 12 Nov 1996

Ref: Modern Plastics International, Oct 1996, Vol. 26, No. 10, Pg. 87,88,90

New thermoplastic elastomers based on 20, 30, and 40% partially
crosslinked PVC (Sumiflex K compounds) have been introduced by the GES
Co of Leominster, MA, US, for automotive interior applications.

Compounds based on UHMW PVC are available from Colorite of Ridgefield,
NK, US, Elf Atochem of Paris, France and Mitsubishi Kasei Vinyl of
Tokyo, Japan.

Atochem has also introduced Seon Kasei, for powder slush moulding of
interior automotive parts, in Europe.

New from LVM of Tessenderlo, Belgium are refined grades of its Tefanyl
and Marvylex compounds.

Teknor Apex has launched a range of flexible UHMW-PVC compounds and has
received approval for its Flexalloy TPE compounds from the Underwriters
Laboratories.

Applications for flexible PVC compounds are being targeted by
polyloefins produced with metallocene and advanced Ziegler-Natta
catalyst technology.

Medical bags, which have a market in the US of 50,960 tonnes/y, are 90%
vulnerable to such replacement.

Medical tubing, with a market of 76,000 tonnes/y is 80% vulnerable, as
is medicalware with a market of 19,600 tonnes/y.

Range of barrier options upgrade flexible packaging

from CHEMICAL BUSINESS NEWSBASE, 12 Nov 1996

Ref: Modern Plastics International, Oct 1996, Vol. 26, No. 10, Pg.
70-71,73,75

Over the next few years it is expected that barrier packaging will
increase its market share at the expense of glass and metal, with
highest growth forecast in Europe and Asia.

Demand for ethylene vinyl alcohol (EVOH) is expected to grow by 16-20%
in Europe and by 14-16% in N America with worldwide demand increasing
25% to 30,800 tonnes/y.

A new production line is to be installed by EVAL Corp, a subsidiary of
Kuraray of Japan which dominates the global EVOH market with a 70%
share, at Pasadena, TX, US, which will increase capacity from 12,740
tonnes/y to 18,200 tonnes/y.

The company is also planning to invest $74 M in a food grade packaging
material plant in Europe or N America.

Flexible films are the fastest growing EVOH packaging material
accounting for about 28-30% of the total market.

New EVOH resins including the hybrid film VM-XL, where aluminium is
coated on to EVOH, and an EVOH grade which is crosslinked with
polyolefins giving similar mechanical strength, stretch and heat
resistance as shrink film from Kuraray and Nippon Gohsei's DC302Ae
Soarnol EVOH grade.

EVOH is making inroads into the market for polyvinylidene (PVDC)
despite its predicted 10%/y growth in demand.

In China demand for PVDC is expected to reach 10,000 tonnes/y by 2000
to be met mostly by imports which currently stand at $1450/tonne.

Other new developments in the barrier film market include a 3 layer,
monoaxially oriented nylon from AlliedSignal Specialty Films for quick
sale food items; a Surlyn ionomer resin blended with EVOH grades from
DuPont; hybrid organic/inorganic polymers (Ormocers) from the
Fraunhofer Institute and SiOx barrier coatings to replace aluminium
laminate coatings from Tetra Laval.

PP expansions in Brazil seen easing regional supply crunch

from CHEMICAL BUSINESS NEWSBASE, 12 Nov 1996

Ref: Modern Plastics International, Oct 1996, Vol. 26, No. 10, Pg. 38,39

Consumption of PP in Brazil amounts to 660,000 tonnes/y, about 85% of
its total production.

S America consumes around 91% (911,000 tonnes/y) of its total
production, with demand increasing by 10%/y to 2000, due in part to the
booming automobile sector, particularly in Brazil.

To meet demand Ipiranga Petroquimica is to construct a 150,000 tonnes/y
PP plant by mid 1998 at Triunfo petrochemical complex in Rio Grande do
Sul, Brazil.

Around 50,000 tonnes/y will be exported.

The company has also signed an agreement with five Chilean partners to
build a 100,000 tonnes/y PP plant in Santiago by 1998 at a cost of $120
M.

Around 40-50% of output will be exported.

The new plant will make Chile self sufficient in PP.

OPP Petroquimica is to increase capacity from 300,000 tonnes/y with a
150,000 tonnes/y plant, also at the Triunfo site in Brazil, by early
1999.

It is to export around 20,000 tonnes/y as well as supply its own
compounding facilities including the 25,000 tonnes/y facility in
Triunfo, and the 150,000 tonnes/y unit, due on line by the end of 1996,
in Sao Paulo.

Progress of the biocidal products directive

Ref: The Pesticides Register, Oct 1996, No. 10, Pg. 1

Ministers have reached a Common Position on the proposed directive on
Biocidal Products at a meeting of The Environment Council in Luxembourg
on 26 Jun 1996.

Under the co-decision procedure, the next significant move will be the
second reading in the European Parliament, the result of which will be
considered by Council.

The estimate for adoption is about mid- 1997.

The Biocidal Products Directive has a simplified registration procedure
for low risk products, and it also includes the concepts of frame
formulations and commodity substances.

There is also provision for Member States to charge a fee for
conducting the procedures that the directive requires.

In addition, there is removal of the linkage between the periods of
data protection in The Plant Protection Products Directive (91/414/EEC)
and the Biocides Directive where the same data has already been
protected under 91/414.

Japan's regulations are modelled closely on the US Orphan Drug Act of
1983.

In 1993, the Ministry of Health and Welfare (MHW) implemented Japan's
Orphan Drug Development System by revising Article 77 of the
Pharmaceutical Affairs Law.

Both orphan drugs and devices are covered.

To be designated as an orphan drug, a compound must meet the following
three conditions: (1) it must be a treatment for a rare disease which
affects less than 50,000 patients in Japan; (2) there must be a clear
demand for the compound, with no conventional medicine available; (3)
successful development of the compound must be possible.

Companies apply to MHW for their compound to be designated as an orphan
drug.

If approved, the Organisation for Adverse Drug Reaction Research (OADR)
steps in.

For approved orphan drugs, OADR provides the following incentives to
companies: (1) a grant to cover up to 50% of research and development
costs; (2) guidance and advice on the new drug approval process; (3) a
tax deduction of 6% of R&D costs (excluding the amount of grant
received), limited to 10% of corporation tax; (4) a fast track
providing the highest priority in the new drug approval examination
process; (5) if needed, an extension of the allowable period for
re-examination (the maximum is otherwise ten years).

As of Apr 1995, 80 drugs and four medical devices had been designated
under this procedure.

Most of Japan's orphan drugs have been developed by foreign companies.

Leaded petrol being phased out in Germany; sales of biodiesel set to
increase

from CHEMICAL BUSINESS NEWSBASE, 12 Nov 1996

Ref: OTIS News, 25 Oct 1996, Vol. 6, No. 20, Pg. 7-8

Leaded petrol is to be completely withdrawn from petrol stations
belonging to the German Oil Industry Association by the end of 1996.

Some pumps may instead provide biodiesel, but this sector is set to
continue as a niche market.

Over the last 10 years, the market share of leaded petrol has decreased
to less than 5%.

Annual lead emissions from traffic have therefore decreased from 5000
tonnes in 1984 to 400 tonnes in 1995.

The level of lead in blood has also decreased from an average of 80
ng/ml to 31 ng/ml within the same period.

Having almost completely removed lead, the next step was to reduce
benzene levels in fuels; a first step in this direction has been
achieved through the introduction of a low-benzene Super Plus petrol.

Annual sales of biodiesel, first introduced in Germany five years ago,
currently reach 50,000 tonnes from 500 outlets.

The Association for the Promotion of Oil and Protein Plants (UFOP)
estimates that 100 more petrol stations will be offering the fuel by
the end of 1997 and aims to reach 1000 outlets within five years.

Biodiesel, which is not subject to duty, is currently cheaper than its
conventional equivalent.

Its relative unavailability, however, presents a barrier to its wider
use.

Despite the merger between Ciba and Sandoz into Novartis, the name Ciba
will remain.

The former 5 Ciba divisions are expected to be launched on the
stockmarket in 1Q 1997 under the name Ciba Spezialitaetenchemie AG,
according to a Ciba spokesperson.

Former Ciba divisions Polymers, Additives, Pigments, Textile Dyes and
Chemicals will be united in Ciba Spezialitaetenchemie AG after the
merger.

However, this will only go ahead if approval for the merger is received
by the US Cartel Office by Dec 1996.

Sandoz already divested its chemicals activities in 1995 and launched
them on the stockmarket as the independent company Clariant.

Customs officers at Houston Intercontinental Airport recently opened a
container taken from a passenger of an extract, described as an
experimental pesticide, of the neem tree.

Four hours later fumes began emitting from the canister which were
carried by the ventilation system.

Several people reported headaches, nausea and dizziness and the
terminal was evacuated and closed for 3 hours.

Houston Fire Department's hazardous materials response team ruled the
material to be a non-toxic irritant and turned the canister over to EPA
(Environmental Protection Agency).

It is not known whether charges will be brought against the passenger.

Ciba Crop Protection has informed EPA (Environmental Protection Agency)
that complying with FIFRA (Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and
Rodenticide Rule) Section 6(a)(2) adverse effects reporting rule places
a larger burden on pesticide registrants than had been expected.

Ciba fully supports the American Crop Protection Association's call to
lengthen the comment period available on the entire rule.

Ciba alone would need to train over 1,000 staff in the USA and an
undetermined number world-wide.

The requirement on registrants to report unexpected exposures when
there is no evidence of adverse effects could be dropped to save the
unnecessary reporting of thousands of unrelated incidents with no
bearing on the registration of the product.

The time taken for retroactive reviewing of company files has also been
grossly underestimated by EPA.

Greenpeace is stepping up its campaign against foods genetically
altered to resist pesticides.

In recent press briefings it highlights alleged environmental and
health dangers of Monsanto's Roundup-Ready soybeans and Ciba-Geigy's
genetically altered maize which are due to be marketed autumn 1996.

The research farm in Iowa of Asgrow Seed Co, recently bought by
Monsanto and selling some 80% of the company's genetically altered
seed, was vandalized.

In Europe the pressure group is pushing for the separation of
genetically engineered foods from other crops and for the banning of
the import of such foods.

Switzerland already requires the labelling of genetically altered foods
and Norway will not sell US soya products unless those genetically
altered are identified.

A German survey found that 85% of those polled did not want to consume
genetically altered foods.

However, Australia, Japan and the USA have approved modified soybeans
and maize.

Monsanto counters that one of the advantages of their introduction is
the lowering of pesticide use.

In its draft "Guide to clear labelling statements" the EPA
(Environmental Protection Agency) emphasises the need for clear and
concise labels.

Labels need to: identify the product and its contents and give
directions for use such that the product will function safely; specify
permitted uses; list non-pesticidal uses only if approved by another
federal agency; be free from statement contradictions.

Statements should be either directive, as required by law, or advisory.

The latter, with which users are not legally required to comply, may be
required by EPA to prevent unreasonable effects or may be voluntarily
added by the registrant.

A symposium on the FQPA (Food Quality Protection Act) was organized by
the Institute of Food Technologists in Oct 1996.

The Grocery Manufacturers of America believes that the Act will result
in the development of more biopesticides and plants genetically
engineered for pest resistance.

It expressed concern at the politicization of pesticide residues and
the level of civil penalties against food processors who violate
pesticide residue tolerances.

Further concern was the oestrogenic and cumulative effects of
pesticides.

The view was expressed that FQPA would encourage the employment of
minor use pesticides to the benefit of the food industry.

The Food Chain Coalition is to monitor implementation of FQPA and
encourage congressional interest as a means of retaining pesticides.

balance audit and present a flow diagram showing the fate of their
toxic materials.

A report needs to be filed every other year.

The companies are given technical assistance to comply through the

Guidance on the situation of use of products used in vertebrate control

Ref: The Pesticides Register, Oct 1996, No. 10, Pg. 2

Several of the active substances currently approved for use in
vertebrate control are restricted to indoor use only.

No agreement on a definition of what is meant by indoors is so far been
agreed.

The consequence has been several enquiries to the Pesticides Safety
Directorate as to which situations come under the category of indoors.

Some pest control operators have defined open barns and rat holes as
indoors.

Relevant government departments and Committees, together with industry
have agreed the following definition of indoors: Situations where the
bait is placed within a building or other enclosed structure, and where
the target is living or feeding predominantly within that building or
structure.

The Pesticides Safety Directorate has also stated that any rodenticide
product approved for use indoors or outdoors can also be legally
applied in sewers.

ITW buys thermoforming firm

from CHEMICAL BUSINESS NEWSBASE, 12 Nov 1996

Ref: Plastics News, 4 Nov 1996, Vol. 8, No. Electronic version

Dacco Industries, thermoformer, has been purchased by ITW Electronic
Component Packaging Systems.

ITW concentrates on plastics packaging for the semiconductor and socket
and connector markets and Dacco is a good fit, with its niche in vacuum
forming thin-gauge multi-cavity tubes for connectors.

The plan is to expand into other market segments with Dacco, such as
packaging populated printed circuit boards and disk-drive components.

ITW Electronic Component Packaging already has five companies worldwide
making extruded and injection molded plastic packaging.

Through its ITW Meritex unit, the company extrudes shipping tubes,
primarily of PVC, in Arlington; and in Malacca and Pinang, Malaysia.

ITW Ampang of Baguio, Philippines, also extrudes shipping and handling
tubes, mainly for the Philippine market.

ITW Thielex extrudes packaging for the socket and connector market in
Somerset, NJ.

ITW Camtex, with operations in Arlington, Pinang and Fremont, CA,
injection molds engineered plastic trays and other packaging.

ITW C-Pak forms carbon-loaded, static-dissipative polystyrene tape for
packaging tiny electronic devices.

The tape is shipped to customers on reels.

EPA recommends recycled-content pallet rules

from CHEMICAL BUSINESS NEWSBASE, 12 Nov 1996

Ref: Plastics News, 4 Nov 1996, Vol. 8, No. Electronic version

Plastic shipping pallets purchased by the federal government could be
required to be made entirely of recycled plastic, according to a new
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposal.

However, the order may be ignored by government purchasers as EPA
refers to no performance or product standards and allows great leeway
in its enforcement.

The effect on the US Postal Service is also unclear as the department
already has 3 M orange-and-black, 40-by-48-inch high molecular weight
polyethylene cargo pallets in use nationwide and is one of the biggest
users of plastic pallets in the world.

An improved engineering design has produced second-generation pallets
containing no more than 30% post industrial regrind and post-consumer
PE.

Specifications are being created now to cover the third generation,
which would probably call for not less than 30% post-consumer waste and
regrind.

Thermoforming is one of three commonly used plastic pallet
manufacturing processes.

Others are made of plastic lumber or structural foam molded.

Alloyd's DeKalb, IL plant.

Capacity will be raised to 20 M lbs of PVC sheet and should be onstream
by early 1997.

Alloyd will hire about 40 new workers for the operation.

The expansion is intended to give customers a lower-cost product in
less time.

Alloyd will do about $54 M in thermoformed blister packs and
clamshells, mainly for retail packaging, using PVC, polystyrene, PET
and other materials.

Its equipment division will do another $6 M in sales of collating,
cartoning and sealing equipment for packaging operations.

Pitch-based graphite hitting new markets

from CHEMICAL BUSINESS NEWSBASE, 12 Nov 1996

Ref: Plastics News, 23 Sep 1996, Vol. 8, No. 30, Pg. 11

There is great potential for replacement of metals in automotive and
electronics applications by pitch-based graphite fibres.

Amoco Performance Products Inc is currently developing pitch fibres
which are thermally conductive.

The fibres can be produced at its facility in Greenville, SC.

Amoco Xydar thermoplastic moulding compound which incorporates a high-
conductivity carbon fibre filling, is already used by Wakefield
Engineering Inc in its Deltem II heat sink as a replacement for
polyphenylenesulfide resin.

Amoco's P-120 pitch-based fibre is being used by Hexcel Corp for
production of carbon honeycomb core for the inner barrel of the 777
twinjets manufactured by Boeing Co, replacing an aluminium sandwich
structure.

The composite material does not corrode and is lighter than its
aluminium counterpart.

Heat is also conducted away from the engine by the honeycomb acoustic
core wrapped around it.

For hard points on the inner core of the barrel, Amoco T300-1K
PAN-based fibre is used by Hexcel.

Amoco Performance Products is seeking to develop applications of their
conductive fibres in the electronics sector.

Opportunities also exist in the automotive sector.

Amoco unit feels heat to supply hot PAN: carbon fibre demand tight

from CHEMICAL BUSINESS NEWSBASE, 12 Nov 1996

Ref: Plastics News, 23 Sep 1996, Vol. 8, No. 30, Pg. 11

Demand for carbon fibre for aerospace applications is growing rapidly,
led by an increase in the construction rate of commercial aircraft by
Boeing Co.

This has led to a shortage of supply.

Almost all of the output from Amoco Performance Products Inc's 2.2 M
lb/y PAN-based carbon fibre production capacity in Greenville, SC, is
for aerospace applications.

By 1997, availability of carbon fibre for sporting applications would
also be difficult, but there are a number of planned production
increases which should ease this situation.

Toray Industries Inc, Toho Rayon Co, Zoltek Cos Inc, Akzo Nobel NV and
RK International Ltd are all planning to raise capacity.

By the end of 1997, Amoco Performance Products plans to achieve full
capacity of 2 M lb/y at its facility in Rock Hill, SC.

The unit is undergoing refurbishment and debottlenecking.

Capacity amounting to 1 M lb/y was brought back onstream in late 1995.

Mylar metallized PET film, produced by DuPont for use in microwave
packaging, is to be perforated by EPL Technologies Inc.

This will enable steam to escape from the packaging during cooking,
thus maintaining the correct texture.

Two gas-flame perforating lines are to be installed by the company at
its Crystal Specialty Films facility in Oswego, IL.

Sales from the new production lines could amount to as much as $15 M/y.

Some DuPont films will be distributed by EPL Technologies under an
agreement which makes it the only company undertaking gas-flame
perforating for DuPont, for its plastic films made from polyethylene
naphthalate, PET and nylon.

Respire is an LDPE film produced by DuPont.

Currently it is being perforated for use in bread packaging by a UK
subsidiary of EPL Technologies, Bakery Packaging Services Ltd.

In due course, the company plans to market Respire in the US.

A study by the Composites Fabricators Association has concluded that
the first action to be taken to reduce styrene emissions from open
moulds was to ensure that spray guns were properly set up and spraying
techniques properly carried out.

Spray tips should be properly adjusted with the gun being used at the
lowest practicable pressure.

Spray-off should be caught and operators adequately trained.

Further research is being carried out including the use of suppressants
for styrene and alternative application treatments.

be raised by around 40% by moving PC sheet production to the new plant.

The Verolite double-wall sheet is used for optical applications such as
solariums, skylights and greenhouses, and requires a dust-free
production atmosphere.

Currently it is produced at Bertheirville, PQ, where Matra Plast also
produces HDPE, polypropylene and copolyester sheet.

Silicone foam from Paulstra

from CHEMICAL BUSINESS NEWSBASE, 12 Nov 1996

Ref: Plastiques Modernes et Elastomeres, Oct 1996, Vol. 48, No. 8
(supplement), Pg. 8-9

Original text in FRENCH

Paulstra, a member of the Hutchinson group and a European leader in
rubber processing, has been working for about 15 years on a range of
high performance silicone-based products called Paulstrasil foams.

Their chemical properties are distinct from those of other products due
to their unique chemical composition, based on a skeleton of
alternating silicone and oxygen atoms similar to that found in highly
heat-resistant materials such as quartz, glass and sand.

Their main characteristics are resistance to numerous agents including
ozone, chemicals, weather, radiation and high and low temperatures.

They offer good fire resistance without the release of toxic gas and
generate a very low density of smoke.

Initially developed for thermal protection in the aerospace industry,
Paulstrasil silicones are now finding application in many areas of
industry.

In 1H 1996 production of pharmaceuticals by 28 foreign-capitalised
companies in South Korea totalled $475 M, up 10.37% on 1H 1995.

The 28 companies are classified into 3 groups.

The first group, 9 companies lead by US corporations, increased
production by 5.2% to $138.5 M.

The second group, 13 companies lead by European concerns, increased
production 10.7% to $298.4 M; this group is more dependent on
foreign-made products.

The third group, 6 companies lead by Japanese firms, increased
production 30.3% to $37.9 M.

The drug production values of 20 major joint venture companies for 1H
1996 are listed.

The top 3 companies were Han Dok, Janssen Korea and Pfizer Korea, with
values of $86.8 M, $60.3 M and $39.9 M, respectively.

In general, joint ventures place more emphasis on imports than domestic
production because they find it difficult to cover all the risks
involved in their weak production structure.

Gist-brocades: production of clavulanic acid reaches advanced stage

from CHEMICAL BUSINESS NEWSBASE, 12 Nov 1996

Ref: The Gist, Autumn 1996, No. 66, Pg. 13-14

Gist-brocades' new clavulanic acid plant in Strangnas, Sweden, is now
on stream.

The first kilograms of product were released in Sep 1996.

Clavulanic acid offers an attractive opportunity for Gist-brocades.

As patent protection starts to expire, this presents an opportunity to
enter the market for generic bulk clavulanic acid.

The production of potassium clavulanate is a natural extension of the
company's core activities.

It is produced by large-scale fermentation.

Clavulanic acid is at present marketed by SmithKline Beecham who hold
patents on it, and recently a few generic suppliers have also entered
the market.

Several patents have expired or will soon.

In the very near future, patents related to the therapeutic use of
clavulanic acid in combination with beta-lactams like amoxicillin will
be expiring as well, or have already expired.

In Jul 1996 the European Patent Office granted a patent on a process to
purify clavulanic acid.

The development of additional cost-effective processes is in the phase
of completion and patent applications will be submitted soon.

The European Pharmacopoeia Commission has granted a Certificate of
Suitability (CoS) for potassium clavulanate produced in the
Netherlands.

It will soon be followed by a CoS for the material produced in Sweden.

The industrial quantities now being produced in Sweden will enable
customers to penetrate the market with generic clavulanic acid.

Gist-brocades' objective is to become market leader in the generic
supply of bulk clavulanic acid.

It is aiming for a global presence.

Over the last year-and-half Gist-brocades' Bakery Ingredients Division
(BID) has been expanding its presence, especially in Latin America.

In a series of strategic acquisitions and participations most parts of
this vast continent are now covered by the division's operations.

The aim is to further increase this network and obtain a significant
market share for yeast and bakery ingredients.

An interview with Bert Jongejan, Managing Director of the BID, is
presented which fills in the background to this expansion, which fits
in perfectly with the BID's global strategy.

Gist-brocades is market leader in Chile for yeast as well as for bakery
ingredients.

Gist-brocades has been carefully looking for partnerships and take-over
candidates and in several countries has been successful.

In 1997 Gist-brocades will be changing its focus to another continent:
Asia.

Potentially Asia is a huge market for all its products.

Nutrition is a target area for an increasing number of food and
pharmaceutical companies wishing to focus on the development of foods
for specific population segments.

The recent major product developments of Gist-brocades in this area are
outlined.

Gist-brocades has developed a proprietary large-scale production
process for arachidonic acid (ARA), and is performing application
studies on ARA-oil and DHA-oil, in cooperation with a number of infant
formula companies.

Commercial introduction is expected by the end of 1996.

In collaboration with the US company Agennix Inc, Gist-brocades is
producing human lactoferrin through fermentation of the fungus
Aspergillus awamori.

The efficacy of human lactoferrin is being evaluated in a variety of
applications.

The quest for natural food products has increased the interest in new
sources of beta-carotene.

Gist-brocades has developed a production technology using large-scale
fermentation of the fungus Blakeslea trispora.

Commercial quantities are expected in early 1997.

Gist-brocades: half-yearly figures 1996: distinct increase in 1H profit

from CHEMICAL BUSINESS NEWSBASE, 12 Nov 1996

Ref: The Gist, Autumn 1996, No. 66, Pg. 2

The profit after taxation of Royal Gist-Brocades NV for the first six
months of 1996 came to HFL 69.7 M.

This is an increase of 8.2% on 1H 1995.

Since changes in exchange rates were minor, their impact on this growth
was limited.

Operating profit grew 10% to HFL 87.9 M.

The results of the Industrial Pharmaceutical Products Division were
virtually the same as those for 1H 1995, whereas profitability at the
Bakery Ingredients and Food Specialties Divisions distinctly improved.

Consolidated net turnover amounted to HFL 980.8 M, up more than 10% on
1H 1995.

HFL 90 M of the 1996 turnover relates to new acquisitions.

Organic growth in turnover amounted to 8%.

Gist-brocades expects the net profit for the whole of 1996 to be
distinctly higher than that for the whole of 1995.

Sales of yeast and bakery ingredients increased strongly.

This was the result of acquisitions in Spain and Latin America and
rising fresh and dry yeast selling prices.

Turnover of industrial pharmaceutical products was also up.

This is the result partly of acquisitions and partly of organic growth.

Profit remained at much the same level.

Acquisitions brought expansion to the dairy and beverage ingredient
operations.

Combined with steady further growth in the other activities, this
resulted in a considerable increase in turnover.

Ref: Raisio Group Interim Report 1 Jan-31 Aug 1996, 15 Oct 1996, Pg. 1-4

Raisio Group's turnover for the 1 Jan-31 Aug 1996 period was FM 2476 M,
up 20% compared with the same period in 1995.

International turnover doubled, reaching FM 945 M, or 38% of total
turnover.

Exports from Finland grw 68%, totalling 487 M.

The Jan-Aug profit before extraordinary items was FM 91.5 M, accounting
for 3.7% of turnover.

The result improved markedly on Jan-Apr but was weaker than in the
corresponding period in 1995.

The Chemicals Division improved its result, following the slight slump
around the turn of the year.

The consolidated operating margin was FM 267.8 M, accounting for 10.8%
of turnover.

The amount remained roughly on the 1995 level.

Net financial expense came to FM 32.1 M, against FM 33.9 M a year
earlier.

The targeted consolidated turnover continues to be FM 4 bn.

The financial result is expected to fall just slightly short of that
for 1995.

The Group's gross investments in Jan-Aug were FM 126 M, or 5.1% of
turnover.

The expansion of the margarine plant in Poland, construction of the
Animal Feeds Division's meal storage facility in Raisio and initial
investments in the stanol ester production plant were the principal
investments.

For the corresponding period in 1995, investments were FM 246 M.

Total investments for the 1996 financial year were expected to reach FM
230 M.

In terms of the entire year, the principal investment is processing of
plant sterols.

As of the beginning of 1996, Raisio Engineering Ltd and Flootek AB,
which operates in Sweden, were made subsidiaries of Raisio Chemicals
Ltd.

Roe Lee Canada Inc changed its name to Raisio Chemicals Canada Inc and
the business operations of Diachem Industries Ltd were merged with it
from the beginning of Jun.

The margarine plant bought in Poland last Dec was inaugurated in Aug,
following renovation and expansion.

The Polish subsidiary is targeting a FM 300 M turnover this year.

Production of margarines for the Polish market has now been transferred
to the enlarged plant, which has a capacity of some 60 M kilos/y of
margarine.

Sales of malts to Finnish breweries decreased slightly on the previous
year.

Exports, however, grew substantially, accounting for 70% of the Malting
Subdivision's FM 81 M turnover.

Industry's focus shifting from recycling

from CHEMICAL BUSINESS NEWSBASE, 12 Nov 1996

Ref: Plastics News, 30 Sep 1996, Vol. 8, No. 31, Pg. 8

As public concern shifts away from the problem of solid waste, plastics
companies are turning their attention away from expensive programmes to
recycle plastics to other, more profitable, areas.

At Piscataway, NJ, Union Carbide is to close its HDPE recycling
facility.

Quantum Chemical Co closed a similar unit at Heath, OH, 18 months ago.

On 1 Oct 1996, declining funding from industry will force the closure
of the Center for Plastics Recycling Research, based at Rutgers
University.

The requirement for a minimum recycled content in food packaging in
California, LA, has been dropped from the state's recycling
legislation.

The American Plastics Council is no longer aiming at a 25% recycling
target for rigid bottles and containers.

The plastics industry is now concentrating its efforts on wider
environmentally friendly programmes.

Recyclers optimistic despite setbacks

from CHEMICAL BUSINESS NEWSBASE, 12 Nov 1996

Ref: Plastics News, 30 Sep 1996, Vol. 8, No. 31, Pg. 7

Plastics recyclers have to overcome the problems associated with
collection, sorting and reprocessing for a variety of plastics.

One of the major problems facing the sector is the low price of virgin
resin, making recycling less profitable.

Several recyclers have close because of the low profitability,
including Quantum Chemical Co and Union Carbide Corp, which have closed
their HDPE recycling operations.

Wellman Inc is the biggest recycler of PET worldwide and runs a
profitable operation, with sales of over $1 bn/y.

However, it is finding profitability falling as prices fall.

In 1995, 622 M lbs of PET was recycled in the US according to the
National Association for Plastic Container Recovery.

Loosefill packaging is proving a significant niche market for recyclers
of polystyrene. 10 M lb/y of polystyrene packaging containing 35%
recycled material is made by Free-Flow Packaging Corp. 300,000-400,000
lb/month of polyethylene film is recycled by Sonoco Products Co.

This mainly comes from T-shirt bags and pallet wrap.

The company is finding it difficult to obtain sufficient material for
recycling and is encouraging consumers to return the bags to grocery
stores.

Chapparal Films Inc has been acquired by Illinois Tool Works Inc for an
undisclosed sum.

Polyethylene films are produced on two cast film lines at Mauriceville,
TX. 60% of the company's cast film output uses metallocene polymers.

The five-layers films are sold primarily for pallet wrap.

ITW Mima is responsible for the plastic film operations of Illinois
Tool Works, and it plans to begin production of blown stretch film at a
new facility in Waterford, Ireland, by the end of 1996.

Output from the new unit will be sold in Europe.

Capacity for stretch film is to be expanded by Intertape Polymer Group
Inc at Danville, VA, at a cost of $17 M.

The expansion will raise capacity to 100 M lb/y.

Deerfield Plastics Co is to be acquired by Huntsman Packaging Corp,
expanding the latter's capacity for production of polyethylene pallet
wrap.

Within the next 12 months, capacity for cast and blown stretch film
will be expanded in the US and Canada by Sigma Plastics.

By Apr 1997, at least 75 M lb/y capacity for cast and blown stretch PE
films is to be brought onstream by Armin Plastics, with an investment
of $15 M.

Capacity for production of pallet wrap is estimated to be 30% greater
than demand.

Stretch film capacity is estimated at 1.2 bn lb/y, 10% higher than
demand.

In Oct 1996, the purchase of Borden Global Packaging by AEP is due to
be completed.

This will considerably increase AEP's potential sales of PE stretch
pallet wrap, which currently stand at $96 M/y.

On 31 Aug 1996, the requirement in California for a minimum recycled
content in plastic products was effectively repealed, supported by
resin producers and retail merchants.

The American Plastics Council denies that it has not given sufficient
support to efforts to recycle plastics.

It is accused of leaving the organisation of collection programmes to
local authorities.

However, these have found it difficult to get a return from plastics
recycling.

One problem being faced is the low cost of virgin resins.

New, non-yellowing resin from Croda

from CHEMICAL BUSINESS NEWSBASE, 12 Nov 1996

Ref: Press Release,  7 Nov 1996, 1 p

Croda Resins has developed a new, acrylic hybrid resin that is designed
to overcome the coatings problems of yellowing, particularly in areas
that are shaded from direct sunlight.

The new material, Crodaplast AC-300, also offers faster touch dry and
through dry times, excellent water resistance and good exterior
durability.

These benefits are the result of combining Croda's expertise in
air-drying and acrylic polymer technology.

Crodaplast AC-300 can be used in quality decorative or industrial
finishes.

It is ideal for use in interior household paints where non-yellowing
and humidity resistance are of paramount importance e.g. kitchens and
bathrooms.

Also, its exterior durability, fast dry and early water resistance make
it a good choice for exterior maintenance or agricultural machinery
coatings.

Blending Crodaplast AC-300 with other novel materials from Croda offers
the formulator even more interesting possibilities.

Highly flexible, long life coatings for wood (both interior and
exterior) can be formulated by blending with Crodapol 0-78, a
flexibilising material.

High solids (low VOC) air-drying coatings are produced when Croda
Dilulin is used as a reactive diluent.

Nagoya, Japan.

The steel vessel is designed to operate for 20 years without
dry-docking.

Chevron Nigeria and its joint venture partner, the Nigerian National
Petroleum Corp (NNPC), initiated the Escravos Gas Project to reduce gas
flaring and recover the gas and condensate from the company's offshore
oil production, which is at its current peak production of 405,000
barrels/day.

Under the project the gas will be pumped to an onshore gas processing
plant.

Once there, three products will be produced: condenstate for blending
with exported crude oil, natural gas for distribution within Nigeria,
and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) for export from the new FSO vessel.

The FSO will chill, de-pressurize, and store the LPG for export on LPG
tankers.

Lonza to build isophathalic acid plant in Singapore

from CHEMICAL BUSINESS NEWSBASE, 12 Nov 1996

Ref: Press Release,  7 Nov 1996, 2 pp

The Lonza Group's Polymers and Additives Business Unit is to build a
70,000 tons/y purified isophthalic acid plant in Singapore.

The total capital investment for the plant will amount to approx $125
M.

The project will be a joint venture, with Lonza contributing 80% and
the Economic Development Board of Singapore (governmental agency for
the promotion of foreign investments) the remaining 20%.

The plant is scheduled to come on stream at the end of 1998.

The new production site will be located on the Island of Pulau Sakra,
west of Singapore's central business district, and have a total size of
75,000 sq m including land reserves for future projects.

Isophthalic acid is a plastic intermediate used in the manufacture of
unsaturated polyesters resins and environmentally friendly,
water-based, solvent-free coatings and paints as well as
polyethyleneterephthalate (PET) bottle-grade resins.

A number of further applications are still in the development phase.

The manufacturing process used in the new plant is based on a
proprietary liquid phase oxidation technology developed by Lonza.

A similar process has been successfully utilized at Lonza's trimellitic
anhydride production unit in Italy.

The isophthalic acid production will be backwards integrated, with a
separation unit that will produce the starting material from mixed
xylenes widely available from the local petrochemical refineries.

The realization of the isophthalic acid plant will enable Lonza to
broaden its product range, to particpate in the fast growing
Asian-Pacific market and to strengthen its position as a leading
manufacturer of plastic intermediates.

H. Pylori test to all physicians without government limitation

Quidel Corp has announced receipt of "waived categorization" for its
QuickVue One-Step H.

Pylori Test under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendment of
1988.

The QuickVue product is the first H. pylori test to receive such
categorization from the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC).

The CDC classifies a product as waived if it is accurate and easy to
use.

Waived categorization enables the product to be sold to all physicians.

H. pylori is the bacterium that causes most stomach ulcers and is
strongly believed to be associated with the development of stomach
cancer.

Once an H. pylori infection is detected, antibiotic therapy is
administered to kill the organism and promote a cure of the ulcer
condition.

Quidel was first to introduce a rapid diagnostic test that detects H.
pylori.

The QuickVue One-Step H.

Pylori Test is the world's first non-invasive, one-step, blood test
that provides immediate and accurate diagnosis in minutes from a
finger-stick.

"With waived-testing status for H. pylori, we have an additional sales
opportunity with those doctors who are not certified to perform more
complex tests, and until now, could not provide H. pylori testing for
their patients," said Steven T Frankel, Quidel President and Chief
Executive Officer.

"Our QuickVue test gives these 'waived-only' sites, representing about
one-third of all doctors' office practices, direct control over the
testing and treatment of their patients during a single office visit."

Gist-brocades enters a new market sector: lovastatin

from CHEMICAL BUSINESS NEWSBASE, 12 Nov 1996

Ref: The Gist, Autumn 1996, No. 66, Pg. 15-16

Recently, it was announced that Gist-brocades is going to produce
lovastatin.

Lovastatin is a cholesterol-reducing drug which is still protected by
patents, but this protection will expire in the coming years.

Worldwide, there is a great demand for cholesterol-reducing drugs and
since lovastatin can be produced by fermentation, Gist-brocades is
interested in adding this product to its portfolio.

The worldwide annual turnover in cholesterol-reducing products amounts
to more than $5 bn and still shows a healthy growth.

This is particularly so for the 'statins'.

In 1995 demand grew by 24%.

Lovastatin is marketed by Merck, Sharpe and Dohme.

World sales of lovastatin (brand name Mevacor) were $1.26 bn in 1995.

The main market is the USA, where patent protection for lovastatin
expires in 2001.

Since Gist-brocades wants to carve its own position in the generics
market, it has been decided to make this product.

The position of the company will be that of a supplier of bulk actives.

Gist-brocades has a dedicated lovastatin plant under construction that
will comply with cGMP production.

Production will commence early in 1997.
