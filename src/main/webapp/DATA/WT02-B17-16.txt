<h2>SCIENCE  & TECHNOLOGY REPORT:<br> Hydrogen Report Stresses 
Demonstration Projects</H2>
<P>
The Department of Energy's Hydrogen Technical Advisory Panel (HTAP) 
recently 
released its 1995 progress report, titled 'The Green Hydrogen Report.'  
HTAP was 
established in 1992 to advise the Secretary of Energy on present and 
future 
hydrogen opportunities in the United States.
<P>
Among the recommendations outlined in the 1995 report, HTAP has suggested 
the 
development of demonstration programs involving hydrogen-based surface 
transportation applications.
<P>
Foremost among the demonstration programs would be a 10-bus demonstration 

'on a highly visible route in a region where there is a major market for 
low-emission 
vehicles.'
<P>
The panel noted that emission-free buses would make significant 
contributions to 
improvements in clean air quality on a per vehicle basis, and that the 
proposed 
demonstration should serve as a starting point in the development of 
technologies 
that would have potential for application in the private motor vehicle 
market.
<p>
The panel report suggested that the Department of Energy should 
contribute 
approximately $21 million to the bus demonstration program through 2000.
<P>
The total budget for the demonstration would also include significant 
cost-sharing 
with stakeholder institutions.
<P>
In addition, the panel report suggested the establishment of a design for 
a light-duty 
vehicle utilizing hydrogen and for the production of a limited number of 
these 
vehicles.  These light-duty vehicles would be tested under fleet 
conditions.
