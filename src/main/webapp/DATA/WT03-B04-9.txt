from CHINA BUSINESS INFORMATION NETWORK (CBnet), Sep. 25, 1996

China is willing to further enhance its traditional friendship and
cooperation with Ethiopia, Chinese Vice-Premier Qian Qichen said in New
York Monday.

Qian, also Chinese foreign minister, made the remarks during a meeting
with his Ethiopian counterpart, Seyoum Mesfin, at the United Nations
headquarters.

Qian noted the smooth development of relations and successful
cooperation in various fields between China and Ethiopia.

He said the successful visit by Chinese President Jiang Zemin to
Ethiopia in May and the China-tour by Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles
Zenawi last year have laid a strong foundation to the all-round
development of the bilateral ties.

Qian appreciated Ethiopia's "one China" policy and the support to China
on the issue of human rights.

He also appreciated Ethiopia's contributions in the African and
regional affairs.

Seyoum agreed with Qian's views on the bilateral ties and added that
Ethiopia was satisfied with the growth of friendly ties between the two
countries.

He affirmed China's constructive role in the international and regional
affairs and said China has a special position in Africa.

Seyoum introduced to Qian Africa's situation and the African nations'
efforts in resolving regional problems.

Qian expressed China's satisfaction over African people's progress in
their development and said China hopes that related regions in Africa
could, through dialogues, reduce their differences, eliminate the root
of instability and maintain stability so as to achieve development,"
said the Chinese leader.

China: Paris symposium to look at China"s policy on foreign investment

from CHINA BUSINESS INFORMATION NETWORK (CBnet), Sep. 25, 1996

A symposium on China's foreign investment policy, sponsored by the
Chinese Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Co-operation (MOFTEC),
opened in Paris on Monday.

Chen Xinhua, deputy minister of MOFTEC, briefed French participants on
the economic situation and foreign investment in China in his keynote
speech at the opening ceremony.

"Foreign funded enterprises have actually invested a total of 155
billion U.S. dollars in China and the majority of joint ventures and
solely foreign funded enterprises are well managed," Chen said.

With the continuous growth of Sino-French economic and trade relations
in recent years, France had become the fourth largest European investor
in China, he said.

Yves Galland, minister delegate to the French Ministry of Economy and
Finance in charge of finance and foreign trade, said developing
relations with China was a priority of the French government.

France was determined to seize the "huge opportunity" of the Chinese
market, he said.

France encouraged its businessmen to invest in China, because China had
created sound conditions for foreign investment, he said. He noted that
China had brought inflation under control while ensuring the continuous
and fast expansion of the economy.

Galland said China's foreign currency reserves and the purchasing power
of its consumers were quickly increasing.

He hoped the Chinese side would do a better job in helping foreign
enterprises obtain more accurate market information in China and learn
more about the Chinese laws and regulations.

More than 170 delegates from China's provinces attended the symposium.
They brought with them a long list of 640 projects that are open to
foreign investment.

China: Hi-tech industry leads in Yantai"s economy: official

from CHINA BUSINESS INFORMATION NETWORK (CBnet), Sep. 25, 1996

Hi-tech industry in China's port city Yantai has become a leader in the
local economy, a government official there said recently.

Yantai, in east China's Shandong Province, has established 406
enterprises that develop or manufacture hi-tech products, accounting
for a quarter of the city's total.

Hi-tech enterprises generated a total output value of 6.2 billion yuan
(about 747 million US dollars) and 1.6 billion yuan ($192 million) in
taxes and profits last year.

In recent years, Yantai has implemented the strategy of "invigorating
the city's economy through science and technology," and has given
favorable treatment to hi-tech enterprises in land use, funding, power
supply and intelligence.

Large state-owned enterprises have pioneered the development of hi-tech
industries. The city has selected 100 enterprises to upgrade
traditional industries and old products.

The Yantai Wanhua Synthetic Leather Group Company has broken the
monopoly of foreign technology in the development of high-grade
imitation synthetic leather.

By keeping up-to-date with the latest global developments in
technology, the Polaris Clock Corporation has become the largest clock
company in China.

Technology-intensive joint ventures have also sprung up in the city.
Most of the 150 projects boast state-of-the-art technology, the
official said.

Yantai presently has one of the four largest manufacturing bases of
transparent electric conduction glass in the world, which was formed in
cooperation with an American company.

By cooperating with another US company, the city has produced a special
sealing gum, which satisfies 90 per cent of the demand of the country's
market.

Yantai has also cooperated with a Japanese company for the production
of automobile air conditioners. The city also joined hands with a
company from the Republic of Korea to make excavators, a project that
is expected to generate an output value of one billion US dollars
annually.

Township enterprises also play an active role in the development of
hi-tech products. Household appliances developed by the Hongxiang
Company sells well in the overseas market. Last year, the company
turned out a production volume of 1.3 billion yuan ($156 million).  And
Zhichu Group, a village-run company, has developed 28 hi-tech products.

The city has set up 450 hi-tech industries, covering the fields of
electronic information, integration of machinery and electronics, new
materials, bio-engineering, mechanics, medicine, and household
appliances.

Shanghai to develop environmental protection into a pillar sector

from CHINA BUSINESS INFORMATION NETWORK (CBnet), Sep. 25, 1996

As Shanghai tries to simultaneously improve its economy and
environment, experts in both fields predict that the environmental
protection industry will become one of the city's pillar sectors early
next century.

The Shanghai Municipal Government is encouraging big State-owned
enterprises to enter this market, which has been expanding due to the
launching of many large environmental projects, such as the sewage
treatment and water diversion project on the Yangtze River, a report by
the local Business News said.

During the Ninth Five Year Plan (1996-2000) period, Shanghai's
investment in environmental protection will total 48 billion yuan ($5.8
billion). Investment in the field in the whole country will be 189
billion yuan ($23 billion), according to the report.

In contrast to the market's potential, Shanghai's environmental
protection industry is relatively underdeveloped.

There are about 600 firms in the field, employing 40,000 people, and
industrial output last year was 1.5 billion yuan ($180 million),
according to the Shanghai Bureau of Environmental Protection.

Market enthusiasm is on the rise. Multinational companies, as well as
firms in other provinces in China, are planning to enter the Shanghai
market, and local companies, not willing to be left behind, are also
considering investment options.

Shanghai Environmental Protection Machinery & Engineering Co is one of
them.

The company's core business, Shanghai Metallurgical & Mine Machinery
Plant, is one of the earliest firms in China to produce environmental
protection machinery for dust cleaning, desulfurization, water and
garbage treatment.

The company has acquired long term, interest-free loans from the
overseas capital market and a 70-million-yuan ($8.4 million) loan from
Chinese banks for expansion, the report said.

China: Shenzhen to separate government organs from market agencies

from CHINA BUSINESS INFORMATION NETWORK (CBnet), Sep. 25, 1996

All market go-between organizations in special economic zone Shenzhen,
are to be separated from government institutions in a campaign to
rectify market order.

Also as part of the effort government employees will not be allowed to
be involved as market agents.

As a pioneer for China's socialist market economy, Shenzhen
neighbouring Hong Kong, now boasts over 3,300 market go-between
organizations, employing over 35,000 people, latest statistics show.

While playing an increasingly important role in bridging ties between
the market with enterprises and the government, problems have been
found among as well as the malpractice of taking advantage of
government ties, resulting in unfair competition.

In its determination to maintain market order, the municipal government
has decided to carry out an over-all check on the go-between market,
covering job introductions, real estate dealing, assets assessment, and
law firms.

Existing relevant rules and regulations will also be subject to
re-examination.

China: FM spokesman warns Japan not to cause ""new incident""

from CHINA BUSINESS INFORMATION NETWORK (CBnet), Sep. 25, 1996

Japan should understand that the Chinese people's determination to
defend China's State sovereignty and territorial integrity is
unshakable, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said Tuesday in Beijing.

Spokesman Shen Guofang warned Japan to be fully aware of the
seriousness of the matter and not to provoke any new incidents.

His remarks came in response to the report that Japanese coast guard
and police vessels expelled Hong Kong vessels which tried to approach
the Diaoyu Islands.

Japan has created disturbances continuously on the Diaoyu Islands
issue, seriously infringing upon China's sovereignty and territorial
integrity, Shen said.

This of course arouses strong indignation among the entire Chinese
people, including compatriots of Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan, he said.

When asked to comment on Japanese Foreign Minister Yukihiko Ikeda's
claim at the UN General Assembly of the United Nations that the islands
are Japan's territory, Shen said that China's position on this issue
has never changed.

It is indisputable that the Diaoyu Islands and its adjacent islands are
an inalienable part of China, he said.

He urged Japan to take steps to stop activities which infringe on
China's sovereignty and said that Japan is responsible to make sure
that no new incidents will take place.

Referring to Australian Prime Minister John Howard's upcoming meeting
with the Dalai Lama on coming Thursday, Shen reiterated that this
constitutes an interference into China's internal affairs.

Whatever the outcome, a shadow will surely be casted over bilateral
relations, Shen said.

China has made many representations with the Australian government and
hopes that it will take a correct attitude, he said.

Commenting on the report that Taiwanese leader Lee Teng-hui has asked
to hold talks with Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, Shen said
Asian-Pacific countries have conducted fruitful dialogues on security
issues, which can only be held among sovereignty countries.

Taiwan, which is part of China, is not at all qualified to take part in
such activities, Shen said.

Also at the briefing, Shen said that, looking back at history, the
country which had constituted a threat to the Asia-Pacific region was
none other than Japan.

"Peace in the Asia-Pacific region should be maintained by this region's
countries and peoples," Shen said.

These remarks were made when Shen was asked to comment on the
US-Japanese security communique released last week.

He said if this agreement, which is a bilateral arrangement, exceeds
bilateral range and is aimed against a third country or involves other
countries' interests, complications will result in the development of
the matter.

He expressed the hope that Japan will have a clear understanding of the
issue.

China welcomes US investors and traders: Vice Premier

from CHINA BUSINESS INFORMATION NETWORK (CBnet), Sep. 25, 1996

Chinese Vice-Premier Li Lanqing yesterday told the Illinois State Trade
Delegation, headed by Governor Jim Edgar, that China welcomes American
companies to invest in the country and conduct trade here.

China welcomes investment in China from big businesses, such as
Motorola, as well as cooperation with small and medium-sized
enterprises, Li said in a meeting yesterday afternoon with the group.

According to Li, the economies of China and the US are complementary,
and show great potential for economic cooperation.

He said he hopes the two sides will work more closely with each other
to fully explore their opportunities.

The vice-premier stressed that only when the two countries respect
dissimilarities in each other's culture and history can cooperation be
effective.

Edgar echoed Li's views by saying that differences in political
opinions should not influence economic cooperation. In fact, he said,
the establishment of stronger trade ties between US and China might
help solve political issues.

Li also briefed the US guests on China's major areas for foreign
investment. He said he believes that the forthcoming visit by Wu Yi,
minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, to the Unites
States will enhance trade ties between the two countries.

China: Song Jian emphasizes on environmental protection

from CHINA BUSINESS INFORMATION NETWORK (CBnet), Sep. 25, 1996

Environmental protection is the key to sustainable development, said
State Councillor Song Jian in Beijing Tuesday.

Speaking at the fifth meeting of the China Council for International
Cooperation on Environment and Development, Song said China, as a
developing country, is always burdened with economic development and
environmental protection issues.

In order to realize the sustained, rapid and healthy development of the
national economy, China should solve both the environmental pollution
problems that have been left over from past, as well as the new
environmental problems that crop up in the process of development.

The council is a non-governmental advisory body consisting of Chinese
government officials, internationally-recognized figures, high-ranking
foreign officials, noted experts and professors. Suggestions made by
the council have been well received by the Chinese government.

Song said that people have reached a common understanding of the
importance of sustainable development, and that planning of economic
development must be done in connection with population, resources and
environment.

He said that China has made significant progress in the protection of
environment, but the country's environmental situation is still grim:
environmental pollution, especially in cities, continues to be
aggravating, and the areas suffering from ecological destruction are
expanding.

In some areas, environmental pollution and ecological damage have
obstructed the healthy development of the economy, and even pose direct
threats to people's health, he added.

Song said that at present, environmental protection should focus on
dealing with the comprehensive relationship between environment and
development, legal construction, expanding financial resources,
increasing input, using science and technology, expanding international
cooperation and implementing international conventions on environment.

China among 1st to sign Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty

from CHINA BUSINESS INFORMATION NETWORK (CBnet), Sep. 25, 1996

China was among the first countries to sign the Comprehensive Test Ban
Treaty (CTBT) at the United Nations headquarters this morning.

Chinese Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, representing
China, signed the treaty.

Also among the first group to sign the treaty were the United States,
France, Russia and Britain.

U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali said in a key note speech
before the signing of the treaty that it was "a major milestone" that
has been reached on the road to making the world a safer and more
secure place for generations to come.

In a statement on the occasion, the Chinese government declared that
China has all along stood for the complete prohibition and thorough
destruction of nuclear weapons and the realization of a
nuclear-weapon-free world.

The statement said that it is in favor of a comprehensive ban on
nuclear weapon test explosions in the process towards this objective.
The Chinese government is deeply convinced that the CTBT will
facilitate nuclear disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation, it added.

Therefore, it said, "China supports the conclusion, through
negotiation, of a fair, reasonable and verifiable treaty with universal
adherence and unlimited duration and is ready to take active measures
to promote its ratification and entry into force."

Meanwhile, the Chinese government appealed that major nuclear weapon
states should abandon their policy of nuclear deterrence. States with
huge arsenals should continue to drastically reduce their nuclear
stockpiles, it said.

The statement said, "All countries that have deployed nuclear weapons
on foreign soil should withdraw all of them to their own land. All
nuclear weapon states should undertake not to be the first to use
nuclear weapons at any time and under any circumstance, commit
themselves unconditionally to the non-use or threat of use of nuclear
weapons against non-nuclear weapon states or nuclear-weapon-free zones,
and conclude, at an early date, international legal instruments to this
effect."

China called on all nuclear weapon states to pledge their support to
proposals for the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones, respect
their status as such and undertake corresponding obligations.

The statement said no country should develop or deploy space weapon
systems or missile defense systems undermining strategic security and
stability.

And an international convention on the complete prohibition and
thorough destruction of nuclear weapons should be concluded through
negotiations, it added.

The statement said that the Chinese government endorses the application
of verification measures consistent with the provisions of the CTBT to
ensure its faithful implementation and at the same time it firmly
opposes the abuse of verification rights by any country, including the
use of espionage or human intelligence, to infringe upon the
sovereignty of other countries and impair their legitimate security
interests in violation of universally recognized principles of
international law.

It said that in the present day world where huge nuclear arsenals and
nuclear deterrence policy based on the first use of nuclear weapons
still exist, the supreme national interests of China demand that it
ensure the safety, reliability and effectiveness of its nuclear weapons
before the goal of eliminating all nuclear weapons is achieved.

China: High-tech code system developed to combat fake goods

from CHINA BUSINESS INFORMATION NETWORK (CBnet), Sep. 25, 1996

A high-tech system that uses secret codes to combat fake goods in China
is to go national after a successful trial operation.

The system, invented by Chinese experts, uses a telephone network and
electronic codes to identify genuine articles. A national work
conference held in Haikou of Hainan Province to discuss the system has
been told it is to be spread nationwide after been proved successful.

Its trial operation in parts of the country since January this year
received positive response from users.

China Anti-Fakes Association is entrusted by the State Bureau of
Technical Supervision to popularize it throughout the country.

Hainan Tenglong Anti-Fake Technology Company, which is based in Haikou,
capital of Hainan in South China, is responsible for implementing the
project.

The system, based on computerized data banks and the national
computerized telephone information retrieval network, will provide
manufacturers of quality products with special data codes and secret
codes.

Commodity dealers or buyers can check up the goods they have purchased
by telephone, after tearing off the cover on the codes.

Since it is a hi-tech system, it is impossible for anyone to produce
fake codes, according to experts.

The Hainan-based company has invested 40 million yuan ($4.8 million) to
set up a data bank capable of holding 50 billion different electronic
codes. Terminals will be built in major cities across the country.

Some experts say the network will help protect quality and brand-famed
products in the country.

China: Nujiang River Canyon gains growing popularity among tourists

from CHINA BUSINESS INFORMATION NETWORK (CBnet), Sep. 25, 1996

China's Nujiang River Canyon, known as the "Grand Canyon of the Orient"
 has become a hot tourist attraction as increasing travelers and
adventurers swarm in.

Located in the west of Yunnan Province, southwest China, the Nujiang
River Canyon is grand and steep because of the swift Nujiang River, the
perilous Biluo Mountain and the Gaoligong Mountain on each bank of the
river.

The Yunnan section of the Nujiang River Canyon is 621 kilometers long
and 3,000 meters deep, as compared with the Grand Canyon in Colorado
which is 440 kilometers long and 1,839 meters deep.

Tourists visiting the Nujiang Grand Canyon can not only see the canyon
itself, but can also be exposed to the rich ethnic culture and folklore
of the local Lisu, Bai, Nu, Dulong, Jingpo and Tibetan ethnic groups.

The primeval forests, waterfalls and rivers are also tourist
highlights.

Thanks to modern highways, it takes 10 hours for tourists to get to the
canyon from Kunming, the provincial capital.

Last year, over 194,000 Chinese and overseas tourists visited the
canyon.

Shanghai to import German escalators for Metro Line No. 2

from CHINA BUSINESS INFORMATION NETWORK (CBnet), Sep. 25, 1996

Shanghai Metro Corp and a German firm have agreed to import 120
escalators for the first phase of the city's Metro Line No 2, which is
scheduled to be completed in 1999.

The 120 computer-controlled heavy-duty escalators cost 24.5 million
Deutsche marks ($16 million) and will be designed and manufactured by
Otis Escalator Factory in Stadthagen, Germany.

These escalators will be installed by Shanghai Otis Elevator Corp in 10
subway stations -- four West Shanghai and six in Pudong (East
Shanghai), said an official from the company.

The 3-year-old Shanghai Otis has installed numerous state-of-the-art,
computer-controlled elevators in major projects throughout Shanghai,
including the Oriental Pearl TV Tower.

The escalators for the Metro project will begin arriving in April, the
official said.

Germany will also provide four escalators for the extension of Metro
Line No 1 from Jinjiang Amusement Park to Xinzhuang.

The extension will open at the end of the year, said Chen Mingtu, chief
of the Foreign Economic Division under Shanghai Metro Co.

This is the second project by Otis for Shanghai metros, the Otis
official said, adding that Otis installed 48 heavy-duty escalators for
Metro Line No 1.

Chen said the metro company will soon sign a contract with the United
States to import subway ticket machines worth $24 million. The machines
will be installed on Metro Lines No 1 and No 2.

The city borrowed $50 million from the United States Government to
import subway ticket machines, signal and anti-fire systems.

The city also will import 210 carriages. Most will be for the first
phase of the second subway, and 16 will be used on Metro Line No 1 to
increase the frequency of train trips from every seven minutes to every
five minutes.

from CHINA BUSINESS INFORMATION NETWORK (CBnet), Sep. 25, 1996

China's Ministry of Machinery plans to finance the technological
upgrading projects of major machine-building plants in northeast of the
country.

The aim is to boost the growth of an important sector that employs a
quarter of all the area's workers.

The companies to receive government assistance will include
manufacturers of power generation, transformers and transmission
facilities, lathe-builders and suppliers of important fittings and
parts in the bearing industry.

The funding will also be granted to manufacturers of light and heavy
automotives, according to Deputy Minister Sun Changji, who was recently
interviewed by reporter in Liaoning coastal city Dalian.

According to the official, 104 such projects have been approved by the

China: Qian Qichen urges EU to support China"s entry into WTO

from CHINA BUSINESS INFORMATION NETWORK (CBnet), Sep. 25, 1996

Chinese Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qicheng Monday urged the
European Union to take more active steps to support China's efforts in
entering the World Trade Organization.

He made this remark during his meeting with his counterpart of the
European Union in New York.

Qian pointed out that in recent years the overall relationship between
China and EU is developing in a good direction.

He said China values the important role the EU and its members are
playing in the international affairs and wishes to develop friendly and
co-operative relationship with them.

On economic and trade relations, Qian said there is great potential for
development since the two sides are economically complementary.

He said China will continue the process of opening up to the outside
world and liberalizing its trade practices.

He called upon the EU countries to take more positive steps in
eliminating protective trade barriers against Chinese products and to
take positive and concrete measures on the questions of China's entry
into the World Trade Organization.

Irish Foreign Minister Dick Spring, the current EU president, told Qian
that EU is determined in pursuing the long-term policy of developing
strategic relationship with China.

Noting the dialogue between China and EU has already had a good
beginning, Dick said that the EU is willing to continue such a dialogue
so as to enhance understanding and reduce differences.

Spring told Qian that the EU supports China's entry into the World
Trade Organization, hoping the question can be solved on an equal and
just base.

On the human rights issue, Qian reaffirmed China's consistent policy
that is to carry out dialogues with other countries on the basis of
equality and mutual respect.

China believes that dialogues and confrontation cannot be mixed
together. If any country wishes to seek dialogues with China, it should
discard the stance of confrontation, he added.

On behalf of the European Union, Hans Van Mierlo expressed his
gratitude for the flexibility and constructive spirit China had
demonstrated in the negotiations for settling the Comprehensive Test
Ban Treaty (CTBT). He said China had made important contribution to the
successful adoption of the treaty earlier this months.

The Chinese vice-premier said that China had been actively involved in
the CTBT negotiations, holding that it would be the first step taken
toward the final target of a comprehensive ban and complete destruction
of nuclear weapons. He said the international community should continue
its efforts in this regard.

China: No 1 Department Store wins top int"l laurels

from CHINA BUSINESS INFORMATION NETWORK (CBnet), Sep. 25, 1996

Shanghai No 1 Department Store, one of the most prestigious department
stores in the city, has become the first retailer in the country to win
the ISO9002, an international award for management and service.

The International Standard Organization gives the certificate to
businesses which it considers are among the best in the world.

``As Shanghai opens its retail markets, the competition grows keener.
The advent of foreign retailers has put our traditional management and
service under challenge,'' Zhang Yinqi, general manager of the store
said at the award ceremony held recently.

``Although we are experienced in the retail sector, we are in need of
modernization. So we decided to commit ourselves to setting up a
quality management and guarantee system in line with international
standards,'' said Zhang.

Founded in October 1949, the Shanghai No 1 Department Store is one of
the leaders in the world of commerce in China. Its seven-story shopping
facility at a premier location on bustling Nanjing Road, along with a
number of branch stores in and out of the city, chalked up sales of
2.33 billion yuan ($280.7 million) and a profit of 123 million yuan
($14.8 million) in 1995. For 11 years in a row, it was the country's
busiest store in terms of sales.

For the first half of 1996, it registered sales of 1.22 billion yuan
($147 million), up 12.9 per cent over a year earlier.

The preparation for ISO9002 accreditation was initiated in December
1994 at the store. The store got all of its senior and middle-level
staff re-trained and worked out a series of quality management
regulations.

According to Zhang, customers shopping at the No 1 Department Store are
guaranteed with satisfaction. One area where the store should win good
response is its policy of offering refunds or exchanges on bought
goods.

``Rather than resting on its laurels, the No 1 Department Store will
seek further expansion and make itself a world-famous shopping
paradise.'' Zhang said.

China: 50 reporters granted awards for fighting copyright piracy

from CHINA BUSINESS INFORMATION NETWORK (CBnet), Sep. 25, 1996

China's State Copyright Administration yesterday rewarded 50 reporters
who have helped fight copyright piracy over the past few years.

The reporters work for Xinhua News Agency, "The People's Daily", China
Central Television, and many other news organizations throughout the
country.

"Mass media is playing a major role in promoting people's awareness of
copyright protection," said Yu Youxian, director of the administration.

He said that the Chinese media has published tens of thousands of
stories to demonstrate the significance of copyright protection and
spread information in this regard.

Many people reported copyright cases to the authorities after reading
newspapers, according to Shen Rengan, deputy director of the
administration. He added that it was unusual for a country to mobilize
all its public sectors, including the media, to engage in the fight
against copyright piracy.

Yu Youxian explained that the improvement of people's legal sense by
making use of the media has become a basic guarantee to implement the
copyright law.

The prize-winning stories themselves are a showcase that China has
achieved great progress in protecting copyright, he noted.

He cited some articles, including one describing how farmers become
familiar with the copyright law, one about the Walt Disney's case in
Beijing, and another on copyright protection in a fast food restaurant.

Some reporters lashed the US for its unfair charge that China violated
foreign copyrights. One journalist even told a story about a senior
Chinese copyright official whose works were pirated in the US without
authorization.

China: Shanxi plans to harness half of its soil erosion by year 2000

from CHINA BUSINESS INFORMATION NETWORK (CBnet), Sep. 25, 1996

North China's Shanxi Province plans to harness 50 per cent of its soil
erosion area by the year 2000.

Thanks to years of efforts to harness the Loess Plateau, Shanxi has so
far contained 51 million mu (3.06 million hectares), or 32 per cent of
its total eroded area.

Shanxi, located near the middle reaches of the Yellow River, occupies a
large part of the Loess Plateau. Soil erosion area accounts for 70 per
cent of its total 156,000 square kilometer of ground.

In the late 1970s, the annual amount of sand washed into the Yellow
River stood at 366 million tons -- one-fourth of the river's total.

A large-scale campaign to harness the Loess Plateau first began in the
1980s. Over the following several years, 350,000 local rural households
participated in the drive.

By planting grass, trees and crops, and building dams and terraced
farmland, the residents revived hundreds of thousands of barren
gullies.

Meanwhile, the central government and the Shanxi provincial government
also worked to prevent the spread of erosion in the Loess Plateau.

The central government has invested 75 million yuan to tackle erosion
of the banks of the Sanchuan River and Yongding River, two large rivers
on the plateau. Eroded areas which have been controlled there account
for 40 percent of the total drainage area of the two rivers.

A total of 150 million yuan ($18 million) has been used in harnessing
the upper reaches of the Fenhe River, the second largest tributary of
the Yellow River.

Erosion-harnessing projects were carried out on an area of 1.95 million
mu (117,000 hectares) there. In the region, grain output increased by
50 percent, farmers' income rose two-fold, and the volume of sand which
washed into reservoirs was reduced by 49 per cent.

China: Multi-billion yuan petrochemical project planned for Qaidam Basin

from CHINA BUSINESS INFORMATION NETWORK (CBnet), Sep. n 1996

China is to build a 4.3 billion yuan ($510 million) petrochemical
project in the Qaidam Basin, Northwest China's Qinghai Province.

This was disclosed by Zhou Yongkang, deputy general manager of the
China National Petroleum Corporation.

Zhou explained that during the current Ninth Five-Year Plan Period
(1996-2000), the country will carry out large-scale exploitation of the
natural gas reserves in the Qaidam Basin. The construction of the
project is aimed at promoting the economic development of the
Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.

He added that according to an initial plan, the project will have a
designed annual production capacity of 120,000 tons of polyvinyl
chloride, 100,000 tons of caustic soda, 200,000 tons of synthetic
ammonia and 350,000 tons of urea.

Zhou said that the project had already passed assessment and appraisal
from China International Consultancy Company, and his corporation has
been negotiating over the investment possibility with US company, Amoco
Petroleum.

Qaidam Basin has an area of 240,000 square kilometers, equivalent to
the size of Great Britain, and it is also one of China's four major
basins.

China has discovered 22 oilfields in the Qaidam Basin after more than
four decades of prospecting.  Of the 22 oilfields, six fields, with
combined natural gas reserves of 54.1 billion cubic meters, boast sound
conditions for full-scale development.

In another development, the installation of a 189 km pipeline from
Sebei Oilfield to Golmud City, also located in the basin, which will
form part of the new petrochemical project, has just been finished.

A 16,000-kilowattt power station using natural gas as fuel has also
been built.

for the next 20 years. When the contract expires, the Hong Kong company
will return the shares to the provincial Power Construction Investment
and Development Corporation.

This is the largest overseas-funded project in the province and also
the first of its kind in the country's power sector.

Beijing plans expansion of overseas labor service

from CHINA BUSINESS INFORMATION NETWORK (CBnet), Sep. 25, 1996

Beijing plans to send thousands of experts and skilled people to other
countries as part of a 15-year plan to boost its share of overseas
contracts.

The city has announced an expansion of its overseas labor services and
construction co-operation, with an increase of 10 to 15 per cent
annually, a top municipal official said.

He said by the year 2000, the total turnover of overseas labor services
is expected to reach up to $600 million US dollars, and by $1.4 billion
US dollars by the year 2010.

A number of effective measures are to be taken to achieve the goal,
said Yi Xiqun, director of the Beijing Municipal Foreign Trade
Commission. The most important is to extend overseas contracts and
labor services in accordance with international standards.

By the end of 1995, Beijing had signed contracts for overseas projects
and labor services totalling $2.57 billion US dollar, with a turnover
of $1.13 billion US dollars.

More than 20,000 doctors, scientists and engineers have been sent to
over 50 countries and regions around the world, the official said.

A total 11 enterprises in the city have now been licensed to enjoy the
right to sign overseas contracts for labor services.

Among them, the Beijing Urban and Rural Construction Group Corp is the
biggest, he said.

Last year, the city signed contracts for overseas cooperative projects
and labor services worth $780 million US dollars, earning millions of
dollars in profits for China.

China: Hebei focuses on airport development

from CHINA BUSINESS INFORMATION NETWORK (CBnet), Sep. 25, 1996

North China's Hubei Province is embracing a rapid developing aviation
industry, according to a report from Shijiazhuang, the provincial
capital.

Until recently the province saw a slow development in aviation
transport, only starting its first civilian flight in 1984.

But since last year the province has stepped up development of air
travel with the opening of Shijiazhuang Airport. The airport is listed
as one of the alternative airports for Beijing Capital International
Airport.

According to provincial aviation officials, Hebei has opened 17
domestic air routes linking the province with 19 major Chinese cities,
and also an air route to Hong Kong.

By the end of October, Shijiazhuang Airport will open four more
domestic air routes to Kunming, Nanjing, Xiamen and Qingdao, and
chartered flights to Russia are expected to begin later this year.

Situated not far from Beijing and Tianjin, two largest cities in the
country, Hebei is one of the major agriculture production bases and
rich in mineral and tourism resources.

By the end of this century, Hubei will transform Shijiazhuang Airport
into an international airport and build or expand four other major
airports in the province.

China: Hong Kong: big player in overseas investment

from CHINA BUSINESS INFORMATION NETWORK (CBnet), Sep. 25, 1996

Hong Kong has become the single largest outward investor among Asian
developing economies, according to the 1996 issue of the World
Investment Report, which says the outflows of Foreign Direct Investment
(FDI) from the region amounted to $25 billion US dollars last year.

A good part of the outflows goes into China, says the report released
yesterday in Geneva by the United Nations Conference on Trade and
Development (UNCTAD).

The inflows of FDI into Hong Kong, $2.1 billion US dollars in 1995,
fall far short of the outflows.

"It does not imply a loss of confidence in Hong Kong," said Professor
Edward K.Y. Chen, President of Lingnan College at a news conference in
Hong Kong yesterday, who gave a general introduction to the annual
report, the fifth published by UNCTAD since 1992.

In his view, the figures simply reflect normal commercial activities to
rationalize production and accumulate wealth. Hong Kong is a funding
center which draws money from other places of the world and then pours
into China, so the big outflows are not all from Hong Kong investors,
said Chen.

Touching on Hong Kong after 1997, the reports says the city should
continue to be a separate customs territory and an independent member
of the World Trade Organization (WTO). According to Chen, there is good
evidence that the whole world has confidence in Hong Kong so long as it
maintains the current economic independence as stipulated in the Basic
Law, the de facto constitution of the future Special Administrative
Region.

UNCTAD plays an important role in promoting trade and investment
throughout the world.
