<FONT SIZE=+1><STRONG>Retiring Parents: Are they
prepared?</STRONG></FONT><P>

Many people face their parents' retirement and aging without a second thought,
assuming that
Mom
and Dad are in good financial shape and ready for the golden years.  Making this
assumption
can be a
serious mistake.  You and your folks may think they are adequately prepared for
retirement,
but how far
down the road have they looked?  
<P>
With average life expectancy increasing, it's not uncommon for people to live 10 to
20 years,
or longer,
after retiring.  A great deal can happen in that time, and life's events don't
always work
out as planned. 
Culprits such as inflation and illness can wipe out a nest egg and undermine the
financial
independence of even the best-prepared retiree.  
<P>
<STRONG>Inflation and Illness Can Turn a Nest Egg into a Goose Egg</STRONG><BR>
Inflation can seriously erode money's purchasing power over time.  Even with a low
inflation
rate of 4%,
retirees at age 60 with an income of $2,500/month will have the purchasing power of
$1,388/month by
the time they're 75 years old.  In other words, the standard of living will be
virtually
halved in just 15
years.  Many retirees today find themselves searching for part-time jobs, in order
to keep up
with the
rising cost of living.  But no one can work forever.  And, in mere months, major
illness can
wipe out a
nest egg that took years to build.
<P>
According to the Abstract of the United States, 45% of an individual's lifetime
medical
expenses are
incurred during a final illness.  That's only half the story.  Research figures
published by
the New
England Journal Of Medicine indicate that 43% of those who turned age 65 in 1990
will enter a
nursing
home at some time during their lifetime.  As people get older, the probability
increases. 
With nursing
home costs averaging more than $30,000 a year, it's not uncommon for retirees to be
reduced
to
poverty.  
<P>
When retirees' savings are depleted, it adversely affects the next generation, too
- usually
at the worst
possible time. Frequently, adult children of senior citizens are working to provide
for their
own
households and futures.  Too often, they become saddled with the cost of supporting
their
parents
while still trying to meet their own household expenses.  It's a tough balancing
act.
<P>
<STRONG>Plan in Advance</STRONG><BR>
As an adult son or daughter, you must get involved with your parents' financial
affairs, and
the sooner
the better.  Start with a meeting of the generations to discuss everyone's plans,
wishes, and
concerns. 
Here are some topics to tackle, and questions to ask:
<P>
<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>Will your parents' retirement funds be adequate?  Inflation and longer life
expectancies may
make retirement costlier than they've anticipated.  What supplemental funds are
available?

	<LI>Who will manage your parents' finances if they cannot?  Discuss long-term
financial
plans, the
location of records, and the possibility of establishing a contingent power of
attorney to
step in and help
during an emergency.

	<LI>What are your parents' estate plans?  When and how will they distribute
their property,
especially
if they become incapacitated?  Are there any charitable endeavors or causes they
wish to
contribute to? 
Do they have updated wills and an executor who knows their wishes?

	<LI>Are your parents' risk management programs adequate? Without adequate
health coverage,
a
single illness could wipe out an otherwise ideal retirement plan.  (Some children
cost-share
their
parents' premiums for Medicare Supplemental or Long Term Care insurance.  They see
it as a
wise
investment in their parents' future.)  What about life insurance?

	<LI>Do your parents have special medical requests, such as living wills,
trusts, lifetime
gifts, etc.? 
Where would they want to live, if incapacitated? (You may wish to discuss nursing
home and home
health care
options.)
</UL>
<P>
<STRONG>Problem</STRONG><BR>
Generally, parents and children feel uncomfortable discussing these matters.  It's
important
to do this
in a way that puts both generations at ease.  One solution is to bring in the
services of a
professional -
such as an insurance agent - who knows about retirement and estate conservation
issues and
who
can serve as an objective and knowledgeable source of information for that
discussion.
