<IMG SRC="bulblogo.gif" ALT="Light Bulb icon" align=bottom ><H2> Quick and Easy Ways to Save Now</H2>

<P>Interested in some quick and easy no-cost or low-cost measures to try now?  Using combinations of the following measures can save you 10% to 
50% on your energy bills.<p>
     
Also, your local utility may provide technical guidance and rebates or other financial incentives for many energy efficiency measures.  Your state may even have tax credits, loans, or sales tax exemptions.<p>
     
Here's a menu of can't-go-wrong items to get you started.<p>


<BR>
<OL>

<LI><P><STRONG>Adjust thermostats.</STRONG> Turn down the building's 
heating thermostat and turn up its cooling thermostat, especially when 
the building is not occupied. <EM> No Cost.</EM>
<BR>
<BR>
<LI><P><STRONG>Reduce the hot water temperature.</STRONG> Reducing the 
temperature on your water heater thermostat can decrease heat loss from 
your tank. For washing hands, you may be able to turn the temperature to 
110 degrees F (43 degrees C). Dishwashing may require higher temperature 
settings such as 130 degrees F (54 degrees C).  <EM>No Cost.</EM>
<BR>
<BR>
<LI><P><STRONG>Install water flow restrictors and aerators in sink 
faucets. </STRONG> These measures can save you money by reducing water 
use (including hot water).<EM> Low Cost.</EM>
<BR>
<BR>
<LI><P><STRONG>Reduce lighting.</STRONG> Remove lamps where you have more 
lighting than you really need, but be sure to maintain safe lighting 
conditions for work areas. Turn lights off when they're not in use.<EM> 
No Cost.</EM>
<BR>
<BR>
<LI><P><STRONG>Seal heating and cooling ductwork.</STRONG> Leakage from 
areas such as joints, elbows, and connections can be substantial--as much 
as 20% to 30%. This is especially costly if the ducts travel through 
unheated or uncooled spaces such as attics, basements, or crawlspaces. 
Use duct tape or caulk to seal ducting.<EM> Low Cost.</EM>
<BR>
<BR>
<LI><P><STRONG>Wrap the hot water tank with jacket insulation.</STRONG> 
This simple, inexpensive measure will reduce standby heat loss from the 
tank.  Be sure to leave the air intake vent uncovered when insulating a 
gas water heater. <EM> Low Cost.</EM>
<BR>
<BR>
<LI><P><STRONG>Replace air filters regularly and follow maintenance 
schedules for furnace and air-conditioning equipment. </STRONG>Replacing 
a dirty air filter can save money by reducing the amount of electricity 
needed to run a blower motor (because there is less resistance to airflow 
with a clean filter).<EM> Low Cost.</EM>
<BR>
<BR>
<LI><P><STRONG>Install programmable thermostats.</STRONG> These 
inexpensive devices, most incorporating modern microprocessor-based 
electronics, can help optimize your building's heating and cooling needs. 
And you won't need to remember to change thermostat settings every time 
you open or close your business.<EM> Low Cost.</EM>
<BR>
<BR>
<LI><P><STRONG>Install automatic room-lighting controls.</STRONG> Similar 
to programmable thermostats, these devices help optimize lighting use by 
automatically turning lights on or off, depending on occupancy or time of 
day. Sensors and timers work well and are usually installed by a 
specialist.<EM> Low Cost.</EM>
<BR>
<BR>
<LI><P><STRONG>Clean heat exchangers and perform routine maintenance on 
refrigerating equipment. </STRONG>These simple measures will ensure the 
most efficient operation of heat exchangers needed for cooling or 
refrigerating equipment.<EM> No Cost.</EM>
<BR>
<BR>
<LI><P><STRONG>Seal off unused areas and don't heat or cool these 
areas.</STRONG>  Storage areas represent a good place to start; turn off 
heating and cooling to these areas.<EM> No Cost.</EM>
<BR>
<BR>
<LI><P><STRONG>Turn off machines and equipment when not needed. 
</STRONG>In many businesses, this simple approach can achieve big 
savings.  Don't underestimate the energy savings you can get by turning 
off unused computers, monitors, printers, and copiers.  <EM>No Cost.</EM>

<BR>
<BR>
<LI><P><STRONG>Buy energy-efficient equipment.</STRONG>  When buying or 
replacing computers, copiers, and other office equipment, compare energy 
requirements of various models.  <EM>Low Cost.</EM>
<BR>
<BR>
<LI><P><STRONG>Seal exterior cracks and holes, and ensure tight-fitting 
windows.</STRONG>  Seemingly small cracks or holes in the building 
exterior (like walls, windows, doors, ceiling, and floors) can really add 
up to substantial heating or cooling losses.  Install weather stripping 
and caulking to stop these air leaks.<EM> Low Cost.</EM>
<BR
><BR>
<LI><P><STRONG>Shade sun-exposed windows and building walls.</STRONG> In 
most areas of the country, direct sunlight streaming through windows at 
the wrong time of the year can substantially increase your 
air-conditioning costs. During the cooling season, use shading methods 
(like window coverings, awnings, trees, and bushes) wherever possible. 
<EM> Low Cost.</EM>
<BR>
<BR>
<LI><P><STRONG>Repaint building exterior with light colors. </STRONG> 
When it's time to repaint the exterior of your building, consider using 
light colors.  More sunlight will be reflected away from the building, 
thus lowering air-conditioning expenses--perhaps your largest energy 
expense. This is especially true for your roof. <EM> Low Cost.</EM>
<BR>
<BR>
<LI><P><STRONG>Keep exterior doors closed as much as possible.</STRONG>  
Don't heat or cool the outdoors. <EM> No Cost.</EM>
<BR>
<BR>
<LI><P><STRONG>Block and insulate unneeded windows and other 
openings.</STRONG> Aside from the important security benefit, covering 
unneeded windows and doors can greatly reduce energy losses from these 
openings. <EM> Low Cost.</EM>
<BR>
<BR>
<LI><P><STRONG>Buy energy-efficient vehicles.</STRONG>  When buying or 
replacing company-owned vehicles, compare energy requirements of various 
models. <EM> No Cost or Low Cost.</EM>
<BR>
<BR>
<LI><p><STRONG>Encourage employees to be energy conscious. </STRONG>The 
importance of getting employee cooperation shouldn't be underestimated; 
their practices and activities can make or break efforts such as these.  
Consider offering a small reward or other incentive for the employee who 
saves the most energy. <EM> No Cost.</EM>
