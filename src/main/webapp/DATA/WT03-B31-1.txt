JAPANESE DEFENSE MINISTER SEEKS LIMITATIONS IN NEW BUDGET

     In spite of prime ministerial support for moderate defense
growth, Japanese Defense Agency (JDA) Director General Yozo
Ishikawa said this week that the agency will likely limit defense
spending in the next five-year defense plan (FYDP) following the
Soviet agreement to allow a unified Germany under NATO.
     Ishikawa said that easing tensions in Europe, coupled with
this new Soviet agreement, will eventually reach the "Asian
region."  He added that in order to win public understanding on
defense expenditures, "it is natural that we try as much as
possible to restrain the scale of the defense budget."
     The statement comes after Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu and
JDA Director General for Policy Akira Hiyoshi last week voiced
more active support for a strong military posture, despite
decreased tensions between the United States and the Soviet
Union.
     Citing differences between the European and Asian political
situation, Hiyoshi emphasized that the region is still militarily
"unstable and fluid."  He pointed to the Soviet Union's strategic
modernization and upgrading of their naval forces with more
advanced weapons, the People's Republic of China's large ground
forces, and the continued war in Cambodia, as justifications for
maintaining a 6 percent annual growth in the next five-year plan
(1991-95).

Budget Details of the New Five-Year Plan

     Last month, JDA estimated the nation's next five-year plan
would total approximately $160 billion and will call for flat
growth in procurement--with more money going to maintenance of
advanced systems--as a direct response to the reduced threat
from, and warming relations with, the Soviet Union and
neighboring countries.
     Japan's current five-year program (1986-90) totals about
$126 billion, under which the defense budget has seen a rough 5.6
percent annual increase.  Some in the government, however, are
looking to reduce that annual growth to below 5 percent, without
exceeding the 1 percent of Gross National Product (GNP) ceiling.
     Japan's Parliamentary Security Council, after a meeting with
JDA officials last month on the new five-year defense program,
says that after a several more meetings, it will propose its new
budget to Japanese legislators early this fall.
     A final FYDP program will be defined and voted on by
December, in time for the government to resolve its entire fiscal
1991 budget plan.

Major Procurement Programs

     Major systems the JDA is looking to procure after 1991
include the Boeing E-3A AWACS aircraft, LTV's Multiple Launch
Rocket System (MLRS), and four air tankers.  Opinions are divided
between the JDA Air Staff Office (ASO) and other departments of
the Defense Agency as to what type of air tankers to buy and how
they should be procured.
     Japanese sources say that it will be very tough to overcome
objections from opposition party leaders who charge that air
tankers would pose a threat to other Pacific Rim nations that
would perceive an extended Japanese attack capability.
     The ASO, however, maintains it is possible to win approval
since the air tanker would be used for extending endurance of
fighters on patrol only in Japanese air space, which would not
pose a threat to neighboring countries.
     Additional continued procurement programs include:
     AH-64A Apache--Outlook for introduction of McDonnell
Douglas' attack helicopter during the next defense program is
bleak as procurement cuts in the purchase of new equipment will
affect future buys, a Japanese source says.  The government adds
that Fuji Heavy Industries will be hit hardest because production
of the AH-IS anti-tank helicopter will end in four years, leaving
the firm without any guarantees of future contracts.
     New aircraft trainer--Development of a follow-on to
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries' (MHI) current T-2 supersonic jet
trainer is designed mainly to foster indigenous aircraft
development capability, rather than meet a requirement to train
pilots, the government says.  But JDA officials say they are
reluctant to develop a new trainer after the experience of the
FSX, in which the U.S. Congress delayed the program for over a
year because it did not approve of the technology transfers
involved.
     Under a contract to Japan's Technical Research and
Development Institute, MHI has also converted one T-2 into a
testbed that utilizes horizontal and vertical canards to increase
the flight envelope, a program similar in principle to the
U.S./German X-31 Enhanced Fighter Maneuverability (EFM) aircraft.
     New light helicopter-A new light helicopter to replace the
Kawasaki/McDonnell Douglas OH-6 may be developed in the latter
half of 1990s, JDA officials say.  The original helicopter was
developed by Hughes (now McDonnell Douglas) Helicopters in the
late 1970s and is produced under license by Kawasaki Heavy
Industries.
     Hawk and Patriot missiles--A new medium-range surface-to-air
missile to replace Raytheon's radar-guided Hawk may be developed
in the 1990s.  The U.S. Army began fielding the improved version,
the PIP III Hawk, last year.  The PIP III provides a low-
altitude, simultaneous engagement capability and enhanced
electronic counter-measures.  Procurement of Raytheon's Patriot
surface-to-air missile will end during the middle of the new
five-year program.

MITSUBISHI SEEKS $333 MILLION MORE FOR FSX

     Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, the Japanese prime contractor
in the development of the FSX fighter, has asked the Japanese
Defense Agency (JDA) for an additional $333 million and another
year's time to complete development of the fighter.
     Mitsubishi says that more funding is necessary as the
development estimate submitted by the U.S. prime contractor,
General Dynamics, is higher than the original estimate of about
$1 billion.  Company officials add that having to develop the
aviation control software on its own has pushed up program costs.
FSX development was originally slated to be completed within five
years, and achieve operational deployment by the late 1990s.
General Dynamics would not comment on the cost changes.
     MHI currently has a small staff of engineers at General
Dynamics' Fort Worth, Texas, plant working on design and
development of the FSX, while General Dynamics, in turn, has a
small contingent of engineers working in MHI's domestic aircraft
facilities.  Although the FSX is based on GD's F-16C, a General
Dynamics official tells us that an actual F-16 is not being used
as a baseboard for FSX development, only certain F-16
technologies are.  The FSX is a complete and independent
development program.

ENGINE FOR JAPANESE TILT-ROTOR TO BE SELECTED SOON

     The selection of an engine for the TW-68, a Japanese tilt-
wing aircraft, will be made within the next 90 days, J. David
Kocurek, president of Ishida Aerospace Group (IAG), tells PAC-RIM
DEFENSE MARKETING correspondent Ernest Blazar.
     Currently, IAG is looking at both Rolls-Royce Turbomeca and
Pratt & Whitney powerplants for the airplane.  He said, "The
aircraft is sizing out nicely" and he is pleased with the
aircraft's technological progress.
     Flight testing of the TW-68 is scheduled for 1994 with
certification expected to be complete by 1997.
     The range and speed of the planned aircraft are estimated at
300-350 knots and 700 static miles, respectively.
     Dual Mode Air Vehicles and the Ishida Corporation of Japan
are jointly developing the aircraft which is capable of lifting
off like a helicopter and flying like an airplane.
     Though some see the TW-68 as a Japanese version of the V-22
Osprey, jointly developed by Bell Helicopters and Boeing
Helicopters, the new aircraft is designed for commercial purposes
rather than the military requirements that drove the Osprey's
design and development.
     Ground-breaking ceremonies were last month for the Ishida
Aerospace Research Technical Center at Fort Worth's Alliance
Airport.  Construction will unfold in two phases.  The first
phase is a 20,000-square-foot building housing design and office
facilities.  After its completion at the end of next year, phase
two construction will begin, bringing the total area to 60,000
square feet.  Phase two will witness the construction of the
assembly buildings.

V-22/TW-68 Seen as Complimentary Aircraft in Novel Market

     Kocurek said he does not particularly view the V-22 Osprey
tilt-rotor aircraft as a competitor.  He explained the V-22
"complements" the Ishida tilt-wing.  The most important item to
remember at this time, he said, is the necessity of building up a
commercial vertical lift constituency in the fixed wing,
rotorcraft operator community.  That constituent backing, he went
on, is how the proper infrastructure for vertical lift will
eventually be developed.
     However, the aircraft are different, he told our sister
publication DEFENSE DAILY.  As most helicopters haul passengers
rather than spend the majority of their time hovering, a tilt-
wing aircraft is better suited to carrying passengers, he said.
"The V-22 is entirely a military aircraft.  The only thing taken
from it is experience," he added.  Additionally, the V-22 is in
the 40,000-pound range, whereas the TW-68 is around 14,000
pounds.
     The FAA has been picking up some momentum in both the
operations and certification sides of the shop, Kocurek said.
     IAG is predicting a monthly production rate of three
aircraft.  Furthermore, it estimates that during the production
run between 1997 and 2005 approximately 300 aircraft will be
produced, 100 of which will be taken by the North American
market.
     The Pacific Rim will take the remainder of the production,
and the Middle East is seen as contributing to the customer base.
As soon as the production line is stabilized, Kocurek said a co-
production venture will begin on one of the Japanese islands.
     In regards to some of the rumors circulating in the industry
about T-Ishida siphoning off Bell Helicopter engineers, Kocurek
said it was not true.  He has not had to solicit any of his
engineers.  As for Bell, "I hope it is a friendly rivalry."
     Kocurek held out the idea that a model tilt-wing port will
be established to demonstrate the value of the technology.
Perhaps a Dallas-to-Houston route will be set up.  Some of the
difficulty in establishing novel vertical lift transport in the
United States is the stumbling block of establishing an
infrastructure.  A package deal of aircraft and vertiport may be
in the works, he said.

AUSTRALIAN DEFENSE OFFICIALS CHARGED WITH PROCUREMENT FRAUD

     Australian government police last week said they have
uncovered a scam in which tens of millions of dollars of the
nation's military procurement budget was annually misappropriated
by military officials as the result of an effort by industry
executives to secure contract awards.
     Commander Jim Allen of the Australian Federal Police (AFP),
who declined to specify the areas in which defense spending fraud
took place, said a year-long investigation by AFP officers
uncovered six instances of Fraud in which military procurement
officials and industry executives colluded to intervene in the
contract tendering process.
     Allen added that there was also evidence of a "revolving
door," where former defense department officers were offered
employment by companies bidding for contracts, noting that the
six cases identified appeared to be only the tip of the iceberg.
     Australian Defense Minister Robert Ray confirmed the
existence of fraud in the defense department, but rejected the
police assertion that it involved millions of dollars.  "Although
the total value of the contracts being investigated amount to
[several] million dollars, there is no valid financial data to
support the claims that the dollar loss to defense through fraud
[amounts to] millions of dollars a year," he said.
     Ray said two cases of fraud are currently active court
cases, while five other cases are still under investigation.  Two
cases, meanwhile, have been closed, one because of a lack of
evidence and another following the conviction of a defense
contractor.
     Allen, who worked for several years as the AFP's senior
liaison officer in Washington, D.C., said corruption and waste in
defense procurement costs the United States $45 billion annually,
the equivalent of 11 new aircraft carriers.  He said evidence
suggests similar corruption has developing in Australia's defense
circles.  Australia's annual defense budget totals about $6
billion.

SOVIETS WILL NOT UNDERCUT U.S. LAUNCH PRICES AT CAPE YORK

     The Soviet Union does not intend to capture the world market
with low-price launches at Australia's Cape York facility,
according to representatives of the Soviet civil space agency
Glavcosmos and a U.S. firm that markets Russian space products.
     "The Soviets have no intention of dominating the market
(through predatory pricing), they only want a share of it,"
Chester Taylor, an official with Space
Commerce Corp. (SCC) of Houston told our sister publication
SOVIET AEROSPACE & TECHNOLOGY.  "The Soviets have said many
times, and I repeat it now, that they will sell launches at world
market prices," he added.  SCC markets Soviet boosters and other
space technology to U.S. customers.
     A senior Soviet space official confirmed Taylor's remarks,
although critics and some members of the fledgling U.S.
commercial launch industry expressed doubt as to the veracity of
the Soviet price claims.  Unlike U.S. firms, the Soviet could
offer low launch prices due to the subsidies and artificial
pricing system that has dominated its economy.
     The Bush Administration announced at the Houston Economic
Summit that the White House would allow launch of American
commercial payloads into orbit by Soviet-built boosters.
     Frank Gaffney, former assistant secretary of defense, said,
"While the Bush Administration avers that the Soviets will be
obliged to charge fair and reasonable prices for their launch
services, this is, at best, wishful thinking; at worst, it is a
canard."
     Gaffney added that Moscow will, like Beijing, disregard
commitments made to the United States to market its boosters at
fair prices.  Under a January 1989 pact with the United States,
China agreed to limit itself to a total of nine commercial
launches over a five-year period.  In return, the United States
would allow American payloads to be exported to China and
launched on its Long March rocket.  Last February, Western firms
complained that China's contract to launch Arabsat for $25
million, roughly half the going price, constituted a breach of
the agreement with the United States.
     In addition, the Soviet has a large stable of boosters and a
strong desire for hard currency.  The Soviet has conducted just
one commercial satellite launch--the low price charged to the
Indian government for the March 1988 mission was a special
introductory offer, according to Soviet officials.
     The price Glavcosmos would charge to orbit a commercial
satellite has taken on increasing relevance since remarks made
recently by Brent Scowcroft, the national security adviser, and
Secretary of State James Baker that indicate the White House will
approve a proposal by USBI Co., a subsidiary of United
Technologies Corp., to manage an Australian space facility.
     The space port, known as Cape York, would feature launches
of commercial payloads, including American-made satellites, using
the Soviet SL-16 Zenit rocket.
     The three-stage Zenit, which can boost 5,860 kg to
geostationary transfer orbit, is well known as the strap-on
rocket for the Soviet heavy-lift Energia launcher, which carries
the Soviet Buran space shuttle.
     In addition to price, some critics of Cape York fear U.S.
satellite technology will be acquired by the Soviet despite
USBI's claims to the contrary.  Gaffney is concerned that a
"short cut" to Cape York will be to allow U.S. payloads to be
launched in the Soviet Union.  "Let there be no mistake about it:
This is a formula for the wholesale compromise of sensitive,
military relevant technologies," Gaffney said.

First Launch Seen in 1995

     "This [the U.S. decision] is a major step...[since] 60
percent of commercial launches are of U.S.-made satellites,"
Stephen Williams, Cape York managing director, said last week.
He predicted the first Zenit rockets could be launched by 1995.
     The spaceport would be the world's first and will cost an
estimated $384 million to build.  The Cape York authority is
planning five launches annually and hopes to take 20 percent of
the global commercial satellite market.  The site in northeast
Australia is seen as a prime candidate due to its proximity to
the equator--only the Ariane complex at Kourou is closer.
     Other industry officials said a commercial launch policy
report prepared by the National Space Council had been approved
by officials at State, Defense, Commerce and NASA.
     It now awaits the president's approval, which is supposed to
be imminent, officials said.  The report will include provisions
concerning launching of U.S. satellites on Soviet boosters.  As
we went to press, the policy had not been formally released.

SALES OF JAPANESE SPACE ITEMS UP 11.6 PERCENT IN 1989

     Japan's industrial aerospace sector sold $1.6 billion worth
of products and services for fiscal 1989, an increase of 11.6%
over 1988, according to preliminary figures released by the
Society of Japanese Aerospace Companies (SJAC) last week.  These
sales bring Japan's total 1989 worldwide aerospace industry sales
to over $6.5 billion for the first time in its history.  SJAC
attributed the sales growth to development of the H-2 rocket, as
well as ground facilities construction related to the H-2.

JAPAN TO TEST SUPERCONDUCTOR POWERED SHIP

     Mitsubishi Heavy Industries has developed a water-propelled
ship powered by a superconductor.  According to company
officials, the ship uses the same sort of force that powers
trains run by superconducting power and is said to be the first
of its kind.  Because the ship is operated by water-jets instead
of the normal rotating screw propeller, officials say maintenance
costs will be minimal.

U.S. FIRM ILLEGALLY SELLS SDI SOFTWARE TO JAPAN

     Four of Japan's largest aerospace and defense contractors
have admitted to purchasing Strategic Defense Initiative related
software from a non-licensed U.S. firm between 1986 and 1989 to
develop the Japan Experimental Module (JEM) for Space Station
Freedom, according to Japanese sources.
     Officials from Mitsubishi Research Institute, Mitsubishi
Heavy Industries (MHI), Nissan Motor Co., and Ishikawajima-Harima
Heavy Industries (IHI), which purchased the Contam software
system without proper U.S. licenses, contend they were unaware
that they lacked the relevant import permits from the U.S.
government.  They further noted that there are no procedures for
verifying whether or not a U.S. company has received all
necessary licenses.
     The software was sold by Plume Technology, a small defense
software contractor located in Los Angeles.  Four weeks ago,
Plume executive Ronald Hoffman was arrested for illegally
exporting the Contam software to Japan.  According to a U.S.
government affidavit filed in Los Angeles federal court, the
software continues to be developed to analyze missile plumes and
exhaust trails to provide missile defense data for develop SDI.
     A spokesman for Mitsubishi said the Japanese companies
bought the software "because it was interesting, but that's all
we can say."
     The U.S. government is still investigating the software
sale.  The Pentagon's SDI Organization (SDIO) declined to comment
on the case, noting that it is still pending.  The U.S.
Department of Justice also declined to comment.
