This is the fourth in an occasional series of volumes, ADVANCES IN CRIMINOLOGICAL
THEORY, launched to fill a perceived dearth of outlets for papers focusing
on theoretical issues in criminology. As such, the series resembles more
an irregular journal than a collection of related essays. This semblance
is reinforced by the absence of an interpretive introduction by the editors;
unlike previous volumes, this one simply begins and ends. Without guidance,
one naturally turns to the table of contents for clues about what is to
follow. There are none, save the inclusion of Travis Hirschi's name in the
titles of two chapters. A reviewer therefore faces a task roughly equivalent
reviewing the complete contents of an academic journal. The contributions
themselves are starkly uneven, but a careful reading revealed three loose
themes and three odd papers among the 11 chapters (or 12, including a final
selection labeled &quot;comments.&quot;)<BR>
<BR>
Introductions to the first and second volume note, but do not quite lament,
that academic criminology journals are increasingly dominated by empirical
research and discussions of methods. It was felt that a forum for theory
was needed. This is true, but more so for reasons not cited by the editors.
Most scholars probably view criminology as a multidisciplinary field; others
feel it has now become a discipline. In either case some sort of forum for
bringing together discussions of theory from the recognized disciplines
that contribute to criminological research is certainly in order. The present
volume does this, after a fashion, but more by accident than by design.
On to the themes.<BR>
<BR>
The first two chapters address theoretical perspectives that could be of
interest to political scientists, labeling theory and Marxist criminology.
In a chapter entitled, &quot;The Future of Labeling Theory,&quot; Charles
Wellford and Ruth Triplett attempt to make a case that the labeling perspective
deserves more respect. They link its essential elements to symbolic interactionism:
labels applied to individuals are symbols that influence their behavior.
Unfortunately, they focus almost exclusively on how being labeled affects
subjective perceptions and behavior, but ignore how the behavior of public
officials and others toward labeled persons (delinquents, criminals, or
just troublemakers) is influenced by labels.<BR>
<BR>
Wellford and Triplett claim that its association with conflict criminology
is one reason why labeling theory has not been more widely embraced. As
if to reinforce this, the contribution by sociologist Austin Turk launches
into a what comes off as a pep talk for Marxist criminology, which he claims
is misleadingly referred to as conflict criminology. Whatever it is called,
in conflict/Marxist theory crime is viewed as an artifact of social values
and political power, both of which are embodied in criminal law. Politics
involves conflict over social and other values. The winners of such conflict
define certain behavior and acts as crimes, while the losers -- people whose
behavior is rejected -- are defined as criminals. Turk serves up a few interesting
insights, but the chapter is little more than a guide for Marxists on how
they can better handle methodological enemies.<BR>
<BR>
Three chapters dwell on Travis Hirschi's (1969) influential work on delinquency.
Briefly, Hirschi proposed and tested a control theory (also called &quot;bonding&quot;)
of delinquency. Various sources of control can prevent delinquency. Parents,
peers, and schools are institutions that instill attachment and internalization
of social norms. Delinquency is more likely for males with weak attachment
to parents and school, and stronger attachment to deviant peers.<BR>
<BR>
Chapters by Kimberly Kempf and by Marc <BR>
<BR>

<BR>
Le Blanc and Aaron Caplan complement each other nicely. Kempf's contribution
presents a meta-analysis of the numerous studies that purport to test Hirschi's
control theory. Hirschi fares well on two of three criteria Kempf sets up
for judging a theory. First, public policy since 1969 has shifted in ways
consistent with Hirschi's emphasis on bonding and attachment. Second, the
many attempts to replicate or further test various components of control
theory indicate that it has become a subjective standard among criminologists.
Third, these subsequent empirical tests yield mixed support. Kempf argues
that differences in measurement and other methods are responsible for inconsistent
results.<BR>
<BR>
Kempf's contribution itself is not especially noteworthy, but gains added
weight from the most ambitious selection in the volume. Commenting on an
earlier version of Kempf's paper, Le Blanc and Caplan are not surprised
that empirical tests produced mixed results, because, they argue, a discursive
presentation of a complex theory invites inconsistent interpretations. The
solution offered in this chapter is to produce a formal version, since formal
theory more readily reveals internal inconsistencies. After producing an
initial formal statement of Hirschi, Le Blanc and Caplan formulate a revised
formal theory based on: (1) internal inconsistencies revealed by the initial
formal statement, (2) results from a careful replication, and (3) developments
in control theory since Hirschi's 1969 book.<BR>
<BR>
With four appendices, this chapter approaches 100 pages in length. But it
is potentially useful for two types of readers. Scholars following in Hirschi's
footsteps, and there are many, will carefully study the formal versions,
form their own judgments and hopefully commence further studies. The intended
audience of this series -- scholars with a particular interest in theory
-- will benefit from the general discussion of formal theory and the example
presented by Le Blanc and Caplan. Many of the second group might be dismayed
by the laborious effort required to produce formal statements. But Le Blanc
and Caplan make a convincing case that formal theory exposes sloppy thinking
(though they are careful to point out that Hirschi's theory displays little
of this), and forms the base for more systematic empirical tests, thus avoiding
the anarchy revealed by Kempf.<BR>
<BR>
Michael Lynch, Graeme Newman, and W. Byron Groves present the third contribution
focusing on Hirschi's work. Two goals are stated in this chapter; a third
emerges. First, the authors demonstrate how Durkheim's writings on punishment
as a source of social control are similar to Hirschi's development of control
theory to explain crime. Durkheim was more interested in punish- ment as
a policy, while Hirschi focused on how control and its absence inhibited
or promoted individual criminal behavior. The second goal quickly emerges
from the Durkheim-Hirschi comparison: to demonstrate the conceptual similarities
between control theory and deterrence. Unfortunately, this exercise leads
the authors to their final goal: a specious claim that punishment cannot
possibly deter crime.<BR>
<BR>
Two selections focus on corporate or white-collar crime, a topic prominent
in earlier series volumes. The chapter by Edward Sieh is simply a discussion
of case studies of employee theft in various organizational settings in
England. In essence, three forces are at work. First, workers and work groups
have varying autonomy and opportunities for &quot;fiddling.&quot; Second,
theft and fiddling are promoted by attempts to redress perceived inequities
in salary, working conditions, and prestige. Finally, small-group subcultures
can encourage theft, while exercising informal controls to regulate its
scope. Such observations are interesting and worthwhile to students of employee
theft, but there are no synthetic insights of any value. For example, in
a single paragraph, Sieh suggests that other responses to inequity may result,
ranging from malingering, through union actions, to: &quot;... political
unrest and rebellion&quot; (p 108).<BR>
<BR>
Sally Simpson's chapter on corporate crime is one of the best in the volume,
a true synthesis of organization and economic theory, <BR>
<BR>

<BR>
together with historical analysis of industrial technology to explain varying
patterns of illegal corporate practices. Simpson's paper is especially noteworthy
in its departure from most previous ventures into the study of white-collar
crime by criminologists. The latter typically begin by comparing street
crime to white collar crime, perhaps noting that the dark figure of corporate
illegality is much larger and more costly than any number of petty thefts
or burglaries. In appealing to other paradigms, Simpson produces several
hypotheses rooted in organization theory and industrial development. The
form of illegality -- horizontal price-fixing and mergers, vertical buyer-seller
collusion, or mixed forms -- depends on dominance by different subunits
within the organization. Dominance by sales and marketing subunits promotes
vertical illegality and false advertising as a firm strives to improve market
share. If corporate finance departments have greater influence, a firm's
focus shifts away from coercing customers and suppliers to illegal mergers,
and perhaps violations of health and safety regulations. The volume of illegal
behavior will be greatest in sales and marketing subunits, since managers
are more attentive to unit performance, not routine operations. The activities
of sales and marketing units are also less subject to internal scrutiny
since they involve a large number of interactions with persons outside the
firm. As firms within a product market become more similar, so do patterns
of industry-wide criminality.<BR>
<BR>
Simpson supports these propositions by linking the evolution of corporate
form and subunit dominance to changes in patterns of illegality and federal
regulations. As in all such attempts to explain the behavior of actors in
large complex organizations over time, the framework is imperfect. But the
mix of organizational and economic incentives is a more provocative and
potentially valuable framework than attributing corporate crime to evil
executives, subcultures of deviance, or other explanations borrowed from
traditional criminology.<BR>
<BR>
Of the three odd chapters, two are of little value. Robert Nash Parker offers
some preliminary thinking about how the association between alcohol and
homicide might mesh with four theoretical perspectives on crime causation.
Theory-based research on homicide is not well developed, and Parker's failure
to provide any new insights is disappointing.<BR>
<BR>
A contribution by David Weisburd, Lisa Maher, Lawrence Sherman, and associates
is interesting, but not at all suitable for this volume. The authors examine
neighborhood variation in calls for service and attempt to interpret results
in light of two ill- defined theoretical perspectives: (1) all crime is
caused by similar factors; (2) different types of crime are caused by different
factors. Results are inconclusive.<BR>
<BR>
Jeffrey Fagan's chapter on social control of spousal assault is valuable
for two reasons. First, his review serves as an excel- lent introduction
to the large and growing literature on domestic violence, a topic that has
attracted no small number of ideologues. Although Fagan has his own agenda,
he does a nice job of synthesizing this literature. Second, there is a subtle
but incisive commentary on the initial promise but eventual failure of arrest
as a routine, rather than discretionary, response to domestic violence.<BR>
<BR>
Fagan's discussion of experimental studies and replications is especially
worthwhile in pointing out a fundamental, but too often ignored, flaw in
field experimentation. Arrest is not a reliable intervention. Uncontrolled
variation includes length of time in custody, prior record of the arrested
person, and whether or not prosecution followed arrest. Such treatment irregularities
obviate the advantages of randomized designs. Furthermore, Fagan points
out that focusing on actions by police may naively overlook how adaptive
actions by prosecutors and judges can neutralize arrest policies. Such insights
will not be surprising to scholars familiar with studies of trial courts,
but Fagan's commentary provides something of a new direction for criminologists.<BR>

Who should buy this volume? It would be misleading and of little value for
scholars who are unfamiliar with criminological theory and seek a concise
overview. Those who know something of the field and wish to learn about
new developments will be disap- pointed by the volume's narrow scope. The
value of chapters by Simpson, Fagan, and Le Blanc and Caplan does not offset
the overwhelmingly uninteresting character of the rest of the book. Editorial
quality is poor; for example, Marc Le Blanc's name is consistently misspelled
in all but his own citations. The title notwithstanding, new directions
are difficult to find in this volume.<BR>
