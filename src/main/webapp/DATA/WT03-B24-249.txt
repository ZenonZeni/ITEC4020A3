<h1>Organizing Against Profit in Health Care</h1>
<h2>by  David Lawrence</h2>

<p>The principal factor destroying our health care system and 
increasingly limiting our access to it, is the drive to 
maximize profit. Moreover, it is the more destructive drive 
to maximize profit by huge multinational corporations in 
contrast to the petty capitalist entrepreneur physician of 
decades ago. Fee-for-service medicine, where the physician 
receives a fee for each medical procedure, has predominated 
in the delivery of medicine in the United States for about 
150 years. Until the 1940s, however, entrepreneurial 
"cottage craft" physicians ran a fairly low-budget business. 
As a result, the fees charged remained relatively low. </p>

<p> Spurred by technological advancements resulting from World 
War II, high-tech medicine experienced explosive growth from 
that period until the present day. As a result of this 
extraordinary change in the field of medicine, the 
techniques of medical care have been radically altered, and 
just as importantly the social organization of medicine has 
been fundamentally changed. </p>

<p> Medical specialties proliferated alongside the burgeoning 
medical technology industry. The family practice physician 
and surgeon of the last century proliferated into dozens of 
specialties. The practice of modern medicine has become 
defined by its expanding technology, and by those with the 
capital to purchase that technology and to purchase the 
services of those who can operate it. The solo fee-for-
service physician of decades ago is being forced into group 
practice in order to afford to practice, and in order to 
maximize the profits of practice. Many physicians were 
forced into mutually dependent relationships with hospitals. 
Hospitals had the capital with which to purchase the 
products of the medical technology industry, and physicians 
had the expertise to utilize the technology and the ability 
to steer patients to it.</p>

<p> From its humble condition in the last century, medicine 
suddenly became a powerful trillion-dollar engine in the 
American capitalist economy. The manufacturers of medical 
technology and pharmaceuticals became huge multinational 
corporations, cashing in on inventions and discoveries often 
supported significantly by government and paid for by tax 
dollars. These industries pushed their products, frequently 
unsafe or ineffective, into every nook and cranny of 
hospitals and clinics - creating "profit centers" where 
there had been closets, staff rooms, even vacant lots.</p>

 <p>Hospitals sprouted up across the country, propelled by an 
ever increasing proportion of for-profit, investor-owned 
enterprises. In the mad rush for the profits of corporate 
control, big regional chains of hospitals were acquired by 
huge multi-billion dollar multinational chains. Even the 
public sector was sacked as county hospitals were purchased 
by the chains or contracted out to for-profit management 
companies. Physician salaries increased as they charged more 
and more, fueled by the utter lack of accountability. 
Physicians could double and triple their income by "self 
referring," i.e., becoming investors in laboratories and 
diagnostic imaging facilities (such as x-rays and CAT scans) 
and then referring their own patients to these enterprises.</p>

<p> The health insurance industry didn't really care, since 
their profits exploded in direct relationship to the rising 
costs of health insuhttp://www.cubaweb.cu/an inconsequential presence in 1940 to a 
dominant financial industry in the United States currently 
worth hundreds of billions of dollars. </p>

 <h4>More Medicine, More profit</h4>

<p> The key mantra in this history has been "more medicine is 
more profit." Hospitals did everything they could to attract 
more physicians in order to capture their patients - every 
bed a potential profit center. Physicians over-treated 
patients for the same reason - every patient encounter added 
to the bottom line. Despite the occasional appearance of 
protest, the insurance industry had no reason to change the 
situation because they were wallowing in ever-increasing 
profits.</p>

 <p>The fact that tens of millions of Americans had been priced 
out of this medical profits machine did not matter to the 
health care industry and was not enough to change the 
system. Rather, two emerging processes have coalesced in 
recent years resulting in the managed care onslaught. First, 
the hundreds of billions of health care dollars have been 
concentrated in the hands of a few huge health insurance 
companies, a few giant hospital chains, and a few mammoth 
managed care organizations. Physicians have not competed 
well against the multinational corporations and have lost 
financial and political control to them. Secondly, the 
Fortune 500 industries have grown tired of transferring 
their potential profits to health insurers and providers. 
They want cheaper health care with more stable costs year 
after year.</p>

 <h4>Rise of Health Maintenance Organizations</h4>

 <p>The old health care industry lines blurred as the biggest 
health insurance companies went on a binge purchasing health 
maintenance organizations (HMOs), and hospital chains 
started their own. HMOs are a form of managed care where 
members pay a fixed fee to a corporation that controls which 
health care providers its members will have access to. Some 
of the earlier HMOs such as Kaiser, Health Insurance Plan of 
New York, and Group Health Cooperative of Puget Sound, were 
established as cooperatives or non-profits and focused on 
service rather than profit. However, most newer HMOs are 
investor-owned strictly for-profit enterprises. </p>

 <p>These profit-seeking HMOs gobble up the health care 
resources in a region, then offer a packaged deal to 
industry and government. This has turned on its head the old 
mantra, "more medicine is more profit." Since HMOs are paid 
a fixed sum to provide for the medical needs of a specific 
population, the new HMO industry mantra is "less medicine is 
more profit." Far from being merely a theoretical issue, 
mounting evidence indicates that the quality of health care 
is plummeting under the greedy control of for-profit HMOs. 
This is of particular concern since in 1992 about 550 HMOs 
controlled the health of over 41 million Americans, and the 
growth of HMO coverage remains explosive.</p>

 <p><a name="R1">In the early 1970s, California contracted with over 50 HMOs 
to provide care for 300,000 Medicaid enrollees. In just a 
few years the entire program was awash in a quality of care 
scandal and was abandoned. In the early and mid-1980s, 
Arizona and Ohio had similar devastating experiences. <a href="#N1">(1)</a> </p>

<p><a name="R2">During the past five years Florida has repeated the 
experiments with HMOs for over a third of a million 
residents. A major state newspaper characterized the outcome 
as "a separate and dangerously unequal care system." In 
addition, evaluators found that some HMOs spend as little as 
half their revenues for medical care, and most of the HMOs 
were given overall evaluations of "poor" or "very poor." <a href="#N2">(2)</a></p>

 <p><a name="R3">Last year the Center for the Study of Services tried to 
gather member-satisfaction ratings for 250 health plans and 
by federal employees. Sixty of the plans refused to let 
their members respond to the questionnaires. <a href="#N3">(3)</a></p>

<p><a name="R4"> In 1992 fewer than 100 HMOs covered 1.6 million people on 
Medicare. Today, 165 HMOs are responsible for the health 
care of 2.5 million Medicare recipients, and another 70 HMOs 
are waiting in the wings to make their killing in the 
marketplace. The states, eager to reduce their financial 
burden, are abandoning their Medicaid patients to for-profit 
HMOs with little or no significant evaluation. Mounting 
evidence indicates widespread fraudulent and deceptive 
marketing practices, paralleling the long history of similar 
abuses in long-term care and Medigap insurance sales to the 
elderly. <a href="#N4">(4)</a></p>

 <p><a name="R5">Recently, a few dozen corporate bigwigs, representatives of 
government and members of other assorted organizations 
representing 80 million workers and their families, met in 
Jackson Hole, Wyoming. <a href="#N5">(5)</a> These are hardcore HMO advocates but 
they realize their cut-rate health care vision is in 
trouble. They have pledged to change their focus from 
reducing costs to increasing quality of managed health care. 
They are running scared because they know the results of 
emerging research and the people's experiences. They want to 
save managed care in order to secure their profits. Quality 
of care in HMOs and other managed care health plans is the 
Achilles heel of the scheme. </p>

<p> There is a tremendous amount of energy among community 
groups, public health professionals, the elderly and 
grassroots health reformers and advocates. This energy must 
be focused, first, to hone in on the quality of care issue 
under managed care. Questionnaires can be handed out to 
members of these plans, and hearings can be held. Inquiries 
can be made for information at state agencies, and if they 
don't have quality of care information or will not release 
it, then that in itself becomes part of the problem that 
must be publicized. Collect information from the library - 
there is more coming out every week.</p>

 <p><a name="R6">The energy of the people must be focused secondly on 
eliminating all profits from health care. It is simply too 
late for the popular single payer option that they have in 
Canada. As Physicians for a National Health Program 
(historically advocates for single payer) are now asking, 
"What would public financing of a system, dominated by large 
for-profit horizontally and vertically integrated firms and 
chains look like, and mean?" <a href="#N6">(6)</a> The only answer for the 
working people of the United States is a publicly financed 
and operated, democratically run National Health Service 
which eliminates all profit in health care. Legislation 
advocating a National Health Service was introduced once 
again by Representative Ron Dellums (D-CA) as HR 1798, on 
June 8, 1995 (104th Cong., 1st Sess.)</p>

 <p>The struggle must start with a crushing attack on the 
quality of care under for-profit managed care. This must be 
led by the labor movement and its allies in the community 
and professional ranks. The breadth of the struggle must 
include the saving and expanding of Medicare and Medicaid; 
immediate coverage of all uninsured people that single payer 
legislation will bring; major public housing programs; full-
scale environmental and occupational health prevention 
programs - all culminating around the fight for a national 
health service. These are the short and long-term goals that 
our movement needs and the politicians must respond to!</p>
