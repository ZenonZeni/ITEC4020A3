Hospital Overhauls Information System To Adopt
Client-Server Environment


Tired of the lack of communication between and duplication of
effort among components of its budding integrated delivery system,
one Texas hospital decided to rework the entire information system.
Hermann Hospital of Houston embarked on a three-year initiative to
phase in a system to create an electronic medical record accessible
from all parts of the network, says CIO David Tucker.
The first phase involves pilot tests at five or six University of
Texas clinics associated with the hospital. After phase one is
complete, the hospital will focus on integrating other departments,
such as nursing, into the network.
The hospital currently operates in a mainframe environment, but is
now moving to a client-server environment that makes information
more accessible to the end-user, Tucker says.
The paperless, client-server system will eliminate the need for
duplicate medical records scattered around the network.
For example, if a patient goes into a clinic in the morning, then
goes to the Hermann emergency room that night, physicians in the ER
have no way of knowing about the encounter that morning and will
draw up a new chart, Tucker says.
When implemented, the system will link about 2,000 devices,
including workstations and printers, located at about 60 clinics in
the area. Hermann hopes to have the first pilot systems in place by
September.
Contact Tucker at (713) 704-3367.

Hospital Slashes Patient Admission Time Using
`Administrative Partner' Program


Physician managers at a Southern California hospital credit
first-phase implementation of a patient-focused quality care model
- the use of "administrative partners" - with shorter patient
waits, increased cash collections and other process improvements.
"Our overall goal is to bring services closer to the patient, to
eliminate wait times, the redundancy of people asking the same
questions of the patient"to rework the entire patient flow process
so it is simpler and easier from a patient's perspective," says
Kari Cornicelli, director of financial operations at 109-bed
Pomerado Hospital in Poway, Calif.
Called Patient First, Pomerado's four-stage program began in April
1994 with implementation of the administrative partners phase.
"Service partners" was implemented in March 1995, and the hospital
plans to begin "clinical care partners" (training direct-care staff
for multiple tasks and improved case management) and "family
partners" (working with families to improve care for discharged
patients) by the end of 1996.
Pomerado's sister hospital, 353-bed Palomar Medical Center in
Escondido, Calif., runs a similar patient-focused care program.
Administrative partners, which combine the roles of unit secretary
and admitting clerk, surpassed some stated goals:

o       Average admission time fell to 3.07
minutes by December 1995, down from 15 minutes in February 1994.
The 1995 goal: not to exceed 5 minutes.
o       Monthly cash collections rose to
$86,752 by December 1995, up from $15,270 in February 1994. The
1995 goal: $53,000.

From February 1994 to year-end 1995, officials also cite the
following process improvement indicators for administrative
partners: 
(1) Completed account files for patient billing rose to
86% from 50% (below a 1995 goal of 95% completion); 
(2) Advanced directive acknowledgments on patient charts
climbed to 92% from 61.8% (above a 90% goal);
(3) Signed requests for extension of hospital stay for Medi-Cal
patients increased to 92% from 83% (below a 98% goal).

Pomerado then re-designed the role of the environmental service
worker/housekeeper. Housekeeper  duties were limited to some
cleaning chores. But Pomerado trained 11 FTEs as "service partners"
to clean an entire floor and to ambulate patients and perform basic
comfort duties, such as getting blankets and water.
Registered nurse Lori Burnell, assistant administrator and nurse
executive, says Pomerado saved $173,800 in its service partners
phase through staff consolidation and the elimination of 4.2 FTEs.

Plans Target Accessible MDs For Contracts, Rewards


An increasing number of managed care plans are rewarding primary
care physicians based on their ability to take on new patients.
The trend started a few years ago and has taken root in mature East
and West Coast markets and in  the Twin Cities, says Bill
Townsend, a consultant in Towers Perrin's integrated health systems
group in Minneapolis.
The move toward rewarding MDs for seeing more patients is part of
a broader strategy among employers and managed care plans to
increase access to services. To meet this objective, a plan or
employer must first make sure it contracts with doctors who offer
easy access to patients.
According to Townsend, plans and employers use a variety of methods
to reward MDs who maintain their access for patients, including:

o       Paying an MD a flat bonus for
keeping his or her practice open to new patients; or
o       Tying the MD's share of any surplus
pool to the percentage of plan enrollees that physician sees.

Generally, plans and employers don't set "growth targets" that
specifically reward MDs for increasing the number of patients they
see over a period of time, Keyes says. That's because allocating
the risk pool based on the number of enrollees an MD sees
encourages doctors to add new patients, he explains.

Hospital Restructures Triage To Speed Interventions


Finding its emergency room triage system redundant and frustrating
to patients, Fairfax (Va.) Hospital's continuous quality
improvement team empowered nurses to intervene in certain patient
cases.
The result: a 40% reduction in turnaround time for intervention in
extreme-trauma cases. The same triage method was used to conduct
septic workups on children, stomach pain, and urinary tract
infections.
The 700-bed, level-one trauma center receives about 62,000
emergency room visits annually and admits 23% of its patients.
That's a significant number compared to most emergency departments,
which admit an average 12% to 15% cases.
Most emergency departments have four vertical care "silos" that
patients encounter, says Dr. Thom Mayer, chairman of the department
of emergency medicine. Those silos: (1) physicians; (2) nurses;
(3) essential service providers such as lab and X-ray
technicians; and (4) registration personnel.
But each silo operates independently, leading to redundancies and
patient frustration.
Applying continuous quality improvement methods, Fairfax emergency
department representatives held monthly quality council meetings to
determine how to improve services.
The team examined the amount of time it took to get a patient into
an X-ray or to the lab and the number of steps involved in the
process.
One result: a key staffer intervenes in patient cases and guides
cases through the emergency room.
For more information, contact Mayer at (703)  698-3195.

HMOs Held Financially Liable For Meeting Quality Goals


A Denver small-business alliance has launched a "performance
program" of quality indicators - complete with financial incentives
and disincentives - for health plans in its Cooperative for Health
Insurance Purchasing (CHIP).
Founded in 1988, the Colorado Health Care Purchasing Alliance
offers two products to its 370-odd members, which represent 85,000
covered lives: a PPO for self-insured companies and the CHIP. About
228 companies, representing 5,000 covered lives, use the purchasing
alliance.
The "performance program" covers the four CHIP HMOs with which the
alliance contracts for standard benefit plans. The program sets
seven indicators, with common objectives for each.
Financial incentives and disincentives were a part of the plan from
the beginning, says LaDon Kessler, alliance information manager. At
the end of the year, the best-performing health plan in each
indicator gets 50% of the pool accumulating over the year from
plans not meeting the goal.
Service indicators are reported monthly and financially assessed
quarterly; other indicators, including provider access and member
satisfaction, are reported annually and financially assessed
annually. Clinical indicators have no financial adjustment.
Assessments run 0.333% of total quarterly premium for service
indicators, and 0.333% of total annual premium for satisfaction and
provider access indicators.
Close to the fall open enrollment period, the alliance will release
a "report card" that shows plans'  performance against the seven
indicators' common  objectives. The alliance may attach some
HEDIS results to the report card.

Blues Group Implements Appropriateness Rules


The National Account Consortium, a group of nine Blue Cross and
Blue Shield plans with national employer accounts, has adopted
nationwide standards for treatment appropriateness for all
participating caregivers.
The standards, developed by the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Assn.'s
Technology Evaluation Center, are outcomes- and protocol-based.
Other health plans, including Cigna, Prudential, Kaiser and HCFA,
use the system as well.
The consortium is implementing the standards as part of its managed
care strategy, says Dr. Alex Rodriguez, medical director of the
Stamford, Ct.-based consortium. The standards apply to HMO, PPO,
point-of-service (POS) and indemnity plans.
Consortium members use the standards to determine payment for
services. If physicians don't follow the standards, they could be
denied payment, may not receive authorization for treatment, and,
if inappropriate utilization persists, risk exclusion from provider
panels.
The standards systematize more than 200 medical evaluations and
treatments that involve complicated diagnoses, including
controversial, high-risk and high-cost treatments. They also
provide a summary of appropriate and inappropriate care with
references to scientific evidence, and include the appropriate
procedure and diagnosis codes for treatments such as routine Pap
smears for women.
The consortium plans to automate the standards to allow for more
rapid payment of claims. Blues plans in California, Connecticut,
Illinois, Massachusetts, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Texas
participate.

Problems with Provider Risk Outlined in Safe Harbors


The final managed care "safe harbor" regulations raise the specter
of false claims accusations for providers who participate in
non-contract managed care plans that use withholds, lawyers say.
Issued Jan. 25 by the HHS inspector general, safe harbors protect
certain deals from prosecution under the Medicare-Medicaid
anti-kickback law (61 FR 2122).
The preamble to the regulations state the IG has "declined to
provide specific safe harbor protection to withhold pools, risk
incentive pools or other types of incentive programs offered by
non-contract managed care plans" (PM 2/9/96, p. 8).
The safe harbors expand the definition of "health plan" to protect
a wider variety of managed care arrangements, including (1) PPOs
that act as intermediaries between providers and payers and (2)
self-insured employers or union welfare funds that contract
directly with providers or insurance companies.
The rules also protect provider fee-for-service discounts to
managed care plans, as well as some capitated arrangements that
plans make with providers. But they don't protect other forms of
provider risk assumption, such as payment withholds and risk pools.
The safe harbors only protect the waiver of Medicare coinsurance
and deductibles in Medicare risk and cost-contract HMOs and the
waiver of inpatient hospital coinsurance and deductibles in
Medicare Select PPOs and HMOs. The rules don't protect waivers of
coinsurance and deductibles in other types of plans.

Group Tackles Pregnancy Care In First Report Card Effort


Dallas/Forth Worth employers, hospitals and physicians have joined
forces in an ambitious first-time effort to measure health care
quality and value - and thus improve health communitywide.
Called the Health Care Value Initiative, the collaboration by the
DFW Business Group on Health, Dallas-Forth Worth Hospital Council,
5,900-member Dallas County Medical Society, and 2,000-member
Tarrant County Medical Society in Fort Worth seeks to design a
quality report card with uniform standards for health providers to
disseminate to the business community by March 1997.
While the initial focus is on measuring quality during pregnancy
and childbirth, which employers cite as a top concern, the group
also plans to examine cardiology, orthopedics, oncology and
psychiatry, says John Gavras, president of the 82-member hospital
council.
Pregnancy and childbirth indicators include maternal mortality
rate; neonatal mortality rate; post-operative mortality rate;
C-section rates (primary, secondary, total and vaginal birth after
C-section); post-operative surgical site infection; uterine rupture
rate; infection rate (metritis only); and unplanned neonatal
readmission. All are risk-adjusted.
The group also will examine indicators that are not risk-adjusted,
including complications due to anesthetic/sedation.
The coalition will follow up with health risk assessment and
patient satisfaction surveys.
The hospital council anticipates statewide comparison of hospital
data and perhaps comparison with cities such as Seattle and Kansas
City, Mo.
Participating hospitals will sign a confidentiality statement so
data will not be used for marketing; the council will sign a
confidentiality statement with members underscoring an
understanding that data are hospital-owned.

Telephone Survey Comments Influence Outcomes Initiatives


Using qualitative comments gleaned from post-discharge patient
satisfaction surveys, a children's hospital tries to pull parents
into pediatric care decisions and influence patient outcomes.
The hospital gleans qualitative comments from 20-minute telephone
surveys of parents conducted 10 days after patient discharge. Those
comments - positive and negative - show up on a large bulletin
board in the waiting room of the hospital's outpatient center for
cancer and blood disorders.
HealthCare Research Systems of Columbus, Ohio, conducts the
telephone surveys - about 400 twice a year for the outpatient
center, in addition to mail and other surveys performed for the
facility over the past four years.
If the comment is negative, the hospital lists the action it took
to fix the problem.
Comments generally deal with how a physician listened to the
parents, how much time the physician spent with the parents, and
whether the physician involved the parents in decisions made about
a child's medical care.
Although some quantitative scores are posted, they don't interest
parents as much as the qualitative scores, contends Charlie Hauser,
vice president of the provider division for HealthCare Research
Systems.
The goal: encourage parental involvement by breaking down the
intimidating and often mysterious barriers surrounding medical
care. By encouraging family participation, the bulletin board has
a positive effect on the patient's outcomes, Hauser says.
Contact Hauser at (614) 487-6333.

Nurse Quality Initiative Garners `Magnet Hospital' Rank


An Atlanta hospital's initiative to give nurses more
decision-making authority at the patient bedside and in turn boost
quality of care nabbed the facility "magnet hospital" status.
Saint Joseph's Hospital of Atlanta became the third hospital
nationwide to earn recognition by the American Nurses Credentialing
Center as a magnet hospital for nursing care.
The center reviews documentation and conducts site visits to
evaluate whether a hospital meets nursing standards in nine areas,
including quality assurance. More than 200 criteria are used.
The voluntary, four-year magnet hospital designation allows
hospitals to go beyond the Joint Commission on Accreditation of
Healthcare Organizations' overview to a closer examination of
nursing programs, says Mary Tilbury, consultant to the magnet
program.
Noting that Atlanta's highly competitive health market includes
50-odd hospitals and a recent influx of managed care, Kim Sharkey,
the hospital's director of nursing business planning and support
services, says Saint Joseph's sought magnet status to get
recognition of ongoing positive feedback from physicians, patients
and families on a shared governance professional practice model.
Implemented in 1981, the practice model allows the nurse at bedside
greater decision-making autonomy. The model includes nurse quality
assurance, management, and practice and education councils.
Saint Joseph's uses a top-down, multidisciplinary approach to
continuous quality improvement. The hospital also uses national
databases to compare performance on quality measures. "Our feeling
is if we can validate outcomes that are positive, payers ultimately
will realize cost is important but outcomes are even more
important," Sharkey says.
Contact Sharkey at (404) 851-7296, and Tilbury at (202) 651-7000.

Hospital Cuts Paper Chase Out of System Buy Process


In its search for a new information system, a New York hospital
found an alternative to the usual paper-intensive process of
submitting a request for proposal (RFP) to vendors.
Brooks Memorial Hospital of Dunkirk, N.Y., first sent out a request
for information to 13 vendors and narrowed the choice to seven.
But an RFP involves a great deal of paperwork on both sides and
often is not filled with information that prospective buyers can
really use. So hospital CFO Ralph Webdale chaired a 13-member
committee that included physicians and representatives from
nursing, billing, accounting and pharmacy departments.
For one day a week, each of the seven vendors did on-site demos in
each department. Committee members independently rated each
vendor's software package, then discussed the systems' strengths
and weaknesses as a group.
A vital element of the review process was the telephone reference,
Webdale says. Each committee member spoke to their counterparts at
hospitals that had installed the vendors' products, then rated and
discussed each product based on the conversations.
The final step: rate the documentation of the top six vendors based
on criteria such as ease-of-use.
Contact Webdale at (716) 366-1111.

Contract `Gag Clauses' Rare, Seldom Used on MDs


Like it or not, physicians generally have little choice but to
agree to the "gag clauses" included in HMO provider contracts.
However, few HMOs use the wide-ranging clauses that lately have
drawn backlash from physicians, consumers and legislators, say
experts.
HMOs say the clauses, when used, prevent MDs from (1) disclosing
proprietary information, (2) spoiling a patient's opinion of the
health plan, or (3) enticing the patient to enroll in a competing
plan.
But physicians say the "gag clauses" distort the  doctor-patient
relationship because they prohibit physicians from explaining to
thier patients that treatment decisions are based on a health
plan's appropriateness standards, treatment guidelines or payment
rules.

"Gag clauses" can range from:

o       A simple clause that says a
physician faces termination for interfering with the plan's
relations with employer groups and business contacts; to
o       A dictum that MDs can't undermine
the confidence of enrollees, potential enrollees, employers, plan
sponsors or others in the plan's quality of care; to
o       A prohibition on physicians
discussing the HMO-provider compensation arrangement, advising
patients to disenroll, or recommending to patients services and
treatments not covered by the plan.

But HMOs have found any "gag clause" hard to  enforce. The only
means of identifying violations:  (1) anomalies in members'
disenrollment patterns;  (2) patient complaints; and (3) comments
on member disenrollment forms.
Industry observers say most HMOs using "gag clauses" will define
allowable physician-patient communications, or get rid of the
clauses altogether.

Clinic Tracks Utilization Through Electronic Record


To track patient utilization and improve allocation of resources,
a multisite Iowa provider group decided to use a computerized
medical record system.
The Iowa Physicians Clinic Medical Foundation will install
computerized medical record systems in about 15 sites around the
state, according to Dr. Mark Purtle, director of internal medicine.
The group has patient record systems up and running, although only
in partial installation, in about half of its sites.
Patient demographics data is collected at registration on a
workstation linked to the central database. The system
automatically updates the patient record. Billing information is
fowarded in daily batches to the database.
Instead of entering encounter notes directly into the record,
physicians record notes, which are then transcribed and entered
into the record.
All clinic sites can access records stored in the central database.
However, each site maintains a server with its own records.
Workstations are located at all physician offices, nurse stations
and registration desks. When the system is fully installed, there
will be workstations in every exam room.
Because the electronic medical record has not yet eliminated the
need for a paper record, the group may use a scanner to create
electronic images of the paper records.
The group hopes to build a complete database of codes and
demographics that tracks encounters by provider and clinic site.
Being able to track seasonal variations in utilization would enable
the group to better plan the number of physicians it needs during
certain periods of the year or the type of physician it would need
in a certain  community.
The group hopes to have the system fully implemented at all its
sites by the end of the year.

Compliance Plans Crucial As Whistleblower Cases Grow


Given several false-claims cases sparked by whistleblowers pending
against major companies, physician managers should take voluntary
disclosure and compliance plans very seriously, a top government
attorney says.
"Health care enterprises, especially bigger ones, need aggressive
compliance policies in place to self-correct [billing problems] and
voluntarily disclose these problems"while they're still small,"
says HHS Inspector General Chief Counsel D. McCarty Thornton.
Thornton says if your company's compliance plan turns up serious
liability, you can take advantage of the feds' voluntary disclosure
program regardless of where you're in business - even though the
program is technically operational only in the five states where
the government is piloting its anti-fraud initiative.

For compliance plans to be meaningful, Thornton says they should:
o       Be "quite elaborate," not a slim
code of conduct that's just "window dressing."
o       Include a hotline so people can
report suspected fraud and other wrongdoing.
o       Track complaints that come over the
hotline, which means assigning them to someone to handle, recording
them and following up.
o       Protect tipsters so they don't fail
to report misconduct because they fear losing their jobs.
o       Assign at least one full-time person
to handle  implementation of the plan.
o       Continually educate all employees on
the ethics of dealing with federal health plans.
o       Require periodic, independent audits
of billing and other practices.
       Have "commitment and attention from
senior level managers," Thornton says.

Firm Tweaks Report Card To Pinpoint CQI Initiatives


An Indianapolis-based home care company this spring will release a
second-generation report card on the satisfaction rates of severely
chronically ill patients.
"Even though we were the first [home care] company to come out with
a [patient satisfaction] report card, there were certain
improvements we could make in methodology and our treatment of data
for the continuous quality improvement process," says Sandra Kretz,
vice president of standards and outcomes for Quantum Health
Resources Inc.
Quantum in 1993 piloted a clinician-developed  patient
satisfaction survey instrument, used in the for-profit company's 40
branches nationwide the following year. Using results from the
spring 1994 national survey of 1,000-plus patients, Quantum
published its first report card in January 1995, outlining patient
satisfaction rates (95.3% overall), and a composite patient
retention rate of 96.1% from 1989 to mid-1994.
Quantum's 1994 survey could not discern old patients from new. But
its 1995 survey targets last year's more than 900 new patients.
Kretz says this ensured a good picture of new patients, with whom
one expects more glitches in satisfaction to occur.
In its effort to reinforce better service patterns companywide,
Quantum feeds survey information back to clinicians, customer
service representatives and its sales force.
Kretz says the 1994 survey identified issues for  improvement,
such as access to an after-hours company contact. 
Although Quantum puts its 24-hour, toll-free number on all patient
material, the company faces a continuing dilemma in alerting
patients on how to contact the company after hours. 
Various interventions include using customer service
representatives to follow up with patients and putting the
telephone number on notepads in patients' medication packets.

Hospital Cuts CABG Costs By $7 Million, LOS by 23%


Saint Joseph's Hospital of Atlanta's involvement in a HCFA national
demonstration project on coronary artery bypass graft (CABG)
surgery highlights its multidisciplinary quality improvement
approach.
The project combines efforts of nurses, surgeons, respiratory
therapists, pharmacists, rehabilitation therapists and others to
cut costs and improve outcomes for post-surgical patients.
Saint Joseph's has performed more than 1,300 CABG surgeries,
decreasing length of stay by 23% without compromising quality, and
saving HCFA more than $7 million since the project's implementation
in July 1993.
CABG patients rank satisfaction at 2.94 on a three-point scale,
above the national average; their mortality rate is 4%, below the
national average; they leave the ICU within 24 hours of surgery
rather than three to four days; and they are discharged in five to
seven days, not seven to 10 days.

Telemedicine Web Site Offers Product Reviews


The Telemedicine Information Exchange World Wide Web site,
maintained by the Telemedicine Research Center of Portland, Ore.,
links users to a telemedicine products and services directory that
catalogs articles on equipment reviews, evaluations or technical
specs.
After selecting a browser, physician managers will have a selection
of three menus: (1) starters; (2) hot items; and (3) searchable
databases.
From the starter menu, users can get the history and definition of
telemedicine, or read case studies on telemedicine in action and
the latest news, including legislative issues and success stories.
Users can also offer feedback on the site.
Under the hot items menu, users can explore the  legal and
ethical issues surrounding telemedicine through the text of current
state legislation, peer- reviewed articles and hypertext links to
other Internet resources.
The searchable databases include information on funding for
telemedicine projects, active projects, and upcoming meetings and
conferences.
The site also offers information on the Telemedicine Research
Center's Clinical Telemedicine Cooperative Group that brings
together researchers nationwide.
The site's home page lets users choose a text-only or a graphic
browser, enabling users to sacrifice aesthetics for the sake of
speed.

HCFA Merging Quality Rules For Medicare, Medicaid Plans


HCFA is working on devising one set of quality standards for both
Medicare and Medicaid managed care plans.
The agency also is considering giving credit to plans that
recently were accredited by private bodies such as National
Committee for Quality Assurance,  according to Jeffrey Kang,
chief medical officer at HCFA's office of managed care.
For example, HCFA would look to see where its standards and NCQA's
overlap, Kang told a recent conference of the Academy of Managed
Care Pharmacy. For these areas, the agency would recognize NCQA's
seal of approval.
But HCFA is concerned that applying a broad set of NCQA measures
"could lose its meaning for Medicare," Kang said. The agency might
identify a subset of measures suitable for Medicare managed care
plans.
NCQA likely won't have Medicare performance measures until HEDIS
3.0 launches in early 1997, says Bruce Fried, director of HCFA's
office of managed care.
As part of that effort, HCFA wants the new quality standards to
replace the 50-50 commercial enrollment composition rule. The
Medicare law and regulations require Medicare HMOs to enroll at
least 50% commercial members. Fried says he hopes to have the new
quality standards in place by July 1997.

Multiprovider Networks Eyed As 1996 Antitrust Target


As health care dealmakers continue to travel uncharted territory,
government regulators and enforcers are watching closely to
determine whether cutting-edge health delivery systems,
collaborations and compensation arrangements comply with the law.
Experts tell physician managers that 1996 will be a year in which
antitrust enforcers will focus on multiprovider networks,
payer-provider collaboration, and most-favored nation clauses. 
Multiprovider networks will be a big focus of Justice's antitrust
enforcement this year, says Gail Kursh, chief of the health care
task force. "We have a number of investigations of multiprovider
arrangements underway," Kursh says.
Last year, in two separate cases, Justice settled antitrust charges
with two PHOs formed with most of the doctors in one-hospital
towns. Those settlements provided the industry with a blueprint for
doing such deals without antitrust violations.
This year, Justice will look at PHOs in multihospital markets and
may strike deals that provide guidance, Kursh says. The kind of
conduct scrutinized includes: (1) hospitals buying too many
physician practices;  (2) hospitals with market power locking up
all referrals in town; and (3) hospitals keeping out competitors by
inducing MDs not to hook up with a new hospital.
Kursh emphasizes, though, that Justice doesn't want to "chill"
deals that spur competition. "Our goal is not to deter
efficiency-enhancing arrangements where they're appropriate," she
says.

Merger-Like Deals to Get More Scrutiny

Observers also predict the FTC and Justice Department will back
away from hospital merger challenges and focus more on integrated
delivery systems, HMOs and physician practice acquisitions.
While traditional hospital mergers may be less of a focus, other
incarnations of hospital collaborations will get more scrutiny.
Justice's Kursh notes that "we're attuned to partnerships or
alliances between hospitals that aren't necessarily mergers."
Her staff is exploring the competitive implications of deals that
look like mergers but aren't, she says. "The question is how do we
analyze them? Are they illegal? Are they joint ventures? Or are
they enough like mergers they should be treated like a merger?
We'll be looking very closely at this area."
