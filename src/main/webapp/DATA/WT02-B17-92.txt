<B>Solar Photocatalytic Hydrogen Production from Water Using a 
Dual-Bed Photosystem;<br>

<P>
In this work, photocatalytic particles are arranged in a dual-bed 
configuration to 
decompose water into its hydrogen and oxygen components using solar 
energy.  The 
experimental system would consist of two modules, each with a shallow, 
flat, sealed container in which micron-sized photocatalytic particles are 
immobilized.  An aqueous solution would then be pumped between the two 
beds.  Different photoparticles and catalysts would be used in the two 
modules to accommodate two different processes:  oxidative 
water-splitting to produce oxygen gas, and reductive water-splitting to 
produce hydrogen.  This is a direct photoconversion scheme that breaks 
down the energy requirements for water decomposition into a two-photon 
process and enables hydrogen and oxygen to be produced separately.
<P>
Several different n-type and p-type semiconductors will be used as 
photoparticles in the 
oxygen- and hydrogen-producing beds, respectively.  Different catalysts 
also will be evaluated to help promote the reactions.  On the microscopic 
level, there are many ways to configure the catalysts and photoparticles 
in the beds, and tests will be done to find the best configuration.  We 
will also try to determine whether the particles should be immobilized on 
an electronically conducting or insulating surface.  Theoretical 
calculations of hydrogen production rates that include the energy band 
structure of free and immobilized particles are expected to provide 
guidance as to how the microstructure of the particles should be 
configured.

Photocatalytic compounds in particulate form are being employed

in a dual-bed configuration to effect the solar-driven decomposition

of water to its constituent elements, particularly hydrogen. 

The system advantages are low manufacturing cost, safe evolution

of H<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> in separate vessels, and more 
efficient use of the

solar spectrum.  Having tested numerous redox couples against

InP and TiO<sub>2</sub>, we may have found two redox couples that can 
effect

O<sub>2</sub>-evolution in one system and H<sub>2</sub>-evolution in the 
other.  They

are iodide/iodate (T/IO<sub>3</sub>) and bromide/bromate 
(Br/BrO<sub>3</sub>).  These

are intrinsically alkaline systems, since they will conproportionate

at neutral pH and below to form the respective halogen gases:

3H<sub>2</sub>O<img src="xspace66.gif" border="0" width="35" height="35" 
alt="spacer" vspace="0" hspace="0">X = I, Br</center>

<P>

The characteristics of these two mediators exemplify what is desired

in a redox mediator.  High solubility, rapid charge transfer kinetics,

optical transparency for both oxidized and reduced forms, and

intermediate redox potential.  The oxidized form (Ox) of the mediator

was run against TiO<sub>2</sub>, while the reduced form (Red) was run 
against

InP.  Now we are testing a more realistic situation, where 
H<sub>2</sub>-evolution

will need to proceed against some background concentration of

Ox, and O<sub>2</sub>-evolution will need to proceed against some 
background

concentration of Red.  Development is under way of methods for

monitoring reaction progress via the mediator instead of H<sub>2</sub> 
or

O<sub>2</sub> gas evolution.
