<h2>Early Results of the Conceptus Non-Surgical Sterilization System Provided at Meeting of RSNA</h2>


SAN CARLOS, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Dec. 2, 1996--Conceptus 
Inc. (NASDAQ:CPTS) announced today the presentation of pre-clinical 
results as well as early clinical data from the Company's trials of 
its non-surgical sterilization system, termed Selective Tubal 
Occlusion Procedure, or S/TOP System.  To date, 28 patients 
undergoing a hysterectomy on the same day had the Conceptus S/TOP 
device implanted.  As presented at the annual meeting of the
Radiological Society of North America (RSNA), eighty-three percent 
of the fallopian tubes that could be accessed in the 
hysteroscopically aided procedure resulted in successful placement 
of the S/TOP System's metal coils.
<p>
 Hysteroscopic and x-ray guidance were used in pre-clinical 
studies which demonstrated that S/TOP was 100 percent successful in 
preventing conception when Conceptus' devices were placed correctly 
and remained in the fallopian tubes of rabbits.  "Each year, more 
than five million women around the world undergo tubal ligation, the 
current surgical sterilization procedure," said Amy S. Thurmond, 
M.D., Associate Professor of Gynecology and Obstetrics, Oregon Health
Sciences University and an early pioneer of the research that led to 
the development of the S/TOP System. "A non-surgical alternative 
that is both effective and without serious complications will have 
significant advantages to already overburdened public health 
programs."  
  <p>
   Dr. Thurmond added, "In the United States, almost half of the 
married women 35 years or older have undergone a surgical fallopian tube 
sterilization, primarily due to the limitations of other methods of 
contraception.
  <p>
   Conceptus' S/TOP System is designed to provide a non-surgical 
approach to fallopian tube sterilization, the most common method of 
permanent contraception worldwide.  This System is intended to be 
permanent, to be performed in the physician's office, and to require 
minimal recovery time.  Original developers of the Company's S/TOP 
System include Dr. Thurmond, Julian Nikolchev, Conceptus's Chief 
Technical Officer, and a team of engineers at Conceptus.  
   <p>
  Upon insertion, the S/TOP System's medical grade metal coils are 
designed to alter the architecture of the fallopian tube lumen and 
impede their normal function, including the movement of egg and 
sperm, thereby preventing pregnancy.  Transcervical device placement 
in the fallopian tubes is being evaluated with hysteroscopic, 
ultrasound or x-ray guidance and Conceptus' proprietary non-surgical 
tubal access technology.
 <p>
    "There is a significant pent-up demand for an alternative method 
of female sterilization especially for one that does not require 
hospitalization or abdominal incisions.  I am confident that S/TOP 
will be an effective method of sterilization," said Jay Cooper, 
M.D., OB/GYN Consultants, Ltd., Phoenix Baptist Medical Center, 
Phoenix, Arizona, and principal investigator of Conceptus' S/TOP 
System.
  <p>
   In September of 1995, Conceptus initiated its clinical trial 
program with tests of its S/TOP System in women undergoing same-day 
hysterectomy.  Recently, the U.S. Food & Drug Administration granted 
approval of an IDE (Investigational Device Exemption) to initiate an 
additional trial for patients who will undergo placement of 
Conceptus's sterilization coil in each fallopian tube six to twelve 
weeks prior to hysterectomy.  In vivo device stability and mechanism 
of action will be evaluated.
   <p>
  Conceptus, Inc. designs, develops and markets innovative, 
minimally invasive medical devices for the interventional gynecology 
market.  The Company's initial focus is on the development of 
systems to improve the diagnosis and treatment of uterine and fallopian
tube diseases and disorders.
  <p>
   Except for the historical information contained herein, the 
matters discussed in this press release are forward-looking 
statements, the accuracy of which is necessarily subject to risks 
and uncertainties.  The receipt of regulatory approvals and clinical 
efficacy of and market demand for products, among other matters 
discussed in this release, may differ significantly from the
discussion of such matters in the forward-looking statements.  
Actual results may be affected by, among other things, risk and 
uncertainties related to new product development and introduction 
cycles, research and development activities, delays by regulatory 
authorities, scientific advances by Conceptus or third parties, 
introduction of competitive products, third party reimbursement and 
physician training, as well as those factors set forth in the 
Company's prospectus, dated February 1, 1996.
