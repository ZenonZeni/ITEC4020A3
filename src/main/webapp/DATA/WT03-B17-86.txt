<H1>AMAZON RIVER BASINS<BR>
Rio Negro Tributary:</H1>
This year we visited the flooded rain forest again with a twelve day expedition 600 miles up the Amazon's Rio Negro tributary.  This region is untouched by modern development and is still like the 19th century Amazon.  It is also generally off limits to tourists because of its inaccessibility and the required local special permission procedures.<BR><BR>

<B>Flooded rain forest plains:</B><BR>
The diving took place in flooded rain forest plains and clear water streams that provide a very rare window into the aquatic life of the Amazon.  With the help of locals, participants discovered and became the first to explore several of these streams.  The team had an exclusive opportunity to dive with caymans, turtles, snakes, piranhas and an incredible diversity of freshwater tropical fish.  The project also resulted in several hours of documentary video including some first-time-ever footage.
