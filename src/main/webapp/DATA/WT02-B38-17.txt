RAYMOND JAMES MOVES INTO TRADITIONAL BANKING FIRST: HERE COME THE
BROKER-DEALERS

In the financial equivalent of "man bites dog," Raymond
James Financial Inc. has underway a major thrust into traditional banking
services via its wholly owned bank, Raymond James Bank. The St. Petersburg-
based financial conglomerate will offer in February FDIC-insured products
like checking and savings accounts. And, in a few months the bank will
market home equity lines of credit, and, possibly, residential mortgages.
     If all goes well, the securities dealer's bank might become
the nation's largest virtual bank. Theresa Schefstad, the president and CEO
of Raymond James Bank, promises to reach her market "telephonically and
electronically. Our objective is to provide consolidated financial services
so all (customers') financial services can be received from our firm," she
said.
     The bank's initial target market will be the securities
company's hefty customer base of some 300,000 clients.
     "We'll be able to offer our clients several product
choices. We have the FDIC option, our credit interest program (sweep
account) option, and the third is our Heritage mutual funds," Schefstad
explained. The Heritage funds are Raymond James' proprietary mutual funds.
     The company will continue its tradition of not providing
additional incentive to brokers selling top proprietary products.
"Compensation is consistent for all three product options," Schefstad said.
This compensation practice appears to have worked to the detriment of the
Heritage fund family, where growth of the individual funds has fallen
behind other brokerage house proprietary funds, despite the company's
nationwide branch network.
     Schefstad said that James is the only broker/dealer to
wholly own a full-service bank. Unlike other nonbanking companies, which
must resort to the "nonbank bank" strategy to get into the banking
business, James purchased the bank branches with a total deposit base of
$12 million from the Resolution Trust Co. In May, 1994 the company
chartered the Raymond James Bank FSB, which has a capability to operate in
all 50 states.
     The bank ended 1995 with approximately $162 million in
assets and $136 million in deposits.
     Over the past 20 months, Schefstad, the bank staff has been
wrestling with regulatory approvals, developing disclosure policies and
integrating the bank's systems into the Raymond James computer network.
     "Because of who owns us, we've had to obtain regulatory
approval for everything we've done. For example, when we developed our
consolidated statement, we received approval (beforehand) of our disclosure
policy and separation of accounts," Schefstad said.
     The bank will maintain a physical branch office near its
headquarters in Florida. Schefstad envisions the remainder of the bank's
efforts taking place electronically, particularly through the nationwide
automated teller machine networks. Of course, deposit-taking via the ATM
has yet to gain wide acceptance, but Schefstad said the firm's brokerage
clients are sophisticated enough to understand and use direct-deposit
options available through the automated clearing house system.--John J.

SECOND PUERTO RICAN DEAL CAPS DECEMBER CALENDAR

Eying the market throughout 1995, FirstBank of Puerto Rico
became the second bank from the island to issue subordinated debt in
December.
     The state-chartered commercial bank completed a $100
million offering of 10-year subordinated notes that priced at 200 basis
points over Treasurys for a coupon of 7.625% at 99.277 to yield 7.730%. The
notes, which carry a split rating of Baa3/BB-plus, carried 144A language,
enabling a public-style execution of the offering without registration at
the Securities & Exchange Commission. The relatively rich spread resulted
from S&P rating the issue just below investment grade, said Annie Astor,
chief financial officer.
     The need for Tier 2 capital and the exceptionally low rates
in December, dropping below 6%, were the key factors prompting FirstBank to
issue the bonds, according to Astor. The deal represents the bank's first
independent bond offering.
     Jefferies & Co. captured the leading underwriting position
on the deal because of  its relationship with the bank, and Smith Barney
Inc. acted as co-manager. The private notes were purchased by about 15
insurance companies.
     Investors were attracted to the offering in large part by
the bank's phenomenal growth over the last five years, in which it has had
an average return on assets of 8% and a return on equity of 25%. Since the
bank's initial public offering in January 1987, the stock has appreciated
in value by 1200%, Astor said. Headquartered in San Juan, the $2.4 billion
asset bank switched from a thrift charter to a commercial bank charter last
year.
     The deal for First Bank follows a first-time subordinated
offering by another Puerto Rican bank that was completed earlier in the
month. BanPonce Corp., rated Baa2/BBB, originally offered $100 million in
10-year subordinated notes, and later increased the public offering to $125
million. That deal, which priced at 105 basis points over comparable
Treasurys, was underwritten entirely by CS First Boston (see CFO Alert
12/11/95, P.5)

SUSQUEHANNA ADDING DEBT TO EQUITY TO FUND ACQUISITION

Seeking to fund its expansion efforts, Susquehanna
Bancshares Inc. recently issued shares of common stock and is prepping an
offering of senior notes that is expected to hit the market at the end of
January.
     "We're in the process of acquiring a thrift in Maryland for
$63 million, and we don't have that cash on hand," said J. Stanley Mull,
vice president of the Treasury at Susquehanna. The acquisition of Fairfax
Corp., located in Baltimore, follows the thrift acquisitions last April of
Atlantic Federal Savings Bank and Reisters Town Federal Savings Bank.
     Including the greenshoe option, a total of 1.495 million
shares were issued at $26.50 per share, or $25.31 after underwriting fees,
for proceeds of $37.8 million, Mull said. Oppenheimer & Co. led the
offering, followed by Keefe, Bruyette & Woods Inc. and Legg Mason Wood
Walker Inc.
     Susquehanna chose Oppenheimer as lead on the deal because
of advisory services the investment bank had provided in the past, Mull
said, noting that Keefe, Bruyette added a strong, bank-market name to the
deal, and Legg Mason provided strong distribution in the Maryland area,
where many of the bonds were sold. Around two-thirds of the offering was
sold at the retail level, and the rest to institutional investors.
     Susquehanna anticipates approaching the debt market later
in January to offer up to $35 million in senior debt, the proceeds of which
will also be devoted to the acquisition, Mull said. He noted that a
maturity for the notes had yet to be determined. Oppenheimer and Keefe
Bruyette will underwrite the offering.
     Susquehanna Bancshares Inc., which has $3 billion in assets
in both Pennsylvania and Maryland, operates six commercial banks. It
recently formed a subsidiary, Susquehanna Bancshares Inc. South, to act as
the holding company for the thrift assets.

BANK BONDS ON TOP: ONE AWESOME YEAR

Returns on bonds issued by banking institutions climbed to
remarkable heights in 1995 -- relatively speaking. Whether they can sustain
last year's pace, however, is another story.
     Aggregate total returns reached 21.85%, topped by single-A
rated banks, which found a return of 22.11%. Although the total return for
corporates overall was higher at 22.24%, duration adjusted returns,
considered a more accurate measure, showed bank bonds besting virtually all
other corporate and government securities (see table on P. 2).
     Still, the heights to which bank returns climbed are
relative to their starting point at the beginning of the year.
     "Banks were cheaper going in, so there was a big upside,"
said Anne Robinson, a fixed income analyst at Bear Stearns. She added that
bank spreads widened considerably toward the end of 1994, largely due to
Federal Reserve interest rate hikes earlier in the year.
     Spreads on bank bonds are strongly correlated to interest
rates, due to the interest rate sensitivity of banks' businesses, which may
account for some widening of spreads in the third quarter 1995. At that
time, minor concerns of inflation were sparked. Shortly after, however,
positive inflation numbers were released, a number of large banks announced
mergers, and there was significant purchasing of U.S. Treasurys by the
Japanese central bank, which drove rates down. These factors all worked to
tighten spreads in the fourth quarter, actually doubling returns from the
previous quarter,  to nearly record levels. However, investors see little
room for improvement in the bank bond market, at least compared to other
corporate bonds.
     "Our view is that spreads are at fairly narrow levels, and
there's not much room for upside," said Mike O'Brien, a banking analyst at
Fidelity. He noted that while there has been some deterioration in banking
fundamentals, such as credit quality, those fundamentals are still very
strong. "An investor wouldn't be overweighting in the bank sector, but
probably wouldn't be getting out either. The sector may not perform as well
as before, but we don't think it will have problems."
     O'Brien further noted that consolidation in the industry,
which has been a driving factor behind the rally, appears to be winding
down somewhat, and that upside stemming from ratings upgrades has probably
leveled off.
     "The sector is balancing out at high single-A -- it's hard
to get excited about the sector," O'Brien said. He noted that Fidelity is
focusing on shorter-maturity debt  --  buying five-year paper rather than
20-year -- to guard against spreads potentially widening later in the year.
     Robinson generally agreed with O'Brien's prognosis of the
bank sector, noting that there is only a 30-basis point spread difference
between the best and weakest banks. That compares to a 45-basis point
difference at this time last year.
     "We don't see spreads tightening any further. But an
investor can still make money in banks if rates go down later in the year,"
she said.

POTENTIAL FUNDING DILEMMA: MIXED MESSAGES FROM FASB

Banks that left securities in the held-to-maturity category
of Financial Accounting Standard 115 during the recently provided transfer
window, with the intention of using those securities later to do repurchase
agreement transactions, may find that strategy closed to them if a proposed
standard from the Financial Accounting Standards Board is enacted in its
current form.
     The proposed standard was issued as an exposure draft
around the same time that FASB provided banks with a window to transfer
securities currently classified as held to maturity into the available-for-
sale category without a penalty. The window of opportunity in FAS 115,
Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, closed at
the end of 1995, after which such transfers are strictly prohibited. The
proposed treatment for longer-term repos likely influenced held-to-maturity
designations under FAS 115 during the restructuring window, and will
continue to do so.
     For example, a financial manager may have intended to use a
five-year bond classified in held to maturity as collateral in a repo
transaction next year. However, that may not be possible under the same
favorable terms if the proposed statement becomes an accounting standard,
and so the manager may have chosen to use one of the other two categories
instead.
     Banking institutions typically designate securities used
for longer-term repos into the held-to-maturity category,  where unrealized
gains and losses needn't be marked to market. However, the proposed
statement would require any repos with a maturity of three months or more
to be recorded as a sale, and hence marked to market. Banks would thereby
be limited to using repos with maturities of less than three months, which
are still liabilities under the proposed statement. The proposed sale
treatment for longer-term repos increases volatility in capital and would
suddenly have to appear in the income statement when the rule comes into
effect. The proposed transition date currently is Dec. 15, 1996.
     "This is a major concern for our industry," said Marti
Sworobuk at America's Community Bankers. "Smaller banks and thrifts depend
on repos for general banking operations. Many of our members believe that
the proposed standard would do away with repos beyond three months and
increase their costs by at least 30-40 basis points."
     These institutions can also turn to the Federal Home Loan
Bank system for advances, although that is a more expensive source of
funding. In addition, Sworobuk noted, the future of the FHLB as an easily
accessible and available funding source is uncertain given the current
political climate.
     FASB  has noted that the three-month maturity limit on
repos is a period that was arrived at arbitrarily, largely because the
Board believed that the vast majority of repo transactions held far shorter
maturities.
     "We've since learned that there are more transactions with
durations around three months than we thought," said Halsey Bullen, the
project manager at FASB. He noted that the Board generally attempts to
derive arbitrary thresholds where there is a low concentration of business
activity, in order to avoid dramatic differences in accounting requirements
for many similar transactions. FASB will likely reconsider the three-month
limit as it continues its deliberations.
     Following the comment deadline Jan. 22, FASB will hold a
public hearing toward the end of February. As of the middle of last week,
the accounting standard setter had received about 25 comments, most of
which were notifications to testify at the public hearing.
     America's Community Bankers was preparing last week a
letter to FASB in order to express the views of its constituents.  The
trade group recently surveyed members with assets of $1 billion or more for
their views on the proposed statement, and found that many banks believe
the standard would eliminate a source of cheap, long-term funding. A large
savings bank in Wisconsin noted that it intends to extend its use of repos
out to one or two years, and that the proposed change would negatively
influence its operations.
     "To make a long story short, they're all saying that they
would have to shorten maturities and go to a higher-cost-of-funding
source," Sworobuk said.

BUYBACKS DROP OFF IN '95 MERGER MANIA

The heady volume of stock repurchase programs announced by
banks slackened in 1995 from the previous year, while repurchase programs
announced by thrifts more than doubled in the same period, according to
Securities Data  Co.
     The volume of announced programs in 1995 fell 25% from the
year before to just over $20 billion, a drop that surprised analysts, who
noted possible reasons including frenetic merger activity and heady stock
values.
     Observers of the savings and loan industry attributed the
nearly 140% increase in the volume of stock repurchases announced by
thrifts to factors that have been affecting banks for some time, including
the need to use capital and control burgeoning earnings-per-share and
return-on-equity ratios.
     Perhaps the most important reason, they said, was to ward
off acquirers seeking assets on the cheap.
     Marni Pont, an analyst at Keefe Bruyette & Woods Inc., said
that stock buybacks can prohibit banks from engaging in stock poolings, a
complication experienced by First Bank System in its efforts to acquire
First Interstate. She noted that banks may thus have decided to limit their
buybacks in favor of poolings, a strategy confirmed by the treasurer of a
regional bank whose institution recently chose to cut short its announced
buyback for that very reason.
     Another reason, Pont noted, was the rapidly rising values
of bank stocks, which, according to Keefe's KBI 50, provided an average
total return in 1995 of 60.02%.
     Yet despite a total return of 63% in 1995, AmSouth Bancorp.
decided to pursue a stock buyback last fall in order provide shares for its
employee benefit and stock plans.
     "You can generate a fairly good internal rate of return
(through a buyback) because the increase you achieve in EPS and ROE seems
to offset any cost that you incur through book value dilution," said List
Underwood, head of finance at the bank.

BANK GROUPS JOIN ARMS AGAINST FILING PENALTIES

Representatives of the nation's lending industries have
joined together to oppose a Clinton administration proposal for a plan they
believe will raise the penalties for failing to file, or filing
inaccurately, so-called "information returns," -- the infamous 1099s.
     These forms are used by lenders to report payments of
dividends, interest and interest accrued on accounts but not precisely
paid. For example, the original issue discount on certificates of deposit,
U.S. government securities or similar instruments.
     The Clinton administration proposal sprang out of the
budget stalemate that has persisted over the last several weeks. The
administration submitted a proposal to the Republican leadership in
Congress Dec. 7 as an alternative to Republican calls for deep cuts in the
federal budget. The proposal outlines increases in miscellaneous fees and
the closing of certain loopholes. Aimed more at stirring indigination than
winning congressional support, the proposal includes several other
provisions that the administration knew would be opposed by powerful
corporate interests. For example, it calls for federal banking regulators
to impose examination fees on state-chartered banks.
     The provision at issue appeared to be limited to payments
for services that were reportable on Form 1099-MISC. However, according to
a letter to Secretary of the Treasury Robert Rubin dated Jan. 2, the
lenders said that an explanation provided by the Joint Committee on
Taxation Dec. 15 indicated a provision with much broader scope.
     Those signing onto the letter include Credit Union National
Association, the American Bankers Association, the American Land Title
Association, America's Community Bankers, the Independent Bankers
Association of America, the Investment Company Institute, the National
Association of Realtors, the Public Securities Association and the
Securities Industry Association.
     The implication is that even if the proposal had merit, it
is unlikely to be supported in Congress--especially in an election year.
However, given that this is not a normal budget process, the groups are
joining together to marshall their muscle out of fear that in a late night
deal, the provision could be swept into a compromise--at great cost to
lenders of all stripes.
     The letter says the industries "strongly oppose" the
administration's plan.

CITICORP ISSUES FIRST SUB DEAL IN STORMY NEW YEAR

Finance officials overcame the snow drifts and icy roads
after last week's blizzard to complete the first subordinated transaction
of the new year.
     Citicorp issued $250 million in 10-year subordinated notes.
Rated A2/A, the paper priced at 62.5 basis points over comparable Treasurys
for a coupon of 6.375% at 99.672 to yield 6.42%. The issue carries a bullet
repayment.
     The deal was led by Salomon Brothers, followed by co-
managers Bear Stearns, Citicorp Securities, Goldman Sachs and Merrill
Lynch.
     The new year has been relatively quiet in the bank bond
market, despite talk the week before last of a stockpile of deals ready to
hit the market and take advantage of still relatively low rates. In fact,
investment bankers said that more offerings might have hit the market last
week had the storm arrived in lesser force. Interest rates also jumped
during the week and the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged on consecutive
days.
     Still, the Citicorp deal was said to have met with mild
resistance in the market, requiring a series of swaps to complete the deal
in a timely fashion once the issue began trading.
     Sources predicted a number of offerings approaching the
market this week and the next. Meridian Bancorp Inc., headquartered in
Reading, PA, was rumored to be preparing to hit the market shortly.

SEGMENT ACCOUNTING RULES NEAR ISSUE

Accounting standards-setters in the United States and
Canada plan to follow their global counterpart this week by issuing draft
rules governing when businesses must disclose financial information about
their regional operations and product lines.
     The North Americans' exposure drafts on what are usually
referred to as "segment reporting" or "disaggregated disclosures" are
slightly less onerous than the one released Dec. 20 by the London-based
International Accounting Standards Committee. While the IASC draft could
require disclosures based on certain parameters, the identical drafts to be
issued by America's Financial Accounting Standards Board and the Canadian
Institute of Chartered Accountants goes no further than to press for
companies to report segments based on how they break down their operations.
     This difference of opinion has been going for at least a
year, and officials from all three groups are expected to engage in more
haggling on the issue this summer. Comments on all three sets of proposals
will be due June 30.
     Once it becomes a standard, the segment reporting rule
promises to shed more light on how and where banks make their money. And
the rule became even more important last month when Deutsche Bank announced
it would start publishing its group results according to International
Accounting Standards. That will mark the end of the use of so-called hidden
reserves to smooth out balance sheets.
     Under the IASC's exposure draft, companies would provide at
least one breakdown of risks and returns based on business or geographical
lines. In most cases, the actual one used should be whatever way internal
financial reports are sent to the CEO, the IASC said.
     The North American approach also starts with the way a
business views itself, but unlike the IASC it stops there. "IASC ...
recognizes the fact that this information does not always reflect the
dominant source and nature of risks and returns," wrote Paul Pacter, IASC's
project manager. "In certain cases, therefore, information needs to be
modified for external reporting purposes."-- Craig Webb
