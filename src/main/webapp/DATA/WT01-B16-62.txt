<P>All industrial activities, including generation of electricity, produce waste.  These wastes have to be stored and disposed of in ways which safeguard human health and protect the environment.  One of the key questions asked about nuclear power production is whether the industry can manage its waste safely and economically.
<P>
Nuclear power differs from other thermal electricity generation, for example burning fossil fuels, in producing a much larger amount of energy from a much smaller amount of fuel.  This means that it gives rise to a much smaller volume of waste, even when the extra waste produced when reactors are decommissioned is taken into account.  However, much of this waste is radioactive and, like many other wastes, could be damaging to health and the environment if not properly managed.
<P>
Different kinds of radioactive waste have very different levels of radioactivity and therefore very different management requirements.  A large proportion of all radioactive waste is of similar to or not very much higher radioactivity than the natural background.  A small proportion of the rest is highly radioactive and requires particularly careful management. 
Even this highly radioactive waste is not dangerous for ever, because radioactivity decays over time.  However, management must take account of long term safety, since some radioisotopes take a very long time to decay.  This long term decay, which can take millions of years, focused attention for the first time on the need for some wastes to be managed for a very long time beyond the lifetime of those who generated the waste.  Long-lived radioactive waste was the first type of persistently dangerous waste for which this need, and the questions it raises about equity between generations, were considered, leading to measures being taken to safeguard future generations.  Now the need for long term management for some other, non-radioactive, wastes, which may never lose their toxicity, is becoming more widely appreciated. 
<P>
Final disposal is only the last step in the waste management process, after collection, treatment, conditioning, storage and transport - steps which are technically well developed to a high level.  For highly radioactive waste, since heat output and radioactivity reduce with time, storage of the waste for some decades before final disposal greatly simplifies the technical requirements for it, and reduces radiological risks.  Final disposal facilities for this waste were therefore not required at once.  However, the consequent delay in putting them into place and the variety of facilities proposed, together with public confusion about the differences in the kinds of waste, have led to a widespread misconception that the nuclear industry does not know what to do with its waste, nor what the cost of dealing with it will be.  This has led to questions about the viability of the nuclear industry.  There is no technical reason for further delay in preparing to construct final disposal facilities, and therefore site investigations are needed now. 
<P>This paper reviews what the different types of waste are, what the technical consensus is on the requirements for their safe management, and how the present state of knowledge developed.  It describes in a little more depth how radioactive waste management is practised and planned within the fuel cycle and then indicates the moderate scale of the costs in relation to the total cost of producing electricity.  Country annexes give more information about what is being done in a selection of countries, in order to indicate how radioactive waste management is carried out in practice.
