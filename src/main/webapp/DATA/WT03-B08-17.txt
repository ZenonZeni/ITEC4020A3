C&L SPAIN MAY SUE E&Y OVER RAID

Coopers & Lybrand in Spain may sue Ernst & Young following E&Y's
surprise attack on C&L's consulting division. On November 16, six of
C&L's 12 consulting partners, including the division's managing partner
Jose Ramon Magarzo, and three senior consultants, announced their
decision to leave the firm and join Ernst & Young. Since then, a
further 70 consultants have jumped ship, bringing the total number of
departures, as MCI went to press, to about 80. In addition, some seven
to eight administrative staff have switched firms.

The defections, which took C&L completely by surprise, have struck a
severe blow to the firm's thriving consulting business which reported
turnover of Pta2.67 billion ($22 million) in 1995 - nearly three times
that of E&Y. According to C&L's spokesperson, the firm had just
returned to profitability after several difficult years during Spain's
recession.

Magarzo has already taken up his new position as managing director of
E&Y Consultores, replacing Michael McKay who becomes associate managing
director. In all, the first batch of nine people who left C&L have been
made partners at E&Y.

"From Ernst & Young's point of view, this was part of a plan we started
a couple of years ago when I came from the US, and that was to increase
the size of E&Y in Spain," McKay said. "It became clear to us that to
achieve the growth, we needed to become a competitive force. We
couldn't do it through internal growth, we needed external resources at
a senior level. That included bringing in as managing director a
Spaniard who would run the practice."

E&Y used an executive search firm to identify potential hires, but did
not specifically target C&L, McKay said. He said the ex- C&L partners
were attracted to E&Y in part because Ernst & Young Consultores is a
separate firm with its own profit pool.

The raid is by no means E&Y's first attempt to build a strong
consulting arm in Spain. Two previous efforts - the creation of a
consulting division when Ernst & Whinney and Arthur Young merged in
1990 and the 1993 establishment of E&Y Consultores with the financial
backing of E&Y in the US - have not been as successful as the firm
would have liked. In 1995, E&Y had consulting turnover of only Pta895
million and is reported to have suffered substantial losses.

Although head-hunting operations are not uncommon, the scale of E&Y's
raid is without precedent and has been perceived by C&L as a direct
attempt to steal a large slice of its business and seriously damage the
firm. C&L accuses E&Y of inducing its former partners to break their
legal commitments to the firm by offering financial compensation to
staff to leave C&L without giving the legally-required 15 days' notice.

This is denied by McKay."We believe we have acted in accordance with
the laws and contractual obligations of all the people. We have not
taken any projects from them, we have not taken any clients from them.
The people who have joined us have joined us of their own free will and
exercised their professional rights in the marketplace."

C&L believes E&Y's action infringes a number of fair trade rulings laid
down by Spain's competition laws and is considering legal action
against E&Y as well as individual proceedings against the former
partners. E&Y denies any attempt to steal C&L's current projects and
has offered to `lend' C&L its former consultants to finish projects
already in hand, an offer which C&L describes as cynical and not worthy
of consideration.

KPMG CONSULTING DRIVES 1995 GROWTH UP

Consulting drove growth at KPMG during 1995 with consulting revenues up
by 28 percent to $1.5 billion. Overall revenues for the firm were $7.5
billion, up 13 percent over 1994.

The strong growth in consulting and elsewhere comes as KPMG repositions
itself as a professional services advisory firm. However, it should be
borne in mind that the figures reflect total billings to clients, not
net fee income as KPMG has reported in the past.

In 1994, KPMG reported net fee income of $990 million in consulting and
$6.1 billion in firm-wide revenues. Also in 1994, the firm redefined
consulting services to include compensation and benefits and tax
consulting services. MCI estimated KPMG's 1994 management consulting
revenues at $875 million (MCI 70).

In 1995, the US consulting practice performed best, posting growth of
37 percent to $830 million (MCI 73). Growth in Europe was
"substantially better" after a relatively flat year in 1994 due to
restructuring, according to Keith Fuller, international head of the
Management Consulting Services committee.

Asia Pacific also performed well although from a relatively small base.
Further expansion is planned there. While Fuller would not reveal
target markets, the likely candidates are Japan, Korea, Singapore, Hong
Kong and perhaps Malaysia.

As part of its shift to a professional services advisory firm, KPMG now
refers to consultative rather than consulting services. According to
Fuller, consultative services fall into five categories: strategy and
financial management (including value- based management); performance
improvement; package implementation like SAP; enabling technologies
such as mobile computing, networks, technology infrastructure and
client/server; and tax consulting services.

"One of our objectives worldwide is to substantially increase our rate
of penetration in our existing client base. We believe that we can
provide a substantial increased volume of service to clients . . . and
can provide better value to them as well."

The professional services advisory approach involves both an industry
and a specific functional focus. This is very different from
traditional cross-selling of consulting and audit services, Fuller
stressed. "Professional services advisory is where a traditional
service provider couples a better understanding of the client with
multi-disciplinary support to determine where the client has an
opportunity to improve profitability."

For example, two tax experts were involved in a recent business process
re-engineering and technology assignment for an insurance company and
produced savings for the client which would otherwise have been missed.

"Historically, I don't know if we would have found that. Or maybe the
client wouldn't have gone forward. But because we can approach this by
professional service, we can do it at a lower cost and higher value,"
Fuller said.

"We've not done away with functional specialities, we're just
approaching clients and the market differently," he added."I think this
is the model all clients will expect from their professional advisers
in future."

The multi-disciplinary industry-focused teams which KPMG has introduced
in the US and UK will continue to be rolled out around the globe with
the French, Dutch and German practices, among others, already moving in
that direction, he said.

KPMG also plans to continue expanding the types of services offered to
clients through alliances such as the one in 1995 with a US investment
firm to which KPMG licensed its name (KPMG BayMark). Other alliances
will be with academics and thought leaders - and in outsourcing, he
said.

In several countries, the firm is exploring outsourcing in the process
management area. But, Fuller said, there are no plans to follow EDS or
Andersen Consulting into the IT outsourcing arena.

UNITED KINGDOM:  50 JOBS LOST AT TOUCHE DUE TO D&T MERGER

Fifty consultants, mostly seniors, have lost their jobs at Touche Ross
in the run-up to the merger of the UK consulting practice with Deloitte
& Touche Consulting Group in the US.

Most of the cuts were in the information technology side of the
practice. They involved 26 consultants who were made redundant and 24
who were either redeployed in other parts of the firm or found
positions with clients. Touche now has 542 consultants, a reduction of
nearly 9 percent.

Four partners are also leaving the consultancy practice. One is Andrew
Davis, head of Touche Ross's IT consulting practice and 1992 president
of the Management Consultancies Association, who is retiring due to ill-
health. Three others will move to other parts of the firm, according to
John Everett, head of the UK practice.

No further cuts are expected, he added.

The cuts reflect a market shift away from high-level IT strategy work
and towards implementation assignments which require fewer seniors but
utilise a larger number of junior staff, Everett said.

They follow a major reorganisation within the consulting practice
earlier this year which saw the establishment of dedicated sales and
marketing teams in key industry sectors, and the creation of a separate
management advisory service (MAS) unit to provide management
consulting, tax and accounting advice to small and medium clients. The
MAS unit is now part of the audit side of the firm (MCI 73).

The cuts also pave the way for the proposed US-UK-Canada alliance which
will form the first leg of Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu International's
proposed global consulting firm (MCI 74). The practices have begun
working together at an operational level, although the legalities will
probably not be completed until June, Everett said.

A new management team comprising the heads of the UK, Canada and three
regional US consulting practices is being established to run the merged
operation, Everett said. Pat Laconto, head of the US consulting
practice, is expected to be the new chief executive.

AT&T HIRES THREE MORE TOP EXECUTIVES

AT&T Solutions has hired three more executives with strong consulting
backgrounds to round out the top tier of its consulting team. This now
includes the managing partners of each of its three business units
(consulting, systems integration and outsourcing), a global practice
director and a vice-president in charge of worldwide marketing.

In November, the group announced that it had filled all those posts
with the hiring of the following:

- Dick Anderson, managing partner for the systems integration practice.
Formerly chief technology officer for Kwasha Lipton, a benefits
consulting firm, and before that a principal at McKinsey.

- John Corsiglia, managing partner and global practice director.
Formerly president of BDM Technologies, the IT consulting and systems
integration subsidiary of BDM International, and a partner at McKinsey.

- Fred Lawrence, market management vice-president, responsible for
growth in vertical industry and geographical markets. Formerly a
private investor and a consulting managing partner with Arthur Andersen
& Co.

The other managing partners on the team are James Corey who runs
consulting and Rick Roscitt, who is in charge of the outsourcing
practice. They all work out of the group's Washington, DC,
headquarters.

The team has been charged by Solutions's president and chief executive
Victor Millar with carrying the group's aggressive focus on "electronic
commerce" into the crowded services marketplace and into the group's
second year.

"We think of electronic commerce as not just offering [access to] the
Internet, electronic invoices or a page on the World Wide Web, but
changing the rules of competition for our clients," Corey said. "All
industries will go through major strategic change enabled by electronic
commerce. That's really the scope of our Solutions business. . . Our
differentiator is to be bold and innovative in our thinking."

The new executives are not the group's only new hires. Despite the
recently-announced split of AT&T into three new companies and top-to-
bottom lay-offs and buy-outs, AT&T Solutions continues to grow. A
spokesman said the only impact the buy-outs might have on Solutions
would be in outsourcing, the largest practice within Solutions. A small
portion of this practice might be affected, he said.

At the end of 1995, AT&T Solutions had about 350 consultants on board
and anticipates hiring another 2,500 in 1996. The "business thinkers"
will come from outside the parent company but some of the technology
skills are already available within AT&T, Corey said. "The market
demand for this type of service is very powerful right now. We are
clearly resource-constrained, not demand-constrained," Corey said.

It is that combination of AT&T's technological and innovation skills
combined with the consultants' business expertise that will make AT&T
Solutions stand out in the market, he said.

CANADA:  MCI BOOSTS PROFILE WITH SHL ACQUISITION

With its acquisition of the Canadian information technology services
company, SHL Systemhouse, MCI Communications Corporation has boosted
its profile in the network management and outsourcing business, and
given the newly-combined organisation the tools to compete in the
booming services market.

The $1 billion deal, which was wrapped up in November, combines SHL
with MCI's Professional Services Organization in a new group called
"Enterprise Management Services". This will offer a single source for
communications, computing and consulting services. Details are still
being worked out, but essentially, EMS will design, operate and manage
communications and computing networks. MCI estimates the US market for
such services at $40 billion and growing at 20 percent per year.

"The whole idea is the single source provider for the ongoing
management of the computer network," said SHL spokesman Rick Gray.

SHL will continue to operate as a stand-alone company with its own
corporate identity within MCI, Gray said. It has 4,500 "consultants"
and had about $1 billion in revenue in 1995, Gray said. In addition to
joint offerings with MCI, SHL will continue to develop and manage
client/server solutions for companies moving away from centralised
mainframe systems.

SHL saw the deal as a good way to give it the size and scale needed to
grow in the IT services market. "It gives us further global reach,
because MCI is more expansive on a global basis," Gray said.

"It also gives us the marketing prowess and power of the MCI company.
They are a very savvy marketing company and certainly that will help to
push the services into the marketplace. And third, with a much larger
company like MCI, a company that has a lot of money in the bank, you
are fortifying your whole financial position. You make yourself a well-
heeled competitor with the deep pockets that help in this kind of
business."

MCI, one of the world's largest communications companies, reports $13
billion in annual revenue and a broad array of services, from long
distance to Internet access to outsourcing. Revenues for its
professional services unit were not available.

"As far as what MCI brings to this partnership, it is our data
capabilities which complement what SHL brings to the partnership in
terms of computing solutions," said MCI spokesman Jim Monroe. "The
expertise of our Professional Services Organization and the computing
expertise of SHL enables MCI and SHL to offer a desktop-to-desktop
management."

IBM FOCUSES ON NETWORK-CENTRIC COMPUTING

The new buzz word at International Business Machines is "network-
centric computing" and the struggling computer giant's consulting group
has become an integral part of that focus, according to the firm.

IBM chairman Louis Gerstner said in November that IBM is "betting its
future" on the popularity of network-based computer systems. He
believes IBM has the technological and consulting talent needed to help
it regain its stature in a rapidly-changing technological world.

IBM Consulting Group has been playing a key role in supporting the
execution of that strategy, said Joseph Movizzo, the group's general
manager.

"There were pieces of it that we had started, like business recovery
and the systems management business," he said. "So we had some
initiatives in place that now have to be expanded because they have
taken on a more critical role. The network- centric environment is
going to have a profound impact on the business. Any consulting firm
could say, `We've been doing some of that.' But now it becomes a
different way of thinking about [our] business."

The consulting group was formed in 1992 when IBM recruited Robert Howe
from Booz-Allen & Hamilton and Stephen Mucchetti from Coopers & Lybrand
to develop the new business (MCI 41). But the group has struggled as it
tried to find focus and collaborate with a broad spectrum of products-
oriented divisions.

Since then, it has become more integrated into the IBM framework and
now operates as part of IBM's complex matrix of products and services
divisions. In 1994, Mucchetti and Howe were named heads of industry
groups and Movizzo took over as general manager but in a redefined role
with diminished responsibilities (MCI 66).

Shifting these early founders into running businesses was not a matter
of sidelining them, but of putting them into "major roles
said.

"What people don't realize is what a dramatic change that was in our go-
to-market model," Movizzo said. "Part of this is getting people to
think in a non-hierarchical sense. What is a big job today? It is
defined by content and breadth, scope and size, rather than where it is
in an organisational chart. You can't see that any more in a matrixed
network organisation."

The consulting group is working closely with Lotus Development
Corporation, the software company that makes Notes and which IBM
acquired in July for $3.5 billion. Lotus' consulting capability
complements what the IBM Consulting Group is doing, Movizzo said. "For
us and their people on the consulting side it was a comfortable
relationship to begin with and now we are going to build on that."

In addition, some of IBM's consulting practices are deployed in ISSC,
an IBM subsidiary that does systems integration and outsourcing. "We
are also tightly linked from a development point of view in that the
consulting group was given responsibilities for developing and rolling
out common methodologies and tools across IBM, including ISSC," Movizzo
said.

By the end of 1995, the consulting group expected to have 2,800
professionals in 33 countries, including new offices in India and South
Africa. About 40 percent of the consultants are involved in industry
transformation/general business consulting, 30 percent do IT/networking
systems and the other 30 percent do object technology and data
modelling, he said.

And all three areas are reportedly growing, although IBM will not
release consulting-specific numbers. In 1993 and 1994, the group
claimed 35 percent growth, and Movizzo said the group continued to grow
at 25 percent to 35 percent in 1995. "Of course, the bigger we get, the
harder it is to maintain that percentage," he said."But . . . on an
ongoing basis, I'd like to keep it there. I don't see any limits to
that, interestingly enough, as I look forward."

UNITED KINGDOM:  ARTHUR ANDERSEN ACQUIRES DOCTUS CONSULTANCY

Arthur Andersen has acquired Chester-based management consultancy,
Doctus, in a deal which sees Denis Mahoney, Doctus' managing director,
join the Andersen practice as a partner.

The acquisition is part of a growing shift by accountants Arthur
Andersen into the management consulting arena usually associated with
its sister firm, Andersen Consulting.

Doctus is a small multi-disciplinary consultancy with around 15
consultants specialising in strategy, change management and
implementing improved working practices and business processes.
Clients include British Airways and British Nuclear Fuels.

Founded in 1976, the firm has had a chequered history.  It became a
publicly quoted company in 1986 and was subsequently acquired by a
larger public limited company which retained the Doctus name for its
marketing and business services activities.  When that group collapsed
in 1991, Doctus' management consulting operation was bought by CRT, the
training and recruitment group.

In 1993, however, CRT decided to pull out of management consulting
after a substantial decline in the market for Doctus' services, with
the business losing #0.7 million ($1.09 million) in the first half of
1993.  Mahoney led a magement buy-out and Doctus Consulting Europe, as
it was then known, began scaling back its European activities (MCI 54).

Both AA and Doctus declined to discuss details of the acquisition, but
Andersen said it involved a small payment for the tangible assets of
the business, plus partnership for Mahoney.  Nothing was paid for
goodwill.

"Doctus has an established track record in securing long-term profit
performance improvements with clients throughout the UK utilities,
aerospace and airlines industries.  Andersen's extensive worldwide
reach will provide Docuts with a vital edge," Mahoney said.

FEACO REPORTS FALL IN 1994 REVENUES

Management consulting revenues fell by more than 9 percent in 1994
among members of FEACO, the European federation of management
consulting associations. Revenue per consultant also decreased although
the firms appeared to have hired more consultants.

The information is contained in FEACO's annual survey released in
December 1995. It is based on responses from 17 of the 25 national
associations which comprise the federation. The 17 associations
represent 1,088 consulting firms employing 31,257 consultants. FEACO
members have an estimated 34 percent share of the total consulting
market in Europe.

Combined income for these firms was ECU4.55 billion ($5.9 billion) in
1994, almost the same as in 1993. Management consulting fees, however,
fell to ECU3.89 billion from ECU4.28 billion, the previous year.

At the same time, revenues from other sources such as software sales
and interim management increased. In some countries, notably the
Netherlands, these account for more than half of consulting firms'
revenues.

The number of consultants employed by the firms grew by 9.4 percent but
average revenue per consultant fell by 17 percent to ECU124,867,
possibly reflecting the departure of senior consultants and their
replacement by inexperienced graduates.

It should be borne in mind, however, that the members of the national
associations vary considerably, ranging in size from firms of less than
ten consultants to those employing several hundred. Also, many
international consultancies do not join national associations and are
therefore not reflected in the figures.

Despite widespread discussion of globalisation, it would seem - based
on FEACO's data - that management consulting is becoming an
increasingly national activity. Domestic business accounted for 88.5
percent of FEACO members' turnover, a slight increase over the previous
year. But this is a somewhat misleading statistic, reflecting in part
which office sends out the invoice on a cross-border assignment, not
who is doing the actual work.

Countries with the highest share of management consulting relative to
gross national product are Switzerland (0.35 percent), Germany (0.32
percent) and the Netherlands (0.30 percent).

Overall, information technology and systems work increased by 51.7
percent, finance and administration grew by 15 percent and human
resources jumped by 16 percent. Demand for other types of consulting
work declined.

THE NETHERLANDS:  C&L CONSIDERS MOVE TO LIMITED LIABILITY STATUS

Coopers & Lybrand, the third-largest firm in the Netherlands, is
considering a move to limited liability status as a way of protecting
itself against litigation.

A decision to draw up a plan for incorporation was taken at a partners
meeting in September, but the final proposal is unlikely to be put to a
partnership vote before next summer, said Louk Stumpel, C&L's head of
marketing and communications. The firm is looking at incorporating all
of its operations in the Netherlands - consulting, accounting and tax,
he added.

If the plan goes ahead, C&L would be the second Big Six firm in the
Netherlands to become a limited liability company or NV. KPMG Klynveld
adopted NV status on January 1 1995, although two of its Dutch member
firms, actuarial consultancy Brans & Co and tax law firm KPMG Meijburg,
opted out of the move (MCI 65). The other Big Six have seemed reluctant
to consider incorporation.

Turnover in C&L's management consulting operations was relatively flat
in 1994, growing by less than 3 percent to DFLl84.3 million ($52.6
million). Firm-wide, revenues slipped by 2.1 percent to DFL659 million
although C&L recorded a profit of DFL26.9 million, an increase of 18.5
percent over 1993. The firm employed an average of 255 consultants in
1994.

DEPARTURES FROM GEMINI CONSULTING

Gemini Consulting has revised the number of US consultants let go in
two rounds of job cuts earlier this year (MCI 74,71). The firm now says
only 150 were fired, not the 270 previously announced. However, the
firm acknowledged that the total number of consultants for 1995 will
average 1,400, compared with 1,700 in 1994. The difference is due to
attrition and some terminations in Europe over performance issues, a
spokesperson explained.

RESULTS FROM DTTI AND E&Y

Consulting drove growth at both Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu International
and Ernst & Young in 1995. Worldwide fee income at DTTI rose 14.4
percent to $5.95 billion in the year to August 30. The firm did not
provide a fee split but said an expansion into emerging markets and the
acquisition of information technology firm ICS were among the factors
behind a record increase in revenues in fiscal 1995.

Ernst & Young reported record worldwide revenues of $6.87 billion for
the fiscal year ended September 30. This was a 14 percent increase over
the prior year and higher than its worldwide growth rate for the
previous four years combined. The firm reported"strong momentum" in
management consulting but did not provide worldwide consulting
revenues.

In the US, E&Y's revenues were up 16.9 percent to $2.97 billion, more
than double the increase in fiscal 1994. Management consulting grew by
48.2 percent in the US, and health care consulting by 42.2 percent, US
chairman Philip Laskawy said. Total US consulting revenues increased by
36 percent.

IRISH CONSULTANTS' FOREIGN EARNINGS

Consultants in Ireland are increasingly looking to overseas projects to
boost fee income. According to the Institute of Management Consultants
in Ireland (IMCI), foreign earnings of member firms trebled to Ir#38.21
million ($61.53 million) in the last six years. A large portion of that
was earned by the international consulting arms of the two leading
banks and the state-owned electricity company. Total revenue earned by
Irish consultants in 1993 was estimated at Ir#75 million by the IMCI.

BRANDING - THE ULTIMATE GOAL

From the old-fashioned Coca-Cola bottle to American Express' "Accepted
Worldwide" message, every company wants a consistent image that builds
brand loyalty and consumer confidence. So, too, do consultants, as
Karin Ronnow finds out

Branding, as it is dubbed by the marketing gurus, has taken on
increasing importance in the hyper-competitive, global consulting
marketplace. Many of the international consulting firms have invested
in branding over the years, but those that ignored it are now finding
that it has merit.

Branding takes two forms - the "message" about what the firm is, and
how that plays out in a physical "look" and "feel". For consulting
firms, the message has always been the primary emphasis. But, as firms
become more global, they are finding that a universal "look" is equally
important.

"Branding is something that creates loyalty, premium pricing potential
and better distribution and market acceptance," said Allan Steinmetz,
Arthur D Little's senior vice-president and corporate director of
marketing.

"That's why companies invest so much in it. Setting standards with
regard to corporate identity, the look and feel, from business cards to
brochures to presentation styles . . . It is a common denominator that
creates an asset value for a corporation."

Bain, for example, is taking a new look at branding. The firm has
relied heavily on its 23-year history on face-to-face contact to
communicate its message of "results". Bain doesn't advertise, so client
contacts are the only opportunity to "describe what we do, how we do it
and how it is a different product or process than our major
competitors", Bain director David Bechoffer said.

But in the past year it has become clear that while Bain is consistent
in "cross-office" delivery, the firm has not always looked like it
delivered that consistency, Bechoffer said. "We have grown incredibly
quickly over the past three or four years and we didn't all `look' the
same," Bechoffer said. "So we went through a major exercise to develop
a standards log and we will now have material that will be top-to-
bottom consistent to reinforce the strength of what we say, from
letterhead to business cards. So when we have people from five offices
working on a project, the clients see one firm and not five offices.
And that does mean something in the long run."

Brand is "a very deep discussion for a firm", said Kathleen Reichert,
vice-president of marketing and communication for AT Kearney.

The recent acquisition of AT Kearney by Electronic Data Systems - two
markedly different firms - creates a challenge for Reichert, who must
define how the expanded Kearney looks and communicates.

In its former incarnation, AT Kearney had a definite, conservative
look, best defined by the "Kearney grey", which permeated the firm,
from literature to the walls of its downtown Chicago headquarters. EDS
has presented a more outgoing, innovative image.

"We are still in the process of looking at how we want to brand the new
AT Kearney," she said. "At this point, we want to retain the AT Kearney
logo, which we think provides continuity and allows us to draw from
some of AT Kearney's strengths and traditions.

"We are reviewing the introduction of colour, the use of visuals that
express the excitement, change and some of the important strategic
thrusts we hope to be undertaking over the next three- year period."

Brand defines the firm to the outside world but also helps build a
culture internally. Arthur D Little sees its brand largely as its
"personality", which the firm defines as "confident, aggressive, easy
to work with, learning with clients side by side, in conjunction with
deep knowledge and experience in three distinct lines of business",
ADL's Steinmetz said. Consultants are charged with conveying that
message in any client contact.

But visually conveying the message is important too, and ADL has a
three-ring binder of "Corporate Graphic Standards", which details the
size, shape and look of all corporate brochures, biography sheets, fact
and office lists, corporate statements, letterhead, business cards and
mailing labels. The colour and placement of the ADL logo on a page, the
size of the font, and full-length and abbreviated versions of ADL's
identity statements are all spelled out to ensure continuity around the
world.

"We went through an exhaustive brand identity review about eight years
ago and it was designed to give us a global, more contemporary feel
about who we were," Steinmetz said. "We hired an outside identity
consulting firm that specialises in this area and this is what they
recommended. We conducted client research and this is the one theme
most reflective of what we wanted to be known for."

A distinct personality has added importance for Andersen Consulting.
Along with selling itself, AC must also distinguish its services from
those of its sister firm, Arthur Andersen, which sells some consulting
services as well as tax and auditing. AC stresses that it offers
different services and that its clients are dissimilar.

"The biggest problem is perception," AC partner Jim Murphy said.
"Andersen Consulting is only six years old . . . so we continue to work
on setting up separate brands. There are parts of it that are the same -
 integrity, professionalism. But in the audit and tax business, you
need a heavy emphasis on conservative steadiness. In our business, you
need an emphasis on creativity, innovation, sharing risks. It's a whole
different personality, a whole different brand."

For itself, AC stresses its commitment to being a global firm. And,
while it has invested in consistent visual messages, the idea of "the
message" is emphasised to new hires from their first day on the job.

"Most important is something that we don't own, our clients own, it's
in their head, and that is our promise to them as an organisation,"
Murphy said."It comes to life not only in advertising, literature and
signage, but how people act on the job, how we sell, what kind of
clients we have, what we do. All of this has to be part of the built-in
culture. It comes out of our training, the acculturation process. The
idea of what Andersen Consulting stands for as a brand is put in front
of all our employees."

HIGHLIGHTS OF 1995

Mergers, acquisitions and lawsuits characterised the consulting
industry in 1995. The year saw the biggest ever acquisition of one
consulting firm by another, as well as the largest legal action to be
mounted against a consultant. William Gleeson looks back at the major
news stories

JANUARY

The year started with the theme "out with the old and in with the new".
KPMG Switzerland swept away its old management team, replacing it with
new faces in the boardroom. The changes came after two years of flat
growth at the firm. Jacob Baer took over as head of a four-person
management committee following the departure of Hugh Mathews, who was
formerly joint managing partner with Baer.

Ernst & Young found itself on the wrong end of the first writ of the
year over a claim for several million pounds from North West Thames
Regional Health Authority in the UK. The dispute centred on E&Y's
alleged failure to meet a deadline for the completion of a consultancy
project to give the authority a new payroll system and financial
systems mainframe.

FEBRUARY

The year was punctuated by job loss announcements. One of the earliest
was Ernst & Young's disclosure of changes to its US actuarial and
special services practices.

The actuarial, benefits and compensation unit was renamed "human
resources" and reorganised into 11 locations, down from 20. At the same
time, E&Y's mergers, acquisitions, reorganisations and insolvency
practice was renamed "financial advisory services" and concentrated at
19 locations. As a result of the changes, around 100 people left the
firm.

CSC continued its expansion in Europe with the acquisition of German
information technology consulting firm, Ploenzke. At the same time, CSC
acquired SODI, the small international consulting arm of Groupe
Ouroumoff in France. This followed the acquisition of Ouroumoff
Consultants in 1994.

George Cox, former chairman of P-E International, became the UK chief
executive of Unisys. His hiring was the latest in a line of about 70
high flying consultants taken on at the systems firm.

MARCH

Another major theme during the year was the shift to "global"
consulting practices. Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu International led the
pack with its announced plans for a global practice, but DTTI denied it
would split consulting from audit and tax as Arthur Andersen and
Andersen Consulting had done in 1989. (Further details emerged as the
year progressed).

The century old names of "Peat" and "Marwick" officially disappeared
when KPMG Peat Marwick in the UK announced that as part of its
incorporation plans, the firm was renaming itself KPMG. In the US,
Deloitte and Touche acquired the Canadian firm, International
Consulting Solutions, a SAP software implementation company. The new
business was called ICS Deloitte, employing 700 professionals.

Victor Millar resigned as head of Unisys Worldwide Information Services
to run a new consulting unit at AT&T, the US telecommunications
company. The move by the communications giant into the crowded
consulting market created yet another consulting, systems integration
and outsourcing competitor for the big international consulting firms -
and pointed up the value of consulting in selling other information
technology services.

The consultancy profession in the UK voiced its disapproval of a
government scheme to set up a register of consultants to assist
companies in choosing suitable advisers. The consultants argued that
the scheme was too expensive and bureaucratic and would jeopardise
client confidentiality.

APRIL

Ernst & Young and mid-tier US accounting and consulting firm Kenneth
Leventhal, which specialises in real estate work, announced a merger.
Leventhal was formerly the US member firm of CKL International, the
15th-largest international accounting and consulting network.

Rumours emerged that EDS was set to make a bid for AT Kearney but this
was strongly denied by both firms. "We have no need or desire to sell
the firm," said Kearney's chief executive Fred Steingraber. Meanwhile,
it emerged that EDS's fledgling management consulting arm had a $22
million loss in 1994 on revenues estimated by MCI at $180 million. The
firm attributed the losses to start-up costs.

Andersen Consulting, on the other hand, reported worldwide revenue up
20 percent to $3.45 billion.

MAY

In what appeared to be the largest lawsuit to date against a consulting
firm, UOP, an Illinois-based engineering company, filed a $100 million
suit against Andersen Consulting, alleging fraud, incompetence and
negligence.

It was the latest in a string of lawsuits against consultants and
underscored that consultancies are as much at risk from legal actions
for negligence as the accounting firms. UOP, which licenses petroleum
and gas processing technologies, claimed that Andersen bungled the
development of two computer systems intended to streamline the
preparation of engineering specifications and project cost estimates.

Ernst & Young's London practice announced plans for a radical
restructuring of part of its operations along multi-disciplinary lines.
Consultants, auditors and tax advisers were grouped together to serve
specific market sectors: financial services, media and resources,
industrial and consumer services and owner- managed businesses. About
90 of the 400 UK consultants were deployed in the new groups.

Proudfoot also announced plans to change the way it does things. The
firm said it would revamp its product, improve its internal operations
and launch its first ever global marketing drive. It also announced
results showing the severest drop in revenues in its history for its
core productivity services in Europe. Overall, turnover plummeted 24
percent to #106 million ($165.6 million). Some 150 jobs had been shed
in the year to March, bringing the total workforce to 700.

Mercer Management Consulting expanded its presence in Europe by
acquiring MID, a mid-sized French strategy firm, and announcing plans
to open an office in Madrid. The acquisition boosted the number of
Mercer consultants in Europe to 250, up from 70 two years ago.

JUNE

More writs, this time in Australia where Price Waterhouse Urwick was
sued for the largest claim for damages brought against a firm of
management consultants in that country. The firm was sued for $A13
million ($9.8 million) by a failed museum venture and its developer,
for engaging in alleged misleading and deceptive conduct and for breach
of contract. The claim centred on a report predicting the likely number
of visitors to the museum.

The month saw also more bad news for PW, this time in Canada. The firm
announced the closure of its Quebec IT office due to major cutbacks in
consulting work from the Quebec Government.

OC&C, the former strategic consulting arm of Coopers & Lybrand, said it
planned to establish a base in North America and Germany within a year
as part of an international growth strategy. The firm, which has
offices in London, Paris and Rotterdam, left C&L in April.

JULY

After a series of on-again, off-again talks, EDS acquired AT Kearney to
create a $550 million business with more than 2,300 consultants. It was
the first significant move by an IT firm into the upper echelon of
consulting leagues.

The deal signalled the growing polarisation between the so-called super
providers of integrated consulting services and the rest of the pack.
EDS paid $300 million in cash. Additionally, to retain key staff, some
200 Kearney executives received about 7 million shares of class E
General Motors stock, vested over ten years. The GME stock tracks EDS
business and was valued at $296 million.

There was bad news at Gemini Consulting which laid off some 170 staff -
8 percent of its worldwide employees (since revised, see page 6). Most
of the lay-offs were in the US. The cuts came amid rumours of senior
level disagreements within the firm and the abrupt departure of the
former chairman and chief executive David Teiger.

AUGUST/SEPTEMBER

Andersen Consulting started litigation proceedings against rival
consulting firm, American Management Systems, alleging copyright
infringement, breach of contract and intentional interference with
Andersen's business opportunities. Andersen contended that AMS copied
AC's proprietary tax administration system design and demanded $20
million in lost profits and damages.

Another firm revealed some of its globalisation plans. Ernst & Young
replaced its European Consulting Group with a new legal entity, Global
Client Consulting, in a move towards developing a global consulting
practice. The new group will service major clients in large-scale,
multi-year contracts.

General Motors announced plans to spin off EDS in a move designed to
allow EDS to pursue its strategic objectives more effectively. CSC
Index pulled out of Korea just months after closing its Japan operation
acknowledging a "substantial" loss on its Asia venture. And Coopers &
Lybrand agreed to pay the state of Arizona $750,000 after a long-
running investigation into alleged bidding improprieties in the award
of a consulting contract. C&L denied any wrongdoing.

Most of KPMG's consultants in Adelaide defected to Coopers & Lybrand.
The three partners who defected said KPMG's federated organisational
structure in Australia - where each state has its own management
structure and reporting lines - was an obstacle to building a national
practice in Australia.

OCTOBER

American Management Systems struck back in the copyright dispute with
Andersen Consulting. AMS filed a counter lawsuit, charging defamation
and accusing Andersen of trying to damage AMS's business prospects and
reputation. According to AMS, Andersen contacted AMS clients claiming
ownership of the tax system design which AMS was using. A New York
district court denied Andersen's request for an injunction to prevent
AMS from using the disputed tax system design.

NOVEMBER

More job losses. Gemini Consulting laid-off 100 employees in the second
round of redundancies at the firm in the year. The cuts followed months
of turmoil at the firm, including the sudden departure of new chief
executive, Dan Valentino, and a slide in US revenues.

Yet another in a long line of reorganisations at Proudfoot, the
publicly-quoted consultancy which has seen its revenues and share price
dwindle in recent years. This time, the company announced plans to
revamp its management structure in the US, dramatically scale back its
Mexico operations and centralise control over its business development
and operational activities. Malcolm Hughes, the chief executive
appointed in October 1994, said"this is my one and only restructuring.
It is what I was brought in to do. I think it will result in a
turnaround fairly quickly."

Deloitte and Touche in the US and Touche Ross in the UK said they were
on the brink of forming a transatlantic alliance of their consulting
practices. The move follows the creation of Deloitte & Touche
Consulting Group in the US as a separate division of the US firm.

Andersen Consulting announced plans to make a physical break with
Arthur Andersen by leaving the worldwide headquarters of the firm in
Chicago. The firms legally split in 1989. Some observers say the move
was inspired by Andersen Consulting's desire to distance itself from
Arthur Andersen, the accounting part of the firm, as AA attempts to
develop its own consulting practice.

DECEMBER

Amdahl came out as victor in the battle for Canadian technology
services company, DMR, after outbidding its two rivals, IBM Canada and
BDM International of the US. The deal created another giant in the
growing services and solutions marketplace, which is increasingly
posing a threat to the traditional management consultancies.

PAST, PRESENT AND FUTURE

Managing change may be the core activity of a consultant's work, but
observing change is also part of the job. Ed Hendricks, who retires as
president of ACME, the US-based association of management consulting
firms, at the end of December, looks back on his years with the
association

In the nearly 17 years that I have been on the staff of ACME, I have
had the benefit of an unparalleled overview of the worldwide consulting
marketplace. To say that there have been significant changes in the
profession over those years would be a gross understatement. And, any
attempt to capture all of those changes would be futile. However, as I
prepare to leave the association at the end of 1995, I did want to
share some of my observations.

The late 1970s and early 1980s were the end of the era of the big name
owner/founder firms. These were the days of the Dick Pagets and Carl
Sloanes (among others) who, by force of their personalities, maintained
the image of consulting as a "gentlemen's club".

There was a desire among the firms to share information and to help
each other out. As Carl Sloane put it at an ACME meeting, "You do good
work we all benefit, you do bad work we all suffer." There was also a
strong belief in professionalism, translated into standards of
practice, which had the effect of limiting competition while fostering
the development of personal relationships and even friendships among
the heads of firms.

By the 1980s, different types of organisations began to enter the
consulting arena. Driven by the "Big Eight" accounting firms' move into
consulting in a concerted way, marketing activities were increased, and
some practitioners even began to use the word "sell" in the same
sentence as "consulting services", much to the chagrin of the purists.

Bigness and one-stop shopping came into vogue and acquisitions and
mergers became the norm. Many of the founders/owners took this
opportunity to capitalise on their investments, and their firms were
acquired by larger entities. The resulting mega-firms required a
different type of management structure, and a"revolving door" in the
chief executive's position was not unusual.

Relationships became more professional than personal in nature,
resulting in some hesitancy in sharing information.

A slowdown in overall growth in the early 1990s caused many consulting
firms to increase their marketing efforts and to experiment with the
use of advertising and other ways to differentiate themselves from the
competition. And, firms began to look for other services to provide, in
addition to consulting advice.

Training programmes, software and outsourcing activities became common
ancillary services offered by consulting firms. As clients began to
increasingly demand experienced consultants to work on their projects,
consulting firms found themselves caught in a price compression
situation. In many cases, profits suffered and competition increased.

Throughout the early and mid-1990s, consulting firms found themselves
under increasing pressure from a variety of sources. Outplaced
executives from client companies formed their own consulting firms and
competed for the work they had previously contracted out. Clients began
to demand that consulting firms share the risk of change with them, and
contingency fees, value added bonus plans, and other billing
arrangements based on the successful implementation of the consultant's
recommendations became more common.

Technology became an important part of almost every consulting
assignment. As a result, consulting firms either began or increased
spending on their own technological infrastructure. No longer was the
capital of a consulting firm to be found only in its people.

Running a consulting firm became a very expensive proposition. Big
corporations like IBM and EDS saw consulting as a way of expanding
their product and service offerings and explored different ways of
entering the field. Competition for senior level staff accelerated and
executive search firms were kept busy by consulting firms.

Experimentation with management structures and delivery mechanisms were
additional challenges confronting consulting firms in the 1990s. Some
firms chose to centralise consulting services under one key executive.
Others chose to segment by industry, service offering or geography, and
yet more developed a hybrid of styles.

Despite the challenges of the mid-1990s, it has been a boom time for
most firms. Record revenues have been reported by many firms, and the
short-term future seems to be bright. But if history is any predictor,
the pendulum will shift again!

So what do I see for the future?

For one thing, I foresee additional mergers between some quite large
firms with others being acquired by so-called non- traditional
competitors. I would not be surprised to see consulting operations
being spun-off to become publicly-held companies through stock
offerings.

Traditional partnerships are going to find it increasingly difficult to
derive the financing for very large outsourcing opportunities and
technological requirements.

Lawsuits against consulting firms can also not be far off as clients
demand higher levels of success in project implementation.

And, consulting firms are going to have to devise new ways of dealing
with a diverse workforce that is more concerned with lifestyle issues
and may not be willing to accept the heavy travel schedules and
workload pressures of their predecessors.

Although I am leaving ACME, I do so with a great deal of respect for
our profession. Consultants are truly agents of change. As such, they
carry a great burden to operate at the very highest standards of
integrity. Almost without exception, the consultants I have met have
borne that burden with dignity.

SWITZERLAND: A SOPHISTICATED MARKET

The competitive Swiss consulting market is attracting international
firms while local consultancies are starting to work outside
Switzerland. Sandra Burke reports

For its size, the Swiss consulting market is highly sophisticated.
Switzerland has more consultants per head of population than any other
country, reflecting in part the large number of Swiss multinational
corporations and the foreign multinationals with European headquarters
in Switzerland, all seeking top class advice.

As a result, many of the international consultancies and IT providers
have opened offices. They share the market with a number of independent
mid-sized local firms and a large collection of sole practitioners. The
latest arrivals in 1995 included Bossard Consultants and American
Management Systems. Gemini Consulting established a presence in 1994.

Despite the attractions, however, the Swiss market has some inherent
problems. Fee rates are up to 20 percent higher than in neighbouring
countries. This, together with a strong Swiss franc, has caused
problems for some consultants as clients turn to cheaper German
consultancies, or seek to pay in deutschmarks or dollars.

Other constraints have been the lingering effects of the recession, a
small hiring pool, and the moves by many Swiss firms to relocate in
cheaper countries, thus obviating the need for consultants. Foreign
consultants with lower pricing structures are also entering the Swiss
market, forcing local players to discount their rates. This is
especially true in delivery areas such as SAP, according to consultants
interviewed by MCI.

Not all consultancies, however, have been affected by these trends. The
strategy houses are doing well, reflecting the desire of major Swiss
multinationals for international know-how, regardless of price.

Altogether, the size of the Swiss consulting market is estimated at
SKr500 million ($439 million) to SKr600 million. But the market is
highly fragmented. Turnover among the top 25 firms totalled SKr344.2
million in 1994. But the three leading firms - McKinsey, Coopers &
Lybrand and CSC - held about 20 percent of the market.

Consultants interviewed estimated overall market growth in 1995 at
between 5 percent and 10 percent.

Performance in 1994 varied widely among the firms. The strategy houses,
in particular, did well, reflecting the desire of major Swiss
multinationals for international know-how, regardless of price.

Switzerland is an "extremely attractive" market for Bain, said managing
director Janet Voute-Allen. "I think what's unique to Switzerland is
that the top companies are highly international. The top 20 make a very
small percentage of their sales in Switzerland. So, they require [a
consultancy] with an international office network," she said.

Bain has 30 consultants working in Switzerland, of which 13 are based
there. The firm plans to double its local staff so assignments can be
staffed locally. The office was established in 1990 and has seen 100
percent growth per annum in the last three years, Voute-Allen said.

In Switzerland, Bain is working in the retail, pharmaceutical, high
tech, construction and consumer goods sectors, but not, surprisingly,
in financial services although the firm is in discussions on some
assignments now.

"We see a shift away from looking inside at costs and organisation and
looking out at growth strategies. That's good for companies and good
for us," Voute-Allen said. "Cost optimisation is essential and must
continue. But it's not everything."

At Coopers & Lybrand, consulting turnover doubled over the last four
years and the firm expects growth of 18 percent to 20 percent in 1995,
said Tony Haas, managing partner. Cross-border work is still a small
portion of C&L's consulting business in Switzerland but will form a
larger part in future, especially on big projects, Haas said.
Currently, the Swiss firm is working closely with its sister firm in
Germany.

The firm is well placed in the telecommunications, public sector and
health care sector, but less strong in financial services in part
because C&L was owned by Swiss Bank Corporation until 1991, Haas said.
"We are still a little bit behind [in financial services] but growing,"
Haas said.

KPMG reorganised its operations in 1994 after two years of flat growth
(MCI 65). As a result, there was a "reduction in volume" in 1994 over
1993, said Bruce Mathers, partner in charge of management consulting.
Demand was higher in 1995 and the firm was hoping for a 15 percent
growth in the consulting practice, Mathers said.

As part of the reorganisation, KPMG created separate consulting groups
in banking, insurance, consulting to central and eastern Europe,
standard software implementation (predominantly SAP), IT consulting
(which offers advice on hardware and software selection) and corporate
finance.

"We are organised into smallish groups with a very clear focus on each.
That was a conscious change. We used to have everyone in one management
consulting pot. We have split it down to make sure development and
marketing activities are more focused," Mathers said.

Plans to create a banking industry group which would combine audit, tax
and consulting had to be shelved after the Federal Banking Commission
expressed reservations, he said.

The firm has also postponed plans to create other industry specific
groups like those in the UK and US. "They are large enough to split
into industry specific groups. For us, that is still a couple of years
down the road in terms of allocating consultants to particular
industries," Mathers said.

In Switzerland, KPMG is doing particularly well in corporate finance
and corporate recovery work as well as in SAP and business process re-
engineering, Mathers said. "What is limiting our growth is the
availability of qualified personnel," he added.

Deloitte & Touche, which has the smallest consulting practice of any of
the Big Six firms in Switzerland, reported record growth in 1994
following a relaunch of the consulting operation. This was achieved in
part by hiring a team from a rival Big Six firm.

"Consulting firms in Switzerland have always had cyclic expansion and
contraction," said Daniel Meister, head of D&T's Swiss consulting
practice. "The Swiss firm made a decision [to expand consulting]
because they felt and still feel that besides the audit potential to
grow - and they see less opportunity in that area - they realise they
need a well- managed consulting group to support them in keeping
clients and adding value to clients."

The 1995 acquisition of Canadian SAP specialists ICS - which had an
operation in Basel - also contributed to growth, Meister said. D&T has
targeted the health care, pharmaceuticals, financial services and
logistics/distribution sectors, he said. With ICS primarily involved in
pharmaceuticals in Switzerland, "this has been a boost to our
opportunities from a re-engineering perspective", Meister said.

D&T is also considering supplementing its SAP services with Oracle
business application skills. It is likely to retain its niche training
services in Word, Excel and other packages. "In Switzerland, PC
training has always been important. It's never grown a lot but it has
added some volume. I don't see it as strategic, but it is profitable,"
Meister said.

Among the Swiss firms, revenues were flat at ICME in 1994 compared with
1993, according to partner Gian Saratz, although the firm showed a 7
percent increase when its international revenue was taken into account.
ICME offers a range of general consulting services and has subsidiaries
in France and Germany. About half the clients are in banking, insurance
and telecommunications with the rest in the manufacturing, chemical and
pharmaceutical sectors.

Saratz blamed the recession and the firm's international focus for its
lack-lustre performance in Switzerland. "The market has become much
tougher. Also, we put our strength quite a bit abroad to support our
other companies so we neglected Switzerland a bit."

Helbling Management Consulting reported revenues of SKr11 million in
1994 and expects to increase that to SKr13 million in 1995, according
to Reto Muller, managing director. In addition, the firm will have SKr3
million from its German operation.

Muller attributed the increase to a gain in market share at the expense
of smaller Swiss consultancies. "Firms with less than SKr10 million
face difficulties," he noted. His firm, which provides strategy
consulting and counts McKinsey and The Boston Consulting Group among
its competitors, also benefits from its lower fee structure compared to
the bigger strategy firms.

"We have lower rates. Our daily fees are on average SKr2,700 [compared
to SKr4,000 to SKr5,000 per day at other strategy firms]. So we are
still very competitive compared to the big ones. We won three contracts
against McKinsey and BCG in Germany and Switzerland this year. We
compete in certain areas such as corporate restructuring, time-based
management . . . We do not compete in international market studies."

Helbling's target clients are companies with annual turnover of SKr20
million to SKr1 billion, Muller added. In addition to the management
consulting business, the Helbling Group has four other subsidiaries: a
mergers and acquisitions unit; a product design and automation unit
comprising 120 professionals, mainly engineers; an EDP company
specialising in computer-aided design software for engineers; and an
environmental unit, Muller said.

"We expect next year a lot of assignments in financial and corporate
restructuring and also a lot of profit improvement and turnaround
assignments. Also, new public management. There is an increasing demand
for those types of services," he said.

SCG St. Gallen Consulting Group estimates 1995 Swiss revenues at
SKr10.8 million, up 20 percent over 1994. Founded in 1984, the firm has
retained its close ties with the University of St. Gallen. In addition
to its headquarters in the town of St. Gallen near the German border,
the firm has an office near Geneva in the French- speaking part of
Switzerland along with offices in Frankfurt, Leipzig and London. Total
revenue was SKr25.7 million in 1994, nearly half of which was derived
in Switzerland. SCG is fully independent and partner-owned.

"We've been international from the beginning because the founders had
worked internationally. Switzerland being a small country, for growth
to be obtained, it is necessary to grow internationally. If you were
only working in Switzerland, growth would be limited," said consultant
Peter Fanconi.

The firm specialises in strategy but also in organisation and corporate
development, management systems, marketing and sales, business re-
engineering and human resources (especially management and leadership).

SCG's clients are primarily in the financial services and retail
sectors but the firm is increasingly working in the public sector and
industry (especially energy, IT and telecommunications).

At TC Team Consult, revenues were flat in 1994. The firm specialises in
four sectors: police and security, family-owned companies, the public
sector and the postal services. The Swiss holding company owns all of
the Swiss practice plus a 5 percent to 10 percent stake in Team
Consult's subsidiaries in the Netherlands, Belgium and Austria.

Nearly three years ago, Bossard Consultants of France took a 20 percent
stake in Team Consult (MCI 45) with plans to boost that to 51 percent
and use TC to build a Swiss business. That appears not to have
progressed. Bossard retains the 20 percent ownership but the firms do
not work closely together and Bossard has recently opened its own
office in Zurich. Currently, Bossard has two people in Switzerland,
although up to 20 consultants from Bossard's French office have been
working in the French-speaking part of the country. The firm is seeking
a Swiss partner, said Hans-Joachim Diedenhofen, partner in charge of
the Swiss operation.

Other Swiss firms include Hayek Engineering with estimated revenues of
SKr12.5 million; Gherzi which specialises in the textiles sector and
has estimated income of SKr18.6 million; APP Informatik which is
primarily involved in information technology; BSG in St. Gallen which
offers strategy, organisational and IT consulting; Abegglen & Partners
which provides general management consulting to the services sector
including retail and telecommunications; and Management Zentrum, also
in St. Gallen.

Trends elsewhere are also manifest in Switzerland but with some
differences. Recruitment, for example, can be tougher in Switzerland
than elsewhere due to the country's small population and relatively
large consulting market resulting in a much smaller pool of potential
recruits. Tough laws on foreign workers also make hiring consultants
from elsewhere a challenge.

Globalisation has not hit the local Swiss firms, but many are already
working outside Switzerland, primarily in Germany.

"On a Swiss base, we are a large company. On a European scale, we are
in the problem field," said Saratz of ICME. "We are trying to grow
either by ourselves or by alliances." Besides Switzerland, ICME is
concentrating on the French, German and Austrian markets. The firm is
also doing work in Spain and Italy through a local partner, albeit
mainly for Swiss, French and German clients, he said.

Helbling opened its first German office four years ago and now has
small bases in Dusseldorf, Stuttgart and Munich. After building up the
German practice, the firm plans to expand into other countries, Muller
said.

Looking ahead, consultants anticipate increased fee pressure and a
shake-out among the mid-sized firms. "Fees are always a topic,"
observed KPMG's Mathers. "You certainly have to be very competitive."

One company, Stiftung BWI, which was associated with the technical
university in Zurich, announced in November that it would cease its
consulting operations. The firm's 1994 turnover was SKr8.1 million,
down 4.7 percent over the previous year, according to Klaus Wernihk,
the interim director who is overseeing BWI's wind-up.

The institute had 40 consultants and offered a range of general
services. Fee rates were reportedly lower than at competing small and
medium Swiss firms in part because BWI could draw on students to
conduct some of its economic studies.

But BWI, which was created before the advent of specialty consulting
and international competition, had outlived its time, Wernihk said.
Some of its core activities may be spun off through management buy-
outs, he added.

Perhaps the greatest challenge facing consulting firms in Switzerland
is to get their transaction costs down. Some firms, like Coopers &
Lybrand, have reduced their rates and in certain cases are proposing
fixed fees rather than daily rates.

"We have to prove we offer more value for money," said C&L's Haas.
While firms can command high fees for strategy advice, delivery or
implementation work is priced at a much lower level.

"We are between the two," Haas said. "If we work on a project finding a
solution, then fees are not a problem. But on implementation, which can
take months or years, [the return is] lower."

"It's up to the whole consulting industry to improve its productivity,"
he added. "If we have the right mix between high and medium level
consulting and implementation work, profitability will be sustained.
It's also a function of the size of the firm. With 20, 30 or 40 people,
that's dangerous. But with 100 and more, you can survive."

"Clients are looking for more commodity-type support," observed D&T's
Meister. "One of the ways out is to specialise and leverage, add value
in more intense proportions. In the past, it was not unheard of that
consulting firms customised software programmes for clients at prime
rates. Today, we are using objects, modules etc to bring the cost
down."

Others are looking beyond the current focus on implementation. "In
Switzerland, McKinsey has a very strong position on the strategic side.
We don't intend to leave that area to them forever," said KPMG's
Mathers."We must get closer to the decision-making area as well as
implementation, we must be able to offer the entire range. At the
moment, our services tend to be more on [the] implementation end."
