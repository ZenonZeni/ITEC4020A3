INDUSTRY & TECHNOLOGY DEPT. WOULD REPLACE COMMERCE DEPT.

     A new piece of legislation facing Congress when it returns
Jan. 23 would abolish the U.S. Department of Commerce and replace
it with a new Department of Industry and Technology.  The stated
aim of the bill, sponsored by Sen. John Glenn (D-Ohio), "will be
to enhance American competitiveness and marry commercial
promotion activities--both domestic and international--with
technology development activities," Glenn said.

Creates New Civilian Technology Agency

     The legislation would also create a new agency modeled on
the Pentagon's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA).
The Advanced Civilian Technology Agency (ACTA) is envisioned as
providing seed money for specific high-risk, long-term, high-
impact areas of generic technology development not being pursued
by the private sector.
     According to Glenn, the ACTA would provide funding on a
cost-sharing basis with industry and be able to recover its cost
share from profitable projects.  He said the current Sematech
program is a good example of the type of project ACTA would fund.
Other technologies mentioned by Glenn include high-definition
imaging systems, biotechnology and superconductivity.

Elevates Technology And Economics To NSC Level

     In an effort to increase the influence of economic and trade
issues in national security matters, the Glenn bill (S 1978),
known as the Trade and Technology Promotion Act, would place the
secretaries of Industry and Technology and the Treasury as well
as the U.S. Trade Representative on the National Security Council
(NSC).
     The senator cites three years of negotiations between the
United States and Japan on the FSX coproduction agreement
"without significant input" from the Secretary of Commerce or the
U.S. Trade Representative as a reason for adding these officials
to the membership of the NSC.
     Glenn introduced the bill the last day Congress was in
session before the holiday break.  It has thus far not been
assigned to a committee and there is no set timetable for action.
This is at least the second time he has introduced such
legislation.  The new bill, he said, has significant changes over
previous bills.

U.S. LIKELY TO EASE HIGH-TECH TRADE WITH EASTERN EUROPE

     Export barriers between the United States and the Eastern
European nations of Poland and Hungary will be dismantled "to the
degree that it does not affect our national security," according
to Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher.  "We're willing to do
it with them because they have told us they will protect us and
give us the opportunity to review what they're doing with the
high-tech items."  Observers say the first such exports would
most likely be advanced computer and telecommunications systems.
     Mosbacher was not so free with the Soviet Union.  Mosbacher
said more caution will be demonstrated before making it easer to
trade high-technology items with the Soviets.  He noted the
Soviets are still a threat and that it will take awhile before
the United States is willing to give it similar permission.
"Eventually they may be included," he said, "but not yet."
     Relaxation of export restrictions could open up a multi-
million dollar export market for U.S. companies that are
currently restricted from exporting much of what they do best.
     Such a change will depend not just on the United States
reworking its regulations but an agreement by the 17 member
nations that make up the Coordinating Committee on Multilateral
Export Controls (COCOM) that governs what technologies are
permitted to be sold to Eastern Bloc nations.  However, reaching
an agreement is expected to be easy since the United States
traditionally seeks the most stringent controls.

SDI FY 91 REQUEST TO BE LESS SUBSTANTIAL THAN PLANNED

     The Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) will expect to get
less funding in FY 1991 for its research effort to defend against
ballistic missiles than was planned even a year ago.  However, it
has not yet been worked out in Pentagon budget meetings exactly
how much to request when the budget goes to Congress later this
month.
     SDI Organization Director, Lt. Gen. George L. Monahan, said
there is no direct answer to the question of how much he'll
request in FY 1991.  "We were planning a substantial increase,"
Monahan told DEFENSE TECHNOLOGY NEWS, but noted that Defense
Secretary Dick Cheney has given word out for cuts everywhere so
that an increase in SDI funding for FY 1991 "may not be that
much."  When pushed for a range, Monahan said, "We don't know if
we're going for $4.6 billion or $5.1 billion."  He said it is
still being worked out.
     Any of those figures would be a decline.  The last Reagan
budget anticipated seeking $6.7 billion in SDI funding for the
next fiscal year.

Phase One Deployment Still Possible

     Nevertheless, Monahan said a Phase I Strategic Defense
System (SDS) could still be deployed "in the late 1990s."  "We
have the technology," he said.  However, to do so would require
budget increases on the order of 25 percent per year after the
decision is made.  President Bush said over the summer that he
wanted to make such a decision in four years.  However, Monahan
said with the current budget trend "you're talking about some
extension of that time."

FY 1990 Cuts To Slip Near & Far Term Projects

     Of more immediate importance, Monahan said the cuts to the
SDI program made necessary by the magnitude of the congressional
reductions to the FY 1990 budget request were "balanced."  That
balancing act means that there has been "a slip in near-term and
a slip in far-term systems," Monahan said.  He would not be more
specific regarding the FY '90 restructurings.  Plans within the
organization call for making the changes public in early January.

Maintains Need For SDI And A Version Of An LPS

     Despite the changes taking place in Eastern Europe and the
Soviet Union, Monahan stressed that the mission SDI is to fulfill
still exists.  With its move to more mobile missiles and other
enhancements of its strategic nuclear offensive forces, Monahan
noted, "the ability of the Soviet Union has actually increased"
in recent years.  In fact, he pointed out, some people argue that
strategic defenses make even more sense in the event of massive
reductions--such as a 50 percent reduction in warheads by both
the United States and the Soviet Union--because such reductions
would place a limit on how much has to be defended against.
     Monahan came down in favor of a Limited Protection System
(LPS) to defend against Third World or accidental launches, but
stressed the need for any LPS to be part of the Phase I Strategic
Defense System now in the Demonstration/ Validation phase.  With
the possibility of 20 nations having ballistic missiles by the
turn of the century, Monahan said defense against such missiles
is probably one of the best arguments to date for an SDS.
     But he also made it clear that he favors a space-based
system because it can defend against any warhead launched at
anybody from anywhere in the world.  The ground-based
interceptors currently being pushed by others in the defense
community for a more near-term LPS, he said, are limited to
protecting the continental United States, would protect against a
much more limited threat, and may worry U.S. allies if it looks
like the United States and the Soviet Union are going to decide
to defend only themselves.

U.S. SEEKS FUNDS FOR ATOM SMASHER PROJECT

     The United States, because of recent budget constraints, has
inquired about Japanese financial support for the construction of
the Superconducting Supercollider (SSC) which is due to be
completed at an underground site in Texas by 1996.  The SSC,
which will be the largest Particle Accelerator in the world when
it is completed, will be 26 kilometers in circumference.  It is
being developed to further understand the origins of matter,
which it accomplishes by accelerating subatomic particles to
tremendous speeds and then smashing these particles together to
examine the residue that is produced.  The United States is
asking Japan to fund $1 billion of the proposed $4.4 billion
project.  The United States also asked Canada, Italy, South Korea
and India to help fund the project.  India has offered $5
million.  Japanese participation seems unlikely since the mood in
Congress does not support such cooperation at this time.

HONEYWELL DEMONSTRATES OPTICAL INTERCONNECTS

     Honeywell and Thinking Machines Corp. have successfully
demonstrated the world's first optical interconnects inside a
commercial parallel processor.  The demonstration was conducted
by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and was
monitored by Naval Air Systems Command.
     The test was conducted on a processor known as the
Connection Machine. This computer was modified by Honeywell to
replace the existing backplane wiring with the new optical
interconnects.  Where in the past the old wiring consisted of
1,000 wires, the new interconnects require only two.  Sources at
Honeywell state that the new interconnects will make it possible
to have larger, more powerful machines.  They also said this type
of configuration will enhance the abilities of machines to
perform simulation faster than before. The interconnect consists
of two 400 Mbps (megabits/second) optical fibers with
transmitter/receiver modules.  The total package is a 16,000-
processor demonstration system.  Sources at Honeywell said that
they will develop an enhanced version of the optical interconnect
board.  The new version will operate at 1.1 Gbps
(gigabits/second) with a sixfold reduction in size and an
eightfold reduction in power dissipation.  Honeywell believes
that this is possible by using custom gallium arsenide and
silicon integrated circuits and multichip packaging.

     The new optical interconnects have tremendous potential in
the area of defense.  They will make it possible to incorporate
new types of technologies that will lead to increases in
performance capabilities while at the same time enhancing
survivability.  These enhanced modules are scheduled for
demonstration in the first quarter of 1990.

U.S. R&D SPENDING SEEN RISING 4.8% TO $138.7 BILLION IN '90

     Expenditures in the United States for research and
development totaled $132.4 billion in 1989 and will increase 4.8
percent to $138.7 billion in 1990, according to the annual R&D
forecast of Battelle.  U.S. R&D spending totaled $125 billion in
1988.  The real increase in 1990 is estimated at 2.1%, versus the
10-year average of 3.1%, Battelle said.
     The forecast points out that increases in defense spending
are directed at tactical programs and advanced technology
development, as well as manufacturing technology, while the R&D
budget for strategic programs and the expansion of the technology
base show small decreases.  Battelle said it continues to expect
a slowing rate of growth in defense and total government R&D.

     *NAVY NEEDS R&D ON HOMOPOLAR PROPULSION    The David Taylor

     *NAVY NEEDS R&D ON HOMOPOLAR PROPULSION    The David Taylor
Research Center (U.S. Navy) recently asked for proposals on the
development of Homopolar Machinery and the current Collector
Technology.  The proposals are to include basic research,
exploratory developments, and advanced developments.
     Areas of interest include: improved performance, collector
concepts to enhance homopolar machinery, augmenting existing
electrical machinery, developing new technologies to reduce costs
and demonstrating feasibility.
     Homopolar propulsion is quite different from current systems
in that it utilizes superconductivity and magnetism to bring the
power generated by the power plant to the ship's propellers.  The
aim of this project is to increase efficiency, stealth, range,
reliability and flexibility.  Contact: Raymond Hesson,
Contracting Officer, 301/267-5311.

     *NASA RELEASES ATDRSS PHASE B RFP     NASA has released the
RFP for the Advanced Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System
(ATDRSS).  The first ATDRSS is set for delivery in July 1997,
when it could replace one of the three TDRS satellites now in
orbit; NASA has an additional three TDRS satellites under
construction.  The RFP, which calls for contractors to
demonstrate their capacity to design, manage, integrate and test
large, modern communications spacecraft and ground facilities, is
expected to result in two contracts of $8.3 million each.  It
will differ from TDRS in two respects: it will have a new
frequency band with a high-data rate capability of 650 million
bits per second and an enhanced multiple access system which will
increase the data rate from 50,000 bits per second to 3 million
bits per second.  Contact: Carter Dove, 301/286-5566, NASA-

NEW MILLIMETER WAVE SEEKER

     The brassboard millimeter wave seeker shown here is designed
to be used in captive and free-flight tests in Hughes Aircraft
Co.-developed Maverick missiles.  The 9.6-inch diameter seeker is
shown at a software evaluation station.  A similar unit recently
began captive flight tests.  The demonstration program is managed
by the Munitions System Division at Eglin AFB, Fla.  Millimeter
wave radar, with its small system size and high resolution, makes
autonomous target detection, acquisition and tracking possible in
a missile size package.

DAB EXPECTED TO APPROVE KE ASAT DEM/VAL IN NEXT FEW WEEKS

     The Defense Acquisition Board (DAB) is expected to discuss
and approve kinetic energy (KE) anti-satellite (ASAT) program
demonstration/validation in the next few weeks, an Air Force
official told DEFENSE TECHNOLOGY NEWS.
     Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition) John A. Betti "is
holding a tight line" and the Air Force "would not bring the
program before DAB if it thought it wasn't ready," the official
said.  He also said KE ASAT would not be fully operational for
another five to six years partly because of money problems.
     Also being studied for ASAT is Directed Energy Weapons, or
lasers, but the source said technology and funding limits their
usefulness in the near-term. DAB recently accepted the Army's
ground basing mode for KE ASAT and gave the Army the lead service
responsibility for developing a national ASAT capability (DTN,
Dec. 19, 1989).

ASAT RFP Seen In Mid-January

     Meanwhile, no time is being wasted on moving forward with
the ASAT program.  The ASAT Joint Program Office will release the
final RFP for a kinetic energy ASAT weapon system on or about
Jan. 15.  The RFP will address dem/val and tactical system
design.  Funding for the ASAT will support a scaled down option.

Command, attn. CSSD-H-CRR, PO Box 1500, Huntsville, AL 35807.
