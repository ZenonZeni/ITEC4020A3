ELECTRONIC COMMERCE OPENS IMAGING UP
Vendors Should Look to Specialized Markets in 1996 

     The emergence of imaging as an electronic commerce tool will offer
new opportunities this year to vendors savvy enough to meet the needs of
the extended enterprise, as businesses seek to use the Internet for
moving the paper associated with marketing, distribution, sales and
purchasing, industry experts say.
     The goal will be "passing information between vendors ... via E-
mail or the Internet," says Ed McIerney, vice president of software
business with Wang Laboratories Inc. of Billerica, Mass.    
     Another big factor to look for in 1996 is more cooperation among
vendors as the industry seeks to deal with the consequences of its
consolidation last year.  Companies will have to work together on
developing software and faster- peripheral products, to address users'
demands, we're told.  
     Collaboration also will help the industry come up with new
innovations more quickly, simplifying the offerings for systems
integrators who are often left to choose between a large number of
companies to create a complete solution, says Harold Gubnitsky,
director with Cambridge, Mass.-based Cambridge Technology Partners'
Intelligent Document Management division.    

Ally with Large Partners

     Alliances with large partners who plan to take advantage of
electronic commerce opportunities will enable mid-sized imaging
vendors to make a name for themselves.  
     Previously hidden behind the giants, they now can begin to shine,
the experts say.  Be advised vendors must choose, however, which
segment of the market to shine in, or be left behind.
     Vendors who choose a specific market for their imaging products
will provide their customers with greater value-add than those who do
not strengthen their hands by finding a specialty to serve within an
already niche- marketplace.  Health care providers will know they are
getting the best imaging system designed for health care, for example;
the same will be true for the financial area, say the experts.
     Both users and vendors are looking toward the "commoditization"
or interoperability of imaging components.  Experts predict more and
more components will be off-the-shelf next year.  In addition, the
emergence of more standards will help propel further growth,
particularly in the storage arena.
     Look for the Internet to play a much larger role in the
development this year of imaging technology as an increasingly mobile
workforce demands links not only to text, but also images.  "How you
route the image, share the indexing information about a file not only
within a department, but within regions or districts around the world,
will play a significant part of the document management" and imaging
marketplace, says Gubnitsky.
     David Skok, president of Burlington, Mass.-based Watermark says
in agreement:  "The keys to success in 1996 will be the Internet/Web
enabling of imaging, document management and workflow products." 
     Simplifying the industry from one saturated with too many imaging
vendors in all segments of the business, to one with only a few large
players means that systems integrators and users will find it easier
to choose a complete imaging solution.  "Most potential buyers are not
able to make informed decisions, relying instead on serendipity," says
Gubnitsky.
     Only three major platform vendors will dominate production-level
imaging this year, predicts Suresh Shenoy, vice president with
Information Management Consultants, based in McLean, Va.  They are: 
FileNet  and its acquisition Watermark, Microsoft  and its alliance
with Billerica, Mass.-based Wang and the combination of IBM and
acquired Lotus.  He says mid-sized vendors will cooperate for
solutions at all levels of the enterprise.
     "The challenge for the mid-tiered [companies] will be to find a
maturing channel and name recognition for themselves," adds Erik
Brown, senior analyst with Cambridge, Mass.-based Forrester Research. 
This name recognition will tie a vendor nicely with what has become a
more segmented or specialized marketplace.

Specialized Market Segments To Grow

     Many analysts agree that vendors are going to have to specialize
in specific market segments in order to make a name for themselves. 
For instance, Brown says it won't matter whether or not your
processing system works in two-tenths of a second or one-tenth of a
second.  
     The real challenge for 1996 will be in how a vendor adds value to
its imaging product line.  This will be achieved by "choosing a
particular      
application within the technology," he says.  Otherwise, "the door
will close." 
     What does this mean for those already working within an industry
segment? 
     It means that companies such as Dallas-based BancTec, which
merged with Recognition last year, is poised to work even more closely
with its partners in the financial marketplace.  With BancTec already
a player in remittance processing, you can expect it to work more
closely with community banks, spokesman George Christian told us.  

Storage Technology Set To Advance

     According to industry insiders, the advancement of imaging
technology continues to develop.  In particular, vendors are expecting
better interoperability for Computer Output to Laser Disk (COLD)
storage this year as standards are perfected. 
     BancTec plans to concentrate on what Christian calls
open/archiving.  This is a concept designed for customer service, he
says. 
     For example, a request is scanned into an imaging system and
stored on the hard disk for up to three days.  Then, the data will be
moved to an optical media for up to 60 days, after which it will be
transferred to either linear tape or some other inexpensive device for
one year's storage.  
     The reason for this new technology?  Many customers tell BancTec
that 80 percent of all their requests are received within the first 30
days of processing, so after 30 days the information does not need to
be immediately accessible, says Christian.
     "COLD technology is one that has not had as much attention [as
others],"  says Gubnitsky.  The challenge will be to separate COLD
with traditional document management, he says.  

Commoditization of Imaging:  Help or Hurt?

     It's hard to predict whether or not commoditization of imaging
technology will help or hurt the industry.  Experts differ in their
opinions, particularly those involved most directly with designing
systems.  McIerney says commoditization will provide his company with
many opportunities in 1996.  The free-bundled imaging now available
with Microsoft's Windows 95 and Windows NT, for example, will provide
users previously unfamiliar with imaging a taste of it.
     "People will work with images, like it, enjoy it, start using it
more, then discover they have a disk full of images," he says.  What
this means is a need for more storage.  Wang will now be able to
provide a storage solution through its recent acquisition of Avail of
Colo.  In addition, Wang will be poised to handle any calls requesting
imaging upgrades--something the stockholders are counting on, says
McIerney.  

Where Does Document Management Fit?

     Vendors look to 1996 to be the year that users apply new found
understanding of document management to purchasing decisions.  The
experts agree that document management is more of a process, under
which technologies as imaging, workflow, faxing and storage operate as
component parts.
     Shenoy explains that document management is not imaging and it is
not workflow.  "Document management is being able to manage the
production, revision, storage, access, presentation and distribution
of information created in such an imaging system," he says.

INTRAFED ACTS AS VAR AND ITS OWN SUPPLIER 

     Bethesda-Md.-based INTRAFED's efforts to position itself as a
large-scale image capture vendor should help the company compete
against new rival, San Jose, Calif.-based Cornerstone.  Jeff
Meshinksy, one of the founders of INTRAFED, along with his father,
says his company plans to "use its installed base" as its major
resource against its competitors like Cornerstone and Irvine, Calif.-
based Kofax. 
     INTRAFED is a developer of software capture systems and acts as
both a value added reseller (VAR), as well as competes as an
individual vendor for  contracts in both the commercial and government
arena.  
     INTRAFED has "good reference lists" for a shrink-wrapped product,
says Kimra Hawley, vice president and general manager of software
tools and input systems division with Cornerstone (see related story,
p. 5).  If the user wants to purchase all the component parts for
image capture from one company INTRAFED is the choice for them because
its product is "straight-forward and very production oriented," she
says.  This type of component-based system will help save money and
time because users don't have to build the systems themselves.

Areas Served:  Commercial, government (30 percent federal)
Customers:  U.S. Army, U.S. Navy, Federal Express

Choosing Multiple Partners

     INTRAFED has made it a point to work with 36 different suppliers,
integrating their products directly into the INTRAFED image capture
solution, in particular Rochester, N.Y.-based Kodak's scanners.  
     Dan Elam, consultant with Imaging Consulting of Saluda, Va. says
INTRAFED has worked exclusively with Kodak for some time now.  This
relationship is something to follow as INTRAFED moves toward a more
open-architecture strategy to include any scanner as the front-end to
its imaging solution, he says. 

Gulf War Continues to Bring in Dollars

     One of its original production-level systems in 1990 was for
Desert Storm during the Gulf War--scanning and processing more than 12
million intelligence documents in two-and-a-half months.  The U.S.
Army needed intelligence data available to them in the bunkers about
the Iraqis, which before would have been decrypted by hand, says
Meshinsky.  Using Kodak scanners, INTRAFED uploaded the data into an
IBM ImagePlus retrieval system, integrating the intelligence
information quickly for the solders' retrieval, says Meshinsky.
     Another project expected to continue the Gulf War work for
INTRAFED is the Declassification program.  It involves converting 17
million pages of records from the Gulf War operations to images. 
These records will be used to research potential causes of the
illnesses experienced by Gulf War veterans, often referred to as the
"Gulf War Syndrome."  
     The U.S. Army is intent upon putting this declassified
information onto the Internet and the World Wide Web for medical
personnel to evaluate and review for possible cures.  Up to 20,000
document images will be converted per day, according to INTRAFED.  For
the high-speed capture of the images, INTRAFED's PowerScan software
controls two Kodak 500 ImageLink scanners, which will produce
electronic image files and related indexing information.  Images then
are passed directly to StageWorks for quality control, rescanning if
necessary, image enhancement--such as deskewing, optical character
recognition and directly to the Excalibur EFS Format Bridge.  
     This bridge--a point of pride for INTRAFED according to
Meshinsky--formats image, text and index data for use in a
specifically designated indexing system.  

INTRAFED Allies with ICS

     INTRAFED recently allied took a partner in the conversion
business, Image Conversion Systems based in Arlington Heights, Ill. 
ICS was a division of Anacomp, also of Arlington Heights.  Its focus
has been on image conversion, but John Messinger, formerly with
Anacomp, wanted to buy out the ICS division to stand on its own.  The
buyout took place Nov. 1.
     As part of the new alliance with ICS, INTRAFED will help the
company upgrade its 11 conversion centers in such cities as San Diego,
Chicago, Indianapolis and St. Louis.  ICS will use a combination of
PowerScan and StageWorks to convert 52 million images per year.  (Jeff
Meshinsky, INTRAFED, 301/564-5600; Kimra Hawley, Cornerstone, 408/325-
3840, Dan Elam, Imaging Consulting, 804/758-5755.) 

CORNERSTONE RELEASES INPUTACCEL

     It may seem that San Jose, Calif.-based Cornerstone's InputAccel
has been on the market for some time because of the company hyping it
for so long, but it was finally released at the end of last year.  The
modular image capture solution was pre-announced in April, 1994, to
"signal the market" that Cornerstone was entering the image capture
market.  It also enabled the peripherals vendors to begin making their
products compatible with InputAccel, Kimra Hawley, vice president and
general manager for the software tools and input systems division,
said.
     The product was six months late from a development standpoint,
says Hawley--although it was held on purpose.  After bringing in
representatives from service bureaus, systems integrator and scanning
operators, Cornerstone decided to make some changes to the product
based on the users' feedback.  "Fortunately, we weren't in need of
revenue," says Hawley, so we could afford to wait.
     Hawley describes the possible solutions in the input capture
market in four categories:

     * A modular approach--such as InputAccel which includes server,
scan, image processing, OCR and image export.
     * Shrinkwrapped--hard-coded systems offered by INTRAFED or Kofax. 
     * Monolithic suppliers, such as FileNet, may already have an
imaging installation--they will most likely just "add-on" the image
capture portion of the system.
     * Toolkits--Users can build their own system from the ground up
with DiamondHead or Imagination Software's products.

     Cornerstone can plug and play its "modules" in InputAccel with up
to 33 different image capture vendors' products without the integrator
having to do any programming, says Hawley.  The product was designed
based upon extensive interviews with systems integrator like Price
Waterhouse and Grumman, which were looking for a less expensive, less
time-consuming solution to the image capture industry. 
     Cornerstone's first customers are:  CTB-McGraw Hill, CADPAC of
Ohio, and Stanford Health Services of Palo Alto, Calif.  (Cornerstone,
408/325-3840.)

FEDERAL EXPRESS CHOOSES BLUERIDGE FOR AIRCRAFT RECORDS. 

 Blueridge Technologies of Flint Hill, Va., installed its OPTIX
Document Management System at Memphis, Tenn.-based Federal Express Air
Operations Department.  The system is used to store, retrieve and
manage engineering and maintenance records for FedEx's fleet of more
than 500 aircraft.  FedEx has accumulated over 700,000 aperture cards,
with a backlog of "several million documents" according to company
executives.  As many as 165 employees at FedEx headquarters have
access to the records archived on the OPTIX system.  Engineers in
remote locations may retrieve records in seconds by means of a dial-in
connection, say executives at FedEx.  FedEx serves more than 325
airports and more than 200 countries.  OPTIX helped the company solve
a problem directly from the Charles DeGaul airport in Paris when
technicians misplaced a serviceable tag on an oxygen tank.  Using
OPTIX, a copy of the serviceable tag was "pulled up" on the system and
faxed to Paris, enabling the plane to continue its route.  Otherwise,
the plane would have been grounded, said company executives.

AIIM SEARCHES FOR NEW LEADER IN 1996 

The Association for Information and Image Management International
(AIIM) faces a crossroads in the loss of its 20-year veteran,
president Sue Wolk even as the market is shifting from proprietary- to
client-server- and open-systems.  
     In what several AIIM members say will be a large leadership gap
to fill as one who was always far ahead of the power curve, Wolk
leaves AIIM at an important time in the history of imaging, says
Thorton May, consultant with Cambridge, Mass.-based Cambridge
Technology Partners.  
     Wolk plans to stay through the end of April.  The goal is to find
a replacement by the time the yearly AIIM convention convenes in
Chicago this March 31 to April 3.  If they do not meet that goal, Wolk
says she will stay a little longer.
     The board of directors has established a search committee and put
in place a management transition team, with Wolk aiding the team.  The
committee will work directly with Washington, D.C.-based Foster
Partners, a division of Washington, D.C.-based KPMG Peat Marwick,
AIIM's auditing firm.  

AIIM's Diversity Adds to Search

     In addition to this historic shift in the industry from large
proprietary systems to more workstation, client-server-based systems,
Wolk says AIIM has become a very diverse organization with both
corporate members and end-user members.  "This [diversity] is what
makes us successful," she says.  
     This diversity requires a leader who will not go along routinely
with the board of directors, as one member said Wolk has done.  Yet
the new president will have to balance new leadership with recognition
of AIIm's advancement under Wolk, the same member told DIR.
