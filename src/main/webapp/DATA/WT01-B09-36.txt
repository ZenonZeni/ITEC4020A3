<h3><FONT COLOR=#808080>Paving The Way for a Thriving New Industry</FONT></h3>

<P>
Combining the electric transportation technology
experience of the Sacramento Municipal Utility District and the
advanced research and development capabilities of McClellan Air
Force Base, members of the Sacramento Electric Transportation
Consortium have made great strides toward developing electric
transportation technologies. This broad&#173;based consortium
is paving the way for a thriving new U.S. manufacturing industry
while enhancing our nation's military readiness.<BR>
</FONT>
<P><h3><FONT COLOR=#808080>The SMUD Mission</FONT></h3>
<P>
The Sacramento Consortium has successfully leveraged
federal funds with millions of private dollars to dramatically
enhance electric transportation technology research and development
on a national scale. Its goals:<P><ul>

<li> Stronger national defense through technological superiority, economic
and energy security;
<P>
<li> Develop advanced, efficient EV components and charging infrastructure
to minimize utility system impacts of military and civilian EV
charging;</FONT>
<P><li> Utilize existing advanced technologies and
highly trained personnel throughout the nation and at McClellan
Air Force Base; </FONT>
<P><li> Improve air quality nationwide.</FONT>
<P><li> Aerojet General Corporation and H Power Systems have begun their project
to develop very compact proton exchange membrane fuel cell stacks
utilizing integrated fluid management made possible by Aerojet's
platelet technology. The consortium is installing a unit in an
existing composite-based vehicle fueled with compressed hydrogen.
This will result in the consortium's first hybrid EV.

<P><h3><FONT COLOR=#808080>Advanced Lead-Acid Battery Testing and Development</FONT></h3><p>

A pack
of <I>Horizon </I>advanced lead-acid batteries, produced by Electrosource,
Inc., has been range-tested in the Sacramento Consortium's composite
<I>Pickup I. </I>With 80% depth of discharge, the vehicle can
travel in excess of 110 miles on a single charge in city traffic
averaging approximately 40 mph.</FONT>
<P>
During the same tests, the vehicle achieved an astonishing
9.23 miles/DC kWh. This high level of efficiency is due partly
to the ultra-efficient battery system, including the high in&#173;out
efficiency of the Horizon batteries, ultra-efficient charging
system and the efficient design of the vehicle itself.</FONT>
<P>
<h3><FONT COLOR=#808080>Purpose&#173;Built Composite EV</FONT></h3><p>
A full&#173;scale model of the Sacramento Consortium's second
generation purpose&#173;built, composite, lightweight and safe
electric vehicle, the <I>Pickup II, </I>was recently unveiled
at the Los Angeles International Auto Show. A fully functional
vehicle will be completed May, 1995. The first generation vehicle
has been in operation since May, 1994, and is operating as a test-bed
for &quot;real&#173;world&quot; testing of the <I>Horizon </I>battery.</FONT>
<P>
The newest, most advanced composite pickup was rolled&#173;out
in May, 1995 in Washington, D.C. A similar vehicle is expected
to be available for fleet purchases in the next two to three years.</FONT>
<P>

<h3><FONT COLOR=#808080>Electromechanical Flywheel Development</FONT></h3><p>

An engineering test unit is being developed for performance
testing. Recently, a prototype motor/generator has completed high-speed
testing exceeding 60,000 rpm. The rotor design has been completed,
materials have been selected and rotor fabrication and testing
will be completed by late Spring, 1995. Progress on other components
is leading toward completion of the Engineering Development Unit
by November, 1995.<BR>

<h3><FONT COLOR=#808080>Neighborhood Electric Vehicles</FONT></h3>
<p>

Pacific Electric Vehicles
has designed and built a four&#173;wheeled neighborhood electric
vehicle based on the Danish three&#173;wheeled City&#173;El. Additionally,
a prototype neighborhood EV is scheduled for delivery this summer.
This economical composite materials-based vehicle will accommodate
two passengers plus about four cubic feet of cargo; be designed
for forty&#173;plus mph cruising speed; and be designed to satisfy
federal safety standards. This vehicle will be ideal for non&#173;highway
travel on military bases and campus&#173;type settings as well
as neighborhoods throughout the nation.us_<BR>
