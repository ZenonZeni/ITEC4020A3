Thanks to Larry Durney, <BR>
Plating Clinic Columnist

</CENTER>
<P><B>For more than 20 years</B> Larry Durney tried to solve the technical 
electroplating problems of anyone who wrote the &quot;Finishing Clinic&quot; (in more 
recent years, the &quot;Plating Clinic&quot;). He was our Ann Landers.
<P>A lot of platers benefited not only from his replies to their own queries, 
but from reading his advice to others. Problems that occur in one plating shop 
are likely to bedevil others as well. So if you don't have the problem today 
you may have it tomorrow. 
<P>Larry's replies were based largely on experience. He spent his early 
post-college years in rubber boots on a plating line, solving his own 
problems. Later he worked for suppliers of proprietary chemicals in &quot;technical 
service,&quot; which translates to &quot;OK, I bought your stuff and now I'm getting rejects, 
so DO SOMETHING.&quot; Larry did something. But unlike a lot of us, he had 
a memory chip in his head that contained information about what he had 
done and why it had worked or not worked. 
<P>I've talked to readers who don't do plating, but they read the column. 
They just like to read his advice to the people who have tried everything 
and nothing has worked.  After all, if the solution for the problem were 
obvious, the plater wouldn't write.
<P>Eventually Larry became the technical director of a plating-supply 
company. There he concocted chemicals that produced more good parts than 
bad, making the lives of technical service persons less arduous. And 
pre-solving some problems for many platers.
<P>In the years since he retired from the world of eight-hour days with 
beakers and flasks nearby, he has written the Plating Clinic column. Taught 
courses. Wrote books. Was the editor of the Electroplating Engineering 
Handbook. And did some consulting for people who wanted to pay for a private 
session with the wizard.
<P>Amazingly he still had time for fishing, electronics tinkering, 
grandchildren (his seven children have been increasing the Durney clan), and 
bouncing back and forth between a cottage in Cape Cod and his home in 
New Jersey.
<P>Now he's decided to take more time for those personal pursuits. 
So regretfully he's written his last response to a PF reader.
<P>It has been a pleasure to work with Larry. He was prompt. He 
explained patiently why chemicals do what they do and why sometimes plating is 
still an art as well as a science. He showed his sense of humor in answering 
serious questions.
<P> Best of all, when we surveyed readers and asked what they liked 
about Products Finishing, &quot;Plating 
Clinic&quot; always was among the top scores. As a former editor of PF, that's the 
greatest compliment I can give to a columnist.
<P>We wish all the best for Larry and his family in the coming years. <I> Jerry 
Poll.</I>     <B>PF</B>
