Sacramento has enjoyed a great history of baseball dating back to as early as
1886. The first team was known as the "Sacramento Atlas" and played in the
California League. During the early 1900's the name was changed to the
"Wolves" and later to the "Buffalos". From 1918 to 1935 the team adopted the
name of "Senators" which was later shortened to "Solons", a synonym for the
word Senators in 1936. From 1936 to 1960 the Solons played at Edmonds Field
located in downtown Sacramento at Riverside Blvd. and Broadway near the Tower
Theater. Thousands of Sacramento baseball fans came out to the ballpark to
cheer on their Solons and enjoy a great game of baseball. <i>(Photo courtesy of

The original Edmonds Field was a wood structure as shown here in 1948. It was
first constructed in 1922 and was known as Moreing Field after the teams owner,
Lew Moreing. The stadium changed names three times before being called Edmonds
Field in 1945. Dick Edmonds was the Sacramento Union's sports editor and was
instrumental in helping keep the Solons in Sacramento. In 1944 he persuaded a
local business group to buy the team from the St. Louis Cardinals, who wanted
to move them to Tacoma. On July 18th, 1948 a fire destroyed the stadium. In
less than a year the stadium was rebuilt, this time with concrete and was ready
for the home opener in 1949. <i>(Photo courtesy of the Sacramento Bee)</i>

The Sacramento Senators played in the Pacific Coast League from 1918 to 1935. 
Their name changed to the Solons in 1936 and they continued to play at Edmonds
Field until 1960.  A new Solons team moved from Eugene, Oregon and played in
Sacramento from 1974 to 1976 at Hughes Stadium. <i>(Photo courtesy of McCurry)</i>
