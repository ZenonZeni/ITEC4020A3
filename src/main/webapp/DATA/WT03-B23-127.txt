<P>
In a 1995 client survey conducted by Arthur Andersen, when asked
"...to describe Tucker Anthony in a word or two,"  the
responses listed in order of frequency were:

<B><UL>
<LI>Reliable / Dependable</LI>
<LI>Trustworthy / Honest / Integrity</LI>
<LI>Friendly / Cordial / Nice / Polite / Family-like</LI>
<LI>Personal / Personal Service</LI>

</UL></B>

<P>
With descriptions like these, it is very easy to understand
why <STRONG>85.8%</STRONG> of the respondents expressed satisfaction with the firm's
services. When the same survey asked our clients to compare Tucker
Anthony with other investment firms in terms of our Investment
Executives being capable or trustworthy, <STRONG>84.3%</STRONG> of the respondents
rated our firm as superior. Maybe that's why so many of our customers
are lifelong clients.
