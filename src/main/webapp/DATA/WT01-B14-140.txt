Typhoon Violet is revealed by the wind vectors (dark arrows) and the
precipitable water (color image) on 21 September 1996, just before it hits
the Honshu Island of Japan, causing damage and death.  The wind  and water
vapor are derived from the observations by the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration Scatterometer [NSCAT] on the Japanese Advanced Earth
Observing Satellite [ADEOS] and the Special Sensor Microwave / Imager
[SSM/I] on the operational spacecraft, F-13, of the Defense Meteorological
Space Program, along their respective ascending orbits which are roughly
five hours apart.  Since the start of ocean observing mode on 15 September,
NSCAT has observed the evolution of Violet from a tropical cyclone into an
extratropical storm with developing frontal structure (in the northeast),
increasing asymetry, and intrusion of drier air into the core.<P>
 
The overlay of wind on precipitable water dramatically visualizes not only
the structure of this evolving system, but also the relation between the
dynamics and the hydrologic balance in the mesoscale.  The figure also
demonstrates the capability of microwave sensors under both clear and
cloudy conditions.  The detailed structure of the wind-field also
illustrates the high spatial resolution of NSCAT.
