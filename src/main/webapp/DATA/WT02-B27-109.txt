As metacognition emerges into the mainstream of education and cognitive psychology, issues such as the measurement of metacognition, definition of the construct, and so forth, emerge, and need to be addressed. 

<H3 ALIGN=LEFT>Definition of the Construct</H3>

Although Flavell (1976, 1979) defined metacognition as "knowledge concerning one's own cognitive processes and products or anything related to them... [such as] active monitoring and consequent regulation and orchestration of these processes," there is currently some debate as to what exactly metacognition should be defined as. Some object to simple knowledge (such as knowledge of which strategy to use for a particular problem, or knowledge of stragtegies to remember something) being labeled metacognition. As Gentile (1996) points out, "knowing about your circulatory system, what affects it, and strategis for maintaining its' functioning at optimal levels would be considered [a] cognitive strategy...so why shouldn't knowing about your learning and memory be considered cognitive processes?". This line of argument attempts to constrain metacognition to active monitoring, conscious control, or executive regulation of mental processes.<BR>
<BR>
This line of discussion is fruitful, as metacognition appears to have suffered "construct creep", to coin a term. Authors have used this term to refer to everything from knowledge of strategies, executive control of strategies, and self-monitoring of activity to such things as checking solutions to linear equations, listing possible strategies for attacking a problem, detection of errors within a reading passage, prediction of grades, knowledge of sources of motivation, and self-correction of errors. While this process is common when new constructs appear, and generate considerable enthusiasm, it is necessary to arrive at a fairly clear conceptual definition of what metacognition is, or risk having everything becoming metacognition, in which case the construct loses its' meaning.<BR><BR>

<H3 ALIGN=LEFT>Measuring Metacognition</H3>

As researchers, measurement is the basis for all activity. I believe that this is the weakest aspect to current metacognitive research at present. I believe that this deficiency arises from two problems: an ill-defined construct and reliance upon self-report measures.<BR>
<BR>
Because the construct is ill-defined, many operationalizations of metacognition are suspect. Specifically, measuring metacognition in terms of correctly listing a certain number of strategies for solving a problem may be measuring recall of a discussion, and may have nothing to do with the student's cognition in relation to actually solving a problem.<BR>
<BR>
Additionally, many studies that attempt to do more than measure knowledge have tried innovative operationalizations, such as asking students to verbalize their cognition while trying to perform a task, and coding for metacognition (i.e., a student who says something like "Ah, this is where I made the mistake last time" would be scored as being metacognitive). Unfortunately, self-report measures of cognition are nototiously problematic. They assume that students (often young students) are aware of their cognition and metacognition, that they are accurate and unbiased observers of their own cognition and metacognition, and that they can report their observations accurately. I think few people would accept all three of these assumptions, especially for young children. Self-reports of prior strategy use that are "off-line" are even more suspect. (Note that although metacognition is executive and regulatory, it has never been said that it needs to be conscious or purposeful -- it is possible and even likely that at least some metacognition is automatized and below conscious awareness....)<BR>
<BR>
One direction I am working on, and encourage others to think about, is how to measure or assess metacognitive activity in a fairly unobtrusive, yet valid, fashion. Of particular interest would be a behavioral measure that would avoid the problems delineated above associated with self-reports.<BR><BR>

<H3 ALIGN=LEFT>What About Other Subject Areas?</H3>

Most (at least 90%) of all metacognition research and effort has gone into teaching reading. People are beginning to look at mathematics (where my interests lie), but almost nothing has been done in other areas. Notably absent are: science, language, social sciences, fine arts, music, and so forth. Here are some musings of my own:<BR>
<UL>
<LI> How do students of a new language know when they have spoken incorrectly? What sorts of strategies do they use to monitor their understanding and production of language?<BR>
<BR>
<LI> How do scientists know when they have a reasonable answer, and when 
they need to delve further into a phenomenon? How do we know what questions to ask, or when to ask questions?<BR>
<BR>
<LI> Is transfer between areas related to metacognition? If so, in what way?<BR>
<BR>
<LI> How do computer programmers know when they have made a mistake, even 
before they run a program-- do they have a mental "processor" in their minds running the program while they write? Does programming a computer make one more metacognitive in other areas by having an external source pointing out mistakes? And could reciprocal teaching or group projects do something similar?<BR>
<BR>
<LI> How does a musician know when they have made a subtle mistake? Is this 
metacognition in certain circumstances?<BR>
<BR>
<LI> Do artists use metacognition in some ways? If so, how? Do we need to 
expand the definition of the construct to incorporate this sort of activity, or does it fall under the current definition? 
</UL>
Do people in the "real world" use metacognition? If so, who, and is it similar to metacognition that students use, or different in some way?<BR>
<BR>
