The past 20 years have seen tremendous growth in the number of patients seeking homeopathic care and, consequently, a dramatic increase in the number of practitioners seeking knowledge of and educational opportunities in homeopathy towards application in their practices. The practice of Homeopathy was considered a fringe or alternative and obscure philosophy and practice of medicine.  It has, however, found its way onto center stage, if not completely into the mainstream of progressive and integrated medical practice.<P>
<IMG SRC="pic3.gif" BORDER=2 HSPACE=6 VSPACE=6 ALIGN=LEFT ALT="Patients visit providers of alternative therapies." WIDTH=180 HEIGHT=177>In 1990, it was estimated that 1 in 3 Americans used alternative therapies and most did not tell their conventional physician.  In 1993, Dr. Eisenberg & colleagues published a survey in Journal of Family Practice estimating that patients made 425 million visits to providers of alternative therapies (compared with 388 million visits to primary care physicians) and spent $13.7 billion dollars, $10.3 billion of which was out of pocket.<P>
This growth in homeopathy has been paralleled by an equally impressive increase in homeopathic research.  Homeopathic research now appears in prominent, pier-reviewed scientific and medical journals.  Most prominent among these have been the articles by Dr. Jennifer Jacobs appearing in Pediatrics on the homeopathic treatment of diarrhea in children, and Dr. David Taylor Reilly's report on reproducible outcomes in homeopathy appearing in the Lancet.  Both of these double blind placebo controlled studies meet the most stringent criteria for medical methodology and support positive homeopathic treatment outcomes.<P>
Additionally, in response to the demand for more research into alternative therapies, last October the Office of Alternative Medicine (OAM) funded eight Complementary and Alternative Medicine Research Centers to evaluate various complementary or alternative medicine (CAM) therapies through high quality research.  These centers are expected to focus the scope of their activities on the areas of rehabilitation, women's health, pain, pain management, aging, cancer prevention and treatment, allergy treatment, and the safety, efficacy, and cost-effectiveness of CAM therapies for common, chronic medical conditions.<P>
The acceptance of alternative therapies in conventional medical practices is growing. Many major medical schools and universities are responding to the requests for more research and education, and have added to their curriculum Complimentary Medical courses that include classes on Homeopathy.  These universities include the College of Physicians and Surgeons at Columbia University, Harvard Medical School, The University of Illinois College of Medicine, Georgetown University Medical School and the University of Arizona, just to name a few.  In the state of Washington, Blue Cross offered a 1-year pilot program in which the response was so "overwhelming" that is has added a plan, called AlternaPath, that will provide coverage for those services traditionally disallowed by most health insurance plans.  Approved medications under this plan include herbal and homeopathic remedies, and vitamins.<P>
