<H1>Beware of the IRS's Right of Redemption</H1>
<HR>
Whenever you represent a lienholder in bidding on encumbered property at foreclosure or a judicial sale, and in so doing you will be extinguishing a junior federal tax lien, beware of how the IRS's statutory right of redemption (as set forth at 28 U.S.C. Section 2410, of the Internal Revenue Code, and 26 U.S.C. Section 7425(d))   applies in your state.  If the IRS is made a party to a suit to quiet title, foreclose a mortgage or other lien or any other action, the IRS has the right (within 120 days of sale) to pay "the actual amount paid by the purchaser at such sale which, in the case of a purchaser who is the holder of the lien being foreclosed, shall include the amount of the obligation secured by such lien to the extent satisfied by reason of such sale . . . ." 28 U.S.C. Section 2410(c).  Malpractice claims have arisen where the attorney is unfamiliar with the IRS right of redemption, and successfully bids the property in for his lienholder at less than the full amount of the lien (e.g.,  to save Commissioner's fees).  Thereafter, the IRS notifies the lien holder/purchaser of its intent to exercise its right of redemption by tendering to the lien holder/purchaser the actual amount he paid for the property.  This forces the lien holder/purchaser to either negotiate with the IRS to pay off the outstanding tax liens or to accept less than the full amount of his security interest in satisfaction of the debt.  Where the value of the property equals or exceeds the lien holder's payment, the IRS's exercise of its redemption rights can result in actual damages to the lien holder and could form the basis for a legal malpractice claim.  Being aware of this right and its application in your jurisdiction will allow you to properly counsel the lienholder in determining the bid range or amount.
