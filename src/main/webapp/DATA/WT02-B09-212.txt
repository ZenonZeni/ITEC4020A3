<p>Near the beginning of this century, the fastest way to find out how your favorite sports team fared in
the big game--besides attending in person--was to catch the news report on the radio or in the next
morning's newspaper.  Now, as the twenty-first century approaches, such constraints simply no longer
exist.  Recent technology has provided avid sports fans with results, statistics, and other information
from almost any major sporting event--almost instantly!</p>

<p>For example, nowadays, such television stations as CNN's Headline News provide continuous score
updates on a scrolling "screen crawler."  Packages on such television systems as DirectTV allow fans
to enjoy virtually any major sporting event through satellite technology.  Additionally, numerous
Internet websites provide instantaneous sports score and injury information with a quick click of a
mouse-button.</p>

<center><img src = "animbar.gif" height = 7 width = 600></center>

<p>Responding to the obvious demand from thousands of enthusiastic fans for immediate sports
information, STATS, Inc. and Motorola, Inc. have developed and marketed the latest technological
gizmo--but not without prompting a great deal of legal controversy.  Additionally, they put a jazzed-up
version on an Internet site, offering it as a service available from America Online.</p>

<p>"SportsTrax" is a wireless paging device that provides up-to-the-minute information about various
sporting events in progress.  STATS, Inc. has hired people from all around the country to watch
television broadcasts of particular games and enter the statistics and results on a computer as the game
is played.  This data is then transmitted to a satellite that beams the information to anyone possessing a
SportsTrax pager.  With the touch of a button, the pager's liquid crystal display reveals such
information as a baseball game's score, the inning, who is on base, who is at bat; a basketball game's
score, time remaining and ball possession information--it even shows a graphic rendition of a
basketball court that illustrates the position of the ball during the game.  The pager allows sports fans
to "attend" any game when access to tickets, a television, or a radio is either inconvenient or
unrealistic.  The companion web site provides similar information online.</p>

<center><img src = "animbar.gif" height = 7 width = 600></center>

<p>The legal controversy stems from the fact that the paging system and Internet site were broadcast and
marketed without the authorization of the sports leagues, television stations, or radio stations that are
in the business of conveying the broadcasts to the public.  As a result, the National Basketball
Association brought suit against STATS, Inc. and Motorola, Inc. in a New York federal court this past
year. <i><b>National Basketball Ass'n v. Sports Team Analysis & Tracking Systems, Inc.</i></b>, 939
F. Supp. 1071 (S.D.N.Y. 1996).  Because STATS, Inc. does not pay to "publish" the sports
information to its customers, the NBA claimed that STATS, Inc. was liable for copyright infringement
and commercial misappropriation.  The NBA sought to recover damages it incurred as a result of the
device as well as to force STATS, Inc. to cease all SportsTrax operations.</p>

<center><img src = "animbar.gif" height = 7 width = 600></center>

<p>The NBA's unfair competition claim was premised on "common law" (that is, the law that emerges
from decisions made by judges in cases over the years, in this instance New York case law).  The
NBA asserted that it possesses the exclusive right to use and license "NBA Intellectual Property" in
conjunction with advertising, promotion, and other products and services in all forms of commerce and
media.  New York law, which is similar to laws in states around the U.S., forbids "taking the skill,
expenditures, and labors of a competitor and misappropriat[ing] for the commercial advantage of one
person . . . a benefit or property right belonging to another."  Sometimes even
factual information--if commercially valuable--is protectable under this law.</p>

<p>The ability to control the dissemination of sports information is undoubtedly valuable to the sports
leagues.  Consequently, the sports leagues employ various methods of limiting others' use of their
events or broadcasts without permission.  Nowadays, when a patron buys a ticket to an event, such as
a basketball game, it is common for the back of the ticket to exhibit a warning.  For example--"you
agree that you will not transmit or aid in transmitting any description, account, picture, or
reproduction of the event to which this ticket admits you."  In an attempt to protect the value of its
$750 million, four-year contract with NBC, televised NBA games are now broadcast along with a
warning that "this program is authorized under the rights granted by the National Basketball
Association," and that unauthorized use of "the pictures, descriptions or accounts" of the game is
prohibited.  According to papers filed in the lawsuit, the SportsTrax manufacturers originally sought a
license from the NBA to sell such information to the public via wireless communications, but the
negotiations eventually broke down and STATS, Inc. marketed the pager anyway.</p>

<center><img src = "animbar.gif" height = 7 width = 600></center>

<p>In its copyright claim, the NBA asserted that it owns the copyrights in all broadcasts and transmissions
in all media of NBA games, and that STATS, Inc. should be prohibited from using game information
for commercial profit.  Congress enacted our current copyright law, which gives authors exclusive
rights to their "original works" for a finite period.  The law endeavors to protect creative expression. 
Prohibiting others' use of <i>factual</i> information--which is in the public domain--is generally
disallowed as too broad under copyright law.</p>

<center><img src = "animbar.gif" height = 7 width = 600></center>

<p>Because copyright law does not allow an author to
prohibit the reproduction of facts included in a copyrighted work, the NBA could not recover under a
copyright rationale.</p>

<p>Based on the "common law" of misappropriation, though, Judge Loretta Preska of the United
States District Court in Manhattan granted an injunction against Motorola and STATS, Inc., ruling
that their nearly real-time dissemination of sports information constituted a misappropriation of the
NBA's and its licensees' commercial interests in their intellectual property.</p>

<center><img src = "animbar.gif" height = 7 width = 600></center>

<p>Appeal of this ruling by STATS, Inc. has sparked the interest of many.  In an attempt to overturn the
court's decision, not only America Online, but also such entities as The New York Times, and the
Associated Press have filed "friend of the court" briefs arguing that STATS, Inc. has the right to
produce, market, sell, and operate its SportsTrax pager without consent of the NBA.  Sports
organizations such as the National Football League, National Hockey League, and Major League
Baseball, as well as the media network NBC, align themselves with the NBA on this issue.</p>

<p>The lawsuit raises interesting questions about how the law should respond to this untested
technological invention.  Are the continuous updates provided by the SportsTrax pager and companion web site really a re-creation or broadcast of a sporting event or are they merely the relay of factual news information? 
What is the appropriate level of control given to the sports leagues in preventing unauthorized
broadcasting by third (nonpaying) parties of the factual information generated from their games? 
Surely the NBA cannot stop someone from telephoning a friend and telling him that the Knicks are up
by 6 with 2:40 to play in the fourth quarter!</p>

<p>The courts need to strike a balance between public and private interests.  While we like to think of "sports" as more than mere, paid entertainment, the truth remains that professional athletics are performances of highly paid performers.  Up-to-the-minute accounts of
games certainly increase fan interest and, indeed, one would think that sports leagues would be eager to
see their games on new media.  Instant sports information, however, is extremely valuable.  While rapidly transmitted numerical and shorthand written descriptions lack much of the "color" of verbal and pictorial play-by-play reports, they may be sufficiently close approximations that it can be fairly argued that companies like Motorola and STATS, Inc. should be willing to pay reasonable sums for it, otherwise it may be unfair to let them reap where they have not sown.</p>

<center><img src = "animbar.gif" height = 7 width = 600></center>

<p>In response to its critics, STATS, Inc. maintains that SportsTrax does not attempt to rebroadcast the
event--it is merely a relay of scores and other factual information.  It is unlikely that SportsTrax
competes with a live game or television or even radio broadcast.  No digital display can ever compare
to actually watching the players on the court "setting a pick" or "ripping down" an offensive rebound. 
But how does this apply to a sport like baseball, where a detailed on-line play-by-play description
would be very similar to what a radio broadcast could offer?</p>

<p>At least one thing is clear: we have seen only the beginning of this new technology.  With a touch of a
button (and a monthly fee), perhaps fans around the world will soon be able to watch still pictures and
film-clips, or listen to sound, almost as the action unfolds live.  In fact, during the 1996 U.S. Open tennis tournament, fans could access an Internet website that displayed a still photograph of a match in progress, updated every thirty seconds. Where does one draw the line between
conveying factual information and providing a "portable ticket to the game" that eliminates the
financial involvement of the sporting leagues or the contracted-for media broadcasts?</p>

<p>As computer and information technology changes the way we distribute and receive information in the
twenty-first century, our courts will further attempt to wrestle with the necessity to adjust our laws
accordingly.  With advocates on either side of the SportsTrax issue endeavoring to persuade the court
of appeals, perhaps an upcoming court decision on these important concerns will help to clarify many
of the legal issues regarding the newly-explored world of computer and information technology.</p>
