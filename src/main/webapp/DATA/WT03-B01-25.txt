9TH CIR. SAYS WORKER'S TRANSFER WAS REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION

     The Ninth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals on July 13 affirmed a
trial court's ruling which denied the U.S. Postal Service's motion
for summary judgment in a suit over its refusal to allow an HIV-
positive worker to transfer from Mississippi to California so he
could obtain better health care services  (Buckingham v. United
States of America et al., 9th Cir., No. 91-56236).

     (The opinion is available from Andrews Document Access
Service.  Call 1-800-345-1101 or 215-399-6600 from Pennsylvania.)

     Appellant Melvin Buckingham worked for several months in the
Columbus, MS, post office when in 1988 he applied for a transfer to
Los Angeles so that he could avail himself of better medical care
for persons with HIV conditions there.  Although his request was
granted by his Mississippi superiors, he discovered upon arriving
in California that the Los Angeles Post Office would not agree to
waive a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with its employees'
unions requiring one year of seniority before workers could seek a
transfer.

     Buckingham appealed the decision to the Equal Opportunity
Employment Commission (EEOC), where an administrative law judge
said the transfer was a reasonable accommodation under the
Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (the Act) and that the Postal Service's
one year seniority requirement conflicts with its obligations under
the act.  After the Postal Service rejected the ALJ's
recommendation, Buckingham filed suit in U.S. District Court for
California's Central District.

     U.S. District Court Judge Terry J. Hatter rejected the Postal
Service's arguments that transfers for medical treatment are not
required as a matter of law and that catering to Buckingham would
violate the rights of other employees who met seniority
requirements and were seeking transfers.  Ruling sua sponte, the
judge ordered that Buckingham be reinstated and awarded back pay.

     "Buckingham is not asking for a different job.  Nor is he
asking for a job that is not reasonably available under the Postal
Service's existing policies," said the Ninth Circuit in
affirmation.  "He is asking for the same job at a different
location.  It is not unreasonable under the Rehabilitation Act to
transfer Buckingham to a location where he can obtain better
medical treatment for his handicap."

     The panel's opinion by Senior U.S. Circuit Court Judge Warren
J. Ferguson said although qualified handicapped employees may be
able to perform the essential functions of their job, they are not
precluded from a reasonable accommodation to allow them to "(a)
enjoy the privileges and benefits of employment equal to those
enjoyed by non-handicapped employees or (b) pursue therapy or
treatment for their handicaps.  In other words, an employer is
obligated not to interfere, either through action or inaction, with
a handicapped employee's efforts to pursue a normal life."

     Although affirming the trial court's reasonable accommodation
ruling, the Ninth Circuit remanded the case to allow the government
to challenge the assumptions that Buckingham could get better
medical care in Los Angeles and that he was or would be able to
perform the essential functions of his job.  The panel said Judge
Hatter erred in issuing his sua sponte ruling without allowing the
Postal Service to present opposing arguments on factual disputes
"which must be resolved in Buckingham's favor in order for him to
prevail."  The Ninth Circuit said the government did not receive
sufficient notice of Judge Hatter's potential entrance of summary
judgment.

     Buckingham is represented by Stuart Herman of Herman & Wallach
in Los Angeles.  The Postal Service is represented by U.S. Justice
Department attorney John P. Schnitker of Washington, DC.

CA SUP. CT. DENIES REVIEW OF RULING IN FAVOR OF IRWIN

     The California Supreme Court, in a 4-3 decision issued
July 15, denied a request to review an appeals court ruling which
said Irwin Memorial Blood Bank (Irwin) met the industry's standard
of care by not using surrogate test procedures to screen blood in
November 1983  (Wilson v. Irwin Memorial Blood Bank, CA Sup. Ct.,
No. S032902).

     (The opposing briefs are available from Andrews Document
Access Service.  Call 1-800-345-1101 or 215-399-6600 from
Pennsylvania.)

     On appeal to the high court, attorneys for plaintiff Cynthia
Watson maintained that the courts below wrongly refused to judge
the actions of Irwin based on those of other blood banks in
"similar circumstances."  Judging the defendant on the basis of
actions by blood banks not confronted with the high level of risk
Irwin faced during that period, they claimed, was inappropriate.

     Watson's appeal brief, filed May 19, argued that the trial
court jury which decided against her was incorrectly told to
consider her claims based on a jury instruction designed only for
use in cases of misdiagnosis or improper treatment choice by a
medical professional.  It also asked the high court to decide if
the exclusion of certain testimony by dermatologist Marcus Conant,
M.D., and biostatistician Byron Brown, M.D., was appropriate simply
because neither was a "blood banker and was therefore not qualified
to testify as to the standard of care for blood banks."

     Watson maintained that the underlying decision by the state's
First District Court of Appeal was in conflict with other state
appellate decisions by declaring that the "standard of practice is
conclusive proof of the standard of care."  Watson said the
replacement of her "same or similar circumstances" standard of care
theory "with a weighing of what the majority of blood banks across
the nation were doing, results in a comparison of Irwin with blood
banks which were not at any risk of AIDS through their blood."

     Watson cited the Colorado Supreme Court's 1992 ruling in
United Blood Services v. Quintana, in which it said a trial court
erred in excluding the testimony of Dr. Conant on behalf of a
similarly situated plaintiff.  Said the Quintana court, "If the
standard adopted by a practicing profession were to be deemed
conclusive proof of due care, the profession itself would be
permitted to set the measure of its own legal liability, even
though that measure might be far below a level of care readily
attainable through the adoption of practices and procedures
substantially more effective in protecting others against harm than
self-decreed standards of the profession."

     Holding that the appellant offered no proof that it "failed to
do something that...other blood bankers would have done in similar
circumstances," Irwin argued against review of the appellate
ruling, saying it posed no conflict with other California courts.

      The partial exclusion of testimony from Dr. Conant "was not
based on the fact that Dr. Conant had not run a blood bank,"
responds Irwin, but due to the fact that "he was not shown to be
familiar with the standard of care for blood banks in November 1983
or at any other time."

     "While petitioner's outside experts opined that Irwin should
have been doing 'more' about AIDS and doing it sooner, there was no
evidence that at that time any blood bank except Stanford was, in
fact, doing what they testified 'should' have been done by Irwin,
and not even Stanford was running the T-cell test on all the blood
used there," replied Irwin on June 8.  "One blood bank is not a
'great minority' of blood banks as urged by the petitioner...it is
just one blood bank."

     Allowing "ad hoc judgments by lay jurors aided by hindsight"
in professional malpractice cases, argued Irwin, would "thwart"
California public policy and "elevate the standards required of
medical professionals beyond the reasonable expectations of the
profession to strict liability regardless of fault."

     Wilson is represented by Fred Meis and Sarah Jane Burgess of
Meis & Burgess in San Francisco.  Irwin is counseled by Charles
Bond, Heather McKee and Stephanie Gandolfi of Charles Bond &
Associates in Berkeley, CA, with James Dillon and Thomas Manning of
O'Connor, Cohn, Dillon & Barr in San Francisco.

NC JUDGE GRANTS AZT PATENT RIGHTS TO BURROUGHS WELLCOME

     A U.S. District Court Judge in New Bern, NC, on July 22
concluded a four-week trial over the patent rights to the AIDS drug
AZT by issuing a directed verdict on behalf of Burroughs Wellcome
Co., rejecting claims by two pharmaceutical firms who said they
should be allowed to sell their own versions of the drug because it
was developed under guidance of U.S. Government researchers
(Burroughs Wellcome Co. v. Barr Laboratories Inc., Burroughs
Wellcome Co. v. Novopharm Ltd., Burroughs Wellcome Co. v. Novopharm
Inc., ED NC, Nos. 91-41-CIV-4-H, 92-134-CIV-4-H, 92-156-CIV-4-H).

     Judge Malcom J. Howard's decision is expected to be appealed
to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit by defendants
Barr Laboratories Inc. and Novopharm Ltd., each of whom were sued
by North Carolina-based Burroughs Wellcome when they announced
plans to begin selling generic versions of the drug based on the
premise that Burroughs Wellcome was not AZT's rightful patent
holder.

     "The court has felt for some time that United States law, as
applied in this case, dictates that Burroughs Wellcome scientists
were the sole inventors of AZT," stated Judge Howard from the
bench.  Burroughs and Barr sought a ruling from the judge after
only a handful of the more than 200 witnesses were called.  Barr
sought the ruling so that it could appeal Judge Howard's definition
of inventorship without having to pursue the costly trial.

     The defendants maintain that former National Institutes of
Health physicians Samuel Broder and Hiroaki Mitsuya completed the
key research which later allowed Burroughs Wellcome to apply AZT,
known generically as zidovudine and sold by Burroughs Wellcome as
Retrovir, for use in the fight against AIDS.

     While patients using AZT pay some $2,000 annually for the
drug, the New York-based Barr and Canadian Novopharm say they would
sell the drug for a fraction of that amount.  Burroughs Wellcome
holds that its researchers developed the drug and that it is
entitled to maintain the patent, which runs through 2005.

     Burroughs Wellcome is represented by Thomas F. Curnin of
Cahill, Gordon & Reindel in New York City, and locally by Mark Ash
of Smith, Anderson, Blunt, Dorsett, Mitchell & Jurnigan in Raleigh,
NC.  Representing Barr are Dan Webb and local attorney John A.J.
Ward of New Bern.  Novapharm is represented by Robert Green of
Chicago and Rudy Ashton, also of New Bern.

IN APP. CT. AFFIRMS DISMISSAL OF HEALTH BENEFITS BIAS SUIT

     The Indiana Court of Appeals on July 6 unanimously affirmed a
trial court decision which said the state's Civil Rights Commission
(ICRC) erred in ruling an employer had violated state law by
cutting health benefits available to an AIDS victim because the
local law is preempted by federal statutes, which then did not
prohibit such discrimination (Westhoven v. Lincoln Foodservice
Products, Inc., IN Ct. of Apps., 2nd Dist., No. 35A02-9206-CV-260).

     (The opinion is available from Andrews Document Access
Service.  Call 1-800-345-1101 or 215-399-6600 from Pennsylvania.)

     An attorney for the estate of Kenneth Westhoven says no appeal
is planned in the case, noting that such a claim would now be
prohibited by the Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA), which was
not in effect when defendant Lincoln Foodservice Products reduced
the maximum benefits allowed for AIDS-related illnesses under its
self-funded employee insurance program.  Westhoven, an industrial
engineer, filed an ICRC action against the firm in 1990 based on
the changes it made to the plan in 1988 which capped lifetime
benefits for AIDS at $50,000, while other employees were provided
a $1 million limit.

     The commission found Lincoln to be in violation of Indiana's
Civil Rights Law (ICRL).  Lincoln appealed the decision to a state
trial court, which reversed the ruling on the grounds that the
state law is preempted by the Employee Retirement Income Security
Act (ERISA).

     "Pursuant to the ADA, and Indiana's companion legislation,
Lincoln is presently prohibited from discriminating upon the basis
of a handicap, i.e., against a 'qualified individual with a
disability,' in a wide range of employment practices," said the
appellate decision.  "At the time of the alleged discrimination,
however, Lincoln was not bound by the ADA.  This is true
notwithstanding the fact that the ICRL pre-dated parallel
provisions of federal law which now control."

     Because ERISA preempts the state's civil rights laws,
concluded the appeals court, "the Commission was without
jurisdiction to proceed upon Westhoven's complaint alleging
discrimination in the terms, conditions, and privileges of
employment."

     Lincoln is represented by Thomas Kimbrough and David Steiner
of Barrett & McNagny of Fort Wayne, IN.  The estate is represented
by Richard Swanson of Macey, Macey and Swanson in Indianapolis.

AL CT. SAYS BLOOD SHIELD LAW BARS PRODUCT-LIABILITY SUIT

     Ruling that the supply of blood coagulant is considered a
service and not the sale of a product in the state, an Alabama
circuit court on June 8 granted defense motions to dismiss product
liability-based claims filed against two pharmaceutical firms by a
man who says their factorate products infected him with the AIDS
virus (Watkins v. Armour Pharmaceutical Co. et al., AL Cir. Ct.,
Calhoun Cty., No. CV-92-452).

     (The order is available from Andrews Document Access Service.
Call 1-800-345-1101 or 215-399-6600 from Pennsylvania.)

     Plaintiff Richard D. Watkins, who now has AIDS, received blood
products manufactured by defendants Armour Pharmaceutical Co. and
Miles, Inc. while hospitalized at Northeast Alabama Regional
Medical Center in 1982, 1983, and 1984.  His suit charged the
pharmaceutical firms with strict liability in tort on the grounds
that the blood products they processed and provided him were
unreasonably dangerous and defective because they were contaminated
with the AIDS virus.

     The defendants suggested, and Circuit Court Judge Malcom B.
Street Jr. agreed, that such a suit is barred by Alabama's Blood
Shield Statute (Code Sec. 7-2-314[4]), which says that despite
remuneration to the provider, the supply of "human whole blood,
plasma, blood products, blood derivatives...is declared not to be
a sale...."

     Ruled the court, "this 'blood shield statute' clearly states
that the actions of defendants Armour, Miles and Northeast Alabama
Regional Medical Center in furnishing and distributing Factor VIII
blood products to the plaintiff were a service provided to the
plaintiff, Watkins.  The transaction of which the plaintiffs
complain is expressly declared by the statute 'not to be a sale',
thus, the plaintiff cannot maintain an action based on the theories
of express or implied warranties, or theories under the Alabama
Extended Manufacturer's Liability Doctrine."

     The judge also rejected the plaintiff's claim that the
products provided him were not blood derivatives, but instead
drugs, which are excluded from the application of the blood shield
law.  "The only source of Factor VIII is human blood," he wrote.
"The processing methods and the additions of additives does not
eliminate the core component of Factor VIII -- blood."

     Judge Street, however, allowed the plaintiff's accusations of
negligence against the defendants to remain "as viable claims for
the present."

     Miles is represented by Denise Dodson and James Gerwin of
Bradley, Arant, Rose & White in Birmingham, AL; Terry Tottenham and
John Beckwith of Fulbright and Jaworski in Austin, TX; and Geoffrey
R.W. Smith of McDermott, Will & Emery in Washington, DC.  John
Johnson of Lightfoot, Franklin, White & Lucas in Birmingham and
Douglas Fuson, Sara Gourley and Lory Barsdate of Sidley & Austin in
Chicago represent Armour.

     Watkins is represented by Karen Ross and Lloyd Gathings of
Gathings & Davis, and Robert Parsons of Parsons, Lee & Juliano.
All are located in Birmingham.

NY CT. SAYS PRIVACY IS NOT PROTECTED IN PUBLIC PROCEEDING

     A federal judge in Manhattan on June 14 dismissed a man's suit
which claimed his identity and HIV-positive status were revealed in
a New York City Commission on Human Rights press release that
detailed a settlement he reached in a bias suit against Delta Air
Lines (Doe v. The City of New York, the City of New York Commission
on Human Rights et al., SD NY, No. 92-CIV.-8044[TPG]).

     (The opinion is available from Andrews Document Access
Service.  Call 1-800-345-1101 or 215-399-6600 from Pennsylvania.)

     U.S. District Court Judge Thomas P. Griesa ruled against
plaintiff "John Doe" on the grounds that while the August 1992
conciliation agreement he reached with Delta may have barred the
disclosure of his identity, the negotiations which led to the
agreement were public record proceedings of the Commission.

     In early 1992, Doe filed a commission complaint against Delta,
claiming the company refused to hire him because of his sexual
orientation and because he was HIV-positive.  The agreement under
which he was hired by Delta with back pay was executed with the
assistance of the commission's Law Enforcement Bureau.  Although a
commission press release on the agreement did not mention Doe by
name, Doe says it included enough detail to allow his co-workers to
discover that he was the subject of the settlement.

     "Whatever right of confidentiality plaintiff had came from the
contract he entered into with Delta and the Commission, and stems
from the contract not the Constitution," wrote Judge Griesa, who
also dismissed state-based claims for lack of jurisdiction.
"Plaintiff's proceeding before the Commission and the resulting
conciliation agreement would have been a matter of public record
but for the non-disclosure provision of the agreement."

     The judge noted a "difference of view among the parties as to
the proper interpretation of the contract," and said "what needs to
be litigated here is the issue of contract interpretation."

     Doe is represented by Thomas J. Hall and Marla Hassner of
Chadbourne & Parke.  The defendant is represented by Assistant
Corporation Counsel Neil Corwin. All are located in New York City.

LA APP. CT. SAYS SUIT OVER '85 TRANSFUSION WAS FILED LATE

     The Louisiana Court of Appeals on June 16 rejected the
assertions of an HIV-positive woman who said her infection liabilty
suit against a hospital was based on strict liability, not medical
malpractice laws, and affirmed the dismissal of her suit as
untimely (In re: LeBlanc v. Meza, LA Ct. of App., 3rd Cir., No. 92-
1040).

     (The opinion is available from Andrews Document Access
Service.  Call 1-800-345-1101 or 215-399-6600 from Pennsylvania.)

     The panel, in a 3-2 decision, said it would not "carve an
exception" out of state law to accept Murley LeBlanc's strict
liability claim against Our Lady of Lourdes Regional Medical Center
for the "distribution of defective blood."  It also said that the
record did not support her claim that because the hospital and two
defendant physicians failed to tell her that she had received a
transfusion during a March 5, 1985, operation there, they acted to
delay her suit against them.

     The plaintiff, who was transfused 15 days before Lourdes
received a newly-released test for detecting HIV-tainted blood,
learned she was HIV-positive in August 1989.

     While the majority rejected LeBlanc's argument against the
constitutionality of the state's medical malpractice limitations
statute (La. R.S. 9 Sec. 5628), a dissenting justice said the rule
discriminates against plaintiffs unaware of an injury until after
the expiration of an applicable three year period.  "Malpractice
claims have long been recognized in this state," said the dissent.
"A cause of action for malpractice was vested and existed the
moment the first drop of tainted blood entered the plaintiff's
body.  The distinction is that it had not accrued prior to the
lapse of a three year period.  The statute does not operate as a
bar to a cause of action before it existed, but operated to limit
the cause of action.  Therefore, the LeBlancs had a cause of action
that was a vested property right."

     The majority noted that recent judicial rulings in the state
indicate that a Louisiana Supreme Court ruling on the legality of
Sec. 5628 "is imminent."   It said, however, that it would "await
a decision" and declined to declare the statute unconstitutional
"based on the statistical evidence presented by the LeBlancs."
Concluded the panel, "while it may be true that the statute
operates to discriminate against Mrs. LeBlanc and members of her
class, we cannot say that this discrimination overrides the state's
interest in limiting the time period for bringing medical
malpractice actions."

CONNECTICUT COURT DENIES DOCTOR'S MOTION FOR NONSUIT

     A Connecticut Superior Court Judge rejected on June 10 a
defendant physician's motion for nonsuit in an AIDS confidentiality
case pending an in camera review of the plaintiff's social services
files (Doe v. Marselle, CT Super. Ct., Jud. Dist. of Hartford/New
Britain, No. CV-92-0449141S).

     (The opinion is available from Andrews Document Access
Service.  Call 1-800-345-1101 or 215-399-6600 from Pennsylvania.)

     Judge Marshall K. Berger Jr. sealed the case file after
issuing his memorandum ordering plaintiff "Jane Doe" to present
notes from her social worker's file which she says are unrelated to
her claims against defendant Dionisio Flores, M.D.  The physician
requested the information as part of the discovery process in the
suit in which Doe accuses Flores of improperly releasing
confidential information on her HIV status.

     Dr. Flores moved for nonsuit in September 1992 after receiving
redacted versions of the documents in question.  While Doe
maintains the files on her conversations with the social worker are
not related to the claims asserted in the suit, the physician
insists they are directly tied to Doe's accusations that the
disclosure of her HIV status caused damage to her reputation,
severe mental distress and physical manifestations of that
distress.

     Judge Berger ordered that the documents be presented for his
review, noting that their disclosure could be allowed under state
law in cases in which a plaintiff "introduces his mental condition
as an element of his claim or defense."  Concluded the court, "if,
as the plaintiff asserts, the redacted portions of the notes are
unrelated to the injuries in the complaint, the interests of
justice may not require disclosure."

     Dr. Flores is represented by Anna M. Carbonaro of O'Keefe,
Dunn & Jackson of Hartford, CT.  Co-defendant Doris Marselle is
counseled by Jim Hayes of Hanrahan, Grabowski & Hayes in Bristol,
CT.  Susan Garten of the Legal Aid Society of Hartford and West

SETTLEMENT ENDS HIV BIAS SUIT AGAINST CA DENTAL CHAIN

     The Los Angeles City Attorney's office and a chain of area
dental clinics on June 16 announced the settlement of a California
Superior Court suit which accused the firm of discriminatorily
denying dental treatment to persons with HIV or AIDS-related
illnesses (The People of the State of California v. Western Dental
Services, Inc. CA Super. Ct., Los Angeles Cty., No. BC050051).

     (The settlement agreement is available from Andrews Document
Access Service.  Call 1-800-345-1101 or 215-399-6600 from
Pennsylvania.)

     Without admitting that it committed acts of discrimination,
defendant Western Dental Services, Inc., operator of several
clinics in the Los Angeles area, agreed to the dismissal of the
suit against it in return for its implementation of an ongoing
training program on AIDS-related issues for its professional and
staff employees.

               Under the agreement, Western reaffirms its written employment
policies which "reflect its commitment to provide dental care
services to HIV-positive and AIDS patients on a non-discriminatory
basis."  Western will update its patient information materials
reflecting its non-discrimination policies and make them available
to the public in both English and Spanish.

     The settlement, approved by Superior Court Judge Victor E.
Chavez, calls for the court to monitor Western's performance for
three years and contains provisions for reporting violations of its
terms and conditions.

     The suit was originally filed in March 1992 by several civil
rights organizations on behalf of four HIV-positive men who said
they were denied further treatment by Western after revealing their
medical status.  Kathleen M. Wohn, an attorney for the original
plaintiffs, says the portion of the settlement applying to them
remains confidential."

     The state is represented by Los Angeles City Attorney James
Hahn, and Deputy City Attorneys David Schulman and Henry Burr.
Richard Goodman, Julie Porter and John Cannon of Stradling, Yocca,
Carlson & Rauth represent Western, while co-defendant Grace Cho,

NY FUNERAL HOME TOLD TO PAY $60,000 TO SETTLE BIAS CASE

     A New York Division of Human Rights commissioner on June 9
ordered a New Windson, NY, funeral director to pay $20,000 in
compensatory damages to each of three siblings of an AIDS victim
who were convinced not to follow their brother's wish to have an
open casket service based on the funeral director's claim that the
body would pose a health threat to them and their visitors
(Agresti v. Coloni Funeral Home, Inc. et al., NY Div. of Human
Rights, Nos. 9K-P-D-89-134721, 9K-P-D-89-134723, 9K-P-D-89-134793).

     (The ruling is available from Andrews Document Access Service.
Call 1-800-345-1101 or 215-399-6600 from Pennsylvania.)

     Commissioner Margarita Rosa found that Richard Coloni,
operator of the Coloni Funeral Home, violated New York State Human
Rights Law in April 1989 when he persuaded complainants Frank
Agresti, Greg Agresti, and Ramilda Newell not to follow decedent
Alfred Agresti's instructions that he be embalmed and viewed in an
open casket.  The record indicates that Coloni told the family that
one "could catch the AIDS virus from a deceased person much like
one could catch the common cold."

     Frank Agresti, who flew from California for his brother's
burial, was allowed to view the body only after agreeing to
Coloni's condition that he wear a mask.  Complainant Greg Agresti's
wife never viewed the body upon Coloni's insistence that such
exposure could cause her harm since she was then pregnant.

     Ruling that the funeral home violated state public
accommodation laws, Commissioner Rosa said the "complainants gave
up their desire to have an open casket as a result of respondent
Richard Coloni's underlying attitude, explanations and
misrepresentations, which exhibited prejudice towards HIV
'infected' clients."  She awarded compensatory damages based on
each sibling's mental anguish, frustration and public humiliation,
suffered, she said, as the result of Coloni's "unlawful
discrimination."

CA CT. AFFIRMS ENHANCED SENTENCE FOR HIV SEX CRIME

     A California appellate court on June 1 affirmed a trial
court's 'enhancement' of a sexual offender's 72-year prison
sentence based on aggravating circumstances, including his claim
that he knew he was HIV-positive before committing his crime
(People v. Shoemake,  CA Ct. of Apps., 5th Dist., No. F017527).

     (The opinion is available from Andrews Document Access
Service.  Call 1-800-345-1101 or 215-399-6600 from Pennsylvania.)

     Appellant Samuel Lee Shoemake opposed the handling of his Kern
County Superior Court case on a number of issues, claiming Judge
Gerald K. Davis violated the principle of corpus delicti because
prosecutors failed to independently prove that Shoemake was HIV-
positive prior to his July 1991 rape of a woman.  He said the case
against him and later the enhancement of his sentence were
insufficiently based solely on his own statements that he was HIV-
positive.

     The appeals court ruled that the corpus delicti claim did not
apply to such charges.  It said that the "proof utilized by the
state is the words of the defendant" and that "no constitutional or
statutory principle diminishes their force as evidence of the
truth."  The appeals court also rejected Shoemake's accompanying
claim that Judge Davis erred by allowing the removal of the only
African-American juror under the prosecution's exercise of a
peremptory challenge.

     The panel said much of Shoemake's appeal was void because he
failed to exercise a multiple hearsay objection at the trial level
on his claim that the AIDS-related allegations against him lacked
proof.  "For the first time on appeal, appellant challenges the
introduction of his statements, made prior to the commission of the
present offenses, that he had AIDS or was the carrier of HIV," said
the three-member appeals court in Fresno, CA.  "While he has
phrased his arguments avoiding the issue of waiver, the fact
remains that the position he advances on appeal comes down to
whether the statements were improperly admitted into evidence.  We
need not decide this question because appellant did not preserve
the issue for appeal by a timely and specific objection in the
trial court."

     The appeals court said the evidence presented before Judge
Davis was "legally sufficient" to support the enhancement of his
sentence.  His statements to two persons acknowledging that he
either had AIDS or was HIV positive, concluded the panel, "were
admitted into evidence without objection or limitation.  No
evidence was presented in rebuttal."

     Shoemake is represented by attorney Kyle Gee, who was
appointed by the appeals court.  The state is represented by state
attorneys Robert R. Anderson, Margaret Venturi and Mary Jane
Hamilton.

CCBC'S BRIEF IN BLOOD TEST DISPUTE WAS FILED NEUTRALLY

     The Council of Community Blood Banks' (CCBC) May 19 amicus
brief opposing a preliminary injunction to delay implementation of
a contract for its receipt of blood test kits, was filed neutrally
and did not support either of the two pharmaceutical firms
disputing the control of the market for such kits (Ortho Diagnostic
Systems v. Abbott Laboratories, SD NY, No. 93 CIV.2656-LBS).

     (The petition is available from Andrews Document Access
Service.  Call 1-800-345-1101 or 215-399-6600 from Pennsylvania.)

     Although the summary of the case in the most recent AIDS LR
correctly reported that CCBC opposed the injunction, it did not
indicate that the brief was submitted without comment on the merits
of either party's position.  In the brief, CCBC told U.S. District
Court Judge Leonard B. Sand that granting Ortho Disgnostic System's
(Ortho) request to halt the agreement between CCBC and Abbott
Laboratories would impose hardships on CCBC's member blood banks
and the general public.

     CCBC said a preliminary injunction would raise "uncertainties
that may have adverse consequences to recipients of blood
transfusions," because of confusion it would cause at blood banks
which have already switched from one blood test technology to
another.  "Every time a new test -- especially one with a new or
different technology -- is introduced into a blood center, standard
operating procedures must be written, equipment and reagents must
be ordered, technicians must be trained, software must be developed
and the entire complex system must be integrated and validated.
Each of these steps takes significant time and resources to assure
an error-free transition."

     Emphasizing that the amicus brief was filed only on behalf of
"CCBC, its members and the patients they serve," CCBC Executive
Director James MacPherson says his organization remains "absolutely
neutral with respect to Ortho's claims against Abbott and Abbott's
defense against those claims."

     The case is scheduled to go to trial on November 15.

     CCBC is represented by Steven Labensky and Karen Owens of
Lewis and Roca in Phoenix.  Ortho is counseled by Robert Heller,
Harold Weinberger and Michael Oberman of Kramer, Levin, Naftalis,
Nessen, Kamin & Frankel of New York City.  Jeffrey Weinberger,
Steven Perry and Glenn Pomerantz of Munger, Tolles & Olsen in Los
Angeles represents Abbott.
