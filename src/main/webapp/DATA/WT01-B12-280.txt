<P>
The President has confirmed that the U.S. Treasury will begin
to issue inflation adjusted bonds in January of 1997.  The introduction
of the index linked bond represents a potentially important development
both for the future structure of the public debt as well as the
yield benchmarks which will be used to measure investment performance
in the fund management industry.  Investors have long used government
securities as a proxy for risk free returns in the financial markets.
 The introduction of the index linked bonds will now offer a proxy
for measuring inflation adjusted risk free return.
<P>
The U.S. will be the seventh OECD country to introduce index linked
government debt.  It already exists in Britain, Sweden, Canada,
Australia, New Zealand and Iceland.  Some Latin American nations
also have offered inflation adjusted securities in the past but
they were designed to help their populations cope with hyper-inflation,
not moderate G-7 style inflation.  The British government introduced
the first G-7 index linked bonds in August 1981 and the initial
security offered a real yield of only 2.0% plus a tax free principal
adjustment for inflation.  At first, the securities were offered
only to pension funds but the rules were later modified to permit
purchases by individuals.
<P>
When the UK government introduced its first index linked bond,
many institutional investors responded positively because of their
disastrous experience with inflation during the 1970's.  In the
mid-1970's, conventional British government bonds had lost over
half of their value in nominal terms because Britain's inflation
rate had shot up to 30%.   In 1981, investors also had more modest
expectations of potential returns from securities than exist today.
 Between 1750 and 1950, the average yield on UK government securities
had been about 3.0% with an all time low of 2.21% in 1897.  The
British government's credit standing was so high that it was even
able to finance the First World War by selling bonds with a coupon
yield of 5.0%.   While commodity prices had fluctuated in a wide
range because of wars and changes in the global economy, the overall
British price level had been remarkably stable for nearly two
hundred years.  As a result, many pension funds perceived that
a government security which offered  a guaranteed real return
of 2.0% was an attractive asset.  High income individuals also
were attracted to the prospect of a bond principal inflation adjustment
which was free of income tax.  As a result of this investor support,
the UK government was able to sell over 6 billion pounds of index
linked debt during the first two years after their introduction
compared to a conventional debt stock of 150 billion pounds.
<P>
Between 1981 and 1995, the UK government's index linked securities
produced a cumulative nominal return of 154% and a cumulative
real yield of 40%.  But as the UK economy entered a period of
sustained disinflation after 1980, the return on index linked
securities significantly underperformed other asset classes, such
as equities and conventional government bonds.  Between 1981 and
1995, the UK stock market rose 5.7 times in nominal terms and
by nearly 3 times in real terms.  The price of conventional government
bonds rose by 72% while the real yield on long-term government
securities averaged 3.7%.  The real yield on Treasury bills also
averaged about 5.3% during the period 1981-1995 compared to 2.9%
on the index linked security.  <I>But while the index linked security
did not out perform conventional financial assets, it did produce
a better return than other traditional inflation hedges such as
gold and property.</I>  The British property market boomed during
the mid-1980's because of easy monetary policy but it slumped
so sharply during the early 1990's that index linked securities have out performed 
property for the period since they were introduced.  The nominal
yield on British property has averaged just under 9.0% since 1981
compared to an average nominal yield of 10% on the index linked
bonds.  The gold price peaked at $800 per ounce in 1980 and currently
sells for about $380 per ounce.
<P>
As a result of Britain's greatly improved inflation performance
under Mrs. Thatcher, the market for index linked securities never
developed  the breadth and liquidity of other asset markets. 
But the British government has been attempting to improve the market's liquidity
by doing about 15% of its recent funding in the index linked securities.
 As a result, the stock of index linked debt has expanded to 40
billion pounds compared to a net government debt stock of 260
billion pounds.
<P>
The introduction of index linked debt has produced major interest
cost savings for the British government.  The nominal yield on
index linked debt has averaged about 100-200 basis points below
the yields on other government securities.  The only cost to the
government has been the lost tax receipts from the inflation adjustment
for the depreciating real value of  bond principal.  But the savings
from reduced interest payments have been immediate while the tax
losses from indexation will be felt over the long term.  Before
the index linked bond  was introduced, the UK government had collected
tax on all interest income but it had exempted bonds from capital
gains taxation if they were held for longer than one year.
