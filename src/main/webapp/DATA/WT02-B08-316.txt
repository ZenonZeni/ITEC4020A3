This image shows the global distribution of wind speed as observed by 
TOPEX/POSEIDON's dual-frequency radar altimeter from October 3 to October 
12, 1992. Wind speed is determined by the strength of the return radar 
pulses. A calm sea serves as a good reflector and returns a strong pulse; 
on the other hand, a rough sea tends to scatter the radar signal and 
returns a weak pulse. In this image, the strongest winds (over 15 meters 
per second or 54 kilometers per hour) are found in the Southern Ocean and 
are indicated by white. The highest waves are also located in this 
region; see the wave height image. In general, there is a high degree of 
correlation between wind speed and wave height. The weakest winds 
(represented by magenta and dark blue) are found in the western tropical 
Pacific Ocean, the tropical Atlantic Ocean and the tropical Indian Ocean. 
A few bands of these so-called trade winds are also noticeable in the 
subtropical regions.

Global wave height data acquired by TOPEX/POSEIDON's dual-frequency radar 
altimeter from October 3 to October 12, 1992, were used to create this
image. Wave height is determined by the shape of the return radar pulse. 
A calm sea with low waves returns a condensed pulse whereas a rough sea 
with high waves returns a stretched pulse. In this image, the highest 
waves occur in the Southern Ocean, where waves over 6 meters in height 
(represented by white) are found. The strongest winds are also found in 
this region; see the wind speed image. The lowest waves (indicated by 
dark blue) are found primarily in the tropical and subtropical oceans 
where the wind speed is also the lowest. In general, there is a high 
degree of correlation between wind speed and wave height. Simultaneous 
observations of wind speed and wave height by TOPEX/POSEIDON will help 
improve our ability to forecast ocean waves.

<H3>The TOPEX/POSEIDON Global Ocean-Monitoring Mission </H3><P>
</CENTER>
A joint effort between the National Aeronautics and Space Administration 
(NASA) and the French space agency (Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales - 
CNES) to study Earth's oceans, the TOPEX/POSEIDON mission will observe 
the global ocean circulation for three to five years. The oceans play a 
fundamental role in maintaining the current habitable climate on Earth by 
transporting an enormous amount of heat through their large-scale 
circulation systems. Understanding the dynamics of ocean circulation and
the role this circulation plays in climate change is the main goal of the 
TOPEX/POSEIDON mission. TOPEX/POSEIDON will measure sea levels; map 
basin-wide variations in currents, and monitor the effects of currents, 
such as the Gulf Stream, on global climate change. Additionally, the 
mission's measurements will allow scientists to study ocean tides and 
waves, marine geophysics and wind.<P>
The TOPEX/POSEIDON satellite travels in a 66-degree inclined orbit around 
Earth at an altitude of 1,366 kilometers. This orbit allows coverage of 
95 percent of the ice-free oceans every 10 days. The satellite's position 
is known to within 10 centimeters from Earth's center, an unprecedented 
accuracy that will enable the satellite's radar altimeters to make 
precise measurements in sea heights. TOPEX/POSEIDON carries six sensors: 
NASA supplied the dual-frequency altimeter, the laser retroreflector 
array, the TOPEX microwave radiometer and the experimental Global 
Positioning System (GPS) demonstration receiver; CNES supplies the 
single-frequency, solid-state altimeter and the DORIS (Determination of 
Orbit Radiopositioning Integrated from Satellite) dual-Doppler tracking 
system receiver.
