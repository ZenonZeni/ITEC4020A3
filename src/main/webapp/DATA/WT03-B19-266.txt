There is a strong community commitment in Colac and the surrounding
district to create a high quality business environment that develops
new jobs, fosters innovation in technology and diversifies the
economic base.
<P>
The wealth of Colac and District is based on primary production,
particularly beef cattle and timber.  Colac offers opportunities
for further timber processing, dairying, tourism and expansion
of its health facilities.
<P>
The north and south of Colac and District form two distinct areas.
 The towns of Camperdown and Winchelsea, volcanic plains and extensive
wetlands are located in the north, and to the south lie the magnificent
Otway Ranges and the coast, with the resort and fishing towns
of Lorne and Apollo Bay.
</FONT>
<H2>Land and high quality water are primary sources of wealth</H2>
<P>
The region's economy is centred on agricultural produce and timber
resources. The fertile soils, reliable rainfall and temperate
climate allow local producers to grow organic vegetables, potatoes,
onions and oilseeds.
<P>
There is also extensive cattle and sheep grazing, and goats and deer are
being farmed in the Otways.
The dairy industry is a large employer, and annual milk production is 600
million litres.
Production of sheep milk is under way in the Camperdown district.

employer, and annual milk production is 600 million litres. Production
of sheep milk is under way in the Camperdown district.
<P>
Dairy manufacturing in Colac is dominated by Bonlac Foods and
Regal Cream Products.  Bonlac employs 600 people, and is Australia's
largest exporter of packaged butter, cheese and whole milk powder.
 Smaller local dairy manufacturers produce cheese, cream and ice-cream.
<P>
The meat industry is important to the Colac District, and it produces
beef, venison, lamb and pork.  Colac is the site of the Western
District Meat Packing Company, a large abattoir processing 23,500
cattle, 110,000 calves, 262,000 sheep/lambs and 26,000 pigs annually.
<H2>Adding value is the key</H2>
<P>
The Otway Ranges are an important timher and recreation resource
for the whole of Victoria.  The timber industry employs large
numbers in harvesting and processing both hardwood and softwood
products.  The emphasis of the timber industry is increasingly
on value adding.
<P>
<img src="gifs2/colbush.gif" align=right
Industry and Government have been managing the forest estate,
and with cooperation and foresight, have secured a long term future
for the timber industry.  Companies in the value added wood processing
sectors have been provided with a reliable supply of timber resources.
<P>
In addition to the supply of locally grown timber, substantial
and increasing supplies of timbers harvested from outside the
districts surrounding Colac are processed within Colac.
<P>
Colac and District has significant timber milling operations,
including kiln drying facilities at Associated Kiln Driers and
timber preservation treatment facilities at Shelton Timber Treatment.
<P>
Opportunities exist for natural fibre processing using wool, linseed
and cereal straw.
<H2>Speciality fishing</H2>
<P>
Eels are produced by three establishments in the fertile wetlands
around Lake Colac.  All of the eel production from the area is
exported to Europe and Hong Kong.  Apollo Bay has significant
fishing operations, particularly abalone fishing.
<H2>Advantages in location</H2>
<P>
As the largest centre in the district, Colac is the service centre.
Its population of over 14,000 lives on the shores of a freshwater
lake at the foothills of the Otway Ranges.
<P>
The city has good access to Melbourne and Adelaide markets via
the Princes Highway, and is only 138 kilometres south west of
Melbourne.
<P>
Health and welfare needs are well cateredfor by the Colac and
District Hospital and Colanda Community Services Centre.  A major
expansion of the Colanda mental health facility is being considered.
<H2>Water quality and quantity</H2>
<P>
Colac's sewerage and waste disposal system is one of the best
collection and treatment systems in Victoria.  All
aspects of treatment, be it volumetric, biological or solid load
are catered for, and excess capacity is available for new industries.
<P>
The region has a plentiful supply of extremely high quality water,
and has Victoria's highest rainfall.
The existing infrastructure is expected to meet the water supply 
demands until the year 2030.
<P>
Beyond the year 2030, it is estimated that only relatively minor
capital works would be required to provide substantial additional
water supply capacity to industrial and residential users in the
district.
<H2>Natural beauty is a major attraction</H2>
<P>
Colac is the gateway to the Otway Ranges and the western plains,
which offer marvellous recreation and tourist facilities.  A number
of National Parks, as well as State and Regional Parks and reserves
boast spectacular waterfalls and mountain streams, rugged coastline,
magnificent beaches and internationally significant wetlands.
<P>
Colac and District has been an important tourism area since Lorne
developed as a holiday destination late in the nineteenth century.
The Cumberland Resort development at Lorne ensures that
the town retains its important position in tourism.
<P>
The spectacular Great Ocean Road has a world-wide reputation,
evidenced by the hundreds of thousands of Australian and international
visitors who are attracted there each year.
<P>
There is still unrealised tourism potential in the area, with
a host of summer activities on the coast and the year around splendour
of the pristine forests, walks, camping, fishing and picnicking.
<H2>Local support for local industry</H2>
<P>
The Colac Economic Development Committee's role is to stimulate the
expansion and progress of the area.
Services provided by the committee include a database on land
and office space location, local and regional economic and demographic
data, an extensive network of information on business and finance,
and assistance with feasibility and market research data.
