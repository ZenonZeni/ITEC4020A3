<h3>4. Use of LSD in Psychiatry </h3>
</center>

<hr>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Soon after LSD was tried on animals, the first
systematic investigation of the substance was carried out on
human beings, at the psychiatric clinic of the University of
Zurich. Werner A. Stoll, M.D. (a son of Professor Arthur Stoll),
who led this research, published his results in 1947 in the <i>Schweizer
Archiv fur Neurologie und Psychiatrie,</i> under the title
&quot;Lysergsäure-diathylämid, ein Phantastikum aus der
Mutterkorngruppe&quot; [Lysergic acid diethylamide, a
phantasticum from the ergot group]. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The tests involved healthy research subjects as
well as schizophrenic patients. The dosages&#151;substantially
lower than in my first self-experiment with 0.25 mg LSD
tartrate&#151;amounted to only 0.02 to 0.13 mg. The emotional
state during the LSD inebriation was here predominantly euphoric,
whereas in my experiment the mood was marked by grave side
effects resulting from overdosage and, of course, fear of the
uncertain outcome. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; This fundamental publication, which gave a
scientific description of all the basic features of LSD
inebriation, classified the new active principle as a
phantasticum. However, the question of <i>therapeutic application</i>
of LSD remained unanswered. On the other hand, the report
emphasized the extraordinarily high activity of LSD, which
corresponds to the activity of trace substances occurring in the
organism that are considered to be responsible for certain mental
disorders. Another subject discussed in this first publication
was the possible application of LSD as a research tool in
psychiatry, which follows from its tremendous psychic activity.</p>

<p>&nbsp; </p>

<h4>First Self-Experiment by a Psychiatrist </h4>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; In his paper, W. A. Stoll also gave a detailed
description of his own personal experiment with LSD. Since this
was the first self-experiment published by a psychiatrist, and
since it describes many characteristic features of LSD
inebriation, it is interesting to quote extensively from the
report. I warmly thank the author for kind permission to
republish this extract. </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>At 8 o'clock I took 60 mcg (0.06 milligrams) of LSD. Some
    20 minutes later, the first symptoms appeared: heaviness in
    the limbs, slight atactic (i.e., confused, uncoordinated)
    symptoms. A subjectively very unpleasant phase of general
    malaise followed, in parallel with the drop in blood pressure
    registered by the examiners. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; A certain euphoria then set in, though it
    seemed weaker to me than experiences in an earlier
    experiment. The ataxia increased, and I went
    &quot;sailing&quot; around the room with large strides. I
    felt somewhat better, but was glad to lie down. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; Afterward the room was darkened (dark
    experiment); there followed an unprecedented experience of
    unimaginable intensity that kept increasing in strength. It w
    as characterized by an unbelievable profusion of optical
    hallucinations that appeared and vanished with great speed,
    to make way for countless new images. I saw a profusion of
    circles, vortices, sparks, showers, crosses, and spirals in
    constant, racing flux. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; The images appeared to stream in on me
    predominantly from the center of the visual field, or out of
    the lower left edge. When a picture appeared in the middle,
    the remaining field of vision was simultaneously filled up
    with a vast number of similar visions. All were colored:
    bright, luminous red, yellow, and green predominated. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; I never managed to linger on any picture. When
    the supervisor of the experiment emphasized my great
    fantasies, the richness of my statements, I could only react
    with a sympathetic smile. I knew, in fact, that I could not
    retain, much less describe, more than a fraction of the
    pictures. I had to force myself to give a description. Terms
    such as &quot;fireworks&quot; or &quot;kaleidoscopic&quot;
    were poor and inadequate. I felt that I had to immerse myself
    more and more deeply into this strange and fascinating world,
    in order to allow the exuberance, the unimaginable wealth, to
    work on me. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; At first, the hallucinations were elementary:
    rays, bundles of rays, rain, rings, vortices, loops, sprays,
    clouds, etc. Then more highly organized visions also
    appeared: arches, rows of arches, a sea of roofs, desert
    landscapes, terraces, flickering fire, starry skies of
    unbelievable splendor. The original, more simple images
    continued in the midst of these more highly organized
    hallucinations. I remember the following images in
    particular: <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; A succession of towering, Gothic vaults, an
    endless choir, of which I could not see the lower portions. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; A landscape of skyscrapers, reminiscent of
    pictures of the entrance to New York harbor: house towers
    staggered behind and beside one another with innumerable rows
    of windows. Again the foundation was missing. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; A system of masts and ropes, which reminded me
    of a reproduction of a painting seen the previous day (the
    inside of a circus tent). <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; An evening sky of an unimaginable pale blue
    over the dark roofs of a Spanish city. I had a peculiar
    feeling of anticipation, was full of joy and decidedly ready
    for adventure. All at once the stars flared up, amassed, and
    turned to a dense rain of stars and sparks that streamed
    toward me. City and sky had disappeared. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; I was in a garden, saw brilliant red, yellow,
    and green lights falling through a dark trelliswork, an
    indescribably joyous experience. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; It was significant that all the images
    consisted of countless repetitions of the same elements: many
    sparks, many circles, many arches, many windows, many fires,
    etc. I never saw isolated images, but always duplications of
    the same image, endlessly repeated. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; I felt myself one with all romanticists and
    dreamers, thought of E. T. A. Hoffmann, saw the maelstrom of
    Poe (even though, at the time I had read Poe, his description
    seemed exaggerated). Often I seemed to stand at the pinnacle
    of artistic experience; I luxuriated in the colors of the
    altar of Isenheim, and knew the euphoria and exultation of an
    artistic vision. I must also have spoken again and again of
    modern art; I thought of abstract pictures, which all at once
    I seemed to understand. Then again, there were impressions of
    an extreme trashiness, both in their shapes and their color
    combinations. The most garish, cheap modern lamp ornaments
    and sofa pillows came into my mind. The train of thought was
    quickened. But I had the feeling the supervisor of the
    experiment could still keep up with me. Of course I knew,
    intellectually, that I was rushing him. At first I had
    descriptions rapidly at hand. With the increasingly frenzied
    pace, it became impossible to think a thought through to the
    end. I must have only started many sentences. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; When I tried to restrict myself to specific
    subjects, the experiment proved most unsuccessful. My mind
    would even focus, in a certain sense, on contrary images:
    skyscrapers instead of a church, a broad desert instead of a
    mountain. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; I assumed that I had accurately estimated the
    elapsed time, but did not take the matter very seriously.
    Such questions did not interest me in the slightest. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; My state of mind was consciously euphoric. I
    enjoyed the condition, was serene, and took a most active
    interest in the experience. From time to time I opened my
    eyes. The weak red light seemed mysterious, much more than
    before. The busily writing research supervisor appeared to me
    to be very far away. Often I had peculiar bodily sensations:
    I believed my hands to be attached to some distant body, but
    was not certain whether it was my own. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; After termination of the first dark experiment,
    I strolled about in the room a bit, was unsure on my legs,
    and again felt less well. I became cold and was thankful that
    the research supervisor covered me with a blanket. I felt
    unkempt, unshaven, and unwashed. The room seemed strange and
    broad. Later I squatted on a high stool, thinking all the
    while that I sat there like a bird on the roost. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; The supervisor emphasized my own wretched
    appearance. He seemed remarkably graceful. I myself had
    small, finely formed hands. As I washed them, it was
    happening a long way from me, somewhere down below on the
    right. It was questionable, but utterly unimportant, whether
    they were my own hands. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; In the landscape outside, well known to me,
    many things appeared to have changed. Besides the
    hallucinations, I could now see the real as well. Later this
    was no longer possible, although I remained aware that
    reality was otherwise. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; A barracks, and the garage standing before it
    to the left, suddenly changed to a landscape of ruins,
    shattered to pieces. I saw wall wreckage and projecting
    beams, inspired undoubtedly by the memory of the war events
    in this region. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; In a uniform, extensive field, I kept seeing
    figures, which I tried to draw, but could get no farther than
    the crudest beginnings. I saw an extremely opulent sculptural
    ornamentation in constant metamorphosis, in continuous flux.
    I was reminded of every possible foreign culture, saw
    Mexican, Indian motifs. Between a grating of small beams and
    tendrils appeared little caricatures, idols, masks, strangely
    mixed all of a sudden with childish drawings of people. The
    tempo was slackened compared to the dark experiment. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; The euphoria had now vanished. I became
    depressed, especially during the second dark experiment,
    which followed. Whereas during the first dark experiment, the
    hallucinations had alternated with great rapidity in bright
    and luminous colors, now blue, violet, and dark green
    prevailed. The movement of larger images was slower milder,
    quieter, although even these were composed of finely raining
    &quot;elemental dots,&quot; which streamed and whirled about
    quickly. During the first dark experiment, the commotion had
    frequently intruded upon me; now it often led distinctly away
    from me into the center of the picture, where a sucking mouth
    appeared. I saw grottoes with fantastic erosions and
    stalactites, reminding me of the child's book <i>Im
    Wunderreiche des Bergkonigs </i>[In the wondrous realm of the
    mountain king]. Serene systems of arches rose up. On the
    right-hand side, a row of shed roofs suddenly appeared; I
    thought of an evening ride homeward during military service.
    Significantly it involved a homeward ride: there was no
    longer anything like departure or love of adventure. I felt
    protected, enveloped by motherliness, was in peace. The
    hallucinations were no longer exciting, but instead mild and
    attenuated. Somewhat later I had the feeling of possessing
    the same motherly strength. I perceived an inclination, a
    desire to help, and behaved then in an exaggeratedly
    sentimental and trashy manner, where medical ethics are
    concerned. I realized this and was able to stop. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; But the depressed state of mind remained. I
    tried again and again to see bright and joyful images. But to
    no avail; only dark blue and green patterns emerged. I longed
    to imagine bright fire as in the first dark experiment. And I
    did see fires; however, they were sacrificial fires on the
    gloomy battlement of a citadel on a remote, autumnal heath.
    Once I managed to behold a bright ascending multitude of
    sparks, but at half-altitude it transformed itself into a
    group of silently moving spots from a peacock's tail. During
    the experiment I was very impressed that my state of mind and
    the type of hallucinations harmonized so consistently and
    uninterruptedly. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; During the second dark experiment I observed
    that random noises, and also noises intentionally produced by
    the supervisor of the experiment, provoked simultaneous
    changes in the optical impressions (synesthesia). In the same
    manner, pressure on the eyeball produced alterations of
    visual perceptions. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; Toward the end of the second dark experiment, I
    began to watch for sexual fantasies, which were, however,
    totally absent. In no way could I experience sexual desire. I
    wanted to imagine a picture of a woman; only a crude
    modern-primitive sculpture appeared. It seemed completely
    unerotic, and its forms were immediately replaced by agitated
    circles and loops. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; After the second dark experiment I felt
    benumbed and physically unwell. I perspired, was exhausted. I
    was thankful not to have to go to the cafeteria for lunch.
    The laboratory assistant who brought us the food appeared to
    me small and distant, of the same remarkable daintiness as
    the supervisor of the experiment. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; Sometime around 3:00 P.M. I felt better, so
    that the supervisor could pursue his work. With some effort I
    managed to take notes myself. I sat at the table, wanted to
    read, but could not concentrate. Once I seemed to myself like
    a shape from a surrealistic picture, whose limbs were not
    connected with the body, but were rather painted somewhere
    close by.... <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; I was depressed and thought with interest of
    the possibility of suicide. With some terror I apprehended
    that such thoughts were remarkably familiar to me. It seemed
    singularly self-evident that a depressed person commits
    suicide.... <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; On the way home and in the evening I was again
    euphoric, brimming with the experiences of the morning. I had
    experienced unexpected, impressive things. It seemed to me
    that a great epoch of my life had been crowded into a few
    hours. I was tempted to repeat the experiment. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; The next day I was careless in my thinking and
    conduct, had great trouble concentrating, was apathetic. . .
    . The casual, slightly dream-like condition persisted into
    the afternoon. I had great trouble reporting in any organized
    way on a simple problem. I felt a growing general weariness,
    an increasing awareness that I had now returned to everyday
    reality. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; The second day after the experiment brought an
    irresolute state.... Mild, but distinct depression was
    experienced during the following week, a feeling which of
    course could be related only indirectly to LSD. </p>

<h4>The Psychic Effects of LSD </h4>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The picture of the activity of LSD obtained from
these first investigations was not new to science. It largely
matched the commonly held view of mescaline, an alkaloid that had
been investigated as early as the turn of the century. Mescaline
is the psychoactive constituent of a Mexican cactus <i>Lophophora
williamsii </i>(syn. <i>Anhalonium lewinii)</i>. This cactus has
been eaten by American Indians ever since pre-Columbian times,
and is still used today as a sacred drug in religious ceremonies.
In his monograph <i>Phantastica </i>(Verlag Georg Stilke, Berlin,
1924), L. Lewin has amply described the history of this drug,
called peyotl by the Aztecs. The alkaloid mescaline was isolated
from the cactus by A. Heffter in 1896, and in 1919 its chemical
structure was elucidated and it was produced synthetically by E.
Spath. It was the first hallucinogen or phantasticum (as this
type of active compound was described by Lewin) to become
available as a pure substance, permitting the study of chemically
induced changes of sensory perceptions, mental illusions
(hallucinations), and alterations of consciousness. In the 1920s
extended experiments with mescaline were carried out on animal
and human subjects and described comprehensively by K. Beringer
in his book <i>Der Meskalinrausch </i>(Verlag Julius Springer,
Berlin, 1927). Because these investigations failed to indicate
any applications of mescaline in medicine, interest in this
active substance waned. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With the discovery of LSD, hallucinogen research
received a new impetus. The novelty of LSD as opposed to
mescaline was its high activity, lying in a different order of
magnitude. The active dose of mescaline, 0.2 to 0.5 g, is
comparable to 0.00002 to 0.0001 g of LSD; in other words, LSD is
some 5,000 to 10,000 times more active than mescaline. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; LSD's unique position among the
psychopharmaceuticals is not only due to its high activity, in a
quantitative sense. The substance also has qualitative
significance: it manifests a high specificity, that is, an
activity aimed specifically at the human psyche. It can be
assumed, therefore, that LSD affects the highest control centers
of the psychic and intellectual functions. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The psychic effects of LSD, which are produced by
such minimal quantities of material, are too meaningful and too
multiform to be explained by toxic alterations of brain function.
If LSD acted only through a toxic effect on the brain, then LSD
experiences would be entirely psychopathological in meaning,
without any psychological or psychiatric interest. On the
contrary, it is likely that alterations of nerve conductivity and
influence on the activity of nerve connections (synapses), which
have been experimentally demonstrated, play an important role.
This could mean that an influence is being exerted on the
extremely complex system of cross-connections and synapses
between the many billions of brain cells, the system on which the
higher psychic and intellectual functions depend. This would be a
promising area to explore in the search for an explanation of
LSD's radical efficacy. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The nature of LSD's activity could lead to numerous
possibilities of medicinal-psychiatric uses, as W. A. Stoll's
ground-breaking studies had already shown. Sandoz therefore made
the new active substance available to research institutes and
physicians as an experimental drug, giving it the trade name
Delysid (D-Lysergsäure-diäthylamid) which I had proposed. The
printed prospectus below describes possible applications of this
kind and voices the necessary precautions. <center></p>

<h4>Delysid (LSD 25)</h4>

<h4>D-lysergic acid diethylamide tartrate </h4>

<p>&nbsp; Sugar-coated tablets containing 0.025 mg. (25 µg) <br>
Ampoules of 1 ml. containing 0.1 mg. (100 µg) for <br>
oral administration</p>

<p> The solution may also be injected s.c. or i.v. The <br>
effect is identical with that of oral administration <br>
but sets in more rapidly.</center></p>

<p> <center><b>PROPERTIES </b></center></p>

<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; The administration of very small doses of
Delysid (1/2-2 µg/kg body weight) results in transitory
disturbances of affect, hallucinations, depersonalization,
reliving of repressed memories, and mild neurovegetative
symptoms. The effect sets in after 30 to 90 minutes and generally
lasts 5 to 12 hours. However, intermittent disturbances of affect
may occasionally persist for several days.</p>

<p> <center><b>METHOD OF ADMINISTRATION </b></center></p>

<p> For oral administration the contents of 1 ampoule of Delysid
are diluted with distilled water, a 1% solution of tartaric acid
or halogen-free tap water. The absorption of the solution is
somewhat more rapid and more constant than that of the tablets.
Ampoules which have not been opened, which have been protected
against light and stored in a cool place are stable for an
unlimited period. Ampoules which have been opened or diluted
solutions retain their effectiveness for 1 to 2 days, if stored
in a refrigerator.</p>

<p> <center><b>INDICATIONS AND DOSAGE </b></center></p>

<p> a) Analytical psychotherapy, to elicit release of repressed
material and provide mental relaxation, particularly in anxiety
states and obsessional neuroses.<br>
The initial dose is 25 µg (1/4 of an ampoule or 1 tablet). This
dose is increased at each treatment by 25 µg until the optimum
dose (usually between 50 and 200 µg) is found. The individual
treatments are best given at intervals of one week.<br>
b) Experimental studies on the nature of psychoses: By taking
Delysid himself, the psychiatrist is able to gain an insight into
the world of ideas and sensations of mental patients. Delysid can
also be used to induce model psychoses of short duration in
normal subjects, thus facilitating studies on the pathogenesis of
mental disease.<br>
In normal subjects, doses of 25 to 75 µg re generally sufficient
to produce a hallucinatory psychosis (on an average 1 µg/kg body
weight). In certain forms of psychosis and in chronic alcoholism,
higher doses are necessary (2 to 4 µg/kg body weight).</p>

<p> <center><b>PRECAUTIONS </b></center></p>

<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; Pathological mental conditions may be
intensified by Delysid. Particular caution is necessary in
subjects with a suicidal tendency and in those cases where a
psychotic development appears imminent. The psycho-affective
liability and the tendency to commit impulsive acts may
occasionally last for some days.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Delysid should only be administered under strict
medical supervision. The supervision should not be discontinued
until the effects of the drug have completely orn off.</p>

<p> <center><b>ANTIDOTE </b></center></p>

<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; The mental effects of Delysid can be rapidly
reversed by the i.m. administration of 50 mg chlorpromazine.</p>

<hr width="50%">

<p>&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The use of LSD in analytical psychotherapy is based
mainly on the following psychic effects. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In LSD inebriation the accustomed world view
undergoes a deep-seated transformation and disintegration.
Connected with this is a loosening or even suspension of the
I-you barrier. Patients who are bogged down in an egocentric
problem cycle can thereby be helped to release themselves from
their fixation and isolation. The result can be an improved
rapport with the doctor and a greater susceptibility to
psychotherapeutic influence. The enhanced suggestibility under
the influence of LSD works toward the same goal. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Another significant, psychotherapeutically valuable
characteristic of LSD inebriation is the tendency of long
forgotten or suppressed contents of experience to appear again in
consciousness. Traumatic events, which are sought in
psychoanalysis, may then become accessible to psychotherapeutic
treatment. Numerous case histories tell of experiences from even
the earliest childhood that were vividly recalled during
psychoanalysis under the influence of LSD. This does not involve
an ordinary recollection, but rather a true reliving; not a <i>réminiscence,</i>
but rather a <i>réviviscence,</i> as the French psychiatrist
Jean Delay has formulated it. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; LSD does not act as a true medicament; rather it
plays the role of a drug aid in the context of psychoanalytic and
psychotherapeutic treatment and serves to channel the treatment
more effectively and to shorten its duration. It can fulfill this
function in two particular ways. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In one procedure, which was developed in European
clinics and given the name <i>psychotytic therapy,</i> moderately
strong doses of LSD are administered in several successive
sessions at regular intervals. Subsequently the LSD experiences
are worked out in group discussions, and in expression therapy by
drawing and painting. The term <i>psycholytic therapy </i>was
coined by Ronald A. Sandison, an English therapist of Jungian
orientation and a pioneerof clinical LSD research. The root <i>-lysis
</i>or <i>-lytic </i>signifies the dissolution of tension or
conflicts in the human psyche. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In a second procedure, which is the favored
treatment in the United States, a single, very high LSD dose (0.3
to 0.6 mg) is administered after correspondingly intensive
psychological preparation of the patients. This method, described
as <i>psychedelic therapy</i>, attempts to induce a
mystical-religious experience through the shock effects of LSD.
This experience can then serve as a starting point for a
restructuring and curing of the patient's personality in the
accompanying psychotherapeutic treatment. The term <i>psychedelic</i>,
which can be translated as &quot;mind-manifesting&quot; or
&quot;mind-expanding,&quot; was introduced by Humphry Osmond, a
pioneer of LSD research in the United States. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; LSD's apparent benefits as a drug auxiliary in
psychoanalysis and psychotherapy are derived from properties
diametrically opposed to the effects of tranquilizer-type
psychopharmaceuticals. Whereas tranquilizers tend to cover up the
patient's problems and conflicts, reducing their apparent gravity
and importance: LSD, on the contrary, makes them more exposed and
more intensely experienced. This clearer recognition of problems
and conflicts makes them, in turn, more susceptible to
psychotherapeutic treatment. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The suitability and success of LSD in
psychoanalysis and psychotherapy are still a subject of
controversy in professional circles. The same could be said,
however, of other procedures employed in psychiatry such as
electroshock, insulin therapy, or psychosurgery, procedures that
entail, moreover, a far greater risk than the use of LSD, which
under suitable conditions can be considered practically safe. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Because forgotten or repressed experiences, under
the influence of LSD, may become conscious with considerable
speed, the treatment can be correspondingly shortened. To some
psychiatrists, however, this reduction of the therapy's duration
is a disadvantage. They are of the opinion that this
precipitation leaves the patient insufficient time for
psychotherapeutic working-through. The therapeutic effect they
believe, persists for a shorter time than when there is a gradual
treatment, including a slow process of becoming conscious of the
traumatic experiences. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Psycholytic and especially psychedelic therapy
require thorough preparation of the patient for the LSD
experience, to avoid his or her being frightened by the unusual
and the unfamiliar. Only then is a positive interpretation of the
experience possible. The selection of patients is also important,
since not all types of psychic disturbance respond equally well
to these methods of treatment. Successful use of LSD-assisted
psychoanalysis and psychotherapy presupposes specific knowledge
and experience. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In this respect self-examination by psychiatrists,
as W. A. Stoll has pointed out, can be most useful. They provide
the doctors with direct insight, based on firsthand experience
into the strange world of LSD inebriation, and make it possible
for them truly to understand these phenomena in their patients,
to interpret them properly, and to take full advantage of them. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The following pioneers in use of LSD as a drug aid
in psychoanalysis and psychotherapy deserve to be named in the

&nbsp; &nbsp; The second indication for LSD cited in the Sandoz
prospectus on Delysid concerns its use in experimental
investigations on the nature of psychoses. This arises from the
fact that extraordinary psychic states experimentally produced by
LSD in healthy research subjects are similar to many
manifestations of certain mental disturbances. In the early days
of LSD research, it was often claimed that LSD inebriation has
something to do with a type of &quot;model psychosis.&quot; This
idea was dismissed, however, because extended comparative
investigations showed that there were essential differences
between the manifestations of psychosis and the LSD experience.
With the LSD model, nevertheless, it is possible to study
deviations from the normal psychic and mental condition, and to
observe the biochemical and electrophysiological alterations
associated with them. Perhaps we shall thereby gain new insights
into the nature of psychoses. According to certain theories,
various mental disturbances could be produced by psychotoxic
metabolic products that have the power, even in minimal
quantities, to alter the functions of brain cells. LSD represents
a substance that certainly does not occur in the human organism,
but whose existence and activity let it seem possible that
abnormal metabolic products could exist, that even in trace
quantities could produce mental disturbances. As a result, the
conception of a biochemical origin of certain mental disturbances
has received broader support, and research in this direction has
been stimulated. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; One medicinal use of LSD that touches on
fundamental ethical questions is its administration to the dying.
This practice arose from observations in American clinics that
especially severe painful conditions of cancer patients, which no
longer respond to conventional pain-relieving medication, could
be alleviated or completely abolished by LSD. Of course, this
does not involve an analgesic effect in the true sense. The
diminution of pain sensitivity may rather occur because patients
under the influence of LSD are psychologically so dissociated
from their bodies that physical pain no longer penetrates their
consciousness. In order for LSD to be effective in such cases, it
is especially crucial that patients be prepared and instructed
about the kind of experiences and transformations that await
them. In many cases it has proved beneficial for either a member
of the clergy or a psychotherapist to guide the patient's
thoughts in a religious direction. Numerous case histories tell
of patients who gained meaningful insights about life and death
on their deathbeds as, freed from pain in LSD ecstasy and
reconciled to their fate, they faced their earthly demise
fearlessly and in peace. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The hitherto existing knowledge about the
administration of LSD to the terminally ill has been summarized
and published by S. Grof and J. Halifax in their book <i>The
Human Encounter with Death</i> (E. P. Dutton, New York, 1977).
The authors, together with E. Kast, S. Cohen, and W. A. Pahnke,
are among the pioneers of this application of LSD. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The most recent comprehensive publication on the
use of LSD in psychiatry, <i>Realms of the Human Unconscious:
Observations from LSD Research</i> (The Viking Press, New York,
1975), likewise comes from S. Grof, the Czech psychiatrist who
has emigrated to the United States. This book offers a critical
evaluation of the LSD experience from the viewpoint of Freud and
Jung, as well as of existential analysis. </p>
