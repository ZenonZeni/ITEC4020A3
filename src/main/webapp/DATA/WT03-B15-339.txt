MORRISON KNUDSEN AWARDED ANOTHER CONTRACT BY CORNING<p>
</b></center>

BOISE -- Morrison Knudsen Corporation has been awarded a contract by Corning, 
Inc. to provide architectural, engineering and construction-management 
services for a multimillion-dollar expansion project at Corning/Asahi 
Video Products Co. (CAV), a television picture-tube glass manufacturing 
plant in State College, Pennsylvania.<p>
     The expansion encompasses 11 different areas of the company's 
facility and manufacturing processes.  MK is responsible for facility 
design and construction; design of the batch mixing, scale
and transport systems; installation of automated glass-processing 
equipment; coordination with glass-furnace demolition and replacement; and 
project safety-program oversight and coordination. MK will sequence the 
project schedule, allowing for continuous plant production.  This project 
follows another major expansion at State College where MK is providing 
similar services to be completed by the end of 1996.<p>
     Robert A. Tinstman, MK's president and chief executive officer, said, 
"We are very proud of Corning's confidence in MK, and we look forward to 
providing again our around-the-clock commitment to meet project milestones 
and complete it within budget."<p>
     Morrison Knudsen Corporation (NYSE: MK), founded in 1912, serves the 
world's environmental, industrial, mining, operations & maintenance, 
power, process, transportation and heavy construction markets as an 
engineer and constructor.<p>
