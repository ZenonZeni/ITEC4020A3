A federal securities class action lawsuit is presently pending against Biogen,
Inc. (NASDAQ: BGEN) and its CEO, James L. Vincent (collectively, the
"Defendants") in the United States District Court for the District of
Massachusetts, entitled <U>In re: Biogen Securities Litigation</U>, Civ.
No. 94-12177-PBS (the "Action"). The complaint in the Action alleges that
the Defendants violated the federal securities laws by making misleading
statements about the results of clinical trials and other information about
Hirulog, one of the company's two key drugs under development. While the
proposed class period in the Action will be longer than the time period set
forth above, plaintiffs are seeking to communicate with persons who purchased
Biogen common stock during the above time period and who would like to
participate as a representative in the Action. If interested, please contact:
