<p><font size=+2 color="#004A4A">T</font>he Declaration of Principles from the Summit of the Americas, held in December 
1994, strongly endorsed the need to "create cooperative partnerships...to encourage 
clean, efficient, and sustainable energy production and use".  As a partner in the 
subsequent Hemispheric Energy Symposium, the Office of Energy Efficiency and 
Renewable Energy of the U.S. Department of Energy has created this Internet website 
to share experiences in the Western Hemisphere in implementing energy efficiency and 
renewable energy.  While the initial information is primarily focused on the U.S. 
because the Office has the most information on U.S. experiences, over time experiences 
throughout the hemisphere will be added to this website.
