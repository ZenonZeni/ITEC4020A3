<p><a href="eleucont.htm">THE ROAD TO ELEUSIS</a> </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Acting on an insight into the true nature of the Mysteries
    of Eleusis, R. Gordon Wasson sought the collaboration of
    Albert Hofmann and Carl A.P. Ruck, a classical scholar
    specializing in Greek ethnobotany. Closely coordinating their
    research, the three scholar-scientists first offered
    documentation on the religious rites at an International
    Conference on Hallucinogenic Mushrooms in 1977. These
    astonishing findings, given here in a much expanded version,
    leave little doubt that the ancient secret of Eleusis has at
    last been unveiled. HTML edition, table of contents and
    chapters I. through IV., copyright 1978 by Harcourt Brace
    Jovanovich. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="inglis.htm">THE FORBIDDEN GAME</a> </p>

trends well and with a thorough knowledge of the subject."
