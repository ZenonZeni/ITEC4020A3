<tt>On December 7 and 14, the House Immigration Subcommittee on Immigration and
Claims held hearings on agricultural guest workers.</tt><p>
<tt>The December 7 hearing was the first one devoted entirely to guest workers
in the 1995 round of immigration reform.  Growers testified that they support
efforts to reduce illegal immigration, but<b> </b>that they also want a
"viable, legal work force."  </tt><p>
<tt>The only way to guarantee such a work force, they argued, is with a new
standby guest worker program that would permit farmers to employ foreign
workers after attesting that they had attempted to hire domestic workers.
After filing such an attestation with the US Department of Labor, a farmer
would be allowed to recruit, have admitted into the US, and employ foreigners
unless complaints led the US government to revoke his right to do so.</tt><p>
<tt>Most observers do not believe that US farmers need a streamlined guest
worker program, because, by measures that range from wages to unemployment
rates, there are surpluses rather than shortages of farm workers.  Many growers
acknowledge the current labor surplus, but they assert that, with new efforts
to control illegal immigration, they will no longer be able to employ
unauthorized workers who present them with false documents.</tt><p>
<tt>The effect of proposed new immigration enforcement measures on the farm
labor supply depends on two unknowns:<b> </b>first, on how many people now in
the farm work force are unauthorized immigrants, and second, on how effective
the new measures will be.  Farmers assert that the share of unauthorized
workers is high--in excess of 50 percent of the farm work force--and that the
new measures to control illegal immigration will be both effective and
quickly-felt.  </tt><p>
<tt>Opponents say that the illegal-immigrant share is lower (the US Department
of Labor estimate is 25 percent), and that any impacts of immigration
enforcement on farm labor supplies will be gradual and incremental, not sudden
and dramatic.  Furthermore, they say that growers could adjust to fewer
unauthorized workers by recruiting US workers and temporary foreign workers
through the H-2A program, or reducing their demand for labor through
mechanization or better management of farm labor.</tt><p>
<tt>Both President Clinton and the US Commission on Immigration Reform (CIR)
oppose a new agricultural guest worker program, arguing that a new guest worker
program would increase illegal immigration and reduce employment, wages, and
work standards for American workers.  President Clinton stated in June that if
a crackdown on illegal immigration, which he favors,<b> </b>should create labor
shortages for perishable crops, he will instruct the Departments of Labor and
Agriculture to work together to improve existing programs to meet agriculture's
needs.  </tt><p>
<tt>At the December 7 hearing, representatives skeptical about a new foreign
farm labor program, including Subcommittee Chair Lamar Smith(R-TX), agreed with
the majority of economists and immigration specialists, who say that if 20 to
40 percent of the current farm work force is unauthorized, farm employers will
be able to adjust gradually to the loss of unauthorized workers by employing US
workers and getting legal foreign workers through the H-2A program.</tt><p>
<tt>Academic researchers and representatives of farm worker organizations
pointed to the current farm-labor surplus in the United States, falling real
wages, benefits, and working conditions for farm workers, and high levels of
unemployment and underemployment.  A new guest worker program, they<b>
</b>contended, is neither justified nor workable in such a surplus-labor
environment.</tt><p>
<tt>The most outspoken opponent of a new agricultural guest worker program
present at the December 7 hearing was Howard Berman (D-CA).</tt><p>
<tt>On December 14, the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration and Claims
and the Agriculture Subcommittee on Risk Management and Specialty Crops held a
joint hearing on guest workers.  USDA testified that the Clinton administration
is opposed to the establishment of a new guest worker program; the existing
H-2A program is a "sufficient means to provide relief to farm employers from
serious labor shortages as well as to improve the wages and working conditions
of US agricultural workers."</tt><p>
<tt>Growers argued that the H-2A program<b> </b>fails to meet their needs and
cannot be made to work.  They urged approval of the simpler attestation
procedure for obtaining temporary foreign farm workers.  </tt><p>
<tt>Although the growers program has not yet been released in detail, growers
assert that, under it, they would attest that they had tried recruit US workers
and promise that if they consequently employed temporary foreign workers, they
would pay them at least the<b> </b>prevailing wage rate; provide housing or a
housing allowance when it is the prevailing practice; confine the guest workers
to jobs that last less than 10 months; notify existing farm workers they have
filed attestations; give preference to qualified US workers in hiring; and
avoid using guest workers when there is a strike or lockout.  </tt><p>
<tt>Growers would pay for the cost of administering the program with
contributions to a trust fund equivalent to the payroll taxes that would not be
paid on the guest workers' wages.</tt><p>
<tt>Some growers argued for a better employee verification system.  One Florida
farmer was reportedly fined $150,000 for hiring illegal alien workers, and then
fined again - $120,000 - for firing 40 workers whose documents did not appear
to be in order.</tt><p>
<tt>Growers are gaining allies.  An<b> </b>op-ed article in the Wall Street
Journal on November 9 advocated a guest worker program for agriculture.  Its
author, Rael Jean Isaac, argued that the Bracero program "worked," and, for
this reason, the current H-2A program through which temporary alien farm
workers are admitted for US farm work should be revamped to resemble the 1950s
Bracero program.</tt><p>
<tt>The Isaac article and a summary of grower testimony to the Senate
Immigration Subcommittee on September 28 (MN, October, 1995), prompted many
responses in the Wall Street Journal.  For example, it was noted that, when all
the costs are counted, there may be nothing more expensive than cheap farm
workers.  In Santa Barbara county, strawberry acreage increased almost four
times between 1986 and 1993, and the resulting farm worker poverty helped a
local employment training agency to win a $500,000 training grant by arguing
that the number of poor farm workers in the area had increased.</tt><p>
<tt>Isaac and other writers often<b> </b>overlook<b> </b>significant details of
the Bracero program.  First, there was not one program, but several programs,
some administered by the USDA, some by DOL.  For a few years, farmers could
recruit workers in any manner they chose, as in the H-2A program.  Second,
there was always opposition to the Bracero program--the President's Commission
on Migratory Labor in 1951 recommended against a Bracero program.  Congress
overrode this recommendation, but included several of the protective features
that the Commission recommended.</tt><p>
<tt>Farmers not wishing to follow Bracero program guidelines encouraged illegal
immigration and employment in the early 1950s.  They were shielded by the
"Texas proviso" of the 1952 INA, under which the only punishment for employment
of illegal aliens, even when it was deliberate, was the removal of the aliens
from the employer's premises.  Farmer resistance to PL-78 Bracero program
guidelines in the early 1950s, plus the dependence of hundreds of thousands of
Mexican workers on US jobs, are what produced the "wetback crisis" of 1954.
</tt><p>
<tt>Third, the undoing of the Bracero program began in the late 1950s, when the
Secretary of Labor in a Republican administration decided to<b> </b>enforce the
rules under which Mexicans worked in the US  Farmers complained bitterly, but
when it became clear that, starting in 1961, Democrats would enforce the rules
even more vigorously, research aimed at saving labor grew enormously.  The
University of California alone was engaged in over 300 labor-saving
mechanization research projects in the early 1960s, including the successful
effort to mechanize the processing tomato harvest.</tt><p>
<tt>A guest worker program can always convert illegal into legal workers, as
was done in the mid-1950s.  But the Bracero program proves that admitting
hundreds of thousands of unskilled workers for as little as six weeks can have
unforeseen and undesired consequences.</tt><p>
<tt>In early November, several of the House Republicans spearheading
immigration reform efforts toured California fields to hear growers' proposals
for a guest worker program.  Immigration subcommittee chair Smith was quoted as
saying that he hopes his immigration reform bill will not have "an adverse
effect on the labor supply," which some growers interpreted as support for a
guest worker program, since they maintain that 30 to 50 percent of their
current work force are illegal aliens.</tt><p>
<tt>The grower strategy is to exaggerate the share of unauthorized workers in
the farm work force, agree with Congress that new controls will quickly reduce
illegal immigration, establish that the H-2A program is not a sufficient safety
valve, and thus justify a new guest worker program now, while Congress is
dealing with immigration reform, rather than in the future, when there may be
farm labor shortages.</tt><p>
<tt>The purpose of guest or non-immigrant worker programs is to add workers to
the labor force without adding permanent residents to the population.  Critics
point out that, from Japan to Germany,<b> </b>guest worker programs have failed
to do that<b>, </b>inspiring the adage that there is nothing so permanent as a
temporary workers<b>.</b></tt><p>
<tt><b></b>Over time, employers, investors, and local workers begin to make
decisions that assume that foreign workers will continue to be available, so
that the familiar argument, "we will go out of business without foreign
workers," becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.</tt><p>
<tt>Professor Mark Miller of the University of Delaware noted that France's
seasonal worker program admits primarily alien farm workers, but it shrank from
200,000 in 1974 to 11,300 in 1994, when mostly Moroccans and Poles were
admitted.</tt><p>
<tt>Many of the illegal alien farm workers who became legal residents in the
1987-88 Special Agricultural Worker program got green cards in December 1990,
are now eligible to apply for US citizenship.  About 52 percent of the 1.3
million SAW applications were filed in California, and 82 percent of all
applicants were from Mexico.  The INS received one million applications for
naturalization in 1995.</tt><p>
<tt>The effects of a wave of farm worker naturalizations are the subjects of
debate.  The INS and most farm worker advocates encourage naturalization as a
means of promoting inclusion-- giving all residents full rights.  However, some
immigration control groups, as well as some local officials, assert that
naturalization will increase family unification and welfare
costs.<b></b></tt><p>

processing and returning to Mexico<b>,</b> or detaining<b>,</b> a hypothetical
mass of illegal migrant Mexicans--the third such INS test of a mass migration
emergency in 1995.  The INS noted that no such mass migration is expected, but
that the Haitian and Cuban migration emergencies in 1994 demonstrated the need
to plan for such contingencies.</tt><p>
<tt>A Mexican official said that the exercises was not appropriate, and that
the cyclical flow of migrants into the US for employment is now a structural
feature of the North American labor market.</tt><p>
<tt>In late December, the US announced that a ring headed by a woman in Costa
Rica had been broken up after smuggling 10,000 aliens annually into the US.
According to an interagency working group on the smuggling of illegal aliens to
the United States, "some 100,000 aliens from outside the region" pass through
one or more Central American countries annually on their way to the United
States.</tt><p>
<tt>The money to be earned from alien smuggling is reportedly fueling
corruption.  In 1995, immigration officials in Panama, Belize and Guatemala
were fired for accepting bribes from alien smugglers.  Honduras is the only
Central American country in which smuggling of humans is a crime.</tt><p>
<tt>The interagency report estimated that 500,000 illegal aliens enter Western
Europe each year, many transiting through Moscow, where an estimated 200,000
illegal aliens may be in temporary residence at any time, including 60,000
Chinese and 40,000 South Asians.  The report criticizes Taiwan for
"unsatisfactory" cooperation against alien smugglers despite repeated US
requests for action.</tt><p>
<tt>The Department of Justice's Inspector General issued a report on December
1, 1995 that criticized INS for negotiating low fines and easy settlements with
employers discovered to have hired illegal aliens.  About 10,000 US employers
faced fines of about $70 million between FY90 and FY94; these fines were
settled for $29 million, or less than half the initial levy.  Most of the fines
were for paperwork violations, not for hiring illegal alien workers.</tt><p>
<tt>Some 2,200 California employers were initially charged $14 million.  The
largest potential fine was against the Walt Disney company, which faced
$400,000 in fines for improper paper work on 1,200 new hires.</tt><p>
<tt>The INS announced that, after March 20, 1996, I-151 green cards issued
before 1970 will not longer be valid.  The INS is attempting to reduce fraud by
issuing new and harder to counterfeit cards to permanent resident aliens who
have the right to live and work practically anywhere in the US.  The new card
will require a photograph, fingerprint and signature.  The new card costs $75,
but the INS will waive the fee for those who cannot afford it.</tt><p>
<tt>The INS and other agencies that screen arriving US citizens and aliens
announced steps aimed at speeding up the process beginning in March 1996.  In
FY94, some 444 million persons entered the US over the northern and southern
borders, and 57 million international passengers arrived at US airports.</tt><p>
<tt>The INS is one of the fastest-growing federal agencies--it has 21,800
full-time employees, including almost 5,000 Border Patrol agents.  Its FY96
budget is expected to be $1.7 billion, and with fee income, $2.6
billion--budget language instructs INS to add 1,000 more Border Patrol agents
on the US-Mexican border.</tt><p>
<tt>The INS announced that the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements
Program (SAVE) won an innovative technology award.  SAVE includes data on 50
million non-US citizens, and federal and state service providers, from the Food
Stamp program to AFDC to federal housing assistance to the California
Department of Motor Vehicles, use the system to verify the immigrant status of
alien applicants for benefits and services.  </tt><p>
<tt>SAVE was implemented in 1989, and through June 1995 had dealt with over 21
million inquires--about 149,000 persons were denied benefits, about seven
tenths of one percent.  The SAVE system has recently been expanded to verify
the status of newly hired private sector workers in southern California.</tt><p>
<tt>In FY95, the INS apprehended 524,234 illegal immigrants in the San Diego
sector.  Some 1,200 criminals trying to re-enter the country have been
prosecuted so far this year, and 3,000 people arrested with counterfeit
immigration documents were detained for 72 hours, taken before an immigration
judge and deported.</tt><p>
<tt>The INS announced on December 28, 1995 that it had removed a record 51,600
criminal aliens from the US in 1995, two-thirds of whom were criminal aliens
who were deported after serving prison terms in the US.  The INS also prevented
9,400 aliens from entering the US in 1995, up from 5,700 in 1994.  </tt><p>
<tt>California Governor Pete Wilson asked the federal government to take
symbolic custody of one of California's 16,000 criminal aliens to show that the
federal government is responsible for criminal aliens.  California's 1993
lawsuit for federal reimbursement of costs associated with illegal immigrants
is still pending--California estimates that it costs $21,000 per year to
accommodate prisoners. </tt><p>
<tt>Some 147 of the 282 Chinese aliens aboard the Golden Venture, the smuggling
ship that ran aground in New York in June 1993, remain in US jails.  Some have
begun hunger strikes.  The crew that smuggled them to the US received jail
terms of one to 4.5 years.</tt><p>
<tt>The New Jersey Senate in October approved legislation that would require
employers with state contracts to certify that all of their employees are
entitled to work in the US.  A second measure would make undocumented workers
ineligible for worker's compensation and temporary disability payments for
workplace injuries.</tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC4">Congress</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>
Debates Jus Soli</a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt>On December 13, 1995, two Congressional subcommittees held a hearing on
proposals to deny US citizenship to the children of illegal aliens born in the
US.  House Immigration Chair Lamar Smith (R-TX) invited eight House members and
former Congresswoman Barbara Jordan to testify for and against the possibility
of constitutional amendments or changes in federal immigration law to curtail
the benefits of citizenship to illegal immigrants. </tt><p>
<tt>The US Constitution contained no definition of citizenship until the
adoption of the 14th Amendment in 1868.  It states: "All persons born or
naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are
citizens of the United States and the state wherein they reside." </tt><p>
<tt>The 14th Amendment has been interpreted to mean that all persons born in
the US--except children born to parents not subject to the jurisdiction of the
US because they are diplomats or representatives of international
organizations-- are automatically US citizens<b>.</b>  In 1898, the US Supreme
Court ruled that a child born in San Francisco to Chinese parents who could not
become citizens themselves was automatically a US citizen.</tt><p>
<tt>According to Rep. Lamar Smith(R-TX),<b> </b>"The original intent and
purpose of the 14th Amendment was not to grant birthright citizenship."
</tt><p>
<tt>Rep. Brian Bilbray, (R-CA) sponsored H.R. 1363, the "Citizenship Reform Act
of 1995, which "would deny automatic citizenship at birth to children born in
the United States to parents who are not citizens or permanent resident
aliens."</tt><p>
<tt>According to Bilbray, the bill would reinterpret the Constitution, an
approach that would be faster than a Constitutional amendment.  The Justice
Department has said that such a change<b> </b>would not be in keeping with US
constitutional history and tradition.  If the bill were enacted, no discretion
could be exercised by public officials on the questions, the department
maintains.  Another bill, introduced by Sonny Callahan (R-AL) would also deny
citizenship to the children of legal immigrants.</tt><p>
<tt>The emotional hearing featured testimony of opponents, such as Rep. Jose E.
Serranno (D-NY), who said that the bills were "a reaction to little brown
babies that simply aren't welcome here."  The hearing was dominated by
Californians who are concerned about he impact illegal immigration has on the
state.  In 1992, undocumented immigrants gave birth to 92,000 babies in
California under the Medi-Cal program, making such births 40 percent of the
237,000 publicly funded births in the state.</tt><p>
<tt>Proponents of change say that such a situation was not imaginable in 1868;
opponents say changing the 14th amendment affects core American values--
birthright citizenship. </tt><p>
<tt>Bilbray argued that it is unfair to offer generous health and welfare
benefits to the children of illegal immigrants: "The gift of citizenship is the
greatest gift we can bestow. To give it to those who break the law is an insult
to every legal immigrant." </tt><p>
<tt>Commission on Immigration Reform Chair Barbara Jordan countered that: "To
deny birthright citizenship is to derail the engine of American liberty."
</tt><p>
<tt>In a study of 38 countries, the Center for  Immigration Studies found that
13 --including Mexico, Canada, Brazil and Spain-- grant citizenship based on
place of birth.  Twenty-five require also that at least one parent be a citizen
or of that country's<b> </b>ethnicity, and six of the twenty-five specify
whether it is to be the mother or the father who provides the link.</tt><p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC5">Prop.
187</a>
Judges Urges Speedy Appeal</a></h2>
<tt>In November, 1995, a federal judge, in a 72-page 
<a href=Prop_187_Opinion.html>OPINION </a> (League of United
Latin American Citizens v. Wilson, Case No. CV 94-7569 MRP--available on the
Migration News Home Page), declared most parts of Prop. 187 unconstitutional, a
decision that the state of California vowed to appeal--one official called the
judge's decision the first round in a ten-round fight.  </tt><p>
<tt>The US Supreme Court has ruled that the "power to regulate immigration is
unquestionably exclusively a federal power," and the judge held that
"Proposition 187's verification, notification and cooperation/reporting
requirements directly regulate immigration by creating a comprehensive scheme
to detect and report the presence and effect the removal of illegal
aliens."</tt><p>
<tt>After her ruling, the judge said that she wants a quick appeal, but gave
state lawyers until the end of January to decide if they want to push ahead
with a section cutting health benefits to illegal immigrants.  She also said
that she supports a permanent injunction of Prop. 187 to speed the final
resolution of<b> </b>the legal issues. </tt><p>
<tt>The key distinction in most of the ruling is the source of funds.  If an
assistance program is funded with both federal and state funds, the judge ruled
that California could not unilaterally make illegal aliens ineligible for
benefits.  But if the program is funded with state funds<b> </b>only, then
California can make illegal aliens ineligible for benefits.  </tt><p>
<tt>Only in K-12 education is the source of funds irrelevant--in this case, a
1982 US Supreme Court decision requires states to educate illegal alien
children.  The judge ruled, however, that under federal law California can deny
entry and in-state tuition status to illegal aliens seeking entry to colleges
and universities.   A California state judge has so far prevented this policy
from taking effect.</tt><p>
<tt>Attorneys representing California argued<b> </b>that the state has a right
and duty to conserve scarce state funds, and to spend them as voters wish.  The
federal judge, by contrast, emphasized that only the federal government has the
power to regulate immigration.</tt><p>
<tt>Some commentators noted that the judge's decision may prompt Congress to
enact a Prop.-187 measure, since Congress--but not the states-- has the
constitutional right to make aliens ineligible for benefits.  Since 1964,
judges have invalidated six of the 36 initiatives approved by California
voters.  The 1978 Proposition 13, which limited property taxes, survived legal
challenge</tt><p>

Works on Dual Nationality</a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt>Mexico in 1996 is expected to approve a dual nationality amendment to the
Mexican Constitution that would permit Mexican nationals who become citizens of
another country to retain the right to own land in coastal areas and to retain
their shares of ejido or communal lands.  Mexicans opting for US or other
citizenship would lose their right to vote in Mexican elections, but could
retain their Mexican passports.</tt><p>
<tt>President Zedillo made dual citizenship a key plank in his foreign policy,
and on several occasions reminded the estimated two to three million
Mexican-born nationals in the US who are eligible to apply for US citizenship
that they are Mexicans who happen to live north of the border.  Some US
observers fear that Mexico is "interfering" in US politics by urging its
nationals living in the US to become US citizens, and then support Mexican
government positions in the US.  Mexico has 51 consulates throughout the US,
while the US has 16 consulates in Mexico.</tt><p>
<tt>Over 8,000 Mexicans applied for asylum in the US in 1994 and 1995, and
about 60 were granted asylum, most in 1995.  In FY94, Haitians were most likely
to receive asylum in the US (1,060 Haitians were granted asylum) and in FY95,
946 Indians were granted asylum.</tt><p>
<tt>On December 18, 1995, NAFTA was to permit trucks that satisfy national
standards to cross the border and to deliver goods within border states with
foreign drivers, not just the current 20-mile commercial limit.  After pressure
from the Teamsters Union, the US Department of Transportation announced that
there would be a delay in free access, pending the outcome of discussions with
Mexico about highway safety.</tt><p>
<tt>Although US truckers can carry goods into Mexico, few US companies permit
their drivers to take goods into Mexico because of fears of theft, so the major
beneficiary of this NAFTA provision would have been Mexican truckers. </tt><p>
<tt>The US Teamsters union and border state politicians pressured the Clinton
Administration not to permit Mexican trucks to move beyond the 20-mile zone.
According to those favoring a delay in free Mexican truck movement, 1,200 of
the 5,000 Mexican trucks entering Texas every day are time bombs because they
carry fuel or explosives in unsafe trucks--in many cases, Mexican trucks meet
Mexican safety standards, but not US safety standards.</tt><p>
<tt>Instead of making cross border truck traffic easier, on December 19, there
were stepped up US safety checks of Mexican trucks entering the US.  Some
Mexican drivers, who reportedly earn $62 per week, complained of
discrimination.  The trucking delay illustrates the problems involved in
integrating two very different economies.</tt><p>
<tt>Along most of the US-Mexican border, the Mexican city is more populous than
its US counterpart.  Juarez, a city of 1.5 million residents across the Rio
Grande from El Paso, a city of 600,000, has about 25 percent of Mexico's
maquiladora employment--some 150,000 Mexicans work in 310 maquiladoras.  Juarez
had a city budget of $37 million in 1994, and the mayor notes that, with this
small budget, Juarez is unable to build the infrastructure needed in this
fast-growing city.  The minimum wage in Juarez was raised to $20 per week on
December 4, 1995.  Border residents complain that the Mexican government has
begun to collect import taxes from Mexican shoppers who return from the United
States with more than $400 in consumer goods.</tt><p>
<tt>In 1995, total compensation--wages plus benefits--paid to maquiladora
workers is expected to average $1.80 an hour, down from $2.61 in 1994.  The
NAFTA labor commission ruled in a case involving a Sony TV assembly plant in
Matamoros that the Mexican government failed to enforce the right of workers to
freely organize.</tt><p>
<tt>In the US, by comparison, the total compensation paid to private sector
workers averaged $17.10 an hour in March 1995, with straight-time wages and
salaries averaging $ 12.25 an hour and benefit costs averaging $ 4.85, making
benefit costs 29 percent of total compensation.  Benefit costs accounted for 36
percent of  total compensation for union workers in March, 1995, and 27 percent
for non-union employees.</tt><p>
<tt>Mexico in 1994 had a $1.4 billion trade deficit with the US, as Mexicans
imported more than they exported.  In 1995, Mexico exported $15 billion more in
goods than it imported from the US--in 1996, Mexico may export a total $100
billion worth of goods.</tt><p>
<tt>The corruption scandal involving Raul Salinas, brother of ex-President
Carlos Salinas, prompted calls for the return of the ex-President to face
corruption charges.  Raul Salinas, on a government salary of less than $200,000
per year, bought numerous properties in Mexico, and stashed at least $100
million in accounts abroad.</tt><p>

<tt>South Korean immigrants are a prosperous community of about 35,000 in
Argentina.  South Koreans operate more<b> </b>about 1,000  businesses in
Argentina, many in the garment districts of Once and Flores.  There are<b>
</b>about 300 Korean cultural, athletic and business associations, and<b>
</b>some 30 Protestant churches with predominantly Korean congregations in the
country.</tt><p>
<tt>Some Jewish shop owners<b> </b>said that the South Koreans were "taking
over."  The South Koreans work 12 to 14 hours per day, sell merchandise at low
prices, and hire cheap labor from Bolivia.  </tt><p>
<tt>The first wave of South Korean immigrants to South America went to Brazil
in 1961.  The South Korean government persuaded Brazil to accept the
immigrants, and allowed each to take $40,000 to South America.  The second wave
of South Koreans came four years later to Argentina, Paraguay, and Chile.  From
1965 to 1985, about 6,000 South Koreans emigrated to Argentina and, by 1985,
there were 50,000 South Koreans in the Southern Cone nation. </tt><p>
<tt>Sociologists say that the South Koreans were successful in Argentina
because they shared credit and employment inside large families and because
they brought in cheap labor from neighboring countries.  A series of newspaper
articles published several years ago tarnished the image of South Korean
entrepreneurs, who were accused of operating sweat shops with undocumented
Bolivians .</tt><p>
<tt>The South Koreans charge that their success has led to discrimination
against them, aggravated by recession.</tt><p>
<tt>Argentinean police broke up a smuggling ring that helped smuggle Chinese
and Hong Kong residents through Argentina to Canada and the United States.  The
illegal immigrants paid about $30,000 dollars each for the voyage.  Many of the
immigrants were employed in Chinese restaurants while their documents to be
smuggled into the US or Canada were prepared.  Seventy-five immigrants were
captured and between 30 and 40 were deported. </tt><p>
<tt>After growing by over seven percent in 1994, economic growth in Argentina
slowed to one percent in 1995, prompting the government to crack down on
illegal immigrants.</tt><p>

<tt>In 1993, the US government spent $300 billion on programs for poor
residents through six major programs--Medicaid ($132 billion), food stamps and
SSI ($26 billion each), AFDC ($25 billion), low-income housing assistance ($20
billion), and Head Start and other compensatory education programs ($10
billion).  Under most of these programs, all individuals who qualify and apply
receive assistance, so that the annual cost of the program cannot be determined
precisely in advance.</tt><p>
<tt>Under welfare reforms approved by Congress, many of these federal
assistance programs will be capped at a certain level of funding, and the
moneys turned over to states in a block grant for the state to spend under
rules that they devise.  States would have to spend 25 cents of their funds to
assist the poor for every 75 cents received in the federal government block
grant.</tt><p>
<tt>Welfare reform with a time limit on cash assistance is moving closer to
reality.  Whether the time limit turns out to be two or five years, experts are
bracing for the movement into the labor force of four to five million adults
who now receive cash payments.</tt><p>
<tt>So far, 24 states have asked for federal approval of time limits on welfare
and, in one state, Michigan, one-third of the adults receiving general
assistance in 1992 found full-time jobs within two years of being forced off
the rolls.</tt><p>
<tt>On November 13, a House-Senate conference committee agreed to create a $3.5
billion fund to cover the cost of providing emergency health care to
unauthorized aliens in the 15 states with the most such residents over the next
five years.  In 1994, Congress for the first time approved funds to reimburse
states for the costs of incarcerating illegal aliens who commit crimes in the
US; the health funds are the first federal funds specifically earmarked for
covering states' health care service costs.  </tt><p>
<tt>If approved, the welfare reforms would make ineligible or restrict the
access of legal immigrants to federal welfare programs from food stamps to
AFDC. In addition, U.S. residents who sponsor their relatives to be immigrants
would have the affidavits they sign to show that the immigrant will not request
welfare benefits become legally binding until the immigrant becomes a US
citizen.</tt><p>
<tt>California has more than half of the estimated 1.5 million legal immigrants
currently receiving either Aid to Families With Dependent Children or
Supplemental Security Income.  There are 3.2 million foreign-born people in Los
Angeles county, and the county estimates that, if welfare reforms are enacted,
207,000 of the county's legal immigrants on Aid to Families With Dependent
Children, 276,000 on food stamps and 68,000 on Supplemental Security Income
could be cut off.</tt><p>
<tt>A profile of newcomers to the Sacramento area reported that families from
the ex-USSR arriving as refugees knew one English word--welfare.  Almost half
of the 75,000 refugees who settled in the Sacramento area since 1975 are on
welfare.  California's four million welfare recipients receive about $30
billion annually, and refugees reportedly receive about 10 percent of all
welfare benefits in the state.</tt><p>
<tt>One profile of a Pentecostal refugee family with 13 minor children noted
that, with AFDC payments of almost $1,300 per month, plus $1,000 in Food
Stamps, and health care, the family would have to earn $61,000 per year to be
better off working, an unlikely event since the parents did not speak English.
</tt><p>
<tt>Adult children in refugee families get $399 per month for eight months
while they attend English and job search classes, and then $299 per month in
general assistance.  Older family members get $513 per month in SSI payments.
There are about 20,000 Christians from the ex-USSR in the Sacramento
area.</tt><p>
<tt>Many other Russian immigrants denounce the tendency of Baptists and
Pentecostals with large families to arrive as refugees, and to get and stay on
welfare in the US.  According to some established Russians, California has made
it too easy to transfer from the Russian to the California welfare system, so
that, in the words of one, moving to the US is truly moving to the "promised
land."  </tt><p>
<tt>California has relatively generous welfare benefits, and automatic
eligibility, plus a weak economy, could lead to the surprise that so many,
rather than so few, refugees get off welfare.</tt><p>
<tt>St. Louis has about 80,000 immigrants and refugees, and expects to receive
another 20,000 before the end of the century.  Immigration to St. Louis
includes a wide range of  ethnic groups, from Russians to Ethiopians.  The
heterogeneity of the newcomers means that many languages and special
circumstances must be provided for, leading to gaps in services.  </tt><p>
<tt>The US State Department has deemed St. Louis a favorable site for
resettling refugees.  In the mid-1970s, many Vietnamese refugees who were sent
to St. Louis soon left for California. </tt><p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC10">Reducing
Immigration</a> in Italy and Britain</a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt>In November, 1995, Britain proposed and Italy adopted tough new measures
against illegal immigrants and the employers who hire them.  Britain's Asylum
and Immigration Bill includes employer sanctions, fines of up to L5,000 ($8000)
for knowingly hiring illegal workers, and a rule that would oblige schools and
hospitals to report suspected illegal immigrants.  </tt><p>
<tt>There were a record number of asylum applications in the UK in 1995: 36,000
to December, 1995, almost double the number in 1993.  The government is
proposing to deny them welfare and other benefits that total L215 million per
year. <b> </b>Asylum seekers would be ineligible for welfare benefits, and
those from "safe" countries of origin would be sent home while their
applications were considered.  On January 8, 1996 some 6,000 asylum applicants
in the UK were expected to lose their benefits, but in mid-December, the
government postponed the cut-off until Parliament has a chance to debate
it.</tt><p>
<tt>Critics of the measure contend the loss of benefits for asylum seekers will
result in homelessness. </tt><p>
<tt>About 70 percent of UK asylum applicants apply after they are inside the
UK, and half apply<b> </b>after being arrested in the U.K. for a criminal
offense.</tt><p>
<tt>In Italy, the government added criminal penalties to its employer sanctions
law by decree, and permitted the immediate expulsion of persons who lack
residence permits, and foreigners who commit crimes in Italy.  Italy reported
that 15,000 foreigners, mainly from Albania, were caught in the southern Puglia
region between May and November, 1995.</tt><p>
<tt>The European Parliament on December 13, 1995 discussed the report on the
EU's progress on issues covered by Title VI of the Maastricht Treaty.  That
section of the 1992 Treaty on European Union (TEU) provided the legal framework
for a reinforcement of intergovernmental cooperation between the EU Member
governments in the field of Justice and Home Affairs - the so-called "Third
Pillar of the Treaty".  Under the Maastricht treaty, immigration policy is
classified as a "question of common interest" and thus subject to the adoption
of minimum EU standards.  </tt><p>
<tt>The European Parliament has been urging the European Commission to play a
more active role in promoting freedom of movement, including the movement
inside Europe of third-party nationals settled in one EU country, and to
monitor the treatment of asylum seekers.  </tt><p>
<tt>For example, a majority of the EP voted to make sexual violence a
recommended ground for EU nations to grant asylum, and to broaden Article 1A of
the Geneva Convention to make eligible for asylum all persons persecuted in
their countries, even if the persecution is not carried out by the government.
A majority of the EP also voted to recommend that employers with illegal
workers who fail to contribute required payroll taxes should pay such taxes
into a fund to promote the reintegration of returned illegal aliens.  The EP
also urged EU nations to permit dual nationality for legal residents.</tt><p>
<tt>However, EU activities in immigration and other social issues are governed
by "subsidiarity," the principle that national governmental units should deal
with the issues they are best equipped to handle.  Subsidiarity and an ongoing
Social Dialogue between employers and workers are arguments used against
further EU activities in social issues.</tt><p>
<tt>In June 1995, EU Justice and Interior Ministers adopted a resolution that
established the general principal that asylum seekers should have the right of
appeal if their applications are rejected, and should be allowed to remain in
the country while the appeal is pending.  However, this principal of appeal and
temporary stay does not apply if the ground for rejection is that the applicant
could and should have sought asylum in a "safe-third country" through which he
passed en route to the country of application.</tt><p>
<tt>France, the Netherlands, Denmark, Finland and Germany have national
legislation that follows this principal; the other EU members are expected to
adopt such legislation by January 1, 1996.</tt><p>
<tt>In France, a December 1994 law targeted at alien smugglers caught several
"ordinary people" in its web, such as the French woman who received a suspended
three-month jail term for failing to report her illegal Congolese
fianc&eacute;.  Both France and Spain have warned African countries that their
aid and trade concessions depend on these countries' help in curbing
emigration.</tt><p>
<tt>Most European countries have separate systems for dealing with
unaccompanied asylum applicants aged 16 and under--they are often housed and
cared for at least several months before their applications for asylum are
dealt with.  As one result, some parents in Turkey and ex-Yugoslavia are
sending their children abroad alone.</tt><p>
<tt>In the 1990s, European nations have unemployment rates that are double the
US rate, a sharp reversal from the 1960s, when European unemployment rates were
half the US rate--the EU's unemployment rate for 1995 is expected to average
10.7 percent.  There are many analyses of causes and cures, with the most
common prescription being to scale back the welfare state--reduce the amount
and duration of unemployment insurance payments, reduce minimum wages and
payroll taxes, and make it easier to dismiss workers-- so that unemployed
workers are more willing to lower their expectations and accept new jobs, even
at lower wages or in a different area, and employers are more willing to hire
them.  </tt><p>
<tt>In the US, workers tend to leave areas experiencing high unemployment,
which is why differences in state unemployment rates do not persist.  In
Europe, by contrast, the adjustment to higher unemployment often involves a
shrinking of the labor force, as women and older workers drop out of the labor
force.</tt><p>
<tt>One analyst of why "Euroschlerosis" is much discussed and little tackled
observes that the clear winners from more flexible and presumably lower wage
labor markets are relatively few--stock owners, some unemployed workers who get
jobs, and the skilled workers whose wages rise because the unemployed workers
are employed.</tt><p>
<tt>There is no obvious relationship between the percentage of foreigners in
European populations and the unemployment rate--Portugal had relatively few
foreigners (one percent) and a low unemployment rate (four percent), while
Belgium had about nine percent foreigners, and 10 percent unemployment.  These
examples imply that the more foreigners, the more unemployment.</tt><p>
<tt>EU officials and national governments are attempting to deal with problems
arising from<b> </b>the recruitment of "hostesses" and "dancers" for jobs in
western Europe.  In some cases, smugglers have been able to take advantage of
laws that provide relatively easy entry for "artists." </tt><p>
<tt>Women, who suffer much higher unemployment rates in Eastern Europe than
men, are induced to be prostitutes in western Europe.  An estimated 75 percent
of the Netherlands' 10,000 prostitutes are foreigners.  Switzerland offered
1800 visas to "dancers" in 1994, one-third of whom were from eastern
Europe.</tt><p>
<tt>EU leaders in mid-December agreed to consider the applications of eastern
European nations to join the EU at the end of 1997.</tt><p>
<tt>Migration was discussed extensively at the "EuroMed" conference in
Barcelona in late November, with North Africans complaining that illegal
immigration was often discussed in conjunction with terrorism and drugs rather
than trade.  According to some Europeans, migration from North African and
Turkey is simply repeating 1960s migrations from southern Europe to northern
Europe. </tt><p>
<tt>Some 2.6 million Moslems are believed to have legally migrated to Europe in
the past five yeas, and the Barcelona summit aims at stabilizing Algeria,
Tunisia and Morocco to prevent more migration.  However, Spain is building with
EU assistance a $25 million road and fence between its Cueta enclave in North
Africa and Morocco, and requiring the 2,000 Moroccans who commute to Gibraltar
to obtain visas if they wish to leave Gibraltar for Spain.  Cueta is a
seven-square mile Spanish city of 75,000 in North Africa.  Africans trying to
reach Europe rioted in October 1995 to protest Spain's refusal to move them to
Spain.<b>  </b></tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC11">Germany</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>:
Bosnians, Illegals, and Immigration</a></a></a></a></a> 
</a></h2>
<tt>The Bosnia peace plan signed in mid-December in Paris has turned the
spotlight on the 350,000 Bosnians living in Germany as "tolerated" (geduldet)
foreigners who can stay in Germany at least through March 31, 1996, but not
earn the right to live there.  In addition, there are 350,000 Bosnians living
in other European countries, 820,000 in other ex-Yugoslavia states, and 1.3
million displaced within Bosnia.</tt><p>
<tt>Under the peace plan, the Bosnians in Europe will be the last to be
returned to Bosnia, and some wonder if they will be willing to return.  The
Bosnians scattered around Germany live rent-free in accommodations provided by
local authorities-- a family of four receives about $250 per week for food etc.
Many complain of boredom, but note that conditions in Bosnia remain
uncertain.</tt><p>
<tt>Between 35,000 and 30,000 Bosnian refugees live in Berlin.  Berlin spends
about US $333 million per year on them. </tt><p>
<tt>One refugee couple -- the woman is Croatian and the husband is Serbian
--<b> </b>announced that they plan to divorce and marry German partners<b>
</b>if they are threatened with expulsion from Germany. </tt><p>
<tt>On November 23, 1995, the German foreigners' commissioner, Cornelia
Schmalz-Jacobsen, released her second 150-page report on the status of
foreigners in Germany with the observation that German policies toward
foreigners are changing for the better.  As evidence, the report notes that
some foreigners now have the RIGHT to German citizenship
(Einb&uuml;rgerungsanspr&uuml;che)--meaning that the burden of denying some
foreigners German citizenship falls on the government.  </tt><p>
<tt>The report advocates further liberalization, "so that long-term 'foreign'
residents become part of German society."  The report uses the word migrant
rather than foreigner.</tt><p>
<tt>There are about seven million foreigners or migrants in Germany (the number
rose by about 100,000 in 1994, largely as a result of about 113,000 births to
foreigners in Germany) including two million Turks, 1.3 million nationals of
the ex-Yugoslavia, 572,000 Italians, 356,000 Greeks, and 263,000 Poles.  In
addition there were 1.75 million registered war refugees and asylum-seekers in
Germany at the end of 1994.</tt><p>
<tt>In Germany, cities such as Munich have begun a debate over further
restrictions on foreigners in public housing.  Under current procedures,
foreigners can be a maximum<b> </b>of 20 percent of the residents of local
public housing, a percentage that may be lowered.  Almost one fourth of
Munich's 1.6 million residents are foreigners, many of whom have formed
associations.  For example, there are believed to be over 3,000 associations
for Turks living in Germany.</tt><p>
<tt>About nine percent of the 2.5 million foreigners in the German labor force
were self-employed in 1992.  Thus about the same percentage of foreigners and
Germans are self employed.  About 17 percent of the 222,000 foreigners who were
self-employed were Italians, followed by 14 percent Turks, and 10 percent
Greeks.  About 25 percent of the foreigners' businesses were hotels and
restaurants, followed by 20 percent in manufacturing, and 14 percent in
retailing.</tt><p>
<tt>About 2.1 million foreigners were German wage and salary workers in 1994.
The unemployment rate for foreign workers was 17 percent in 1994, versus nine
percent for Germans.</tt><p>
<tt>Most of the Schmalz-Jacobsen report is devoted to the status of foreigners
in Germany.  More than half of the 20- to 30-year old foreign women in Germany,
and almost half of the young men, do not have a secondary school leaving
certificate, which in Germany usually includes certification that the school
leaver has learned one of 435 occupations.  The major reasons for these
education deficiencies include lack of the German language and family
circumstances that fail to emphasize the importance of education.</tt><p>
<tt>Schmalz-Jacobsen notes that foreigners cannot apply for many public sector
jobs, and that they are entitled to less priority for scarce higher education
slots than German citizens.  The report ends with recommendations for steps to
promote the integration of migrants in Germany.</tt><p>
<tt>The weekly news magazine Der Spiegel carried a cover story on illegal
immigration and employment in Germany in December.  According to the article,
about 100,000 aliens illegally enter and stay in Germany each year, despite an
increase in the number of German border guards from 2,000 in 1993 to 5,300 in
1995.  Day labor markets are evolving in major cities such as Frankfurt and
Berlin, where illegal workers seek child care, construction, and service
jobs.</tt><p>
<tt>Germany's labor ministry is responsible for preventing illegal workers from
getting jobs in Germany, and it enforces laws against the employment of illegal
alien workers, as well as against German workers unlawfully drawing
unemployment insurance or other aid while working for cash, by comparing
payroll tax and employment data, by checking foreign worker employment data
against a central register of data on foreigners, and by visiting construction
and similar workplaces and apprehending workers who run away, or inspecting the
work papers of those at work.  </tt><p>
<tt>There are 44 special labor offices with some 1,000 inspectors that
concentrate on illegal employment, plus another 500 inspectors available if
needed.</tt><p>
<tt>In Germany, workers receive an<b> </b>identification card showing the
insurance number that each person is required to have to be employed.  They
must show the ID to their employer when they begin to work, and the employer
must report the number to the local labor office within three days.  In some
industries, such as construction, janitorial services, and restaurants, workers
must carry their ID cards with them at work.  Workers must leave their ID cards
at the labor office while drawing unemployment insurance benefits--and check in
at the labor office frequently to prove that their availability for
work.</tt><p>
<tt>There were about 78,000 inspections for illegal foreign workers in 1994,
which resulted in 42,000 closed cases in which fines of an average of 550 DM
were levied on employers.  In 5,300 cases, criminal penalties were imposed.<b>
</b></tt><p>
<tt><b></b>The number of inspections was about 75,000 in 1993, 37,000 cases
were closed, and fines averaging 405 DM were levied---in 5,900 cases, criminal
penalties were levied.  Between 80 and 90 percent of the inspections and fines
are in the former West Germany.  Violations are most common in construction,
janitorial services, restaurants, agriculture, and food processing--inspectors
noted an increased number of cases in manufacturing, especially metal
processing.</tt><p>
<tt>In addition to employing illegal alien workers, German employers can be
fined for unlawfully lending their foreign workers to other employers--the
foreigners are to work in the job in which they were certified to come to
Germany.  In 1994, there were 5,800 inspections for unlawfully lending foreign
workers between German employers (illegale Arbeitnehmerueberlassung), versus
5,100 in 1993, and 3,100 closed cases (2,900 in 1993), and 370 criminal
penalties assessed (190).  Fines are much higher for transferring foreign
workers to another employer than simply employing unauthorized workers<b>
</b>--a total of<b> </b>23 million DM in 1994,<b> </b>and 21 million DM in
1993.</tt><p>
<tt>In October 1995, German authorities inspected the attendants in over 500
public toilets along highways and in department stores, and found that
virtually all were illegal aliens who had paid 500 DM each for the right to
work in the toilets for tips.  The firm that placed them is disputing a charge
that it knowingly employed illegal aliens--it maintains that the attendants are
independent contractors.</tt><p>
<tt>Germany invests more to restrict immigration than many other countries in
part because its relatively inflexible labor markets permit foreign workers to
depress German wages--Germans who do not move away from immigrant areas wind up
competing with immigrants for jobs. <b> </b>According to some estimates, a one
percent increase in the number of foreigners reduces unskilled and semi-skilled
workers' wages by six percent.  In November 1995, there were about 3.6 million
unemployed workers in Germany, for an unemployment rate of 9.3 percent.</tt><p>
<tt>There continues to be a debate in Germany over whether the country needs an
immigration system modeled on either the US or Canadian systems<b>.  </b>Most
social scientists recommend that Germany adopt an immigration system that would
admit a certain number of foreigners each year, and that labor certification or
a point system be used to determine priority to enter Germany as an
economically-useful immigrant.</tt><p>
<tt>According to Der Spiegel, about 100,000 family unification immigrants
arrive in Germany each year.  Spiegel seems to agree with those who argue that
Germany should follow the US and try to reduce illegal immigration by
establishing an annual<b> </b>ceiling on legal immigration--in this way, it is
argued, currently illegal aliens would wait for their turn to immigrate
legally.<b></b></tt><p>
<tt><b></b>Germany's foreign population increases by another 100,000 each year
through births to foreign permanent residents.  Adding slots for the entry of
permanent immigrants selected by German employers or on the basis of points
would presumably increase immigration, since family unification would
continue.</tt><p>
<tt>German academics have designed immigration systems that they believe will
raise German incomes and reduce unemployment.  For example, a proposal to use
unemployment rates, job vacancies, and wage increases to establish an annual
immigration quota would, according to one proposal, give extra points to, or
permit employers to obtain immigrants, in banking and insurance, research, and
machinery, but not construction.  In cases where there is both high
unemployment and job vacancies, and the work is unskilled, such as agriculture,
practical nursing, and restaurants, some academics propose a Swiss-style
rotational guest worker program.<b></b></tt><p>
<tt><b></b>Many Germans believe that they are recommending a US-style
immigration system.  However, the US selects only about 15 percent of its
immigrants (including their families) on economic grounds.  The US has
considered and rejected a Canadian-style point system, and the US program
adopted in 1990 to permit the immigration of persons investing money and
creating US jobs is widely considered a failure--very few foreigners with money
find it attractive.</tt><p>
<tt>The arrival of 225,000 so-called ethnic German Aussiedler each year from
the ex-USSR does not add to the foreign population because these newcomers
receive German passports upon their arrival.  There are about four million
ethnic Germans in eastern Europe and the ex-USSR, and two million have already
migrated to Germany.  Some 90,000 ethnic Germans have already completed the
paperwork that permits them to move to Germany, but have not yet done
so.</tt><p>
<tt>Representatives of over 3,000 Turkish groups and organizations met on
December 2 in Hamburg to establish an umbrella organization to promote the
interests of Germany's 2.1 million Turkish residents.  The non-partisan
organization, called TGD, wants to secure civic equality for all Turks living
in Germany.  One of the key changes the organization wants is dual citizenship,
though that is not wanted uniformly by all Turks in Germany. </tt><p>
<tt>All the debates<b> </b>in Turkey over the future of that country are
mirrored among Turks in Germany, especially over the role that Islam should
play in daily life.<b>  </b>For example, in Germany there are less expensive
burial sites, in which remains are plowed over after 15 years, and the space
reused for new burials.  Turks who selected this burial option for relatives
have sued Cologne to argue that Islam prohibits disturbing the remains of the
dead.</tt><p>
<tt>At the end of November 1995, the German Bundestag approved a resolution
that would permit the government to require 150,000 foreign construction
workers, many from other EU nations, to be paid at least the German minimum
construction wage from their first day of work in Germany (MN, December, 1995).
This two-year attempt to prevent "wage dumping" may not go into effect,
however, because non-union German employers must first negotiate minimum wages
with relevant unions, and then this minimum wage could be made binding
throughout the construction industry.</tt><p>

<tt>On December 19 the French government announced another delay of several
months in opening its borders under the Schengen accord.  France continues to
insist that it must maintain strict border controls because of terrorist
attacks.  Another sticking point is the availability of drugs in its northern
neighbor, the Netherlands. </tt><p>
<tt>The French government pledged to give labor inspectors and customs
officials more powers to report migrant smuggling.  The government acted in
response to complaints of unfair competition from small businesses, and to
avoid the loss of social security and other payroll taxes.</tt><p>
<tt>French public sector employees struck to protest plans to reduce their
wages and benefits in late November and early December<b>.  </b>The French
government needs to reduce government expenditure to meet the Maastricht
requirements for a single currency.  Hence the plan to cut $55 billion over two
years.</tt><p>
<tt>The single largest savings would come from reducing state expenditures for
health care.  Other savings are expected from reorganizing the money-losing
railroads, from raising the retirement age for government employees from 60 to
65, and requiring 40 rather than 37 years of service to get the maximum
pension.  The 1.5 million students in 79 state-supported universities are
protesting plans to only modestly expand funding for higher education.</tt><p>
<tt>Unemployment in France is running at 11.5 percent. </tt><p>
<tt>In a trade-union vote by policemen in France, the extreme-right union
affiliated with Jean-Marie Le Pen won 13.4 percent.  A left-wing publication
interpreted the vote as meaning that there is now a one in eight chance of
being stopped for an identity check by an extreme-right policeman. </tt><p>
<tt>Citizens of the French port city of Toulon are reportedly pleased with the
results of the June election, which elected a National Front mayor.  Toulon has
a population of 170,000, and an unemployment rate of nearly 20 percent. May Le
Chevallier says that national preference is a logical thing so that "French

<tt>On December 13, the European Parliament approved by a vote of 343-143 a
free-trade union with Turkey that begins to reduce trade barriers on January 1,
1996, brushing aside concerns about Turkey's human rights record.  Turkish
President Suleyman Demirel said that it was an historic day for Turkey, and
that the country has "now entered a phase of much closer links with Europe."
</tt><p>
<tt>Under the terms of the 1963 Association Agreement between the EEC and
Turkey, Turks were to have freedom of movement with the EEC by 1976.  This
so-called Ankara Agreement was never fully implemented, but under the agreement
and subsequent protocols, Turks have preference over other "third-country
nationals" in gaining admission to EU nations to fill vacant jobs.</tt><p>
<tt>In 1973, an "additional protocol" was signed between the EU and Turkey that
planned for a customs union by 1995.  In March 1995, the EU and Turkey agreed
to a customs union effective January 1, 1996, if the EU Parliament approved.
Turkey modified its anti-terrorism law in October 1995 to permit some persons
jailed for "incitement" to be freed, paving the way for EU approval.  </tt><p>
<tt>Under the free-trade agreement, tariffs that average 14 percent on $20
billion in trade between Turkey and the EU will be eliminated; Turkey will
forego about $1.5 billion in tariff income, but it hopes to gain far more in EU
investment.</tt><p>
<tt>On December 24, Turkey held general elections in which the fundamentalist
Welfare Party (Refah) did better than expected, gaining 158 seats in the 550
member Parliament with 21 percent of the vote.  The Welfare Party promised
cheap bread, and delivered on its promises after winning municipal elections in
Ankara, Istanbul, and 22 other cities in 1994.</tt><p>
<tt>Turkey bills itself as a secular Moslem state, a stable friend of the West
in an unstable but strategic region.  However, its economy has faltered, with
inflation running at 80 percent, interest rates are 100 percent, and
unemployment is at least 20 percent.</tt><p>
<tt>Turkey on June 12 began to permit Turks who lose their Turkish nationality
by becoming a citizen of another country to retain their rights to property and
inheritance in Turkey.  However, Turkish youth living abroad are at age 18
obliged to perform 18 months of military service in Turkey, or pay DM10,000
($7,000) and have their service obligation in Turkey reduced to two months.
Turks who fail to perform military service or pay do not get their Turkish
passports renewed.</tt><p>
<tt>A report released by the Turk-Metal union finds that thousands of Kurds who
migrated to western Turkey have developed a radical brand of Kurdish
nationalism due to disillusionment.  The survey compared Kurds in the 10
southeastern provinces under emergency rule with those who lived in the six
western provinces, where many Kurds have gone to escape the effects of unrest.
</tt><p>
<tt>The report found that more than 20 percent of the Kurds living in western
Turkey said they accepted Turkish nationality for lack of choice; many wanted
more ethnic freedom.  Most Kurds living in the southeast wanted to remain part
of one nation.  The survey found that most Kurds leaving the southeast are
seeking employment and investment opportunities, rather than escaping the
security problems. </tt><p>

<tt>According to the Latvian president, he plans to sign the Geneva Convention
on the Rights of Refugees.  The president is also prepared to sign agreements
with Russia and Belorussia to return asylum seekers who transit through those
countries.</tt><p>
<tt>In a meeting with the Swedish prime minister in October, the Latvian
president asked other European nations to help fund the building of a camp for
asylum seekers.  The camp would cost an estimated $1.5 million.</tt><p>
<tt>Latvia is considering legislation that would impose up to 10-year jail
terms, plus confiscation of  any vehicles used, on persons caught smuggling
aliens into the country.</tt><p>
<tt>In March, a "train of despair," carried 100 Kurds  between Latvia,
Lithuania, and Russia for several weeks as each country rejected the Kurdish
asylum seekers from Afghanistan, Iraq, and Iran --half of whom were
children--and argued that they were the responsibility of the other.  In early
April, the refugees were moved to the prison building in a small town near
Riga, Latvia.  They have remained there for the past nine months, waiting for
Russia to agree to accept their return. </tt><p>
<tt>The Kurds, most of whom had paid $2,500 each to be smuggled to Sweden, were
on a ship that ran aground in Estonia, from which they were returned to Latvia.
Sweden, according to Latvia, announced that it would help Latvia to deport the
Kurds to Russia.  About 50 Middle Eastern asylum-seekers a month, or 10
boatloads a year, are smuggled into Sweden via the Baltic states.</tt><p>
<tt>Latvia is being criticized by Russia for its response to the suicide of a
Russian citizen in a Latvian town in July, 1995.  The Russian, who was unable
to obtain a residence permit, immolated himself to protest his impending
deportation. </tt><p>
<tt>Lithuania is continuing to try to set up mechanisms to deal with illegal
immigration.  Under pressure for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees and
Scandinavian governments, Lithuania promised to convert a former Soviet
military base into a detention center for asylum seekers, instead of forcing
them to depend upon the benevolence of the local people.  Lithuania hopes to
get financial support from Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Finland.  </tt><p>
<tt>Lithuania's Border Protection Service welcomed Russia's offers to provide
equipment to police the borders of the Baltic states.  The Commission of Border
Services hopes that the strengthened border guard will stem the flow of illegal
immigrants who travel through Lithuania on their way to the West. </tt><p>

<tt>A report on National Public Radio explored how the North Korean government
has been running about a dozen Siberian labor camps for the past 20 years.  The
camps have North Korean workers who provide cheap labor to log the birch and
pine forests in Siberia.  Moscow and North Korea then divide the profits from
the sale of the logs to countries like Japan.  </tt><p>
<tt>There were widespread claims of abuse after the labor camps became well
known following the collapse of the Soviet Union.  The North Korean workers are
now guaranteed protection under Russian labor laws, but there are reports that
worker abuse continues.  Many North Koreans are running away from the camps to
look for jobs because of food and equipment shortages.</tt><p>
<tt>Some Chinese and Korean migrant workers reportedly accept low wages while
working seasonally in Siberia in exchange for the ability to take home wild
ginseng for longevity potions and tiger bones and reindeer antlers for
aphrodisiacs.</tt><p>
<tt>The year-long Operation Foreigner, which cracked down on illegal
immigration in Russia's Maritime Territory, came to an end in late October,
1995.  Over 10,00 Chinese were returned to their homeland during the operation.
The operation also stopped attempts by Vietnamese and North Koreans to smuggle
out of Russia rare animals and plants. </tt><p>
<tt>According to the Russian government, some 40 million of Russia's 148
million residents have below poverty level incomes of less than $68 per month.

<tt>Jorg Haider's Freedom Party won 22 percent of the vote in Austria's
December 17, 1995 election, down from 23 percent in 1994.  Haider, who opposes
immigration, is considered the most successful far-right politician in
Europe.</tt><p>
<tt>During the campaign, Haider asserted that "Immigration cannot be continued
in our country."  At a rally he added that "We must adopt the principle
'Austria First' if we don't want to disappear slowly in a land full of
foreigners." Haider's Freedom Party issued its own "Contract with Austria,"
which pledged to cut taxes and budget deficits, fight crime, reduce the size of
government, and prevent Austria from becoming an immigration country.  Austrian
pundits compare him to Newt Gingrich.</tt><p>
<tt>The neighboring Czech Republic has come under fire for using strict
citizenship laws to prevent some of the 200,000 gypsies from becoming Czech
citizens.  After the breakup of Czechoslovakia in January, 1993, the Czech
Republic enacted some of Europe's toughest citizenship laws, requiring new
citizens, for example, to renounce their old citizenship, to prove that they
have a record clean of any criminal acts for five years, and to pay relatively
high fees.</tt><p>
<tt>Some 360,000 Slovaks have become Czech citizens since 1993, but most are
non-Gypsies.  The Council of Europe, founded in 1949, calls Czech efforts to
deny citizenship to Gypsies the "largest denationalization" since World War
II.</tt><p>
<tt>Neighboring Slovakia, in turn, is accused of using a vague language law to
restrict the rights of ethnic Hungarians, who are about 11 percent of the
population.</tt><p>

<tt>Many commentators expect Asia's rapid economic growth to be threatened by
too few professional and skilled workers.  Instead of deriving comparative
advantage from large numbers of cheap unskilled workers, as they have for the
past two decades, many commentators urge Asian nations to upgrade their
educational systems to produce more professionals, scientists, and
engineers.</tt><p>
<tt>For example, Hong Kong has an historically high unemployment rate--3.5
percent--and, simultaneously, large numbers of vacancies for skilled and
professional workers.  At the same time, professionals such as accountants,
nurses, and computer programmers from India to the Philippines cannot find jobs
that use these skills in their own countries.</tt><p>
<tt>Even countries attracting large amounts of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)
suffer from shortages of skilled and professional workers.  In Indonesia, for
example, about half of the university graduates entering the job market each
year are unemployed, but foreign investors complain that they cannot find local
supervisors and mid-level managers.  Foreign investors have similar complaints
in China, Malaysia, and Thailand about shortages of skilled workers and
technicians.</tt><p>
<tt>Many governments concerned about foreign workers and wanting to maintain
rapid economic growth agree that "the higher-end manufacturing base envisaged
by government planners will not materialize unless local education and training
systems are able to provide the sort of  skilled workers  required by potential
foreign investors."</tt><p>
<tt>However, in the US and Australia, countries that accept large numbers of
permanent and temporary foreigners on the basis of their skills, there is a
growing belief that easy access to foreigners discourages local workers from
training for occupations that have a significant number of foreign
workers.</tt><p>
<tt><b>Singapore</b>. Singapore Economic Development Board began to send
missions abroad in 1991 to recruit new graduates for jobs in Singapore.<b> </b>
The missions permit local companies to screen candidates in India, the US, and
Australia for professional jobs in computer science and engineering.  In 1994,
about 500 jobs were offered to foreign professionals--40 percent Indians and
Sri Lankans--and 40 percent in computer science and engineering.</tt><p>
<tt>There are over 100,000 mostly unskilled Malaysian workers in Singapore, but
a decision of the Singaporean government to exempt after August 1, 1995 foreign
workers and their employers from contributing about 20 percent each of their
gross pay to the Central Provident Fund (CPF) was expected to attract
additional skilled and professional workers to Singapore.  The 300,000 work
permit holders whose employers are required to pay the Foreign Workers' Levy
were exempt from CPF contributions.</tt><p>
<tt>Under Singapore's levy system, employers pay a levy of S$200 (US $150) per
skilled worker each month instead of S$440 for unskilled workers.</tt><p>
<tt><b>Malaysia</b>. <b> </b>Malaysia established a Human Resources Development
Fund (HRDF) in 1992 to promote the training of skilled workers, with highest
priority for the printing, plastics, steel and iron, electronic and electrical,
and textile industries.  The Fund makes grants to firms that establish training
facilities, and rebates up to 20 percent of the firms' contributions to the
HRDF if the firm establishes training facilities at its production site.</tt><p>
<tt><b>Japan.</b>  The number of foreigners employed in Japan has decreased by
about three percent since 1993, but the number of foreigners employed as
engineers and managers increased about 15 percent.  Many Japanese firms are
hiring foreigners as permanent workers, hoping they will become candidates for
jobs in overseas offices.<b></b></tt><p>
<tt><b>Outside Asia</b>.  The US, Canada, and Australia have programs through
which professionals and skilled foreigners can enter as temporary or permanent
immigrants.  In all three countries, these immigration systems are coming under
attack.</tt><p>
<tt>In Australia, unions in April 1995 complained that the government was
permitting the entry of 30 British tool makers for 18 to 24 months despite high
unemployment.  Australia uses a point system to select permanent immigrants on
the basis of their skills, and the 1993-94 intake included 445 doctors, 324
civil engineers, 537 secondary school teachers, 210 lawyers, 149 economists and
114 architects, as well as 652 accountants, 830 computing professionals, 543
nurses, 288 carpenters and 366 vehicle mechanics.</tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC19">Thailand:
Immigra</a></a></a>tion Controls Not Working</a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt>The Thai government has requested recommendations from the Thailand
Development and Research Institute and the National Economic and Social
Development Board on ways to reduce illegal immigration.  New policies to curb
illegal immigration are expected to be implemented by June, 1996. </tt><p>
<tt>The Thai government has been frustrated because current immigration
controls such as fines and deportation have not worked.  A majority of the
illegal immigrants are Burmese, who have not been stopped by a requirement to
have work permits.  An estimated 100,000 Burmese have fled the unrest in their
own country over the past two years and have settled in Thailand's border
areas.  A total of 500,000 Burmese are believed live in Thailand.</tt><p>
<tt>To retaliate against the Burmese who have left for Thailand, the Democratic
Karen Buddhist Army has been encroaching into Thailand to harass Burmese in
refugee camps.  According to reports, the Thai guards, who are sometimes warned
of an impending attack, view the raids as an internal problem between the two
Karen groups and ignore their intrusion onto Thai soil. </tt><p>
<tt>There has been little coordination between the various Thai ministries to
agree upon a government policy toward Burma.  Therefore, there is no firm
policy about security at the refugee camps.  The guards at the camps do not
have the authority to retaliate against the attacks, and even if they did, they
are not equipped to halt the attacks.  Thai officials have dissuaded relief
workers from helping the Karen refugees because the government says it wants to
send the Karens back as soon as possible.</tt><p>
<tt>The UN has been unable to assist the Karens in the camps because the Thai
government has termed them "displaced" persons rather than refugees. </tt><p>
<tt>One reason there has been a reluctance to establish a firm policy is
because the illegal foreign workers are considered a benefit to Thailand-- they
fill vacant unskilled and semi-skilled jobs at low wages. </tt><p>

Refugee Resettlement</a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt>The US in December made another effort to return the 37,000 Vietnamese
still languishing in camps in Asia to Vietnam, despite plans by one US
Congressman to deny US funds to the UN help resettle the boat people in
Vietnam.  The last Vietnamese were expected to be home be the end of 1995, but
only 5,000 were returned in 1995, versus 12,500 in 1994.</tt><p>
<tt>Under the US plan, Vietnamese in the camps would be taken to Ho Chi Minh
City by the UN, and interviewed as they returned to Vietnam by US immigration
officials.  If the "several thousand" among the returning Vietnamese can prove
that they worked with the US during the war, and can qualify as political
refugees, they could come to the US.  Most of the other Vietnamese would be
expected to resettle in Vietnam.</tt><p>
<tt>The UN planned to empty Vietnamese from the camps in 1995, but Vietnamese
in the camps refused to return after US House approved $30 million to bring
Vietnamese in the camps to the US.  The legislation was not approved by
Congress, but many of the 20,000 Vietnamese in Hong Kong believe that China's
1997 takeover will force the US to accept them.  Many Hong Kong residents
believe the Vietnamese should return; the UNHCR owes Hong Kong $130 million for
costs it incurred to house the Vietnamese.</tt><p>
<tt>Many of the refugees do not want to be returned to Vietnam and some
Republican legislators are reluctant to send them forcibly back to Vietnam.  A
Republican amendment attached to the federal budget bill would prohibit the
forced repatriation of economic migrants, and would block US payments to UNHCR
if UNHCR continues forced repatriations.  </tt><p>
<tt>Thailand, Vietnam and UNHCR signed a memorandum of understanding to
repatriate the last 5,000 Vietnamese refugees in Thailand by the middle of
1996. </tt><p>
<tt>Vietnam has asked for more time to repatriate the remaining 2,600
Vietnamese refugees in the Philippines.  The delay is partly due to the budget
impasse in the US Congress, because the US agreed to help pay for the refugees
return.  The UNHCR has said it will not fund the refugee camp in the
Philippines past December 31, 1995, so the Philippine government has said it
will pay for the cost of housing and feeding the Vietnamese refugees.  UNHCR
wanted to move the refugees to a UN center in Vietnam until the repatriation
agreement had been signed. </tt><p>
<tt>On December 12, the Australian government deported 68 Sino-Vietnamese
asylum seekers.  The 68 asylum-seekers were from a group of about 900 who
arrived in Australia from the Beihai region of China late last year.  Under an
agreement between Australia and China, Sino-Vietnamese refugees who had been
resettled in China are not permitted to apply for refugee status in another
country. </tt><p>

<tt>The Pacific Business Forum, 36 representatives from large and small to
medium-sized business from each of APEC's<b> </b>18-member countries,
recommended that APEC nations simplify procedures for obtaining business
residency visas by 1996 and implement visa-free travel throughout the region by
1999.</tt><p>
<tt>However, Australia reported in December that 4,000 of the 5.8 million
foreigners seeking to enter the country were turned back because they had
forged documents.  Some Asians reportedly pay up to $5,000 each to buy papers
that say they are managers or accountants, travel to Australia for business
reasons, work as factory workers and, if apprehended, apply for asylum.  There
are an estimated 75,000 illegal aliens in Australia, mostly British and
Chinese.</tt><p>
<tt>APEC, established in 1989, includes 18 nations that produced over half of
the world's $24 trillion GDP in 1993, with the US and Japan accounting for
almost 80 percent of APEC's economic output.  There are enormous differences in
per capita incomes between APEC member nations--per capita GDP ranged from
$34,000 in Japan in 1993 to $450 in China.</tt><p>
<tt>APEC member nations account for almost half of global trade, worth $7.4
trillion in 1993.  The November 1995 APEC summit in Osaka, Japan was supposed
to take steps to implement free trade among the richer APEC members by the year
2010, and free trade among all APEC members by 2020. </tt><p>
<tt>ASEAN, established in 1967, includes Brunei, Indonesia, the Philippines,
Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam--Burma, Cambodia and Laos are
expected to join by the year 2000.  In 1992, these nations agreed to establish
a free trade zone--AFTA-- by the year 2000 which would include 450 million
people.</tt><p>
<tt>One International Labour Office estimate puts the number of migrant workers
employed outside their country of citizenship worldwide at 25 million,
including 13 million in Asia.</tt><p>
<tt>A recent study by the University of Indonesia found that 19 percent of
foreign workers in Indonesia were South Koreans, followed by Japanese, 15
percent; and Taiwanese, nine percent.  </tt><p>
<tt>UNCTAD--the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development-- reported
in mid-December that foreign direct investment (FDI) topped $235 billion in
1995--including 37 percent or $87 billion to LDCs-- the worldwide stock of FDI
is now $2.5 trillion.  The US is the major overseas investor, investing $46
billion abroad in 1994, and receiving $49 billion in FDI from other countries
in 1994.  </tt><p>
<tt>Japan and Germany combined invested only $39 billion abroad in 1994.  Japan
was the number one overseas investor between 1986 and 1991, with a peak
overseas investment of $48 billion in 1990, but the US has been the leading
overseas investor since 1991.</tt><p>
<tt>Most FDI comes from the world's 40,000 multinationals, most of which are
based in industrial countries, and invest in other industrial nations.  China
received $27 billion in FDI in 1994, and FDI in LDCs is expected to top $90
billion in 1995.  However, LDCs invested $33 billion abroad in 1994, and
Mexico's Cemex, with $3.6 billion invested abroad, is the developing world's
largest foreign investor.  </tt><p>
<tt>The world's 40,000 multinationals account for about two-thirds of all world
trade, and half of multinational trade is between affiliates of the same
multinational. There are 40,000 multinationals, and they have 250,00 foreign
affiliates with sales of $5.2 trillion in 1994.</tt><p>

Foreigners Employment</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt>China is developing legislation to regulate the employment of foreigners in
the country.  The current Law of the People's Republic of China on Entry and
Exit of Aliens has only general principles, so that it is implemented
differently by local authorities.  </tt><p>
<tt>According to Chinese authorities, the government must "exclude foreigners
entering China in search of high salaries and a low cost of living."  Unskilled
foreigners seeking to work will be denied work permits.  One official said
that, "With China's opening up and rapid development, more and more aliens are
coming to this ancient country, attracted by its long history, profound culture
and relatively more employment opportunities and better pay."</tt><p>
<tt>There are about 70,000 foreigners employed in China, and 80 percent of the
30,000 foreigners who work in China for more than one year are employed by
foreign-funded enterprises.</tt><p>
<tt>The crackdown is due in part to an clash that occurred when a wealthy
villager in Shenzhen rode his motorcycle through a blockade onto a road which
had just been tarred by migrant workers.  A melee began when the villager
called police--in the ensuing violence, 11 workers were killed by paramilitary
troops with submachine guns.  </tt><p>
<tt>Shenzhen is a special economic zone in Guangdong province, which borders
Hong Kong's New Territories, that relies on cheap migrant labor to attract
foreign investment.  The migrant workers were mostly from the poor provinces of
Hunan and Hubei.  According to a public security official, 80 to 90 percent of
all crimes in Guangdong province were committed by migrants. </tt><p>
<tt>South of Beijing, the army began a crackdown on migrants by razing a ghetto
of 100,000 peasants who had ventured there from the southern province of
Shejuang over the past 10 years.  Zheijiang "village" was the capital's main
shoe and garment making district.  The village also ran its own clinics,
schools, recreation halls, shops and had its own police.  The army claimed that
the ghetto was a slum that harbored criminals.</tt><p>
<tt>According to the Chinese official media, the army is prepared to raze
another 18 migrant villages around Beijing.  The villages are home to about
three million people, about one-fourth of the capital's population.  The cities
of Shanghai and Canton (Guangzhou) are also expected to raze migrant ghettos.

<tt>One Chinese city, Xiamen is honoring ten outstanding youths from among the
city's 300,000 migrant workers.  The honors are a first for China.  The winners
of the competition will get long-term contracts and become permanent city
residents. </tt><p>
<tt>China's population policy is reportedly threatened by its growing migrant
population.  Chinese officials say that migrancy makes it difficult to carry
out family planning.  Experts estimate that about two-thirds of the unplanned
births are in transient families.  </tt><p>
<tt>China's 250 million urban residents are required to obtain permission from
neighborhood officials before having a child.  Those who have children without
permission cannot get a household registration and welfare benefits.</tt><p>
<tt>In central China's Henan province, local government officials have reduced
the number of births among the migrants by requiring them to produce "family
planning certificates" before applying for transient identification cards or
business licenses.  Currently, about 85 percent of the migrant workers in Henan
have the certificates. </tt><p>

<tt>On December 15, the Japanese Supreme Court upheld the law that requires
foreigners living legally in Japan to be fingerprinted.  The fingerprinting
requirement has long been seen as a symbol of discrimination against
foreigners, since it suggests a similarity with criminals. The Japanese Supreme
Court ruled that since the procedure involved only one finger, it "should not
cause excessive psychological or physical pain." </tt><p>
<tt>There were about 94,000 foreigners working legally in Japan in 1994, down
about 3,000 from 1993.  About 60 percent of these legal foreign workers are not
managers and professionals, and their number declined by 10 percent.</tt><p>
<tt>An article in the Fresno Bee compares the work done by illegal foreign
workers in Japan with California.  In both places, illegal foreign workers are
hired primarily in jobs natives do not want.  In California, it is work in
agriculture or factories, and in Japan it is in construction or machinery
plants.  The primary difference is that in California the foreign workers do
not stand out the way they do in homogenous Japan, where national identity if
paramount.   </tt><p>
