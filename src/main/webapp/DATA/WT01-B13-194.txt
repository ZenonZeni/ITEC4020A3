<H3>KEMPER FUNDS FORMS NEW DISTRIBUTION UNIT FOR FEE-BASED ADVISERS AND MUTUAL FUND WRAP PROGRAMS</H3>

<B>CHICAGO</B> (Mar. 20) -- Kemper Funds management today announced the formation 
of a new distribution unit to focus on the growing fee-based adviser and mutual fund wrap 
marketplace.
<P>

"While we are fully committed to selling our funds through the traditional channels 
of distribution, we recognize the increasingly important role of registered investment 
advisers and fee-based programs," said Jim Greenawalt, executive vice president, director of 
sales for Kemper Distributors, Inc., the principal underwriter and distributor for the 
Kemper Funds.  "We have always believed in and have stressed the importance of investors 
working with professional financial advisers when it comes to making their investment 
decisions.  And, as long as a customer is working directly with a financial adviser, we will be 
flexible with our pricing structure."
<P>

Kemper has hired John A. Norris as a first vice president to head up the new 
registered investment adviser unit.  Norris was previously a senior vice president at Cozad 
Asset Management, Inc.  He will seek to form strategic alliances with various fee-based 
mutual fund wrap programs.
<P>

"We expect to further strengthen our relationships with our key broker/dealer clients 
as they expand their fee-based activities," said Norris.
<P>

Zurich Kemper Investments, Inc. (ZKI), formerly Kemper Financial Services, Inc., is 
one of the largest investment managers headquartered in North America, having more than 
$79 billion in assets under management.  ZKI is the investment advisor to the 
<A HREF="../../funds/kemperfunds.html">Kemper Funds</A> and is part of Zurich Insurance Group, 
a global organization headquartered in Zurich, Switzerland that provides services in life and 
non-life insurance, reinsurance and asset management in more than 45 countries.
<P>

Kemper Funds consists of 61 open-end portfolios and seven closed-end funds.  It 
has nearly 3 million shareholder accounts and $45 billion in assets.  Kemper Distributors, 
Inc. (KDI), a subsidiary of ZKI, is the principal underwriter and distributor of the Kemper 
Funds.
