In a letter to the editors of <EM>Time</EM> magazine, CEC President Gerald Hime took issue with <EM>Time's</EM> November 4, 1996 article,  "The Struggle to Pay for Special Ed." (Bolston, pp. 82-83), disputing the story's assertion that special education is too expensive.<P>

The article cited an example of "community outrage" in rural South Dakota resulting from the cost of tuition and travel for a local student with autism.  The author stated that "the cause of the community outrage was the money for [the student's] special education comes, under the legal requirements of the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act, from the budget of the local school district." The article further pointed out that although federal and state laws have passed laws requiring special education for students with disabilities, Congress and the states "have been parsimonious with the money to pay the added costs" spawning "intense conflict between parents and school officials."<p>

Dear TIME Magazine Letters Editor:<P>

I was very disappointed to see TIME perpetuate the myth that special education is unaffordable (EDUCATION, Nov. 4).  You made it appear that special education is not only exorbitantly expensive but that local districts must bear the brunt of its cost. In fact, educating a child with special needs costs, on average, two and one-half times that of a general education student. Across the nation, states provide 56 percent of the funds for that cost; local sources provide 36 percent. But the real savings is that as a result of special education more students with disabilities are becoming productive, independent citizens than ever before--approximately 70 percent of students with disabilities are employed, and an ever increasing number are attending college and other post-secondary educational institutions. <P>
	It should also be noted that federal appropriations have lagged behind the levels set forth in the legislation guaranteeing a free, appropriate public education for students with disabilities. Though the federal contribution to special education was supposed to cover 40% of its costs, federal spending for these programs has hovered around 7%. Hopefully, the recent Congressional funding increase for special education (approximately $750 million) marks a commitment to fully fund the federal/state special education partnership.<P>
	The cost of providing public assistance to an individual who has not gained the skills necessary for employment equals approximately $36,000 a year, plus loss of productivity and tax revenue. Given these facts, the real question is Can America afford not to provide special education for its children?<P>

Sincerely,<P><P><P>
