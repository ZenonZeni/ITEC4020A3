<H3>Symptoms of Depression and Manic Depression</H3>
 
<P>The symptoms of Depressive Illness are highly recognizable, 
both to those affected and to those closest to them, once 
they are told what to look for. </P>
 
Here is a checklist of symptoms of Depressive illness: 
<UL> 
    <LI>Loss of energy and interest.  
    <LI>Diminished ability to enjoy oneself.  
    <LI>Decreased -- or increased -- sleeping or appetite.  
    <LI>Difficulty in concentrating; indecisiveness; slowed 
     or fuzzy thinking. 
    <LI>Exaggerated feelings of sadness, hopelessness, or 
     anxiety. 
 
    <LI>Feelings of worthlessness. 
 
    <LI >Recurring thoughts about death and
suicide. 
 </UL>
<P>If most of these symptoms last for two weeks or more, you 
probably have Depressive Illness. Sometimes depression 
alternates with "mania" and is called Manic-Depressive Illness. </P>
 
Manic Depression causes mood swings creating periods with 
the following symptoms: 
<UL> 
    <LI>A high energy level with decreased need for sleep. 
 
    <LI>Unwarranted or exaggerated belief in one's own ability. 
 
    <LI>Extreme irritability. 
 
    <LI>Rapid, unpredictable emotional change. 
 
    <LI>Impulsive, thoughtless activity, with a high risk of 
  damaging consequences (i.e., stock speculations, sudden 
  love affairs, etc.). 
 </UL>
<H3>Failure To Diagnose </H3>
 
<P>Studies have revealed that of those individuals who do 
eventually seek help, only a fraction seek out a specialist in 
the diagnosis and treatment of Depressive Illness.</P> 
 
<P>More and more nonspecialists are learning to diagnose and 
treat depression, but too often, when medication is needed, it 
is not prescribed or is prescribed ineffectively. We are doing 
our best to educate professionals in depression's proper diagnosis 
and medical treatment. </P>

<H3>Correct Diagnosis, Wrong Treatment </H3>
 
<P>When Depressive Illness is diagnosed, minor tranquilizers and 
sleeping pills are prescribed twice as often as the right 
medication; and even when the right medication is prescribed, 
dosages are frequently lower than those needed to achieve an 
adequate level of therapeutic benefit. 
</P>
