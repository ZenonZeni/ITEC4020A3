<I><B><FONT SIZE=5>We exploit unrealistic forecasts...</FONT></B></I>
<P>
Most investors emphasize a company's earnings growth prospects
when making investment decisions. When formulating their earnings
growth forecasts, these investors focus too much on past earnings
growth and are unrealistic in expecting current trends to persist.
Most investors don't recognize, for example, that more than 90%
of the companies in the top decile of earnings growth do not sustain
that growth in subsequent years. Even among companies with just
above-average earnings growth, 80% fail to sustain that growth!
These examples show how the powerful forces that drive competitive
economies greatly influence the prospects of individual companies.
<P>
At Barr Rosenberg Mutual Funds, our process is designed to temper
individual stock analysis with rigorous consideration of the broader
forces at work in competitive economies. Evidence from analyst
earnings forecasts indicates that these competitive forces are
underestimated by most professional analysts, creating errors
and inconsistencies in the way analysts and other investors value
companies. Our systems are designed to systematically search out
and exploit these inconsistencies.<BR>
<P>
<A NAME="OLE_LINK5"><I><B><FONT SIZE=5>We avoid the shortcuts
taken by other...</FONT></B></I></A>
<P>
The human mind cannot process the overwhelming amount of information
that is available on markets, industries and individual companies.
Research in behavioral science shows that when people try to make
important and timely decisions based on overwhelming amounts of
information, they often rely on decision shortcuts. Used incorrectly,
these decision shortcuts can lead to incorrect conclusions. These
decision shortcuts often lead investors to:
<UL>
<LI>Extrapolate recent trends too far into the future.
<LI>Rely too much on the experience of a particular company without
properly considering the experiences of all similar companies.
<LI>Ignore information that contradicts their existing beliefs.
<LI>Infer that simultaneous occurrences necessarily have a cause-and-effect
relationship.
</UL>
<P>
At Barr Rosenberg Mutual Funds, our expert systems do not take
these decision shortcuts. Our comprehensive approach to valuing
a company allows us to consider a change in any of the 200 fundamental
factors we evaluate in the complete context of all the other factors.
We will not fall prey to overweighting the one or two factors
that grab traditional investors attention at the moment.
<P>
<I><B><FONT SIZE=5>We build superior models...</FONT></B></I>
<P>
Research in many fields, including financial analysis, documents
an interesting phenomenon regarding expert decision making. If
you can quantify enough of the key variables that an expert looks
at in making a decision and do a good job of describing the analytical
steps the expert takes in forming a judgement, you can build a
model of the expert's decision process that will outperform the
expert. This counter-intuitive finding stems from the fact that
human experts often apply their judgments inconsistently. Even
if the model misses some details, these are more than offset by
the benefits of consistency. Investors often can't employ exactly
the same standards used in judging a stock today that were used
yesterday. The more details an expert has to consider, the more
likely it is that inconsistencies in judgment will arise.
<P>
At Barr Rosenberg Mutual Funds, we have put a great deal of effort
into developing innovative and systematic models of a financial
expert's reasoning. By consistently applying these models, our
investment process ensures the discipline necessary to make superior
decisions.
