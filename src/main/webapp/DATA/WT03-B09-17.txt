UNITED STATES:  AT&T, MCI MOVE INTO DBS

With 1996 only a few weeks old and Congress poised to vote on a major
telecom deregulation bill, the two largest US long-distance telephone
companies have signalled that direct-to-home satellite broadcasts will
be a major strategic focus of their effort to build direct links to
American consumers.  Mitch Shapiro reports.

The long-distance/DBS alliance-making began on 22 January, when AT&T
announced an agreement to market and distribute Hughes' DirecTv DBS
service and the associated reception gear.

A few days later, MCI Communications, the number-two long distance
company, submitted the winning bid in a government auction of DBS
orbital slots that had been reclaimed from a company the government had
decided had waited too long to launch its DBS service.

As part of its deal with Hughes, AT&T is acquiring 2.5 percent of
DirecTv for $137.5 million.  The agreement also gives AT&T options to
increase its stake up to 30% over five years, depending mainly on how
many new DirecTv subscribers it enrolls over specific time periods.

AT&T, which is in the process of spinning off its telecom equipment and
computer divisions, is expected to begin marketing DirecTv service to
its long-distance and credit card customers by this summer.  According
to Joseph P.  Nacchio, executive vice president of AT&T's consumer and
small-business division, the DirecTv investment "in one fell
swoop,..establishes AT&T with a national presence in entertainment."

Though AT&T customers will not get a price break on DBS service, AT&T
hopes to lower the upfront DBS cost hurdle by offering financing
through its AT&T Universal Card.  AT&T customers, which will order
service and equipment directly from AT&T, will also receive a single
bill that will include both DBS and long-distance phone charges.

MCI's winning auction bid of $682.5 million topped competing bids by
Tele-Communications, Inc., the nation's largest cable TV operator, and
Echostar Communications, a smaller company which recently launched its
first DBS satellite on a Chinese-built rocket.

Not surprisingly, the long-distance company is teaming with Rupert
Murdoch's News Corp.  in the DBS arena.  It earlier had agreed to
invest $2 billion in News Corp.

In the wake of the auction, the two companies announced plans to create
a jointly owned company that will offer information and entertainment
services to both consumers and businesses.

The moves into DBS by AT&T and MCI follow several years during which
the two companies considered possible alliances with cable or local
phone companies.  No agreements ever resulted from these discussions
and Sprint, their chief long distance rival, eventually formed a joint
venture with three of the nation's largest cable operators, TCI,
Comcast and Cox.

The AT&T investment in DirecTv was generally welcomed by financial
analysts as a means to gain quick access to an established direct-to-
home broadband delivery system.  In contrast, there was considerable
skepticism regarding the potential payback on an MCI-backed DBS
venture.

In addition to the nearly $700 million it spent on spectrum, MCI will
need to spend as much as one billion dollars to build and launch its
satellites.  It will also come late to the market, lagging DirecTv and
Primestar by at least a few years, and Echostar and Alphastar - a soon-
to-be launched medium-power DBS service - by more than a year.

While some analysts believe the AT&T investment will help DirecTv
attract large numbers of cable customers - something that has yet to
occur despite rapid early sales of DBS receivers - others remain
skeptical, citing the still-high cost of DBS equipment, especially for
homes that want to receive DBS signals on multiple TV sets.

These analysts believe that while DBS may pose a serious threat to
weaker cable operators in smaller rural markets that are slow to
upgrade their networks, satellite technology is not likely to reach
double digit penetration levels in large metro markets, where cable and
telephone companies are expected to focus their network upgrade
investments.

ITALY:  STREAM LAUNCHES VOD GUIDE

"This monthly was conceived for the protagonists of a Great Adventure,
that of VideoMagic.  A unique service, a breakthrough in television
[...] For the first time in Italy, the television set loses its
traditional function as an electrical household appliance and becomes
an interactive tool." These lines introduce what is probably the
world's first VOD programme guide.

This slick, 80-page colour magazine is produced by Stream, the
subsidiary of Italian telecommunications operator STET in charge of
developing and distributing VideoMagic, the bouquet of on-demand
multimedia services delivered via the fast-expanding optical fibre
broadband switched network Italy is building.

Similar to a regular TV guide, the giornale della TV interattiva
introduces the customer to the various programmes and services.

With VideoMagic, Stream enters into the pre-commercial phase of the
service.  The magazine is distributed to the first 1,000 households
connected to the VOD service in Milan and Rome who are invited to test
the variety of products on offer, respond to questionnaires and whose
network utilisation will be monitored.  "It is the beginning, a dress
rehearsal," says Stream.  The information gathered will be used to
improve all aspects of the service, especially the navigation through
the various rubrics."

Presently, the VOD service is structured around a menu composed of four
service categories: Entertainment (Films, Your Television, Sports,
Music & Art); Children (Children's TV, How & Why, Cartoon & Telefilm),
Exploring; Shopping (Department Stores, Catalogue & Famous Brands,
Bargain Corner, Yellow Pages Rome/Milan) and At Your Service (Health &
Leisure, Citizens' Bureau, Kiosk, Financial/ Insurance Services).

Each service/title description is followed by a code, the length in
minutes and the session price.

The VideoMagic programme guide's index includes 65 movies and 70
Telefilms and series, out of a total of 230 programme entries
(excluding the numerous episodes of many TV series) - altogether 30,000
minutes of material.

GERMANY:  BERLIN DIGITAL CABLE TV

The first large digital cable TV project in Germany will start in
April, according to head of the Berlin media authority MABB, Hans Hege.
 The real start will not be until this autumn, however, as there will
not be enough digital settop boxes in the market, he revealed.

MABB reached a preliminary decision last November to give a digital
cable licence to telecom company Vebacom, together with local partner
EMG.  Vebacom, now a shareholder in the new digital TV alliance MMBG,
is talking to content providers, Deutsche Telekom and other cable
operators of the "Netzebene 4" in Berlin.

Hege is confident that the partnership of Vebacom and EMG will work.
"Pay-TV channel Premiere has got a lot of subscribers, for example,
while Vebacom has got a lot of know-how in subscriber management and
marketing and the EMG in digital technical operations, so these
companies could work together without there being any doubts of
gatekeeping.  Step by step the Berlin project will expand.  At first,
only a few Berlin cable households will receive the digital TV
programmes, but the number of cable households which can see the
hyperband-channels will increase in a short time to 10% (110,000)."

Fifteen hyperband channels and one normal-band channel will form the
heart of the new digital Berlin, while in other parts of Germany only
five hyperband channels are ready for digital broadcasting by Deutsche
Telekom.  Each of these channels can broadcast between six to ten TV
programmes.  "We need 35 digital cable channels, but 16 might be a good
start," Hege stated.

"We don't think that video-on-demand is possible yet for a mass cable
audience.  The bad experiences in Orlando have underlined this.
Bundling of channels, multiplexing and pay-perview are the future.  We
will establish the first real digital brand in Germany and, I hope,
that each of the German states will version our digital TV system on
their own cable systems."

On the technical side, the launch of digital TV in Berlin will be much
easier than in other states, because Berlin only has one central cable-
head station.  "Having only one cable-head station makes the digital TV
business in Berlin faster," Hege added.  Manfred Meier, network
developer for many foreign TV stations, also welcomed Hege's
initiative.  "We are having problems getting our foreign channels on to
German cable.  Digital TV in Berlin will be the first step in the right
direction to give more channels a chance to broadcast in Germany."

But Hege has not been not greeted with positive response everywhere.
The broadcasting organisation VPRT, the private cable operators of ANGA
and the biggest telecommunication rival Deutsche Telekom threaten to
sue the coming licensing decision of the MABB, if Vebacom gets an
exclusive digital cable licence in Berlin.  Said Hege, "It is
ridiculous that they are threatening to sue against our decision,
especially since Vebacom is still a member of two of these
organisations.  We don't want to create a monopoly, we want competition
in Berlin.  Each content provider can choose to distribute their
channels for themselves or to work with the service provider."

JAPAN:  NEW DIGITAL SYSTEM DEVELOPED

Researchers for Nippon Television Network, Matsushita Electric and six
other Japanese companies have developed a digital transmission system
that offers high definition resolution and multimedia applications.
Called Prog-ressive Digital Broadcasting, or 525P, the new system sends
and receives images via communications satellite at a rate of 60 frames
per second, twice the speed of conventional systems.  Like the current
NTSC system, the 525P uses 525 scanning lines, but the faster
transmission rate means that twice as much visual information appears
on the screen.  The resulting picture quality is equivalent to that
produced by NHK's Hi-Vision analogue system.  Also, like Hi-Vision, the
525P offers a 16:9 aspect ratio.

The partners on the NTV and Matsushita-led development team, which
include Texas Instruments, Toshiba, Japan Satellite System, DMC,
Hitachi and Sanyo, have successfully tested the system in transmissions
from Yokohama to receiving stations in Osaka and Tokyo, via the JCSAT-3
digital satellite.  The system was able to send from three to six
digital video channels using a single transponder.

The system's real-time progressive video decoder decodes compressed
signals at 60 frames a second, twice the speed of the MPEG-2's Main
Profile, Mail Level (MP@ML).  The system's settop box is installed with
a progressive digital decoder that can compress both digital, audio and
video signals simultaneously and offers a component output function
(Y,Pb,Pr) with a vertical scanning frequency of 31.5kHz.  Users of Wide
Clearvision or Hi-Vision sets are able to receive the system's digital
signals.

In addition to home receiving sets that include a parabola antenna and
a real-time progressive digital decoder or digital-decoder-installed
settop box, the system can transmit to PC monitors, opening the
possibility of multimedia services that allow users to receive and
process images and data on their PCs.

The 525P system is expected to play an important role in the ongoing
battle over Japan's transition to digital broadcasting.  NHK, which
spent more than two decades developing its Hi-Vision system, has long
advocated its use aboard the next-generation BS-4b broadcasting
satellite, which is scheduled for launch in 1997.  Given the planned
switch to digital by cable and communications satellite broadcasters,
beginning in the fall of this year with the start of DMC 50-channel
digital service, top officials in the Ministry of Posts and
Telecommunications have been advocating the rapid introduction of a
digital system to BS broadcasting as well.

In May an MPT advisory panel will issue a report recommending whether
the broadcasting system for the BS-4b satellite be analogue or digital.
 With the announcement of the new NTV digital system (see news story),
the balance has been further weighted against NHK's Hi-Vision analogue
alternative.

EUROPE:  EC AIDS NEW 16:9 BROADCASTERS

Under its Action Plan for the Introduction of Advanced TV Services in
Europe, the European Commission has granted ECU4.395 million ($5.520
million) to seven more television stations in five countries to support
a total of 2,000 hours of wide-screen programme transmissions.

The decision will enable Austria's public broadcaster ORF, Denmark's
Danmarks Radio, the Italian regional stations Telenuovo, Synthesia and
Videolina as well as Veronica from the Netherlands and Granada in the
UK to present wide-screen TV to their viewers for the first time.
Moreover, the Danish service will be the first wide-screen service to
start using the digital satellite TV standard developed by the European
Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB) Group.

"The announcement of a digital wide-screen service by Danmarks Radio is
of strategic importance because it shows that 16:9 really has the
potential to become the screen format of the Information Society,"
commented Martin Bangemann, European Commissioner in charge of
Industry, Information Technologies and Telecommunications, "Wide-screen
is a bridge between analogue and digital television for the consumer.
It works with either technology and therefore futureproofs consumer
investments in the most expensive part of the TV system, the screen
itself."

The overall objective of the Action Plan is to accelerate consumer
uptake of wide-screen TV by overcoming the "chicken and egg" problem:
broadcasters would not transmit 16:9 without TV sets while
manufacturers would not produce them without broadcasting.
Broadcasters in countries with no wide-screen services until now
qualify for funding up to 80% of their expenses, in other countries up
to 50% (see table on back page).

With the latest additions, it is no less than 41 broadcasters in 13
European countries who have received Action Plan support committing
them to transmit true 16:9 pictures - not letterbox.

If Danmarks Radio may well become the first broadcaster to offer
widescreen digitally via satellite, it is not the sole operator
interested in using digital transmission to provide wide-screen
programming.

In the UK, the BBC publicised its plan last April (see ATM May 95) to
make wide-screen television the centerpiece of its digital terrestrial
TV strategy.

CANADA:  SEGA CHANNEL CANADA UP

In late January Shaw Cable, Canada's second largest MSO, launched Sega
Channel Canada, a 24-hour interactive game channel on its basic cable
service.  The channel costs C$19.95 a month, almost the cost of the
basic cable service itself.  Shaw launched the service in Victoria, BC,
and in Calgary and Edmonton, Alberta.

Shaw officials peg the high costs as being the equivalent of purchasing
or renting C$3,000 worth of games.  To access the system, Shaw
subscribers will need a 16-bit Sega Genesis console.  Shaw will provide
the adapter needed to hook up the game gear to the cable system.

Sega Channel Canada is a 50/50 joint venture between Rogers and Shaw.
Rogers has rolled out the system in Vancouver, BC, and Newmarket, Ont.

Sega Channel Canada will start with 50 titles a month, rotating within
the Sega library of 700 games.  About 70 percent of the games will
change each month.  Successful titles will remain in circulation.

The channel will come with a Password for Parents which will allow
parents to set a time limit on how long the games can be played and
which games children can play.  The content of each game has been rated
by the Entertainment Software Rating Board.  Once Password is turned on
prohibited games cannot be downloaded.

Shaw officials stated that the reason for the limited launch was
because of a shortage of adapters and a desire to practise their
marketing techniques before hitting major eastern markets, slated for
Easter.

UNITED STATES:  DIGITAL PIRATES STRIKE DIRECTV

Leading experts believe that American DBS service DirecTv is under
attack by digital satellite pirates and that the underground trade in
pirate decoders may soon be draining off subscription revenues from one
of every two DBS receiving sets sold.

Bob Sherman of Satellite Business News claimed, "Piracy could become a
huge potential problem here.  It could become the biggest problem
facing DBS.  The only reason that it is not widespread is because there
is a worldwide chip shortage right now and I think that is holding down
distribution."

Jim Shelton of Shelton and Associates, a San Diego-based consulting
firm agrees with Sherman.  "The only reason that it is not widespread
at this time is probably a shortage of computer chips.  A lot of these
chips require a 26-week lead time." Sherman previously worked at
General Instrument's San Diego-based Videocipher division where he
helped end signal piracy on C-Band dishes.  Sherman estimates that it
cost $50 million to put an end to big dish piracy.

At the moment, experts believe that there are only between 5,000 to
10,000 black market DBS decoder cards in operation, but Shelton
believes it is only a matter of time before the piracy mushrooms.  "It
could become rampant.  Once they have plenty of cards, you will see
advertising break out in flyers and faxes offering the cards.  If it
continues unchecked, it won't be long before you see them manufacturing
100,000 receiving units a month, but only 50,000 are being legally
authorised."

The black market access cards are being sold for between $500-700.

DirecTv president Eddy Hartenstein has claimed that he is two steps
ahead of the hackers and that he can foil them with electronic
countermeasures or by issuing new decoder cards.  Both Shelton and
Sherman believe that DirecTv is not doing enough to thwart the digital
satellite pirates, however.  "Electronic counter-measures are a form of
harassment.  The only way to do it is to do a redesign, find out how
they came in and redesign the locks.  It costs about $25 million."

DirecTv refused to comment on the piracy issue, maintaining that
anything it says may betray their intentions to the pirate community.

The case came to light when US immigration and custom agents stopped a
man crossing the US border from British Columbia.  He was detained on a
cellular piracy case and found to be carrying 113 DirecTv access cards.

Canada is one of the centres for the manufacture of the illegal cards
due to previously lax piracy laws.  Now that Canada's laws have been
tightened up, the pirates are settling in the Cayman Islands.  Calgary,
Alberta, however, remains one of the manufacturing centres.

"Typically there are three stages to piracy," said Shelton.  "The first
is a simple cloning of a card authorising all programming.  The second
is called the `Three Musketeers', which uses one authorised card to get
the monthly keys and updates being broadcast.  The third is the `Wizard
Key', whereby the key from a working unit is extracted and distributed
to pirate boxes.  They are already moving into the third stage, which
is very fast."

JAPAN:  DMC GETS ITS OWN WAY

An advisory body of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications (MPT)
has started deliberations on revising the limit on the number of
channels a single broadcaster can operate from two to 12.  The Radio
Regulatory Council is also mulling whether to allow an increase in the
number of channels to be beamed by digital satellite service provider
DMC from 50 to 70 and radio channels from 100 to 200.

The current regulations were designed to prevent domination of scarce
analogue channels by a few big media players, but with the launch of
the JSAT-3 digital satellite in August 1995, the number of potential
channels will grow enormously, making room for many more channel
operators.  Also, a major drawing card for the new DMC service is
expected to be NVOD and pay-per-view, which require a large number of
channels per operator to be profitable.

Partly motivated by last year's announcement by Hughes Communications
and four Japanese partners of a plan to launch a 100-channel service in
1997, DMC has told the MPT that it wants to expand its channel bouquet
from 50 to 70, with many of the additional channels to be allocated to
NVOD and pay-per-view services.  Among the operators will be Itochu,
Mitsui & Co.  and other major trading companies.  DMC will begin test
broadcasts this April and commercial broadcasts this September.

DNC won the argument with the cable operators.  Based on the
negotiations of a working group, the board of the Japan Cable TV
Association (JCTA) has accepted a proposal by digital satellite service
provider DMC to have its planned 50-channel service distributed over
cable as well.

The working group had expressed JCTA's concern that DMC's digital
satellite bouquet, which is scheduled to start in June and which
closely resembles current cable offerings, might harm the diffusion of
cable TV.

Although many of the JCTA's 300 member stations are now enjoying growth
in subscriptions after years of recessionary stagnation, more than half
are still operating in the red and TV households receiving multichannel
cable still account for only five percent of the total number of
households.  Prior to the start of talks with DMC in September, JCTA
representatives told the media that the cable industry in Japan could
not easily cope with competition from a digital satellite service.

DMC countered with an offer to provide cable operators with antennas
and other receiving equipment free of charge so that they could relay
DMC broadcasts to their subscribers.  After some hesitation, the JCTA
working group accepted this proposal in November.  Although DMC balked
at a JCTA proposal refraining it from marketing its service in areas
already served by cable, it agreed to negotiate its marketing
arrangements with individual cable stations, paving the way for a
cooperative agreement.

EUROPE:  TALISMAN: DIGITAL PROTECTION

Two pan-European research projects -Talisman and Okapi - are to address
the new challenges presented to creators and rights holders by the
widespread use of digital technologies in the audiovisual industry.
This research is being carried out within the framework of the European
Union's Advanced Communications Technol-ogies and Services (ACTS)
project.

Talisman (Tracing Authors' rights by Labelling Image Services and
Monitoring Access Network) aims to protect EC service providers'
digital products against large-scale commercial piracy and illegal
copying with a standard copyright mechanism.  The project focuses on
video services and will demonstrate the relevance of the mechanisms
around pilot demonstrations covering media like cable and satellite
broadcasting as well as ATM networks for multimedia interactive service
access.

Two technologies are being considered for protecting video sequences.
The first involved the labelling of a digital product, compatible with
the compression standards JPEG for fixed images and MPEG for moving
images.  The tampering of such a protected product will leave "traces"
which invalidate the encrypted label.  The second technology involved
the application of invisible and indelible "tattoos" on the images,
resisting digital compression and decompression and any manipulation.
Both techniques can be used simultaneously.  Furthermore the project
includes the design of monitoring devices connected to networks
allowing on-line auditing and accounting.

One of the research consortium's key objectives is to submit to DAVIC
and DVB a standard copyright mechanism for video protection.  "The
availability of copyright systems managed in a harmonised way will be
essential for all the end users in the field: TV broadcasters,
producers of movies, cassettes, video CDs and interactive CDs," says
the project prospectus.

The project has been awarded to a consortium of 11 partners led by
French company Thomson-CSF and including Hispasat (Spain), CSELT
(Italy), EPFL (Switzerland), ART3000 (France), Fraunhofer Institut
Darmstadt (Germany), Institut Superior Tecnico (Portugal) and four
Belgian partners, Universite Catholique de Louvain, RTBF/UER,
Belgarchive and SACD.

Access control to networked multimedia service is specifically
addressed by the research project Okapi (Open Kernel for Access to
Protected Interoperable interactive services).  The objective is for
the Okapi kernel "to ensure interoperability, openness, equity, user
privacy and evolutivity for opening the European multimedia market to
every potential service provider and user," says the project spec
sheet.  The consortium behind the project will elaborate a standard
kernel for access control systems to be submitted to DAVIC, DVB as well
as the EBU.

Given the synergy between both research projects, several of the 12
Talisman partners are also present in the Okapi consortium.  Its
members include University of Thessaloniki (Greece), Deutsche Telekom
(Ge-rmany), CSELT (Italy), Philips (Nethe-rlands), CCETT (France), EPFL
(Swit-zerland), Fraunhofer Institut Darmstadt (Germany) and four
Belgian entities, RTBF/UER, Pastel (Mons), Universite de Liege and the
Universite Catholique de Louvain, the team leader.

USA:  WILL STATIONS GET ATV SPECTRUM?

Ironically, as the Grand Alliance and Advisory Committee on Advanced
Television Service (ACATS) celebrate the US digital broadcast standard,
the political process threatens to take from broadcasters the spectrum
on which the new standard would be delivered.

Senator Bob Dole, the leading Republican presidential candidate, has
emerged as the chief foe of broadcasters' digital aspirations.  In
recent weeks he has attacked plans to provide broadcasters with a
second advanced TV channel as "corporate welfare" and threatened to
block the pending telecom deregulation bill unless the spectrum is
auctioned or broadcasters are otherwise made to pay for it.

The White House, meanwhile, has expressed support for a different
approach, which would auction broadcasters' existing analogue channels
as early as 2002.  Neither approach is considered acceptable by the
National Association of Broadcasters, which has come out in support of
the telecom bill.

In late January there were signs that the House could vote on the
telecom bill in early February and that the spectrum issue might be
removed from the bill, to be considered separately at some later date.

FRANCE:  FRENCH STATIONS IN DIGITAL LINK

To face Canal Plus, CLT's and AB's digital projects, the French public
broadcaster France Television and its rival TF1 have surprisingly
decided to join forces by creating a common company to set up and to
market digital services.  Named STEPS (Societe de Television Europeenne
de Programmes et de Services), the 50:50 subsidiary will establish a
common subscription system and a compatible settop box.

A similar deal was expected between AB and TF1, rather than with France
Television, because the two companies have worked together for many
years.  The move therefore comes as a surprise at a moment when
competition between the two companies is fiercer than ever, with TF1
losing viewers and France Television's share rising proportionately,
recovering to the level achieved ten years ago.  It will be the first
time since it was privatised in 1987, that the first terrestrial
network is working with its former parent company.

France Television's chairman Jean-Pierre Elkabbach announced that the
launch of digital services will be in two stages.  The first will be
the launch, next March, of an experimental MPEG-2 multiplex of existing
channels such as TF1, France 2, France 3, La Cinquieme and the wide-
screen station Supervision.  The package will be transmitted in the
clear via Eutelsat's Hot Bird.  Elkabbach said that "the choice of the
future digital decoder will probably be decided during the spring,
after we compare the different existing offers."

The TF1/FT digital venture is planned for launch before the end of the
year.

It is understood that the offer will integrate TF1's `Hyperchaone'
concept of digital e la carte TV and the two channels that state-owned
companies Arte, France Television and INA are close to launch on cable,
La Chaone d'Histoire and France Telefilm.  STEPS will market the whole
offer but representatives at the new joint-venture declined to comment
how the parent companies will share the subscriptions to their own
services.

JAPAN:  MARUBENI'S CABLE PC SERVICE

Major trading company Marubeni is getting ready to launch a new cable
TV service that will allow subscribers to use their TV set to access
the Internet, as well as enjoy conventional cable television
programming via a high-speed cable TV LAN.  Marubeni-owned Town
Television Kanazawa, which will begin operations in April, will be the
first to offer the service, starting some time in 1997.  Eventually,
Marubeni intends to extend it to the network of 15 to 20 cable stations
that it plans to build, beginning this year.

To design content for the data transmission portion of the service,
Marubeni will link with a US partner this March to start a planning
company.  In April, it will join with another US company to launch a
planning company for supplying contents for the video portion.  Both US
partners are still unnamed.

At the end of last year, Marubeni, together with Tokyo Cable Network,
IBM Japan, Sumitomo Electric Industrial and other corporate partners
began a trial of a cable TV LAN with 100 cable subscribers in Tokyo's
Bunkyo Ward.

Among the free services on offer during the trial are on-line English
conversation lessons and Internet connections.  The trial is scheduled
to run until the end of the year.  Based on the results, Town
Television will launch a commercial version of the service in 1997.
Using its high-capacity lines, the station will also offer subscribers
a wide range of other services, including video, data, telephone and
games.

Currently the owner of six cable stations, Marubeni plans to expand its
cable network to a total of 15 to 20 stations, primarily in the Tokyo
and Osaka metro areas.  One of the country's largest trading companies,
Marubeni sees the new service as giving a major boost to cable TV
diffusion in Japan.  In association with supermarket chain Daiei,
Marubeni is also selling personal computers installed with Internet
software.

UNITED STATES:  SNET MOVES INTO CATV

As leading US long distance phone companies make investments in DBS
(see front page story), local phone companies continue to pursue a
variety of strategies in the advanced TV arena.

Southern New England Telecom-munications (SNET), for example, recently
asked the Connecticut Department of Public Utility Control (DPUC) for a
statewide cable franchise.

The action marks a shift by SNET - which provides phone service to most
of Connecticut - from the video dialtone (VDT) common carrier model to
a strategy of becoming a franchised cable operator.  Among other
things, the latter approach offers more direct control over the
programming carried on a telco's broadband network.

The statewide cable franchise would be operated by a newly formed
subsidiary, SNET Personal Vision.  It would use a hybrid fibre-coax
(HFC) architecture that delivers video, voice and data.  It plans to
offer 76 channels of TV programming.

SNET is currently running an FCC-approved VDT trial that serves roughly
350 homes.

In explaining the shift from the VDT to the cable franchise model,
Patrice Listfield, president of SNET Personal Vision, said "we think
this represents the best business decision for us and for our
customers.  We'll provide the benefits of real cable competition sooner
this way.  And we'll be allowed to give our customers a more
competitive, innovative service on a network with superior technical
quality without some of the encumbrances placed on telephone companies
in the VDT business."

In parts of the state where SNET is not the local telephone company, it
intends to work with Nynex and Woodbury Telephone Company to "develop
arrangements that will allow SNET Personal Vision to offer a cable
alternative in those areas, too."

According to Listfield, the company expects to offer service to 22% of
Connecticut homes and businesses by the end of next year and 36% by
1998.  By 2000, service will be offered to 64% of Connecticut and by
2003, to 81%.  She said the company expects to reach the entire state
by 2009.

In neighboring New Jersey, Bell Atlantic has been busy working on the
most extensive VDT deployment to date and, on 29 January, it officially
launched the commercial service.  Bell Atlantic will make its VDT
system offering available to about 1,000 to 1,500 households per month
according to the construction schedule, ultimately passing all 38,000
homes and businesses in Dover Township.  It is the first commercial
deployment of a VDT service on a fibre-to-the-curb (FTTC) network.

In this final phase of testing, participants will begin using basic
interactive functions, such as ordering "recipes-on-request" from the
TV Food Network.  The latter is one of a package of channels offered by
FutureVision, one of seven video information providers planning to
deliver programming on the Dover network.

FutureVision, which has reserved the most capacity on the 384-channel
FTTC network, will undertake an intensive marketing campaign, including
substantial price discounting, with the goal of quickly capturing large
numbers of subscribers from the incumbent cable operators.

Meanwhile, on the country's other coast, Pacific Bell began 1996 by
halting construction of an HFC network it had begun deploying in Los
Angeles and Orange County.

While the company will continue building HFC networks in the Bay Area
and in San Diego, it apparently will rely on MMDS, or wireless cable,
for its near-term video strategy in the L.A.  and Orange County
markets.  Among the factors driving the decision were problems in
dealing with local officials and the combination of capital constraints
and intense competitive pressures that demanded accelerated HFC
buildouts in the Bay Area and San Diego markets.

EUROPE:  DVB DIGITAL NORM AGREED

A high-performance, widescreen standard for digital terrestrial
television has been ratified by the DVB.  The specifi-cation combines
interactivity with digital sound and picture quality.  It also provides
broadcasters with a two-carrier transmission option.

Ratification of the terrestrial standard completes the DVB line-up of
digital standards, which also cover cable and smatv (DVB-C, using QAM
modulation), satellite (DVB-S, using QPSK modulation), and MMDS (DVB-MC
for under 10GHz systems, using QAM modulation; over 10GHz, DVB-MS,
based closely on the DVB-S spec using QPSK and potentially receivable
via the same settop box).  The new terrestrial option, DVB-T, retains
COFDM modulation, but offers broadcasters the flexibility to choose
between 2k and 8k carriers.  The DVB steering board says the 2k option
will allow an early start for digital TV services in the UK (1997):
broadcasters who begin later (for example, in Spain) will have the
option of using the 8k variant, backwards compatible with the 2k
system.

The decision to adopt COFDM modulation has gone down particularly well
with manufacturer Pace.  With COFDM incorporated into the standard,
Pace is free to develop its common platform settop box which will allow
digital reception of satellite, cable or terrestrial transmissions.

JAPAN:  NTT THINKS INTERACTIVE

Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation (NTT) and TV Interactive
Corporation (TVI), a US-based high-tech venture company, will cooperate
in the development and popularization of a service based on TVl's TVIQ,
a one-way infrared communications interface technology.

TVIQ, which is still under development, allows users to simply touch
pictures or drawings in a specially-printed sheet or booklet to view
motion pictures and other multimedia information stored on CD-ROM or an
other medium via their TV sets or personal computers.

NTT plans to use the TVIQ technology to develop multimedia services
"for elderly persons, children, housewives and other people who are
relatively unfamiliar with multimedia."

In the case of a mail order system, for example, a user could hold a
catalogue linked to a CD-ROM, via infrared signals and, while sitting
in front of a TV connected with a game machine, touch pictures in the
catalogue to receive detailed voice and motion-picture information
about products.  The user would touch a "purchase" button in the
catalogue to place an order using a telephone line.

NTT will invite companies from various fields to jointly study how to
utilize the new interface technology for commercial services.  NTT will
also develop a variety of applications in collaboration with other
companies, including NTT affiliates.

GERMANY:  UNCERTAINTY OVER CLT PLANS

Since Leo Kirch gave up his d-Box project to join the MMBG group, MMBG
members have begun to cancel their original plans.

The latest set of cancellations came from Compagnie Luxembourgeoise de
Telediffusion (CLT).  Employees have told ATM that their company has
put a stop on nearly all hiring for the new digital project studio and
its Cologne marketing arm since last December.

The reason for the delays are said to be disagreement between the two
main shareholders Groupe Bruxelles Lambert (GBL) and Havas, and their
heads Albert Frere and Pierre Dauzier and CLT's new manager Michael
Delloye, following Delloye's recommendation that CLT invests a total of
DM1 billion ($695 million) in launching dozens of new digital packages
on Astra.  GBL's chairman Albert Frere is said to be ready to enter a
partnership with the giant Bertelsmann group.

Havas chairman Dauzier was able to get the agreement of the other
shareholders to have CLT join the Canal Plus digital venture with a 25%
stake in the form of staff, studios and programmes.  Originally, CLT
was to have entered the French market on its own.

This still leaves CLT's considerable stake in the German market in a
state of uncertainty and initial plans for 1996 appear to have been
shelved.  Roland Steindorf, marketing manager for RTL-Direct - a CLT
digital package marketing project in Cologne, Germany - denied these
rumours.  "Nothing has happened to alter our plans to enter the German
market with a digital TV bouquet this year." He also denied that the
stop on hiring that his department has implemented since December has
anything to do with these rumours.

USA:  ALLIANCES IN SETTOP SECTOR

General Instrument, the leading supplier of cable TV converters, and
FORE Systems, a leader in ATM (asynchronous transfer mode) networking
products, have formed an alliance to jointly develop a high-speed ATM-
based system for use in the hybrid fibre-coax (HFC) networks now being
built by cable operators and some telephone companies.

The move was seen as an endorsement by a leading cable equipment
supplier of the concept of delivering ATM cells all the way to the
home.  The ATM system being developed is designed to link computers at
speeds up to 25 megabits per second, which would enable delivery of
real-time full motion video to home PCs.  It could also be used to
deliver video and multimedia content in ATM format to TV settops.

According to Mike Ozburn, vice president and general manager of GI's
Telecommunications Network Systems Division, GI will work with FORE to
develop an end-to-end ATM system.  The development partnership was
applauded by Craig Mundie, Microsoft senior vice president Consumer
Systems Division.  Noting that "Microsoft has worked closely with FORE
on ATM technology and standards..and with GI on settop box technology,"
Mundie said the partnership will "help speed Microsoft's efforts to
bring new services to PCs and televisions."

Scientific Atlanta, GI's chief rival in the analogue cable converter
market, also announced some new allies in the digital arena.

The company said its PowerKEY digital conditional access system - to be
used in settop terminals and cable modems - will use software licensed
from RSA Data Security and Cylink Corporation.

RSA's license to S-A is the first to a settop manufacturer of the
company's patented technique for private messaging and digital
signature authentification.

JAPAN:  NIPPON TV GOES DIGITAL

Nippon Television Network, Japan's highest-rated commercial TV network,
is mulling the launch of its own digital broadcasting service using the
JCSAT-3 satellite.  Initially, NTV would beam the same programming as
the one currently broadcast nationwide on its analogue terrestrial
network, but it is also planning tests of data, telephony and other
multimedia services.

Although NTV was considering joining the 50 digital channel-bouquet to
be offered this fall by digital satellite service provider DMC, it may
instead lease its own transponder for a period of three years.  One
reason is that the broadcaster wants to conduct a wide range of digital
transmission tests.  Another is money: broadcasting via satellite is
at, Y300 million ($2.86 million) a year, considerably cheaper than
building masts and ground stations to upgrade its network of local
affiliates.  "We have not made a final decision, but this is an option
we are seriously considering," an NTV spokesman said.  "We have also
not yet decided how many channels or what kind of services we will
broadcast."

FRANCE:  REPORT SLAMS FRENCH TELCO

French minister for Posts, Telecom-munications and Space, Francois
Fillon, unveiled at the beginning of January the main points of the
report he ordered last September from Georges Vanderchmitt, a former
adviser of French audit body Cour des Comptes.  Fearing that France
could miss out in the digital race by having too many digital bouquet
projects, Fillon demanded a clear overview of the country's policy on
satellite telecommunications.

The Vanderchmitt report recommends the creation of a "digital super
alliance'' between all the major French players, (public and private)
with broadcasters' access to the settop boxes ensured "under fair,
reasonable and non-discriminatory conditions".  The report insists on
the necessity to guarantee competition among the players inside the
alliance while having a strong policy on an external offer.  Thanks to
digital technology, the latter should be adapted to the different
geographical zones it targets.

Vanderchmitt foresees that the digital market should be supervised
together by the CSA and the Conseil de la Concurrence (competition
body).

Fillon revealed that he has ordered another report from former TDF
general director Philippe Levrier on whether or not to develop digital
terrestrial television.

USA:  SI DIAMOND'S LCD ADVANCES

SI Diamond Technology (SIDT), which is developing a flat panel Diamond
Field Emission Display (DFED), has announced a breakthrough in high
intensity lighting that promises improved backlighting for LCDs (liquid
crystal display), which today dominate the flat panel market.
Northlight Displays, an SIDT subsidiary, has used diamond-coated
cathodes to produce a high luminance lamp without the use of a heated
filament.  The result, says the company, is a more efficient, easy-to-
manufacture high intensity lighting source.

Most high-intensity lights used in specialised applications provide
luminance in the 1,000-6,000 footlambert range.  High-luminance
backlights employing heated cathodes can reach about 10,000
footlamberts and are currently used for avionic AMLCD (active matrix
LCD) applications.  However, these devices are relatively inefficient
and have other environmental limitations.

According to SIDT, the lamp assembly tested by Northlight exceeds
luminance of 20,000 footlamberts.  Howard Schmidt, SIDT chairman and
CEO says the company is "currently in the process of developing sealed
units and evaluating our options for commercializing this technology,
while at the same time continuing development of the DFED."

UK:  UK LAUNCH FOR SEGA CHANNEL

The first dedicated end-to-end games delivery system in the UK is
expected to be Telewest Communication's roll out of the Sega Games
Channel in its South East UK franchise area, which had been forecast to
launch last year.

A formal announcement of a new release date is expected imminently
following renewed negotiations between TCI International (a major
stakeholder in Telewest) and Sega Enterprises over licensing and
royalties.

Some 25 leading Sega games will be available to subscribers who will
simply plug an adapter into the cartridge slot of the Sega Megadrive
consoles - or a special module into the new General Instruments 2200
settop box.  The Sega Channel module would cost around $200.  The
system incorporates parental controls and code to block transmission of
unsuitable titles.

Because the channel occupies a narrow bandwidth it can be used
alongside existing networked channels featuring a wide tuning range,
and narrow band data camers.  Cable companies would transmit the games
via their optical fibre cable on an unlimited access basis to
subscribers paying $15 to $18 per month, using a dedicated $22,500
headend server.

Sega games service set boxes are now available for European MSOs, and
the channels are expected to launch in Europe during Autumn.  Flextech,
controlled by TCI, would have the rights to launch Sega games channels
in the UK, Scandinavia, the Netherlands and Denmark, and the move is in
line with Flextech's plans to develop new programming for cable and
satellite.

CHALLENGES OF SELLING 16/9 SETS

Widescreen television enthusiasts point to France where the installed
base of 16/9 sets accounts for half of the European total.  Of late,
the attraction of the product seems to be under question as falling
sales figures show.  Yves Dupre offers a personal, and candid, view of
the symptoms and remedies

It was in 1991 that 16/9 television receivers were first introduced on
to the French market by Thomson which, at that time, was a pioneering
and risky move.

However, at the beginning of the 90s, projects were still being carried
out in Europe on high definition television and this launch was to a
large extent linked to these.

16/9 receivers were initially quite expensive, starting at the same
price as a Fiat Panda car.  This did not stop them capturing the `early
adopters', customers who were wealthy enough to snap up new ideas, but
who were not representative of the actual buying trends.

A lot of water has gone under the bridge since then; high definition is
no longer news.  Television is now turning towards digital technology,
the "opportunity for the 16/9" (which has failed to touch the public's
imagination), as well as multimedia which has literally exploded, but
in which the large screen does not occupy a privileged position.  For
their part, consumers themselves have changed since the first 16/9 sets
appeared on the scene.  This is due to economic problems.  Their
motivations and habits have been radically changed.  Without high
definition, and despite these changes, manufacturers have kept their
ranges and even extended them.  Large screen TV sets can be found in
practically all retail outlets, and generally a specialist shop or
large store has several models depending upon size, from three to six
models on average.

Personally speaking and as a journalist specialising in retailing, I
visit points of sale practically very day.  Through the confidences of
contacts and friends throughout the business I began to suspect that
sales of large screen televisions were experiencing a few problems.
There are however signs which are not misleading.  For example, I
observed that a certain number of points of sale, not all of course but
enough to set me thinking, are displaying them at the back of the
store.  I am not saying at the front of the display but well to the
bottom of the shelf and I know that the items which sell well are not
generally consigned to the back of the store.

At the present time we professionals must not avoid the facts.  Despite
considerable efforts on the part of the manufacturers the results for
the sales of 16/9 sets are quite bad.  In France, the first three
quarters of 1995 were marked by an appreciable downturn for the 16/9
sets of at least 12%, perhaps even more - 15% say certain observers -
expressed in terms of the numbers of sets sold.  This information has
come from the best sources.  There is no point in saying that as far as
turnover is concerned and with the remorseless price competition, a
decline which is even more significant in terms of value has been
ascertained.  It is a phenomenon all the more disquieting as it is
happening at the same time as sales of the larger sizes of screen are
growing (the 27-inch model, for example, increased by more than 20%).

I should add that the social problems which are troubling France at the
present time are in the process of completely ruining the end-of-year
sales figures, at the most important time of the season.

In France, we must therefore face the truth that the large screen is
not managing to capture the hearts and minds of the public.

Some of you will find these figures amazing because we have heard other
speeches where larger amounts and considerable increases were announced
by the manufacturers.  The problem is that we must not confuse the
quantities being shipped by the manufacturers to the retailers and the
products being sold to consumers.  The number of models on sale had
widened to a large extent between autumn `94 and `95, but especially
towards the end of `94.  At the same time, a large number of points of
sale finally put the 16/9 sets on their shelves, particularly as, at
this time, the prices of the products had fallen significantly.  From
the price of a Fiat Panda we had reached that of a modest mountain
bike.  In France, there are about 1,000 hypermarkets, 2,000 specialist
stores and about 5,000 specialists points of sale.  That makes 7,000 to
8000 points of sale currently dealing with TV sets.  By supplying only
five display models per shop, throughout the whole of this retailing
sector, that makes between 30,000 and 40,000 sets sold to the shops,
but not necessarily sold to the consumers.  The manufacturers' figures
were therefore correct or just slightly overestimated.  But sales to
the consumer, that's another story altogether.

There is one important calculation to enable us to get a better picture
of what the 16/9 represents for the stockists.  Today, all the
observers acknowledge that the large screens do not exceed 2% of the
total television market.  If we estimate this market on the high side,
say 3.5 million sets, this means a maximum of 70,000 large screens a
year.  But if you divide this quantity by the number of points of
sales, you see that each of them on average only sells 10 sets a year
which is not even one a month.

A certain degree of caution is called for when examining the course of
action taken by the European manufacturers against what they say in
public: if Philips and Thomson are multiplying the initiatives for the
sizes already launched, Thomson has finally deferred the launch of its
"small" 16/9 whilst Nokia has quite simply temporarily withdrawn from
the large TV market.  Many eyes are now turned towards Germany as it is
expected that it will be the "trend-setter" with Palplus.

But let's forget the figures and look at the noticeable change in
consumers' habits.  We must unfortunately record that this
transformation is not favourable to the way in which 16/9 sets are
being offered for sale at the moment as economic difficulties and
unemployment are on the increase.  By and large, consumers are also not
quite as young, already quite well equipped and more mature in their
thinking.  They have become more moderate and attentive when making
their purchases.  They only go for sound values, and what is more, at
the best price.  They are well informed and remorselessly reject
products which do not bring them concrete and tangible benefits.  They
have dreams of the future, but buy in the present.

Large screens are present at the points of sale, but salespeople
testify to the fact that customers know little about them.  Often they
realise that new screens exist when facing the shelves.  And department
managers say that customers who come to buy a good television often go
away with nothing if they only start to hesitate between a widescreen
and a normal one.  Perhaps this hesistant customer must replace his
television which has suddenly broken down.  In this case, instead of
opting for an expensive set, he is happy with a cheap one which is not
good for the sales teams who make their living thanks to a percentage
on the sales realised.  In short, if a salesperson does not want to
lose a sale it is often better not to talk about the 16/9 set too much.

Even if the products are really superb, as far as the layman is
concerned this simple increase in the picture width is only considered
as very modest progress.

Consumer electronics equipment available in the shops today offers a
real revolution for everyone from the small telephones which can be
slipped into your pocket and which enables you to communicate
throughout Europe, right up to the fascinating applications made in
computers and CD-Rom, for example, where sales are exploding.  In this
instance it is not 10 sales a year, but 10 a day.  Even in the field of
pictures, video projectors and home cinema systems with Dolby sound or
THX, as in large halls, sales are high and are transforming people's
leisure time.

There is no point, here, to debate whether widening the TV screen is
justified or not.  Everything revolves round one unique problem: it is
the lack of programmes for the new format.  That is the crux of the
matter for the 16/9 format.

No programme can be picked up for the time being with just a receiver:
one needs at least a satellite or cable system, equipment which is not
very widespread in France.  And since our theme was entitled "what
marketing strategy for large screens", we should not hesitate to say
that the question boils down to the marketing of 16/9 programmes.

Well, then, what are we going to do about large screens? There is much
talk about modifying the size of films received in letter box, about
stretching them on to the screen to fill it.

I must say somewhat critically that I am very much against this myself
because the retail stores tend to use this zooming effect on a
conventional 4/3 set to fill in a demonstration 16/9 model.  Even if
certain manufacturers are tempted to convince us that many programmes
are "zoomable", this is incorrect.  Television does not just show
films.  The bulk of the programming is something other than films.

If the 4/3 picture is stretched, the characters appear squashed or the
heads and feet of the dancers are cut off.  Customers who wander around
the department see these faults.

And it is a poor solution: in intellectual terms no-one can say that he
can be satisfied with cocking a snook at logic.  We have not really
created such efficient products to resign ourselves to only showing
normal pictures in a deformed version.

The example of Japan is often quoted to me.  This formula seems to work
there but in Japan the 16/9 set also benefits from the large screen
video game market.  And for my part I know that European customers are
neither Japanese nor American customers.

Europeans are more demanding.  There is plenty of proof of this all
around us.  Our industries have been successful with products which are
largely more sophisticated than in many other parts in the world; our
fast trains, our planes, our numerical cellular telephones and even our
audovisual are much more efficient.

Returning to our theme of marketing for the 16/9, my thoughts suddenly
turn to vehicles which run on liquid petroleum gas, the famous LPG
which France is going to try to relaunch in 1996.  LPG is economical,
non-polluting, does not make the engine noisy, does not make our hands
dirty, does not smell bad.  With all these drivers said bravo but added
that LPG can be found practically nowhere; simply install the pumps
then we can adopt this mode of transport.  I believe we must similarly
install pumps for programmes.

To develop the 16/9 format the manufacturers must obviously get heavily
involved, as a matter of urgency, in a mass broadcasting of programmes
using the existing channels.  Manufacturers who are proposing large
screen television receivers are not so timid about programmes in many
other areas.

Some of them have bought film studios or are amongst the principal
phonographic editors in the world.  They have not hesitated to launch
programme divisions to create software intended for multimedia.

They will have to grab the market with both hands and do the same for
television as a matter of urgency; become creators and broadcasters of
large screen programmes (it can even be done profitably).

It is also necessary that they think about editing; films on cassettes,
when they are in cinemascope which is often the case, will have to
receive systematically a small logo indicating to the consumer "better
on 16/9".  Even a note for the videodisc.  What problem would, say,
Philips have in introducing the idea of a 16/9 screen on its CD-i or
even its video CD.

It is not providence which is going to enrich the 16/9 world.  As
things stand at the moment, I am very much afraid that the promoters of
the large screen will have to invest a lot of money over a long period
of time before they can impose the new form of screen.  And for how
long? It took between 15 to 20 years for colour television to become
commonplace in France.

I suggest that the industrialists and programme professionals get
together to create a world of pictures which can very quickly, and
without too much investment, become large enough to motivate the
customers.

This period should be considered as a time for pioneers and we must
live and act like them.  Don't wait for governments, committees or even
the Holy Spirit of favourable initiatives.

We must roll up our sleeves and I am sure that if things take off we
will be saying in one or two years time that consumers are becoming
increasingly worried about buying something other than a large screen.

In a word, television receivers are here to stay.  All it takes is for
the show to start.

NTT BREAK UP

An advisory body to Japan's Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications
has agreed on a plan to break up the nation's largest telecom, NTT,
into a long-distance and several regional telephone companies.  The
members of the MPT's Telecommunications Council believe that such a
plan would promote greater competition and more effective management in
the telecommunications industry, which NTT currently dominates.  At the
end of February the Telecommuni-cations Council will issue a report
detailing how the divestiture should be carried out, including the
number of new regional telecoms.  However, a report by the Economic
Planning Agency, opposing NTT's divestiture, expressed concern that a
breakup of NTT will cause Japan to fall even further behind the US in
the race to build an information superhighway.

DAVIC VOTES TO APPROVE RELEASE 1.0

The 205-member DAVIC (Digital Audio-Visual Council) group voted to
approve Release 1.0, its first set of end-to-end ITV protocol
recommendations, at a meeting in Berlin in mid-December with the
intention of passing the data along to the International Standards
Organization for approval as a world standard.  Because of their
growing popularity, cable modems were the focus of attention of DAVIC
as well.  By the next meeting, slated for March in Seoul, South Korea,
DAVIC must achieve sufficient consensus on the cable-modem and data-
delivery protocols to issue a document for circulation among members.
Given the organization's commitment to meeting the needs of multiple
networks, this means the agreed-upon protocols must work in non-cable
environments, such as telco's fiber-to-the-curb and ADSL networks.

HONG KONG GOVERNMENT TO UNVEIL VIDEO-ON-DEMAND PROPOSALS

The Hong Kong government is to unveil its proposals on how to regulate
video-on-demand (VOD) at the end of this month or early March.  It
would also reply to the Consumer Council's report, just published.  The
Consumer Council suggested a number of changes including a new policy
secretary to handle broadcasting, telecommunications and communications
technology.  Officials admitted the distinction between broadcasting
and telecommunications was getting blurred but they stressed the two
branches co-operated satisfactorily.  Telecommunications are handled by
the Economic Services Branch.

BOB DOLE TO BLOCK CONTROVERSIAL MOVE

Bob Dole, the Senate majority leader, is fighting to block a
controversial move that would set aside a valuable slice of the
airwaves to be used for a new generation of digital services, including
HDTV.  Dole argues that a provision in the new telecommunications bill,
backed by the Republicans, is "giant corporate welfare".  In effect,
the bill gives broadcasters new digital licences, which he values at
between $12.5 billion and $70 billion, for free.  The National
Association of Broadcasters is urging President Clinton to overrule
Dole's demand that they pay for the airwave space.

US MARKET FOR INTERACTIVE TELEVISION TO EXPLODE

The emergent US market for interactive television equipment and
software will explode, growing by more than ten times from $2.3 billion
in 1995 to nearly $25 billion by the year 2001, projects a new study
released by Frost & Sullivan.  Network equipment will form 52 percent
of the massive 2001 market, subscriber equipment 42 percent and
software 6 percent, forecasts the report titled; US Interactive
Television Equipment and Software Markets: Emerging Market With
Unlimited Growth Potential.  With ATM currently the only switching
platform usable by the interactive TV industry, the growth of private
ATM networks will in turn stimulate demand for interactive TV.

DTI PROPOSALS FOR DIGITAL TV

The UK's Department of Trade and Industry has published its proposals
for the regulation of conditional access systems - scrambling,
encryption and subscriber management - for digital television.  The
regulation of conditional access, as required by the EC Directive on
Television Standards, would be by way of licences issued under the
Telecommunications Act and enforced by Oftel, "in close co-operation
with the ITC." The government has refused the ITC's request to regulate
conditional access, saying this is because conditional access works
through data streams carried over telecoms networks, and that these
networks are a key part of the delivery of pay-TV.

TIME COMPUTER SYSTEMS WITHDRAWS RANGE

PCTV equipment sales have been so bad in the UK that Time Computer
Systems has withdrawn its range.  Time - which claims to be the UK's
largest direct supplier of computers - has been selling PCTVs since
July.  Instead, it is now offering multimedia PCs with optional PCTV
cards.  John Clare, group chief executive of Dixons Stores Group, has
also found PCTV sales sluggish, although in line with expectations,
with TV cards the preferred option.  "Customers don't see the PC and TV
as the same product," he said.

SALES OF VIDEO-ON-DEMAND SERVERS TO INCREASE

Sales of video-on-demand servers will increase from $131 million in
1994 to more than $1.3 billion in the year 2000, according to Video-On-
Demand - Technology and Economics, a new report from Hodge Computer
Research.  The leading forces in these VOD efforts will be telephone
and cable television operators, the report concludes.  Hodge predicts
that VOD server pricing will fall from $1.35 million in 1995 to
$797,000 in 2000.  NVOD deliveries are expected to drop from $350,000
in 1995 to $206,000 at the end of the decade.

ESTEE LAUDER TO INVEST IN SATELLITE TELEVISION STATION

US cosmetics firm Estee Lauder is considering investing $50 million in
a planned Taiwanese satellite television station, a spokesman for the
station said.  All People's TV, whose founders hope will become
Taiwan's first new television station since liberalisation of the
broadcasting industry in 1994, needed paid-in capital of T$3 billion, a
spokesman said.  Taiwan already has three satellite TV stations, in
which the ruling Nationalist Party, the Taiwan Provincial Government,
the Education Ministry and the Defence Ministry hold major stakes.
Many of the founders the All People's TV are members of the main
opposition Democratic Progressive Party.
