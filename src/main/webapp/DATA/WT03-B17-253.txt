<PRE>       <STRONG><H1> Various Varieties of Beneficial Insects</H1></STRONG>
            <STRONG><H3> Insect Predators</H3></STRONG>
Ants are major predators around both the home and garden!
See also Dances with Ants dept.

<STRONG><H3>Aphid-Predator (Aphidoletes aphidimyza)</H3></STRONG>
       A   tiny  predatory mite, the larvae attack all types
of  aphids both indoors  and outdoors.  They will  inject  a
toxin  into  the aphids then suck their body dry!  Use    in
conjunction with ladybugs  and  green  lace wings.    Adults
hatch  within   1-12  days.  They  will   mate immediately (oh
right!) and each female will hatch up to 250 eggs.

<STRONG><H3>Aphid-Parasite (Aphidius colemani (matricariae))</H3></STRONG>
      A  tiny parasitic wasp that parasites (lays eggs inside
host's  body) about 40 aphid species, mainly green peach  and
related aphids.

<STRONG><H3>Aphid-Lion</H3></STRONG>
       (Chrysoperia   Carnea--for  field  and   row   crops,
Chrysoperia  Rufilabris-for trees, Chrysoperia comanche--for
vineyards):    Some   aphid  lions   are   also   known   as
dobsonflies, ant-lions, or  green lacewings. The  aphid-lion
is   found  in most gardens and  are  predaceous. They   are
an   all    purpose  garden  predator.   The   larvae   eats
aphids,  mealybugs,   scales,  thrips, mites,  spider  mites
and  whiteflies.  The  adults  enjoy  nectar,  honeydew  and
pollen.  What  a  life! The larvae will destroy  many  other
destructive   insects,   as  well  the    eggs    of    many
caterpillars,  mites,  scales, aphids  and mealybugs.

<STRONG><H3>Bean Beetle Parasite(Pediolbius foveolatus)</H3></STRONG>
       This is a wasp with an appetite for the mexican  bean
beetle pupae.  Their eggs are deposited inside the larvae of
this beetle pupae.

<STRONG><H3>Lady Beetle or  Lady Bug (Hippodamia convergens)</H3></STRONG>
      Many  varieties are native to the United States.  Both
the  young  and adult stages eat various soft bodied insects
such   as  aphids, whitefly, scale and their eggs..   If   a
good  food source is available, the lady  beetles will  stay
and lay eggs.

<STRONG><H3>Decollate Snails (Rumina decollata)</H3></STRONG>
                 This      guy      will    control    small
infestations  of small  and medium,  brown  garden   snails.
Avoid  using any  other type  of  snail control while  using
decollate snails.

<STRONG><H3>Dragonflies and Damselflies</H3></STRONG>
     The  Mosquito Hawk   is a good name for the  dragonfly.
They have highly developed eyes and a speedy mode of flight.
They  also  are   fierce hunters.  The   damselfly   is  the
smaller of  the  two and  unlike   the
dragonfly, folds her wings on  her  back.  The
young   of   both   the dragonfly and  the  damselfly    are
called nymphs  or  naiads  and  they  devour mosquitoes  and
other waterborn insects.

<STRONG><H3>Fungus Gnat Predator (Hypoaspis sp.)</H3></STRONG>
         A   tiny  brown predatory mite which lives  in  the
soil.  The female  lays  her  eggs in the soil in  the  area
that   the  fungus gnats,  as  well as springtails and thrip
larvae also  live.  The nymphs  and the adults both feed  on
these  soil dwelling pests.  A very  short  life   cycle  of
about 10 days means that  you  should apply  several  times
for  best control. For maximum  control  use with  beneficial
nematodes   like  Bio-Pest-B-Gone  available  at ARBICO  and
most mail order stores. See Resources this Dept.

<STRONG><H3>Fly  Parasites   (Muscidifurax zaraptor) (Spalangia  endius)
(Nasonia  vitripennis) </H3></STRONG> are all tiny parasitic  wasps  which
attack the pupae of manure breeding flies.

<STRONG><H3>LeafMiner Parasite  (Diglyphus isaea)</H3></STRONG>
      A parasitic wasp that loves leaf miner larvae!

<STRONG><H3>Mealybug Destroyer (Cryptolaemus montrouzieri)</H3></STRONG>
      Attacks   all   stages of mealybugs. Both  the  larvae
and  adult   are predators. They also like aphids,  whitefly
scales and all soft scales.

<STRONG><H3>Mealybug Parasite (Leptomastix dactylopii)</H3></STRONG>
     A parasitic wasp that goes only after mealybugs!

<STRONG><H3>Black Scale Parasite (Metaphycus helvolus)</H3></STRONG>
        An other parasitic wasp that is very effective  against
several    soft   scale  species  including  brown   scale. Most
effective in semi-tropical conditions.

<STRONG><H3>Purple Scale Predator (Lindorus lophanthae)</H3></STRONG>
       A    black Ladybug, she loves both larvae and adult soft
scales  and armored,  inluding black, brown, red, mealbugs  and
other  smaller insects.


<STRONG><H3>Red Scale Parasite</H3></STRONG>
        Another     parasitic   wasp.  This  one   goes   after
the California  red scale.

<STRONG><H3>Fly Parasites</H3></STRONG>
       Attack    flies  before they hatch with this   parasite.
Fly  parasites   deposit   their   eggs  inside  immature   fly
pupae,   the  parasitic eggs  hatch into larvae which  feed  on
their hosts.

<STRONG><H3>Leafminer Parasite (Diglyphus isaea) </H3></STRONG>
a tiny parasitic wasp that attacks leafminers.

<STRONG><H3>Praying Mantis (Tenodera sp.)</H3></STRONG>
    The  Chinese  mantis was first introduced into  the  United
States  in  1896.  The mantis captures, holds and devours  many
different  pests; bothers  some  insects as well  as  beneficials.    A
very  helpful insect  in  the  vegetable garden or around   the
house  if  controlled; otherwise it can  cause  damage  to  the
beneficial populations as well. Used mostly in science projects
in schools. OK for indoor use.

<STRONG><H3>Scale  Parasites  (Aphytis melinus)</H3></STRONG>
a  parasitic  wasp,  attacks armored  scales  females including
California red scale,  yellow scale, San Jose scale and oleander scale.

<STRONG><H3>Spider Mite Predators
(Galendromus  occidentalis)</H3></STRONG> is a spider  mite  predator
which tolerates  high  temps and high humidity. Good  for  hot  green-
houses, tomatoes, grapes and interoscapes(house plants).

<STRONG><H3>(Neoseiulus   californicus)</H3></STRONG>  is another
spider  mite predator that survives longer  than its  cousins, but requires a
greater  humidity.

<STRONG><H3>(Mesoseuilus  longipes)</H3></STRONG> is another
predator which can  tolerate low humidity and is effective  up to 100 degrees F.

One  of  the  most   effective controls  of  the    two-spotted
spider   mites   is <STRONG><H3> (Phytoseiulus persimilis)</H3></STRONG>.
Consumes  both adults and eggs of the  spider  mites.

<STRONG><H3>(Galendromus  helveolus)</H3></STRONG> is an
avocado mite specific   predator in  Southern  California  and Mexico
and the  six-spotted  mite that attacks Florida Citrus.

<STRONG><H3>Spined Soldier Bug</H3></STRONG>
 Controls  Mexican bean beetle:  This bug  preys  on  many
garden pests such  as cabbage loopers, cabbageworms and Mexican
beetles. Both adults and nymphs attack other pests.

<STRONG><H3>Semaspore</H3></STRONG>
        A    predator    of  a  different  sort.  A  long  term
grasshopper  control   which   is deadly  to  grasshoppers  and
crickets,  is  made from a naturally occurring protozoan.


<STRONG><H3>Thrips Parasite (Thripobius semiluterus)</H3></STRONG>
Preys  on  green  house  thrips of  citrus  and  avocados.
Predatory mite's papae is attached to trees.

<STRONG><H3>Thrips Predator (Neoseiulus barkeri)</H3></STRONG>
They   not  only enjoy thrips but also will eat  mites
in greenhouses.

Also <STRONG><H3>Neoseiulus cucumeris</H3></STRONG>
is an  excellent  thrip predator that eats only the young stages of the thrips.

<STRONG><H3>Minute  Pirate Bug (Orius sp.)</H3></STRONG> Adults
and larvae attack  spider mites as well as aphids and whitefly pupae.

<STRONG><H3>Whitefly  Predator  (Delphastus pusillus) </H3></STRONG>
a tiny  black  ladybug which just loves whitefly eggs!

<STRONG><H2>  Other Predators</H2></STRONG>
The   most   abundant and important predators  for   a
healthy  garden are  the  two-winged  Flies,  the   Wasps   and
the   Green  Lacewings. Parasites will attack  insects  in  all
stages   of   their  development.  The  host   does   not   die
immediately  but   provides nourishment  until  the  larva   of
the parasite is nearly  grown, after which the host dies.

<STRONG><H3>Tachinid Flies</H3></STRONG>
These   predators  prey  on a wide  variety  of  insect
species. They  lay  their eggs in the host body, which provides
the  young with  a source of  food. Compsilura concinnata is  a
fly  that   was  imported from  Europe to  combat   the   gypsy
moth.   Flesh   flies have  varied  habits:   Some   are  flesh
eaters, while  others  eat only insects.

<STRONG><H3>More about Wasps</H3></STRONG>
Wasps     feed    mostly    on    other    insects.
Their favorites are caterpillars  such  as  the  armyworm.  There
are  many  varieties   of parasitic wasps. Wasps are  generally
quite social, with males,  females and  sterile  workers making
up  the family. Some species  of  parasitic wasps  attack  only
certain insects.

<STRONG><H3>  Encarsia  formosa </H3></STRONG> is  the
whitefly  parasitoid   which effectively   controls  whiteflies.
Delphastus  pusillus which attacks the  sweet potato whitefly,
is one hungry beetle!  Both the   larvae  and adult feed on all
stages of this whitefly  as well as  feed upon  spider  mites and
other pests.

<STRONG><H3>Erectmocerus  nr. Californicus</H3></STRONG>
is  a tiny parasitic wasp  that controls   the  sweet potato white fly
and silver fish  indoors in  green houses as  well as outdoor crops.
Watch out for  ants carrying away wasp eggs!

<STRONG><H3>Lysiphlebus Testaceipes</H3></STRONG>
These   guys  destroy millions of aphids per  year  by
laying eggs within the bodies of the aphids.

<STRONG><H3>Trichogramma minutum and  T pretiosum and T platneri</H3></STRONG>
These  are  minute egg parasites that destroy the  eggs
of  most   injurious    pests  such  as  the  bollworm,  cotton
leafworm  and various borers, hornworm, colding moth,  and  all
moths  and butterfly eggs.

<STRONG><H2>Beneficial Nematodes</H2></STRONG>
These     parasites   control  many  borers,   grubs,
cutworms, oriental beetles, pillbugs and cutworms.

Available  are  parasitic  nematodes  of  the  HB   and
SC  varieties.  The HB  variety is an effective alternative  to
milky  spore for  the  Japanese  beetle  grub.  Medfly   larvae
can   be  controlled  by these also.  See  BioHalt!   Bio-Safe,
BioQuest See also Bio-Pest-B-Gone available through ARBICO.

<STRONG><H3>Steinernema  carpocapsae</H3></STRONG>
are effective against termits,  larvae and  grubs  stages  of certain
beetles, weevils,  borers,maggot fleas,  armyworms,cutworms,
chafers, webworms, fleas and fungus gnats.  These  guys  enter
through any body openings  of  their prey. Heterohabditis is a
cousin to above except it can  enter through  its prey's skin! Ouch!
Sold under the name of Termask through  Arbico.  Also  available
at  many  other  mail  order centers. BioSafe , BioQuest etc...

<STRONG><H3>Clandosan</H3></STRONG>
These    parasites   control  root-knot    nematodes,
and simulate naturally occurring soil organisms.
They   should  be  tilled into the soil before  planting,
and  then  applied every year after that. They also can be used
as  a side dressing as needed.

<STRONG><H3>Fire Ant Bait</H3></STRONG>
Contains   avermectin which is a natural  soil  organism.
Ants  take   bait   back  to  colony  where  it  is  distributed
throughout colony and  kills entire colony within 3  months.
Use  the  same system as on ants.

<STRONG><H2>Beneficial Organisms</H2></STRONG>
