<H1 align=center>VISITORS TO THE LIBRARY</H1> 
 
The best way to make use of SPRI Library is to come and visit it.  Each
year several hundred visitors are received, many from overseas and many
for extended periods of time.  All are made welcome.  For a brief visit,
simply mail Shirley Sawtell, Information Assistant 
(<a href="mailto:ss119@cus.cam.ac.uk">ss119@cus.cam.ac.uk</a>) advising 
her of your planned arrival date and length of stay.  For visits of two 
weeks or more, please write first to the SPRI Director for Visiting 
Scholar status (see below).  Scholars wishing to make use the 
<a href="../archmus.htm">SPRI Archives</a> should first book an 
appointment with Philippa Hogg, Archivist's Assistant, email
<a href="mailto:pmeh2@cam.ac.uk">pmeh2@cus.cam.ac.uk</a><p>
 
Services available in the Library include ready access to the open
shelves, to the bibliographic database 
<a href="sprilib.htm">SPRILIB</a>, 
and to several CD-ROMs including <b>Arctic and Antarctic Regions</b>,
<b>PolarPac</b>, and the <b>Wenger Eskimo Anthropological Database</b>.
For a general description of the collections, see 
<a href="overview.htm">Library Overview</a>.  For details of services 
designed specifically for visitors
with limited time to spend, see 
<a href="timesave.htm">SPRI Timesaver</a>.<p>
 
Opening hours: 09:00 to 13:00 and 14:00 to 17:30, Monday to Friday.<p>
 
<h3>Visiting scholars</h3>

Distinguished scientists and scholars and those learning their trade are
always welcome at the Institute.  If you want to carry out research here
and would like to stay for more than two weeks, you should write to Dr.
John Heap, the Institute's Director, outlining your planned research topic
and length of your proposed stay.  Your application should also include
details of your curriculum vitae.  Every attempt will be made to
accommodate you but the Library is well-used and booking some time in
advance recommended.  

Scholars wishing to have access to the <a href="../archmus.htm">SPRI 
Archives</a> during their stay are strongly advised to consult
first with Philippa Hogg, Archivist's Assistant 
(<a href="mailto:pmeh2@cam.ac.uk">pmeh2@cus.cam.ac.uk</a>), before finalizing
the dates of their visit since access to the Archives is by appointment
only.<p>
