<U>What is the Purpose of CAN?</U><P>
The purpose of the Network is: 1) to effect the necessary governmental changes at the local, state/province, and federal levels which will make possible the implementation of CEC policies related to the education of exceptional children; and 2) to further vitalize CEC units (federations, divisions, branches, and chapters) by providing meaningful vehicles for membership involvement and CEC public visibility.<P>
<U>What is the Structure of the Network?</U><P>
CAN is a communication network that is composed of a cadre of individuals capable and willing to effect necessary governmental change.  The Network is composed of political action network coordinators selected by their respective federations, branches, or divisions.  Each federation CAN coordinator is responsible for developing and maintaining a system of regional coordinators within his/her state.  Depending on the particular federation, regional coordinators may wish to develop a system of local coordinators.  Each division CAN coordinator is responsible for developing and maintaining a system of coordinators from each subdivision throughout the country.<P>

     out all responsibilities related to this position.<P>

     demographic, economic, and social factors of the state/province, as well as CEC<BR>
     organizational considerations.<P>
