Executive Summary<BR>
</B><HR><B>Background</B></CENTER>
<P>The major problem today regarding all kinds of combustion is the pollutants
in the exhaust gases. Burning oil, coal or urban waste causes unacceptable
emissions and restrictions are increasing all over the world. The most common
way of solving the problem is to add cleaning processes for specified, single
pollutants, but these systems are expensive and far from 100% effective.
Another way is to use clean fuels, but this is also very expensive.<BR>
<P><CENTER><B>The BAL System</B></CENTER>
<P>Invented in Sweden, the BAL hazardous waste disposal system is the most
effective and economical alternative to reducing exhaust gas emissions.
It virtually eliminates air pollution associated with combustion resulting
in the cleanest exhaust gas possible, almost regardless of what is being
burned.<BR>
<BR>
The BAL system is based upon a very simple principle: Any gas will condense
if the temperature is reduced to a low enough level. The BAL system reduces
the temperature of exhaust gases down to -50&#176;C to -75&#176;C (-65&#176;F
to -110&#176;F). At this very low temperature, most of the gaseous pollutants
condense together with residual water, which forms a sort of &quot;dirty
snow.&quot; The patented BAL system cools the gas by expanding it through
a reverse screw-compressor, thus eliminating the icing problems and high
costs associated with traditional cooling equipment. The residual snow is
then collected and formed into a solid waste that can be dumped without
environmental risks. <BR>
<BR>
The BAL method is essentially a four-step process: 1) pressurizing the gas/air;
<BR>
2) cooling the gas; 3) expanding the gas; and 4) separating the snow.<BR>
<BR>
BAL plants have been in operation since 1985. Tests with exhaust gases from
combustion of urban waste have shown results far below any country's limitations.<BR>
<BR>
Today, BAL offers a plant for combustion of fluid fuels at a size of 5 MW.
This plant is especially well suited for fluid hazardous waste, such as
oil industry waste, PCB-containing oils, ClHC, waste from agricultural chemicals,
plastics, etc. <BR>
<BR>
The BAL process is covered by worldwide patents.
