<FONT SIZE=+1><STRONG>Understanding Insurance Company Ratings*</STRONG></FONT><P>

Frequently, discussions of insurance/financial products will mention the importance of
ratings when deciding which company to choose.  Ratings are determined by the research of
several prominent services, which conduct in-depth examinations of an insurer's financial
condition and assign it a grade.  As a consumer, you may be considering (or already own)
financial products from different companies.  It's always useful to know who the main ratings
services are, how insurance companies are rated in regard to their financial strength, and
exactly what those ratings mean.<P>  

Although different ratings companies use different formulas, there are common elements that
are examined to arrive at a rating.  These include: the composition and quality of a
company's assets; liquidity (the extent to which a company can utilize liquid assets to meet
its cash needs); investment performance; and quality of management.<P>  

While each of the ratings services has its own criteria for measurement -- and offers an
assessment based on its educated opinion -- taken as a group, ratings services can be used as a
starting point to develop an accurate picture of an insurance company.  These findings are
easily available to the general public (most can be looked up at the library) and can play an
important role in determining which company to trust with your hard-earned cash.<P>

<FONT SIZE="-1">*Ratings do not apply to the performance of variable products, which will fluctuate with market conditions. </FONT><P>

Below are brief descriptions of the four major ratings services and the factors they use
to review insurance companies. <P>

<STRONG>A.M. Best Company</STRONG><BR>
Located in Oldwick, NJ, A.M. Best has been reporting on insurance companies for over 90
years. 
It rates almost 1,400 companies annually for financial strength, operating performance, and
ability to meet obligations to policyholders.  Ratings range from a high of A++ (superior) to
a low of F (in liquidation).  Best looks at several factors, including profitability,
leverage, and liquidity.  It also evaluates the company's management, as well as the quality
and diversification of investments and the adequacy of reserves.  (Best also has a
policyholder confidence factor that measures a company's ability to withstand a policyholder
"run.")<P>

<STRONG>Duff &amp; Phelps</STRONG><BR>
Duff &amp; Phelps reviews insurance companies annually to determine their "claims-paying
ability."  The top rating is AAA (highest claims-paying ability; risk negligible), the lowest
two are CCC (substantial risk) and DD (in liquidation).  In assessing companies, Duff &amp;
Phelps looks at annual statements, historical growth and ratios, economic base of the
company's principal insurance lines, competitive position, and management capability.<P> 

<STRONG>Moody's</STRONG><BR>
Based in New York City, Moody's rates the financial strength of domestic companies.  Moody's evaluates the company's financial capacity to meet the
obligations of its insurance policies over the short and long term.  In reviewing a company,
Moody's considers several factors, including quality of assets, business and product mix,
management style, and strategy of the company.<P>

<STRONG>Standard and Poor's </STRONG><BR>
This New York City-based company has been rating insurers for over 20 years and reviews life
insurance companies at least annually to ascertain "claims-paying ability."  Ratings can
range from a high of AAA (superior financial security) to a low of R (in liquidation).  Standard
and Poor's looks at several factors, including how a company's assets are allocated, industry
risk, and current portfolio yield, and assesses the company's ability to withstand competition
from an unexpected source.  It also examines management, corporate strategy, liquidity, and
flexibility.<P>


It's important to remember that the rating a company receives from a service is an opinion,
not a statement of fact or a guarantee.  Thus, when considering a purchase from any insurance
company, consumers are well advised not to rely on one rating service but to look at two or
more.  (In many instances, slight grade differences within a category are not generally
significant; however, a full letter difference might be.)  While ratings are important, they
should also be considered in the larger picture of the quality of the products and services
the agent and company provide.
