<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Housing Market Activity to Pick Up in All Regions, Followed
by Stronger House Price Inflation</H1>
<P>Cambridge Econometrics today publishes its first edition of <I>Regional
Housing Market Prospects</I>, containing detailed housing market forecasts to
the year 2005 for the standard planning regions of the UK.  These forecasts are
based on MDM, Cambridge Econometrics' 49-sector model of the UK economy, and on
its regional housing submodel.</P>
<P>The number of housing transactions in England &amp; Wales is forecast to
rise by 4.8% in 1996, following the decline of over 10% during 1995.  This
increase in housing market activity combined with a steadily growing economy,
rising employment and falling unemployment is expected to boost house prices by
an average of 2% in the UK in 1996.</P>
<P>However, prospects vary greatly by region, with the strongest increase in
activity expected in East Anglia, the East Midlands and Wales, and the largest
house price rises in London, East Anglia and Northern Ireland.</P>
<H3>Activity to Rise in all Regions</H3>
<P>Following a year of large declines in housing turnover in almost all the
regions, activity is forecast to pick up during this year and next, helped by
low interest rates and stronger growth in disposable incomes. The strong demand
conditions recently experienced in East Anglia and the East Midlands are
expected to continue through the year and housing turnover is forecast to grow
by around 13% in both regions in 1996.</P>
<P>At the other end of the spectrum, activity in the South East housing markets
is forecast to remain the most subdued during the year, continuing to be
hindered by still substantial levels of debt and the slow growth expected in the
region's working-age population.  Activity is expected to grow more slowly in
Greater London than in the rest of the South East, but this still represents a
marked improvement over 1995 when turnover fell by over 13%.</P>
<P>The North and Wales are forecast to see rises in activity of around 9%, as
they recover from below-trend levels of activity.  In Wales this is combined
with a rising working-age population and thus a larger pool of potential market
entrants.  In both regions, housing is now among the most affordable in the UK.</P>
<P>The recovery in market activity is expected to improve during 1997, on the
expectation that general inflation will rise by slightly more than interest
rates.  The increased activity is expected to be concentrated in the southern
part of the UK, where evidence suggests that the markets are more responsive to
real interest rates.</P>
<H3>Regional House Prices to Remain Static at Worst</H3>
<P>No region is likely to see declines in house prices in 1996 although prices
in the North are forecast to remain static, and those in the South West, the
West Midlands and the North West are expected to rise by less than 1%.  Except
for the North West, these regions saw rising house prices during 1995 and high
rates of growth in personal incomes, which are forecast to see a sharp slowdown
during this year.</P>
<P>Northern Ireland and Greater London, despite the slow transactions growth
forecast in the latter, are expected to see the strongest price inflation at
over 5%.  In East Anglia, the strong increase in transactions is expected to
support a 3.8% rise in prices in 1996.  Prices in East Anglia are now likely to
respond more quickly to increased market activity, as the pick-up in activity in
1995 has helped to restore confidence.</P>
<P>Above-average activity in the East Midlands and Wales will support
above-average increases in house prices.</P>
<P>Inflation is expected to accelerate in all regions in 1997, but large
variations will persist among the regions, with East Anglia forecast to be in
the lead.</P>
<H3>Long-Term Prospects in Regional Housing Markets</H3>
<P>The strongest markets over the long term are forecast to be in the regions
expected to see net inward migration: the South West, Wales and East Anglia. 
Housing transactions in these markets are expected to grow by around 2% pa over
2000-05, while growth of only 1% pa is forecast in England &amp; Wales as a
whole over this period.  Such demand growth will provide a foundation for strong
house price increases, especially as it will be associated with a tighter
housing market.  The rate of growth in incomes and labour market participation
will also be influential, notably in the East Midlands.  Activity in Yorkshire &amp;
Humberside is expected to be held back by a working-age population that shows
little change, but growth in average household incomes and rising economic
participation are expected to push house price inflation to only slightly below
the UK average.</P>
<P>In general, those regions that are forecast to see the strongest
transactions growth in the long term will also experience the fastest rise in
house prices.</P>

<H3>Notes to Editors</H3>
<P>Cambridge Econometrics is an independent private limited company and has
been providing detailed economic and sectoral forecasts since 1978.  The
company's work also encompasses detailed regional and energy forecasts for the
UK, and regional and sectoral forecasts for the EU in collaboration with ERECO,
the leading network of European economic institutes.</P>
<P>Cambridge Econometrics provides the most detailed long-term economic,
industrial and regional forecasts available for the UK.  The projections are
based on the `Cambridge model', known as the Multisectoral Dynamic Model of the
UK economy (MDM), which was originally developed in the University of Cambridge
Department of Applied Economics (in the `Growth Project' set up in 1960 by
Professor Sir Richard Stone, the 1984 Nobel Laureate in Economics, and Alan
Brown).  This large computerised system has approximately 5,000 endogenous
variables and nearly 16,000 behavioural parameters and other coefficients.  The
model is continually revised and improved to take account of new data and
advances in economic theory and econometric techniques.
</P>
<P>The regional housing market forecasts are based on MDM and a housing
submodel that provides an integrated analysis of house prices and housing
turnover consistent with the regional macroeconomic environment.</P>
<P><I>Regional Housing Market Prospects</I> is published twice a year.</P>
<P>Copies of the report are normally obtained by companies through subscription
to the company's UK Regional Housing Market Service at &#163;4,950 per annum.</P>
