accident statistics 
</H1>
<BR><br>
<TT>CONCAWE has started to collect information on the <BR>
frequency of accidents in its Member Companies which demonstrate <BR>
a good and improving safety performance.<BR>
</TT></TR></TD></TABLE></CENTER>

<P>For many years, CONCAWE has collected a wide range of statistics on various
aspects of the operations of the downstream oil industry but, until now,
it has not collected information on personal accidents in the operations
of member companies. It was felt that such an exercise would be worthwhile
so that companies could compare their performance against others and hopefully
to confirm the belief that the downstream oil industry was a good safety
performer despite the hazards intrinsic to many of its operations. This
belief has in no way led to a sense of complacency in the industry, and
considerable effort is expended on improving safety, and reducing the number
of accidents to as low as is reasonably possible.<BR>
<BR>
To collect this information, a task force was established under the Safety
Management Group. This group first agreed definitions of the parameters
to be measured. Some of these are described in Figure 1. This was as not
as easy as it sounds. Not all companies collect the same statistics, and
their definitions often differ from those used in the survey, often because
different countries have different accident reporting requirements. However,
companies were encouraged to submit what data they had in the knowledge
that they might not all be completely compatible. It was` felt that any
inaccuracies in the data caused by this would be slight.<BR>
<BR>
For this first exercise, companies were asked for data for the two years
1993 and 1994. In all, sixteen companies responded, and it was notable that
the majority of these were willing to allow their data to be shared openly
with the other companies. This free exchange indicates that they felt that
they could both learn from the experience of others, and help other companies
even though they are their competitors. <BR><br>

The response to this survey was good considering that this was a first attempt.
The sixteen member companies that responded were approximately half of the
CONCAWE membership. In terms of throughput, however, this represents a large
majority of the refining industry in Europe. The survey covered marketing
operations (which includes all non-refining activities including 'Head Office')
personnel as well as refineries and also included contract staff as well
as own employees. To take account of the fact that not all companies could
supply data in all of the sections, the results are expressed in terms of
frequencies per hours worked. <BR><br>

Lost Workday Injury Frequencies for the different classes of workers showing

in class was an LWIF of 0.</tt></center>
<BR><br>
Overall, the reported hours worked were over 300 million with an overall
Lost Workday Injury Frequency (LWIF) of 3.3 in 1994. To put this into perspective,
an 'average' oil industry worker only has a one in four chance of having
to lose a days work through an injury at work throughout his working life.
The performance of each company varied widely around the average as shown
in Figure 2. Although some of these differences are real, some are statistical,
as an accident involving a few workers can result in a high LWIF where the
work population is small. In most cases, the 'best' performance was a frequency
of 0.<BR><br>

<center><tt>Figure 3<br>
In most cases, the 1994 statistics were better than for 1993 with the exception
of fatalities which were increased by one tragic accident.</tt></center>
<BR><br>
The results for the various categories of workers are shown in Figure 3.
Perhaps the most striking aspect of this figure is the consistency of these
averaged reported LWIF. All lie within the range 3 to 5, with little difference
between manufacturing and marketing operations, and between company staff
(employees) and contract labour. There has been a trend over recent years
for more and more of oil industry activities to be carried out by specialist
contractors and there has been a fear that this could lead to poorer safety
performance. Although this fear seems justified in some of the 'worst' cases,
overall, the average incidence was very similar. Member companies are taking
great strides to ensure that contracting companies are applying the same
high standards as themselves.<BR>
<BR>
There was one more fatality (at 19) in 1994 than 1993. However, the number
of these is so small in any one year that it is not a reliable indicator
of safety performance. In fact the 1994 figure would only have been about
half of that in 1993 if it had not been for the tragic loss of nine staff
from one company who were travelling as passengers on the ferry Estonia
when she sank. Over the two years, only about one third of the fatalities
were in the refining area of the industry. Of those on the marketing side,
the major cause was road accidents. All of the average LWIF were lower in
1994 than 1993. Whilst this is satisfying, two years is far too short a
period to indicate a trend. For this reason CONCAWE intends to continue,
and hopefully extend this survey in future years.
