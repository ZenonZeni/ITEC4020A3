<H2 ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER><EM>It's the MSG and Nutrasweet<FONT SIZE=-2>[TM]</FONT> controversy all over again, this time with stronger
evidence...</EM></CENTER></H2>
<H3>Excitotoxins-The Taste That Kills
Russell L. Blaylock, M.D.</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Health Press, P.O. Box 1388, Santa Fe, NM 87504 (tel: 505-982-9373), 
1994, hardcover, $27, 264 pp.</BLOCKQUOTE>


An excitotoxin, states Dr. Blaylock, is a substance added to prepared foods and
beverages that stimulates one's neurons literally to death. This can lead to
neurological disease, even brain tumors. In case you believe an excitotoxin is a
rare, exotic substance hardly ever encountered, you will be chastened to learn that
you probably eat some every day. They're found in such FDA-approved ingredients as
monosodium glutamate (MSG-the universal flavoring in Chinese restaurants),
aspartame (found in the nonsugar sweetener, Nutrasweet[TM]), and hydrolized vegetable
protein (a high-tech protein extract). 

<P>What began in 1908 in a Japanese laboratory as an effort to isolate the
flavor-enhancing factor in kombu seaweed led to a multibillion dollar taste-enhancing
industry by the 1960s. The only trouble here, declares Dr. Blaylock, is that when the
body gets too much of a taste-enhancer, it  turns it into an excitotoxin, or
potential brain cell killer. It's the MSG controversy all over again, but this time
with solid medical data to support the case against glutamates.

<P>Dr. Blaylock is not so much an alarmist as a realist. As a practicing neurosurgeon,
he regularly sees the damage produced by excitotoxins-he calls them
&quot;neurological time bombs&quot;-on the human brain. This damage includes Alzheimer's,
Parkinson's, Lou Gehrig's disease, Huntington's chorea, strokes, headaches,
hypoglycemia, and other conditions. 

<P>A common denominator in these conditions is <I>too much</I> glutamate (an amino acid) in the
brain. Although glutamate is normally found in large concentrations in the brain,
when unnatural amounts enter the system, the natural balance of brain chemicals that
excite and inhibit activity is upset. When this balance is upset, Dr. Blaylock
explains, a &quot;cascade of destruction&quot; ensues, and &quot;serious disorders of the nervous
system can result&quot; throughout all of an individual's developmental stages, from
embryo to adult. 

<P>In case you think the FDA is on the case, regulating the MSG supply in our foods,
Dr. Blaylock reveals how the Glutamate Association, a powerful MSG-industry trade
group, virtually wrote the original FDA &quot;facts&quot; and &quot;safety&quot; guidelines for their MSG
pamphlet. Blaylock will alarm you, but this is useful. His book is upsetting, yet it
is responsibly researched and well argued. It opens a fresh view on the hazardous
relationship of food (in this case, the wrong food) and brain health.

This is a quietly inflammatory documentary about oxygen and its role in healing and
<I>the political aspect of product licensing by the FDA that is keeping ozone out of
</I>American doctors' offices. 

<P>Ozone, which is an energized form of oxygen, is now used in 2000 cities worldwide to
disinfect public water supplies. For the last 30 years, physicians in Germany have
used ozone therapy (oxygen is mixed with a patient's drawn blood then reinfused into
the body) to successfully treat cancer, stroke, gangrene, eczema, burns wounds, pain,
herpes, hepatitis, and now AIDS-40 medical conditions in all. 

<P>In fact, a 1980 study revealed that, of 1000 German therapists who gave ozone
treatment to 5 million patients, 90% said the approach was effective and that it
produced the lowest level of side effects of any existing medical treatment. 

<P>So how come the FDA condemns ozone therapy as untested, undocumented, and unsafe, and
wants somebody to shell out $231 million to prove them wrong? That's the politics of
ozone. Meanwhile, Americans are flying to Germany or Mexico to get the healing
benefits of oxygen. &quot;Ozone is inexpensive, very potent, and if it works even one-half
as well as the Germans claim, everyone in the world should be using it,&quot; says one
prominent American physician who endorses it. &quot;Ozone is the most important drug in
the world,&quot; says another. Find out why in this excellent, clearly argued, and
persuasive triple award-winning video.

<P>These claims are valid assuming one consults a qualified, practitioner experienced in
ozone therapy and that the techniques are properly used.

<H2 ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER>Take Your
Ringside Seat at the Medical Revolution</CENTER></H2>

The term &quot;Armageddon&quot; is a Biblical one indicating the place where a final battle
between the forces of good and evil will be fought and determined. Some may think
Culbert, a journalist, health freedom activist, and former chairman of the Committee
for Freedom of Choice in Medicine, is stretching the idea a little to put the
intensifying struggle between alternative and conventional medicine in these terms;
yet anyone who reads any part  of his exhaustive 1000-page analysis cannot fail to be
impressed with the stakes of this conflict. These stakes are medical freedom,
democracy, and genuine, affordable human health.

<P>Culbert's tone at times is shrill and alarmist; but, frankly, you need to shout these
days to get the attention of many Americans who are otherwise enthralled with the
propaganda of The Club. 

<P>This is Culbert's name for the &quot;Allopathic Industrial Complex,&quot; an intricate and
powerful matrix of drug and insurance companies, conventional physicians, and
governmental regulatory agencies that do their best to keep the alternatives out of
the medical marketplace. 

<P>If you ever doubted that the issue of medicine in America is less about therapeutic
efficacy and more about politics and marketplace control, Culbert's detailed account
may provoke you into a different notion. It may-and Culbert certainly hopes
so-put the zeal of  politics back into your life. 
Culbert documents the faults, excesses, and deceits of the conventional medical
establishment, including their so-called holy war against &quot;quackery&quot; and alternatives
in cancer, AIDS, and heart disease treatment, but he also sets the stage for the
alternative. 

<P>&quot;The evolution of the New Medicine for the 21st century is increasingly the
rediscovery of the holistic paradigm in healing and its coupling with modern-era
advances in diagnostics and therapeutic application-<I>integrative medicine.&quot;</I> Take
your ringside seat at the coming medical revolution, urges Culbert, but then get up
and help make it happen.
