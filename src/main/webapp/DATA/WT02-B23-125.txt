<p><em><strong>Title</strong></em><strong>. </strong>An Introduction to Metal Injection Molding "Plastic Metals"</p>
<p><em><strong>Abstract</strong></em><strong>. </strong> Metal Injection Molding is a powder processing technology that has developed commercially within the last 15-20 years.  The advantages of the technology, is that complex parts that were once machined or cast, can now be processed to near net shape.  The cost reductions thus obtained can approach 30-50%. </p>
<p> The process consists of mixing fine metal powders with a polymer/wax binder carrier and subsequently molding the material into a specially designed die or tool.  The crux of the process is to remove the binder, whose only purpose is to allow the powders to be injected into the die, and sinter at temperatures ranging from 2200 F - 2400 F to levels approaching 95% of full wrought densities.  At present carbon steels, stainless steels, tool steels and non-ferrous alloys such as copper have been developed for gun parts, medical devices, automotive applications and computer peripherals such as heat sinks.</p>
<p> Details of the process will be discussed in the context of the other forming processes such as machining, casting and forming; and a contrast will be drawn when comparing MIM to the classical powder metallurgy processes.  Examples of parts produced by MIM will be shown. </p>
