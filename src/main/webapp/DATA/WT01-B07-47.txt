<H2>About the AIVC</H2>

<P>
Ventilation and air infiltration into buildings represent a substantial
energy demand which can account for between 25% to over 50% of
a building's total space heating (or cooling) needs. Unnecessary
or excessive air change can therefore have an important impact
on global energy use. On the other hand insufficient ventilation
may result in poor indoor air quality and consequential health
problems.
<P>
Designing for optimum ventilation performance is hence a vital
part of building design. This task is made especially difficult,
however, by the complexities of airflow behaviour, climatic influences,
occupancy patterns and pollutant emission characteristics.
<P>
In recognition of the significant impact of ventilation on energy
use, combined with concerns over indoor air quality, the <A HREF="http://www.iea.org/" >International Energy Agency  
</A>(IEA) inaugurated the Air Infiltration and Ventilation Centre
in 1979. The role of the centre is to provide technical support
to those involved in the research and development of ventilation
technology as well as to ensure the widest dissemination of information
on related energy and air quality issues.
<P>
The AIVC fulfils its objectives by providing a range of services
and facilities which include:
<H2><A NAME="Information">Information</A> Services</H2>

<P>
The Centre provides a comprehensive information service, the hub
of which is its bibliographic database - <A href="airbase.html" >AIRBASE  
</A>. This contains abstracts of several thousand specialist articles
related to ventilation and associated issues. AIRBASE is regularly
updated and may be accessed via the Centre or may be obtained
in machine readable form for operation on IBM PC compatible computers.
The majority of items referenced in AIRBASE are available from
the AIVC's international library service (subject to copyright
restrictions).
<H2>Technical <A NAME="Analysis">Analysis</A></H2>

<P>
The AIVC undertakes its own technical programme which is focused
on the analysis and interpretation of international research.
Current activities include:
<UL>
<LI>the development of a <A href="numdb.html" >Numerical Database  
</A>for design and evaluation applications,
<LI>the review of ventilation strategies for commercial and domestic
environments,
<LI>the evaluation of calculation and measurement procedures for
predicting airflow and air change rates,
<LI>reviewing the energy and environmental impact of building
ventilation, and
<LI>assessing air change and ventilation efficiency applications.
</UL>

<H2>Technical <A NAME="Interchange">Interchange</A></H2>

<P>
An important task of the Centre is to ensure the widest possible
dissemination of information. In fulfilling this task it publishes
many <A href="reports.html" >technical reports  </A>and co-ordinates
and publishes the results of related IEA activities. In addition,
the AIVC organises regular conferences and specialist workshops.
It also publishes &quot;<A HREF="elecair.html" >Air Infiltration Review  
</A>(AIR)&quot; - a quarterly journal of information, news and
short technical items. &quot;Air Infiltration Review&quot; is
currently circulated to over 40 countries. In addition, as part
of its dissemination activity, the AIVC carries out regular surveys
of world-wide research into building ventilation.
<H2>Annual <A NAME="Conference">Conference</A></H2>

<P>
The 18th AIVC Conference &quot;<B>Ventilation and Cooling&quot;
</B>is open to participants from all countries* in the <A HREF="http://www.ecbcs.org/" >IEA ECBCS  
</A>Implementing Agreement. Please see the <A HREF="conf.html" >18th AIVC Conference Announcement  
</A>for more details. The <A HREF="cnfrpt17.html" >17th AIVC Conference Report  
</A>describes many of the contributions to the most recent Conference.

<H2><A NAME="Co_ordination">Co-ordination </A>of Related IEA Research
</H2>

<P>
The AIVC is partially responsible for co-ordinating and publishing
the results of <A HREF="http://www.ecbcs.org/annexes.html" >related IEA research  
</A>. This includes joint international research into:
<UL>
<LI>occupancy patterns
<LI>minimum ventilation rates
<LI>moisture in buildings
<LI>demand controlled ventilation
<LI>analysis of airflow patterns
<LI>development of algorithms

<P>
The services of the AIVC are available to organisations in participating
countries through the contact organisations. In many instances
the services of the Centre are available at no charge. A limited
service is available to non-participating countries; this includes
the availability of &quot;Air Infiltration Review&quot; and other
selected publications. For further information please refer to
your <A href="countries.html" >contact organisation  </A>or to
the <A href="address.html" >AIVC  </A>.<HR>

<H2>Related <A NAME="Annexes">ECBCS Annexes</A></H2>

<P>
The AIVC is just one of the programmes run under the IEA <A href="http://www.ecbcs.org/" >Energy Conservation in Buildings and Community Systems  
</A>Programme. Many of the reports published by the various <A href="http://www.ecbcs.org/annexes.html" >Annexes  
</A>are available from the AIVC.
