<p> Another important claimant for credit in bringing about the
legislation was a young Conservative in Vancouver, H. H. Stevens.
Stevens became a very vocal MP during the narcotics debates of
the 1920s, and personally introduced several important
amendments. His zeal for narcotic drug prohibition was kindled
during his early investigations of the problem. </p>

<p> According to his own account, when he learned about the
gambling and opium trade being carried on in Vancouver's
Chinatown, he took the following actions: </p>

<p> I took it up with the Chief of Police, but he just brushed me
off. Then I went down into Chinatown itself, and visited the
gambling joints and also saw personally the Chinese preparing raw
opium for the market. When the Chief of Police refused to take
any action, I used to publish in the _Vancouver News Advertiser_
exactly what I had seen the night before. This I did for several
weeks. It created quite a sensation in Vancouver, and as a result
the civic authorities discharged the Chief and appointed Mr.
Chamberlain. This man, when he became Chief of Police, did an
excellent job in clearing up Chinatown(29). </p>

<p> He described his role in bringing about the first opium Act
as follows: </p>

<p> (In 1908) I was responsible for the matter being brought to
the attention of the then government. I remember taking some very
prominent eastern gentlemen around Pacific Coast cities and
showing them the effects and use of these drugs. They returned to
Ottawa and put it up to Sir Wilfred Laurier, and the result was
the Bill that was introduced(13d,p.2899). </p>

<p> &lt;SNIP&gt; </p>

<p> The motives of H. H. Stevens and of the city councils are
open to question. They appear in this instance to have been
concerned about moral reform and civic order but all were
associated with anti-Chinese policies in other contexts. Stevens
came to be recognized as the &quot;the city's leading
anti-Oriental spokesman&quot; (30, p.91), in Parliament as at
local rallies. Civic politicians, too, had an anti-Chinese
rhetoric as part of their election kit and, once elected, usually
supported the use of municipal ordinances and licensing powers
for discriminatory purposes. </p>

<p> &lt;SNIP&gt; </p>

<p> The League's (Vancouver Anti-Opium League) representations to
King(Mackenzie) included an urgent telegram at the time when the
Bill was being sent to the Senate and the opium manufacturers
were lobbying for a moratorium to protect their financial
interests. </p>

<p> INFORM GOVERNMENT NOT TO LET MANUFACTURERS DELAY LEGISTAION.
CHINESE AT LARGE FAVOUR IMMEDIATE SUPPRESSION(2d). </p>

<p> &lt;Begin pg 203&gt; </p>

<p> THE PUBLIC </p>

<p> Interested sections of the public became very vocal and
active during the same period in in demanding more severe
penalties. The cry for heavier punishment was the result of a
drug scare created almost entirely by alarmist stories in the
mass media. The stories, of which Emily Murphy's articles in
_Maclean's_ were a prime example, reinforced pre-existing
hostility to Orientals and augmented the horrifying spectre of
the &quot;dope fiend.&quot; The negative racial stereotypes and
alarming drug mythology, spread by people who claimed to have
first-hand knowledge, were accepted uncritically. The immediate
result of these fears and hostility was the emergence of a
British Columbia drug lobby in 1921, with the straightforward
goals of compulsory imprisonment and whipping for all traffickers
and, where possible, deportation. Public fears about narcotic
drugs were particularly intense in British Columbia, the province
with the largest concentration of Chinese immigrants.
Accordingly, the greatest pressure on legislators for severe
penalties originated in that province. Much of the demand for
greater punitiveness was linked to animus against the Chinese and
a desire to get rid of them, seen most clearly in the proposal
for deportation. </p>
