<H2>Australia</H2>
Australia wide this sector employs over 50,000 and has a turnover of $5.6 billion (1.3% of GDP), split between paperboard (which makes up 40% of the 1.3%), plastic (30%), metal (20%) and glass (10%).  The raw material sector employs 20,000 and the converting sector 30,000.  The industry has restructured to compete internationally.  There are now only two major manufactures of corrugated boxes, six commercial can companies, and only one glass manufacturer.
<P>
Australian-owned companies are becoming global with acquisitions or joint ventures in USA, Europe and Asia.
