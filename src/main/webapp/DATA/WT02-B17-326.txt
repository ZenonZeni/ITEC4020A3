 Perhaps the best-known and most respected spokesman for global
biodiversity, Dr. Edward O. Wilson had a candid conversation recently
with <EM>CI News From the Front</EM> staff.  Harvard professor, field biologist
and Pulitzer-prize winning author, Dr. Wilson shared his thoughts
on matters ranging from what the future holds for global biodiversity
to the United States' role in biodiversity conservation.

<P><STRONG>CI News: Why is biodiversity important?
</STRONG>
<P>
Dr. Wilson: Global biodiversity
is important for three primary reasons.  First, it is crucial
to the stability of ecosystems and their resistance to environmental
stress.  Second, the millions of species of plants, animals, and
microorganisms are a largely unexplored treasure house of new
scientific information, pharmaceuticals, crops, petroleum substitutes,
and other products of great importance to humanity.  Third, and
somewhat less tangible, is the contribution of natural ecosystems
to human psychological development and health. 

<P>
<STRONG>CI News: What role can the United States play in global biodiversity conservation?
</STRONG>
<P>
Dr. Wilson: The US is not just a military superpower, but also an
economic and intellectual superpower.  This country has the responsibility
to lead in scientific research on biodiversity, including the
identification and assessment of the hotspots.  It should feel
an obligation to provide -- in the spirit of the 1992 Rio Conference
-- technical and economic assistance to permit maintenance of
biodiversity and economic growth in developing countries where
fauna and flora are richest and most threatened.

<P>
<STRONG>CI News: How well educated do you believe the public is about biodiversity?</STRONG>

<P>
Dr. Wilson: One of the main problems I've seen in talking to members
of Congress and the media is a lack of understanding about the
whole issue.  One recent poll revealed that only 20 percent of
Americans know what biodiversity is, and what the endangered species
issue is all about.  Of those, however, 80 percent believe this
it is matter of high priority.  This shows that at a gut level
people are in favor of environmental protection, but they don't
know enough to exert pressure on their political leaders.  This
is also where Conservation International can play a key role,
by constantly calling attention to the plight of the rest of life
that is pushed up against a wall. 

<P>
<STRONG>CI News: What can be done to raise public awareness?</STRONG>

<P>
Dr. Wilson: Drama. You have to find ways
to get people to identify emotionally with the issue.  We need
ecodrama, movies that have conservation themes and a very high
entertainment value.  We need a combination of conventional education
with every form of literary and theatrical expression that can
be brought to bear to create an emotional allegiance. I've tried
to convince other writers and creative people to bring conservation
into the popular literary culture.  It is a vast area for new
creative efforts.  A promising sign is that the younger a person
is, the more interested he or she is in natural history and conservation.
 This is evidence that already the exposure, particularly from
television, is exerting a good effect.

<P>

<STRONG>CI News: What does the future hold for global biodiversity?
</STRONG>
<P>
Dr. Wilson: During the next 50 years, we need to keep our expanding humanity from pushing the rest of life off the face of the earth. I think things are
going to come together in about 50 years, because that is probably
when human population will peak at double what it is now.  At
this time there will also be enough technology transfer around
the world to move a large part of that population toward higher
energy consumption and migration to cities.  We either will be
improving the quality of life around the world, or it will deteriorate
into a much more serious division between the haves and the have-nots.
 
<P>
<STRONG>CI News:  What needs to be done immediately?</STRONG>

<P>
Dr. Wilson: Several years ago, Peter Raven of the Missouri Botanical Institute and
I outlined a three-step approach to identifying biodiversity hotspots,
and to manage research for maximum effectiveness.  At the first
level is rapid assessment, and Conservation International should
be applauded to taking the leading role in this with its <A HREF="../../aboutci/strategy/fieldtms.htm">Rapid
Assessment Program</A>.  A second step, already underway, is to establish
research stations for studies  and long-term monitoring of biodiversity
and other aspects of the environment.  The third phase, also underway
but requiring much more time, is a global survey of biodiversity.
 Within 50 to 100 years, we could have a complete picture of the
world's fauna and flora, combined with efforts to save that biodiversity.

<P>
<STRONG>CI News:  What are the obstacles to achieving this?
</STRONG>
<P>
Dr. Wilson: Not much is being done to increase the number of scientists to conduct
the global biodiversity survey.  It isn't happening because the
federal government is just not expanding an emphasis on science.

<P>
<STRONG>CI News:  What is the role of the local people?</STRONG>

<P>
Dr. Wilson: Clearly local people must be involved.  They must have access to sustainable economic development that is not too invasive on the natural ecosystems. And in terms of pure research on biodiversity, it will be very
important for local people to be part of the process of collecting,
by working as parataxonomists.

<P>
<STRONG>CI News: Would you like to add a final message?</STRONG>

<P>Dr. Wilson:  Think about all the media attention
being given to other current issues like Bosnia.  If biodiversity
were to receive that much coverage, we wouldn't have any problems.
 The dilemma of biodiversity, in the long-term, is one of the
most relevant aspects of human existence.  The problem is people
just don't know it yet.
