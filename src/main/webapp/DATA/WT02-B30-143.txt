<FONT SIZE="+1"><STRONG>Your Advantages With a MainStay
IRA</STRONG></FONT><P>


MainStay Funds give you a combination of features and benefits that
will help you match your
savings and investment preferences with your financial goals. Here are some
of the advantages you'll
enjoy with a MainStay IRA.
<P>
<STRONG>Choice of Investments</STRONG><BR>
No two people have the same financial goals. That's why MainStay offers you
a family of Mutual Funds
for your IRA investments. These funds include stock funds, bond funds, a
money market fund, and an
equity index fund. The different investment objectives of these funds will
meet the financial goals of
virtually every investor. You can choose a single fund for your IRA, or
invest in a combination of funds.
Your Registered Representative will help you choose the MainStay Funds that
are right for you.
<P>
<STRONG>Reduce Investment Risk</STRONG><BR>
MainStay provides a convenient way for you to diversify your IRA investments
and participate in the
stock
and bond markets. Instead of purchasing a single stock or bond, when you
invest in a mutual fund, you
buy shares in a fund which consists of different types of securities. This
"diversification" may help reduce
investment risk because your investment is spread across many different
kinds of investment
opportunities which react differently in changing market conditions.
<P>
<STRONG>Flexibility</STRONG><BR>
Many IRA investments require you to lock in your money for a time. This
means that you don't have the
flexibility to change your investment as your financial goals change, or as
market conditions change. 
With MainStay, you have the freedom to move your investments from one
MainStay Fund to another
whenever you choose.  And all it takes is a toll-free telephone call!  
<P>
<STRONG>No Initial Sales Fee</STRONG><BR>
The MainStay Funds charge no initial sales fee on your contributions
(although a contingent deferred
sales charge may be imposed for early withdrawals.)  The full amount of your
contribution is invested in
your account, and goes to work for you immediately. Additionally, all
dividend and capital gains
distributions are automatically reinvested, without any charge to you.
<P>
<STRONG>Record of Investments</STRONG><BR>
Each time you contribute to your IRA, or move from one MainStay fund to
another, you'll receive a
statement confirming the transaction you made. You'll also receive a
Quarterly Statement which details
all of the transactions relating to your IRA - no matter how many MainStay
Funds you choose to invest
in. These statements will provide you with a complete record of your IRA
investments, and will help you
plan your investment strategies as your financial goals change.
<P>
<STRONG>Investment Convenience</STRONG><BR>
MainStay offers many convenient ways to invest in your IRA. After you have
established your MainStay
IRA, you can conveniently make additional contributions, up to the maximum
limit allowed, by automatic
transfer of funds from your checking or savings account.  Your Registered
Representative will help you
establish the most convenient method of contributing to your IRA.
<P>
<STRONG>Quality Service</STRONG><BR>
We know that quality service is very important to you. That's why your
Registered Representative is
trained to assist you in selecting the MainStay Funds that match your
financial goals. Additionally, a staff
of Service Representatives is always available to answer questions you may
have about your IRA. By
calling a toll-free number, you'll get all the information you need about
your MainStay IRA. You'll
discover that MainStay offers a strong commitment to provide you with
prompt, thorough, personal
service.
<P>
<STRONG>Let The Experts Manage Your Money</STRONG><BR>
When investing for your retirement, you want to be sure that your retirement
assets will receive
experienced, professional management. That's the kind of expertise you'll
receive when you invest with
MainStay.
