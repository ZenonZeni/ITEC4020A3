<H2> Rabies -- Protecting Your Family and Your Pets</H2>
</CENTER>



Raccoon rabies is a strain of rabies spread mainly by raccoons.<P>

<B>At present, raccoon rabies is not found in Ontario.</B>  However, it is just like any other rabies strain. You can protect your family and your pets from any rabies strain by observing the following rules:<P>
<UL>
<LI>Have your pets vaccinated according to instructions from your veterinarian.

<LI>Warn your children to stay away from wild or stray animals.

<LI>Raccoon-proof your home.  You may want to contact a professional for advice, or raccoon-proof your home yourself.

<LI>Take measures to discourage wild animals from taking up residence in your home or on your property.  For example, cover up potential entrances, such as uncapped chimneys, loose shingles and openings in attics, roofs and eaves.  (See Fact Sheet "Discourage Raccoons From Moving In.")

<LI>Do not attempt to trap raccoons which are causing damage to your property.  Instead, contact a professional animal control officer to remove nuisance raccoons.

<LI>Do not trap and transport nuisance raccoons to a new location.  You could help spread the disease.

<LI>Do not keep wildlife, including raccoons, as pets.  It is against the law.

<LI>Report any animals behaving strangely to your local animal control office.


<LI>Don't touch dead or sick animals.  

<LI>If you think any member of your family has been in contact with a rabid animal, immediately call your doctor or go to your local emergency care centre.
