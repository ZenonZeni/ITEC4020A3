<P>
The Australian Maritime Engineering CRC, established in July 1992, aims to be a valuable resource for Australia's maritime and offshore engineering industry. It provides support and infrastructure for co-operative research and the facility for technology exchange. Its headquarters are in Launceston and a major node is located in Melbourne.
<P>
<H3>R&D strengths</H3>
Current research programs focus on three principal areas: calm water performance of marine vehicles, ocean influence on ships and maritime structures, and structural design and fabrication of ships and maritime structures. The centre's participants are recognised world leaders in the fields of hydrodynamics, structural mechanics, geomechanics, materials technology and subsea engineering.
<P>
<H3>Commercial significance</H3>
The CRC's research has world-wide implications. A current project involving BHP Transport, Lloyd's Register of Shipping, Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries and P&O Bulk Shipping Ltd, has interim findings on extending the safe life of bulk carriers. The results were recently presented at seminars in Sydney, Tokyo and London.
Further projects of significance include wind tunnel testing of scale models to measure ship resistance, a pipeline tow-out for a large petroleum company, hydromechanic loading of a bridge structure and various other wave tank tests.
<P>
<H3>Why Victoria?</H3>
The Melbourne node is located at Monash University, Clayton Campus. The availability of world-class infrastructure such as hydrodynamic, static and dynamic structural and geomechanic testing facilities, was important in confirming the selection of Melbourne as a core research node.
<P>
<H3>Training and education</H3>
Education and training programs offered in Victoria include post graduate studies in the Engineering Faculty at Monash University, numerous short courses presented in conjunction with the Offshore Engineering Program and frequent regular in-house seminars.

<P>
<H3>Business opportunities</H3>
The combination of large multi-national companies with smaller and medium-sized enterprises provides a unique blend to the commercial base of this CRC. Participants gain valuable contacts with postgraduate and senior undergraduate students who may be potential employees and with other components of their market.
Technological benefits to business are the access to industrially driven R&D, a high-technology referral and technology transfer centre and to unique engineering testing facilities.
Other benefits may be derived through tax concessions, attraction of grants through Government Departments (particularly for smaller/medium-sized enterprises) and joint syndication of larger research projects.
<P>
<H3>Funding</H3>
Research contributions (cash and in-kind) from participants during the financial year ending July 1994 exceeded $4.9 million. Government contributions exceeded $1.8 million.
