<P><B>SUMMARY OF FINANCIAL AND OPERATING RESULTS</B>
	
<P>Net earnings for the second quarter ended June 30, 1996 were $3,879,000 ($0.02 per share), compared to $2,900,000 ($0.02 per share) in the second quarter of 1995.  Net earnings for the six month period were $10,174,000 ($0.06 per share) compared to $8,490,000 ($0.05 per share) for the first six months of 1995.  During the second quarter, the Company had gains on the disposition of minority equity investments which were primarily responsible for the other income of $2,405,000 realized in the period.

<P>Gold equivalent production for the three months ended June 30, 1996 was 95,400 ounces (76,600 ounces of gold and 1,401,500 ounces of silver) compared to 114,000 ounces (94,400 ounces of gold and 1,372,000 ounces of silver) during the same period of 1995.  Year to date production was 212,700 gold equivalent ounces compared to 216,800 gold equivalent ounces in 1995.

<P>Average realized revenue on gold equivalent sales of 103,200 ounces was $396 per ounce in the second quarter of 1996 compared to $383 per ounce on 103,000 gold equivalent ounces sold in the second quarter of 1995.

<P>Cash costs per ounce on a gold equivalent basis in the second quarter of 1996 increased over the same period of 1995 to $231 from $207.  This increase was due primarily to an ongoing shortfall in tonnage and the milling of lower grade ore at the Mineral Hill mine and a five week shut down of operations at the Casa Berardi mine stemming from a legal strike which was settled on May 27, 1996.

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=+1><B>OPERATIONS REVIEW</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P><B>LA COIPA</B>

<P>The Company's share of gold equivalent production from the La Coipa mine in the second quarter of 1996 was 45,700 ounces (26,900 ounces of gold and 1,401,500 ounces of silver) compared to 55,900 ounces (36,300 ounces of gold and 1,372,000 ounces of silver) in the  corresponding 1995 period. Cash costs on a gold equivalent per ounce basis for the period increased to $189 as compared to $156 in the same period of 1995. The increase in cash costs and the decrease in production are primarily due to unfavourable weather conditions experienced during the quarter.
    
<P><B>CRIXÁS</B>

<P>The Company's share of gold production from the Crixás mine was 15,700 ounces in the second quarter of 1996 compared to 15,700 ounces in the corresponding 1995 period. Cash costs for the period were $176 compared to $194 in the same period of 1995.  The decrease in cash costs is primarily due to ongoing efficiencies achieved at the operations and the stabilization of the Brazilian currency.

<P><B>BRASÍLIA</B>

<P>The Company's share of gold production from the Brasília mine was 13,300 ounces in the second quarter compared to 13,200 ounces in the corresponding 1995 period.   Cash costs for the period were $197 compared to $228 in the previous year.  The decrease in cash costs is attributable principally to the ongoing efficiencies realized from the introduction of the wholly owned and operated fleet of 85 tonne trucks as well as the stabilization of the Brazilian currency.

<P><B>MINERAL HILL</B>

<P>The production from the Company's Mineral Hill mine was 5,200 ounces in the second quarter compared to 8,900 ounces in the corresponding 1995 period.  Cash costs for the period were $604 compared to $341 in the corresponding 1995 period.  This decrease in production and increase in cash costs was a result of mining lower grade ore and an ongoing shortfall in mill feed from the main Mineral Hill mine.  The future operations at this property are currently being evaluated.
  
<P><B>CASA BERARDI</B>

<P>During the period, the Casa Berardi mine experienced a legal strike which commenced April 19, 1996, resulting in a shut down of production, and was settled on May 27, 1996.  The strike was resolved with the assistance of a conciliator, management and the Casa Berardi Syndicat des Metallos d'Amerique Union members.  Under the terms of the new agreement, a three year contract was accepted, effective retroactively from March 7, 1996.  The Company's share of production from the Casa Berardi mine was 9,000 ounces in the second quarter compared to 8,700 ounces in the corresponding 1995 period. Cash costs per ounce of gold for the period were $335 compared to $423 in the corresponding 1995 period.

<P><B>NEW BRITANNIA</B>

<P>The Company's share of production from the New Britannia mine was 6,500 ounces for the period.  The production rate is steadily improving as ongoing development work continues to add to the number of stopes available for production.  This development will partially offset the lower than planned ore grade currently being encountered which is expected to continue for the remainder of 1996.  To offset the lower ore grade, plans are in place to increase throughput.  It is expected that the operation will continue to show steady improvement in all key parameters for the remainder of the year.

<P><B>KASSANDRA MINES</B>

<P>Since the signing of the purchase contract in December 1995, the Company's wholly owned subsidiary, TVX Hellas A.E., has been concentrating on the comprehensive review and refurbishment of the existing operations comprised of the Olympias and Stratoni mills, the Olympias, Madem Lakkos and Mavres Petres mines and the port facility at Stratoni.  A detailed environmental review is being undertaken and remedial work is currently underway.  The retraining of existing employees is also well advanced.  To date, the basic refurbishment and upgrading of the Stratoni mill has been completed with the Madem Lakkos mine currently operating to supply feed to the Stratoni mill.  The first shipments of lead/silver and zinc concentrates occurred in July.  Subsequent to the end of the second quarter, the Greek Parliament passed the bill to ratify the Kassandra Mines purchase contract, including the related articles providing for the ratification of the 35 per cent grants from the Greek State and regulations for the timely issuance of all necessary licenses and permits in connection with the construction and operation of the gold recovery plant.

<FONT SIZE=+1><B><CENTER>DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS</CENTER></B></FONT>

<P><B>MUSSELWHITE</B>

<P>The Company and its joint venture partner, Placer Dome Canada Limited, the operator of the project, made a decision in February 1996 to construct a gold mine at the Musselwhite property at a capital cost of $190 million.  Construction work commenced during the quarter with the first major concrete pour of the milling facility building foundation.  Exploration work at the southern portion of the T-Antiform deposit and the Island and Pebble zones is ongoing with the objective of identifying readily accessible mineable resources to supplement initial mill feed for the project.  Production is expected to commence in the second quarter of 1997.

<P><B>KASPERSKE HORY</B>

<P>During the second quarter, underground exploration work continued at TVX Gold's 100% owned Kasperske Hory project with the goals of adding additional ounces to the resource outlined in 1995 and further delineating the mineralization discovered to date.  Within the Golden Creek deposit, 240 metres of underground development and 5,470 metres of diamond drilling were completed.  Underground drilling continues to confirm the presence of auriferous mineralization.  Approximately 200 metres of development and 6,000 metres of diamond drilling remain to be completed during the 1996 exploration program.  A large percentage of this effort will be directed towards increasing the known resource base by drilling along strike to the west of the known mineralization.  

<P><B>PACHICUTZA</B>

<P>At the Company's Pachicutza project in Ecuador, the adit drive continued during the quarter allowing for further development and underground exploration work.  Underground development work continues to outline major vein systems as anticipated.  Reserve analysis along with engineering studies are underway and the definition of the reserves and completion of the engineering studies is expected in the fourth quarter.

<HR>

<FONT SIZE=+1><CENTER><B>LIQUIDITY AND CASH FLOW</B></CENTER></FONT>

<P>Cash flow provided by operating activities in the second quarter of 1996 was $3.9 million, down from $5.2 million in the corresponding period in 1995, primarily as a result of higher cash operating costs.

<P>Investing activities for mining properties, plant and equipment increased to $32.1 million from $18.8 million in the corresponding period in 1995 due to spending at the Kassandra Mines and the development of the Musselwhite mine.  The Company had a net outflow of $6.3 million in connection with the acquisition of equity investments including an interest in Valerie Gold Resources Ltd.

<P>Financing activities utilized $6.0 million in the quarter as compared to $9.1 million in the corresponding 1995 period, primarily as a result of the final loan payment made on the La Coipa project loan.
