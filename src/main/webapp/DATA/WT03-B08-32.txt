New Resin
Grades Debut

Special acrylics, high-clarity ABS, post-autoclave toughened
polyolefins and gamma-radiation resistant PVC are examples of
recent production introductions.

ICI Acrylics Inc.'s (10091 Manchester Road, St. Louis, MO 63122;
Tel: 314/966-3111) Polymer Division has introduced a new grade of
Perspex for medical fluid diagnostic applications. The DP-356 UVT
product is a highly specialized acrylic polymer for disposable
medical devices where maximum degree of optical clarity is needed,
including blood cuvettes and products for blood and fluid analysis.
Tests show a luminous transmittance of 92%, a tensile strength of
10,000 psi, and injection-molding flow of 13 g/10 min.

Lustran ABS 266 Mediclear, from Bayer Corp. (100 Bayer Road,
Pittsburgh, PA 15205; Tel: 412/777-2000) offers clarity and
toughness with easy processing and resists deterioration caused by
chemicals commonly used in medical devices.  The high-clarity
material follows the trend toward increased use of medical devices
at home, which involves self-administration and monitoring of
performance by patients themselves.

Lustran ABS 266, containing methyl methacrylate, meets FDA USP
class VI requirements; after sterilization by gamma radiation,
samples of the new grade show negligible deterioration.  The
material, providing (for a 1/8-inch specimen) an Izod impact
strength of 3.25 ft-lbs/inch per ASTM D-256, has been qualified by
Burron OEM Division of Braun Medical Inc., a manufacturer of
components and assemblies, including valves, transfer and filter
devices, fluid-administration systems, balloon catheters, and trays
and kits.

A polyolefin resin recently introduced by Montell Polyolefins (2801
Centerville Road, Wilmington, DE 19850; Tel: 302/996-6000), KS-
029P, which is manufactured by the company's Catalloy multistage
gas-phase polymerization/special catalyst process, is suitable for
blown-film applications requiring toughness after autoclaving or
exposure to gamma radiation.  Other applications for polypropylene
resins in the medical industry reported by Montell include
syringes, labware, biohazard bags, laminated thermal blankets,
medical bags, surgical drapes and gowns, and other disposables that
utilize the material's sterilizability, contact clarity, moisture
barrier, chemical resistance, strength, and heat resistance.

New gamma radiation-resistant flexible PVC compounds from Teknor
Apex Co's Plastics Division (505 Central Ave., Pawtucket, RI 02801;
Tel: 401/725-8000) offer improved color stability for medical
applications.  The APEX 90-A471R-NT PVC products, formulated to
withstand up to 10 megarads of gamma radiation with minimum color
shifting, more effectively maintain their light blue tint. The
gamma radiation is generally used for one-time preuse sterilization
of disposable medical devices.  Applications for the new products
include infusion kits, drip chambers, kidney-dialysis kits, and
intravenous solution systems.

Standard Tests
on the Way

The Sterilization Packaging Manufacturers Council, working with the
Flexible Packaging Association (1090 Vermont Ave. N.W., Washington
D.C. 20005; Tel: 202/842-3880) is trying to clarify existing test
methods and create new versions to keep pace with the demands being
placed on flexible sterilized medical packaging.

The current test method on seal integrity does not differentiate
between energy required to destroy or open the seal. Test methods
are also being created to focus on differences between laboratory
and production tests.  The role pressure plays in seal quality is
also an issue receiving attention.

Several of the completed test methods are based on ASTM standards,
which include seal strength, inflation testing (burst and creep),
and peel strength. The Council is also working on test methods for
visual seal inspection, porosity, and coat weight determination.

Polyimide Tubes
Finding Medical Uses

Micro-Biomedical Tubing Inc. (410A Old Mill Road, Carterville, GA
30120; Tel: 770/606-0003), a manufacturer of miniature catheter
tubing and electrical sleeving, has introduced a line of polyimide
tubing composites that offer a wide range of construction and
composition options for medical and electronic applications.

The LubriFlex, LubriBraid, and LubriCoil products offer inside
diameters of 0.0050 to 0.0925 inches and can be custom manufactured
to meet specific requirements. LubriFlex can be made with and
without Teflon layers in a variety of compositions; LubriBraid is
reinforced with a wire or fiber braid in the tubing wall; and
LubriCoil is reinforced with a wire or fiber coil.  The wire or
fiber braids and coils offer various degrees of stiffness, shock
absorption, longitudinal elongation, and resistance to burst
pressure.

All three tubing systems can be produced with Teflon on the inside
or outside walls or sandwiched between layers.  Fillers can be
added for improved performance or resistance to wear and abrasion.
According to the company, the products offer increased lubricity,
softness, and flexibility over conventional tubing.

Porosity of Nylon
Films Measured

Nylon 610 films show promise for use in drug encapsulation.  Ken
Phares, M. Cho, Keith Johnson, and James Swarbrick of the
Pharmaceutical Dept. at the University of North Carolina (Chapel
Hill, NC 27599-7360; Tel: 919/962-2211) have investigated drug
transport through artificial membrane films composed of Nylon 610.

Nylon 610 is a hydrophilic polymer.  The researchers synthesized
the polymer using an interfacial polycondensation reaction.
Hexamethylenediamine, which readily partitions into a good solvent,
and sebacoyl chloride were used.  The sebacoyl chloride was a
solvent blend of chloroform and trichlorotrifluoroethane in varying
ratios (1:1, 1:4, 4:1).  Phares and coworkers observed that the use
of hexamethylenediamine allows the formation of a high molecular
weight polymer before precipitation.

The films resulting from these synthesis variables were
characterized on the basis of porosity, thickness, molecular
weight, and crystallinity.  Transport of potassium chloride,
hydrocortisone, and m-creosol were measured for the different
films.  Chloroform concentration was found to be the most important
factor in the resulting molecular weight of the film.  With an
increase in molecular weight, increases were observed in film
thickness, porosity, and hydrocortisone permeability.  As the
molecular weight decreased, permeability to m-creosol increased.

Phares and colleagues published "Drug Transport Across Nylon 610
Films:  Influence of Synthesis Variables" in Pharmaceutical
Research [12(2), 248-256, 1995].  According to Phares, their
subsequent work with Nylon 610 microspheres will be published in
1996 in the International Journal of Pharmaceutical Advances. Since
the publication of the article, Ken Phares and James Swarbrick have
left UNC to work with Applied Analytical Industries (1206 N. 23rd
St., Wilmington, DE 28405; Tel: 910/251-6383). Phares continues his
research on drug transport, but focusing on concerns other than
Nylon 610.

ProCyte Moves into
Moist Dressings

ProCyte Corp. (12040 115th Ave., Kirkland, WA 98034; Tel: 206/820-
4548) acquired from Hymedix International (2235 Route 130, Dayton,
NJ 08810; Tel: 908/274-2288) worldwide rights outside of Asia to
five wound-care products that have received market clearance from
the FDA, broadening the company's planned entry into the moist-
wound dressing market.

The products include proprietary transparent thin-film wound
dressings, aquagel sheet dressings, exudate absorbers, and wound
moisturizers, all based on a multi-block copolymer structures that
are especially well-suited for wound-care applications, including
chronic and acute wounds, burns, and surgical wounds, according to
ProCyte.

The company said that the newly licensed products complement its
internationally-developed Iamin gel wound dressing, for which FDA
clearance to market is pending under the 510(k) pre-market
notification guidelines. ProCyte said it expects the first of its
wound-care products to be available to long-term care, hospital,
and home health-care professionals by mid-1996, following equipment
scale-up and design and validation of improved manufacturing
processes at its Redmond, WA, commercial manufacturing plant.

The U.S. market for moist-wound dressings, which include the
polymer-based products ProCyte acquired, is expected to reach $500
million by 1999.  Industry sources say market growth for moist-
wound dressings and all other wound-care products and systems is
being driven by an increasing incidence of wounds associated with
advanced age, during which surgeries and chronic wounds tend to
occur more frequently.

Centerpiece for ProCyte's newly-acquired products is a versatile
polymer technology, called HYPAN, manufactured by a patented method
to provide a uniquely variable number of structural aquagels,
useful in construction of synthetic moist-wound dressings and
related products. ProCyte also has the worldwide rights outside of
Asia for all future wound-care applications of HYPAN technology for
synthetic moist-wound dressings and related products.

As part of its agreement with Hymedix, ProCyte also gained
exclusive worldwide rights for drug-delivery applications of the
HYPAN technology for wound care.  ProCyte plans to continue its
research and development efforts in wound treatment and healing and
to study drug-delivery aspects of technology for enhanced delivery
of antibiotics, anti-infectives, and other compounds to wounds.

HYPAN polymers are synthetic materials that ProCyte believes can be
manufactured in a cost-effective manner. The products are believed
to provide maximum performance at low concentrations, to have
excellent biocompatibility profiles, and to be both stable and
sterilizable.  The structural flexibility of these aquagels is
expected to make them ideally suited to broad-based applications in
wound management and treatment, particularly since they address the
breadth of chronic and acute wounds.

Now Bioabsorbable
Elastomers Are Here

Elastomers have been extensively used in medical devices,
especially thermoplastic copolyesters (COPEs) and thermoplastic
polyurethanes (TPUs). The copolyester elastomers are polymers with
"hard" and "soft" segments. While commercial viability of
elastomeric polymers for medical applications has been established,
a need exists for certain properties that have not yet been met.

For numerous applications, especially for those requiring a
surgical device to be implanted in bodily tissue, the polymer from
which the device is prepared must be bioabsorbable.  Ethicon Inc.
(U.S. Highway 22, Somerville, NJ 08876; Tel: 908/218-0707) has
developed bioabsorbable elastomers made up of random copolymers as
reported in U.S. Patent 5,468,253.

These copolymers consist of:
    epsilon-caprolactone, trimethylene carbonate, an ether lactone
or a mixture of these; and
    the balance being substantially glycolide, para-dioxanone, or
a mixture of these.

The random copolymers surprisingly exhibit elastomeric properties,
and the copolymers are bioabsorbable.  Combination of physical and
biological properties of these elastomeric copolymers are
particularly well-suited for numerous medical and surgical
applications.

Complete bioabsorption should take place within 12 months, although
preferably bioabsorption will be complete within nine months and
most preferably within six months.  In this manner, the elastomer
can be fabricated into medical and surgical devices that are useful
for a vast array of applications requiring complete absorption
within the relatively short time periods set forth.

Biological properties of the bioabsorbable elastomer used to form
the device or part thereof, as measured by its absorption rate and
its breaking strength retention in vivo, can be varied to suit
needs of particular application for which fabricated medical device
or component is intended.  This can be conveniently accomplished by
varying ratio of components of the elastomeric copolymer chosen.

Dry Coating Improves
Implant Properties

Medical device manufacturers prefer using polymeric materials for
making implants, such as cannulae, needles, catheters, percutaneous
connectors, and the like. Polymeric implants have, however, brought
about several complications, especially thrombophlebitis and
sepsis.  Some workers in the field have investigated the use and
beneficial effect of an in-line filter in reducing infusion-
associated infection, in particular phlebitis.  However, others
have focused on the material of the cannula itself.

It has been shown that steel needles produce fewer infusion-
associated complications that do plastic cannulae.  The issue is
how to advantageously use the desirable bulk property of polymeric
implants -- flexibility, avoiding infiltration without adversely
affecting the patient by exposing him or her to increased risk of
infusion-associated phlebitis, and infection.

Spire Corp. (1 Patriots Park, Bedford, MA 01739; Tel: 617/275-7470)
recently won a patent (U.S. No. 5,468,562) for imparting a thin
metallic film to outside surfaces of polymeric implants. Apparatus
includes a vacuum chamber, an evaporator and an ion source mounted
in operative association within the chamber.

The patent claims improved biocompatibility between implant and
body.  Metal films include chromium and titanium with thicknesses
of 0.5 microns.  Claims are also made for use of other metals for
biomedical devices (implants) such as silver, zirconium, tantalum,
aluminum, nickel, molybdenum, platinum, gold, and stainless steel.

On-Line Plasma
Sampling Developed

Often a need exists to sample and analyze the plasma constituent of
blood without affecting other constituents.  For example, end-stage
renal disease ("ESRD") patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis
treatments at home presently send blood samples to laboratories for
analysis.

The blood sample is analyzed for general chemistry profiles (e.g.
electrolyte, plasma hemoglobin, total protein, albumin, and
immunoglobin concentrations).  Sending out blood samples is tedious
and involves a significant loss of the ESRD patient's blood cells.
Since ESRD patients are typically anemic, a further loss of red
blood cells compounds their anemic condition.

Presently, ESRD patients either ignore the problem of further
blood-cell loss altogether or endure a complicated procedure
whereby  blood cells withdrawn with a sample are salvaged.

Since for a large proportion of diagnostic procedures a plasma
sample is all that is necessary, a need exists for an inexpensive
means for collecting a plasma sample without contributing to
further blood loss of an ESRD patient.

University of Utah (Salt Lake City, UT 84112; Tel: 801/581-7200)
researchers have developed an extracorporeal plasm filter
comprising a housing, an inlet, an outlet, and a sampling port and
containing at least a hollow semi-permeable filter fiber through
which blood plasma, but not whole blood, may pass.

U.S. Patent 5,464,535 has been granted to Udipi Shettigar for this
filter, which is constructed so that a heterogenous fluid, such as
blood, entering the inlet passes into the first open end of the
hollow filter fiber and through the fiber.  A portion of the fluid
(e.g. a filtrate or diffusate) permeates the semi-permeable portion
of fiber to collect within the housing.  The collected portion may
then be sampled from the sampling port.

The filter will usually be structured with a plurality of hollow
fibers comprising a filter fiber bundle.  These fibers are attached
one to another near their respective ends, e.g. by gluing.

Lab-Grown Cartilage
Ok'd for Compensation

The Florida State Agency for Health Care Administration has
approved Carticel surgery, an innovative technique utilizing lab-
grown cartilage cells, for Workers Compensation benefits, according
to Dr. Douglas Stringham, the first orthopedic surgeon in Florida
and one of only 15 surgeons in the country to have performed the
specialized surgery.

"This procedure is supported in the medical literature by basic
scientific research, and we've concluded that it is not
experimental and that there are likely to be significant positive
benefits of this procedure to recovery and well-being of the
injured worker," said Suzanne Suarez, senior health policy analyst
for the agency.

"This decision sets a precedent for all of Florida," said
Stringham. "We invested a considerable amount of time and energy
investigating, evaluating, and establishing the procedure as a
recommended and appropriate treatment for a defined group of
patients suffering cartilage injury."

Bill Aliski, vice president of patient and product services at
Genzyme Tissue Repair (1 Kendall Square, Cambridge, MA 01239; Tel:
617/252-7500) the lab where the cartilage cells are grown,
responded, "We are very pleased with the decision of the Workers
Compensation Division.  The board has recognized the value of the
Carticel procedure and confirms the medical opinion of the surgeon.
While this is a first in Florida, other favorable coverage
decisions for Carticel are expected in the future."

The technique, pioneered in Sweden by Dr.Lars Peterson, involves
removing a very small piece of healthy cartilage, growing the
cartilage cells in tissue cultures for several weeks, and then
reinjecting them back into the damaged area.  In time, the
transplanted cells heal the defect with cartilage that is
essentially indistinguishable from the original normal cartilage.

Left untreated, significant cartilage defects progressively
enlarge, leading to career-ending injuries for athletes and loss-
of-job disabilities for workers.  Eventually, untreated defects may
develop into painful arthritis that often requires joint
replacement.

Engineered Heart
Valves Promising

Advanced Tissue Sciences Inc. (10933 N. Torrey Pines, La Jolla, CA
92037; Tel: 619/450-5730) announced preclinical data on tissue-
engineered heart valves at a recent session of the American Heart
Association.

Current therapy for valvular heart disease includes replacement of
heart valves with porcine xenografts, cryopreserved cadaver, or
mechanical valves.  Advanced Tissue Sciences is utilizing its core
technology to develop tissue-engineered heart valves with improved
function and durability in order to overcome disadvantages of
current therapy.

Dr. Shin'oka, a fellow in the department of cardiovascular surgery
at Boston's Children's Hospital (300 Longwood Ave., Boston, MA
02115; Tel: 617/735-6000) and a collaborator with Advanced Tissue
Sciences, presented data that demonstrated feasibility of utilizing
tissue engineering to create heart-valve replacement products.

Dr. Skin'oka reported that tissue-engineered valve leaflets were
made by seeding a synthetic biodegradable fiber matrix with
fibroblasts and endothelial cells.  Leaflets were then implanted in
large animals, which were followed for up to six weeks.  Total
protein and collagen analysis of tissue-engineered heart-valve
leaflets showed development of an extracellular matrix and
histologies of the constructs resembled native tissue.  Angiography
and echocardiography demonstrated no stenosis and a minimal
valvular regurgitation.

Dr. Zeltinger presented studies that characterized deposition of
human-specific extracellular matrix proteins in porcine heart
valves colonized with human neonatal fibroblasts and grown under
dynamic flow conditions.  Long-term growth studies indicated
excellent migration and viability throughout the newly deposited
matrix, demonstrating the feasibility of utilizing tissue-
engineering techniques to create heart valves.

Microsphere Drug
Device That Works

Currently systemic antibiotic therapy by intravenous or
intramuscular injection is the clinically accepted standard for
prevention and treatment of infected surgical and traumatic wounds.
Systemic administration of antibiotics is recognized as an
inherently inefficient method for delivering drugs because only a
small fraction of total dose actually reaches target area and most
of the drug is excreted unused.

Recently, microencapsulated antibiotics have been developed based
on lactic and/or glycolic acid-based biodegradable polymers. These
microcapsules are either injected or layered on to the wound.
Uneven drug distribution is often the result.  The injection route
is also only suitable for the area that the needle can traverse.

Jean Setterstrom, Elliot Jacob, and Walter Franz received U.S.
Patent 5,470,311 for apparatus and methods for dispensing
medicinals encapsulated in a biodegradable polymer in surgical and
other wounds. In this procedure, a microcapsule drug applicator
allows the caregiver to implant or spread measured and uniform
quantities of microencapsulated medicinals in or on surgical or
traumatic wounds to prevent or treat infections.

Specific examples where microencapsulated antibiotics may prove
useful include soft-tissue wounds, following debridement and
reduction or fixation of open fractures, onto osteomyelitic bone
after surgical debridement, after surgical insertion of prostheses
such as hip/knee replacements (arthroplasty), and following
vascular surgery or grafting.

Local implantation of microencapsulated antibiotics can provide a
significantly higher local concentration of medication at the wound
site then can be obtained using traditional systemic therapy and
offers the possibility of producing significantly reduced side
effects.

In addition to antibiotics, other drugs and biological agents may
be encapsulated and administered in a similar fashion.  Such
medicinals include  steroids, narcotic antagonists,  local
anesthetics, growth factors,  anti-cancer agents, and  non-
steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.

The microsphere application comprises two basic units: A drug
container or vial that contains microspheres, and a unit that
generates the nebulizing gas stream required to spray or propel
microspheres contained in vial (ital.???) onto the area to be
treated.

Oscillator Changes
pH to Release Drug

Scientists at the Ciba-Geigy Corp. (444 Saw Mill River Road,
Ardsley, NY 10502; Tel: 914/479-5000, Fax: 914/478-1201) are
developing a novel approach to drug delivery that uses a pH
oscillator.  Only the uncharged form of a drug can cross over
lipophilic membranes.  This device changes the pH of a solution to
charge or uncharge a drug.  In this way, the release of a drug can
be controlled.  An advantage of this system is that it does not
require external power sources or electronic controllers. For the
study, the scientists used a mixed Landoldt pH oscillator to study
diffusion of nicotine or benzoic acid across a membrane.

Probes Deliver
Drugs to Eyes

Drugs are unable to perfuse well from the blood into the eye, and
doctors must give patients very large amounts of systemic
medications in order to treat eye diseases.  With certain drugs,
such high concentrations in the body increase the risk of toxic
effects.  Scientists are trying to develop polymer devices that can
deliver drugs directly into the eye.  In this study, polycarbonate
and polyamide membranes were investigated for suitability.

Three classes of drugs were studied for their ability to perfuse
from the microdialysis membranes:  antibiotics, corticosteroids,
and cytostatic agents.  In addition, substances of varying
molecular weights were studied.  Earlier studies had shown that
some lipophilic drugs stick to polycarbonate polymer devices, but
this study did not reveal any differences between the two polymers.
All the study substances dialyzed through the implanted
microdialysis membranes.  The shape of the probe was found to
affect its dialyzing action.

Pulmonary-Flow Sensing
Technology Patented

Aradigm Corp. (26219 Eden Landing Road, Hayward, CA 94445; Tel:
510/783-0100) was awarded U.S. Patent 5,469,750 covering flow-
sensing technology used in its pulmonary drug-delivery systems to
ensure reproducible delivery of aerosolized drugs.  The patent,
"Method and Apparatus for Sensing Flow in Two Directions and
Automatic Calibration Thereof," further strengthens Aradigm's
patent portfolio, which protects methods and systems for efficient
and consistent delivery of a broad range of drugs.

Aradigm's microprocessor-controlled devices are capable of making
precise quantitative measurements of a patient's inspiratory flow
rate and volume in order to deliver consistent doses of aerosolized
medication to the lungs.  The system's flow sensors measure a
patient's inhalation characteristics and send digital signals to a
microprocessor, which selects the appropriate point to
automatically release an aerosolized drug dose for treatment of
respiratory disease or for systemic effect.

Aradigm is developing two aerosol drug-delivery platforms.  The
handheld, microprocessor-controlled devices are intended to deliver
reproducible doses of wide range of small and macromolecular drugs.

The SmartMist Asthma Management System was designed to deliver more
consistent doses of aerosol medications from standard metered-dose
inhaler canisters.  The AERx Pulmonary Drug Delivery System was
developed to deliver aerosols created from liquid drug
formulations, many of which currently are available only by
injection.

Channel Blocker
Dosage Automated

A prospective, randomized hypertension study will determine whether
a novel verapamil calcium channel blocker is as effective as the
"first-line standard of care" regimen (diuretic or beta blocker)
recommended by the Joint National Committee on Detection,
Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC V) in the
primary prevention of cardiovascular complications including heart
attacks, strokes, and death in 15,000 patients followed over a
four-to-six-year period.

Dr. Henry Black, chairman of the Department of Preventive Medicine
at Rush Presbyterian-St. Luke's Medical Center (1653 W. Congress
Pkwy., Chicago, IL 60612; Tel: 312/942-5000) and the trial's
principal investigator, announced the beginning of the study with
representatives from G.A. Searle Inc. (5200 Old Orchard Road,
Skokie, IL 60077; Tel:708/470-6728).

Cover-HS, the calcium channel blocker to be used in the Searle-
sponsored trial, incorporates a novel, controlled-onset, extended-
release COER-24 delivery system and is currently under review by
the FDA for treatment of hypertension and angina.

Taken at bedtime, Covera-HS is designed to lower blood pressure by
releasing active drugs in concert with the body's natural circadian
rhythms.  Since blood pressure commonly follows a circadian
pattern, dropping at night and rising in early morning, Covera-HS'
COER-24 delivery system was developed to deliver peak
concentrations of the drug when blood pressure tends to be highest
-- in the hours just before and after awakening.

"We know that as blood pressure rises, risk of suffering myocardial
infarction is generally highest within the six-hour period after
waking," Black explained.  "This large-scale trial will determine
whether treatment with Covera-HS, which delivers higher dosages of
calcium channel blocker at time of greatest risk, will be
equivalent to standard of care in decreasing risk of fatal and non-
fatal heart attack and stroke in patients with mild to moderate
hypertension," he said.

"This study could provide substantial new information on how we
should manage hypertension and perhaps change our way of thinking
with respect to which antihypertensives should be used and when,"
he said.

In addition to primary endpoint, the trial will look for treatment
differences in other endpoints associated with hypertension, such
as death from any cause and the development of congestive heart
failure requiring hospitalization.

Patch Alternative to
Hormone Replacement

SmithKline Beecham (1 Franklin Plaza, Philadelphia, PA 19101; Tel:
215/751-4000) and Theratech Inc. (417 Wakara Way, Salt Lake City,
UT 84108; Tel: 801/583-6023) announced that Androderm (Testerone
Transdermal System) is now available nationwide.  Adroderm is a
treatment for men suffering from hypogonadism, a condition in which
the body produces insufficient levels of testosterone.  The
product, available only by a doctor's prescription, was cleared for
marketing by the FDA.

Only about five percent of the estimated four to five million
American men of all ages with hypogonadism currently receive
testosterone-replacement therapy (TRT). "The currently available
choices given hypogonadal men in need of testosterone-replacement
therapy have been less than ideal," said Daniel Tasse, vice
president and director, endocrine and oncology products, SmithKline
Beecham. "Androderm will fill a distinct need in the area of
hormone-replacement therapy for men."

Overall, treatment with Androderm resulted in normalization of
morning testosterone levels in 92% of the 94 patients who completed
the trials.  In a key eight-week study of 29 patients who were
withdrawn from their previous testosterone-replacement therapy,
Androderm produced improvements in erectile function, libido and
mood, and decreases in complaints of fatigue.

Hypogonadism may be caused by conditions of the testes (such as
testicular injury, infection, or Klinefelter's syndrome, a
chromosomal abnormality), or disorders of the pituitary and
hypothalamus.

Test Measures
Bone-Collagen Loss

Metra Biosystems Inc. (265 N. Whisman Road, Mountain View, CA
94093; Tel: 415/903-9100) received FDA market clearance for its two
Pyrilinks urine-based assays that provide a quantitative measure of
excretion of pyridinium crosslinks as a indicator of type I
collagen resorption, especially bone collagen.  This provides
measurement of bone-collagen breakdown, which, when elevated, leads
to bone loss.

Bone is made up of a complex collagen matrix that is constantly
built up by cells called osteoblasts and broken down by cells
called osteoclasts.  In this process of bone turnover, osteoclasts
release pyridinium crosslinks (Pyd and Dpd) into urine that can be
quantitatively measured by Pyrilinks assays.

Alkphase-B, another Metra test previously cleared by the FDA,
measures alkaline phosphatase, a by-product of osteoblasts present
in blood.  When the rate of bone breakdown (loss) exceeds rate of
formation, total bone mass decreases.

Currently there are no commercially available products to rebuild
bone once it is lost.  For this reason, in diseases like
osteoporosis, it is exceedingly important to identify individuals
at risk and to act early and definitively.  Bone loss can be
controlled through use of a number of therapies including hormone
replacement, bisphosphonates, and calcitonin.

Pyrilinks values reflect level of bone-collagen loss as impacted by
such factors as low estrogen production, low calcium intake, low
physical activity, or diseases known to affect bone metabolism such
as osteoporosis, Paget's disease, hyperparathyroidism,
hyperthyroidism, and bone metastases.  As with all diagnostic
tests, Pyrilinks results should be interpreted in conjunction with
clinical findings and other diagnostic results. As the FDA has
stated, markers like Pyrilinks are needed if anti-resorptive
therapies -- such as those used to fight osteoporosis -- are to
increase in use and be used successfully," said George W. Dunbar,
president and CEO of Metra Biosystems.

Metra Biosystems has developed a panel of six biochemical bone
markers to help physicians more precisely assess a patient's bone
turnover.  Bone metabolism normally stays in careful balance,
maintaining healthy, strong bones.  Prolagen-C and NovoCalcin
assess bone and collagen formation.  Pyrilinks-D (currently under
review by the FDA), NovoCalcin, and Prolagen-C are available for
research use in the U.S. Metra's panel is available for clinical
use abroad.

Heart Attacks
Diagnosed at Bedside

Boehringer Mannheim Diagnostics (9115 Hague Road, Indianapolis, IN
46250; Tel: 317/576-3914) received marketing clearance from the FDA
for a new rapid bedside assay that helps physicians diagnose
myocardial infarction.  The easy-to-use assay is based on the
company's proprietary marker--cardiac troponin T. It is located
inside cardiac muscle and is released into blood only when cells
are damaged.  In the U.S., Boehringer Mannheim has marketed an
ELISA version of the assay on its ES 300 immunoassay system since
June 1994.

The Cardiac T Rapid Assay is a self-contained, disposable unit
approximately four inches long, less than an inch wide, and only a
quarter of an inch thick.  Drops of blood are placed in a well on
the device and are quickly drawn into a sandwich assay impregnated
with two distinct types of monoclonal antibodies that link to
cardiac troponin T in the sample, resulting in a visible color
change.  A red control line appears to verify that the test is
working properly, and if the sample contains cardiac troponin T, a
second red line appears to alert the physician, nurse, or
laboratory specialist.

Meanwhile, researchers from Brigham and Women's Hospital reported
that elevated levels of Cardiac Specific Troponin-I predict an
increased mortality risk and may play a role in identifying
patients appropriate for early invasive treatment.  The study is
the largest to investigate the role of Cardiac Specific Troponin-I
in predicting mortality risk.

Investigators examined multiple blood specimens from 1,470 patients
with unstable angina who were enrolled in the National Institute of
Health's Thrombolytic and Myocardial Infarction Study (TIMI-IIIB).
Cardiac Specific Troponin-I was measured to identify those patients
appropriate for early invasive therapy, such as early
catheterization and revascularization.

Results indicated that Cardiac Specific Troponin-I levels greater
than 0.4 ng/ml predicted a significantly increased mortality by 42
days.  Conversely, Cardiac Specific Troponin-I levels less than 0.4
ng/ml were predictive of a low risk of mortality.  The study found
that for every ng/ml elevation of cardiac troponin-I, a patient's
mortality risk increased 10%. Patients with an elevated cardiac
troponin-I level experienced a significantly improved survival rate
when they underwent an early invasive versus a conservative
strategy.

"For the first time, a blood test is available that identifies
patients with unstable angina who are an increased risk of
mortality," said Dr. Elliot Antman, lead investigator of the study,
director of Coronary Care, and associate professor of medicine at
Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School (25
Shattuck Ave., Boston, MA 02115; Tel: 617/495-1000).

Simultaneous Assay for
Chlamydia, Gonorrhea

Gen-Probe Inc. (9880 Campus Point Drive, San Diego, CA 92121-1589;
Tel: 619/546-8000) now markets PACE 2C, a new version of the PACE
2 assay for simultaneous diagnosis of the two most common sexually
transmitted diseases in the U.S.  PACE 2 and PACE 2C detect the
presence of ribosomal RNA for Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria
gonorrhoeae, the organisms responsible for chlamydia and gonorrhea
infections.

According to Craig S. Hill, manager of scientific affairs at Gen-
Probe, infection with both diseases simultaneously is "quite
common"; as many as 50% of patients who have gonorrhea infections
are also infected with chlamydia.  The PACE 2 and PACE 2C assays
offer the advantage of diagnosing both infections as part of the
same procedure. Traditional laboratory tests for gonorrhea require
a bacterial culture, while chlamydia detection relies on cell
culture.  Both methods have limitations not experienced with the
PACE 2 and PACE 2C assays.  Immunoassays have also been used to
detect these sexually transmitted diseases, but they cannot detect
the presence of both infections in a single sample or assay.

First introduced in 1990, the PACE 2 assay relies on DNA probes
that are labeled with acridinium ester, which can detect the
ribosomal RNA of the disease organisms.  One sample from the
patient is all that is needed to test for both organisms.  If the
disease organism is present, the DNA probes hybridize to the target
ribosomal RNA, and the results can be obtained within 2.5 hours by
measuring the signal (measured in relative light units).

According to Hill, the PACE 2 assay is "the most widely used
nonculture [chlamydia and gonorrhea] assay in the U.S."  The PACE
2C assay can detect the disease organisms from a single sample, as
well as in a single test tube.  If a positive signal results from
this assay, a second assay can determine which of the organisms is
present.

In one investigation, sensitivity of the PACE 2C assay was 96.3%,
while specificity was 98.8%.  Sensitivity and specificity of the
PACE 2 assay for chlamydia are 93% and 99%, respectively.  The
sensitivity and specificity of the PACE 2 assay for gonorrhea are
95% and 99%, respectively.  By comparison, the sensitivity of
culture methods may be as low as 88.9%.

Hepatitis Serotyping
Test Launched

International Murex Technologies (3075 Northwoods Circle, Norcross,
GA 30071; Tel: 770/662-0660) has commercialized its second-
generation assay for serological genotyping of Hepatitis C (HCV).

The Murex HCV Serotyping (1-6) assay is a simple, enzyme
immunoassay that identifies whether a patient is infected with HCV
types 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.  This second-generation test is the only
commercial assay to cover HCV types 1-6, according to the company.
The test will initially be marketed to clinicians and research,
clinical, and private laboratories outside the United States.  The
product has already been registered for in vitro diagnostic use in
France.

Murex launched its first-generation serotyping test identifying
types 1, 2, and 3 in November 1994.  Prior to that introduction,
HCV typing was restricted to certain laboratories where genotyping
could be performed by complex, laborious procedures involving DNA
amplification technology.  This seriously limited investigations
into the disease.  In contrast, the Murex HCV Serotyping (1-6) test
is suitable for use in any laboratory as no specialist skills or
facilities are required.

The launch of Murex HCV Serotyping (1-6) test will now allow
meaningful research into significance of different HCV types and
will greatly assist in development of appropriate patient-
management strategies. HCV type is a key factor in determining
patient response to antiviral therapy; it is critical to determine
HCV type so that the patient may receive the most appropriate
therapy.

The Murex HCV Serotyping (1-6) test utilizes synthetic peptides
representing variable antigenic regions from NS4 of HCV types 1
through 6.  Differential response of patient antibodies to these
regions of NS4 enables the test to identify HCV types in infected
patients.

Bladder Cancer
Test Available

Maritech Inc. (330 Nevada St., Newton, MA 02160; Tel: 617/928-0820)
received conditional approval from FDA's Immunology Devices Panel
of the Medical Devices Advisory Committee for its "Maritech NMP22
Test Kit."

The Panel voted that the FDA should approve the product for use in
identifying patients at risk of recurrence, with the condition that
the company provide data on an additional number of certain
subjects.  Another Panel hearing will not be necessary, but the
company must provide these data in order to obtain approval to
market from the FDA.

Maritech is presently studying the FDA's request for additional
data in order to provide it as promptly as possible.  NMP22 is the
first Nuclear Matrix Protein-based diagnostic product to be
reviewed by the FDA for sale in the U.S.

Now being sold in Europe, the "Matritech NMP22 Test Kit" is twice
as sensitive as urine cytology and is a painless, low-cost, highly
accurate tool for management of transitional cell carcinoma of the
urinary tract (TCC/UT), which accounts for more than 90% of bladder
cancer.

The Maritech NMP22 Test Kit's enabling technology is based on a
fundamental breakthrough in cell biology discovered at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), where researchers
found that nuclear matrix proteins (NMPs) in cancer cells differ
from those in normal cells.  MIT obtained patents covering the use
of NMPs to detect cancer and licensed their discovery worldwide,
exclusively, to Matritech.

While Lamm anticipates that other urologists will embrace a more
accurate and painless alternative to current testing options, they
also noted that Matritech's urine assay will offer patients
significant savings.  For example, invasive cystoscopy often costs
about $300.  Matritech estimates the NMP22 Test Kit will sell for
between $40 and $50 per test.

Adcon-L involving 254 patients at nine academic medical centers in
Europe.  Results of this study demonstrated that Adcon-L
signifiq9ntly reduced incidence of peridural fibrosis and related
clinical symptoms following lumbar discectomy surgery, according to
Gliatech.

Gliatech is currently marketing two Adcon products, Adcon-L and
Adcon-T/N, in France and The Netherlands, based on previous
national laws, prior to implementation of the present European
Union CE Certification process.  With Adcon-L certification
completed, Adlcon-T/N, which inhibits post-surgical adhesions
around tendons and nerves, will be the next focus for CE
Certification.  The Company is also conducting pivotal clinical
studies in the United States for both Adcon-L and Adcon-T/N.
Gliatech is also developing additional Adcon products to inhibit
surgical adhesions associated with abdominal, pelvic/gynecological,

Toray Creates
Antithrombotic

Researchers at Toray Industries (2-1, Nihonbashi-Muromachi 2-chome,
Chuo-ku, Tokyo 130 Japan) have synthesized a hydrophilic material
and a formed a semipermeable membrane from that material (U.S.
Patent 5,480,953).

When membranes are used for medical care and brought into contact
with blood or body fluid, their components such as platelets,
leucocytes, erythrocytes, and fibroblasts inevitably adhere. There
are fears that these adhered components generate a thrombus on a
surface of a membrane coming into contact with blood and that the
components affect a complement. As a result, formation of a
thrombus or reduction of an immunity function is presumed to be
caused.

Various attempts to solve these difficulties have been made. In
synthesizing a hydrophilic copolymer containing a polyalkylene
oxide chain, copolymerized with an acrylic or methacrylic ester,
the content of polyalkylene oxide in the copolymer can be too high,
and there is a problem that the synthesized copolymer becomes a gel
in spite of the kind of the acrylic or methacrylic ester used. The
gel can hardly be dissolved in a solvent. In such a case, it cannot
be used as a coating material and cannot be formed as a fiber or a
membrane.

Even if the content of polyalkylene oxide is low, a satisfactory
anti-fouling property and antithrombotic property have not been
demonstrated. In research to improve the gel structure, a polymer
that can be easily dissolved in a solvent with a high water content
and a high affinity with acrylic ester or methacrylic ester was
synthesized by copolymerizing an acrylic ester or methacrylic
ester, polyalkylene oxide, and another copolymerizable component.

The material developed is characterized as a copolymer composed of
a monomer with a polyalkylene oxide unit and a polymerizable
carbon-carbon double bond in its molecule, a methacrylic ester
monomer or an acrylic ester monomer, and a monomer with a
polymerizable carbon-carbon double bond other than the first two
monomers. The content of the monomer is not less than 5% by weight
and not more than 90% by weight.

The hydrophilic material can be dissolved in a solvent and has
excellent antithrombotic and anti-fouling properties and provides
an antithrombotic semipermeable membrane. These materials can be
appropriately used in the medical field and as water-absorbent and
anti-fouling materials.

(680 Maud Ave., Sunnyvale, CA 94086; Tel: 408/481-4900). MIS is a
rapidly emerging provider of products for minimally invasive
treatment of stroke and for treating diseases in other parts of the
body accessible through small blood vessels.

MIS offers broad lines of catheters and guidewires used by
neuroradiologists and interventional radiologists to perform
procedures in blood vessels of the brain and elsewhere to treat
blockages and malformations of vessels, fistulas, clots, tumors,
and hemorrhages.  Use of these devices can often replace
destructive neurosurgery or address medical needs for which no
previous therapy was available.

William W. George, Medtronic president and CEO, noted that the MIS
acquisition would come shortly after acquisition of Medtronic PS
Medical, a world leader in neurosurgical implants, announced late
in 1995. "Acquisition of these innovative organizations, whose
product lines address critical  medical needs, represents
significant strategic expansion of Medtronic Neurological Business,
which now includes neurostimulation, site-specific drug delivery,
neurosurgical implants, and products for stroke therapy," George
said.

MIS participates in a worldwide inverventional neuroradiology
market of $100 million, expected to grow to more than $500 million
by the year 2000 as physicians and reimbursers emphasize catheter-
based therapies over open surgeries.

Rapid Change in
Device Market

Daphne Allen, assistant editor of Medical Device & Diagnostic
Industry, has analyzed the growth in the number of registered
medical device manufacturers in the U.S.  Data were obtained from
the FDA's Division of Small Manufacturers Assistance, which is a
part of the Center for Devices and Radiological Health.

During the period between August 1994 and August 1995, the FDA
recorded an increase of 1,737 registered medical device companies.
Overall, however, the total number of medical device establishments
has declined by 2%.  In addition to companies who leave the device
industry, the decline may be attributed to mergers, acquisitions,
consolidation of sites, and business failures.

The study indicated that six states provide the homes of nearly 47%
of the registered manufacturers.  California led the pack with
1,920 companies; New York, Illinois, Massachusetts, Florida, and
Texas are also important locations for manufacturers.  The analysis
was published in Volume 17, No. 10

Medical Device Reuse
Still Unresolved

A reusable medical device, as opposed to medical disposables, is
intended for repeated use on either the same or different patients
-- with obviously requisite decontamination and other necessary
reprocessing between uses. Examples of reusable devices include
endoscopes and surgical instruments, which often do not have
directions and labeling for proper reuse.

Furthermore, although disposable devices such as dialyzers and
catheters are intended for single use, they are often reprocessed
without labeling or directions for safe reuse by manufacturers.

Therefore, there are two issues involved in the reuse of medical
devices: reusables and disposables.

According to some medical trade associations, the FDA has not been
able to establish a consistent reuse policy even though the agency
takes the position that device reuse is a potential safety problem.
Medical device industry associations also state that the FDA has
shifted responsibility for safe reuse to medical device
manufacturers rather than health-care providers.  Only recently has
the FDA provided guidance on how to label products for reuse.

A key ingredient of the FDA's policy on reuse labeling requires any
510(k) notice to contain a certificate of validation. Although the
responsibility for medical device reuse is still not clear, the FDA
appears to be getting tougher with service organizations that
assist hospitals in reprocessing.  But the agency still is not
willing to directly regulate health-care facilities.

The general consensus is that the FDA will continue to apply
pressure to manufacturers to justify and validate reuse of their
devices despite their single-use labeling. A critical question
remains as to whether the FDA's position will be upheld in
litigation or lead to voluntary compliance by industry.

Artificial Nose May
Have Medical Applications

By mimicking the impressive ability of the human nose to pick a
single odor out of a million, Tufts University (419 Boston Ave.,
Medford, MA 02155; Tel: 617/627-3250) researchers David Walt and
John Kauer have invented a fiber optic and computer "nose" that can
identify many substances by their smells.

One of many potential uses for an artificial nose includes
"detecting the signature odor of a human being, which can be used
not just for identification but also for diagnostic purposes.  We
may be able to test breath and sweat odors to detect diseases that
alter metabolism," said Kauer, professor of neuroscience and
anatomy and cellular biology at Tufts School of Medicine. "Smell is
the most sensitive, most flexible way to do chemical testing," said
Walt, professor and chairman of chemistry at Tufts.

Cells inside the nose house millions of receptors that send
messages to the olfactory bulb, a pea-sized structure between the
eyes.  The olfactory bulb pares these messages down to a few
thousand, which it relays to the brain.

A chemical sensor works in the following manner.  A hair-thin glass
fiber is tipped with chemical A, a combination of a polymer and a
dye, which is known to react with chemical B.  The fiber is exposed
to the substance to be tested.  A light beam travels down the
fiber, hits chemical A (if it's there), and bounces back.  A
computer analyzes the light for changes in color and intensity that
would occur if chemical A encountered chemical B.  Like litmus
paper that turns a brighter red in presence of increasing amounts
of acid, behavior of light tells chemists how much of chemical B,
if any, is present.

While Walt's optical sensors have proved useful for various
medical, environmental, and chemical testing processes, "you need
100 sensors to detect 100 substances," he said. However, "if you
built a system based on olfactory principles, then one sensing
system would detect many different odors," Kauer said.  "There
would be an array of sensors where each one is cross-reactive --
each one responds to some degree to some compounds and to some
degree to others -- to create patterns across the array."

Using Walt's knowledge of sensors and Kauer's knowledge of
neurological networks, they created a device -- for which they
received a patent -- that can tell the difference between alcohols
that differ by one carbon atom and can identify five-carbon esters
that smell like bananas.  In other words, their invention is, in
some cases, almost as good as a well-trained human nose.

Imaging Systems
Go to Japan

Polaroid Corp. (153 Needham St., Newton, MA 02164; Tel: 617/386-
3112) announced that its Japan subsidiary, Nippon Polaroid K.K.,
has signed an agreement with Konica Corp. that enables Konica to
market, under its brand name, Polaroid's Helios digital laser
imagers and dry-process film to the medical radiology industry in
Japan.

Terms of the non-exclusive agreement call for Polaroid to supply
Konica with an unspecified number of its patented laser imagers and
dry-film products, which are produced in the U.S. and marketed
worldwide by the Polaroid Medical Imaging Systems division (PMIS).

Konica will develop an image networking system that will provide
imagers with interfaces to a variety of medical imaging acquisition
devices.  Konica will be responsible for all sales, service and
technical support of products bearing its brand and sold in Japan.

Laser imaging systems are commonly used by radiologists to record
images generated by such digital diagnostic devices as computed
tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), applications
where Konica has a leading share of the market in Japan.  Konica's
new dry-process product line will include two models that produce,
respectively, 8x10-inch and 14x17-inch films.

Polaroid's revolutionary digital laser imaging and dry-process film
technology combines powerful lasers and a patented digital
rendering technique to generate consistently precise images onto a
unique carbon-based film in seconds.  Because the system is fully
digital, it enables hospitals and clinics to eliminate silver-based
film and wet-chemical processing, as well as costs and hazards
related to use of chemicals.

Energy Pumped
into MRI Diagnosis

Researchers are using high-power diode lasers from Opto Power Corp.
(3321 E. Global Loop, Tucson, AZ 85706; Tel: 520/746-1234, Fax:
520/294-3300, E-mail: opc_info@ix.netcom.com) in a new, gas-based
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) procedure that may detect
emphysema, asthma, pulmonary embolisms, and other lung diseases
that have been difficult or impossible to diagnose with
conventional proton MRI.  Employing this experimental "laser-
polarized" gas MRI method, physicists at Princeton University and
scientists with Duke University's Center for In Vivo Microscopy
acquired the first high-resolution images of a human lung, reports
OPC's Merrill Apter.

Since they are filled with air and not water, a human lung is
difficult to image effectively using proton MRI because it lacks
the necessary hydrogen atoms to produce a resolute picture.  While
x-rays of the lungs can show some accumulation of fluid and scar
tissue, their exposures are too short to reveal porous lung tissue.

Other diagnostic procedures for imaging the lungs, such as
ventilation scans with radioactive isotopes, expose the patient to
significant levels of radiation and often fail to produce
sufficiently high-resolution images.  The noble gases used in the
laser-polarized gas MRI technique--usually helium (He) or xenon
(Xe)--are inert and nonradioactive and therefore are harmless
inhalants, posing no health risk to the patient.

Tuned to 795 nm, the diode laser stimulates an atomic transition in
the alkali metal rubidium (Rb), which is driven into a vapor in a
small oven heated to about 180C.  The Rb vapor becomes polarized
in the process and subsequently transfers some of the polarization
to the nuclei of 3He or 129Xe during gas-phase collisions in a 50-
100 cc sealed cell.  After sufficient polarization is generated in
the noble gas, it can be cooled to room temperature (condensing the
rubidium vapor) and inhaled into the lungs for imaging.

Physicist Hunter Middleton of Princeton University (223 Jadwin
Hall, Princeton, NJ 08544; Tel: 609/258-2843, Fax: 609/258-1124, E-
mail: midleton@princeton.edu) describes how the research team
relies on intense light from OPC's high-power diode lasers to
produce the required volumes of polarized gas.  "The highly
polarized state of the noble gas allows images taken with the new
MRI technique to be generated in seconds, compared to the minutes
often required for conventional MRIs," says Middleton.  When the
project began they were using five sets of large titanium:sapphire
laser systems pumped by argon ion lasers to achieve the required
levels of polarization, but those lasers were found to be too
expensive and inefficient.

Turning to diode lasers, they were able to dramatically lower their
operating costs. The compact 20 W open-heatsink diode laser
initially employed in the new MRI technique was priced at about
$4,000 and used less than 80 W of electrical input power.  By
comparison, the argon ion and titanium:sapphire lasers together
were priced in the neighborhood of $500,000 and used about 250 kW
of electricity to produce the same output power. "The
titanium:sapphire setup was so big it required a separate room,"
explains Middleton.  "The diode laser array, on the other hand, is
so small and efficient that it allows us to move the laser-
polarized gas MRI station easily from the laboratory to a hospital
environment equipped with only a standard 110 v wall outlet."

The 20 W array was more than adequate for imaging the lungs of a
guinea pig, but couldn't produce enough polarized gas necessary for
human tests.  For the first test of a human lung, a 120 W array
produced nearly 1 liter of polarized gas in four hours.  "Though
the spectral distribution, or emission bandwidth, of the diode
laser array (about 2.5 nm) is much broader than that of
titanium:sapphire lasers and exceeds the absorption line of the
rubidium as well, it's nevertheless extremely efficient in this
application," says Middleton.  "We believe that imaging the
function of the lungs and other organs and tissues filled with air
spaces using laser-polarized gas has vast potential and may evolve
into a nice complement to conventional proton MRI."

Syringe Prevents
Self-Puncture

Medisys Technologies Inc. (9624 Brookline Ave., Baton Rouge, LA
70809; Tel: 504/926-0420) has received a patent for a safety
syringe designed to prevent accidental "dirty needle stick" or
inadvertent self puncture.

According to the company, Softip is the only existing needle and
syringe that automatically encloses the needle in a protective
micro-thin sheath before the hypodermic is withdrawn from the
patient's body thereby eliminating exposure to a potentially
contaminated sharp needle point.

Edward Sutherland, the company's chief executive officer, stated,
"Needle sales in the United States are in excess of $1 billion
annually, and industry analysts project demand for safety needles
will grow dramatically as healthcare workers, hospitals, and home-
use patients demand products that offer safety from accidental
exposure to infectious diseases such as AIDS and Hepatitis."

The company is currently in discussions with a number of
manufacturers of needles and syringes.  The product is expected to
sell commercially for pennies more than the needles and syringes
currently available, as compared to the high cost of existing
safety needles.

Rotatable Heart
Valve Unveiled

St. Jude Medical (1 Lillehi Plaza, St. Paul, MN 55117; Tel:
612/483-2000) received FDA approval of its new rotatable heart
valve, the Mechanical Heart Valve SJM Masters Series valve.  The
FDA approved all aortic and mitral versions of the product.  Given
this approval, the SJM Masters Series valve will soon be available
to all U.S. customers.  The product has been available in Europe
since March 1995, with positive market reaction.

The SJM Masters Series valve is a system of enhancements of the St.
Jude Medical Mechanical Heart Valve, the industry's most preferred
heart valve, with more than 600,000 implants worldwide.  The SJM
Master Series valve was developed in consultation with more than
200 physicians and surgeons.

The product can be rotated for optimum valve-leaflet position after
it is sutured in place, providing additional flexibility for those
surgeons who desire rotatability.  It is also MRI compatible and
radiopaque for improved post-implant diagnostic capability features
requested by some surgeons.

Initial European implants of the SJM Masters Series valve occurred
in March, and the aortic version of the valve was awarded the CE
Mark in September.  To date, there have been more than 1,500
implants of the SJM Masters Series valves in Europe and Canada.
The company submitted a premarket approval (PMA) supplement to the
FDA for U.S. market approval in May 1995.  This FDA approval is the
culmination of a year-long rollout of this product by the company's
heart-valve division.

Commenting on FDA approval of the SJM Masters Series valve, Terry
L. Shepherd, president of the St. Jude Medical Division, said, "The
SJM Masters Series represents the continued enhancement of a
revolutionary design introduced in 1977, the St. Jude Medical
Mechanical Heart Valve."

Heart Pumps May
Replace Transplants

Continued improvement in left ventricular assist devices (LVAD)
have enabled doctors at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center (New
York, NY 10032; Tel: 212/305-5587) to discharge patients awaiting
heart transplantation.

LVADs are devices that assist pumping function of the heart.  The
earliest models developed more than 20 years ago were quite
cumbersome, keeping patients tethered to large external pumps and
their pneumatic power systems.  Recent technology advances have
yielded a portable, battery-powered version, its power source worn
on a belt or shoulder holster.

The LVAD used at Columbia-Presbyterian is the vented electric
Thermo Cardiosystems HeartMate.  About four inches in diameter,
less than two inches thick, and weighing about one and a half
pounds, the pump is implanted in the abdomen.  It is attached to
the heart and receives and pumps blood into the circulation,
leaving the natural heart in place to perform other important
functions.

A cable from the pump extends out of the body and is connected to
a battery pack.  With proper care, this connection can be
maintained for long periods without infection. After discharge,
patients and their caregivers must provide simple maintenance for
the LVAD, including changing the battery pack every six to eight
hours, changing dressings daily around the cable exit, and keeping
it dry.

A major advance of these new LVADs is a textured internal surface
that reduces likelihood of blood clots that can lead to strokes, a
serious problem in earlier devices.  No anti-coagulation medication
other than aspirin is needed. No deaths, serious device
malfunctions, or infections have occurred among discharged
patients.  All have been able to maintain their LVADS safely.

Currently, LVADs are FDA-approved only as a "bridge to transplant";
i.e. they are implanted in people who are awaiting a donor heart
but who suddenly decompensate and cannot survive without extra
pumping help. Until recently, LVAD patients had to remain in the
hospital, waiting an average of three months for transplantation.
However, advances enabled Columbia-Presbyterian physicians to
discharge seven patients to await transplantation more comfortably
-- and far less expensively than in an intensive care unit -- at
home.
