MITI to strengthen supervision of power plants+

TOKYO, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     The Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) will
instruct operators of electric power facilities under its
jurisdiction to establish a safety system for their operation, a
senior MITI official said Monday.
     MITI will urge power plant operators to step up training and
inspection to prevent accidents, and ensure a system for an immediate
reporting to the ministry in the case of emergency, said Tomio
Tsutsumi, vice MITI minister, during a news conference.
     Tsutsumi was apparently referring to the recent attempt by the
operator of the Monju prototype fast-breeder reactor to cover up the
extent of an accident.
     Monju and other atomic power plants are under the jurisdiction
of the Science and Technology Agency while ordinary power reactors
are supervised by MITI.
     A large amount of sodium leaked at Monju on Dec. 8, forcing the
plant's shutdown.
     A government organ in charge of running Monju has been under
fire for deliberately editing or withholding videotape taken inside
the plant shortly after the accident.

Crude Oil imports fall 8.8% in Nov.++

TOKYO, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     Japan's imports of crude oil in November decreased 8.8% from a
year before, posting the fourth consecutive month of year-to-year
declines, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI)
said Monday.
     The decline was in reaction to a sizable year-to-year gain of
14.6% registered in November last year when domestic fuel oil demand
surged due to a drought in the nation earlier in the year, MITI
officials said.
     The United Arab Emirates was the biggest supplier of crude oil
in November with 37.61 million barrels, down 9.5% from a year before.
     The UAE was followed by Saudi Arabia with 24.34 million
barrels, down 19.4%, Iran with 13.96 million barrels, up 5.2%, and
Indonesia with 11.28 million barrels, down 23.3%, MITI said.
     Of the total imports, those from the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries accounted for 82.3%, up from 80.6% in October,
while imports via the Strait of Hormuz represented 72.1%, down from
72.7%.
     Imports from the Middle East reached 78.9%, unchanged.
     The amount of crude oil processed during the reporting month
came to 128.32 million barrels, down 3.3%, MITI said.
     Production of fuel oil in November sank 3.0% to 119.57 million
barrels, the first decline in three months, MITI said.
     Output of naphtha, jet fuel oil and heavy oil decreased but that
of gas oil and gasoline hit record highs.
     Domestic sales of fuel oil came to 130.89 million barrels, up
3.6%.
     Sales of fuel oil B and fuel oil C slid but others increased,
with gasoline, naphtha, gas oil and jet fuel oil reaching record
highs for any November.
     Imports of fuel oil surged 39.2% to 19.00 million barrels but
exports sank 10.8% to 9.62 million barrels, MITI said.

TEPCO to pay more than 2 bil. yen over labor dispute+

TOKYO, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     Tokyo Electric Power Co. (TEPCO) signed an agreement Monday to
pay more than 2 billion yen in compensation to 165 employees for
discriminating against them on grounds that they are communists.
     The agreement, reached out of court under a proposal by the
Tokyo High Court after a 19-year legal battle, also calls for
promotion and fair treatment for those still on the payroll.
     ''This has been a very long legal battle that lasted 19 years
and two months and we all are happy now.  I'm confident that this
will help promote liberty and democracy for the basic rights of
workers,'' said Hideo Nihei, who led the plaintiffs.
     ''We decided to reach an out-of-court settlement in view of the
circumstances surrounding the case such as the court proposal and the
long duration of the trial,'' a TEPCO spokesman said.
     The plaintiffs first took their case to court in 1976, demanding
the company pay a total of some 3.7 billion yen in damages for
discriminating against them in wages and promotion due their beliefs
as members of the Japanese Communist Party.
     TEPCO had justified the wage differentials, saying they
reflected the employees' job performances.
     The high court recommended an out-of-court settlement last
December.

MITI to rectify notorious LPG trading practices+

TOKYO, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     The Ministry of International Trade and Industry will try to
rectify practices related to the trading of liquefied petroleum gas
(LPG), ministry officials said Monday.
     To answer consumer criticism that the LPG price system is
unclear, the ministry is considering revising the Law Concerning the
Securing of Safety and the Optimization of Transactions of Liquefied
Petroleum Gas.
     When the ministry reviews the law, it plans to include penalties
to prevent inappropriate trading practices from having adverse
effects on consumers.
     The move will be made because a subcommittee of the Petroleum
Council, an advisory body to the international trade and industry
minister, called for rectification of LPG transactions in its interim
report issued Monday.
     The report proposed that how LPG prices are calculated should be
written on paper, which traders will issue when they sign contracts.
The ownership of pipes and equipment in houses will also be made
clear, the report also said.
     The ministry will issue a ministerial ordinance to force traders
to make clear on paper such things as prices and ownership of pipes
and equipment.
     To punish traders who do not issue such papers, the ministry
will revise the law.  A bill designed to revise the law will be
presented before the next ordinary Diet session.

Oil industry makes political donations to ruling parties+

TOKYO, Dec. 29 Kyodo

     The Petroleum Association of Japan disclosed Friday it has made
political donations to two conservative parties in the ruling
coalition in response to their requests.
     The association of oil producers and distributors said 60
million yen went to the Liberal Democratic Party, the main force in
the tripartite ruling coalition, and 3.5 million yen to New Party
Sakigake, the coalition's smallest party.
     Last year, the association donated 50 million yen to the LDP.
It increased its donation in order to strengthen its ties with the
party in response to a request by the powerful Federation of Economic
Organizations (Keidanren), association officials said.
     Keidanren asked member organizations and corporations to
contribute funds to help the LDP repay 10 billion yen borrowed from
commercial banks to finance its campaign for the general election in
July 1993.

Miyagi Pref. takes dim view of leak at reactor+

SENDAI, Japan, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     Miyagi prefectural authorities said Monday they take a
''serious view'' of a leak of water at a reactor operated by Tohoku
Electric Power Co. in the prefecture in northern Japan despite the
company's assurance that it involved only a minute release of
radioactivity.
     The leak occurred near a hygroscopic moisture heat separator on
the plant's No. 2 reactor at Onagawa, a light-water, boiling water
type with an 825,000-kilowatt power output.
     Operators began shutting down the reactor manually on Sunday
night after the leak was discovered and completed the process by
midday Monday, after which they began investigating the cause of the
leak.
     Yutaka Suto, head of the company's nuclear power division, told
a press conference that radioactivity in the coolant water amounted
to ''a mere trace.''
     Prefectural officials counter by saying they view the case as
''an extremely serious mishap'' since the reactor had only recently
begun operations in July.
     An investigation by prefectural and company officials indicates
that the site of the problem was a device that adjusts the high water
mark on a drain tank on a second stage heater forming part of a
hygroscopic moisture heat separator installed to more effectively
remove steam generated in the reactor.
     At 6:15 p.m. Sunday, operators found water leaked from the
heater between the high- and low-pressure turbines.
     When the most recent inspection was carried out Dec. 10, no
abnormality was found.

Antinuclear group calls for Monju reactor closure+

TOKYO, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     A citizens' group opposed to the development of nuclear power
plants petitioned the head of the Science and Technology Agency on
Monday, demanding the fast-breeder nuclear reactor Monju be closed
immediately.
     The Citizens' Nuclear Information Center, in a letter to agency
chief Yasuoki Urano, also demanded that the agency reconsider its
plans to use plutonium in nuclear reactors in Japan's energy
development plans.
     Jinzaburo Takagi, executive director of the center, said the
agency should have known that the government-funded Power Reactor and
Nuclear Fuel Development Corp. (Donen), which operates the prototype
reactor, was concealing the accident.
     ''If (the agency) did not know, it has lost its power as a
manager,'' said Takagi.
     On Dec. 8, liquid sodium from the reactor's secondary cooling
system leaked and forced a shutdown of the reactor in Tsuruga, Fukui
Prefecture along the Sea of Japan coast.
     The group is also demanding that information concerning
investigations into the accident be made available to the public.
     ''The agency has not answered criticism from the outside, and
has given birth to a situation in which it is essentially protecting
Donen,'' said Takagi.

Donen rapped for improper system to handle Monju leak+

FUKUI, Japan, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     The Fukui prefectural government, host to the prototype
fast-breeder reactor Monju that was shut down after a huge sodium
leak, criticized the reactor's operator Monday for lacking the
necessary system to deal with such accidents.
     The prefectural government made the criticism against the
government-funded Power Reactor and Nuclear Fuel Development Corp.
(Donen) in a report on the Dec. 8 accident at the plant located in
Tsuruga, Fukui Prefecture, on the Sea of Japan coast.
     In the report, the local government said that the management of
sodium coolant is basic to operating a fast-breeder reactor, but with
the present system and equipment at the Monju reactor, Donen is
unable to act promptly after a sodium leak.
     The prefectural government also rapped Donen for its delay in
informing the public of the accident.
     Donen reshuffled three senior officials who withheld videotapes
taken at the site of the accident.  The three officials withheld the
videotapes in an attempt to cover up the extent of the leak.
     A panel of the three-party ruling coalition discussing the Monju
accident agreed Monday to send a fact-finding mission to the reactor
site in Tsuruga early next year, coalition officials said.
     The coalition panel also agreed to reconsider, if necessary,
government policy promoting nuclear fuel recycling, in which
plutonium is removed from spent nuclear fuel to be reprocessed for
use as nuclear fuel again, they said.
     It is one of Japan's major energy policies, and the government
aims to put the system into practical use in the first half of the
21st century.
     Meanwhile, Donen officials said the corporation is considering
diverting more than half the plutonium shipped from France three
years ago for use at the Monju reactor to other reactors.
     The officials said Donen is considering the move due to the
indefinite delay of operations at Monju following the sodium leak.
     Donen decided to shift the plutonium because Monju requires
high-grade plutonium and current stocks could degrade if stored for
an long period, the officials said.
     Japan shipped 1 ton of plutonium from a reprocessing plant in
France amid protests from countries along the shipping route.
     At the time, Donen and the Science and Technology Agency said
the shipment was a vital replacement fuel for Monju.
     But because of delays at a factory in Japan making plutonium for
Monju, the processing of the imported plutonium did not begin until
December 1994.
     Some 600 kilograms, or more than half the transported amount, is
still unprocessed and in storage at the village of Tokai in Ibaraki
Prefecture, northeast of Tokyo.
     A Donen official said the fuel could be used at an experimental
fast reactor known as Joyo at Oarai in Ibaraki Prefecture and at a
prototype heavy-water reactor known as Fugen in Tsuruga.
     The diversion of the fuel would not involve major problems in
regard to nuclear fuel treaties with France and the United States,
but Japan would have to explain its actions to gain international
understanding, the Donen officials said.

Agency publishes revised report on Monju sodium leak+

TSURUGA, Japan, Dec. 26 Kyodo

     The Science and Technology Agency on Tuesday published a
revised report on a coolant leak at the prototype fast-breeder
nuclear reactor Monju after the first report submitted by its
operator turned out to have been falsified.
     The revised report was submitted to the agency Monday by the
operator, the governmental Power Reactor and Nuclear Fuel Development
Corp. (Donen).  It contains corrections on the first report submitted
last week.
     The revised report says the time at which the first inspection
at the accident site was made was 2 a.m. Dec. 9, instead of 10 a.m.
on the day as reported previously.
     The new report also includes detailed chronological records on
contacts between Donen and the local and central governments since
immediately after the accident in Tsuruga, Fukui Prefecture, on the
Sea of Japan coast.
     Meanwhile, Donen on Tuesday dismissed another senior official in
charge of the controversial nuclear plant over the cover-up attempt
to conceal the extent of the sodium leak that forced the shutdown of
the plant Dec. 8.
     Donen, which has been accused of editing and withholding videos
taken inside the plant shortly after the accident, said Tadao
Takahashi, a director in charge of Monju operations, will be replaced
by Atsuhiko Kishida.
     The corporation dismissed three officials last weekend over the
issue -- Yasuhito Omori, who headed construction works at the Monju
plant, his deputy Isao Sato and Futoshi Maeda, a section chief.
     At the Monju plant, a specially established working group of the
government's Nuclear Safety Commission launched a probe into the
accident Tuesday.
     The group has been set up to clarify the causes of the accident
and recommend steps for the prevention of a recurrence.
     The group will conduct a separate investigation, independent of
the Science and Technology Agency's inspection team.
     Meanwhile, the Tsuruga municipal assembly handed agency chief
Yasuoki Urano a statement saying that the city will not allow the
reactor to be restarted until after it is convinced of its safety.

2nd high-level nuclear waste shipment to Japan postponed+

AOMORI, Japan, Dec. 26 Kyodo

     The planned second shipment of high-level nuclear waste from
France to Japan's nuclear recycling plant in the village of Rokkasho
in northern Japan has been delayed, electric companies and Japan
Nuclear Fuel Ltd. said Tuesday.
     France's state-owned nuclear fuel company COGEMA, which
reprocesses Japan's spent nuclear fuel, has not yet drawn up a plan
for the transportation, Japan Nuclear Fuel officials said.
     In April, the British ship Pacific Pintail, owned by British
Nuclear Fuels Ltd., carried the first shipment of high-level
radioactive waste in 28 vitrified blocks from France, where it was
created as a byproduct of reprocessing spent nuclear fuel on behalf
of Japanese electric power companies.
     The shipment of the waste is the first of several that Japan has
planned over the next decade, in which over 3,000 vitrified blocks of
waste will be shipped to Japan after spent nuclear fuel is
reprocessed by COGEMA and British Nuclear Fuels.
     Another 96 vitrified blocks were to be brought to the Rokkasho
plant in Aomori Prefecture in the second half of fiscal 1995, through
the end of March 1996.
     The waste would then be buried deep underground, but a final
storage site has not yet been decided.
     The April shipment drew strong protests from the countries
along the shipment route as well as from environment protection
organizations and local residents in Aomori Prefecture.
