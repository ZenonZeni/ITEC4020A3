<h1>The Anaheim Park Ordinance </h1>

<p> In our continuing effort to bring to you the news on this
issue, we ran across the following item. It seems that the city
of Anaheim, California (Disneyland, USA) decided to pass an
ordinance banning anyone who had ever been convicted of a drug
offense from visiting a public park. I could go on for hours
describing all the reasons this is a really dumb idea, but let it
suffice to say that the ordinance was repealed after the local
probation officers complained that their office was right across
from a park and the ordinance would mean that many of the people
they had to deal with would have no place to sit while waiting
for their appointments. </p>

<p> Just another outstandingly dumb approach to the drug problem.
