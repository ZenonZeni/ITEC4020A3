<B><FONT SIZE=4>12/9/96 Conference Call</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT>Good Morning.  I'm Jim Yahres, CytRx's
Vice President of Investor Relations.  It is always a pleasure
to report good news, and for CytRx 1996 has been a year of good
news.  From the creation of Vetlife's cattle business unit, to
Vaxcel's initiation of Optivax&#174; clinical trials, to
the decision to move purified RheothRx&#174;<I><SUB>pf</SUB></I>
back into the clinic.  Now, we have very special news -- the actualization
of one of CytRx's primary strategic objectives by taking Vaxcel
public. But  the agreement with Zynaxis  goes far beyond just
enabling Vaxcel to become a public company.  This merger will
create a vaccine delivery company with both oral and injectable
technologies.  I will now turn this over to Jack Luchese, CytRx's
President and CEO,  to talk about the agreement. <BR>

<CENTER><B><FONT>-------------------------------------------------
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT>Thank you.  As Jim said, with this transaction
CytRx is executing our previously announced strategy of taking
our wholly-owned subsidiaries public.  This will provide CytRx
shareholders with <U>recognizable</U> subsidiary value as Vaxcel
trades in the public markets. So we are very pleased with this
agreement.  <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT>Briefly, this is a two stage transaction that
will begin initially with us providing a $2 million bridge loan
to Zynaxis.  Final closing is expected by early April with a vote
by Zynaxis shareholders.  CytRx will then provide  $4 million
dollars in equity which includes the conversion of the bridge
loan.  Vaxcel will be the surviving company and Zynaxis shareholders
will receive 12 1/2 percent of Vaxcel's shares.  I'm sure
there will be plenty of questions, so I'll hold further
remarks and ask Zynaxis' Chairman and CEO Martyn Greenacre
for his comments.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>

<CENTER><I><B><FONT SIZE=3>Now, we
have very special news -- the actualization of one of CytRx's
primary strategic objectives. . .</FONT></B></I></CENTER>
<CENTER><B><FONT>------------------------------------------------</FONT></B></CENTER>
<BR>
</FONT></B></I></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT>Thanks Jack.  I'm glad to be able to talk to
all of you today. From the Zynaxis point of view this is a very
important transaction.  And, it is one that we are all very pleased
with.  Zynaxis has two significant technologies for the oral delivery
of vaccines --  PLG microspheres and mucoadhesive polymers.  But
we have lacked the necessary resources to fully develop them.
 So, through this merger with Vaxcel we believe we will be able
to realize the full potential of these technologies.  I would
like to have Paul Wilson, Vaxcel's President, describe
our technologies and how they fit with Vaxcel's.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT>Thank you, Martin.  With  this merger we are
creating an exciting company.  The past couple of years we have
been making good progress developing  Vaxcel's Optivax&#174;
technology.  Optivax is primarily focused on improving the effectiveness
of  injectable vaccines.  Our Phase I human clinical trial has
shown excellent interim results and should be completed during
the first quarter of next year.  <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<CENTER><B><FONT>------------------------------------------------------------</FONT></B></CENTER>
<CENTER><I><B><FONT SIZE=3>We are creating
a company with multiple vaccine delivery technologies.</FONT></B></I></CENTER>
<CENTER><B><FONT>-------------------------------------------------</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT>We will now be complementing this technology
with Zynaxis' oral technologies.  If you look at the vast
array of vaccines now being developed, there is no question that
certain of those vaccines are going to be more effective when
delivered by the injectable route and others more effective when
given orally.  Also, immunologists are now exploring combining
initial injectable doses with follow-on oral doses to optimize
effectiveness.  So, we are creating a company with multiple vaccine
delivery technologies.  This will increase our opportunities for
corporate collaborations with major vaccine companies.  <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<CENTER><B><FONT>------------------------------------------------------------</FONT></B></CENTER>
<CENTER><B><I><FONT SIZE=3>The combined company will be stronger by far than either company alone.</FONT></B></I></CENTER>
<CENTER><B><FONT>-------------------------------------------------</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT>As part of this merger, we will assume Zynaxis'
licensing agreement with ALK -- the world leader in allergy immunotherapeutic
products.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT>So, our good data on Optivax, combined with
the opportunity to create new oral vaccines and the licensing
deal with ALK makes for quite an exciting company.  The “new”
Vaxcel will be ideally positioned to improve the effectiveness
of a variety of vaccines. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT>Now I will turn this over to your questions.</FONT>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<B><FONT>How should we evaluate this
merger from a market perspective?<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT>Upon closing, Vaxcel will be the surviving
company.  CytRx will be putting $4 million into Zynaxis, which
will be merged into Vaxcel.  Zynaxis has about 14 million shares
(including convertible preferred stock).  Their closing price
of 28 puts about a $4 million value on the current Zynaxis shares.
 That portion  will represent 1/8 of the combined company, giving
the entire transaction a value of $32 million.  Now let's
put that into perspective.  A $32 million value for this company
with multiple attractive technologies compares very favorably
to three already public companies -- Virus Institute, Oravax and
Ribi.  The market values of these three companies are <U>each</U>
around $60 million.  So there's plenty of room for share
price growth here.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT>What do you expect re: burn
rate and future cash needs?<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT>The $4 million that CytRx is contributing will
remain in the company, with some to be used towards closing down
Zynaxis operations and settlement of some liabilities.  Vaxcel
is at the point where it's expected to start receiving revenues
as it enters into licenses with vaccine companies.  We don't expect
Vaxcel's burn to be high -- and the Zynaxis burn is eliminated.
 Next year's burn, even without any licensing revenues,
is about $2 million.  With expected licensing income,  we're
pretty comfortable with the cash situation.  Also, Zynaxis is
disposing a drug delivery technology which should bring in about
$500,000 as well as its Cauldron process chemistry group and pilot
chemical plant for which they are currently seeking buyers.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT>When do you expect to begin
receiving licensing revenue?<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT>Vaxcel's strategic intent is to complete
the Phase I human clinical trial and then begin aggressive licensing
efforts.  This will ensure that we get good valuations in licensing
deals.  We are on track to have the trial results in the first
quarter, and from there we'll be working aggressively to
put licenses in place.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT>How are we doing with RheothRx,
and what is the status at this point<B>?<BR>
</B></FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT>We are doing very well with RheothRx.  It is
proceeding according to plan.  This year we introduced our purified
version of RheothRx to the FDA.  We have developed the compound,
manufactured it under GMP conditions and after several discussions
with the FDA, we will be going back into the clinic in the first
quarter of next year.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT>We'll be starting with two dose escalation
studies.  The first set will be in patients suffering the painful
crisis of sickle cell disease.  The second set of patients will
also be sickle cell patients, but they will be the more serious
patients with acute chest syndrome.  Once the painful crisis study
is complete, it's our intention to go into a pivotal trial --
probably about 6 months after we begin the first trial.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT>How many patients do you expect
to enroll in the trial?<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT>The patient population will be around 300.
<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT>What is your game plan for
going after other applications such as stroke or heart attack?
<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT>Our focus now is on the sickle cell patient.
 We are not planning to do any heart attack studies in patients
in 1997.  We will be doing some additional preclinical studies
to show that the timing of administering RheothRx and tPa is a
critical factor in efficacy.  We want to complete that study before
we do any additional work in heart attack patients.  If we move
on to heart attack or stroke, or other large claims, most likely
 we will bring in corporate partners to assist in development
as well as in funding. I think RheothRx<I><SUB>pf </SUB></I>is
more attractive than ever, but first we want to get our purified
compound in the clinic and focus on getting it moving toward an
approval.  Corporate partners are going to want to see the purified
compound in the clinic.  We want to clean up everything, and put
our best foot forward before we begin conversations with them.
So, those conversations will probably start in the fourth quarter
of 1997.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT>Do you feel Vetlife will sell
about $10 - $11 next year?<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT>I think your numbers are within range.  We're
not projecting sales right now, but I am confident you will be
very pleased with what you see with Vetlife.  Since October, Vetlife's
sales force and technical service people have been doing a terrific
job introducing Elanco's Compudose.  We are very excited
about adding the full line of Ivy products in 1997.  It's going
to be a terrific year for Vetlife.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT>When might we expect a public
offering on Vetlife? Is it within the next year?<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT>It is certainly do-able within the next year.
 Vetlife has an attractive story with an excellent management
team.  The numbers are compelling, so it's something we look forward
to doing -- but no sooner than the second half of 1997 or possibly
1998.  We'll do it at the right time. <BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT>Is the Cauldron division of
Zynaxis similar to Proceutics?<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT>There are similarities.  However, there is
a location difference, and some of the services are different.
 We want to keep Proceutics focused on what they do best, and
have the Cauldron facility do what it does best.  When we find
the right buyer for Cauldron we'll sell it and provide that cash
to Vaxcel.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT>I noticed that Zynaxis 1995
cash burn was quite high.  Is that being eliminated?<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT>Yes.  The one piece that remains is the technology
development for the oral technology.  Zynaxis has already significantly
reduced its staffing and expenses.  Operations are intended to
be closed down by the time of the shareholder vote.  Once the
Cauldron division is sold and the lease assumed by the new owner,
the Zynaxis burn should be eliminated. <BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT>After Vaxcel has completed
this merger, is there a plan to spinout any shares to CytRx holders?
<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT>It is not our intention to spinout Vaxcel shares
to CytRx shareholders. We plan to hold those shares, and use them
to build the CytRx business over time. <BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT>Please comment on the overall
cash position and future cash burn rate of CytRx and it's subsidiaries.
<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT>Number one, our cash position is well under
control.  We will end the year with about $17 million in cash.
 We are projecting both Vetlife and Proceutics to be profitable
in 1997.  Also, we expect a much smaller loss for Vaxcel in 1997
with licensing revenues. CytRx will be spending more because of
the RheothRx<I><SUB>pf</SUB></I> restart.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT>I am pleased that our consolidated burn rate
is going down -- not up.  In 1995 we showed an operating loss
of $10 million.  In 1996, we will probably show an operating loss
around $5 million.  And in 1997, we're projecting an operating
loss that's around $3 million.  So were not concerned about cash.
 And with the prospect   of  our  subsidiaries   going  public,
there is always the possibility of selling
some of our subsidiary shares on the market.  But it's not something
we are anticipating and we don't see any fund raising efforts
necessary for CytRx.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT>You have actively been buying
CytRx shares in the market.  Is there room to buy more shares?
<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT>Over the past year, we have purchased over
5 percent of our shares.  Recently we have not been able to buy
because of this transaction. I'm authorized to buy  five million
dollars worth of stock, and to date, we've bought just under two
million.  <BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT>In closing,  I am very comfortable moving into
1997.  There are many great things happening.  This merger is
the best thing that could have happened to both Zynaxis and Vaxcel.
 The combined company will be stronger by far then either company
alone.  Vetlife is going to show us what it can do in 1997.  We
are all very excited about the restart of RheothRx<I><SUB>pf</SUB></I>.
  It is now a better product and it will be great to get it back
into the clinic.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT>---------------------------------------------------------
<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT>We have made several “forward looking”
statements in today's conference call.  Please keep in
mind all these depend on many factors that we do not control.
What we plan to do is one thing and how regulatory agencies react
is sometimes another.  Also there are obvious risks from trial
outcomes -- but in this business we take risks.  What we plan
to do is manage well that which we can manage and be prepared
to act decisively when necessary.</FONT>
