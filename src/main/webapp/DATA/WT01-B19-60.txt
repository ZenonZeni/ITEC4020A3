Dear Carl:
<P>
     Am now at MCFP Springfield, formally diagnosed with glaucoma.  Was
treated with laser surgery March 29th & am subject to further surgery of
freezing the gland that produces fluid to the eye.  I have declined the 2nd
surgery & requested treatment by marijuana.  I expect the usual obdurate
government/bureaucratic behavior & some form of reprisal for refusing the
freezing surgery.
<P>
     Perhaps this will generate a cognizable lawsuit for medicinal
marijuana, its scheduling & the deliberate indifference of the government
bureaucrats towards medical therapeutic use of marijuana & the fact it has
to be far more cost effective than permanently damaging surgery & continuing
use of expensive eye drops (I am currently taking & only partially
effective) & are toxic to boot!
<P>
     Tom Brown (Arkansas, religious use) is encouraging this approach.
<P>
     What the marijuana movement really needs is a viable class action & the
legal horsepower to see it through.  Ah, & honest government!!
<P>
     Meanwhile we'll see what develops in all the marijuana cases.
<P>
     From a national perspective, the war against marijuana seems to be
losing steam as more & more states are eyeing its potential revenue/tax
enhansing base & its many uses in industrial/commercial scale.  The 14 page
article in the National Review (Feb. 12, '96 issue) is telling of a changing
mood in drugs in general.
<P>
     Appeal-wise, my case looks pretty "iffy" at best.  March 1st got a
split decision & am now "en banc" & in limbo with 6 years to go … awaiting
yet another appellate decision.
<P>
     If you have any advice on how to better state my request, or how to be
more effective in presenting the request, or have any pharmacopea or
professional opinion to bolster our position for treatment with marijuana,
please send it along.
<P>
     Thanks for your support & I wish you continued info & energy in our
common goal.
<P>
     Best regards,<BR>
     Jack
