<p align="center"><b>PERMISSIBLE MURDERS IN AMERICA: ANOTHER
SUSPECTED MARIJUANA USER KILLED IN HIS HOME BY WISCONSIN POLICE</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>April 28,</b> Beaver Dam, Wisconsin, Scott W.
Bryant, 29, was shot dead by police as they charged through the
door of his home with a &quot;no-knock&quot; warrant.&nbsp;
Bryant was unarmed and did not resist the police in any
way.&nbsp; His seven year old son, who was sleeping in the next
room, had to watch his father die while an ambulance took 35
minutes to respond.&nbsp; Police later reported finding less than
3 grams of marijuana (one tenth of an ounce, enough for 2 or 3
&quot;cigarettes.&quot;) <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">This fatal shooting of a suspected marijuana user is just the
latest in a series of killings that have occurred over the last
several years.&nbsp; These incidents have generally been ignored
because the victims are accused of belonging to the one group in
America -- <i>suspected</i> marijuana users -- whom it is
apparently permissible to murder.&nbsp; These victims range from
the multimillionaire Donald Scott, shot dead in 1992 at his
estate near Malibu, to the disabled veteran Gary Shepard in the
hills of Kentucky in 1994.&nbsp; In all three cases the children
of the victims were present.&nbsp; Gary Shepard was killed by a
small army as he stood next to his wife, who was grazed by a
bullet, and his blood splattered on his four year old son.&nbsp;
None of these victims were in any way a threat to anyone.&nbsp; Donald
Scott did not even have any marijuana. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Media attention to these killings has ranged from slow to
non-existent.&nbsp; Even the Donald Scott case, which seemed to
have all the ingredients of a major news story -- money, intrigue
and beautiful scenery -- was not covered for more than 90 days
after the killing and was then quickly forgotten.&nbsp; The
police involved were never disciplined.&nbsp; Gary Shepard was a
poor man, a disabled Vietnam veteran who was crippled in Nixon's
war in Asia and killed in Clinton's war in America.&nbsp; His
killers are still on the job.&nbsp; It is unlikely that any
action will be taken against whomever shot Bryant. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The media are looking for an action story with good pictures, so
they find a bunch of &quot;good ol' boys&quot; playing soldier
who say things ranging from the bizarre to the basic.&nbsp;
Somehow it is considered dangerous rhetoric -- and therefore news
-- when militia leaders say that they will defend
themselves.&nbsp; However, NORML has been trying to get the media
to look into the role of the National Guard in marijuana
prohibition for over a year and a half.&nbsp; Our report quotes
the head of the National Guard saying that their job is to make
America drug-free <b><i><u>&quot;using any means necessary, no
matter what the cost.&quot;</u></i></b> (emphasis added) <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Meanwhile, as the militias and their conservative allies focus on
the shooting of the wife and son of the heavily armed white
supremacist Randy Weaver in Idaho, they ignore the shootings of citizens
who have been accused of having marijuana -- even when they did
not have any pot at all.&nbsp; Of course, indifference to the
killing of marijuana users is precisely what the mass media have
in common with the militias and politicians.&nbsp; While the
militias prepare for an invasion by the UN, the media are running
around the country looking for heavily armed groups that are a
threat to the rule of law.&nbsp; Both are missing the real
danger: the involvement of the U. S. military in domestic law enforcement
and the extension of unlimited power to the police under the
guise of the &quot;War on Drugs.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">President Clinton has denounced the supposedly inflammatory
rhetoric of his critics, but he ignored the statement last year
by Thomas Constantine, the Director of the Drug Enforcement Administration,
that the &quot;non-violent drug user is a myth.&quot;&nbsp; This
is a blood libel that leads directly to the type of shooting that
occurred in Wisconsin.&nbsp; Former Bush Administration drug
policy advisor John Walters even mocked the suffering of
imprisoned Oklahoma paraplegic Jimmy Montgomery when his case was
reported by ABC television, saying, &quot;Apparently ABC couldn't
find a grandmother on death row for carrying a roach clip in her
purse.&quot;&nbsp; Apparently, the minor technicality of a trial
has been by-passed, execution first, verdict later.&nbsp; Could
all of this be a clue as to why the people no longer trust their
government and the media? <br>

<p align="center"><b>GOOD NEWS! JIMMY MONTGOMERY TO BE FREED ON
TUESDAY!</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Thanks to the calls by the readers of these
weekly reports, Jimmy Montgomery is expected to be released to
&quot;house arrest&quot; next Tuesday.&nbsp; NORML will issue a
special bulletin as soon as he is free.&nbsp; NORML salutes
Governor Frank Keating, Michael Pearson of Oklahoma NORML, and
all who have worked to end this injustice.</p>

<p align="center"><b>NORML And ACLU Attack Legitimacy Of Anaheim
Law</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>April 28,</b> Anaheim, In an well publicized
press conference, NORML and the Southern California American
Civil Liberties Union jointly announced that they have filed a
civil rights lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles to
actively challenge Anaheim Ordinance No. 5396. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The controversial ordinance adds Sections 13.08.100.010 and
13.08.100.020 to the Anaheim Municipal Code and prohibits certain
prior drug offenders from the right to use public parks <b>for lawful
purposes</b>.&nbsp; This discriminatory legislation singles out
specific individuals from the general public based solely upon
their &quot;criminal&quot; history and forbids them from
participating in the many recreational, aesthetic, cultural,
associational, and other law abiding activities that generally
take place in city parks.&nbsp; Moreover, the restrictive Anaheim
ordinance remains in effect for three years <b>after</b> the
sentence has been served.&nbsp; Consequently, an individual
released from prison for marijuana cultivation in 1995 would be
effectively denied access from entering and/or participating in
any function taking place at a public park until the year
1998.&nbsp; Persons convicted of violating the ordinance face a
maximum six months in jail and a $1,000 fine. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Both NORML and the ACLU charge that the Anaheim ordinance is
unconstitutional.&nbsp; Specifically, the lawsuit, <i>National
Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML) v. City of
Anaheim</i> (95-2813 AAH), asserts that the legislation directly
violates NORML's right to free speech and assembly by precluding
members and speakers with prior drug convictions from both
attending and participating in a public rally for medical
marijuana that is scheduled to take place in La Palma Park.&nbsp;
The May 25th rally is being sponsored by NORML.&nbsp; The lawsuit contends
that, &quot;The absence of these NORML members from the rally
will, [in turn,] deprive the NORML members who can attend of
their right to associate with and exchange views with the absent
members.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">NORML maintains that the Anaheim ordinance will greatly diminish
the force of NORML's message by disallowing several speakers from
voicing their opinions on the need for medical marijuana.&nbsp;
In addition, because the enforcement of Sections 13.08.100.010
and 13.08.100.020 of the Anaheim Municipal code threatens to
exclude citizens who are non-members as well, NORML charges that
the ordinance &quot;interferes with NORML's ability to recruit
new members and to reach the full audience it would otherwise be
able to reach.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The joint lawsuit also alleges that the Anaheim ordinance
violates the plaintiffs' right to petition the government for
redress of grievances and the right to due process. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">One of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit is activist and medical
marijuana patient, Craig McClain.&nbsp; Recently convicted for
growing five cannabis plants at his home, McClain is one of
NORML's scheduled speakers who is forbidden from entering La
Palma Park by the ordinance. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In effect, &quot;the Anaheim ordinance makes [McClain's] speech a
crime,&quot; remarked ACLU Staff Attorney Mark Silverstein.&nbsp;
&quot;However well-intentioned, the...ordinance offers a false
hope about combating serious crime.&nbsp; Measures like this let
politicians off the hook, substituting phony rhetoric for
measures that work.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The ACLU and NORML are asking for a preliminary injunction so
that McClain and other plaintiffs can legally attend the rally on
May 25. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">[For more information regarding the lawsuit, please contact Mark
Silverstein at Southern Cal. ACLU (213) 977-9500 x264 or Allen
St. Pierre at NORML (202)483-5500.]</p>
