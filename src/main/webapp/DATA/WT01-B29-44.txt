<p><b>Speaking Out Against Drug Legalization</b> </p>

<p><b>or How to Hold Your Own in a Drug Legalization Debate</b> </p>

<h2>Introduction </h2>

<p><strong>by Clifford A. Schaffer</strong> </p>

<p>What follows in these pages is the Drug Enforcement
Administrations's booklet &quot;How to Hold Your Own In a Drug
Legalization Debate&quot; which outlines the top ten reasons why
they think &quot;legalization&quot; is such a bad idea. I will
examine their statements, sentence by sentence, and present
comments. Readers should note that, while the DEA has written a
book on how to survive when defending the War on (Some) Drugs,
the DEA has no interest in coming forward to actually engage in
such a debate. An open and honest public debate is the last the
thing the DEA wants. </p>

<h4>LETTER OF INTRODUCTION </h4>

<p>Dear Reader: </p>

<p>You and I are frequently faced with the need to address many
of the positions which are advocated by those calling for the
legalization of drugs. More and more, the debate on legalization
is being given public airing in the media. Average citizens, fed
up with crime and drugs, are being told that legalization is a
reasonable alternative to the crime problem that so many
communities are struggling against. </p>

<p>You and I know that legalization is not an alternative, <b>but
</b>rather a surrender which will further reduce our quality of
life. Ninety percent of the American people agree that
legalization of drugs would complicate an already devastating
situation. Health and social costs associated with the increased
availability of drugs would break our economy. Crime would not
decrease. The moral fiber of our country would be torn apart. </p>

<p>Those who advocate legalization have many motives. But they
frequently do not have answers to a lot of the questions we are
asking. Legalization is an abstract to many of them. But I can
tell you firsthand, from my thirtyfour years' experience as a
lawenforcement officer at the state level, the damage caused by
drugs is real and lasting. It's not drug laws, or the enforcement
of the drugs laws of our nation that are causing harm--it's the
drugs themselves. </p>

<p>Because we're often called on to speak to the issues, I asked
a number of professionals from the law enforcement, health, and
academic communities to come together for two days to discuss how
we can best address the arguments against legalization. I am well
aware that local law enforcement officials are on the front line
in the battle against drug abuse. For that reason I asked several
police chiefs to participate in the Quantico Conference to give
their expertise and guidance as we formulated our response to
these issues. This guide represents most of the issues and
arguments raised during that time. This booklet is intended as a
resource for you as you are faced with the questions and issues
associated with the debate on the legalization of drugs. While
many professionals participated in the session, the views
represented in this document are the position of the Drug
Enforcement Administration. They represent the consensus of the
assembled group and without necessarily attributing each and
every position to the personal views of each participant. </p>

<p>Please feel free to use the guide in whatever way you feel it
is appropriate. The debate on the legalization of drugs cannot be
won if we remain silent. </p>

<p>Sincerely, </p>

<p><strong>Thomas A. Constantine</strong> </p>

<p>Administrator </p>

<p>Drug Enforcement Administration </p>

<h3>The Reply to the DEA's Statement</h3>

<hr>

<h4>REPLY TO THE LETTER OF INTRODUCTION </h4>

<p>The DEA really has no business spending taxpayer dollars to
promote their own political agenda. The DEA acts as lobbyist and
public relations firm for themselves and other special interest
groups which benefit from the drug war and it should be stopped. </p>

<p>In the course of this public advocacy the DEA distorts the
truth on many occasions, lies shamefully at times and draws
invalid conclusions from what is true. The purpose of this
booklet was to try to stop the damage being done when the drug
warriors were caught in public spouting the old mythology of the
drug war, but we will demonstrate clear examples of the lies and
distortions here in their book. </p>

<p>We agree that the debate on the legalization of drugs cannot
be won by anyone who remains silent. That is why we challenge the
DEA to bring forth their best against our best in an open public
environment where these issues can be discussed at length. We
have asked for an open debate on this issue since February 23,
1993 when the Resolution for a Federal Commission on Drug Policy
was first signed. It is only the DEA who is afraid to debate this
issue in public. </p>

<p>We challenge the DEA to show the strength and truth of their
arguments by supporting our call for an objective Federal
Commission where all of the issues and evidence can be fully
examined. If they are right, the evidence will show it. </p>

<p>Sincerely, </p>

<p>Clifford A. Schaffer <br>
