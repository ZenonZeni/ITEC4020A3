<P>FOR VALUE RECEIVED, and in consideration of, and in order to induce the U.S.
Department of Energy (the &quot;Government&quot;) to enter into Contract ________ relating
to the waste acceptance and delivery of commercial spent nuclear fuel (SNF) (the &quot;Contract
&quot;) dated as of _______by and between the Government and Contractor, the undersigned,
________________, (herein called &quot;Guarantor&quot;), a _______ based organization, with
its principal place of business at ___________, hereby unconditionally guarantees to the
Government (a) the full and prompt payment and performance of all obligations, accrued and
executory, which Contractor presently or hereafter may have to the Government under the
Contract, and (b) full and prompt payment and performance by Contractor of all other obligations
and liabilities of Contractor to the Government, fixed or contingent, due or to become due, direct
or indirect, now existing or hereafter and howsoever arising or incurred, and Guarantor further
agrees to indemnify the Government against any losses the Government may sustain and
expenses it may incur as a result of the enforcement or attempted enforcement by the
Government of any of its rights and remedies under the Contract, in the event of a default by
Contractor thereunder, and/or as a result of the enforcement or attempted enforcement by the
Government of any of its rights against Guarantor hereunder. Guarantor agrees that Contractor
shall have the full right, without any notice to or consent from the Guarantor, to make any and all
modifications or amendments to the Contract without affecting, impairing, or discharging, in
whole or in part, the liability of Guarantor hereunder.
<P> Guarantor hereby expressly waives all defenses which might constitute a legal or equitable
discharge of a surety or guarantor, and agrees that the Guaranty shall be valid and
unconditionally binding upon Guarantor regardless of (i) the reorganization, merger or
consolidation of Contractor into or with another entity, corporate or otherwise, or the liquidation
or dissolution of Contractor, or the sale or disposition of all or substantially all the capital stock,
businesses or the sale to any other person or party, or (ii) the institution of any bankruptcy,
reorganization, insolvency, debt arrangement or receivership proceedings by or against the
Contractor, or the adjudication of Contractor as bankrupt, or (iii) the assertion by the
Government against Contractor of any of the Government's rights and remedies provided for
under the Contract, including any modification or amendments thereto, or under any other
document(s) or instrument(s) executed by Contractor, or existing in the Government's favor in
law, equity or bankruptcy.

<P> Guarantor further agrees that its liability under this Guaranty shall be continuing,
absolute, primary
and direct, and the Government shall not be required to pursue any right or remedy it may have
against Contractor or other Guarantors under the Contract, or any modifications or amendments
thereto, or any other document(s) or instruments(s) executed by Contractor, or otherwise (and
shall not be required to first commence any action or obtain any judgement against Contractor)
before enforcing this Guaranty against Guarantor, and that Guarantor will, upon demand, pay the
Government any amount, the payment of which is guaranteed hereunder and the payment of
which by Contractor is in default under the Contract or under any other documents or instrument
executed by Contractor as aforesaid, and that Guarantor will, upon demand, perform all other
obligation of Contractor, the performance of which by Contractor is guaranteed hereunder.
<P> Guarantor further warrants and represents to the Government that the execution and delivery
of the Guaranty is not in contravention of Guarantor's Articles of Organization, Charter, by-laws
and applicable law; that the execution and delivery of this Guaranty, and the performance
thereof, has been duly authorized by Guarantor's Board of Directors, Trustees, or other
management board, as applicable; and that the execution, delivery, and performance of this
Guaranty will not result in a breach of, or constitute a default under, any loan agreement,
indenture, or contract to which Guarantor is a party or by or under which it is bound.
<p> Guarantor has read and consents to the signing of Contract and acknowledges that
references to Guarantor therein.
<P> Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the liability of Guarantor
hereunder shall be subject to and limited by the applicable provisions of the Contract.
<P> IN WITNESS THEREOF, Guarantor has caused this Guaranty to be executed by its duly
authorized officer, and its corporate seal to be affixed hereto on ______________.
