<h1>HEMP INDUSTRY IN AUSTRALIA </h1>

<p>From: westender@peg.apc.org </p>

<hr>

<h2>THE STORY SO FAR </h2>

<p>1. ON February 15, HEMP South Australia rang to say that their
government had decided to investigate the viability of a hemp
fibre industry. They were acting swiftly, amending the relevent
laws by regulation rather than legislation, and they expected to
have over 100 farmers engaged in a hemp growing trial by April </p>

<p>2 On the 16 Feb, I put out the following press release for
Queensland HEMP. </p>

<p><b>HEMP MEDIA RELEASE</b> </p>

<p>GOSS SCORNS BILLION DOLLAR CROP! HEMP FOR FIBRE NOT WOODCHIP! </p>

<p>Yesterday the South Australian Government announced plans to
fast-track the hemp industry in that state. In April, 100 South
Australian farmers will begin growing hemp throughout the state. </p>

<p>&quot;South Australia has stolen a march on Queensland in the
development of a hemp industry due to Goss government
inaction,&quot; Brisbane HEMP spokesperson, John Jiggens,
declared. </p>

<p>&quot;The people who will pay in the long run will be the
farmers struggling in the forgotten rural areas of
Queensland.&quot; Mr Jiggens said. </p>

<p>&quot; Hemp is the glamour crop of the nineties. It has the
potential to be a billion dollar crop.&quot; </p>

<ul>
    <li>As a cloth, hemp is softer, warmer, and more water
        resistant than cotton, and commands much higher prices.
        The original Levi Jeans were made from hemp. </li>
    <li>The majority of the world's books were printed on hemp
        paper until the 20th Century. Banknotes are still printed
        on hemp paper. </li>
    <li>Hemp can produce from two to four times as much fibre per
        hectare as woodchipping. </li>
    <li>A hemp paper industry is labour intensive rather than
        being capital intensive like woodchip. This means MORE
        jobs. Woodchips sell for $60/ton. Hemp pulp sells for
        $400 per ton for low grade pulp, and up to $1500 for
        organosolv, the highest grade. </li>
    <li>200,000 hectares of hemp could replace Australia's
        woodchip exports industry - subsidised by the taxpayers
        to the rate of $300 million. </li>
    <li>Cannabis hemp makes the strongest particle board with far
        greater durability than any woodchip source. </li>
</ul>

<p>&quot;Marijuana prohibition not only clogs our courts and
prisons,&quot; Mr Jiggens said. &quot; It denies our farmers the
right to grow the crop of the decade. </p>

<p>&quot;The South Australians have realised this. When will
Queensland ever learn??&quot; </p>

<p>John Jiggens for HEMP 17/2/95 </p>

<h1>THE STORY GROWS </h1>

<p>The Courier Mail reponded to my press release by ringing up
the Dept of Agriculture in Queensland, and wrote an article
called HEMP PLAN REJECTED. </p>

<p>&quot;The Queensland government has ruled out the development
of a hemp industry. . . . A spokesman for Queensland Primary
Industries Minister Ed Casey said yesterday the department was
investigating </p>

<p>several plants for the development of a fibre industry. Hemp
was less attractive in Queensland than several other plants
because it was more suited to temperate climates.&quot; </p>

<p>Both the Greens and the National parties in Queensland
criticised the government for rejecting hemp out of hand, and the
Opposition Leader Rob Borbidge said he had commissioned a study
into legalising the crop. This was duly reported in an article
called DEBATE ON LEGALISING HEMP GROWS. </p>

<h2>INFORMATION NEEDED FOR FURTHER PRESS RELEASES </h2>

<p>What I was wondering is this; the Dept of Agriculture have
dismissed hemp out of hand on the assumption it will not grow
well in Queensland's tropical and sup-tropical climate;
Queensland stretches from 29 degrees S to 11 S. I know Italy had
a superb fibre hemp industry. Where else in the world was fibre
hemp grown in tropical and sub-tropical areas??? </p>
