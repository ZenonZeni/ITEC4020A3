<BR>

Kemper Financial Services, Inc. (KFS) was formed in 1948 when five Chicago 
entrepreneurs formed a mutual fund to capitalize on a technological breakthrough called 
television. They started Television Shares Management Corporation, and their Television 
Fund was the first to focus on the success and technological advances related to the 
television industry. Through successful innovation and diversification, KFS has enjoyed 
more than four decades of growth and prosperity. From its predecessor company 
managing a single mutual fund in 1948, KFS has grown to manage more than 28 different 
open-end mutual fund offerings as well as several closed-end funds. With more than $63 
billion in assets under management, KFS is one of the nation's largest asset management 
firms and a recognized leader in the financial services industry.

1995 brought many changes to KFS. With the completion of the sale of Kemper 
Corporation, KFS is doing business as Zurich Kemper Investments, Inc. (ZKI) The name

high-quality investment management products and services to individuals and institutions
