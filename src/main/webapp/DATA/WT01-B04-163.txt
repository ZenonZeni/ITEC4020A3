New York -- He strolled out of his apartment in Manhattan. He knew where
to get what he wanted, no problem. He was back soon with his packages, the
way some husbands come home with ice cream or flowers. <BR>
<BR>
He took some of the contents, and so did his wife. She died. The two children
were asleep. They found out in the morning. <BR>
<BR>
Happens all the time -- heroin overdose, dead on arrival. But he was a young
magazine publisher and she a stockbroker -- both up and coming and everything
to live for. How could they do this to themselves and the kids? <BR>
<BR>
Soon somebody wrote a letter to The New York Times explaining how it happened.
US. antidrug polices are to blame. The &quot;demoniztion&quot; of drugs
prevented people from learning how much heroin at what potency was O.K.
for holding good jobs without dropping dead. That failure to acknowledge
the enduring appeal of drugs is the &quot;larger tragedy.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
This was from a professor. He also is a senior fellow at one of those pro-legalization
groups supported by tax-free foundation money. This column is not directed
to people like that. They make their reputations and living by being professional
legalization pushers; they are gone, goodbye. <BR>
<BR>
It is addressed to other people, in academia, or journalism, some lawyers,
who simply believe that making drugs legally available would reduce drug
crime and save the billions spent on fighting drugs. They are worth arguing
with because they are people of influence. Their activities, writing, their
money to pro-drug foundations, help create a casualness, an acceptance,
toward drugs that increases their use. <BR>
<BR>
I ask them to rethink the consequences of what they do. Start by calling
the Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse -- (212) 841-5227 -- to get
its new report, &quot;Legalization: Panacea or Pandora's Box?&quot; I have
read myself groggy with studies on drugs. This one by the center -- at Columbia
University and headed by Joseph a. Califano Jr. -- is one of the most valuable.
<BR>
<BR>
These are some of its points: 
<UL>
  <LI>The drug war has made substantial progress that would have been impossible
without laws and public support. The number of &quot;current&quot; users
-- those who used drugs within the last month -- has dropped from 24.8 million
in 1979 to 13 million last year, nearly 50 percent -- but not evenly in
all cities and neighborhoods. The number of hard addicts has stayed steady
at 6 million. Wrestling with them is the job ahead. 
  <LI>Marijuana is the growing enemy of US youth. Teenagers who use it are
85 times more likely also to use cocaine than those who do not. Youngsters
also say that the major deterrent to the use of marijuana and other drugs
is legal penalty. 
  <LI>More access to drugs through legalization or permissiveness will hugely
increase consumption and addiction. That will cost far more than the $13
billion spent to fight drugs -- in increased hospital costs, spread of disease,
and drop in economic productivity and student learning abilities. 
  <LI>Drug-gang crimes would decrease only if drugs could be bought almost
everywhere by grown-ups and kids, wiping out all black markets. Even so,
crime would increase -- by drug-related crimes not related to the drug trade,
like murder, rape and assault. 
  <LI>Experiments in legalization or permissiveness have failed. In the
Netherlands, adolescent marijuana use has increased 250 percent. Registered
harder-drug addicts have increased by 22 percent. 
</UL>
Reading this report should be the ticket to talking about legalization.
Go argue with it. If you still want more access to drugs, stroll down to
buy a few packets for yourself and your wife, while the children sleep.
No problem.
