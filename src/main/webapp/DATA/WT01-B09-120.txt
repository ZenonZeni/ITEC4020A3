<B>Project Title: Development of a High Efficiency Light Truck Rear Drive Axle<p>
Performing Organization: Solectria</B>

<P><B>Program Description</B></P>
<P>
<B><I>Goal </I></B></P>

<P>Create a high efficiency rear axle that can be used in Solectria E­10 truck as well as other vehicles using
a solid rear drive axle with differential.</P> 

<P><B><I>Result</I></B></P>

<P>Testing and Side­by­Side Comparison with Chevy OE hypoid axle. </P>

<P><UL>
<LI>Increased vehicle efficiency up to 20%. 
<LI>Noticeable but acceptable increase in gear noise. 
<LI>Placed into production for E­10 pickup truck </UL></P>


<P><B>Solectria Electronics</B></P>

<P>Solectria has been developing advanced, high efficiency, lightweight electric vehicle
drive systems and components since 1989. These components have been placed in actual
on­road applications for well over 1,000,000 miles in over 200 vehicles built by Solectria. In
addtion, vehicles built by other large and small companies, as well as university teams etc.
have successfully put electric and hybrid electric vehicles on the road almost exclusively
using Solectria components.</P>

<P>ARPA's support has allowed Solectria to concentrate on innovative, low cost driven EV
electronics and drive system products to the point where they are ready for
commercialization. These component projects have been selected and executed because
they represent a significant contribution to Me technological and economic feasibility of
electnc and hybrid electric vehicles. </P>
