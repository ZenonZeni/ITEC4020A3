<h4 align=center><font color="#000080"><b>Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)</b></font></h4>
<hr>
<p><font color="#FF0000">What is Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)?</font></p>
<ul>
<li>the most commonly diagnosed behavior disorder in children.</li>
<li>characterized by inattention, impulsiveness, and hyperactivity.</li>
<li>can persist into adolescence and adulthood and these individuals may be vulnerable to antisocial behavior, 
impulsiveness, and educational failure.</li>
</ul>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Symptoms in an ADHD Child</font> </p>
<ul>
<li>is restless and fidgety.</li>
<li>interrupts conversations.</li>
<li>has difficulty completing school assignments, organizing work, and gives the impression he or she has not 
heard instructions.</li>
<li>is easily distracted.</li>
<li>makes careless, impulsive errors.</li>
<li>frequently calls out in class.</li>
<li>has difficulty awaiting his/her turn in groups.</li>
<li>fails to follow through on parents&#146; requests.</li>
<li>is unable to play games for the same amount of time as other children of the same age.</li>
<li>feels socially isolated from peers.</li>
</ul>
<h4><font color="#FF0000">Causes</font></h4>
<ul>
<li>no definitely known cause yet - strong scientific evidence supports the conclusion that ADHD is a 
brain-based biological disorder.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>1. children with ADHD were found to have lower levels of the neurotransmitter dopamine in 
biochemical studies.</p>
<p>2. deficiencies in a number of neurotransmitters, including dopamine, were found in laboratory 
animal models.</p>
<p>3. successful medications for ADHD affect the levels of several neurotransmitters in the brain. </p>
<p>4. brain imaging studies using PET scanners have shown significantly lower metabolic activity in 
regions of the brain that control attention, social judgment, and movement. </p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>environmental factors associated with ADHD include low birth weight, hypozia (too little oxygen) at birth, 
and exposure in utero to a number of toxins including alcohol, cocaine, and nicotine. </li>
</ul>
<h4><font color="#FF0000">Treatment </font></h4>
<ul>
<li>comprehensive approach is the most successful. </li>
<li>vast majority of patients benefit from treatment. </li>
<li>medication </li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>1. successful in 67% of ADHD individuals and is best provided by a child psychiatrist.</p>
<p>2. medications include stimulants such as methylphenidate (Ritalin), dextroamphetamine 
(Dexedrine), and pemoline (Cylert), plus antidepressants such as imipramine. </p>
<p>3. medication therapy improves attention span, controls impulses, dampens restlessness, improves 
school performance, decreases aggression, and enhances the quality of family life. </p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>cognitive/behavioral therapy </li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>behavioral modification strategies (the child is offered incentives and rewards for changing 
behavior) and special programs addressing cognitive deficits (plays games and exercises to address 
cognitive deficits) might be useful. </p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>School-Related </li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>1. if possible, parents should work with the school district to plan an individualized education 
program (IEP). </p>
<p>2. formal education testing and an evaluation for speech and language disorders should be 
performed. </p>
<p>3. support and encouragement of avenues to build self-esteem such as sports, art, music, or other 
special interests since academics are frequently difficult for them. Associated Disorders </p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>at least 25% of ADHD children suffer from some type of communication/learning disability. </li>
<li>about 40% exhibit signs of conduct disorder (starting fights, lying, stealing) or oppositional defiant disorder 
(disobedience, defiance, and rule breaking). </li>
<li>a strong correlation exists with the neurobiological disorder called Tourette&#146;s syndrome - at least half of 
Tourette&#146;s patients have ADHD. </li>
</ul>
