<H2>How is our program different?
</H2>
The Center for Surrogate Parenting & Egg Donation, Inc., (CSP), is very different from other programs because we rely so heavily on psychological screening.  On average, a potential surrogate is screened for 3-5 months before she is presented to couples.  During that time they are continually being monitored by the counselors and CSP staff members.  We want to make sure that a Surrogate Mother fully understands what she is entering into, so that each party (the surrogate, her family, and the couple) is protected.  During the screening process, the potential surrogate mother is given every opportunity to exit the program and break contract with the Center, without incurring costs to herself.  Additionally, we meet with the Surrogate Mother's husband/partner, to ensure he is supportive of her decision to assist a couple. We consider the decision to become a surrogate mother to be a family decision.   Her husband/partner will also be asked to undergo full social disease testing.
<P>
We are also unique in the comprehensive manner in which we approach a surrogacy arrangement.  We combine each of the aspects (legal, psychological, financial, screening, and medical coordination) into a complete program, and then take it one step further.  Each week, we have a staff meeting in which all of CSP staff members, as well as the counseling team, and the attorney meet and discuss every active client, one by one, to ensure that everyone is kept updated, and that nothing is overlooked.  The ability to unite all of these aspects is what makes us such a strong team.  All members of our team have a long term working relationship together.
<P>
Per a client who did extensive research of the surrogacy programs in the U.S., and then chose CSP, "None of the other programs placed the emphasis your Center does on caring about and protecting each person involved in the surrogacy relationship."
