Introduction
<p>
When I appeared before this group a year ago, the Civilian Radioactive Waste Management
program had arrived at a program plan which was adequately funded and which had ambitious
but feasible targets both for decisions about the repository, and for the development of canister
and transportation cask technologies.  
<p>
That was then.  This is now!  In the fiscal year 1996 budget, the Congress effectively
eliminated the program approach we had initiated.
<p>
Current Status
<p>
We are continuing to make progress despite the draconian budget cuts.  At Yucca Mountain, the
tunnel boring machine continues to operate well ahead of schedule.  It has excavated more than
two miles and is well into the repository formation itself.  Our hypothesis that little or no water is
moving at the proposed repository horizon has been strengthened.  Direct observations at the
repository horizon have not revealed any potential disqualifying conditions.  We have reached
the planned location of the access point for the heater test alcove and preparations are being made
to commence the tests later this year.    
<p>
The tunnel machine is at the point from which we will drill and then tunnel into the Ghost Dance
Fault, which is a major geologic formation in the repository area.  I expect important results from
the exploration of the fault at repository depths.  
<p>
Program Outlook
<p>
The budget, however, has had major impacts upon the current work and long-term targets.  In
September of 1995, in anticipation of reduced funding, we had to eliminate approximately 875
contractor positions, primarily at the Yucca Mountain  Project.  Final action on the Appropriation
proved to be worse than expected.  The Congress appropriated $400 million for the program
rather than the $630 million requested.  The Conference committee, however, inserted language
in the Appropriations Act requiring that $85 million of the funds appropriated shall be available
only for an interim storage facility and only upon the enactment of specific statutory authority. 
This language effectively left the program with $315 million to conduct all program activities in
fiscal year 1996.  
<p>
In managing the second phase of the reduction, we have tried to avoid further impacts on the
Yucca Mountain Project.  An additional 200 positions in the areas of quality assurance, program
integration, program management and waste acceptance were eliminated.  We had to terminate
most of our waste acceptance, canister development, and transportation work.  Our cooperative
agreements will be funded at substantially reduced levels.  We will stop work on the multi-purpose canister system after the design phase is completed in the spring of 1996.  Development
and certification of legal-weight truck casks for transportation of spent fuel will also cease.
<p>
I hope and expect that the private sector will bring appropriate canister technologies to the
marketplace to serve whatever storage, transportation and disposal scenario evolves.  I am
concerned that a proliferation of site-specific responses to the immediate needs of at-reactor
storage, along with expedient responses to emerging transportation requirements, could lead to
an inefficient system and possibly create a challenging management problem at a later time.  I
hope marketplace forces, the industry, and its regulators will avoid that outcome.
<p>
The Congress directed that the repository program be reduced to focus on the core scientific
activities.  The Congress recognized that the submittal of a license application would be deferred. 
As a result of the reduced funding, our program target dates for constructing the repository and
emplacing waste also have had to be indefinitely deferred.  
<p>
As Congress directed, we will concentrate our work on the unanswered technical questions
regarding the conceptual design of the repository and its expected performance.  Our objectives
will be to conclude whether the technologies are in hand to construct a repository at the Yucca
Mountain site and then to evaluate its probable performance, based upon the wealth of data we
already have, or will have by 1998 and the design concept we will have developed.By 1998, we will complete a package of deliverables:  
<p>
     First,  more specific design work on the critical elements of the repository and the waste
     package.  Those aspects of the repository and waste package design that are critical to
     performance, cost, and technical feasibility will be advanced beyond the conceptual stage,
     for the 1998 target.
<p>
     Second, a total system performance assessment, based upon this design and the
     characterization data available to us, which will describe the probable behavior of the
     repository.
<p>
     Third, a plan and cost estimate for the remaining work required to complete a license
     application.
 <p> 
     And finally, an estimate of the costs to construct and operate the repository.
<p>
This assessment will clarify the most uncertain aspects of geologic disposal at Yucca Mountain. 
The components will make important contributions toward the development of a Secretarial
recommendation to the President and preparation of a license application to the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission; but they will not be sufficient for either of these formal actions.
<p>
The long-range goal of submitting a successful application for a repository license to the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission remains central to the Program's mission.  We believe that the program
should include a plan and target date for the submittal of a license application.  It is apparent
from recent developments, however, that we cannot, as a practical matter, expect funding for all
of the work included in our previous approach.  
<p>
Prospects for Licensing
<p>
The new Program Approach we adopted in fiscal year 1995 reduced the previously projected cost
of licensing the Yucca Mountain Project by about one billion dollars.  That approach still
required an additional $3.2 billion on Yucca Mountain from fiscal year 1996 through the license
application in 2001.  We are now expecting to spend about $1 billion through fiscal year 1998.
<p>
The implication of these numbers is that, based upon the 1995 program approach, the completion
of a license application would probably entail an additional $2.5 billion of expenditures after
1998, if the cost of extending the schedule is considered.  It is clear to me that the Congress will
be reluctant to provide those resources, even if the outlook in 1998 is promising.  
<p>
I believe that it is both possible and necessary to revisit the regulatory basis that has given rise to
our earlier work plans.  Most of the scientific factors central to those work plans have,  or will
have, been addressed by 1998.  Much of the subsequent cost will be associated with the
documentation, presentation and defense of the results.  In my view, that cost can be significantly
reduced if the focus of the presentation and the licensing review is on the predictive performance
of the repository and on the safety case made for a specific repository design,  rather than on a
comprehensive discourse on site characterization.  I believe that we can aspire to reestablish a
target date for a license application soon after the year 2000 at a sustainable level of program
funding.  We intend to explore this approach and we are considering the revisions to our
regulations that would be needed to clarify our intentions.
<p>      
Beyond Fiscal Year 1996
<p>
This Administration remains committed to geologic disposal.  The new targets for a repository 
that are practicable will depend upon the policy and regulatory framework and upon our
expectations for future funding.  
<p>
Meanwhile, the Congress is still considering bills that would initiate an immediate start on
interim storage and potentially free the $85 million frozen by the fiscal year 1996 Appropriation
Act.  The House has not yet brought H.R. 1020, a comprehensive authorization bill, to the floor. 
S. 1271, a comparable bill, has been introduced in the Senate and a hearing was held in
December.    
<p>
Testifying at that hearing,  Secretary O'Leary expressed the Administration's opposition to the
Senate measure.  The Administration is concerned that an immediate interim storage initiative, in
the face of probable budgetary constraints, would place the repository program in jeopardy and
reduce the policy commitment to the long term strategy of geologic disposal.   The President has
also expressed his opposition to the peremptory designation of Nevada as a site for an interim
storage facility.
<p>
Closing
<p>
Certainly the past year has been an eventful one for this program.  As I have often found to be the
situation, a great deal of policy has already been made by indirection, without the enactment of a
policy measure by the Congress and a Presidential approval.  The FY 1996 budget cycle and the
debate in the Congress has already set some new constraints on the Program.  The responses we
have already made will shape its future.  
<p>
If we receive even modest future funding, I am confident that the direction we are now taking
will, by 1998, answer the important outstanding technical questions regarding the feasibility of
building the repository.  If there is an aspect of the geologic setting that seriously contradicts our
hypotheses, we are likely to discover it by 1998.  If there are shortcomings in the available
technologies or in our engineering ability to implement the design concepts, they will have
become evident by then.  Society's ability to evaluate geologic disposal will become much less
philosophical and much more practical.  It will become very clear how the geologic disposal
option compares to alternatives.  Whether or not interim storage is authorized, it would be bad
public policy to abandon the repository program without that information.
<p>
 Thank you for your attention.
