<FONT SIZE=+1><STRONG>Choosing the Right Insurance Mix</STRONG></FONT><P>


Should you purchase term insurance, or is permanent insurance the better buy?  If you
already own a
term policy, should you convert it to a permanent plan, such as whole life?  Or is a flexible
plan, such as
universal life, the way to go?<P>
	There are no easy answers to these questions.  And that is not because the
three kinds of
insurance are so complex and difficult to understand - actually, the differences between them
are basic
and easily comprehensible.  What makes these questions difficult
is that the
answers depend on you, your budget, and your needs.  One kind of insurance is not
necessarily
"better" than the other; and they are certainly not mutually exclusive.  More than likely, your
choice will
not
be "either/or" but "the best mix."<P>
<STRONG>Term, Whole Life, Universal</STRONG><BR>
	Term insurance provides economic protection for a specified period (or "term") at a
specified rate. 
It
is "no frills" coverage that is very inexpensive at younger ages and becomes increasingly
more
expensive as you get older.  Its "premium" (what you're required to pay to keep the policy in
force)
increases each term (since you can also buy this kind of insurance for periods of one,
five, or even
ten years).  It is designed to lock-in insurability for conversion to permanent insurance in the
future.<P>
	Permanent insurance, on the other hand, provides permanent protection, coverage for
your whole
life.  "Whole life" insurance offers a level or fixed premium that is guaranteed never to go up,
because it
averages insurance costs over your lifetime.  In the early years, therefore, premiums are
higher than the
amount required to pay only for pure death benefit protection.<P>
	If it were that simple, the choice between term and permanent insurance would be
straightforward: 
Whatever your age, buy the cheaper product.  However, the premium you pay in the early
years of a
whole life policy helps build a guaranteed tax-deferred "cash value," which is available
during your
lifetime, in the form of policy loans that can be used to meet emergencies, fund education
expenses, or
provide income for retirement.  Moreover, whole life policies from mutual insurance
companies are
generally "participating," which means that they earn dividends.<P>
	What about universal life?  Like whole life, this kind of insurance is permanent, offering
lifetime
protection and cash value accumulation.  Unlike whole life, however, universal-type policies
feature an
adjustable death benefit and flexible premiums.  After making an initial minimum premium
payment,
policy owners may pay whatever they desire, subject to IRS and company
minimum/maximum rules;
they may even skip premium payments for a year or longer.  The policy's death benefit may
fluctuate
accordingly.  With a universal policy, you have added flexibility to adjust your death benefit
and premium
payments according to your current needs.
<P>
<STRONG>Which is Best for You?</STRONG><BR>
	Term insurance is normally the better buy for the younger age groups and for the short
run.  It
makes
the ideal choice when you're young, just starting out, and on a strict budget, since it allows
you to buy
the full amount of coverage you need at an affordable price.  After all, there is no point to
buying a
permanent policy if you simply can't afford it; you'll either buy less coverage than you need
or, even
worse, lose your money as well as your coverage if you allow the policy to lapse because of
nonpayment.<P>
	Term insurance is perfect when your needs are temporary and when you need
protection until a
debt,
such as a mortgage or a business or education loan is paid off.  Generally speaking, if your
need for
protection lasts ten years or less, or will cease entirely before age 50, term insurance is an
intelligent
buy.  If you don't need protection after a certain point in your life, for instance once<P>
<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>the children have left home,
	<LI>your spouse is self-supporting,
	<LI>Additional income is not needed for retirement years, or
	<LI>you have no desire to leave an inheritance or need to protect an estate or
business, term
insurance is right for you.
</UL>
<P>
	However, if you need insurance for an extended period - for ten or more years - and if
you do have
the
kinds of needs listed above, you should consider permanent plans, such as whole life and
universal
life.
<P>
<STRONG>Some Things to Consider</STRONG><BR>
	"Baby Boomers" who are having children in their thirties and forties are often financing
a mortgage,
paying and saving for the education of their children, building a retirement nest egg, and
perhaps even
helping to fund long-term care for their parents.  They are the first generation of Americans to
be
handling these responsibilities simultaneously.  Permanent insurance provides not only
necessary
economic protection, but also the kind of asset accumulation opportunity they need to meet
converging
demands.  Over time, it is much more cost-efficient than term insurance.<P>
	After the age of fifty, permanent insurance is almost certainly the better buy, since term
premiums
increase considerably thereafter and are not recoverable in the form of cash value or
dividends. 
Permanent insurance, however, allows you to leave your options open with respect to
economic
protection, retirement and education funding, and estate planning.  It can be used to boost
monthly
retirement income through a technique known as "pension maximization."  It can also be a
major estate
planning tool, enabling you to minimize estate taxes and provide liquidity for your heirs.<P>
	What about the retirement years?  The cash value in a permanent policy can be used to
supplement
Social Security, pension benefits, and investment income.  You can borrow from it or even
turn it into an
annuity generating monthly income for life.
<P>
<STRONG>Choosing the Best Mix</STRONG><BR>
	What if you're sold on the value of permanent insurance but can't afford all the
coverage you need? 
You have some options.  You can buy the term insurance you need and gradually convert it,
piece by
piece, into permanent insurance.  (Most term policies have a "conversion" privilege that
allows you to
turn your term insurance into permanent insurance without proving good health.)  Let's say
you need
$200,000 worth of insurance: you can buy a term policy for that amount and later convert
$50,000 of it
into a permanent plan, keeping the rest of the term in force to convert in the future.  Whether
you choose
to convert to whole life or universal life will depend on your specific needs for an adjustable
death
benefit and flexible premium payments.<P>
	Another option is to buy a permanent plan with term insurance added to it.  If, again,
you need
$200,000 of insurance but can only afford to pay for little more than $100,000 of permanent
coverage,
you may be able to buy a base plan with $100,000 of cash value insurance and, for only a
little more
money, a $100,000 "term rider."  Or, you might buy a $200,000 universal life policy, starting
off with the
minimum premium and gradually increasing those payments as circumstances allow.<P>
	When all is said and done, you needn't be thinking in terms of "term versus
permanent."  Rather,
you
should be thinking of what is the best mix of term and permanent insurance that will meet
your needs. 
With the help of your New York Life agent, you can design an insurance plan that is flexible
and
affordable - a customized plan that will meet your needs and help you reach your goals.
