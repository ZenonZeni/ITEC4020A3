<img src="blueball.gif"><FONT SIZE=5><I><b> BXA Mission Statement:</B></I></FONT><p>

<FONT SIZE=3>The Bureau of Export Administration (BXA) promotes U.S. national and economic security and foreign policy interests by managing and enforcing the Department's security-related trade and competitiveness programs.<p>

BXA plays a key role in challenging issues involving national security and nonproliferation, export growth, and high technology.  The Bureau's continuing major challenge is combating the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction while furthering the growth of U.S. exports, which are critical to maintaining our leadership in an increasingly competitive global economy.<P>

<b><i>Vision Statement</i></b><P>

<CENTER>"We will be the leading innovator in transforming U.S. strategic trade policy<BR>and programs to adapt to the changing world."<p></CENTER>

<b><i>Major Programs and Activities</i></b><P>

<UL><LI><TYPE=disc><b>Implementing the Export Administration Act (EAA) through the Export Administration Regulations (EAR):</b> The EAA, which has  lapsed,  and needs to be re-authorized, provides for export controls on dual use goods and technology (primarily commercial goods which have potential military applications) not only to fight proliferation, but also to pursue other national security, short supply, and foreign policy goals (such as combating terrorism).  Simplifying and updating these controls in light of the end of the Cold War has been a major accomplishment of BXA.<P>

<LI><TYPE=disc><B>Enforcing the export control and antiboycott provisions of the EAA, as well as other statutes such as the Fastener Quality Act.</B> The EAA is enforced through a variety of administrative, civil, and criminal sanctions.  <P>

<LI><TYPE=disc><B>Analyzing and protecting the defense industrial and technology base, pursuant to the Defense Production Act and other laws:</B>  As the Defense Department increases its reliance on dual-use high technology goods as part of its cost-cutting efforts, ensuring that we remain competitive in those sectors and sub-sectors is critical to our national security. <P>

<LI><TYPE=disc><B>Helping Ukraine, Kazakstan, Belarus, Russia, and other newly emerging countries develop effective export control systems:</B>  The effectiveness of U.S. export controls can be severely undercut if "rogue states" or terrorists gain access to sensitive goods and technology from other supplier countries.<P>

<LI><TYPE=disc><B>Working with former defense plants in the Newly Independent States (NIS) to help make a successful transition to profitable and peaceful civilian endeavors:</B>  This involves helping remove unnecessary obstacles to trade and investment and identifying opportunities for joint ventures with U.S. companies.<P> 

<LI><TYPE=disc><B>Assisting U.S. defense enterprises to meet the challenge of the reduction in defense spending by converting to civilian production and by developing export markets:</B>  This work assists in maintaining our defense industrial base as well as preserving jobs for U.S. workers. <P></uL>

BXA's two principal operating units, Export Administration and Export Enforcement, as well as its Office of Administration, have undergone significant reorganization and downsizing in recent years in order to meet the goals of reforming and streamlining the export control system, as recommended by the National Performance Review (NPR) and the Trade Promotion Coordinating Committee (TPCC).  BXA is also an NPR Reinvention Laboratory. <P></FONT>
