<font size=+4><b>Q</b></font>  <font size=+1>The March 6th Federal Budget introduced several 
measures that will make it a little more difficult for Canadians to save for their 
retirement.  I've recently heard that the RRSP Administration Fee Deductibility 
has been eliminated.<br>

<b>P.K., Newmarket</b><p></font>

<i>
<font size=+4><b>A</b></font>  <font size=+1>Using the logic that tax sheltered plans "already 
provide significant tax assistance", Mr. Martin eliminated the tax deductibility 
of RRSP and RRIF administration fees and investment management fees.  If you 
paid your 1996 RRSP/RRIF administration fee prior to budget day, you will be 
allowed to deduct it on your 1996 tax return.<p></font></i>
