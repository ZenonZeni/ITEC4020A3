<H2>Australia</H2>
The Australian automotive industry is concentrated in Victoria and South Australia.  It is increasingly focusing on exports ($1.5 billion), given the small scale of domestic production (around 300,000 units per annum).
<P>
Reduced protection has been a significant factor in the large increase in automotive exports and imports over the past decade. Under the current arrangements, the effective rate of protection on Australian-made motor vehicles and parts will fall from 25% in 1996 to 15% by 2001.  Tariff and related arrangements for the passenger motor vehicle industry post 2000 are to be reviewed.
<P>
The automotive industry has a well-established hierarchical structure of car makers, component producers and a third layer consisting of the suppliers to the component producers.
<P>
The automotive sector is a major contributor to Australian research and development.  In 1992/93, spending on R&D was $166 million, equivalent to 6% of total business spending on R&D and the third largest sectoral component after computer software and electronic equipment.  A significant proportion of spending was on tooling up new models.
<P>
The industry provides leadership to the rest of the manufacturing sector in the adoption of new manufacturing technologies such as robotics and computer-aided design and engineering.
<P>
Automotive sector output in Victoria has grown solidly over the past few years and profits in 1995 were historically high.
<P>
<H2>Victoria</H2>
Victoria accounts for 65% of Australia's automotive industry production.  Ford Australia and Toyota Australia are based in Victoria as are the majority component manufacturers.  General Motors-Holden Australia has its headquarters, engineering designs and development activities in Melbourne.
<P>
In order to secure its future, the industry is increasingly looking to exports as the world industry restructures and niche markets become more important.  Exports of automotive products which reached $900 million in 1995 are being boosted in 1996 by exports to the Middle East of Toyota Camrys built at Altona.
<P>
Productivity has increased  as a result of  better work practices and more efficient organisational structures.  Compared with the 1980s, output levels have increased while employment is 20% lower.
<P>
Components produced in Victoria include pressed metal components, aluminium engine castings, upholstery leather, vehicle security systems, panel instrumentation, air conditioners and plastic mouldings as well as more elaborately transformed products such as complete engines, instruments, drive shafts, lighting and braking systems.
<P>
Almost $1.5 billion of new investment has recently been commenced or announced by Fort and Toyota, along with components manufacturers Air International and Robert Bosch (Aust.).
<P>
<H2>Prospects</H2>
The trend in the world automotive industry for niche markets will give Victorian manufacturers increased opportunities to compete internationally.  Under the tariff phase-down policy, automotive exports are expected to double by 2000.
<P>
The Department of Employment, Education and Training projected Australian motorvehicle and parts production to average growth of 3 % through to 2005/6.  Domestic sales are expected to grow slowly and exports to increase strongly.
