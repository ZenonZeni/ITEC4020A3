TVA, Peabody Coal reach new agreement

     A new ten-year contract between Peabody Coal
and the Tennessee Valley Authority will allow TVA
to get out of the mining business at the Camp
Breckinridge mining complex in western Kentucky.
     Although the agreement itself is no surprise (CO
4/16), the quantity of coal finally agreed on -- 5
million tons/yr -- does tend to limit opportunities
for other producers to ship coal to Cumberland.
     Under an agreement that TVA's three-man
board of directors is expected to approve this
week, Peabody assumes all of the Camp
Breckinridge liabilities -- including black lung,
reclamation and employee benefits -- for which
TVA had some responsibility.
     In return, Peabody receives title to TVA's
Camp Breckinridge assets, including some mining
equipment, the No. 9 wash plant, the overland
conveyor to the barge loader, and the barge
facility itself.
     However, TVA retains the coal reserves,
which it will lease to Peabody for a nominal fee.
     Under its current Cumberland contract,
signed five years ago, Peabody supplies the plant
with 3.5 million tons/yr, but TVA has been taking
an additional 1 million tons/yr from the Camp
mines under short-term contracts.
     The new base price/adjustment contract calls
for the delivery of 5 million tons of coal per
year, so there is no significant change from the
current delivery schedule.
     Island Creek has the only other contract at
the plant, supplying about 1.5 million tons/yr
through April of next year. Talks are underway on
a possible renegotiation of that contract.
     The new Peabody contract is retroactive to
November 1989 with a base price of $26.50/ton
f.o.b. barge. Specs are essentially the same --
11,425 Btu/lb, 4.9 lbs/mmBtu of SO2, and 10.5%
ash. But sulfur specs have been tightened to
address the quality of individual shipments.
     TVA's current f.o.b. barge cost for Camp
Breckinridge coal is $29.18/ton but this includes
preparation and belt costs. The price paid to
Peabody is somewhat less, a TVA fuels official
said. Market reopener is possible
     The contract allows either party to reopen
for a market- driven price adjustment in the
fifth year (1994), with provisions for
arbitration if no agreement is reached. The
contract expires in 1999.
     In addition, TVA can "wind down" the
contract if it chooses not to install scrubbers
at Cumberland to comply with the federal acid
rain law. Scrubbers are TVA's most likely
compliance choice for Cumberland. in lieu of
high-sulfur Camp Breckinridge coal, but it would
have to do so at the contract price, a TVA
official said.
     TVA purchased the Camp Breckinridge reserves
in 1965 for $7.4 million. Peabody managed the
mines under a cost/plus contract that was costing
TVA over $40/ton in 1985, when it decided to
close the mines and seek coal on the open
market(CO 10/28/85).
     That decision sparked a firestorm of protest
from the United Mine Workers and Kentucky
congressmen. Within a few weeks TVA and Peabody
had a new contract, and the UMW had agreed to
concessions to improve productivity (CO
11/11/85). Peabody reopens Camp No. 11
     Meanwhile, Peabody this week will reopen its
Camp No. 11 mine after constructing a new slope
from the No. 11 seam to the lower No. 9 seam.
Some 30 miners have been recalled, but when the
300 workers in five continuous miner sections to
produce 3.5 million tons of raw coal per year.
     First opened in 1977, No. 11 was closed in
1987, because the Camp No. 1 and No. 2 mines were
sufficient to meet TVA demand. A Peabody
spokesperson said all three mines will continue
to operate.

Backers pull plug on embattled Thousand Springs

     Developers last week killed the proposed $4
billion Thousand Springs coal-fired generation
project.
     Confronted with uncertain demand for its power
and under attack in three Western states because of
air quality worries, backers of the 2,000-MW project
had little choice. This is a jolt for Western coal
producers. The planned facility would have burned up
to 7.4 million tons/yr.
     Just two years after losing four of the original
partners, the consortium led by Sierra Pacific
Resources had lost four other companies in the past
month, apparently the final nails in the Thousand
Springs coffin.
     Sierra Pacific Chairman Austin Stedham said last
week the holding company would take a $35 million
writeoff against 1990 earnings because of the decision
to terminate.
     Two key equity participants added with much
fanfare in September 1988 were among the recent
dropouts. Foster Wheeler Energy Corp. was to supply
steam generators. And Bonneville Pacific Corp., an
independent power producer, was to play a key role in
permitting and licensing.
     In addition, two original backers, Pittsburg &
Midway Coal Mining Co. and Westinghouse Electric
Corp., pulled out.
     Those four defections left only four backers:
Sierra Pacific Resources, the project manager and
parent of Sierra Pacific Power Co.; Robert L. Helms
Construction and Development Co. Inc.; Coastal States
Energy Co.; and Kidder, Peabody & Co. Inc.
     Bonneville Pacific President Robert Pratt said
his company dropped out because the project hadn't
signed any power contracts. Yet the consortium was
planning to start construction of the first 250-MW
unit next year.
     A Thousand Springs spokesperson said the power
contract problem was the same reason the other three
companies pulled out.
     Ironically, the project's biggest public headache
in recent months was not the power issue but the
debate over its environmental effects on a region
covering parts of Utah, Nevada and Idaho. In a letter
widely distributed by the project's opponents, a
regional EPA administrator said the plant would
seriously degrade a region with exceptionally good air
quality and visibility.

MSHA rule seen as generally favorable to industry

     Industry is calling the Mine Safety and Health
Admin.'s final rule on patterns of violation fair, but
the United Mine Workers is wondering if MSHA is just
appeasing Congress and miners with an unenforceable
statute.
     The rule, which took 10 years to complete, is
designed to spot coal mines as well as metal/nonmetal
mines that habitually break safety rules. MSHA will
begin its initial screenings of the nation's
underground and surface mines for patterns of
significant and substantial (S&S) violations Oct. 1.
     However, the agency will wipe the slate clean for
operators by not examining any pre-October history.
MSHA says that "only citations and orders, whether
final or non-final, issued after the effective date of
the rule will be considered in the initial screening
process."
     Only final citations and orders will be
considered in the criteria for establishing a pattern.
     "This is about as fair a rule as could have been
expected, based on the Mine Safety statute," said
Bobby Jackson, vice president of the American Mining
Congress.
     "MSHA's prospective application of this rule will
provide mine operators with the Due Process clause of
the Fifth Amendment," Jackson said. He added that AMC
is concerned that parts of the final standard could
lead to "excessive and unwarranted" application of
MSHA's most severe enforcement standard.
     A UMW spokesperson said the strength of the rule
can be measured by industry's reaction, which is
generally positive. It is not typical for a statute
that makes things tougher for an industry to be
welcomed by that industry, the spokesperson said.
     The design of the rule has a double-edged effect,
the spokesperson said. First, it won't take into
consideration true safety conditions at a mine because
it does not consider violations before October.
Second, it will encourage operators to focus on legal
red tape rather than correcting violations.
     "The union has to question whether Congress'
intent to have a rule used as an additional tool to
protect miners from unsafe conditions will ever see
the light of day," the spokesperson said.

     The rule will work this way:

     After Oct. 1, MSHA will review the compliance
records of every mine at least once a year, reserving
the right to take a closer look at specific mines as
often as needed.
     Generally, the agency will use a two-year
yardstick to measure health and safety patterns.
     MSHA will look at each mine's history of S&S
violations, withdrawal orders for failure to abate S&S
violations, and withdrawal orders for conditions
posing imminent danger to miners.
     When a potential pattern of violations is
spotted, MSHA's district manager will provide written
notification to a mine operator and a representative
of workers at the mine. The operator has 20 days to
take a number of possible steps, one of which is to
institute a program to avoid repeated S&S violations.
MSHA will not consider unrelated S&S violations in
identifying a pattern of violations. It will consider
only those of the same standard, or standards related
to the same hazard, or violations resulting from an
operator's unwarrantable failure to comply. Notice of
a pattern can be ended after an MSHA inspection of the
entire mine finds no S&S violations.
     If MSHA inspects a mine within 90 days after
issuing a pattern of violation notice and finds any
S&S violation that could cause a mine safety or health
hazard, the agency will issue a withdrawal order for
all persons in the affected area. Workers will not be
allowed to return until an MSHA inspector determines
that the violation has been abated.

AMAX mine faces shutdown over permit void

     An AMAX Coal surface mine in southern Indiana
could be idled next week if a state commission agrees
with a finding by an administrative law judge that the
mine's permit is void.
     William Teeguarden, an ALJ for the state Natural
Resources Dept., has ruled that the permit issued in
May 1989 to AMAX for the Cass pit at its Minnehaha
mine is void because two conditions raised at the time
of the permit application were so major that the
permit should not have been approved. The two
conditions have to do with blasting and hydrology
issues at the site, concerns for nearby landowners.
     Nathan Noland, director of the Indiana Coal
Council, said last week that Teeguarden's decision may
hurt the smooth issuance of mine permits in the state.
An attorney for the council is investigating that
potential impact.
     Teeguarden's order, essentially a recommendation,
is what a review commission at the state DNR will rule
on next week. If the commission agrees the permit is
void, the company can appeal, but will have to cease
operations at the site during the appeal. The mine
produces 1 million tons of coal annually.
     Noland explained that when the DNR approves a
permit, it allows a 30-day period for comments from
interested parties. Within that period, the department
can put conditions on the permit that must be met
before the permit is actually issued.
     For example, Noland said, paying bond fees is a
common condition that must be met during the 30 days.
     Teeguarden's ruling says that certain
circumstances are so major they shouldn't be allowed
as conditions within the 30-day period, and should be
met well before then. The two concerns at Minnehaha
fall under that definition, he said.
     Noland says the question here is what constitutes
an appropriate condition for issuing a permit. He said
Teeguarden's order paints a grey area, where it is
difficult to define what exactly is an inappropriate
condition.
     Kevin Feeney, an AMAX spokesperson, said the
company is reviewing the decision and trying to
determine what the judge means in his findings. He
said that in the meantime operations and water pumping
continue at Minnehaha.

Savage to haul W.V. coal for Arch Mineral

     The largest hauler of truck coal in the West has
taken a piece of the Eastern market, say sources, with
a deal to haul West Virginia coal for Arch Mineral
Corp., on a movement to Dayton Power and Light.
     Savage Coal Industries of Salt Lake City,
Utah, will truck the coal from Arch's Wylo mine
in Logan County, W.V., to Arch's Big Sandy River
terminal (formerly Dock's Creek).
     Savage referred questions last week to Arch
Mineral, whose only comment was that a file agreement
has not been signed.
If the deal does goes through, Arch will take over the
movement from independent truckers.
     The coal -- about 900,000 tons/yr -- is now
trucked some 55 miles from Wylo to the river and
then loaded into barges for shipment to Dayton.
The coal was shipped by CSX Transportation until
last year, when the switch to truck was made (CO
5/8/89).
     That change wasn't and hasn't necessarily
been an easy one. Truckers typically do not bring
reliability and stability to the business of
hauling coal, opined one source in the utility
industry. Although their costs initially are
competitive with rail, controlling those costs
over time has been a problem for some shippers,
the source said.
     Savage's use of storage terminals at the
mines, its emphasis on service, and various
cost-control measures will help Arch and Dayton
in this regard, two sources believe. "It's a good
deal for both companies," added one observer.
Savage competition to improve Eastern trucking?
     Another coal executive sees the Savage
approach as the wave of the future in the East,
putting pressure to upgrade service not only on
independent truckers but on railroads as well.
Others aren't so sure.
     "Savage's entry into the Eastern coal fields
should serve notice there is a need for a vast
improvement in service," agreed one industry
executive. But although Savage itself likely will
get more Eastern business, "I don't see anyone
else putting together helpful transportation
packages," the executive said.
     "A classy trucking company is almost a
contradiction in terms," the executive stated.
"Trucking will continue to be a localized
phenomenon in Kentucky and West Virginia."

Oil crisis is no boon to coal -- yet

     Don't expect to wake up one morning and see a
significant hike in coal demand or prices as a result
of the oil crisis in the Mideast staring you in the
face, at least not right away.
     Thats the word from most coal buyers and sellers
on the outlook for coal in the wake of Iraq's invasion
of Kuwait. Due to currently soft coal market
conditions, observers were willing to predict that
coal demand and prices are not likely to change much
if any during the next month or two.
     But most coal observers believe all bets are
off if war erupts in the Persian Gulf or if the
crisis lasts well into the fourth quarter.
     From a marketing stand-point, the crisis is
not bad for the coal industry, but so far there
has been no indication of increased demand or
willingness by consumers to pay higher prices,
said Wyn Holbrook, executive vice president of
sales and marketing for A.T. Massey Coal.
     Holbrook's view, shared by several other
coal producers and consumers, is grounded partly
in recent market conditions: relatively low
domestic and overseas demand, coupled with an
excess supply of coal.
     European utilities, many of which are
capable of switching from oil to coal,
conceivably could burn current oil stockpiles and
come back into the market with enough demand to
boost U.S. exports by 4 to 6 million tons this
year, Holbrook said.
     Whether this much extra tonnage withdrawn
from domestic consumption could spark an increase
in prices depends on the actual ratio of supply
to demand. The market will be interesting to
watch, suggested one coal buyer who is not
confident that prices will not get some lift from
the crisis.
     Mark Joseph, president of Maran Coal, an
exporting company headquartered in New York, adds
that European cement companies who were using oil
may now come back to coal, but the tonnage is
relatively minor.

Recession could balance any demand upsurge

     If there is eventually a shortage of oil,
Joseph said, the resulting need for more coal may
be offset to some extent by an economic downturn,
cutting coal buys. "Basically a recession is a
time when you trim inventories," he cautioned.
     But Joseph said he cannot predict what will
happen to coal markets if the oil crisis lasts
past mid-November.
     Ramesh Malhotra, president of Coal Network
Inc., points out that higher fuel prices will
increase ocean freight costs in favor of U.S.
coal over Australian coal in Europe, because the
U.S. is closer to European coal ports.
     Florida and New England -- two areas of the
country heavily dependent on oil -- are not in a
position to take advantage of coal-fired power
generation from other areas.
     Jim Tullis, manager of off-system sales for
the Southern Company, said Florida utilities
which buy coal-fired power from Southern have
already been taking close to the maximum amount
of power for which they have contracts.
     Also, once Florida Power and Light begins
taking another 300 MW beginning Nov. 1, there
will be no transmission capacityleft between
Southern Company and the Florida utilities,
Tullis said.
     The same conditions exist in New England,
where utilities generate 37% of their electricity
with oil. The transmission capacity does not
exist to import large amounts of coal-fired power
from the Midwest, said a spokesperson for the New
England Power Pool.
     In any event, the utilities' oil stocks are
in "relatively good shape" for the short term and
so far there is no shortage of oil on the world
market, although prices are rising, the
spokesperson said.
     Most coal units in New England -- such as
New England Power's Salem Harbor and Brayton
Point plants -- are baseloaded already.

East Coast exports show little growth

     Three major East Coast coal export harbors
haven't exactly needed to add new shifts to load ships
so far this year, with coal shipments out of Hampton
Roads and Baltimore through June down about 100,000
long tons from the same period last year.
     Latest figures from John S. Connor Inc. of
Baltimore and W.M. Stone & Co. of Norfolk, Va., show
27.5 million long tons (30.8 million tons) shipped
through the three ports through June. That's compared
with 27.6 million long tons (30.9 million tons)
through June 1989.
     (All figures from this point on are in long
tons.)
     Norfolk has seen an upturn in business. Coal
shipments through there are up about 800,000 tons over
shipments through June 1989. But its companion port,
Newport News, is down over 900,000 tons, more than
making up for Norfolk's good fortune. Baltimore's
numbers have been fairly stable so far this year
compared with 1989.
     Pittston Coal has seen a slump in its shipments
Pittston had shipped over 3.4 million tons through
Norfolk and Newport News, despite labor troubles with
the United Mine Workers union. In the first five
months of this year, it's about 3 million tons.
     Pittston did see a strong export picture in June,
with over 800,000 tons shipped through Hampton Roads.
In May, Pittston shipments through those two ports
totaled about 415,000 tons.
     A big operator shoving less through Hampton Roads
through June is Consolidation, with nearly 2.3 million
tons loaded, compared with 2.8 million tons in the
first five months of 1989. Consol increased its June
shipment through the two ports, with around 417,000
tons that month, compared with about 316,000 in May.
     On the brighter side, Westmoreland, another major
exporter, is sending a lot more coal cars through
Norfolk and Newport News. Through June of this year,
Westmoreland shipped nearly 2.2 million tons through
there, compared with a little over 1.7 million in the
same period in 1989.
     June shipments through Hampton Roads for
Westmoreland totaled nearly 394,000, down from nearly
325,000 in May.

Acid rain bills carry high price, in jobs, dollars

       EPA has finally issued a long-awaited
study of the impact of the acid rain titles of the
House and Senate clean air bills, and it shows massive
costs for utilities and high-sulfur coal.
     Neither the House nor Senate acid rain control
measures is apparently veto bait for President Bush --
at least in terms of cost. The new EPA study says both
bills carry a price tag for utilities through 2010 of
$12 billion-$18 billion. The original Bush bill had an
estimated cost of $13 billion-$18 billion.
     The EPA report is laid out in "high" and "low"
cases. "High" assumes the highest likely impact of the
bill. The "low" case assumes lowest impact, plus an
accelerated utility use of clean coal technologies
that would tend to further soften the blow of the
final clean air bill on coal jobs and markets.
     One major surprise is that by the end of Phase 2
compliance deadlines -- roughly, the end of the decade
-- neither bill would achieve the targeted 10 million
ton/yr cut in SO2. The House bill would go the
furthest, with up to an 8.3-million-ton cut by the end
of 2000. Only by 2005 would the 10-million-ton target
be met by both bills.
     The report, at least in part, answers questions
put to the administration earlier by House Energy
Chairman John Dingell, D-Mich. A House Energy staffer
said last week that Dingell, who chairs the House
delegation to the clean air conference committee, had
not had a chance to review the report before returning
to Michigan for the August recess.
     Work by conferees is on hold for the recess,
which ends the week after the Labor Day holiday.
Negotiations between staff from the House and Senate
will resume the week before Labor Day.
     Some observers say Congress, if it can't pass a
bill in the month it has left in session, may have to
do it in a "lame duck" session after the November
election. Or the bill just may die for this year, they
point out, especially with Congress distracted by the
oil crisis in the Middle East, and other pressing
issues.

Bill hits utilities, high-sulfur regions

     Meanwhile, the EPA report puts some numbers on
acid rain title impacts. Under Phase 1 (early 1990s),
both bills would hit utilities for about $500 million-
$800 million/yr. In Phase 2, House mandates on
scrubbing in the West due to haze problems around
national parks -- and also due to higher mandated
SO2/NOX reductions -- would mean the House bill would
cost utilities more. The House cost -- $3.4 billion-
$4.4 billion/yr. The Senate bill -- $3 billion-$3.9
billion/yr. Costs to utilities under both bills would
peak at $5 billion/yr in 2005.
     In Phase 1, said the report, high-sulfur coal
output sags by 35 million-42 million tons/yr under the
Senate bill over basecase levels. The House bill cuts
high-sulfur coal by 47 million-56 million tons/yr. The
Senate bill has a lower impact because it sets lower
emissions reductions in Phase 1 and has scrubber
incentives.
     In Phase 2, high-sulfur consumption continues to
tumble, by 96 million-98 million tons/yr under the
Senate bill, 92 million-109 million tons/yr due to the
House measure. High-sulfur coal markets will show a
strong recovery after 2000 as new, cleaner coal plants
come on-line.
     The silver lining in this acid rain cloud is that
an uptick in low-sulfur coal production will offset,
basically one-for-one, losses in high-sulfur coal
lining doesn't help high-sulfur coal regions.
     In Northern Appalachia and the Midwest, the two
main high-sulfur regions, the Senate bill would cut
end of the century. Under the House proposal, it's
6,000-7,000 jobs by 1996, 13,000-16,000 after 2001.
(The House bill's Phase 1 and 2 deadlines are one year
later than those of the Senate.)
     One factor in the House bill that could mitigate
high-sulfur coal losses is a provision allowing
governors to mandate use of in-state coal. The report
does not analyze that factor, but says job losses can
be held down with it -- at the cost of higher utility
rates.

McCall fate still uncertain

     Jno. McCall Coal has told its coal suppliers
and creditors that it will resolve its current
credit crisis and resume buying coal for its 1990
export contracts.
     "I'm confident McCall will get themselves
out of it," said the sales executive for one
producer who has sold coal to McCall for over 10
years. "They indicate to me they will."
     As reported last week, numerous sources in
the coal industry believe McCall's major bank
pulled its line of credit, preventing the company
from paying for coal already shipped and, in
some cases, from procuring new coal.
     There was no indication late last week that
the problem had been resolved. McCall continued
to decline comment.
     Coal industry executives speculate that
McCall will choose to file for protection from
its creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal
bankruptcy code, but one supplier said he
believes any filing would protect creditors as
well.
     But McCall had made no such filing through
last Thursday, according to a clerk in the U.S.
Bankruptcy Court in Baltimore, Md., where McCall
is headquartered.

NERCO gets cautious Shearson nod

     Coal makes NERCO Inc. a good investment, but the
company's natural gas and precious metals divisions
are putting the company on slightly shaky stock market
ground for the moment.
     Rafael Villagran, coal analyst for Shearson
Lehman Hutton, says in a new report that continuing
soft prices for gas and precious metals for the rest
of this year and through 1991 will hamper NERCO's
profitability even though NERCO's second-quarter
earnings were higher than Villagran expected.
     He points out that the price of NERCO shares has
fallen in the past two months -- down 14% from a high
of $25/share. That downturn likely will be corrected
in the long run as gas and precious metals prices
recover, Villagan predicts. He adds that pending acid
rain legislation should also boost NERCO stock because
of the company's heavy position in low-sulfur coal.
     NERCO coal shipments in the second quarter of
1990 hit 8.8 million tons, 1 million tons above
Villagran's earlier estimates. Because of an unusually
strong marketing push that resulted in recent spot and
test-burn sales, 1990 company sales should hit 36.2
million tons, Villagran predicts. The company shipped
32 million tons in 1989, he reports.
     The situation in the Middle East, with Iraq
invading Kuwait, could also help NERCO, if the
instability lasts long enough. Investors tend to go
heavily into precious metals during unstable times,
Villagran points out. And an oil shock would tend to
drive up prices for natural gas.
     That aside, Villagran is cutting his estimate of
NERCO's expected profits/share this year from $2.15 to
$1.95, and from $2.50 to $2.25 in 1991. But he has a
high recommendation out for the stock, especially for
investors interested in long-term performance.

NLRB, UMW deal awaits ruling

     A decision is imminent on a settlement between
the National Labor Relations Board and the United Mine
Workers on litigation over secondary boycotts during
the Pittston strike (CO 4/16).
     The settlement would prohibit secondary boycotts
nationwide, and in exchange the union would not be
found guilty of secondary boycott activity in the
Pittston strike. The NLRB's general counsel is
deciding on the merits of that settlement.
     John Falcone, the NLRB attorney working on the
case, said the settlement was filed with the board
along with the objections of most of the 300 companies
involved in the secondary boycotts.
     If the general counsel decides the objections
have merit, the settlement will be sent back to the
parties for further negotiations. If the counsel
decides the objections lack merit, the settlement will
be forwarded to the labor board for approval.
     One source said the counsel is unlikely to
endorse the settlement with the full weight of all
those objections attached to it.

Arch hit with Ky. finding

     Arch Mineral Corp. has been slapped with a pair
of relatively mine violations by the state of Kentucky
that could endanger another project.
     The state Natural Resources Cabinet last week
cited the company for not reclaiming all of a highwall
at a surface mine in Breathitt County, next to the
Robinson Forest. Company attorney Blair Gardner said
that finding will be appealed.
     A second citation has to do with spillover of
site debris onto nearby land owned by the University
of Kentucky. Gardner said the company will clean the
debris and won't appeal the state ruling.
     The state action has larger implications for
delicate negotatiations among the state, the
university and Arch over a 350-acre site Arch has
leased for a surface mine in the Robinson Forest.
     The university claims the site is part of a
watershed it uses for research purposes. Both sides
are talking about a possible land swap to ease
environmental concerns.
     The application to mine the property is pending
with the state.

Big Mama probe could take month

     Kentucky investigators in the triple-fatality Big
Mama mine blast are saying the investigation probably
will not be complete until mid-September.
     Leroy Gross, supervisor for the London district
office of the state Dept. of Mines and Minerals, said
the investigators have not reached any conclusions and
have not ruled anything out.
     Gross had told Coal Outlook  after the explosion
that he thought the investigators would have some
conclusions this week (CO 8/6). He said last
week, however, that the investigation will probably
not be completed until mid-September.
     Charles McGraw, team leader of the Mine Safety
Health and Admin.'s investigation, said investigation
team members are not allowed to talk about the
investigation or findings until a report is published.
He said the agency may issue a preliminary report,
perhaps in September.
     Gross said the investigators interviewed the
witnesses last week but he could not discuss the
findings.

Crisis may hurt coal

     Far from aiding the coal industry, the
current oil crisis may reduce its profits,
suggests Ramesh Malhotra, president of Coal
Network, Inc. of Mason, Ohio.
     Higher oil prices will increase rail, barge
and truck costs, as well as mining costs,
particularly at surface mines, Malhotra notes.
     "At the same time, demand for coal will not
increase, because there will be a very limited
demand as a result of oil shortages or higher oil
prices," he added. Because there is a current
oversupply of coal, producers will not risk
losing market share by increasing prices.
     "Profit margins will go down," he concludes.
     The only wild card is the export market and
the possible increase in demand for U.S. steam
coal worldwide resulting from oil shortages,
Malhotra said.
     Malhotra acknowledged that coal contracts
with pass-thorugh provisions will allow producers
to escape the cost increases.

Lawson says `I told you so'

     Richard Lawson, retired Air Force general and
head of the National Coal Assn., pointed out last week
he was right in his repeated warnings over the years
about U.S. reliance on Middle East oil.
     A continuing crisis over the Iraqi seizure of
Kuwait has driven up world oil prices, and put in
doubt the continued steady supply of oil from that
region.
     Lawson said that for too long the U.S. has been
ignoring the true cost of Middle East oil, including
the cost of "keeping $8 billion aircraft carriers
(and) $3 billion battleships" on patrol in the region,
"and more importantly, the lives of American military
personnel on the front lines."
     Domestic coal needs a greater role in U.S. energy
policy, Lawson said. Coal, along with energy
conservation, domestic oil, natural gas, nuclear
energy and alternative energy sources are "imperative
to assure energy independence and self-determination,"
he points out.

UFI signs coal car deal

     Utility Fuels Inc. has signed a $25 million deal
with the Chicago Central & Pacific Railroad to supply
and maintain 220 coal rail cars in the West.
     The cars, a combination of rotary and bottom dump
units, will transport coal from the Hanna Basin of
Wyoming east to power plants around Chicago. UFI,
based in Houston, is a subsidiary of Houston
Industries Inc.
     This deal moves UFI, which owns the third-biggest
private fleet of rail cars in the U.S., into new
territory. The company owns and operates 2,300 cars
that run 17 million tons/yr of coal and lignite from
Wyoming to six Houston Lighting & Power units in
Texas.

Inter-Mountain clarifies identity

     As of the first of August, Inter-Mountain Coals
Inc. passed into coal industry history and a new
entity began taking its place.
     Parent AMVEST Corp. decided, due in part to
Inter-Mountain's increasing production and size, to
clarify its identity, so Inter-Mountain's name has
been changed to AMVEST Coal Sales Inc.
     "The adoption of the new name," said William
Dickey, executive vice president of Inter-Mountain,
"should clearly communicate both our production
capabilities and our relationship to AMVEST."
Privately held AMVEST Corp. is also involved in oil
and gas exploration and merchant banking.
     Dickey told Coal Outlook that in the past two
fiscal years, Inter-Mountain has produced about 4.5
million tons each year. In the 1991 fiscal year, which
began Aug. 1, he hopes to push that to 5 million tons
from existing operations, which encompass two mines in
Virginia and one in West Virginia.
     Also, said Dickey, the company has a "relatively
aggressive acquisition program," which is looking for
coal mines/properties in the same region as current
operations. All qualities of coal are being
considered, he said, though the ideal properties would
fit with their existing production, including a large
output of high-vol metallurgical coal.

Carboex positions for Ashland buy

     Carboex International, Ltd., the Spanish
coal trader, has notified the Securities and
Exchange Commission that it may increase its
stake in Ashland Coal from 9% to 11.87%.
     This is not exactly a major surprise. David Todd,
a spokesperson for Ashland, notes Carboex was given a
warrant to purchase 450,000 shares of common stock
when the company was restructured two years ago (CO
8/22/88).
     Carboex has not yet exercised the warrant
but has merely informed the SEC that it may do
so, Todd said. The shares would be issued by
Ashland, Todd added.
     The warrant permits Carboex to buy the
shares during the six-month period from Sept. 1,
1990, through Feb. 28, 1991 at a price equal to
two times the price the stock sold for in the
1988 public offering. The 1988 sale price was $11
per share; last week the stock was trading for
about $24/share.
     One Wall Street coal analyst doubts Carboex wants
to up its stake in Ashland. But he suggests Carboex
may be tempted to buy shares if it can "dump" them in
the market for a profit.
     In selling 4.6 million shares of Ashland
Coal common stock to the public in 1988, the
three principle shareholders decreased their
stake. Ashland Oil now owns 46%, Saarbergwerke
A.G. has 14%, and Carboex 9%.
     Saarbergwerke is a West German coal
producing, coal trading, and electricity
generating company owned by the government.
Ashland Oil also owns 50% of Arch Mineral.

eliminating 13 positions in its Lexington, Ky.,
office and 21 positions in its two West Virginia

     The reductions include two positions at the
sales account level at Island Creek Coal Sales.
The company has also transferred seven
Lexington-based employees to the operating
divisions.
     Chairman S.O. "Bud" Ogden said the
reductions and transfers follow a corporate
strategy "to maintain a competitive position in
today's coal market and to place more decision-
making responsibility with the operating
divisions."
     The move is not related to last spring's
reorganization that separated operating and
marketing functions, the company said (CO 5/14).

TVA to buy Kingston coal

     The Tennessee Valley Authority will buy
about 16,000 tons of coal per week under three
new contracts to be reviewed this week by the
federal utility's board of directors.
     The purchases come under its Requisition 23
for the Kingston steam plant. No purchases were
made for John Sevier (see separate brief).
     Manalapan Mining will supply about 23,500
tons/mo via CSX Transportation to Kingston for a
delivered price of $31.06/ton,
136 cents/mmBtu (evaluated), and
124.24 cents/mmBtu (actual). The total term
is six years, but either party can reopen the
contract for any reason after three years.
     Manalapan's agent is Pincelli and
Associates. Its sources are its various mines in
Harlan County, Ky. Specs are 12,500 Btu/lb (as
received), 1.63% dry sulfur, 2.34 lbs/mmBtu of
SO2, and 9.2% ash (as received).
     Bell County Coal Corp. and U.S. Coal Inc.
will each receive 10-year contracts with mutual
reopeners after the first five years.
Norfolk-Southern railroad will deliver the coal.
     Bell County, a unit of James River Coal,
will furnish 7,500 tons/wk for $31.14/ton,
136.32 cents/mmBtu (evaluated), and
124.54 cents/mmBtu (actual). Specs are 12,500
Btu/lb, 1.6% sulfur, 2.3 lbs/mmBtu, and 9.2% ash.
     U.S. Coal will supply 2,500 tons per week
from its Scott County, Tenn., mine for
$31.47/ton, 137.40 cents/mmBtu (evaluated),
and 125.88 cents/mmBtu (actual). Specs are
12,500 Btu/lb, 1.84% sulfur, 2.6 lbs/mmBtu of
SO2, and 9% ash.

TVA reworks Sevier coal pacts

     The Tennessee Valley Authority has
renegotiated one coal its John Sevier steam
plant.
     The agency was able to negotiate prices that are
at least 50 cents/ton less than the best and final
offers it received for John Sevier under Requisition
23, said Greg Nicely, a TVA fuels official.    The
agency therefore "walked away" from the John Sevier
bids, Nicely said.
     Marion Duncan, another TVA official, said he
could only comment on one contract, an RBS Inc.
agreement with a new base delivered price in the
neighborhood of $30/ton, 134.5 cents/mmBtu
(evaluated), and 122.83 cents/mmBtu (actual).
     At the rate of 4,200 tons/wk, RBS will
supply coal from J.A.D., a Virginia supplier, and
Mountain Spur and Harlan-Kyvaco, both of
Kentucky. Guaranteed specs are 12,200 Btu/lb,
1.9% sulfur, and 9% ash, all as received. The
term is three years starting this month.
