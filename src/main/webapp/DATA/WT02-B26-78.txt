<P>
Higher rates of depression observed in women may be linked to differences in biochemistry and childhood socialization that render some women more vulnerable than men to the illness, according to the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH).  The NIMH study and other research was reported in a special November 1993 issue of the Journal of Affective Disorders devoted to women and depression.
<P>
"Research into the biological and psychological underpinnings of depression is beginning to yield findings that help to explain why women are twice as likely to develop depression," said former NIMH Director Frederick K. Goodwin, M.D.  "As we learn more about gender-specific factors in the development of depression, we will be better able to design specialized and more effective treatments for both women and men with the disorder.
<P>
Findings reported in this issue of the Journal of Affective Disorders are reported below.
<P>
Dr. Myrna M. Weissman of Columbia University's New York State Psychiatric Institute and colleagues examined sex differences in the rates of depressive illnesses in the United States, Canada, Germany, and New Zealand. 
<P>
Across the four countries, they found almost the same rates of bipolar (manic-depressive) disorder in men and women, but higher rates of major depression and dysthymia in women.  Major depression first strikes in the mid- to late-20s for both sexes, and while the rate of depression in the United States in men born since 1945 has been rising, it appears to have stabilized in women.
<P>
In research on biological mechanisms underlying depression, Dr. Uriel Halbreich and Lucille A. Lumley, M.S., both of the State University of New York at Buffalo, compared neurochemical and neuroendocrine function in men and women. 
<P>
They found gender differences in several functions of the norepinephrine and serotonin neurotransmitter systems, in activities of dopamine and acetylcholine, and in certain operations of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal system. 
<P>
These findings suggest that vulnerability to depression, as well as its actual expression, might be related to short- and long-term effects of gonadal hormones.  These hormones probably play an important role in the multi-faceted and multi-dimensional mechanisms underlying mood and behavior.
<P>
Dr. Diane N. Ruble of the New York University and colleagues, in a literature review of socialization processes in childhood, discussed various social factors that may lead to girls' greater vulnerability to depression.  For example, girls are usually more closely watched and protected than boys, making them less likely to develop an independent sense of mastery. 
<P>
This low sense of self-efficacy, the researchers reported, may lead to feelings of little control, pessimism, and hopelessness.  Theorists of learned helplessness believe all of these are related to the development of depression.  This review also suggested that pre-pubertal girls sometimes have more depressive symptoms than boys. 
<P>
This finding supports the view that women's higher rates of depression cannot be solely explained by hormone-related changes associated with the onset of puberty.  This is important because it suggests that prevention and intervention efforts should be directed at socialization processes during the early school years.
<P>
Dr. Ronald Kessler of the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor and colleagues reported that there is no difference between the sexes in the overall course of depression once it occurs.  Men and women who had a history of depression were equally likely to have been chronically depressed or to have experienced an acute recurrence of a depressive episode in the past year. 
<P>
This finding comes from the National Comorbidity Survey, which was conducted in the United States from 1990 to 1992 and involved nearly 8,100 respondents.
<P>

<A NAME = "inade"><H2>INADEQUATE DEPRESSION TREATMENT</H2></A><A HREF = "#top">[Return to Top]</A><br>
<P>
A study of the recognition and treatment of depression has found that only 23 percent of depressed patients who could benefit from anti-depressants were receiving these medications and 39 percent of them were getting sub-therapeutic doses. 
<P>
Published in the May 1994 American Journal of Psychiatry, the study by Dr. Kenneth B. Wells of the RAND Corporation also found that patients of psychologists and allied mental health professionals were less likely to receive anti-depressants regardless of the severity of their illness.  Additionally, depressed patients in HMOs were twice as likely to receive fewer visits and to be treated with anti-anxiety medications instead of anti-depressants. 
<P>
These results reinforce previous research showing that insufficient numbers of depressed patients are receiving appropriate treatment and that clinicians often fail to provide the kinds of treatment indicated by efficacy studies.

<A NAME = "justb"><H2>JUST BETWEEN US</H2></A><A HREF = "#top">[Return to Top]</A><br>
<P>
In this column, I'm going to tell you a story full of unnecessary suffering and grief.  It's been a nightmare to remember and to write about.
<P>
The problem is words. Incredible power is compressed into words. Too many words and notions applied to consumers are poisoned by prejudice.  Stigma insinuates such subtly degrading lies and masquerades in such seductively simple half-truths.
<P>
Wherever the truth about mental illness is more complex than the words regularly used to describe it, that's where consumers suffer helplessly and too often needlessly.  The suffering is because no one sees accurately what's really happening to us or is willing to work with us to stop the tragedies before they happen.  
<P>
The heart of my story is a friend, a friend from the knob country of the rural South, quiet, honest, hard-working, and for parts of his life caught in the iron grip of unreasoning terror.
<P>
He could be painfully shy, withdrawn.  Even those who loved him aren't sure just when he slipped silently into paranoia.  He never graduated from school.  He was too ill.  
<P>
In the grip of driving terror he believed he'd be killed if he didn't defend himself.  He lashed out in explosive violence and killed.  He was found not guilty by reason of insanity and was remanded to a forensics facility where he was treated successfully and released.
<P>
I met him on the bus.  He was lost.  It was a bitter winter and he was wearing a short-sleeved cotton shirt.  Miraculously, he let me give him my sweatshirt and welcomed me as friend. 
<P>
We met more on the phone than in person.  We saw each other regularly on the bus to the local mental health center.  The second time I saw him he told me his story.  He astounded me by his halting openness, his absolute honesty.  Simply, with no evasions, no excuses, he told his tale.  To share that took incredible courage.
<P>
Over time it was clear:  his meds just weren't working as well as they once had.  He was slipping away.  I asked if he'd told his therapist.  He had.  He did again.  He hoped to see a psychiatrist about a meds change.  The available appointment was just too far in the future.  His life was getting scary.
<P>
We urged him to visit emergency intake so he could perhaps access a psychiatrist without the endless wait.  Or, we thought, he'd end up admitted to our local state hospital where he'd been before.
<P>
The mental health center where he went for treatment relies more on counseling than on state-of-the-art meds work.  Come the annual budget crunch, the director is famous among consumers for cutting psychiatry hours rather than talk therapy.  Again my friend tried to schedule a meds visit, but all he could get was another therapy appointment in a few days.  He was deteriorating, becoming volatile and agitated.
<P>
A neighbor, concerned and frightened, took him the next morning to emergency intake.  All he got was words. 
<P>
Later, a family down the street found him wandering, disoriented, and called the police.  The police talked to the neighbor who'd taken him to the center that morning, then took him back to emergency intake.  The person who saw him apparently didn't assess the acuity of the situation, even though my friend's complete records were at the center, and they included details of the not-guilty-by-reason-of-insanity verdict.
<P>
Late that evening, after he left the center, the police arrested him for the death of his neighbor, the very person who had taken him to the center in the morning looking for help and care.
<P>
Headlines shrieked, "Mentally Ill Killer Let Loose in Suburban Neighborhood," "Psychotic Killer Strikes Again."
<P>
We saw him in jail awaiting trial.  He wasn't on medication.  He talked word salad.  He was clearly psychotic.
<P>
A mental health professional characterized my friend to the press as a treatment-resistant, uncooperative case.  No one questioned that description or the appropriateness or the effectiveness of the treatment he actually received from that mental health center.
<P>
He was found guilty of first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison without possibility of parole.  He has yet to receive effective medication or appropriate treatment, and he is too ill to avoid the predators inside the bars.
<P>
Our extremely conservative governor mentioned him as a killer who would be kept off our streets by the Republican initiative to build 27 new prisons.  The governor wants to "privatize," or sell, our state mental hospitals to pay for the 27 new prisons.  
<P>
What has this to do with words?  I'm desperate to know, Was all this suffering inevitable because my friend was treatment-resistant and uncooperative?  Or did the treatment system catastrophically fail my friend, his neighbor, and our community?  What about the right to timely, humane, effective care?
<P>
