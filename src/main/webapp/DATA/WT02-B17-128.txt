<h2>Environmental Benefits</h2>
Biomass fuels produce virtually no sulfur emissions, helping to 
mitigate acid rain.
<p>
While carbon dioxide is emitted during biomass combustion, an 
equal amount of carbon dioxide is absorbed from the atmosphere 
during the biomass growth phase, thus biomass fuels "recycle" 
atmospheric carbon, minimizing global warming impacts.

<p>
The use of waste biomass reduces the volume of material sent to 
landfills, extending the life of existing landfills.

<p>
Biomass combustion results in lsess ash than coal, reducing ash 
disposal costs and landfill space requirements. The biomass ash 
can also be used as a soil amendment in farm land.

<p>
Perennial energy crops (grasses and trees) have distinctly lower 
environmental impacts than conventional farm crops that are 
replanted annually. Energy crops require less fertilization and 
herbicides and provide much more vegetative cover throughout the 
year, providing protection against soil erosion and watershed 
quality deterioration, as well as improved wildlife cover.
