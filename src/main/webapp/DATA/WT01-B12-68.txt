<H3><A NAME="acne">ACNE</A></H3>
<P>
After suffering for 19 years with acne, I stumbled upon the cure:
Acidophilus <A HREF="msali.htm">(SALIVAREX) </A>(among other friendly 
bacteria), but I wanted you to know that there is definitely a connection 
between acne and a deficiency of friendly bacteria.

I intend to spread this information as far and wide as I can.  Modern
dermatologists are not using this info for their patients.  This must
change.
</P>

All the best,</P>

<H3><A NAME="arthritis">ARTHRITIS</A></H3>
<P>
I have had arthritis in my knees for about 8 years. It got so bad I had to 
take an early retirement on a medical disability. The doctor had me on the 
prescription Predizone (of course it has some nasty side effects). I have 
been taking the <A HREF="mopc.htm">PROANTHENOLS OPC-85</A> for about 7 months now. I have more 
energy than I have had at anytime during the last three years.  I used to 
have to take a nap once a day, I know longer need this as I have much more 
energy. I am able to walk much better now with virtually no pain. 
<A HREF="mopc.htm">PROANTHENOLS OPC-85 </A> has been a God send.</P>

I am feeling a lot better myself since taking <A HREF="mopc.htm">
PROANTHENOLS OPC-85 </A>. My arthritic leg has been feeling much better 
with less and less pain killer needed to function.

I hope that I can share this wonderful product with others. I have been 
talking about our personal health results.

I am 80 years old and have been frustrated and in pain for years now. My
arthritic fingers hurt terribly and were all deformed. I couldn't really
even close my hand. After using <A HREF="mwonder.htm"> WONDER GEL, </A> 
just a couple of days, they have already started to improve. Now they don't
hurt any more and I can make a fist once again. You can bet i will never be
without it!

<H3><A NAME="sleep">SLEEP PROBLEMS</A></H3><P>
For many years, I have had problems sleeping. I would fall asleep and
sleep throughout the night, but wake up feeling exhusted! It did not matter
how long I slept, I would never have much energy during the day, and needed
frequent naps. I then began taking <A HREF="mmel.htm"> Somniset</A>, and 
almost immediately began to notice that I woke up feeling refreshed! It was
like being a kid again! I do not even get tired during the day anymore.
<A HREF="mmel.htm"> Somniset</A> works!

I had been taking a highly addictive sleeping medication called Xanax
for over a year. I first started out on Xanax with only 2mg, however,
by the time I was introduced to Life Plus I was taking 15 to 30mg of
Xanax every night, and by 2:00 in the morning I'd be awake and done sleeping
for the night.<P>
When I got my <A HREF="mmel.htm"> Somniset</A>, I started out with one, then
two or more. I found that what worked best for me was three tablets 45
minutes before I go to bed. I sleep all through the night, and wake in the
morning refreshed and just raring to go. <A HREF="mmel.htm"> Somniset</A>
has changed my life!

My son is thirteen years old and suffering from Attention Deficit Disorder.

after one week of the <A HREF="mopc.htm">Proanthenols Bio-Complex</A>, and
is doing tremendous.<P>
He had sever mood swings, and he no longer has them. I recommend this product

I thought I would share with you some of my results on the 
<A HREF="moxygen.htm">Oxy-Gen Caps.</A> I run for exercise, generally 30 to 
50 miles per week.  The third morning on Life Plus products, I had taken my 
<A HREF="moxygen.htm">Oxy-Gen Caps</A> early before I started running.  By 
the time I had passed the third or fourth mile, I thought I was on rocket 
fuel!  I could not believe the improved energy and endurance 
that I had.  But one thing in particular impressed me:  I felt I had a 
clarity and a clearness of thought that I hadn't had for a long time.  I 
have now been on Life Plus products for seven weeks, taking 
<A HREF="mopc.htm">Proanthenols</A>, <A HREF="mmicro.htm">Micro-Mins,</A>
<A HREF="mtvm.htm"> TVM-49,</A> <A HREF="mprotx.htm"> ProtxII </A> and 
others, but the <A HREF="moxygen.htm">Oxy-Gen Caps</A> have really 
impressed me.  Thanks for developing a superior product line.

I have been taking <A HREF="mmicro.htm">Micro-Mins </A>for about three 
weeks now. I've noticed an increase in energy as well as an overall feeling 
of well being. I've lost five pounds (happily) because I keep busy and 
don't crave sweets! My family has commented  again and again on how I am 
more upbeat , energetic and positive throughout the day. Micro-Mins are 
just absolutely marvelous!</P>

At Christmas my brothers and sisters, and their families had met at my 
parents. The next day and for several days thereafter one by one virtually 
everyone in my family had gotten sick, started vomiting and had various 
symptons of some virus. With a couple of exceptions: my mother, wife and 
myself. We had one thing in common, we had all been taking 
<A HREF="mcombat.htm">COMBAT </A>from Life Plus. I continued to take it 
all winter and did not get one single cold. This is one great product. I 
now take it everyday.</P>

<H3><A NAME="ind">INDIGESTION/HEARTBURN</A></H3>
<P>
I personally know several  people who have had bad stomach (indigestion) 
problems who the doctor had on an expensive prescription ($80.00 a bottle).
Within one week of taking <A HREF="msust.htm">SUSTENASE </A>they stopped 
taking their prescription.
I had been seeing a doctor for severe stomach problems and indigestion,
the doctor had been giving me this expensive prescription medicine. The 
medicine wasn't working very well as I was in severe discomfort. The doctor 
said there wasn't anything more he could do for me.  Then I was introduced 
to <A HREF="msust.htm">SUSTENASE, </A>this product has been a virtual 
miracle for me, as I no longer suffer from indigestion or heartburn. 
Now when I see ads on TV for indigestion and stomach remedies I laugh 
but I also get mad, as I feel these companies are conning the American 
public. These products advertised only mask the real problem which is 
improper digestion, and their remedy is to give you a product which 
prevents the stomach from producing what it is supposed to - stomach acid, 
which is needed for proper digestion. This is criminal, I believe every 
adult should take this product, it is phenomenol.</P>

 A woman in our church had been seeing a Doctor and getting  prescriptions 
for her stomach problems. She took <A HREF="msust.htm">SUSTENASE </A>for 1 
week and has thrown her prescription medicine in the garbage. This is one 
excited woman. She commented "I ate Mexican food for the first time in 
three years". This is an excellent product for heartburn and indigestion. 
Antacids only relieve the symptoms  - this product actually helps you to 
digest your food better. </P>

I`m a waitress and someone up here gave me a bottle of <A HREF="msilva.htm">
Colloidal Silver </A>after I was told by my doctor that I had a 
serious viral infection. I used the product and went back to my doctor.  
He couldn`t believe it. I`m living proof.  I know it helped save my life.</P>

We have had instant success with <A HREF="msilva.htm">Colloidal Silver </A>
and immune compromised patients.  A few examples are: Pink eye (topical) 
totally resolved in less than six hours; Re-current sinus infections 
(oral ingestion) resolved in eight days; Acute cuticle infections-
(topical)- twenty four hours. Another major area in which we have improved 
our clinical results is in the area of bowel detoxification and dysbiosis.
The <A HREF="msilva.htm">Colloidal Silver </A>has provided excellent 
removal of abnormal intestinal bacteria;  also it has proved to be a great 
adjunct to our Candida albicans, Epstein Barr Virus and Chronic Fatigue 
Syndrome protocols.</P>

<H3><A NAME="kidney">KIDNEY DIALYSIS</A></H3>
<P>
In May of 1994 I started on Kidney Dialysis and had a real bad time of it.
My sponsor  introduced the Pycnogenols  <A HREF="mopc.htm">
PROANTHENOLS OPC-85 </A> to me and I spoke with my Doctor about it and he 
said I should not take it. I later saw a pharmicist discussing it on TV 
and I asked  him about it, and he said it would help.  I started taking it 
in January of 1995 and it put me "back in the saddle again"!</P>

My husband has had MS for 15 years and since taking the <A HREF="mopc.htm">
PROANTHENOLS OPC-85 </A> the vice-like cramps he gets in his legs have been 
greatly diminished. He no longer gets headaches. He sleeps a lot sounder 
now because he doesn't have the leg jerks that kept waking him up. He also 
has more energy now.</P>

My wife has fallen in love with the <A HREF="mopc.htm">PROANTHENOLS 
OPC-85 </A> because she threw out all the pms stuff ( emprims, asprin, 
motrin, etc.). This amazing nutrient has made a new woman of her, and I am 
feeling a lot better myself since taking it. My arthritic leg has been 
feeling much better with less and less pain killer needed to function.
I hope that I can share this wonderful product with others. I have been 
talking about our personal healthy results and have hung little flyers
all over town. I also obtained some materials from Life Plus for 
distribution.</P>

Hi, my name is Kathy . My husband and I have been using <A HREF="mshape.htm">
Shape Plus </A>for about a month and a half now. It has really worked great for 
both of us.  It helps curb our appetite and we don't get nervous or jumpy. 
My husband has lost 7 lbs and I have lost 5 lbs. Friends have begun to ask 
want we have been doing and we tell them we have been taking

I can't take pills because I am pregnant, so <A HREF="mwonder.htm">
