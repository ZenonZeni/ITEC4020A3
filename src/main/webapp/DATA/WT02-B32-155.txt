<P>Omnitel-Pronto Italia SpA, in which Olivetti is the main shareholder, was
awarded Italy's second network operating licence in GSM wireless telephony in
1994. Other major shareholders in the venture include Bell Atlantic
International, AirTouch International and Cellular Communications International
of the United States and Telia of Sweden. </P>
<P>In December 1995, just ten months after construction began, Omnitel
initiated GSM digital service in Italy. Currently, geographic coverage has grown
to about 50 percent of the land areas of Italy. Omnitel reported 100,000
customers by its third month of operation. As of June 1996, the company reported
300,000 customers. Omnitel has attracted the largest number of customers ever
acquired by a new cellular service provider during its first months of
commercial operation.</P>
<P>In the future, the company expects to build a digital network infrastructure
offering integrated mobile voice and data facilities and value added services to
broad categories of users, a first step towards the development of gateways to
the &quot;information superhighways.&quot; Investments are expected to total
more than 2,000 billion lire.</P>
