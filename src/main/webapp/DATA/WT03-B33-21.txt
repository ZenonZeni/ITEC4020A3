The Goldilocks Economy 

The 1996 brand of U.S. economic porridge should be just like in
the Goldilocks & The Three Bears folk tale -- "not too hot, not
too cold, but just right." Which means an American recipe that
calls for slower growth, lower interest rates, and virtually zero
inflation. Signaling a protracted slowdown at the end of 1995, the
recently released "Leading Economic Indicators" fell by 0.3% in
November, after dropping 0.5% last October, and 0.1% last
September. Some economists forecast (but not with much certainty)
a U.S. recession in the second half of 1996. We don't think that
will happen, especially with a President who is up for reelection
this Fall.
  
Scariest part of the Goldilocks Economy: What the Three Bears will
do. No, not Wall Street bears. It's that threesome of stubborn
political animals in Washington -- Groaning Dole, Growling
Gingrich, and Clawing Clinton. The budget mess sure doesn't
instill confidence in business circles, especially since a deal to
cut the deficit could quickly spur lower interest rates. But, did
you notice during the Government shutdown how smoothly America was
running without the Feds on the job? Maybe those bears should just
hibernate this Winter. Yep. Just sleep it off.
  
Less Kicks in '96 

After growing a bounteous 40% in 1995, semiconductor industry
sales this year may post only half that growth rate, around 20% to
22%. And by 1997, that growth could be halved again, or about 10%
to 12%. However, the rate of capital spending on chip production
equipment will outstrip the sales of ICs during the next 24 months
as chipmakers scramble to catch up with robust demand. One
memory/logic IC exec indicated to us that putting up fabs fast
enough wasn't the issue, rather waiting to receive steppers from
its vendor was the hangup.
  
Confirming that growth is moderating, the industry's book-to-bill
ratio slipped in December 1995 to 1.09 from 1.10 in November and
below expectations of 1.11. Industry orders, however, continued to
rise on a year-to-year comparative basis. The SIA, which manages
the b:b data, sees North American semiconductor sales rising 29.6%
this year, about 10% above our projection.
  
Crushed Chip Stocks ... They say that all good things must come to
an end. Like the ballyhooed marriage of rock legend Elvis
Presley's daughter, Lisa Marie, who filed for divorce from pop
king Michael Jackson after only 20 months of matrimony. Another
honeymoon that's over, at least for now: Investors and
semiconductor stocks. After starting to peak late last Summer,
many chip shares have crashed, although late last week some of
them were rebounding, driven by higher Q4 earnings. (For details,
see our premier section, High Tech Equities, Pg. 7.)

Poly Shortage Scare 

Whether there's a looming shortage of polysilicon depends on whom
you are asking the question. Last year SIBS had predicted a poly
shortage could crop up as early as 1996. Now others are saying the
same thing. The advent of 8-inch (200mm) wafers coupled with
rising IC demand will cause poly demand to outstrip poly supply
starting now and persisting at least through 1999. Those once
ample inventories of poly are quickly being worked off as
chipmakers put up new 8-inch fabs at a feverish pace. But, then,
nobody ever said there wouldn't be growing pains on the way to
becoming a $300 billion-plus industry.
  
Electronic Sales Surge 

The semiconductor industry is booming because the business of its
customers is booming. Worldwide sales of electronic products
catapulted to $334.7 billion in the first nine months of 1995, up
strongly from the $285 billion in the comparable nine-month period
of 1994, according to the AEA. Components orders in those nine
months shot up to $100.8 billion in 1995, from $76.9 billion in
1994; while orders for computers and office equipment jumped to
$83 billion from $72.6 billion, year-to-year.
  
Closely tracking these higher sales have been rising electronics
employment. More than 2.5 million work in the U.S. electronics
industry, up 5.6% from 1994. Semiconductors are a hot sector. In
Silicon Valley, for example, while hiring in hardware has been
soft, that has been easily offset by chipmakers' and software
firms' hiring. For example, Silicon Valley lost 4,000 computer
hardware jobs in 1994, that was more than made up by the newly-
created 11,500 software and semiconductors positions in the same
year. -- Paul Plansky, SIBS Editor-in-Chief

Microchip Technology
(OTC: MCHP)

Microchip Technology reported record sales and net income for its
third fiscal 1996 quarter ended December 31, 1995.
Net sales for the third quarter of fiscal 1996 were $78.1 million,
up 44% over $54.2 million reported in the third quarter of fiscal
1995 and up 10% sequentially from the prior quarter.
  
Excluding a $11.4 million write-off associated with in-process
technology acquired during the quarter, net income for the third
quarter of fiscal 1996 was $14.0 million, up 48% over net income
of $9.4 million in the third quarter of fiscal 1995.
  
After recognizing the one-time technology acquisition-related
costs, net income was $5.8 million.
  
With sales of OTP microcontrollers becoming such a large portion
of the company's overall business, Microchip reorganized its
product divisions during the third quarter.
  
The reorganization is intended to focus the company's resources on
broader aspects of the OTP microcontroller opportunity and entails
the former Logic Products division being split to form the new
Standard Microcontroller division and Advanced Microcontroller
division.
  
Microchip believes that the field-programmable segment will
continue to comprise an ever-larger share of the total
microcontroller market.
  
During the quarter, Microchip also acquired the technology and
marketing rights for the Keeloq secure data transmission products
developed by Nanoteq Ltd. of the Republic of South Africa.     

This type of technology is considered vital for the next generation
of unidirectional security devices used in applications such as
automobile keyless remote entry, auto immobilizer systems,
automatic garage door openers, and various "smart" transaction card
applications.
  
Microchip anticipates the first product introduction from the
acquired technology will take place in the first quarter of
calendar 1996.

Xilinx
(OTC: XLNX)

Xilinx recorded revenue and earnings growth for the third quarter
ended December 30, 1995.       

Revenues rose to $144.1 million, up 58% from the $91.3 million
reported during the third quarter of fiscal 1995 and 2% from the
$141.2 million in the immediately preceding quarter. 

Net income rose 107% to $32.2 million compared with last year's
$15.6 million and 8% above last quarter's $29.8 million. 

For the first nine months ended December 30, 1995, revenues
increased 67% to $411.1 million from $245.9 million reported in
last year's comparable period. 

Net income for the first nine months of fiscal 1996 rose 72% to
$67.6 million compared with $39.4 million in the first nine months
of fiscal 1995. Excluding the impact of non-recurring charges,
operating income, net income, and earnings per share increased by
108%, 112%, and 98%, respectively.
  
Gross margins increased to 64.1% of revenues from 63.4% last
quarter due to continued improvement in manufacturing yields, the
strength of the dollar, and a changing product mix.
  
Operationally, selling, general and administrative expenses as
percentage of revenues declined for the fourth consecutive quarter
as did R&D spending. These two factors combined to expand operating
margins to a record level of 34.2%, up from last quarter's 32.3%
  
While revenues increased sequentially, this quarter's performance
was impacted by a slowdown in bookings, particularly in the early
part of the quarter. 

Highlights for this quarter included the growth of the XC5200
family, an alternative to gate arrays. 

In other company news, Bernard Vonderschmitt has stepped down as
CEO, but remains on as chairman. The new CEO is Willem Roelandts.

Rumor or Truth?
Sun Microsystems' Hot-and-Cold Talks with Apple May
Bear Fruit at $33 Per Share

If Sun Eats Apple,
Will PowerPC Die?
                                                                       
With the board of Apple Computer (OTC: AAPL) slated to meet
tomorrow (January 23rd), Wall St. rumors have been flying that
embattled Apple may be ready to accept a buyout bid of $33 per
share, or about $4 billion, from workstation and server powerhouse
Sun Microsystems (OTC: SUNW).
  
As big as that $4B number sounds, it would be only half what Apple
was said to seek from IBM during merger talks in the fall of 1994.
Neither company would confirm an a reportedly "imminent"
acquisition of Apple by Sun, but investors voted by driving AAPL
shares up and SUNW stock down.
  
Despite past successes with its Macintosh line, Apple lately has
been a loser. It lost $68 million in its most recent quarter, has
been losing PC market share, and worst of all, is losing respect. 

Even if Apple stays independent, it appears doubtful that its CEO
Michael Spindler will survive this corporate crisis. There are
reports Spindler will either be forced out and see his management
role greatly diminished.
  
Internet Interest?

One reason Sun might want Apple is to enhance its Internet
strategy. Apple's Macintoshes can be used to create World Wide Web
sites, and the PC maker has also developed a $500 system, that when
connected to a TV and phone, provides low-cost Internet access.
  
Next possibility: Sun could tap into Apple's well-established
retail PC channels to push its own version of a "network computer".
Apple also has in place a formidable sales force in Japan, which,
until recently, was one of the strongest U.S.-based PC makers
there.

Other Suitors

Sun had been in takeover talks with Apple earlier but these
discussions were broken off when the two computer firms couldn't
agree on an acquisition price.
Even in this newest round, the buyout price could once again be the
spoiler.
  
Other suitors that were said to seek a buyout deal with Apple have
included software maven Oracle (see box story at left); Hewlett-
Packard, which wants a stronger home PC market position; and
Motorola, which provides the PowerPC chip that drives the Mac.
Among Asian giants which may have courted Apple: Cannon, Toshiba,
and Sony.
  
But this time it's different. Apple has "serious problems", its own
chairman A.C. ("Mike") Markkula Jr. admitted. Markkula, a former
Intel microprocessor marketing manager (circa, 1970s), said he
wouldn't be able to comment on whether Apple is for sale "until the
time is right."

Despite its current woes, the Apple brand name is strong. Apple
pioneered the PC business, unveiling the Apple I in 1976, and the
Apple II in 1977. That was way ahead of IBM, which didn't offer its
PC until 1981. Apple's Macintosh was smash hit, but its Lisa and
earliest version of the Newton PDA bombed. It's been a long battle,
but it looks like the Intel/Microsoft camp has won.
  
From an MPU perspective, if Sun consumes Apple, we'd say the
PowerPC is a dead part. Apple has been the only very large volume
user of the vaunted processor chip co-developed by Apple, Motorola,
and IBM to challenge Intel's Pentium dominance. If a Sun/Apple deal
does happens, will future ads be touting, "the SPARC Inside"?

Oracle's Odyssey
CEO Ellison Treks to
Asia to Sell 'Magic Box'

While technocrats were buzzing about Sun longing to chew up Apple
(see story at left), the CEO of another computer firm, software
giant Oracle Corp., took off recently in another direction -- the
Far East.
  
Oracle CEO Larry Ellison's mission: To line up Asian manufacturers
for an Oracle project he has taken under his wings: a $500 network
computer (the "NC") for use by the masses to access the Internet.
  
Among countries reportedly on Ellison's itinerary: Japan, South
Korea, and Taiwan.
  
Although Oracle's official line from its Redwood City, CA
headquarters is "no comment," SIBS' sources have identified Korea's
Goldstar and Samsung as two possible partners to build Oracle's NC.
  
Not as powerful as a PC, the NC will let users surf the net; send
e-mail; do word processing.

Semiconductors Collapse
As Some Profits Fall Short

Intel (OTC: INTC)'s stock tumbled after it posted disappointing Q4

Zoran Zoran Finds IPO Window

Despite weaker chip stock prices, Zoran (OTC: ZRAN) managed to
squeeze through the IPO window recently and is now trading well
above its initial target price. Pre-IPO, Israel's Elron Industries
owned 32% of Zoran. Since shipping a low-cost chip for digital
video and audio systems in 1991, Zoran has yet to log an annual
profit. Recent price: About $26.

What's Up Down Under?
Quality Semiconductor Buys
Wafer Foundry and Design Center from Australian Firm

Quality Semiconductor of Santa Clara, CA (OTC: QUAL) has reached
a definitive agreement to purchase a fully operational wafer
foundry business and product design center from AWA
Microelectronics (AWAM), a unit of AWA Limited in Sydney,
Australia.
  
The AWAM assets will be acquired by a newly-formed subsidiary of
Quality called Quality Semiconductor Australia Pty, Ltd. (QSA).
Purchase price of the AWAM facility is US$5.6 million. The
transaction is expected to close by the end of this month.
  
The deal also calls for parent firm AWA Limited to subscribe
US$1.25 million of preferred shares in the new subsidiary, QSA, for
working capital.
  
Between July 1997 and July 1999, Quality will make the final
payment of about US$7.5 million.
  
Quality Semi has also signed a strategic alliance pact with AWA
Limited to jointly develop new products and technologies.
  
24 Hours Per Day

The six-inch wafer fab facility is currently running seven days per
week, 24 hours per day. After the acquisition, the plant will
continue serving existing AWAM foundry customers while providing
Quality added flexibility. 

During the next two quarters, Quality plans to secure additional
semiconductor production equipment to migrate the current facility
to deep submicron process technologies.
  
Quality Semiconductor, specializing in high-performance logic chips
and logic-intensive specialty memory ICs, sees the AWAM acquisition
as a way to refine its product and proprietary process development,
accelerate its time-to-market, and, aided by shorter lead times,
improve its productivity.
  
AWA Limited, formed 83 years ago, is a leading Australian
electronics company with a strong export business in Asia. Upon
closing of the deal, AWAM's managing director John Dougall will
join the board of directors of QSA (Quality Semiconductor
Australia, Pty., Ltd.)

Quality Semi's products target systems makers in networking, PC,
and workstation markets.

Apple Backs IC Startup
Exponential Technology

Apple Computer (OTC: AAPL), whose own fortunes have taken some bad
turns lately (taking a horrendous fourth quarter loss and having
CEO Michael Spindler placed on the endangered species list), has
invested in privately-held Exponential Technology of San Jose, CA,
which plans to develop superfast microprocessor chips.
  
Exponential, a 2 1/2-year-old firm, is focused on cloning -- and
surpassing -- the PowerPC technology jointly developed by Apple,
Motorola, and IBM. The startup's MPUs, due to be available in early
1997, are expected to be two to three times faster than comparable
PowerPC engines while also being Apple Macintosh- and IBM PC-
compatible.
  
So far, Exponential has raised $15 million. Apple, whose position
in the fledgling venture was originally at 20%, has seen that stake
diluted by other investors. Joining Apple as Exponential investors
are Venrock Associates, Nazem & Co.. and Woodside Fund. Also former
Apple technical guru Jean-Louis Glasee, who now heads up Be, Inc.,
has contributed personal funds.
  
Exponential's two founders -- George Taylor and Jim Blomgren -- are
both IC designers. Taylor's background includes stints at Sun
Microsystems, MIPS, and BIT (Bipolar Integrated Technology).
Blomgren was also previously with Sun.
  
Rick Shriner, a former Apple VP, is Exponential's CEO, while Gordon
Campbell, who started up Chips and Technologies and once headed
SEEQ, is Exponential's chairman.

Answering the Spread Spectrum Call

It's a classic IC startup story: A small band of industry veterans
has focused on a niche opportunity -- wireless communications, with
emphasis on the cordless telephone market. But the fledgling
venture, Wireless Logic, Inc. (WLI) of San Jose, CA must move
quickly to capture a sizable share of that business before larger
competitors start challenging its early lead.
  
That competition is indeed formidable, including such foes as AMI,
Rockwell, Stanford Telecom, and Zilog (see  Table (available only
in printed version)s 1 & 2). Short-term, the battle is for chips
that play in cordless phones and wireless telecom products. Long-
term, WLI is planning next-generation devices to target simplex and
duplex consumer wireless markets such as phones, home
communications, and computers.
  
After quietly forming in 1992, Wireless Logic is now emerging from
its R&D phase to hawk what it claims is the industry's first low-
cost spread spectrum (dubbed S3P) communications processor.
  
The S3P processor operates in the 900MHz spectrum, which is
projected to rapidly replace the 46MHz-to-49MHz products currently
on the market. The S3P is designed as part of a low-cost
architecture supporting full-duplex voice link and simplifies
spread spectrum technology in cordless phones.
  
Atmel: Foundry & Investor

Privately-held WLI, chartered as a Bermuda corporation, did not
report revenues in 1995. Funding has come from the founders,
private investors, manufacturing partners, and the Hong Kong
Government.
  
Atmel Corporation (OTC: ATML), which is Wireless Logic's IC
foundry, also has exclusive marketing rights to WLI products in
North America, Europe, and Brazil; while WLI concentrates on Asia.
Atmel and some Atmel executives are also investors in WLI, but
neither firm would disclose the dollar amount. A secondary investor
is chipmaker American Microsystems (AMI), which also does some
foundry chores for WLI.
  
Last year, WLI closed another financing round from private sources
in order to ramp production of the expected shift to 900MHz
products this year. In December 1993, the Hong Kong Government
funded WLI with HK$10 million, the largest "Applied R&D Fund" ever.
WLI was the first hardware firm to receive such funding.
  
Partnering With Customers

An estimated 90% of the world's cordless phones are made in Asia.
Several of these Asian OEMs, anticipating next-generation phone
products, came to WLI's founders to request a solution. The
founders determined these elements for a successful market entry
were present:

A large installed base of low-frequency cordless telephones;

Pent-up demand based on the limitation these relatively primitive
(low-frequency) devices;

An in-place manufacturing and distribution infrastructure; and

Higher-powered spread spectrum technology (which greatly extends
the operating range of cordless telephones) was approved by the
FCC.
  
At its San Jose HQ (right next door to Sierra Semiconductor),
Wireless Logic performs R&D and marketing. It also maintains a
office in Hong Kong, within easy reach of the Asian makers of
cordless telephones.
  
Finding Markets, Filling Channels

Key characteristics of the cordless telephone market which create
barriers to entry for new players are:

It's a replacement market; It's also a high-volume consumer market;
It has very high growth rates; It requires technical support; and
It demands a total system design approach (in order words, you
can't just create a chip and drop it into a socket).
  
Although WLI had a chip designed, it worked with makers of cordless
phones for another 1 1/2 years to create a finished 900MHz spread
spectrum radio product.
  
The main channel for Wireless Logic to sell its chips has been
through value-added distributors in Asia. The startup chipmaker
provides these outlets with technical support and applications
engineering. WLI's distributor line-up includes: CTI in Taiwan;
Eastele in Hong Kong; WinEdge in Singapore; and FM Korea.
  
Approximately 18 million cordless telephones were sold in 1994. WLI
investor Atmel estimates this market will eventually be counted in
the "tens of millions of units." Looking at  Table (available only
in printed version) 3 on the next page, we see that if the
projected U.S. market size of 21.1 million units is realized by
1998, and if 25% of those units are 900MHz devices, then that
portion of the market would be about a $1 billion available market.
  
Wireless Logic isn't alone in its bullish assessment of this market
potential. Besides WLI executives, Atmel, AMI, and the Hong Kong
Government, individual investors in the company include:

Paul Lui, founder of Micronics Semiconductor; Eric Ochiltree, a VP
at Exar Corp; Jerry Zis, VP of marketing at Analog Devices, Inc.
(ADI); Dave Kress Jr., ADI's director of applications; and two
Atmel Corporation executives: Gus Perlegos, GM and co-founder; and
John Bryant, director of marketing for the chipmaker's complex
logic products.
  
Focusing on the Products

What's driving the cordless phone market are users. These consumers
want systems which are low power, capable of long talk time, and
provide privacy.
  
Now that Wireless Logic has distribution partners in place, this
month its fab partner Atmel started volume shipments of its system-
level solution for a 900MHz consumer cordless telephone. Such
consumer products should be hitting the store shelves by mid-year.
  
WLI's communications processor consists of WLI's S3P (spread
spectrum signal processor), a microcontroller, and RF transceiver,
which form the core analog and digital circuitry. While the system
architecture of the chip (designated WLT9010) and related RF module
are optimized for cordless phones, they're also capable of working
in secured voice link, wireless headset, and other low-speed
wireless data communications applications.
  
The WLT9010 S3P processor, which comes in a 64-pin PFQP package,
is priced at $16 in 10,000 quantities; while the RF transceiver
module (called the WLT9510) goes for $350 in single units. Both
products are available immediately. WLI also offers a evalua-
tion/development system (WLT9720) for a 900MHz cordless phone to
assist OEMs in product development; the system's single-unit price
is $5,000.
  
The WL9010 processor provides hundreds of communication channels,
four hours of continuous talk time, 7 days of standby time, auto
power control to manage low power consumption, 7 million security
codes, extended transmission distance with 50mW transmission power,
real privacy, and security.
  
Keeping the Team Lean & Mean

While John Lee, Wireless Logic's founder and currently serving as
its president/CEO, has strong technical credentials in wireless
communications (see biographical sketch below), he also embraces
the wisdom of gathering the best and brightest in the field, even
if they are consultants instead of full-time employees. Augmenting
WLI's engineering team, Lee relies on outside design wizards to
contribute specialized expertise in RF communications design,
telecommunications signal processing systems, and processor
software.
  
When visiting WLI, we found a very spartan digs. The front door was
hard to find because it was on the side of the building. No frills.
This is a lean and mean startup machine. 

John Lee, president and CEO. Lee is considered the `father' of the
DTAD (digital telephone answering device) industry from when he
headed the technology marketing effort at DSP Group.
  
With more than 20 years of senior technical and management
experience with National Semiconductor, Hewlett-Packard and
Siliconix, he has also held academic appointments with the
University of California at Berkeley.
  
Andy Varadi, executive VP. With 30-plus years experience, Varadi,
has most recently been an independent consultant for technical,
business and intellectual property management. For two years before
joining WLI, he was a founder and director of Sierra Wireless in
Canada, and for the previous ten years, was founder and VP of R&D
for Sierra Semiconductor. He holds five patents.
  
At National Semiconductor for 10-plus years, Varadi held successive
VP-level posts as GM for the Memory division, and later R&D. Before
National, he was director of VLSI development at General Datacom
Industries, and prior to that, was founder and VP of design for
Solid State Data Sciences.
  
James Wong, VP. Wong's extensive technical background in electronic
system design includes 20 years experience in designing hybrid ICs,
A/D converters, D/A converters, amplifiers, and switching
regulators.
  
Wong has held senior technical and management posts at National
Semiconductor and Texas Instruments. He was named an "Invited
Member of the Strategic Management Team" at a division of Analog
Devices.
  
Dan Babitch, VP of engineering. With 25-plus years of experience
designing military and commercial systems for communications and
navigation, Babitch joined Wireless Logic in 1994 as director of
engineering. He specializes in RF and microwave systems, including
global positioning systems (GPS) and satellite receivers.
  
Babitch was co-founder of Trimble Navigation, supplier of
commercial navigation systems and a prime GPS supplier to the U.S.
DoD. He has also held senior technologist posts with Hewlett-
Packard and California Microwave.
  
Neil Halldorson, CFO. With more than 20 years of financial
experience, Halldorson joined WLI early this year. Concurrently to
his CFO post at WLI, he also holds a corporate finance position
with Quest Capital Corp. in Vancouver, B.C., where he works closely
with companies seeking equity or debt financing, including publicly
listing of shares. and/or listing on stock exchanges.
  
Earlier, Halldorson held senior finance posts with the Vancouver
Stock Exchange, and before that, was MIS manager for the B.C. Ferry
Corporation.
  
Roy Essex, GM, Asia operations. Essex has more than 20 years
experience in domestic and international manufacturing, marketing,
system applications, and test development of electronic products
with National Semiconductor.
  
As a production control manager at National, Essex headed up wafer
fab, seals, test, turns, costing, and inventory of a $100 million
product line. His background includes long-term relationships with
OEM/ODM customers in the Asian market.
  
Wireless Logic's board of directors, described by CEO Lee as
"casual and loosely organized", is made up of Lee; executive VP
Andy Varadi; and Joseph Wau, an investor based in Hong Kong. There
is currently no one designated as chairman of the three-man board.
  
Assessing the Outlook

It was an easy decision. When formulating its initial strategy,
Wireless Logic had to choose whether to address the cellular phone
market or the cordless phone market. Cellular was out of the
question: It was much too expensive for a startup to take on, and
many of the competitors were industry giants.
  
So, instead WLI chose the cordless arena, in which the only truly
huge player is Rockwell. Ironically, Rockwell's large size could
also be its downfall because it tends to move slow and is said at
times to be "arrogant" with customers. A big plus for WLI: Its
extensive wireless credentials, such as founder John Lee's DTAD
knowledge and the invaluable hands-on work of executive VP Varadi,
who was a founder of Sierra Wireless in Canada.
  
If we characterize Wireless Logic as fabless, chipless, or even an
upscale design house, we would be right on all three assumptions.
But such labels are too narrowly defined. The key to WLI's model:
"outsourcing", a major business trend of the 1990s.
  
As an outsourcing model, WLI goes outside for foundry work,
engineering expertise, and value-added distribution. All of which
keeps it running lean and mean, and more importantly, controls
expenses.
  
Other examples of WLI's outsourcing: It has licensed Hexawave, a
semiconductor producer in Taiwan to make its RF transceiver; is
working with JABRA Corporation to provide the JABRA Ear PHONETM
Cellular as a private hands-free option for OEM cordless phone
design; and has developed with Hewlett-Packard a customized
standalone test system for WLI's RF module.
  
Clearly, the cordless phone market is a door opener for WLI to such
future telephone products as multi-handset systems and PABX for
business systems.
  
Eyeing Equity Deals

It's quite obvious to us that Neil Halldorson's connections to the
Vancouver Stock Exchange (see his career bio at the left) suggest
that WLI has its eye on a public offering on that Canadian
exchange, perhaps as a precursor for a larger offering on Wall
Street. We've heard that Montgomery Securities, the same investment
banker which assisted Sierra Semiconductor to go public, might
consider underwriting a future WLI equity deal.
  
Perhaps the smartest thing Wireless Logic has done so far was not
only enlisting the submicron CMOS fab skills and proven marketing
muscle of Atmel but also having that chipmaker become a WLI
investor. In high volume consumer markets, if you can't deliver,
you're history. --By Paul Plansky, SIBS Editor-in-Chief

Background and Overview

Germany's semiconductor manufacturing industry is overshadowed by
giant Siemens in Munich. Others, such as Temic (part of the
Daimler-Benz group), and smaller players, are in distant also-ran
positions.
  
In 1990, Hans Weinerth, a career technical veteran from Philips
Semiconductors (previously called VALVO), was able to convince the
German government to finance a new semiconductor venture in
Hannover. In April that year, SICAN GmbH was founded with backing
from the Federal German States of Lower Saxony and Hamburg in
conjunction with the Federal Ministry of Research and Technology.
The company's charter was to offer design and R&D services to
systems companies developing semiconductor applications and to
chipmakers.
  
The organization started with several employees and has grown to
over 200 involved with microelectronics design, basic research,
systems development, and related semiconductor support services.
  
This unique German semiconductor company is best described as a
vertically-integrated microelectronics design and licensing
company. Its charter includes development of ICs, modules, and
systems. Technologies include bipolar, CMOS, BiCMOS, and RF.
  
SICAN was founded to foster microelectronics in Germany by
providing a design and service infrastructure for small and mid-
size companies. Another aim: To provide design capacity to firms
whose resources were constrained. An overriding goal is to shorten
the critical time-to-market window to ensure its customers'
success.
  
Services and Technology

As a full-service design house, SICAN functions like other American
design houses offering IC development services. The company has
expertise in classical ASIC development using gate array and
standard cell architectures. Its ASIC development group, calling
itself the "design factory," is involved with a variety ASIC logic
design projects and acts as an authorized design center for several
world-class ASIC vendors, including LSI Logic and Fujitsu.
  
Within the ASIC development group, special expertise exists for ICs
used in ATM applications.
  
Besides its logic design capability, SICAN has a design group
focused on mixed-signal and analog applications. In its mixed-
signal group, the company has developed Sigma-Delta-Converter
technology with 18-bit resolution which is available for license.
The design team has know-how for implementing low voltage/low
power, high voltage, high frequency, and smart power designs.
  
SICAN has developed special core expertise in MPEG video and audio
encoding and decoding ICs.  Its MPEG hardwired solutions (versus
DSP-based) enables low-cost MPEG solutions for multimedia IC and
systems suppliers.  SICAN licenses its multimedia IC building
blocks to quickly customize projects tailored to specific customer
requirements.
  
The company has a flexible approach to development strategy. It
will do a turnkey IC design where all tasks from concept to final
tape-out are done by SICAN. It will also work on a modular sharing
of tasks basis where SICAN is responsible for well-defined tasks
that are part of the development project. One of the more
successful models is the joint-development team where the customer
and SICAN engineers form a joint team.
  
Management and Organization

The SICAN group consists of the SICAN holding company called SIBEG
with its subsidiaries SICAN, SIBET, and SIAG. SIBET is the R&D arm
of the group which does basic development on new technologies such
as neural networks and fuzzy logic and has close ties to German
universities and technical centers. SIAG is the company that owns
the buildings and equipment and leases it to the operating units
SICAN and SIBET.
  
The chairman and managing director of SICAN, SIBET, and SIAG is
Hans Weinerth. He has a doctorate degree from the Technical
University of Aachen and still has close teaching ties to his alma
mater. Weinerth started his career at Intermetall (Freiburg), and
in 1968, he began a career at Philips (Eindhoven). Later in 1976,
he moved to Philips VALVO (Hamburg). By 1990, when he left to start
SICAN, he had achieved the post of technical director of Philips
Components in Germany.
  
Heinz Stephanblome is the CEO of SICAN GmbH reporting to Weinerth.
He heads an organization that encompasses the various digital and
analog engineering groups, marketing/sales, operations, and
administrative functions. Prior to SICAN, Stephanblome worked at
Philips Components (Hamburg), engaged in strategic planning and IC
application activities.
  
Plants and Facilities

The SICAN group owns a 65,000 square-foot multi-building complex
at its campus on the outskirts of Hannover. An additional building
is under construction which will effectively double the facility
size.
  
The company through its lessor arm, SIAG, has acquired an
impressive suite of CAD hardware, software, and testing equipment.
  
The design infrastructure includes 134 Sun SPARC workstations and
77 H-P series 700 workstations. The workstations are divided into
clusters of five units in size connected together with an Ethernet
LAN. In addition, two Convex 3840s are used for R&D. A Cray 6448
supercomputer is used in development and R&D. Other support design
equipment includes five ZyCAD XP200 hardware accelerators, a
QuickTurn M250 emulator, a Logic Modeling LM1200 hardware modeler,
H-P 83000 tester, and other equipment.
  
Although SICAN does not operate a fab, it has close connections
with CMOS, BiCMOS, and bipolar fabs to fabricate its digital and
analog designs. These foundry relationships include LSI Logic
(USA), ES2 (France), Fujitsu (Japan), ABB-Hafo (Sweden), and AMS
(Austria).
  
Financial Summary

SICAN is a privately-held company started with government-backed
financing. Since its inception, SICAN has invited other American
and European partners to become strategic shareholders.
  
These include:

LSI Logic Europe GmbH
Cadence Design Systems GmbH
DVS GmbH (Digital Video Systems)
Sartorius GmbH
Convex
ZyCAD
Cray

In total, these industrial shareholders own 81% of the SICAN
shares. The balance of 19% is held by the Nord L/B (federal bank
in North Germany) as trustees for future shareholders.
  
The company's total sales for 1995 were $30 million, which includes
R&D programs as well as revenues from systems projects.
  
HTE Research Assessment

American and Asian firms can utilize the services of SICAN in
various ways.
  
SICAN's Hannover location in the center of Europe makes the company
a gateway to Europe for overseas companies. SICAN, for example, can
act as a German-European design center for American and Asian ASIC
companies. It can also assist overseas companies in navigating
through a myriad of European specs, rules, and regulations in the
telecom and other industries.
  
The second major function of the company is to do custom and
semicustom design for semiconductor companies which either do not
have the appropriate in-house expertise or just want to subcontract
design.  SICAN also offers this design service to OEM systems
houses and has the capability to broker production quantities with
qualified foundries.
  
Thirdly, its core technology licensing activities have already
attracted a following in the U.S. and Japan.  It has
licensing/development contracts with a number of U.S. and Far
Eastern customers. Announced customers include AMCC, Alcatel,
Cadence, Convex, Daimler-Benz, Ericsson, Exar, H-P, IBM, Siemens,
and Schlumberger.
  
The company has completed successful designs in DSPs, medical
systems, digital video editing systems, MPEG video and audio
decoders/encoders, and ATM projects, among others. 

SICAN has developed its U.S.A. activity base to the point where it
has decided to set up an Silicon Valley-based subsidiary called
SICAN Microelectronics Corp.
  
Located in So. San Francisco, the office opens at the beginning of
the second quarter 1996.  It will initially focus on market
development and applications/design-in activities with a heavy
concentration on mixed-signal and MPEG/multimedia development and
licensing programs.

Late News Breaks
Snubbing Oregon, Samsung
Picks Austin for $1.3B Fab;
National Buys SiTel Sierra

The guessing game is over. Samsung Electronics has chosen Austin,
TX over a site in Oregon to build its first U.S. semiconductor
production plant, in which the Korean chipmaker will invest $1.3
billion.
  
The fab plant, to be located in Travis County, is reportedly the
largest Korean investment in a U.S. manufacturing plant. (Another
Korean company, Hyundai Electronics, is still negotiating to build
a large chip plant in Eugene, OR.)

Samsung cited these criteria for selecting the Austin area: A
highly educated and experienced local workforce; IC manufacturing
infrastructure; and efficient operating costs. Samsung plans to
create about 1,000 jobs to staff the Austin operation.
  
Following groundbreaking during the current quarter, Samsung
expects to  complete construction by the second quarter of 1997,
and begin production during the fourth quarter of 1997.
  
Among mainstay products to be made at Austin will be 16M-bit and
64M-bit DRAMs. The new plant will employ .35-micron and 30-micron
technology with 8-inch wafers in a Class 1 cleanroom.
  
National Goes Shopping

National Semiconductor of Santa Clara, CA (NYSE: NSM) has acquired
SiTel Sierra b.v., in Hertogenbosch, the Netherlands, which designs
and supplies both components and subsystems for the wireless
market.
  
SiTel has also developed baseband solutions which couple well with
the RF receiver products offered by National Semiconductor.
The first line of DECT (Digital European Cordless Telecommunica-
tions) devices from National/SiTel have passed European standards

Taiwan's Wish List
R.O.C. Seeks Submicron Processes; BiCMOS; GaAs;
Low-Cost VLSI; Packaging

Like their Asian neighbors in Japan and Korea, the Republic of
China (R.O.C.) in Taiwan is willing to search worldwide to buy
advanced technologies from foreign firms for transfer to local
Taiwanese companies. Among semiconductor technology officially
being targeted by R.O.C.:

Submicron process techniques (from 0.5micron to 0.7micron) and
0.35micron module techniques;

Special manufacturing processes like BiCMOS, SCCD, and GaAs;

Circuit design capabilities for both analog and digital ICs, as
well as communications chips;

Wafer production skills involving single-crystal, multiple-crystal
growth, cutting and grinding technology; and

Such packaging techniques as SMT, TAB, COG, 3D, and MCM.
  
For its communications industry, Taiwan has identified these
critical needs: High-level transmission protocol; Code Division
Multiple Access (CDMA); Spread spectrum techniques; Image forming
and compressing; RF signal processing; Low-cost VLSI; and ASICs
with ISDN CPE standard interface.

Unfortunate Punch
Fortune Knocks Forbes
The Man and Magazine

We were surprised and appalled that Time, Inc.'s Fortune magazine
stooped so low. Fortune chose Republican Presidential candidate
Steve Forbes and Forbes magazine as the target for an mean-spirited
cover story, which we suspect will help the Forbes political forces
more than it will hurt them.
  
Fortune, in its February 5th cover story titled "What makes Steve
run?," admitted it's a "fierce competitor" of Forbes and then did
every thing it could to discredit the Forbes family and publishing
empire, raising questions about its tax write-offs and alleged
shady real estate deals.
  
Sure, Steve's fair game now that he's running for office, but we'd
say that Fortune's professional jealousy is showing like an old
wound. After all, Forbes has been winning the battle for business
press ad dollars for a long time.
  
Don't get us wrong. Fortune has its great moments. In fact, when
analyzing mega economic and social trends, it easily outclasses
Forbes. And how can you fault Fortune when they put Cypress' T.J.
Rodgers on the cover in a story on "America's Meanest Bosses" and
another cover on Intel's Andy Grove ("His Law: Only the paranoid
survive".)

But, back to the Forbes foray. Twisting its editorial knife deeper,
Fortune ran an editorial headlined, "FORTUNE ENDORSES FORBES". But
wait. At the end of this ruse, Fortune editor John Huey writes:
"Steve gives himself away when he admits to admiring only one
member" of Clinton's (team): The ambassador to France. "Now that's
a job fit for a Forbes. We hereby endorse him -- for the
ambassadorship, that is."

Really, Fortune should know better. What if it put its
investigative zeal and skepticism into uncovering the truth about
GM, Philip Morris, Exxon, or IBM instead of a magazine competitor.
Why, those folks might even win some journalism awards.

Alleged Tech Thief Could
Pay With 35 Years, $1.75M 

David Biehl, owner of Semiconductor Spares of San Carlos, CA has
been indicted on Federal charges for allegedly conspiring to obtain
technical drawings from insiders at Applied Materials, Lam
Research, and Varian Associates.
  
Biehl has been indicted on three counts of conspiracy and two
counts each of wire and mail fraud. Between 1992 and 1995, the
indictment says, Biehl's firm made more than $5 million from
selling spare parts designed with stolen drawings. If convicted,
Biehl faces a maximum of 35 years in prison and a $1.75 million
fine.

Legal Flash Points
Atmel Files Against SST;
SanDisk Takes on Samsung

Atmel has sued Silicon Storage Technology (SST) in Federal court,
claiming that SST's Flash memory ICs infringe five of Atmel's
patents and asks for compensatory damages plus triple damages for
what Atmel alleged was "willful infringement" of patents.
  
Separately, SanDisk filed a complaint with the International Trade
Commission (ITC), pleading that ITC stop importing into the U.S.
all NAND Flash storage products made by Samsung Electronics. The
action also asks the ITC to halt importing of all end-user products
containing Samsung NAND Flash chips.

Image Building
Atmel Takes Long-Term View  
Plants Redwood Tree at New French Fab

Chipmakers have chosen creative ways to paint positive images of
themselves that go far beyond peddling ICs. Cypress Semiconductor
is very big on local community relations, while Intel has often
taken the educational route by funding student scholarships.
  
But sometimes these PR efforts take bizarre twists. Take Altera,
which last year sponsored a racing car, then ran a color picture
of it in recruitment ads with the headline, "Breaking New
Barriers."                                                                                                                                Now
here comes Atmel. To symbolize a long-term commitment to its
presence in Southern France via the ES2 acquisition and ground
breaking for its Fab 7 plant there, the chipmaker has planted a
California Sequoia tree at the entrance to the Fab 7 site.
  
The fire-resistant species has a lifetime expectancy in excess of
2,000 years, thus symbolizing "the planting of deep roots of
Californian technology in French soil, and a long-term sustained
growth," says Atmel. Symbols are great, but all customers want to
know is: "How many weeks ARO until our parts arrive?"

AMD, Intel Bury Legal
Hatchet; Sign Patent
Cross-License Accord

Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and Intel have jointly announced that
they have signed a five-year, comprehensive patent cross-license
agreement.
  
The companies had agreed to negotiate the license as a result of
a litigation settlement announced in January 1995.
  
The new agreement follows a patent cross-license arrangement
between the companies that expired at the end of 1995. Effective
January 1, 1996, the new pact gives AMD and Intel the rights to use
each others' patents and certain copyrights, exclusive of
microprocessor copyrights.
  
AMD agreed in the January 1995 settlement agreement that it would
not use Intel microcode beyond the Intel 486TM processor code.
  
The cross-license is royalty-bearing for products that use certain
technologies, through specific financial terms were not disclosed.

Toshiba, Winbond Join
Up to Make Memories

Toshiba Corp. of Japan and Winbond Electronics of Taiwan have
jointly announced they have signed an agreement for the manafacture
and cooperative development of leading-edge semiconductor memory
products. This is the first strategic alliance for Toshiba with a
Taiwanese company in the semiconductor sector.
  
In the first initiative under the pact, Toshiba will provide
Winbond with production technologies for state-of-the-art 16-
megabit DRAMs and next-generation 1-megabit high-speed SRAMs. Winb-
ond will produce these devices in new 8-inch wafer fabrication
plant, which will start operations in late 1996.
  
The project allows Winbond to expand its current product line to
include leading-edge DRAMs and to enhance its current position in
high-speed SRAMs, the largest segments of the semiconductor market.
Toshiba will be able to share the qualified engineering and
production resources of Winbond, and increase its supply capability
of main products.
  
Toshiba will procure the output of the fabs from Winbond, and sell
them under Toshiba brandname, mainly in the Asian market.
Procurement volume will be discussed between the two companies.
  
Both companies also plan to cooperate on development of derivative
products based on the design of memory products transferred to
Winbond, and will seek various other opportunities to develop this
strategic relationship.

Conner Peripherals and
QLogic Redefining SCSI

Validating the performance advantages of Ultra SCSI technology,
QLogic Corp. and Conner Peripherals have disclosed successful
demonstrations that challenge the traditional notion of SCSI
connectivity.
  
Employing standard production products, the demonstration featured
a 40 megabyte per second data transfer rate using 16-bit wide Ultra
SCSI with 15 Conner (CFP2107W) 2 GB disk drives attached to
QLogic's QLA1040-PI host adapter across 14 meters of cable.
  
The demonstration shows the capability to extend operational limits
defined by the Fast 20 standard; currently set at eight devices on
1.5 meters of cable, or four devices on 3 meters.
  
The Ultra SCSI is a recently developed backward compatible
evolution of parallel SCSI that allows operation at 20 megabytes
per second on an 8-bit bus and 40 megabytes per second on a 16-bit
bus.

Atmel Begins to Build
$500M French Wafer Fab

Atmel of San Jose, CA has started building a $500 million IC wafer
fabrication facility (Fab 7) in Rousset, France, capable of making
5,000 eight-inch wafers per week.
  
To help fund construction of Rousset plant and buy equipment for
its eight-inch line, the company's Atmel ES2 subsidiary has
obtained about $65 million of 15-year financing and an option for
$80 million in credit from a group of French banks led by Credit
Lyonnais.
  
Located near its existing Atmel ES2 fab and design facility, the
new plant will includes a 60,000-sq.-ft. cleanroom and will be able
to make 0.35-micron wafers. The new French plant is expected to
come on line in Q3 this year.
  
At yearend 1995, Atmel had invested about $30 million to enlarge
and upgrade the original ES2 facility (Atmel Fab 6). Another $50
million is slated for the Fab 6 project this year.
  
When completed, the two Atmel ES2 fabs will almost double the
chipmaker's silicon output capability.

New Year Rocks With
Corporate Shakeups at
Micron, OPTi, and Weitek

The New Year has already started with bang, as three chip companies
made abrupt changes in top management. The companies involved were
Micron, OPTi, and Weitek.
  
Last Thursday, Micron Technology's top executive Steve Appleton
resigned. The new CEO and chairman will be Tyler Lowrey, presently
vice-chairman and chief technical officer.
  
In a brief company statement, Appleton was said to have resigned
from his posts of president, CEO, and chairman for "personal rea-
sons." Seems like deja vu for this Boise, ID-based company. In
September, 1994 Appleton's predecessor, Joseph Parkinson and two
other top execs departed from the company for "person reasons",
after a board room showdown with major stockholder J.R. Simplot. 

Micron's shares have plummeted in the last 52 weeks from a high of
94 3/4, closing Friday at 31 1/8. There has been some speculation
in the press that Simplot and Appleton had disagreed on whether to
caution Wall Street on the slowdown of the memory chip market. SIBS
sources indicated that Simplot forced Appleton to resign.
  
In other Micron moves, Ed Heitzeberg was elected senior VP of Boise
operations and COO; Bill Stover was named senior VP of fiance and
administration, and Bryan Farncy was promoted to senior VP of legal
affairs.
  
In a very ugly palace coup, Raj Jaswa was fired as president of
OPTi, Inc in Milpitas, CA. According to Jaswa, he had just returned
from a three-week vacation, when he was called in to a  "surprise"
board meeting and fired 10 minutes later. 

Jaswa, who claims to own 500,000 OPTi shares, is not giving up
without a fight. He is seeking shareholder support to oust the
board and its chairman, Jerry Chang. 

OPTi's stock has fallen from 29 a share to 6 3/8, closing Friday
at 8 3/8.
  
Officials at OPTi could not be reached for comment on Jaswa's
statements, but have already replaced him. The new president is
Stephen Dukker. 

Dukker has been an outside board member for OPTi since January,
1993. His executive experience includes president of Videologic and
a senior VP of CompUSA.
  
In another quick change at the top, Barry Cox has resigned as
president and CEO from Weitek, Corp. of Sunnyvale, CA.  While the
company conducts a search, his interim replacement, Dave Gellatly,
a Weitek director and former Intel executive, will serve as CEO.
  
Cox has reportedly left to "pursue other interests", and the
company would only say that his departure was amicable and a
"mutual decision". In Weitek's third quarter ending September 30,
the company incurred a loss of 1.1 million.

GateField Now Shipping
First FPGA to Beta Site

By Amy Whaley, Section Editor
People & Organizations

GateFieldTM, a division of Zycad Corp. in Fremont, CA has started
shipping its first GF51K FPGA part to a beta customer.
  
This 51,000-gate chip is said to be the highest density single FPGA
currently available in the market. Additional beta shipments of
this part will be made in the next few weeks, with production ship-
ments expected to begin later this quarter.
  
The GF51K is one member of Gatefield's GF100KTM family of high-
density silicon. These chips are combined with GateField software
tools, which are "synthesis friendly" and work with high-level,
top-down design methodologies to comprise the GateField Desktop
Foundry SystemTM, allowing ASIC designers to easily work within
their current design environments.
  
Formed in August 1993, GateField develops Flash-based FPGA
technology upon which its GF100K family of high-capacity FPGAs,
including the "first true" 100K gate FPGA, is built. Closely
coupled with the GF100K family is the Desktop Foundry, a set of
automated EDA tools optimized for top-down, HDL design and
methodology.

Crosspoint Readies,
Aims CrossFire FPGAs

Crosspoint Solutions of Milpitas, CA has disclosed an advanced new
architecture for very high gate count customer-programmable ASICs.
Crosspoint also provided a preview of a six-chip product family of
programmable gate arrays, with densities up to 100,000 gates, to
be released in 1996.
  
The "CrossFireTM" architecture is reportedly the first to combine
advanced ASIC design methodology with high-density, high-perfor-
mance customer-programmable ICs. These devices will be the "first
true" customer programmable gate arrays compatible with existing
ASIC design methodologies, gate densities, and performance levels.
  
The new CrossFire architecture employs a proprietary super-fine
grained half-gate basic building block called a CoreCell. Two
CoreCells can combine to form a 2-input NAND gate or a latch
storage cell. This approach has been optimized for mainstream ASIC
synthesis-based design methodology, efficiently implementing both
memory and logic.
  
The CrossFire product family will be implemented in 0.5-micron,
3/4-layer metal CMOS. Initially, it will consist of six devices
with gate counts from 20,000 to 100,000. The CrossFire technology
road map calls for eventual migration to a 0.25-micron technology
resulting in chips at 250K-and-above gate levels.
  
The CoreCell technology uses a sea-of-gates architecture and the
MicroFuseTM amorphous silicon antifuse technology. Individual
CoreCells are arranged in cell clusters called a "Tray." The Trays
are distributed over the die as a sea-of-gates, forming a "Sea-of-
TraysTM" array.
  
The CrossFire CP100K family will number six devices having density
ranges from 20,000 to 100,000 gates. The operating voltage for the

QuickLogic Touts `First'
FPGAs for Verilog, VHDL

Quicklogic Corp. of Santa Clara, CA has released the first FPGAs
optimized for Verilog and VHDL synthesis.
  
The seven-member pASIC 2 family ranges from 3,000 to 20,000 usable
gates with datapath speeds exceeding 200MHz, and counter speeds
above 150MHz. The firm's ViaLink technology provides an
interconnect between the top two layers of a new 3-layer metal CMOS
process. Moving the Vialink anitfuses over the transistor silicon
results in die sizes up to 50% smaller, lowering device costs.
  
The global connectivity of pASIC 2's logic cells combined with the
ViaLink's speed results in devices which can always route a design,
maintain pinouts to a circuit board layout, and provide fast,
stable timing. Thus, Verilog or VHDL designs are easy to
synthesize.
  
QuickWorks 6.0 will support pASIC 2 with Verilog, VHDL, schematic
and mixed-mode entry. Language templates, Verilog source-level
debug, timing/frequency driven placement, and interactive cross-
probing between design windows are part of a package which sells
for $2,995.
  
Prototypes of the 7,000 usable gate OL2007 device is available now;
production ia slated in the next few months. Devices from 3,000 to
20,000 usable gate devices are set for throughout 1996.
  
Beta versions of QuickWorks 6.0 are available now. QuickLogic
customers under software warranty or maintenance will be upgraded
at no charge. Sample quantities of the QL2007 start at $75.00;
production pricing starts at $45.00.

`Fastest' DRAM Slashes
Costs of Graphics Cards

By removing the cost barrier that previously prevented
manufacturers from exploiting the entire bandwidth of a graphics
accelerator's 1-Mbyte frame buffer, the industry's "fastest"
128Kx16 DRAM from Mosel Vitelic at San Jose, CA lets these
suppliers for the first time offer cards with 64-bit performance
in benchmarks at aggressive mass market prices.
  
Until the new DRAM, called V53C16129H (45nSec row address strobe,
RAS access time, 20nSec EDO cycle time, $8.00 in OEM volumes),
256Kx16 DRAMs were the only choice. Since four 256Kx16 DRAMs cost
anywhere from U.S. $52.00 to $56.00 (as of mid-December, 1995),
designers were forced to leave the bus empty to meet retail price
expectations.
  
Now, for $32.00 (U.S.), four V53C16129H DRAMs let graphics card
makers offer full 64-bit bus performance on graphics benchmarks at
mainstream prices. Since 256Kx16 and 128Kx16 EDO DRAMs have the
same pinout, and most current-generation 64-bit controllers are
designed for either choice, manufacturers can simply drop the
V53C16129H into existing sockets to achieve a competitive 1-MByte
benchmark advantage.
  
The new DRAMs also offer an economical design alternative to more
expensive SRAMs for network routers and switches. 

The DRAMs support set-top box, hard-disk, and low-cost, added-value
telephony applications. The only other 128Kx16 DRAMs appears to be
the 75% slower (70nSec RAS, 35nSec EDO) Sanyo LC322266 in Japan. 

Mosel Vitelic's 128Kx16 DRAMs are available with and without EDO
in 40-pin plastic SOJ packages. The V53C16129H costs $8.00
(Q10,000), U.S. pricing.

IR Says New HEXFETs
Set Performance Marks

The new fifth generation of HEXFET power MOSFET transistors
developed by International Rectifier of El Segundo, CA reportedly
achieves significant reductions in the critical on-resistance,
Rds(on), rating compared with similar chip sizes of existing
devices. Reductions of more than 65% are said to be attained for
N-channel and P-channel MOSFETs.
  
These HEXFET devices offer maximum Rds(on) ratings down to 6m ,
claimed to be the lowest presently available, establishing
performance benchmarks for power MOSFETs. 

Lower on-resistance is critical to users because it directly
supports more efficient device operation and lower system costs.
  
The new family of power MOSFETs ranges from 20V up to 150V. Based
on the fundamental HEXFET structure pioneered by IR, the
development employs advanced process techniques to increase cell
densities and reduce line geometries in attaining the Rds(on)
improvement over present products.
  
The initial 55V product, the N-channel IRF3205, is offered in the
popular TO-220 package with industry-pacing Rds(on) rating of
8mohms. It can replace up to three existing devices in parallel
configuration such as the IRFZ48 at 18mohms, and deliver the same
Rds(on) performance. 

Also available is the 30V series, featuring the IRL3803, with on-
resistance down to 6m , and 4.5V and 10V Vgs gate drive options.
  
All of IR's HEXFET generation devices are available for sampling.
Unit prices in 1,000 quantities of the IRF3205, IRL3803, and
IRF4905 are $4.32, $4.97, and $5.18, respectively.

Fast Harris IGBTs 
Win Voltage Competition

To help motor controller designers cut system size and weight
through use of smaller heat sinks, a new 600V, 12-A ultra-fast
switching (UFS) N-type, insulated-gate bipolar transistor (IGBT)
from Harris Semiconductor of Melbourne, FL provides 45% to 31%
lower saturation voltage losses (VCE(on)) than competitors.
  
The new IGBT, available as HGTP12N60C3 (TO-220AB package), HGTG12-
N60C3D -- with internal Hyperfast anti-parallel diode (TO-247),
HGT1S12N60C3 (TO-262AA), and HGT1S12N60C3S (TO-263 AB surface-mount
package), switches 12 A at 110 degrees C case temperature, which
is 10 degrees to 20 degrees C higher than competing IGBTs. The
IGBT's 2.2V max VCE(on) at a 150 degrees C junction temperature lets Harris
rate maximum continuous collector current at 110 degrees C.
  
Designers can cut system size and weight by employing smaller heat
sinks with 20% higher thermal resistance.
  
The 600-V, 12-A IGBT is ideal for high voltage switching
applications where low conduction losses are essential. Examples
include AC and DC motor controls in conveyors, machine tools, and
variable-speed drives. In motor control circuits, IGBTs control the
delivery of power to brushless-DC, switched reluctance and AC-
induction motors by varying frequency and/or voltage.
  
The Harris IGBT allows engineers to optimize designs by minimizing
conduction losses. For example, at 12A, 480V, and 10kHz switching
frequency with a 50% duty cycle, maximum conduction loss in the
HGTP12N60C3 is 13.2W, versus 19.2W for the IRGP30U, a 6W differ-
ence.
  
The HGTP12N60C3, HGTG12N60C3D, HGT1S12N60C3, and HGT1S12N60C3S
constitute the latest offering from Harris' third IGBT generation,
in which cell geometries have been optimized to extract maximum
performance. Future third-generation UFS offerings will switch from
55A to 80A at breakdowns of 600V and 1200V.
  
The HGTP12N60C3 (TO-220AB) is priced at $1.86. The HGT1212N60C3
(TO-262AA) is $2.20. The HGT1S12N60C3S (TO-263AB surface-mount
package) sells for $2.25. The HGTG12N60C3D -- with anti-parallel
diode (TO-247) goes for $3.56. All prices are Q1000. Delivery is
from stock.
