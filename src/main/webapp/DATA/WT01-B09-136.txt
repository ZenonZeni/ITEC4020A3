<blockquote>
<B>Project Title:  Fuel Cell Hybrid Electric Vehicle Project<p>
Performing Organization:  H Power Systems Corporation</B><p>


<P>Technical POC: Richard Johnson (916) 864­4980</P>

<P><B>Project Summary:</B></P><P>A compact, low cost, mass­producible design for proton
exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells is the focus of this project This advancement
is made possible through technology for thin metal fuel cell separators with
Integrated Fluid Management Technology (IFMT), the fluid equivalent of the
integrated circuit.</P>

<P>These separators combine the functions of thermal management, water
management, manifolding, and reactant distribution into a single leak­free structure
0.1 inch thick, resulting in stack power densities three times higher than conventional
graphite designs for a given MEA current density.</P>

<P>H Power has developed high-performance, repeatable MEAs optimized for ambient
pressure air operation using DuPont Nafion™ 115 and 105 membranes for
maximum fuel cell system efficiency. H Power's MEAs feature very low catalyst
loadings and are fabricated using technologies that are easily scaleable to low cost
mass production. </P>

<P>H Power is working with Hydrogen Burner Technology, Inc. (HBTI) to optimize HBTI's
patented underoxidized burner (UOB)™. The resulting reformer and associated fuel
processor components convert conventional hydrocarbon fuels such as gasoline,
diesel, and natural gas into hydrogen and CO-with only trace amounts of pollutants
(at least a factor of 10 reduction over combustion power sources). The use of a
logistically available liquid fuel such as diesel or gasoline allows widespread use of
fuel cell powered vehicles without the tremendous cost of a new fuel production,
storage and distribution infrastructure.</P>

<P>This project is a step toward medium and heavy duty hybrid electric vehicle systems which will be cost competitive with comparable diesel engine systems before 1999,
and offer equivalent power density shortly thereafter.</P>

<P><B>Project Deliverables: </B></P>

<P>This project will result in the development of a 10 kilowatt fuel cell system which will be integrated into a light duty composite chassis pickup truck for demonstrations. It will also result in the bench test of a compact reformer that can operate on either natural gas or liquid hydrocarbon fuels.</P>

<P><B>Project Schedule: </B></P>

<P>Fuel cell stack and reformer testing will be complete in mid­1996. The fuel cell
system will then be integrated into the test and demonstration vehicle by mid­1997.</P>
