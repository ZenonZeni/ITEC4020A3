<h1>Energy Efficiency</h1><p>
<p>
Energy efficiency is a measure of how much value we get from energy that
we consume; any increase in efficiency means a decrease in use and
consequently savings in cost, pollution, carbon emissions, and foreign
dependence.  Estimates of past and potential future energy and cost 
savings
resulting from increases in energy efficiency vary widely, but all 
suggest that
it is one of our most substantial "new energy" resources.<p>
<p>
<h2>Resource</h2>
One U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) study calculated that energy 
efficiency and
conservation activities from 1973 to 1986 reduced growth of U.S. energy 
use by
30%, saving $225 billion annually.<p>

DOE projects that energy efficiency measures will reduce energy use in 
2010 by
13%, but another DOE study estimated that use of existing cost-effective
technology for end-use energy efficiency could reduce energy use by an
additional 13%.<p>

Reductions in electricity use through efficiency measures save more than 
three
times as much primary energy because of the losses in conversion to
electricity.  Primary energy is energy in its naturally occurring form 
(e.g.,
coal or oil) before conversion to end-use forms.<p>

An Alliance to Save Energy study concluded that the United States could 
reduce
primary energy demand by at least 20% using only investment opportunities 
with
a payback of 5 years or less.<p>

An American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy study concluded that
vigorous adoption of cost-effective energy efficiency and renewable 
energy
measures could reduce national energy use in 2030 by 50% compared to
1988--saving $2.3 trillion and reducing carbon emissions by 70%.<p>
<p>
<h2>Advantages</h2>
Reducing energy demand by efficient use is often the cleanest, least 
expensive,
and most effective way to improve the adequacy of energy supply.<p>
Energy efficiency reduces air pollution and carbon dioxide emissions and
alleviates energy dependence and balance-of-payments problems.<p>
<p>
<h2>Current Use</h2>
The United States consumes 33 times as much energy per person as India,
13 times as much as China, two and a half times as much as Japan, and
two times as much as Sweden.  Only Canada and two small, oil-rich 
countries
use as much energy per capita.<p>
<p>
<h2>Projected Use</h2>
DOE projects a 25% increase in energy consumption by 2010, mostly from 
the
industrial and transportation sectors; commercial and residential energy 
growth
are expected to be relatively flat.<p>
<p>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
The economies of developing countries will be expanding rapidly in the 
future,
and world energy use could expand dramatically.  By developing energy
efficiency and renewable energy technologies now, the United States can 
lead by
example, reducing growth of energy use and carbon emissions while 
creating
major markets for the technologies.<p>
<p>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
Energy use is closely tied to economic activity.  But it does not have to 
be
that way--energy efficiency can hold down growth of energy use and 
contribute
to economic health.  From 1977 to 1987, energy use in the United States
actually decreased slightly while the gross national product increased 
27% in
real dollars.<p>

<h2>New Technologies</h2>
General Motors and Ford have built prototype five-passenger cars that get

90 miles per gallon (mpg); a forthcoming Mercedes will get 75 mpg of
diesel while meeting California low-emission vehicle standards; an Audi 
that is
currently available gets more than 60 mpg of gasoline.<p>

3M Corporation has reduced energy use per unit of production by more than 
50%
during the last 17 years.<p>

A Center for Applied Research study found that fully adopting 
cost-effective
efficiency improvements for commercial lighting, industrial motors, and
household appliances would reduce energy consumption by 38%.<p>
