<p>Many of our patients and readers are well-informed about the dangers

of "silver-amalgam" fillings.  These commonly-used fillings consist

of more than 51% mercury mixed with silver and some other metals.

The problem, of course, is mercury - a highly toxic heavy metal

with a powerful effect on the nervous system.  Once installed in

teeth, some of the mercury leaches out into the system and into

circulation.  Some people, admittedly, are a great deal more

sensitive to this circulating mercury than others.  Mercury has been

shown to even cause multiple sclerosis in some patients.  When the

"silver fillings" were removed, the patients recovered.  Other people

have silver fillings in their teeth for many years with no apparent

problems.



<p>What is less well-known is the condition that occurs when the root of

a tooth becomes abscessed.  In order to treat the infection, the

dentist first removes any loose or diseased material from the canal

that houses the nerve.  When the nerve is removed, the tooth dies.

Root Canal Cover-Up by Dr. George E. Meinig, D.D.S., F.A.C.D. in 1993

documents the extensive and detailed research done by Dr. Weston A.

Price, D.D.S., F.A.C.D., in the first few decades of this century.

Dr. Meinig founded, and for many years headed The Association of Root

Canal Specialists, a group of dentists engaged in performing root

canal procedures.  He admits to doing many hundreds himself.

However, when he discovered the research done by Dr.  Price detailing

the dangers inherent in this treatment, he resigned his position and

now spends his time and energies in making the public, as well as

professionals, aware of the research.



<p>Dr. Price's first indication of health problems due to root canals

came from a patient who was bedfast and virtually paralyzed by

rheumatoid arthritis.  For some reason, her root canal filled tooth

was removed, although it looked healthy and normal on X-rays. Within

a few weeks the patient was able to get up; after some months, she

was able to walk and her health was totally restored.  Intrigued, Dr.

Price took the extracted tooth, sterilized it thoroughly, and

implanted it under the skin of a rabbit.  Within five days, the

rabbit developed severe rheumatoid arthritis; in ten days it died of

the disease.



<p>Dr. Price subsequently repeated the experiment with many other

patients who had root canal filled teeth extracted, some suffering

from kidney disease, others from heart disease, and many more with

arthritis.  In virtually all cases, the patients showed considerable

improvement, and some even total recovery after the offending teeth

were removed.  Often, Dr. Price implanted the extracted and

sterilized teeth under the skin of rabbits.  In each case, a tooth

removed from the patient caused the patient's disease in the rabbit.

Dr. Price went even further to try to clear the apparently infectious

material from the extracted teeth: he autoclaved them (sterilized by

steam pressure, usually at 250 degrees F. or 121 degrees C.).

Sterilization made no difference: the rabbits with the sterilized

teeth implanted still developed the diseases and died, usually within

ten days.  As a control, Dr. Price implanted a healthy tooth under

the skin of a rabbit.  This rabbit lived without showing any signs of

disease for its normal life span of about 15 years.  



<p>The underlying problem is very interesting: when the nerve is removed

from a tooth, the tooth is dead, and is no longer supplied with

nutrients.  The normal structure of a tooth includes tiny "canules"

(similar to capillaries in all human tissue) that carry nutrients to

the living tooth.  The tooth's constant circulation is also

instrumental in clearing potentially infectious material from the

tooth.  Once the tooth is dead, however, nutrients stop circulating

through these canules, and the tooth loses its ability to clear

itself of infection.  Instead the canules become infested with germs

and viruses.  Additionally, the filling of the nerve canal shrinks a

little bit over time, allowing still more bacteria and viruses to

lodge in the gap between the filling and the tooth.  None of this is

visible on X-rays.  A dead tooth is thus a potent source of bacterial

and viral toxins and infections that can spread throughout the

system.  Inability of sterilization under extreme conditions to clear

the infectious material should prove that, no matter how good one's

dental hygiene is, it is simply impossible to remove the danger.  



<p>People with good immune systems and powerful defenses can often live

with this constant trouble source without developing symptoms.  Yet,

careful X-rays eventually show "cavitation" (hollowing out of the

surrounding jawbone) around the root canal treated teeth.  As the

hitherto resistant patient ages or is weakened by accidents, colds

and flus or severe stress, his ability to overcome this "focal

infection" is reduced.  The infection is then able to cause or

contribute to the development of severe chronic disease.



<p>In view of the above, it will not come as a surprise that we urgently

suggest that patients remove any teeth with root canal fillings.



<p>In the 1950's, German physician Dr. Josef Issels heard a lecture by

Dr. Gerson, and subsequently successfully used alternative treatments

in helping many cancer patients.  Dr. Issels himself spent some time

at the CHIPSA hospital, and, while there, pointed out the severe

damage caused by root canal fillings.  He said that he refused to

treat any cancer patient who did not allow all "devitalized" (dead)

teeth to be removed, as he found that he could not obtain good

results without this procedure.  



<p><center><b>Infected tonsils also cause problems</b></center>



<p>We had the pleasure of meeting Dr. Issels again recently, at a

convention in Orlando that we were both attending.  In the course of

our discussion, he returned to the question of "devitalized" teeth,

and described a simple, infrared machine that is capable of detecting

the infections.  He told us that the detector is also capable of

finding infected tonsils.  



<p>Dr. Issels estimated that approximately 90% of cancer patients have

undetected infections in their tonsils that cannot be found during

routine examinations.  He told us of the case of a patient whose

tonsils Issels insisted needed to be removed.  The surgeon was

doubtful about the necessity of the procedure, because he could not

find any reason for the tonsillectomy.  After the tonsil was out, the

surgeon wanted to prove to Issels that the removed tonsil was

perfectly sound, and cut into it.  He was shocked to have the pus

virtually squirt out into his face.



<p>Dr. Issels was making the following point: it is difficult to

determine that teeth and/or tonsils are infected and are

significantly contributing to the patient's illness.  Every effort

should be made to clear these foci of infection by removing root

canal filled teeth and damaged tonsils, to ensure the maximum chance

of recovery.



<p>Root Canal Cover-Up by Dr. George E. Meinig, D.D.S., F.A.C.D, $19.95,

plus $3.00 postage and handling, is available from the Gerson

Institute.  California residents, please add 7.5% sales tax.
