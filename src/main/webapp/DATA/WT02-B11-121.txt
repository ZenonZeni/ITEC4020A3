<i>&gt;  "If someone wanted to steal a credit card number, all they would</i><br>
<i>&gt;  have to do is go to any gas station and look on the ground around</i><br>
<i>&gt;  the pumps," says the CTO at Internet security firm Terisa Systems.</i><br>
<p>
Sure, if you wanted to steal a card number or two the ground around a  <br>
gas-station would probably be a good choice.  However, if you wanted to steal  <br>
a thousand card numbers (or maybe even thirty thousand), just sniff packets  <br>
off a hub near a large Web site that accepts unencrypted (or weakly  <br>
encrypted) card transactions or hack your favorite ISP's machines.<br>
<p>
It really bothers me that officers at companies writing net commerce software  <br>
are regularly quoted in the trade rags comparing the relatively little risk  <br>
of a single net card transaction vs. a transaction at a restaraunt or gas  <br>
station.  We aren't talking about a crooked clerk who handles at most a few  <br>
hundred cards per day or an unlocked dumpster with maybe the same number of  <br>
carbons in it.  We are talking about potentially hundreds of thousands of  <br>
card numbers whizzing through a single point that could be easily (and  <br>
undetectably) monitored and recorded with off-the-shelf-equipment for later  <br>
analysis.  Even if the transactions are encrypted, a single exploitable  <br>
weakness discovered after widespread deployment could compromise massive  <br>
numbers of cards.  The stakes are much higher and this will invite much more  <br>
sophisticated crooks to attempt to defraud the system.<br>
