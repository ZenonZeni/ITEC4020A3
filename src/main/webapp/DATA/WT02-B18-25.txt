<CENTER><H2> Using Economics to Save
Endangered Ecosystems </H2></CENTER>

<P><CENTER><H3>Conservation International Presentation
 Highlights Frederik Meijer Gardens Event</H3> </CENTER>     

<P>GRAND
RAPIDS, MI -- How can butterflies help save endangered rain forests?

<P>
Conservationist and scientist Roderic B. Mast, a native
of South Haven, Mich., will share experiences of a leading international
environmental group to answer that question in a talk at Frederik
Meijer Gardens March 15. 

<P>Mast is vice president of the
Andes Regional Program with Conservation International (CI), a
Washington, D.C.-based environmental group that works to protect
global biological diversity.  Mast's remarks will be part of a
special event marking the opening of the botanic gardens' &quot;Butterflies
are Free&quot; exhibit, which will run March 16 through March
31. 

<P>Just as economics drive much of the environmental
destruction the world faces today, economics must play a key role
in turning the tide,&quot; Mast says.  &quot;Butterflies happen
to offer one example of how this approach can work.&quot; 

<P>By
focusing on the world's biological diversity &quot;hotspots,&quot;
CI targets regions with the highest numbers of animals and plants
species that also face the greatest risk of habitat destruction.
 A field based group, CI has projects in more than 20 countries
on four continents. 

<P>Conservation International
integrates economics, science, policy work and community development
to build lasting solutions to the global ecological devastation
taking place today,&quot;  says Peter Seligmann, CI Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer, who also is attending the event.  &quot;With
tropical deforestation taking place at 40 million acres a year,
and species extinctions at an estimated rate of 27,000 per year,
the challenge is critically urgent.

<P>One example
of creating economic alternatives to rain forest destruction is
in Mexico's Chajul region, where CI helped start a 120 acre butterfly
reserve that today is run by the local community and provides
employment to some 35 people. 

<P>The project includes collection,
identification for research and sales to collectors in the United
States and Japan.  Artisans in the region also use the butterflies
in mobiles and glass containers for sale as souvenirs. 

<P>By
helping develop small enterprises that become self-sustaining,
CI gives local communities an incentive to protect the rain forest,
which might otherwise be sold off to loggers or cut down for temporary
farming plots or as fuel wood,&quot; Mast explains. 

<P>CI
has established several conservation enterprises linking rain
forest communities to international markets, including a Brazil
nut project in Peru, bioprospecting for potential medicinal sources
in Suriname, and the harvest of personal care product ingredients
from the rain forests of Guatemala. 

<P>CI's Tagua Initiative&Ocirc;
project in Ecuador markets buttons and jewelry made from the ivory-like
tagua nut in Ecuador's rich rain forests.  The project has generated
1,800 local jobs, including high-quality artisans who craft hand-carved
buttons and jewelry for export.  The project has provided income
for local transportation equipment and training for local people
in accounting and business management.  U.S. manufacturers that
purchase buttons through the initiative include the Gap, Esprit,
Timberland, and Smith and Hawken. 

<P>Grand Rapids attorney
Richard F. Vander Veen, III, of the firm Miller, Johnson, Snell
and Cummiskey, underscored the importance for the West Michigan
area to learn more about Conservation International's philosophy
and principles.   

<P>"West Michigan can greatly benefit
by embracing this philosophy of integrating science, economics,
policy and community development,&quot; Vander Veen said.  &quot;These
are essential elements toward achieving sustainable development,
and this is just as important to our local and the Great Lakes
economic growth concerns as it is for the conservation of international
ecological hotspots,&quot; Vander Veen said.   

<P>Mast will
speak at two presentations, one at 7:30 p.m. and the other at
8:30 p.m., during an event entitled, &quot;Where Have all the
Monarchs Gone,&quot; which previews the opening of the Tropical
Butterfly Release beginning March 16 at the botanic gardens. 
Other speakers will include Patricia Steijn Hopkinson, Chief Operating
Officer, Federik Meijer Gardens; Rick Sullivan, Executive Director,
Center for Environmental Studies; and Sr. Alvaro Umana, former
Secretary of Agriculture for Costa Rica. 

<P>The Federik
Meijer Gardens are located at 3411 Bradford Street, N.E.  For
