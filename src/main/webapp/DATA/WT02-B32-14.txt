<p>
This course is being offered for the first time in October 1997.
<p>
The MSc will provide advanced training in aspects of biotechnology particularly relevant to the changing food industry.  It will allow graduates to develop a specialised understanding of the way basic science and biochemical engineering are applied to novel food components and food processing systems. It is intended that the course will provide integrated training and advanced instruction in apsects of modern biotechnology relevant to the food sector from molecular biology through to process engineering.  The concerns of the consumer and environmental implications will be important elements in the course.  The aim will be to produce graduates with practical skills and a good basic grounding for employment in industrial research and development, and University sectors.
