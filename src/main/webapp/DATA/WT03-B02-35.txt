CZECH MATES?

HARD ON THE HEELS of complex changes in the ownership of major Czech
banks in November, one of the results of which was control of Kreditni
banka Plzen by Ceska pojistovna as, Prague (EEIR061/13), came some
major changes in the shareholdings of the Czech Republic's largest
insurer itself. Just before Christmas, it was revealed that PPF
Burzovni Spolecnost as (PPF Stock Exchange Co Ltd, PPF BS), a
subsidiary of Privni Privatizacni Fond as (PPF), had acquired an 11.72%
stake from Ceska sporitelna (EEIR062/14). Shortly thereafter, it also
agreed to purchase a further 7.69% from Interbanka, and PPF announced
that it intended to make further purchases in the market to bring its
stake up to 20%, the maximum permitted in a Czech financial institution
by a single investment fund or fund group.

The price was not disclosed, but banking sources estimated a price in
the region of Kc5,000 (US$192) per share, five times nominal value and
at a premium of just over 25% to the Kc3,990 quoted on the Prague stock
exchange on 15 December, the last trading day of the year. (CP shares
were at their 1995 high of Kc6,090 in January, with a low in April of
Kc3,660). Ceska sporitelna had sold its stake, it was speculated,
because of its need for funds to make an increase of Kc7bn in bad debt
provisions to a total of Kc23bn for 1995. It also sold shares in some
of its investment fund subsidiaries to Bankers Trust for Kc6.7bn.

PPF BS director Jaromir Proks stressed that the CP stake had been
bought for long-term investment purposes, and declined to comment when
asked if talks were under way with other CP shareholders. Some
observers retain suspicions that, as with the KBP/Agrobanka share
purchases, there is a "hidden hand" involved. Initial press speculation
that this was Allianz AG Holding, Munich, was quickly denied - and
indeed represented nothing more than the rounding up of the usual
suspects. The idea that the orchestrator is Ceskoslovenska obchodni
banka (CSOB) is perhaps more plausible (EEIR060/14, EEIR056/13). It has
a 14% stake currently, and may well be interested in increasing it.
CSOB's net profit for 1995 (on preliminary unaudited figures) was
Kc4.1bn, up 115% on 1994.

Transfer to PPF BS of the majority of the CP shares from Ceska
sporitelna, and those from Interbanka, was to be approved by the
control committee of the insurer (its supervisory board) on 11 January:
the 7.69% Interbanka stake, and the same proportion of the stake held
by Ceska sporitelna, are registered shares which can only change hands
with company approval. Control Committee chairman Pavel Kavanek (a
general manager of CSOB) had indicated in December that there were no
obstacles to the transfers, but in the event the committee declined to
approve it. Officially, a discussion took place between the 12 members
of the committee (of which seven represent shareholders) on whether to
retain the present diversified shareholding structure - which most
members probably support - or whether to allow a shareholder with
greater influence. After this, "the committee unanimously concluded
that it is first of all reasonable to reach a consensus of owners and
formalise it through an agreement."

In reality, it was later suggested, the implacable opposition of a
director representing a 10% shareholder had been at the root of the
committee's refusal. The two 10% shareholders are Komercni banka and
Investicni a postovni banka (IB), and the finger was pointed at the
latter as the one mainly opposing the entry of a large shareholder.
Other sources supposedly equally close to the negotiations suggested
that all the large bank shareholders were also opposed to it. (As it
happens, IPB was also the bank which was worsted in the Agrobanka
battle.)

Of CP's total shares, 73.08% are in the form of registered shares; of
the 36.92% freely tradeable bearer shares, 15% were held by the public
at the end of 1994. The largest single shareholder remains the National
Property Fund (26.27%), followed by CSOB (14%), Komercni banka and IPB
(10% each), Restitution Fund (3%) and employees (5%). National Property
Fund chairman Roman Ceska said on 16 January that it was not opposed to
the share transfers, but the decision was up to the other shareholders.

PPF Investicni Spolecnost responded by calling an EGM with the
intention of proposing board changes, executive director Ladislav
Bartonicek said in mid-January. Although its intended stake includes a
15.4% block of bearer shares, 4% of bearer shares acquired from Ceska
sporitelna and a proxy granted by Interbanka for its 7.69% in
registered shares gave it the 10% representation required to call an
AGM, the CP board said on 17 January. The EGM will also consider
changes to the company's articles of incorporation and executive
bodies. The supervisory board will hold an extraordinary meeting of its
own prior to the EGM, for which no date had been set as EEIR went to
press.

CP PROFITS RISE

According to unaudited preliminary results released this month, CP's
net profit in 1995 was Kc405.5m, up from Kc73m in 1994, and 45% up on
the original estimate for the year. The target for 1996 is Kc470m. Non-
life reserves increased from Kc10.6bn at the end of 1994 to Kc14.1bn at
the end of 1995, and life reserves from Kc48.3bn to Kc51.9bn.

CP INCREASES STAKE IN KREDITNI BANKA PLZEN

At the end of 1995, CP increased its stake in Kreditni banka Plzen
(EEIR062/14, 061/13) from 56% to 61.26% through a further issue of new
shares. With current paid up capital of Kc1.86bn (US$71.5m), Kreditni
banka is the sixth largest in the country.

CR: MTPL RATES

Thanks to the Czech reader who points out that the average increase in
1996 MTPL rates for cars in the Czech Republic is not 13% (EEIR062/12),
but 29% to 40%, while rates for motorcycles are 29% to 41% lower. The
13% figure (12.7%, in fact) represents the anticipated increase in MTPL
premium for Ceska pojistovna as, Prague, as monopoly carrier, which was
Kc3.6bn (US$132.5m) in 1994.

SR: MTPL TO BE FREED IN 1998?

In an article in the local press, Imrich Fekete of the Green Card
office of Slovenska poistovna as, Bratislava, said that he expected a
new system of compulsory motor TPL open to the whole insurance market
rather than operated as a monopoly by SP, to be introduced from 1
January 1998. The need for such a slow transition was partly due to the
social consequences of the change resulting from the expected sharp
increase in MTPL costs for private cars, but also because of a daunting
list of legal and infrastructure preconditions which had to be
completed first. Mr Fekete's list is worthy of study, especially in
countries of the FSU which are considering introduction of compulsory
MTPL from scratch in a short space of time.

1) New legislation on compulsory MTPL insurance which conforms with EU
guidelines.

2) Creation of a central register of all motor vehicles in cooperation
with the police authorities, including details of the insurance
carrier, and drawing up a sanctions scheme for uninsured vehicles.

3) Legal solution as on insuring vehicles for the preliminary period
between purchase of the vehicle and signing an insurance policy.

4) Categorisation of motor vehicles for rating purposes.

5) Issuing of a Finance Ministry order supplementary to the MTPL law
setting out insurance limits, the bonus-malus system, and indemnity in
case of loss caused by an unknown or uninsured vehicle, etc.

6) Issuing of a standard form of general insurance conditions for MTPL
insurance.

7) Signing of a framework agreement between MTPL and motor damage
insurers on apportioning losses.

8) Establishment of a Green Card Office of the Slovak Republic, a
Guarantee Fund, an Association of Frontier Insurers, and securing the
finance for these.

CR: NINE HEALTH FUNDS TO GO?

On 21 December, Parliament approved the 1996 financial plans of nine of
the country's 27 health insurance funds, in addition to the five
approved in November (EEIR062/13). The additional nine were Zeleznicni
ZP Gral, Garant Hospital, Vojenska ZP, Moravska ZP, Bankovni ZP,
Stavebni ZP, Revirni ZP, Crystal ZP, and REZAPO.

Four more - ZP Ministerstva Vnitra, Mendlova ZP, ZP Atlas and ZP Prima
- secured preliminary approval from the Health Ministry this month, but
after expected Finance Ministry approval will still need that of the
final Parliamentary hearing on the matter in February. Of those which
had still not secured approval, and are therefore expected to
disappear, Prima Plzen announced plans to merge with Crystal, subject
to Health Ministry approval, as are at least five of the others. Merger
will assist some of the approved but smaller funds to meet the minimum
requirement of 50,000 insureds.

CR: POOR RETURNS FOR PENSION FUNDS

According to Czech Statistics Office figures, in Q1-Q3 1995, the 40
active pension funds made a consolidated loss of Kc244m (US$9.4m), with
total costs and expenses of Kc3.2bn, premium income of Kc3.5bn and
other income for funds' own products and services Kc109m. Consolidated
equity capital (including operating results) totalled Kc3bn and pension
reserves Kc1.7bn. Membership totalled over 1m.

Average yields for 1995 year are expected to be between 5% and 10%,
barely above an inflation rate expected to turn out at 9.1%. According
to preliminary figures, the highest yields for insureds are expected to
be achieved by

* Penzijni Fond Multi (11%)
* Penzijni Fond Energie (10.6%)
* Podnikatelsky Penzijni Fond (Entrepreneurs PF) (minimum 10%)
* Penzijni Fond Ceske Pojistovny (Ceska pojistovna as, Prague) (10%)
* Vojensky Otevreny Penzijni Fond (Military Open PF)
  (minimum 8.5% to 8.7%) and
* Penzijni Fond Winterthur (8%).

Other funds are expected to provide much lower yields, including Zemsky
Penzijni Fond (Regional PF) (6%) and Penzijni Fond Thalie (5%), and
some such as Stavebni Penzijni Fond Ceske Republicky (Construction PF
of the CR) no yield at all, since they returned a financial loss for
the year. The largest fund in this position is expected to be
Sporitelni Penzijni Fond (Savings PF).

On 21 December, an "association agreement" was signed between Penzijni
Fond Energie, Penzijni Fond Koruna and Penzijni Fond Skoda. The three
are also interested in pursuing talks about co-operation or merger with
other funds.

BANK MERGERS

On 25 January, Czech National Bank deputy governor Pavel Kysilka said
that problems in the Czech banking sector affected some large banks as
well as smaller ones. In order to meet the requirements of future EU
membership, Czech banks "must undergo a process of more fusions and
megafusions, searching for foreign partners, raising basic capital and
being more specialized in their focus," he said. The future policy of
the Central Bank would take account of these necessities, he told a
seminar in Prague on preparations for EU membership.

Four banks have failed since 1989, and a rescue plan is currently
underway for Ekoagrobanka.

PLZENSKA BANKA SHARE OFFER

According to an opinion poll by the Institute for the Research of
Public Opinion, attempts by Plzenska banka to buy large quantities of
shares acquired by individuals during voucher privatization
(EEIR061/13) are unlikely to be very successful. It sent 5.5m letters
to shareholders. The poll found that 56% of respondents had little or
no interest in the offer, 25% some interest, and 7% very interested.

GRECO

A new entrant to the Czech intermediary market (as well as the 43rd
subsidiary of machinery and engineering company Skoda Plzen) is Skoda
Pojistovaci Management sro, Plzen, in which the local subsidiary of
GrECo International AG, Vienna, has a 26% stake. The new entity appears
to be the first German-style captive broker to be established in
central Europe, and will act as broker and risk management consultant
to the Skoda Plzen group, employees and associated companies, which
increasingly include activities unconnected with heavy engineering.

KOOPERATIVA

Dr Gunter Geyer, deputy general director of Wiener Stadtische
Allgemeine Versicherung, Vienna, and a board member of Kooperativa
druzstevna poistovna as, Bratislava, told the Austrian insurer's staff
magazine that Kooperativa Bratislava's premium income for 1995 would
reach approximately SK780m (US$28m), an increase of over 30% on 1994.

With reference to the 51/49 Kooperativa/Wiener Stadtische broking joint
venture InExCo, Bratislava (EEIR062/14), the same magazine noted that
it was intended to develop Kooperativa's industrial business, since
there remained a severe shortage of qualified brokers with experience
of risk management, risk analysis and loss protection in Slovakia.

HASICSKA (BRATISLAVA)

Hasicska poistovna as (Fire Brigade Insurance Co), Bratislava, has now
begun operating, with share capital of SK118m (US$3.9m), which was
expected to be raised by a further SK20m this month, and intended to
fund entry into life as well as non-life, ceo Peter Hargas said.
Shareholders include the municipalities of Bratislava and Kosice, and
the investment fund Karpaty. It has main offices in Bratislava, Kosice,
Banska Bystrica and Presov, and plans others in Nitra and Zilina.
Distribution will include sales through voluntary fire brigade members,
which are organised into 2,800 units throughout the country. Mr Hargas
is a former Bratislava brigade commander. He said the name had been
chosen partly to thwart efforts by the Czech Hasicska vzajemna
pojistovna as (Fire Brigade Mutual Insurance Co), Prague, to enter the
Slovak market.

VSZP

There was general chaos in late November and early January at the
Bratislava branch of state health insurer Vseobecna Zdravotna Poistovna
(VsZP) as clients waited in long queues to obtain new registration
cards. A number of private sector health insurers complained that
clients who decided as a result to change their health insurer were
hindered by bureaucratic obstacles erected by VsZP, a fairly common
sort of complaint (EEIR059/15).

The 1996 budget of VsZP anticipates income of SK26.25bn (US$870m) and
4.1m insureds, with monthly expenditure per insured of SK850.

COMPULSORY MTPL POSTPONED

The Latvian government has announced that the introduction of
compulsory motor TPL will be postponed until 1 July. The new
legislation is subject to a press campaign against its introduction, as
is also understood to be opposed by elements of the Finance Ministry of
the new government. A Latvian Motor Bureau has been established, headed
by representatives of Balta and BTA, both Riga.

In Lithuania, where new legislation is still being prepared, proposals
to introduce compulsory MTPL have also been put back. In Estonia, MTPL
losses ran at 120% to 130% for 1994-95, and rates have been increased
substantially this year.

The reinsurance of the Estonian Green Card Pool is probably the largest
reinsurance treaty from the region, led at Lloyd's with support from
Swiss Reinsurance Co, Zurich, Kolnische RuckversicherungsGes AG,
Cologne, and SOREMA, Paris.

The leading motor casco insurers in Latvia are Saules Laiks, Balta and
Pareks.

Motor theft in Estonia declined by 40% in the first six months of 1995
compared with the previous year.

ESTONIA: 1995 11 MONTH DATA

According to data from the Estonian insurance supervisor, non-life
premium for the first 11 months of 1995 totalled EK449.123m (US$38m),
and claims EK214.295 (47.7%). Motor TPL represented EK218.560m, 48.7%
of total premium, and MTPL claims EK129.367m, 59.2% of premium and
60.4% of total claims.

For the first ten months of 1995, for which life premium totalled
EK34.5m and non-life EK401.9m, RAS Eesti Kindlustus, Tallinn, had
premium of EK109.7m (a market share of about a quarter) and claims of
EK60.1m (54.8% of premium). ASA Kindlustus, Tallinn, was second
largest, with premium of EK82.7m (market share of 18% to 19%) and
claims of EK52.6m (63.6% of premium). ASA was partly responsible for
the scrutiny of all reinsurance contracts by the insurance superior,
following its inability to collect on a reinsurance placed with a
Florida-based company identified to EEIR as Olympia. This matter was
settled in ASA's favour by the arbitration court in Estonia, which is a
signatory to international arbitration conventions.

Commercial property market leader BK Baltic Insurance Co (BICO),
Tallinn, had premium of EK29.6m (market share of about 7%), with claims
of EK6.9m (23.3% of premium). Insurance supervisor Ellen Ridaste
estimated that non-life premium for 1995 would reach EK500m, increasing
to EK650m to EK700m in 1996.

FORTUNA

Dripdev reported just before Christmas that Fortuna Lebensversicherung
Ges, Adliswil, had acknowledged having made "regrettable mistakes" by
permitting the sale of insurance policies on an unlicensed basis in
Estonia through the Riga arm of pyramid sales intermediary Safe-Invest
(EEIR062/2, and passim). Dripdev said that the company had agreed to
cease any sales in Estonia, and make refunds on all contracts taken out
before 31 October 1995 according to Swiss law. Given the relatively
short time which the policies are likely to have been in force, the
refunds on a typical Safe-Invest-sold 10 or 15 year policy are likely
to be very small, or non-existent.

Sofia, with 24.5% each, and the other members are the insurers Atlas,
Evropa, Evropeiska Zastrachovatelna Atsotsiatsiya (EZA), Granit,
Turgovsko Zastrachovanie, Vi-Vesta, Bulgarski Imoti, &M, Hemus, Trakia
and Bul Ins. Each company will be permitted to lead a given risk, with

OREL/BALKAN

At a general meeting on 2 January, the shareholders of ZPK Orel AD,
Sofia, and SZPK Balkan AD, Sofia, a specialist insurer associated with
the Orel group, approved a merger between the two, and specialist
health insurer ZOZAD Zakrila, Sofia, approved merger with Orel life
affiliate ZPK Fenix AD, Sofia, which will vote on the proposal in
February.

The mergers are partly with the requirements of the Insurance Bill
currently being debated in Parliament in mind. This proposes an
increase in the minimum capital for insurers to Leva200m (US$2.75m) (a
figure of Leva100m is also being discussed), as well as increasing
credibility abroad: Orel, which is currently capitalised at Leva100m,
is said to be keen to secure the support of Swiss Reinsurance Co,
Zurich. Balkan began operations in 1994 with the minimum legally
required capital of Leva10m, with Orel G Holding AD, Sofia, as the
leading shareholder with 40%, along with TSBank (10%), Angel (11%), the
Sinit motor trading company, Postal Bank (2%) and some individual
investors. It was mainly aiming at the financial insurance market
(EEIR049/10), but by last Spring it had become clear that this market
was weak, and slow-growing. Nor could the shareholders reach agreement
on a development strategy, and some withdrew.

Zakrila was set up in 1993 with capital of Leva10m (EEIR026/6) by Orel
G, Sirbank, Feniks (which currently has registered capital of Leva50m)
and the Confederation of Independent Trade Unions, and planned to offer
group medical insurance. This market did not develop as hoped either,
partly because of an absence of a legislative structure.

Other similar mergers are expected to accelerate, as the "back-kitchen"
insurers unable to raise minimum capital 20 times the current level are
faced with liquidation, sale or transformation into an agency of a
larger company.

DZI

Darshaven Zastrachovatelen Institut (DZI), Sofia, has announced its
1996 interest rates for life policies, which will be 34% for five year
policies (currently about 40% of the portfolio), 38% for six to 10 year
policies (about 30% of the portfolio) and 44% for policies over 10
years (also about 30% of the portfolio). Deputy chairman Valery Alexiev
said that such inflation-proofing could be offered because 75% to 80%
of reserves were invested in government securities. Mr Alexiev added
that the fastest-growing product is family and children's policies,
typically for terms of 14 to 18 years. In 1995 400,000 new customers
bought policies, yielding premium of Leva4.1bn (US$56m), Mr Alexiev
said. Life insurance had contributed a further Leva200m. 1995 premium
for both life and non-life is estimated to have reached Leva5bn.

DZI, as a major shareholder in Razvitie Investment Fund, announced this
month that it will set up a fund to participate in this year's voucher
privatisation programme. Other shareholders, including the State
Savings Bank, United Bulgarian Bank and the Intransmash engineering
company, are also expected to participate. Privatization funds must
have registered capital of at least Leva70m, at least Leva10m of the
total in cash. The remainder may be made up with vouchers, which have a
nominal value Leva25,000.

RUSSIA: AMENDMENTS VETOED AGAIN

On 3 January President Boris Yeltsin vetoed the bill amending the law
On insurance for the second time, a spokesman for the presidential
press service announced. In a letter to the Duma, President Yeltsin
said that it had ignored his criticisms of the bill made in October
(EEIR061/6). He again rejected the proposed restrictions on the
corporate form of insurers on the grounds that it is inconsistent with
"the equality of participants in civil legal relations" laid down in
the Civil Code (and originally intended, no doubt, to prevent the
private sector being discriminated against to the benefit of the state
sector. It is a fundamental principle of Russian jurisprudence, on a
Napoleonic as much as a Soviet basis, that subordinate legislation
cannot amend primary legislation. Thus broadly speaking the
Constitution takes precedence, followed by international treaties,
Codes, laws, decrees and normative acts.) Nor has the President
relented in his opposition to a compulsory separation of life and non-
life insurance, which he said "disregards the condition of the Russian
insurance market" - the "special circumstances" argument familiar to
anyone who has discussed economics with a group of Russians - and will
not enable the insurers to improve their financial position, but on the
contrary, "will split numerous insurance companies and, in the last
analysis, reduce the insurance market." President Yeltsin also objected
to the restriction of reinsurance to classes for which insurers have a
primary licence, which he said "contravened the general principles of
reinsurance". He made "numerous" other additions and amendments, the
spokesman said, which were no doubt equally insightful.

RUSSIA: FOREX POLICIES PERMITTED

From 1 February, Russian insurers will be more or less free to engage
in insurance in foreign currency both inside and outside the country,
when new procedures issued by the Central Bank come into force. The new
measures, for which insurers have been waiting for close on three
years, were announced by the Bank's head of foreign currency regulation
and control, Viktor Melnikov, in mid-December.

Insurers will be able to insure and reinsure with foreign parties free
of Central Bank restriction, and settlement in foreign currency between
insurers and resident insureds is permitted for a wide range of listed
categories of insurance. Potentially the most far-reaching change is
permission for insurers to settle claims in hard currency with resident
individual insureds for life, health, accident and voluntary medical
insurance.

For most of the other approved settlement categories, there is an
obvious foreign currency risk element. For individual resident
insureds, these categories are the luggage of individuals leaving the
RF, TPL for private vehicles going abroad, and defined real estate
outside the country.

For settlements between insurers and insured legal entities, the list
of permitted settlement categories is

* goods being imported into or exported from Russian customs territory
(the distinction may be important in view of the customs unions with
Belarus and Kazakhstan);

* ground vehicles, aircraft and river and sea vessels moved through the
customs territory of the RF and used in international transportation;

* liability to non-residents by owners of vehicles used in
international transportation;

* accidents to resident individuals leaving the country on business;

* CAR/EAR abroad;

* liability for export loans;

* transportation and storage of foreign currency, in cash or
securities;

* foreign-manufactured vehicles and equipment owned by resident
organisations and purchased for foreign currency.

At one time, insurers were permitted not only to insure foreign
equipment in hard currency, but also the loss of production from the
equipment. This appears to have been one of those areas which
subsequently became technically a breach of Central Bank instructions,
but remains unclear under the new regulations.

Mr Melnikov said the regulations had been amended partly to reflect
market developments and the introduction of new classes of business.
Some transactions had not previously been officially sanctioned, and
insurers engaged in them were technically in breach of regulations, he
said. Secondly, foreign companies had, he claimed, secured a large
share of the market, and the new rules, by putting foreign and domestic
insurers on the same footing, would help to reduce the outflow of
foreign currency.

BELARUS: PROPOSED LEGISLATION

The first meeting of the Insurance Council of the Cabinet of Ministers
of Belarus (EEIR062/5) discussed four draft government resolutions, On
Insurance Brokers, On the Investment Activities of Insurance Companies,
On Compulsory Insurance of Passengers and On Compulsory Insurance of
the Staff of the Taxation Service.

The latter two measures are both intended to apply on a temporary
basis. The Council recommended the adoption of the law on passenger
insurance, which was issued as a government resolution in mid-January.
Cover against accidental death is made mandatory for all forms of
public transport, whether state- or privately-owned introducing
mandatory, and covers all passengers in possession of a ticket from
arrival at the point of departure. The sum insured is 100 minimum
wages, or BR6m (US$520), with the premium set at 2% of the ticket price
and included in the ticket cost. The scheme will be administered by
Belgosstrakh SKARB, Minsk, but will be superceded at some point in the
future by new comprehensive legislation On Transporter's Liability.

The proposal on compulsory [life] insurance for taxation service
personnel stands in the same relationship to planned legislation On
Compulsory Insurance of Civil Servants, which will replace the
collection of measures left over from Soviet times or implemented
since, whether still put into practice or not.

A Cabinet resolution has also, as expected (EEIR062/5), instructed the
Ministries of Finance, Economy and State Property to draw up plans for
a "national system of reinsurance" in the form of a Belarussian
National Reinsurance Society (BNRS) as an open joint stock company with
minimum statutory fund of US$6m, and a state shareholding of at least
30%. Its activities will be supervised by Belgosstrakhnadsor, and
participation is planned to be open to foreign reinsurance companies.

The Council also discussed the funding of a training centre for
insurance. At the meeting of the German-Belarussian Insurance Working
Group in Berlin in November (EEIR062/5), the German government agreed
in principle to provide DM3.5m (US$2.4m) in funding, provided the
Belarus government considered it an immediate priority, Belarus Market
reported last month.

Currently, some insurance training is provided by the Minsk Academy of
Management, founded in 1991. Its two year course includes market
economics, management, the theory and classification of risks,
commercial insurance, reinsurance, the international insurance market,
regulation, and insurance company management, Vice Rector Alexander
Golovachkov told the local Insurance News. It works closely with
Belgosstrakhnadsor, which assists in course organisation and assessment
of diplomas, he added. The Academy plans in future to provide
specialist insurance education for professional in other fields, for
example so that doctors will be able to acquire expertise in medical
insurance.

BELARUS: 10 INSURERS SUSPENDED

In late 1995, there were 82 insurers operating in Belarus, according to
Belgosstrakhnadzor. Fifteen went bankrupt in 1994, and about the same
number were not expected to survive 1995. Belgosstrakhnadsor sent
letters to the owners of ten insurers ordering them to cease activity,
return their registrations and set up liquidation committees, on the
grounds of financial instability, assets below the legal minimum of
5,000 minimum salaries (BR300m, US$26,000), etc. The ten were Belavers,
Belvarta, Belvest-Grodno, Kredo, Lidors, Olimpium, Polar, Rabel, Raise

KAZAKHSTAN: NEW LAW "IRREVERSIBLE"

In an interview with Kazakhstanskaya Pravda this month, newly-appointed
chairman of Kazakhstan Gosstrakhnadzor, Oskar Ler, described the new
insurance law (EEIR060/1) as "a serious step forward" which
demonopolised the insurance industry and created the conditions for
free competition both for state and private sector and insurers. It had
been positively received by foreign companies and investors, and now
the domestic market was open to foreign insurers, they were considering
how to invest, he said.

The cynical interviewer asked whether the law would change anything, as
"It is well known that with normative acts any pro-market law can be
turned into its opposite." "That cannot be," Mr Ler replied. "Our
market needs to be integrated with the CIS economies, and enter into
the world market," he added, and the needed foreign investment would
not be forthcoming without a positive business climate, including a
fully-formed system of insurance and reinsurance. The law would
stimulate the formation of financially stable insurance reserves
companies backed by major financial and industrial groups and those
insurers which had already acquired sufficient capital, expertise and
assets. Gosstrakhnadzor would supervise, development policy and assist
with training. A seminar on insurance accounting was held in December,
and an international seminar on reinsurance was due to take place in
January.

Among Gosstraknadzor's proposals were the transfer of the guaranteeing
of financial risks from government to the insurance market. A truly
competitive environment lay in combining state and private sector,
compulsory and voluntary insurances, he said.

Insurance joint ventures and a system of reinsurance with foreign
reinsurers would enable the possibilities of the Kazakh market to cover
major risks to be utilised to the full, Mr Ler said. It was imperative
to use international professional experience to develop the market.
Local insurers would find it useful to work alongside the world's
leading insurers, consultants, brokers, and other professionals. The
entry of foreign insurers and reinsurers would, however, be conditional
on guarantees of solvency and financial stability, and before seeking
reinsurance abroad, the Kazakh market would have to be exploited to the
full through coinsurance and "other groupings of insurers".

A priority for the future was the development of long-term life and
pensions insurances, as well as compulsory motor TPL in line with
international practice, for both privately and commercially owned
vehicles. Development of compulsory medical insurance was the
responsibility of the state social insurance system, but voluntary
medical insurance would be an important complement to it, and "much
could be done" by co-operation between medical and insurance
professionals, he said. In the context of the new law the state
insurance company would also have to be reorganised to maximise the use
of professionalism and assets.

Mr Ler said that he saw the Union of Insurers of Kazakhstan as an ally,
not an opponent, since they shared mutual interests. A period of three
to five years would be needed for the formation of stable, solvent
insurers, and much depended on the progress of privatization, the
banking sector, and other factors, Mr Ler said. "We will have a
civilised insurance market, however, because there is a legal basis for
it, and a recognition of its importance. There is a great desire in the
government of Kazakhstan that we should have a normal insurance
market," he concluded.

BELINGOSSTRAKH

In the November issue of Belarussian Entrepreneur, Yuri Gavrilov,
director general of Belingosstrakh, Minsk, outlined some of the
operations of the company. It writes 19 voluntary classes, of which the
most widely distributed are motor TPL, health, motor casco, and
property insurance. Major domestic clients include Belvest, BelavtoMAZ
[motor manufacturer], Belmagistralautotrans [freight], tourist
companies and foreign embassies and trade representations. Annual
claims payments total in the region of US$400,000, but reserves are
close to $4m. Belingosstrakh also accepts domestic reinsurance.

Travel health is written both individually and on a group basis. A Blue
Card for motor liability in eastern Europe costs US$20 per month,
extendible for $10. It issues policies in its own name rather than
those of foreign insurers, as in addition to its nine offices within
the country it is the only Belarus insurer with a representative office
abroad [in Vienna, in association with MACH.) For motor, it has co-
operation or average commission agreements with Moldova, the Baltic
States, Ukraine, Russia, Poland, Spain, Germany, Austria, Romania,
Hungary and Bulgaria, Mr Gavrilov said. The third meeting of the
participants in the Baltic Insurance Pool, the co-operative
organisation for insurers from Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia and Belarus
in Minsk last autumn agreed to include SAO Ingosstrakh, Moscow, as a
member, Mr Gavrilov said.

vice-president the following year, and remained until very recently as
number two. A&A sources confirmed to EEIR that Mr Rizvanbegovic was a
prodigious producer of business for its New York branch office, with
excellent contacts among the Wall Street investment community.

Two factors influenced his decision to take up his new post, he told
the newspaper: the desire to return home, and his friendship with
Croatian President Franjo Tudjman. "Being an insurance expert, it was
only natural for me to come to the head of the biggest insurance
company in Croatia which covers 86% of the insurance market. Now that I
am in, I shall try to introduce the American system of doing business
in the Croatian economy," he said.

Asked whether Croatia IC should be privatised, however, his answer was
categoric. "No, it should not," he said. "I think it must remain a
state owned company. Privatisation is OK, but Croatia [Osiguranje] has
brilliant potential, so let the Croatian state get the benefit," he
added. Mass privatization throughout most of the rest of the economy
"only means that Croatia [Osiguranje] will have to be competitive. The
only strong suit it possesses and the basis on which it rests are
numerous branch offices and the strong net capital. A private owner [of
an enterprise] will have several opportunities - either to insure with
a small private company having small net capital, or to turn to a
large, strong company which will be able to cover each of his losses,
and reduce the risk of possible failure to be reimbursed. Here we shall
certainly have an advantage," Mr Rizvanbegovic continued.

Mr Rizvanbegovic said that he had already held discussions with members
of the Croatia IC supervisory board and made contact with members of
the government to inform them of his plans for the company. "I want to
revitalise Croatia [Osiguranje] and bring in young and capable people,"
he said. He also plans development of life insurance, which was what,
he said, interested him most. He was aware of specific problems in the
life sector - the "unsettled" position of Austrian insurances, for
example.

The interviewer suggested that collecting premium was not the only
problem. Local insurers suggested that government tax policy also
restricted development of the life market. "Taxes must be paid," Mr
Rizvanbegovic observed, and were paid on life and pensions insurance in
the US as well. "The essential thing is in which phase an insurance is
taxed, how it is treated," he said, adding that he was sure "this is
going to be settled in Croatia in the most satisfying way."

He was confident of the support of the Finance Ministry, he said, and
"Not only that, I am sure we shall have excellent co-operation with
both the Ministry of Finance and the government, as well as with the
rest of institutions." Mr Rizvanbegovic also made it clear that he
intended to recruit expertise from Croatians [and perhaps others] from
abroad. He already had an excellent offer on his desk from a young US
woman who was offering her knowledge to Croatia IC. She was not the
only person ready to come and help introduce new business criteria in
Croatia, and he intended to make use of such readiness, he said. A free
hand in hiring staff was one of the conditions he had made before
taking up his new post, he said, and he was counting upon "absolute
support" from government and ministries in all the developments he
planned.

The re-emerging insurance industry in Bosnia & Herzegovina - Bosnia
Reosiguranje dd, Sarajevo, announced that it would restart business
with the New Year - may also be interested in Mr Rizvanbegovic's
appointment. They will hope that the fact that he is by descent a
Muslim as well as a Croat will make the development of Croatian-B&H
Federation links in the insurance sector considerably easier to
facilitate.

MERGER OF SUPERVISORS PLANNED

In mid-January, a government spokesman announced that during cabinet
discussion of draft credit institutions and securities legislation, the
government had accepted in principle that the banking, securities and
insurance supervisory offices should merge, possibly as early as 1
January next year, to form a new body subordinate to the government
rather than to the Finance Ministry.  As a result, sections dealing
with supervision in draft banking legislation due to be discussed by
parliament shortly will be removed, and the operation of the new
unified supervision be dealt with in separate measures yet to be
drafted, president of the Banking Supervisory Commission Tamas Rusznak
said.

The government spokesman said that a draft of the unified supervisory
legislation would be considered by cabinet before the end of February,
and that capital and reserve requirements for financial institutions
would be amended. Other draft measures include licensing of banks for
trading in government securities, new licensing procedures for credit
institutions, and abolition of the requirement for foreign investors to
obtain government authorisation for stakes in credit institutions.

NEW VMBF LAW

In order to stimulate the development of voluntary mutual benefit funds
(VMBFs), a new law is under preparation, according to Dr Tibor
Parnitzky, deputy chairman of the supervisory body overseeing their
licensing. The changes come two years after the original legislation
came into force in November 1993, as - various optimistic announcements
notwithstanding - the growth of the movement has proved to be
disappointing (EEIR060/19), and coincide with the appointment of a new
president for the supervisory office, Dr Gyorgy Radnai.

By the end of 1995, the total number of funds was 197 (151 with
operating licences), of which 177 were pension funds, 14 mutual
assistance funds and only six health funds. The vast majority are
organised on a regional basis, 42 around individual enterprises, 14 by
economic sector and four by profession. At the end of October, total
membership was 114,610, with the end of year average likely to have
been at most 650 members per fund. Furthermore, despite the generous
tax concessions supporting VMBF contribution levels (by members and
sponsoring employers or other organisations), payments were well below
expectations. Accumulated funds of HUF5.5bn to HUF6bn (US$40m to $44m)
at the end of 1995 would have represented an average per fund of HUF28m
to HUF30.5m, or just over $200,000 each.

Dr Parnitzky told EEIR that the main aims of the proposed legislation
are to speed up the authorisation of new funds, reduce bureaucratic
burdens on their operation, tighten supervision of existing funds and
remove the contradictions between various sections of the current law.
One amendment will lift the restriction on formation of funds to a
common interest basis of workplace, profession or sector, enabling
general funds to be set up, and existing localised funds to merge.

The operation of health funds will be eased by clarifying their
relationship to the universal state health insurance system, which is
also under review. The supervisory body is also expected to take a more
pro-active educational and information role in promoting the VMBF
movement. Currently, much is done by financial institutions to spread
the concept, although in some cases the expansion is based on the
exploitation of an existing loophole which enables the largely tax-free
refund of contributions, within a short period for those who are
already past retirement age. At present pension fund members who retire
can receive their payments back while benefiting from tax allowances.
The new legislation will restrict lump sum or regular pension payments
to those who have been in the fund for two years, while permitting
those who retire to remain in membership.

It is hoped that new legislation will come before parliament during the
Spring and into force by the middle of the year. A second phase of
amendments is expected by the end of 1996 regarding VMBF fund
management activities.

The eventual rejection of a proposal contained in late drafts of the
recently passed new insurance law to bring the supervision of VMBFs
under the same office as that of insurance companies (EEIR059/20), is
regarded as a significant support for the independent development of
the movement. While insurance companies can perform services (such as
data processing, fund management, premium collection etc.) for VMBFs,
these must be performed by a separate subsidiary, such as that of AB-
Aegon tltalanos Biztosito Rt, Budapest (EEIR062/16), Aegon Nyugdijalap
Kezelo es Szolgaltato Kft (pension fund management and service co),
which will charge a fee of 5% to 15% fee, depending on the size of the
fund. Over 50 banks and consulting firms, including Budapest Bank,
Creditanstalt, ING Bank, Hungarian Foreign Trade Bank, Sedgwick Noble
Lowndes and William Mercer, offering similar services.

MTPL RATES

On 27 December, the government determined rates for motor TPL for 1996
were published in the Official Gazette. The basic rates for passenger
cars are modified by four bonus and four malus categories, each
representing 5% of the base premium.

MTPL insurers must have been pleasantly surprised: the average increase
average for cars was 21.56%, above the average 21.11% requested by the
insurers' association MABISZ (EEIR061/18) due to the government's
granting of a increase for the largest engine power (and imported) cars
2.6 percentage points above that requested by MABISZ while slightly
cutting back on MABISZ's proposals for the smallest and mid-range
(mainly domestically-produced) ones. Rates for the smallest buses were
increased by more than MABISZ's request, and larger ones by less.
MABISZ did not secure the doubling of premium for lorries with cargo
weight of over 6 tonnes which it wanted, but the average increase of
54.27% was above the 48% it had sought.

GROWTH AND COMPETITION IN LIFE

Premium income for the Hungarian market as a whole for 1995 would need
to be of the order of 30% above the HUF93.5bn (US$668m) total for 1994
for any growth in real terms to be achieved, Figyelo calculated late in
December. Despite the continued relative dominance of Hungaria
Biztosito Rt, Budapest, over motor and of AB-Aegon tltalanos Biztosito
Rt, Budapest, over household, a competitive market is continuing to
develop, the paper considered, predicting that Hungaria's market share
for 1995 would drop from 38% to 36% and that of AB-Aegon from 26% to
24%. Competition this year would be particularly strong in liability
and commercial property, it said.

It had been competition for the growing life market which has been
responsible for most of the shifts in company market share in 1995,
Figyelo said. Such had been the success of Nationale-Nederlanden
Magyarorszagi Biztosito Rt, Budapest, that there was a possibility of
its soon replacing Providencia Osztrak-Magyar Biztosito Rt, Budapest,
as market number three, having retained its overall share of 10% (life
only) while that of Providencia had slipped back a percentage point to
11%. Nat-Ned and AB-Aegon, at the same time, are both anxious to claim
the title of largest life insurer in Hungary.

Of the medium-sized companies, Generali Budapest Biztosito Rt,
Budapest, had around 6%, the Figyelo calculated, followed by OTP-
Garancia Biztosito Rt and Colonia Biztosito Rt, both Budapest, with 4%
to 5% each. Despite the increases in premium achieved by these
companies, however, in life they were experiencing difficulty in
competing with the market leaders, Nat-Ned and AB-Aegon, it suggested,
while in some non-life lines - motor casco for example - the market was
shrinking in real terms.

Nat-Ned's dominance, the paper said, was due to its focus on high-value
business, estimating 1995 premium at HUF12.3bn. In 1994, Nat-Ned had a
37% share of the Hungarian life market. Last year, company president
Gyorgy Bordas told EEIR, premium increased by a further 71% to
HUF12.5bn. New business written totalled HUF5bn, and the company has
253,000 policyholders. The premium target for 1996 is HUF17bn. Nat-Ned
also continues to reinsure a substantial proportion of its business
within the ING Group, mainly due to local capital adequacy
considerations, although the proportion is declining from the 79% ceded
in 1994.

While AB-Aegon continued to dominate long-standing group life business,
and was projecting HUF13bn, Figyelo suggested that business from the
CSaB group policy was dropping off rapidly, and would only be replaced
by new individual business with difficulty.

A number of other companies had been reluctant to disclose a
preliminary estimate for 1995 life premium, possibly, the paper said,
because they had concentrated on low-value life policies with premiums
between HUF10,000 and HUF15,000 annually. Those attracted by the
affordability (and tax benefits) associated with these policies were
those hardest hit by economic pressures, and cancellations were high,
it said. Providencia, for example, had once vied with AB-Aegon in terms
of new business sold, but now had difficulty generating enough to make
up for cancellations, the paper suggested, predicting life premium of
HUF5bn for 1995, at 22% up on the HUF4.1bn of 1994 below the rate of
inflation.

At Generali, the increase would be up by only 14.5% to HUF300m, mainly
group life business, it predicted. Among the smaller companies, the
increase at Europa-GAN Biztosito Rt, Budapest, from HUF349m in 1994 to
about HUF480m was, at 37.5% positive growth in real terms, but not
spectacular.

Hungaria, on the other hand, appears to have improved its position.
Having dropped to a low of HUF500m in 1992, the forecast for 1995 was
HUF1.9bn, two and a half times the 1994 total. However, Hungaria too
had targeted lower incomes, "a very volatile market", Figyelo said.

COLONIA

As expected (EEIR061/17), Colonia made a net loss last year largely as
a result of losses of its motor TPL portfolio of 130% of premium,
including expenses, Otto Csurgo, recently promoted from deputy general
manager to general manager, confirmed at the beginning of January.
Premium income increased by 48.4%, from HUF3.556bn (US$25.4m) to
HUF5.2bn, of which motor was responsible for HUF2.8bn (54%), up from
HUF1.774bn (50%) in 1994, motor TPL representing HUF1.2bn compared to
HUF863m, 23% and 24% of total premium income respectively.

Colonia Biztosito is now 51% owned by central European holding company
Nordstern Colonia Central Europe Holding AG, Vienna, and 49% by Colonia
Finance Holdings BV.

EUROPA-GAN

Europa-GAN Biztosito Rt, Budapest, is to increase its capital by
between HUF500m and HUF1bn (US$3.5m to $7m), general manager Miklos
Szendi said in mid-January. Although both Groupe des Assurances
Nationales (GAN), Paris (currently owner of 89.4%), and Soc
Assicuratrice Industriale SpA (SAI), Turin (10%), will participate,
negotiations are also in progress with a Hungarian bank and a third
foreign investor, he added. The increased capital will be devoted to
extending its branch network and developing motor business
(EEIR058/12).

According to preliminary data, Europa-GAN's premium income last year
totalled HUF1.1bn in 1995, up 29% on the HUF893m written in 1994, and
about on a par with inflation. Life contributed HUF480m (HUF250m
individual and HUF230m group), commercial and other property HUF520m
and liability HUF100m.

GRAZER WECHSELSEITIGE

Grazer Wechselseitige Versicherung AG (GWV), Graz, has finally received
approval to establish a Hungarian subsidiary, Prima Austria Biztosito
Rt (EEIR060/20), the Official Gazette revealed at the beginning of
January. Its previous application in September 1994 was blocked
(EEIR052/13), following a dispute over capitalisation and the status of
premium on GWV policies sold in Hungary illegally by pyramid sales
agencies. According to a report by the Hungarian news agency MTI-
Econews, it appears that GVW's application was granted by the Hungarian
government shortly before the new insurance law (Law XCVI of 1995) came
into effect on 1 January.

GWV re-applied for a licence in September (EEIR060/20). Under the new
insurance law, final responsibility for licensing insurers passes from
government to the Insurance Supervisory Office, which may refuse
applications, inter alia, because a founder has an unsatisfactory
business reputation. Previously, the ISO only made recommendations to
the legal and financial departments of the Finance Ministry, which then
studied the application independently and submitted recommendations to
a ministerial committee, which sent its report to the cabinet for final
approval of the application. Econews reported that GWV's application
was classified as "strictly confidential", but quoted Finance Ministry
Legal Department head Zoltan Molnar as indicating that this was "quite
common" for government documents.

Vilaggazdasag reported on 15 January that it understood that the
insurers' association MABISZ had asked Finance Minister Lajos Bokros to
explain why the incorporation of Prima Austria had been approved.

Econews gave an estimate of total foreign currency outflow to
unlicensed life insurers of HUF70bn (US$500m) from 50,000 policies,
which seems rather high.

WINTERTHUR

Winterthur Schweizerische Versicherungs Ges, Winterthur, received its
licence for a Hungarian subsidiary on 27 December, four days before the
entry into force of the new insurance law permitting establishment of a
composite insurer. Registered capital was the old minimum of HUF1bn
(US$7.14m) is currently held 100% by Winterthur, but the European Bank
for Reconstruction & Development (EBRD) is expected to acquire 30%
during the year (EEIR060/20, 059/19), and operations are not expected
to begin before the autumn, initially in life and pension only.
Winterthur established fund management company Winterthur
Penztarszolgaltato Rt in September, with capital of HUF370m, and into
which the parent company is expected to inject a further HUF100m and
the EBRD HUF200m, and Winterthur National Pension Fund was set up on 8

UNOFFICIAL LIMIT ON FOREIGN INVESTMENT?

Unnamed officials have confirmed to Rzeczpospolita that Poland is
operating an informal limit of 30% on foreign participation in local
insurers, the newspaper reported, as has long been suspected by
observers (EEIR056/4). The deputy finance minister responsible for
approving insurance company licences is apparently advised not to sign
if foreign participation exceeds this limit, the newspaper added,
suggesting that this would appear to be in contravention of the
obligations of the preliminary agreement to form the World Trade
Organisation signed by Poland last year, under which signatory
countries are not supposed to impose additional restrictions on the
activities of foreign investors in their financial services markets.

The Insurance Law, as newly amended, requires Finance Ministry approval
for insurers which are fully foreign-owned, and at six thresholds
between 15% (of voting or non-voting shares) to 75% of voting rights,
but also lays down that applications may only be refused on grounds
identical with those applied to Polish shareholders. However, these
include if "An important state economic interest is threatened"
(EEIR061/2).

Azur Ostoja SA, Warsaw, has an approved foreign shareholding of 84.6%,
the newspaper reported, and Gerling Konzern Allgemeine Versicherungs
AG, Cologne, 51.2% of TU Turystycznych ATU SA, Warsaw, but only 49% of
voting rights. Fourteen non-life insurers - one third of the total -
have an element of foreign capital, and seven out of 12 life insurers.

The decree holding VAT on insurance intermediary services at 7% for
1996 (EEIR 062/17) duly appeared in the final issue of Dziennik Ustaw
(Legal Gazette) for 1995, number 154. However, as the Finance Minister
has again applied a derogation to the statute imposing VAT, leaving the
underlying statute unchanged, a further derogation will be required if
the rate is not to rise to the standard 22% on 1 January 1997.

MOTOR RATES RISE

Powszechny Zaklad Ubezpieczen SA (PZU), Warsaw, has increased motor TPL
premiums by an average of 35% this year, its basic annual premium for a
Fiat 126 (with a 652cc engine) in Warsaw rising to ZL235 (US$94) and
for a car of 2,000cc engine capacity to ZL615. Last year, PZU sold
about 9m MTPL policies.

Other insurers are charging between ZL160 and ZL600 for the 126, and
between ZL308 and ZL919 for the 2 litre in Warsaw. Premiums for other
areas are lower: in Lublin (near the Ukrainian border), for example,
the premiums range from ZL 93 to ZL400 and ZL231 to ZL839 respectively.

No claims bonuses, and other discounts such as those for customer
loyalty or paying the annual premium in a lump sum, can yield a
reduction of up to 70% of the basic premium.

that somewhere between 10% and 20% of Polish motorists drove around
without insurance.

OMBUDSMAN ON PROBLEMS

The main problems facing the Polish insurance market were the financial
weakness of the insurers and the excessive expectations of clients
together with their lack of knowledge and understanding of both the
insurance market and insurance law, newly-appointed Polish insurance
ombudsman Stanislaw Rogowski told a press conference. Mr Rogowski said
he intended to be a mediator between companies and their clients as
well as between the companies and the National

Insurance Supervisory Office (PUNU). Although he has no formal powers
of decision, he can draw attention to injustices being committed in the
industry.

WARNING ON EXCESSIVE COMMISSIONS

Leon Kozicki, president of the brokers' association Stowarzyszenie
Polskich Brokerow Ubezpieczeniowych i Reasekuracyjnych, warned the
recent Insurers' Congress organised by the Polish Insurance
Professionals Association (SUP) of the dangers of excessive commissions
when competing for large clients. "If a company pays 50% commission,
the situation can last a year or two; after that the company will not
be there," he said.

GRYF

The late bid by Powszechny Zaklad Ubezpieczen SA (PZU), Warsaw, to
rescue Pomorskie TU Gryf SA, Bydgoszcz (EEIR062/1), appears to be being
still assembled, invitations to join an all-Polish consortium not being
sent out until after Christmas. A further potential obstacle remains
the attitude of the Anti-Monopoly Office, which may take a view on any
plan that involves increasing PZU's estimated 62.6% share of the Polish
non-life market, were it considered that such an increase posed a
threat to competition.

Nor is it yet clear whether other insurers which had expressed an
interest in taking over Gryf's insurance portfolio in full or in part
would still be interested if that involved joining a PZU-led
consortium. Also the subject of discussion locally is the effect of
assuming Gryf's portfolio on PZU's already-strained solvency margin,
which was still inadequate at the last count. Strictly speaking, Polish
law requires a company assuming the policies of another to have an
adequate solvency margin.

The decision by the insurance industry - formally under the auspices of
meetings of the Policyholders' Protection Fund and the Insurance
Guarantee Fund - to withdraw backing from the rescue plan formulated by
Winterthur Schweizerisches Versicherungs Ges, Winterthur, and TU PBK
SA, Warsaw, would appear to have been motivated by fear of allowing a
major foreign competitor into the market. The PZU plan may be slightly
cheaper, requiring a loan of ZL55m (US$21.7m) from the two funds (which
are due to be merged) rather ZL60m ($23.7m), but as a Winterthur
spokesman pointed out, the PZU plan did not propose to meet Gryf's
other obligations, such as those to the state, or to preserve its
network of sales offices.

At a press conference, TUiR Warta SA, Warsaw, president Henryk Chmielak
hedged when asked questions about the possibility of joining the PZU
consortium, saying only that Gryf's portfolio would be examined to see
whether there were any interesting parts. Warta would concentrate on
producing good financial results rather than chasing market share,
considering that fighting for premium without considering costs was a
short-term policy, he said, citing the experience of Pomorskie TU Gryf
SA (under administration), Bydgoszcz, and ZU Hestja SA, Poznan.

HESTJA (POZNAN)

ZU Hestja SA, Poznan (no connection with Sopockie TU Hestia Insurance
SA, Sopot), has reportedly failed to meet an extended deadline for a
capital increase to meet own funds requirements. While management
continued to try to raise the required funds, Dariusz Blaszczuk,
director of the Finance Ministry insurance department was quoted as
indicating that a number of companies were interested in taking a
strategic stake in Hestja. One of these is said to be Bankowe TUiR
Heros SA, Warsaw, which a company spokesman would neither confirm nor
deny.

In late 1994, a net loss of over ZL10m (US$4m) wiped out Hestja's own
capital of ZL3.3m, Rzeczpospolita. The company proposed a capital
increase of ZL24m to ZL55m ($9.6m to $22m) through the issue of new
Series D and E shares, and sale of the Series D shares took place in
October 1995, bringing in a notional ZL27m of which only about a
quarter was paid up. Hestja requested an extension until 15 December,
which appears was insufficient.

Hestja's leading shareholder is reported as Centralny Fundusz
Inwestycyjny Sp.zoo (in turn owned by Solaris Holding SA and Solaris
SA, EEIR041/17), which is also a shareholder in ZUiR Polonia, Lodz, and
in Pomorskie TU Gryf SA, Bydgoszcz (under administration).

POLISA

TU-R Polisa SA, Warsaw, has completed its new Series H share issue
(EEIR062/19), with 1,192,458 shares of up to 3.2m on offer at ZL8
(US$3.16) per ZL2.5 nominal share taken up. The main buyers appear to
have been Bel Leasing Sp zoo and Forin Sp zoo, both subsidiaries of
Bank Inicjatyw Gospodarczych SA (BIG), which took up between 500,000
and 650,000 of the shares on offer. Final details of the new
shareholders were due to be published once shareholdings had been
registered.

At one time, BIG held up to 30% of Polisa. Prior to the latest share
issue, the holdings of Bel-Leasing and Forin had been diluted to 6.4%
and 3.76% respectively. Following the stake-rebuilding, they are
expected to hold about 13%. Polisa deputy president Zygfryd Kielarski
was quoted as saying that a total of 656 individuals and companies had
taken up shares from the issue.

Polisa's share capital has therefore increased by ZL2.98m to ZL26.98m,
with the remaining proceeds of ZL6.56m earmarked for reserve capital to
obviate any difficulties with solvency margins.

Polisa may need to set aside reserves for the loss of up to ZL5.11m on
its stake in Tarpan Sp zoo, a motor company based in Poznan which
manufactures an all-terrain vehicle, and is on the verge of bankruptcy.
Polisa's shareholding was acquired when Tarpan's predecessor company,
Poznanska Fabryka Samochodow Rolniczych Polmo, failed to repay a credit
guaranteed by the insurer. The holding was originally valued at
ZL11.4m, but Polisa ceded part of it to Powszechny Zaklad Ubezpieczen
(PZU) SA, Warsaw. Even so, it accounted for a substantial slice of
Polisa's investment portfolio of ZL22.14m as of June 1995, when it
sought permission from the Finance Ministry to maintain such a high
proportion in one stock. Both Tarpan management and Polisa blamed the
failure of the motor manufacturer on indecision by the Defence
Ministry, which took a long time to decide to buy the Tarpan's Honcker
all-terrain vehicle despite the fact that it had been designed in
collaboration with the army. Polisa and PZU may secure some return if,
as is hoped, another manufacturer is found to take over manufacture of
the Honcker.

TU na Zycie Polisa-Zycie SA, Warsaw, has announced that three companies
recently bought 31% of its shares (EEIR060/22), but has not yet
revealed their identities. Since it also announced that Michal Solowow
and Wojciech Ciesielski had joined the supervisory board,
Rzeczpospolita suggested that Echo Press SA and Polish Life Improvement
SA, in which Mr Solowow has controlling interests, may be among the new
Polisa-Zycie shareholders. Mr Ciesielski is a large shareholder in Echo
Press.
