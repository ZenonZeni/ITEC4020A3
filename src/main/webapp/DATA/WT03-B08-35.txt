FIBERITE TO BUY HERCULES
Industry Consolidation Continues as Weaver/Prepregger
Signs Letter for $135-Million Buy of Carbon Fiber Maker

Consolidation in the advanced composites
industry continues at breakneck pace as
Tempe, Arizona-based Fiberite -- itself
freshly spun off from Britain's ICI -- has
signed a letter of intent to acquire the Utah
carbon fiber and prepreg activities of
Hercules.
    The combined company would have sales
in excess of $300 million per year, says
Fiberite CEO Jim Ashton.
    "This announcement should come as no
surprise," Hercules chairman Thomas Gossage
said in a statement. "In light of declining
defense spending, our strategy has been to
couple Composite Products with another
composites business to create a major
supplier for growing commercial markets."

Carbon to be Separate

    The sale nonetheless marks the end of
an era of Hercules in aerospace, as the
company sold its composite structures
business to Alliant Techsystems last year.
The various Hercules Composite Products
operations have annual sales of about $100
million, some 80 percent of which is believed
to be in fiber.
    "We view the graphite fiber business
effectively as a separate business and will
run it that way," Ashton told PM. He notes
that a chronic overcapacity situation in
carbon fiber has largely evaporated, with
some grades of material now in short supply.
    Fiberite already holds license rights
to some Hercules prepreg, notably 3501-6, a
high-volume epoxy with applications on U.S.
Navy aircraft.
    Fiberite, which last year absorbed the
former U.S. Polymeric business of BP
Chemicals, will be the second largest U.S.
weaver-prepregger if the pending merger with
Ciba Composites boosts Hexcel to the $600-
million annual sales level. But Fiberite will
have a clear edge in vertical integration if
it is able to acquire Hercules and its AS-4,
IM-7, and other carbon fiber lines. Hercules
is basic in carbon fiber precursor too,
making white polyacrylonitrile material at a
plant in Decatur, Ala. that is to be part of
the Fiberite buy. Hexcel and Ciba have no in-
house fiber-making capability.
    [Ciba once held just shy of 25 percent
of the Akzo-Tenax PAN-based fiber operation
in Wuppertal, Germany, relinquishing its
share when Japan's Toho Rayon took a
controlling interest in the European venture
with Akzo Nobel as a minority partner.]
    Besides Decatur and the Hercules carbon
fiber operation in Magna, Utah, Fiberite will
acquire a Hercules prepreg unit in Spain.
Hercules Composite Products employs some 470
people counting the three plants and
headquarters staff in Wilmington, Del.

SMARTweave for RTM
The U.S. Army and Delaware Institute
Have an RTM Cure-Monitoring Method

The Center for Composite Materials (CCM) at
the University of Delaware is promoting a new
process for controlling resin flow in resin
transfer molding part fabrication. The
process was developed via a collaboration
with the U.S. Army Materials Directorate.
    Dubbed SMARTweave, (SMART is an acronym
for sensors mounted as roving threads), the
process is described as "a patented system
for sensing the existence and state of cure
of the resin in RTM manufacturing. The sensor
grid, which comprises two orthogonal sets of
conductive filaments separated by one or more
preform layers, is placed within the
composite mold.
    As resin fills the mold, the gaps
between the filament planes are filled with
conductive resin, which completes an
electrical circuit. Associated
instrumentation detects the signal and can
infer resin location and, in some resins,
cure state."
    The SMARTweave process was initially
developed in the late 1980s but work has been
revived due to "the recent rise in popularity
of RTM." Recent improvements have included an
increased number of sensors and better
instrumentation.
    The process is related to smart
structures technology, too, as CCM notes that
the sensors embedded in the parts can
continue to function during the service life
of the parts.

GOETZ MASTS
Change in Racing Rules Spurs Demand
For Composite Masts for Sailing Yachts

Last year's change in IMS standards governing
the use of carbon fiber on racing yachts has
spurred demand for the material, reports
Goetz Marine Technology of Bristol, R.I.
    "For years this rule has prohibited
carbon material in masts and spars," says
Goetz marketing manager Ben Sprague. Now the
company has a new opportunity to move the
lightweight masts, which it builds via
"proprietary fiber compaction techniques"
which maintain fiber alignment and minimize
voids.
    "The parts we build at Goetz Marine
have a void content of less than 1 percent,
equal in strength yet without the
complication of an autoclave," the firm says.
Goetz claims a perfect performance record for
over 100 carbon fiber masts it has placed in
service.

CULVER CITY
New Products Key Former SP Gameplan;
Parent AMP Seeks to Buy More, Go Public

A new epoxy for large jet engine parts and a
fire-safe phenolic for transportation system
interiors are key to the business plan of
Culver City Composites Corporation, a new
company formed following the acquisition of
Los Angeles' SP Systems.
    The former SP prepreg operations were
bought by The American Materials &
Technologies Corporation, which is headed by
Paul Pendorf, formerly of Fiberite and XXsys
Technologies.
    The SP sale, which had been pending
since at least last summer (PM, July 17), was
wrapped up in Boston on December 20.
    The purchase price was not disclosed.
    Pendorf is acting president and general
manager of Culver effective January 1
following the resignation of SP president
John Shoemaker. Pendorf plans to recruit a
new Culver chief as he returns his attention
to the acquisition entity AMT.
    Plans are to take AMT public by mid-
year while pursuing further advanced material
acquisition opportunities, Pendorf told PM.
    Culver City hopes to capitalize on its
position in high-temperature (primarily PMR-
15) composites for jet engines with a new
epoxy, CE-9013, said to combine advantages of
250F-cure self-adhesive and 350F-cure
structural materials, says Culver R&D chief
Jerry Hartman.

'Not Autoclave-Oriented'

    The material boasts 30-day tack
retention at ambient temperatures, says
Hartman, and SP has achieved void contents as
low as 3 percent on woven fibers using
straight vacuum bagging. Many jet engine and
nacelle manufacturers use subcontractors for
relatively large parts, he says, and "a lot
of them are not autoclave-oriented."
    Culver's new phenolic, designated CPH-
2400, draws on the company's experience in
materials for aircraft interiors, says
Pendorf, but the new company plans to tackle
bus, subway, intercity train "and even cruise
ship" markets.
    The product's distinction is its fire
performance, as it has been tested for 20/20
OSU peak/total heat release as compared to
the current Federal Aviation Administration
standard of 65/65.
    "There's a crying need for this type of
material" if advanced composites are to
seriously penetrate mass transit markets,
Pendorf says.
    Both the CE-9013 epoxy and CPH-2400
phenolic will be formally unveiled this year.
One venue will be the big spring SAMPE
meeting in late March, where Culver will
abandon SP's "hospitality suite only" policy
and mount a full display.

Pendorf, 310-841-5200; fax 310-837-2845

FROM PUFFS TO PUTTS
Cobra Golf and its Shaft Lines Bought
By American Brands After Tobacco Sale

American Brands has formed a new golf
powerhouse by acquiring the Cobra Golf line
of clubs as a complement to its Titleist ball
line. The overall $700-million acquisition
includes the West Coast Composites carbon
fiber autoclave shaft operation at Carlsbad,
Calif. that was bought by Cobra in 1991.
    "Together, the Cobra and Titleist
brands will strengthen American Brands'
position as the world leader in the estimated
$4 billion golf industry," said Standard &
Poor's, which noted that American Brands
bankrolled the purchase with proceeds from
divested tobacco and life insurance
businesses.

Competitor Callaway Supports the Deal

    "As a very small owner of Cobra stock,
Callaway Golf Company will vote in favor of
the proposed merger," said a statement by the
rival clubmaker. "We see strong positives
developing long term for Callaway Golf, and
for golf in general" behind the Cobra-
Titleist marriage, Callaway said
    Cobra-West Coast makes upwards of 8,000
shafts a day at Carlsbad, primarily with
carbon fiber prepreg with a limited amount of
glass in the shaft tips, says West Coast
Composites GM Rich Bayer. For 1996, "It's
going to be Newport getting the bulk of our
business," Bayer says, although West Coast
also buys from Fiberite and Toray Industries.
The company uses standard, medium and high-
modulus fiber grades from a variety of
suppliers.
    "We're one of the few companies that's
autoclave-curing graphite shafts," Bayer
says. The process yields stronger clubs
containing less material per unit, and allows
West Coast to avoid the cell-wrapping that
necessitates extra sanding and finishing
steps.

Independent in Shafts

    "We're very close to a net part out of
the autoclave," Bayer says.
    The West Coast GM also notes that Cobra
Golf is one of the few manufacturers to be
successful in full sets of golf clubs,
manufacturing and marketing both woods and
irons. Cobra also makes all its own shafts,
at West Coast: "We don't go to anybody else,"
Bayer told PM.
    Callaway, which is also based in
Carlsbad, took the opportunity of media
attention on the American Brands-Cobra deal
to talk up its own clubs, including the "Big
Bertha" line with shafts from Aldila.
    "Significant expansion in the world's
golf club markets occurs only when one
creates truly innovative golf clubs which
prove to be especially rewarding to the great
majority of golfers, Callaway said, citing
the example of Aldila graphite shafts in the
early 1980s.
    "As for the expected commercial
possibilities in enlarged metal wood club
heads made of titanium," Callaway said, the
"Great Big Bertha" driver with a Ruger
Titanium head "has already achieved 25
tournament wins this year, and is now being
used regularly by approximately 150
professional golfers on the five major
tours."

It's Not the Metal

    But, "We believe the success of Great
Big Bertha is more related to the S2H2 design
concept in conjunction with the War Bird
soleplate and the ultra-light Great Big
Bertha shaft, than with the use of any
particular metal.
    "Unless a truly superior shaft and a
unique club head with truly great design is
used, the metal itself is not the answer,"
Callaway said. "This has been true with
stainless steel and we think that this will
be equally true with titanium."

ALDILA ACTION, TOO
Premiere Shaftmaker Has New President
And a Highly Automated Finishing Line

Former Hillerich & Bradsby Powerbilt golf
president Ed Abrain took over as Aldila
president last week as Gary Barbera assumed
the position of chairman of the board.
    San Diego-based Aldila has also
instituted a 100-foot-long, 140-second,
automated shaft finishing inspection line at
its Poway facility . The line has 10
interchangeable modules and will help provide
"greater consistency and repeatability for
our customers," Barbera said in a statement.
    Also new at Poway are an automatic
shaft wash/dry system, an automatic mandrel
clean/release system, and two conveyorized
paint curing systems.
    The Poway enhancements were engineered
by an Aldila team headed by Lisa Burgett
(manager of manufacturing engineering) and
Kevin Egelhoff (product design manager).
Their two-year project included "three months
of production testing prior to full
implementation," the company says.
    "The consistency of the blank shafts we
have been producing is impressive," Burgett
said in a release.
    Aldila says it's invested some $7
million in automation over the past three
years.

THIOKOL -- THE PREPREGGER
Present Posture Can Be Traced to Amoco's
Exit;
Rocketmaker Offers Wovens on All Fiber Types

Thiokol's new presence as a prepregger is
based in large part on technology it
developed in the wake of Amoco's departure
from the prepreg business, when Thiokol was
forced to step up development of its own
matrix material for the Castor 120 solid
rocket motor.
    Thiokol replaced Amoco's ERL-1908 epoxy
with its own UF-3323 material for the Castor
120, which is filament wound with premium T-
1000G carbon fiber from Toray Industries. The
change was made some two and a half years
ago.

Tailored Properties, Room-Temperature Storage

    UF-3323 is now the basis for a family
of prepregs available both as towpreg for
filament winding or as woven broadgoods, says
Thiokol's Rolf Johns. Prepregs are made at
Brigham City, Utah.
    The company works with several
suppliers of dry woven fabric, and has
prepregged aramid, carbon (both PAN- and
pitch-based) and glass fiber from nearly all
of the fiber suppliers, including vendors of
large-tow carbon fiber material such as Akzo
Fortafil and Zoltek.
    As for resin, "We will tailor the
formulations to what people need processing-
wise," Johns says. The original UF-3323
required a 24-hour cure at 270F, he says by
way of example; now Thiokol offers UF-3325
with a four-hour cure. Another key selling
point is a product line that requires no
refrigeration, with room-temperature shelf
life "measured in years, not weeks" (PM,
December 18).
    Besides the UF-3323 towpreg for case
filament-winding, Thiokol now employs its own
woven prepreg for the Castor 120 skirts. It
also supplies prepreg as the cosmetic outer
layer for ski poles.
    The company hopes to mount a display at
this year's SAMPE spring meeting in Anaheim.

NOW IT'S ITALY
Lanxide Has Another Deal for Brakes,
This Time it's MMCs for Italy's Brembo

Delaware-based Lanxide, a specialist in
ceramic-reinforced wear materials, has
notched another licensing deal with an
automotive brake manufacturer. Brembo, a
$200-million company in Curno, Italy, will
use Lanxide knowhow to make metal-matrix
composite brake disks and drums in Europe.
    Lanxide late last year publicized a
deal allowing several companies to make
ceramic-reinforced brake components at the
Lanxide facility in Newark, including Japan's
Nihon Cement and Lanxide affiliate Kanematsu.
Ceramic-reinforced aluminum rotors using
Lanxide material are on Britain's Lotus Elise
sports car. The Lotus parts are made by
Waupaca Foundry, a Lanxide licensee in
Waupaca, Wisc.
    Lanxide has a pressureless metal
infiltration technology, dubbed "Primex," it
says "has enabled it to engineer a new class
of high performance materials which offer
superior combinations of properties tailored
to meet specific customer needs."
    Brembo's license allows it to make
Lanxide-style silicon carbide or alumina
particulate-reinforced aluminum components
via the Primex process or by conventional
casting, says Lanxide corporate development
VP Mike Hollins. Brembo makes brake parts and
systems for cars, trucks and motorcycles,
supplying both OEMs and the aftermarket.
    Lanxide also said last month that A.P.
Green Industries had acquired a 51-percent
interest in its high performance refractory
materials business, Lanxide ThermoComposites,
Inc.

'PURGE'
Past Mistakes Done, Mistakemakers Gone,
Says Quadrax: 'Basics Have Been Rebuilt'

Quadrax is still losing money, but revenues
are up dramatically, and the yearlong
president of the Rhode Island thermoplastic
specialist says the turnaround "reflects the
impact of actions taken to bring to an end
the effects of the decisions made by those
who previously controlled the company."
    Quadrax lost just under $7.04 million
for the first nine months of 1995 compared
with a loss of $5.96 million for the first
nine months of 1994. But sales were up to
$3.49 million for the nine-month period last
year as compared to sales of just $521,000
for the first nine months of 1994.

Cannondale Bicycles and Bicycle Parts

    Most of the Quadrax loss -- $4.12
million -- thus far for 1995 is from the
third quarter as the company made payments
related to loans and stock obligations
leftover from previous management, and paid
compensation to departed executes and
consultants, president Jim Palermo has
advised stockholders. "We have purged the
problems of the past," he said.
    The company has shifted away from high-
end thermoplastics, employing nylon-matrix
composites for sporting goods applications
and even more economical materials like
polypropylene where warranted.
    Quadrax has a heavy emphasis on tennis
racquets, but is also involved in lacrosse
sticks, athletic protective gear, and, more
recently, in bicycles, where it is working
with Cannondale on a monocoque composite
bicycle frame. Quadrax is also gearing up to
supply such bicycle parts as thermoplastic
composite seat posts, handlebars and wheels.
    Quadrax has licensed its manufacturing
process to Taiwan's Topkey for tennis
racquets in what Palermo calls the first of
"a limited number of licensing arrangements."
The Topkey license may be expanded from
tennis racquets to other "rolled tube"
products.

RECOVERY
A Better Market Situation for Graphite
Prompts 14-Percent Soficar Expansion

Soficar, an affiliate of Japan's Toray
Industries that makes carbon fiber in Abidos,
France, is expanding its production
capability by just over 14 percent, from 700
to 800 metric tons (from 1.42 to 1.62 million
pounds) per year.
    Soficar (Societe des Fibres de Carbone)
cites an international carbon fiber market
recovery and forecasts for increased
industrial use of the high-strength material.

No New Investment

    The carbon fiber company further says
that it will effect the expansion "due to an
optimized working organization ... without
any new investment, and without any process
modification."
    "This additional capacity enables
Soficar to reaffirm its leadership [of the]
European carbon fiber market and consolidate
the number one position in this field of
Toray Industries," says a statement.
    The expansion will give the Toray group
a worldwide production capability for 3,700
metric tons per year of carbon fiber, just
under 7.5 million pounds.

Owens-Corning Teams with Mahindra
For $100-Million Fiber Plant in India

U.S.-based Owens-Corning disclosed plans last
month for a glass fiber reinforcements plant
in India via a joint venture with the
Mahindra Group.
    The plant is planned for Taloja, north
of Bombay, with a total investment of some
3.5 billion Indian rupees, or $100 million
U.S. Initial capacity upon completion in 1998
will be 30,000 metric tons, or more than 66
million pounds of glass fiber per year.
    The plant will be expandable to 90,000
metric tons of material per year. The
Mahindra partnership and the plant at Taloja
mark O-C's first direct participation in the
Indian market.
    "We have targeted India as a strategic
growth segment and intend to be a long-term
direct participant in this important and
growing economy," O-C chairman and CEO Glen
Hiner said in statement.
    "It is important to partner with the
right local firm in India, and the Mahindra
Group is an excellent choice. We look forward
to working closely with them to develop our
business," Hiner said.
    Financial details were not disclosed.
    About 25 percent of the production from
the Taloja plant will be sold in India, the
partners say, "and the rest will be available
for the global composites market." Most of
the production from India will be sold in
Southeast Asia and the Middle East, with the
automotive industry singled out by Madhusudan
Dewan, managing director of Owens-Corning's
operations in India.

Marketing in '95, a Tech Center in '96

    O-C earlier last year established
offices in the south-central Indian city of
Bangalore and secured land rights for the
Taloja plant site near Bombay.
    "Owens-Corning will establish an
Application Development Center in Bangalore
in 1996," Dewan said, "to help companies
operating in India develop new end-use
products using building and glass composite
materials and technology."
    The announcement last month was O-C's
third during the quarter detailing plans to
increase capacity for glass fiber over the
next three years. In early October, the
company unveiled plans to add 45,000 metric
tons of capacity to existing facilities in
Brazil and South Korea. Later that month,
Owens-Corning reported plans to add 135,000
metric tons of capacity to existing
facilities in Western Europe and North
America.
    The three total well over 460 million
pounds of new production capability.

Capacity Seen Stimulating Use

    "We expect the use of composite
materials to continue to grow and we are
actively developing plans to support that
growth with additional capacity. The
expansion plans being developed now are over
and above the increases we announced earlier
this year," said Carl Hedlund, Owens-Corning
president for Asia Pacific. "We are committed
to supporting the growth of the global
composites business."
    The market for composites is expected
to grow by about 5 percent per year in North
America and Western Europe, and by more than
10 percent per year in Asia and the Pacific,
Hedlund said, predicting that O-C's
commitment will encourage new advanced
materials applications.
    O-C has annual sales of some $3.4
billion with 17,000 employees in more than
100 facilities in 30 countries around the
world.

ARMY SATELLITES
UAVs and Space Control Among Areas
Of Interest as the U.S. Army Floats a BAA

Unmanned Aerial Vehicles and innovative
control systems are among the areas eligible
for funding under the U.S. Army Space and
Strategic Defense Command's Army Space
Applications Technology Program (Huntsville,
Ala.).
    UAVs are generally built with
composites while the integration of flywheel
energy and power storage devices with
traditional gyroscopic control may afford
designers a new way to cut space platform
weight or enhance satellite capabilities.
    USASSDC has floated a Broad Agency
Announcement stating that it expects to make
awards beginning early in 1997 for six- to
24-month projects "anticipated not to exceed
$1 million per contract."

Airbus is contracting with Malaysian
officials for manufacture of composite
aircraft components, states a Reuter report,
suggesting that the Europeans are trying to
mollify the Asians for a denial of increased
landing rights in Paris for Malaysian
Airlines. Malaysia sees composite parts
manufacturing as a way to boost its
participation in the world aircraft industry
(PM, June 19, 1995). Military spending by
Asian Pacific nations will come to $40
billion over the next five years, the
Malaysian defense minister said at a
conference at last month's Langkawi air show.

BUILDING BRIDGES
Getting Composites Approved for Structures
Poses Material Durability Database Challenges

The infrastructure, both new construction and
seismic retrofits, represents an almost
infinite market for composite materials,
where boosters feel they can bring bottom
line and life cycle advantages into play, and
even, largely because of weight savings,
effect significant reductions in overall
project costs.
    But infrastructure markets have been
slow to develop and engineers are learning
that a systems approach involving materials,
processes and application mechanisms, as well
as committed construction industry partners,
is the only way that advanced materials will
be accepted.
    "It's the total system that's going to
be qualified," says Fiberite's Ray Williams,
who has been pursuing the infrastructure
market for composites for eight years.
"That's the material, and the process used,
and the apparatus. It's the total system."

Composites Seen Process-Dependent

    "Composite materials can strengthen
structural elements, such as columns or
beams, and may possess economic potential in
retrofitting deficient structures," Mohsen
Sultan of the Engineering Services Center of
the California Department of Transportation,
or Caltrans, says in a paper delivered at a
federally sponsored seismic retrofit
conference last month in San Diego (the paper
was co-authored by Gary Hawkins of The
Aerospace Corporation). "Unfortunately, the
physical properties of composites are
extremely process dependent and may change
from batch to batch and from contractor to
contractor.
    "As a result, composites cannot be
procured like steel, which has very well
known and reproducible properties," Sultan
said. "Even though the [composites] industry
is rich in data related to aerospace and
marine applications, the data we need,
relevant to civil engineering applications,
is very limited."
    Caltrans, accordingly, has devised a
testing scheme aimed at developing standards
for composite building applications with an
initial focus on seismic retrofits. The
overall framework includes a $180,000 federal
grant for column testing at the University of
California at Irvine, the first-ever
administration of testing fees by SAMPE (the
Society for the Advancement of Material and
Process Engineering), and the active
participation of The Aerospace Corporation to
evaluate materials, particularly with an eye
to their long-term durability.

Five Organizations in Testing

    The five organizations that have thus
far contracted with SAMPE for $25,000 worth
of testing by The Aerospace Corporation are

 --> Mitsubishi/Obayashi,

 --> Tonen/Niccho Iwai,

 --> Newport Adhesives & Composites,

 --> Hexcel-Fyfe, and

 --> The American Materials & Technologies
Corporation.
    "The reproducibility and durability of
these systems does exist," says SAMPE
technical director Charlie Hamermesh. "We
just want to confirm it."
    The process is slow, but the stakes are
high. "We don't want to have a mistake made
and ruin it for everybody," says The
Aerospace Corporation's Gary Hawkins. A
highly visible bridge disaster would be the
worst possible thing if linked in the
public's eye with composites, but even a less
obtrusive mistake that required a building
job to be repeated could cast a pall over
composites in the eyes of the civil
engineering community.
Caltrans is Critical
    Another concern is that standards be
developed that encompass the whole range of
composite seismic retrofit techniques. "We'd
rather see a performance spec than a process
spec," says Hamermesh.
    "The State wants to do this and push it
through," Hawkins says of the Caltrans
effort. "We just want to do it carefully."
Hawkins notes too that if the composites
industry can convince Caltrans of the worth
of advanced materials, then other markets
will fall into place. Once Caltrans gives its
nod, he says, "not only do all the other
states fall into line, but a lot of countries
follow too. They really do lead the way."
