<b><u></u>I.  INTRODUCTION  </b><p>
<b></b><p>
This guide serves as a supplement to the IIT Graduate Bulletin of Programs and
as a checklist for graduate students in regard to the Mechanical, Materials and
Aerospace Engineering (MMAE) Department's procedural requirements and
deadlines.  Deadlines are established by the Graduate School, and are also
listed in the current IIT Graduate Bulletin.  The Graduate Student Handbook,
which is usually distributed by mail or at the registration for each semester,
is another university publication that discusses the university's academic
policies for graduate students and  answers students' most frequently asked
questions.  It is the student's responsibility, with guidance from his/her
adviser, to follow the procedures, and meet the specified deadlines. These
deadlines are not flexible and failure to meet them will result in postponement
of the student's graduation.<p>
<p>
The MMAE faculty have the ultimate responsibility for the comprehensive
departmental program.  The Chairman of the Department, Professor Marek Dollar,
with consultation from the faculty, appoints at least six faculty members from
different specialized areas of study to serve on the Graduate Studies
Committee.  The Graduate Studies Committee approves all ordinary procedural
matters, which include the student's Program of Study and appointments of
committees to evaluate student examinations.  When extraordinary changes in
degree programs or in departmental policies appear desirable, the Graduate
Studies Committee will make recommendations to the faculty for discussion and
approval. Leadership of the committee is the responsibility of the appointed
Chairman, Professor David Williams, and Co-Chairman, Professor Philip Nash.
The chairman, with assistance from the co-chairman handles the day-to-day
obligations of the graduate studies program, including graduate admissions and
new student advising.  Appointments to the Graduate Studies Committee are made
for a one year period, and are renewable on a year to year basis.  The
committee will usually meet once a month for the duration of the academic
year.<p>
<p>
The MMAE department offers graduate programs in <b>Mechanical and Aerospace
Engineering (MAE)</b>  leading to: <p><UL>
&#183;	Master of  Science in mechanical and aerospace engineering (MSMAE),<br>
&#183;	Master of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering (MEMAE) and<br>
&#183;	Doctor of Philosophy in mechanical and aerospace engineering.   </UL>
The department also offers graduate studies in <b>Metallurgical and Materials
Engineering (METM) </b>leading to:<p><UL>
&#183;	Master of Science in metallurgical and materials engineering (MSMETM)
<br>
&#183;	Master of Metallurgical and Materials Engineering (MEMETM) and <br>
&#183;	Doctor of Philosophy in metallurgical and materials engineering. </UL>
In addition, the department offers interdisciplinary programs leading to :<p><UL>
&#183;	Master of Science in manufacturing engineering  (MSMFG) and<br>
&#183;	Master of Manufacturing Engineering (MEMFG).</UL>

<a name="1.0"></a>
<b>1.  GENERAL OPERATING PROCEDURES</b><p>
<a name="1.1"></a>
<b>1.1  Registration Procedures</b><p>
<b></b>The Schedule of Classes for each semester is available at the end of the
previous semester and is mailed to continuing students.  This Schedule also
serves as an excellent guide to registration procedures.  <p>
<p>
Graduate students normally register for classes during arena registration (held
the week preceding the beginning of each semester).  New graduate students can
pick up their registration forms in the MMAE office, Room 243-E1, usually on
the Monday of registration week.  Continuing full-time students should receive
their forms by mail and may register in advance in April (for fall semester) or
November (for spring semester).  Those students who do not receive their
registration forms in the mail should contact the Registrar Office.  Students
who have not submitted a Program of Study prior to completing twelve credit
hours, or those who owe tuition or fees, will have their registration forms
withheld until such matters have been settled.  Students are urged to inform
the Registrar's Office of any change of address.<p>
<p>
Registration forms, once signed by the student and his/her adviser, are to be
submitted to the MMAE Office for the department chairman's approval.  The
student then takes the approved form to arena registration. Any changes made
after the approval will require the additional signature of the student's
adviser and the department chair. Students who cannot attend arena registration
should either pre-register or make arrangements for someone to register for
them.<p>
<p>
Graduate students receiving financial assistance are required to submit
approved registration forms (signed by the student and his/her adviser) to the
MMAE office no later than July 20th (for fall semester) or January 5th (for
spring semester).  Tuition vouchers will be prepared and attached to the
registration forms for approval by the department chair, the college dean, and
the dean of the Graduate College.  The department secretary will obtain these
signatures, provided that students submit their approved registration form
before the above listed deadline.  Approved registration forms and tuition
vouchers can then be picked up just prior to the start of the full-time
graduate students' arena registration session.  All students receiving
financial assistance from the MMAE department must be working towards a Master
of Science or a Doctor of Philosophy degree. <p>
<b></b><p>
<a name="1.2"></a>
<b>1.2 Special Graduate Student Status</b><b></b><p>
<b></b>A student who has not obtained admission to the Graduate School may seek
to register as a special graduate student.  Special graduate students must
complete a Special Student Application and submit an official transcript of all
previous undergraduate and graduate work to the Graduate Records Office. The
minimum requirements for permission to register, set by the Graduate School,
are a bachelor's degree from an accredited institution and a GPA of 2.5/4.0 or
equivalent.  Foreign students with F-1 visas issued by IIT may not be enrolled
as special graduate students.  Special graduate students may enroll for a
maximum of nine credit hours per semester.  All special graduate student
applicants planning to take MAE courses must obtain the approval of the Chair
of the MMAE Department Graduate Studies Committee.<p>
<p>
An applicant who is denied admission to the MMAE department's graduate program
may be allowed to enroll as a Special Graduate Student, if the department
believes that the applicant merits a chance to demonstrate his/her ability to
succeed in the program.  The department reserves the right to review and
approve or deny the application of any person who wishes to enroll in a
department course.  <p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b>A special graduate student must complete a minimum of six credit hours
of graduate coursework (maintaining a GPA of 3.0 or better) before the MMAE
department will reconsider his/her application for admission as a regular
graduate student.  Note that maintaining the minimum GPA requirement does not
guarantee admission to the MMAE department's graduate program.  Applications
for change of status from Special to Regular Graduate Student must be
accompanied by<b><i> Form #401, Program of Study </i></b>(sample available on
page 17), signed by a faculty member who is willing to serve as the student's
adviser.  The Graduate Studies Committee will then review the program of study
as part of the student's application for regular admission. No more than nine
credit hours of coursework taken as a special graduate student may be applied
towards the student's program of study.<p>
<b></b><p>
<a name="1.3"></a>
<b>1.3 Leave of Absence</b><p>
Students admitted to regular status are expected to maintain continued
registration (excluding summer semester) until graduation unless they are
granted a leave of absence from the Dean of the Graduate School.  For this
purpose, use<b><i> Form 216, Request for Leave of Absence, </i></b>(sample
available on  page 19). A student who withdraws without permission, or who lets
a granted leave of absence expire, must  apply to the department  for
readmission.  If less than three years has lapsed since the student registered,
readmission normally requires a letter of endorsement from the student's
adviser to the Dean of the Graduate School.  For absences of three years or
more, a new application and supporting documents (transcripts, letters of
recommendation) are required.  <p>
<b></b><p>
<a name="1.4"></a>
<b>1.4 Department Financial Assistance Policy</b><p>
The Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering has a limited number of
teaching assistantships available to graduate students in the department who
show a high potential for success in the programs and have necessary teaching
skills.  Applications (sample available on page 20) can be obtained from the
Department Secretary.  The Department Chairman awards these assistantships to
the most qualified students for a certain period of time during their degree
programs.  This period of support is determined by the Chairman for each
individual case.  In order to make these awards to as many deserving students
as possible, teaching assistantships are awarded for the maximum number of
semesters as follows:<p><UL>
&#183;	Master of Science Students: 3 semesters<br>
&#183;	Doctor of Philosophy students: 4 semesters<br>
&#183;	Ph.D.  students with a master's degree from IIT: 5 semesters</UL>
<p>
Only Master of Science and Doctor of Philosophy degree students are eligible
for teaching assistantships.  The availability of these assistantships is
dependent upon the needs of the department.  After this assistantship has been
used, a teaching assistant who is performing well may then  be supported by
his/her adviser as a research assistant.   The student is encouraged to pursue
a research assistantship as early in the program as possible.<p>
<p>
IIT's Financial Aid Office offers a limited program of financial assistance, in
the form of work opportunities and loans, to graduate students.  Consult the
IIT Bulletin or contact the Student Finance Center at 312/567-3303 for further
information.<p>
<p>
<a name="1.5"></a>
<b>1.5  Advising Procedures</b><p>
<b></b>The Chair of the Graduate Studies Committee serves as the temporary
adviser to all new mechanical and aerospace engineering graduate students.  The
Co-Chair of the Graduate Studies Committee serves as a temporary adviser to all
new metallurgical and materials engineering graduate students.  In many cases
the chairman and co-chairman serve as permanent advisers to part-time students.
All students are required to find a permanent adviser and submit a Program of
Study to the MMAE office before the beginning of the second semester for
full-time students<a href="guide_fn.html#p3fn1"><sup>1</sup></a>, or before enrollment
beyond 12 credit hours for part-time students.  All graduate students are
advised to leave changes to their mailing addresses and/or telephone numbers
with the MMAE department secretary.<p>
<p>
Students should consult with their advisers as early as possible, in order to
choose their courses.  Students registering for any of the following courses
should use their adviser's identification number as the section number when
registering:<p><UL>
&#183;	MAE 591 OR METM 591 -  Research and Thesis for M.S.<a
href="guide_fn.html#p3fn2"><sup>2</sup></a><b> </b>Degree<br>

<b><center>1. PROGRAM OF STUDY</b><p>
<b></center></b>The student selects courses, with guidance from his/her
adviser, and submits a Program of Study signed by  his/her adviser to the MMAE
office before the beginning of the second semester or before completing 12
credit hours. <b><i>Form #401, Program of Study, </i> </b>(sample available on
page 17), is employed for this purpose.  The Program of Study form once
approved by the adviser also requires the approval of the Graduate Studies
Committee and the signatures of the Chairman of the Department, and the dean of
the Graduate School. Once a student has filed an approved program of study,
deviation from the plan requires the same signatures on <b><i>Form #406, Change
in previously approved Program of Study,</i></b> (sample available on page 21)
as the original plan of  study.  After the student has chosen a permanent
adviser, to change advisers, it is necessary to complete F<b>orm #410,
</b>Change of Adviser (sample available on page 22).<p>
<p>
All full-time MMAE students must register each semester for either MAE 593
(Department Seminar Series for mechanical and aerospace engineering students)
or METM 593 (Department Seminar Series for metallurgical and materials
students.  Both seminars are no fee, no credit classes, but registration and
attendance for one hour a week is mandatory.  The seminar is a pass or fail
class and will be graded on attendance.  A student will receive a passing grade
if he/she attends a minimum of 80% of the seminars offered in that semester.

<b>2. COMPLETION OF STUDIES &amp; GRADUATION</b><p>
<b></b>Once a student successfully completes the coursework and thesis research
(if applicable) as outlined in his/her Program of Study,  the student files
an<b> <i>Application for Graduation,</i> <i>Form #527</i></b> (sample available
on page 23) with the Graduate Records Office, within two weeks of the start of
the intended graduation semester. The application is valid only in the semester
in which it is filed.  If the student fails to graduate in the intended
semester, then a new application must be filed for a later semester.<p>
<p>
After the application is filed, the Graduate College will mail to the
graduating student <i>The Sequence of Events and Deadlines</i>, applicable to
that semester. The student's adviser, using <b><i>MMAE Form #101</i>, <i>A
Request for Appointment of Committee</i></b> (sample available on page 24)<i>
</i> recommends, and the Graduate Studies Committee approves, the appointment
of  a Thesis Review and Examination Committee (T.R.E.C.) for M.S. students,  or
an Examination Committee for M.E. students.  The committee consists of at least
three faculty members<a href="guide_fn.html#p8fn7"><sup>7</sup></a> whose purpose is to
evaluate the student's thesis (M.S.) or  non-thesis project assignment (M.E.),
and the  comprehensive examination. It is the student's responsibility to
ensure that the request for appointment is made.<p>
<p>
<A NAME="M2.1"></A>
<b>2.1  Master of Science Candidates </b><p>
<b>       Thesis and Comprehensive Examination Procedures</b><p>
<b></b>A mandatory  thesis preparation discussion is held early each semester
by the Graduate College to assist students in preparing their thesis and
alerting them to problems that may occur. The MMAE student's thesis must
conform to the guidelines given in the latest IIT Thesis Manual (complimentary
copies of the Thesis Manual will be distributed at the meeting). The Thesis
Manual can be purchased in the IIT Bookstore.<p>
<p>
The student prepares a preliminary draft of his/her thesis, at least five weeks
before graduation, and obtains the signature approval from his/her adviser,
each T.R.E.C. member, the department chair<a href="guide_fn.html#p8fn8"><sup>8</sup></a>
and the Graduate School Thesis Examiner using <b><i>Form #501A, Preliminary
Thesis Approval Form</i> </b>(sample available on page 25).  The Thesis
Examiner is available to the students for guidance in order to meet the
requirements set out in the Thesis Manual.   The student's initial appointment
with the Thesis Examiner must be made at least six weeks before the end of the
anticipated graduation semester.  The Thesis Examiner's schedule, phone number
and office location is posted in the Graduate College.  Meetings are by
appointment only.  <p>
<p>
At least seven days prior to the comprehensive examination, the student
distributes copies of the approved thesis draft to the T.R.E.C. members.
His/her adviser then sends a memo to all MMAE faculty members announcing the
place and time of the examination.  This memo should include an abstract of the
thesis.  It is the student's responsibility to ensure that this memo is sent on
time.  Failure to do so will result in the rescheduling of the examination.<p>
<p>
T.R.E.C. conducts a comprehensive oral examination on the student's thesis and
related areas. <a href="guide_fn.html#p8fn9"><sup>9</sup></a> This examination is
scheduled at a mutually convenient time and date, but must be taken at least
fifteen days prior to the end of the semester.  The adviser reports the results
of the examination to the department using <b><i>MMAE Form #103, Results of
Master's Comprehensive Examination </i></b>(sample available on page 26)
<b><i>and  Form #303, Master's Comprehensive/ Ph.D. Qualifying
Exam</i></b>(sample available on page 27).  <p>
<p>
The student obtains signature approvals of the final thesis draft from his/her
adviser, T.R.E.C. members, and the department chair on <b><i>Form #501B, Final
Thesis Approval,  </i></b>(sample available on page 25). The student pays the
advanced degree fee at the Bursar's office. At least 9 days before
commencement, the student meets with the Thesis Examiner for final thesis
approval with three unbound copies of the completed thesis in marked manila
envelopes with original signature of adviser on title pages, a Bursar's receipt
showing payment of fee, and<b> <i>Form #50lB</i></b> bearing all approval
signatures except the final Thesis Examiner's.<p>
<p>
Note:  Three copies of the thesis are required and after binding the library,

will not provide binding  for more than three copies, but the student is urged
to get his/her own private copy bound at the IIT Office Services or
elsewhere.<p>

<b>       Non-Thesis Project and Comprehensive Examination</b><p>
The adviser assigns the student a non-thesis project at least three weeks prior
to the comprehensive exam, and informs the examination committee of the
assignment. This assignment, while concentrating on the major area, may draw
upon the student's ability to apply the concepts of any or all of his/her
course-work. Students who have taken MAE or METM 594 or a 5x9 course (with the
exception of 509 &amp; 529) and wish to use their topics as the assignment may
do so with the approval of their advisor.<p>
<p>
At least seven days prior to the comprehensive exam, the student submits a
written report on the assignment (approved by his/her adviser) to each
Comprehensive Examination Committee members. The adviser sends a memo to all
MMAE faculty members, announcing the time and place of the exam.  This memo may
include a short abstract of the student's report. <p>
<p>
The comprehensive exam is an oral examination on the student's assignment
and/or related areas.<a href="guide_fn.html#p9fn10"><sup>10 </sup></a>  The student must also have available at
the time of the oral examination, a written draft of the assignment.  The
deadline for the comprehensive examination is one week prior to the last date
to report the comprehensive examination results.  The result of the oral
examination is reported by the adviser to the department on <b><i>MMAE Form
#103, Result of the Master's Comprehensive Examination </i></b>(example
available on page 26). <b> </b>The student then makes any minor corrections or
changes in the report that the comprehensive examination committee finds
necessary.  If major corrections or revisions are necessary, the student is
considered to have failed the examination.<a href="guide_fn.html#p9fn11"><sup>11</sup></a>
The student obtains the adviser's final approval of the assignment by signing
the <b><i>Form #303, Master's Comprehensive/Ph.D. Qualifying Examination
</i></b>(example available on page 27).  The student brings one copy of the
final report (for the departmental archives) and the signed <b><i>Form
#303</i></b> to the department chair.<p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b>As a result of the completion of courses and the above mentioned
efforts, the student graduates and is awarded an  M.E. Degree.<p>
<p>
Note: The Master of Engineering Programs in Mechanical and Aerospace
Engineering; and Metallurgical and Materials Engineering are being
significantly revised.  The new programs will be in effect for August 1996.
Changes were made to the programs in order to better accommodate the working
professional.<p>

<b>III. Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.)</b><b></b><p>
<b></b><p>
<i></i><p>
<i><center>The doctorate is awarded upon achievement of a high degree of
mastery in a field of knowledge and upon demonstration of a distinct ability to
make substantial creative contributions to that field.  The Ph.D. is not
awarded merely as a result of specific courses taken or of years spent in study
or research; the quality of work and the resourcefulness of the student must be
such that the faculty is convinced that the student will be capable of a
continuing effort toward the advancement of knowledge and continuing
achievement in research and other scholarly activities.	</i><p>
<i></center>IIT Graduate Bulletin of Programs  1994 -1996</i><p>

<A NAME="P1.0"></A>
<i></i><b>1. PROGRAM OF STUDY</b><p>
<b></b>The Ph.D. candidate will have met the requirements for a master's degree
or presented evidence that he/she has reached the equivalent level of
proficiency.  Students who have earned a Master's degree from IIT and wish to
pursue a doctorate must reapply to the Graduate School through the Graduate
Admissions Office. Work for the Ph.D. generally takes a minimum of three years
beyond the bachelor's degree (or six semesters of registration for at least 16
credit hours of graduate work each semester for a total of at least 96 credit
hours).  Some of the work done towards a master's degree in the same field may
apply toward satisfying the requirements for the Ph.D.<p>
<p>
Students who wish to transfer a Master's degree from another U.S. institution
should be prepared to provide course descriptions and/or syllabi to the
Graduate Studies Committee.  Students who wish to transfer a master's degree
from an international university must petition the MMAE Graduate Studies
Committee and should be prepared to provide appropriate documentation.
Documentation includes, but is not limited to, transcripts, catalogues with
course descriptions, course syllabi, and letters of endorsement from
individuals in the field who are familiar with the university and its programs.
The Graduate Studies Committee will evaluate the student's transcripts and
supporting documentation to determine how many transfer credits should be
awarded, according to IIT standards.<p>
<p>
The student selects a permanent adviser, (MAE students must also choose a major
and a minor from the four area of study)  and submits a program of study on<i>
<b> Form #401, Program of Study </b></i>(sample available on page 17) to the
MMAE office. (For a guide to developing an MAE Ph.D. Program of Study, see page
11; for a METM Ph.D. Program of Study, see page 12). Doctoral candidates who
have earned a master's degree must file a program of study before beginning the
second semester or before completing 12 credit hours. Doctoral candidates
without a master's degree must file an approved program of study within 16
months after initial enrollment or before completing 36 credit hours in the
Ph.D. program.<p>
<p>
The student's permanent adviser will help the student formulate an overall plan
of study, including coursework, reading, independent study and possibly a plan
of research.  A significant portion of the Program of Study is devoted to
independent research leading to a dissertation.  Each student must include the
equivalent of at least two semesters of full-time study devoted to research.
Semesters need not be consecutive.<p>
<p>
The Program of Study requires approval of the student's adviser, the Graduate
Studies Committee, the Department Chair, and the dean of the Graduate School.
Once a program of study is approved, any proposed changes must be submitted to
the Graduate Studies Committee on <b><i> Form #406, Change in Previously
Approved Program of Study,</i></b> (sample available on page
21).<b><i></i></b><p>
<b><i></i></b><p>
<b></b>All full-time MMAE students must register each semester for either MAE
593 (Department Seminar Series for mechanical and aerospace engineering
students) or METM 593 (Department Seminar Series for metallurgical and
materials students.  Both seminars are no fee, no credit classes, but
registration and attendance for one hour a week is mandatory.  The seminar is a
pass or fail class and will be graded on attendance.  A student will receive a
passing grade if he/she attends a minimum of 80% of the seminars offered in
that semester.  <p>

&#183;	the third semester - for students with M.S. degrees from other U.S.
institutions<br>
&#183;	the fourth semester - all other students.</UL>
<p>
The Ph.D. qualifying examination is a written examination given each February,
and is administered by an examination committee appointed by the Graduate
Studies Committee in cooperation with the faculty. If sufficient interest
exists, the qualifying exam may also be given in October.  No student may
register for MAE 691 or METM 691, Ph.D. Research and Thesis until he/she has
passed the qualifying examination.<p>
<p>
<A NAME="P2.1"></A>
<b>2.1  MAE Qualifying Exam</b> <p>
The Ph.D. qualifying examination for MAE students consists of 13 problems: <p><UL>
&#183;	two from Engineering Analysis (MAE 508, MAE 509)<br>
&#183;	one from Computational Methods (MAE 507)<br>
&#183;	two from Fluid Mechanics (MAE 510)<br>
&#183;	two from Thermal Sciences (MAE 520, MAE 582)<br>
&#183;	two from Solids and Structures (MAE 536)<br>
&#183;	two from Design and Manufacturing (MAE 564, MAE 565)<br>
&#183;	two from Dynamics and Vibrations (MAE 570, MAE 574)</UL>
<p>
Students must answer four of the problems as follows: one from engineering
analysis (not including computational methods), one from their major area, one
from their minor area, and one from any of the above areas.  Students are given
five hours to complete the four problems.  Based on the student's performance
on the written exam, the committee may decide to continue the exam in oral form
towards the end of the semester.  <p>

<b>3.3 Ph.D. Thesis Review &amp; Defense Examination Committee</b><p>
As the student nears completion of his/her dissertation, a Ph.D. Thesis Review
and Defense Examination Committee is appointed.  <p>
<p>
The members of the MAE student's  committee are:<p><UL>
&#183;	Comprehensive Examination Committee (without the engineering analysis
representative)</UL>
The members of the METM student's committee are:<p><UL>
&#183;	Comprehensive Examination Committee</UL>
<p>
A request for the appointment of this committee should be made by the adviser
to the Graduate Studies Committee on<b><i> MAE Form #101, Request for
Appointment of Committee,</i></b> (sample available on  page 24) in
anticipation of approval of the preliminary draft of the dissertation.  The
committee is then appointed by the dean of the Graduate College upon the
recommendation of the Graduate Studies Committee on <b><i>Form
#301</i></b><i>.</i>  Form 301 must be submitted to the dean of the Graduate
College at least two weeks prior to the exam and five weeks prior to
commencement.  <p>
<p>
A voluntary thesis preparation discussion is held early each semester to assist
students in preparing their thesis and alerting them to problems that may
occur.  The exact date and time are announced each semester by the  Graduate
College.  The MMAE student's thesis must conform to the guidelines given in the
latest IIT Thesis Manual (complimentary copies of the Thesis Manual will be
distributed at the meeting). The Thesis Manual can be purchased in the IIT
Bookstore. The Thesis Examiner is the appointed expert available to the
students for guidance in conforming to the requirements set out in the Thesis
Manual.   The student's initial appointment with the Thesis Examiner must be
made at least six weeks before the end of the anticipated graduation semester.
The Thesis Examiner's schedule, phone number and office location is posted in
the Graduate College.  <p>
<p>
Upon completion of the dissertation research, the student prepares a
preliminary draft of his/her dissertation and submits copies to the committee.
The student obtains approval of the preliminary draft of the dissertation from
the committee members, the Department Chair, and the Thesis Examiner (by prior
appointment) on <b><i>Form #501A, Preliminary Thesis Approval, </i></b>(sample
available on  page 25) at least 5 weeks before commencement.<p>
<p>
After the preliminary draft of the dissertation is approved, the student
defends his/her dissertation at a final oral public examination<a
href="guide_fn.html#p15fn8"><sup>8</sup></a>. The results of the Defense Examination should
be reported to the Graduate College on <b><i>Form # 309</i></b> (sample
available on page 28), by the student's advisor in the presence of all members
of the Comprehensive Examination Committee, and should be returned to the dean
of the Graduate College within 48 hours.<p>
<p>
Once the final draft is approved by the committee on<i> <b>Form #501B, Final
Thesis Approval,</b></i><b> </b>(sample available on page 25)<b> </b>the
student can obtain his/her  advisor's signature on the final draft of the
dissertation.  The student  can then pay the advanced degree fee in the
Bursar's office.<p>
<p>
The student meets with the Thesis Examiner at least 9 days before commencement
for final dissertation approval (by prior appointment) with the following:  <p><UL>
&#183;	Three copies of dissertation in separately labeled manila envelopes.<br>
&#183;	Bursar's receipt showing payment of fee.<br>
&#183;	Form #50lB bearing all approval signatures except the final Thesis
Examiner's.<br>
&#183;	Two copies of dissertation abstract of less than 60 words in
dissertation abstract style.<br>
&#183;	One copy of University Microfilms Agreement Form.<br>
&#183;	Two copies of the Survey of Earned Doctorates Form.<br>
&#183;	One separate title page.</UL>
<p>
Note:  Three copies of the dissertation are required and after binding, the
library, departmental reading room, and adviser each receives a copy.  The
student is urged to get his/her own private copy bound at the IIT Office
Services or elsewhere.  <p>
<p>
The student graduates with Ph.D. degree.<p>
<p>
