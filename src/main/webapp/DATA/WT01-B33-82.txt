<p>From: Opinion Section, Orange County Register<br>
September 10, 1996<br>
<br>
A view from the front lines of the drug war<br>
<br>
by Volney V. Brown Jr.<br>
<br>
Mr. Brown, who lives in Dana Point, was a US Magistrate in Los
Angeles from<br>
1982 to 1995.<br>
<br>
In his open letter to the Register of Aug. 12, Superior Court
Judge James<br>
Gray observed that drug law enforcement has been unable to stop
the flow of<br>
street drugs.<br>
He called for us to reason together to have dialogue on the
subject of<br>
illicit drug use - before again mindless ly escalating the war on
drugs,<br>
which diverts tax money from other programs, arguably promotes
general<br>
crime, and has a tendency to impair the civil liberties of every
American.<br>
The published response of Register readers was quite negative.
Despite the<br>
evidence, they &quot;feel&quot; that the drug war can still be
won by more arrests<br>
and ever-longer sentences.<br>
Well, I have fought the drug wars, and I am coming out of
retirement to say<br>
that Judge Gray is right. What is wrong with drug law enforcement
is that<br>
it has never worked, and it never will.<br>
In his first term, President Richard Nixon declared war on
illicit drugs,<br>
particularly heroin, and sharply increased drug law enforcement.<br>
He directed Attorney General Richard Kleindeinst to create a new
entity,<br>
patterned on the Organized Crime Strike Forces, named Office for
Drug Abuse<br>
Law Enforcement. The president designated Myles Ambrose, the
heavy-hitter<br>
then in charge of the Bureau of Customs, as ODALE director, with
the twin<br>
titles of special assistant attorney general and special
assistant to the<br>
president. Ambrose thus became the nation's first &quot;drug
czar.&quot;<br>
ODALE greatly supplemented the efforts of existing federal,
state, and<br>
local drug law enforcement agencies so that illicit drug sales
could be<br>
ended once and for all.<br>
Because of my earlier experience as a federal prosecutor, I was
recruited<br>
out of private law practice is ODALE regional director for
California,<br>
Arizona, and Nevada. I established offices at San Francisco, Los
Angeles,<br>
San Diego, and Phoenix (each headed by a tough drug prosecutor),
with a<br>
combined staff of some 150 attorneys, drug agents, and support
personnel.<br>
We decided to test the effectiveness of simultaneously arresting
every drug<br>
seller on the streets of an isolated city, and picked Phoenix for
the<br>
exercise.<br>
Using more &quot;buy money&quot; than Arizona had ever seen
before, we bought into<br>
each street dealer we could find, two or three times each. It
turned out<br>
that Phoenix had 76 drug pushers. In the middle of a week night,
with the<br>
help of state and local police, we arrested all 76 at the same
time.<br>
For a week it was impossible to buy drugs on the streets of
Phoenix. The<br>
single local drug treatment program was swamped. Addicts who
could not get<br>
treatment left town to score elsewhere.<br>
But on the eighth day, new street pushers began to appear in the
city, and<br>
before a month had elapsed, it was business-as-usual. We had
spent tens of<br>
thousands of federal tax dollars, and sent scores of pushers to
prison, but<br>
there was no lasting effect on the availability or price of
illicit drugs.<br>
So, in San Diego, we tried another trick. We in ODALE learned
that<br>
virtually all of the heroin there was being sold by a known gang.
State<br>
and local police had been unable to bust the gang because the
only really<br>
effective investigative tool - a court-ordered wire tap - was
prohibited by<br>
California law.<br>
Because our federal program was not inhibited by state law, our
in-house<br>
lawyers applied for and obtained a federal wire tap order. After
thousands<br>
of employee hours at a command center manned around the clock, we
arrested<br>
all 39 members of the drug gang.<br>
For a week it was impossible to buy heroin on the streets of San
Diego. <br>
But on the eighth day new street pushers began to appear in the
city, and<br>
before a month had elapsed it was business-as-usual.<br>
We had spent hundreds of thousands of federal tax dollars, and we
sent<br>
every one of the 39 pushers to federal prison, but there was no
lasting<br>
effect on the availability of heroin or its price. In one respect
we were<br>
worse off for our success. Before, we knew who was selling, but
afterwards<br>
we had no idea.<br>
The ODALE program did not survive the resignation of its
presidential<br>
creator and patron. But in the 18 months permitted us, my 150
people<br>
identified, investigated, indicted, prosecuted, convicted, and
sent off to<br>
the penitentiary more than 1,100 drug dealers. We led all other
ODALE<br>
regions. We were, as we remain, proud of ourselves.<br>
But in the end, in our territory it was not more difficult or
more<br>
expensive to obtain illegal drugs than it was in the beginning.
We had<br>
failed to solve, or even affect, the &quot;drug problem&quot;
with law enforcement. <br>
If we had been given 10 or 20 times the resources, we still would
have<br>
failed.<br>
I have learned from experience that there is no practical level
of law<br>
enforcement that will prevent people from using the narcotics and
dangerous<br>
drugs they wish to use.<br>
Judge Gray is right. We need to consider alternatives to the
mindless<br>
repetition of useless and expensive drug law enforcement efforts.<br>
I know because I have been there.<br>
