<h2>Ireland's truth-teller silenced<p>
<!-- Font Tag --><FONT SIZE=3>95 CPJ award winner's murder leaves public bereft</FONT></h2>

Certain events in a country&#146;s history mark a national loss of innocence, a brutal public awakening ushered in by an inhumane act. In Ireland, that <!-- Link Tag --><A HREF="http://www.irish-times.com/irish-times/paper/0627/fro1.html">event </A>occurred on June 26.<p>
At a traffic light just outside Dublin, in the middle of the day, two motorcycle gunmen drove up next to Veronica Guerin, Ireland&#146;s leading investigative reporter, and pumped five bullets into her neck and chest, viciously ending her life. <p>
Five or six major Dublin criminals are leading suspects in the murder, but Irish police are gathering information on about 150 of the city&#146;s criminals. <p>
The murder left Ireland and the international community outraged. Guerin, a 1995 recipient of CPJ&#146;s International Press Freedom Award, was one of the first reporters to make public the workings of Ireland&#146;s criminal underworld. <p>
Since 1994, several attempts had been made to silence Guerin. Frequently threatened with death, she was once beaten by a man she sought to interview and shot by another in her home. But after each incident, she reaffirmed her commitment to her work. &#147In deciding to continue . . .  <!-- Link Tag --><A HREF="http://www.irish-times.com/irish-times/paper/0627/hom25.html">I am simply doing my job</A>,&#148; she told her readers. &#147I am letting the public know exactly how this society operates.&#148;
Her murder, like her expos&eacute;s, let the public know just that. <p>
Guerin leaves behind her husband, Graham, and a 6-year-old son, Cathal, without whose support, she had said, her work would not have been possible.<BR>
Though Guerin is one of the few Western European journalists ever to be killed for her reporting, her fate is one<!-- Link Tag --><A HREF="http://www.irish-times.com/irish-times/paper/0628/hom7.html"> shared by many journalists </A>who report on crime in other countries. CPJ has documented that since 1991, at least 37 have been murdered for their reporting on criminal activities ranging from official corruption to drug trafficking.<p>
But in no other country has a journalist&#146;s assassination spawned as much sustained public outrage as Guerin&#146;s. Following is a sampling of the thousands of letters that have been sent to Irish newspapers since June 26:<P>

<!-- List Tag --><UL>
<LI>Today I plant a shrub rose. It is an old-fashioned one with a lovely scent and is called &#147Madame Hardy.&#148; ... It&#146;s in memory of a person who gave her life for me that I could be safe in my home and garden, and free to treasure the life I enjoy and the peace I value. Thank you Veronica.--Jean T. Evers<P>
<LI>
<LI>Veronica Guerin was a patriot in the fullest meaning of the word.    --Mary Rourke<p>
<LI>What a sick, sick world this has turned out to be. Please don&#146;t let her work die with her--what a brave lady she was. It&#146;s like as if someone in my family has been killed.       --Ahearne family<P>
<LI>A brilliant and revealing star of truth is no more, but the indomitable light she turned on what corrupts and desecrates our society survives, even in her death. She has done this state much service in a short life. Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a anam dilis. (May your soul be on the right-hand side of God.)  --Eoin Neeson<P><p>
<LI>We view this assassination as a fundamental attack on the free press which is essential to the democratic process.</A> Journalists will not be intimidated. We hereby commit our news organizations to continue the investigation of the stories which cost Veronica Guerin her life.<p>
