qualified, note the year of contribution. Fees will be calculated on a straight pro-rated basis and charged on the first of the 
month following the deposit.</p>

<p>Yes. Systematic Withdrawals from your RTC SMAART/Maximizer account are processed on the 16th of the month. They 
take 2-3 days to be processed. To set up a Systematic Withdrawal, have your representative send LBS a note stating when 
the SWIPs should begin to take place, the amount of the withdrawal, and the account #. A form is available to have 
Systematic Withdrawals deposited directly into your bank account. </p>
<p><b><u>What is my Anniversary Date?</u></b> </p>
<p>Your Anniversary date is the first of the month following receipt of the contract. </p>
<p><b><u>How would I notify you that I've changed Funds?</u></b> </p>
<p>We need a signed letter or fax notification of any change to your account.</p>
<p><b><u>When are Advisory Fees for Risk Management accounts paid to the representative?</u></b> </p>
<p>Checks are cut on the 15th of the month following receipt of mgmt. fee check or fee liquidation authorization. One check to the 
B/D computed on all payments received in the prior month. It is important to receive fee liquidations before the end of the

<p>Risk Management fees are billed annually in advance. That means that you will receive a bill once a year for the upcoming

that value.</p>
<p>A typical billing cycle looks like this: Your anniversary date is December 1, 1996. We value your account on October 31, and 
mail your bill November 15. The bill is for the period December 1, 1996 through November 30, 1997.</p>
