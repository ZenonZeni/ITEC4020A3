Bay Networks sees big Asian opportunity

from COMPUTERWORLD PHILIPPINES, October 31, 1996

By Alma J. Buelva
CW PHILIPPINES SECTION EDITOR

BALI, Indonesia, Oct. 31 -- Asia appears to be a good test ground
for the new market-oriented business model of Bay Networks, Inc.,
which covers precisely the areas where the major networking
activities in the region are happening.

Top executives of Bay took turns briefing Asian journalists
gathered here early this month on how the company's new Enterprise
Business Unit (EBU), Internet/Telecom and Remote Access Business
Unit (ITBU), and Commercial Business Unit (CBU) are positioned to
lead in these areas. In brief, it's a strategy that focuses on the
price and performance points of Bay's products and the company's
global distribution and customer service programs.

In the Philippines, however, Bay's business will still largely be
carried out by its four resellers: Anixter, Alcatel, Computer N/W,
and Trends and Technologies.

A plan to set up a Philippine office has not materialized, Bay
officials said, because they have not yet found a country manager.

BUSINESS UNITS

Although the bulk of Bay's business continues to come from the
enterprise area, company officials believe the highest growth rate
will take place in its Internet unit, especially in the next 12
months.

"Companies are now starting to build networks that will
accommodate their telecommunications and Internet requirements by
being linked to the backbone of the enterprise networks," said
Gary A. Rogers, Bay's vice president for international sales. "We
did our homework and saw that from this year to 1999 the service
provider market has a growth potential of over 300%."

The EBU is still expected to have the most number of people,
products and sales. Some of its product offerings and customers,
however, are likely to overlap with that of the ITBU. For example,
telecommunication companies which traditionally fall under the
enterprise group, are also now among the customers that ITBU will
be aiming to get.

Intranet requirements of big corporations, however, will be
addressed by EBU, not the ITBU. In fact, according to Bruce Sachs,
executive vice president and general manager of ITBU, about 80% of
the products to be sold by his unit will be developed by the EBU's
research and development team because of the product overlap.

The CBU, on the other hand, which focuses on the SOHO (small
office, home office) market, is in an area which Bay officials
said has a potential growth of 160% over the next three years.
Again, the Internet is seen fueling this growth, with more home
offices hooking up to the Net.

PRODUCTS

Bay officials believe next year's worldwide market for access,
routing, shared media and switching products will grow 50%. In
Asia, they said, the growth will be even sharper, adding that the
market already grew over 100% last year. To date, the global
networking market is estimated to be worth $15.36 billion, and
could rise to $32 billion in 1999.

This year, sales of Bay's switching products, according to Rogers,
have already caught up with its routers and are continuing to
grow. High demand for the company's remote access line is also
expected, given the Internet explosion.

SUPPORT

Bay also realigned its worldwide customer service operation in
line with its new market-focus structure. Lloyd Carney, vice
president of Bay's worldwide customer service said there are
basically three kinds of services: for large resellers with full
infrastructure, for those who need logistic support, and for
consultants with no support infrastructure.

Lloyd expects the service requirements of the CBU to be the
easiest to handle because this segment pushes more low-end
products. On the other hand, he expects both the EBU and the ITBU
to have demanding service requirements because their clientele are
those which have millions at stake when their networks go down.

Bay's global customer service support recently achieved one of its
goals when it was awarded an ISO 9001 certification. Carney
admitted they still have to beat Cisco in the support area, but
also said Cisco gets high ratings because the products it
supported in the past were not that complex.

"Bay's been supporting the heart of the network, and we have a
three- to four-year lead time dealing with complex networks," said
Carney.

In Asia, Bay has support and training centers in Hong Kong, Tokyo,
Singapore, and Sydney.

Meanwhile, Lloyd said Bay also encourages its channel partners
worldwide to be part of the customer support business program.

Cable Television can be backbone for digital services

from COMPUTERWORLD PHILIPPINES, October 31, 1996

By Melba-Jean M. Valdez
CW PHILIPPINES SENIOR WRITER

MANILA, Oct. 31 -- Cable television can be a backbone in a
metropolitan area for a new set of digital services such as
Internet access, telephony, video conferencing, and wireless
networks. This means that via just one cable running into a house,
a family can avail of a range of network services.

During the recently concluded COMDDAP '96 exhibit and convention,
Robbie Villabona, technical operations manager at Sky Internet
said that Sky Cable already has the technology to deliver Internet
to homes over cable. "However, one of our concerns is that we are
not allowed by law to sell this service," he said.

Villabona said a possible set-up is that Sky Cable may lease out
bandwidth to franchise holders such as Globe Telecom and BayanTel
or value-added network providers. Apart from this obstacle,
Villabona also pointed to other important issues that still need
to be addressed worldwide. At present, for instance, there is no
standard for data transmission over cable television, he said.
Interoperability is also a problem, since a manufacturer's cable
modem may not be able to communicate with another manufacturer's
cable modem. Modulation and transmission techniques also need to
be addressed by manufacturers, Villabona said. Another issue is
the quality of service. Villabona noted that it isn't possible,
for instance, to commit bandwidth over cable. On the bright side,
Villabona said, a consortium of cable companies in the US called
CabeLab is now defining standards, such as an interface between a
cable modem and a PC.

"A lot of activity is going on between vendors and cable
television operators to deliver digital services to the home,"
said Villabona.

A major benefit of using cable for the Internet, he said, is
speed.

"One of the common complaints by Internet subscribers today is the
speed by which they can access a Web site," said Villabona. He
said that with cable, downloading 1MB file from the Internet using
a cable modem at a burst of 4Mbps would only take two seconds.
Another advantage is that cable can be split when it gets into a
home, making it possible to connect a TV to television
programming, and a PC and modem to the Internet. Villabona said.

Philippines: Gov't awarded NCR a project worth P108M

from COMPUTERWORLD PHILIPPINES, October 31, 1996

By Melba-Jean M. Valdez
CW PHILIPPINES SENIOR WRITER

MANILA, Oct. 31 -- The government has awarded the National Crime
Information System (NCIS) project, a computer-based network system
that aims to modernize the country's judicial process, to NCR
Philippines, Inc.

NCR, which bid P108 million (about $4.1 million), bested three
other IT vendors for the project, and will set up a client-server
based system with four multiprocessing servers, 99 departmental
servers, and hundreds of Pentium-based workstations, all connected
on a Windows NT network.

The NCIS was established through Executive Order No. 386, which
provides for mechanisms necessary to develop a computer-based
system involving the five pillars of the Philippine Criminal
Justice System (PCJS).

Colonel Tirso L. Rosal, head of the Philippine National Police
(PNP) computer center and vice-chairman of the NCIS technical
committee, said the five-phase project has an approved budget of
P108 million for phase one alone.

"NCR was selected based on the technical and financial proposals
they submitted," said Rosal.

EVALUATION

The bidding process formally started in January this year upon the
publication of an invitation to prequalify and to bid.

Commissioner Alexis Canonizado of the National Police Commission
(Napolcom) and chairman of the NCIS prequalification, bids and
awards committee for information technology resources (PBAC-ITR)
said 38 vendors expressed interest in the project, but only 24
actually submitted prequalification documents.

After screening the documents, the number of qualified proponents
was reduced to 10. Canonizado said that upon requests from the
proponents, the submission of the bid proposals (technical and
financial), originally set for May 27, was rescheduled to July 29.
Canonizado said only four of the 10 qualified proponents were able
to submit their proposals within the deadline set by the PBAC-ITR.

"Prior to this, and due to the controversies generated by the
Topweb scam, the NCIS project and bidding process was presented to
the Padolina commission tasked to review and investigate the
bidding rules and procedures followed in large-scale information
technology projects such as the NCIS, pursuant to Section 3.1 of
Executive Order No. 341," said Canonizado.

Canonizado further said that on Sept. 10, members of the technical
evaluation subcommittee (TES) started the technical evaluation of
those complying with the minimum requirements set by the PBAC-ITR.

He said the evaluation results showed that Prime Systems Plus,
Inc. (PSPI) and NCR garnered weighted scores of 49.49 and 54.65,
respectively. He said the sealed financial proposals of both
vendors were opened on Sept. 20.

On Oct. 4, the TES submitted the results of the integrated
technical and financial evaluation to the PBAC-ITR. The results
showed PSPI and NCR garnering weighted scores of 40.00 and 39.97,
respectively.

"Combining the technical and financial scores to come up with the
integrated score, NCR, with 94.62% was adjudged the winner over
PSPI, with an integrated score of 89.49%," said Canonizado.

FIVE PILLARS

The PCJS is composed of the various organizational units within
each of the following five pillars:

1. Law enforcement: the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI),
Napolcom, and the Philippine National Police (PNP)

2. Prosecution: the National Prosecution Service (NAPROS), the
Ombudsman, and the Tanodbayan

3. Adjudication: the Supreme Court of the Philippines (SCP), the
Court of Appeals (CA), regional trial courts, and the municipal or
metropolitan trial courts, and the Sandiganbayan

4. Rehabilitation: the Bureau of Correction, Bureau of Jail
Management and Penology, the Parole and Probation Administration
(PPA), and the Bureau of Pardons and Parole

5. Community: the Department of Social Welfare and Development
(DSWD), and the Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG)
All the units will eventually be linked to each other, with the
Napolcom acting as system administrator.

CLIENT-SERVER SYSTEM

The NCIS will be an intranet type of wide-area network running
under a client-server environment.

Red Torres, account manager for government accounts at NCR said
they chose Magic Rapid Application Development (RAD) system as the
tool to develop the NCIS application. The NCIS system will also
consist of Windows NT as the network operating system and
Microsoft SQL Server as the database management system.

Torres said hardware will include four NCR S40 multiprocessing
servers and 99 NCR S10 servers, which will be deployed among the
various organizational units of the five pillars.

Three hundred NCR 3349 Pentium-based workstations will also be
distributed among the units.

Cora Pinoy, general manager of Magic Software Philippines, Inc.,
said the National Crime Reporting System (NCRS) will basically
allow law enforcers to capture incident reports at police station
level through a graphical-user interface (GUI) application.

The system will also allow the police to make online inquiries on
criminals, vehicles, firearms and more.

Pinoy said the system will also be capable of generating incident
statistics in text or graphical format.

Fingerprinting and a geographical information system (GIS) will
also be incorporated in the system in later phases.

Another feature of the NCIS is the Weblink, a facility that will
enable the five pillars of the criminal justice system to exchange
and share crime information via an intranet.

"Any agency needing information can send its query to the web
server and the web server will decide which organization's
database to retrieve the data from," said Pinoy. Pinoy said each
organization's database will be updated in real time to provide
up-to-date information for better decision-making.

The NCIS is a five-phase project that has an indefinite time
period. Development of a database system and implementation of a
pilot network within Metro Manila is expected to be achieved in
the first phase. Phase two involves nationwide connectivity.

System upgrades and enhancements will be done in the remaining
phases.

Philippines: NEDA chief supports massive IT build-up

from COMPUTERWORLD PHILIPPINES, October 31, 1996

By Melba-Jean M. Valdez
CW PHILIPPINES SENIOR WRITER

MANILA, Oct. 31 -- To gain economic tiger status, the government
and private sector needs to allot bigger budgets to acquire and
implement information technology (IT) resources in the coming
years. Speaking during the Internet World '96 earlier this month,
Secretary of Socioeconomic Planning and Director-General at the
National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) Cielito F.
Habito said the Philippines was ranked number two in computer
usage among Asian countries in the 1970s. "[The country's
leadership] slipped away due to missteps in economic policy
management, which led to a prolonged economic slump," Habito said.

Habito, who is also the co-chairman of the National Information
Technology Council (NITC), said that while there are over 150
information technology (IT) training centers in the country today,
IT development still remains inadequate. He said the country's
computer-to-person ratio is at 1:50 compared to the ratio in other
ASEAN countries which stands at 1:10.

This state of affairs he attributed to the government's low budget
allocation for IT. For instance, he said, in 1988, government
spending on IT represented only .42% of the national budget. In
1991, this inched up to .63%.

Past administrations, Habito added, had not fully appreciated the
benefits that can be derived from using IT.

Despite all this, Habito said, the improved economic environment
in the 1990s brought about a wider use of IT, particularly in view
of decreased computer costs. The government as well as educational
institutions have increased their acquisition and use of
computers, Habito added.

Unlike previous administrations, Habito said, the Ramos government
is implementing vital policies and programs that will help propel
IT development in the country.

He also noted that the deregulation of the telecommunications
industry is of strategic importance to the information
superhighway.

POLICY REFORMS

In an interview with `Computerworld Philippines,' Habito said the
NITC is looking into mechanisms to achieve interoperability among
government agencies -- which includes review and improvement of IT
policies such as the National Information Technology Plan (NITP)
2000.

"The IT sector is moving very rapidly. So similarly we have to be
able to adjust the plan," he said. "We have to reexamine the
specific components of the overall government computerization
programs."

Habito couldn't pinpoint which components of the NITP need
refinement. "I can't really be specific at this point, but among
other things we have to look into is the compatibility of the
various systems being put in place."

He said that while it is necessary to link agencies, there may be
some problems later in trying to interconnect all of them.

"In the end, what we really want is to have a government that is
getting the full benefits of IT," Habito said.

Habito told Computerworld the NITC is working closely with the
private sector and the Government Organization for Information
Technology (GO-IT) to achieve interoperability among the agencies.
"Of course, there is a lot of technology involved. It is more of
coordination and enhancement to make sure that all the systems can
talk to each other," he said.

Netscape confident about browser standing

from COMPUTERWORLD PHILIPPINES, October 31, 1996

By Reynard I. Juanir
CW PHILIPPINES STAFF WRITER

MANILA, Oct. 31 -- NETSCAPE Communications Corp. is still very
confident of keeping its lead in the browser arena despite the
growing popularity of Microsoft Internet Explorer 3.0.

At a press conference organized by Netscape's local distributor,
Client Server Technologies Inc., Netscape regional manager for
ASEAN/South Asia region Casey Ong said that the company's market
share for browsers is still between 70% and 80%. "I don't have
the exact figures, but we're still the leader when it comes to the
browser market."

Ong expressed his doubts over Microsoft's strategy of integrating
the browser into future versions of the Windows 95 client
operating system. "I think this is a very marginal comparison,"
said Ong. "Even if you have better integration with the desktop,
the question is, is the integration with other servers and other
machines better?"

Netscape has for a long time positioned itself in the area of
providing applications and tools for both Internet and intranets.
Ong said the only way for the Internet to go beyond the levels of
use today is through the network computer, not the PC. "If you
think about it," said Ong, "the cost of PCs is still very high...
its not so personal as a `personal computer'. It's not so far-
off in the future that the whole thing about Windows is going to
be irrelevant."

He said the market in Asia is much more suitable to Network
Computers than in the Western countries. "I think in Asia,
Network Computer has an even stronger proposition. We're not like
the US, where the use of PCs has got a much stronger
background....so probably this is even more timely and better for
the Asian users." Ong said he sees the Philippines as more than a
market, but as a source for IT talent. He declined to be more
specific, however, about his company's plans for tapping this
talent.

Netscape's failure to be at the "Browser Brawl" opposite Microsoft
at Internet World Philippines produced some fairly negative
reactions against Netscape, but Ong said it's simply a matter of
scheduling problems.

Philippines: Laissez-faire policy fuels internet growth

from COMPUTERWORLD PHILIPPINES, October 31, 1996

By Melba-Jean M. Valdez
CW PHILIPPINES SENIOR WRITER

MANILA, Oct. 31 -- Private investments and the government's
laissez-faire approach have produced one of the region's most
vibrant markets for Internet services.

This was the assessment offered by Jim Ayson, president of W3
Business Communications, Inc., an Internet presence provider that
designs and maintains Web sites for a number of corporate clients.

Speaking at last month's Internet World, Ayson said the non-
intervention of government has created the freest Internet
environment in Asia. Unlike Singapore, China, and Vietnam, he
said, there is no Internet regulation in the Philippines.

On the other hand, Ayson said, the heavy competition means
Internet service providers need to be more aggressive to get a
share of the business. Already, he noted, ISPs have turned to
advertising and promotions aimed at a growing consumer market for
their services.

Also as a result of competition, Ayson said, he expects exciting
new Internet services to come from big players such as Infocom,
which is partly owned by the Philippine Long Distance Telephone
Co.

Ayson added that small Internet service providers might have to
evolve into niche players and serve specific players to survive.

Ayson said the increased popularity of the World Wide Web and
other Internet applications have also increased the demand for
bandwidth. Thus, ISPs are planning to expand their existing
bandwidth. Links provided today by ISPs range from 64Kbps to T1
and E1.

Another exciting area is the prospect of cable companies offering
Internet access through cable modems. Ayson said that a cable
company called TimeNet, a joint venture between Nortel and the
Lopez group of companies, has announced plans to launch an
experimental project in Naga City, which will consist of 100 beta
test users.

PHONE LINES

On the negative side, Ayson said the market could grow even more
if more telephone lines were available and if interconnection
among ISPs and telecommunication companies were not a problem.

"The biggest obstacle to the growth of the Internet in the
Philippines is the poor telephone infrastructure," said Ayson.
"You obviously can't get to the 'Net if you can't get a dial-
tone."

Ayson said that ISPs have complained that PLDT can't provide
enough lines and have turned to new telecommunication companies
such as Bayantel and Globe. "But the new telecommunication
companies are in turn hampered by interconnection problems with
PLDT," Ayson said.

Another issue is the slow access to local Web sites due to the
lack of interconnection among ISPs. He said that all inbound
traffic must still be routed to the US first, before bouncing back
into the country.

"There is an ongoing project by PLDT with the help of some PISO
(Philippine Internet Service Organization) members to develop a
local network access so that Philippine traffic remains inbound,"
said Ayson.

In his talk, Ayson also traced the birth of the Internet in the
Philippines to 10:18 a.m. on March 29, 1994, when PhilNet, an
academic and research network funded by the Department of Science
and Technology, connected to the Internet through a 64Kbps leased
line to the US.

However, Ayson said, even before this hook-up, several electronic
bulletin boards had already provided an interface to the Internet.
He said that in 1991 an E-mail gateway to the Internet was
established.

Shortly after the PhilNet hookup, the first commercial Internet
service provider, Mosaic Communications, entered the market.
"Initially, PHnet and Moscom operated in grey legal area because
of a perceived need of franchising," said Ayson.

However, the Public Telecom Act passed in 1995 stipulated that
network companies could operate without a congressional franchise,
thereby starting a gold rush. "The effect of RA 7925 was the
commercial Internet area became fair game," said Ayson. Ayson said
that in June 1995, ISPs started pouring in. A series of commercial
online service providers also entered the market and evolved into
ISPs later.

Today, the number of Internet service providers in the country
stands at about 68. Ayson said that there is no formal market
study on the number of Internet users today, but informed
estimates range from 30,000 to 45,000 users.

Ayson said the players in the Internet industry can be classified
as one or more of the following: Internet service providers; E-
mail only providers; ISP networks that don't sell directly to the
end-user but to ISPs; cybercafes; Internet presence providers; and
educational institutions that provide accounts to the public.

Philips sees 15" monitors moving to mainstream

from COMPUTERWORLD PHILIPPINES, October 31, 1996

By Wong, Chin Wah
CW PHILIPPINES EDITOR

MANILA, Oct. 31 -- Eyestrain may no longer be a common problem as
larger screens and better resolution make it to mainstream
computer monitors. This was the view of an official from Philips,
one of the world's largest manufacturers of PC monitors.

"The trend is toward bigger monitors, and the move from 14" to 15"
is very clear," said Louis van Uden, regional marketing manager
for monitors at Philips Business Electronics.

Van Uden said, the 17-inch segment of the market is also growing
rapidly.

Speaking at a recent international convention for Philips PC
resellers in Cebu, Van Uden said multimedia and windowing
applications are driving the monitor market towards bigger format
screens. Fourteen-inch monitors, which accounted for more than
50% of the market in 1995, will represent only a quarter of all
monitors sold by the year 2000, Van Uden predicted. In the same
period, 15-inch monitors, which accounted for about 30% in 1995,
will become the dominant screen size. At the same time, he said,
available resolutions will become higher, as will screen refresh
rates.

Other trends, he sees are:

* The adoption of PC manufacturers of the Universal Serial Bus;
* The increasing use of software-based monitor controls; and
* The increasing acceptance of environmental measures to allow
recycling and lower energy consumption.

Philippine 3Com office expanding

from COMPUTERWORLD PHILIPPINES, October 31, 1996

By Alma J. Buelva
CW PHILIPPINES SECTION EDITOR

MANILA, Oct. 31 -- 3COM Philippines is in expansion mode this
quarter. As the latest office of the networking giant in the
region, it's now out to recruit more personnel and at least 20
resellers in the next two months to boost its market coverage.

"We need more hands and legs on the ground," said Gil G. Edeza,
3Com Philippines country manager. "We're in the market for
additional staff and resellers to carry our products."

Adding energy to the office's full-swing operation is the
nomination, for the first time in 3Com's history, of two
Philippine-based companies as beta sites for 3Com's upcoming token
ring and Ethernet switches. Edeza declined to give the names of
the companies.

"We already have the products in the country. It's just a matter
of delivering them to the beta sites. It would depend on our
customers how long they will perform the tests. 3Com wants to try
the products in various parts of the world," said Edeza.

But unlike Bay and Cisco, 3Com has not come up with a division to
focus solely on the Internet and the requirements of service
providers. However, Edeza said they have plans to start a
Philippine program that involves financing packages especially
designed for for start-up ISPs who may not have the resources to
buy routing and networking equipment outright. He said the program
would allow the ISPs to grow their operations and become viable
before paying for their equipment.

In addition, 3Com Philippines is expected to move to a new office
soon.

NEW PRODUCT

3Com also released this month its third generation of stackable
Ethernet hubs packed with features to handle network segmentation,
management and redundancy.

Wei-Ping Ong, 3Com's South Asia channel development manager, said
the SuperStack II is the industry's most advanced stackable
Ethernet hub for workgroups of all sizes.

The new product introduces a number of technology innovations
previously unavailable in a stackable system, such as port
switching, fully integrated graphics-based network management, hot
swappability and uninterrupted power supply.

The new SuperStack II is available in 12-port and 24-port variants
and 10 hubs that can be stacked together in any combination, said
Ong. All hubs have slots for two transceiver interface modules,

Philippines: Bills seek to establish better IT environment

from COMPUTERWORLD PHILIPPINES, October 31, 1996

CW PHILIPPINES EDITOR

MANILA, Oct. 31 -- Congress is considering a bill to establish an
IT Academy that will update government executives and personnel on
the latest trends in IT, and help them use technology more
effectively in their offices.

The bill, said Congressman Leandro Verceles Jr. of Catanduanes, is
part of a package of measures aimed at creating an IT environment
where computers will be more widely used as critical development
tools.

Speaking at the opening of the COMDDAP Expo '96 earlier this
month, Verceles also said the House of Representatives is looking
at a bill that will set aside 1% of the gross national product for
research and development. It would funnel about P17 billion
annually into R&D projects, making such efforts a cornerstone of
economic development.

Another measure also being considered would establish a computer
center in all state colleges nationwide. All these, Verceles said,
are bills of first impression that will contribute to building an
IT environment.

In his opening remarks, Verceles also gave importance to the
Telecommunications Act of 1995, which paved the way for the
deregulation of value-added network services such as Internet
access. He also reiterated his support for a central exchange that
will link all local Internet service providers (see CW, Aug. 31,
1996).

These developments, he said, run parallel to the government's
service area scheme, where telecommunication firms are required to
set up land lines in their respective service areas.

"As the telecom facilities are put into place, you will see the
emergence of a market for more IT services [in areas outside Metro
Manila]," Verceles said.

He noted, for instance, that his home province of Catanduanes will
soon be connected to the Internet via a 64K connection, with local
government offices getting free access.

"This shows that the Internet doesn't need to be limited to urban
areas, but can reach rural areas as well," Verceles said.

In reply to E-mailed questions about the House bills, Verceles
said the IT Academy would probably have similar directions as the
Development Academy of the Philippines (DAP), which teaches
government policy to public officials.

The IT Academy, he said, would "impress upon public officials and
personnel" information about global trends in IT to enable them to
maximize its use as a critical development tool.

"Right now government officials do not know the critical need for
IT as a development tool," Verceles said. "They must be taught.
Information officers in government also are not kept abreast of
new technologies. This affects the planning of IT and development
of systems in their offices. An academy is needed to assist the
government in their IT planning," he added.

Verceles said it isn't clear yet how much funding would be needed
for the academy, but said this could come from government savings
or the Office of the President, then later on be an integral
annual cost item under the General Appropriations Act.

It would probably be run under a policy-making board composed of
the National Computer Center, the Department of Transportation and
Communication, the Department of Science and Technology, the
National Economic and Development Authority, the National Security
Council, and the National Information Technology Council
