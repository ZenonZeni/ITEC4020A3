The yield on long-term U.S. Treasury bonds has increased by nearly 40 basis points since early January despite Fed easing and continued evidence of sluggish economic growth in the United States. <B>The steepening of the yield curve reflects a variety of economic and political developments.</B> Retailers have reported a stronger tone to consumer spending since January and thus the risk of the fourth quarter slowdown evolving into a recession has been greatly reduced. The weakness of Senator Robert Dole in the early primaries has lowered the odds of any new breakthrough in the budget talks in Washington while the success of Patrick Buchanan has provoked new anxieties about the ability of the Republicans to retain their congressional majorities in this autumn's election. The yen has rallied sharply because of Japanese corporations repatriating capital at the end of the March fiscal year and increasing evidence that the Japanese economy has stabilized. While the European economy is clearly weak, German investors are demanding increased yield premiums to compensate for the risk that Chancellor Kohl and President Chirac will pursue monetary union despite the failure of both countries to achieve the Maastricht targets for reduction of their government deficits. <B>The only clearly positive news for the bond market during the past week was the decision of President Clinton to re-appoint Alan Greenspan as Fed Chairman as well as to fill the existing vacancies with competent and credible economists widely perceived to have mainstream views about the role of the Federal Reserve in economic policy.</B>
<P>



The failure of the White House and Congress to agree on a fiscal package has been a major disappointment to investors because in the autumn of 1995 there appeared to be an unprecedented opportunity for long-term deficit reduction through cuts in Medicare entitlement programs. If the Republicans retain control of Congress, there will be a second opportunity to pursue some form of deficit reduction in 1997 but forecasts about next year's fiscal policy are speculative at best. The most popular Republican presidential candidates so far have been Steve Forbes and Patrick Buchanan, neither of whom has stressed balancing the budget as a policy priority. Ironically, if they force the Republican Party to adopt a more populist fiscal policy of tax cuts and increased federal spending to promote job security, President Clinton could emerge as the champion of fiscal conservatism this autumn. <B>The primary consolation for the bond market from this year's budget gridlock is that the Republicans will probably be able to impose $10-15 billion of targeted spending cuts in the continuing resolutions still moving through Congress and thus lower the fiscal 1996 deficit to $120-130 billion.</B>
<P>



While investors have long been apprehensive about the ability of a man as old as Senator Robert Dole to be an effective presidential candidate, the fragmentation of the Republican Party in the early primary elections has still come as a shock to the financial markets. It creates several potential risks. First, the Republican Party could become so badly divided that it will lose control of the Congress this autumn, not just the opportunity to regain the White House. Secondly, the issue of deficit reduction has faded completely from the political debate because of the popularity of Steve Forbes and Patrick Buchanan. Forbes is running on Reaganite themes, such as cutting taxes, while Buchanan is campaigning against free trade and an unregulated labor market. The candidate most closely identified with the Congressional Contract with America, Senator Phil Gramm, was the first to drop out. Thirdly, investors are apprehensive that Buchanan's successes will encourage other candidates to move in a populist direction by advocating more restrictive trade policies or large increases in marginal income tax rates to punish highly paid executives responsible for job shedding at large corporations. Senator Robert Dole has some advisors sympathetic to Buchanan's positions on trade and they have already encouraged him to make speeches attacking the American corporate sector. <B>If the Democrats were to regain control of the House, Rep. Richard Gephardt would become the House speaker and probably use his new position to develop a Democratic version of the Buchanan agenda for his own presidential campaign in 2000.</B>
<P>



Patrick Buchanan is such a divisive candidate that it will be impossible for him to win the Republican nomination, but his primary victories are exposing the social contradictions in America's recent economic performance and thus provoking a debate about income distribution, corporate responsibility, and other issues which the Republicans are often uncomfortable discussing.
<P>



<B>The U.S. economy has significantly out-performed all other industrial countries in job creation since the 1970's.</B> During the past sixteen years, the U.S. economy has created 28 million new jobs and reduced its unemployment rate to 5.7% while the unemployment rate in many European countries is twice as high. The ratio of long-term unemployed (unemployed longer than one year) to total unemployment is also only 12% in the U.S. compared to 40% in Germany and 35% in France. During the half century since the end of the Second World War, the U.S. economy has produced an expansion of private affluence on a scale unprecented since the industrial revolution began. In 1950, fewer than one million Americans earned as much as $60,000 in today's money. By 1967, slightly more than one million Americans had incomes of $100,000 per annum on the basis of 1993 constant dollars. Despite the volatile business cycles of the 1970's and early 1980's, this number expanded to 2.7 million by 1980 and to 5.6 million by 1993. In fact, over one million Americans had incomes above $200,000 per annum by 1993. <B>But the price of this flexibility has been an increase in job insecurity and erosion in the real wages of less skilled workers since the 1970's.</B> 
<P>



The U.S. economy has out-performed all other industrial countries in job creation during recent years because it enjoys far more price and regulatory flexibility in its labor market than other countries. Almost 20 million Americans change their job every year and even during the recession of the early 1990's only about 3 million did so because of employment termination. American firms are far more willing to hire than European firms because the cost of layoffs is much lower than in Europe.
<P>



According to a recent research report from the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, the duration of jobs for most categories of American workers has been remarkably stable since 1973. But there has been a major increase in the rate of permanent dismissals at companies compared to temporary layoffs. In the 1960's, permanent dismissals accounted for only about 30-35% of new unemployment compared to 40-45% in 1993. The share of temporary layoffs, by contrast, has declined from just over 20% to about 17%.
<P>



<B>Job insecurity has been an especially striking feature of employment at the large Fortune 500 companies which were once considered to be the country's most stable employers.</B> Since 1979, their total employment has declined from 16.5 million jobs to 11.5 million jobs, with most of the job losses occurring in the U.S. itself. The growth of small and medium sized firms has provided many alternative forms of employment but some workers have had to accept lower pay when making such transitions. Start-up firms have much higher failure rates than old established companies and thus contribute to the sense of insecurity among people leaving job at large firms.
<P>



Patrick Buchanan alleges that U.S. firms have been transferring jobs to foreign countries in pursuit of lower wages but employment data for U.S. multinationals suggests that the technological factors which have forced cuts in U.S. manufacturing employment have been operative in other countries as well. <B>Between 1979 and 1989, American firms reduced their employment of foreign production workers by 2.3 million jobs while creating 1.2 million new jobs in non-production departments, such as marketing and distribution.</B> The expansion of U.S. companies in foreign markets is making them more formidable global competitors and thus boosting U.S. exports. It is not merely transferring jobs between countries on a zero sum basis.
<P>



<B>The introduction of new and more sophisticated forms of technology into the workplace has also produced greater income inequality based on education.</B> Since 1979, the real wages of high school graduates have fallen by 21% while the earnings of people with advanced technical degrees have often increased significantly. Firms also have tried to help their employers avoid high effective marginal tax rates by expanding benefits more aggressively than wage and salary income. During the past fifteen years, the government's employment cost index has increased by about 22.0% in real terms while real average hourly earnings have fallen by 8%. The biggest gains in employment costs were concentrated in benefits (up 38% in real terms), not take-home pay. Benefits have expanded from 16% of compensation in the early 1980's to over 18.0% today. As a result, workers which are employed by small firms without non-taxable benefit packages have suffered a much greater erosion of real income than people employed by firms with health care, pensions, and other non-taxable forms of compensation.
