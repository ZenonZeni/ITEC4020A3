Regarding Participation in<br>
l-Deprenyl Clinical Trials </h2>
<hr>
<p><b>Q: I might be interested in participating in a clinical
trial as an investigator - how do I proceed?</b> </p>
<p><b>A: </b>Read all the information concerning clinical trials.
Contact DAHI personnel at 1-(800) 520-2120 or (913) 338-2120. If
you wish to discuss a particular patient for potential
enrollment, please have the patient file available at the time of
the call. </p>
<p><b>Q: What is the authorization for this study?</b> </p>
<p><b>A: </b>DAHI has been granted an INAD (Investigational New
Animal Drug) exemption #8008 by the FDA's Center for Veterinary
Medicine (CVM) to conduct clinical trials with l-deprenyl in
dogs. These studies will be conducted in accord with all
applicable regulations and guidelines. Data will be submitted to
the FDA in support of an application for approval to market
l-deprenyl for use in dogs. The drug has been approved for market
in Canada by the Canadian Bureau of Veterinary Drugs, for a
distinct use, treatment of canine pituitary dependent
hyperadrenocorticism (PDH, Cushing's disease). </p>
<p><b>Q: What is known about the safety of l-deprenyl in general,
and specifically in dogs?</b> </p>
<p><b>A:</b> As is true of all drugs not yet FDA-approved for use
in the United States, by definition l-deprenyl's &quot;safety and
efficacy have not been established.&quot; This is precisely the
purpose of our clinical trials. As noted above, l-deprenyl has
been approved for use in dogs by Canadian authorities. The safety
of l-deprenyl in dogs has been addressed in laboratory dogs in
several safety studies conducted by independent contract
laboratories, and in each case the conclusion was that l-deprenyl
was safe. More than two hundred pet dogs with either senility
(cognitive dysfunction) or pituitary dependent
hyperadrenocorticism (PDH, Cushing's disease) received l-deprenyl
at doses equal to or greater than those to be used in this trial,
and were monitored for periods from a few days to more than 3
years. No serious adverse events thought to be l-deprenyl related
were reported. There are occasional reports of dogs exhibiting
vomiting, diarrhea, increased activity, or repetitive behaviors,
which generally were mild and resolved with dose adjustment or
discontinuation. </p>
<p><b>Q: How might my clients and their pets benefit by
participating in a clinical trial?</b> </p>
<p><b>A:</b> First, l-deprenyl may help their pet, although we
cannot and do not make guarantees to any pet owner. Second, the
pet may benefit as a result of the additional examinations and
laboratory evaluations which it receives. Third, society in
general may benefit from the knowledge we gain by conducting the
study. </p>
<p><b>Q: How might I benefit from participating as an
investigator in a clinical trial?</b> </p>
<p><b>A: </b>First, personal satisfaction. Second, intellectual
stimulation. Third, reimbursement for your services, according to
a pre-agreed arrangement. Numerous veterinarians who have
participated as clinical trial investigators have stated they
found it a rewarding experience which nevertheless was associated
with a considerable amount of time and effort, primarily with
respect to completing the paperwork and complying with the
various FDA stipulations. DAHI will work closely with you to
maximize efficiency and minimize effort. </p>
<p><b>Q: Who pays for what?</b> </p>
<p><b>A: </b>There are no costs during <b>pre-enrollment</b>.
Once you have discussed the potential candidate with DAHI
personnel and approval has been obtained for the enrollment
work-up, DAHI will pay for the <b>enrollment examination</b> and <b>re-examinations </b>,
the drug, and laboratory tests directly associated with
monitoring response to treatment. DAHI is NOT responsible for
diagnosis or treatment of concurrent conditions or problems not
related to l-deprenyl therapy; these responsibilities will be
assumed by the owner. </p>

<h2 align="center"><a name="Background">Background Information</a>
and Trial Purpose</h2>
<h3 align="center">Trial - CD/HT</h3>
<hr>
<p>Canine Cognitive Dysfunction (CD) is a syndrome encountered in
pet dogs which is recognized by many veterinarians and pet owners
and has been reported in dogs in a number of veterinary and
research journals*. The syndrome or its clinical signs have been
alluded to under a variety of terms. Owners of affected dogs
often describe these signs as &quot;old age&quot; or
&quot;senility&quot;, but it is quite likely that in dogs, as in
people, these problems result form brain pathology*. Canine CD is
characterized by one or more clinical signs such as;
inappropriate urine elimination, confusion, disorientation,
decreased activity, changes in the wake/sleep cycle or signs
which suggest a decrease in the dog's interest in, or ability to
interact with, its environment.</p>
<p>The etiology of canine CD has not been identified. However, in
people with Cognitive Dysfunction there is usually an associated
neuronal degenerative process present such as Alzheimer's
disease, neuronal degeneration secondary to hypoxia
(multi-infarct dementia) or toxicity (ethanol, MPTP).
Inappropriate urine elimination (IUE) is one of the clinical
disorders in people suffering from dementia (e.g., severe
cognitive dysfunction) and is often referred to by physicians as
&quot;central incontinence&quot; to denote that the problem is
one of cognition and to distinguish it from pathology in lower
neural centers and/or the urinary tract. Several reports have
identified neurodegenerative lesions in the brains of aged dogs
similar to those present in human Alzheimer's patients. There
have been several articles in the medical literature, some of
them reports of placebo controlled blinded studies which document
that Alzheimer's patients improve when given l-deprenyl. In
laboratory experiments, elderly rats perform more poorly on
cognitive tests than young rats and l-deprenyl helps to normalize
the performance of these older rats. A small placebo controlled
study of elderly laboratory dogs showed that the dogs with the
poorest baseline performance in cognitive testing benefited the
most from l-deprenyl treatment. A second study also found
l-deprenyl helpful for laboratory dogs with poor baseline
cognitive performance.</p>
<p>Our current trial, CD/HT, is a 2 phase randomized placebo
controlled, double-blinded pivotal clinical trial. The purpose of
this trial is to evaluate the response of affected dogs to
l-deprenyl therapy using several parameters, and to assess the
efficacy and safety of l-deprenyl for treatment of acquired
cognitive dysfunction in dogs. </p>
<p>In the first treatment phase (weeks 1-4), each qualified dog
will be randomly assigned to an experimental group and treated
with either l-deprenyl or placebo for 4 weeks in a double-blinded
(masked) fashion and monitored for response. All eligible dogs
that complete the first phase will then be enrolled in the second
treatment phase (weeks 5-12). In the second phase all dogs will
be treated with a standard dose of l-deprenyl for 8 weeks in an
open label fashion and monitored for response.</p>
<p>During a previous CD pilot trial owners of enrolled dogs
reported improvement in all 15 parameters monitored, with
statistical significance attained in 13 of the 15. The
improvement was sustained in most dogs for at least 3 months, and
in some dogs for as long as they have been monitored (9 months). </p>
<p>The primary goal of this trial will be to evaluate the safety
and efficacy of l-deprenyl for the treatment of canine CD.</p>
