<p align="center">... a weekly service for the media on news
items related to Marijuana Prohibition.</p>

<p align="center">April 20, 1995</p>

<p align="center"><b><i>Baltimore Sun</i></b><b>'s Front Page
Afflicted By &quot;Reefer Madness&quot;<br>
DEA Admits Shifting Agents From Cocaine To Marijuana Hunt</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>April 14,</b> <i>The Baltimore Sun</i> in a
lengthy headline story, &quot;Authorities hit the marijuana
trail, Police see resurgence of '60s drug&quot; pushed most of
the DEA's most successful propaganda lines.&nbsp; <i>The Sun</i>,
once the paper of H.L. Mencken, begins by giving the impression
that marijuana law enforcement has flagged during recent
years.&nbsp; Actually, the number of arrests has been increasing and
the 10 millionth marijuana arrest since 1965 will soon take
place. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The article by Marcia Myers also parrots the DEA line that
marijuana is &quot;3 to 5 times stronger than it was 20 years
ago,&quot; although even the head of the National Institute on
Drug Abuse claims only a 3-fold increase and there is little
evidence to support any actual increase.&nbsp; The head of Maryland's
marijuana eradication program is quoted as saying that growers
&quot;have been able to cultivate a crop that will literally
knock your socks off.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In addition to citing this purported epidemic in barefootedness,
the article says that what it calls &quot;marijuana related&quot;
emergency room admissions have tripled in the last four
years.&nbsp; Actually, these numbers represent only emergency
room &quot;mentions&quot; of marijuana, and do not indicate that marijuana
was the cause of the visit.&nbsp; Had the reporter bothered to
check with the primary source on this data, she would have
learned that approximately 80% of such &quot;mentions&quot;
involve people who are actually having problems with other drugs,
but also &quot;mention&quot; having used marijuana. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The article did break new ground in two areas:&nbsp; 1.) It
actually reported that forfeiture encourages police to work on
marijuana cases since the police agencies get to keep the
property they seize.&nbsp; 2.) It also revealed that the
Baltimore office of the DEA has shifted agents away from cocaine
cases to go after marijuana.&nbsp; They call this a &quot;more
balanced approach.&quot;&nbsp; This approach would be more
&quot;balanced&quot; only if one thinks that marijuana is somehow
as much a problem as cocaine, which this article implies.&nbsp;
Perhaps in the future <i>The Sun</i> will take a &quot;more
balanced approach&quot; to journalism and include a few more
facts with its ration of DEA propaganda.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Hair Testing For Marijuana Called
Unreliable, But Proceeds Anyway</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>April 7,</b> In a copyrighted story by C.
Eugene Emery, <i>The Providence Journal</i> reported that even
though the developer of the new hair test for drugs acknowledges
that the test is not a reliable indicator of marijuana use, they
are testing for it anyway. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The test, marketed by Psychemedics of Cambridge, Mass. is
designed to detect trace residues of illicit drugs that may have
been used over the last several months.&nbsp; One advantage of
hair testing over urine testing is that cocaine and heroin are
not detectable in urine after a day or two, while marijuana
metabolites can be detected for weeks.&nbsp; The urine testing
has the effect of encouraging the use of cocaine and other hard
drugs over marijuana.&nbsp; Urine testing is also considered
relatively easy to beat. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In the <i>Providence Journal</i> story J. Michael Walsh of the
National Institute for Standards and Technology and former
executive director of President Reagan's Drug Advisory Council
was very critical of the reliability of hair testing in general,
but especially when used for detecting marijuana.&nbsp; Walsh
told the <i>Providence Journal</i> (which uses the hair test)
that, &quot;It is just inappropriate to deny employment or take
adverse action against an employee on the basis of such a
test.&quot; <br>

Pierre at NORML, (202)483-5500.]</p>

<p align="center"><b><i>National Review</i></b><b> Reports On
Jimmy Montgomery; Paraplegic Now Receiving Better Treatment;
Hopeful Of Release Soon.</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In an editorial in its <b>May 1</b> issue,
William F. Buckley, Jr.'s <i>National Review</i> commented on the case
of Jimmy Montgomery, a paraplegic sentenced to 10 years in
Oklahoma prisons for less than 2 ounces of marijuana.&nbsp; <i>NR</i>
noted that former deputy drug czar John P. Walters criticized ABC News
for reporting on the Montgomery case.&nbsp; Walters showed no
concern for Montgomery but rather complained, &quot;Apparently
ABC couldn't find a grandmother on death row for carrying a roach
clip...&quot;&nbsp; NR observes that &quot;something is seriously
wrong with a drug policy that condones such treatment -- a point
that the drug warriors tacitly acknowledge by changing the
subject.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In the meantime, Montgomery is now receiving proper medical care
and has been moved to another prison facility.&nbsp; It is hoped
that this move is in preparation for his being released to
&quot;house arrest.&quot;&nbsp; Michael Pearson of Oklahoma NORML
reports that the numerous calls received by the Oklahoma
governor's office helped save Jimmy's life.&nbsp; <i><u>NORML
expresses its gratitude to all who called</u></i>.&nbsp; NORML
also expresses its sympathy to the citizens of Oklahoma City for
the tragic deaths in the Federal Building bombing.&nbsp; Hunting
down these cowardly murderers is the proper use for law
enforcement.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Prohibitionists React Hysterically To ABC
News Program Critical Of Drug Prohibition And Condemn &quot;Drug
Legalization In Europe&quot;</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The complaints of John Walters about ABC's
reporting on the Jimmy Montgomery case were in a <i>Washington
Times</i> op-ed article published the day before the ABC program
actually ran.&nbsp; Walters also continued the prohibitionist
practice of claiming that &quot;drug legalization in Europe&quot;
has been a failure.&nbsp; He was later joined in the chorus by A.
M. Rosenthal, former managing editor of <i>The New York Times</i>,
who typically cited Zurich's Needle Park as an example of the
failure of &quot;drug legalization.&quot;&nbsp; None of them
offered any analysis of the Dutch policy of tolerating cannabis sale
in &quot;coffee shops.&quot;&nbsp; Instead they tried to paint
Holland as a violent crime-ridden country.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Long Island Student Suspended Just For
Wanting To Write A Paper On The<br>
Economics Of Hemp</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>April 19,</b> A high school student from Long
Island (NY) called NORML's national office to report that she was
suspended from school briefly for having indicated that she was
going to write her term paper on the economics of hemp.&nbsp; Her
principal relented when she mentioned something about the First
Amendment ... which was also written on hemp (paper).</p>

<p align="center"><b><i>Atlantic Monthly</i></b><b> Work On
Marijuana Prohibition Wins Prestigious</b><br>
<b>&quot;National Magazine Award.&quot;</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The <i>Atlantic Monthly</i>'s two part article (<b>August/September,
1994</b>) on marijuana prohibition by Eric Schlosser won the
National Magazine Award reporting prize.&nbsp; Schlosser wrote
about the extremely high sentences given to people convicted of
marijuana trafficking offenses in contrast to lesser penalties
given to people convicted of violent offenses.&nbsp; <u>NORML
congratulates Schlosser and </u><i><u>The Atlantic</u></i>.</p>
