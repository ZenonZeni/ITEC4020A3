While funded by NSF, ONR and NASA, participated in and Chief Scientist for 
numerous oceanographic expeditions during the 1970's and 1980's International 
Decade of Ocean Exploration (e.g., GEOSECS, NORPAX, etc.) focused on 
understanding the large-scale, low-frequency variability of the oceans and 
air-sea interactions aimed at improving our understanding of the role of the 
oceans in global climate change.  In particular, conducted research about 
mesoscale ocean eddies, El Ni&ntilde;o prediction, regional ocean circulation (Red 
Sea, South Atlantic, SE Asian waters, Hawaiian Islands, equatorial Pacific, 
etc.), and the variability of global ocean topography using altimetry data.  
Published many popular articles, scientific papers and technical reports (see 
attached selected publications) describing mesoscale and large-scale ocean 
circulation utilizing different research techniques.  Presented briefings to 
NASA astronauts on the variety of ocean phenomenon that can be viewed from 
Earth orbit.  Participated in the use of various sea going research equipment 
including traditional hydrographic, biological, and chemical techniques; 
current meters and ARGOS satellite-tracked drifting buoys; and had extensive 
experience analyzing data collected through the use of ships, airplanes, and 
satellites - observing both the oceans and atmosphere. <br>
