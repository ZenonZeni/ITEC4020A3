This guideline regulates the basic items necessary for safety and quality
assurance of the drugs for gene therapy.<BR>
<LI>Definition
</B>
<OL>
<LI>&quot;Gene therapy&quot; means that the genes or the gene transduced cells are administered into humans for the disease treatment etc.  <LI>&quot;Master cell bank&quot; means that after minimum generations of growth of the stock strains for all cell seeds used for production under certain culture conditions, they are divided into the number of ampoules.
<LI>&quot;Working cell bank&quot; means the recombinant cells obtained by pooling one or more cells in the master cell bank are further cultured under the conditions confirmed to be stable, and are divided into the ampoules.
<LI>&quot;Vector&quot; means the transport vehicle used for transducing the objective genes into host cells. In the case of using recombinant viruses, those including the transduced genes are called viral vectors. When the plasmids including the objective genes are directly transduced into cells, the plasmid DNAs are called Vectors. 
<LI>&quot;Viral vector&quot; means the recombinant viruses used as vectors, in which the recombinant viral genomes transduced the objective genes instead of the wild type viral genomes are packaged. 
<LI>&quot;Non-viral vector&quot; means transport vehicles other than viral vectors.
<LI>&quot;Helper&quot; means the viruses or their genes used to complement the creation of viral vectors.
<LI>&quot;Packaging cells&quot; means the cells in which the helper sequences are integrated.
<LI>&quot;Work area&quot; means the area where recombinant objects are directly dealt with and produced.
