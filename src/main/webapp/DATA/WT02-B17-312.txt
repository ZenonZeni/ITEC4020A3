<P>Nuclear power uses the energy trapped in the atoms of heavy elements like uranium.  Splitting these atoms to form lighter elements--a process called fission--causes a release of energy, which is used to boil water into steam.  The steam then spins a turbine, which in turn spins a generator to produce electricity.

In 1994, the 109 operating nuclear power plants in the United States produced about 22% of the nation's electricity--only coal produces more electricity.
<P>Nuclear power plant performance is steadily improving.  In early 1970s, nuclear power plants typically operated at only 50% of their total capacity.  Today they operate at consistently more than 70% of their capacity.
<P>Although no nuclear power plants have been ordered since 1978, many plants that were under construction at that time have been completed and are now operating.  This steadily increased electricity generation by nuclear power and provided electricity to meet increased U.S. power needs.

<P>Nuclear power--unlike fossil fuels--generates no air pollutants, (such as nitrous oxides or sulfur dioxide) or greenhouse gases, so it does not contribute to acid rain, smog, or climate change.
<P>The nuclear and coal power plants that entered service in the last 20 years have cut oil use for electricity production by 1 million barrels per day, helping reduce U.S. dependence on imported oil.

<P>There are several barriers to the expanded use of nuclear power.  Among the leading ones are:
<OL>
<LH></LH>
<LI>Delays in providing for nuclear waste management 
<LI>Economic competitiveness with other fuels
<LI>Public concerns about safety, despite actual safety records
<LI>Investment community concerns about financial risks.
</OL>
<P>Waste management is one of the most difficult problems for nuclear power.  The technology exists for the burial of wastes from nuclear power plants and studies are under way to test the suitability of a potential site for an underground repository.  However, no site has been formally selected, and reaching a final decision requires much more work.
<P>Because of the lack of a permanent waste repository, nuclear plants have stockpiled spent fuel on site in large pools of water.  These pools were only built large enough for temporary storage needs, so many are close to capacity, requiring operators to look for other storage options.

<P>The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is working with the nuclear industry in a cost- shared, cooperative program to develop standardized, certified designs for the next generation of nuclear power plants--advanced light-water reactors.  These new, economic plants, incorporating improved safety features, will be available for electric utility orders about the turn of the century.
<P>DOE is also making major changes in the civilian reactor waste management program to get the program on schedule and avoid further delays.
