<H2>Border Tensions Threaten<BR> Biological Hotspot</H2>

<P>
Washington, DC: With the outbreak of hostilities between Ecuador and Peru in January 1995, the future of the disputed region known as the Cordillera del Condor has been called into question. Straddling the Peruvian-Ecuadorian border where the eastern slopes of the Andes drop into the Amazon Basin, the Condor region is inaccessible and only sparsely populated, and until recent years, its ecosystems were poorly understood by science. Yet recent CI RAP expeditions to the Ecuadorian and Peruvian sides of the Condor have revealed extraordinarily rich biodiversity and unusual ecosystems. And for CI and conservationists in both Ecuador and Peru, establishing conservation areas for the Condor may offer both countries the seeds of a peaceful solution: Parks for Peace (Parques para la paz). 
<P>
Working with indigenous groups, business leaders, development planners, and government representatives from both Peru and Ecuador, CI is preparing a project profile and conservation-area feasibility study, representing the first step toward developing a proposal for a solution. The study will compile important biological data from CI's RAP findings and use them to emphasize the negative consequences of continued war activities for the people of the Condor, their natural resources, and economies. 
<P>
When completed, the study will be submitted to high-level Peruvian and Ecuadorian officials. Under their leadership, this process could ultimately lead to the establishment of a pair of linked conservation areas in the contested border region. 
<P>
"We believe we can advance the conservation-area concept behind the weight of our RAP findings," said Adrian Forsyth, CI's Vice President for Conservation Biology. Recommendations from past RAP expeditions have influenced conservation decisions in countries such as Bolivia, Ecuador, and Guyana. 


<P><H3>Condor RAP Trips' Remarkable Discoveries</H3>
<P>
The Condor RAP trips to Ecuador (1993) and Peru (1994) revealed a very unusual assemblage of vegetation and habitats, some of which had never before been documented. Thanks to the support of the Ecuadorian and Peruvian militaries, RAP scientists were able to reach previously unknown, high-altitude habitats by helicopter. In both Ecuador and Peru, the RAP team discovered habitat similar to that known as "tepui" in Venezuela and Guyana -- open, boggy orchid fields on flat-top mountains not previously recorded in the central Andes. Newly identified species include the largest-known shrew opossum in the world, 20 new orchid species on the Peru side, 6 new butterfly species also in Peru, and 2 new beetles. A species of pygmy owl was recently described and named after the late Ted Parker, who recorded its song in Ecuador in 1993.


<P><A NAME="intel"></A><H3>CI Joins Forces with Intel and UNESCO</H3>

<P>
Washington, DC: A new partnership between CI, Intel Corporation, and the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) will bring cutting-edge computer technology to 25 biosphere reserves in developing countries.
<P>
Under the recently announced agreement, Intel will donate $270,000 for hardware and software purchases, technical support, and training. CI will supply CISIG software, and both CI and UNESCO will provide training through regional workshops. The participating reserves will be selected by the end of 1995.
<P>
"The Intel-CI-UNESCO agreement is an enormous opportunity to strengthen the world's biosphere reserve network," said John Musinsky, CI Natural Resource Specialist. "It will allow for information exchange with access to the Internet, and strengthen the capacity of local institutions to better use conservation analysis tools. This is an important step toward integrating activities among the reserves." 
<P>
 Created by UNESCO in 1976, the 324 biosphere reserves are international protected areas that combine conservation, sustainable natural resource use, and 
scientific research.

<TD valign=top><H3>Rescue Mission for Endangered World Heritage Site</H3>

<P>
Cartagena, Colombia: CI's Colombia and International Communications Programs are planning a nationwide awareness campaign to preserve an area that all Colombians view with pride -- the diverse natural habitats of Cartagena Bay. The campaign, combining creative media techniques and environmental education, is designed to unite Colombians in supporting conservation efforts in Cartagena Bay.
<P>
Located on Colombia's Caribbean coast, Cartagena Bay is a World Heritage Site, containing rich and varied ecosystems -- mangrove forests, coral reefs, freshwater estuaries, and dry forests -- as well as the country's richest historical sites.  But rampant pollution, commercial development, uncontrolled tourism, and population growth threaten to overwhelm what remains of these precious resources.
<P>
Planning for the communications campaign began in May with a creative workshop that brought together a group of 30 key participants, including a former mayor and the city's Secretary of the Environment, and advertising professionals, conservationists, and consultants. 
<P>
Results included the formation of "Cartagena Convida," the group that will guide the campaign and prepare for the official launching in early 1996.	<P>
"Our strategy is to empower the people of Cartagena themselves to provide the creative forces and the scientific information for the campaign," said Wendy Arenas, CI's program coordinator for Cartagena Convida. "Achieving this sense of ownership among the people of Cartagena is a key step toward the success of the campaign and ultimately in changing how Colombians think about their environment."

<H3>12,000 Fact, 80 Maps Focus Priorities for Madagascar</H3>

<P>
Washington, DC: Preliminary results of CI's conservation priority-setting workshop in Madagascar have prompted plans for a major CI RAP expedition in this critically important country.
<P>
"This information will help Madagascar determine its own long-term plan to conserve biodiversity and how to use more than $100 million for on-the-ground projects," said Silvio Olivieri, CI's Vice President for Conservation Planning and Technical Cooperation.
<P>
Some 120 scientists from the world over attended the workshop in April in the nation's capital, Antananarivo. Their data covering every aspect of Madagascar's besieged environment was compiled into databases containing more than 12,000 records and over 80 CISIG maps. Between 12 and 14 new CISIG maps will be created, revealing biodiversity conservation priorities and human disturbance patterns. The final report containing the priority-setting maps will be completed this fall.

<H3>Brazil Nut Cookies Available at
Subway Shops!</H3>

<P><A NAME="cookie"></A>
Subway's new Brazil nut cookie is more than just a cookie -- it's the nationwide restaurant franchise's way of helping to save the rain forests of Peru. Through Subway's purchase of 30,000 pounds of Brazil nuts from CI's project in the community of Puerto Maldonado, Peru, local people have found an economic alternative that makes the forest worth more standing than cut down.
