<p><strong>NEW YORK</strong> - Advance copies of the 21st edition of the
Urban 
League's The State of Black America were made available to 
the press on Nov. 22. In nine essays discussing the 
questions of unemployment and underemployment; infant 
mortality and life expectancy; income, housing and health, 
the report documents its conclusion that the fundamental 
question facing Black America - and millions of other 
Americans - is poverty.</p>

<p>The League has always recognized the centrality of poverty 
as the determining factor in its report and has issued many 
calls for increased job opportunities. But this year there 
is something different: In words that leave no room for 
misunderstanding, Hugh Price, the League's president, calls 
for an urban policy centered on a modern-day Works Progress 
Administration (WPA) to end the "Great Depression in 
America's ghettos. There is nothing un-American about 
spending money to help fill gaping holes in the labor 
market," he writes.</p>

<p>And there are gaping holes:</p>

<p>* Even the understated "official" figures show an 
unemployment rate in the African American community double 
that among non-Hispanic white workers - and that has 
remained at or above 10 percent since the mid-1970s.</p>

<p>* More than 40 percent of African American households in 
metropolitan areas are trapped in what the Census Department 
calls "high poverty neighborhoods."</p>

<p>* One out of every three African Americans live in poverty, 
a rate three times that of whites. Although African 
Americans constitute only 15 percent of the total 
population, they constitute 40 percent of those living in 
poverty.</p>

<p>* In 1984 African American men working full-time year-round 
had incomes averaging less than 75 percent of non-Hispanic 
white men while the average annual earnings of African 
American women fell 15 percent below that of non-Hispanic 
white women.</p>

<p>* African American high school graduates earn about 82 
percent of what white graduates earn and the gap widens as 
the level of education increases: While Black male high 
school graduates earn $1,490 per year more than a white high 
school drop-outs, African American males with college 
degrees earn only $7,000 per year more than white high 
school graduates.</p>

<p>Dr. June Jackson Christmas, the Urban League's Urban Issues 
Group director, says that African Americans will not reach 
the goals set in Healthy People 2000, a government report 
that sets forth a national strategy to improve the nation's 
health, because of major disparities that continue to exist 
between their health status and that of white Americans.</p>

<p>"African Americans still endure significant health problems 
which are caused and exacerbated by poverty, lack of 
culturally competent health-care providers, ineffective 
health care and racial discrimination," Christmas writes. 
She adds that improvements in these areas are not enough to 
guarantee better health among African Americans. "The 
problems that afflict African Americans as a group begin, 
literally, before birth for far too many infants and 
continue to the end of life."</p>

<p>* In 1993, life expectancy for African Americans was 69.3 
years compared to 76.3 years for white Americans and more 
than 75 years for the population as a whole. The disparity 
is even more glaring for African American men whose life 
expectancy is more than eight years less than white men. 
While life expectancy for whites increased during the 1980s, 
it declined for African Americans.</p>

<p>* At 16.8 deaths per 100,000 births, African Americans have 
the highest infant mortality rates of all ethnic groups and 
nearly three times the mortality rate of white infants.</p>

<p>* If African Americans were considered a separate population 
group in the world, their infant mortality rate would rank number 40.</p>

<p>* A recent study by the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention found infant mortality rates to be 60 percent 
higher for women living below the poverty line than for 
those living above it.</p>

<p>* Among the leading causes of infant mortality are disorders 
due to short gestation and low birth weight, both associated 
with poverty sand malnutrition.</p>

<p>Christmas says the HMO drive to cut the cost of health care 
and a "mood of conservatism" among policy makers makes it 
harder for African Americans to achieve Year 2000 targets: 
The change from public responsibility to corporate 
privatization, mergers and "megasystem networks," block 
grant to states, a diminished role for the federal 
government and "a level of government historically 
inattentive to Black Americans" will deal heavy blows to the 
poor and especially to African Americans.</p>

<p>"Further," she says, "the policy of cutting back on the 
number of medical graduates and decreasing the ratio of 
specialists to primary care doctors does not address the 
gross under-representation of [African Americans] as both 
specialists and primary care physicians."</p>

<p>Timothy Bass, professor of labor and urban affairs at Wayne 
State University, criticizes the job-creation strategies of 
cities that, he says, are a two-edged sword: While 
development of central business districts creates more 
white-collar jobs, they will, if successful, create many 
low-wage service jobs, thus contributing to the 
proliferation of low-wage work.</p>

<p>Bass says such policies are "a cause of, not a cure for" low 
wages. He charges that maintaining the poverty inherent in 
low-wage industry is an important component of city 
development strategies. "It is the practices adopted by 
employers, not trends in worker productivity, which is 
increasingly responsible for rising poverty that is rooted 
in declining compensation and job security."</p>

<p>In closing, Bass says the "challenges to this emerging 
status quo, if they are forthcoming, will arise when younger 
generations put forth a class-based agenda to reverse the 
decline of the institutionalized power of labor."</p>

<p>While not written in the language of working people, the 
message of The State of Black America 1996 came through 
clearly: The fight for equality - and therefore, to close 
the "gaping holes" that are documented in the report - must 
go hand-in-hand with any struggle aimed at resolving the 
problems facing working people. And the fact that trade 
union and African American votes were two of the most 
important components of the coalition that denied Bob Dole 
the keys to the White House shows that it can be done.</p>

<h3>**'We need a modern-day WPA'**</h3>

<p>We believe the urban policy must have a laser-like focus on 
jobs for the inner-city poor. No fancy master plans. No 
complex policies with dozens of components. We need public 
policies which make work economically worthwhile ...</p>

<p>We've been content for too long with a low-wage economy that 
locks hard-working Americans into poverty. Boosting the 
minimum wage helps a bit, as does protecting the Earned 
Income Tax Credit from continuous assault by Congress.<p>

<p>Make no mistake. Inner city folk want to work. We've got to 
spread the job action around if inner city folk are to work 
- and if cities are to work.</p>

<p>There is no macro-economic policy, no economic growth 
scenario, no Model Cities approach, no black capitalism 
strategy and no enterprise zone experiment imaginable that 
can match the Depression-era Works Progress Administration 
in jumpstarting hope by driving unemployment down in a hurry 
...</p>

<p>There is nothing un-American about spending public money to 
help fill gaping holes in the labor market ... An urban jobs 
policy aimed at putting inner-city people back to work 
wouldn't differ in principle from such past efforts as the 
WPA.</p>
