<B>DOSE ESTIMATES</B>
</center>
<P>
The exposure of the population as a result of the accident resulted
in two main pathways of exposure. The first is the radiation dose
to the thyroid as a result of the concentration of radioiodine
and similar radionuclides in the gland. The second is the whole-body
dose caused largely by external irradiation mainly from radiocesium.
<P>
The absorbed dose to the whole body is thought to be about 20
times more deleterious, in terms of late health effects incidence,
than the same dose to the thyroid (<I>IC90</I>).
<P>
The population exposed to radiation following the Chernobyl accident
can be divided into four categories: (1) the staff of the nuclear
power plant and workers who participated in clean-up operations
(referred to as &quot;liquidators&quot;); (2) the nearby residents
who were evacuated from the 30-km zone during the first two weeks
after the accident; (3) the population of the former Soviet Union,
including especially the residents of contaminated areas; and
(4) the population in countries outside the former Soviet Union.
<P>
A number of liquidators estimated to amount up to 800,000 took
part in mitigation activities at the reactor and within the 30-km
zone surrounding the reactor. The most exposed workers were the
firemen and the power plant personnel during the first days of
the accident. Most of the dose received by the workers resulted
from external irradiation from the fuel fragments and radioactive
particles deposited on various surfaces.
<P>
About 135,000 people were evacuated during the first days following
the accident, mainly from the 30-km zone surrounding the reactor.
Prior to evacuation, those individuals were exposed to external
irradiation from radioactive materials transported by the cloud
and deposited on the ground, as well as to internal irradiation
essentially due to the inhalation of radioactive materials in
the cloud.
<P>
The relative contributions to the external whole-body dose from
the main radionuclides of concern for that pathway of exposure
and during the first few months after the accident are shown in
Figure 7. It is clear that tellurium-132 played a major role in
the first week after the accident, and that, after one month,
the radiocaesiums (caesium-134 and caesium-137) became predominant.
Subsequently, however, caesium-134 decayed to levels much lower
than those of caesium-137, which became after a few years the
only radionuclide of importance for practical purposes. It is
usual to refer to caesium-137 only, even when the mix of caesium-134
and caesium-137 is meant, because the values for the constituents
can be easily derived from those for caesium-137.

</center>
<p><br><p><br>

With regard to internal doses from inhalation and ingestion of
radionuclides, the situation is similar: radioiodine was important
during the first few weeks after the accident and gave rise to
thyroid doses via inhalation of contaminated air, and, more importantly,
via consumption of contaminated foodstuffs, mainly cow's milk.
After about one month, the radiocaesiums (caesium-134 and caesium-137)
again became predominant, and, after a few years, caesium-137
became the only radionuclide of importance for practical purposes,
even though strontium-90 may in the future play a significant
role at short distances from the reactor.
<P>
Among the population of the former Soviet Union, it is usual to
single out the residents of the contaminated areas, defined as
those with caesium-137 deposition levels greater than 37 kBq/m2.
About 4 million people live in those areas. Of special interest
are the inhabitants of the spots with caesium-137 deposition levels
greater than 555 kBq/m2. In those areas, called &quot;strict control
zones&quot;, protection measures are applied, especially as far
as control of consumption of contaminated food is concerned. 
<P>
Early after the accident, the All-Union Dose Registry (AUDR) was
set up by the Soviet Government in 1986 to record medical and
dosimetric data on the <BR>
population groups expected to be the most exposed: (1) the liquidators,
(2) the evacuees from the 30-km zone, (3) the inhabitants of the
contaminated areas, and (4) the children of those people. In 1991,
the AUDR contained data on 659,292 persons. Starting from 1992,
national registries of Belarus, Russian Federation, and Ukraine
replaced the AUDR.
<P>
 Outside the former Soviet Union, the radionuclides of importance
are, again, the radioiodines and radiocaesiums, which, once deposited
on the ground,<BR>
give rise to doses from ingestion through the consumption of foodstuffs.
Deposited radiocaesium is also a source of long-term exposure
from external irradiation from the contaminated ground and other
surfaces. Most of the population of the Northern hemisphere was
exposed, in varying degrees, to radiation from the Chernobyl accident.
The caesium-137 deposition outside the former Soviet Union ranged
from negligible levels to about 50 kBq/m2.
<P>
<B>The liquidators</B>
<P>
Most of the liquidators can be divided into two groups: (1) the
people who were working at the Chernobyl power station at the
time of the accident viz. the staff of the station and the firemen
and people who went to the aid of the victims. They number a few
hundred persons; and (2) the workers, estimated to amount up to
800,000, who were active in 1986-1990 at the power station or
in the zone surrounding it for the decontamination, sarcophagus
construction and other recovery operations.
<P>
On the night of 26 April 1986, about 400 workers were on the site
of the Chernobyl power plant. As a consequence of the accident,
they were subjected to the combined effect of radiation from several
sources: (1) external gamma/beta radiation from the radioactive
cloud, the fragments of the damaged reactor core scattered over
the site and the radioactive particles deposited on the skin,
and (2) inhalation of radioactive particles (<I>UN88</I>).
<P>
All of the dosimeters worn by the workers were over-exposed and
did not allow an estimate of the doses received. However, information
is available on the doses received by the 237 persons who were
placed in hospitals and diagnosed as suffering from acute radiation
syndrome. Using biological dosimetry, it was estimated that 140
of these patients received whole-body doses from external irradiation
in the range 1-2 Gy, that 55 received doses between 2 and 4 Gy
, that 21 received between 4 and 6 Gy, and that the remaining
21 received doses between 6 and 16 Gy. In addition, it was estimated
from thyroid measurements that the thyroid dose from inhalation
would range up to about 20 Sv, with 173 individuals in the 0-1.2
Sv range and five workers with thyroid doses greater than 11 Sv
(<I>UN88</I>).
<P>
The second category of liquidators consists of the large number
of adults who were recruited to assist in the clean-up operations.
They worked at the site, in towns, forests and agricultural areas
to make them fit to work and live in. Several hundreds of thousands
of individuals participated in this work. Initially, 50 per cent
of those workers came from the Soviet armed forces, the other
half including personnel of civil organisations, the security
service, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, and other organisations.
The total number of liquidators has yet to be determined accurately,
since only some of the data from some of those organisations have
been collected so far in the national registries of Belarus, Russia,
Ukraine and other republics of the former Soviet Union (<I>So95</I>).
Also, it has been suggested that, because of the social and economic
advantages associated with being designated a liquidator, many
persons have contrived latterly to have their names added to the
list.
<P>
There are only fragmented data on the doses received by the liquidators.
Attempts to establish a dosimetric service were inadequate until
the middle of June of 1986; until then, doses were estimated from
area radiation measurements. The liquidators were initially subjected
to a radiation dose limit for one year of 250 mSv. In 1987 this
limit was reduced to 100 mSv and in 1988 to 50 mSv <I>(Ba93)</I>.
The registry data show that the average recorded doses decreased
from year to year, being about 170 mSv in 1986, 130 mSv in 1987,
30 mSv in 1988 and 15 mSv in 1989 (<I>Se95a</I>). It is, however,
difficult to assess the validity of the results as they have been
reported. 
<P>
It is interesting to note that a small special group of 15 scientists
who have worked periodically inside the sarcophagus for a number
of years have estimated accumulated whole-body doses in the range
0.5 to 13 Gy (<I>Se95a</I>). While no deterministic effects have
been noted to date, this group may well show radiation health
effects in the future.
<P>
<B>The evacuees from the 30-km zone</B>
<P>
Immediately after the accident monitoring of the environment was
started by gamma dose rate measurements. About 20 hours after
the accident the wind turned in the direction of Pripyat, gamma
dose rates increased significantly in the town, and it was decided
to evacuate the inhabitants. About 20 hours later the 49,000 inhabitants
of Pripyat had left the town in nearly 1,200 buses. About a further
80,000 people were evacuated in the following days and weeks from
the contaminated areas.
<P>
Information relevant for the assessment of the doses received
by these people have been obtained by responses of the evacuees
to questionnaires about the location where they stayed, the types
of houses in which they lived, the consumption of stable iodine,
and other activities (<I>Li94</I>).
<P>
<I><B>Doses to the thyroid gland</B></I>
<P>
The iodine activity in thyroid glands of evacuees was measured.
More than 2,000 measurements of former inhabitants of Pripyat
had sufficient quality to be useful for dose reconstruction (<I>Go95a</I>).
A comparative analysis with the questionnaire responses showed
that thyroid doses were mainly due to inhalation of iodine-131.
Average individual doses and collective doses to the thyroid are
shown in Table 3 for three age groups. Individual doses in the
age classes were distributed over two orders of magnitude. The
main factor influencing the individual doses was found to be the
distance of the residence from the reactor.

Assessments of the doses to the thyroid gland of the evacuees
from the <BR>
30-km zone (<I>Li93a</I>) showed similar doses for young children
as those for the Pripyat evacuees. Exposures to adults were higher.
These high doses were due to a greater consumption of food contaminated
with iodine-131 among those evacuated later from the 30-km zone.
<P>
<I><B>Whole-body doses</B></I>
<P>
The whole-body doses to the evacuees were mainly due to external
exposure from deposited tellurium-132/iodine-132, caesium-134
and caesium137 and short lived radionuclides in the air. Measurements
of the gamma dose rate in air were performed every hour at about
thirty sites in Pripyat and daily at about eighty sites in the
30-km zone. Based on these measurements and using the responses
to the questionnaires, whole-body doses were reconstructed for
the 90,000 persons evacuated from the Ukrainian part of the 30-km
zone (<I>Li94</I>). There was a wide range of estimated doses
with an average value of 15 mSv. The collective dose was assessed
to be 1,300 person-Sv. The 24,000 persons evacuated in Belarus
might have received slightly higher doses, since the prevailing
wind was initially towards the north.
<P>
<B>People living in the contaminated areas</B>
<P>
<I><B>Doses to the thyroid gland</B></I>
<P>
The main information source for the dose reconstruction is the
vast amount of iodine activity measurements in thyroid glands.
In Ukraine 150,000 measurements, in Belarus several hundreds of
thousands of measurements and in the Russian Federation more than
60,000 measurements were performed in May/June 1986. Some of the
measurements were performed with inadequate instrumentation and
measurement conditions and are not useful for dose assessment
purposes. 
<P>
The large variability of individual doses makes estimates of dose
distributions difficult and current dose estimates are still subject
to considerable uncertainties, especially in areas where only
a few activity measurements in the thyroid were performed. Children
in the Gomel oblast (region) in Belarus received the highest doses.
An estimate (<I>Ba94</I>) of the dose distribution among these
children is shown in Table 4. For the whole Belarus the collective
thyroid dose to children (0 to 14 years) at the time of the accident
was assessed to be about 170,000 person-Sv <I>(Ri94)</I>. In the
eight most contaminated districts of Ukraine where thyroid measurements
were performed, the collective dose to this age group was about
60,000 person-Sv and for the whole population about 200,000 person-Sv
(<I>Li93</I>). In the Russian Federation the collective dose to
the whole population was about 100,000 person-Sv (<I>Zv93</I>).

Evaluations of questionnaires on food consumption rates in the
period May/June 1986 and measurements of food contamination showed
iodine-131 in milk as the major source for the thyroid exposure
of the population living in the contaminated areas. However, in
individual cases the consumption of fresh vegetables contributed
significantly to the exposure.
<P>
<I><B>Whole-body doses</B></I>
<P>
Two major pathways contributed to the whole-body doses of the
population in contaminated areas, the exposure to external irradiation
from deposited radionuclides (<I>Iv95</I>) and the incorporation
into the body of radio-caesium in food.
<P>
The external exposure is directly related to the radionuclide
activity per unit area and it is influenced by the gamma dose
rates in air at the locations of occupancy. Forestry workers and
other workers living in woodframe houses received the highest
doses.
<P>
Most of the higher contaminated areas are rural and a large part
of the diet is locally produced. Therefore, the uptake of caesium
by the plants from the soil is a deciding factor in the internal
exposure. These are regions with extraordinarily high transfer
factors, as the Rovno region in Ukraine, where even moderate soil
contaminations led to high doses. In order of decreasing magnitude
of transfer factors these regions are followed by regions with
peaty soil, sandy podzol (acidic infertile forest soil), loamy
podzol, and chernozem which is rich black soil.
<P>
In the first years after the accident the caesium uptake was dominated
practically everywhere by the consumption of locally produced
milk (<I>Ho94</I>). However, later mushrooms began to contribute
significantly in many settlements to the caesium incorporation
for two reasons. First, the milk contamination decreased with
time, whereas the mushroom contamination remained relatively constant.
Second, due to changes in the economic conditions in the three
republics, people are again collecting more mushrooms than they
were in the first years after the accident .
<P>
Table 5 summarises a recent estimate of whole-body doses to people
living in the higher contaminated areas. On average, external
irradiation was by far the highest contributor to the total population
exposure (<I>Er94</I>). However, the highest doses to individuals
were produced by the consumption of food from areas with high
transfers of radionuclides.

<B>Populations outside the former Soviet Union</B>
<P>
Even though the releases of radioactive materials during the Chernobyl
accident mainly affected the populations of Belarus, Russia and
Ukraine, the released materials became further dispersed throughout
the atmosphere and the volatile radionuclides of primary importance
(iodine-131 and caesium-137) were
detected in most countries of the Northern hemisphere. However,
the doses to the population were in most places much lower than
in the contaminated areas of the former Soviet Union; they reflected
the deposition levels of caesium-137 and were higher in areas
where the passage of the radioactive cloud coincided with rainfall.
Generally speaking, however, and with a few notable exceptions,
the doses decreased as a function of distance from the reactor
(<I>Ne87</I>).
<P>
During the first few weeks, iodine-131 was the main contributor
to the dose, via ingestion of milk <I>(Ma91)</I>. Infant thyroid
doses generally ranged from 1 to 20 mSv in Europe, from 0.1 to
5 mSv in Asia, and were about 0.1 mSv in North America. Adult
thyroid doses were lower by a factor of about 5 (<I>UN88</I>).

<P>
Later on, caesium-134 and caesium-137 were responsible for most
of the dose, through external and internal irradiation (<I>Ma89</I>).
The whole-body doses received during the first year following
the accident generally ranged from 0.05 to 0.5 mSv in Europe,
from 0.005 to 0.1 mSv in Asia, and of the order of 0.001 mSv in
North America. The total whole-body doses expected to be accumulated
during the lifetimes of the individuals are estimated to be a
factor of 3 greater than the doses received during the first year
(<I>UN88</I>).
<P>
<B>In summary, a large number of people received substantial doses
as a result of the Chernobyl accident:</B>
<UL>
<p><LI><I><B>Liquidators</B></I><B> - Hundreds of thousands of workers,
estimated to amount up to 800,000, were involved in clean-up operations.
The most exposed, with doses of several grays, were the workers
involved immediately after the beginning of the accident and the
scientists who have performed special tasks in the sarcophagus.
The average doses to liquidators are reported to have ranged between
170 mSv in 1986 and 15 mSv in 1989.</B>
<p><LI><I><B>Evacuees</B></I><B> - More than 100,000 persons were
evacuated during the first few weeks following the accident. The
evacuees were exposed to internal irradiation arising from inhalation
of radioiodines, especially iodine-131, and to external irradiation
from radioactivity present in the cloud and deposited on the ground.
Thyroid doses are estimated to have been, on average, about 1
Sv for small children under 3 years of age and about 70 mSv for
adults. Whole-body doses received from external irradiation prior
to evacuation from the Ukrainian part of the 30-km zone showed
a large range of variation with an average value of 15 mSv.</B>
<p><LI><I><B>People living in contaminated areas of the former Soviet
Union </B></I><B>- About 270,000 people live in contaminated areas
with caesium-137 deposition levels in excess of 555 kBq/m2. Thyroid
doses, due mainly to the consumption of cow's milk contaminated
with iodine-131, were delivered during the first few weeks after
the accident; children in the Gomel region of Belarus appear to
have received the highest thyroid doses with a range from negligible
levels up to 40 Sv and an average close to 1 Sv for children aged
0 to 7. Because of the control of foodstuffs in those areas, most
of the radiation exposure since the summer of 1986 is due to external
irradiation from the caesium-137 activity deposited on the ground;
the whole-body doses for the    1986-1989 time period are estimated
to range from 5 to 250 mSv with an average of 40 mSv. In areas
without food control, there are places, such as the Rovno region
of Ukraine, where the transfer of caesium137 from soil to plant
is very high, resulting in doses from internal exposure being
greater than those from external exposure.</B>
<p><LI><I><B>Populations outside the former Soviet Union -</B></I><B>
The radioactive materials of a volatile nature (such as iodine
and caesium) that were released during the accident spread throughout
the entire northern hemisphere. The doses received by populations
outside the former Soviet Union were relatively low, and showed
large differences from one country to another depending mainly
upon whether rainfall occurred during the passage of the radioactive
cloud.</B>
