<h1>Dr. Max Gerson's Biography</h1>

<p>Dr. Max Gerson, M. D. was born in 1881 in Wongrowitz, Germany.  He

attended the Universities of Breslau, Wuerzburg, Berlin and Freiburg.

He was the director of a special department of tuberculosis at the

Munich University Hospital under the sponsorship of Dr. Ferdinand

Sauerbruch, a world famous thoracic surgeon and tuberculosis

authority.



<p>As a young German medical student, Gerson suffered from severe

migraine headaches.  He had been told that they were untreatable, and

that he would have to learn to live with them.  To his joy, Gerson

found that by restricting his diet, by avoiding salt, fats, pickled

and smoked foods, and by eating fresh fruits and vegetables, he could

control them.  Soon, he was sharing this new "migraine diet" with his

patients.



<p>One of Gerson's patients insisted that the migraine diet had cured his

skin tuberculosis.  Gerson listened, carefully weighing the

possibility that the diet might somehow be enhancing immunity.  He

decided that it might be true, and set out to validate it.  In the

process, his work came to the attention of Sauerbruch.  A new era in

medicine was born.  In 1929, Sauerbruch announced Gerson's dietary

therapy as a cure for skin TB, publishing simultaneously in a dozen of

the world's leading peer-reviewed scientific journals. Sauerbruch told

of a clinical trial of Gerson's dietary treatment in which 446 of 450

TB patients achieved lasting cures (also mentioned in Sauerbruch's

autobiography, "Master Surgeon").  Gerson lectured in the principal

cities of Europe until the pre-war political climate forced him to

emigrate in 1933.



<p>During this time, Gerson attracted the friendship of Nobel Prize

winner Albert Schweitzer, M. D., by curing his wife of lung

tuberculosis after she had failed to respond to all conventional

managements.  1934 saw the publication of "Diet Therapy for Lung

Tuberculosis" (pub. Franz Deuticke, Leipzig and Vienna) in which

Mrs. Schweitzer is documented case 45.  Gerson and Schweitzer remained

friends for life, and maintained a regular correspondence.  Schweitzer

followed Gerson's progress as the diet therapy was applied

successfully to a wide variety of pathologies, including heart and

kidney failure, and finally cancer.  Schweitzer's own adult onset

diabetes responded to Gerson's dietary treatment.



<p>In 1946, Gerson demonstrated recovered cancer patients before the

Pepper-Neely Congressional Sub-Committee, during hearings on S. 1875,

a bill to authorize the President to wage war on cancer. Although only

a few peer-reviewed journals were receptive to his revolutionary

ideas, Gerson continued to publish in the U. S. and abroad.



<p>Gerson died in 1959.  He was eulogized by Albert Schweitzer:



<p>"I see in him one of the most eminent geniuses in the history of

medicine.  Many of his basic ideas have been adopted without having

his name connected with them.  Yet he has achieved more than seemed

possible under adverse conditions.  He leaves a legacy which commands

attention and, which will assure him his due place.  Those whom he

cured will now attest to the truth of his ideas."
