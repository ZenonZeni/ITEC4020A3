<p>This Civic and Business Outreach Guide has been developed to
provide you with ideas and examples of ways to educate and enlist
the help of civic groups and businesses. These audiences are
important to reach because they can help educate policymakers,
network with other business leaders, shape health insurance
coverage, and demonstrate broad-based support for equal treatment
of people with brain disorders. In addition, these audiences can
offer financial support to your AMI affiliate. </p>

<p>Inside you will find: (1) science and treatment messages; (2)
ideas on how to start your outreach efforts; and (3) science and
treatment outreach tactics. While we have included some
innovative AMI affiliate strategies as examples, we also
encourage you to be creative and develop your own outreach initiatives.</p>

<p><b>Messages</b></p>

<p>Civic and business outreach is divided into two categories:
business executives and civic organizations/voluntary groups like
the Rotary Club, YMCA, and the American Red Cross. Specific messages
for reaching these audiences include:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Treatment of brain disorders works.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>The costs of treating brain disorders are comparable to
        the costs of treating many other physical illnesses.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>Your business/organization can play a major role in
        helping people with brain disorders lead healthy,
        productive lives.</li>
</ul>

<p>A message chart with supporting facts for each message is
provided in the Media Outreach Tools folder for your use.</p>

<p><b>Getting Started</b></p>

<p><i>Develop a Plan.</i> Before you begin your outreach, develop
a plan listing your civic/business goals and objectives, target
audiences, proposed activities, and an estimated timeline.
(Please see attached sample plan.)</p>

<p><i>Form a Civic and Business Committee</i>. Appoint two or
more people to form a committee responsible for outreach. Look
for people who are articulate and who have experience dealing
with the civic and business communities.</p>

<p>There are a number of ways to generate support for brain
disorder issues among these communities.</p>

<p><i>Get to Know Your Audiences</i>. Do your homework. Which
companies, civic groups, and voluntary organizations are the most
worthwhile to target? Which are most influential in your
community? Among policymakers? What are companies&#146; track
records on providing insurance for brain disorders and protection
against discrimination? Which business executives in each company
are most important to reach, and where is the best place to reach
them -- at work or at civic group meetings? Do your members or
their friends have contacts with any of these audiences? This
information can help you conduct more focused and successful
outreach.</p>

<p><i>Update Your List of Community Resources</i>. Make sure you
have current listings of local AMI support meetings, mental
health providers, and other resources in your area before meeting
with business leaders. If they ask where they can refer employees
for help, you want to be well-informed.</p>

<p><i>Evaluate Civic and Business Cooperation. </i>Find out which
consumer groups carry the most credibility in your community.
Remember to think outside of your natural brain disorder allies.
Reach out to other broad-based partners, such as AARP, YWCA, and
American Red Cross. Work with your local partners to keep a
record of business policies supportive of brain disorders. Also
keep a running tally of business donations and participation in
AMI activities. Identify the best channels and messengers to
reach these audiences -- one-on-one or group meetings; trade
publications; coverage in business press.</p>

<p><b>Civic and Business Outreach Tips</b></p>

<p><i><u>Brainstorming/Developing Your Network</u></i></p>

<ul>
    <li>Hold brainstorming sessions with your members to generate
        a list of business contacts and potential business
        supporters. (Please see the attached sample brainstorming
        questions.) These business people are potential partners
        as you expand the reach of science and treatment messages
        -- they can help mobilize peers and act as positive role
        models.
        </li>
    <li>Hold a brainstorming session with your members to
        generate a list of businesses that have less than
        favorable records on brain disorders and need education
        about science and treatment. (Attached are sample
        brainstorming questions.)
        </li>
    <li>Offer to join the speakers&#146; bureau for United Way or
        Combined Health Appeal (National Voluntary Health
        Agencies Campaign), if you receive funding from these
        sources, in order to have greater access to businesses.</li>
</ul>

<p><i><u>Research</u></i></p>

<ul>
    <li>Research workplace policies on brain disorders. Find out
        about such issues as confidentiality, health insurance
        coverage, and leave policies. Find out if companies fully
        inform employees about these policies. There are several
        possible methods for collecting this information: contact the
        company&#146;s human resources department, and obtain any
        public information; speak with an employee(s) of the
        company; or ask policy-related questions while meeting
        with business executives. (Please see the attached sample
        business questions for ideas.)
        </li>
</ul>

<p><i><u>Meetings/Workshops</u></i></p>

<ul>
    <li>Use your personal contacts to secure meetings with
        business people. Encourage them to become AMI board
        members. As board members, they can help devise
        strategies for effecting business and legislative policy
        change.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>Visit business leaders and civic groups. The enclosed
        talking points can help you conduct briefings to business
        executives, either one-on-one in the workplace or at
        Rotary Club or other civic group events. Brief the
        audience on the latest science of brain disorders and the cost-effectiveness
        of treatment. Stimulate discussion about workplace issues
        related to brain disorders, such as confidentiality,
        health insurance coverage, and leave policies. Share your own
        workplace experiences.
        </li>
    <li>Conduct briefings with voluntary organizations.
        Familiarize these groups with the issues that have an
        impact on their members. For instance, meet with
        representatives of the local AARP chapter, and explain
        why brain disorders, and health insurance coverage of
        these disorders, are relevant concerns for senior
        citizens. Mobilize them to take action to affect policy
        surrounding these issues.
        </li>
    <li>Conduct one-on-one meetings with local insurance company
        executives, using Kit materials to brief them on the
        latest science and treatment advances, data comparing
        costs of treating brain disorders vs. other medical
        illnesses, and treatment success rates. 
        </li>
    <li>Contact business executives and human resource staff you
        know, and offer to conduct an employee inservice training
        on brain disorders and the services your affiliate can
        offer. Also encourage them to provide information about
        brain disorders and your AMI affiliate phone number to
        employees through newsletters, flyers, or e-mail. 
        </li>
</ul>

<p><i><u>Within the Workplace</u></i></p>

<ul>
    <li>Place the print advertisements from the Media Tools
        Outreach section in newsletters at your place of
        employment.
        </li>
    <li>Use company newsletters to highlight businesses with
        solid records of supportive mental health policies.
        </li>
    <li>Work with business executives to set up AMI groups within
        local companies. Contact company EAPs to offer this
        service. These AMIs can give support to employees with
        brain disorders and offer information about joining AMI.</li>
</ul>

<p><i><u>Media Outreach</u></i></p>

<ul>
    <li>Conduct outreach to business media, using some of the
        enclosed media tools, to encourage coverage of the
        business angle of brain disorders.
        </li>
    <li>Issue a press release or plan a media briefing to
        highlight business role models in your community. Target
        business media.
        </li>
    <li>If an employee faces discrimination in a particular
        workplace, use the enclosed media tools (e.g., op-ed) to
        publicize this situation.
        </li>
    <li>If organizations, particularly business and insurance,
        take a policy stand against parity, try to place the Kit
        op-ed in your local newspaper.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Proven AMI Strategies</b></p>

<ul>
    <li>AMI of Greater Milwaukee has many civic and business
        leaders on its board. These board members helped AMI
        network with organizations outside the traditional mental
        health community.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>AMI of Waukesha, WI, enlists businesses to support its
        annual chili cook-off, which last year raised over $5,000
        and helped raise the community&#146;s awareness about
        brain disorder issues.
        </li>
    <li>Many members of AMI-Racine County, WI, are employed by
        the Johnson Corporation, manufacturers of Johnson&#146;s
        Wax. Because employees have talked openly about their
        families&#146; brain disorders, the company has been a
        strong supporter of local and state AMIs.</li>
</ul>

<p align="center"><b>SAMPLE QUESTIONS FOR BUSINESS EXECUTIVES</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>The following are sample questions which you might consider
asking business executives when you meet with them. Explain that
these are questions to help assess insurance policies affecting employees
with brain disorders such as schizophrenia, panic disorder,
obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), bipolar disorder
(manic-depressive illness), and major depression. </i></p>

<p>- What is your health insurance carrier(s)? What kind of
plan(s) is offered to employees (e.g., traditional, HMO, PPO,
managed care)? </p>

<p>- Does your medical coverage for employees also include mental
health coverage [coverage of brain disorders such as
schizophrenia, panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder,
bipolar disorder (manic-depressive illness), and major
depression]?
</p>

<p>- Please provide information about terms and conditions (e.g.,
pre-authorization required, coverage, co-payments, term limits,
lifetime caps) of mental health:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Inpatient care</li>
    <li>Outpatient care</li>
    <li>Medications</li>
    <li>Therapy/consultations with mental health professionals</li>
    <li>Early periodic screening, diagnosis, and treatment</li>
    <li>Other treatment options (including partial
        hospitalization, residential treatment, etc.)</li>
</ul>

<p>- How does this compare to employee coverage for other medical
illnesses?</p>

<p>- Does your medical coverage for dependents, family members,
or children also include mental health coverage? How does this
compare to dependent coverage for other medical illnesses?&nbsp;</p>
