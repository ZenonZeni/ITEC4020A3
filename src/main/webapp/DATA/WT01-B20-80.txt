  1  1 A Joint Resolution supporting the use of marijuana for medical 
  1  2    purposes in the state of Iowa. 
  1  3    WHEREAS, significant scientific and medical studies have 
  1  4 demonstrated that marijuana is safe for use under medical 
  1  5 supervision and that the cannabis plant, in its natural form, has 
  1  6 important therapeutic benefits that are often of critical medical 
  1  7 importance to persons afflicted with a variety of life- 
  1  8 threatening and sense-threatening illnesses; and 
  1  9    WHEREAS, courts have recognized marijuana's medical value in 
  1 10 treatment and have ruled that marijuana can be a drug of 
  1 11 "necessity" in the treatment of glaucoma, cancer, AIDS, and 
  1 12 multiple sclerosis; and 
  1 13    WHEREAS, the people of the state of Iowa believe that well- 
  1 l4 trained medical professionals rather than remote federal 
  1 15 bureaucrats should be responsible for determining a patient's 
  1 16 medical care routine; and 
  1 17    WHEREAS, seriously ill Iowans and other Americans are 
  1 18 unnecessarily suffering because of federal policies which legally 
  1 19 prohibit marijuana's legitimate medical use; and 
  1 20    WHEREAS, Iowa Code section <A HREF="http://www2.legis.state.ia.us/IACODE/1995/124/206.html">124.206</A>, subsection 7, paragraph 
  1 21 "a", enacted in 1979, allows the use of marijuana for medical 
  1 22 purposes in the state of Iowa, expressing the intent of the Iowa 
  1 23 General Assembly that marijuana should be available for 
  1 24 legitimate medical purposes; and 
  2  1    WHEREAS, these problems are not particular to the state of 
  2  2 Iowa, but generally affect the citizens of all states adversely; 
  2  3 NOW THEREFORE, 
  2  4 BE IT RESOLVED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF IOWA: 
  3  1    That the Iowa General Assembly memorializes the President
  3  2 and the United States Congress to end federal prohibitions
  3  3 against marijuana's legitimate medical use by creating a
  3  4 rational system of prescriptive medical access to marijuana;
  3  5 and
  3  6    BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, That copies of this Resolution be
  3  7 transmitted to the Honorable Bill Clinton, President of the
  3  8 United States; the Honorable Albert Gore, Vice President of
  3  9 the United States and President of the United States Senate;
  3 10 the Honorable Newt Gingrich, Speaker of the United States
  3 11 House of Representatives; the Honorable Robert Dole, Majority
  3 12 Leader of the United States Senate; Donna Shalala, Secretary
  3 13 of the United States Department of Health and Human Services;
  3 14 Janet Reno, United States Attorney General; and the members of
  3 15 Iowa's congressional delegation.  
  3 16                           EXPLANATION
  3 17    This resolution recites the Iowa general assembly's support
  3 18 for the removal of federal prohibitions relating to the
  3 19 legalization of marijuana for certain medical purposes in the
  3 20 state of Iowa.
