Winter 1996

By Dale Andrade

You never know where terrorists might turn up. They might
be anywhere, though we have a hard time believing that
they live among us. Sure, a few homegrown ones surface
here in the United States now and then, but how about the
international variety, particularly the ones who wreak
havoc throughout the Middle East?

Unless you followed the news very closely, you probably
missed the shocker of the year: the new head of Islamic
Jihad is a college professor from the University of
Florida in Tampa. That's right. As hard as it is to
believe that a high-ranking leader from one of the most
violent terrorist organizations in the Middle East might
be living here in the States, that is exactly what
happened.

Islamic Jihad is an Iranian-backed organization with a
sworn hatred of Israel and an intractable opposition to
the Middle East peace process. Its suicide bombers have
killed several Israeli soldiers and an American college
student. Although overshadowed by Hamas, during the past
few months Israeli intelligence has kept an especially
watchful eye on Islamic Jihad, which last October saw its
last leader, Fathi Shiqaqi, assassinated in Malta,
probably by Israeli agents.  While all this was
happening, Ramadan Abdullah Shallah quietly minded his
own business as a professor of Middle
Eastern studies at the University of South Florida.
Fellow faculty members and students remembered Shallah as
a scholar concerned about the image of Islam worldwide.
"He didn't
seem like a radical to me," one of Shallah's students
told the New York Times. Another said there was "never
any
indication that he had any sympathy with acts of terror
for anyone's cause."

Last June, Dr. Shallah left the United States saying he
needed to tend to his gravely ill father in Gaza. In
reality he went back to take the reins of Islamic Jihad.
With the
death of Shiqaqi, the mild-mannered professor tore off
his mask and declared Israel to be the implacable enemy
of Arabs in the Middle East and swore to destroy the
peace process. Shallah praised the assassination of
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and promised a "hard
war" against Israel.

There's another twist to the story. While Shallah may
have fooled his academic colleagues, his cover roused the
suspicion of the most hardcore of Islamic fundamentalists
-- the mullahs in Iran. Immediately after word went out
that
Shallah was the new head of Islamic Jihad, Tehran let it
be known that he has had "suspicious contacts" with US
and
British intelligence. Both groups deny any ties, but note
that Iran thinks Shallah is too moderate for the job.

Why hole up in Tampa rather than Iran? According to the
Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith, the scenario fits
precisely with Islamic Jihad's new tactics. Beginning in
1988 the group began moving its leaders who were not
directly involved in terrorism to quiet spots overseas.
Modern technology in the form of faxes and the Internet
has allowed them to stay in touch and ready for action at
a
moment's notice. How many others might be under our
noses?
Unfortunately, CTS has not been able to unmask any other
"sleeping" terrorists, but we do have articles designed
to keep security professionals on top of the latest in
counterterrorism. Associate Editor Jack Plaxe profiles
the US State Department's "Rewards Program for Terrorism
Information," which promises $2 million for vital
information which prevents a terrorist act or leads to
the apprehension of wanted terrorists. In this issue we
also
propose new measures to enhance the security of civil
aviation, and look at how organized crime is threatening
the economic security of South Africa. Contributing
editor Tom Marks looks at the ongoing terrorism in Sri
Lanka, one of
the world's last bastions of Marxist insurgency. On the
practical side, learn about new techniques in crisis
management, plus what to do to prevent being kidnapped,
or if you are, how to survive the ordeal.

In short, there's something in this issue for everyone in
the security business.

Aviation Security: New Measures Needed to Meet the New
Century by Larry C. Johnson & Douglas R. Laird. Part I

Your early morning flight from Los Angeles International
Airport to Washington, DC, has leveled off at 37,000
feet. As the plane crosses the Rocky Mountains, flight
attendants scurry up and down the aisles serving
breakfast. You settle back into your seat to watch the
movie.

Suddenly, without warning, your senses are overwhelmed by
a deafening bang and a billowing cloud of smoke. You
barely have time to scream before you find yourself
hurtling through the air, surrounded by passengers and
debris from the disintegrating aircraft. Deprived of
oxygen and suffering from shock, you black out as your
body accelerates toward the earth. You, along with 299
other passengers and crew, have died because of a
terrorist bomb hidden in luggage stowed in the jet's
belly.

Fortunately, most air travelers will never experience the
horror of being sucked out of an airplane following an
in-flight explosion. Yet this scenario is more than an
idle fantasy conjured by a fertile imagination. Since
1985 more than 1,000 passengers and crew have died
because terrorists penetrated security and smuggled a
bomb on board a civilian airliner. Airplanes of carriers
such as Pan Am, TWA, UTA, and Avianca have been bombed by
terrorists, with devastating consequences.

Aviation bombings are rare, but they represent a serious
threat that the aviation community is not yet prepared to
counter effectively and consistently, especially within
the continental United States. While security measures
are in place to reduce vulnerabilities to this threat, we
are still years away from deploying explosive detection
systems that are reliable, efficient, and cheap.

Meanwhile, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is
moving proactively to beef up domestic security and
eliminate the gap between international and domestic
procedures. This has sparked an outcry from airline
executives and airport operators--who have legitimate
concerns that they will be unable to bear the financial
cost estimated at over $2 billion dollars--of
implementing the newly mandated procedures.

Where is the US aviation security system headed? What are
actual threats facing civil aviation? What are the
implications of tougher domestic security measures for
airline and airport executives as well as the traveling
public? These questions have unleashed a highly
contentious process that will ultimately require both the
federal government and the airline industry to reassess
how aviation security should be organized, implemented,
and funded.
The Aviation Security System

Security for airline passengers currently is handled in
two arenas- one international and one national.
Internationally, security standards set by the
International Civil Aviation Organization's (ICAO) Annex
17, offers a least common denominator approach to
security. While accepted internationally, these standards
fall short of providing a tough set of measures that
protect air carriers targeted by terrorists. For
countries like the United States, however, Annex 17 is a
starting point for security rather than the final
destination.


The real action on security occurs at the national level.
By law and by tradition, a nation has the right to set
and enforce aviation security practices for their flag
carriers, regardless of where they operate, and for
foreign carriers that depart from its airports. In actual
operation, however, these rights are not exercised
equally. The United States, in particular, has been very
aggressive in setting the standards and practices used
for aviation security. Its influence is partly due to its
vast market--a huge number of passengers fly on US
carriers, and a large number of foreign carriers want to
fly to the United States.

Two US laws provide the legal foundation guiding how the
US carries out the aviation security mission,
particularly overseas: the Foreign Airport Security Act
of 1986 and the Aviation Security Improvement Act of
1990. Both laws recognize the principle that a
country--in this case the United States--has the
sovereign right to control who lands planes in its
territory. The United States can set standards for any
carrier that wants to land in the United States,
although foreign carriers are not required to use the
same security programs followed by US carriers. The legal
framework also requires the US government to assess
security at any foreign airport where US carriers
operate. In addition, the FAA monitors the overseas
performance of security procedures, such as adding
personnel to screen passengers prior to allowing them on
board a plane, or requiring passengers to be screened
with metal detectors before boarding a plane.

If the world consisted of only one nation, the task of
aviation security would be simple and straightforward. In
the multinational world, however, aviation security
involves more confusion and conflict than clarity. A US
carrier operating in Germany, for instance, must carry
out extraordinary procedures mandated by the FAA. Yet,
the same US air carrier's operations at Frankfurt's
international airport are controlled primarily by
Germany's federal government, and the Hessian State
Government in particular.  While the FAA can dictate the
procedures US carriers must follow and fine them for
lapses in security, its ability to monitor those
procedures falls under the jurisdiction and laws of
Germany. In addition, foreign carriers flying to the
United States claim that under Annex 17 the United
States cannot compel them to impose tighter security
procedures. The FAA can only require foreign carriers to
implement higher standards if they are departing from a
US airport.
For many years the demands of operating in an
international environment have generated friction between
the FAA and US air carriers. Prior to the bombing of Pan
Am 103, US air carriers complained regularly that they
were being held accountable by the US government for
implementing security procedures, but were on their own
in securing the permission of the host government.

In the aftermath of Pan Am 103 the U.S. Government
expanded its role in helping US-based air carriers
resolve disputes with foreign authorities over
implementing security procedures. For instance, US air
carriers operating in Great Britain and Germany in the
spring of 1992 were co-located at check-in counters with
Iran Air. Because of Iran's dubious status as a state
sponsor of terrorism, the carriers expressed fears that
the Iranian airline officials, by virtue of their
proximity, would gain knowledge about US mandated
security procedures. Agreeing that the carriers
had a legitimate concern, the US State Department,
working with the FAA, interceded with British and German
officials to provide a solution.

The FAA is doing a good job of protecting US airline
passengers, but its ability to do an even better job is
hampered by its second-class status within the federal
bureaucracy and internal conflicts resulting from
carrying out its other regulatory missions--e.g., flight
safety and airport operations. At the White House and the
National Security Council, for example, transportation
security issues in general, and aviation in particular,
are handled on an ad hoc basis. This has been the case
for both Democratic and Republican administrations.
Accordingly, the FAA must use a rather convoluted
bureaucratic chain of command to bring serious security
issues to the attention of the president. If the FAA's
Assistant Administrator for Civil Aviation Security
decides punitive action is required against a country for
inadequate security, such as suspending flights, he would
first inform the FAA Administrator who in turn would
present the issue to the Secretary of Transportation. It
is the responsibility of the Secretary of Transportation
to present the issue to the White House.

The FAA's regulatory missions also cloud its security
mission. Witness the recent effort, for example, to raise
security standards at airports around the country. This
has touched off an intensive behind-the-scenes lobbying
campaign by representatives of the air carriers and
airport operators who believe the FAA is going too far.
Many on the commercial side of the aviation industry
argue that the new measures threaten the economic
viability of the industry, and that in the absence of a
specific, credible threat, the additional procedures are
not being implemented in accordance with the criteria
specified in established contingency plans. Along with
industry complaints, some members of Congress have
weighed in on the debate, questioning the basis for the
recommendations of the FAA security experts.

Aviation Security: New Measures Needed to Meet the New
Century by Larry C. Johnson & Douglas R. Laird. Part II

Assessing the Threat

Unfortunately, the wrong question is being asked. We
should be less concerned about whether or not security
officials are accurately evaluating new threat
information and focus instead on whether it is even
appropriate to base an aviation security system on our
ability to get accurate, predictive intelligence.
Traditionally, an increased threat has been the impetus
for installing new security procedures. This approach is
dangerous. Contrary to conventional wisdom, intelligence
agencies rarely get information that permits a policy
maker or security official to take preventative action or
predict what a terrorist will do. It is worth noting that
the vast majority of terrorist attacks against
aviation--most notably the bombings of Pan Am 103 and UTA
772--have occurred without advance warning. The recent
capture of Ramzi Yousef in the Philippines just before he
launched an attack against airliners flying across the
Pacific was a rare exception, and that happened mostly by
luck. Usually, accurately predicting the weather in
Oklahoma next year is far easier than accurately
predicting if there will be a terrorist attack in
Oklahoma City.

The inadequacy of intelligence as a foundation for
determining the appropriate security levels in the United
States has become more difficult because the groups now
responsible for most terrorist activity around the world
are not easily penetrated by traditional intelligence
methods. With the end of the Cold War the threat has
shifted away from national liberation movements to groups
affiliated with extremist religious organizations. We
need only recall the bombing of the World Trade Center,
the nerve gas attacks in the Tokyo subway, the bus
bombings In Israel, and the airplane hijacking in Algeria
to realize that the culprits are drawn from radical
religious sects rather than the more familiar Cold War
groups, such as the Red Army Faction and the Red Brigade.

Moreover, going after these groups poses some daunting
civil rights and legal issues. Is the United States
prepared to authorize the FBI or the CIA carte blanche to
spy on religious organizations? In the wake of Ruby Ridge
and Waco this appears to be an unlikely option. Yet as we
near the dawn of the 21st century, we are likely to see
more, not fewer, radical groups who believe that they are
agents of some deity to bring to pass a divine judgment
or retribution on a wicked world.

Instead of waiting for a spy to discover a terrorist plot
and pass this information on to the appropriate
authorities, the aviation security system should be
designed to prevent acts and deter threats. Failure to
implement such a system can have disastrous results. The
December 1994 hijacking of an Air France flight from
Algeria is a case in point. Anyone who has monitored the
front page of a major newspaper during 1994 would recall
that Algeria has been wracked for several years by a wave
of terrible terrorist violence. Much of this violence has
been carried out by radical Islamic groups bent on
ousting a secular government. Notwithstanding the
violence, the French adopted the traditional approach to
aviation security by relying on Algerian authorities to
maintain the appropriate level of security. This approach
left 170 passengers and crew vulnerable to the events
that ensued on December 24.

Four hijackers affiliated with the Armed Islamic Group
disguised themselves as airport security officials and
overwhelmed the Air France crew. After killing three
passengers, including a French citizen, the hijackers
were allowed to take off and subsequently land in
Marseilles, France, on December 26. As the situation
continued to deteriorate, French commandos stormed the
plane, rescued the passengers and crew, and killed the
hijackers. The world was aghast when it learned the
hijackers had placed explosives on board the plane,
intending to blow it up in the air over Paris. Only in
the aftermath of this narrowly averted aerial kamikaze
assault on Paris did French security officials tighten
security on flights between Algeria and France and assert
their right to monitor Algerian and the airline
compliance.

The world can no longer run the risk, as did France in
Algeria, of a security system hastily put together in
reaction to specific incidents. During the late 1960s and
early 1970s a surge aircraft hijackings within the United
States prompted the introduction of walk-through metal
detectors at US airports. Requiring pre-board security
screening led subsequently to a dramatic reduction of
domestic hijackings by individuals who had smuggled guns
on board aircraft. We did not see a similar decline in
international hijackings, at least initially, because
neither the United States nor the airlines could
unilaterally force other countries to adopt these
security measures.

Then in the wake of the 1986 hijacking of Pan Am 73,
which resulted in the deaths of 22 people and injuries to
more than 125, the FAA tightened security screening
procedures for US air carriers operating internationally.
Since 1986 no US air carriers have been hijacked because
a terrorist defeated the preboard passenger screening
process.

Coping With Today's Threat

Today we have a sound security system for defeating
hijackings that is rooted in technology--walk through
metal detectors and x-ray--and relies on human operators.
Although a number of systems are coming on the market
that try to automate this procedure or improve the
ability of the security personnel to locate a weapon in
carry-on baggage, the decisions of human beings still
play a large role in ensuring that weapons are not
carried on board an airplane. In the case of explosives
detection, however, the security advantage
evaporates--even in the presence of knowledgeable
security personnel. Unlike the systems to prevent
hijackings, there is no comparable technology presently
available for detecting explosives that meets three key
criteria: reasonably priced, reliable, and efficient.
Instead of solving the problem with technology, the
airline industry is forced to rely on assumptions about
human behavior--such as hoping that most people do not
have a death wish and will not wittingly carry a bomb on
board a plane.

When the FAA ordered airports and airlines in the United
States to implement new security measures in August of
this year they were acting preventively. This is another
sign of the improvements the FAA has made in security
operations since Pan Am 103. Instead of reacting to a
specific threat the FAA is taking into account a variety
of events. Topping the list was the fear of retaliation
from radical Islamic groups if a guilty verdict was
delivered in the conspiracy case against Egyptian cleric
Sheik Rahman. Another concern was the threat issued by
the radical Palestinian group Hamas, warning it would
attack the United States if one of its leaders was
extradited from to Israel. In addition, the FAA believes
the World Trade Center in New York City and the federal
building in Oklahoma City have dispelled the notion that
the United States is domestically immune to the threat of
terrorism. Accordingly, they have decided that there can
no longer be one level of security for international
flights and a lower level for domestic operations.

The implications of this decision are enormous and will
impose substantial economic costs on air carriers and
airports, which will be passed on to the traveling
public. But, in our professional judgment, the FAA's
action is warranted and appropriate for the times. The
major consequence of the FAA decision will be seen in the
area of positive passenger bag match (PPBM). Simply put,
PPBM is coming to America.

Positive passenger bag match ensures that no baggage will
be carried on a plane unless the passenger that checked
the bag is also on board. This system has proven
effective in deterring and preventing aircraft bombings
on international flights. It has not been used
domestically, however, because air carriers say that they
cannot implement the procedure and maintain the same
level of service. Part of the problem is the enormous
volume of domestic traffic and the short connecting time
between flights in the hub and spoke system in use today.
Keeping passengers and bags together is already a
difficult task. Most in the airline industry argue that
PPBM on domestic flights will force a dramatic cutback in
the number of flights and operational efficiency. Yet,
industry insiders also concede that if a bomb explodes on
board a domestic flight any opposition to PPBM will be
moot. Moving to PPBM will be costly. According to sources
in both the FAA and the aviation industry, a recent study
puts the first year cost of implementing PPBM at between
two and three billion dollars. While this is a lot of
money, it works out to roughly two dollars per passenger
per flight. Implementing PPBM would probably remove as
many as three banks of flights per day from the current
ten bank system. This will create inconveniences for
passengers and could bankrupt several of the weaker
carriers, according to industry officials.

Not taking action, however, would be even more costly.
Conservative estimates of the bombing of Pan Am 103 put
expenses at close to two billion dollars. The loss of Pan
Am 103 was a fatal blow to the carrier's viability as a
commercial entity. This financial loss does not include
the emotional suffering of those who lost loved ones.

Aviation Security: New Measures Needed to Meet the New
Century by Larry C. Johnson & Douglas R. Laird. Part III

Next Steps to a Secure Future

We are entering a new era of aviation security that will
change how airlines and airports do business and how you
travel. While the adjustments may not be easy,
particularly in the beginning, the results will make
traveling by air more safe in the long run. The choice
before the US government is whether or not it wants to
strengthen its ability to prevent terrorist acts against
civil aviation. Because US aviation is a high profile
target of terrorist threats, and since commercial
aviation plays an important role in supporting national
defense, the federal government should treat aviation
security as part of a national defense strategy. American
carriers are targeted by terrorists because they have the
US flag on their tails. They are surrogate targets. And
US commercial air carriers play a key role in US military
operations, assisting in the transport of troops or
materiel during national crises. It is, therefore,
reasonable for the federal government to view protecting
commercial aviation as a national security issue.
Instituting this reform would require significant changes
at the Federal level. One approach would be moving the
security function currently performed by the FAA to the
Department of Defense. The responsibility for protecting
commercial airlines should be handled by an Assistant
Secretary for Transportation Security. This job would
have both international and domestic responsibilities. In
addition, the federal government should take on the job
of security at airports rather than leaving it up to
local governments or the private sector. Many foreign
governments successfully carry out aviation security
functions themselves rather than relying on private
industry, and the United States should do the same.

The second step towards better security is eliminating
the dichotomy between international and domestic security
procedures. The FAA deserves praise for moving in this
direction. Unwilling to wait for terrorists to bomb a
domestic airliner, the FAA is pursuing a course of
preventative action by requiring airports and air
carriers operating within the United States to use
security procedures comparable to those in place for
international flights. At the same time, the FAA is going
to need the muscle of the White House and the Secretary
of State to insist that other countries who fly to the
United States use the same kind of security program that
US carriers are required to use.

This issue--known colloquially as the level playing field
within the aviation industry--is very controversial. The
controversy pits US air carriers against the principle of
national sovereignty. The carriers argue that because
they must bear the cost of security requirements levied
by the federal government they are put at a competitive
disadvantage vis-a-vis foreign carriers, who do not have
to adopt the same practices. Yet the FAA alone does not
have the political clout to insist that all countries
coming to the United States must follow the same
procedures. If it tried to enforce this requirement the
FAA would find itself in the middle of a huge foreign
policy wrangle. In fact, several countries have warned
that they will prohibit the FAA from inspecting their
airports if such a law is passed. Without access to these
airports the FAA will be unable to certify whether or not
adequate security procedures are in place to protect US
passengers.

This brings us back to the relevance of treating aviation
security as a national security priority. Eliminating the
gap in security practices and achieving greater
uniformity in security standards requires stronger
federal leadership, starting with the president and the
Congress.

Finally, a critical element in achieving better aviation
security is technology. The mission for protecting
airliners is very simple: do not let unauthorized people
with weapons get on board planes, and do not allow bombs
on board planes. While there is a technological solution
for weapons--guns and knives--there is no similar
technological fix for detecting explosives.

The two best systems on the market for detecting
explosives at airports are dogs and the COX 5000. Mother
Nature still has the edge in explosives detection,
winning by a nose--a dog's nose. But while they are very
effective, dogs are not feasible for handling daily
responsibilities at a high volume airport such as
Chicago's O'Hare or Los Angeles International.

The other option is the CTX 5000, a third generation
x-ray computed tomographic (CT) scanner. Similar to
medical CAT scan technology, the CTX 5000 creates a cross
section image of luggage and analyzes it using
sophisticated software, which automatically identifies
explosives based on their known CT signatures. This is
the only system currently certified by the FAA as an
explosive detection system. One shortcoming of the CTX
5000 is its relatively slow processing speed for bags.
Efficiency could be improved dramatically by using these
units in combination with the airlines' computer
rservation systems to identify passengers whose luggage
needs more scrutiny. The FAA is funding the development
and testing of a computer reservations system that could
be used in conjunction with other security technologies.

Experts agree that presently there are no available
technologies that can be installed in airports that are
reasonably priced, efficient, and reliable. Achieving a
technological solution to the threat of explosives is
feasible but will require a refocused effort. The current
research program under the auspices of the FAA's
Technical Center is spending only $37 million annually to
find a single technology that can meet the operational
requirements of airlines and the security standards of
the FAA. Finding this silver bullet has been an elusive
prey and more difficult task than anyone imagined.

A study commissioned earlier this year by Congressmen
Benjamin Gilman and Lee Hamilton is being conducted by
the General Accounting Office and may provide answers or
recommendations on how to tackle this thorny issue. One
resource that has been ignored in this technological
quest is the national laboratory system. Labs such as
Sandia, Los Alamos, Oak Ridge, and Pacific Northwest are
staffed by scientists and engineers well suited to
looking for answers to these types of questions.
Unfortunately they have not yet been brought to bear on
this issue.

We are moving into a new era of better aviation security.
Because of hard lessons learned from previous terrorist
and criminal attacks the government and industry are
better prepared and in the best position ever to confront
the current threat. Yet the current system is flawed and
additional changes are needed. As the number of
commercial flights continue to expand, the number of
passengers increase, and the next generation of aircraft
are deployed, the vulnerability of the system to
explosives will increase rather than diminish if new
technology is not developed. During the waning years of
the twentieth century, finding a solution to the threat
of explosives will preoccupy government and airline
security officials. It is an area requiring far greater
effort on the part of federal authorities.

Larry Johnson is Vice President for Security Operations
at BGI, Inc., an international consulting firm in
Arlington, VA. Before starting this company he was Deputy
Director for Transportation Security in the Office of
Counterterrorism at the US Department of State. Douglas
Laird is President of Laird & Associates, which provides
international security consulting for the aviation
industry. He previously served as Security Director for
Northwest Airlines, and had a distinguished career with
the US Secret Service. He chairs the ASIS Airlines &
Airports Subcommittee of the Transportation Committee.

"All Hazards" Crisis Management Planning by Geary W.
Sikich

Crisis! Mere mention of the word evokes dread. It seems
you can't turn on the television or pick up a newspaper
anymore without reading about a crisis somewhere. They
can happen anywhere, from faraway countries to the
business around the corner. Yet, crises can be avoided.
Those on the far side of the world may be beyond our
control, but if something happens to your business, it's
your responsibility to solve it. The key is to develop
and implement a well-defined crisis management program.
With one in place, business leaders can mitigate the
potentially disastrous effects of any incident.
Management is never put more strongly to the test than in
a crisis situation. The objectives are immediate and so
are the results. What you and those around you do--or
don't do--will have lasting implications. Today,
individuals responsible for the management of businesses
and public agencies must deal effectively with
increasingly complex laws and issues or face the
consequences.

What if...? You came to your office for the beginning of
your work week and because of some unforseen event there
were no employees, no working telephones, no functioning
computers, no utilities. You're the chief executive. What
would you do? Where would you start? Unquestionably this
is a crisis. Remember, you have access to almost none of
your regular business tools.

If this had been an actual incident, such as many
businesses experienced during the Chicago flood in April
1992, it would already have been too late to concern
yourself with developing a crisis management program!
You've got to have a program in place to ensure
continuity of operations. But, what kind of Crisis
Management Program? To answer this question you must
first define the crisis.

A crisis can be defined as any unplanned event,
occurrence or sequence of events that has a specific
undesirable consequence.

Natural disasters, financial manipulation, societal
disruption, pollution, and stringent regulations are but
a few examples of potential crisis situations. The
reasons for focusing on these issues may result from a
commitment to protect the public, your employees, to
comply with government regulations or to protect the firm
from possible liabilities and litigation. The
consequences for not focusing on these issues can be
disastrous.
Ask yourself why do we need a crisis management program
with an "all hazards" approach? Put simply, such a
program allows you to provide for:
* Effective coordination of activities among the
organizations having a management/response role

* Early warning and clear instructions to all concerned
if a crisis occurs * Continued assessment of actual and
potential consequences of the crisis
* Continuity of business operations during and
immediately after the crisis
A brief synopsis of the common weaknesses in crisis
management planning may prove helpful. As you read the
discussion on the four basic elements, keep these
weaknesses in mind. You may also want to assess your
current crisis management program against these
weaknesses. The most common weaknesses in crisis
management planning are:
* No systematic collection of planning information. This
includes such aspects as hazard analysis, organizational
information, regulatory guidance, company policy
procedures and location-specific data.

* No systematic dissemination of planning information.
You've assembled a wealth of information and have not
shared it with the effected population--those whose
responsibility it is to implement the plan.

* Failure to identify and establish an incident command
structure. This is a common pitfall as many planners try
to fit their organization into a standard incident
command system not designed around their particular
needs.

* Minimal coordination with effected entities. Poor
communications with the community, neighboring
industries, and identified support entities (fire,
police, hospitals, etc.) can lead to confusion and chaos
during an emergency. A simple oversight, such as failure
to designate a primary contact for offsite agencies
during an emergency, can cause major disruption during an
incident.

* Lack of, or poorly defined, organizational
responsibilities. Failure to provide clear, concise
procedures defining a person's functions, duties, and
tasks upon assuming their emergency organization
position. This weakness can lead to finger
pointing--"It's not my responsibility!"--"I thought it
was yours!"

* Once developed, the program is poorly maintained. Your
program was developed to meet a regulatory requirement.
Why should you test it? You're not planning on having any
accidents! Often, there is no provision for continued
evaluation and periodic update of the material.
Frequently, changed material, such as telephone numbers
are buried in various paragraphs throughout the plan.

* The material you developed is not user-friendly. Your
plan contains information--lots of it. Unfortunately, the
user has to be a brain surgeon to figure out his/her role
in its implementation. You did not provide simple,
easy-to-use supplemental materials that can be used as a
quick reference guide during an emergency. Worse yet, you
didn't train anyone on the plan and their role in its
implementation.

* You did not disseminate the plan to the proper
authorities. Failure to include appropriate parties on
the distribution list most often leads to failure on
their part to respond in the manner you had hoped for.

The Plan

You may think that it is too difficult and time consuming
to develop a cohesive crisis management program. However,
when broken down into its basic elements, a plan consists
of only four parts. These are:

*Compliance
*Preparedness
*Training
*Information Management

Although no two crisis management programs are exactly
alike, these are the critical aspects of any plan. We
will discuss each of these aspects briefly.
COMPLIANCE

How do you reduce the vulnerability posed by potential
crises? A system that will advise you of the initiatives
to be addressed is needed. This will allow you to act in
a responsible manner to fulfill the purpose and intent of
existing legislation.
It can also provide a framework for anticipating future
legislation. An effective system for compliance can be
developed only if you know what laws and regulations
pertain to your operation. In order to accomplish this
task, a survey of all operations should be undertaken.
The survey should include:

*General Administrative Information
*Management Awareness and Control Programs
*Identification of Hazards/Potential Crises
*Business Characterization

The ultimate benefits to be gained from this type of
survey are in terms of identifying areas in need of
attention, establishing a list of potential crisis
situations, determining what commitments you are
comfortable with, and documenting current efforts. Once
the survey program has been developed and implemented, it
must be evaluated and kept up-to-date. This can be
accomplished by reviewing actual responses, and by
conducting a detailed audit of each element of the
business.

The survey program is the initial step, toward reducing
vulnerability. Next, you must organize the operation. The
management chain is critical to this process. You must
ensure that all levels of management become part of the
program. This can be achieved in several ways:

* Make a senior manager directly responsible to top
management and the board of directors. The formal
assignment of a senior manager to the position of "Crisis
Management Programs, Director," or some other appropriate
title, can accomplish the initial portion of this item.
Additionally, you will want to establish within the
individual's job description some measurement standard to
evaluate performance. This goes both ways. Upper
management has to take responsibility for developing
measurable and attainable goals for the Program Director
to achieve.

* Set aside specific time for reports on crisis
management preparedness issues. This can be accomplished
by preparing an agenda for senior staff and board of
director meetings that includes a discussion of crisis
management preparedness as a mandatory item. You have to
give it more than lip service, though. Also, you must
make the discussion substantive. Provide more than the
dull and tiring statistics on reportable accidents, etc.
Include all levels of personnel in the presentation
process. This can be very effective and it gets the
message out to all personnel that your company is serious
about crisis management preparedness.

* Make crisis management planning issues part of the
strategic planning process. In one aspect, government
regulations are defining strategic implications for
companies. Additionally, for publicly held companies,
Security and Exchange Commission (SEC), in the section of
the annual report entitled, "Management Analysis and
Discussion," requires a discussion of potential
liabilities. Another perspective on this issue really
begets changing the "corporate culture," i.e., making
crisis management preparedness a part of the way you do
business.

* Communicate compliance through all levels of the
organization using company policy and procedures. This
can be accomplished through formal adoption of policy at
the highest levels of the company. Generally, this will
require the approval of the Board of Directors. It is
essential, however, that companies become more aware of
their responsibilities in these areas--and this is one
way to build the awareness.
This discussion is limited by the space available to a
brief highlight of some approaches that can be
undertaken. Each company will find its situation and
circumstances to be unique to its corporate culture.
Whatever the case, however, an in-depth analysis of your
company's operating environment should be undertaken
before developing a program or attempting to address the
above items.

PREPAREDNESS

Preparedness used in the broadest context means any and
all measures taken to prevent, prepare for, respond,
mitigate, and recover from a crisis. It's with this
perspective that we begin to breakdown the aspect of
preparedness. There are four critical aspects:
*Preparation and Prevention
*Detection and Classification
*Response and Mitigation
*Reentry and Recovery

*Preparation and Prevention: Any set of activities that
prevent a crisis, reduce the chance of a crisis
happening, or reduce the damaging effects of a crisis.
Preparation and prevention activities include, but are
not limited to:

* Development and implementation of the crisis management
program
* Development and implementation of crisis management
plan implementing procedures
* Development and implementation of crisis
management/response training
*Detection and Incident Classification: Actions taken to
identify, assess, and classify the severity of a crisis.
Detection and classification activities include, but are
not limited to:

* Activation of crisis management systems
* Activation of crisis management plan implementing
procedures * Activation of the crisis management/response
organization
*Response and Mitigation: Actions taken to save lives,
prevent further damage and reduce the effects of the
crisis. Response and mitigation activities include, but
are not limited to:

* Crisis management/response organization operations
* Affiliated crisis management/response organizations'
operations * Continuity of business operations

*Reentry and Recovery: Actions taken to return to a
normal or an even safer situation following the crisis.
Reentry and recovery activities include, but are not
limited to:
* Activation of the reentry and recovery organization
* Coordination with affiliated recovery organizations
* Activation of the reentry and recovery plan

TRAINING AND RETRAINING

Training of personnel is the third component of the "all
hazards" approach. The training of the crisis
management/response organization is one of the critical
success factors that must be addressed if an adequate
response is to be achieved. The development of the
compliance program, involvement of all levels of
management, and establishing preparedness is only part of
the overall process. To ensure an adequate response, a
trained organization is required. A "systems" approach to
preparing effective training programs should consist of:

Task Analysis: When designing an integrated training
program, first determine the skills, knowledge, and
procedures required for satisfactory performance of each
task.
Lesson Development: Learning objectives are defined from
the skills, knowledge, and procedures developed during
task analysis. Instructional plans are then prepared to
support the learning objectives.

Instruction: Lessons are systematically presented using
appropriate instructional methods. Instruction may
include lecture, self-paced or group-paced mediated
instruction, simulation, and team training.

Evaluation: Performance standards and evaluation criteria
are developed from the learning objectives. Each
trainee's performance is evaluated during the course and
during field performance testing.

In addition to the formal training program, a program of
proficiency demonstration is also needed. This can be
accomplished by establishing a program that supplements
the training with drills and exercises. The drill program
can vary in degree of complexity.
INFORMATION MANAGEMENT

The need to establish and maintain an ongoing dynamic
crisis management program is essential. The crisis
management process doesn't end just because you finished
the crisis management plan, are in compliance, have
involved management, and trained the staff.
In order to facilitate planning requirements, a record of
all initiatives should be retained. These records serve
to document the accomplishments, requirements,
commitments, and reports relating to various program
requirements. The identification of commitments in the
areas of compliance, emergency preparedness, and training
is vital. The establishment of a defined information
management system structure will ensure that
documentation will be available when needed.

Senior management must be kept well-informed. Information
is a corporate asset. Information is expensive and it
must be shared and managed effectively. Information
management is also critical during a crisis. The need for
active systems to provide information on materials,
personnel, capabilities information on materials,
personnel, capabilities, and processes is essential. It
is extremely important to have a system (and adequate
back-up systems) in place that serves to identify,
catalog, set priorities, and track issues and commitments
relating to crisis management and response activities.
Conclusion

In almost every instance of successful response to a
crisis, management and response activities consisting of
sound operating execution, coupled with superior
communication, predominate. Operational response is
essential. It saves lives, property, and other assets.
The ability to communicate is no less important. It saves
the business.
The simple fact is: perception is reality. Public
perception of your company's reaction to a crisis is as
important as your operating response. Lessons learned in
crises ranging from Three Mile Island nuclear crisis to
the Exxon Valdez oil spill validate the need for a
dynamic crisis management program.

Trust and confidence in the abilities of middle level
management must be established. "How well have my people
prepared?" This question can only be answered
satisfactorily if you have established a level of trust
and confidence, can communicate risk, and are willing to
allow these managers to practice upward management--that
is to delegate up. They must have the ability to
recognize needs and have a process in place that allows
them to delegate up without fear of repercussions.

Few crises will be as dramatic as Three Mile Island or
the Valdez ... unless it is your own. When your crisis
occurs, the hardest part of dealing with it can involve
answering the public call for information--a call
personified by a television correspondent or newspaper
reporter who shows up at your doorstep or on your
telephone line to get the story. How well you respond
depends on how well you are prepared.

HEROES: The US Government's Counterterrorism Rewards
Program by Jack Plaxe

The United States government has many resources at its
disposal which can be used in the fight against
terrorism. Various political, military, and diplomatic
options first come to mind, but there is one that is more
successful--the Counterterrorism Rewards Program of the
Diplomatic Security Service of the US Department of
State. Over the years this program has resulted in the
prevention of numerous terrorist attacks as well as the
apprehension of some of the world's most infamous
terrorists.
The Counter-Terrorism Rewards Program was established in
1984 by the Act to Combat International Terrorism, Public
Law 98-533. In 1986, the Bureau of Diplomatic Security
was legislatively mandated to administer the program
under Public Law 99-399, the Omnibus Diplomatic Security
and Anti-Terrorism Act. While the Bureau of Diplomatic
Security is responsible for the day to day operations of
the program, it does so with policy guidance from the
Office of the Coordinator for Counterterrorism.
Under the Rewards Program, individuals approach the State
Department with information regarding planned terrorist
attacks or details about past incidents.  If a
determination is made that the information provided is
useful, the cooperating individual will be given a
monetary reward. Rewards totaling millions of dollars
have been paid in more than twenty cases. Innocent lives
have been saved and terrorists have been apprehended,
arrested, and put behind bars.

These rewards are substantial. While the program
initially offered rewards up to $500,000, the maximum has
since been increased to $2 million. The only exception to
this is in the case of information provided that prevents
an attack against US civil aviation. In this case,
matching gifts raise the rewards to as high as $4
million.
In addition to providing monetary rewards, the State
Department can also help the cooperating individuals and
their immediate family members relocate to a safe
country.  If the individuals choose to come to the United
States, they can be afforded protection by the Bureau of
Diplomatic Security or placed into the US Marshals
Service Federal Witness Security Program, depending on
the specific situation.
Interagency Rewards Committee

The Director of the Diplomatic Security Service chairs an
interagency committee that identifies reward candidates
and recommends rewards to the Secretary of State. This
committee, known as the Interagency Rewards Committee, is
comprised of representatives from the White House
National Security Council staff, the Central Intelligence
Agency, the Department of Justice, the Federal Bureau of
Investigation, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the
US Marshals Service Witness Security Program, the
Immigration and Naturalization Service, the Federal
Aviation Administration, the Department of Energy, and
the Department of State.

The Interagency Rewards Committee is tasked with
determining which terrorist incidents merit inclusion in
the Program and the amounts that will be paid for
specific information. The Counterterrorist Rewards
Program is currently offering rewards for information
leading to the apprehension or capture of terrorists who
are responsible for some of the most deadly terrorist
attacks against both America and the international
community. These attacks include:

*The bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 - on December 21, 1988,
terrorists destroyed Pan American flight 103 while it was
overflying Lockerbie, Scotland. The aircraft carried 259
citizens from 30 nations, including 189 Americans.
Another 11 citizens of Lockerbie perished on the ground
from the falling debris.

*The bombing of the World Trade Center - on February 26,
1993, a terrorist vehicle bomb detonated under the World
Trade Center in New York City. This attack killed six
innocent people, injured over 1,000 others, and trapped
terrified school children in a smoke-filled elevator for
hours.

*The AK-47 assault at CIA Headquarters - on January 25,
1993, Mir Aimal Kansi allegedly murdered two people and
seriously injured three others by firing an AK-47 assault
rifle into cars waiting at a stoplight near a gate the
CIA headquarters in Virginia.
*The hijacking of TWA Flight 847 - on June 13, 1985
terrorists from Hizballah hijacked TWA Flight 847. During
a violent rampage against passengers and crew, they beat
Navy Seabee Robert Stethem to death, then dumped his dead
body onto the tarmac.
*The bombing of TWA Flight 840 - on April 2, 1986, a bomb
detonated inside the passenger cabin of TWA Flight 840,
killing nine-month-old Demetra Stylian Klug, giving her
the distinction of being one of the youngest victims of
international terrorism.
*The kidnapping and murder of Americans in Lebanon -
During the 1980s, kidnapped American citizens were held
hostage in various locations throughout Lebanon. For long
and painful years, they were chained in the dark, beaten,
and denied medical care. Three were murdered during their
captivity.

These incidents represent some of the worst terrorist
attacks directed against the United States and the
international community. As such, it is only fitting that
the Rewards Program be used to see that the parties
responsible for the attacks are brought to justice.
Rewards Program Successes: An Emphasis on Prevention

During the first four years of the program, the State
Department offered specific rewards for information
leading to the arrest or conviction of those responsible
for specific terrorist attacks. After the bombing of Pan
Am 103 in December 1988, however, new emphasis was placed
on provisions of the law which allowed for payment of
rewards in cases where information led to the
"prevention, frustration, or favorable resolution of
terrorist attacks against United States persons."

Specific reward amounts for particular terrorist
incidents were no longer announced.  Instead, the
Secretary of State was authorized to pay for information
regarding any past, present, or planned future act of
terrorism. This policy reaped benefits during Operation
Desert Storm, during which the Rewards Program was
heavily publicized.
At the start of the Persian Gulf War, an informant in an
East Asian country came forward with alarming information
about a series of terrorist attacks planned by the Iraqi
intelligence service. The terrorists had already surveyed
their intended targets and acquired automatic weapons,
grenades, and high explosives for the attack. The
assaults  were beyond the planning stage and about to be
carried out.
One of the attacks, a planned terrorist bombing and
machine-gunning of airline ticket counters at a major
airport, was scheduled to be carried out within 48 hours.
The cooperating individual provided information which was
essential in thwarting the attacks.  As a result of the
timely receipt of this intelligence information, the
terrorists were stopped by the efforts of US and host
nation authorities. Had the planned attacks proceeded as
planned, many Americans and citizens of our coalition
partners would certainly have been murdered.

The informant and immediate family were relocated to a
safe location within the United States and given a reward
of approximately $500,000 for coming forward and
providing information that saved lives.

Pan Am Flight 103 Investigation

In the course of the Pan Am 103 investigation, forensic
evidence came to light that indicated that Libya was
behind the attack. In November of 1991, indictments were
issued for two Libyans who allegedly routed the suitcase
containing the bomb through the baggage system in Malta.
The two suspects, Lamen Khalifa Fhimah and Abdel Basset
Al-Megrahi, were allegedly Libyan intelligence agents who
worked undercover for Libyan Arab Airlines at the airport
in Malta.

In 1990, a Libyan by the name of Abu Maged Jiacha
defected to the United States.  Jiacha claimed to work
with the two Pan Am 103 bombing suspects at the airport
in Malta. He claims to have had knowledge of their bomb
plans and is believed to have provided investigators with
Fhimah's diary which allegedly contains a handwritten
notation linking him to the attack.

While Jiacha has been said to have provided information
on the Pan Am 103 case to the US government, it is
unclear if this was done through the Rewards Program.
However, he is currently a government witness in the
Federal Witness Security Program. While the two Pan Am
103 bombing suspects remain in Libya, there is little
doubt that Jiacha will play an important role in any
future criminal trial. When that trial may occur is
anyone's guess.

World Trade Center Bombing

On February 26, 1993, international terrorists launched a
bombing attack in downtown Manhattan. A large improvised
explosive device concealed in a cargo van was detonated
in the subterranean garage of the 110-story World Trade
Center complex. It was later learned from one of the
captured terrorists that the intention of the bombing was
to collapse one or both of the twin towers with hopes of
killing tens of thousands of innocent people.

Fortunately, the terrorists did not succeed.  However,
the bomb did destroy the underground parking facility and
resulted in the death of six innocent people and injuries
to over 1,000 others.  Some of the victims in this attack
were young school children who had been visiting the
Trade Center on a class field trip. As smoke from the
explosion billowed upwards, the terrified children were
trapped in one of the tower's elevator for hours.

Some of the terrorists suspected of involvement of the
World Trade Center bombing were quickly apprehended but
others managed to avoid capture. Suspected terrorists
Abdul Rahman Yasin and Ramzi Ahmed Yousef fled the United
States following the bombing. After indictments were
issued for the two, the United States launched a massive
international manhunt for the fugitives. Wanted posters
offering up to $2 million rewards for information leading
to their capture were distributed in a variety of
languages. Multi-language leaflets containing the reward
offers were also sent throughout the world. Even
matchbooks containing photos of the fugitives were
distributed.
In early February, a South African student living in
Pakistan approached security officials at the US embassy
and told them that he knew where Ramzi Ahmed Yousef was
hiding. Yousef was immediately put under 24-hour
surveillance to ensure that he would not manage to escape
a second time. On February 8, 1995 American and Pakistani
authorities moved in on and arrested Yousef. He was
quickly extradited to the United States, where he is
currently awaiting trial in a New York City detention
facility.  It is believed that the student tipped off
American authorities after he had seen a Rewards Program
matchbook with Yousef's photo.

Before his arrest in Pakistan, Yousef was busy planning
and carrying out terrorist attacks in Asia. He is
allegedly responsible for the bombing of Philippine
Airlines flight 434 which resulted in the death of
26-year-old Japanese engineer Haruki Ikegama. This attack
was reportedly a trial run for a simultaneous bombing
attack on eleven American air carriers operating in the
Pacific Rim. Fortunately, Yousef was forced to flee the
Philippines before the attack could be carried out.

Four Million Reasons to prevent Terrorism

While the Counterterrorism Rewards Program has certainly
enjoyed a number of successes over the years, not all of
the details of these successes are publicly available.
The reason for this is that in order for the program to
remain successful, it must continue to attract people who
have a knowledge of the activities of the terrorist
underworld. In order for these people to come forward,
they must be assured of complete confidentiality to
prevent any possible retaliation against them or their
families.  The result of this necessary secrecy is that
the work of the security specialists who work on the
Counterterrorism Rewards Program often goes unnoticed.

According to Diplomatic Security Special Agent Brad
Smith, who administers the program, the lack of
recognition can sometimes be frustrating. However, he has
been  pleased with the public recognition that the
program has received.  In fact, Smith was recently
honored by Tom Brokaw for the work that he has done over
the years to build and nurture the Rewards Program.

In 1990, the State Department forged a unique
public-private partnership with the Air Transport
Association of America and the Air Line Pilots
Association, International. Each organization has agreed
to pledge up to $1 million to supplement the existing $2
million reward paid by the US government for information
that prevents a terrorist act against US civil aviation
or leads to the arrest and conviction of any person who
has committed such an act.  This has resulted in a
maximum reward of up to $4 million in such cases.

This supplemental program came about largely through the
joint efforts of Special Agent Brad Smith and former Pan
American Airline pilot Bruce Smith (no relation). Captain
Smith, whose wife Ingrid was killed in the Pan Am flight
103 bombing, decided to immediately accept Pan American's
settlement offer of $100,000. He tried to convince other
family members who lost loved ones to do likewise so that
they could pool their money to offer a substantial reward
for the capture of the responsible parties. Unfortunately
for Captain Smith, few families followed suit.
After this minor setback, Smith undertook efforts to
lobby the Bush administration and airline trade
organizations to strengthen the Rewards Program. Smith
approached the Air Line Pilot's Association and the Air
Transport Association and convinced them to each pledge
up to $1 million to supplement the existing $2 million
government reward. The reward of $4 million was to be
used in the Pan Am 103 case and other cases involving
terrorist attacks against civil aviation. This $4 million
reward level remains in effect today.

The US government's standing reward offer of up to $2
million applies in all cases not addressed by this unique
partnership agreement. However, Captain Smith and his
attorney Mark Zaid are currently undertaking efforts to
expand the government partnership with private sector
funding sources through the newly created, not-for-profit
Foundation to Combat International Terrorism. The
foundation's main goal would be to provide grants to
supplement the rewards distributed by the Rewards
Program. This would allow the $4 million award level to
be offered outside the sphere of civil aviation and
hopefully entice more people to come forward with useful
information.
According to Zaid, the foundation was created in order to
expand upon the current Rewards Program activities in a
number of areas. For instance, Zaid explained that the
Foundation could assist in publicizing the Rewards
Program in key countries and regions without some of the
political constraints that currently restrain US efforts.
In addition, the foundation would also assist by allowing
the program to provide rewards to those states which
cooperate by providing timely intelligence information to
the United States that prevents terrorist activity. At
the present, states are not eligible to receive rewards
for information under the Rewards Program.

However, the Foundation to Combat International Terrorism
has met with some resistance within certain offices of
the State Department. Elements within the Bureau of
Diplomatic Security support the concept and goals of the
Foundation and have actively supported the idea.
Opposition to the foundation has come primarily from the
Office of the Coordinator for Counterterrorism, headed by
Ambassador Philip Wilcox.
In a letter to Mark Zaid dated October 16, Ambassador
Wilcox and Assistant Secretary for Diplomatic Security
Anthony Quainton wrote that the State Department has
decided not to work with the Foundation because of the
"possible appearance of conflict of interest."

However, this is merely an excuse given to de-emphasize
the real reason for State's decision not to become
involved in the Foundation's work. According to the
letter, Wilcox and Quainton explain that "even as a
separate legal entity the Foundation cannot effectively
be distinguished from your own activities." This is a
reference to Zaid's work to revise the Foreign Sovereign
Immunity law which currently protects state sponsors of
terrorism from legal action by individual United States
citizens. Zaid and others are trying to get changes to
the law which would allow for Americans who have been the
victim of state-sponsored terrorism to have recourse
through the US legal system. The State Department is not
in favor of such revisions to the Sovereign Immunity law
because it would effectively undermine State's ability to
manage foreign relations, a power which it jealously
guards.

Efforts to Publicize the Rewards Program

The State Department maintains an ongoing public affairs
campaign to promote greater awareness of the Rewards
Program. This campaign includes efforts to both inform
the American public about the Rewards Program as well as
to disseminate information regarding available rewards to
those who might have information. Towards these ends,
advertisements have been placed to promote the program in
a variety of media. Print ads in English, Arabic,
Spanish, French, German, and Russian have appeared in
publications as diverse as The New York Times, Al Hayat,
Paris Match, Die Welt, and Pravda. Additionally, public
service announcements featuring entertainment
personalities Charlton Heston, Charles Bronson, and
Charlie Sheen have been widely distributed.
Charlton Heston  "... Real life heroes are ordinary
people who do extraordinary things for their fellow
man--like warning of acts of political violence that
could endanger innocent lives!"

Charles Bronson "... Persons with information about an
act of terrorism can be a hero by saving innocent lives.
The US government, along with associations of pilots and
airlines, is offering up to $4 million dollars for such
information."
Charlie Sheen  "... Confidentiality and protection can be
assured for these heroic people. Are you the next hero?"

In 1994, the Counterterrorism Rewards Program also went
on the Internet. The global reach of the Internet is
ideal for distributing information about the Rewards
Program. According to Special Agent Smith, "several
thousand" messages from people from 68 countries have
been sent to the HEROES electronic mailbox. The address
for the Heroes electronic mailbox is: heroes@clark.net.

At around the same time, the Rewards Program also
launched a site on the Internet's World Wide Web. This
format is useful for the HEROES page because it allows
the State Department to include text about the program,
sound clips of some of the radio and television spots,
and photos of the wanted terrorists. According to Special
Agent Smith, over 250,000 people have downloaded
information from the Heroes World Wide Web site. The URL
for the Heroes Web site is:
http://www.clark.net/pub/heroes/.
Of course, the Counterterrorism Rewards Program can also
be contacted through more traditional channels as well.
Anyone who has information that could be of use by the
Diplomatic Security Service can call a number which is
staffed 24 hours a day, seven days a week by State
Department security personnel. That number is:
1-800-HEROES-1  [1-800-437-6371].

The Rewards Program can also be contacted by mail at :
HEROES, P.O. Box 96781, Washington, D.C. 20090-6781, USA

All information provided to the Counterterrorism Rewards
Program is kept completely confidential.

Terrorism, please write to: Mark Zaid, Esq., 1300 19th

New Terrorism: The Shape of Things to Come by Harvey W.
Kushner, Ph.D.

As we approach the twenty-first century, law-enforcement
authorities will face a number of complicated issues.
Among the most troublesome is the continuing threat of
Middle Eastern terrorism. Although overshadowed by the
blast at the Oklahoma City Federal Center, the World
Trade Center bombing illustrates the seriousness of the
problem. Unfortunately, it is no longer feasible to rely
on past experiences with terrorism as a guide to
implementing future policy. Recent world events have so
altered Middle Eastern terrorism that we now face a
potentially more dangerous adversary that requires us to
rethink and formulate new tactics and strategies.

Out with the Old

The breakup of the Soviet Union deprived the tightly
organized, centrally directed, and usually secular
networks of sophisticated Middle Eastern terrorists of
money, weapons, and safe-havens. Aid from Eastern Europe
dried up as well. Even Syria and Libya, also traditional
sources of money and weaponry, have been lying low
knowing that they can no longer get backing in any
confrontation with the United States from a Soviet Bloc
that no longer exists.

Yasser Arafat himself contributed to the decline in the
old terrorism by making the tactical mistake of siding
with Iraq during the Persian Gulf War. After the Iraqi
defeat, Arafat could no longer expect his Palestinian
Liberation Organization (PLO) to be the recipient of a
form of protection money from the rich and vulnerable oil
states. Just at the same time the oil money stopped
flowing, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency
(UNRWA) cut much-needed financial aid to Palestinian
refugees in the occupied territories. With financial
support on the decline, Arafat's competition, Hamas (the
violent wing of the Islamic Resistance Movement) stepped
up its campaign to discredit his leadership. It is even
arguable that Arafat's troubles moved him to the peace
table with Israel before any fall from power.

The Gulf War also crippled Iraq's worldwide network of
terrorist's activities. Add to this the demise of a
terrorist network run from Tripoli and coordinated by
so-called diplomats operating out of Libyan embassies
around the world. Cuba, Syria, and Algeria also withdrew
from openly encouraging and supporting terrorists. In
short, these traditional actors and sponsors of terrorism
are either so damaged that they have no alternative but
to withdraw from their activities or are trying to
cultivate a new, more diplomatic image.
Credit is also due to the efforts of American
intelligence agencies and other foreign groups in their
proactive counterterrorist activities. These agencies
were instrumental in curtailing the activities of many
terrorist groups like the Red Army faction in Germany and
the Red Brigades in Italy. These left-wing groups were
supportive of the PLO and other secular terrorist groups.

In With the New

A new support center for terrorism in Iran emerged after
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini toppled the Shah in 1979.
Iran immediately set out to export and finance it's
militant fundamentalist message throughout the Muslim
world. It supported militant Islamic fundamentalist
movements in Algeria, Egypt, Jordan, Tunisia, and Sudan.
The impoverished Sudan provided Iran with its first
success. Nearly a decade after the Iranian revolution a
group of military officers and mullahs seized power in
Sudan installing the first Sunni Muslim republic. Sheik
Hassan al-Turabi, the Sorbonne-educated spiritual leader
of Sudan's Sunni Muslims, offered an olive branch to the
Shiite Muslims of Iran. The charismatic Turabi is
committed to ending the bitter historic enmity that has
separated Sunni and Shiite since the seventh century. He
has already been successful in bringing to Khartoum a
series of summit-type meetings with a variety of militant
Islamic fundamentalist groups and terrorist leaders.
Together these leaders have endorsed a terrorist
manifesto containing Machiavellian prescripts for
advancing militant Islamic fundamentalism.

The Shiite Muslim republic of Iran and it's Sunni Muslim
allies in Sudan have pooled their resources. Together
they hope to "Islamize" the Muslim world while embarking
on a systematic campaign of sponsoring international
terrorism. The linchpin of this partnership is oil-rich
Iran which supplies the finances, arms, and trainers from
the Revolutionary Guards and the secret army unit known
as Quds Force. Sudan's contributions to the partnership
include sanctuaries for terrorists and a series of
terrorist camps maintained by Sudan's Popular Defense
Forces (a quasi-military body modeled after Iran's
Revolutionary Guards).

The New Terrorist

Typically, young, uneducated, and unskilled, the new
terrorists come to these Sudanese camps directly from a
life of poverty and repression. They enter with a strong
belief in Islam as the way out of their dismal social
situation. Their militant Islamic fundamentalism is
reinforced by Islamic radicals versed in Koranic studies
and terrorist tactics they learned when fighting
alongside the mujaheddin in Afghanistan. Unfortunately,
the decade-long war against communism waged by the
mujaheddin in fighters turned Afghanistan into a boot
camp for terrorists. Many of the Islamic radicals who
went to do battle against the Soviets wound up experts in
bomb-making and other terrorist tactics. These
troublemakers are now training other Islamic recruits in
terrorist camps throughout Sudan.

Do not be misled into thinking that the absence of
sophisticated training places these students of terror at
a disadvantage. Rather, their religious zeal makes them
more dangerous than the secular, often Marxist-inspired,
Middle Eastern terrorists of the past. Harder to combat
as well. Why? Because they are able to carry out their
terror with more readily available and less-sophisticated
devices. They need not wait for the delivery of high-tech
explosives. They need only consult a number of anarchist
"cookbooks" for the proper ingredients which are in
supply in a wide variety of hardware stores. Look for a
mixture of nitrate fertilizer and fuel oil rather than
plastic explosives such as Semtex or C-4.

Less sophisticated also means less organized than their
secular predecessors, and consequently more difficult to
spot, track, and intercept. In the past, universities
were not only centers for recruiting terrorists but
places that provided sanctuary for networks of terrorists
to organize and spout their terrorist rhetoric. It is
much harder for today's law enforcement agencies to
infiltrate groups that are not organized in any
systematic way.
The new terrorists are easily inspired by religious
beliefs and the suggestions of their spiritual leaders.
The alleged involvement of the blind cleric, Sheik Omar
Abdel Rahman, in the assassination of President Anwar
Sadat of Egypt and the World Trade Center explosion
illustrates the power that a spiritual leader can have on
the actions of these new terrorists. Sheik Rahman's
blindness contributes to his credibility since blind
reciters of the Koran are respected in Islamic societies
for their heightened sensitivity for memorization. It is
often the case that the loss of one sense is compensated
by an increase in another.

Inspiration can also lead to freelance terrorism that
occurs with regularity throughout the Middle East,
especially in Israel. We often read of how a Palestinian
with no history of terrorist activity or group
affiliation randomly stabs or axes an Israeli on the
streets of Tel Aviv. These freelance terrorists are
devoutly religious, highly impressionable, and given to
suggestion. Their acts are almost impossible to
predict--except that they are bound to occur given the
call to fanaticism that echoes through the impoverished
societies of the Middle East.

These new terrorists travel freely throughout the entire
Muslim world. They walk the streets of Pakistan and
congregate in the suburbs of Cairo. The World Trade
Center bombing and the aborted plot to bomb a number of
other landmarks in New York should tell us that they are
here with their well-documented penchant for taking
matters into their own hands. We can count on them to
take action--and we should understand that they will.

What to do?

The new world order has already impacted on our local
law-enforcement agency's ability to protect and serve.
Future occurrences in international politics will do the
same. Today's local law enforcement agencies must
constantly monitor a changing world for potential
terrorism and its likely impact on domestic security.
Today's militant Islamic fundamentalists cannot be
ignored; in fact, it would be wise for all of us to
become familiar with the aspirations of the more than one
billion Muslims worldwide. We have already witnessed a
veritable explosion in the number of individuals
subscribing to the Islamic faith right here in America.

The overwhelming majority of Muslims abhor terrorism.
Nevertheless, we must not be afraid to ask questions of
those who do not. But to make certain that the right
questions are asked, it makes sense to give our law
enforcement personnel cultural diversity training. That
way, there will be fewer problems stemming from any lack
of understanding. After all, there is no way to get
around the fact that millions of Muslims live in the
United States or have regular contacts here either
through family or business. Mutual understanding is the
first step toward countering terrorism.

Justice.

Hidden Crisis: International Crime Imperils South
Africa's Security by Edward V. Badolato Part I

When Nelson Mandela became president of South Africa much
of the world breathed a sigh of relief. Here was a man
who promised a new future to a country long plagued by
racial strife and increasing instability. But there is
also a dark side to the bright future, for beneath South
Africa's youthful democratic face lurks a potentially
deadly disease: the specter of organized crime.

Of course, this is a scourge that afflicts much of the
world today. International crime organizations operate
relatively freely around the globe, reaping huge profits
from the proceeds of their illegal activities and taking
advantage of new technology to insert themselves covertly
into the machinery of national economies. The World Bank
reports that some of these "crime empires" are now worth
far more than the gross domestic products of all the
Middle Eastern and North African countries combined. The
opportunities being presented to international crime
organizations for worldwide illegal operations are
greater today than they have been since the end of World
War II. Over the past five years, international gangs
have greatly benefitted from the changes brought about by
the breakup of the Soviet Union, the introduction of
computerized international banking and finance, and the
general trend toward free trade.
In South Africa this trend is particularly apparent.
Hiding behind burgeoning local crime, South African
syndicates are growing larger all the time, a new
manifestation of the problems which have affected the
United States and the rest of the world in the post-Cold
War period.

Like South Africa, the United States has traditionally
felt that its oceans, great distances, and national
borders provide separation and safety from international
crime. However, the globalization of communications,
transportation, trade, and finance has globalized crime.
The same conditions and mechanisms that support the
expansion of free markets are just as well suited to
bolster the so-called "Four Horsemen of International
Crime"--four key criminal activities that have the
capability to wreak havoc with democratic countries.
These four corrosive factors are: organized crime, drugs,
illicit financial activity, and transportation crime.

In South Africa, the recent movement to political
pluralism, the development of a market economy, and the
end of Soviet and Cuban military intervention in
neighboring countries have provided a new source of hope
for the Southern African region, but it has also enticed
the world's criminal organizations to take advantage of
the opportunities that the new situations provide. From a
US perspective, South Africa's dramatic change and
progress over the past several years must not be given up
to the international gangs that are currently flocking to
southern Africa.

According to South African Police Services (SAPS)
sources, approximately 500 well-armed and financed
organized crime syndicates are now operating in South
Africa. These powerful gangs--some domestic, some from
neighboring African countries, and some from the well
known and powerful international criminal
organizations--are capable of buying and burrowing their
way into public institutions and terrorizing the public
and the South African business community.

The majority of South African gangs are involved in drug
trafficking (136), followed by vehicle theft (112), and
commercial crime (85). Police say that the activities of
the various gangs are closely linked. For example motor
vehicle theft, truck hijacking and robbery are linked to
the illegal arms trade in Mozambique, while drug
trafficking is connected with motor vehicle theft in
Zambia as well as to money laundering and check kiting
schemes.

The US government has important interests in South Africa
that will be adversely affected by the unchecked growth
of these international crime syndicates. American
interests are essentially based on promoting a
democratic, secure, and prosperous South Africa. South
Africa's success in dealing with the various syndicates
will depend partly on reinforcement by the United States
in countering the insidious actions of international
crime organizations--drug smuggling, money laundering,
and their illegal theft and trade activities.

International Criminal Organizations

The world's traditional criminal gangs and mafias are
groups whose primary objective is to gain money and power
by carrying out illegal activities. Organized crime
groups that used to operate only nationally in their own
domestic arena are now forging new global ties and moving
beyond traditional drugs, arms smuggling, and
prostitution into new areas such as trade in nuclear
technology, transport of illegal aliens, and money
laundering.

International gangs are estimated to turn over some $750
billion a year from drug smuggling and other illegal
activities. Organized crime and the financial frauds they
perpetrate are currently considered to be the most
pervasive and sophisticated threats that businesses must
face. A recent survey of top British executives showed
that 55 percent of respondents said they believe the risk
of syndicate fraud will increase in 1995, compared with
only 29 percent who predicted political instability will
increase.
What caused this? Largely the decline of border controls
in Europe and the removal of the severe travel
restrictions that once divided Europe between east and
west. Easy access has created opportunities for the
world's major organized crime syndicates in Italy,
Russia, and Asia to work with their colleagues in South
America and the United States to expand into new markets
and to evolve into truly international crime
corporations.
Russia. The breakdown of the old Soviet police system and
the lack of centralized control in the new Russia has
allowed over 5,000 criminal syndicates to flourish, often
combining their efforts with those of the international
mafia. Russian gangs are complex organizations with
international criminal connections around the world. The
danger posed by Russian gangsters has already reached the
United States. Russians are now frequently apprehended
and put on trial alongside their criminal
associates--members of the US and Italian mafia who,
among other crimes, import large amounts of heroin into
the United States.

FBI Director Louis Freeh agrees that Russian criminal
gangs are "becoming a formidable threat." The FBI has
identified some 220 Russian gangs now operating in 17 US
cities in 14 states. Russian gangs are also established
in 29 foreign countries and maintain contacts with an
estimated 100,000 criminal enterprises around the world.
These range from sophisticated technology smuggling to
illegal immigrant smuggling rings to child prostitution
rings in China and Southeast Asia. Banks with branches in
Cyprus are reported to be handling about $1 billion a
month in laundered Russian funds, according to the
Russian Central Bank.

Actually, the FBI considers that the arrival of Russian
gangs is directly related to much of the drug-related
violence in urban America. Most Russian gangs initiate
operations in the United States by entering the country
on normal business visas and then stay on illegally when
their visas expire. The number of Russians entering the
United States has risen dramatically. In 1988 only 8,000
Soviet citizens entered, but in 1994 the number rose to
140,000.

The FBI is concerned about these large numbers of
Russians entering the country because ongoing criminal
cases show that there is a lot of involvement in
organized crime, especially in working with the Italian
Mafia to import narcotics. Last year, FBI Director Freeh
and Russia's top law enforcement officials agreed on a
cooperative program to combat organized crime, swapping
information, training and law enforcement personnel--in
Freeh's words "a police-to-police bridge."
Art collectors, police, and insurers are also
increasingly blaming organized crime--especially the
Russians and Eastern European gangs--for the rapid growth
in fine art theft in Europe. Worldwide, some $3 billion
worth of art and valuable objects are currently missing,
and much of the cause can be placed on organized crime.
Frequently, US sting operations against organized crime
gangs recover stolen art among shipments of drugs,
contraband, and stolen art.

Chinese Triads. China's triads have developed a thriving
export business that includes trade in people. Chinese
gangs may make up to $3.5 billion annually from exporting
their compatriots searching for a better life at $35,000
per head. Chinese Triads have developed a complex
international network to smuggle their refugees into the
United States and Europe with major transit points in
Russia and Latin America. The Triads have set up
operations in South Africa, and its only a matter of time
until they expand their other activities there, including
an interest in South Africa's emerging casino industry.
The New Jersey state Casino Control Commission is
currently investigating the activities of members of
Asian organized crime syndicates and reports that there
is a distinct possibility that the Asian mobsters have
infiltrated the industry. In typical understatement,
police officials have said that Chinese Triad interests
in South Africa have "become more apparent."

Taiwan. Not all illegal activity takes place in mainland
China and Hong Kong. Some opposition leaders in Taiwan
say that while their organized crime problems are hardly
new, crime families have gained influence with the
blossoming of Taiwan's democracy. The Ministry of Justice
reported in late 1994 that one-third of Taiwan's 858
elected city and county councilors have criminal records.

Japanese Yakuza. The Yakuza, Japan's principal organized
crime syndicate, has shown a remarkable ability to
respond to changing circumstances. After World War II it
did what criminals do best--straight violence. In the
late 1950s, the Yakuza turned to debt collection, and in
its next phase, the Yakuza zeroed in on the public
officials who regulated them. The high-growth 1980s
launched the gangs on a fourth phase of corporate
operations, this time focused on manipulating the stock
market, bank fraud, and real estate swindles. This
current Yakuza campaign against the business world is
on-going today, and the gangs are growing more and more
clever.
Although the Yakuza prefer to operate in a low-key
manner, it is capable of violence, as shown by the 1994
murder of Kazufumi Hatanaka, head of the Nagoya branch of
Sumitomo Bank. The Sumitomo Bank had been accused of
cutting ethical corners, and there have been a number of
complex and questionable financing transactions between
Sumitomo and underworld organizations. The Japanese
government has been clamping down on the Yakuza through
the enforcement of the Organized Crime Law of 1992, but
the gangs have shown that they are extremely difficult to
put out of business.
Fraud and Money Laundering

Employee-related fraud in South Africa is on a par with
the worst countries in the world, according to risk
insurers with Lloyd's of London, and it is seen by
international observers as being as bad as in South
American countries, such as Colombia. The frequency and
size of fraud claims in South Africa has more than
doubled in the past three years. Some players in the
local financial markets will no longer provide fidelity
guarantee cover--insurance against employee fraud--for
financial institutions. The increase in fraud claims are
blamed on higher stock values, the growing sophistication
of criminal gangs, increased computerization, and
political uncertainty. In August 1995 there was a total
of $6 billion in fraud cases under investigation by SAPS,
and some risk managers say that this is just the tip of
the iceberg.

It is the sheer volume of money that ties together the
various forms of international crime and links them all
with legal business. The US Treasury Department estimates
there is an enormous, several trillion-dollar pool of
money that dashes around in what is effectively
international cyberspace, moving by computer in and out
of offshore banks and chasing profits in 24-hour markets,
all largely beyond the reach of government control. Of
this total amount, it is estimated that there is between
$100 billion and $300 billion of dirty money circling the
globe at any one time, looking for a home, looking to
merge into the legal economy, looking for deals that may
be legal, and some that are not legal.
South Africa's banking and financial system has a
reputation as one of the world's solid professional
operations--the Johannesburg Stock Exchange is the
world's tenth largest. Yet the emergence of the new South
Africa and the transition from the previous government's
system of controls and operations has presented some
problems. As South African banks rejoined the
international business community, they arrived at a time
when illegal money laundering was at an all time high,
and crime syndicate money managers were on the lookout
for any easy opportunity to launder their cash.
Because there was no obligation for South African
financial institutions to report any suspicion of money
laundering, the banking community learned that it was a
prime target for the international crime organization's
financial networks. Banks quickly realized that this was
not a time for business as usual, and they had to react
swiftly to ensure the integrity and ethics of their
operations.

Hidden Crisis: International Crime Imperils South
Africa's Security by Edward V. Badolato Part II

Globalized money laundering is a profound challenge to
national sovereignty. Offshore banks and other means of
laundering allow businesses to evade taxes and national
regulations and provide the money to lubricate the
bribery and corruption that makes their activities
possible. This is a security threat that neither of the
traditional security responses--the legal system and
police operations--can really meet. Getting the money
laundering problem under control will require cross
border cooperation and an unprecedented degree of
cooperation between the government and the private
sector.
The US dollar is presently the currency of choice for an
increasingly powerful collection of drug lords and their
rogue financial advisors bent on manipulating the global
financial order. The financial managers for the top drug
cartels, especially the highly skilled money launderers
for the Colombian, Brazilian, and Mexican cartels, are
transferring huge quantities of funds each day around the
international banking system.
In the wake of tough US banking regulations, most drug
money laundering operations now generally involves one of
four methods: first by smuggling profits directly out of
the country by stashing them in industrial shipments or
appliances bound for Latin America where the Cali cartel
or their agent can get easy access to the cash. Second,
breaking down large amounts of cash into smaller
increments that need not be reported to federal
regulators. Third, many laundering operations set up
elaborate commercial fronts, washing the money through
complex layers of seemingly innocent transactions.
Finally, some laundering operations are unbelievably
unsophisticated as they take hundreds of thousands of
dollars to a friendly employee at the bank, fill out
deposit slips and deposit the cash. Recently a Citibank
assistant manager in New York was caught cooperating with
a worldwide group that has laundered hundreds of millions
in drug money back to Colombia.

The US government has been focusing on new technologies
and software programs that can track the flow of money in
and out of a country. For example, in the United States,
companies and banks must report cash transactions of
$10,000 or more. This information is used by the Treasury
Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network
(FINCEN), a financial tracking organization that plays an
important role in combating money laundering crimes, as a
database to track transactions. Such anti-money
laundering operations are reported to have driven the
cost of laundering US drug proceeds from six percent in
the late 1980s to 26 percent of today's gross profits.
This has been borne out by some recent interviews with
captured drug kingpins who said that it was costing them
$260,000 to move each $1 million out of the United
States.
However, because the Treasury Department concluded that
some of the record-keeping and reporting rules in place
to stop money laundering were bureaucratic and
ineffective, and sharp cuts have been made in the
information that banks must keep on large ($10,000 and
above) cash transactions. This is not giving the
launderers a free ride, because at the same time they
removed much of the bureaucratic red tape, the Treasury
Department tightened the rules on the real problem
areas--those governing electronic money transfers among
currency exchanges, casinos, brokerage firms, and banks
to require the keeping of records about the sources and
recipients of the transfers.
Banks in other areas of the world are also improving
their oversight operations. For example, controls and
staff training has recently been introduced by the Hong
Kong Association of Banks to help its members combat
money laundering. Hong Kong is a prime target for hiding
sources of illicit funds because of its location, trading
policies and sophisticated markets.

Credit card fraud is also a serious organized crime
related problem in the United States--and it may also
become so in South Africa as that country takes on more
of the technological trappings of the Western world.
Credit card fraud losses for major card players in the
United States has increased to about $1 billion a year,
much of which is attributed to Nigerian gangs. As a
result, the credit card industry has taken drastic
measures to curb fraud and to wage war against organized
crime, which uses card fraud to finance illegal
activities. Countermeasures include use of
fraud-detection software to enable issuers to determine
if someone is making unauthorized transactions,
incorporating a unique secret code in the card's magnetic
stripe to detect altered data at the time of
authorization, new chip cards, and education on proper
card acceptance procedures.

The Drug Trade

The global drug trade's illegal income makes up the major
portion of the $750 billion taken in by the major
international crime organizations each year. Indications
are that South Africa, and in particular Johannesburg, is
rapidly becoming the southern anchor of an African drug
triangle involving Nigeria in the northwest and Sudan in
the northeast. South African customs officials are
concerned that Johannesburg International Airport (JAI)
is becoming a major distribution point for cocaine moving
to the European market.
The chief of the narcotics bureau at JAI, Colonel
Stefanus Smit, says that "the quantity of cocaine coming
through has increased at an incredible rate." Smit has
only a 13-man staff to monitor the 3,000 international
travelers per day at the airport. Police sources claim
that South American cartels are now using South African
drug couriers out of Johannesburg because they draw less
suspicion as they travel to Europe and the United States.
The South African couriers are flown to a Latin American
city, such as Rio de Janeiro, supplied with drugs, and
then flown to Nigeria or another West African country.
After a few days they travel into South Africa, taking
advantage of soft security at border crossing points.

The drug cartels operating in South Africa, like their
American counterparts, must be able to launder these
funds skillfully to pay their underlings, to run their
massive and intricate transportation systems, and to
distribute the extensive numbers of bribes required to
keep their system going.

Transportation Crime

Around the world, trade is growing twice as fast--and
foreign direct investment four times as fast--as national
economies. South Africa's transportation system is
presently in this high growth situation with increased
road traffic, increased rail shipments, and increased
maritime shipments. For example, the port of Capetown
forecasts an increase of over 50 percent in international
container shipments next year. International trade and
exports are a major factor in South Africa's economic
future. This intense competition for the growing volume
of money, goods, and services moving across borders and
through ports can place South African officials under
tremendous pressure to make sure they move the goods and
commerce swiftly, hence encouraging the relaxation of
bottlenecking regulations and controls internally and at
borders.
International crime syndicates love to work a busy
transportation system, where they can operate "in the
seams" with little chance of apprehension. We have
learned a lot about this in the United States where
international thieves have found cargo theft so
profitable and the likelihood of arrest so slight that
some gangs have switched from drug smuggling to cargo
crime. The United States has worked hard to combat cargo
theft, yet the total dollar loss from all modes of
transportation approaches $10 billion annually. If this
is the case in the United States, South Africa must take
care that its cargo operations do not become a sitting
duck for international cargo crime syndicates.
However, it appears that international crime syndicates
have already begun to focus on South Africa. Law
enforcement officials credit the increase in organized
crime in South Africa to the stricter laws and control
measures now in place at points of entry in Europe and
America, renewed international trade interest, South
Africa's strategic location astride the major Far
East-Middle East and Atlantic shipping routes, its first
world infrastructure, and its re-entry into the
international arena.
In the United States, some of the conditions that allow
international transportation crime to flourish have been
created by conscious choice. For example, at one of the
busiest Mexican border crossings, customs officials are
told to spend no more than one minute examining each
northbound tractor-trailer in order to prevent huge
12-hour traffic jams. This and other programs to speed
the cross border traffic, has been a bonanza for drug
smugglers.  Another problem is within the ranks of
transportation workers themselves. In the United States,
many instances of cargo theft involve insider cooperation
or information. In one major airport that had high theft
rates, it was discovered that at least 70 percent of the
staff that worked on the tarmac had previous arrest
records. In other areas strong unions in port areas with
high theft rates refuse to allow increased exit searches
and controls.

And while the volume of air freight is exploding, new
rules make the government liable for damage caused to
perishable goods--flowers, food, animals--by inspection
delays. So what could be more natural than to use these
same shipments, especially those moving through the
busiest airports, to smuggle drugs and other contraband?
The largest volume of air cargo in the United States
passes through busy Miami Airport. It is the gateway to
Latin America, and perishable air freight cargoes such as
flowers (82 percent of the flowers imported into the
United States originate in Colombia) pass through Miami
airport. Airport officials have had to deal with the
challenge of smuggling drug shipments in the flowers and
other cargos. Additionally, Miami is the largest port of
entry for the French perfume industry. Last year, theft
of expensive shipments of fragrances by organized crime
got so bad that an FBI Task Force had to be formed.
The US Department of Justice reported that Colombian
nationals, together with Peruvians, Ecuadoreans, and
Chileans, have formed large-scale cargo theft gangs.
Particularly with the Ecuadoreans, multi-million dollar
tractor trailer thefts of cargo were occurring at
numerous terminals all along the East Coast. When
apprehended and questioned, the thieves were found to be
members of drug cartels which switched from the illegal
drug business because they found stealing cargo safer and
easier than smuggling drugs.

Vehicle Hijacking and Theft

Because of the vacuum caused by police reorganization,
international organized crime has quickly moved into
South Africa's extensive vehicle theft operations.
According to Police Commissioner George Fivas, in 1994
over 80,000 vehicle were stolen, including a huge number
of commercial trucks and cargos. There have been 36
hijacking-related murders of drivers in the first half of
1995. The crime syndicates are currently managing to stay
one step ahead of the outgunned and undermanned police,
and are increasingly using the cross-border theft of
vehicles and cargo to finance drug shipments in a network
of criminal activity involving Lesotho, Tanzania,
Zimbabwe, and Zambia. Police have recently recovered
stolen South African vehicles as far away as Australia,
Portugal, Greece, and Cyprus.

There is some hope for the grim picture of rampant
transportation crime thanks to the determined efforts of
The Transportation Crime Sub-committee of South Africa's
National Crime Combatting Council, which was founded in
1994 to establish a partnership between the South African
police and all elements of the transportation business
sectors for the fight against transportation crime. The
American experience has shown that public and private
groups like this must have dedicated government support
if they are to be successful.

Solutions

Around the world, organized crime is rapidly expanding to
take advantage of post-Cold War opportunities.
International crime syndicates are adding to their
traditional illicit activities by using their vast
financial resources and sophisticated command of
technology to move huge amounts of ill-gotten, but
effectively laundered money around the world in seconds,
to steal sensitive proprietary information for unlawful
purposes, and to infiltrate legitimate businesses. It
appears that this trend will increase unless strong
cooperative international measures are taken.

South African police forces are currently out-gunned and
out-manned. A key factor why organized crime is
flourishing in South Africa may be because police forces
are too poorly paid and equipped to fight the
international criminal gangs taking up residence there or
to resist the corruption of overpowering financial
temptations and bribes. SAPS sources admit that they lack
the structure, resources, finances, and technical
resources to cope with large-scale organized crime. Some
organized crime groups already have state-of-the-art
equipment and communications systems, most of which puts
South African law enforcement technologies to shame.

The international criminal organizations are evolving
into a new breed of cyberspace crook.     Trends in South
Africa indicate that the top participants in future
criminal organizations will be educated, highly
sophisticated, computer-literate individuals who can
wield state-of-the-art information technology to the best
advantage, for themselves and their criminal
organizations. To be effective, law enforcement
organizations must recruit and train the same caliber of
individuals.
International economic and law enforcement organizations
are only now beginning to deal with the problem. Within
the last year a spate of international conferences on the
drug trade, bribery and official corruption have begun to
at least talk about the issues. The European Union is
setting up a Europe-wide police intelligence agency, and
the FBI has made international cooperation one of its
highest priorities. The next meeting of the Group of
Seven top industrial nations is scheduled to produce the
outline of a new economic architecture that can
collectively deal with terrorism, organized crime and
drug trafficking.

Affected countries like South Africa have begun top level
public-private efforts to combat international crime. In
South Africa, the Council of South African Bankers and
Business South Africa hosted "A Business Initiative
Against Corruption and Crime" in August 1995 that was
attended by President Nelson Mandela and most of the
top-ranking government, security, and business
executives. The conference has an ambitious action plan
which will provide a South African road map for guiding
the struggle against criminal elements.

The continuing fight against international crime
organizations will involve increased international
cooperation and new regulations to improve law
enforcement operations. Finally, countries must work
together to tighten their laws to prevent criminal
organizations from benefiting from international
loopholes. New laws should be introduced where necessary
to strengthen the hand of local law enforcers and ease
international coordination of operations against
international syndicates. States also should exchange
information and experience to increase the level of
international cooperation. South Africa is a prime
example of what can happen in other emerging democratic
countries with expanding economies.

Libya and the Pan Am 103 Bombing: The Department of
Justice Sends a Message  by Douglas Kash

On May 18, an American consultant for the nation of Libya
was arrested outside of a Washington, DC, hotel for
violating US sanctions against Libya. William Bodine was
charged for arranging meetings with executive branch
officials to help foster the normalization of relations
with the United States.

Libya refuses to release Abdel Basser Ali Al-Megrahi and
Lamen Khalifa Fhalmah, both suspected of planting the
explosives aboard Pan Am flight 103 in December 1988.
Economic and diplomatic sanctions against Libya,
initially imposed in 1986, were broadened after the
bombing, including a provision prohibiting normalization
of relations until the suspects are extradited to Great
Britain or the United States for prosecution. According
to a supporting affidavit by a US Customs Service agent,
Bodine met on June 16, 1992, with an unnamed employee of
the Bush administration's National Security Council to
discuss the sanctions. The affidavit specifies that
others were contacted, including National Security
Adviser Brent Scowcroft and former adviser Robert
McFarlane.

Bodine also allegedly arranged a meeting between Libyan
Treasury Minister Mohammed El Bukhari and a "Texas
businessman" who sources identify as real estate
executive Trammel Crow. Bukhari had hoped that, in
addition to a Dallas land deal, the Crow family influence
might lead the way to Washington.

Authorities allege that Bodine set up a branch of the New
York-based Investment Advisory Group in the British
Virgin Islands and opened a Swiss bank account to receive
$8 million per year in separate $460,000 payments to
"consult" on behalf of Libya. A search of the Dallas
office of Bodine's son-in-law, Henry Billingsley,
allegedly uncovered a roll of undeveloped film of Bodine
at a site in Libya bombed by the United States in 1986.

In a related development, on October 17, Libya abandoned
its candidacy for the "North Africa" seat on the United
Nations Security Council, claiming that the UN had become
a tool of the United States. Arguing that it would have
been unconscionable for a state presently under UN
sanction to fill a vacancy, the United States, Britain,
and France campaigned against Libya and gathered enough
votes to prevent Libya from obtaining the two-thirds
majority of the General Assembly required to win
election.

Senate Provides More Relief for Victims of Terrorism by
Douglas Kash

On June 6, the Senate passed legislation aimed at
increasing federal powers to prevent and combat
terrorism. In a 91-8 vote Senate bill S. 735--known as
the "Comprehensive Terrorism Prevention Act of 1995."
Title X of the bill, "Victims of terrorism Act of 1995,"
provides that the director of the FBI is entitled to make
grants to states in order to provide compensation and
assistance to residents of those states who, while
outside the territorial boundaries of the United States,
are victims of terrorism or mass violence, but are not
otherwise eligible for compensation under the Omnibus
Diplomatic Security and Antiterrorism Act of 1986. (See,
"Where to turn? Compensating the Victims of Terrorism,"
Counterterrorism & Security, Spring 1995). They also
provided the same compensation and assistance package for
victims of domestic terrorism. The FBI director may also
provide funds to the US Attorney's office for use in
coordination with state victims compensation and
assistance efforts in providing emergency relief.
Even more recently the Senate Judiciary Committee and its
counterpart in the House offered their respective changes
to the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA) of 1976 to
enable victims of terrorism to sue the governments
responsible. The Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act
generally prohibits lawsuits against a foreign country by
US citizens unless the injury is directly related to the
foreign government's business in the United States.

Distinct from the Victims of Terrorism Act of 1995, the
Senate amendment to the FSIA limits the Act to countries
listed by the State Department as sponsors of terrorism
such as Libya, Iraq, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, and Syria.
The House version would permit a suit against any country
whose legal system does not offer foreigners an adequate
legal remedy, such as Saudi Arabia. Under this remedy,
victims of terrorism could win damages in US courts if
they are unable to gain compensation in the courts of the
country involved.

Sri Lanka: Terrorism in Perspective by Tom Marks

A fine line separates terrorism from forms of violence
based upon mass mobilization. The problem for security
forces is that, early on, armed challenges to government
control appear more or less the same. Hence systemic
response to "terror," normally based upon force, more
often than not is inappropriate. Most commonly, abuse of
the populace creates a new dynamic which allows an
operationally astute terrorist organization to mobilize
additional support.

It is this process which makes the ongoing struggle in
Sri Lanka of more than passing interest. Prior to the
July 1983 explosion of communal violence which serves as
the starting point for the conflict's intense phase, best
evidence indicates that the number of Tamils actually
engaged in violence amounted to no more than 50-60
hardcore individuals who traveled freely between India
and Sri Lanka. These activists were assisted by a network
of informers throughout the north. Violence was limited
to the Jaffna area, the main base of Tamil resistance
situated on the island's northern tip.
July 1983's wholesale assault upon the Tamil populace by
enraged Sinhalese mobs, combined with the inability or
unwillingness of the security forces to protect them,
proved the turning point. What might have remained a
terrorist threat exploded into insurgency. In the months
that followed, the resistance movement underwent a
dramatic expansion in strength and areas of operation. By
mid-1984 total numbers of separatists were estimated at
2,500-5,000 personnel, with probably at least half armed
and equipped. Today, insurgent strength may go as high as
15,000, with a divided, amateurish resistance having been
replaced by the well-trained, disciplined, and armed
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), or "Tigers."

How much different would the situation have been had a
force and an approach been at hand to deal correctly with
the situation!

 Background to the Conflict

Ironically, as a democracy, Sri Lanka would have seemed
theoretically positioned to address popular grievances
adequately. But following independence from Britain in
1948, the new nation's highly centralized, unitary state
ensured domination of the polity by the nearly
four-fifths majority of Buddhist, Sinhala-speaking
Sinhalese (roughly a fifth of the population were
Tamil-speaking Hindus).

Several groups sprang up to press for redress of Tamil
grievances. In the center was the Tamil United Front
(TUF), formed in 1972 and calling autonomy. On the left
side of the political spectrum the Tamil Students
Federation (TSF) advocated more radical solutions, such
as independence. The most radical group came to be known
as the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), an armed
separatist group committed to insurgency.
In 1978 fighting erupted between the LTTE and the army,
causing the government to declare the group illegal on 19
May 1978. The government was also empowered to proscribe
any organization which advocated the use of violence and
which was directly or indirectly connected with any
unlawful activity.

But the military lacked a counterterror capability.
Indeed, its total ground strength was effectively
contained in five infantry battalions. The capability for
intelligence-gathering and surgical application of force,
in other words, was all but lacking at this time in Sri
Lanka. The advantage lay with the terrorists.

Violence escalated, and by the early 1980s terror
incidents by the Tamils unleashed spasms of communal
conflict -- one ambush in Jaffna, in which 13 soldiers
died, prompted widespread rioting and looting directed
against Tamils. At least 400 persons were killed and
100,000 left homeless; another 60,000 fled to India.
Police stood by, and in many cases members of the armed
forces participated in the reprisals.
The violence served to traumatize the Tamil community and
provided the Tigers with an influx of new manpower. Thus
the ascendancy of radical leadership in the struggle for
Tamil Eelam was complete. Both the militants and the
authorities recognized that, for the moment, the conflict
would take the form of a military test of strength. The
government reacted by improving coordination and
strategic direction through the formation in March 1984
of a Ministry of National Security, headed by Lalith
Athulathmudalai, in effect a command center for the
conduct of a counterinsurgency campaign. Expansion of
numbers and equipment for all of the security forces was
undertaken, as were steps to tighten discipline and to
halt abuses of the population.

The small size of the Sri Lankan security forces made
such steps imperative. Though Athulathmudalai clearly
intended to conduct a counterinsurgency in the British
mode, with military measures deriving direction from the
overall thrust of a political solution, the very size of
the emerging separatist armed threat made forceful
military measures inevitable. But without substantive
movement towards the framing of particulars in a
political option, there was a danger that military
suppression would become an end unto itself.

This is precisely what occurred. Even a police Special
Task Force (STF), formed in 1984 specifically for a
careful, nuanced approach to "counterinsurgency," quickly
became but another aggressive unit in a general
deployment to combat. Escalation of hostilities led to
conflict nationwide, eventual Indian intervention in July
1987, and the complete domination of the "liberation
struggle" by the LTTE, which proclaimed itself
Mrxist-Leninist.
Only with the election of a coalition headed by the Sri
Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) in August 1994, followed by
the November presidential victory of SLFP leader
Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga -- these polls ending
17 years of United National Party (UNP) power -- was
politics allowed to drive the military response to the
problem. A three-month cease-fire, during which Colombo
sought to frame a solution acceptable to all parties,
ended when the LTTE launched attacks on government
forces. These included use of underwater assets to
destroy navy ships, as well as introduction of SA-7
surface-to-air missiles into the conflict. The latter
were used to down several air force transports, later at
least one helicopter. Armor was already in use by both
sides. What had begun as a campaign by terrorists had
grown to conventional civil war.
Security Force Options

In mid-1995, therefore, the government held a series of
meetings designed to settle upon a national strategy for
ending the conflict. Incredibly, no such step had
hitherto been taken. These meetings, of which there were
at least three primary sessions, did not go well. The
government itself, as the meetings progressed,
articulated a plan for devolution which came close, in
all but name, to abandoning the unitary state in favor of
a federal system. Yet while all official bodies basically
agreed that the Tigers would have to be defeated
militarily in order for the political solution to be
implemented, there was disagreement on the plan of
operations.

On one side were those who saw no option but to end the
LTTE hold on Jaffna by direct assault. The principal
advocate of this approach was Anuruddha Ratwatte, a
presidential relative and, effectively, Minister of
Defense (he was actually the Deputy Minister, but the
President herself was the Minister, so Ratwatte ran the
security forces). He was joined by a body of military
officers who felt the effort had to be made. Opposed was
an equally distinguished and senior body of officers,
both active and retired, who demurred. They cited the
considerable success which had been achieved by the
systematic domination of areas using force to shield
restoration of government control. This approach, they
argued, while much slower, would be ever less costly in
lives and financial resources.

The former category was obvious, since any assault on
Jaffna would involve the taking of hardened,
well-defended positions. The latter point was equally
important, though, because by 1995 interest payments to
service government debt were of themselves 29.9 percent
of current expenditures, with a figure of close to 48
percent reached if amortization and interest payments
were included under debt service. High intensity
operations, regardless of purely military considerations,
were bound to worsen this financial situation.

So bitter became the debate that at least one key
commander, Brigadier Janaka Perera of the Reserve Strike
Force (RSF), was summarily relieved in consequence of the
tone and substance of his objections. He opted to accept
a brigade command in the extreme northeast rather than
retire. In all of this, the army commander, Lieutenant
General Gerry de Silva -- like Perera, a Sandhurst
graduate -- found himself very much in the middle. His
important contribution after assuming command on 1
January 1994 had been to rationalize the command and
control structure of a force grown to 76 infantry
battalions alone (drawn from three sources -- active,
reserves, and national guard). With his own staff divided
on the merits of a Jaffna assault, he was torn between
demands from above that he lead the charge and from below
that he back another course of action.
Perera's arguments were illustrative of the proposed
alternatives. He advocated continuing systematic
domination of areas while taking the battle directly to
the insurgents using special operations. These were the
tactics he had used successfully in the south during the
resurgence of a Sinhalese communist group, Janatha
Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP, "People's Liberation Front"). A
previous effort by the JVP to seize power in 1971 had
been bloodily suppressed, but the group had gained new
life in the wake of India's July 1987 military
intervention in Sri Lanka as a "peacekeeping force."
Portraying itself as the representative of Sri Lankan
nationalism, the JVP convulsed the Sinhalese areas of the
country before being destroyed. Perera played a crucial
role in breaking the JVP by capturing a number of its key
personalities, to include its head, Rohana Wijeweera.

As his weapon, Perera made use of a special forces
brigade which grouped together units of the commandos and
special forces. These, like most of Sri Lanka's military
forces, had developed in step with the Tamil insurgency.

While the threat was still terrorism -- with attacks
including strikes against Colombo's commercial air links
-- a small commando force had been formed. It had but two
squadrons, one devoted to rapid response missions,
principally anti-hijacking, the other to VIP security. As
actual hostilities progressed, the commandos found
themselves active in counterguerrilla operations as well.

The shortage of such personnel led to the formation of a
separate Special Forces Regiment, primarily for jungle
operations. Leaving permutations aside, the end result
was that both the commandos and the special forces
eventually evolved into forces of two battalions each
(these with approximately 450 men rather than the
standard infantry 600 strength), brought together in a
special forces brigade.
During his four-year tenure as special forces brigade
commander, Perera expanded its operations into a variety
of unconventional areas, including airmobile assault and
undercover work. There was even one squadron which used
motorcycles during its operations.

When Gerry de Silva formed a reserve strike force in July
1994 as an integral part of his refining of the command
structure, Perera was picked to lead it. Under him were
not only the four battalions which had been in the
special forces brigade but also six infantry battalions,
mechanized and airmobile, and three armor battalions. As
such it was an elite strike force which could respond in
virtually any fashion to a threat anywhere in the theater
of operations. It was also the force Perera lost when his
blunt assessment of the planned Jaffna operation cost him
his job.

Exile, in any event, proved brief. When the actual
assault on Jaffna was launched in October of this year,
Perera was recalled to command the cutting edge of the
attack. Certainly his concerns, as well as those of
others who shared his opinion, had not changed, but all
were unwilling to sit on the sidelines as the security
forces locked horns in fierce battle with the LTTE.

The Future

Jaffna fell to government forces in early December,
bringing the conventional phase of combat to a close. But
the war is certainly not over. Problems remain --
problems that should have been addressed in the earliest
stages. From a lesson-learned perspective, the fighting
clearly illustrates how a terrorist threat of minor
proportions progressed to a multi-divisional assault upon
a heavily fortified built-up area, using all the arsenal
of conventional combat -- air power, artillery, and
armor, among others. The Tigers even have reportedly
employed homemade chemical weapons.

The ferocity that the struggle has gained over the years
cannot be understated. Many of the principal
personalities involved, to include both the presidents of
Sri Lanka and India, have fallen in the process.

Neither should the complexity of the task as it has
developed be underestimated. A Third World state has in a
dozen years been forced to create, support, and deploy a
force with nearly twice the infantry battalions available
to the likes to the United Kingdom. It has done so at
heavy human and financial cost. The rearming for the
present Jaffna offensive alone is estimated to have run
up a bill of some $500 million.
What is sobering, though, is that the security dynamic
has scarcely changed since battle was joined. The debate
within the Sri Lankan command concerning the attack on
Jaffna, for instance, was not on the necessity of taking
out that insurgent center but rather on the means and the
timing. Assessing its own political situation, as well as
that of its opponents, Colombo decided that it could not
adopt the long haul approach. It was well understood that
the attack would be costly and that insurgent elements
would certainly seek to relocate elsewhere in the country
to continue the fight.
Preparations were thus made to safeguard the gains made
in the east and "near north" (that area south of Jaffna),
those Tamil-populated areas which remain in contention,
as well as to secure the Sinhalese rear area itself.
These have been mostly successful, at least on the
surface, though Tiger attacks succeeded in destroying oil
stores in Colombo and in massacring a number of Sinhalese
villages.

Whether the cost of the Jaffna assault -- thousands of
casualties had already resulted at the time of this
writing -- proves commensurate with the results will
depend upon the government's follow-up. Among the many
ironies of the war is the fact that at no time has a
majority of Tamils lived in the so-called "Tamil
homelands." This has become even more the case as the
years have gone by.

The ceasefire and its subsequent violation by the Tigers
has served the useful purpose of exposing once again,
both domestically and internationally, the fact that
revolution as opposed to reform is the LTTE aim.
Consequently, not only has there been a decided shift in
international circles away from the sympathetic tilt of
many towards the Tigers, there has also been an upsurge
in numbers of Tamil civilians fleeing LTTE areas for
government lines.

In the key Vavuniya district, for instance, where
three-quarters of the area remains under LTTE control,
that precise proportion of the population lives on the
government side of the lines -- wherein there had been no
incidents during the year before the Jaffna attack. The
test will be whether the costly seizure of Jaffna serves
to facilitate further this domi- nation of the populace.

Certainly the struggle will continue. What is hoped in
Colombo is that the destruction of the insurgent head
will push the conflict back to the level at which it
should have remained had government response been more
appropriate and foreign intervention less disruptive
(India, now firmly on Colombo's side, was for much of the
conflict an ally of the insurgents; Tamil Nadu in
southern India continues to be used as a base and staging
area despite New Delhi's efforts).

Thus it can be dealt with using the techniques and forces
developed for special operations. Had these been
available from the start, combined with the greater
political and social sensitivity now evident in Colombo's
strategic approach, it is unlikely the story of the Tamil
insurgency would have grown to such gigantic proportions.

Oklahoma Rescue, by Jon Hansen (New York: Ballantine
Books, 1995), 222 pp., $5.99.
Requiem for the Heartland: The Oklahoma City Bombing (San
Francisco: Collins Publishers, 1995), 119 pp., $19.95.

In Their Name: Oklahoma City, The Official Commemorative
Volume (New York: Random House, 1995), 176 pp., $25.00.

And the Angels Wept: From the Pulpits of Oklahoma City,
edited by Marsha Brock Bishop and David P. Polk (St.
Louis: Chalice Press, 1995), 128 pp., $15.95.
The April 19, 1995 bombing of the Alfred Murrah Federal
Building in Oklahoma City was a pivotal event in
America's experience with terrorism. Although this was
not the first time that a vehicle bomb had been used
against a civilian target in the United States, it was
the first of such incidents to kill and injure hundreds
of people. For this and other reasons, April 19, 1995
will forever be remembered as a day of infamy.
A number of books have come out since the bombing to both
explain what happened and to pay tribute to those who
lost their lives on that day. Oklahoma Rescue, the first
book published on the bombing, was written by Oklahoma
City Assistant Fire Chief Jon Hansen. Hansen imparts a
moving personal account of the rescue effort, from the
moment that he heard the bomb blast to the recovery of
the final three bodes of the victims on May 29.

Two of the new books were compiled to remember those who
lost their lives and to commemorate the valiant efforts
of the rescue workers and volunteers. Requiem for the
Heartland is a photographic compilation that vividly
shows the devastation of the bombing and Oklahoma City's
efforts to carry on in the face of adversity. In their
Name, another pictorial work, is a collection of
first-hand accounts from the survivors of the bombing and
from the next of kin, the rescue workers and the citizens
of Oklahoma City who were trying to cope in the
aftermath. Both books contain powerful photos, many of
which will be familiar to those who followed the bombing
closely. Proceeds from these books will be donated to
charities involved in assisting the Oklahoma City bombing
victims. Both books are fitting tributes to those who
died and to those who selflessly gave of themselves to
help.

The final book on the bombing is very different from the
others. And the Angels Wept is a compilation of sermons
delivered at various religious institutions in Oklahoma
City in the aftermath of the bombing. It is a touching
tribute to those religious leaders who attempted to make
some sense out of this terrible tragedy. All of the
proceeds of this work will go to the Interfaith Disaster
Recovery of Greater Oklahoma City.

Protection Specialist Survey and Checkbook, by John
Dermaut (International Network of Protection Specialists,
Global Security Complex, 1995), 200 pp., $19.95,
805-845-7011. Reviewed by Mayer Nudell.

Sometimes, someone finds a new way to present
time-honored material in a different and more useful way.
That is the case with the new pocket-sized Protection
Specialist Survey and Checkbook, produced by the
International Network of Protection Specialists (INPS).
The INPS is a relatively new organization focusing on the
professional needs of those in the security fraternity
who are largely responsible for the personal protection
of others. John Dermaut, director of the INPS, has made a
significant contribution to the literature by packaging a
considerable amount of information into a compact format,
and by adding his own international perspective and
knowledge to the mix. The result is an extremely useful
guide and series of checklists that can be used
repeatedly when doing advance work and in providing
personal protection in any context.
The book is divided into two parts. The first deals with
buildings and transportation. It provides checklists and
reminders for dealing with residences, offices, hotels,
restaurants, hospitals, cars, planes, trains--and many
other aspects of personal protection in a wide range of
environments. The second part contains specific
information and checklists for doing advance work, route
surveys, and many other tasks. It also contains several
useful references for dealing with improvised explosive
devices and letter bombs, along with a conversion chart
for metric-English measurements, a listing of country and
area telephone codes, and some key dates for the
protection specialist to keep in mind (especially
important since many attacks are linked anniversaries of
events).
The Protection Specialist Survey and Checkbook is an
extremely useful publication, and its compact, pocket
size makes it a reference that can easily be taken along
on any site survey or advance trip. Its many checklists
should ease the task of providing personal protection,
and its comprehensive coverage should ensure that nothing
is overlooked. This inexpensive book belongs in the
library of all protection specialists, although it won't
stay there gathering dust. Its sturdy cover may
eventually become dog-eared through use, but protection
specialists will certainly welcome its help.

The Seven Steps to Personal Safety, by Richard B. Isaacs
and Tim Powers  (New York: Varro Press, 1993), 170 pp.,
913-432-6399. Reviewed by Mayer Nudell.

The past few years have seen a number of advisory books
intended to help people learn to protect themselves from
crime and other assorted evils of modern life. Most of
them concentrate either on avoiding dangerous situations
or on self-defense techniques to use when attacked. The
Seven Steps to Personal Safety is one of the few to
combine both aspects into a common-sense approach to
personal safety. The authors each have many years of
experience in law enforcement, criminal justice, and
self-defense training. Against this background they have
focused their presentation on awareness and avoidance,
while providing a continuum from awareness through
reaction and response to the aftermath of a violent
incident. In the jargon of the security manager, the
authors take a systems approach to personal defense and
safety, and the seven steps they propose flow from one to
the next.

The authors' seven steps to personal safety are: 1) being
aware of vulnerability, 2) mental commitment to doing
everything possible to remain safe, 3) being aware of the
environment and taking reasonable precautions, 4)
creating and maintaining distance to escape threatening
situations, 5) stopping an assault and escaping, 6)
immediate notification of the police, and 7) dealing with
post-incident stress. Each chapter focuses on one of
these steps, providing a wealth of useful information
that anyone can use.
Isaacs and Powers present a number of options that
individuals can choose from should they find themselves
exposed to danger. Recognizing that a major part of both
avoidance and response is mental, they repeatedly discuss
that aspect of personal safety--ranging from planning to
the decision about how to respond from an attack, and in
recovering from an attack's effects. They stress that
behavioral changes in attitudes toward life need not
result in paranoia, but in a feeling of being in control
and of feeling secure. The net result should be more
self-assurance and an increased ability to enjoy life.
The Seven Steps to Personal Safety also contains both
verbal and physical techniques that can be used in
various situations to either de-escalate tension or to
respond to an attack. These techniques are presented as
part of an overall programmatic approach to personal
safety. While not a replacement for a well-conceived
training program, this book provides an intelligent and
effective method of enhancing personal safety.

fuels the hatred of many American far right racist and

Christian Identity is a British theology of anti-Semitism

white supremacists in the United States. Barkun argues
that despite its small size and lack of public
prominence, Identity doctrine has become the single most
important religious position on the racist right.

Comrade Criminal is described as "the first comprehensive
investigation into the organized crime and corruption
that plague Russia today." The author, former Moscow
bureau chief of the Toronto Star, makes extensive use of
interviews to show how organized crime is hindering
Russia's transition to democracy. The breakup of the
Soviet Union has resulted in a virtual free-for-all for
bureaucrats and criminals. Smuggling and the black market
activity have become an integral part of the Russian
economy over the past 20 years. Along with this comes
criminal activity that manifests itself in gang-style
executions, kidnappings, and drugs and weapons
trafficking. Widespread corruption, bureaucratic red tape
and a high level of taxation make it difficult for
business to be conducted honestly. The current crime wave
is so vast and the Russian authorities so overwhelmed and
under funded that they are doomed to failure.

Book Review: Priority Mail, by Mark Winne (New York: Lisa

This is the story of law enforcement efforts to identify
serial bomber Walter Leroy Moody, whose bombing campaign
targeted lawyers, officials of the NAACP, and judges on
the US Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit. Moody was
first convicted in 1972 of a mail bombing that targeted a
used car dealer who repossessed his car. After serving
time in prison, Moody was freed and filed an appeal. The
court's denial of a rehearing fueled Moody's terror
campaign, which began in December 1989 when Judge Robert
Vance was killed by a letter bomb sent to his home in
Birmingham, Alabama. The same tactic was used two days
later against a lawyer for the NAACP in Savannah,
Georgia. Fortunately for investigators, Moody's bombs
were so similar to the 1972 device that prosecutors were
able to obtain a conviction in spite of a lack of
fingerprints, witnesses or a paper trail linking him to
the 1989 bombings.

Perfection in the Palm of Your Hand

Glock introduces the Model 26 and Model 27--compact
pistols which combine Glock technology with firepower,
simplicity, interchangeability, and precision, all in a
package so compact and concealable that it fits in the
palm of your hand. The G26 is designed in 9mm, and the
G27 in .40 caliber. Those concerned about defending
themselves can walk down a dark street with confidence
knowing they have the power of a service caliber Glock
pistol on their side.

The concealability of these compact pistols are the main
selling point as a self-defense weapon, or as a backup
weapon. With a 6-inch slide and a height of only 4
inches, these pistols easily slip into an ankle holster
or handbag.

Another distinctive advantage is that the G26 accepts
magazines from the 9mm Glock models 17 and 19; the .40
caliber G27 accepts magazines from the models 22 and 23.
Both models have plenty of firepower, since the G26 holds
10 rounds and the G27 holds nine rounds. Law enforcement
officers who carry Glock pistols of the same caliber like
the concept that their duty magazines are compatible with
their backup or off-duty pistol.
Simple upkeep and training make these mini-pistols the
perfect choice for anyone desiring a compact for personal
safety. The same technology that made Glock known for
accuracy and ease of shooting still applies to these
compact packages. The recoil is lessened by the low
positioning of the slide and the unique double-recoil
spring, allowing each pistol to perform exactly like its
larger counterparts.

Anyone who can shoot a Glock can pick up the compact
version and expect the same function, accuracy, and
performance. Since the inner mechanisms are identical in
function and design with the other Glock pistols, field
stripping, cleaning, and servicing are as simple on the
G26 and G27 as on any other Glock.

Desktop Surveillance

Dedicated Micros, a leading provider of advanced
surveillance equipment and the developer of the first
CCTV video multiplexer, announced a new product line of
compact, full-featured digital video multiplexers that
make "desktop surveillance" a practical option for the
first time.
Dedicated Micros' new Sprite product line of six digital
video multiplexers are housed in identical cases. Each
Sprite has a footprint just over one square foot and 3
1/3 inches tall, and includes a built-in keyboard pitched
at a comfortable angle. The innovative design enables all
Sprites to sit unobtrusively on a desk.

Designed to meet a wide variety of user requirements, the
new Sprites are available in capacities ranging from four
to 16 cameras, color or monochrome operation, with
simplex and duplex models. The new multiplexers are the
Sprite SX 4C (four camera, simplex color with quad
capability), Sprite SX 9 (nine camera, simplex, mono),
Sprite DX 9 (nine camera, duplex, mono), and Sprite SX 9C
(nine camera, simplex, color), Sprite DX 16 (16 camera,
duplex, mono).

The multiplexers' attractive styling, compact size, ease
of installation and operation, many features, and low
cost-per-feature pricing are designed to open up the
emerging residential market and expand markets for small-
and medium-sized businesses, as well as large
organizations with CCTV requirements of up to 16 cameras.

Among the many features are true duplex operation,
activity detection with sensitivity settings, alarms
tagged to videotape for quick review, and flexible
multi-screen displays. Also, time and date is recorded
indelibly to the tape during recording--not during
playback--to assure evidentiary integrity.
The use of just four selection keys and color-coded menu
screens appearing on the monitor greatly simplifies
installation and operation of the entire Sprite product
line. The menus provide easy access to all options and
features. Preprogrammed function keys provide one-touch
movement between recording modes. There is also a
one-touch system status button. A scheduling function
permits automatic time-of-day recording mode changes.

US Border Patrol Receives New Night Vision Gear

This fall, the US Border Patrol will begin using the
Long-Range Infrared Surveillance System (LORIS), made by
Inframetrics, Inc., to help detect the illegal entry of
aliens and contraband into the United States. At full
value, the contract is worth $17 million with options to
purchase up to 500 LORIS systems and accessories over a
five-year period.

Since most illegal border crossings occur at night and in
remote or relatively lightly traveled areas, the ability
to "see in the dark" is critical to the Border Patrol.
Unlike night vision goggles and other less sophisticated
IR scopes, infrared cameras like the LORIS system are
sensitive to body heat and can operate in total darkness
and under poor weather conditions.
The LORIS is a field-proven, all-weather unit designed
specifically for long-range surveillance with a detection
range of up to and beyond five miles. Used day or night,
the system produces high-quality thermal images for
display on standard video monitors. Weighing just 35
pounds, the sensor head is transportable and can be
mounted on a number of platforms including mobile
surveillance vehicles, communication towers, and other
fixed installations. In addition to border patrol
surveillance, LORIS systems are in use today in military,
drug interdiction, weapons testing and tracking, maritime
surveillance, and industrial security applications.

Hostage Slain in India

August 13: A Kashmiri separatist group decapitated one of
five tourists it kidnapped last month. The headless body
of Hans Christian Ostro, of Oslo, Norway, was discovered
in Seer, a village 30 miles south of the Himalayan region
where the five were last seen. The name of the militant
group, Al-Faran, was carved on his chest with a knife,
police said. Ostro's head was found later in a different
spot in the village. "We have killed the hostage because
the government has failed to accept our demands," said a
note found in the victim's shirt pocket. It also demanded
that 15 jailed militants be released in 48 hours, or "the
other hostages will meet the same fate." Two
Americans--Donald Hutchings and John Childs--were the
first to be kidnapped on July 4. Childs escaped four days
later.

Algerian Terrorists Claim Paris Bombings

August 19: An obscure Algerian terrorist group known as
the "GIA General Command" claimed responsibility for the
Aug. 17 blast near the Arc de Triomphe, as well a
previous attack in an underground rail station. The group
made its call to a Paris radio station. French police
could not authenticate the call, but said they were
taking it seriously. A police spokesman also admitted for
the first time that the same group had claimed the July
25 attack which killed seven people and wounded 84. "GIA
General Command" is a new name, but authorities believe
it may be an offshoot of the Armed Islamic Group, known
by the French acronym GIA, which has been trying to
impose an Islamic government in Algeria.

New York-Area Airports Shut Down by Bomb Threat

August 28: Three major airports in the New York area were
closed down after a bomb threat forced the evacuation of
an air traffic control station in Westbury, Long Island.
The center controls air traffic in and out of the three
major airports in the area - JFK International and
LaGuardia in New York and Newark International in New
Jersey - as well as Westchester County Airport north of
New York City and Teterboro Airport in Bergen County, New
Jersey. The air traffic control center was reopened after
bomb-sniffing dogs confirmed the threat as a hoax. Still,
the threat halted the arrival and departure of 210
flights.

French Bombing Suspect Identified

August 28: According to a report published in the French
newspaper Le Monde, French authorities suspect that the
same Algerian terrorist who planned the Christmas 1994
hijacking of a French airliner also carried out the
recent bomb attacks in a Paris metro station and near the
Arc de Triomphe. The story said that the suspect in the
Paris bombings was identified by a witness from a large
mole on his face as an Algerian using the assumed name of
Yahia Rihane, also know a "Krounfil"--Algerian slang for
a mole. Another suspect in the bombing is being held in
Sweden. Apparently, Krounfil wanted to avenge the deaths
of four Islamic terrorists killed by French commandos
during the Christmas hijacking.

an Italian worker was shot to death in the western city

September 2: The IRA said it would not give up any of its
weapons despite the ongoing cease-fire in Northern
Ireland. A British proposal to establish an international
arms commission is merely London's way of trying to
negotiate a "back-door" surrender of the IRA. According
to the Irish media, the IRA maintains that there is
"absolutely no question of any IRA decommissioning [of
weapons] at all, either through the back door or the

Conviction in Plot to Kidnap Gen. Haig

September 26: A judge convicted Red Army Faction member
Sieglinde Hofmann for her role in the 1977 kidnap-murder
of German industrialist Hanns-Martin Schleyer. During the
attack, Hofmann pushed a baby carriage in front of
Schleyer's car, forcing it to stop. Then she and other
terrorists pulled weapons out of the carriage and opened
fire, killing the driver and three policemen. Schleyer
was kidnapped and later murdered. Hofmann was also
convicted of a 1979 attempt to kidnap US Army General
Alexander Haig, at that time the NATO military commander.
The plan narrowly failed.

Holy War Threatened

September 26: Israeli and Palestinian hard-liners
threatened to use violence to wreck the West Bank
autonomy accord signed at the White House. Muslim
militants swore to launch a "holy war" and Jewish
settlers warned they would set up militias to replace
Israeli soldiers pulling out of West Bank towns. But most
West Bank Palestinians ignored calls for a general strike
by militant opponents of Yasser Arafat, suggesting
growing support for the PLO chief as he prepared to take
control of most Arab-populated areas in the West Bank
after a gradual Israeli troop pullback from Palestinian
cities over the next six months. Also, about 2,000
Israeli hard-liners opposed to the agreement converged on
Hebron for a protest timed to coincide with the White
House ceremony. They carried posters branding Arafat and
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin of Israel "blood brothers."

Britain Condemned in IRA Killings

September 27: The European Court of Human Rights
condemned Britain for the 1988 slayings in Gibraltar of
three IRA members who were believed to be planning a car
bomb attack there. British officials argued that the SAS
commandos responsible for the killings acted properly
because they believed that the terrorists were armed and
about to detonate their explosives. As it later turned
out, the three were unarmed and were going through a dry
run of their planned bombing. The Strasbourg-based court
ruled in a 10 to 9 vote that the commandos' actions were
based on flawed intelligence and that British authorities
had shown a "lack of appropriate care in the control and
organization of the arrest operation." The British
government called the ruling "irresponsible."
