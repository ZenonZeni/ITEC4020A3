COMMITMENT TO FALKLANDS-MALVINAS IN XMAS MESSAGE</strong> </font></p>

face="Arial"><strong>PORT STANLEY.(MP).- In a special Xmas
message broadcast by the BBC directly from London to the islands,
British Prime Minister John Major said that Britain's commitment
to the Falklanders has not diminished in any way</strong>. &quot;<em>Our
developing relationship with Argentina will not be at the expense
of Britain's unchanging commitment to the Falkland Islands</em>&quot;,
said Major following a tradition started by his predecessor
Margaret Thatcher in 1982, six months after the end of the South
Atlantic conflict, when the first Xmas message to the islands was
broadcasted. Major said that Britain continues to seek a stable
and productive relationship with Argentina, not just because of
the interests both countries have in common, &quot;<em>but
because as you have repeatedly told us, it's in your interest
too, as the progress on oil exploration has vividly shown us</em>&quot;.
&quot;<em>You have the right to live under the flag of your
choice , and we shall continue to ensure that you enjoy that
right, and that you enjoy security</em>&quot;, underlined the
Prime Minister. The remarks come as rumours of a massive
reduction in the current British troop levels in the
Falklands-Malvinas are being circulated and just a few days
before the Defence Secretary, Michael Portillo begins a short
visit to the islands. Major also talked about the opportunities
and challenges that the prospects of commercially exploitable oil
reserves being discovered in the islands could bring. &quot;<em>Some
of you I know are nervous about the implications for your
environment and your traditional way of life and I understand
those fears. We've had to face in many ways similar challenges,
but I believe they can be surmounted</em>&quot;. Finally the
British Prime Minister also talked about a long term fisheries
agreement with Argentina. The fishing industry, particularly
squid licenses, remains the islands main income. &quot;<em>I know
how important fishing remains to your prosperity. It seems to me
that one of the priorities 1997 should be to make progress on an
agreement with Argentina to assure the fish stocks of the South
West Atlantic</em>&quot;. </font></p>
