House Panel Examines Cash Benefits of Children's SSI Program</B><P>
The current system of providing monetary benefits for children determined disabled under the Supplemental Security Income Program (SSI) is completely out of control, and is abused by many families whose children don't really need to be covered, said a member of the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Human Resources last month.  According to Subcommittee member Rep. Jim McCrery (R-LA) during a January 27 hearing on the SSI issue, the number of children covered by the program has more than tripled since 1989, and without restrictions on how the money awarded is used, many families are taking advantage of the program.  <P>
<B>Background</B>:  The SSI program, which was established in 1974, is administered by the Social Security Administration (SSA).  The program provides the families of children with disabilities with a monthly check; the maximum each child can be awarded each month is $458.  Before 1989, the growth in child beneficiaries had been relatively low.  However, over the last 5 years the number of children receiving SSI benefits has grown from almost 300,000 to almost 900,000.   According to the U.S. General Accounting Office (GAO), most of the growth is likely due to concerted outreach efforts as a result of the <I>Zebley</I> decision and subsequent major changes in eligibility criteria for children.  <P>
In the 1990 Supreme Court decision in <I>Sullivan v. Zebley</I>, the Court ruled that SSA had to go beyond its previous disability criteria and assess a child's ability to do things that another child of a similar age can do.  The definition of disability for SSI eligibility requires that a child have a physical or mental impairment expected to last at least 1 year and to substantially reduce the child's ability to function independently, appropriately, and effectively when compared with other children of the same age.  If a disability cannot be found solely on medical grounds (meeting a listing), the SSA must evaluate how the impairment affects the child's ability to function, known as an individualized functional assessment (IFA).  If the assessment shows that the child does much less than expected in one area or is moderately restricted in several areas of development or functioning, the child is considered disabled and can be eligible for SSI.  <P>
<B>Charges Against the Program</B>:  The House panel's concern is not focused on those children who are truly disabled, McCrery charged.  He alleges that parents tell their children to "act crazy," so that they could qualify for SSI.  Another of the panel's concerns is that parents don't have to use the money for therapeutic or medical aid.  They can spend it in any way they wish, as long as they can prove that it benefits the child in some way.  This opens the way for purchases of cars, household goods and clothing, even a television set and video games, McCrery stated.  "The key problem (with the SSI program)," added Rep. Gerald Kleczka (D-WI), "is that it fails to adequately state what providing assistance to these children is meant to achieve.  Lacking clear direction, the program often fails to serve a constructive purpose."<P>
The government's lack of program oversight could conceivably allow the families who currently receive SSI payments for their children to continue to receive them during the child's entire life, without adequate follow-up to determine whether the children are still disabled, the panel noted.   In an attempt to remedy the situations of fraud and abuse, and to ensure that the "system targets services directly to the needs of qualifying children," the House panel is seriously considering several alternatives to the current system of cash benefits.  <P>
<B>Proposed Changes to the Program</B>.  On February 15, the Subcommittee completed its work on the Republican welfare reform proposal, the Personal Responsibility Act.  The full Ways and Means Committee passed the measure in early March.  Under Title IV of the Act, the Committee approved the following major changes to the children's SSI program:  <P>
&#128;The Individualized Functional Assessment (IFA) would be eliminated for children who do not meet the medical "listings," essentially overturning the effects of the <I>Zebley</I> decision.<BR>
&#128;Cash benefits for future recipients would be eliminated, except for those individuals who meet the listings and who, without the cash payment, would have to be institutionalized.  Those children who are found eligible under the listings but are not eligible for cash benefits will qualify for services through a block grant to the states.<BR>
&#128;For children who currently receive cash benefits, if they qualified on the basis of the medical listings, they will continue to receive cash benefits (grandfathering).  However, if they qualified on the basis of the IFA, they will lose eligibility and cash benefits six months after the law is enacted.<BR>
&#128;States would receive a block grant from the Social Security Administration, which could be spent only on authorized medical and non-medical services.  States would decide who to serve and which services to provide from a prescribed list.  The states would receive funds based on a formula which essentially allocates an amount equal to only 75 % of the average SSI benefit for each child who does not receive cash.  The funds are intended to cover additional services to children who are eligible for cash benefits (grandfathered or otherwise would be institutionalized) and those who are disabled by a condition in the medical listings but who are not receiving cash (newly eligible).  Children would continue to be eligible for Medicaid in those states which automatically cover SSI-eligible children.<P>
<B>The Disability Community Speaks Up</B>.  The disability community, citing a recent SSA report, testified that a majority of the fraud charges are unfounded.  "It is nearly impossible for children to feign disabilities to qualify for benefits," insists the Consortium for Citizens with Disabilities (CCD).  "The severity of a child's disability must be so fully documented that children with minor physical or behavioral problems cannot qualify for SSI."  The Consortium noted that of the more than 600 random cases that SSA examined, not one case of alleged coaching was found that resulted in a benefit award.<P>
In addition, some have pointed out that the proposal to eliminate cash benefits in lieu of a block grant or service voucher would drastically affect the ability of families to keep their children with disabilities at home.  "Families use cash payments to cover expenses such as medications and physician visits to regulate medications, children's wheelchairs, and family counseling," explained Barbara Otto of the SSI Coalition.  "These are all medical related costs that are not covered by either private or public health insurance.  Some use the benefits to offset their loss of income because a parent must remain unemployed or under-employed to care for a child with disabilities." <P>
Without the financial assistance and the flexibility to use the money, CCD notes, some families could be  forced to surrender custody to guarantee proper care for their children, either through the foster care system or in state institutions at a higher cost to taxpayers.  <P>
<B>CEC Response</B>.  CEC has urged the Subcommittee to wait to make drastic changes to the program until more information about its effectiveness -- and abuses -- are better known.  Congress has established a Commission on the Evaluation of Disability in Childhood, which has been charged with conducting an extensive study on SSI benefits.  The Commission is expected to report its findings by August 1995; therefore, CEC urged Subcommittee Chairman E. Clay Shaw in a letter to wait for the report's findings before beginning any action that may unnecessarily restrict SSI benefits for children with disabilities.<P>
