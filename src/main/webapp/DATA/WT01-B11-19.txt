<IMG SRC="../Images/c111-ykho-h100.jpg" WIDTH=137 HEIGHT=100
	ALIGN=MIDDLE> C111.

<P> Daimler-Benz made several <A HREF = "rce.html">Rotary Combustion
Engine</A> (RCE) <A HREF = "engines.html#Daimler-Benz">prototypes</A> from
1962 into the early 70s.  Some were developed for small sedans, but the
one of most spectacular vehicles ever to flaunt a rotary was the
two-seat C111, complete with gull-wing doors.  The engine was placed
mid-ship.  Sixteen prototypes were built.

<P> The C111 had three- and four-rotor engines, first shown in 1969 and
1970, respectively.  The three-rotor could generate 280 bhp and move the
car 0 to 60 in 4.9 seconds.  The latter developed as much as 400
horsepower, though it was usually tuned for the street at 305
horsepower.  There were interesting innovations such as a variable
length intake and an anti-lock braking system (ABS).  The car was a
heavy 2900 pounds, but was capable of 185 mph and 0-60 mph in less than
5 seconds.

<P> The project was headed by Dr Hans Liebold.  It ultimately fell
victim to the oil crisis and a timid board with a "not-invented-here"
attitude.  This was a shame because the cars were unfailingly reliable.

<P> As of 1990, Daimler-Benz was the main supporter of TES, <A
