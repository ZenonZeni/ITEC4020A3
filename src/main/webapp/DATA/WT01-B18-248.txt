Dear Senator Harkin:  

     This is in response to your letter of October 12, 1993, on 
behalf of your constituent, Mr. Carl E. Olsen.  

     Pursuant to 21 U.S.C. § 811, and interested party can 
petition the DEA to reschedule a controlled substance.  When such 
a petition is filed with the Drug Enforcement Administration, it 
is carefully evaluated to determine whether the petition meets 
the requirements of 21 C.F.R. § 1308.44.  Section (b) of that 
regulation requires that the petition conform to the format 
provided and also specifies that four copies be filed.  If the 
petition is accepted for filing, the Administrator will evaluate 
the petition on its merits.  If the petition is not accepted for 
filing, because it is either lacking in the regulatory 
requirements or not readily understood, the Administrator will 
notify the petitioner of his decision and reasons thereof.  21 
C.F.R. § 1308.44(c).  A copy of the regulation has been provided 
for your convenience.  

     As you are aware, your constituent has appealed the DEA's 
nonacceptance of his petition to the United States Court of 
Appeals for the District of Columbia.  In that case, the DEA has 
asked for a remand of the action in order that the Administrator 
may accept Mr. Olsen's petition for filing and review that 
petition on its merits.  The DEA is constrained from commenting 
further on the merits of Mr. Olsen's case since it is currently 
pending before the court of appeals.  

     I hope the foregoing will assist you in responding to your 
constituent.  

     Sincerely,  

     Stephen H. Greene  
     Acting Administrator of Drug Enforcement
