<B>Managed Forest Tax Rebate Program and <BR>
Conservation Land Tax Reduction Program

</B>
</CENTER><P>
Since its introduction in 1975 (retroactive to the 1973 tax year), the Managed Forest Tax Rebate Program has been instrumental in encouraging private woodlot owners to manage their properties for the long-term sustainability of the environment.  The program offered a 75-per-cent rebate on property taxes for the managed forest portion of a qualifying property.  The program was cancelled by the previous NDP government in 1993, which had other spending priorities.  The current government reinstated the program in February, 1996 in keeping with a commitment made in the report of the Mike Harris Task Force on Rural Economic Development released in 1994.<P>  

The Conservation Land Tax Reduction Program was introduced for the 1987 tax year and has been offered without interruption since then.  The program aims to ease the property-tax burden that threatens the preservation of land vital to Ontario's natural heritage.  It offers a 100-per-cent tax rebate for qualifying lands.<P>

Both programs were intended to be short-term solutions to address unfair property-tax systems that penalize people for protecting important natural areas.  The government is moving ahead with its commitment to tax reform that ensures there is a permanent commitment to the environment and is making changes as part of its response to the recommendations of the Who Does What  committee.  These long-term, permanent property-tax reforms eliminate the need for the Managed Forest Tax Rebate and Conservation Land Tax Reduction programs. <P> 

Starting in the 1998 tax year, eligible managed forests and conservation lands, including such lands owned by Conservation Authorities, will be assessed in a similar manner to farmlands, upon application by the landowner.   Farmland in Ontario is assessed on the basis of current value in current use.  The tax rate for eligible managed forests will be set at 25 per cent of the residential tax rate of the local municipality, while eligible conservation lands will be exempt from property taxes.  This means that property owners will benefit from lower taxes rather than having to wait for the government to process a rebate, as occurred in the past.<P>

These new measures bring greater fairness to the property-tax system and promote responsible environmental stewardship.<P>
