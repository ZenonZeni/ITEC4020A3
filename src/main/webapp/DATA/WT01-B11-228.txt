<p>We are a pioneer and acknowledged leader in applying advanced mathematics, statistics and Computational Intelligence (C.I.) 
to market analysis and money management. </p>
<p>Computational Intelligence is one of the <i>fastest growing areas of market research on Wall Street Today.</i> It is computer 
intervention or assistance in tasks requiring human reasoning, intelligence, intuition and imagination. Using knowledge based 
<a href="./technolo/es.htm"><b>&quot;expert&quot; systems </b></a>, <a href="./technolo/nn.htm"><b>neural networks </b></a>and <a href="./technolo/ga.htm"><b>genetic algorithms </b></a>, this technology is capable of resolving problems of 
uncertain outcome that normally require human judgment and experience. </p>
<p>Properly programmed, the results of such problem solving efforts are accurate within a very narrow range of tolerance or 
confidence. Looking at today's market place, with its thousands of inter-relationships and increasing number of variables that 
continue to grow exponentially, C.I. is revolutionizing the way we approach market analysis. </p>
<p>A C.I. system can do mechanically what a team of skilled market analysts would do. What makes it better, is that it <i>can 
analyze more data faster and more reliably than a human can</i> and do it without bias or emotion. The most crucial 
investment decisions are made at market turning points. That is where human emotion gets in the way of judgment. The 
computer eliminates that problem. </p>
<p>C.I. systems offer distinct advantages over traditional methods of analysis. They have the ability to efficiently process 
thousands of pieces of data and consider millions of possible combinations to discover relevant relationships that may not 
otherwise be apparent. Such analysis is extremely rapid, unemotional, and unaffected by personal bias. These systems are 
dynamic and self adapting. Unlike conventional market analysis that relies on static approaches, these new methods are able to 
adjust to changing market conditions and downplay or eliminate factors that are no longer relevant. </p>
<p>The LBS System provides a dynamic, <i>self adapting decision mechanism that is intelligently sensitive to changing market 
conditions.</i> The process is disciplined, completely objective and highly risk-averse. </p>
<p>As a leading provider of advanced technology-based investment management services worldwide, LBS is driven by client 
needs and a pursuit of excellence in developing solutions for those needs. </p>
