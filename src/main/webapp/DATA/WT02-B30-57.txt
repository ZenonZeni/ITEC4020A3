<FONT SIZE="+1"><STRONG>How a Fund Earns Its
Stars</STRONG></FONT><P>



<STRONG>It must be at least 3 years old</STRONG><BR>
Morningstar believes that a mutual fund must have a significant track record for a
star rating
to be
worthwhile.  So, like horses in the Kentucky Derby, funds must be at least 3 years
old to
enter the
competition.
<P>
<STRONG>It's assigned a category</STRONG><BR>
Morningstar separates mutual funds into four categories: 
<P>
<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>equity funds (stocks)
	<LI>taxable fixed income funds (corporate bond funds and others)
	<LI>municipal bond funds 
	<LI>hybrids (a catch-all for balanced, convertible, asset allocation, corporate
high yield
and       
multi-asset global funds). 
</UL>
<P>
Categorizing allows Morningstar to pit funds against other funds with generally 
similar
objectives. 
Funds in the
hybrid category are the exception.  They're compared to all mutual funds except the
municipal bond
funds.
<P>
While there are certainly more distinctions among funds within each category (for
example,
large
company funds vs. small emerging growth company funds), Morningstar prefers to rely
on
only one
important characteristic: the risk inherent in each fund's investment strategy.  
<P>
<STRONG>It's scored by annual return</STRONG><BR>
Each fund receives a score based on its total return for 1, 3, 5, and 10 years
(what
it earned
after
deducting all sales charges).  T-bill returns, for the same periods, are then
subtracted from
the fund's
3-, 5-, and 10-year total returns.
<P>
Morningstar finds the average return for the funds in that category and assigns it
a score of
1.00.
<P>
They then rank all the funds.  A fund with a score of less than 1.00 is below
average.  A fund
with a score
over 1.00 is above average.  For example, if a fund scored 2.68, it did 168% better
than the
average
(1.00) for the category.  A fund with a 5-year score of 1.97 did 97% better than
the average.
<P>
<STRONG>It's scored by risk</STRONG><br>

To rank the fund's level of risk, Morningstar compares the fund's total return to
the total return
of a
3-month Treasury bill over the last 3 years.  (The T-bill is the benchmark because
there is
virtually no
risk of principal loss.) 
<P>
First, they count how many months the fund's total return was less than the T-bill. 
(In those
months,
according to Morningstar's standards, the fund's return didn't justify its risk.)
<P>
Then they total the amount of earnings missed during those months by investing in
the fund
instead of
in the "risk-free" T-bill.
<P>
Morningstar conducts this process for every fund in the category, then finds the
average
"loss" of
earnings.  This average amount is assigned a score of 1.00.
<P>
Now comes the scoring.  A fund with a score of less than 1.00 has
lower-than-average risk. 
A fund with
a score above 1.00 has higher-than-average risk.  
<P>
For example, if a fund scored 0.25 for the last 3 years, it exhibited 75% less risk
than the
average fund
in its category.  
<P>
<IMG SRC="/mainstay/images/iesrerim.gif" ALT="Bell Curve" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="218"
HEIGHT="100" BORDER="0">
<STRONG>It's ranked by combining the risk and return scores</STRONG><BR>
To come up with the star ratings, Morningstar uses a bell-curve system.  Here's how
it works.
First, they subtract a fund's risk score from its return score.  The difference
between the risk
and the
return is the new score that is then plotted on the bell curve along with all other
funds.
<P>
<STRONG>It's awarded its 1-, 3-,  5- and 10-year stars</STRONG><BR>
Next, Morningstar conducts the risk and return analyses for the previous 1-, 3-,  5-,
and 10-year
periods (if
the fund has been in existence that long).  Then it scores, ranks, and awards stars
for each
time period.
<P>
The top 10% of funds are awarded five stars; the next 22.5% receive four stars; the
middle
35%
receive three stars; the 22.5% below average funds receive two stars; and the
bottom 10%
receive one
star. 
<P>
<STRONG>It's awarded its overall stars</STRONG><BR>
Finally, Morningstar combines the 3-year, 5-year, and 10-year scores for each fund. 
If a fund
has 10
years of performance, the 10-year score counts for 50%, the 5-year score counts for
30%,
and the
3-year score counts for 20% of the overall score.  If a fund only has 5 years'
performance,
the 5-year
score is worth 60% and the 3-year score is worth 40%.  If a fund has only 3 years'
performance, its
3-year score counts for 100%.  
<P>

<STRONG>Why would a fund's star rating change?</STRONG><BR>

Poor performance doesn't necessarily cause a fund to lose a star.  In fact, it's
not uncommon
for a fund
to maintain - or even improve - performance, and still lose a star.
<P>
Remember, funds are awarded stars based on how they've performed relative to all
the
other funds in
their category.  So, if other funds dramatically improve their performance and one
fund stays
the same,
the loss of a star may simply mean the fund hasn't kept pace with the competition.
<P>
<STRONG>From One to Five</STRONG>
<BR>
A fund can earn from one to five stars.
<P>
That translates to:

<DL>
<DD>

<STRONG>highest</STRONG><BR>
(only the top 10% earn five stars)
<P>
<STRONG>above average</STRONG><BR>
(the next 22.5% earn four stars)
<P>
<STRONG>average</STRONG><BR>
(the middle 35% earn three stars)
<P>
<STRONG>below average</STRONG><BR>
(the next 22.5% earn two stars)
<P>
<STRONG>lowest</STRONG><BR>
(the bottom 10% earn one star)
