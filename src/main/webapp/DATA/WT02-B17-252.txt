<B>ABSTRACT</B>
<P>
The status and plans for the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE)
Superconductivity Partnership Initiative (SPI) are discussed.
The four active Phase I SPI projects, a 125 hp high-temperature
superconducting (HTS) motor, 100 MVA HTS generator, 2.4 kV HTS
fault current limiter, and 115 kV HTS transmission cable, and
two additional systems projects, a 30 MVA HTS transformer and
one meter (Southwire) cable, are reviewed. The 2.4 kV fault current
limiter prototype was successfully tested in September, 1995 at
a utility host site. The 125 hp motor is currently undergoing
initial rotor spinning tests. The 100 MVA generator prototype
coil will be completed and tested in the next few weeks. The 115
kV transmission cable project is on schedule and will be completed
in 1998. The 30 MVA transformer is on schedule to design, construct,
and test a one MVA prototype by May 1997. The Southwire cable
project recently successfully tested a one meter HTS cable which
carried 600 amperes. The U.S. DOE anticipates funding Phase II
SPI projects based on the results of Phase I in fiscal year 1996.
<P>
<B>INTRODUCTION</B>
<P>
The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) began a high-temperature superconductivity
(HTS) program in 1988 in response to potential benefits that could
be gained through the development of the newly discovered HTS
materials. In line with the objectives of DOE, the Superconductivity
Program for Electric Systems to date has focussed on electric
power applications and the wire and devices necessary to build
those applications. Through late 1993 the program concentrated
technology activities on the development of HTS wire.
<P>
With the rapid progress in making suitable HTS wire, DOE initiated
Phase I of the Superconductivity Partnership Initiative (SPI)
in the fall of 1993. The SPI is a systems technology program designed
to accelerate the development of HTS electric power systems. The
SPI strongly encourages the formation of vertically integrated
teams comprised of partners who usually do not interact in the
development cycle. This close collaboration among system integrators,
wire and device manufacturers, end-users (typically electric utilities)
has led to rapid, efficient incorporation of HTS components into
a variety of electric power systems.
<P>
The DOE HTS program supports a balanced technology development
effort. Wire and device technologies are developed through 35
collaborative projects between U.S. national laboratories and
industry, and systems technologies are supported through the SPI
and other vertically integrated project teams.
<P>
The original three Superconductivity Partnership Initiative (SPI)
projects are nearing a successful Phase I conclusion. The 125
hp motor and 100 MVA generator manufacturers hope to showcase
the potential benefits and associated impact upon the U.S. utility
industry with successful testing scheduled for the first quarter
of 1996. The 2.4 kJ fault current limiter prototype was successfully
tested at a Southern California Edison substation on September
25, 1995. A fourth Phase I project to develop an HTS transmission
cable began in early 1995.
<P>
Two additional systems development projects began in 1995. A 30
MVA HTS transformer project was formally announced in August and
to date the project has established the technical feasibility
and economic benefits of HTS power transformers in 10 MVA and
larger sizes. A new HTS transmission cable project was announced
on October 31, 1995, led by Southwire Corporation. The project
team recently demonstrated a one meter HTS power cable that carried
600 amperes.
<P>
Progress made in wire and coil technology and systems engineering
during the Phase I projects is helping the program reach its ultimate
goal: assisting industry in developing the technology necessary
to make superconducting electric power products available to the
marketplace, in the process providing super energy efficient,
cost-effective HTS electric power equipment that will help keep
electricity costs low and United States industry competitive.
Progress and plans for each project are detailed below.
<P>
<B>125 hp Motor Project</B> 
<P>
Reliance Electric Company, SPI team leader for the 125 hp, 4-pole,
1800 RPM motor prototype, estimates that they will achieve a 60%
size reduction and 50% decrease in losses with their commercial
HTS motor compared to a conventional motor of the same rating.
The prototype will be scaled up and offered commercially in motor
sizes of 1000 hp or larger to replace less efficient motors now
used in electric utility companies to power fans, pumps, and other
manufacturing equipment. Rich Schiferl of Reliance Electric explained
that &quot;utilization of off the shelf parts has been instrumental
in the success of the program by keeping costs low and avoiding
unnecessary design and development of new parts.&quot; He also
stated that similar engineering practices will be used in future
developments such as a &gt;1000 hp pre-production HTS motor.
<P>
Reliance Electric and team members American Superconductor Corporation
(ASC), Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI), Sandia National
Laboratory (SNL), and Centerior Energy Corporation report prototype
assembly progressing on schedule. To date, armature and rotor
fabrication is complete. First rotating tests were completed using
a coil subset from ASC. ASC delivered the full coil set in December
1995 (~60,000 Amp-turns, ~0.8 Tesla max.). Final testing of the
motor is underway.
<P>
<B>100 MVA Generator Project</B>
<P>
The 100 MVA HTS generator project team, led by General Electric
Company (GE), plans to deliver a commercial product that is more
than 50% smaller and operates with half of the efficiency losses
of a conventional generator of the same rating. GE hopes commercialization
will lead to extensive retrofits to existing generators along
with new generator sales in the international market. Team members
include Intermagnetics General Corporation, Niagara Mohawk Power
Corporation, New York State Energy and Research and Development
Authority, the New York State Institute on Superconductivity,
and Argonne, Los Alamos, and Oak Ridge National Laboratories.
<P>
The Phase I goal of the generator team is to build and test a
100 MVA generator coil subset and design a 100 MVA HTS generator.
The team has completed the preliminary generator design and continues
to study power system interaction. They have also fabricated 200-meter
lengths of Bi-2223 wire for prototype racetrack coils (changed
from the original saddle coil due to design constraints) and are
optimizing coil fabrication procedures on smaller test coils.
GE is presently winding and testing the prototype coil. Mindful
of ultimate component performance goals of Jc&#187;45,000 A/cm2
and uniformly reproducible 3,000 meter wire production, the team
also maintains significant attention towards Tl-1223 PIT and thick
film conductor development for improved coil material.
<P>
<B>2.4 kV Fault Current Limiter Project</B> 
<P>
Lockheed Martin leads the 2.4 kJ fault current limiter (FCL) project
team whose Phase I SPI plan is to build and test a 2.4 kV fault
current limiter on a utility substation. FCLs, a technology not
current used extensively by utilities, have the potential to significantly
reduce capital and operating costs. FCLs protect utility transmission
and distribution systems from extensive damage caused by abnormal
current pulses, sometimes reaching 100 times the capacity of the
system, by limiting the maximum load that reaches circuit breakers,
transformers, and switches. Other members on the FCL team include
American Superconductor Corporation, Southern California Edison
Corporation (SCE), and Los Alamos National Laboratory.
<P>
This new technology gives electric utilities the opportunity to
cut costs significantly by deferring the installation of higher
capacity transmission lines, circuit breakers and transformers,
and increasing system utilization by allowing the installation
of less expensive, lower rated circuit breakers.
<P>
Final testing of the 2.4 kV FCL was recently successfully completed
at a SCE substation. Results will be announced in a press conference
at a later date. The FCL team completed the test on schedule despite
a decision to meet DOE's challenge to increase the Phase I prototype
target rating from 240 V to 2.4 kV. A &quot;low voltage&quot;
(12 V) benchtop unit was successfully demonstrated in late 1994,
paving the way for completion of the final design for a 2.4 kV,
2000 A unit that was assembled in July and tested in September,
1995. The prototype uses a 3 mH, 2.4 kV coil supplied by ASC.
<P>
<B>115 kV Underground Transmission Cable Project</B> 
<P>
EPRI leads a fourth Phase I SPI project team that plans to develop
a prototype 30 meter, 115 kV, underground HTS transmission cable,
and design a 3-phase, 100 meter cable system. Partners include
Pirelli Cable Corporation, ASC, and Los Alamos and Oak Ridge National
Laboratories. The four year Phase I project began in early 1995.
<P>
ASC has delivered six kilometers of HTS wire to Pirelli to date.
Pirelli is now testing the wire for mechanical and electrical
performance. All ASC wire has met or exceeded specifications.
Pirelli is developing a qualification procedure for HTS wire.
They are also modifying one of their cable stranding machines
to accommodate HTS wire. The team is on schedule to successfully
complete activities in 1998.
<P>
<B>30 MVA Transformer Project</B>
<P>
Waukesha Electric Systems leads the 30 MVA transformer project
team whose objectives are to design, construct, and test a one
MVA HTS transformer prototype by May, 1997 and establish the technical
and economic feasibility of HTS power transformers in 10 MVA and
larger sizes. HTS transformers will be smaller, more efficient,
less of a fire hazard, and potentially quieter than conventional
units. Additional team members include Intermagnetics General
Corporation, Rochester Gas and Electric, Oak Ridge National Laboratory,
and Rensselear Polytechnic Institute.
<P>
In 1996, the team plans to establish key transfer design parameters,
continue to develop HTS wire and windings, and begin construction
of the nominal 1 MVA single-phase HTS transformer.
<P>
<B>Southwire HTS Transmission Cable Project</B>
<P>
Southwire Company announced a new HTS transmission cable project
and team on October 31, 1995. The team plans to demonstrate the
feasibility of HTS cable by building a one meter prototype by
mid-1996 and continuing to develop long-length commercial cable
after successfully testing the one meter prototype. The cable
is attractive for the same reasons mentioned in the EPRI cable
project. The team recently announced that a preliminary one meter
cable carried 600 amperes. They plan to continue developing HTS
wire and improving the cabling process by retrofitting one of
their industrial cabling machines. Additional team members include
Intermagnetics General Corporation and Oak Ridge National Laboratory.
<P>
<B>Phase II Solicitations</B>
<P>
With the conclusion of three SPI Phase I projects on the horizon,
the Department of Energy (DOE) released restricted Phase II solicitations
from DOE's Golden Field Office on March 28, 1995 to the original
three SPI Phase I teams. The U.S. DOE expects to fund additional
Phase I and Phase II projects to maintain a strong portfolio of
projects that will capitalize on continuing improvements in HTS
wire, component, and systems properties.
<P>
<B>SUMMARY</B>
<P>
The SPI has been uniquely successful in rapidly developing electric
power technologies through the vertically integrated team approach.
These teams will continue to develop systems using the most advanced
ideas from the national laboratories, state-of-the-art components
from wire manufacturers, and up-to-date requirements and needs
of end-users. With continued strong progress, these systems will
evolve into commercial systems that will be available to the marketplace
early in the next century.
