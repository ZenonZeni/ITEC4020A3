NATIONAL ETHANOL CONFERENCE PROVES TO BE TREMENDOUS SUCCESS</B></center></H3>
<P>
More than 300 attendees gathered in Chicago earlier this week to listen to industry leaders, policy makers and gasoline marketers discuss the outlook for ethanol in the U.S. motor fuel market as we enter the 21st century. Highlights of the conference were keynote policy addresses by Senator Dick Durbin(D-IL), American Farm Bureau Federation(AFBF) President Dean Kleckner, and Rep. Denny Hastert(R-IL).
<P>
Senator Durbin, while mindful of the legislative battle that looms in the 105th Congress regarding elimination of the ethanol tax incentive, expressed optimism that the tax incentive would be maintained.  A leading advocate of the domestic ethanol industry, Senator Durbin also stated that he plans to introduce legislation this year to extend the ethanol tax incentive beyond the year 2000, when it is currently slated to expire.
<P>
AFBF President Dean Kleckner spoke about the importance of ethanol production to American agriculture and rural economies.  Rep. Denny Hastert(R-IL) expressed his strong support for the ethanol industry and the importance of maintaining the ethanol tax incentive (See p. 3).
<P>
Tom Winninger of the Winninger Institute gave a dynamic and thought-provoking presentation to ethanol marketers and blenders, admonishing the industry to be more creative and aggressive in marketing their product.

MAYOR DALEY PROCLAIMS ETHANOL WEEK IN CHICAGO
</CENTER></B></H3>
<P>
With ethanol industry advocates converging in Chicago to participate in the National Conference on Ethanol Policy & Marketing, Chicago Mayor Richard Daley proclaimed February 3-9, 1997, "Ethanol Week in Chicago".  An ozone nonattainment area, Chicago participates in the federal reformulated gasoline program, and currently represents the largest U.S. ethanol market.
<P>

GAO CONCLUDES IMPORTING LOW-COST OIL PROVIDES LARGE ECONOMIC BENEFITS</B></CENTER></H3>
<P>
The General Accounting Office(GAO) has issued a report stating that the U.S. economy benefits to the tune of hundreds of billions of dollars annually by using low-cost imported oil rather than relying on "more expensive" domestic energy sources.  The report, <I>"Energy Security: Evaluating U.S. Vulnerability to Oil Supply Disruptions and Options for Mitigating Their Effects,"</I> was requested by House Budget Committee Chairman John Kasich.
<P>
<BR>

"I find it utterly irresponsible for the GAO to <BR>
go on record extolling the virtues of imported<BR>
oil to our economy."</BLOCKQUOTE></I></CENTER></TD></TR></TABLE>
<P><BR>
According to the GAO, compared with alternative domestic sources of energy, "imported oil represents a relatively low-cost source of fuel to the U.S. economy."  The report concludes that "U.S. consumers and businesses gain hundreds of billions of dollars in benefits annually from access to relatively low-cost foreign oil. 
These benefits accrue from avoiding the expenses of relying more extensively on higher-cost domestic energy. By most estimates, the day-to-day benefits for the United States of relying on low-cost fuel oil substantially exceed the occasional, but severe, costs of disruptions to the world oil supply." 
<P><BR>
"I find it utterly irresponsible for the GAO to go on record extolling the virtues of imported oil to our economy," said Eric Vaughn, President of the RFA.   "While major oil companies continue to export jobs overseas and gasoline-powered vehicles emit harmful pollutants, the GAO would rather see us continue down the road to increased oil imports rather than increase the production and use of cleaner-burning, domestically-produced fuels.  This is nonsense."
<P>
The Department of Energy was equally critical of the GAO's analysis.  According to the DOE, "the attempted comparison between the economic benefits of imported oil and the potential economic costs of vulnerability to oil shocks yields no insight into the overall consequences of oil imports."

<h3><CENTER><B>FEED CO-PRODUCT HANDBOOKS HIGHLIGHT VALUE OF ETHANOL BYPRODUCTS</center></B></H3>
<P>
Reflecting the growing importance of byproducts to the economic viability of ethanol production, the domestic ethanol industry and the nation's corn growers have produced two corn co-product reference handbooks describing the high quality corn co-products available to the feed industry.
<P>
The guides, "Feed Co-Products of the Corn Wet Milling Process" and "Feed Co-Products of the Corn Dry Milling Process," provide valuable information for the feeding industry on the nutritional, economic, production and use value of corn co-products.  Each handbook contains a description of the manufacturing of ethanol process, nutrient composition, livestock feeding trials, recommended feeding levels and references.
<P>
The RFA and the Iowa Corn Growers Association(ICGA) spearheaded the project.  "As corn growers work to increase the volume of value-added processing, the marketing of livestock co-products is critical to the success of the entire corn industry," said Tim Burrack, president, ICGA.  "Increased use of high-protein, economical feed ingredients from corn could boost profitability for the state's livestock producers."
<P>
The processes of producing ethanol for fuel and beverage alcohol utilize only the starch portion of the grain, leaving behind high-value, high-protein, high-vitamin content feed products called distillers dried grains or corn gluten feed.  These feeds can provide a nourishing supplement to livestock and poultry diets.
<P>
"The books will be a valuable resource tool for dairy producers, cattle feeders, the poultry industry, nutritionists, feed consultants, veterinarians and feed sales personnel," said Jerry Weigel, Director of Nutrition and Regulatory Affairs at ExSeed Genetics, L.L.C., and chief author of the handbooks.

<H3><B>HOUSE MEMBERS EXPRESS FIERCE OPPOSITION TO ELIMINATION 
OF ETHANOL TAX INCENTIVE</h3></B></CENTER>
<P>
<B><U>Rep. Hastert Sends Strong Message to Archer</B></U>
<BR>
The Illinois Republican Congressional delegation, led by Rep. Denny Hastert, Chief Deputy Whip, voiced its opposition to eliminating the partial excise tax exemption in a letter to Rep. Bill Archer, Chairman of the House Ways & Means Committee.  The Members wrote, "Recent reports have quoted you as saying the ethanol tax credit is anachronistic and needs to be updated.  While we share the strong conviction that sacrifices must be made to balance the budget, we do not believe our nation's farmers should be singled out."
<P>
"Ethanol and its tax treatment is not 'anachronistic.'  Rather, they are an integral part of American agriculture -- especially as we are continuing to reduce farm subsidies and ask farmers to seek more of their income through the marketplace.  It simply is not fair to ask farmers to look to the marketplace for their income and then, take a sizeable portion of the market away."
<P>
"New plants, as well as the expansion of existing facilities, are currently underway based on the fact that the excise tax exemption will remain until the year 2000.  These entrepreneurs count on the government keeping their word, not changing the rules in the middle of the game."

<B><U>Rep. Hastert Addresses Ethanol Conference</B></U>
<BR>
Rep. Hastert also shared his outlook for the ethanol industry with attendees of the National Conference on Ethanol Policy & Marketing.  Rep. Hastert acknowledged that there is a tough battle ahead for the industry, but expressed confidence that any attempt to retreat from the government's committment to the ethanol industry would be soundly defeated.
<P>
<B><U>Rep. Minge Challenges Anti-Ethanol Bill</B></U>
<BR>
In response to a "Dear Colleague" from Rep. Phil English (R-PA) inviting co-sponsors of H.R. 161, legislation that would eliminate the ethanol tax incentive, Rep. David Minge (D-MN) invited Rep. English to "take a tour on any one of the four farmer-owned cooperative ethanol plants in my district.  You can talk face to face with any one of the 500-odd farmer-owners of any of these plants or folks who are concerned about the environment.  They can tell you the impact the ethanol tax exemption has had on them."
<P>
In his letter, Rep. Minge attempted to correct the several misstatements made in the Dear Colleague.  In response to the claim that ethanol does not provide environmental benefits, Rep. Minge countered, "according to the EPA, the use of ethanol-blended fuels reduces carbon monoxide emissions by 30% as well as reducing carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides(NOx), ozone, air toxics and particulate matter... I am sure your constituents in the Erie area would benefit from reductions of these pollutants by using ethanol blended fuel."
<P>
Rep. Minge noted, "If one subtracts the costs of the explicit and implicit subsidies that benefit the oil industry, you would quickly find that the subsidies we provide to the oil industry to make it competitive are far more expensive than this tax incentive."
<P>
In response to the statement that the ethanol incentive does not help farmers but rather one corporation, Rep. Minge replied, "I am proud to say that the second largest producer of ethanol is Minnesota Corn Processors, a 5000 strong farmer-owned cooperative in my district.  In fact, cooperatively-owned ethanol plants represent the future of the industry and have experienced the most growth in ethanol production during the last five years."
<P>
Rep. Minge plans to reintroduce legislation introduced in the last Congress(H.R. 2232) which would amend the Small Producers Tax Credit, a ten cents per gallon credit on the first 15 million gallons of ethanol produced. As currently written, farmer cooperatives are the only business entity that cannot take advantage of the credit.

<I>The following article is the second in a series that will address some of the questions raised by Rep. Bill Archer (R-TX), Chairman of the House Ways & Means Committee, in his effort to undermine political support for the federal ethanol program:</I>
<P>
<B>What environmental benefits, if any, have the incentive produced?</B>
<P>
Ethanol has the highest oxygen content of any fuel additive available today. As such, ethanol will reduce exhaust or tailpipe emissions from vehicles more effectively than any other oxygenate.  Thus, ethanol and its ether derivative ETBE will provide significant reductions in carbon monoxide and ozone pollution, will displace toxics such as benzene, and will reduce NOx and particulate emissions.  Finally, because ethanol is produced from renewable agricultural feedstocks, ethanol is the only transportation fuel available today that will help to reduce greenhouse gases.
<P>
<B>EPA Administrator Carol Browner</B> testified before the Senate Agricultural Committee:<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><I>"renewable fuels are a vital part of the clean gasoline programs that are proving so successful in reducing air pollution in our nation's largest cities.  In addition to reducing dangerous smog and carbon monoxide, EPA believes renewable fuels can also help to combat the unhealthy heating of the Earth's atmosphere known as global warming."</I></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
The environmental benefits of ethanol include:
<P>
<B><U>1.  Clean Volume":</B></U><BR>A large fraction of the octane needed for today's gasolines comes from toxic aromatic components such as benzene, touene, xylene and tri-methyl benzenes.  Ethanol provides an alternative to such octane enhancers, and allows significant reductions in toxic emissions, without sacrificing fuel performance.  It would not be possible for most refiners to meet the year-round 15% reduction in toxic emissions required by the Clean Air Act in a cost-effective fashion without the dilution effect of oxygenates, such as ethanol.
<P>
<B><U>2.  Reduced Carbon Monoxide Emissions:</B></U><BR>Because ethanol has the highest oxygen content of any fuel additive, it provides the greatest reductions in carbon monoxide(CO).  EPA data demonstrates that a 10% ethanol blend will reduce CO as much as 30%.  As a result, the use of ethanol in the oxy-fuel program for CO nonattainment areas has been critically important to the success of that program.  Since 1992, when the oxy-fuel program began, more than a third of the CO nonattainment areas have been redesignated as in compliance.
<P>
In addition to being a deadly poison itself, CO is a recognized ozone precursor.  Recently, the National Academy of Science noted the role of CO in the formation of urban ozone in its report, <U>Rethinking the Ozone Problem in Urban and Regional Air Pollution</U>.  By dramatically reducing CO emissions, even in the summer months when CO pollution itself may not present a health hazard, ethanol helps to reduce urban ozone.
<P>
<B><U>3.  Reduced Exhaust VOC Emissions:</B></U> Unlike low-RVP gasoline which only reduces evaporative VOC emissions, oxygenates reduce exhaust VOC emissions.  Reductions in exhaust VOC's are particularly important because exhaust emissions are higher in reactivity (a measure of ozone-forming potential) than evaporative emissions.  Moreover, as a percentage of total VOC emissions, it is now generally accepted that exhaust VOC's contribute greater mass than evaporative VOC's, and are more important in terms of reducing ozone.
<P>
<B><U>4.  Lower Reactivity:</B></U>  Oxygenates displace other more reactive components currently used in gasoline.  For example, certain aromatics, such as xylene, and olefins are highly reactive and will greatly exacerbate urban ozone.  Oxygenates are far less reactive and contribute very little to the formation of ozone.  By displacing such components through the reformulation of gasoline, oxygenates help to reduce ozone even more than the reductions in mass VOC exhaust emissions attributable to oxygen content would suggest.
<P>
<B><U>5.  Reduced NOx Emissions:</B></U>  NOx is also necessary for the formation of urban ozone.  EPA's complex model demonstrates that for some fuel formulations the NOx reduction from oxygenates is quite significant.  The benefit is largely attributable to the dilution effect of oxygenates.  Ethanol displaces other components of gasoline, such as sulfur, that increase NOx emissions.
