<H1>SEA Alumni Activities and Events </H1>
<HR>

<P>
<I>Season's greetings to all and welcome to SEA's Alumni page! We're very excited that finally
we have launched ourselves into this world of Cyberspace and can
communicate with all of you who have been asking and asking &quot;when
will SEA have a home page on the Internet and an e-mail address?&quot;</I>
<P>
<I>This page is for you, so it would help us enormously if you
were to tell us just what sort of things you'd like to see. We appreciate the comments we've had so far and are working on incorporating what we can at this time. Meanwhile, we have a few items to share with you.</I><HR>

<H2> W-114 Homepage</H2>
The participants of W-114 have launched their own homepage in an
effort to pull their far-flung group together again.  We think the
idea is great and want to encourage others to join the effort.  Check it out at:

<H2>25th Anniversary Alumni Reunion</H2>

<P>
Mark Saturday, June 14, 1997 on your calendar for our 25th Anniversary Alumni Reunion.  This event will be for ALL CLASSES, whether it is a reunion year for you or not.  Celebrating our 25th year is such an exciting event that we wish to share it with as many alumni as can make it back to Woods Hole for that weekend! Both ships will be in port for daysails on the 14th, and when you are not out on the water you may attend various presentations on campus, visit with friends or explore old haunts.  Our barbecue will start at 5:30 p.m., followed by the SEA Memorabilia Auction, and then dancing to the great rhythms of the Atlantic Clarion Steel Band.  Invitations with details of all the events will be mailed out late April/early May.  In the meantime, if you want to book accommodations ahead of time, call Kate Parker at SEA and she will mail you a list of nearby hotels, B & Bs, campsights, etc.  Some classes are already planning their own mini-events for that weekend, so if you wish to initiate anything for your class, Kate would be happy to help you with that in any way she can.

<H2>Regional Alumni Events</H2>

<P>
During the fall there were a number of regional alumni gatherings. SEA President, Rafe Parker spent two weeks visiting colleges in the western part of the country, and was able to meet up with alumni in Boulder, Colorado Springs and San Francisco.  In addition, we had a wonderful event in Boston in November when Elsaesser Fellowship recipient Deborah Harrison (C-108)gave a presentation about her 6 month stay with the waSwahili of coastal East Africa.
<P>
Our next event, currently in the planning stages, is scheduled for mid-March in the Washington, DC area.  We'll have some form of presentation, followed by refreshments and an opportunity for alumni to acquaint and re-acquaint.  If you're living in the greater DC area, keep a lookout for a notice of this event in your mail probably late February or early March.  And if you are in that area and we don't have your current address, make sure you get that to us.  You can always e-mail it to: kparker@sea.edu.  There will also be an Alumni Council-sponsored "Spring Social" in April in Boston--no agenda other than to get together at some congenial venue.


<H2>Alumni Council</H2>

<P>
The semi-annual meeting of the Alumni Council will be held at the Charlestown Navy Yard on Saturday, January 25th. Any alum is welcome to attend.  Please contact Kate Parker for details.  The Alumni Council is currently 
focusing its attention on assisting our Admission Office with their enrollment efforts.  The Committee on Members is accepting nominations for the position of Alumni Trustee, so if you wish to submit your candidacy or nominate someone, please contact Kate Parker in the Alumni Relations office at SEA.
<P>
Finally, the Alumni Council Annual Fund Committee wishes to remind alumni that gifts are needed to help close the gap between tuition and expenses.  Please consider sending a special contributuion during SEA's 25th anniversary year.  We'd like to increase SEA's alumni participation above the current 34% level.  Call 800-552-3633 for more information.
