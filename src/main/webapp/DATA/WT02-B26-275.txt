Classification system for congenital heart diseases



<P>



b. March 18th, 1869, St. Andrew's East, Quebec d. September 2nd,



1940



<P>



Pathologist



<P>



Maude Abbott won a scholarship to McGill University, Montreal,



in her senior year of high school. She earned her BA and then



decided to study medicine. McGill at that time did not allow women



to enter its medical program, so Maude attended Bishop's College



and became a doctor in 1894. In 1897, she wrote a successful paper



on heart murmurs, but a male friend had to present it for her



since women were not admitted to the Montreal medical society



where she was to read her paper. In 1898 Maude was appointed curator



of McGill's Medical Museum. Here she began cataloguing specimens



and became interested in pathology, the study of disease. She



focused her studies on heart disease and began work on her book,



<I>The Atlas of Congenital Cardiac Disease</I>, in which she described



her new classification system. In 1923 she became Chief of Pathology



at a woman's medical college in Pennsylvania. In 1926 Maude returned



to McGill in Canada, where she pioneered the use of museum exhibits



as teaching aids. She also wrote a history of nursing which was



later used in nursing schools across the country. In 1936 her



atlas was published and was praised as an important addition to



medical knowledge. She was also made an honorary member of the



all-male Osler Society, named after <A HREF="#osler">Sir William Osler</A>,



a famous pathologist who had encouraged Maude in her studies.



On September 2nd, 1940, she suffered a cerebral hemorrhage and



died shortly after, at the age of 71.

<P>



Albert Aguayo is a neurophysiologist at the Montreal General Hospital.

He received his MD at the University of Cordoba, Argentina, in 1959



He proved that damaged nerve cells in animals can regenerate and



form new connections, which was regarded as impossible before



his revolutionary 1980 experiment on severed nerve fibers in the



rodent brain. Nerve cells do not die immediately when damaged



but may survive even for months. This survival provides opportunity



for healing, under the right conditions, such as the enveloping



presence of Schwann cells (support cells that provide structure



and insulation). Although actual cures of serious injuries have



not yet been achieved, more recent research with the optic nerves



indicates some recovery of function. He has been president of



the Society for Neuroscience, and is head of neurology and neuroscience



at Montreal General Hospital as well as head of a major center



of excellence known for studies of regeneration by neurons in



the brain. Dr. Aguayo is a recipient of the Gairdner Award, and WH Helmerich III

award



for Outstanding Achievement in retina research in 1991.

<P>Sterling Professor of Biology, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut







<P>Sid Altman grew up in Montreal but through a twist of fate attended MIT where he

received a B.Sc. in Physics. He then studied molecular biology under Lerman at the

University of Colorado Medical School. Lerman helped arrange for Altman to go to

England to work in the laboratory of S. Brenner and F. Crick. While there, in 1970,

Altman discovered an unusual enzyme involved in the transcription of DNA into

protein. He then moved to Yale University where his continued research showed that

the active part of the enzyme consisted of RNA (RiboNucleic Acid). This was

significant because RNA molecules are much more primitive than protein molecules.

Besides offering a possible explanation for how life might have begun billions of

years before proteins existed, it also hints at a way to beat a very troublesome

primitive life form: the virus for the common cold which is based on RNA. It may be

possible to design catalytic RNA-based vaccines that kill cold viruses by chopping up

the RNA on which they are based. Altman was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry,

1989; Rosenstiel Award for Basic Biomedical Research, 1989; National Institutes of

Health Merit Award, 1989; and Yale Science and Engineering Assn. Award, 1990

<P>



14 Nov 1891, Alliston, Ontario-d. 21 Feb 1941



<P>



Medical doctor



<P>



University of Toronto



<P>



Frederick Banting was born the son of a farmer. He became a doctor



and studied diabetes, a fatal disease. He and his colleague <A HREF="#best">Charles

Best</A>



discovered a hormone, called insulin, that helped people suffering



from diabetes live a normal life. Banting studied medicine at



the University of Toronto. He obtained his medical degree in 1916 and



served for the remainder of WW I as a medical officer overseas.



He was awarded the Military Cross for heroism under fire. Banting



later became interested in diabetes mellitus, a disease which



at that time meant a slow but certain death. Its chief biochemical



symptom is the presence of abnormally high glucose levels in the



blood, and the appearance of glucose in the urine. It had already



been proposed that a hormone produced by small patches of cells



called the Islets of Langerhans in the pancreas gland might prevent



diabetes. The research of Banting and his colleague Best resulted



in a way to isolate the hormone, called insulin, and extract it



for the use of those suffering from diabetes. The experiments



were completed in 1922, and in 1923 Banting was awarded the Nobel



Prize. Outraged that his co-worker had not also been awarded the



prize, he gave half his share to Best. The Banting Research Foundation



was established by Canadian Parliament that same year. With the



coming of WW II, Banting was again involved with medical war work



and died in a plane crash over Newfoundland.

<H2><A NAME="bell">Bell, Alexander Graham</A></H2>







<P>



Inventor of the telephone



<P>



b. 1874 Edinburgh, Scotland d. 1922



<P>



Bell was born in Edinburgh, Scotland.



Bell was a Scotsman who lived in the USA. He had a Summer home in Nova



Scotia but was never a Canadian. For a scientist to qualify as



Canadian, the simple rule is: they must have held Canadian citizenship



when they did their most distinguished work. 



We include him here because many people consider him Canadian.



<P>



Throughout his life Bell



was interested in the education of deaf people. Among his most



famous students was Helen Keller. His work with hearing and speech



led to his most famous invention, the telephone, in 1876. Although



the first phone conversation took place in the US, Bell said he



developed the idea in 1875 in Brantford, Ontario. It is certain



that many of his early experiments were conducted there, including



the first long distance telephone call, between Brantford and



Paris, Ontario. He also invented the microphone. The Bell Telephone



Company and other related businesses made Bell a wealthy man,



and he was able to pursue a wide range of scientific interests.



He spent his winters in the US on business, and summers in Cape



Breton Island, Nova Scotia, on scientific research, which ranged



from the genetics of sheep breeding to aviation. His Silver Dart



aircraft was the first to fly in Canada, in 1909, and his hydrofoil



speed boats held the world record for more than 10 years. Bell



died of diabetes in 1922, ironically the same year that <A HREF="#banting">Banting

</A>discovered



insulin. It is doubtful that he ever became a Canadian citizen.

<P>Boyle's family moved to Quebec, where he grew up in a log cabin and received no

formal education until high school. He went on to earn a Ph.D. in physics from McGill

University in 1950. Three years later, he joined Bell Laboratories. Boyle's major

contributions include the first continuously operating ruby laser, which he invented

with Don Nelson in 1962, and the first patent (with David Thomas) proposing a

semiconductor injection laser. Also in 1962 he became director of Space Science and

Exploratory Studies at Bellcomm, a Bell subsidiary providing technological support

for the Apollo space program. In 1964 he returned to Bell Labs, switching from

research to the development of electronic devices, particularly integrated circuits,

which are now essential building blocks in telecommunications and electronics in

general. In 1969, Boyle and George Smith invented the charge-coupled device (CCD).

CCDs can be used as imaging devices, memories, filters and signal processors. They

have revolutionized astronomy (the Hubble Space Telescope uses CCDs at its prime

focus) and created entirely new industries (e.g., filmless video cameras). For this

invention, Boyle and Smith were joint recipients of the Franklin Institute's Stuart

Ballantine Medal in 1973, and of IEEE's 1974 Morris Liebmann Award. In 1975, Boyle

returned to research as Executive Director of Research (see above) for Bell Labs,

where he was in charge of four laboratories until his retirement in 1979. He and his

Canada's first female nuclear physicist



<P>



b. 1876 Exeter, Ontario d. 1933



<P>



Harriet Brooks was Canada's first woman nuclear physicist. Harriet



was born in Exeter, Ontario in 1876. She graduated from McGill



University, Montreal, in 1898, with a BA in Mathematics and Natural



Philosophy. In 1899, she began research with Dr. Ernest Rutherford,



the famous physicist. He encouraged her and, in 1901, she became



the first woman to study at the Cavendish Laboratory at Cambridge



University, England, where she earned her MA. For a brief period



she also worked at Marie Curie's lab in France. A year later,



Harriet returned to McGill and her research with Dr. Rutherford.



She was the first person to realize that one element can change



into another. Harriet was also among the early discoverers of



radon and she was the first researcher to attempt to determine



its atomic mass. In 1907, she married Frank Pitcher, gave up her



work and raised three children. Harriet Brooks died in 1933, possibly



from a radiation-related illness.

at the University of Toronto (Ph.D., 



1951). From 1961 to 1967, he co-directed McGill University's High



Altitude Research Projectile (HARP) program. While testing missiles for a government



project called Velvet Glove, he realized that scientific instruments could also be



fired from a gun and survive, if put in a proper casing. This



led to his great dream--to build a supergun that could launch



objects like satellites into space for less cost than rockets



could. He was sentenced and jailed for one year



in 1980 for illegally selling weapons to South Africa. Then Saddam Hussein, leader of

Iraq, offered him a chance to



build his gun, but things went wrong, and Gerald Bull was killed



by assassins in 1990.

Thomas Chang was born in Swatow, a coastal town in southern China.



His grandfather was a general practitioner who rode a bicycle



to tend to farmers in the outlying villages. Years later, Chang,



while still an undergraduate at McGill, invented the world's first



artificial cell in 1957. His idea was to make tiny, ultrathin



plastic microcapsules that could hold biological agents (such



as enzymes). If he could control the permeability of the plastic



membrane, he could control what passed through the wall of his



artificial cell, and thus mimic many of the functions of real



cells. After earning his Ph.D. in physiology, Chang developed the



first artificial blood and a new cellular-based approach to an



artificial kidney, liver and pancreas. While various drawbacks



persist, Chang's inventions have proved useful as temporary measures



and in conjunction with other approaches. Chang is a



recipient of the Order of Canada.

<P>

<P>



Professor and cardiovascular and thoracic surgeon, Montreal General



Hospital Research Institute



<P>



Dr. Ray Chiu was born in Tokyo. He received his MD from National



Taiwan University, and his Ph.D. from McGill in 1970, in Experimental



Surgery. He pioneered a new type of experimental surgery that



removes some of a heart patient's back muscle, attaches it to



the ribs, and wraps it around the heart. A specially designed pacemaker contracts



the back muscle in time with the heart's own contractions, thus



helping a weak heart to function. 



Chiu was the first to overcome the physiological obstacles to



using other types of muscles to assist the heart's function. Heart



muscle is the only kind that can contract regularly without tiring;



other muscles require periods of rest. Thus the physiological



and chemical factors of the back muscle have to be modified to



become more like the heart. Collaborating with David Inuzzo, a



biochemist of York University, Chiu subjected the latissimus dorsi



muscle with four to six weeks of constant low frequency electrical



stimulation, after which it came to resemble the heart muscle.



The stimulation alters the expression of certain genes in the



muscle cells. The process was actually discovered by biochemists



in the late 60s, but was not applied to heart surgery until the



research came to the attention of cardiac surgeons in the last



decade. <P>

University of Western Ontario, 1960). Costerton was a University



of Calgary postdoctoral student in 1978 when he shook up the established



science of microbiology with a new view of bacterial life.  He and his team worked

out



a way to see the structure of the slimy substance that seemed



to anchor bacteria to surfaces in cattle stomachs. When they took



the bacteria into the lab and "purified" them, they became just



like ordinary bacteria. It became obvious that test-tube bacteria



are not the same as in life. Natural bacterial colonies were creating



their own microhabitat, adhering to surfaces and covering themselves



with a slimy protective layer of molecules Costerton dubbed "matrix-enclosed



biofilms." The researchers also found that biofilm bacteria



were often team players, different species working in physiological



co-operation.  Biofilms also survive under conditions



that floaters (individual bacteria released as scouts



from the biofilms themselves) can't; it takes up to 50 times the bactericide to



kill an attached slime population as it does to kill floaters.



Costerton and his team have applied their knowledge to developing



new technologies in areas ranging from oil production to bacteria-resistant



medical devices. He holds several biological patents and is president



of the Microbios company. He received the Haultain Prize in 1984



and the Isaac Walton Killam Memorial Prize in 1989, and holds



a NSERC industrial research chair.

In 1973, he was appointed Assistant Professor of Pathology at



Queen's University where his career as an independent investigator

Hans Fibiger was born in Denmark, and earned his B.Sc. at the University



of Victoria in 1966, and his Ph.D. at Princeton in 1970. He came



to the University of British Columbia in 1972, where he has conducted research into

the causes



of "anhedonia", or depression. His work shows that a



complex of neurons in the midbrain contains the neurotransmitter



dopamine, which is a an essential part of the electrochemical



process that we experience as pleasure or "reward".



This knowledge is the basis for the treatment of depression by



drugs that attempt to balance dopamine levels in the midbrain.



His laboratory was the first in the world to show that dopamine



neurons are associated with the feeling of reward or pleasure



that cocaine, d-amphetamine and other drugs provide. Fibiger is



among the 200 most-frequently quoted scientists in the world,



in any field. Recipient of 1993 BC Science and Engineering Gold



Medal Award in Health Sciences.

Geochemistry and global change



<P>



4 June 1927-Ashburn, New Zealand



<P>



Geochemist; professor emeritus, retired



<P>



Department of Geology, University of Western Ontario



<P>



William S. Fyfe is Canada's foremost earth scientist, widely considered



the world's most eminent geochemist. He grew up as the youngest



of three brothers on a farm in South Island, New Zealand, and



was the first student from his one-room school to attend university (B.Sc., Otago

University, New Zealand, 1948; M.Sc. 1949; Ph.D. 1952).



Early in his career, Fyfe's application of chemistry to geological



research earned him a reputation as the "Father of Modern



Geochemistry". He made important contributions to the knowledge



of isomorphism, studying the behaviour of rock forming minerals



under high temperature and stress. His investigation of metamorphism



- the chemical and physical transformation of rocks under pressure



and stress at the base of mountain systems - revolutionized the



field of Metamorphic Petrology. While Dean of Science at University of Western



Ontario  (1986-90), he established the Interface Science Research



Centre. Fyfe's Canadian research effort focused on the role of



fluids and tectonics in creating deposits of precious metals,



particularly gold. He did research on a range of biosphere-geosphere



interactions, including the role of micro-organisms in concentrating



metals and the role of geothermal systems in creating ocean nutrients.



Concerned with the environmental



implications of human energy consumption, Fyfe conducted research



into problems associated with the industrial exploitation of lignitic



coals. His knowledge of the geology of ancient rocks and the movement



of fluids in the Earth's crust were key to research into the possibility



of safe geological disposal of high-level nuclear wastes. As well,



he devoted attention to the genesis and conservation of Earth's



vulnerable fertile soils and the alarming current rate of soil



erosion. He led the establishment of the Global Change program,



a comprehensive international investigation of Earth's life-support



systems. He was awarded the Canada Gold Medal for Science and Engineering, NSERC, in

1991.<P>

about 1846 he developed experiments for distilling "coal



oil" from solid hydrocarbons and coined the name kerosene



for the lamp oil he perfected by 1853, and patented his processes



in 1854. His other inventions include one of the



first effective wood preservatives, a process of asphalt paving



for highways, briquettes made from compressed coal dust, and a



machine for insulating electric wire. After overseeing the setup of a factory on Long

Island,



he sold his patents in 1863 and returned to Halifax and a professorship

Phil Gold and Samuel Freedman discovered in 1965 a carcinoembryonic



antigen (CEA), produced during growth of cancer cells of the digestive

gut, pancreas and liver cells, but not by normal adult cells.



CEA enters the blood and thus a blood test or radioimmunoassay



was developed that can indicate the presence, spread or reoccurence



of cancer. The CEA assay has proved most useful in assessing the



extent of a cancer, its growth rate and response to treatment,



but not reliable in testing for the presence of tumors, since



early tumors do not produce enough CEA to be detected. The discovery



of CEA opened the new field of onco-fetal antigens. Recipient

The University of Alberta chemistry professor is a leader in the



development of miniature analytical systems. Micromachining techniques



are used to fabricate tiny three-dimensional structures that can



carry out chemical analyses on a piece of silicon a couple of



centimetres square. The result is a "lab-on-a-chip."



And the applications are diverse. They include immunological tests



for hormones and drugs of abuse, DNA diagnostics, tests for soil



and water contamination, and detection of biological warfare agents



on the battlefield. The small size of the devices would make test



kits easily portable, a key advantage for military and environmental



applications. As well, chemical analyses can be completed in seconds,



virtually eliminating any anxious waiting for test results. A



lab-on-a-chip also requires only a minute volume of test material



-- about one billionth of a millilitre, a "speck" to



non-scientists. Perhaps most amazing are the detection limits



of these devices. They are capable of detecting picomolar concentrations



-- that's like one Tylenol tablet dissolved in 12 Olympic-sized



swimming pools. "This is the sort of thing people react to



by saying 'wow.' Well, I feel that way too," says Dr. Harrison.

<P>Born of American parents, David Hubel grew up in Montreal. His father was a

chemist. He majored in physics at McGill University, and then became interested in

the medical world. So he enrolled in McGill's medical school, without ever having

taken a biology course. Hubel moved to Johns Hopkins in 1958, and teamed up with

Torsten Wiesel from Sweden. The pair began to make key discoveries about the visual

cortex almost immediately. A year later they moved to Harvard Medical School,

continuing their experiments. Throughout the 60s and 70s, Hubel and Wiesel

co-authored a series of ground-breaking papers on the visual cortex. They used

microelectrodes and modern electronics to detect the activity of individual neurons,

using cats as their subjects. (The cats were not harmed by these experiments; indeed,

their purring created vibration problems.) They found that stimulation of cells on

the retina by light causes activity in particular cells in the striate cortex, where

cells are arranged in columns and layers. This cell activation is surprisingly

specific: some cells respond to spots of light, others to lines whose tilt is

critical. Still others respond only to specific movements or to specific colours.

Thanks to the work of Hubel and Wiesel, the visual cortex has become the best known

part of the brain. Hubel and Wiesel shared the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1981.

<P>When Werner Israel was five years old, his family emigrated to South Africa. When

both his parents fell seriously ill, Werner and his brother spent four years in the

Cape Jewish Orphanage, where he saw astronomical slide shows presented by a high

school teacher. Soon he spent hours in the public library, reading every astronomy

book available. He tackled difficult mathematics since he wanted to know how anyone

could make assertions about the core temperatures of the sun. He entered the

University of Cape Town in 1949 and took courses in physics and mathematics, since

none were offered in astronomy. Despite family difficulties, Israel completed his

M.Sc. in Applied Mathematics in one year. Israel went to Dublin and joined the Dublin

Institute for Advanced Studies for two years. Then he moved to Edmonton, Alberta, in

1958, since Max Wyman, a famous physicist, was there. Israel was the first to guess,

and to make contributions toward proving, that Roy Kerr's new solution of Einstein's

field equations were crucial to what became known as a black hole. Israel also

contributed seminal papers on the thermofield dynamics of black holes and on thin

shells of matter. His paper on filamentary structures anticipated cosmic string

theory. He received the Izaak Walton Killam Prize in 1984.

Theoretical solid state physics; theory of high temperature superconductors



<P>Department of Physics, McMaster University.



<P>



It was only



by chance that Dr. Kallin, now recognized as one of the top condensed



matter theorists in the world, got into physics. In high school



she dropped physics after Grade 10. It was a community college



course in "physics for poets" that piqued her interest



in the subject and led her to the honours physics program at the



University of British Columbia. Catherine Kallin and her collaborators have been

studying microwave



measurements on high-temperature superconductors, and using the



data to determine the electrical and magnetic properties of these



superconductors and to understand why the materials are superconductors



at all. "Our traditional understanding of superconductors,



which were discovered in 1911, strongly suggests that superconductivity



shouldn't exist above 30 degrees Absolute (-243 degrees Celsius),"



explains Dr. Kallin. But "high-temperature" superconductivity



(above 30 degrees Absolute) was discovered in 1986, and in subsequent



years the temperature escalated to the present record of 160 degrees



Absolute (-113 degrees Celsius). "There's a large body of



evidence that points to electron-electron interactions as the



cause of high-temperature superconductivity. But we're just now



starting to address the question of what this means for the electrical



and magnetic properties of these materials."

<P>



Charles ("Charley") Krebs grew up in a small Illinois town near St. Louis, Missouri.

All through his high school years, Krebs worked for a St. Louis fur trading company

harvesting seals in the Bering Sea during his summer vacations. After getting his

bachelors degree from the University of Minnesota (1957), Krebs came to Vancouver,

BC, to study with Dennis Chitty who was (and still is) the world expert on lemmings.

Krebs obtained an MA (59) and a Ph.D. (62) in Zoology from the University of British

Columbia. Then, after a two-year fellowship at Berkeley, he went back home to teach

Zoology at Indiana University. But in 1970 <A

HREF="http://www.bcu.ubc.ca/~kyba/brochure/faculty/krebs.html">Krebs</A> returned to

Vancouver and has been there ever since as a professor of Zoology at UBC.  Krebs has

spent his working life trying to unravel the mystery of lemmings and other small

Northern mammals whose populations crash regularly every four to ten years. The Krebs

Effect, also known as the Fence Effect, is named after Krebs.  He simply fenced in an

area of grassland the size of a soccer field to see what would happen to the

population of voles living inside the fence. (The fence extends down into the soil

several inches to stop tunneling.) Within a year, he found the population of voles

increased about 5 times. Over the years Krebs has systematically eliminated possible

reasons for the Fence Effect. Krebs now believes that the effect is due to social

behaviour among the voles. This includes the natural genetic selection for more

aggressive individuals over time as living conditions become more crowded. The final

crash seems to be caused by an increased tendency for mothers to kill all the babies

in neighbouring nests.

Raymond Lemieux grew up in the toughest part of Edmonton, Alberta. His father was a

poor carpenter. His sister had a friend who was a graduate student in physics, which

helped point Lemieux towards university. He went to the University of Alberta, and

got his B.Sc. in Honours Chemistry. His teacher of Organic Chemistry was Reuben

Sandin, who inspired Lemieux to pursue this subject. Later he got his Ph.D. from

McGill University in Organic Chemistry. He took his postdoctoral studies with M. L.

Wolfrom at Ohio State University, studying the degradation of streptomycin. Lemieux

first achieved fame for the synthesis of sucrose. His second major contribution was

pioneering work on configurational determination by NMR spectroscopy. He invented the

olefin cleaving reagent with von Rudloff in 1955, as well as many other reagents in

his career. He has also done important work with antibiotics, and started a couple of

research companies, including Chembiomed Ltd. with the University of Alberta. In

1973, he began his famous work on the synthesis of human blood group determinants,

and in 1975 published the first synthesis of the B human system trisaccharide. He

later synthesized the carbohydrate sequences for six different blood group

determinants. These achievements are important to the chemistry of immunology.

Lemieux's current work deals with molecular recognition in biological processes. He

has received numerous awards, including the Albert Einstein World Award in Science in

1992 and the Gairdner Foundation International Award in 1985.

<P>



Dr. Li, now a professor at the University of Waterloo (Ph.D. at Cornell University),

is playing



a key role in developing and demonstrating the power of Kolmogorov



complexity. His book (co-authored with Paul Vit&aacute;nyi), <I>An



Introduction to Kolmogorov Complexity and Its Applications</I>,



was the first comprehensive book in this field. It is used to



teach graduate seminar courses all over the world.



The power of Kolmogorov complexity is that it



allows scientists to quantify the randomness of individual objects



in an objective and absolute manner. This is impossible using



classical probability theory. For example, in computer science



it is often necessary to determine how fast a certain program



runs. Using conventional methods, this is very difficult because



the program must be run with a large number of inputs, each result



analyzed, and an average time arrived at. Using Kolmogorov complexity,



only one input is needed to complete the analysis. In one area



of his current research (which also includes machine learning



and computational biology), Dr. Li is extending the use of Kolmogorov



complexity in the analysis of computer programs, DNA sequence



analysis, physics and computation. Others are following his lead.

Vice President of British Columbia Cancer Research Center, and Assistant Dean of the

Faculty of Medicine, University of British Columbia.

<P>



Dr Ling's 1974 discovery of P-glycoprotein, which is encoded by the multidrug

resistant gene (MDR) made him world famous. It is now known that P-glycoprotein is

not only

important clinically, as it confers multidrug resistance in many cancers, it is also

very important in basic research, as it has been found to protect the brain from

cytotoxic substances. P-Glycoprotein is the first protein discovered in humans that

belongs to a group of membrane transport proteins called the ATP Binding Cassette

(ABC). ABC is very important in maintaining normal cell functions. Mutations in this

group of proteins causes many well known diseases. One example is the cystic fibrosis

transmembrane regulator (CFTR), which is responsible for <A

<P>

Dr Ling has won many international awards including the 1990 Gairder award, the 1991

General Motors Cancer Research Foundation award, the Kettering 

Prize, the 1991 Joseph Steiner Cancer Research award, and the 1993 American

Association of Cancer Research(AACR scientific award. To date, Ling is the only

person in the world to have won both the Kettering and Steiner awards, the highest

honours in cancer research.

Masui and his students, working with basic equipment and modest

of cell division in all organisms. Masui credits some of his success



to an advisor at Yale University, who recommended he concentrate



on low-budget research techniques that would allow him to perform



good work despite limited funds. Also at the University of Toronto's Zoology



Department, Masui invented many original techniques to assist



his studies of cell division: a quantitative method for microinjection



in 1971; microextraction in 1976; cell-free "in-vitro"



mitosis in 1983. Masui's microinjection technique enabled him



to directly transfer into cells controlled amounts of Maturity



Promoting Factor (MPF) that initiates cell division and the Cytostatic



factor that stops it, confirming their role in cell growth. Recipient

Developed gate-control theory of pain

<P>



neurophysiology



<P>



Research Director, Pain Clinic, Montreal General Hospital; E.P.



Taylor Chair in Pain Studies at McGill , MGH; Professor of psychology,



McGill University



<P>



After studying for his Ph.D. in 1954 with <A HREF="#hebb">D. O. Hebb</A>



at McGill University, Melzack began to work with patients who



suffered from "phantom limb" pain, i.e. people who feel



pain in an arm or leg that has been removed. He found that pain



often has little survival value, and some pains are entirely out



of proportion to the degree of tissue damage, sometimes continuing



long after injured tissues have healed. While still a postdoctoral



student, Melzack began collecting "pain words" and putting



them into classes that belonged together, like "hot,"



"burning," "scalding," and "searing."



In 1975, this pursuit led to the development of the McGill Pain



Questionnaire, now used in pain clinics and cancer hospices around



the world. Eventually Melzack with his colleague Patrick Wall



developed the gate-control theory of pain at MIT in 1965, which



states that pain is `gated' or modulated by past experience, i.e.



perceiving a specific stimulus as pain is a decision of the nervous



system. Gate-control theory led to the valuable discovery of endorphins



and enkephalins, the body's "natural opiates." Melzack's



recent research at McGill indicates that there are two types of



pain, transmitted by two separate sets of pain-signaling pathways



in the central nervous system. Sudden, short-term pain, such as



the pain of cutting a finger, is transmitted



by a group of pathways that Melzack calls the "lateral"



system, because they pass through the brain stem on one side of



its central core. Prolonged pain, on the other hand, such as chronic back



pain, is transmitted by the "medial" system, whose neurons



pass through the central core of the brain stem. Melzack is the author of <I>The

Challenge



of Pain </I>(with Patrick Wall) 1982, 2nd ed. 1988, and <I>Textbook of Pain</I>



(ed. with Wall) 1984, 2nd ed. 1989 and is co-editor of <I>Handbook of Pain



Assessment</I>, 1992. He has also published books of Eskimo stories and won the

Canada Council Molson Prize in 1985.

<P>



Developed the Michaelis-Menten equation for enzyme kinetics.



<P>



b. 1879 Harrison, BC, d. 1960



<P>







Maude Menten was one of the most versatile, innovative investigators in



chemistry in the early part of the century. Born in 1879, she grew up in 



Harrison Hot Springs, BC. She received her



BA in 1904 and her MD in 1911 from the University of Toronto. She was a



demonstrator of physiology in MacCallum's laboratory at the University of



Toronto, but she had to leave Canada to pursue a career as a research 



scientist. In those days women were not allowed to do research in Canadian



universities. She became a research fellow at the Rockefeller Institute, and a

research fellow at Western Reserve University. Then she went to



study in Berlin with Leonor



Michaelis, and the <A

HREF="http://dept.physics.upenn.edu/courses/gladney/mathphys/explorer/subsection4_1_6.html">Michaelis-Menten

equation</A> was developed.



This equation gives an expression for the rate of an enzyme reaction



and became fundamental to the interpretation of how an enzyme reacts



on its substrate.  Ultimately, Menten earned a Ph.D. in biochemistry



at the University of Chicago. She later became a professor on the



faculty of the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine. In



histochemistry, her publication in 1944 of a new technique for the



demonstration of the enzyme alkaline phosphatase ushered in the new



azo-dye method.

Dr. Margaret Newton was born in North Nation Mills, Quebec in



1887. She earned money to attend university by teaching and entered



MacDonald College, McGill's agricultural school. She earned top



marks and won the Governor General's medal. Margaret decided to



major in plant pathology (the study of plant diseases). She graduated



with her BA in 1918, followed by her MA the next year. None of



these achievements were easy; she had to fight for the same access



to the labs which male students had. Margaret's graduate work



was done in Minnesota and Saskatchewan with two wheat rust experts,



Dr. E.C. Stakeman and Dr. W.P. Thompson. She received her Ph.D.



in 1922, the first Canadian woman to receive a doctorate in agricultural



science, and taught at the University of Saskatchewan. In 1925,



Dr. Newton was appointed head of the new Dominion Rust Research



Laboratory at the University of Manitoba. Dr. Newton became the



best-known Canadian expert in stem rust, a fungus which destroys



wheat, and her work helped find ways to fight the disease. Crop



losses, which had once been at least 30 million bushels, fell



to almost nothing. She was the first graduate from an agricultural



college to be awarded the prestigious Flavelle Medal from the



Royal Society of Canada. She was also given the Outstanding Achievement



Award from the University of Minnesota in 1956. In 1969, the University



of Saskatchewan made her an honorary Doctor of Laws. She was forced



to retire in 1945 due to poor health. Dr. Newton died in Victoria,



BC in 1971.

1968. He is currently



a professor of chemistry at Acadia University and is famous for



synthesizing RNA, important to many areas of medical research.



He worked for 20 years before he achieved this goal at McGill



University in 1987. Synthesizing RNA could lead to breakthroughs



in diseases caused by viruses. In medical research, the availability



of synthetic RNA is making possible the development of new drugs



that were previously beyond the reach of science. These drugs



will consist of RNA sequences tailor-made to attach to certain



types of viruses and interfere with their ability to replicate



themselves. In 1980, he also invented the automated gene synthesizer,



or "gene machine," which made it possible to build DNA



sequences in a matter of hours rather than months, and which he



used in the synthesis of RNA. The gene machine was manufactured



by Bio Logicals, Canada's first publicly traded biotechnology



company, for which Ogilvie was a scientific consultant. He is



the author of 12 patents and a drug called Glanciclovir, which



fights the cytomegalovirus or CMV. He won the Buck-Whitney Medal in 1983, and the

Manning Principal award in 1991.

that govern the evolution of the atmosphere. Robert was the only



scientist in the world between 1963 and 1970 to attempt to produce



meteorological forecasts with a spectral model--and the semi-Lagrangian



scheme, where he combined existing Lagrangian methods with his



semi-implicit scheme.



In contrast to many scientists in this field who aim primarily



at improving accuracy, he always professed to devise efficient



numerical methods, that is to say, to attain a given degree of



precision with the least amount of computation. The methods that



he developed are now used in models of the world's largest weather



prediction and climate research centres.

Charles Scriver is the reason vitamin D is put in Canadian milk,



thanks to his study of rickets in Quebec children. He's also done



work on identifying genetic predisposition to disease and raising

on Quebec's health care system, which became the first in the



world to provide a system for identifying genetically predisposed



diseases and nutritional information to help overcome these conditions.



He was also involved in the inception of the Human Genome Project,



though his research focus has been more towards genetic variation



rather than gene identification and cloning. Thanks to Scriver's



work, the Interuniversity Institute for Research on Populations



(IREP) maintains a database on the Quebec population and is able



to track genes such as phenylalanine hydroxylase, involved in



a form of mental retardation which can be avoided with early treatment.

<P>Michael Smith was born into a working-class family in Blackpool, England. Smith

was offered a scholarship to a local private school called Arnold School. Eventually

he entered the honours chemistry program at Manchester University and got a state

scholarship and completed a Ph.D. In 1956 he heard of a young scientist in Vancouver,

Canada, Gobind Khorana, who had a position available to work on biologically

important molecules with phosphates. Going to Vancouver turned out to be a very good

decision, because in Khorana's lab Smith began learning the chemistry that would lead

to the Nobel Prize in 1993. Smith's idea for which he won the Nobel prize was to slip

a synthetic stretch of nucleotides--called an oligonucleotide--into some DNA on one

side. The synthetic segment is added to normal DNA using standard chemicals for

breaking and reforming DNA chains, but putting an Adenine molecule where there should

be a Guanine to create a mutation. It took Smith and his team many years of work to

actually do it. In the process they had to learn new techniques, design new chemicals

and develop new chemical processes. One of the chemical methods developed by Smith is

now used in every modern automated gene synthesizer machine.

<P>Richard E. Taylor was nearly ten years old when World War II began, which he

credits for sparking his interest in physics when the atomic bomb ended the war. He

physics, and got his Master's degree from the same institution. Then he went to

Stanford, California, and after two years joined the High Energy Physics Laboratory,

working with the new linear accelerator. By the early 60s he was working on the

design of the experimental areas of the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC),

helping to build the equipment and taking part in electron scattering experiments.

Along with Jerome Friedman and Henry Kendall of MIT, Taylor won the Nobel Prize in

Physics in 1990 for work the trio had done from 1967 to 1973. They provided the first

experimental evidence that protons and neutrons, once believed indivisible, are made

Dr. Terzopoulos, a University of Toronto computer science professor, has made

significant contributions to computer vision and computer graphics and is now also

doing pioneering work in artificial life. He got his university education at McGill

University and MIT (Ph.D. '84, MIT; M.Eng. '80 EE, B.Eng. '78 Hons. EE, McGill). His

virtual fish are computational models that capture the physics of the animal in its

environment, as well as its locomotion, perception, behavior and learning. (View <A

HREF="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~dt">Dr. Terzopoulos's fish </A>on the World Wide

Web.) In the context of computer animation, Dr. Terzopoulos's fish are not just

highly realistic graphical puppets, but are autonomous artificial creatures. They

swim, forage, eat and mate on their own. He says the goal of his visual modeling

research is to bridge the gap between computer vision and computer graphics, which

have hitherto developed independently of one another as major fields of computer

science. "Graphics involves creating images from models, while vision involves

creating models from images," he says. Dr. Terzopoulos has also done important work

on human facial modeling. He has produced what is widely recognized as the most

realistic biomechanical/expressive model of the human face to date. Modeling faces

can play a role in planning reconstructive facial surgery and predicting its results.

It is also a central concern for automated face recognition and video compression for

teleconferencing. He is the recipient of the 1996 Steacie Memorial Fellowship.

Eva Turley studied biology at University of British Columbia, Vancouver. While still
