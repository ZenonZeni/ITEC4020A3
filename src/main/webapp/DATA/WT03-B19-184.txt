<H1>Infrastructure cost trends</H1>
<P>
The analysis by KPMG Management Consulting demonstrates that
infrastructure services are very competitively priced and of high
quality. These services are provided in a domestic environment
which provides for continuing competitive pricing for these services.
importantly, the services are provided within a very stable regulatory
framework which provides certainty for industrial investors in
measuring the costs and other commitments they have to meet in
developing new projects.
<P>
This may not be the case in a location where the regulatory environment
is less mature and where, as a consequence, user charges and regulatory
obligations may escalate. <p>
