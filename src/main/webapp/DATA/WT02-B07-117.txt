<h2>Restricting Pornography</h2>
<p>
<h3>Protecting children from exposure to pornography on the Internet and cable television, and from the sexual exploitation of child pornographers.</h3>
<p>
<b>1. Enactment of legislation to protect children from being exposed to pornography on the Internet</b>
<p>
Pornography, both soft core and hard core, is freely available on the Internet to virtually anyone with a home computer. Several magazines post pornographic images that can be viewed by anyone, including children, for free. There are also numerous sites on the Internet where hard core pornography depicting a variety of explicit acts, even rape scenes and bestiality, are available free and can be accessed with a few clicks of a computer button.
<p>
Christian Coalition urges Congress to enact legislation to protect children from being exposed to pornography on the Internet. Criminal law should be amended to prohibit distribution of, or making available, any pornography,, soft core or hard, to children, and to prohibit distribution of obscene hard core pornography to adults.
<p>
<b>2. Enactment of legislation to require cable television companies to completely block the video and audio on pornography channels to non-subscribers.</b>
<p>
Many children throughout the country are exposed to pornography, often hard core, on cable television because of incomplete scrambling of the signal on pornography channels. Cable companies have asserted that it is the parents' responsibility to guard their children. Christian Coalition believes that the responsibility should be on the cable companies to help parents keep pornography out of their homes. Cable companies should not be allowed to transmit pornography to non-subscribers. We urge Congress to require cable television companies to completely block the video and audio on pornography channels to non-subscribers.
<p>
<b>3. Amending the federal child pornography law to make illegal the possession of any child pornography</b>
<p>
Sexual exploitation of children though child pornography continues to be a major problem in society. Possession of child pornography should be a crime. President Reagan proposed such a law in 1988, hoping that those with collections of child pornography would destroy them for fear of federal prosecution.  In an 11th hour compromise on the bill, however, a conference committee of House and Senate members changed the Reagan bill to criminalize only the possession of "three or more" items of child pornography, videos, magazines, etc. Thus, federal low sanctions the possession of some child pornography -- less than three pieces. A person with two hour-long videotapes depicting the rape of a child cannot be charged with a federal crime, yet a person with three photos depicting a child in a lascivious pose can. Christian Coalition urges that the federal child pornography law should be amended to make illegal possession of any child pornography.
