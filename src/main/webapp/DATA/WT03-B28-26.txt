ECHOSTAR LAUNCHES SATELLITE AND ACQUIRES ANOTHER DBS PERMIT

     Echostar last week launched its Lockheed Martin Echostar-1
satellite on Long March, 2nd consecutive success and major boost
for trouble-plagued Chinese rocket.  Echostar, headed by Chmn.-CEO
Charles Ergen, also announced plans to take over Direct Bcstg.
Satellite Corp. (DBSC) in return for cash or shares of Echostar
stock valued at $9.7 million, subject to FCC and SEC approvals. 
Echostar already owned 40% of DBSC, which has FCC licenses to build
2 DBS satellites with 22 channels.  Echostar has approval for 21
DBS transponders.  DBSC recently received extension of its
construction permit until Nov. 30, 1998 (SW Dec 11 p6).  Echostar
said it completed previously announced reorganization of operating
subsidiaries Dec. 22.  Action followed exercise of virtually all of
warrants to buy 3.7 million shares of Class A common, allowing
subsidiaries to become 100% owned instead of 95%, Echostar said.

     DBSC Chmn.-CEO Harley Radin said his slot at 61.5 degrees W is
exempt from new FCC "single spectrum cap" rule for DBS providers. 
Rule limits each company to single slot for full-continental U.S.
service.  Radin said DBSC satellite can serve West Coast from its
assigned slot but elevation angles are lower there, meaning that
potential for signal blockage from mountains or buildings is
greater.  That doesn't necessarily have adverse impact on business
case for slot, he said, because "what you lose in the west you gain
in the east."  In exempting 61.5 degrees slot from spectrum cap,
FCC said that "while it appears that nationwide service from that
location is a technical possibility, as a practical matter such
service would not be comparable to service from 101 degrees, 110
degrees or 119 degrees" because of increased probability of
interference in west.

     DBSC will become Echostar subsidiary, although role of Radin
in merged company hasn't been determined, Echostar spokeswoman
said.  Echostar had bought 40% of DBSC in 1994.  DBSC holds FCC DBS
permits to operate 11 channels at 61.5 degrees W and another 11 at
175 degrees W, Radin said.  DBSC has contract with Lockheed-Martin
to build 2 A2100 satellites, first scheduled for July 1997
delivery, other year later, he said.  Each carries 32 transponders
of 115 w each and contains technology that can double transmission
power to 230 w using 16 transponders.  Echostar has FCC permit to
operate 21 transponders at 119 degrees W.

     Echostar-1 will carry first 65-70 channels for service
scheduled to go on line in Feb.-March, spokeswoman said.  Service,
originally scheduled to be available in Sept., was delayed by
investigation that followed explosion of Long March rocket in Jan.
1995.  Echostar's Digital Sky Highway Network (DISH) is expected to
be in service by Feb. with 65 channels and another 65 added with
launch of Echostar-2 in July-Sept.  In competing with Digital
Satellite Service (DSS), Primestar and AlphaStar, Echostar has said
it plans to focus on satellite dealers, while alliance with Philips
brings Magnavox brand product to consumer electronics retailers. 
Although Echostar hasn't set pricing, it indicated in prospectus
that hardware would be priced around $500, with monthly programming
fee starting at $20.

     While Echostar hasn't reported plans for international market,
Radin said satellite at 61.5 degrees W potentially could supply
programming for Portugal, Spain and U.K. as well as Mexico, Latin
and South America.  Any plans for international service will
require FCC approval, which is reviewing Radin's request (and those
of other operators) to provide international service from domestic
slot.  Radin said that while Echostar hasn't made plans for
international DBS, officials there "are enthusiastic for an
international initiative."

     Meanwhile, Thomson Consumer Electronics, RCA Digital Satellite
System manufacturer, said it didn't renew distribution contract
with Echostar Communications since latter plans to launch own DBS
system to compete with DirecTV and USSB, which use DSS equipment. 
Thomson gave 4 of its remaining TVRO distributors expanded
territories:  Warren Companies, Sioux Falls, S.D., grows by 7
states and Northern Cal.;  Consumer Satellite Service (CSS),
Indianapolis, adds 3 states;  DSI, Urbandale, Ia., expands by 5
states;  Earth Terminal, Bow, N.H., adds 4 states.

DSS PRICING FOLLOWS CONSUMER ELECTRONICS TREND -- DOWN

     As Digital Satellite System (DSS) pricing continues to drop
and competition increases, entry-level product appears poised to
dip below $300.  Thomson Consumer Electronics (TCE) low-end RCA DSS
system that started 1995 at $699, was being advertised by year-end
at $499, and retailers said profit is in danger of drying up.  To
combat falling prices, some retailers are focusing on step-up RCA
and Sony DSS products that promise 20-25% profit margins, but
slower sales.  Overall, 1995 sales of RCA/GE and Sony DSS to
dealers were expected to top 1.5 million, while Primestar reported
close to million subscribers.

     "You've got some very big players coming into the business [in
1996] and many aren't going to be able to take the high road,"
Harvey Electronics Vp Franklin Karp said.  "I would say you are 6
to 12 months away from a $199-$299 DSS."  Lower retail prices are
expected as Daewoo, Sanyo, Samsung, Toshiba and Uniden enter DSS
race, with Uniden already indicating it may price product in
$499-$549 range.  Alphastar and Echostar also are planning to
introduce own services -- latter partnering with Philips to bring
Magnavox product to retail.  Even Primestar, which primarily has
leased equipment to consumers, has tested sales through group cable
operator TCI.

     "We fully expect DSS to be discounted over time and we have 2
powerful weapons to deal with that method of distribution -- RCA
and GE," TCE Senior Vp James Meyer said.  GE DSS has been
advertised at $449 and even entry-level Sony model, which
originally had $749 suggested price tag, was featured in Wiz ad at
$648.

     Rapid decline in pricing doesn't seem to faze suppliers, which
have said DSS may follow same path as cellular telephones where
hardware is offered virtually free and profits are made on service. 
Echostar spokeswoman conceded as much.  Echostar hasn't formally
released pricing, but said in stock prospectus that hardware
retails could hit $500, with programming at $20.

     Alphastar has said it will avoid selling own brand at retail,
relying instead on combination of Amway, satellite distributors and
multilevel marketing.  Company signed agreement with Samsung
Electromechanics in Aug. to build integrated receiver decoders
(IRDs) and said it's seeking similar agreement with 2nd supplier. 
Samsung and 2nd supplier are expected to sell branded product to CE
dealers.  "I would think that for this product the equipment would
pass the cost curve much more rapidly than the marketing cost of
attracting a subscriber," said Alphastar Pres.-CEO Murray
Klippenstein, whose company plans to launch 120-channel service in
1996 first quarter with hardware packages at $600-$700.  "When that
happens, it makes sense to give the box away because the long-term
value is in the subscription."

     With so many satellite systems to choose from, future hinges
on manufacturers' ability differentiate products.  Many retailers
have said they won't give category same amount of shelf space as
other products such as VCRs, meaning that suppliers will be
battling for every square inch.  "When you can't [tell
differences], you end up dealing with a price issue and end up with
$499 satellite systems," Tops Appliance City Senior Vp-Gen. Mdse.
Mgr. Rick Jones said.

ALPHASTAR SETS PLANS FOR NEW SATELLITE SERVICE

     AlphaStar will launch medium-power satellite service late in
first quarter priced at $600-$700 for hardware, with sales limited
to distributors and direct marketers, Pres.-CEO Murray Klippenstein
said.  Company will sell single integrated receiver decoder (IRD)
with 30" dish and remote control to dealers through distributor
O'Rourke Bros. and to consumers through Amway and multilevel
marketer United Digital Bcstg. Corp.  Programming will be sold in
packages at $24-$49 monthly, with some offering 40 video and 30
audio channels.  Premium pay packages and a la carte channels will
retail at $4.95-$14.95 per month, with 16 PPV channels at $2.99 per
movie.

     Full 120-channel service, to be available 2-3 weeks after
launch, will consist of 85 video, 30 audio and 3-5 data services. 
IRD contains RS232 port to connect with PC to download data
services and access Internet, Klippenstein said.  IRD also will use
MPEG-2 data transmission and have LED.

     To gain entry to consumer electronics retail, AlphaStar said
it's negotiating with several manufacturers to build product for
sale under own brand name.  First such accord was signed with
Samsung early in 1995 and it expects product to be available late
in 1996 first quarter, Klippenstein said.  "We're targeting
specific customer bases rather than going with a mass market
approach that requires huge inputs of advertising, media and
consumer electronics distribution," Klippenstein said.

     Although $600-$700 is above AlphaStar's original target of
$500, Klippenstein said retail would drop $100 per year.  He said
AlphaStar service will break even with sales of 500,000 units,
estimated to be 12-18 months after launch.  Service is in first
round of beta test consisting of 300-400 units in Canada and is
expected to enter U.S. with another 400 in Jan., Klippenstein said. 
Second beta test will use uplink center in Oxford, Conn., he said.

     AlphaStar is in "serious discussions" with several possible
investors, Klippenstein said.  Potential partners would buy equity,
although he would identify them only as in "broad genre of
telecommunications."  AlphaStar also recently cut stock offering to
2.1 million shares from 4 million, reducing amount expected to be
raised to $37 million from $51 million.

     AlphaStar first will provide service using AT&T Telstar 402R
with 32 Ku-band 60-w transponders, launched Sept. 23.  By mid-1977,
it will switch to Telstar 5 100-w satellite, where it will lease 16
Ku-band transponders.

CLINTON VETOES DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION INCLUDING SPACE SYSTEMS
FUNDING

     President Clinton last week vetoed FY 1996 Defense
Authorization bill that would have included hundreds of million of
dollars for new satellite systems and space technology.  He said he
vetoed bill because it included $450 million for new ballistic
missile defense system that would have included space-based element
for deployment by 2003.  Congressional Democrats had argued that
system would violate Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty with former
Soviet Union, and Clinton said it was costly and unnecessary to
protect U.S. from long-range missiles in that way.  Republicans
said treaty is outdated product of Cold War and said several
countries in addition to Russia are developing nuclear weapons
capable of reaching U.S.  Democrats said they don't have serious
objections to other space aspects of bill and it's likely that
authorization for those programs would remain virtually unchanged
in any future legislation.

     Included in vetoed bill was major cutback in spending for U.S.
spy satellite program.  Although Congress had earmarked $28 billion
for intelligence activities this year, National Reconnaissance
Office (NRO), supersecret agency that oversees spy satellites,
wouldn't have gotten its usual share.  Congress, upset over
revelations last year that office was building secret new facility
in Va. for $302 million and that it had carried over $1.2 billion
in leftover money from previous year's budget, cut more than $1
billion from NRO's $9 billion authorization.  Most of that money
has been transferred to Pentagon's general budget.

     Cuts in reconnaissance budget didn't come as surprise and
probably would be supported by Democrats, who have backed reduced
spending for other civil space programs, including NASA's satellite
operations.  Lawmakers including Rep. Castle (R-Del.), House
Intelligence Committee member, had indicated during authorization
discussions earlier in year that tightening budgets would mean spy
satellite programs probably would have to go way of NASA -- toward
smaller, cheaper spacecraft and less expensive launch providers. 
Castle in Sept. said govt. also would have to start using more
commercially developed technologies where appropriate.  If
cost-saving measures aren't taken, he said, "we will be faced with
truly unpalatable choices," including devoting greater percentage
of intelligence budget to satellites or forgoing or eliminating
"much-needed" satellite capabilities to fund other programs.

     Also in authorization legislation was $30 million for new
antisatellite program that would have resulted in production of 10
missiles over next 4 years with capability of shooting down enemy
intelligence satellites in low-earth orbit.  Another $250 million
would have been authorized for deployment of Space & Missiles
Tracking System, with full satellite constellation deployment by
2003.  Although it would have played role in BMD project, this
system also would have been used to track U.S. and allied launchers
and spacecraft.

     In area of GPS, authorization bill would have required Defense
Secretary William Perry to turn off selective availability (SA)
signals by May 1 unless he submits to Congress plans for:  (1) New
way to deny enemies ability to use GPS for military purposes
without denying U.S. civil and military users access to signal. 
(2) Development of new receivers and other techniques for weapons
and weapons systems that would provide "substantially improved"
resistance to jamming and other forms of electronic interference. 
Effect of SA turn-off would have been minimal on commercial users
since most already use differential GPS, which is more accurate
than GPS with or without selective availability.  Ann Ciganer,
exec. dir.-policy, GPS Industry Council, said aim of Congress
actually was to "send a strong message" that Defense Dept. needs to
develop electronic countermeasures to prohibit hostile powers from
using GPS against U.S. interests.

     Meanwhile, more than dozen military and commercial satellites,
including some that recently have been repositioned over Bosnia,
now are providing communications, weather and navigation for U.S.
and other troops in region, Pentagon said.  Spokesman said most
important will be earth imaging applications, provided by Spot
Image and others, and GPS technology that will help pilots of
military cargo planes and warplanes as well as individual troops
equipped with positioning handsets.

IMPROVED THRUST-TO-WEIGHT RATIOS AMONG BIGGEST CHALLENGES FOR
REUSABLE ROCKETS

     Need to improve thrust-to-weight (F/W) ratios of rocket
engines 30% or more (to 75) for reusable launch vehicles (RLVs)
"presents developers with a difficult challenge," National Research
Council (NRC) told NASA in report on agency's 3-phase program to
develop RLVs.  Launch costs for commercial satellites and other
payloads could be significantly reduced with RLVs.  Another big
challenge for RLV developers, NRC said, is producing vehicle from
materials that will allow 90% of rocket's mass at launch to be
fuel.  Moreover, it said, "achieving orbit with the required
payload is only part of the challenge that has been undertaken by
the NASA/industry RLV program.  The other, equally important,
challenge is to demonstrate a system that is capable of achieving
a lower cost per launch and be clearly competitive with other
launchers worldwide."  To do that, report said, newly developed
engines, primary vehicle structures, thermal protection systems and
cryogenic tanks must be demonstrated to be "reusable with minimal
inspections or replacements for at least 20 missions and have a
lifetime of at least 100 missions."

     Current reusable engines including Space Shuttle Main Engine
(SSME) and Russian RD-120 don't generate sufficient F/W ratios for
RLVs, NRC said, so participants in program will have to increase
performance of those engines or develop new ones.  "Developments to
achieve this [30%-plus] increase have been identified by
contractors;  however, the committee believes that achieving
greater than 75 F/W will be very difficult, even with a totally new
engine.  Upgrading an existing engine to meet this challenge,
although less costly than developing a new engine, will be even
more difficult," report said.

     As for primary vehicle structure, NRC panel said it's
"concerned about the low, 15 percent maximum weight-growth margin
being applied this early in the development phase of a new design
using materials of moderate maturity."  It said 20 to 25% weight
growth is typical in early stage of design development.  "The need
to control weight growth tightly this early in the program places
a premium on accurate calculation of structural performance and
weight and on early verification that the structure can be built at
or below predicted weight," study said.  Otherwise, it said,
approach to develop structures undertaken by industry proponents --
Lockheed Martin, McDonnell Douglas and Boeing, and Rockwell -- is
"sound."

     Requirement for thermal protection system (TPS) that's as
effective as space shuttle's but has capability of withstanding
impact of space debris, is waterproof and can be removed (shuttle's
is glued in place) also was addressed.  "There are questions about
the resistance of tiles (refractory or metallic) to particle impact
at liftoff and landing and especially while in orbit at space
station altitude, where some predictions are that penetration of a
tank may occur at least once in a 100-mission cycle."  Level of
rain that safely can penetrate TPS also needs to be determined, it
said:  "It is clear that both the shuttle-improved and metallic
TPSs have significant higher resistance [to water], but neither has
been totally quantified across the operational map."  Waterproofing
issues "must be resolved," it said, because "the time and manpower
required to apply waterproofing after each shuttle flight do not
meet the requirements for the turnaround times required for an
RLV."

     NRC said development program for cryogenic tanks is "robust"
because multiple approaches are being developed.  It said 2
aluminum-lithium alloys (Reynolds alloy 2195 and Russian alloy
1460) are being examined as well as 3 fabrication techniques
(machining to net-shape extrusion, net-shape spin forming, net-roll
forging) and 2 welding techniques (standard and friction-stir).  It
said Russian alloy is 25% above specifications but needs to be
tested because it's new.  Reynolds alloy "exhibits better cryogenic
ductility" and strength than previously used materials but is
difficult to produce consistently.  Friction-stir welding technique
"seems to be a promising solution to the problem of welding
aluminum-lithium alloys," report said, but needs to be tested more,
especially on thin sheets such as those to be used for liquid
oxygen tanks.

     NASA and industry have adopted "reasonable approaches to
advance the state of the art in both space materials and
propulsion" in first phase of program, NRC said.  Phase II, which
entails construction of subscale flight model, is set to begin at
end of 1996.  NRC said that before then, other important issues
need to be addressed, including:  (1) Various aspects of propulsion
system such as plumbing, leak sensors, valves, purge systems, etc. 
(2) Integrated health monitoring system for all components and new
technologies.  (3) Ground support equipment for propulsion system. 
(4) Launch and landing sites, which it said require "considerable
more attention because of technical constraints imposed by various
orbits."

     Matra Marconi Space will manufacture 3 of its Eurostar

     Matra Marconi Space will manufacture 3 of its Eurostar
platform satellites for WorldSpace under agreement with prime
contractor Alcatel Espace.  First satellite, AfriStar 1, is
licensed by FCC and will provide services to "new generation of
personal, portable receivers" for users in Africa and Middle East
after launch in mid-1998, Alcatel said.  At 6-month intervals,
AsiaStar 1, licensed by Australia, will be launched to provide
similar services to Asia;  CaribStar 1, licensed by Trinidad and
Tobago, will serve Latin America and Caribbean.  WorldSpace
spokesman said Alcatel, which as prime contractor will build
payloads and select rockets, hasn't selected launch provider. 
System will cost $650 million to build and deploy, spokesman said. 
Money is from private sources, and Morgan Stanley served as
financial adviser, he said.  Meanwhile, Matra awarded Alcatel
contract to manufacture payload for Nilesat, owned by Egyptian
Radio & TV Union.

     Russian-built 4-stage Molniya rocket last week launched Indian

     Russian-built 4-stage Molniya rocket last week launched Indian
remote sensing satellite IRS-1C from Baikonur.  Also on booster is
566-lb. research subsatellite called Skipper.  Russia's Glavkosmos
commercial space company reportedly charged $16 million for launch. 
Russian-built IRS-1C, valued at $14 million, will spend 6 months
studying India's natural resources using 3 on-board high-resolution
cameras.  Indian Space Research Organization said all instruments
were functioning as expected Dec. 29, and satellite is scheduled to
begin experiments within 3 weeks.  U.S.-based Eosat, which
processes and markets remote sensing data to govt. and commercial
industry, will have access to information from that bird and 10
other Indian satellites to be launched over next 10 years. 
Skipper, jointly built by Utah State U. and Moscow Aviation
Institute, cost $2.4 million.  Launch brought to 8 number of
foreign satellites launched by Russia in 1995.  Country plans 10
such launches this year.

     Group of 4 Chinese organizations and 2 Singapore companies

     Group of 4 Chinese organizations and 2 Singapore companies
announced plans to create regional mobile satellite system called
Asia Pacific Mobile Telecommunications (APMT).  Backers of
$640-million project include China Satellite Launch & Tracking
Control, China Aerospace Corp., China Unicom, China
Telecommunications Bcst. Satellite, Singapore Telecom, Singapore
Technologies Telemedia.  APMT has requested proposals for 2
satellites and ground facilities.  First launch is planned for 1998
on Long March.  System will compete against Aces project backed by
consortium of Indonesian, Thai and Philippine companies and
AfroAsia system backed by Indian concerns.  Aces has contract for
Lockheed Martin satellite, AfroAsia will deploy Hughes bird. 
Singapore Telecom withdrew from Aces project but still is part
owner, along with Hughes and others, of American Mobile Satellite. 
However, that doesn't necessarily mean Hughes has edge in
competition to get contract for APMT satellite, analyst Tim Logue
of Reid & Preist said.  "Hughes doesn't have a sweetheart deal," he
said.  Entry of 3rd regional MSS provider in Asia raises questions
about whether market will support that many systems.  Logue said: 
"It's remarkable that 3 geostationary satellite-based systems are
planned for launch by the end of the century for Asia.  There may
be market enough for all to prosper, but the question is -- what
market share does that leave for the Big LEOs?"  He said Big LEOs
have significant investment from region, which will host 6-way
fight for MSS business, "but it's a big continent."

     Trimble last week said it was "furious" over filing of
securities class action lawsuit against company on eve of expected
passage of Securities Litigation Reform Act designed to limit
frivolous suits against companies whose stocks experience wide
swing in value.  Suit was filed by attorney William Lerach of
Milberg, Weiss law firm, San Diego, who Trimble Pres. Charles
Trimble said has claimed "constituency" of shareholders, but "in
fact... only needs to find one disgruntled shareholder in order to
claim broad representation..."  Trimble charged lawsuit, one of
more than dozen filed against high-tech companies since Dec. 1, was
result of "clever niche market" that will "drain the energy out of
the entrepreneurial process."

     Launch of NASA's X-Ray Timing Explorer (XTE) satellite on
Delta 2 was scheduled for after our deadline Dec. 30 after mission
was delayed yet again Dec. 29 by unfavorable upper level wind
conditions.  Launch had been postponed several times since planned
Dec. 4 flight because of bad weather and problems with Delta 2 main
engine valves, which NASA and rocket builder McDonnell Douglas said
have been corrected (SW Dec 25 p4).  Satellite is carrying 3
experiments -- from Goddard Space Flight Center, MIT and U. of
Cal.-San Diego -- to study X-ray-emitting objects in far reaches of
space.
