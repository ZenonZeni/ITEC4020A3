<hr>
<h4 align=left><font color="#FF0000">What is Effexor?</font></h4>
<p align=left><font color="#000000">Effexor (generic: venlafaxine) is one of the newer medications available to treat depression. Structurally 
different from other antidepressants, it affects two neurotransmitters (chemical messengers to the brain) involved 
in depression: serotonin and norepinephrine. Approved for use in the United States at the end of 1993, its novel 
chemical action and low incidence of side effects make it a significant addition to the range of medications used 
to treat depression. </font></p>
<h4 align=left><font color="#FF0000">How is Effexor different from other antidepressants?</font></h4>
<p align=left><font color="#000000">Effexor is a chemically unique antidepressant medication. Like the newer class of antidepressants known as 
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), such as fluoxetine (Prozac) and setraline (Zoloft), it affects the 
absorption of serotonin. In addition, Effexor acts on the norepinephrine system. No other available medication 
affects both neurotransmitters without causing the side effects of the older tricyclic antidepressants. </font></p>
<h4 align=left><font color="#FF0000">Are there other advantages of Effexor?</font></h4>
<p align=left><font color="#000000">Effexor is less likely to induce seizures, to have toxic effects on the heart, and to cause lethal reactions. </font></p>
<h4 align=left><font color="#FF0000">For what kind of patient would Effexor be appropriate?</font></h4>
<p align=left><font color="#000000">Effexor is recognized as a front line option (that is, first time medication for patients who have recently become 
ill with depression, whether they are hospitalized or treated on an outpatient basis. It can also be useful for 
patients who have had long-standing depressive illness and have not responded adequately to previous 
treatments. Almost 40 percent of so-called refractory patients (those who have not had positive results from past 
treatment) have had success with Effexor. Patients who have benefited from other antidepressants but have had 
less than complete success may want to discuss switching to Effexor with their doctors. </font></p>
<h4 align=left><font color="#FF0000">What about side effects? </font></h4>
<p align=left><font color="#000000">Relatively few side effects have been reported with Effexor. Those that have been noted are dose-related; that is, 
side effects increase as the dose increases. Very few patients have had to discontinue the medication because of 
side effects.</font></p>
<p align=left><font color="#000000">The most common minor side effects during clinical trials include short-term nausea (which can be reduced by 
taking the medication with food), sleepiness, dry mouth, dizziness, constipation, nervousness, sweating, 
weakness, ejaculation/orgasm problems, and loss of appetite.</font></p>
<p align=left><font color="#000000">A small percentage (about five percent) of patients, usually those taking higher doses, will develop elevated 
blood pressure. Therefore, patients taking Effexor should have their blood pressure checked regularly. Some 
agitation has been noticed at higher dosages. </font></p>
<h4 align=left><font color="#FF0000">How long does it take to work?</font></h4>
<p align=left><font color="#000000">Like most other medications used for depression, Effexor may take several weeks before it is fully effective. It is 
important to five the medication sufficient time before judging whether it will work for a given person. There is 
evidence, however, that Effexor may take effect more quickly than other antidepressants. </font></p>
<h4 align=left><font color="#FF0000">Can Effexor be taken with other medications?</font></h4>
<p align=left><font color="#000000">Effexor does not interact significantly with many other medications, including lithium, diazepam (Valium), and 
cimetidine (Tagamet, an anti-ulcer medication). However, patients taking cimetidine who have high blood 
pressure or liver disease or are elderly should use caution in taking Effexor because the interaction can be more 
pronounced when these disorders are present.</font></p>
<p align=left><font color="#000000">Effexor definitely should not be taken at the same time as the MAOIs (such as Parnate or Nardil). Interactions 
with these compounds could be lethal. Patients who have been taking an MAOI and are switching to Effexor must 
allow sufficient time (usually 14 days) for the MAOI to clear out of the body. The same time should be allowed 
if changing from Effexor to an MAOI. However, switching from Effexor to other medications is easy because 
Effexor is quickly removed from the body. </font></p>
<h4 align=left><font color="#FF0000">What is the standard dose?</font></h4>
<p align=left><font color="#000000">The dose range is generally between 75 and 375 mg per day. The average effective dose is about 125 to 150 mg 
per day. Higher doses are necessary for sicker patients. It is recommended that the total dose be divided into two 
or three doses per day and taken with food. Dosage adjustments for elderly people are not usually necessary. </font></p>
<h4 align=left><font color="#FF0000">Will Effexor work for everyone?</font></h4>
<p align=left><font color="#000000">No. Everyone responds to medications differently. Effexor will work well for some people, and not so well for 
others. It is important to give the medication a trial of several weeks and to be in close communication with your 
doctor about signs of effectiveness, side effects, and personal factors affecting one's response to the medication. </font></p>
