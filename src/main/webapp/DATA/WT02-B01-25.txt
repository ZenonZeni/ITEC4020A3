<h1>Bumper Sticker Ideas </h1>

<p> This page is a compilation of ideas people had for good
bumper stickers for a drug policy reform campaign. Enjoy. </p>

<p> <img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="BOTTOM"> </p>

<p> &quot;Visualize Drugpeace,&quot; </p>

<p> &quot;It's the Prohibition -- Not Drugs,&quot; </p>

<p> &quot;Stop the War on Us,&quot; </p>

<p> Prohibition love it or leave it. </p>

<p> Peace on Drugs. </p>

<p> CIA Cocaine in America. </p>

<p> DEA: the competition </p>

<p> Make love on drugs, </p>

<p> Not war on drugs </p>

<p> Fight real crime- </p>

<p> End the drug war. </p>

<p> - Ben Masel (I think) </p>

<p> Just say know </p>

<p> (or no thank you) </p>

<p> Why can't we all just get abong? </p>

<p> As Ira Glassner noted in his editorial printed in last
sundays NY times </p>

<p> --in response to &quot;It's Drugs Stupid&quot;---Hey,
&quot;It's Prohibition Stupid.&quot; </p>

<p> Legalize it, Don't Criticize it. </p>

<p> Drug Prohibition is the Problem Not the Solution </p>

<p> I read once that if you take a black sharpie and black-out
the &quot;kids off&quot; </p>

<p> on the DARE bumper stickers, it reads, </p>

<p> &quot;DARE to keep drugs&quot; </p>

<p> Pro-MJ and I vote! </p>

<p> Free the weed, the stalk and the seed! </p>

<p> Free Pot (from tyranny) </p>

<p> Drugs Are Real Expensive </p>

<p> &quot;Stop the Violence: End the Drug War&quot; </p>

<p> PROHIBITION = &lt;the word &quot;CONTROL&quot; surrounded by
a big slashed circle&gt; </p>

<p> REGULATION = CONTROL </p>

<p> How about &quot;DECLARE PEACE&quot; superimposed over the
image of a </p>

<p> pot leaf on one side and a hand with the V-shaped peace sign </p>

<p> on the other? </p>

<p> Stop drug violence </p>

<p> End the drug war </p>

<p> [Perhaps using red/white octagon STOP sign and yellow/black
diamond END sign] </p>

<p> DARE: Lying to </p>

<p> kids about drugs </p>

<p> [Lying to kids has to be in high contrast, bright yellow on
black] </p>

<p> Save the trees </p>

<p> Legalize hemp </p>

<p> Prohibition _is_ our drug problem </p>

<p> &quot;It's Prohibition, Stupid&quot; - (inspired by E.
Nadelmann) </p>

<p> Tax it. </p>

<p> For Freedom of Diet -- Abolish Neo-prohibition! </p>

<p> End the Drug War. </p>

<p> Begin the War on Real Crime </p>

<p> THE DRUG WAR BREEDS CRIME </p>

<p> NOBODY'S SAFE FROM THE DEA </p>

<p> WANT SAFE STREETS? END THE DRUG WAR! </p>

<p> MAKE AMERICA SAFE: END THE DRUG WAR! </p>

<p> OUR DRUG WAR: $100,000,000,000.00 DRUG LORD SUBSIDY </p>

<p> PROHIBITION IS A FAILURE </p>

<p> &quot;WAR ON DRUGS&quot; = WAR ON AMERICA </p>

<p> LAND OF THE PRISONER HOME OF THE DRUG WAR </p>

<p> (as in &quot;land of the free, home of the brave&quot;.
Superimposed on a </p>

<p> waving American flag. In fact it would be really cool if
&quot;free&quot; </p>

<p> and &quot;brave&quot; were printed but scribbled out and
&quot;prisoner&quot; and </p>

<p> &quot;drug war&quot; were written in.) </p>

<p> US OUT OF COLOMBIA - DEA OUT OF MENDOCINO </p>

<p> ...Fight Crime, Not Drugs... </p>

<p> ....End Drug Prohibition -- Before It's Too Late... </p>

<p> How about: School free drug zone. </p>

<p> &gt;Prohibition: Didn't work Then </p>

<p> &gt;Of Drugs Doesn't Work Now! </p>

<p> &gt;Freedom still works better - Abolish Prohibition </p>

<p> DEA OUT OF L.A. </p>

<p> Save Our Children -- Stop the Drug War, or </p>

<p> Save our Community -- Stop the Drug War <br>
