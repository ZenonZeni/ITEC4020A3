<TITLE>Research findings - Physician assisted suicide</title>

<head><h2>Research findings - Physician assisted suicide</h2></head>
<br><br>
In a survey published 23rd May, the first of its kind in Britain, it is revealed that a majority of doctors in Britain believe they should be allowed to help suffering patients to end their lives.
<br><br>
Professor Sheila McLean, who is Professor of Law & Ethics in Medicine at Glasgow University, has conducted Britain's first ever research into the issue, the aim of which, she says, is to draft a bill which would legalise physician-assisted suicide. The controversial step would require the support of the medical profession. Her survey results indicate that she has the majority of the medical profession on her side.
<br><br>
Under the law in Britain at the moment, prescribing lethal drugs to help someone to die can be punished as culpable homicide in Scotland or as assted suicide/manslaughter in England.
<br><br>
54% of the doctors who responded to the confidential questionnaire said they would support a change in the law that would allow them to help patients to die. 16% said they would help in terminal cases, 11% in cases of physical suffering, and 7% simply if the patient wished it. A considerable proportion said they been asked by a patient to assist in suicide, and 3% admitted that they had in the past helped patients to die, and privately  the figure is thought to be higher.

The Scottish Voluntary Euthanasia Society commented:<br><br>
This ground-breaking research is most encouraging - it seems to confirm what we suspected, that a majority of doctors are caring people who want to respect their patients' wishes - even when doing so would mean prescribing drugs that would enable a suffering patient to choose quality over quantity of life. Until now, patients have not had the support of the medical profession or the law when taking these difficult decisions - this is one of the reasons why the Scottish Voluntary Euthanasia Society issues, under certain conditions, literature on "self-deliverance." We hope now that parliament will recognise the wishes of the public, the medical profession, and the humaneness of allowing death with dignity at a time of a patient's own choosing. We know there will be problems with any such legislation, but such problems are not insurmoutable - by doing nothing we would simply allow a heartless sentence to run its course for individuals whose indignity and suffering cannot be relieved - people deserve the key to the door marked "Exit" if that is what they want.

VESS made a grant of £42,000 available to Glasgow University to perform the research.
