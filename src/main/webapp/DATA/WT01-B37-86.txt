<h2>Chapter One: Addiction Rates And Drug Legalization </h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>

<p><b>DISCUSSION</b> </p>

<p><b>I. Their Argument</b> </p>

<p>Proponents of drug legalization argue that legalizing drugs
would decrease addiction rates for two reasons. First, they
maintain, people use drugs <i>because </i>they are illegal - that
is, people get a thrill breaking a social taboo. Legalize drugs
and the incentive to take them will go away. Second, proponents
of legalization argue that if drugs were legalized, we could
spend the money that we presently spend on the criminal justice
system on treatment of addicts.2 </p>

<p><b>II. Our Argument</b> </p>

<p>Before addressing the particular merits of the legalization
debate, it is useful to describe just what is an addiction.
Addictions are either physical or psychological. Physical
addiction occurs when the body becomes dependent upon chemicals
or drugs not normally found in the human body and requires such
chemicals in order to sustain basic bodily functions. Take, for
instance, cocaine addiction. Cocaine alters the means by which
brain cells communicate with one another. Usually, nerve cells
(neurons) send signals to one another through chemical
neurotransmitters such as dopamine. Dopamine flows from one
neuron to the other, delivers its message, and returns to the
original neuron. Cocaine, however, blocks the dopamine from
returning to the first cell, and the first cell just keeps firing
away. This explains why cocaine produces such feelings of
pleasure; for lack of a better description, cocaine locks all of
the user's neurons into an &quot;On&quot; position. The problem
occurs when all of the cocaine has been metabolized by the body.
As Professor James Q. Wilson explains, &quot;[w]hen the
exaggerated high produced by cocaine-influenced dopamine finally
ends, the brain cells may (in ways that are still a matter of
dispute) suffer from an extreme lack of dopamine, thereby making
the individual unable to experience any pleasure at all.&quot;3
This is a very simplified model, of course, and different drugs
affect the body in different ways, but a simple fact remains -
physical addiction is biochemical in nature and is independent of
social, political, or psychological causes. </p>

<p>There is another type of addiction, however, that being
psychological addiction. Unlike physical addiction, which
basically is a medical condition, psychological addiction occurs
when the individual user feels or is of the opinion that drugs
are necessary for his or her life. This is not to suggest that
psychological addiction is easily dismissed; indeed it can have a
profound influence on how addicts live their lives. Such
especially is the case when addicts live in a culture that
continually reinforces the desirability or necessity of drug use.
</p>

<p>Let us examine addiction specific to two drugs: cocaine and
marijuana. Although rough, estimates suggest that there are
between 650,000 and 2.4 million cocaine addicts in the United
States.4 &quot;Cocaine is a much more addictive drug than
alcohol. If cocaine were legally available the number of cocaine
abusers would probably rise to...perhaps 20-25million.&quot;5
Mitchell Rosenthal, President of the Phoenix House
drug-rehabilitation program states that cheap available drugs
would increase addiction; only 10% of drinkers become hooked,
while an estimated 75% of regular drug (crack) users could become
addicts.6 Scientific studies agree, noting that when given
unlimited access to cocaine, laboratory animals will consume
increasingly greater amounts until they die.7 That cocaine is
harmful to one's health likely will come as a surprise to no one.
Dr. Frank H. Gawin, director of stimulant abuse, treatment and
research at Yale University concludes that cocaine causes
depression, paranoia, and &quot;violent psychotic
behavior.&quot;8 What is worse, there is presently no effective,
permanent treatment for cocaine addiction.9 </p>

<p>Almost everyone would agree that cocaine is a dangerous,
addictive drug, but many would be surprised to find that the same
is true of marijuana. Although it is very difficult to determine
the precise number of marijuana users and addicts in the United
States, one fact is clear: marijuana has become much more potent
over the last twenty years. Cannabis delta 9
tetrahydrocannabinol, commonly known as &quot;THC,&quot; is the
active ingredient in marijuana and other cannabis such as
hashish. The THC content in marijuana during the days of
Woodstock was something less than 1%. In 1974, the average THC
content of illicit marijuana was 0. 36% and by 1984 had increased
to 4.40%.10 In 1992 in Alaska, marijuana was discovered that<b> </b>had
a THC content of 29.86%.11 Now stop and think about that for a
minute. Today's marijuana may be between thirty to sixty times as
potent as were the joints of the 1960's. </p>

<p>This observation gives one pause when we realize that THC is
both dangerous and habit-forming. Marinol, a prescription drug
that is very occasionally used in the treatment of nausea
associated with chemotherapy, is chemically synthesized THC. Most
people are familiar with the information sheets that come with
prescription drugs - the pieces of paper that detail the
indications and usage of the drug in question, its potential
side-effects, its chemical composition, etc. The information
sheet that comes with Marinol states verbatim, &quot;MARINOL is
highly abusable and can produce both physical and psychological
dependence .... Patients receiving MARINOL should be closely
observed.&quot;12 The company that produces Marinol goes on to
explain that its THC may cause &quot;changes in mood ...
decrements in cognitive performance and memory, a decreased
ability to control drives and impulses [and] . . . a full-blown
picture of psychosis (psychotic organic brain syndrome) may occur
in patients receiving doses within the lower portion of the
therapeutic range.&quot;13 </p>

<p>Such warnings should not surprise the scientists who have for
many years maintained that the THC contained in marijuana is
dangerous. First, in the late 1960's Dr. Robert Heath, then
chairman of the Department of Psychiatry and Neurology at Tulane
Medical School, found that marijuana affects brain waves and
destroys brain cells.14 Second, a study conducted by Dr. Ethel
Sassenrath at the University of California at Davis between 1974
and 1978 found that THC increased the rate of fetal loss (in
utero, fetal death) in monkeys by over 300%, while at the same
time decreasing the birth weights in those babies born alive.15
Third, a study by Dr. Susan Dalterio, at the University of Texas
found that marijuana decreased testosterone and impaired sexual
development in male mice.16 Finally, a study by Dr. Albert Munson
found that injections of THC suppressed the immune systems of
mice and made them 96 times more susceptible to the herpes
virus.17 </p>

<p>Dr. Charles R. Schuster, former Director of the National
Institute on Drug Abuse said, &quot;The fact that there are over
77,000 admissions a year to treatment programs for marijuana use
and that annually almost 8,000 persons require emergency hospital
care for marijuana use is sufficient evidence of the drugs
dangerousness&quot;18 </p>

<p>Clearly, drugs such as cocaine and marijuana are, both
addictive and dangerous. The legalizers likely would admit this,
but counter by saying that if we legalized them we would have
less of a problem. This is untrue. </p>

<p>Recall from above that legalizers claim that people use and
become addicted to drugs because of the excitement of breaking
the law - it is the fact that drugs are illegal that causes
people to try them. The data disagree. Robert E. Peterson, Former
Deputy Attorney General of Pennsylvania notes, &quot;70% of high
school students in New Jersey and about 60% of the students in
California said that fear of getting in trouble with the law
constituted a major reason <u>not</u> to use drugs.&quot;19 </p>

<p>The legalizers' argument that we should legalize drugs and
spend the money we now spend on criminal prosecution on treatment
and rehabilitation also fails. Both proponents and opponents of
legalization are in agreement that legalization almost certainly
would decrease the price of drugs as they became more available.
However, basic economic theory states that as the price of a
commodity declines, demand for the commodity will increase. But
whereas the reverse usually also is true (increase price and
demand decreases), it is not so with addictive substances. That
is, drop the price of a gram of cocaine by 50%, and you will see
an increase in use as demand for the product increases. Increase
the price of cocaine by 50%, and you will <i>not </i>see an equal
decrease in demand because addicts will pay the price to sustain
their addictions. In technical economic terms, the demand for
addictive drugs is elastic with respect to price declines, but
inelastic with respect to price increases. </p>

<p>Expert opinion supports this hypothesis. Dr. Herbert D. Kleber
of the Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse, Columbia
University, suggests that legalization of cocaine would result in
a five- to six-fold increase in cocaine use.20 Dr. Robert DuPont,
former director of the National Institute of Drug Abuse agrees,
stating that legalization would increase the number of users of
cocaine and marijuana to between fifty and sixty million, and the
number of heroin users to around ten million.21 Dr. DuPont
concludes that when one takes into account the health effects of
cocaine, heroin, and marijuana, legalization could result in
between 100,000 and 500,000 drug induced deaths each year.22
Further, you cannot legalize cocaine and control the crack
epidemic, for users could easily turn the former into the latter.
</p>

<p>History also supports the fact that legalization would
increase addiction rates. When opium was legal in the United
States at the turn of the century, we had proportionately between
two and three times the number of addicts than we do presently.23
Furthermore, Dr. Richard Schwartz, Professor of Pediatrics at
Georgetown University School of Medicine, notes that Alaska and
Oregon, the states that traditionally have had the most lenient
drug laws, also have the highest marijuana addiction rates in the
United States double the national average.24 </p>

<p>Finally, foreign countries that have relaxed drug laws have
seen an increase in addiction rates [see Chapter Three]. </p>

<p>In short, cocaine, heroin, and marijuana are dangerous and
highly addictive substances. Scholarly opinion, historical
evidence, and common sense suggest that if these drugs are
legalized, then the rates of addiction will skyrocket, leading to
misery and death. </p>

<p>2 See Chapters Two and Four for additional discussion of
whether legalizing drugs would indeed allow us to shift resources
from criminal prosecution to treatment and rehabilitation. </p>
