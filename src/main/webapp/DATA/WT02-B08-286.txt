<p>
<h3>
Maps of sea surface anomaly - also known as sea surface variability - are used to study changes in the ocean over months or seasons. 
<p>
These changes in sea height depend on factors such as relatively short-term variations in ocean currents often caused by eddies, and seasonal changes in the temperature of the upper ocean layer.
<p>
Sea surface anomaly signals are usually less than 12 centimeters, about one-sixteenth of the overall variation in sea surface height caused by ocean circulation.</H3></TD></TR></TABLE> 
<p>
<h3>
Access the <a href=http://www-ccar.Colorado.EDU/~leben/real-time/>"Global Near Real-Time Altimeter Data Viewer"</a> for an interactive software program that allows you to create maps of sea surface height anomaly. This processing is designed to retain the sea surface height signatures associated with ocean fronts and eddies. 
<p> 
The maps are produced from TOPEX and ERS-2 altimeter data processed in near real-time, usually within 24 to 36 hours of overflight. A map is produced every <i>three days,</i> based on the latest 10 days of TOPEX and/or 35 days of ERS-2 sampling data, if available.
