<BIG><STRONG>FBI Demands for Broad New Surveillance Power Rejected on Privacy Grounds</STRONG></BIG> <FONT SIZE=-1>[Posted on 9/20/96]</FONT> <P>

A telecommunications industry standards body on Thursday voted to reject a demand by the FBI to create a national tracking system out of the wireless telephone network.  CDT applauds this decision as a significant victory for privacy and condemns the FBI's blatant efforts to subvert the specific requirements of the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA).
 <P>
&quot;The FBI is demanding that every cell phone double as a tracking device, providing instant and continuous location information not just when a subject is talking but whenever a cellular phone is turned on.&quot; said CDT Executive Director Jerry Berman. &quot;The FBI is demanding real-time tracking of anyone suspected of committing a crime.  This is a clear violation of the statute and the Fourth Amendment,&quot; Berman added.

<BIG><STRONG>Clinton Administration, Congress Propose Sweeping Anti-Terrorism Initiatives</STRONG></BIG> <FONT SIZE=-1>[Posted on 8/1/96]</FONT> <P>

In the wake of the recent bombing at the Olympics and the suspected
terrorist involvement in the TWA crash, the Clinton Administration and
members of Congress are proposing a set of sweeping counter-terrorism
initiatives. If enacted into law, these proposals will dramatically
increase law enforcement surveillance authority over the Internet and other
advanced communications technologies. <A HREF="/policy/terrorism/960729_admin_fact.html">An outline of the Administration's
proposal was circulated on Capitol Hill on Monday July 29.</A>
<P>
CDT is concerned that the latest counter-terrorism efforts on Capitol Hill
are occurring without appropriate deliberation.  Major policy decisions
expanding the surveillance powers of law enforcement should not be made
without careful consideration of the necessity of such proposals and the
relative benefit to society. In the coming days and weeks, CDT will work
with Congressional leaders, privacy advocates, and the net.community to
ensure that constitutional civil liberties and the openness of the Internet
are protected as Congress considers counter-terrorism measures.
