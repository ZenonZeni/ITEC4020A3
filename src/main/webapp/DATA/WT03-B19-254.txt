Financial services
</H1>

The floating of the Australian currency in 1983, the abolition of exchange 
controls, the entry of foreign banks, and changes in the stockbroking industry 
have resulted in a marked increase in activities in Australia's financial 
services sector and greater interaction with overseas markets.
<P>
Melbourne has been an active participant in this growth. The range, quality and 
sophistication of its financial services match those found in other 
international centres.
<P>
Two of Australia's top four retail banks are headquartered in Melbourne, and 
Melbourne-based banks account for about 33% of national saving and trading 
operations. Altogether, 16 Australian and 18 foreign-owned banks operate in 
Melbourne, offering the full range of retail and trading services including 
commercial loans and leasing, corporate and property finance, money market and 
foreign exchange services.
<P>
In addition, many non-bank financial intermediaries operate in Victoria, 
including seven Victorian building societies and an increasing number of 
major interstate societies which have recently been authorised to establish 
their operations in Victoria. A wide range of finance brokers, consultants, 
together with confirming, factoring and trade financiers and money market 
dealers also successfully conduct businesses based in Victoria.
<P>
Futures markets in currencies and traded commodities are available through a 
network of specialist brokers.
<P>
Specialist sources of investment finance include the Rural Finance Corporation 
of Victoria, which provides financial and other services to encourage 
development of the State's rural industries, and the Commonwealth-owned 
Australian Industry Development Corporation (AIDC), which has a mandate to 
promote Australian industry. The AIDC operates on commercial lines - making 
loans, equity investment and offering detailed financial advisory services.
<P>
<B><I>Australian Stock Exchange - Melbourne</B></I>
<P>
The Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) operates a national sharemarket linked 
through an automated trading system known as the Stock Exchange Automated 
Trading System (SEATS). Together with an automated settlement system known as 
CHESS, the Australian sharemarket is one of the most efficient in the world.
<P>
Melbourne stockbrokers account for more than half of all capital raisings on 
the ASX. Three of Australia's five leading brokers are based in Melbourne.
