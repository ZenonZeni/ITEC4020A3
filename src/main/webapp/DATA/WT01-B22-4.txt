<h1>STATEMENT OF DR. B. B. ROBINSON<br>
</h1>

<p><b>BUREAU OF PLANT INDUSTRY DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE.</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>DR. ROBINSON: If fibres produced from plants were ranked in <br>
accordance with their world production in tonnage, hemp would
occupy a <br>
position of probably third or fourth. It would be surpassed by
cotton and <br>
jute produced in India, and in some years by flax. That gives you
some idea <br>
of where it stands in relative importance.<br>
Dr. Wright mentioned a matter that many of you are familiar with,
the <br>
fact of the importance that hemp played in our earlier Colonial
days <br>
before the introduction of the cotton gin.<br>
The culture of hemp in the United States, I might say has
decreased <br>
because of the cheap competitive fibres which are produced by
cheap labor <br>
in foreign countries, and it is because of this cheapness that
they are <br>
substituted for hemp in many cases, and not because of the fact
that they <br>
have characteristics that are better than hemp for cordage or
textile <br>
purposes.<br>
The average world production between the years 1930 and 1954 for <br>
hemp was about 750,000 tons. And now, during that same period in
the <br>
United States in this small industry we have produced about 500
tons. The <br>
world production was produced mainly by Russia where I think 56%
of the <br>
fibre is produced, followed by Italy, Yugoslavia, Rumania as
other <br>
producing countries, During the past year or two we imported for
domestic <br>
consumption about 700 to 800 tons a year, so our total
consumption, <br>
including domestically produced fibre, and imported fibre runs
about from <br>
1500 to 2000 tons.<br>
Now, many of you here may wonder why such a small industry as
that <br>
should be favored to continue on, particularly in the light of
the <br>
detrimental character of certain parts of the plant used
illegally. <br>
In the first place the United States is dependent upon the
foreign production of fibres other than cotton. The United States
<br>
imports annually about 300,000 tons of fibre used for cordage and
textile <br>
purposes. The estimated value last year was about $35,000,000.
That does <br>
not include some importations of India twine.<br>
I do not mean to infer that if hemp were grown in this country,
it <br>
could substitute for all of this 300,000 tons imported, but it is
the <br>
principal fibre which we can get in the United atates, which
could be <br>
substituted in many cases if conditions arose to make it
necessary. <br>
The United States, is very thoroughly taken care of at present in
<br>
reference to supplying our own needs on this cordage fibre.<br>
Another argument for the hemp industry is the adaptability of the
<br>
hemp plant to various regions of the country and because of
suitability for <br>
mechanical handling, and these are some of the reasons why the
office <br>
with which I am connected in the Department of Agriculture is
interested <br>
in seeing this small nucleus of hemp industry continued each year
until it <br>
is capable of supporting itself under economic conditions. I am
speaking <br>
more of the industry in Wisconsin rather than the promotional
attempts to <br>
grow hemp in Minnesota which one might speak of an unorthodox <br>
processing. But this industry we have is capable at the present
time of supporting itself if public opinion does not force it to
be <br>
shut doan, or additional restrictions hamper it.<br>
So, this industry could be benefited we naturally think, if this <br>
Marihuana stigma could be removed. However, the Wisconsin
operators are <br>
not opposed to adjust themselves to the conditions and are very
much <br>
interested in trying to overcome this drug problem.<br>
A couple of years ago when this problem was brought to the front <br>
more vividly than in the past, the Department of Agriculture was
naturally <br>
interested in it, and the main way we could see to combat it was
as to <br>
how to get around it [sic]. Naturally there might be less
restriction on the <br>
production of hemp in this country if we could prove that in
certain <br>
sections of the country, because of climatic conditions, the drug
was not <br>
active, or if we could possibly get plants of varieties that lack
the drug, <br>
which is probably an Utopian view, or that had it in low
concentration. <br>
As a result we cooperated with the Bureau of Narcotics, in
setting <br>
up some experiments. The Bureau of Narcotics has conducted all of
the <br>
chemical work, and Dr. Marchett later on will speak of these
tests. I do not <br>
want to go too much into his field. But, we have attempted under
this cooperative work to remove or reduce the resinous substance
from <br>
commercial hemp.<br>
You gentlemen who are chemists and pharmacologists can assist the
<br>
Agricultural program by furnishing the Agriculture Department
some <br>
working tools or some tests by which we can tell the presence or
absence <br>
of this drug, or its activity. It may be said that I am throwing
it all on the <br>
chemists. I am not trying to do that, but we do need something to
work <br>
with.<br>
So far we naturally have resorted to the Beam tests, the <br>
significance of which we do not know with certainty, but in the
work we <br>
undertook last year, it was the only simple tool which we could
work <br>
with.<br>
Now last summer out at Arlington farm close by, we planted a
field <br>
in which there were 98 small plots of hemp that were set up in <br>
conformity with the statistical method of analysis of variances
by a man <br>
named Fisher.<br>
We obtained statistically significant differences between the <br>
varieties using the alkaline but did not obtain it using the acid
test. The <br>
question may arise, then, as to which is the most accurate of the
tests in <br>
measuring the presence or absence of the drug.<br>
In reference to that, the question of the region of the hemp may
play <br>
some importance. The native home of hemp is supposedly in central
Asia, Ñand the hemp of Chinese origin which <br>
has been distributed throughout the world has practically always
been <br>
used for fibre purposes.<br>
The hemp that has come from India has been of the narcotic type
and <br>
has not been cultivated generally for fibre. It has been
cultivated for the <br>
drug. I wish I knew the history of this a little better, but from
what I have <br>
been able to learn from others, hemp does not appear to
constitute a <br>
narcotic problem in China. That is of a fibrous variety, and
there is a great <br>
difference between that hemp and the hemp that came from India. <br>
With reference to our test at Arlington, the narcotic chemists <br>
selected samples at three different periods for the acid and
alkaline test. <br>
We got a difference, mathematically significant between those
tests. That <br>
is, the first sampling which I think was in the early part of
June, was <br>
different from the later two samplings in that it was lower in
that <br>
characteristic of activity, the numbers they gave on the Beam
test.<br>
Actually, the last test was a little lower than the middle test,
but it <br>
was not significantly lower.<br>
We arranged 8 different fertilizer treatments for the various
plots <br>
and found that the fertilizer used had no effect on the strength
or <br>
incidence either the acid or alkaline test.<br>
Because of the fertilizer result it would appear that soil vs.
variations <br>
that occurred probably did not produce any differences or that
the soil does <br>
not play a part.<br>
With reference to climate, so far we have not made a test for we
have <br>
only had the work at Arlington. But we plan next summer, if
things go well at <br>
Arlington, to conduct a test in Wisconsin. We have some
cooperative agents in <br>
Mississippi and we thought we could get a test farm there. It has
been <br>
suggested that we try to get one other region, Arizona or New
Mexico, or out <br>
in that section. So far, we have not made arrangements, but, if
we could get <br>
these various locations in the United States, then we could have
a set-up <br>
whereby we could evolute [sic] climatic conditions in reference
to certain <br>
tests, the Beam test or some other one if you can furnish it.
These are the <br>
results which we have obtained so far in the agricultural program
to get away <br>
from this drug.<br>
There have been several reasons I have not brought out as to why
we <br>
thought we could get somewhere. We know by handling the plants
that some <br>
of them are very resinous, and some are not.<br>
So, we are receptive to the work you men will do to give us some
means <br>
of testing our plants so as to allow us to produce agriculturally
some results which we hope will help the industry.<br>
<br>
COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: Thank you very muckh Dr. Robinson. You <br>
recall what I said about the Turkish annual report for the year
1937 in <br>
which it is said that Cannabis sativa with long stalks is grown
for <br>
industrial purposes in various parts of Anatolia; that the fibre
is used for <br>
the manufacture of ropes and sacks, and its resin content is so
slight that <br>
it could not be used for the extraction of a narcotic drug. It
might be <br>
interesting to get some Turkish seed. <br>
<br>
MR. WOLLNER: We have not had a great deal of success as regards <br>
those statements. We obtained some seed submitted by Dr. Bouquet
and I <br>
believe Dr. Robinson planted some of them, without any success. <br>
<br>
DR. ROBINSON: We planted them under favorable conditions last <br>
spring. Roughly we may have gotten in the field 200 or 300
plants, and <br>
after our first Beam test it was estimated we had about 100 left.
About <br>
the first of August, I came back from a trip to the west, and we
el-<br>
iminated about two-thirds of the remainder leaving only about 40.
I have <br>
harvested about 20 of these one-half were males, and we sent 10
from <br>
that collection over to Dr. Matchett to run an alkaline Beam test
on. I was<br>
able to obtain out of that .about one-third negative and the rest
positive.<br>
<br>
MR. WOLLNER: Was the amount of resin in these plants comparable
to <br>
that in other plants?<br>
<br>
DR. ROBINSON: In harvesting these plants, we merely stripped the <br>
seed in the field to keep the birds from getting it and I would
say that the <br>
African plant was more resinous than the Manchurian plant. It may
be that <br>
the African plant was later in maturing, but still, by comparison
with the <br>
Manchurian plant, it had more resin. My hand was simply caked
with resin <br>
in stripping the plant for the seed.<br>
<br>
COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: The Indian Government report for 1934 <br>
shows that where they did not have this type of hemp all of the
resin was <br>
imported from Central Asia.<br>
It is stated that the hemp cultivated in Europe does not carry
the <br>
intoxicating properties of Indian hemp. While it is believed that
the <br>
European hemp does not contain as much resin as is to be found in
hemp <br>
usually produced in Asia, the production of the active resin is
particularly <br>
variable, and there are some times great differences in quantity
depending <br>
on the altitude of the place of cultivation.<br>
Are there any questions that you care to ask, Dr. Robinson?<br>
<br>
DR. HIBBEN: I would like to ask if you made any experiments <br>
artificially in the new varieties by radiation?<br>
<br>
DR. ROBINSON: We had a program for a number of years on hemp, and
<br>
my predecessor, Mr. Dewey, who unfortunately could not be here
this <br>
morning, reached retirement age three years ago, and our hemp
program <br>
was interrupted.<br>
So far we have not gone into that, but to some extent we have <br>
considered it. These other methods we have approached seemed to
have <br>
possibilities of results if the tests mean anything.<br>
I think this next spring, we should be able to plant these
negative <br>
seeds we have, and those which have tested negative three
different times <br>
and have been pollinated by plants in three different tests, and
we should <br>
be able to give the chemists something definite to test.<br>
<br>
DR. MUNCH: It is my recollection, when Mr. Dewey made a test of
the <br>
original plants growing in Arlington back in 1922, we found
different <br>
physiological portents in the male and the female but, at that
time, Mr. <br>
Dewey had seed he had obtained from various parts of the world,
and it is <br>
my impression that after about three years of cultivation at
Arlington, the <br>
growth characteristics of all of these plants tended to the same
type. In <br>
other words, they all tended to hemp of a certain height, Ñas I
say that occurred <br>
after three years of cultivation.<br>
<br>
DR. ROBINSON: I think that more or less that result is obtained. <br>
Professor Wright who may have had a little closer touch with the
problem <br>
could answer you better. Wouldn't that be your opinion, Professor
Wright?<br>
<br>
DR. WRIGHT: Yes, under the method used of applying open
pollinating, <br>
that was the tendency as far as our observation went,Ñthat they
were <br>
more or less alike.<br>
<br>
DR. ROBINSON: In reference to that, these stalks of hemp we
obtained <br>
last year from these various sources, have all been isolated, so
they have <br>
not been cross pollinated.<br>
<br>
DR. MUNCH I do not know where Mr. Young of Florence, South
Carolina, <br>
got his idea for the raising of Cannabis for a medicinal purpose
-<br>
<br>
DR. ROBINSON: He got it from Mr. Dewey.<br>
<br>
DR. MUNCH: There was a material decrease in the material before
he <br>
finally abandoned that project.<br>
<br>
DR. ROBINSON: I do not know how he obtained it all, or that he <br>
obtained it all from Mr. Dewey, but as I recall, he did.<br>
<br>
DR. MUNCH: There is one other question, and that is as to the
method <br>
by which the seeds themselves were obtained,-is that of any
interest to you?<br>
<br>
COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: Yes, Dr. Wright, can you give us
something <br>
on the that?<br>
<br>
DR. WRIGHT: Commercial seed used for commercial planting?<br>
<br>
COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: Yes.<br>
<br>
DR. WRIGHT: I do not have any notes on that. The seed are grown
from <br>
plants cultivated principally for seed; I mean the ordinary hemp
which has <br>
been planted for seed similar to corn. It is planted in rows, all
harvested <br>
by hand, and put in large shocks like those in Kentucky. It is
harvested in <br>
the latter part of September or the first of October in the
section in <br>
which it is grown. Then the shocks are dumped over on large
canvasses, <br>
smoothed out on the ground, and the stubble removed and beat out
with <br>
sticks in the old fashioned method. This is the only place in the
United <br>
States producing this commercially.<br>
<br>
DR. MATCHETT: Isn't most of the seed planted here produced in <br>
foreign countries?<br>
<br>
DR. WRIGHT: I do not get the question.<br>
<br>
DR. MATCHETT: Aren't most of the seeds produced in foreign <br>
countries?<br>
<br>
DR. WRIGHT: Most of the seed produced for Commercial purposes
originated in China, central China or towards the south part of
China and was carried here for cultivation. <br>
<br>
MR. WOLLNER: I believe what Dr. Matchett means is the commercial <br>
crop that is grown for instance in Wisconsin, does that originate
from <br>
seed grown in Kentucky, or the Far East?<br>
<br>
DR. WRIGHT: All of the hemp planted in the United States for <br>
commercial purposes comes from Kentucky. That is, all of the
legitimate <br>
hemp comes from seed grown in Kentucky. Does that answer the
question? <br>
DR. MATCHETT: Yes.<br>
<br>
COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: Dr. Matchett, you have been collaborating
<br>
with Dr. Robinson in these experiments at Arlington. Can you tell
us what <br>
results you obtained? Dr. Robinson has told us quite a lot about
the <br>
results, but I think you can probably elaborate upon them.<br>
<br>
DR. MATCHETT: First of all I might state we made these tests in
the <br>
manner that was published by us last year, and in the treatment
we <br>
divided the tests into six categories, according to the depth of
color that <br>
we obtained, beginning with zero for negative plants. These
plants which, <br>
gave us only traces of color, which we felt should not be
overlooked, but <br>
which we also felt would not constitute wholly satisfactory <br>
identification of the plant, were designated number one.<br>
<br>
Those plants characterized as 2, gave strong responses,
definitely <br>
positive, and those as 3, 4, and 5 responded with increasing
intensity in <br>
that order.<br>
<br>
Briefly we found on variety No. 1, a Rumanian variety 97.5% of
the <br>
plants tested would have been satisfactorily identified by the
Beam test. <br>
That is assuming for the moment the single test would be
sufficient, <br>
which I believe is generally understood not to be so.<br>
<br>
Variety No. 2, another Rumanian variety, gave us 100%.<br>
<br>
Variety No. 3, the third Rumanian variety, 87% of satisfactory <br>
response.<br>
<br>
Variety No. 5, Manchuria, 22.9% satisfactory response. <br>
<br>
Variety No. 6, Chinese, 13.8% satisfactory. <br>
<br>
Variety No. 9, Italian, 98.1%<br>
<br>
There is a very decided difference between the Chinese, and <br>
Manchurian varieties on the one hand and the Rumanian and Italian
<br>
varieties on the other.<br>
<br>
Now there were some very interesting things in reference to the <br>
differences between the three test periods.<br>
<br>
It is true that there was one rather decided change, particularly
in <br>
the second test, but there was not as significant difference
between the <br>
number of negative plants, nor was the difference worked with
reference <br>
to category No. l.<br>
<br>
The interesting thing was where we had many in category 2 in the <br>
first testing, in the next testing a considerable increase
appeared in <br>
category 4, with a corresponding decrease in category 2.<br>
<br>
The actual number of negative plants was not significantly <br>
different. I believe the first test gave us 36, the second test
32, and the <br>
third test 40.<br>
<br>
During the course of our activities we found that molding had no <br>
apparent effect on one alkaline test response of either negative
or <br>
positive plants. We permitted them to mold in a. very moist place
for a <br>
period of five weeks. There was no change in the Beam test.<br>
<br>
COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: I want to ask Dr. Wright a question. In <br>
harvesting the plant, Doctor, we understand that the farmer
usually <br>
harvests it before the resin reaches its highest stage. Is that
true?<br>
<br>
DR. WRIGHT: I will say yes, not knowing when the highest stage of
<br>
the resin is reached myself, but from what I could gather from
talking to <br>
Mr. Wollner and Dr. Link and those most familiar with the
subject. It is cut <br>
in the mid-blossom stage, and from what I understand the plants
are <br>
usually expected to have a high content of resin at that time. <br>
<br>
COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: In our eradication program, 16,000 acres <br>
have been gone over, and as I understand it we will also have to
go over <br>
that same acreage during the coming year, and probably the third
year. Do <br>
you know how long that seed will remain dormant in the soil? <br>
<br>
DR. WRIGHT: I can only give you some guess on that. It is quite <br>
variable, and how long the seed will remain in the soil is simply
my guess. <br>
If it is harvested the first year, before pollination occurs I
would expect <br>
that to handle the situation under most circumstances. I am
basing that on <br>
practical observation and experience, but if there is a
repetition and the <br>
plant does become a volunteer plant, if the same process as
followed for <br>
two years we could expect almost complete eradication. <br>
<br>
COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: What seed could replace the hemp seed as <br>
bird food? There is a lot of growth throughout the country due to
the <br>
casting about of bird seed. Now, however we require sterilization
of hemp <br>
seed. We have not reached the 100% point in sterilization but the
seed <br>
people tell us they should sell the seed in 5% mixtures; but even
5%, <br>
mixtures if the seed is not properly sterilized, might produce
some wild <br>
growth. Have you any suggestions on that?<br>
<br>
DR. WRIGHT: I believe that these gentlemen here from the animal <br>
biology department might be better able to judge of that than I
am.<br>
<br>
DR., COUCH: As a matter of fact, I do not know anything on that
point, <br>
and we have not gone into it at all. I am extremely interested
however.<br>
<br>
COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: I think there should be some discussion <br>
as to the relative activities between the male and the female
plants.<br>
<br>
DR. BLATT: May I ask a question of Dr. Robinson? As I understand
it, <br>
the average production is about 500 tons a year. Is that 500 tons
of fibre?<br>
<br>
DR. ROBINSON: Yes. This past summer, we had 1300 acres of hemp <br>
produced commercially in this country, and it has been running
about that <br>
acreage with the exception that in 1934 and 1935 this acreage
appeared in <br>
Minnesota, and in 1936 and 1937 we had a big acreages in
Illinois, but <br>
those were acreages planted, you might say, for other purposes
than the <br>
ordinary use, for there was an idea of producing fibre as a
substitute for a <br>
wool and various things of that nature. Those industries that
attempted to <br>
do that, for one reason or another, have dropped by the wayside,
and 1000 <br>
to 1500 acres is the normal hemp production each year in the
United <br>
States.<br>
<br>
MR. WOLLNER: Professor Wright, you heard Commissioner Anslinger's
<br>
question for information on the relationship between male and
female <br>
plants. You are undoubtedly aware of most of the discussions in
the past <br>
years on the subject of Marihuana, and that it has centered
around the <br>
female plant. As a matter of fact, I believe the United States <br>
Pharmacopoeia refers to the flowering type of the female plant,
and it is <br>
stated that Marihuana comes mostly from the female plant. I
wonder <br>
whether historically that might not have arisen from the fact
that <br>
possibly the male plant flowered at an earlier period than the
female <br>
plant in the growth of the plant itself, and at the time of
harvesting by <br>
force of circumstance they were limited to harvesting female
tops. <br>
<br>
DR. WRIGHT: Not actually knowing it, I could not say, of course,
but I <br>
am sure that is the answer. In the male plant the leaves drop off
long <br>
before, the female plant, and when the traffickers have reached
the plant <br>
the leaves have practically all gone from the male, but the
females are <br>
luxuriant.<br>
<br>
MR. LEVINE: Is there any distinction between the fiber of males
and <br>
females?<br>
<br>
DR. WRIGHT: You see, in fibre, they are cut at an early stage
when the <br>
female plants are just forming the bud, and the male plants just
shedding the pollen.<br>
<br>
MR. WOLLNER: Then the male plant would grow as tall as the female
<br>
plant.<br>
<br>
DR. WRIGHT: Yes, they do usually reach the same height.<br>
MR. WOLLNER. When produced for fibre, the plant does not reach
the <br>
height we experienced in Arlington.<br>
<br>
DR. WRIGHT: It has reached its full height when cut for fibre.
You <br>
planted it in rows, too, which would add to the height.<br>
<br>
MR. HERWICK: I should like to ask Professor Wright a question as
to <br>
whether or not there was any quantity of Cannabis raised in this
country <br>
for commercial drug purposes.<br>
<br>
DR. WRIGHT: I cannot answer that question.<br>
<br>
DR. ROBINSON: Undoubtedly there are others here who could furnish
<br>
that information. I do not know of a single case where any of it
has been <br>
furnished companies for that purpose, but I think there are
companies that <br>
get it for that purpose.<br>
<br>
MR. SMITH: There was a concern that grew it in Indianapolis
several <br>
years ago for their own purposes.<br>
<br>
COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: Most of the pharmaceutical houses before <br>
enactment of Federal Marihuana Legislation obtained their
Cannabis supply from the Middle West. There was relatively little
importation of Cannabis for medical purposes.<br>
<br>
DR. COUCH: In the Food and Drug Administration, we occasionally
see <br>
a questionnaire sent to the importers more or less of the patent
medicine <br>
type, and also some well known pharmaceutical houses where
cannabis is <br>
still found in the formula for certain products. Under the Pure
Food and <br>
Drug Act, we have some requirements on that, and we are informed
what <br>
the source of it is, whether gotten in this country or through
importation.<br>
<br>
COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: I think the stocks of some of the larger <br>
houses who are still putting this out are sufficient to carry
them over for <br>
a considerable period of time. Some of the firms transferred or
sold their <br>
product to other houses, but I know of a number of occasions
where raw <br>
material was obtained in this country for the local trade.<br>
<br>
DR. WRIGHT: I have been informed by Doctors that they did get a <br>
considerable amount of their prepared processed material from
Mexico. I <br>
was wondering if there was any processing plant in Mexico.<br>
<br>
COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: I did not know they imported it for <br>
medical uses from Mexico.<br>
<br>
DR. MUNCH: Many of the commercial manufacturers have grown it,
but <br>
because of the extreme variability of the potency of the material
they <br>
were growing themselves, they attempted to import it from Madras
or <br>
Bombay. But the material imported was often weaker than that
grown in <br>
this country. So the next step was to purchase from Mr. Young at <br>
Charleston, South Carolina, or the general neighborhood of
Lexington, <br>
Kentucky, or Nantou, Illinois. But, those sources folded up
within the last <br>
ten years and there has not been any substantial production of
material in <br>
the United States since then. I tested most of the material grown
in this <br>
country that has been offered.<br>
<br>
COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: I suppose that seed came from Kentucky, <br>
which in turn came from China.<br>
<br>
DR. MUNCH: That is true, but I have tested material grown in the <br>
United States commercially that was more potent in its
physiological <br>
aspects than that imported from India.<br>
<br>
MR. FULLER: I think that came about as a result of the interest
that <br>
developed in the production of it during the war, or just before
we got into <br>
the war, because at that time I was in the field myself and grew
it com-<br>
mercially for four or five years in Virginia from that same stock
of seed <br>
that Young used in South Carolina, and which was obtained from
the Bureau of Plant Industry. I do not know whether he got it
from Dewey or not.<br>
<br>
The plan we adopted was to cull out as much as possible the tall <br>
plants for purely commercial reasons. We could not get so much
material <br>
from the tall plants. In other words, bushy plants grew up six
and seven <br>
feet high, giving much more drug than those that grew up taller
but not so <br>
bushy, When we considered it the proper time, you would grab hold
of it. It <br>
felt like a sponge. We collected enough material then to produce
a drug <br>
very much more potent than any imported material that came into
the <br>
country.<br>
<br>
It was our experience that it really did not make much difference
<br>
where the hemp came from, after it had been grown here and become
<br>
acclimated to our conditions you could select bushy plants from
it, and it <br>
was just as potent. It did not make any difference where it came
from. We <br>
used to cull our plants, particularly the male plants. I used to
think it did <br>
not have much effect, but be that as it may, that was what we
did. I do not <br>
think we could have ever used the male plants anyway for, in
stripping, <br>
the amount of material obtained was so small.<br>
<br>
COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: How did you strip the plant?<br>
<br>
MR. FULLER: It was a very easy process. It was done by women, and
<br>
they used gloves. In all of the years we were producing that
material as far as we knew, there never was a case of where
anybody used it for illegitimate purposes. In fact at that time,
I do <br>
not think there was any Marihuana used. But, it did not pay us to
go on.<br>
<br>
I think a great deal of the Cannabis sold in the drug trade came
from <br>
the wild materials that grew in the Middle West and one of the
largest <br>
dealers in drugs handled that crop. I knew him very well, and he
told me at <br>
the time.<br>
<br>
DR. BROMBERG: What further preparation was there after stripping <br>
for medicinal purposes?<br>
<br>
MR. FULLER: We just baled it and sold it.<br>
<br>
DR. BROMBERG: Any other processing necessary?<br>
<br>
MR. FULLER: In the manufacturing of medicinals, it has to be <br>
extracted usually with alcohol end concentrated down to a solid
extract. <br>
There was no attempt, and I do not think there has been any
attempt made, <br>
to separate for commercial purposes the active principle, for
even with <br>
all of the work done, we do not know what it is.<br>
<br>
MR. WOLLNER: Did you find, Mr. Fuller, in your growth of the
plant <br>
commercially, that arid seasons or drier seasons would increase,
or <br>
produce an increased quantity of resin?<br>
<br>
MR. FULLER: I do not think we noticed any difference. Now, I was
in <br>
that portion of Virginia very near to Washington on the first
plateau, six <br>
or eight miles out, and some of those summers were very dry. We
would <br>
get sometimes six weeks without rain, and it did not seem to
affect the <br>
yield at all. One season, I recall particularly, there was a
great deal of <br>
rain, and the crop was just about the same.<br>
<br>
MR. WOLLNER: I would like to offer this thought to the Department
of <br>
Agriculture. The statement is invariably made by people in Europe
and the <br>
Far East and Near East that the amount of resin produced by a
plant is in a <br>
measure proportionate to the rainfall, and the less rainfall the
more resin. <br>
I wonder whether we are actually dealing with the question of the
<br>
variation in the amount of resin produced as against the amount
of resin <br>
exuded. That is to say, isn't it possible as a result of a
condition, all that <br>
happens is the plant structure, so to speak, shrinks to
evaporation and <br>
greater amount of resin appears on the surface, but the absolute
quantity <br>
contained by the flowering tops and the leaves is the same ?<br>
<br>
DR. ROBINSON: I think your point is well taken, and it was my <br>
intention to go into some of those points in those tests
throughout the United States. We collected material over at
Arlington Farm last summer at various stages for the purpose of <br>
making a microtome test of these little pockets. So far we have
not had <br>
time to do very much on that, and there are gentlemen here who
have done <br>
more. We actually found those pockets present in pants two weeks
old and <br>
on varying specimens which we have in our office. We want back to
plants <br>
that were less [than] three weeks old and we found there hashish
material. <br>
Now in older plants in some of the specimens we have of Indian
hemp, it <br>
seemed to be exuded from the cells all over the surface, and I
imagine in <br>
such plants as that, if it exuded if you touched it, much more
would come <br>
off than if it had not exuded. Is that what you mean, certain
climatic <br>
conditions would cause cells to erupt, and the viscosity of the
exudate <br>
would be such that it would spread.<br>
<br>
MR. WOLLNER: I am thinking in terms of opium or the poppy. You
can <br>
get opium from the pod without scarifying, and the thought struck
me, in <br>
the case of Cannabis, since the leaf is always extracted in this
country, <br>
and since in the past the process has been of rubbing it from the
outside, <br>
in the East, they get more resin than we do, due to the fact that
more has <br>
exuded but not more produced.<br>
<br>
DR. HIBBEN: There is another factor involved in the question
about <br>
rainfall, and the formation of resin, and that is perhaps the
production of <br>
resin would depend upon the amount of sunshine, and the more
rainfall, the <br>
less sunshine. In tomato plants for example, the Department of <br>
Agriculture has done a great deal of experimentation as to
foliage, and [it] <br>
has been shown that the quantity of foliage depends greatly upon
the <br>
duration of sunshine the plant has received.<br>
<br>
MR. WOLLNER: I had not thought of that. <br>
<br>
DR. HIBBEN: Some plants require a great deal of sunshine. <br>
<br>
DR. WRIGHT: May I ask you this question, - I was interested in
the <br>
fact that you selected the bushy plant believing it more
profitable to do <br>
that. <br>
<br>
MR. FULLER: Yes.<br>
<br>
DR. WRIGHT: Did you have any observations at all to indicate they
<br>
were more potent or more satisfactory to the purchaser than the
more <br>
slender plants; have you any reason to believe there is a
difference <br>
between the two?<br>
<br>
MR. FULLER: No, I do not think there is any difference, for the
green <br>
leaf from the male plant yields resin, and as far as we could
determine, <br>
the resin was just as potent as the female. You do not get so
much per plant. That was <br>
what we were interested in, but, as far as quality is concerned,
I do not <br>
think there was any difference.<br>
<br>
COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: And now, Gentlemen, if we have no more <br>
questions on the agricultural phase of the problem we will
proceed to a <br>
little more controversial subject. The pharmacological phase. I
would like <br>
to have Dr. Munch give us a little history of the pharmacology of
<br>
Marihuana.<br>
