<H3><CENTER>MARIJUANA AS MEDICINE REFUTED BY NIH SCIENTISTS by Janet D.
Lapey, M.D.</CENTER>
</H3>
In June 1991, the U.S. Public Health Service ordered a study of the issue
of medical marijuana by the nation's top scientists at the National Institutes
of Health. In March 1992, at the completion of their long thorough review,
the NIH scientists issued a report stating that there were better, safer
drugs available than marijuana cigarettes. The report contained specific
factsheets concerning cancer chemotherapy, the AIDS wasting syndrome, multiple
sclerosis, pain, and glaucoma. <BR>
<BR>
These factsheets stated that &quot;Marijuana cigarette smoke contains a
complex mixture of over 400 compounds including polyareomatic hydrocarbons
which are carcinogenic. This would be a concern for anyone, but especially
for patients with chronic disorders and/or impaired immune systems.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
The National Eye Institute factsheet on the Therapeutic Use of Marijuana
for Glaucoma states that the NEI did research on marijuana from 1978 to
1988, and &quot;none of the studies demonstrated that marijuana or any of
its components could safely and effectively lower intraocular pressure enough
to prevent optic nerve damage from glaucoma.&quot; Undesirable side effects
were produced by smoking marijuana, such as elevated blood pressure and
dry eye. It was noted that these patients would also be at risk for respiratory
damage. Furthermore, marijuana smoking is not an optimal drug delivery system,
lacking a standardized product and method of assuring the bioavailability
of its active ingredients. There are 24 FDA approved drugs for the treatment
of glaucoma. In conclusion, &quot;there is no scientifically verifiable
evidence that marijuana or its derivatives are safe and effective in the
treatment of glaucoma.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
The National Cancer Institute factsheet noted that the FDA has approved
synthetic THC (Marinol) and a related synthetic drug, Cesamet, for use in
chemotherapy patients who have failed to respond to other anti-nausea agents.
However the NCI scientists believe that marijuana-related compounds probably
are not as effective as certain other antiemetics or combinations of emetics
in controlling nausea and vomiting. Moreover, inhaling marijuana smoke is
a health hazard. Other antiemetic agents such as ondansetron, metoclopramine,
droperidol, etc. have been shown to be more useful than marijuana-related
compounds as first line therapy. <BR>
<BR>
The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke factsheet stated
that there is no evidence that marijuana is effective in modifying the course
of multiple sclerosis and that only anecdotal reports of benefit have been
reported. The report mentioned that a suppository formulation of THC is
being tested on human beings and that this promises better bioavailability
than the oral form. <BR>
<BR>
The National Institute of Dental Research factsheet reported that no controlled
studies of the effects of marijuana on acute or chronic pain exist, thus
there is insufficient evidence to recommend marijuana as treatment for pain.
<BR>
<BR>
The National Institute on Allergy and Infectious Diseases factsheet reports
that studies of the effect of oral THC on the HIV-wasting syndrome are underway.
Also the suppository THC is being tested in normal volunteers. Again it
is mentioned that marijuana cigarette smoke would be a concern for patients
with compromised immune systems. <BR>
