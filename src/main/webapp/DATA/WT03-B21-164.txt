<P>UPDATE ON STATUS OF KASSANDRA MINES PROJECT

<P>Toronto, Ontario, March 11, 1996 ... TVX Gold Inc. announced today that, in connection with its recently acquired Kassandra Mines operations in Greece, it is encouraged by the recent reaffirmation of support by the Greek Government to the successful development and operation of these assets. Eike Batista, Chairman and CEO of the Company, stated that "TVX continues to be very excited about the potential of this project and is committed to the successful establishment of a significant gold producing operation; the Company looks forward to working in conjunction with and with the support of the Greek Government to achieve this objective".

<P>TVX President John Hick and other Company officials had an extremely positive meeting last Thursday with Greek Development Minister Mrs. Vasso Papandreou and her Deputy Minister Mr. Ioannidis in which concerns relating to delays caused by local protesters at the Olympias mine site and the most appropriate means by which to obtain all requisite development and operating permits and licences were discussed and addressed and the Government's strong support of the project was reaffirmed. After this meeting, representatives of the Ministry reported that "both the Government and the Ministry are resolved to go ahead with the project" and that, with respect to preventing further delays at the Olympias mine site, "measures will be taken against illegal acts and local residents will be briefed, in cooperation with TVX Hellas, that the project is environmentally sound." Local resistance to the reopening of the Olympias mining operations is apparently based on environmental concerns and the potential effect on local tourism. Both TVX and the Government anticipate that this opposition will be eliminated when residents are made more aware of modern environmentally sound operating practices, the positive environmental contribution of the proposed pressure oxidation gold recovery plant and the importance TVX places on environmental issues and its sound environmental operating record internationally.

<P>TVX Hellas continues to enjoy local support in the Stratoni region in connection with the reopening of mining activities in that area and mine rehabilitation and initial environmental work is proceeding.

<P>In the meeting with the Ministers, a joint task force comprised of representatives of the Ministry and TVX Hellas was established to facilitate and expedite both overcoming the local concerns and the implementation of the mine rehabilitation program and gold plant construction.

<P>The Kassandra Mines assets are located on the eastern coastal region on the Chalkidiki Peninsula in northeastern Greece, approximately 110 kilometers east of Thessaloniki, Greece's second largest city. They encompass mining concessions over a total area of 314 square kilometers and include the Olympias and Stratoni deposits, including three existing producing mines, base metal milling facilities capable of in excess of 3,000 Tpd and a ship loading facility on the Aegean Sea. The Olympias and Stratoni deposits have been mined for the last 30 years, producing lead/silver and zinc concentrates. Indicated current reserves at Kassandra are approximately 14 million tonnes grading 6.3 grams per tonne of gold (approximately 2.8 million ounces), 100 grams per
tonne silver (approximately 500,000 ounces of gold equivalent ), 3.6% lead and 4.8% zinc.
There is also an existing stockpile of arsenopyrite/pyrite in excess of 200,000 tonnes grading
22.65grams per tonne of gold (approximately 145,000 ounces). The gold content of the ore was
not previously exploited due to its refractory nature.
