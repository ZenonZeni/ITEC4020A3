<h1><a name="RTFToC1">SCIENTIFIC COMMITTEE ON ANTARCTIC RESEARCH</a></h1>
<A HREF="http://www.gold.net/users/db62/scarcomnap.html">XXIV SCAR, 4-16 August 1996, Cambridge, United Kingdom.</A>
<h2><a name="RTFToC2">Constitution</a></h2>

SCAR is a scientific committee of the International Council of
Scientific Unions (ICSU) charged with the initiation, promotion, and
coordination of scientific activity in the Antarctic, with a view to
framing and reviewing scientific programmes of circumpolar scope and
significance.  In establishing programmes, SCAR will respect the
autonomy of other existing international bodies.
<P>
<h3><a name="RTFToC3">Guidelines for the conduct of SCAR affairs</a></h3>
<P>
l.  SCAR will encourage and assist in the acquisition and dissemination of
    scientific knowledge derived from research carried out in its area
    of interest.
<P>
2.  In formulating its scientific programmes, SCAR will pay attention
    to their possible contributions to global programmes of ICSU
    bodies and other scientific organisations.  SCAR may establish
    liaison and cooperation with international organisations having
    scientific interests in the Antarctic.
<P>
3.  SCAR will abstain from involvement in political and juridical
    matters, including the formulation of management measures for
    exploitable resources, except where SCAR accepts an invitation for
    specific advice.  However, in formulating its scientific
    programmes SCAR will take note of the need for the acquisition of
    the scientific knowledge necessary for the judicious management of
    the resources of the region.
<P>
4.  SCAR may provide scientific and technological advice to the
    Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meetings, or to other international
    organisations (both governmental and non-governmental).
<P>
5.  SCAR will keep under review scientific matters pertaining to the
    integrity of the Antarctic environment, including the conservation
    of its terrestrial and marine ecosystems.
<P>

Committees to communicate with SCAR.
<P>
<h4><a name="RTFToC6">2.  Associate members</a></h4>

National organisations adhering to ICSU, or nominated by national
organisations adhering to ICSU, which desire to participate in SCAR
for scientific reasons but which do not qualify for full membership.

<h4><a name="RTFToC7">3. Union members</a></h4>

ICSU Unions wishing to participate in SCAR on a continuing basis.

<h4><a name="RTFToC8">Delegates</a></h4>

    hold office for one four-year term only, but the Secretary is
    eligible for re-election for one further term only.
<P>
2.  The Executive Committee is responsible to ICSU for the
