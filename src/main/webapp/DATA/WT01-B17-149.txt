<a name="rise"><h4>RISE ABOVE IMPOTENCE WITH HERBAL HELPERS</h4></a>

A study of 1709 men, aged 40-70, revealed that 52% have experienced some degree of impotence, according to The Journal of Urology, January 1994. Impotence increases with age; at age 40, 5% of men have complete impotence and by age 70, 15% are completely unable to have an erection. However, alternative medicine has natural remedies for restoring male sexual vitality, according to naturopathic physician Marcus Laux, N.D. <p>
<b>L-ARGININE</b> is an amino acid that can help enhance erections. Take 3-9 g daily with meals or up to 15 g about 45 minutes before sexual activity, says Dr. Laux. Arginine is not recommended if you have diabetes, arthritis, cancer, herpes, fever blisters, cold sores, or shingles.<p>
<b>CHOLINE</b> is a key component of the brain chemical (neurotransmitter) acetylcholine, which helps transmit messages and nerve impulses from the brain to the genitals. Take 1000 mg daily on an empty stomach, advises Dr. Laux.<p>
<b>VITAMIN B5</b> helps to boost levels of acetylcholine, increase stamina and muscular endurance, and produce adrenal hormones. Take 300-500 mg daily on an empty stomach, advises Dr. Laux.<p>
<b>CORYNANTHE YOHIMBE</b> is a traditional herb used as an aphrodisiac to enhance overall sexual desire rather than improving erection response, says Dr. Laux. Take as directed by product label.<p>
<b>MARAPUAMA (potency wood)</b> is another traditional herb for reviving libido and tonifying the nervous system. In a French study of 262 men who either lacked sexual desire or experienced impotence, within 2 weeks of taking about 1.5 g daily of this herb, 67% of those with depressed libido reported a dramatic improvement and 51% of those with erection failure claimed positive benefits. A standard dosage is 20 drops in water, taken orally twice daily.<p>
<b>CATUABA,</b> also known as Brazilian juniper, is recognized by the Tipu Indians of Brazil as a tonic for the male sexual organs, as it produces an aphrodisiac effect with no known side effects. A typical dosage is 20 drops in water, taken orally twice daily.<p>
<b>OPTI-POTENT POTION</b> contains 5 Brazilian herbs, including marapuama, catuaba, suma, guarana, and damiana, in fairly strong dosages, says Dr. Laux. He advises men to take 1-2 capsules (500 mg each) once or twice daily, but not to exceed 3 g daily as its ingredients can act as a stimulant like caffeine.<p>
<b>PANAX PLUS</b> a blend of Panax ginseng, a known sexual stimulant, Siberian ginseng, and selected rainforest aphrodisiacal herbs (such as catuaba and marapuama), is highly energizing. Dr. Laux suggests 2-3 drops twice daily.<p>
<b>WARRIOR</b> a formula usually prescribed for building athletic stamina, blends 14 herbs from both rainforest and Chinese medicine traditions. Take 2-3 drops 2-3 times daily, as needed, recommends Dr. Laux.<p>
<b>OTHER FACTORS</b> Chronic stress and pre-existing illnesses such as diabetes can contribute to male impotence, says Dr. Laux, as well as the frequent use of at least 200 different medications, such as beta blockers, diuretics, and antidepressants. Over-use of alcohol and overeating can each inhibit male sexual vitality. Dr. Laux suggests that men abstain from alcohol for 30 days to see if there is improvement.<p>

<a name="natr"><h4>NATURAL REMEDIES TO STOP DENTAL PLAQUE</h4></a>

Within a week after an infant is born, oral bacteria appear in the mouth, beginning what will become a lifetime problem. These bacteria—most common of which are Streptococcus salivarius, S. mitis, and S. mutans—feed on the ingredients in the foods we eat, especially sugars, and adhere to the dense enamel surface of our teeth. As the oral bacteria digest our carbohydrates, they produce acids that begin to dissolve the protective enamel tooth surface. The eventual result can be cavities, gum disease, and the deterioration of the teeth’s supporting structures. <p>
In addition to regular professional teeth cleanings, here are self-care recommendations for controlling plaque from dentist Flora Parsa Stay, D.D.S., who practices holistic dentistry in Oxnard, California.<p>
SUPPLEMENTS. Take calcium (1500 mg daily) to prevent bone loss; coenzyme Q10 (60 mg daily) to get more oxygen to the gums; kelp (500 mg daily) for trace minerals; magnesium (750 mg daily) to support the activity of calcium; phosphorus (1500 mg daily) to help reduce cavity formation; and vitamin C (2000 mg daily) to help heal bleeding gums.<p>
HERBS. Useful here are alfalfa (1000 mg daily) for trace minerals, and goldenseal and myrrh, used as a mouthwash, to help heal gum disease. To prepare a goldenseal mouthwash, mix one tablespoon goldenseal tincture with one teaspoon baking soda and one cup warm water; cool and strain before using. To make the myrrh mouthwash, mix one tablespoon myrrh tincture with one cup of warm water; cool before using.<p>
HOMEOPATHIC REMEDIES. Use these only as needed, Dr. Parsa Stay advises: Mercurius Solubilis 6X (one tablet daily) to help heal inflamed gums; and Staphysagria 30X (one tablet daily) to help heal gums that bleed and feel spongy.<p>
PROFESSIONAL TIPS. Daily teeth brushing and flossing are better at controlling plaque than most commercial mouthwashes and toothpastes. An effective way to reduce the acid level in your mouth is to do daily rinses with a baking soda solution (such as with goldenseal, described above) and a toothpaste containing baking soda. Reduce your consumption of sugars and processed carbohydrates and eat more raw vegetables, fruits, and whole grains, says Dr. Parsa Stay. <p>

<a name="use"><h4>HERBS CAN EASE YOUR WAY THROUGH PMS</h4></a>

For many women, especially those aged 30-40, premenstrual syndrome (PMS) can be a once-monthly time of discomfort. Typical symptoms can include nervousness, irritability, mood swings, abdominal bloating, depression, headaches, water retention, breast tenderness, nausea, constipation, or backache. The strategic use of herbs can help reduce the discomfort of PMS, advises naturopath Donald J. Brown, N.D. Here are his recommendations:<p>
Vitus agnus-castus (chaste tree), taken as 40 drops liquid extract or one capsule dried extract, once daily in the morning to help restore the normal balance of progesterone and estrogen.<p>
Evening primrose oil (3-4 g daily,  with meals) to correct imbalanced metabolism of essential fatty acids. This will release the hormone prostaglandin which reduces cramps in the uterus and breast tenderness.<p>
Dong quai (Angelica sinensis; 2-3 g, in 2-3 divided doses) for relief of uterine cramps and pain.<p>
Milk thistle extract (420 mg daily,  divided into 3 doses; it should contain 70-80% silymarin) to support the function of the liver where excess estrogen is metabolized.<p>
Nutritional supplements: Dr. Brown further recommends taking an allergen-free multivitamin every day, vitamin B6 (100 mg, 2X daily), magnesium (400-600 mg daily), and vitamin E (400 IU, with meals).<p>
Dietary Recommendations: Dr. Brown advises cutting down on saturated fats from meat and dairy products; reducing intake of processed carbohydrates (white flour products) and concentrated carbohydrates (fruit juices, dried fruits), diet sodas, and caffeine; and eating more complex carbohydrates and fiber foods from vegetables, fruits, and whole grains.<p>

<a name="your"><h4>KILLER CARPETS</h4></a>

Your Allergies Are Not in Your Head, But May Be in the Rug<p>
Many people who are chemically-sensitive, highly allergic, or laid low with chronic fatigue syndrome often tell their physicians that they suspected common household items, including carpets, were somehow poisoning them. Often doctors dismiss these associations as purely in the patient’s head. Now there is substantial scientific data to support the claims of poisoning. Your carpet may be bad for your health and you may be better off with bare floors.<p>
Rosalind Anderson, Ph.D., of Anderson Laboratories in Dedham, Massachusetts, analyzed the effect of gas emissions on laboratory mice, based on over 300 carpet samples obtained through retail stores, carpet mills, or from patients’ homes. All carpets had been in use from one week to 12 years and none were older than 40 years. To get her disturbing results, Dr. Anderson performed over 500 different experiments. <p>
She found that carpet emissions decreased the breathing rate of mice immediately on contact, from a norm of 280 times per minute to a low, after 8 minutes of exposure, of 235. When the mice were removed from exposure to the carpet emissions, their respiration rates became normal again. Dr. Anderson next learned that one or more exposures of the mice to the carpet samples produced a range of alarming symptoms, including swollen face, hemorrhaging beneath the skin surface, altered posture, loss of balance, hyperactivity, tremors, limb paralysis, convulsions, even death. <p>
Then she analyzed 125 carpet samples for signs of neurotoxicity, that is, emissions that harm brain cells or the nervous system. Dr. Anderson found that 90% produced at least one toxic effect and 60% produced 3 or more “severe neurotoxic effects” in at least 25% of the mice. <p>
Over 200 different chemicals have been identified in the typical modern carpet, according to Dr. Anderson, and these can produce “diverse toxic effects” in humans, including flu-like symptoms, muscle pain, fatigue, tremors, headaches (lasting up to 16 weeks after exposure), memory loss, and concentration difficulties. When it comes to negative health effects from carpets, “this is not a psychological phenomenon,” says Dr. Anderson.<p>
