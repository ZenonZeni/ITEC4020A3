	REVOLUTIONARY INTRANET SECURITY PRODUCT TO BE DEMONSTRATED AT INTEROP DOTCOM
	<p>	
	"NetFortress effortlessly turns Internet into a secure, low-cost WAN"<br>
	headlines Info World product review.
	<p>
 	</font>

	September 13, 1996, Englewood Cliffs, NJ.  Join Digital Secured Networks
	Technology, Inc. (DSN) at Interop DotCom in Atlanta, Georgia, for a
	demonstration of  the NetFortress - an Intranet security solution that
	offers "easy setup" and "extreme security," according to a product review in
	Info World Magazine.  Interop DotCom is held in conjunction with
	Networld+Interop in the Georgia World Congress Center, September 18-20.  DSN
	will be in booth 344H.
	<p> 
	"The NetFortress encryption product is a great alternative for those who
	want to send confidential information over the Internet instead of using a
	more costly private network," writes Info World's test center in the
	September 9, 1996 product review section.  "I greatly appreciated the
	NetFortress' lack of complexity...  The system worked flawlessly."
	<p>
	Literally a black box, the NetFortress fully automates hardware-based
	athentication, encryption and key exchange into a plug and play solution.
	It completely eliminates the possibility of IP spoofing, eavesdropping and
	break-ins.
 	<p>
	ommenting on the product's advanced encryption methodology, Info World
	writes, "I examined the packets traveling between two locations...  After
	installing the NetFortress,...  I couldn't even tell which service a given
	packet was from - everything but the packet header itself was rendered
	undecipherable as it traversed the Internet."
	<p>
	DSN will release a white paper on the NetFortress at Interop DotCom.  The
	report will provide technical explanations of the NetFortress'
	authentication, encryption and key exchange procedures.
	<p>
	Members of the press are invited to stop by the booth or make an appointment
	with PR Manager Jo Lee to learn more about the NetFortress.  
	<p> 
	Established in 1995, DSN Technology was founded by Dr. Aharon Friedman and
	Mr. Andy Savas to develop superior security systems to serve as industry
	standards for IP and IPX network environments.

	DSN's CHAIRMAN URGES SENATE COMMITTEE TO RELAX ENCRYPTION EXPORT LAWS  (<A HREF="june12speech.html">READ THE SPEECH</a>)
	<p>
	Testimony Before Senate Hearings Shows Current Law Threatens America's
	Ability to Compete with Foreign Developers of Encryption Technology Products
	<p>

	Testimony Before Senate Hearings Shows Current Law Threatens America’s
	Ability to Compete with Foreign Developers of Encryption Technology Products
	<P>
	June 13, 1996. Englewood Cliffs, NJ.  Dr. Aharon Friedman, Founder and
	Chairman of DSN Technology testified yesterday in a hearing before the
	Senate Sub-Committee on Technology, Science, and Space that current
	government restrictions on the export of high-level encryption products
	undermine the competitive position of American companies in this global market.
	<P>
	As an expert cryptographer, Dr. Friedman testified in support S. 1726,
	Promotion of Commerce Online in the Digital Era Act of 1996, or "Pro-CODE".
	<P>
	"Today, we have in our office an executive from a major Japanese company
	who is interested in evaluating our security solution for several large
	installations.  This company is attracted to our product because of its
	advanced encryption technology.  However, existing laws turn the product’s
	strength into a liability and may force this prospective client to seek a
	solution from a foreign  competitor."
	<p>
	Dr. Friedman dramatically demonstrated how hackers armed with a $400
	computer chip can easily break the encryption, or the keys, of security
	products that American companies are limited to export.  Better endowed
	terrorist governments or criminals engaged in corporate espionage can break
	these keys in less than a second.
	<p>
	"While existing laws deny adequate encryption to companies engaged in legal
	activities, access to more powerful encryption solutions remain available
	for illegal purposes."  Demonstrating this point, Dr. Friedman turned to
	page 637 of Applied Cryptography written by Bruce Schneier, and showed the
	committee members code for an unbreakable encryption program that hackers
	can use to circumvent existing encryption laws.
	<p>
	Testimony in support of the bill was also presented by:
 	<ul>
	<li>Michael Zisman, president and CEO of Lotus
	<li>Jim Barksdale, president and CEO of Netscape Communications
	<li>Jim Bidzos, president and CEO of RSA Data Security, and
	<li>Tim Krauskopf, V.P. and co-founder of Spyglass Inc.
	</ul>
	Full text of Dr. Friedman’s speech is available by fax or email.  It is also
	published in full at DSN’s web site:  http://www.dsnt.com
	<p>
	Representing a quantum leap forward in Intranet security, the NetFortress'
	unique core technology creates an impenetrable line of communication over
	the Internet to other NetFortress protected hosts.  It fully integrates
	automated hardware-based IP authentication, network layer encryption, and
	512 bit dual key exchange into a seamless plug and play solution.
	<p>
	As a stand alone unit or with a firewall, the NetFortress is platform
	independent, easy to install, and maintenance-free.  It eliminates the
	possibility of IP spoofing, eavesdropping and break-ins.

	MAJOR FLAWS SEEN IN VISA/MASTERCARD SECURITY PLAN FOR INTERNET
	COMMERCE
	<p>
	Network Security Expert Says RSA Encryption and Authentication
	Standard Leaves Consumers Vulnerable to Hackers
	<p>
	</font>
	<font size=3>
	April 16, 1996, Englewood Cliffs, NJ.  A newly proposed standard by Visa and
	Mastercard for safeguarding bankcard transactions on the Internet will not
	protect consumers and can be bypassed by sophisticated hackers according to
	Dr. Aharon Friedman, chairman of Digital Secured Networks Technology, Inc.
	(DSN).
	<P>
	Commenting on Visa and Mastercard's Secure Electronic Transactions (SET)
	standard, Dr. Friedman said that "consumers should be extremely careful of
	using their credit cards on the Internet until SET's encryption and
	authentication procedures are radically improved.  While I strongly support
	the idea behind SET, the standard as it is currently proposed fails to
	provide a sufficient level of security to support electronic commerce."
	<P>
	Announced in February by Visa and Mastercard, SET establishes a single
	technical standard for protecting payment card purchases made over open
	networks such as the Internet.  Participants in the SET consortium include
	Microsoft, Netscape Communications Corp., GTE, IBM, SAIC, Terisa Systems,
	Verisign and others.  SET is based on encryption and authentication
	technology from RSA Data Security (recently purchased by Security Dynamics.)
	<P>
	According to Dr. Friedman, "The degree of protection provided by RSA's
	encryption method is very disappointing.  Their encryption method only
	encrypts parts of a communication packet leaving critical information
	exposed."  This info say DSN officials can be used by cyber-criminals to
	corrupt the transaction process.
	<P>
	Set's authentication procedure also carries risks for consumers says Dr.
	Friedman.  "SET's authentication procedure relies on a completely insecure
	medium, namely software, to verify the parties involved in a transaction
	process."  SET designates a third party, called a certificate authority, to
	authenticate the sender and receiver.  This certificate authority is no more
	than a series of software applications, or lines of code that can be altered
	by unauthorized users. Dr. Friedman warned, "Unlike hardware, software
	security solutions are very susceptible to alteration and should not be
	relied on as an authentication mechanism."
	<P>
	Dr. Friedman said that, "A hardware solution that encrypts at a more
	elementary level can be integrated into the overall SET framework."
	<P>
	Established in 1995, DSN Technology Inc. is a developer of patent-pending
	network security solutions for Intranets and virtual private networks.  The
	company's flagship product, the NetFortress, fully integrates IP
	authentication, network layer encryption and dual key exchange into a
	seamless hardware-based, plug and play solution.
	<P>
	An expert in network security and computing, Dr. Friedman is the chief
	product developer at DSN Technology.  He is a former senior scientist at
	Brookhaven National Laboratories and research physicist at SAIC.

	According to DSN's Founder and Chairman Dr. Aharon Friedman, "With the value of information stolen from the Internet reportedly reaching $10 billion annually, companies should be extremely wary of relying on security products originally intended for private networks, such as firewalls, to secure data on public networks.  The uniqueness of the NetFortress is that it's the only security solution specifically designed for, and fully capable of protecting corporate IP-based communication systems."
	<p>
	Dr. Friedman will be demonstrating the NetFortress at MIT's Technology Fair, March 27, 1996 at the Cambridge (MA) Hyatt in the Adams Ballroom.
	<p>
	DSN plans to market the NetFortress primarily to banks, financial institutions, brokerage firms, medical facilities, insurance companies, and Internet service providers.
	<p>
	Established in 1995, DSN Technology was founded by Dr. Friedman develop superior security systems to serve as industry standards for Internet, IP and IPX network environments.
