<P>Using fluorescent bulbs:	
<UL>
<LH></LH>
<LI>Use compact fluorescent lights whenever your can; they give out more lumens per watt than incandescent lamps.  These new lights can fit into many incandescent lamp sockets and provide the same quality of light.  
<LI>With efficiencies of 50-60 lumens per watt, the compact fluorescent lamps are 3-4 times more efficient than conventional bulbs and last 10 times as long.  For example, an 18-watt compact fluorescent lamp produces the same amount of light as a 75-watt incandescent lamp.  Although the initial cost is higher, the savings in electricity costs could pay for the compact fluorescent bulb in about a year.
