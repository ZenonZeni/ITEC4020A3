Plain Talk On What's Ahead For Taiwan's Chip Business -- Industry
leaders speak out on fab plans, technology alliances, and strategies
for the next decade


Taiwan's semiconductor industry is headed for sales of $6.5
billion in 1995, according to a Dataquest Taiwan estimate.
That's still only about half of Intel's annual revenue, but
it represents growth of more than 50% over 1994. It is clear
that the island's chip makers are emerging as a force in the
world market. In the next few years, we will be hearing a lot
more from the executives behind these fast-growing companies,
but these execs are not well-known names in U.S. business circles
today.

For that reason, in this first edition of Marketplace Taiwan
for 1996, Electronic Buyers' News has brought together four
executives who are playing major roles in Taiwan's drive to
become a semiconductor production powerhouse: Morris Chang,
Chin Wu, Miin Wu, and D.Y. Yang.

Morris Chang, chairman, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.
Ltd., Vanguard International Semiconductor Corp., and Wyse
Technology Inc.

One of the architects of Taiwan's IC business, Chang has held
many top posts in the island's high-technology companies. He
is currently chairman of three companies: TSMC, the world's
largest wafer foundry company; Vanguard, a dynamic RAM (DRAM)
startup; and Wyse, a supplier of X86-based servers.

Chin Wu, president, Acer Laboratories Inc. (ALI)

ALI, a subsidiary of Acer Inc., is one of Taiwan's largest design
houses, providing core logic, Super I/O, and other products.

Miin Wu, president, Macronix International Co. Ltd.

Macronix is Taiwan's largest supplier of nonvolatile memories,
including flash, EPROMs, and ROMs.

D.Y. Yang, president, Winbond Electronics Corp.

Winbond is Taiwan's largest maker of static RAMs (SRAMs). The
company recently entered a foundry and technology alliance
for DRAMs with Toshiba Corp.

Electronic Buyers' News (EBN): Taiwan's semiconductor industry
is one of the fastest-growing in the world, with somewhere
between 15 and 20 8-in. wafer fabs under construction or in
the planning stage-with most scheduled to come online by 2000.
Are the island's chip makers having any second thoughts about
the world market? Are there concerns about a glut of capacity?

Morris Chang: I'm optimistic about the worldwide chip business.
I believe the world IC market will grow an average of 20% per
year in the next five years, and will reach $300 billion by
the year 2000. While supply will catch up with demand in the
late 1990s, I do not see a capacity glut at that time.

Miin Wu: By the year 2000, compared to 1995, the chip business
will double. The semiconductor demand is very strong because
PC prices are going down fast, and other factors.

D.Y. Yang: In the long run, the chip business will continue
to show strong growth. Some basic drivers will be personal
computers, wireless phones, and all the features that make
the PC user-friendly. The basic issue facing the industry is
supply and demand. The industry has been investing for some
time, but there have been product shortages, thereby causing
prices to stabilize. Suddenly, companies [chip makers] find
themselves very profitable, and then they've tended to increase
investment. So maybe during the next two years we could see
some of this capacity catching up with demand. But in general,
we don't foresee an oversupply.

EBN: Taiwan's semiconductor industry has experienced double
digit growth in recent years, and many analysts expect that
again this year. Can the industry continue to sustain that
pace of growth in 1996 and beyond?

Morris Chang: In recent years, the world IC industry has grown
at a rate of 25% plus per year, and Taiwan's IC industry has
grown at an even higher rate every year. Looking ahead at the
next few years, I think that worldwide IC growth will moderate
to about 20% per year, and Taiwan's growth will be correspondingly
moderate. However, I think Taiwan's IC industry will still
grow faster than the worldwide total, because Taiwan has been
investing more than average, and the availability of talent
at all levels and functions is still greater in Taiwan than
in many other parts of the world.

Chin Wu: For Taiwan's chip makers, it heavily depends on the
PC business, because Taiwan's IC companies supply a lot of
PC-related products, such as SRAMs for core logic. Even [foundry]
TSMC has many PC-related customers who are in the graphics
I/O market and so on. So the outlook for Taiwan's IC industry
seems promising, since the PC market is still showing 20% growth.

Miin Wu: It's going to be difficult to sustain the growth rate
from the last couple of years, but it's difficult to predict
the future. If you look at the total capacity output from Taiwan,
it still has a small part in the world IC market, less than
10% market share. But many Taiwan companies believe they can
have a piece of the pie. That's why there are almost 20 fabs
being built in Taiwan. If you look at these 20 fabs, some companies
are doing foundry. Some companies are doing DRAM. If the market
is big enough to support those companies, everybody will be
successful. If not, this may create a problem.

D.Y. Yang: In Taiwan, there's been a lot of announcements of
new fabs. But basically, those new fabs are foundries. So that
means we have an increase in capacity. However, many of the
U.S. companies are coming to Taiwan and using the foundry capacity
here. We shouldn't be too worried about those new fabs.

EBN: How concerned are Taiwan chip makers about Intel's push
into the motherboard and chip-set business?

Chin Wu: The core-logic market could experience 20% growth,
or just under 30% growth, this year. If Intel takes 50% or
60% of that market, the overall core market is smaller. This
will have a lot of impact on the individual core-logic supplier.
Let's say there's going to be 60 to 70 million PCs shipped
next year. At least 10% of those shipments will be PowerPC
based systems from Apple. We'll still have at least 55 to 60
million sets with an equal number of PC chip sets. No doubt
Intel could get half of those shipments, perhaps a 50% to 60%
market share.

Miin Wu: There may not be a major impact in the long run, because
we are seeing the bigger players dominate the local PC industry.
Smaller companies are dying out, because of cost and quality
factors. In the long run, this will make Taiwan's PC industry
healthier.

D.Y. Yang: Looking at the bigger picture, Intel is doing a favor
for the entire industry by trying to improve the price/performance
of the PC.

Intel is improving the performance while cutting down the cost
of the CPU. Intel's priority is to maintain growth and enlarge
the demand for personal computers. Of course, since they are
a leader, all the players have to watch the leader's behavior
very closely. There's a saying: "If you are dancing with an
elephant, it's your responsibility not to get stepped on."

EBN: Taiwan's electronics business, much like Korea's and Singapore's,
has reached the point where it can no longer compete on low
cost manufacturing. Now it takes real investment in R&D, serious
money, and companies have to compete on technology that they
themselves have developed. Can Taiwan's chip makers compete
on that level against Japanese and U.S. companies?

Morris Chang: Let me limit my answer to Taiwan. In the next
few years, I believe low-cost manufacturing will still be a
key strength of Taiwan. Low-cost manufacturing is very important
in the chip business. It is the ever lower cost per electronic
function that makes Moore's Law a reality.

To develop ever more advanced submicron technology in order
to achieve ever higher performance and lower cost per function,
heavy R&D spending is required, and Taiwan is investing in
that.

Chin Wu: In the past two or three years, Taiwan's design houses
have demonstrated they have the technology to compete in the
worldwide chip-set market. In the graphics controller segment,
S3, Cirrus Logic, and ATI are the leading vendors. But ALI
and SIS [Silicon Integrated Systems Corp.] can make a product
as good or better than the market leaders. What Taiwan's design
houses need to do is to be more involved in talking with U.S.
customers and more involved in associations to find the right
trends.

Miin Wu: To survive in this business in the long run, Taiwan
has to move into more value-added products. At Macronix, we
have a different strategy than other companies in Taiwan: We
want to be a leader in value-added product development. But
it's up to every company to decide what strategy to follow.
If Taiwan companies continue to believe in the manufacturing
or foundry philosophy, then Taiwan will be in trouble later
on. Manufacturing or foundry has a lower barrier to entry in
the semiconductor industry. But China, and most recently Malaysia,
are catching up very quickly in the semiconductor business.
If [China, Malaysia, and other nations] move into the foundry
business, they don't have to worry about product, or even process
technology; the customer provides this. If they want to build
up their volumes, they could someday undercut the prices of
Taiwan's manufacturers.

D.Y. Yang: Taiwan has proven its excellence in manufacturing,
in terms of technology and engineering. For example, we can
improve the yields, and we are also capable in terms of manufacturing
management, that is, cycle time and so on. But there's room
for improvement in design and product development.

There are very few countries-maybe none-that can compete with
the U.S. in that regard. The U.S. is still the leader in developing
digital and information technologies. Our objective is to minimize
the gap, and to try to follow U.S. trends as closely as possible.

EBN: We've seen some chip partnerships between Taiwan and multinational
chip makers, like TI-Acer, Powerchip Semiconductor, TSMC, and
others. Is that kind of partnership business model going to
be necessary for Taiwan semiconductor makers to succeed as
the technology stakes get higher?

Chin Wu: When you advance from 0.5-micron to 0.35-micron and
down to 0.25-micron, you need more and more investment. You
will need certain economies of scale. If you don't have economies
of scale, then you may have to partner with others to offset
some of your risk.

D. Y. Yang: International alliances are a trend in this business,
because of the huge capital investments involved. The requirements
for capital expenditures have increased so fast. So there's
very few companies-maybe only Intel-that are profitable enough
to generate the necessary capital to sustain the growth. Because
we cannot establish the design capabilities in a very short
time, we can move into the industry by doing foundry or forming
a joint venture in DRAMs. You don't need product in these two
businesses. You need capital.

EBN: Should we expect to see Taiwan IC companies investing in
fabs or making acquisitions in the United States in the future,
much like Korean chip makers?

Morris Chang: TSMC is investing in a foundry company in the
U.S. However, I don't see this as a trend yet for Taiwan's
IC industry.

Chin Wu: We haven't seen many successful mergers in the electronics
industry. But I could see more joint ventures developing between
Asian and U.S. or European companies.

Miin Wu: It makes sense to develop some future expansion plan
outside Taiwan. At this point, we'll keep our eyes open, but
we have no firm plans yet.

D.Y. Yang: The Koreans have their own DRAM design and technology.
So they can move their manufacturing to a lower-cost site or
a place to gain market access. We must seriously study the
advantages before we move a fab outside Taiwan. On the other
hand, we may have to look outside Taiwan. Taiwan is perhaps
running into some infrastructure issues-not now, maybe in the
next two, three, or five years. For example, we are running
out of qualified people and engineers. We also have shortages
of water and electricity.

EBN: Singapore's IC industry is tiny but very aggressive right
now, especially in the foundry business. Government there is
putting the infrastructure in place for two or three "fab parks"
that could accommodate 25 to 30 fabs. Do you see Singapore
posing a threat to Taiwan's semiconductor industry?

Chin Wu: First, let me say that Taiwan's success in electronics
is due to several factors. Taiwan has 20 million people. The
people from the operator to the engineer and to the management
have learned through solid education and experience during
the last decade. Also, a lot of Taiwan people who went abroad
to study or work have come back to Taiwan. Most of the people
from Taiwan who went to the U.S. are more technically oriented,
compared to people in Singapore. Singapore is limited in resources
and technical people. They are successful in running corporations
like Chartered [Semiconductor Manufacturing Pte. Ltd.], but
that's small-scale. Up to now, they are only running 20,000
wafers per month. However, the companies in Singapore are well
managed. That is their strength.

Miin Wu: In some areas in the semiconductor industry, Taiwan
companies are better. In other areas, Singapore companies are
better. Over all, Singapore is as good as Taiwan. Also, Singapore
has been known as a financial center, which will attract a
lot of multinational [semiconductor] companies.

Actually, Singapore may be in a better position than Taiwan,
because of its political stability and the freedom of the financial
community. Certainly, I think Singapore will be a threat to
Taiwan. So I think that's another reason why Taiwan has to
move into more value-added products instead of staying on the
manufacturing-only side.

D.Y. Yang: We can't underestimate the aggressiveness of the
Singapore government. The government has been the driving force
behind all the success we've seen in Singapore. I believe they
will become a serious competitor in doing at least the foundry
business. Over all, Singapore may not be a threat, but they
will certainly become a competitor. But Singapore needs to
resolve one issue: Where will the qualified people and engineers
coming from? Even if they hire some people from China, is that
going to be enough to support 30 fabs?

EBN: Taiwan's government has played an important role in the
establishment and growth of the island's semiconductor industry,
both as a financial backer and through organizations like the
Industrial Technology Research Institute and the Electronics
Industry Service Organization. Will ITRI and ERSO continue
to play an important role in the industry's growth? Have your
own views on industrial policy changed over time?

Morris Chang: While ITRI/ERSO played a significant role in Taiwan's
IC development, it has recently shifted its emphasis away from
MOS ICs. The reason is that the private sector is sufficiently
developed and should grow on its own. I don't foresee a major
role for ITRI/ERSO in future MOS IC development.

Chin Wu: In the past, the government has contributed to Taiwan's
success. ITRI/ERSO formed the nucleus of the semiconductor
industry, including TSMC and UMC. The government also established
the Hsinchu Science Park. Now, Taiwan's semiconductor industry
no longer needs a sector like ITRI/ERSO.

Miin Wu: Certainly, Taiwan's semiconductor industry has been
fully supported by the government, and government did an excellent
job in creating this opportunity. It minimized the risk for
the private sector in the beginning, but [the private sector]
has since been able to bring out advanced products and technology.
In the future, ERSO will have a difficult time to position
itself.

D.Y. Yang: I believe Taiwan's IC industry is too big for the
government to support. The industry is capable of being on
its own. ERSO can do some coordination or provide some marketing
information. So that means its role has been reduced, and it
won't play a significant role in the future. ITRI's existence
is due to the weakness of the industry. But the industry is
very strong [now]. In terms of research, some universities
in Taiwan may take over the role of ITRI; it is a self-destructing
institution.

EBN: What are your views on the U.S.-Japan Semiconductor Agreement?
Should it lapse?

Miin Wu: This is difficult to answer, but I believe in free
competition. If every country opens up its market for people
to freely compete, there's no need for any agreements. Right
now, the Japanese believe they are buying enough from overseas,
so there's no need for an agreement. We should look at the
facts, and whether or not Japan is really doing that. If things
go the wrong way and Japan closes its door, then I'm sure the
U.S. government will come back again.

The Next Wave -- A new generation of chip makers targets foundries
and DRAMs to compete with neighbors Korea and Japan

By:
Mark LaPedus

Taiwan's semiconductor industry accounted for a mere 3% of the
world market last year. But while the island's IC entrepreneurs
may not yet pose a threat to Asia's two chip-making powerhouses,
Japan and Korea, it is clear they soon will be a force to reckon
with. The island's semiconductor revenue is expected to reach
$6.5 billion in 1996, a 54.7% jump from 1995, according to
Ben Lee, an analyst with Dataquest Taiwan, Taipei.

The pace of change in the island's IC sector during the past
18 months can only be described as frantic. With startups,
technology alliances, and joint ventures being announced on
a monthly and sometimes weekly basis, U.S. OEMs looking for
opportunities in Taiwan's chip industry need a scorecard just
to keep track of who the players are and who owns what company.

Only 18 months ago, the island's entire IC industry consisted
of eight companies with fabs, plus a dozen or so design houses.
But booming sales in the chip market worldwide, coupled with
readily accessible and affordable capital in Taipei, have led
to the launch over the past year and a half of eight semiconductor
companies with plans to build fabs. Put those new makers' plans
together with expansion at the island's original eight and
you have some 15 to 20 8-in. fabs now being planned for the
near future.

Taiwan's new wave of chip hopefuls is focusing on the two hottest
sectors in the business: dynamic RAMs (DRAMs) and foundry services.
These new contenders, some with little or no experience in
the semiconductor business-one calls itself a "Livestock Corp."
are certainly not household names. Some are a mystery even
to industry analysts who track Asian business. However, they
cannot be ignored.

That's why EBN has prepared its own scorecard-a Directory of
Taiwan's Semiconductor Industry-which follows this introduction.

A thumbnail sketch shows that in 1994, Taiwan's industry consisted
of two DRAM makers-Mosel-Vitelic Inc. and Texas Instruments
Acer Inc., a joint venture between TI and Acer. During the
past 18 months, three more DRAM companies have been launched
 Nan Ya Technology Corp., Powerchip Semiconductor Corp., and
Vanguard International Semiconductor Corp.

Nan Ya's parent company, Nan Ya Plastics Corp., is Taiwan's
largest printed-circuit-board maker, while Powerchip is a joint
venture invested in by Taiwan's Umax Group and Japan's Mitsubishi
Electric Corp. and Kanematsu Corp. A little more than a year
ago, Vanguard was a government-owned R&D facility. The fab
was spun off to become a commercial DRAM maker, thanks in part
to a group of investors led by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing
Co. Ltd. (TSMC)

Two old-timers in Taiwan's IC industry, United Microelectronics
Corp. (UMC) and Winbond Electronics Corp., also plan to jump
into the DRAM business by 1997.

To complicate matters, UMC and several fabless IC houses have
recently announced the launch of three joint-venture companies
in the wafer foundry business: United Semiconductor Corp.,
United Silicon Corp., and a yet-to-be-named foundry.

Another wafer foundry service launched earlier this year is
Asia Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd., not to be confused
with TSMC. The Hsinchu Science-Based Park foundry will operate
an 8-in. wafer fab that is scheduled to start production in
1997.

Perhaps the most bizarre entrant in the chip business this year
is the Chia Hsin Livestock Corp. Little is known about the
company other than the fact its primary investor is Hualon
Microelectronics Corp., a Taiwan IC maker whose parent company
is one of the largest textile concerns on the island.

Buyers sourcing chips in Taiwan are advised to obtain copies
of product guidebooks from local trade associations such as
the Taiwan Electrical and Electronic Manufacturers' Association
(TEEMA), which can be reached by telephone at 886-2-999-2828,
or by fax at 886-2-999-2626, or the Science-Based Industrial
Park Business Directory-tel: 886-35-773-311, fax: 886-35-776

Big Distribs Woo Small Customers -- HH, Others Boost Telesales
Programs

By:
Barbara Jorgensen

Boston - As more business is channeled through distribution
and the big customers continue to get bigger, top-tier distributors
have had to find ways of servicing small customers or risk
losing them to second-tier distributors, catalog houses, and
independents.

Most recently, Avnet Inc. has upgraded a telesales initiative
which includes Hamilton Hallmark Express Service-that began
in 1992. Other distributors with similar programs include Future
Electronics Inc., which launched its Future Active Industrial
(FAI) effort two years ago, and Bell Industries Inc., which
created a telesales/account development program five years
ago. Marshall Industries launched its effort around the same
time.

Centralization efforts in the middle to late 1980s, which pulled
inventory and sales- people into regional "hubs," led to increased
customer traffic at fewer locations and placed tremendous demand
on inside salespeople. The small accounts got poor service
or none at all. One distribution insider recalls faxes constantly
getting misplaced and quotes taking days. And since salespeople
usually are commissioned, large orders received the most attention.

By their own accounts, the efforts of Hamilton Hallmark, Bell,
and Future are working. Avnet telesales is tracking 20,000
incoming calls per week. Bell Industries' account development
program has grown from $8 million in 1991 to $50 million this
year. Although Future declined to disclose sales figures, its
FAI program has grown from 47 to 55 locations and from 400
to 500 FAI account executives in the past year.

Admittedly, these efforts were designed in part to offload traffic
from inside salespeople, but they've also educated distributors
on the small-customer base. For example, instead of the one
piece or two-piece MRO orders Avnet thought could be served
by a catalog, the company discovered otherwise, said Gary Berg,
vice president and national director of telesales.

"At launch [of telesales], we did not distinguish catalog sales
from small customers," he said. "But we didn't get the base
we expected. Instead of one- or two-piece orders, we got customers
with large DTAMs [distribution total available markets] not
doing business with Avnet."

The ultimate goal of these programs is not to hand customers
off-although customers may feel differently-but to dedicate
a group of people taking ownership of "their" customer base.
Each approach is a bit different.

Hamilton Hallmark Express Service and Time Electronics Regional
Support, both of which are under Avnet EMG, are handled by
the same two sites: Tempe, Ariz., and Peabody, Mass. Despite
sharing these resources, Hamilton Hallmark and Time handle
customers differently. While both organizations handle incoming
calls directed to their respective reps, Time's salespeople
are more actively involved in external marketing, including
direct mail followup calls.

Hamilton Hallmark Express Service has grown to become a $75
million operation and generates 500 new or re-emerging accounts
per month. Although average orders are about $361, orders of
up to $50,000 are handled by the operation, said Lloyd Kaplan,
Hamilton Hallmark's senior vice president of marketing.

Sales reps have phone and PC integration. Caller ID shows the
number of the caller, and a window automatically pops on the
PC screen with the caller's sales history, the customer's profile,
account number, notes, address, buyer contacts, and other information.

Incoming calls are automatically routed to the next available
rep, but can also go to a particular rep or product specialist
if the customer prefers. Express Service has approximately
70 sales reps, all handling "generic" calls, although Express
Service is realizing the need to specialize. Supplier representatives,
called supplier advocates, train telesales people to handle
supplier-specific calls. Time's reps receive intensive product
training on its interconnect, passive, and electromechanical
products, said Time president Burt Katz.

Sales reps are salaried, which discourages competition between
Express Service and field salespeople. Bonuses are based on
customer-satisfaction reviews.

Express Service customers needing technical assistance can be
conferenced in to Hamilton Hallmark's Technical Support Center
in Chandler, Ariz. Telesales can also arrange for customers
to be called on by either a technical or field sales rep, although
that customer can still be supported by telesales.

Orders, including parts that are design-registered, are flagged,
and field offices are notified (because design wins are subject
to special relationships with suppliers), as are customers
that a supplier may not sell to. For example, Motorola SPS,
Phoenix, has asked its distributors not to sell to certain
non-OEMs, and incoming calls from those customers are flagged.

In development is a technology to directly route incoming calls
to the last rep to whom a customer spoke. All the information
generated in the telesales database will eventually be downloaded
to a master Customer Contact Database, which will track customer
information and be used, among other things, to generate relevant
information for the distributor and the customer.

Bell Industries realized about five years ago it could not be
all things to all customers, said Bonnie Cunningham, vice president
for account development at the Los Angeles distributor. Bell
constructed its account development program with two goals
in mind: to allow Bell's outside and inside sales forces to
partner on the largest customers, but to also dedicate a group
for which developing customers is the most important goal.
Although customers sometimes are referred to inside or outside
salespeople, Bell reps may stay with a customer no matter how
large the account becomes.

The account development group is located in Bell's Los Angeles
headquarters and acts as an extension of the field sales organization.
Reps have their own geographies and frequently cooperate with
their respective field salespeople. The customer can be serviced
either locally or through Los Angeles, an arrangement generally
transparent to the customer.

Bell maintains that these accounts have the best of both worlds
 regional support plus a toll-free number and the West Coast
time zone. With corporate buyers, product managers, and other
support in Los Angeles, telesales can often get answers more
quickly and with fewer phone calls.

Account development reps are salaried plus commissioned, and
handle both incoming and outgoing sales calls.

Reps are networked with Bell's divisions, and through its Contact
Management software they keep customer records, notes, phone
numbers, and fax numbers in a file that can be accessed by
anyone taking the call. Caller ID is in the works.

Future's FAI program "has had a significant positive impact
on our ability to service our tier-2 and tier-3 customer base,
and our emerging accounts," said E. Stephen Segal, executive
vice president of the Pointe Claire, Quebec, distributor.

FAI began in 1993 and was designed to be more than a telephone
based operation. "Each local division has FAI," Segal explained.
"They are part of the branch but dedicated to that customer
base. People are account executives and visit their customers.
In fact, they are required to do some face-to-face meetings."
This is the key differentiator from other programs, Segal said.

Every North American branch has FAI reps, as do several locations
where Future does not have a branch. Small customers can also
get access to technical support: their FAI rep will "qualify"
them and can recommend support from field application engineers.

Vendors Shun SDRAM 'Lite'

By:
Anthony Cataldo

San Mateo, Calif. - NEC Corp.'s bid to promote a stripped-down
version of the synchronous DRAM is losing support from other
major vendors, which are opting to offer a full-featured SDRAM
instead.

Hitachi Ltd. and Samsung Semiconductor Inc. are among those
that have declined to build the SDRAM lite, which NEC bills
as a low-cost SDRAM solution for PC makers wishing to adopt
synchronous memory technology by early next year.

Conceived as a way to reduce the high test costs associated
with the JEDEC-standard SDRAM, the SDRAM lite uses a subset
of the JEDEC architecture and is compatible with standard DRAM
test equipment and techniques.

Some memory makers expect to rein in test costs during high
volume SDRAM production. "In the long term, there isn't enough
cost difference to justify two types of SDRAMs," said Jim Sogas,
product manager for the Semiconductor & IC Division of Hitachi
America Ltd., Brisbane, Calif. "I think the whole industry
is better served by dropping the concept of a low-calorie SDRAM,
and I think most other manufacturers are coming to the same
conclusion."

NEC has been lobbying other DRAM makers to gain support for
SDRAM lite, which is said to be easier to make than the full
standard SDRAM. "It's a challenging part to make," said Jim
Handy, principal analyst at Dataquest Inc., San Jose. "People
were finding out they could not get [full-standard SDRAM] parts
to yield to such a high clock cycle. [But] those who can field
a fast part don't need the SDRAM-lite spec."

The different SDRAM types should pose no compatibility conflicts
for desktop PCs, although there may be some difficulty in swapping
the two designs for other applications such as set-top boxes
and workstations, said Mark Ellsberry, vice president of marketing
for Samsung, San Jose. "Our part will be fully compatible with
SDRAM lite," he said. But SDRAM lite "won't be fully compatible
with ours because it's a subset of the [JEDEC standard]."

Samsung chose to stick with the full-standard design after concluding
it could eliminate any price premium by the time significant
volume shipments begin in 1997, Ellsberry said. Analysts said
that low yields and the accompanying higher selling prices
have hampered the efforts of other memory makers to lower SDRAM
prices. "We've determined that in the first half of 1996, volume
will still be relatively small," Ellsberry said. "I think we're
going to see some wholesale switches in '97."

But NEC said demand for SDRAMs will crop up earlier, creating
demand for both versions of the part. NEC now offers both SDRAM
versions.

"We think the market is real for SDRAMs before 1997," said Kevin
Krehbiel, DRAM product marketing manager for NEC Electronics
Inc., Mountain View, Calif. "We're trying to reduce costs to
enable price-sensitive markets such as PCs to adopt SDRAMs
as early as possible."

NEC hopes to offer its SDRAM lite for a 5% premium over the
standard DRAM by the first half of 1996, while Samsung is aiming
for an 18% premium for the full SDRAM over the standard DRAM.
Samsung will close that gap further in the second half of 1996
by selling the parts for 8% above standard DRAMs, Ellsberry
said. And by 1997 the parts will be offered with no price penalty
over standard DRAMs, he said.

Sogas said PC makers are also becoming more interested in using
some of the functions removed from the full SDRAM to create
SDRAM lite, such as additional timing variations.

PCBs Face Materials Shortage

By:
Diane Norman

Chicago - Printed-circuit-board manufacturers can expect higher
prices and longer lead times next year for laminates based
on fiberglass, as shortages of the critical material are expected
to worsen.

Even board makers that produce their own laminates will be pinched
by restricted fiberglass supplies, which will worsen when the
market's leading glass manufacturers shut existing furnaces
to perform necessary maintenance.

"The board business is going to be kind of bleak over the next
four or five months," said Robert Herring, president of Herco
Technology Inc., a $48 million board maker in San Diego. "Our
glass suppliers tell us we are only going to be able to get
80% of what we want. Meanwhile, our board business is expanding."

Herco has held the line on board prices even though its material
costs increased 12% this year, Herring said. Other board makers
said they have also kept prices stable because the market is
so competitive and customers strongly resist any increases.

But Advanced Flex Inc., a $30 million printed-circuit-board
maker in Minnetonka, Minn., has told its customers to expect
a price increase after the first of the year. The company did
not provide specifics.

Advanced Flex is quoting lead times of eight weeks, compared
with lead times of four to five weeks that were common earlier
this year. "We've asked our laminate suppliers to increase
our inventory, but they said no, " said general sales manager
Butch Chayer. "If you don't have an alliance or some sort of
agreement with your supplier, you could be in a little trouble."

Resin-coated fiberglass cloths are widely used as laminates
in printed-circuit boards. The leading domestic suppliers of
fiberglass strands-Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corp., Toledo, Ohio,
and PPG Industries, Pittsburgh-have announced plans to close
some of their lines in 1996 to perform routine maintenance,
a process that can close a furnace for two to three months,
analysts said. "They have been milking the [equipment] along,
but now they are at the point where they are going to have
to take some of them down," said Dave Bergman, technical director
of the Institute for Interconnecting and Packaging Electronic
Circuits (IPC), Northbrook, Ill.

Neither glass supplier returned calls for comment last week.

Owens-Corning will spend $105 million over the next three years
in addition to its standard $100 million annual investment
to increase its production of composite materials, but company
chairman Glen H. Hiner warned customers against expecting immediate
additional supplies. "Most of the additional capacity [is]
expected to come on line in 1997," he said.

About 10% of fiberglass material is sold to laminate suppliers
for printed-circuit-board applications, with the remainder
used in other industries.

"There has been incredible demand for fiberglass materials because
the printed-circuit-board market is very strong," Bergman said.
"Demand is higher, not just in the United States, but worldwide."

Printed-circuit-board sales last October increased 18.7% compared
with October 1994, and bookings increased 29.9% for the same
period, according to the IPC. Year-to-date sales had increased
15.8% and bookings were up 21.5%, the trade group reported.

If fiberglass shortages continue, Bergman believes the material
will be placed on allocation next year.

Ed Henderson, president of Henderson Ventures, Los Altos, Calif.,
saidboard customers are not likely to see major price increases
in the first half of 1996, but may see them later. "Manufacturers
are under continued pressure to keep prices elastic, but they
will be pushed to raise prices as materials costs increase,"
he said.

Kalmus & Associates Inc., a $16.8 million printed-circuit-board
maker, has avoided severe delivery problems due to its good
relationships with laminate suppliers, said Hank Kalmus, president
of the Broadview, Ill., company. "We've maintained very long
and important relationships with our laminators, and hope this
will pay back as we go into this period of severe shortages,"
he said.

Kalmus is also looking into composite epoxy materials as an
alternative to fiberglass. Such materials use fewer glass strands
than current eight-ply products and are competitive in price
to fiberglass-based laminates, he said. "The composite materials
are already gaining acceptance in Japan. I think people might
shift over to composites if the shortages become too severe."

AT&T Kills LCD R&D Program

By:
Jack Robertson

Washington - In a double blow to hopes for a U.S. flat-panel
display industry, AT&T has axed any immediate plans for active
matrix LCD production, and Matsushita Electric Industrial Co.
Ltd. of Japan is negotiating to buy Plasmaco Inc., a plasma
display manufacturer in Highland, N.Y.

A spokesman for AT&T Bell Laboratories last week confirmed that
the company's AM-LCD development program was being scrapped.
That effort, along with AT&T's companion FPD packaging program
at Princeton, N.J., had been touted by former Pentagon flat
panel chief Kenneth Flamm as a "manufacturing testbed to allow
a faster startup of production." AT&T is continuing the FPD
packaging efforts.

But the fast production startup won't happen at AT&T anytime
soon, as the company is drastically cutting back to gain a
better financial posture in preparation for its upcoming split
into three companies and subsequent initial public offering,
sources said.

Separately, it was learned that Matsushita was negotiating to
acquire Plasmaco for an unidentified amount. Larry Weber, chief
executive of Plasmaco, was out of his office last week, and
the company's financial officers had not returned calls by
press time.

Matsushita is very interested in Plasmaco's AC plasma-display
technology because its DC plasma display faces strong competition
from NEC Corp. and Fujitsu Ltd., both of which sell displays
that use AC technology. Plasmaco has developed a 21-in. plasma
television screen, and is working on a 30-in. prototype with
1,2801,024 line resolution.

If Plasmaco were acquired, it is uncertain if Matsushita would
retain the operation at its present site, consolidate it with
other Matsushita facilities in the United States, or transfer
the technology back to Japan for future production.

An AT&T decision against AM-LCD production closes the door on
one of U.S. industry's best hopes for a giant electronics company
to jump into the market. The Defense Department's Advanced
Research Projects Agency (ARPA) earlier awarded $50 million
to a joint venture of AT&T, Xerox, and Standish Industries
to set up a "manufacturing testbed" in the hope it would be
expanded to full-scale production.

The AT&T Bell Labs AM-LCD development program was also expected
to funnel technology into an anticipated production operation.
Until this fall the research program had a 'dotted line' reporting
connection to Richard Archambault, AT&T's vice president of
high-resolution technologies in manufacturing.

Mark Hartney, ARPA director of High-Definition Display Programs,
is hopeful the preliminary production data gathered at the
testbed could help other potential U.S.-based AM-LCD manufacturers.

The ARPA-funded joint venture work continues with limited screen
assembly at Princeton, where AT&T packages AM-LCD panels made
by Xerox Corp.'s Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) and Standish
Industries into final products. AT&T wants to expand its FPD
contract assembly operation if it can secure work from other
panel fabricators, sources said.

With AT&T's dropout, sources said Xerox may expand into some
initial production using leading-edge AM-LCD technology at
PARC. Xerox has studied the possibility of producing high-performance,
high-resolution displays for document reading, map displays,
and medical imaging, said Malcolm Thomson, PARC's chief technologist.

A few U.S. suppliers build limited quantities of conventional
AM-LCDs for the military and avionics markets. The pending
purchase of Plasmaco by Matsushita would further curtail U.S.
hopes of penetrating the global FPD market. Plasmaco reported
revenue of $800,000 in 1994, down 20% from $1 million the previous
year. Plasmaco was founded in 1987 and acquired plasma-display
production equipment and technology from IBM Corp. It had hoped
to sell displays back to IBM, but the computer maker chose
Matsushita to supply plasma panels for its early laptop computers.

A Closer Look: The Year 2000 Doesn't Compute

By:
Jack Robertson

Washington - Just as you are recovering from the New Year's
celebration, here's a new hangover headache for you:

When the Times Square sphere falls four years from now, it could
usher in more than a new century. At the stroke of midnight,
billions of lines of computer code could go haywire, unless
corrected.

While humans are putting up a new-century calendar page, computers
will be internally clicking to a new "00" annual date. But
unless they are told otherwise, computers see "00" as the year
1900, not the dawn of a new millennium.

That's not a problem for newer PCs, servers, and mainframes
running programs written in the last several years. The "00"
time bomb is ticking away in mountains of old 8-bit and 16
bit spreadsheet programs and countless antiquated applications
that are still running on even the most modern PCs. The "00"
fuse is even shorter for tons of old COBOL and mainframe software
still chugging away.

In recent years, software developers foresaw the Year 2000 snafu
and adjusted code to reflect the 21st century. But even if
modern operating software has corrected the Year 2000 wipeout,
untold storage vaults of critical archival data with unmodified
"00" code are out there waiting to corrupt or crash programs.

These programs were written so long ago that developers considered
2000 as distant science fiction. Memory was tight in those
days (if you can believe it), and abbreviating the year to
only two digits in computer code seemed an ideal solution.

John Phelps, a consultant with The Gartner Group, said software
fixes to the Year 2000 blowup are simple enough. "The real
crisis is finding the code that must be fixed," he said. With
new client-server interrelated networks, vulnerable code can
be lurking almost anywhere in the system.

Some systems will be immune, and the witching hour for old Unix
based software isn't 2000 but 2036. Like most computer code,
Unix keeps track of time by the number of seconds that have
elapsed since a baseline date was established for the system.
Unix operating software will keep ticking away until 2036,
when the timing word length runs out of bits to account for
the number of seconds from the original baseline date. But
aside from these systems, a good number of miscounting systems
must still be accounted for.

No, it's not Stanley Kubrick's 2001 computer time warp that
should rivet our attention. It's the warped "00" time hacks
of the past that haunt us. Unless corrected, on Jan. 1, 2000,
some computer programs aren't going to be as up to date as
our futurists proclaim.

Blue Christmas For 800 At Augat

By:
Bettyann Liotta

New York - Holiday spirits were crushed at Augat Inc. when the
company said it would eliminate up to 800 jobs by consolidating
manufacturing operations at its Interconnection Products Division
(IPD) and Automotive Division to improve the profitability
of those units.

Augat, Mansfield, Mass., said the restructuring would be completed
by the end of 1996. The company also said it is exiting the
market for low-margin commodity IC sockets. Augat's results
for the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, 1995, will include charges
totaling $23 million related to the consolidations and its
exit from the socket market.

To reach its $1 billion sales goal by2000, Augat wants to change
its sales mix. The company reported sales of $531 million in
fiscal 1994 and currently derives 40% to 45% of revenue from
its automotive division, about 27% from the Communications
Products Business Division, and about 28% to 33% from IPD.

In the future, Augat wants to obtain 50% of its sales from its
communications division-which sells coaxial, fiber-optic, and
broadband products-with the remaining sales split between automotive
and IPD, according to Ellen B. Richstone, chief financial officer
for Augat.

"The communications division will grow at a very fast rate,
and we will continue to grow, albeit slower, the IPD and automotive
divisions," she said. "All three divisions [will be] focused
on moving up the technology chain, providing more value-added
and increased global penetration."

Augat will transfer IC socket production from its facility in
Mashpee, Mass., to operations in Sanford, Maine, and Lugano,
Switzerland. The Mashpee plant will close by September 1996.
"[IPD] will focus on existing product lines, including terminal
blocks, switches, miniaturized connectors, and customized sockets,"
Richstone said. "We are only exiting the low-margin commodity
socket lines that are available from many other companies."

Automotive division operations in Montgomery, Ala., will be
closed by the end of this year. Those production lines will
be transferred primarily to Mexico, with some moving to Detroit.

About 800 workers will be affected by the company's decision
to shut these locations, but Augat's head count will only decline
by 100 since the company will add workers at its other facilities,
Richstone said. Though some workers will be offered relocation
positions, Richstone said she would be surprised if 50 to 75
workers out of the 800 actually moved.

Augat's restructuring follows disappointing financial results
for the third quarter of 1995. Net income fell to $4.2 million
in that quarter from $6.4 million in the prior year's third
quarter. Sales for the quarter were $132 million compared with
$128 million for the year-ago quarter. The company blamed the
results on "weakness" in its automotive business, which sells
custom automotive electrical power distribution systems and
interconnect products.

Augat also noted that sales for the IPD demonstrated real growth
and improved performance in the quarter vs. the prior year's
quarter. IPD's sales had increased 12% from $31.6 million to
$35.3 million during the third quarter. While the company said
it was pleased with the division's progress, it was not yet
performing at its long-term targets, which includes operating
profits of 10% vs. 2% at present.

"Next year, including restructuring benefits, we expect sales
to grow 10% to 14%, and net income to grow roughly 30% before
the restructuring. Most of the benefits from the restructuring
won't be seen until 1997," she said.

In a separate move, Augat said it would acquire certain assets
of Lindsay Specialty Products, a supplier of RF distribution
products. Located in Lindsay, Canada, Lindsay Specialty Products
sells to the CATV, wired communications, and wireless industries.

Powell Names New President

By:
Diane Norman

Chicago - Powell Electronics Inc. has selected Ernest Schilling
as its new president. He will replace Millard Brown II, who
will resign his post effective Feb. 15.

Schilling, who has been with the company for 27 years, currently
serves as senior vice president of Powell's Midwest division.
As president, he will report to founder and chairman Harold
Powell.

No major changes in the Philadelphia company's direction are
expected, Schilling said. "My objective will be to play a significant
role in the art of distribution in its traditional, classic
form," he said. "We will pay attention to sales and marketing,
line cards, and customer penetration."

The value-added distributor of connectors, switches, and other
electromechanical components is projecting sales of $70 million
in 1995, and 15% growth in 1996. "Some adjustments will be
looked at," Schilling said. "We have some areas that are more
dynamic than others."

Brown has been president of Powell since 1991. He directed a
successful re-engineering of the company's internal, external,
and international operations. Brown will remain on Powell's
board while pursuing other interests and opportunities.

Cirrus Reports Clouds In 3rd Qtr. -- Earnings, Revenue Below
Expectations

By:
Jonathan Cassell

San Mateo, Calif. - Cirrus Logic Inc. last week said results
for its third quarter will be hurt by slowness in the home
computer and Taiwan PC markets, news that cast a cloud over
a new manufacturing relationship with Digital Equipment Corp
(DEC)

Cirrus said earnings for the third fiscal quarter ended Dec.
30 will be 13 cents to 19 cents per share, and revenue will
be between $290 million and $300 million, well below some Wall
Street predictions of 41 cents per share in earnings and $330
million in revenue.

This marks the second time Cirrus has lowered expectations for
its third quarter, following an announcement in November that
the company's earnings would be affected by a reduced order
from a large customer. Analysts have identified that customer
as Packard Bell, a major buyer of Intel Corp. motherboards
containing Cirrus graphics chips. This time, Cirrus blamed
the poor results on slower than anticipated growth in the home
PC market and the somewhat related softness in its Taiwan business,
which combined to reduce demand for the company's graphics,
audio, and modem products.

Sales of audio and graphics chips declined, while growth in
revenue from Cirrus' modem business did not meet expectations,
said George Alexy, senior vice president of marketing for Cirrus,
Fremont, Calif. Meanwhile, Cirrus' sales of PC products not
directly targeted at home systems-such as mass storage-grew
in the third quarter, Alexy said.

Analysts don't believe Cirrus' results reflect a weakness in
the home PC market.

"The home PC market is not weak, but it may be softer than expected,"
said Drew Peck, analyst with Cowen & Co., Boston. "What's hurting
Cirrus is an industrywide problem of high inventories for PC
products due to summer's huge order activity. The other issue
is that Cirrus is in the midst of a transition between its
first-generation 64-bit graphics controllers, which are getting
long in the tooth, and its second-generation controllers."

Peck said the Taiwan market has become important to Cirrus because
it is trying to dispose of its older 64-bit graphics controllers
there.

The downbeat earnings news came just one week after Cirrus added
DEC to a growing list of manufacturers that the company has
partnered with in a $2 billion, five-year effort to increase
ownership of its production resources. Under terms of the agreement,
which still awaits approval, Cirrus will provide to DEC about
$355 million worth of equipment that will be used in DEC's
8-in. wafer Fab 6 in Hudson, Mass.

In October, Cirrus revealed pacts with a group of semiconductor
manufacturers, including AT&T Microelectronics and Taiwan Semiconductor
Manufacturing Co., as well as the expansion of its relationship
with IBM Microelectronics.

Alexy said third-quarter results will not harm its manufacturing
partnership plan, but will let Cirrus cut costs and offset
that period's poor earnings.

"We were able to make modifications in our capacity investment
program that reduced forecasted cash use by $600 million over
the next five years without [affecting] the program," Alexy
said. "DEC was expected to be a joint venture. But it hasn't
ended up [that way], so we can reduce our cash requirements
to the tune of $100 million."

Alexy said Cirrus also lowered projected expenditures by $500
million in a manufacturing deal with another partner-cutting
expenses over the next five years by $600 million.

AMD, Cyruix Have X86 Shot At Intel

By:
Jonathan Cassell

San Mateo, Calif. - Despite announcements from Advanced Micro
Devices Inc. and Cyrix Corp. that fourth-quarter results will
be hurt by a declining 486 market, analysts and industry observers
said the two companies are likely to re-emerge soon as viable
competitors to Intel Corp. in the X86 business.

AMD, Sunnyvale, Calif., said it expects earnings for the fourth
quarter to be below those in the third, due to lower-than-expected
shipments of 486 microprocessors.The company's revenue will
rise for the quarter, but not enough to offset depreciation
and startup costs from AMD's new Fab 25 in Austin, Texas, said
W.J. Sanders III, chairman and chief executive.

Cyrix announced it will report a loss in the fourth quarter
due to poor prices in the 486 market and a write-off of inventory
of that microprocessor, despite the company's long-planned
move to exit the 486 business. The loss-the first in Cyrix's
history-will cause the company to default on some repayments
of debts to creditors, according to Jerry Rogers, president
and chief executive of Cyrix, Richardson, Texas.

Meanwhile, as AMD and Cyrix struggle, X86 leader Intel is continuing
to hit the jackpot, with the company expected to report record
earnings for the fourth quarter, according to Alex. Brown &
Sons Inc., San Francisco.

Analysts said AMD and Cyrix's problems are a result of Intel
using its prodigious manufacturing might to reduce microprocessor
prices and rapidly transition the market to the Pentium and
away from the 486.

"Intel changed the rules of the game in 1995 by accelerating
Moore's law," said John Marren, an analyst with Alex. Brown
& Sons. "Intel now can deliver doubled performance every year,
instead of every 18 months. It has made it difficult for other
suppliers, as Intel has driven the margins out of the 486 business.
It's a real scorched-earth strategy."

In the past, AMD and Cyrix were able to carve out a market niche
simply by offering lower-performance products that undercut
Intel's pricing, said Nathan Brookwood, an analyst for Dataquest
Inc., San Jose. However, companies who want to compete in the
X86 market must offer an equivalent or higher-performing microprocessor
that costs about the same as what Intel offers, Brookwood said.

"There are a lot of companies out there that will buy from an
Intel competitor, if they can deliver a working product," Brookwood
said. "The challenge for AMD, Cyrix, and others is to deliver
a product that gives their customers a competitive advantage."

Using this strategy, non-Intel X86 vendors still have the opportunity
to claim from 10% to 25% of the market in the future, he estimated.

Analysts said Cyrix is the first company that is likely to make
a comeback in the X86 market as it ramps production of its
6x86 microprocessor in 1996. Cyrix's new 120-MHz 6X86, which
analysts view as a Pentium-class microprocessor because of
its Pentium-style pinout, is expected to outperform Intel's
upcoming 150-MHz Pentium, according to Steve Tobak, vice president
of corporate marketing for Cyrix.

Cyrix will begin volume shipment of the 6X86 in the first quarter
and could ship as many as 200,000 units during that time, Tobak
said. Tobak said Cyrix is targeting shipment of 2 million to
3 million 6X86 microprocessors in 1996.

Analysts said Cyrix's main challenge in the short term will
be moving mass production of the 6X86 to a smaller die. Cyrix
already has converted all production of the 6X86 performed
by its manufacturing partner IBM to a smaller, five-layer-metal
die that is 50% smaller and far less expensive to manufacture
than before, according to the company. Tobak said he was confident
that Cyrix's second manufacturer, SGS-Thomson, will be able
to begin volume production of the die-shrunk 6X86 in the second
quarter of 1996.

AMD can still be a viable player in the Pentium Pro-class market
in 1997 if it successfully completes its acquisition of NexGen
Inc. and completes development of its K6 microprocessor, Brookwood
said. Analysts agreed that the Nx586 AMD obtained from its
acquisition of Nexgen and its own K5 microprocessor-which will
be introduced in 1996-are unlikely to be high-volume products.
The K6, really a rebadged NexGen NX686, will offer the performance
advantage over Pentium Pro that an X86 competitor needs to
compete with Intel, Brookwood said.

Chips Galore At Vegas CES

By:
Mark Hachman

San Mateo, Calif. - Chip makers won't be left out in the cold
this week at the winter Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas.
Not only are semiconductor manufacturers the star players in
a host of end products, but the show has become the spot to
discover the next killer application.

A recent study conducted by International Data Corp., Framingham,
Mass., and Semico Research, Phoenix, found that 15.2% of 1995's
$147 billion worldwide semiconductor market will be used in
consumer applications.

"I think it's right to say that due to the increasing value
of semiconductor content in products such as those featured
at the [CES] show, more semiconductor manufacturers find it
important to attend," said Todd Mozer, president of Sensory
Circuits Inc., San Jose. Indeed, Sensory's voice-recognition
chip-called Voice Password-has been designed into the products
of at least four attendees of the show. Voice Password's recognition
algorithm can be limited to a unique voice, making it suitable
for security applications. Sensory is not displaying products
on the show floor, but potential customers can see demonstrations
in an off-site hospitality suite.

Representatives of Samsung Semiconductor Inc. are attending
the show "to find out what people are doing," said John Weekley,
associate director of microproducts marketing for the San Jose
company. "The whole consumer electronics market has become
so semiconductor-oriented that we can't figure out all the
uses for something like an LCD or a microcontroller," Weekley
said.

Last year's consumer electronics sales-from electronic typewriters
to personal copiers-totaled over $55 billion, said Joseph P.
Clayton, executive vice president of marketing and sales for
the Americas and Asian/Pacific regions of Thomson Consumer
Electronics, and chairman of the Consumer Electronics Manufacturing
Association (CEMA) Board of Directors and Executive Committee,
Arlington, Va.

However, increasing integration has produced lowered costs.
"While other products on the Consumer Price Index have escalated
in cost [by more than] 45% since 1984, consumer electronics
prices continue to decline. A color TV, which had an average
retail price of $430 10 years ago, now carries a suggested
retail price of $350-a decrease exceeding 22%," Clayton said
in a recent CEMA report.

AT&T Microelectronics hopes to make a splash at the show by
introducing digital signal processors for the first all-digital
speakerphones with built-in answering systems. AT&T will demonstrate
its DSPhone digital speakerphone and FlashTAD telephone-answering
device ICs. Both the LJ30 NAND FlashTAD subsystem and the LF30
NAND FlashTAD with DSPhone incorporate AT&T's DSP1605 device.
The LJ30, however, provides functionality for all-digital answering
systems, while the LF30 is designed for digital answering systems
with integrated acoustic-echo-canceling speakerphone.

The LJ30 is the first DSP that manages the use of both NAND
and NOR flash memory devices, according to an AT&T spokesman.
Voice prompts and messages can be stored in the flash memory
of both subsystems, eliminating the need for OGM chips, analog
speakerphone ICs, dual-tone multiple frequency receiver ICs,
and voice synthesis ICs, and reducing system costs for OEMs.
The DSPs are offered in a 68-pin PLCC or 80-pin MQFP, and cost
less than $8.50 in quantities of 100,000.

Zilog Corp. is aiming to take a big bite out of the market for
digital telephone answering devices (DTADs) as that business
builds volume in 1996. The Campbell, Calif., microcontroller
maker will show at CES this week its new generation of DTAD
controllers, the Z89175 and Z89176.

Building market share in the DTAD business will depend on providing
OEMs with a cost structure that will allow them to compete
with the rock-bottom prices of tape-based answering machines,
said Philip Levine, Zilog's tactical marketing manager for
DTAD products. "The other half of that equation is to add features
and improve voice quality at the same time you cut prices,"
he added. Zilog says its Z89175 solution will allow OEMs to
achieve a $29.95 retail price.

The Z89175 and Z89176 offer a single chip plus memory solution
with recording times of six to 10 minutes; enhanced voice quality
from the previous-generation Z89165 solution; multiple memory
support of ARAM or flash memory devices; and caller ID.

"Perception is the problem in moving consumers from tape-based
answering machines to digital machines," said Gerry Kaufhold,
vice president of ThorKa Research, Dayton, Ohio. "You can go
out and buy a tape machine that gives you 15 minutes or more
of message time for $19.95. Add a cassette player and you get
30 minutes. But to do that with a digital telephone answering
machine, you're talking about $100 or more-so the price barrier
remains a problem."

The Z89175 and Z89176 are sampling and will be available in
volume before the end of this year's first quarter, said Alan
Zhu, technical marketing manager of DTAD products at Zilog.
Zhu said pricing will depend on order size, but that a good
rule of thumb would be $6.30 each in quantities of 50,000.

IDT In S. Korean SRAM Partnership

By:
Mark LaPedus

Taipei, Taiwan - Integrated Device Technology Inc. has formed
an alliance with a little-known South Korean company, the Iljin
Group, which will use IDT's technology to enter the SRAM business
next year.

Under terms of the deal, IDT, Santa Clara, Calif., will license
its SRAM, RISC-based processor, and other IC designs to Iljin,
a maker of aluminum, cable, and various telecommunications
products that hopes to follow in the footsteps of Korea's three
IC giants: Hyundai Electronics Co., LG Semicon Inc. (formerly
GoldStar), and Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd.

To do so, Iljin has licensed IDT's CMOS process technology,
and will use it to build an 8-in. wafer fab in Suwon, Korea.
The fab, to begin production by the third quarter of 1997,
will be capable of making 15,000 wafers per month. The initial
cost of the fab is about $777.6 million.

The move represents Iljin's entry into the semiconductor business,
according to S.K. Park, manager of strategic planning for the
Seoul concern, a 20-year-old company with revenue of about
$640 million last year. "We are scheduled to break ground on
the fab in March [of 1996]," Park said. "As for the alliance
with IDT, we have the option to license any products from IDT's
portfolio within the next year."

He declined to elaborate on Iljin's future product plans or
timetables, but sources indicated the company has the rights
to license IDT's SRAM lines, including its high-speed, synchronous
products. Reports also surfaced that Iljin could license IDT's
RISC-based processor line built around the technology licensed
from Mips Technologies Inc.

In the meantime, IDT will begin the technology transfer process
after it completes the deal with Iljin by the end of January.
Additionally, IDT will provide technical training and support
to Iljin employees, primarily in the U.S. company's new wafer
fab in Hillsboro, Ore., the companies said.

Iljin, which has no experience in the chip business, in early
1995 formed a team to find a suitable partner to propel it
into the IC business.

"We are pleased that Iljin selected IDT as its source for process
and product technology," said Len Perham, IDT's president and
chief executive. In return, IDT will be able to expand its
SRAM capacity in the long term, and possibly get a stronger
foothold in the Korean semiconductor market, analysts said.

Iljin's move into the IC business was viewed by analysts as
somewhat unusual, in that Korea's semiconductor industry is
dominated by three large conglomerates, or chaebols: Hyundai,
LG, and Samsung.

However, there appears to be a change in Korea's corporate culture,
as other, smaller concerns are also looking at the IC business.

In fact, Korea's total IC production is expected to jump from
$13.6 billion in 1995 to $21 billion to $22 billion in 1996,
a 38.2% growth rate, said Jonathan Dutton, senior analyst with
S.G. Warburg Securities Ltd., Seoul.

Still, Iljin faces an uphill battle in the IC market, he added.
Aside from no experience in the IC business, Iljin hopes to
move into the SRAM and other markets amid stiff competition
from several companies, including Samsung. Prices for SRAMs
are also expected to tumble this year. Reports surfaced in
Taiwan last week that 1-Mbit SRAM products could drop to as
low as $7 per unit next month.

Relays To Get Mil-Spec Quality

By:
Diane Norman

Chicago - Two relay manufacturers expect to have their lines
fully qualified to military specifications by the end of the
year, offering relief to buyers plagued by long lead times
for the last 12 months.

Magnecraft/Struthers Dunn (MSD), Darlington, S.C., will have
some relays qualified to MIL-R-83536 in late March, and Communications
Instruments Inc., Fairview, N.C., will have a complete line
of MIL-R-39016 and MIL-R-28776 relays qualified in the first
half of this year. Communications Instruments is already shipping
some MIL-R-39016 relays.

The companies are trying to pick up the pieces of the market
dropped by Struthers Dunn/Hi-G after it ran into testing problems
and economic difficulties that forced it to close in June 1994.
The military relay market has fought long lead times since
that supplier's unceremonious exit. "We created a real void
in the marketplace," said Bruce Armstrong, former general manager
of Struthers Dunn/Hi-G. "There is a real demand from buyers
for mil-spec relays."

Last February, Magnecraft Electric Co. purchased the medium
power relay line once built by Struthers Dunn to MIL-R-83536
specifications. Communication Instruments last year purchased
the MIL-R-39016 and MIL-R-28776 low-level switching signal
relays formerly built by Hi-G.

The merged Struthers Dunn/Hi-G voluntarily suspended shipments
of some military relays in 1991 because the devices did not
meet government testing requirements. Though it resumed shipments
in 1992, the company never fully recovered from that setback.

Military products must be requalified when they change ownership
or when their production is moved to a new location. The relays
now in the hands of MSD were never a part of their previous
owner's voluntary suspension.

MSD plans to have its 2-pole, 10-amp, and 4-pole, 10-A medium
power relays qualified in late March. Other MIL-R-83536 parts
will be qualified by the end of the year, said Armstrong, who
is now national sales manager of MSD.

MSD is already shipping noncertified relays for high-reliability
applications. "Our catalog [nonqualified] parts are built on
the same production lines and meet the same [MIL-R-83536] specifications,"
Armstrong said.

Communication Instruments is quoting 26-week to 30-week lead
times today for its mil-spec relays, which are comparable to
the lead times of other suppliers of the same parts, the company
said. The supplier will qualify the rest of its relays in the
first half of the year, and it expects to reduce its lead times
to 16 weeks to 18 weeks by midyear. It currently offers nonqualified
versions of relays that conform to the military specifications,
the company said.

The market will benefit from newly qualified suppliers, said
Jim Bedell, director of marketing for Deutsch Relays Inc.,
East Northport, N.Y., a competing military relay supplier.
Deutsch is now quoting 22-week lead times, and is working to
reduce them further from a high of 28 weeks at the beginning
of last year.

"At first there wasn't a big reaction when Struthers Dunn/Hi
G closed, but then reality kicked in," Bedell said. "When we
saw what was happening, we ramped up production and now are
running two shifts, six days a week."

The market for military power relays is growing between 4% and
5% a year, Armstrong said. "For us, the big challenge is to
recapture market share."

The company is working on a "re-entry strategy" that includes
maintaining profit margins while qualifying the relay products,
targeting catalog sales as well as military sales, and operating
with a smaller sales network, Armstrong said.

MSD has cut its distributor lineup from 10 to five regional
companies and has also eliminated its direct sales force. "We
want to keep things simple with a low overhead," Armstrong
said. "We want to be the low-cost producer of military relays."

Corrections



 Volume production of NEC Electronics Inc.'s 8-Mbit Rambus DRAMs
is scheduled to begin in the second quarter of 1996. The date
listed in the Dec. 11 issue was incorrect.

 A story in the Dec. 18 issue should have said that Nu Horizons
Electronics Corp. has one field applications engineer for every
six outside salespeople.

 Samtec Inc.'s CLS series socket strips are priced at 3.5 cents
per line. The price listed in the Nov. 20 issue was incorrect.

 The Top Components Suppliers supplement in the Nov. 6 issue
should have listed Nichicon America Corp. as a capacitor maker.

Heard: Samsung Plans China Fab



Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd. will build a wafer fab in Suzhou,
China, at the site of the company's previously announced IC
assembly and test facility. The plant will initially assemble
nonmemory products when it begins operations this summer, and
will be expanded into a wafer fab 12 to 18 months later, said
Steven Yu, senior manager of Samsung's Asia-Pacific subsidiary
in Hong Kong. "We will begin with production of memories,"
he said. The operation will be 100%-owned by Samsung, and will
involve no funding from the Chinese government or another partner.

Heard: Shift To Plastic Packages Spells Woe For Alcoa



In a piece of good news for electronics purchasers and bad news
for Alcoa Electronics Packaging Inc., Intel Corp. said it will
migrate the majority of its microprocessor product line from
ceramic to plastic packages. By moving to plastic, Intel will
spend $29.50 less on each microprocessor and be able to reduce
the cost of the products, an Intel spokesman said. As much
as 80% of Intel's microprocessors are now packaged in ceramic.
The move to plastic was made possible by the superb heat and
power dissipation characteristics of Intel's 0.35-micron process,
the spokesman said. Alcoa will lay off 1,200 workers at its
facility in San Diego because Intel will not be ordering any
more ceramic packages from the company.-J.C.

Bell Industries Inc. may be getting ready to climb back on the
acquisition horse. Bell, Los Angeles, has filed documents with
the Securities and Exchange Commission relating to 500,000
shares of common stock that Bell may offer or issue in exchange
for shares of capital stock or other assets in future acquisitions.

Bell made it clear last year that it intended to pursue growth
by acquisition after its offer to merge with Sterling Electronics,
Houston, was rebuffed in September. Although the merger was
generally viewed favorably by analysts, Sterling opted to remain
solo and took measures to protect itself from possible future
takeovers.

After five years of declines, consumer electronics output will
increase in Japan in 1996 due to the creation of new products
such as car navigation systems and other digital devices, according
to the Electronic Industries Association of Japan, which represents
600 companies.

Total production of electronics in 1996 will be 23.68 trillion
yen ($234 billion), up 5.7% over a projected 22.413 trillion
yen this year. Leading the way will be higher production of
semiconductors and components to fuel booming worldwide demand
for chips from makers of computers and mobile phones.-M.L.

Bottom Line: Cherry 3Q Earnings Decline


While Cherry Corp.'s third- quarter sales grew 17% to $107.2
million, earnings declined to $3.1 million, compared with $4.3
million a year ago. Nine-month earnings for the period ended
Nov. 30 were $8.9 million on sales of $314.7 million. That
compared with nine-month earnings of $9.9 million and sales
of $245.4 million last year. The Waukegan, Ill., company attributed
the third-quarter earnings decline to continuing high production

Some Sectors Have Urge To Merge

By:
Ismini Scouras

New York - Increased consolidation in major segments of the
electronics industry will continue this year-with activity
coming from many sectors, including distribution, software,
and telecommunications, industry analysts said.

Additional mergers and acquisitions (M&As) among electronics
distributors should come as no surprise, since consolidation
has been occurring in that sector for more than three years,
said Clarke Walser, principal of Walser & Associates, Chicago.
The most recent deals include specialty distributor Richey
Electronics Inc.'s acquisition of Deanco Inc., and All American
Semiconductor Inc.'s acquisitions of Added Value Electronic
Distribution Inc. and A.V.E.D.-Rocky Mountain Inc. Global distributor
Avnet Inc. intends to add more companies to its list of acquisitions
in its 1996 fiscal year; in the United States alone, Avnet
acquired Penstock, Avnet Cable Technologies, and Sertek in
fiscal 1995.

The forces moving the distribution industry toward consolidation
cutting costs and providing value-added services for the customer
and supplier-are as strong as ever. "The economies of scale
that we've seen over Arrow's acquisitions in the last few years
suggest there are operating-efficiency advantages by intelligent
merger and acquisitions," Walser said.

But some OEMs wonder whether combined companies can operate
as efficiently as they did before they consummated, Walser
said. "We've seen cases where the merger of two distributors
has caused customers to find another source of supply," Walser
said, pointing to the Hamilton Hallmark and Avnet marriage.
"During the transition period, there's concern over loss of
supply."

Although some M&As are not successful, high-tech companies join
hands in hopes that theirs will be. In fact, 1995 was a blockbuster
year for M&As in the information technology (IT) industry.
Deals in that sector exceeded 1,400, compared with 750 in 1994,
said Janet Swift, director of marketing at Broadview Associates
L.P., a Fort Lee, N.J., M&A advisory firm that focuses on information
technology.

As the entire IT market gets more competitive and product cycles
shrink, many companies are looking to establish market dominance
sooner, said Larry Lenihan, principal with Broadview. Therefore,
the ability for an IT company to fund or compete purely on
internal development is nearly impossible, Lenihan noted. "You're
seeing a lot of technology companies looking to acquire hot
technology and product diversification where they can expand
the use of their infrastructure and channel mass," he said.

M&As in the electronics industry this year will be more actively
pursued by software product and services companies and telecommunications
concerns than by hardware firms, according to Broadview Associates'
study of U.S. companies.

Of the 150 U.S. IT companies surveyed for the Broadview study,
64% are "very likely" to pursue M&As this year. Roughly one
third of the software and telecom companies questioned reported
they are "more likely" to aim for M&A activity in the next
12 months than in 1995. Software has traditionally led the
number of deals that are done in IT; telecom is now close behind,
Lenihan said. "In telecom, you've been seeing the concept of
mass and getting big to compete, and infrastructure has been
key. Smaller vendors really can't compete, so they're being
bought out and we're going to see that market concentrating
especially Internet service providers, where there will only
be a handful left," Lenihan said.

While the number of Internet service providers dwindles, the
number of vendors that provide the channel to get to the Internet
keeps growing. An increasing number of companies, such as Hewlett
Packard and Fujitsu, have jumped into the PC scene, making
product differentiation more difficult.

Analysts said that consolidation in the PC industry is highly
unlikely, but if one company were to be acquired, Apple Computer
Inc. would be the most likely. "Apple makes an attractive target,
not only for its installed base but also for its technology,"
Lenihan said. In addition to interesting software technology,
Apple has a strong presence in unique markets, which the other
traditional hardware PC companies don't have, Lenihan added.

Although the PC industry will not see any major strategic deals,
cash-strapped companies may continue to sell themselves to
foreign competitors that are looking to enter the U.S. market,
Lenihan said. An example of that this past year was the AST
Research/Samsung deal, in which Samsung acquired 40% of AST.

Since the top dozen PC players account for more than 55% of
the worldwide market-with scores of other PC companies following
behind-it isn't unusual to believe that consolidation should
occur, said Richard Chu, managing director with Cowen & Co.,
Boston. "The fact is that the industry's conditions have been
reasonably benign; there has not been any economic pressure
for consolidation in the past year," Chu said.

The semiconductor industry should not experience any more M&A
action this year than it did last, analysts said. The most
notable deal was Advanced Micro Devices Inc.'s acquisition
of NexGen Inc., to build muscle against Intel Corp. "As far
as seeing other high-profile public acquisitions like we saw
with AMD and NexGen, it's hard to say-those are harder to accomplish,"
said Mark Edelstone, senior semiconductor analyst at Prudential
Securities Research, San Francisco. "The dynamics in the industry
would have to change before you see a lot of M&A activity."

Lenihan foresees M&As occurring with specialized semiconductor
companies. There have been several public specialized semiconductor
companies acquiring private companies-such as Exar Corp.'s
acquisition of Startech Semiconductor Inc. and Oak Technology
Inc.'s acquisition of Pixel Magic-which the industry could
see more of, Edelstone said.

Stockholder Lawsuit Bill OK'd

By:
Jack Robertson

Washington - Industry executives rejoiced last week as Congress
overrode President Clinton's veto of legislation curbing stockholder
class-action lawsuits based on financial projections.

The bill, which goes into law this week, protects companies
from liability concerning earnings and sales projections as
long as they are accompanied by a warning about factors that
might upset the predictions. It would also reduce the statute
of limitations for such suits to three years from the current
five years.

The law has been a major legislative priority of the high-tech
industry, which complained that companies are being inundated
by alleged frivolous class-action lawsuits by disgruntled stockholders.

It was unclear what political impact the president's veto would
have on his support by high-tech companies, which up to now
have supported him because he has supported high-tech programs.

With the stockholder-lawsuit curb now passed at the federal
level, lobbying activity has intensified on the state level,
where companies might still be subject to what they call frivolous
legal actions.

Expansion Slows

By:
Ismini Scouras

New York - The electronics industry continued to grow in December,
but experienced the slowest rate of expansion in more than
two years, according to purchasing managers surveyed for EBN's
QUEST report.

The study's composite index fell to 52.3 from 53.6 in November
and 53 in October, the lowest reading since the index registered
52.2 in November 1993. The index's average for the three months
ended in December was 52.96, down from 54.13 in November and
54.46 in October. Still, the index is above 50, as it has been
since early 1992, suggesting industry growth is still healthy
but stabilizing. A reading above 50 indicates expansion; a
reading below 50 means contraction.

"The industry is still strong, but probably transitioning to
a more sustainable pace," said Vladi Catto, chief economist
at Texas Instruments Inc., Dallas. Catto believes the industry
can maintain this pace through 1996, as well as the remainder
of the decade. And he does not expect the index to fluctuate
as sharply as it has in the past.

Although QUEST's production index dropped to 52.5 from 54.2
in November, the new electronics orders index inched up to
53 from 52.6, while the new export orders index grew to 51.2
from 50, indicating continued growth in the industry.

Growth in the PC market, an industry toward which the overall
electronics industry is heavily weighted, has moderated in
the past quarter, negatively influencing the overall expansion
rate.

"Computers are clearly driving the [composite] index, and when
you look at the strength in orders, that reflects the strength
in the PC market," Catto said. QUEST's computer index dropped
another 3 points to 45 in December, compared with 48 in November
and 53 in October.

Communications is a key sector that has affected the rate of
expansion, Catto said. The communications index for December
was 53.2, compared with 52.7 in November and 43.6 in October.
The military index rebounded to 57 from 53.2 in November and
a low 41.6 in July. The components and industrial controls
composite indexes were 55.2 and 53.6 in December, respectively.

In addition to an uptick in the orders index, another positive
sign is the electronics materials inventories index, which
was 48.7 in December, down from 49.3 the prior month, reflecting
lower inventory levels, Catto said.

However, some economists said that a general slowdown in the
U.S. economy will affect manufacturing and build up inventory
levels, causing companies to cut back production and lay off
employees.

"What we're seeing and expecting is a general slowdown, and
while the electronics industry has been fairly strong, we are
looking for that to slow some," said Marlene Grabau, economist
with Hong Kong, Shanghai Bank Corp. Washington Analysis, Washington.

When manufacturing and production levels fall, it usually creates
fear and uncertainty among consumers, who will then be frugal
in their spending habits. The cautious spending will ultimately
hurt sales of big-ticket electronics products. "It all ties
together, so the consumption of everything slows-but electronics
even more so because it is more of a discretionary item," Grabau
said.

Despite the slowdown, TI's Catto predicts the U.S. economy,
as well as the economy in other regions of the world, will
improve as the year progresses and once interest rates are
lowered, which most economists expect.

"Japan appears to be recovering and is getting stronger as we
speak, and Europe is holding its own," Catto said. "Asia-Pacific
continues to be strong."

Economic conditions in the United States and abroad have been
some of the key elements affecting electronics production,
analysts said. But the connection between economic progress
and the electronics industry will grow even stronger as worldwide
markets become more liberal and technology advances through
the decade, according to a Henderson Ventures report.

BusLogic And Mylex Agree To Merger

By:
Mark Hachman

San Mateo, Calif. - Mylex Corp. and BusLogic Inc. have agreed
to join forces, merging two successful I/O companies in a deal
company executives call unusually synergistic.

Mylex, which specializes in RAID disk controller and network
management products, signed an agreement to purchase BusLogic
an SCSI card manufacturer competing with suppliers such as
Adaptec Inc.-in exchange for approximately 2.7 million shares
of Mylex common stock, worth about $50.4 million. Additional
stock options, exercised after the agreement, could tack on
up to $11 million more.

Pending approval by BusLogic shareholders later this month,
BusLogic would continue to operate under its name and at its
present location as a wholly owned subsidiary of Mylex.

Mylex president and chief executive Al Montross noted that the
lack of technology overlap should spark gains in the quality
of future product releases as well as market share. "I can
think of only four positions [between the two companies] that
overlap," Montross said from the company's Fremont, Calif.,
headquarters, "and there is no overlap in our product line,
as well. We expect this deal to help our OEM sales to current
customers, including Hewlett-Packard, IBM, and Siemens. It's
a great fit in terms of sales power and engineering resources
and costs."

According to Disk/Trend Inc., Mountain View, Calif., Mylex shipped
60% of all RAID controllers to the network, minicomputer, and
multiuser systems markets. In 1994, the market for RAID controllers
grew 125%, with Mylex's share increasing nearly 20%

Both companies are free of debt, Montross said. Mylex reports
$34 million in liquid cash assets, while the privately held
BusLogic has reportedly been debt-free for 22 straight quarters,
with $5 million in cash currently on hand, Montross said. The
short distance between Mylex and BusLogic, Santa Clara, Calif.,
is an added bonus, he said.

BusLogic also indicated it would turn the new partnership into
an increased share in the OEM marketplace. "The positive synergy
created by the joining of Mylex and BusLogic will result in
a significantly enhanced market presence for both companies,"
said Jesse Chen, president and chief executive of BusLogic.
"Both organizations will be able to broaden their product offerings,
better serve their existing customers, and offer increasingly
more competitive products and customer service."

BusLogic, whose proprietary MultiMaster bus-mastering ASIC technology
allows for a common driver to be used for major bus architectures
including Peripheral Component Interconnect, EISA, VESA, and
Micro Channel, recently announced a PCI Ultra-SCSI host adapter
for personal workstations.

"This is a merger of two successful independent entities," said
Tom Lahive, industry analyst with the Storage Research Group
of International Data Corp., Framingham, Mass. "The combination
will allow BusLogic and Mylex to more effectively compete in
the accelerating storage marketplace."

FED Startup Seeking Mfg. Partners, Funding

By:
Anthony Cataldo

San Mateo, Calif. - Field-emission- display (FED) startup Silicon
Video Corp. (SVC) is looking to enlist two manufacturing partners
and to add its own high-volume production facility in order
to square off with active-matrix LCD (AM-LCD) suppliers by
1997.

In addition, the San Jose company hopes to collect $80 million
in funding in 1996 to support the cash-hungry development of
prototype 3-in. displays, which will serve as a precursor to
larger panels for notebook computers.

Though no manufacturing partners have signed on yet, the company
hinted that Hewlett-Packard Co., which has been the company's
largest investor, may commit to building the FEDs. "They have
that option," said David L. Bergeron, SVC's vice president
of manufacturing.

To meet its manufacturing goals, the company will eventually
need the backing of two manufacturers that are willing to invest
in developing the process to build FED screens, which promise
to combine the high quality of cathode-ray tubes with the low
power and small-form factor of flat panels.

"The idea would be to get two partners as early as possible,"
Bergeron said. "It becomes unmanageable to have more than two."

The partners must also be willing to build the FEDs in high
volume to ensure reliable second sourcing. "You don't want
a company that views this as an appendage, because they may
end up killing it," he said. "You don't want to focus on people
who want the AM-LCD fab investment."

What SVC does want is partners who can bring key manufacturing
technology to the table, particularly in the areas of robotics
and floor control. SVC points out that 85% of the FED manufacturing
process is based on standard tool sets, while the rest requires
special equipment. "They would help define the process and
put the plan in place," Bergeron said.

By adhering to standard tool sets for the majority of the manufacturing
process, the company hopes to keep costs low enough to be competitive
with AM-LCDs. And unlike AM-LCDs, the FEDs will be built without
using a costly stepper.

Furthermore, Bergeron said the company will achieve yields equal
to AM-LCDs while offering superior brightness. That's because
each FED subpixel contains 1,000 emitters that are 0.2-micron
in width, which allows a high margin of error for failed emitters,
said Nicholas G. Sturiale, SVC's director of marketing.

SVC plans to show off a 5-in. prototype display at the Display
Works conference in February, an event that the company said
will prove that the technology is not only feasible but manufacture
ready. "It will be a demonstration of the process technology,"
Sturiale said. "Most other companies show a demo first, raise
some money, then go out and build it."

The flip side to SVC's early emphasis on developing process
technology is that it has consumed a lot of cash. To begin
mass production by 1997, the company needs to raise about $80
million next year, nearly the same amount it has gathered since
its founding in 1991. Eventually, the company hopes to take
in a total of $300 million from outside investors by 1998,
Sturiale said.

"The pace of development is extremely fast," he said. "We're
burning a lot of dough."

If all goes as planned, the company will have secured two manufacturing
partners in time to start sampling its 5-in. Edison product
by the end of 1996. The company also plans to ramp up a new
100,000-sq.-ft. manufacturing plant of its own by 1997.

Edison is slated to be succeeded by a 12-in. DaVinci display
and the 7-in. Edison II screen in 1997. SVC also plans to start
sampling a 15-in. screen, dubbed Michelangelo, in 1998.

Though SVC insists that its FEDs will be competitively priced
with AM-LCDs once they are in full production, Japanese and
Korean manufacturers continue to drive AM-LCD prices down to
near-cost levels through heavy capital investments.

"The ability to get to low-cost manufacturing to a large extent
comes from building lots of products," said Joel M. Pollack,
senior product marketing manager of display products for Sharp
Electronics Corp., the largest supplier of AM-LCDs. "That sort
of experience hasn't even begun in the area of FEDs."

Even so, some AM-LCD makers are hedging their bets by keeping
FED technology at arm's length. "We have our eyes on the technology,"
said Robert Biega, program manager of mobile computing for
IBM Corp., which is producing AM-LCDs with Toshiba through
a joint venture. "Right now it's still in our research division
and hasn't come down to product planning."

Asia Watch: Wafer Fabs As National Policy

By:
Tom Mcale

In the 1980s, U.S. semiconductor makers debated whether government
should play a role in promoting development of the industry
with funding for programs like Sematech. But Washington's toe
in-the-water approach to high-tech policy pales in comparison
to what is happening in Singapore today.

The tiny Asian Tiger has virtually made wafer fab construction
and the development of leading-edge semiconductor manufacturing
processes the centerpiece of its national economic policy for
the 21st century.

In a series of announcements during the past two months, officials
have made it clear that the country's electronics industry
which accounted for 50% of the island's manufacturing output
last year-must quickly move to higher value-added businesses.
That means a move away from dependence on the disk drive business,
which is moving to Malaysia, Thailand, and other lower-cost
countries in the region, and a new focus on wafer fabs.

The plan calls for Singapore to have at least 25 fabs in operation
by the turn of the century or very soon after. Land, a highly
precious commodity in a country with an area of only 600 sq.
km, is already being set aside for two fab parks at Woodlands
and Tampines, and light-industrial operations there are being
moved out. A third park will be named later. Each of the parks
will accommodate up to 10 fabs.

Today, Singapore has only four fabs in operation, but another
six are in the pipeline. Chartered Semiconductor Manufacturing
Pte. Ltd., a government-funded foundry operation, has two fabs
running, a third in construction, and recently announced plans
to have three more fabs running by 2000.

Tech Semiconductor, a DRAM joint venture of the government's
Economic Development Board, Hewlett-Packard, Canon, and Texas
Instruments, has one fab running, one scheduled to come on
line in 1997, and a third scheduled for 1998.

SGS-Thomson Microelectronics last month announced a $35 million
expansion plan for its Singapore fab, and sources say the chip
maker is soon likely to announce plans for a second fab.

The big question now is who is going to pay for the fabs that
will carry an estimated price tag of $32 billion. The answer
is a combination of government and private investment, mostly
from U.S. and Japanese chip makers.

To succeed in having 25 fabs up and running by 2000, Singapore
will need to see at least half a dozen investment announcements
this year. But industry watchers across Asia tend to agree
that if any country can pull it off, it will be Singapore.

Taiwan Computer Industry To Undergo Growth In 1996 -- But Motherboard
Business May Move At Slower Rate

By:
Mark LaPedus

Taipei, Taiwan - Taiwan's computer industry is expected to grow
more than 27% this year, but local companies will lose some
market share in at least one of the industry's mainstays.

Total revenue of Taiwan's computer and peripherals industry
is projected to hit $27.13 billion in 1996, up from $21.3 billion
in 1995, according to the government-sponsored Market Intelligence
Center, based in Taipei. By 1998, Taiwan's computer industry
will reach $40.9 billion, according to MIC.

"1996 will be a good year," said Stan Shih, chairman and chief
executive of Acer Inc., Taiwan's largest PC company. "We expect
double-digit growth this year, maybe more than 20%."

On the downside, motherboard production in Taiwan will grow
only 15%, from 20.86 million units in 1995 to 23.9 million
units in 1996, according to MIC.

Taiwan's worldwide market share in the merchant motherboard
business actually dropped to 65% last year from about 81% in
1994, MIC said. Some analysts blamed the shortfall on Intel
Corp.'s thrust into the motherboard business.

On a positive note, Taiwan's desktop and notebook computer production
will jump from 7.16 million units in 1995 to 9.44 million units
in 1996, a 32% growth rate, according to MIC.

Desktop PC production will increase from 4.57 million units
in 1995 to 6.12 million in 1996, and notebook PC production
will jump from 2.59 million units in 1995 to 3.32 million in
1996, according to MIC, which added that Taiwan will continue
to be the world's leading producer of portable computers.

NEC Creates Taiwan Venture

By:
Mark LaPedus

Taipei, Taiwan - Continuing to shift production offshore in
response to the yen's appreciation, NEC Corp. of Japan has
formed a subsidiary in Taiwan to manufacture optoelectronic
and microwave semiconductor products.

Microwave and Optical Semiconductor Taiwan Co. Ltd., the new
subsidiary based in Taoyuan, is a joint venture of two NEC
affiliates-Kyushu Denshi Co. Ltd. and Chuo Denshi Kogyou Co.
Ltd. Kyushu makes optoelectronic devices, while Chuo produces
microwave semiconductor products. Total capitalization for
the venture is approximately $6.3 million.

Scheduled to begin production in October, the venture will make
several products, including photo-coupler devices and low-noise,
hetro-junction field-effect transistors.

Photo-coupler devices are used in telephones, fax machines,
PCs, and other systems. The FETs are used in broadcast satellite
tuners, communication satellite receivers, mobile communication
terminals, and wireless local-area networking products.

Harris Updates Older MPUs

By:
Darrell Dunn

Dallas - Strengthening demand for X86 microprocessors for embedded
applications has Harris Corp.'s Semiconductor Sector increasing
fab allocation to production of its decade-old 8086 and 286
product line, increasing packaging options, and looking to
complete a licensing deal for 386- and 486-generation devices.

"We're producing more than twice as many of these devices as
we did 18 to 20 months ago," said Jay Muns, product marketing
manager for microprocessor products at Harris, Melbourne, Fla.

"In the next six months, we're going to add another 50% to the
capacity dedicated to this product line, and over the next
18 months, we're hoping to add another 50% to 100% on top of
that," he said.

Harris' move comes at a time when companies such as Advanced
Micro Devices Inc. have dropped RISC processors in favor of
embedded 386 and 486 MCUs. While many other manufacturers of
X86 microprocessors have abandoned their efforts in the 8086
and 286 generations, Harris said the need for them continues
to remain strong.

"Most of our head-to-head competition in CMOS has upgraded fabs,
and when they've done that they are using more state-of-the
art process and are developing new products and haven't gone
back to redesign some of the more mature products," Muns said.

Harris is increasing the speeds of its devices, as well as adding
new packaging options, such as surface-mount packages, he said.

Including the processors and peripheral devices, such as timer
circuits and direct-memory-access controllers, Harris sold
more than 5 million of the 8086 and 286 devices in 1995.

"The company strategy is that we recognize this is a base business
that is profitable and we are committed to those products,"
a Harris spokesman said.

"They provide a good earnings stream. As we invest in new technologies
for wireless, multimedia, automotive, and power control, we
recognize that [the embedded X86] business is very important
to keep money coming into the company and helping us define
our future in other areas," the spokesman said.

Muns said Harris is currently "evaluating the possibility of
migrating to the next generations of X86 processors," although
he declined to specify what company Harris has been negotiating
with.

"We've been making these parts for many, many years now, but
we're seeing demand increase to the point that we've had to
go back in and reallocate fab capacity, and we are investing
significant money in new speed upgrades and package types,"
he said. "We are committed to this business."

Briefs: TI, TranSwitch Sign License



TranSwitch Corp., Shelton, Conn., has reached agreement with
Texas Instruments Inc., Dallas, to repurchase a license granted
to TI in 1991. The parties also entered into a new foundry
agreement making TI a foundry source for TranSwitch for the
next five years.

The license repurchase arrangement terminates a May 1991 agreement
that granted TI the right to manufacture and sell certain TranSwitch
PDH and SONET/SDH products in exchange for license and royalty
payments to TranSwitch.

Details of the repurchase agreement are confidential, but include
a one-time fee of $2.13 million and royalty payments from TranSwitch
through 1998. Under the foundry agreement, TranSwitch will
be able to access TI's manufacturing facilities for existing
products and for sourcing a certain number of new products
each year for the next five years.

In addition to TI's, TranSwitch also uses three other foundries,
including one offshore. TranSwitch plans to develop additional
sources in the future.

Briefs: Logic Devices Gets More Capacity



Logic Devices Inc., Sunnyvale, Calif., has entered into an agreement
with Zentrum Mikroelektronik Dresden GmbH (ZMD) to obtain processed
silicon wafers for delivery during the 1996 calendar year,
with an option to extend the agreement into 1997 and beyond.

Strong near-term demand is not being adequately supported by
existing wafer suppliers, the company said. The relationship
with ZMD will allow Logic Devices to catch up with, and support,
demand for digital-signal-processing products as well as provide
for the ongoing growth and evolution of its DSP product line
as ZMD's process technology evolves.

ZMD's process capabilities compare favorably with the existing
wafer sources, the company said. This will allow Logic Devices
to retool quickly a portion of its product line to utilize
this capacity commitment, said Bill Volz, president of Logic
Devices.

ISD's 4Q Not Up To Snuff -- Revenue Shortfall Due To Particular
Memory Chip


San Mateo, Calif. - Information Storage Devices Inc. said last
week that it expects revenue for the fourth quarter ending
Dec. 31, 1995, to be below analysts' expectations.

ISD management said in a prepared statement that they were satisfied
with the number and quality of new design wins in the consumer
electronics area that focus on ISD's analog memory chips.

However, several of the San Jose company's key customers indicated
that they have not received production releases from their
own customers due to uncertainty regarding consumer spending
trends, ISD said.

ISD said the revenue shortfall was limited to the memory chip
with a 20-second recording time. Within the shortfall, sales
of a telephone-answering chip manufactured by one of the company's
distributors in Japan declined sharply, contributing to the
lower-than-anticipated quarterly revenue.

The distributor/manufacturer has advised that it expects sales
to return to normal levels in early 1996.

The company said that sales of all its other products are meeting
expectations, and that demand for its products used in communication
applications remains strong and it is currently shifting wafer
starts toward these applications. The company anticipates adequate
product supply in the first quarter of 1996.

Tech Talk: SDRAM: The Speedmeister Of Digital Systems

By:
Reggie Huff

DRAM has always been a cheap form of memory. Should be. It forgets
what it was told to remember in 50 or 60 milliseconds. So,
in order to reap the dramatic cost-per-bit savings, one merely
needs to check with each memory cell about 20 times per second
to ask it what it was supposed to remember, and then remind
it to remember that!

Analog systems, once the premier platform of electronic design,
have been driven to near extinction by the "asynchrocidal"
digital revolution. Revolutionist leaders have implicitly insisted
that the greater good would be served when every circuit would
finally conform to the tick of a single clock. Memory chips
(bless their defiant souls) have traditionally retained the
freedom and independence that asynchronicity affords. No longer.
Today's frantic pace and ever-expanding "to do" list has finally
driven even the forgetful DRAM into fully synchronized operation.

Without the use of geometric reductions, refined lithography,
or breakthroughs in materials science, synchronous DRAM (SDRAM)
provides unprecedented silicon data transfer rates. In fact,
SDRAM is capable of supporting today's 100-MHz microprocessors
without cache, without multichip expense, and without the speed
curbing frustration of the dreaded wait state. Synchronous
DRAM blows the lid off system speeds by integrating multichip
memory management strategies into blazing monolithic solutions.

SDRAM functionality is principally distinguished by four features

 Synchronous Operation: The system clock gates all SDRAM operations.
(Conventional DRAM has no clock input.)

 Cell Banks: Internally, memory cells are divided into independently
accessed "cell banks," which may be treated as if they were
separate memory chips. This makes it possible to address a
location in one bank while simultaneously reading the data
requested during a previous cycle from another bank. While
the first read cycle is as long as a typical DRAM's, subsequent
cycles conduct the address input and data output delays concurrently,
resulting in increased data transfer rates. This method is
called pipelining.

 Burst Mode: This rapid data- transfer technique is accomplished
through the use of an Internal Column Address Generator. Once
the column address for the first memory location is set, subsequent
addresses are automatically generated internally. Either sequential
(for Motorola CPUs) or interleaved (for Intel CPUs) address
sequences may be programmed for automatic generation. Burst
mode may be applied for data transfers into memory (burst write)
or out of memory (burst read). The number of words to be transferred
with each "burst" can also be specified.

 Command (Mode) Storage Registers: These internal registers
are loaded with system configuration command codes upon power
up which define column-address strobe latency, the burst type
and burst length desired, addressing mode, test mode, and various
supplier-specific options to optimize the SDRAM performance
in a wide variety of applications.

If doing more things faster with fewer chips is our aspiration,
then SDRAM will be an architecture which, along with process
technology advancements, will pioneer the frontiers of throughput
right into the next revolution.

Semico Sees Larger Semi Market, Lower DRAM Prices

By:
Mark Hachman

San Mateo, Calif. - Within the booming semiconductor industry,
a tight memory supply will persist, thanks to increasing silicon
content in end products, said researchers at Semico Research.

A preholiday 1995 seminar on the desktop PC hosted by International
Data Corp. (IDC), Framingham, Mass., revealed a 1995 worldwide
semiconductor market estimated at $146.8 billion, up 44.1%
compared with 1994.

There's more good news in addition to the overall growth of
the market, Semico said. Not only are the end markets themselves
growing, but semiconductor content has grown from 9% in 1985
to 20% in 1995, and will grow to 25% by 1999, said Jim Feldhan,
president of Semico, Phoenix.

Investments in capacity will also be among the most important
events in the coming year. While OEMs may turn an anxious eye
toward their suppliers' manufacturing efforts, chip makers
appear to be maintaining a conservative approach to new fab
development, Feldhan said. Rather than the 15% to 20% of sales
invested in manufacturing during the "big '80s," silicon vendors
appear to have returned to historical levels of about 15% of
sales.

To no one's surprise, IDC is predicting that levels of silicon
content on PC motherboards will nearly double in 1998 due to
increased memory demands. Yet while the average PC memory will
break 30 Mbytes by 1998, doubling the value of silicon content
from $600 to more than $1,200, DRAM prices should finally begin
to decline, Feldhan said.

"In 1995, we've had a PC boom together with slowed Windows expectations.
Nevertheless, prices increased [in 1995] during a period of
expected decline," Feldhan said, indicating that he was speaking
of the fundamental decline in DRAM pricing over the last five
years. Feldhan expects a 5% to 7% decline per quarter in overall
DRAM pricing during the next year.

However, the increased use of DRAMs may not be a universal phenomenon,
particularly for older DRAM generations that have been enjoying
strong demand long past their projected lifetimes.

Feldhan warned that inventory re- adjustments by PC vendors
Packard Bell and AST Research, together with AT&T's exit from
the PC market, could spell spot fluctuations in 4-Mbit pricing
for the first quarter of 1996.

The continued transition from fast-page-mode to extended data
out memory adds additional uncertainty to spot markets, he
said.

Feldhan also noted that a warm welcome to the 64-Mbit generation,
together with high yields and competitive pricing, could make
unified memory architecture offerings "go away."

First CardBus-Complaint 3-V FPGA Is Sampling -- Xilinx Entry
Suitable For Telecom, Datacom Areas



San Mateo, Calif. - Xilinx Inc. has introduced the industry's
first 3-volt CardBus-compliant field-programmable gate array
(FPGA)

The introduction allows the company to triple its 3-V device,
speed, and package combinations from 17 to more than 50.

The Xilinx XC3100L-2 is the first FPGA device to support both
the emerging CardBus PC Card and 3-V Peripheral Component Interconnect
(PCI) Local Bus specifications, Xilinx said.

CardBus, which merges the PCMCIA form factor and the PCI-bus
electrical standard, is becoming widely accepted for portable
and mobile applications that demand both high performance and
3-V operation, according to the company.

Based on 0.6-micron TLM process technology, the XC3100L family
operates at up to 85 MHz and reduces system power consumption
by over 50% when compared to 5-V devices. The XC3100L family
is pinout- and bitstream-compatible with the XC3000A and XC3100A
devices, providing easy migration from 5-V to 3-V versions.

Additional 3-V choices include the XC4000L family. With gate
densities up to 20,000 usable gates, the XC4000L family is
suitable for replacing low-end gate arrays in more complex,
low-power designs. Previously, designers had limited choices
for low-voltage devices greater than 10,000 gates.

"Until now, 3-V designs were mostly limited to laptops and cellular
phone applications," said Chuck Fox, vice president of product
marketing at the San Jose company. "Now we see major design
activity in the mainstream telecom, datacom, and instrumentation
areas. Xilinx's expansion of its 3-V portfolio addresses this
growing market need," Fox added.

Both the XC3100L and the XC4000L families are sampling now,
and volume production is expected in the first quarter of 1996.

Devices are available in a variety of packages, including PLCC,
PQFP, VQFP, TQFP, and BGA.

Prices for the new devices in the XC3100L family start at $31
for the XC3142L in 100-piece quantities. Prices for the XC4000L
family start at $54 for the XC4005L device, also in 100-piece
quantities.

Keyboards Seek More Functions -- Adding Value Is Critical To
Successful Marketing

By:
Mark Hachman

San Mateo, Calif. - The trustworthy keyboard is in no danger
of extinction, but the threat of commodity status has forced
keyboard makers to integrate ever-increasing levels of functionality
into their products.

With suggested retail prices hovering at $30 or less for a standard
104-key keyboard, system manufacturers and consumers now regard
the keyboard as a throwaway item.

A sales executive at a leading mail-order PC vendor was clearly
puzzled when asked if a customer could opt not to buy a keyboard.
"That'll save you $16, but I don't get it," he said. "This
[PC] product is going to cost you more than that in shipping
alone."

Some manufacturers were able to claim a slight premium with
their recently introduced 104-key keyboard with three special
function keys designed to provide shortcuts for Microsoft's
Windows 95 operating system. The quest for any competitive
advantage quickly prompted virtually all of the industry's
players to follow suit with the configuration.

"That was probably the most exciting industry event since the
introduction of the number pad," one executive ironically observed.

While a business model based on volume shipments remains viable,
keyboard makers know well that integration means added value
and higher profit per unit.

The GlidePoint touchpad of Cirque Corp. migrated from notebook
trackpad to desktop keyboard. "While not everyone can follow
suit, Microsoft proved that you can sell keyboards if you can
add value," said Jim O'Callaghan, executive vice president
of marketing for Cirque, Salt Lake City.

Manufactured by Alps Electric (U.S.A.) Inc., San Jose, the 108
key Cirque GlidePoint Wave Keyboard carries a retail price
of $129. While conceding that price is still the deciding factor
for buyers, O'Callaghan touted the keyboard's ergonomic features
something of a new religion in keyboard design.

The Cirque keyboard is split to allow a more "natural" posture
when entering data, O'Callaghan said. Extra backspace, tab,
and mouse keys have been added, as well as the integrated GlidePoint
touchpad and wrist rest.

"As stress-related injuries become more prevalent, there is
a growing need for manufacturers to provide responsibly designed
products for computer users," O'Callaghan said. "[With] ourWave
Keyboard, we now meet our customers' comfort requirements for
both keyboard and pointing device input."

Manufacturing a standard keyboard for a rugged environment is
the route chosen by Advanced Input Devices, Coeur d'Alene,
Idaho. The company recently introduced the PKD-101, a sealed
101-key keyboard for industrial environments.

Taking integration to a new level, NMB Technologies Inc. boasts
of transforming the keyboard into a genuine subsystem. The
Chatsworth, Calif., company, which claims to be the highest
volume keyboard manufacturer in the world, recently introduced
its ConcertMaster line of keyboards.

NMB has integrated two shielded speakers into its standard 104
key keyboard, plus a 2+2 watt amplifier. Approved for compatibility
with both Windows 95 and Creative Labs' SoundBlaster sound
card, the keyboard also integrates surround sound functionality
with jacks for subwoofer, microphone, and internal speakers,
plus a volume control.

U.S. Takes The Biggest Piece


The United States is the largest geographic market for pressure
sensors, and U.S.-based companies are the world's leading suppliers
of the devices, according to Frost & Sullivan Inc., Mountain
View, Calif. U.S. companies own competitive advantages such
as broad product lines and technologies, substantial manufacturing
capabilities, and international facilities, the research company
said. The increasing globalization of customer operations requires
suppliers to serve customers within and outside their home
markets. The market for pressure sensors will grow at a compound
annual rate of 7.2% between 1994 and 1999, Frost & Sullivan
said.

Array Prefers Specialty Market -- Company Finds A Niche With
Circular Connectors

By:
Diane Norman

Chicago - Formed six years ago by the merging of three disparate
companies, Array Connector Corp. has become a specialty supplier
in the fiercely competitive connector market.

After struggling for years to carve out a piece of a market
dominated by big- name suppliers and served by scores of smaller
players, Array has narrowed its offerings to circular connectors
built to MIL-C-26482 specifications.

About 40% of the company's sales are to military/aerospace applications.
Array also builds circular connectors that "conform to" but
do not meet the MIL-C-26482 specs. These are sold to commercial
applications in the heavy-industrial and transportation markets,
and make up approximately 60% of Array's sales.

Founded in 1989 when the assets of three small companies-a distributor,
a defunct connector maker, and a machine shop-were merged,
the company initially offered a broad range of connector products
while it worked to integrate the three businesses.

Array expects sales of $6 million in 1995, and is forecasting
30% compound annual growth over the next four years.

Part of that growth will be fueled by an acquisition and a license
agreement with offshore producers, said sales and marketing
director David Shaff, Miami.

The company is in the final stages of negotiations to acquire
the assets of a connector company in Europe, Shaff said. Array
also plans to sign a license agreement with a Japanese connector
company that would expand its circular connector product line.
Shaff also indicated that Array will continue to introduce
new products for the military and commercial markets.

The company offers both standard and custom products and prides
itself on quick response time, he said. Because Array is small,
management operates with a "hands on" entrepreneurial style,
Shaff said.

"Our marketing strategy is to use MIL-C-26482 as a foundation
for a variety of connectors."

The vertically integrated company runs in-house plastic molding,
metal fabrication, machine shop, assembly lines, and a quality
assurance test laboratory, he said. It employs 60 workers and
houses its operations in a 20,000- sq.-ft. facility.

Most of Array's business comes from sales in the North American
market, but the company expects to expand in global markets
through the aforementioned joint ventures and licensing agreements,
Shaff said.

Array plans to sign several new distributors and sales representatives
in 1996 to help achieve its expansion goals, he added.

CalSwitch Moves, Adds Three Lines -- Connector, LED, And Switch
Offerings Expand

By:
Ann R. Thryft

San Mateo, Calif. - Regional electromechanical specialist California
Switch & Signal Inc. has relocated from Gardena, Calif., to
Carson, Calif., effective Jan. 1, and has added three product
lines.

The new product lines expand Cal- Switch's offerings in connectors,
switches, and LEDs.

"We've asked our customers what they're looking for, and the
addition of Kycon, Alps, and Kingbright was the result," said
Mark Poncher, the company's vice president.

CalSwitch will carry connectors, sockets, and custom-molded
cables from Kycon Cable and Connector Inc., San Jose; switches
and potentiometers from Alps Components, San Jose, a business
unit of Alps Electric (U.S.A.) Inc.; and LED lamps and displays
from Kingbright Corp., City of Industry, Calif.

"Alps expands our switch lines, and moves us more into potentiometers,
where we don't have as many lines as we'd like. Alps is one
of the industry standards for slide pots for the audio market,"
Poncher said.

CalSwitch is also expanding heavily into LEDs, carried by Kingbright,
bringing its LED line total to 12. "In the last year, we've
added three new LED manufacturers," Poncher said. "It's a huge
market, and it's snowballing. The market is so big that many
of these suppliers can't keep up with it, so we're helping
them find outlets for their supply."

CalSwitch's new facility in Carson has 83,000 sq. ft. "We've
now got 23,000 sq. ft. of office space, compared to 8,000 in
the old building," Poncher said. "Our warehouse space has doubled,
from about 30,000 sq. ft. to 60,000 in the new building," he
said.

Although the main reason for expansion was additional room,
it was also easier to accomplish computer and phone system
upgrades in the new building, along with adding electronic
data interchange, electronic mail, and a direct Internet connection,
Poncher said. "We would have had to rewire the entire building
in the old place."

The assembly department will also be much more organized because
it's now all under one roof, he added.

Richey Finishes Deanco Deal



Boston - Richey Electronics Inc. has completed the acquisition
of Deanco Inc. for approximately $60 million.

Deanco, Santa Clara, Calif., is a multi-regional distributor
of interconnect, electromechanical, and passive components.
Together, Richey and Deanco will be present in 17 states through
22 sales offices, seven of which are in the same market.

Combined, Richey and Deanco's estimated sales for 1995 total
approximately $221 million, making it one of the larger passives,
interconnect, and value-added distributors in North America.
The two distributors have complementary businesses and line
cards, and analysts have generally looked favorably on the
acquisition since Richey announced it last November.

For the first nine months of 1995, Deanco generated approximately
$77.8 million in revenue from 17 sales offices located predominantly
in the major western and eastern markets.

Under terms of the agreement, Richey, Garden Grove, Calif.,
acquired all the capital stock of Electrical Distribution Acquisition
Company (EDAC), which owns 100% of Deanco. The consideration
for the acquisition was composed of approximately $34.1 million
as the stock purchase price, approximately $6.6 million for
the redemption of EDAC stockholder notes, and the assumption
of $19.3 million of Deanco debt.

Richey, which does business as RicheyCypress Electronics, funded
the purchase consideration by drawing upon its $75 million
revolving credit and term-loan facility.

"We are delighted with this acquisition, which positions Richey
as one of the leading multiregional distributors serving 20
of the 31 key North American markets," said Bill Cacciatore,
Richey president and chief executive. "This acquisition generates
significant operating leverage and expands both our product
offering and market coverage, while leaving open the prospect
of future growth through geographic expansion and acquisition."

Consolidation of redundant operations and benefits of complementary
customers' bases will spread expenses over a much larger sales
base, Cacciatore added. "We expect to drive additional earnings
leverage by cross-selling our expanded product line and service
capabilities to a customer base that will have more than doubled
to approximately 20,000 customers."

Richardson Posts Strong First Half



Boston - As Richardson Electronics Ltd. had announced a few
weeks ago, the company achieved strong sales growth in all
its divisions for the period ended Nov. 30.

Total sales reached $61.7 million from $51 million a year ago.
Net income totaled $2.2 million, compared with $1.1 million
in the prior-year period.

Sales for the six-month period were $118.9 million, a 22% increase
from $97.4 million the prior year.

Each of the company's Strategic Business Units recorded sales
gains for the quarter. The Security Systems Division's sales
more than doubled to $6.7 million; the Solid State and Components'
unit increased its sales 46% to 17.8 million.

Richardson's Electronic Device Group's sales rose to $28.5 million
from $27.1 million the prior year, and the Display Products
Group's sales were $8.7 million, up from $8.5 million a year
ago.

Gross margins for the quarter improved to 29.1%, compared with
28.6% the prior year, reflecting higher distribution margins
primarily in Europe and the phase-down of the manufacturing
unit there completed in 1995. SG&A (sales, general, and administrative)
expenses as a percentage of sales also decreased to 21.4% from
22.6% the prior year.

"I am pleased with our first-half results," said Edward J. Richardson,
chairman and chief executive of the LaFox, Ill., company, "both
in terms of sales growth and improved margins. This momentum
should carry forward into the second half of fiscal 1996."

Switch Breaks $1/Node Barrier

By:
Darrell Dunn

Dallas - Dallas Semiconductor Corp. is shipping a dual-addressable
switch with 1 Kbit of EPROM that breaks the $1-per-node cost
for distributed system monitoring and control.

The DS2407 sensor/actuator chip can activate a switch and can
also monitor the presence or absence of voltage. The company
expects the device to find use in burglar alarms, factory automation,
comfort control, irrigation control, greenhouses, and vending
machines.

Two voltage sensors and two output transistors inside the DS2407
can be dynamically configured for operation as one sensor and
one switch, as two sensors, or as two switches.

"This chip was designed to exploit the computational, display,
and connectivity features of the PC," said Michael Bolan, vice
president of product development for Dallas. "From the serial
port of the PC, a twisted-pair telephone wire can be routed
up to 300 meters to multiple addressable switches. One signal
plus ground provides the digital communications link as well
as the power for the sensors and actuators."

The DS2407 draws its power from the communication line, so no
external power supply is required.

Each device is individually addressable, and dozens of chips
can be put on the same twisted pair, where a central processor
can turn them on and off individually.

This is made possible by a guaranteed-unique serial number that
is laser-etched into each chip that serves as a node address,
and by an on-chip multidrop network controller.

The DS2407 provides a simple way to build a closed-loop system,
Bolan said. The device sensor responds to a stimulus and reports
it to the processor. The processor makes a decision based on
the sensor input and the switch turns on or off to control
the process.

The flexibility of the DS2407 is enhanced by 1 Kbit of user
programmable and write-protectable EPROM. Data stored in memory
can describe a physical location, identify the controlled equipment,
calibrate the sensor, or reference the actuator to a specific
sensor.

Because it is dual-channel, the DS2407 can drive bidirectional
opto-isolators. One channel can light the LED while the other
senses the response. This feature is used to build electrically
safe opto-isolated interfaces to control high-power devices
such as electric motors or heating and air-conditioning systems.

The DS2407 is available in either a 6-pin, C-leaded surface
mount package, or as a single-channel version in a TO-92 package.
The dual-channel DS2407 is priced at $1.96 in quantities of
5,000, which works out to less than $1 per input/output node.

Isotek Ships Low-Ohmic Surface-Mount Resistors -- Devices Intended
For Use In Current-Sensing Apps

By:
Bettyann Liotta

New York - Isotek Inc. has unveiled two low-ohmic surface-mount
resistors for use in current-sensing applications.

"The low-ohmic feature is important for current sensing because
it offers the ability to sense high levels of current while
having relatively low power loss," said Isotek president Bill
Poisson.

The two-terminal SMR resistor and the four-terminal SMV device
are both rated at 3 watts and measure 6 mm x 12 mm x 3.4 mm
and require only 7.2 cm of space on a circuit board.

The SMR is available in values from 10 milliohms to 4.7 ohms
with a temperature coefficient of resistance (TCR) of less
than 50 ppm/C from 20C to 60C. The SMV is available with resistance
values from 1 m to 1 with a TCR of less than 30 ppm/C. Both
models are available with tolerances of 0.5%, 1%, or 5%

As members of Isotek's ISA-PLAN family of precision resistors,
the SM resistors feature etched manganin foil resistor elements
to facilitate long-term stability, and sport low TCRs and low
inductance of less than 10 nanohenries. Heavy copper-alloy
lead frames and massive copper power terminals serve as heat
sinks to the PC board.

Isotek is the sole distributor of the devices in the United
States, though the resistors are manufactured by Isabellenhutte
GmbH of Dillenburg, Germany. Isabellenhutte developed the alloy
manganin foil used in the products more than 100 years ago,
Poisson said. "Most competitors utilize nickel chrome alloy.[Our]
manganin material has the benefit of very low TCRs at these
low ohmic levels," he said. "As you get down to very low ohms,
the TCRs go up exponentially with nickel chrome. We have low
ohms and low TCRs. And, unlike wirewound resistors, the ISO
PLAN technology is a flat foil, so it has much lower inductance
than wirewound resistors."

SM series resistors are intended for current-sensing applications
found in automotive controls, stepping and servo motor controllers,
power converters, power supplies, digital multimeters, and
medical instrumentation. They are packaged in standard EIA
481 24-mm tape.

Prices vary by resistance value and tolerance. A 100-m SMR with
5% tolerance is priced at $1.74 in 1,000s. A 10-m SMV with
1% tolerance is priced at $2.02 in the same quantities. Delivery
is within 12 weeks.

Macronix Debuts Controllers

By:
Mark LaPedus

Hsinchu, Taiwan - Taiwan's Macronix International Co. Ltd. has
entered the RISC embedded-controller market with a trio of
products built around R3000 processor technology licensed from
Mips Technologies Inc.

Though Macronix licensed the technology in 1992, no generally
available products resulted from the agreement until now. Macronix's
R3000-based controllers are designed for 32-bit embedded applications
such as laser printers, car navigation systems, and handheld
equipment, said vice president Chris Kao.

Other applications for the R3000-based controllers include local
area networking equipment such as bridges, routers, and related
products, Kao said. Macronix is also looking to develop a separate
line of RISC microcontroller units for the set-top-box market.

The 3.3-volt MXR3500 is an entry-level controller with a 40
MHz clock rate and 28-million-instruction-per-secondperformance.
"It also has built-in power management features, making it
ideal for handheld devices," said Albert Sun, department manager
for Macronix's custom design department.

The MXR3500 is also available as an ASIC core, which is Macronix's
second 32-bit embedded offering. The core measures 5.2 mm2,
making it the world's smallest 32-bit RISC core for the embedded
market, positioned against the products of AT&T, Advanced RISC
Machines, Hitachi, NEC, and others, according to the company.

The third controller is the 3.3-V 40-MHz MXR3520 with power
management features and on-chip cache memory. Priced around
$10 in quantities, the device comes in a 100-pin PQFP. The
single-chip device will ship in the third quarter of 1996.

The MXR3500 is packaged in a 128-pin PQFP, but price was not
disclosed. Both the MXR3500 and the MXR3500-based ASIC core
are now available.

More Comfortable Ride In 1996 -- Capacitor prices are expected
to stabilize, and availability will improve, barring severe
materials shortages

By:
Gina M. Roos

On a roller coaster for the past year, the capacitor market
has been coping with capacity constraints and high demand in
addition to raw-material shortages and price increases. As
a result, several capacitor makers raised prices more than
20% in 1995, and placed capacitors, particularly tantalum chips,
on allocation. This year, capacitor producers expect prices
to stabilize and availability to improve as more capacity continues
to come on line.

After concentrating on capacity expansion last year, the capacitor
market will likely resume its focus on reducing costs and packing
more capacitance in smaller case sizes. Buyers can typically
expect a price reduction as a result of this downsizing, in
addition to improvements in capacitor performance, including
higher operating temperatures, higher capacitance, and low
equivalent series resistance (ESR)

This year, many suppliers expect double-digit growth in all
dielectrics due to exceptional demand. AVX Corp. anticipates
20% growth, Philips Components predicts its aluminum electrolytic
business will grow 20% to 30%, and film supplier ITW Paktron
believes its dollar sales will rise 22%. NEC Electronics hopes
to report 25% growth for its fiscal year ending in April.

Demand remains strong from the communications, disk drive, and
computer markets, particularly as faster systems require more
passive devices. The exception is the cellular telephone market,
expected this year to show modest growth compared with the
breakneck pace of the past few years. More moderate growth
in the cellular business should considerably ease the demand
for tantalum-chip capacitors, some suppliers noted.

Last year's severe shortage of tantalum chips appears to have
subsided. "The supply situation is approaching demand. We've
gotten off the life-support system as far as critical shortages
are concerned, but we are still at a critical stage," said
Ed Bost, vice president of tantalum marketing at Kemet Electronics
Corp., Greenville, S.C. But an unexpected spike in the cellular
market could cause spot shortages, Bost added.

Recent capacity additions should help suppliers cope with surprises.
Some examples:

 Ceramic-capacitor maker Murata Manufacturing Co. Ltd. has increased
capacity by 30% in 1995, with another 25% coming this year.

 Kemet will boost both its ceramic and tantalum production by
30%.

 Tantalum-chip maker NEC Electronics Inc. plans to add about
10% to 15% capacity.

 Vishay Electronic Components has added roughly 40% to 50% to
its tantalum-chip capacity.

However, tantalum-chip lead times are not back to normal. New
customers are unlikely to receive products in less than 14
to 16 weeks, although lead times also vary by capacitor value,
said Judy Hausman, product marketing manager at NEC Electronics
Inc., Mountain View, Calif. The most popular capacitors are
1-microfarad, 16-volt devices in an A case size; 10-F, 16-V
components in an EIA B case size; and 10-F, 20-V parts in an
EIA B case.

Because of the tantalum-chip shortage, users have started substituting
ceramic and aluminum electrolytic capacitors. A few suppliers
think the use of substitutes has eased with the added capacity;
some maintain that the alternatives could compromise system
performance.

"I think it's a stopgap measure and not a permanent move to
use them in place of tantalums," Hausman said. Aluminums do
not offer a wide operating- temperature range. And ceramic
capacitors' capacitance value changes with variations in temperature,
although they are cheaper than tantalums and will not catch
fire when inserted backward, she said.

Still, others expect the switch to substitutes to be permanent.
As long as ceramics are priced competitively and meet performance
requirements, they will be used instead of tantalum chips,
said David Kirk, manager of marketing and engineering for electronic
infrastructure products, Murata Electronics North America Inc.,
Smyrna, Ga. In addition, ceramic-capacitor lead times are holding
steady at four to six weeks. Murata's ceramic capacitor business
picked up for values between 1 F to 10 F during the period
of critical tantalum-chip shortages, he said.

Kemet's Bost also saw users shifting to leaded tantalum devices.
Although unit consumption of leaded tantalum devices is declining
about 3% to 4% a year, Kemet will remain in the market to fill
the void left by manufacturers shifting capacity to surface
mount lines or no longer supporting the leaded market, he said.
Bost expects leaded prices to climb about 3% a year.

Tantalum-powder suppliers Cabot Performance Materials and HC
Starck would not comment on pricing strategies for 1996. But
Vishay president Don Alfson said tantalum suppliers have told
him to expect hikes of 6% to 10%. Vishay and its competitors
are negotiating with powder suppliers.

Tantalum powder averages $150 per pound and accounts for 10%
of a tantalum capacitor's cost, said Hongju Chang, manager
of R&D at Cabot Performance Materials, Boyertown, Pa.

NEC, which increased its prices 10% to 20% in 1995 because of
exchange rates and tight supply, is expecting tags to stabilize
barring a sharp rise in tantalum-powder prices, Hausman said.

However, Kemet is looking at potential price hikes of roughly
12%, although a portion of the increase will be offset by the
use of higher-charged powders, Bost said.

Pricey Palladium

Most of the raw-material cost in multilayer ceramic capacitors
comes from palladium. As a result of higher prices of that
metal, coupled with scarce production capacity during the first
half of 1995, ceramic-capacitor prices rose 5% to 10%

Palladium prices eased in late 1995, settling in the range of
$130 to $140 a troy ounce, after having doubled from $89 a
troy ounce in 1992 to $180 a troy ounce in 1995, according
to Gordon Bassett, general manager for the Precious Metal Marketing
Division of Johnson Matthey Inc., Valley Forge, Pa.

"As additional capacity comes on board, we anticipate seeing
price pressures in those areas, but the cost of palladium has
also fallen a little bit. We'll see some price pressures if
the cost of palladium doesn't accelerate again," said John
Sarvis, manager of product marketing for ceramics at AVX Corp.,
located in Myrtle Beach, S.C.

As a result of the rising cost of palladium, many ceramic-capacitor
suppliers are considering alternatives. Some are using other
base metals, such as nickel, to replace palladium in the inner
electrode systems. Murata Electronics has developed ceramic
capacitors made with nickel inner electrodes.

When there are many layers, the cost difference between nickel
and palladium becomes significant; for the high-layer parts,
the savings is about 5%, Murata's Kirk said. Ceramics made
of nickel inner electrode could now account for as much as
10% of Murata's ceramic-capacitor business, according to Kirk.

Aluminum foils used to manufacture aluminum-electrolytic capacitors
are still in limited supply from major Japanese producers,
and lead times have stretched in some cases to 24 to 26 weeks.
Heavy demand from the power-supply market has fueled shortages
of large-can, high-voltage aluminum electrolytic capacitors.
These parts also go into motor control and industrial applications.

Prices are also on the rise. Philips Components increased aluminum
electrolytic prices by as much as 15% to 25% last year. The
company may again increase prices because of higher raw-material
costs, according to Al Sembos, marketing manager for aluminum
electrolytic capacitors at Philips Components, Columbia, S.C.
But currency is not a major factor. "The increase reflects
the attempt by the foil suppliers to improve their financial
situation, and the demand is so strong, especially from the
Far East, that it has caused a shortage," he said.

Limited supply has resulted in Philips Components placing aluminum
 electrolytic capacitors on allocation for the last nine months,
and the company is not accepting additional customers. "The
difficulty with the aluminum foil is more acute in the high
voltage range-200 V and up-impacting both screw- terminal and
snap-in products, which are significant in size and require
large amounts of foil," Sembos said.

Lead times at Illinois Capacitor Inc. are six months, said Mike
Shade, operations manager at the aluminum-electrolytic and
film supplier, located in Lincolnwood, Ill. The company is
trying to stock as many high-voltage parts in its standard
line as possible. "We are hoping the material crunch will let
up, but we don't expect marked improvement in 1996," Shade
said.

According to Tom Green, vice president of sales and marketing
at North American Capacitor Co., Indianapolis, another price
hike is possible for 300-V to 450-V aluminum-electrolytic capacitors.
The limited number of facilities that can etch and form high
voltage aluminum foil has led to the shortage, he said.

Another dielectric that has taken a turn for the worse is polycarbonate,
used to manufacture specialty film capacitors. Reportedly,
supply is severely limited since its sole producer, Bayer in
Germany, sold the technology and equipment to Electronic Concepts
Inc., Eatontown, N.J. In addition, suppliers report that prices
have doubled. Electronic Concepts could not be reached.

The polycarbonate is typically used in applications requiring
stability at high temperatures or over a wide temperature range,
with tight tolerances of 1%, Shade said. He believes many engineers
have moved away from the material in favor of polypropylene.

There is some interest in polypheny-lenesulfide (PPS) as a replacement
for polycarbonate because of similar characteristics. PPS use
has risen because it is a high-performing dielectric that can
be used in resonant-filter capacitors for power supplies, said
Dick Slocum, sales and marketing manager for ITW Paktron, Lynchburg,
Va. Unfortunately, the cost of PPS is four times that of polyester,
according to film supplier DuPont Electronics, Wilmington,
Del.

DuPont expects to cut the price of polyethyleneaphthalate (PEN)
film this year. The monomer used to produce the film is expected
to drop from $5.50 per pound to $1.50/lb. when Amoco Chemical's
new plant comes on line. The biggest advantage of PEN: It can
be dipped in molten solder in the wave solder process, said
Mike Popowich, business manager for the films for the Americas
and Far East at DuPont Electronics' films division.

More In Less Space

Capacitor makers are packing more capacitance in the same unit
area across all dielectrics. In tantalum capacitors, suppliers
are looking for higher-charged powders to give them an extra
boost. Any capacitance/voltage per gram (CV/gram) rating above
40,000 is considered high-charged.

"We try to use the highest-charged powders to get the smallest
packages. We're at a point where we can't go on until the tantalum
powder producers improve their technology," Hausman said. Currently,
NEC makes tantalum in an 0805 case size designed for consumer
products.

The main driver is achieving a higher charge per gram and per
unit volume, said Chang at Cabot Performance Materials. The
highest-charged powder available is 40,000 CV/gram, which can
reach 100,000 CV/gram in two years, he said. Cabot is in pilot
production with tantalum powder at 65,000 CV/gram. But there
are safety and purity issues with the higher-charged powders,
he said.

Tantalum-powder supplier HC Starck Inc., Newton, Mass., is also
developing a 60,000-plus CV/gram powder. Terrance B. Tripp,
manager for powder R&D, said most powders used today are in
the 20,000-class range, and the industry is rapidly moving
to 30,000 CV/gram.

Aluminum-electrolytic capacitor makers are also in the game
for more CV. "Everyone is attempting to increase the number
of microfarads they can realize in a unit area of foil. We
can utilize less material and be able to build more pieces,"
Sembos said.

There has also been a move to lower- voltage parts driven primarily
by the portable communication and computer markets. "A lot
of computers are being designed to run at 3.3 V, which has
had a dramatic impact on capacitor voltages, typically at a
standard 50 V and 100 V," Sarvis said. "Those voltages are
being driven down to 16 V and 10 V, and eventually to 6.3 V,
which was unheard of three years ago," he said.

AVX reports increased interest from the computer market for
its integrated passive component lines.

Introduced in late 1995, these devices are similar to resistor
arrays, and integrate two or four capacitors in a surface-mount
package.

Although downsizing to save space will continue, demand for
larger case sizes will not disappear, particularly at high
CV values. AVX maintains that its 10-F product is still the
main driver for the 1210 case size, and values of 1 F, 2.2
F, 3.3 F, and 4.7 F are the 1206 leaders. Still, products of
1 F and less are moving into 0805 and 0603 sizes.

AVX sees a trend this year to broaden the range of the 0805
and 0603s, which could affect the number of 1206s sold next
year. The tiny 0402 is still not cost-effective, and the primary
markets remain applications with very tight space requirements,
such as communications and hearing aids.

Leaded aluminum-electrolytic and film capacitors are still in
demand because the devices do not easily lend themselves to
surface-mount technology.

"Films still have a long way to go for us to realistically address
anything smaller than a 1812 case size, so we're going in the
other direction: packing a lot of capacitance in 1812 and 2824
sizes," Slocum said.

In addition, polyester, the most widely used material for films,
is now available in the thinnest gauge, which has allowed the
company to pack more capacitance into standard sizes.

"We've expended our energies during the last three to four months
on making polyester, which has a rather low melting point,
[and is] more survivable in infrared reflow," Slocum said.

ITW Paktron expects to release a polyester-film line of surface
mount chip films in the larger case sizes with increased voltage
ratings of up to 100 VDC, targeting the high-frequency power
supply market with 1-F and 2.2-F parts. Slocum said you cannot
get those values in a chip that is going to survive IR with
other film materials.

With capacity problems behind them, capacitor suppliers will
refocus their efforts on R&D. A number of new products are
lined up for this year.

Illinois Capacitor is introducing a line of snubber caps. The
updated design provides more current handling and better dV
dt ratings in a smaller package. The company also is standardizing
three of its power-cap lines.

In addition, it will introduce two aluminum-electrolytic lines
 the LSR series of low-ESR capacitors for switch-mode power
supply applications and the SAK series aimed at applications
with low-height requirements.

Philips reports good results in developing longer-life and higher
temperature caps. Watch for a new product release in the first
quarter of 1996.

Also expect a new low-ESR tantalum series in April,which will
be available in several values in A to D case sizes from NEC
Electronics.

Opinion: Never A Dull Moment -- Plenty of questions to answer in new
year

By:
Hugh G. Willett

I can't say we at EBN get all the most exciting assignments
while covering the electronics and computer industry. Compared
with journalists covering troop deployments to Bosnia or the
budget battle on Capitol Hill, the latest components might
seem a little boring. But don't forget: While they get to wear
flak vests and talk to anonymous sources in darkened garages,
we get to cover the Information Revolution as it happens.

And I think 1996 is going to be quite interesting for those
of us covering the high-tech business. In fact, I'll bet that
we have some of the most exciting stories to hit our industry
in a long time.

First of all, we have the component shortages to think about.
For the last couple of years this story has been a no-brainer
to cover. Shortages, shortages, shortages-we basically could
fly on automatic pilot for a while. This year the component
drought is supposed to break, but which shortages are going
toease up and which components are actually going to be in
oversupply?

In the SRAM markets, I think some of us are already talking
about a balance in supply and demand that will eliminate the
kind of price gouging that was going on last year. Sure, every
system shipped will have cache, but the supply of such parts
is already meeting demand and more suppliers are coming on
line. Look for at least a couple of stories in the coming year
about new suppliers, cache RAM alternatives, and on-board cache
schemes from Intel's P6 to Cypress Semi's cache/logic chip
sets and how all of these relate to the supply/ demand balance
in the SRAM markets. I would not be surprised to see big changes
by midyear.

Calling the turning points in the DRAM market could be a little
trickier than in SRAMs because there seems to be such elasticity
of demand that any time the supply increases enough to have
an effect on pricing, demand soars again. For example, I needed
8 Mbytes of RAM to run Windows 95, but I wanted 16 Mbytes to
really run it well. When I found out I could afford 16 Mbytes,
I jumped at it. When the PC support people said they could
leave the old 4-Mbyte module in place for a total of 20 Mbytes,
I again said yes. If they had asked me if they could put in
another 4 Mbytes, I'd also have said yes. I've figured out
that you can't have too much RAM, and sooner or later I'll
need more.

My guess is that the market will go through turmoil this year
as we shift from supply balance to falling prices and back
to strong demand and stable prices and back to rising prices
on some types of DRAMs. If everybody drops out of 4-Mbit DRAMs
because the margins have fallen, then 4-Mbit chips become more
scarce and prices rise again. The organizational mix within
the various densities will make keeping track of what's scarce
and what's not a full-time job for reporters, analysts, and
OEMs. The old "parts is parts" line just doesn't hold true
in the DRAM market anymore. We're ready for the "big memory
crash of '96" story, but I hope we don't get fooled on this
one. The big story for the past two months has been DRAM prices
declining, but I am not fully convinced we've turned the corner
on this one just yet. At this stage, I'd be resisting the urge
to play payback with my suppliers until I'm sure.

One thing is for sure. We won't get the story exactly right
until after it's already happened; no one will, it's just too
hard to see into the future. So we'll do our best and try to
help OEMs make better buying decisions while the suppliers
claim we're too low on our price predictions and the big OEMs
say our price predictions are too high. Maybe I'll get to wear
that flak vest after all?

CyberAgents Automate Network Tasks



New York - FTP Software Inc. announced availability of its CyberAgent
Software Development Kit (SDK) for building and managing intelligent
agents to perform critical, delegated tasks across enterprise
networks and the Internet.

Intelligent agents are autonomous and adaptive software programs
that accomplish their tasks by traveling the network and executing
preassigned commands remotely. System administrators, network
managers, and software developers can use the CyberAgent SDK
to create and manage intelligent agents to execute critical
processes including hardware and software asset management,
virus protection, and information search and retrieval.

The CyberAgent SDK is first in the family of CyberAgent Technology
products from FTP Software's Intelligent Agents Business Unit.
It features an integrated development environment for creating
agents, an Agent Manager for deploying and managing agents
across a network, and sample, ready-to-run intelligent agents.

"System administrators and software developers who deploy intelligent
agents developed with the CyberAgent SDK will be able to effectively
manage and automate network tasks previously performed manually,"
said David French, general manager of FTP Software's Intelligent
Agents Business Unit, Andover, Mass.

The integrated development environment of the CyberAgent SDK
includes a Visual Editor, an agent scripting language, debugging
tools, and sample source code.

The Visual Editor simplifies the development and debugging of
agents by providing button bars for point-and-click agent construction;
context-sensitive help; syntax highlighting; and debugging
tools. The CyberAgent Manager launches, listens for, runs,
and routes agents.

In addition, it provides the critical security mechanism that
allows only authorized agents to run. When agents have completed
their tasks, the CyberAgent Manager can display reported results.

The CyberAgent SDK, compliant with the Windows Sockets Standard,
runs on Windows 3.1, Windows for Workgroups, and Windows 95.
The CyberAgent Software Development Kit will be available in
mid-January with a list price of $495.

Templar Program Enables Secure EDI Over The Net



New York - Premenos Corp., a leading provider of electronic
data interchange software solutions for electronic commerce
applications, announced its Templar Certification Program.
The program will allow interested EDI vendors to incorporate
Templar with their translation software to offer secure EDI
over the Internet.

Premenos, Concord, Calif., is encouraging the use of open-network
communication vehicles to further advance the EDI industry.
Now, with the Templar Certification Program, all customers
who have implemented EDI can utilize the Internet as an inexpensive,
high-bandwidth form for EDI communications.

Templar is a suite of standards-based software, service, and
network solutions designed to enable the secure transmission
of end-to-end EDI documents over open networks. Templar software
is the layer between the mail agent, such as SMTP/MIME, and
the EDI translation software to ensure confidentiality, integrity,
authentication, and nonrepudiation of both origin and receipt.

Templar software also provides operations management, including
trading-partner setup, designation of communication and security
requirements, key management, and transaction tracking. Templar
incorporates RSA's public-key cryptography technology integrated
at the application layer-the layer closest to the data.

The Templar Certification Program is available to vendors from
UNIX, AS/400, and MVS mainframe EDI translation software companies.

Since EDI is a standards-based industry and all of Premenos'
products adhere to the standards-including MIME, RSA, and AUT
ACK-the Templar interoperability is quick and easy.

The first to participate are PC EDI translation vendors APL
Group and TSI International, both of Wilton, Conn., and DNS
Worldwide, Burlington, Mass.

"We consider Templar to be the new standard for secure, reliable
network communications," said Stuart Sawabini, president of
the APL Group. "Now we can offer a powerful PC translation
product that, when teamed up with Templar, provides users with
the convenience and cost savings of conducting business transactions
using national data standards over the Internet."

MPEG-2 Encoder Set For Less

By:
Jonathan Cassell

San Mateo, Calif. - In the semiconductor industry's latest step
to discount the cost of real-time compression of broadcast
quality digital video, Mitsubishi Electronics America Inc.
has introduced a low-priced MPEG-2 encoding chip set.

The Mitsubishi set can encode main- profile, main-level video
at resolutions up to 720 480 pixels and at rates as high as
30 frames per second, providing full conformance with the ITU's
601 standard.

The chip set requires only 10 devices to achieve such performance
and costs $6,000 in 1,000s, or $7,000 as part of an evaluation
board, according to Mitsubishi Electronics America, the Sunnyvale,
Calif., subsidiary of Mitsubishi Electric Corp., Tokyo. With
that price point, the Mitsubishi set could serve as the basis
of a low-cost digital video-encoding system or as part of a
future MPEG-2 decompression add-in card for personal computers.

The ability to build low-cost compression systems based on the
Mitsubishi chip set contrasts sharply with the state of the
market at the beginning of 1995, when a low-cost MPEG-2 encoding
end system cost around $100,000.

During 1995, several companies offered lower-cost MPEG-2 encoders,
hoping to capture a piece of the burgeoning market for video
compression systems used in applications ranging from digital
cable- and direct-broadcast satellite television networks to
advertisement insertion at local cable head-ends.

C-Cube Microsystems Inc. in April introduced the CLM4400, which
was priced at $1,950 in 100s, as opposed to the company's older
MPEG-2 compression chip set-the CLM4700-which was priced at
$12,000 for a version that supports main-profile, main-level
encoding. The CLM4400 could achieve such a low cost by halving
horizontal resolution, allowing a complete compression system
based on just four chips.

IBM in March introduced a $700 MPEG-2 encoder that reduced costs
by exclusively performing I-frame compression and omitting
motion-estimation functions.

Unlike the C-Cube CLM4400, the Mitsubishi chip set supports
full-resolution display. The Mitsubishi set also supports all
MPEG-2 prediction modes, including I-, P-, and B-frames, in
contrast to the IBM chip.

To perform MPEG-2 compression with full-frame prediction and
main-profile and main-level support, the Mitsubishi chip set
requires at minimum a single M65722FP pixel processor, a M65721FP
controller, and eight M65727FP motion estimators. Another feature
of the Mitsubishi chip set is a built-in interface to synchronous
DRAM.

The M65722FP pixel-processor and M65727FP motion-estimator chips
are available now, while the M65721FP controller will be available
later this month. The motion estimator by itself is priced
at $500 in 1,000s. Mitsubishi will begin selling evaluation
boards in February.

Briefs: Philips, Sony Ease DVD Restrictions



Philips Electronics N.V., Eindhoven, the Netherlands, and Sony
Corp., Tokyo, have agreed to allow potential buyers of their
Digital Video Disk (DVD) technology to license to others the
more than 40 patents the two share. Buyers will have the right
to license the DVD patents to individuals or groups. The companies
also will cut DVD licensing fees by about 15%

The two companies made the announcement at the behest of the
U.S. Justice Department, which has subjected the Philips/Sony
partnership to a 20-month antitrust investigation. Moreover,
the partners said that due to lowered manufacturing costs,
licensing fees will remain fixed at 5 cents per disk, rather
than escalating with inflation.

Points Of Convergence: Rapid Silicon Advances Push PC Chip Suppliers

By:
Lewis Eggebrecht

Major improvements in process and packaging technology now allow
chip designers to easily integrate multiple PC functions on
a single chip. This new capability is forcing chip companies
to obtain more pieces of the PC technology pie to stay in the
business. As chips add more and more functions, the PC technology
pie increasingly is being split into fewer and fewer pieces.
For PC chip suppliers, the key question is: How will the PC's
silicon pie be split between the traditional suppliers, and
who will be left standing when the music stops?

We have seen silicon process technology advance rapidly from
1.0-micron drawing rules to 0.35-micron geometry. Chip packaging
has now evolved so that 208-pin and 240-pin PQFPs are common
and much higher pin-count devices are possible with ball-grid
array packaging. This rapid technology advancement has caught
many suppliers of PC chips off guard.

Some companies find they now need new technology pieces to continue
their participation in the market. Many companies are scrambling
either to develop or to acquire new technologies just to remain
a player.

Traditionally, PC chip suppliers were partitioned by the functional
blocks of the PC, i.e., processor companies, memory companies,
core-logic companies, and peripheral-chip companies. These
suppliers took advantage of advancements in process technology
and in packaging to improve the performance and functionality
of products within their narrow band of expertise.

Silicon process technology has advanced more rapidly than performance,
however, and functional enhancements have been developed for
individual PC functions. To fill this silicon vacuum, major
functional blocks are now being combined in a single device.

It's unclear who the winners and losers will be in this silicon
convergence. Will microprocessor companies such as Intel, Cyrix,
Advanced Micro Devices, and others absorb much of the PC's
function into their products? Intel has tried this with little
success in its SL family of products, which added peripheral
logic to the microprocessor die.

By pushing the concept of Native Signal Processing, Intel indirectly
is absorbing functions into the processor by enabling software
to perform traditional peripheral functions such as audio,
video, and graphics. Multimedia microprocessor instruction
set extensions, i.e., digital-signal-processor-like instructions,
now are being planned by most processor suppliers. This is
another example of how the microprocessor camp is claiming
more of the PC's functionality.

A more direct example of microprocessor/PC integration is Cyrix
Corp.'s new CG5x86 chip, which contains a high-performance
486 CPU, a memory and cache controller, a Peripheral Component
Interconnect bridge, and a VGA graphics accelerator with video
processing. his chip also has multimedia instruction set enhancements
and a special virtual-processor mode enabling software emulation
of legacy I/O devices.

Core-logic suppliers are now developing peripheral-chip technology
to integrate into core logic. Several suppliers now provide
sound functionality and VGA acceleration both as separate chips
and as an integrated part of their core-logic offerings.

Peripheral-chip suppliers are also responding by integrating
multiple peripheral functions onto a single chip and by developing
core-logic chip sets.

The new NVidia Corp. chip set, for example, integrates VGA acceleration,
sound generation and recording, game controller, and 3-D graphics
functions. Modem-chip manufacturers have also been quick to
add sound capability to their chips.

To achieve true single-chip integration, suppliers need to integrate
analog functions such as phased-lock-loop clock generators,
clock and data separators, codecs, ADCs, DACs, and RAMDACs
onto their products.

Without access to these mixed-signal technologies, true single
chip solutions are not possible. Integrated Circuit Systems
and other companies with expertise in mixed-signal technologies
are also acquiring peripheral-device blocks that are necessary
to compete in this highly integrated converging environment.

In the face of the move by traditional suppliers to integrate
existing fixed functional blocks into products, a new approach
to integrating PC functionality is being developed. Several
companies are developing multimedia processors that they claim
are sufficiently powerful to absorb much of the PC's multimedia
and peripheral functions into a single multimedia processor
chip.

Some of these broadband media processors basically are downloadable
DSPs with RISC-processor-like enhancements, and have features
including pipelining, superscalar execution, very long word
instructions, along with partitioned arithmetic logic units
to better handle graphics and video data types.

No approach will totally win. The PC is expanding into so many
different application areas that multiple architectures and
partitioning will proliferate. In other words, there is more
than one pie to split. But it is clear that if the traditional
PC chip suppliers are to survive, they will need to acquire
or develop more of the pieces of the PC pies.

Inc., San Jose.

VLSI: Interconnect's The Thing -- Says Industry Needs Different
Benchmarks

By:
Anthony Cataldo

San Mateo, Calif. - For those who still judge a device by its
line width, VLSI Technology Inc. has a message: Why don't you
consider the interconnect?

While line width has traditionally been the chief technology
yardstick for ICs, the true test of performance depends largely
on how tightly a vendor can pack the signal lines that transfer
data among stacked metal layers, especially for deep submicron
devices, said Robert Payne, chief technology officer for VLSI
Technology, San Jose.

The problem, Payne feels, is that the industry still hasn't
caught on. "The modes in which people talk about technology
have been turned into meaningless marketing hype," Payne said.
"We need a new way to talk about the technology that is more
meaningful to our customers."

He especially takes exception when ASIC vendors boast about
their feature size while keeping their metal pitch-the measure
of interconnect density-under wraps.

"Anybody that discloses process technology and doesn't disclose
their interconnect hasn't disclosed anything," he said. "For
someone to claim they are a member of the 0.25-micron generation
while they have metal pitches that barely qualify them for
0.35-micron is ludicrous.

"If guys were to throw around financial numbers with the same
degree of casual claims, it would land them in court with the
SEC," he said. "This isn't harmless marketing mischief."

What the industry needs, he said, is a new set of benchmarks
for submicron designs in order to keep everyone honest. That
means putting an end to quoting how many gates can be stuffed
on a 4-sq.-cm die area when most customers would dare not touch
a chip that large. Furthermore, vendors should quit padding
their gate counts by including memory gates, which are more
dense than logic gates, he said.

Joyce Putscher, analyst at In-Stat Inc., Scottsdale, Ariz.,
agreed that there are "new rules" governing process technology
at the deep submicron level.

"I think [VLSI has] made some valid points," she said. "They
obviously believe that the industry needs new benchmarks and
they are making a good case for that."

But some observers noted that VLSI is also trying to undermine
LSI Logic Corp., one of VLSI's chief rivals in cell-based design,
a technology that enables ASIC vendors to stitch together different
logic cores on a single chip. LSI Logic recently announced
a 0.25-micron process technology, while VLSI uses a 0.35-micron
process that it co-developed with Hitachi.

Steve Roddy, product manager for LSI Logic, Milpitas, Calif.,
agreed that connecting up to five metal layers on a die presents
a fundamental problem for ICs.

Though Roddy indicated that LSI's metal pitch for 0.35-micron
and 0.25-micron design rules equals or surpasses those from
VLSI, he would not disclose actual specifications. The company
does share metal-pitch information with its customers, he noted.

And though benchmarks may have some usefulness, they only can
go so far. More important is how closely an ASIC vendor can
work with the customer, Roddy said.

"Many of our customers have very extensive questions. We will
go through months-long evaluations with them on the technology."

ASML In Deep UV Stepper Set

By:
Jack Robertson

Washington - ASM Lithography, Veldhoven, the Netherlands, next
week will unveil its first deep ultraviolet wafer stepper to
jump into the fray for 0.25-micron-resolution systems.

ASML joins perennial Japanese lithography rivals Nikon and Canon,
which introduced deep UV steppers earlier and are already sold
out on quarter-micron systems for 1996.

All three use a krypton fluorine 248-nanometer wavelength excimer
laser to achieve the 0.25-micron line geometry resolution.
All three use the deep UV illumination with the traditional
step-and-repeat lithography process.

In addition, Nikon has introduced a step-and-scan deep UV machine,
which industry sources said has been tested at Intel and is
under evaluation for the 256-Mbit DRAM joint venture of IBM,
Toshiba, and Siemens at IBM's facility in East Fishkill, N.Y.

Richard George, manager of the ASML deep UV stepper program,
said his company will unveil the PAS5500/300 excimer-laser
system, and claimed it has the industry's fastest processing
rate. The system is said to process more than 80 200-mm wafers
an hour at quarter-micron resolution.

Silicon Valley Group Lithography, Wilton, Conn., uses a mercury
lamp for its deep UV step-and-scan Micrascan-II system, which
can reach 0.3-micron resolution. SVGL claims Micrascan-II can
reach quarter-micron line widths for some R&D laboratory processing.
The company also is developing an excimer-laser version for
a Micrascan-III system for production-level quarter-micron
processing. No introduction date has been set.

Yoshinoir Hariu, international marketing manager for Nikon's
IC and LCD Equipment Division, Tokyo, said lithography suppliers
have been surprised by the strong demand for deep UV steppers.
Nikon has more than 50 orders for excimer-laser steppers, inundating
production, he said.

"Deliveries are stretched out to 20 months," he said. "Although
Nikon is expanding its own production as rapidly as possible,
we don't see [it] catching up with the big demand for deep
UV steppers before 1998."

Philip Ware, a U.S. marketing manager for Canon Inc., concurred
that the initial rush of orders for deep UV steppers carries
the company into 1997.

All agreed that just meeting the deep UV stepper demands of
existing longtime chip-maker customers precludes them from
taking on new accounts for any significant orders. Nikon's
Hariu said it is agonizing to be forced to defer potential
new customers, "but we must serve our traditional customers
first."

Even with the surge in deep UV stepper orders, the equipment
makers expect continued strong demand in traditional I-line
optical steppers. "Deep UV tools will be used for critical
quarter-micron layers of a wafer, which may be only three or
four layers at most. All the remaining noncritical layers will
use I-line steppers. We will be selling as many or more I-steppers
as ever, through the turn of the century," said Canon's Ware.

Hariu of Nikon agreed. Nikon shipped 450 I-line steppers worldwide
in the fiscal year ended March 31, 1995, a 50% increase over
the previous fiscal year.

Briefs: MRS Technology Seeks Investor



MRS Technology, Chelmsford, Mass., is seeking an investment
partner to help fund development of next-generation systems.
The maker of flat-panel display lithography steppers said it
had failed to sell a single lithography system in the last
quarter, and hasn't sold a system in the current quarter.

MRS has sold its systems to most U.S. flat-panel developers,
including AT&T Bell Laboratories, Xerox Palo Alto Research
Park, the IBM LCD research program at Watson Research Laboratories,
OIS Optical Imaging Systems, and Image Quest Technology.

Japanese panel makers, however, have largely shunned MRS, instead
buying lithography systems from Japanese suppliers Nikon and
Canon. MRS earlier sold several steppers to Hitachi and another
unidentified Japanese producer for development laboratories.

In other U.S. FPD equipment activity, Watkins-Johnson Co. Flat
Panel Display Operations, Scotts Valley, Calif., named David
Leksell manager of process systems. He was commercialization
manager for Westinghouse Microsystems, Pittsburgh. Leksell
also was a founder of Panelvision Corp., a U.S. pioneer in
active-matrix LCD development.

Briefs: Electroglas Sells System To Motorola



Electroglas Inc., Santa Clara, Calif., has installed its Horizon
4060X automatic wafer probing system at Motorola Semiconductor
Products Group's ultrathin 6-in. wafer line in Phoenix.

The new Motorola wafers, as thin as 120 microns, are used in
the company's cellular telephone and pager products. Richard
Earle, Motorola's manager of manufacturing operations for the
new line, said wafer prober handling is extremely critical
because of the very fragile nature of the wafers.

The Horizon 4060X uses an automated handling system with up
to three wafer cassettes, and links the probe tester to a computer
network of tester application packages and factory information
management.

1996 Picture Unclear For Indies

By:
Barbara Jorgensen and Darrell Dunn

Boston - Predictions of a more balanced supply and demand picture
this year have independent distributors hedging on their business
expectations for 1996.

In general, independents-which thrive during periods of shortage
are expecting high demand to continue. Some, however, noted
a correction at the end of last year that indicated the seller's
market of 1995 may be at an end.

"We've seen a correction in supply and demand that has been
so out of balance for so long," said Michael Benjamin Galinksi,
chairman of American II Group, Clearwater, Fla. November was
a particularly hard month for many independents, Galinksi said.
His company has had to become more proactive.

"There were times in 1995 where our sales reps didn't have 10
minutes an hour to make an outgoing phone call," he said. "We're
having to reverse our strategy a bit and spend more time making
those outgoing calls."

Galinski believes that independents will see consolidation if
the market becomes more competitive. "There is going to be
somewhat of a shakeout in the industry. The strong will survive
and be very profitable, and others who can't compete are going
to get run out of the industry. If you look around, you'll
see a lot of independents scrambling to stay afloat. They're
trying to get into passives, or tantulum capacitors, or crystal
oscillators, or even sports memorabilia."

Leland Ackerley, vice president of Smith & Associates, Houston,
is anticipating a slowdown in 1996. The company saw tremendous
sales growth since 1994, but "we have reservations about the
climate for next year. We're not sure how it's going to shake
out."

Memory and other commodity products are going to become more
readily available in 1996, Ackerley said. And like Galinski,
Ackerley foresees a market that will drive some players out.
"There are almost an infinite number of independent distributors
right now, many of which have just started in the past year.
In the past, when business turns down, the best ones survive."

Others maintain there will be enough business to go around,
and have higher expectations for 1996. "We see the market continuing
to be healthy," said Susan Humerian, general manager of Commodity
Components International Inc., Peabody, Mass. Although lead
times for power MOSFETs and discretes recently have decreased,
"we're still moving a lot of them," she said.

For microprocessors, price and margin pressure will continue.
"They are truly a commodity and buyers know the price to the
penny," she said.

"Obviously [additional fab] capacity will be a factor next year,"
Humerian pointed out, "but there's always something that suffers.
If suppliers put money into a wafer fab for memory, something
else will be short."

Universal Integrated Circuits, Carol Stream, Ill., saw business
drop precipitously at the end of 1995, said president Hamilton
Rice. "I think it's because of the holiday. People were gearing
down because they manufactured all the stuff they needed. By
the end of January, things will be gearing up and we'll start
seeing the same trends [as last year]."

But leftover components following the holiday-related product
manufacturing could be a problem for independents if OEMs dump
them into the channel.

The last few months of 1995 were a boom for Advanced MP Technology,
San Clemente, Calif. "We haven't had any setback," said Kamran
Malek, corporate vice president. Richard Kwartek, vice president
of sales, expects 1996 to be strong. "Our customers are forecasting
tremendous growth in 1996. The economy will be strong: interest
rates are going down. Our customers are bullish."

But no matter which way the economy goes, Advanced MP is counting
on the inherent imperfections of the industry to keep independents
in business. "One major factor is JIT [just-in-time]," Kwartek
said. "If manufacturers have experienced an upturn, the organizations
out there are not in tune, and that kicks everything into hell."

The DRAM Price Balloon Pops, Finally

By:
Anthony Cataldo

San Mateo, Calif. - Buyers can take heart: The days of paying
inflated prices for commodity DRAMs appear to be over.

In stark contrast to last summer's DRAM price peak, open-market
costs for 4-Mbit parts in every flavor, as well as the more
rare 1-M16 parts, have dropped over the past several months,
thanks to OEMs dumping excess inventories into the nonfranchised
market.

But before taking a hard-line stance when negotiating the next
volume purchase from an independent, buyers should be aware
that faster extended data out (EDO) parts are still in high
demand and holding their value.

Prices for 4-Mbit parts have fallen from about $15 a month ago
down to between $3 and $4, said Rudy Hartmann, vice president
of sales for Leo Electronics Inc., Torrance, Calif. Although
sales are generally stagnant during the end of the year, prices
have taken more of a beating this time around, he said.

A similar situation is taking shape at the San Jose branch of
Classic Components Corp., where the price for a standard 4
Mbit has dipped from about $19 to $13 during the past several
months.

"There's a lot more product available and prices have gone down
a tad," said Jason Croteau, purchasing agent for Classic, Gardena,
Calif.

As for the moribund 1-Mbit parts, it is a fire sale. "One-Mbits
have dropped even more because they are becoming marginally
used," said Leo Electronics' Hartmann.

Several forces have helped push prices down, although observers
differ on which should be given the most credit. In general,
the quick switch to faster EDO parts, disappointing sales of
Windows 95, a yen-to-dollar exchange rate correction, and over
optimistic PC sales forecasts are commonly cited.

The rapid transition to EDO DRAMs was sparked by Intel's introduction
of the EDO-compatible Triton chip set, which spurred the Santa
Clara, Calif., company to buy large volumes of EDO parts for
use in its motherboards. In response, memory vendors shifted
their production lines in favor of the faster parts, said Jim
Handy, analyst at Dataquest Inc., San Jose.

"Intel is a phenomenally large DRAM consumer," he said. "When
somebody that major switches over, there's always a hiccup.
This is the hiccup."

Handy also said DRAM costs have softened recently because suppliers
are feeling pressure from customers to reduce prices next quarter
now that $1 can again buy more than 100 yen.

Others said OEMs have been forced to sell excess DRAM because
sales of Windows 95, which was supposed to cause a surge in
memory upgrades, were not as strong as expected.

The price drops are causing anxiety among brokers, who rely
heavily on DRAM sales. Recent price drops for flash and cache
RAM devices have made it even more difficult, Hartmann said.

That means that Leo Electronics, which garners about 40% of
its sales from DRAMs, will have to delay until next year any
decisions to expand or add staff, Hartmann said.

"Everyone-even the big boys-are nervous about picking up any
quantities of DRAMs," he said.

Brokers said that for now, they can only keep buying DRAMs and
hope that prices will not drop any further. There is already
some indication that prices are beginning to plateau, they
said.

Almost One-Quarter Of OEMs Sell To Independents



Almost one-quarter of the OEMs surveyed by EBN for its annual
Customer Issues In Distribution report said they sell surplus
components to nonfranchised or independent distributors. OEMs
that do so indicate these are components that cannot be returned
to their supplier or distributor, although anecdotal evidence
suggests that allocated and hard-to-find parts also find their
way into the independent channel.

A Telesales Sampler



Following is a sampling of sales and support programs provided
by large distributors.

Marshall Industries, El Monte, Calif.: Marshall has a variety
of options for customers and does not classify them by size.
Marshall has had a telesales operation for about six years,
but also provides service through a 24-hour service center
and the Internet. "We don't pay commissions to our salespeople,
so we don't spend an inordinate amount of time classifying
our customers," said president and chief executive Robert Rodin.

Telemarketing is a demand-creation center for the entire company,
and accounts may be supported by field sales as well.

Wyle Electronics Inc., Irvine, Calif.: Wyle has a dedicated
telesales group in Santa Clara, Calif., and in Boston, serving
their respective regions, and a third group in Utah. The distributor
also offers support through a "technical select" program offering
quick fax responses for technical data requests. "We try to
profile customer needs and supplement that with outside sales,"
said Ralph Ozorkiewicz, president and chief executive. Wyle
also has an account development program, and Ozorkiewicz stresses
flexibility in customer service.

TTI Inc., Fort Worth, Texas: TTI's teleservices is the fastest
growing portion of TTI's business, according to Craig Conrad,
vice president and director of sales. Small or new customers
are usually handled by teleservices to allow branches to focus
on existing customers. TTI dedicated a group to new or emerging
accounts two and a half years ago to support customers that
did business with TTI but were not getting adequate service
and account development.

Teleservices has reported 99% on- time delivery and its first
call response is also very high, Conrad said. Reps are also
trained in product knowledge

Pioneer-Standard Electronics Inc., Cleveland: The company confirmed
it has a dedicated group for small and emerging accounts, but
details were unavailable by press time.

Arrow Electronics Inc., Melville, N.Y.: The distributor offers
small and emerging customer-support programs, but declines
to discuss them.
