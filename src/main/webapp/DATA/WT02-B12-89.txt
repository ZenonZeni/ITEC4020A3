CFS 1.0.4 Unix Cryptographic File System source code now available  -- thought you all would be interested in tech progress on this front .. djf] <p>

From: mab@research.att.com (Matt Blaze) <p>

Source code for version 1.0 of CFS, the Cryptographic File System, is
now available upon request for research and experimental use in the US
and Canada. <p>

CFS pushes encryption services into the Unix(tm) file system.  It
supports secure storage at the system level through a standard Unix
file system interface to encrypted files.  Users associate a
cryptographic key with the directories they wish to protect.  Files in
these directories (as well as their pathname components) are
transparently encrypted and decrypted with the specified key without
further user intervention; cleartext is never stored on a disk or sent
to a remote file server.  CFS employs a novel combination of DES
stream and codebook cipher modes to provide high security with good
performance on a modern workstation.  CFS can use any available file
system for its underlying storage without modification, including
remote file servers such as NFS.  System management functions, such as
file backup, work in a normal manner and without knowledge of the key. <p>

CFS runs under SunOS and several other BSD-derived systems with NFS.
It is implemented entirely at user level, as a local NFS server
running on the client machine's "loopback" interface.  It consists of
about 5000 lines of code and supporting documentation.  You must have
"root" access to install CFS. <p>

CFS was first mentioned at the work-in-progress session at the Winter
'93 USENIX Conference and was more fully detailed in: <p>

Matt Blaze, "A Cryptographic File System for Unix", Proc. 1st ACM
    Conference on Computer and Communications Security, Fairfax, VA,
    November 1993. (PostScript available by anonymous ftp from
    research.att.com in the file dist/mab/cfs.ps. <p>

The version being released differs from the version described in the
paper in a few ways: <p>

* The encryption scheme has been strengthened, and now provides
approximately the security of 3-DES with the online latency of only
single-DES. <p>

* Support for the smartcard-based key management system is not
included. <p>

* A few of the tools are not included (in particular, cname and ccat). <p>

* The performance has been improved. <p>

* The security of the system against certain non-cryptanalytic attacks
has been improved somewhat. <p>

CFS is being distributed as a research prototype; it is COMPLETELY
UNSUPPORTED software.  No warranty of any kind is provided.  We will
not be responsible if the system deletes all your files and emails the
cleartext directly to the NSA or your mother.  Also, we do not have
the resources to port the software to other platforms, although you
are welcome to do this yourself.  The software was developed under
SunOS and BSDI, and there are also unsupported user-contributed ports
available for AIX, HP/UX, Irix, Linux, Solaris and Ultrix.  We really
can't promise to provide any technical support at all, beyond the
source code itself.  We also maintain a mailing list for CFS users and
developers; subscription information is included with the source code. <p>

Because of export restrictions on cryptographic software, we are only
able to make the software available within the US and Canada to US and
Canadian citizens and permanent residents.  Unfortunately, we cannot
make it available for general anonymous ftp or other uncontrolled
access, nor can we allow others to do so.  Sorry. <p>
