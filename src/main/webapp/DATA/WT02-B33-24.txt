DOWNSELECT LEAVES SH-2G AND LYNX TO COMPETE FOR RNZN HELO ORDER

    As expected, the results of the New Zealand Ministry of Defence's
downselect leave Kaman Aerospace and Westland Helicopters to compete
for the 
Royal New Zealand Navy's six-ship, $120-million helicopter
procurement.
    Eliminated in the downselect were Sikorsky Aircraft and Eurocopter.
    The competitors, informed of the result of the downselect last
month via a letter from the New Zealand Ministry of Defence, are to
submit best and final offers in late February.
    The outcome of the New Zealand downselect will likely extend beyond
the Royal New Zealand Navy's (RNZN) relatively small buy, because the
RNZN is cooperating with the Royal Australian Navy (RAN), which also
has a requirement for medium helicopters. The result may also
influence Malaysia's naval helicopter procurement.
    The RAN plans to buy helicopters which can operate from its ANZAC-
class frigates and the proposed Offshore Patrol Combatant (OPC). The
request for tenders, issued in late October, calls for delivery of 14
helicopters for the frigates, with the possibility of an additional
nine aircraft for the OPCs.
    The value of the Australian contract is expected to be about $500
million.                                                                                                             
    Malaysia, which is jointly developing the OPCs with Australia, is
expected to buy at least six naval helicopters to replace its obsolete
Westland Wasps.
    Sales efforts by both Sikorsky and Eurocopter were made more
difficult by factors not related to the performance of the aircraft on
offer.
    Sikorsky's chances were widely seen to be diminished by problems
experienced by the Australian army's 39-ship Black Hawk fleet, which
included airframe cracks, corrosion problems and a lack of spares.
Sikorsky was reportedly offering a naval version of the S-76.
    Eurocopter would have been a difficult choice in New Zealand
because of opposition to the French government's ongoing nuclear
testing in the region.
    New Zealand will conduct a limited evaluation of the two
competitors while best and final offers are being processed. A
contract award is scheduled for April, following parliamentary
approval of the Defence Ministry's selection.
    For both the New Zealand and Australia competitions, Westland is
offering a Lynx variant. Kaman Aerospace [KAMNA], is offering the SH-
2G.

ATLANTA CONTRACT AWARD SCHEDULED FOR NEXT WEEK

    Bids from helicopter operators pitching to fly air courier services
around Atlanta during this summer's Olympic Games are expected Jan. 8,
with the organizers hoping to make a decision by Jan. 12, says Chuck
Stancil of Georgia Tech Research Institute (GTRI).
    GTRI is acting as prime contractor on behalf of the Federal
Aviation Administration for the Atlanta Short Haul Transportation
System (ASTS), a demonstration project aimed at validating the use of
helicopter services in the Atlanta region during the Games.
    A bidder's conference, held Dec. 7, drew responses from five
operators, sources tell Helicopter News. They are: Air Logistics,
Petroleum Helicopters Inc., Evergreen, Era Aviation, and OmniFlight.
    Operators are being asked to commit to carriage of between 1.6
million and 1.9 million pounds of air freight during the 17-day
period. The Games begin on July 19.                                                                                  
    The freight--in the form of small overnight packages--is being
provided by a consortium of carriers including UPS, Federal Express
and the U.S. Postal Service. The carriers--who have formed into a
cooperative group for ASTS--will be subsidized on a 90 percent return
basis from the FAA for their participation in the project.
    The object of the program is to establish feedback from the
day-to-day business  operations "so we can show that helicopters make
economic sense in this type of environment," Stancil says. GRTI is
undertaking a major analysis of ASTS operations to establish a
baseline for "looking afresh" at helicopter transportation in an urban
environment.
    During the package carrying operations the helicopters will use a
communications, navigation and surveillance (CNS) GPS/data link system
for flight following, dispatch and weather information contributed by
ARNAV Systems Inc., for the project.
    Of the five operators bidding, PHI recently signed up as a user of
similar equipment--ARNAV's System Six hardware. Whether this will give
the company an edge in the Atlanta competition is not clear.
    Meanwhile, Stancil dismissed some industry grumbling about what
Textron's announcement that it has become a sponsor of the Olympics
means, and will bring 19 Bell helicopters to the Games. "We had plenty
of warning this was happening, so we knew what to expect," Stancil
said. Some of the Bell machines will be fitted with the ARNAV
equipment "so they can, in effect, be part of the ASTS data collection
effort," he added.

V-22 EMD EFFORT ON COURSE FOR DECEMBER FIRST FLIGHT

    Current projections--backed up by actual parts flowing from
pre-production processes--show that the V-22 Osprey is now weighing
nearly 1,300 pounds under the empty weight figures specified in the
contract between the U.S. Navy and Bell Boeing, a 1995 year-end check
on progress shows. 
    "We have about 50 percent of the aircraft which is now 'actual'
parts with known weights," says Stuart Dodge, Director of the Joint
Program Office (JPO) in Washington, D.C. "They all conformed to our
predictions. It shows we have the weight projections nailed down."
    Dodge recently told JPO employees in a Christmas letter that the
weight savings have exceeded--by over a factor of two--the target
weights set by the Bell Boeing manufacturing team themselves.
    "It's directly related to the advanced production processes in use.
Put simply, they minimize errors and guarantee first time results,"
Dodge said in a follow-up interview with Helicopter News.
    Dodge--who credits pioneering work done with the Boeing 777
airliner with the production process success--says the first EMD
(Engineering, Manufacturing and Development) Osprey fuselage was
recently mated to its wing structure "with the tap of a rubber
mallet."
    This operation--which brought the Boeing Helicopters Div., fuselage
together with wings manufactured by Bell Helicopter Textron in
Arlington, Texas,--represented an important milestone for the project.
    "It qualified us to begin giving out advanced long-lead contracts
to vendors for the first Osprey production equipment items," he said.
    Go-ahead for the first, or low rate initial production (LRIP),
parts will follow the first flight of this aircraft set for December
of this year. It will be the seventh V-22, but the first built to
production-level specifications.
    "Everything hangs on meeting that [first flight] commitment," Dodge
said.
    The stakes are high. With this flight complete, the government will
formally begin the process of buying 523 V-22s it has contracted for
(425 for the Marine Corps, 48 for the Navy and 50 for the Special
Operations Command.)
    First deliveries--to the Marines--are set for 1999, Dodge said.
    Costs of the program show a similar story to the one on weight, he
said, with the first EMD aircraft now exhibiting a "recurring flyaway"
cost estimate of $32.5-million per aircraft. Dodge said this is on
track to meeting its the target price goal of $29.4-million (in FY '94
dollars.) A cost reduction program under assessment has the potential
of reducing this to $28.1 million.
    Costs will also be affected by an expected decision sometime this
year to buy Ospreys on an multi-year procurement (MYP) basis. The MYP
is expected to call for producing three aircraft per month, which
could reduce unit flyaway costs by as much as $3-million per aircraft,
Dodge said.

NAVY COMPLETES MH-53, MAGIC LANTERN INSTALLATION

    The Navy's Coastal Systems Command, Panama City, Fla., last month
completed installation and initial testing of the Magic Lantern
shallow water mine detection system onboard a MH-53 helicopter.
    The initial testing was successful, according to an industry
official. Magic Lantern is built by Kaman Aerospace. Further testing
of the MH-53/Magic Lantern will be conducted this summer.
    Once operational, Magic Lantern will be installed on Naval Reserve
SH-2G helicopters, based at Willow Grove, Pa. Kaman is working now on
integrating the system into the SH-2G, work which should be completed
by June. Previously, the system was used on the "F" model H-2.
    The Navy currently has two Magic Lantern systems and funding for a
third is provided for in DoD's FY '96 appropriations.
    Magic Lantern projects a blue-green laser into the water to locate
targets. The targets are recorded and sent back to the system for 
image and signal processing. An aided target recognizer (ATR),
essentially an intensive set of processing algorithms, is applied to
the image to establish details of the target's identification.
    The system was developed as an "in-house" research project at
Kaman, and an earlier version was deployed successfully during the
Gulf War.

MARINE CORPS FORESEES OSPREY, JAST AND RPV MIX

    A U.S. Marine Corps concept for a future air/ground task force
foresees employment of nearly 200 V-22 Ospreys as the mainstay of the
aviation element.
    The infantry-carrying version--the MV-22--will account for 120 of
the Ospreys. In addition, 36 will fly in the utility/observation role,
and a further 36 in the "attack" role.
    The plan, oriented well into the future, foresees the
package--known as a Marine Air Ground Task Force (MAGTF)--operating
the Ospreys alongside 140 Joint Advanced Strike Technology (JAST)
V/STOL aircraft. The MAGTF would also be supported by 42 heavy lift
helicopters, as well as 30 multi-purpose remotely piloted vehicles
(RPVs).
    This outline--which introduces two significantly new variants of
the V-22 into the planning process--is part of a new "alternate
structure" for the MAGTF being discussed in the new Sea Dragon
technology exploitation program announced by Marine Corps Commandant
Gen. Charles Krulak last month.
    In that initiative, the Corps will also pursue a major effort to
introduce automated--unmanned--rotary-wing craft into its aviation
structure.
    Col. Tony Wood, director of the Commandant's Warfighting Lab at
Quantico, Va., challenged industry to fly a 6,000 pound payload
unmanned helicopter in tests scheduled for February 1997.
    An outline of possible future force structure for the MAGTF
suggests that, in addition to the Ospreys, RPVs will play an
increasing role in resupply, observation and weapons targeting roles.

HELO PROGRAMS UNLIKELY TO BE IMPACTED BY AUTHORIZATION BILL VETO

    Defense authorization conferees, after months of deadlock, wrapped
up work on their FY '96 defense bill Dec. 13, but the measure was
vetoed by President Clinton, who objects to Congress providing DoD
with $7 billion above the administration's request.
    Although the bill, which provides DoD with $264.7 billion in budget
authority and $262.1 billion in outlays, will undergo revision before
again going to the White House, major DoD helicopter programs are
unlikely to be affected by those revisions.
    Details of the authorization bill are below. See pages 4-5 for
complete details of appropriations for DoD helicopter and helicopter-
related programs.

HELICOPTER INDUSTRY DEVELOPMENTS TO WATCH IN 1996

         Here are our choices for the 10 most important developments to
watch for in the coming year, in no particular order. Some items that
almost made the list: an Army CH-47 upgrade program; the
revitalization of the domestic oil and gas industry and a long-term
vertical replenishment contract for the K-Max.

1.       Naval Helicopter Procurements in Australia and New Zealand. The
         focus in 1995 was attack helicopters in Europe. This year, the
         most closely watched naval competitions will be in the Pacific
         Rim. Again, the competition will include at least four airframes,
         but only two have a real chance, the Kaman SH-2G Super Seasprite
         and the Westland Super Lynx.

2.       Introduction of the Bell Boeing Civil Tiltrotor. Expect the V-22
         team to introduce an 11-place civil tiltrotor based on the XV-15
         concept demonstrator design. Assuming Bell and Boeing can work
         out the details, the announcement could come as early as Heli-
         Expo '95 in February. But smart money is on the project being
         revealed at NBAA in October.

3.       Industry Consolidation. Everyone says its coming. But that's what
         everybody said in 1995. The most likely scenario, nothing
         changes. The second most likely scenario: a combination of Boeing
         and McDonnell Douglas' helicopter units. If that fails, watch for
         Sikorksy to join the fray.

4.       Canadian Helicopter Buy. Another tight competition. Too early to
         pick a front-runner, but the winning bid needs to be long on
         creative financing.

5.       Approval of the Marine Corps' 4BN/4BW Plan. Gen. Bob Magnus, the
         Deputy Assistant Chief of Staff for Aviation says we should have
         a thumbs up or down this summer on the Corps' $2 billion
         Huey/Cobra modernization effort. 

6.       First Flight of an EMD V-22. More importantly, look for a debate-
         -and decision this summer--on accelerating production to 36
         aircraft per year.

7.       The Digitization of the U.S. Army's Helicopter Fleet. By the
         Army's rules, the initial lot of aircraft must be completed by
         mid-June for the Army's Force XXI trials.                           

8.       British Training Helicopter. Will the British throw the Europeans
         a bone, after buying American (the Apache and the C-130J) in
         1995? The contest is between Bell and Eurocopter, with Schweizer
         running on the outside.

9.       HAI and the Atlanta Olympic Games. HAI and the industry's best
         opportunity ever to prove the efficacy of the helicopter in the
         urban environment.

10.      A New Light Twin from Bell? Look for Bell, which quietly
         abandoned plans for a twin-engine version of the new 407, to
         launch a light twin to compete with the Eurocopter EC-135 and the
         MDHS Explorer.

     Again the big news is the disastrous decline of new turbine
helicopter sales to the U.S. based operators. After deducting new
turbine helicopters exported and new helicopters purchased for resale
from the FAA registered sale total of 161 units we are down to just 49
units for the U.S. operator. That's about one new helicopter a week
for what is supposed to be the largest commercial market in the world.
