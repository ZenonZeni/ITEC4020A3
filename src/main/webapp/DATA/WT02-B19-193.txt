<h2>About CEC Publications</h2>
</B></U><BR>
<B>What is CEC?</B><br>     The Council for Exceptional Children (CEC) is the largest international professional organization dedicated to improving educational outcomes for individuals with exceptionalities (students with disabilities and/or the gifted).  CEC advocates for appropriate governmental policies, sets professional standards, provides continual professional development, advocates for newly and historically underserved individuals with exceptionalities, and helps professionals obtain conditions and resources necessary for effective professional practice. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Services 
Provided</B> <BR>Professional development opportunities and resources.<BR>
               17 divisions for specialized information.     <BR>
               Journals and newsletters with information on new research findings,   classroom practices that  work, federal legislation, and policies.<BR>
Conventions and conferences.<BR>
               Special education publications.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Philosophy</B><br>     The Publications Program of The Council for Exceptional Children is designed to support its mission through a variety of print and nonprint channels. The mission statement says:<BR>
The worldwide mission of The Council for Exceptional Children is to improve the educational outcomes for individuals with exceptionalities.  CEC, a nonprofit association, accomplishes its mission, which is carried out in support of special education professionals and others working on behalf of individuals with exceptionalities, by advocating for appropriate governmental policies, setting professional standards, providing continuing professional development, and helping professionals achieve the conditions and resources necessary for effective professional practice.<BR>
<BR>
Because CEC's fundamental mission is to improve educational outcomes for individuals with exceptionalities, CEC must be an active force for assuring that there is a highly qualified cadre of professionals with the knowledge, skills, resources, and conditions necessary to practice effectively. CEC's Publications Program supports this mission through a coordinated effort with its policy, standards, and training components.<BR>
<BR>
<B><BR>
Readership</B> <br> CEC's publications are targeted to appeal to all segments of the population that deal with the education of children and youth with exceptionalities. Teachers, administrators, students, parents, related support service providers, and members of the higher education and research community are all among our audiences. Our publications are used by both special educators and general educators as well as government and legislative officials, psychologists, pediatricians, and community leaders. <BR>
<P>
<B>Publications</B><br> CEC provides the following publishing options:<BR>
<I>               Exceptional Children<BR>
               TEACHING Exceptional Children<BR>
CEC Today<BR>
</I>               Books and nonprint media<BR>
<BR>
<I>Exceptional Children</I> is published four times per year.  Its focus is on original research on the education and development of exceptional infants, toddlers, children, and youth, as well as articles on professional issues of concern to special educators.  The journal welcomes manuscripts reflecting qualitative or quantitative methodologies using group or single subject research designs.  Articles appropriate for publication include data-based research, data-based position papers, research integration papers, and systematic analyses of policy or practice. <BR>
<BR>
<I>TEACHING Exceptional Children</I>, published six times per year, is a journal designed specifically for teachers, administrators, and other practitioners who work with children and youth with disabilities or who are gifted. Articles that deal with practical methods and materials for classroom use are featured.  While not research oriented, this journal welcomes those databased descriptions that specify techniques, equipment, and procedures for teachers' application.  A feature of <I>TEC</I> is the Special Focus Section.  Articles in this section are generally solicited from professionals who are known to be working in the area.  Procedures are in place to encourage new authors to write for <I>TEC</I>.<BR>
<BR>
<I>CEC Today</I>, is published 10 times per year and is designed to provide up-to-date news to members. This newsletter is only available to CEC members and is considered a member benefit. It provides opportunities for authors to express their views in its regular "Speaking Out" section, which features viewpoints on current issues of concern.<B>     <BR>
<BR>
</B>Books and nonprint media include print, video, audio, diskette, CD-ROM, or combinations of these components. Products developed or selected for distribution through CEC are chosen to support a broad but well-defined set of objectives and meet the criteria of our mission.<BR>
<BR>
<B><BR>
Contractual 
Agreements</B> <br>     Authors of all articles published by CEC are required to sign agreement forms and transfer ownership rights; formal contracts are drawn up for books and monographs. These cover any royalties, agreed-upon subsidy arrangements, the author's free copy entitlement and standard discount, transfer of rights to CEC, initial guaranteed distribution, and subsidiary rights.<BR>

<h2>Books and Media Program</h2>
<BR>
<B>Types of Products</B><BR> CEC publishes and distributes products designed to help practitioners work more effectively in the classroom including effective teaching strategies and curriculum materials. CEC also publishes training materials in the form of self-contained workshops including supportive media, assessment tools, analysis products on emerging trends and issues, special education policy documents, and other products that support professional standards of practice.<BR>
<BR>
CEC's publication niche is structured around eight areas of knowledge and skills which include: <P>
  1. Philosophical, Historical, and Legal Foundations of Special                      Education <BR>
  2. Characteristics of Learners<BR>
  3. Assessment, Diagnosis, and Evaluation<BR>
  4. Instructional Content and Practice<BR>
  5. Planning and Managing the Teaching and Learning Environment<BR>
  6. Managing Student Behavior and Social Interaction Skills<BR>
  7. Communication and Collaborative Partnerships<BR>
  8. Professionalism and Ethical Practices<BR>
<BR>
CEC aims to maintain a balance between products that will be of high interest to many individuals who work with students with exceptionalities, and those that will serve fewer educators who have more focused information needs.  We also try to maintain a balance between products priced to meet the needs of individual purchasers, with higher priced product packages that will be used by whole schools or programs.  <BR>
<BR>
<B>Submissions</B> <BR>    CEC has an open submissions policy and seeks manuscripts and media from the field on a wide variety of issues. We seek to publish original work that is easy to read and understand but at the same time is supported by research or empirical evidence beyond the author's opinion or experience. Although many of CEC's publications are used as supplemental texts in preservice and inservice training, CEC is not a major publisher of textbooks. CEC does not publish biographies, poetry, or
 fiction.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Authors are encouraged to be mindful that the purpose of CEC's publications program is not to publish all manuscripts that have merit but to select those that provide a unique contribution to the knowledge and practice base. The manuscript must conform to our editorial specifications and must be fiscally sound (cost effective to produce and marketable after the fact).  <BR>
<BR>
Before sending a manuscript or media product to CEC, authors are encouraged to send a proposal so that a determination can be made whether the proposed product will fit into our current publication plan. All proposals should be submitted to CEC with a cover letter that gives a brief summary of the author's expertise with the subject matter and a statement describing who the product is directed to, teachers, administrators, teachers in training. The proposal itself should be two to four pages in length, and should include details of the major topics or contents of each chapter or section.  Significant illustrations, figures, tables, or appendices should be described as part of the proposal.  Authors should also indicate the stage of development of the product, for example, is there a completed manuscript or media product, or has nothing yet been written or produced? The following questions should be used to guide your proposal:<BR>
<BR>
  1.  What is the general topic area(s) of your proposed product?<BR>
<BR>
  2.  How does the topic fit CEC's Knowledge and Skills?<BR>
<BR>
  3.  Who is the primary audience?<BR>
<BR>
  4.  What do you want them to learn?<BR>
<BR>
  5.  Why do you think there is a need for the product?<BR>
<BR>
  6.  What products are already available on this topic? How is yours              different?<BR>
<BR>
  7.  What is the source of the content?<BR>
<BR>
  8.  How will people use the product  (curriculum, reference, training            material)?<BR>
<BR>
  9. Why would CEC be the best publisher/disseminator for this                    product?<BR>
<P>
<B>Review Process</B><BR>          Once a product idea has been accepted and a manuscript or media product has been submitted, it goes through a blind review process (that is, the author's identity is unknown to the reviewers). Typically, three reviewers with expertise in the areas addressed by the manuscript are asked to review the manuscript.   Reviewers will evaluate the material on the basis of the importance of the topic, clarity, accuracy and validity of the content, value of the contribution to the professional literature, implications for special education, quality of the writing, attention to cultural and linguistic equity, and market potential.<BR>
<BR>
If a manuscript or media product has already been developed, the author will be requested to forward four copies, printed double-spaced, to CEC to be sent out for review.  The field review process takes approximately 2 to 3 months.  In addition to the field review, a financial analysis is done to estimate the costs of development and production as well as the marketability of the potential product.  Also determined at this stage is the proposed format and the projected price that will have to be charged, 
based on development and production costs. <p>

The recommendations of the reviewers are considered by the Director of Publications who makes a decision to (a) decline the opportunity to publish, (b) request a revision with a stipulation for further peer review, (c) request a revision subject to approval by CEC staff, or (d) accept as is. If the reviews are positive, and if the product can be priced competitively, CEC will approach the author with a publishing proposal.  If the proposal represents an idea for a product that has not yet been developed, 
the process would take a different route with details negotiated on a case-by-case bases.<p>

Generally, a manuscript goes through several stages of revision before it becomes a finished product.  Reviewers' comments and our own editorial judgments shape the product for maximum marketability.  Often title, format, and organizational changes are necessary.  CEC staff works closely with authors throughout the revision process.  The revised version of the product must be delivered to CEC on disk with two paper copies.<P>

<B>Publishing Options</B> <BR>   CEC offers many different publishing options including royalty agreements.  The most common royalty agreement provides a 10% royalty based on the net income from sales of the product.  An option is also available for authors to donate a portion of their royalties back to CEC as a charitable contribution. <P>

<B>Products Developed by Projects</B><BR> CEC is the host agency for a number of federally-funded projects.  Many of these projects are required to produce products.  CEC acts as the publisher for these products, and they are held to the same standards of accountability as all other products.  One difference between products developed by projects and those initiated by CEC rests in the relationship with the author(s).  Projects are free to negotiate whatever arrangement they wish with authors, including a set-fee payment for work, delivery of an agreed-upon number of free copies of the finished product to the author or collaborating agency, etc. <p>

Products developed by projects not housed at CEC are also encouraged to submit products to CEC for further development or distribution.  If a project believes their product may be suitable for inclusion in CEC's product line, it can be submitted to CEC and it will be considered in the same way as other potential products.  Projects that would like CEC's input during the planning stages of product development should contact CEC's Director of Publications to discuss the possibilities.<BR>
<P>
<B>Products Developed by CEC Divisions</B><BR>     
CEC is the parent organization for 17 divisions.  Each division has some kind of publishing program and several have long-standing, totally independent publishing operations.  Often, however, divisions work collaboratively with CEC to produce a publication of interest to a broader audience than can be reached by the division alone.  In such cases, CEC generally acts as the publisher and the division acts as the author.  Procedures outlined above are generally followed regarding product development, review, and author agreements, although other options may certainly be negotiated.
    In its attempt to meet the needs of CEC members and other regular product purchasers, CEC occasionally selects products for its catalog produced by other publishers. In such cases, products are subject to the same review process as other proposed products.  Catalogs of other publishers are reviewed regularly for potential items.  Publishers who would like to have a product considered for CEC distribution should write to the Director of Publications and include a distributor discount schedule.
