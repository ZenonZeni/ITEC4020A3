<B><FONT SIZE=4>Preface</FONT></B>
<P>
In the main, the Federation of Community Legal Centres is opposed
to police calls for additional powers in situations of domestic
violence.
<P>
In the three years since the introduction of the <I>Crimes (Family
Violence) Act</I> police have demonstrated a continued reluctance
to treat domestic violence as a serious crime and to initiate
action, appropriate to the crime, on behalf of victims.
<P>
The <I>Crimes (Family Violence) Act</I> clearly intended that
the police would take out the majority of intervention orders
to reduce financial and psychological pressure on the victim and
to demonstrate in the strongest possible way, that the community
does not condone domestic violence.
<P>
Of all orders taken out since proclamation of the Act in December
1987, the percentage initiated by police has never exceeded 3.5%.
 
<P>
 Dec '87 - Feb '89  1.8%
<P>
 June  1989   3.4%
<P>
 Feb  1990   2%
<P>
 July 1990   3.5%  (1)
<P>
The reluctance of police to utilise criminal law remedies, their
failure to use their existing powers of entry and arrest and to
charge perpetrators with assault has little to do with ambiguous
or inadequate powers.  As we have already noted, police also fail
to utilise the civil remedies available to them under the <I>Crimes
(Family Violence) Act</I>.  This reluctance to intervene at all
levels arises from their attitude toward domestic violence.  Assault
&quot;in the home&quot;, unlike assault on the street, is a low
priority and continues to be viewed as something apart from &quot;real&quot;
violence and &quot;real&quot; police work.
<P>
Workers in community legal centres hear numerous complaints from
victims of domestic violence about police failure to attend and
to act when they are in life threatening situations.  At the other
end of the spectrum, community legal workers can point to numerous
examples where police are only too prepared to <B>over-exercise
</B>their powers of arrest and charge, particularly against economically
disadvantaged young people and particularly with respect to minor
offences (ie. drunk and disorderly, loiter etc)(2).  Forced entry,
without a warrant, for minor offences against property is also
common. 
<P>
Both extremes would indicate problems in the way police choose
to exercise their discretion within the framework of their available
powers.  It demonstrates to us a fundamental lack of understanding
on the part of the police of the real nature of crime in our society,
of its underlying structural causes and of its impact on women.
<P>
Establishing clear guidelines for police performance and an <B>independent</B>
monitoring mechanism to evaluate police involvement would, in
our view, be of greater assistance to victims of domestic violence
in the long term.  The introduction of a legal duty on police
to act should also be canvassed.
<P>
Our specific comments on the recommendations put forward by the
Police Family Violence Project Office to amend the <I>Crimes (Family
Violence) Act</I> follow.
<P>
<U><B>AUTHORITY TO ENTER PREMISES</B></U>
<P>
<U><B>Police Recommendation</B></U>
<P>
1.    That the Crimes (Family Violence) Act 1987 be amended so
as to give police specific authority to enter premises where there
are reasonable grounds to investigate whether a family violence
incident has occurred, is occurring or is likely to occur, or
to prevent further violence.
<P>
This recommendation is opposed.
<P>
Existing police powers of entry, with or without a warrant, are
extensive.  Briefly, they are as follows : <BR>

<P>
 - without a warrant, if they are invited to do so by a person
who lives there.
<P>
 - without a warrant, under common law, if they have reasonable
grounds to believe that a breach of the peace is occurring or
is about to occur.
<P>
 - without a warrant, under s459A of the <I>Crimes Act</I>, to
arrest a person they believe on reasonable grounds has committed
or is committing a serious indictable offence.
<P>
 - police may forcibly enter premises to execute a warrant to
arrest.
<P>
 - under s18A of the <I>Crimes (Family Violence) Act</I>.
<P>
It is difficult to think of situations which might arise where
these powers are not sufficiently clear to enable police to lawfully
enter.  The example often used by police, where they are called
to a property by a neighbour and, upon arrival, are denied entry
by the perpetrator who assures them that all is well, is one in
which police could lawfully enter under their common law powers.
 Had the neighbour reported suspected possession of stolen goods
or a marijuana plant in the back yard, the police would have no
hesitation about entering.
<P>
In the absence of any demonstration by police of their preparedness
to actively assist women who are victims of domestic violence
- via the rigorous application of civil and criminal law remedies
in those instances, which we believe to be the majority of cases,
where their powers are beyond question - support for additional
powers can only be seriously questioned.<BR>

<P>
<U><B>AUTHORITY TO APPREHEND PERPETRATORS</B></U>
<P>
<U><B>Police Recommendations</B></U>
<P>
2. That the Crimes (Family Violence) Act 1987 be amended so as
to give police specific authority to take perpetrators into custody
where there is a reasonable belief that the personal safety of
the aggrieved family member is threatened or that damage is likely
to be caused to any property of the aggrieved family member unless
the perpetrator is brought into custody.
<P>
3. That such amendments be additional to and not in substitution
of common law provisions.
<P>
These recommendations are opposed.
<P>
While the Federation agrees that arrest is often the most appropriate
action for police to take in situations involving domestic violence
and therefore supports the need for police to exercise their existing
arrest powers more frequently in these situations, this is not
what this recommendation is about.  It would appear that what
police are seeking here is the power to apprehend and detain a
potential offender without charging.
<P>
Presently, police have the power to arrest with a warrant, and
without a warrant (under s458 &amp; 459 of the <I>Crimes Act</I>)
in the following circumstances :
<P>
 - in the case of a summary offence, where a person is found committing
the offence where the apprehension of that person is necessary
for (among other things) the preservation of public order, to
prevent the continuation or repetition of the offence and/or for
the safety or welfare of members of the public.
<P>
 - where police believe on reasonable grounds a person is committing
or has committed a serious indictable offence.
<P>
While on the face of it this amendment is appealing in that it
apparently offers victims an immediate form of protection, it
is outrageous when we consider the reluctance of police to arrest
perpetrators of domestic violence when an assault <B>has</B> taken
place!
<P>
In our experience, police do not appear to believe that the laws
prohibiting assault within the <I>Crimes Act</I> should be applied
when dealing with persons in a personal relationship and thus
refuse to lay criminal charges, even where there is evidence of
an assault.  When police attend domestic violence situations and
they discover evidence of other crimes they will often ignore
serious assault and investigate other crimes.
<P>
We are concerned that such an extension of police powers sets
a dangerous precedent and rides roughshod over one of our most
fundamental freedoms and civil liberties - that no person should
be held against his/her will without appearing before a court.
 This amendment implies that the person (perpetrator) will be
taken into custody but not  charged.  Because no  charge has been
laid, the person would not be brought before a justice.
<P>
This is clearly open to abuse.  
<P>
<U><B>INTERIM INTERVENTION ORDERS</B></U>
<P>
<U><B>Police Recommendations</B></U>
<P>
4. That sections 8(1) and 8(2) of the Crimes (Family Violence)
Act 1987 be amended by substituting the words &quot;A Magistrate
or Children's Court Magistrate or, in the event that it is not
practicable to obtain the services of a Magistrate or Children's
Court Magistrate, the principal registrar or a deputy registrar&quot;
for the words &quot;A court&quot; where those words appear in
the sections.
<P>
5. That the Crimes (Family Violence) Act 1987 be amended to allow
the principal registrar, registrar or deputy registrar to issue
interim intervention orders.
<P>
6. That the Crimes (Family Violence) Act 1987 be amended to allow
police to make applications by telephone for an interim intervention
order in circumstances where the application cannot feasibly be
made either in person to the Magistrate or to the principal registrar,
registrar or deputy registrar.
<P>
The Federation does not support those parts of the recommendations
that would empower  &quot;..the principal registrar, a registrar
or a deputy registrar..&quot; to issue interim intervention orders.
<P>
The Federation supports the underlying aim of the proposal to
improve access to orders.  However, we believe that by removing
this authority from Magistrates and delegating it to clerks/registrars
the status of the orders, and indeed the abuse precipitating the
order, will be further watered down.  Interim intervention orders
would potentially take on an administrative rather than legal
status which, in the context of police and some community attitudes
to domestic violence, would seriously erode the effectiveness
of the <I>Crimes (Family Violence) Act</I>.<BR>

<P>
Additionally, in our experience, the attitudes and responses of
clerks/registrars often preclude or discourage women from seeking
an intervention order.  Some examples of what women, seeking interim
intervention orders, have encountered from the clerk of court
include disbelief in her situation and refusal to prepare an application;
refusal to prepare an application unless the alleged perpetrator
is present to tell his side of the story, or unless the woman
has already separated from the other party; being advised by clerks
that orders are not granted for emotional abuse and so on.  An
extension of clerks powers would serve to reinforce attitudes
such as these that trivialise domestic violence and discredit
women's experience.
<P>
Twenty-four hour access to a Magistrate or Children's Court Magistrate
(by phone if necessary) is a proposal we support. An arrangement
that allows victims to apply by phone for an interim intervention
order (to a Magistrate), recognising that the system would require
some mechanism for screening, is also recommended.  We recognise,
however, the limitations of such an approach in according victims
immediate protection.  An interim intervention order still needs
to be served on the defendant to be legally enforceable and in
all likelihood service will not take place the same evening.
<P>
Again, we stress that in many instances victims would be far better
served if police were to exercise their power of arrest (s459
<I>Crimes Act</I>) when immediate action is required.
<P>
<U><B>SERVICE OF INTERVENTION ORDERS</B></U>
<P>
<U><B>Police Recommendation</B></U>
<P>
7. That section 22 of the Crimes (Family Violence) Act 1987 be
amended by deleting the words &quot;in accordance with section
15&quot; and inserting the words &quot;in the opinion of the Court&quot;
after the word &quot;has&quot; where it appears a second time
in that section.
<P>
This amendment is opposed.
<P>
The police proposal to amend S22 of the <I>Crimes (Family Violence)
Act</I> does virtually nothing in our view to address the problems
surrounding service of an intervention order.
<P>
In the experience of community legal centres, the problems in
this area largely stem from police failure to take serious steps
to effect service - again it appears it is seen as a low priority.
<P>
<B> Judy attended a community legal centre after being told by
police they could not do anything because they did not witness
the assault by her husband , Bill.  Judy was severely bruised,
blackened and had a lacerated face and eye.  She obtained an interim
intervention order with the assistance of the community legal
worker but experienced problems in the service of the order.</B>
<P>
<B> When approached by Judy, the police said they could not find
the defendant and told Judy &quot;When you find out where he is
ring us and let us know&quot;.  The police had Bill's work address.
 Judy subsequently found out Bill's new home address and informed
the police.  Police took another three days to serve the order.
(3)</B>
<P>
What this particular amendment achieves in practice is another
transfer of power and authority from the Magistrate to the clerk/registrar.
 S15 of the <I>Crimes (Family Violence) Act</I> compels a Magistrate
to explain to the defendant the purpose, terms and effect of the
order, the consequences that may follow for failure to comply
and the means by which the order may be varied etc.  Under the
proposed amendment, this function could would, be performed by
the clerk substantially weakening its impact.
<P>
This transfer suggests to the police and the offender that domestic
violence lacks sufficient import to warrant the attentions of
the Magistrate.  We reject this suggestion.
<P>
In cases where the defendant is in court, the Magistrate should
explain the order <B>and</B> the defendant should receive a copy
of the order incorporating the requirements under S15 (c), (d)
and (e) before leaving the court. 
<P>
<U><B>PORTABILITY OF INTERVENTION ORDERS</B></U>
<P>
<U><B>Police Recommendation</B></U>
<P>
8. That the Attorney-General enter into agreement with the Attorney-General
of the Commonwealth and other States and Territories to pass legislation
to allow orders which fall within the general definition of intervention
orders made in a State or Territory to be registered in any other
State or Territory and be enforceable to the extent to which those
orders are enforceable in the State or Territory in which the
order is registered.
<P>
The Federation supports this amendment.
