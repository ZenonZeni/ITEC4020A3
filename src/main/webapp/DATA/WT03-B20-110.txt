<h1>Fossil Fuel: Natural Gas</h1><p>
<p>
The United States has abundant natural gas reserves.  And because it is
relatively inexpensive and nonpolluting, natural gas is being used 
increasingly
for electricity generation and other industrial uses.  New technologies 
will
help to extend the types and productivity of gas resources.<p>
<p>
<h2>Resource</h2>
Natural gas is a combustible, gaseous mixture of hydrocarbons including 
mostly
methane; it is called "dry" gas when liquid hydrocarbons and 
nonhydrocarbon
gases are removed. <p>

Total 1992 U.S. natural gas production of 17.8 trillion cubic feet (Tcf) 
was 27%
of total U.S. energy production; that production came from more than 
250,000
wells in 33 states and in federal waters (Gulf of Mexico, offshore 
California).
Texas produced 6.7 Tcf, Louisiana 5.0 Tcf, and Oklahoma 2.0 Tcf.<p>

Year-end 1992 U.S. dry-gas proven reserves were just more than 165 Tcf.  
As
much as 1295 Tcf is technically recoverable in the Lower 48 States--a 
60-year
supply at projected consumption rates.<p>
<p>
<h2>Advantages</h2>
Natural gas is the most environmentally friendly fossil fuel. <p>
There are adequate domestic resources and proven reserves of natural 
gas.<p>
Natural gas can be converted to high-value liquid petroleum products such 
as
automotive fuel.<p>
<p>
<h2>Current Use and Cost</h2><p>
In 1992, the United States consumed 19.5 Tcf of natural gas--more than 
24% of
all U.S. energy consumption; industrial use was 7.5 Tcf (39% of total gas

consumption); residential use was 4.7 Tcf (24%); commercial use was 2.8 
Tcf
(14%); electric utility use was 2.8 Tcf (14%); and other use was 1.7 Tcf 
(9%)<p>
1992 imports of natural gas were 2.1 Tcf--more than 9% of total U.S.
consumption; nearly all of that came from Canada via pipeline.<p>
During 1992, residential sector users paid an average price of $5.89 per
thousand cubic feet (Mcf); commercial, industrial, and electric utilities

sector users paid $4.88, $2.84, and $2.36 per Mcf, respectively.<p>
<p>
<h2>Projected Use and Cost</h2>
U.S. gas consumption is expected to increase from 18.7 Tcf in 1990 to 
24.1
Tcf in 2010. Domestic production is expected to increase from 17.8 Tcf to 
20.2
Tcf.  Imports are expected to provide 16% of consumption in 2010.<p>

Residential consumption is forecast to increase 10% from 1990 to 2010;
industrial consumption will increase 12%.  These increases are 
attributable to
gas conversions, continued gas dominance in new housing, and new uses for

gas.<p>
On January 1, 1993, all price controls on first sale of natural gas were
removed.<p>
<p>
<h2>Issues</h2>
Natural gas is not easily transported to or from countries outside North
America.<p>

Pipelines are generally required for distribution to end-users.<p>
<p>
<h2>Opportunities and Challenges</h2>
Demands for a cleaner environment and advances in gas-fired generation
technology are increasing the use of gas for the generation of 
electricity.  At
least half the generating capacity added in the United States in the next 
15
years will be from gas-fired turbines. <p>

Of the estimated 1295 Tcf of recoverable gas in the Lower 48 States, 
recovery
of more than 200 Tcf depends on developing better technology.<p>

Compressed natural gas represents the largest share of alternative-fuel
consumption projected for the transportation sector in 2010.<p>

More interregional pipeline capacity is needed to support expansion of 
gas
markets.  Total pipeline capacity is projected to increase from 89.6 
billion
cubic feet per day (Bcfpd) in 1992 to 107.2 Bcfpd in 2010.<p>

<p>
<h2>New Technologies</h2>
Advanced exploration technologies, such as 3-D seismic mapping, can 
locate
previously undetected resources.<p>

Unconventional gas recovery technologies include production from
low-permeability reservoirs, recovering methane from coal beds, and 
recovering
gas from Devonian shales.<p>

Research and development in high-efficiency gas technologies (e.g., fuel 
cells)
is strongly supported by the Climate Change Action Plan.<p>
Advanced gas turbines operate at higher temperatures and efficiencies; 
nitrogen
oxide emissions will be cut in half.<p>

New drilling technologies are reducing the cost of producing gas now.<p>
