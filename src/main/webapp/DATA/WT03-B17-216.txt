<PRE>                               <P ALIGN = CENTER><STRONG><H1>IG says</H1></STRONG>:</P>
           <H2> There are 4 important things to remember about
                          controlling snails:</H2>
                    <STRONG><H2>1...Give yourself lots of time</H2></STRONG>
allowing yourself and your property time to regain balance is very important.
 You must be given enough time to stop your urge to use chemicals(rather to
switch from chemicals to organics) and the soil needs time to regain the
invisible populations needed for soil be alive!
<HR>
  <P ALIGN = CENTER><STRONG><H2> 2...Maintain a healthy environment</H2></STRONG></P>
  The health of the soil is your own solution to controlling any type of pest in your
garden especially snails!   Apply rock dust and other sources of mineral yearly to
increase energy levels of the soil Remove eggs when you encounter them.
Apply earthworms as needed. Mulch regulary. Control water. Encourage predators
such as birds lizards, etc..
<HR>
   <P ALIGN = CENTER><STRONG><H2> 3...Avoid chemicals at all cost!</H2></STRONG></P>
   Learning to grow without using chemicals is not as scary as it seems nor is it impossible.
Instead of saying avoid chemicals at all cost, I should just say do not use any chemicals that
can harm you and your environment. Be very careful what you decide to you. Do you really have
to use it, isn't there an organic safe way to do it?
<HR>
  <P ALIGN = CENTER><STRONG><H2>4...Plant the proper planting for the season.</H2></STRONG></P>
     Planting the wrong type of vegetables in your garden will encourage snail activity.
 The same goes for other types of flowers that snails find good to eat. Knowing that snails
are brone to grow during the early spring, it would not be wise to plant anything that was not
protected that you did not mind the snails eating. Agood suggestion would be to flush the
earth of snails in your area.
<HR>
<STRONG><H2>Flushing The Earth</H2></STRONG>
This technique is called that because you flush out the snails from any perticular area and
remove them. This will severely rteduce the snails population almost
immediatly. Should be done several times before planting.
You start off by watering the area you want flushed. Water slowly to allow earth to get soaked
Water several times per day for about 1 week. Each Day go outside at night and collect
as many snails as you can find. Try to keep a count as this information will come in handy
in determining how many snails your property has and wether its growing or dieing back.
A certain level of snails is preferred while notcompletly eliminate them.
