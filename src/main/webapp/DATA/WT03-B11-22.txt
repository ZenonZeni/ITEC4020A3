GERMANY:  INTERVENES WITH BANGLADESH ON CASE OF TASLIMA NASREEN

   NEW DELHI, July 31 (IPS) -- German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel
winding up a visit to India this week revealed that his country had
intervened with the Bangladesh government on behalf of fugitive
writer Taslima Nasreen.
   "Germany undertook a demarche to the Bangladesh government that
we want to look after her case so that she can move freely in her
country," Kinkel, who is also Vice Chancellor told a news
conference here in Delhi.
   But he declined to elaborate on the statement, saying, "It is
in the interest of Taslima Nasreen that we do not disclose all that
we have decided on her behalf. I hope you understand."
   Germany, which is the current president of the European Union,
last week said European foreign ministers had agreed at a meeting
in Brussels to instruct their ambassadors in Dhaka to urge the
Bangladesh government to protect the feminist writer.
   "It was at my initiative that European Union ministers discussed
her case at length and said she was welcome to all the 16 member
countries," Kinkel said here.
   Nasreen is in hiding in Bangladesh where the authorities have
issued an arrest warrant against her under pressure from Muslim
fundamentalists who want her hanged for blasphemy.
   The Bangladesh government has said that Nasreen is free to go
abroad, but must first submit herself to due process of law. The
writer, who denies the charge, is accused of recommending a
revision of the Koran in an interview to a Calcutta newspaper,
where she had stopped over on her way back from a business trip to
Europe concerning publication of her work in translation.
   What she actually told the paper, she explained, was that what
needed revision was the Sharia, the Islamic code of law, because
of its repressive legislation on women, not the Koran itself, which
is the Holy Writ of Mohammedanism.
   Kinkel, who arrived in India on July 27 on a bilateral trade and
business promotion visit, also discussed Kashmir, the reform of the
United Nations system and nuclear non-proliferation with his hosts.
   Germany supports India's case for a permanent seat on the U.N.
Security Council as much as it seeks one for itself, he said,
adding that both countries have agreed to cooperate to work for
reforming the U.N. system.
   "The U.N. Security Council does not reflect the situation in
the world as it is today," Kinkel said. As the biggest European
country and leading world economic power, Germany had "obligations
towards the international community", he added.
   On India's dispute over Kashmir with arch-adversary Pakistan,
Germany has advised both New Delhi and Islamabad to find a solution
on the basis of U.N. resolutions and the two-decade-old bilateral
Shimla accord, he said.
   The northern Indian state has been a bone of contention since
Pakistan's creation in 1947. Islamabad accuses Indian security
forces of rights abuse in battling the four-year-old Kashmir
insurgency, which New Delhi says is being aided by Pakistan.
   Rivalry in the subcontinent has stoked fears of a nuclear
confrontation. Though there is no clinching evidence, both India
and Pakistan are believed to possess the necessary expertise to
build nuclear bombs.
   Neither country has signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty
(NPT). India says it discriminates between the nuclear haves and
have-nots.
   Foreign Minister Kinkel said India and Germany have agreed to
discuss nuclear non-proliferation, an issue "on which India has
its own point of view".
   Bonn had raised the NPT during Indian Prime Minister P.V.
Narasimha Rao's second official trip to Germany earlier this year.
Chancellor Kohl who visited New Delhi a year ago had urged India
to sign the NPT, but did not link this to future aid.
   Germany is India's second largest donor after Japan and has
given more than 15 billion dm since 1958, making India the largest
recipient of official development assistance (ODA).
   On July 28 Kinkel signed a financial cooperation agreement with
Finance Minister Manmoham Singh that offers 460 million D-marks for
mainly poverty alleviation and the protection of natural resources
and the environment.
   India is a major partner in Germany's current efforts to expand
economic contacts in Asia, the foreign minister said. His
delegation included 24 German business leaders.
   "The intensification of economic relations is at the center of
my visit and talks in New Delhi. We look at India as a future
mega-market and are looking for a real partnership in our economic
relations," Kinkel declared.

BANGLADESH:  ANTI-TASLIMA RALLIES IN DHAKA

   DHAKA, July 31 (IPS) -- Armed police were posted outside mosques
and in sensitive localities here in the Bangladesh capital July 29
to maintain peace during two rallies after evening prayers to press
for the hanging of feminist writer Taslima Nasreen.
   Hundreds of people streamed into Dhaka from adjoining townships
and villages for the twin rallies called separately by the
opposition Jamaat-e-Dulami and the United Action Alliance of 13
other groups.
   Nasreen has been in hiding since June 4, trying to escape a
government arrest warrant and a Muslim fatwa for blasphemy.
   The Khaleda Zia government is under growing pressure from the
West to protect the 32-year-old fugitive writer who is being
described as the female Salman Rushdie.
   German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel who is visiting New Delhi
is reported saying again on July 29 on behalf of the European
Union, of which Germany is the current chairman, that Dhaka has
been told it must ensure her safety or allow her to leave the
country.
   The Bangladesh government continues to insist that the country's
laws provide ample protection for the fugitive writer, but she must
first submit herself to the due process of the law.
   The government has said that Nasreen would be allowed to leave
the country after she proves her innocence in court.
   The twin rallies follow a month of protests and meetings by
religious extremists to mobilize support countrywide for their
campaign to make Bangladesh an Islamic Republic, hang Nasreen for
blasphemy and ban non-governmental groups that they are accusing
of anti-Islamic activities.
   Dhaka was relatively quiet on July 29 as Friday is the Islamic
holiday, and all offices and some markets in the city were closed.
   Rival calls for nationwide strikes on June 30, had led to ugly
clashes between Nasreen's supporters and opponents, causing the
death of a 14-year-old in a northern village.
   Nasreen is being hounded for calling for a revision of the Koran
in an interview granted to an Indian newspaper, The Statesman. The
writer has denied the charges, saying she was misquoted.
   The government wants her arrested for "maliciously outraging
the religious feelings of Muslims", a charge the religious
extremists insist must be punished with death.

PHILIPPINES:  CATHOLIC CHURCH LAUNCHES CRUSADE AGAINST CAIRO
              U.N. CONFERENCE ON POPULATION AND DEVELOPMENT

By Lian Nemenzo-Hernandez
   MANILA, July 31 (IPS) -- The Catholic Church in the Philippines
has gone on the offensive against the government's population
policy in the run-up to the big U.N. conference in Cairo next
month, but women's groups here are determined to fight back.
   Manila Archbishop Cardinal Jaime Sin this week called on the
people of Asia's only Catholic nation to join a protest rally next
month to protest the government's plans to reduce population growth
rate with artificial contraceptives and legalized abortion.
   "We want to make known to the president and his cabinet our
indignation and outrage at the abuses being allowed by government
against the family and our children," Sin said.
   He said children are being bombarded with reading materials and
films containing "pornographic, perverse and poisonous sexual
propaganda" as part of their education, and are being conditioned
to adopt a "contraceptive mentality".
   "The government's population program brainwashes children to
accept as normal, attractive and even glamorous certain unnatural,
abnormal and perverse sexual relationships and behavior such as
homosexuality, lesbianism, incest, sodomy, oral sex, contraception,
sterilization and abortion," Sin added.
   Education and health officials dismissed the Cardinal's
outburst, saying he was engaging in a "baseless debate".
   It was the Church's strongest criticism yet of Manila's
population policy, and appears to be carefully coordinated with the
Vatican's broadsides against some provisions in the Cairo
documents. Last month, the Vatican reportedly sent a faxed protest
to the Philippine government criticizing its support for abortion.
   Sin attacked the Philippine stance at the International
Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) in Cairo in
September: "Global forces, backed by the wealth of powerful
nations, are out to destroy the family by first destroying our
children."
   The government of Fidel Ramos, the country's first Protestant
president, is promoting both natural and artificial methods of
birth control to help bring down an annual 2.5 percent birth rate.
   Anti-abortion groups say the Philippine delegation to Cairo, led
by Health Secretary Juan Flavier, is planning to support a U.S.-
backed proposal for acceptance of abortion as a birth control
method.
   But health officials say none of the government's programs
advocate abortion.
   "We have to be clear on this," said Health Under-Secretary Jaime
Galvez Tan. "We provide and teach natural and artificial methods.
But we leave the decision up to the woman herself, her reproductive
rights and her choices."
   Member of the Philippine delegate to Cairo, Marilen Danguilan
agrees: "The accusation is unfounded. We rejected abortion as a
means of contraception. In fact, we have been arguing with the U.S.
delegation not to be so fixated on abortion. The issue is bigger."
   Manila Vice Mayor Joselito Atienza, who heads the organisation
Pro-Life Philippines, said the government should "reject the draft
(ICPD) resolution and the way of life being imposed on us by
foreign nations". He said the 83-page document contains provisions
that are "contrary to Filipino culture, tradition and religion".
   Women activists say such statements reflect the "very narrow"
thinking that has placed women in a subordinate position in
society.
   "The Church's thinking with regard to women's role continues to
relegate them to the Middle Ages and denies women the right to make
decisions for themselves," says Ana Maria Nemenzo, national
coordinator of WomanHealth Philippines, a non-governmental group.
   "The Catholic Church sees 'abortion' as lurking behind every
phrase and provision in the draft ICPD document," she says.
   The Church is suspicious of terms like "safe motherhood",
fearing it could be used to smuggle in the concept of abortion. It
even opposes the World Health Organisation's (WHO) definition of
"reproductive health".
   "But the question of population and development goes far beyond
the issue of abortion," says Nemenzo. "For us women, it touches on
gender equity and women's self-determination, and the appropriate
development strategy that will guarantee these."
   Several non-governmental groups sponsored a forum here today to
discuss the draft ICPD document and its implications on the status
of women in the Philippines and the rest of the world.
   Organisers said despite lip service given to improving status
of women in the Third World, nothing will come out of these efforts
unless women's self-determination is recognized and accepted.
   Antonio de los Reyes, president of the Council of the Laity of
the Philippines, criticized the country's delegation to the Cairo
meeting, which he said includes "academic disciples of
unconditional artificial birth control and at least three open
advocates of the cause for legalization of abortion".
   "Not one Pro-Life proponent was included in the delegation," he
complained.
   Women's groups say the Vatican should not be allowed to
intervene in U.N. proceedings. The Church only has observer status
at the United Nations and should therefore not be given undue
importance and space in official U.N. sessions, they add.
   Because of persistent lobbying by the Vatican, several
provisions in the ICPD document have been "bracketed" or identified
as areas that still have to be debated in Cairo, including
reproductive rights, reproductive health, fertility regulation and
safe motherhood.
   Women activists say they will continue to push for gender equity
in all these issues in Cairo and will lobby to ensure that various
contraceptive options remain open to women.

ALGERIA:  FRENCH GROUPS SUPPORT INTELLECTUALS, THEATRE DIRECTORS
          DOCTORS AND PROFESSORS DRIVEN OUT BY ISLAMIC FANATICISM

By Barbara Borst
   PARIS, July 31 (IPS) -- With political violence in Algeria
claiming new victims daily, French organizations offer solidarity
any way they can -- aid to refugees, information campaigns, running
pressure groups and supporting democrats-in-exile.
   They don't expect help from the French government, which rejects
Algerian requests for asylum, say the groups, for fear that doing
so will trigger massive immigration to France. France, they add,
still takes a colonialist view of a country it held for 132 years.
   Hugo Colonna of the International Support Committee for Algerian
Intellectuals said his group's goals are to disseminate accurate
information about the complex political conflict and "to permit
those intellectuals to express themselves in France."
   Theatre directors, journalists, doctors and university
professors have been among targets of attacks that have taken at
least 4,000 lives in Algeria since January 1992.
   Violence erupted after the military took power in January 1992
and cancelled the second round of elections the radical Islamic
Salvation Front (FIS) were poised to win. The military banned the
FIS and launched a campaign to repress fundamentalist opposition.
It claims that the Islamic militants have committed most killings.
   The Armed Islamic Group (GIA) has claimed responsibility for
many attacks, including those on foreigners, but FIS says that the
security forces have slaughtered thousands of people themselves in
their bid to suppress Islamic radicalism.
   "It's not just a question of combat between Islamists and the
state," Colonna said. "In the middle there is a society. It was
one of the leading countries (in the region), rich with potential.
   "There was democracy from 1988 until 1992. They're still
struggling for that." However, there are deep antagonisms between
and within opposition movements, he noted.
   Sami Boumendjel of the Committee for Dialogue in Algeria said
that to resolve the conflict the regime must return to the
democratic process it interrupted. "No one can impose himself by
force. We must go back to the sovereignty of the people," he said.
   Boumendjel's committee seeks dialogue with all factions that
favor democracy through commitment to elections, whatever the
results, the establishment of a constitution and the rule of law,
and equal access for all men and women to work, schools and other
social benefits.
   Some charge that fundamentalists would not practice such
principles, and Bernard Dreano of the Forum of Mediterranean
Citizens, among others, warn of fundamentalists (including former
Communists) with a Stalinist devotion to centralized power.
   But Boumendjel is convinced that there are Islamic moderates who
can be an essential part of the solution. "Our strategy is to
enclose Islamists in the framework of democracy," he said.
   Dreano says the group tries to create "space for reflection and
solidarity" that sets the conflict in context. Algeria is not alone
among North African states in facing serious challenges from
Islamic fundamentalists, although its methods of combatting them
differ from those used in Tunisia, Morocco and Egypt.
   "France has no policy except to reinforce the power in place in
Algeria," Dreano said. "They don't support the opposition."
   Mouloud Aounit of the Movement Against Racism (MRAP) said most
Algerian refugees, now arriving in France by the hundreds, don't
seek political asylum. "They don't want to cut ties with Algeria.
They just want to breathe a little," he said.
   Those who do seek asylum generally run afoul of the French
government's interpretation of the Geneva Convention to cover only
those persecuted by the state.
   Ordinary people caught between the government and Islamic
militants generally don't qualify, he said. France focuses on
Algeria when a foreigner is killed but pays little attention to the
murder of thousands of ordinary Algerians.
   Souad Benani of Nanas Beurs, a French group for women of North
African ancestry, said her organisation tries to inform the French
people and aid Algerians who enter France.
   "Women often demand refugee status on the basis of sexism," she
said. "They are threatened by fundamentalism. But political refugee
status is already very difficult to acquire. We fight case by
case."
   Robert Menard, president of Reporters Without Borders (RSF),
said his group pressures Algerian authorities, operates a toll-free
telephone number for information on obtaining refugee status in
France and helps immigrants find work.
   But while RSF collected substantial funds to support journalists
in the former Yugoslavia, it had less luck raising funds for
Algerian journalists, who need such things as walkie-talkies to
improve their survival chances.
   Perhaps that is because "90 percent of the press is propaganda"
in Algeria, Menard claimed. Still, he conceded, with 15 journalists
killed in two and a half years, "there's no other country where
it's more dangerous."

ALGERIA:  ARMED ISLAMIC MOVEMENT OFFERS TO END ASSASSINATION
          OF FOREIGNERS IF LEADER RELEASED FROM PRISON

By Cherif Cordahi
   CAIRO, July 31 (IRS) -- The killing of foreigners in Algeria is
likely to continue despite an offer by Islamic radicals blamed for
several murders to end their campaign if the authorities release
a senior militant member from prison.
   Local journalists and Western diplomats in the North African
state say the government is unlikely to cave in to the militant
demand that it release Abdelhak Layada, a senior figure in the
militant Armed Islamic Movement (MIA).
   Militants from the Armed Islamic Group (GIA), a sister-
organisation of the MIA, demanded Layada's release after they freed
two Arab ambassadors they kidnapped a week earlier.
   Western diplomats in the capital, Algiers, told IPS this week
that the GIA had changed its mind about trading the two
ambassadors, Kassem Asker Djebrani of Yemen and Hill Bin Salem
Assiyabi of Oman, for Layada.
   "There was a lot debate within the GIA about what to do if the
government refused to cave in to their demands," said one diplomat.
"In the end they decided to release the two because they were Arabs
and good Muslims."
   Once released, the two ambassadors handed a message from the GIA
to government officials making the offer of ending their killing
of foreigners in return for Layada.
   Government officials refused to comment about the militant
demand. But in a statement the authorities said that "Algeria
reasserts its determination to follow up its efforts to protect its
hosts and visitors in accordance with the noble principles of
Islam."
   Around 4,000 people -- mainly security personnel and militants
-- have been killed in almost three years of violence since the
government canceled elections in January 1992 which the Islamic
radicals were poised to win. The MIA is linked to the now-outlawed
Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) which won most of the votes.
   At least 42 foreigners have been killed since the GIA warned all
foreigners to leave Algeria by December last year.
   After a lull in the spring months, the number of killings has
rocketed in recent weeks. On July 6, seven Italians died when
militants climbed aboard their boat at night and slit their throats
as they slept.
   On July 11, seven more foreigners -- four Russians, two
Yugoslavs and one Romanian -- were also killed. On July 20, a local
journalist with the national news agency, the Algerian Press
Service (APS), was gunned down in front of his home.
   One journalist with APS, who did not want to be named, told IPS
she was very scared. "We're all keeping a low profile," she said
by telephone. "We don't know who's going to be killed next."
   Diplomats say the GIA demand for the release of an MIA member
is a "serious development" for the military-backed government. "It
shows that the different groups are clubbing together," said one.
   "They've conducted joint operations before but this is the first
time I remember one group specifically asking for the release of
a member another group." Layada, who has been in prison for almost
year, was arrested in Morocco in January 1993 under an extradition
agreement with Algeria.
   Algeria's neighbours -- Morocco and Tunisia in particular --
fear the country's militant insurgency will spill over their
borders, so are helping in any way they can by cooperating closely
with the Algerian authorities.
   The country has been in political turmoil since January 1992
when the army intervened to prevent a victory by the FIS in the
country's first multi-party elections.
   Violence exploded across the country despite the proclamation
of a state of emergency and the imposition of a curfew in the 10
central districts of the country.
   The unrest is fueled by the spiralling economic crisis. Caught
between the fall in world oil prices, a slowdown in outside
investments and the troubles of industry, almost 1.4 million out
of Algeria's 5.3 million labour force are out of a job.
   The unemployment rate has risen by 32 percent in the past three
years. According to official statistics some 84.5 percent of the
registered jobless are aged between 16 and 29, and 68 percent of
these have never worked. A majority have no skills.
   The problem was met by a 40 percent devaluation of the dinar
accompanied by an increase in interest rates to discourage
inflation in April.
   In return, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) promised
Algeria a stand-by credit of one billion dollars, opening the way
for a re-scheduling of its $26 billion foreign debt and for new
credits from other donors.

ALGERIA:  ISLAMIC SALVATION FRONT DETERMINED NOT TO MERGE
          WITH OTHER MUSLIM FUNDAMENTALIST ORGANIZATIONS

   CAIRO, July 31 (IPS) -- Indications that the Islamic radical
movement in Algeria is in turmoil were reinforced this week by
statements by one faction resisting alliance with other groups, and
reports that some armed groups are operating in support of each
other.
   Militants from the Armed Islamic Group (GIA) demanded the
freedom of a leader of another radical group after they released
two Arab ambassadors they had kidnapped a week earlier.
   The GIA is blamed for a series of murders of foreigners but had
promised to end the campaign if the authorities released Abdelhak
Layada, a senior figure in the Armed Islamic Movement (MIA).
   Western diplomats in the capital, Algiers, told IPS this week
that the GIA had changed its mind about trading the two

Assiyabi of Oman, for Layada.
   Around 4,000 people -- mainly security personnel and militants
-- have been killed in almost three years of violence since the
government canceled elections in January 1992 which the Islamic
radicals were poised to win.
   The MIA is linked to the now-outlawed Islamic Salvation Front
(FIS) which won most of the votes. But the FIS is divided into
several factions, some of which are ready to talk with the
authorities, some of which want to fight on.
   Early in the week a leader of one of these factions denied
reports that the FIS -- the largest of the armed groups -- was to
merge with the other two Islamic groups.
   "The broad-based FIS will continue to exist as the Islamic
Salvation Front and will not dissolve itself into another
organisation for illegitimate reasons," said a faxed communique'
received in Paris from FIS spokesman-in-exile Rabah Kebir.
   Earlier this month a similar statement signed by FIS leader
Anouar Nasr Eddine Haddam said the FIS's armed wing was to merge
with the GIA and MIA -- under the GIA's name.
   Kebir's message called on FIS "fighters in the field" to "devote
themselves to fighting and to leave larger issues to their
commanders."
   Diplomats say the GIA demand for the release of an MIA member
is a "serious development" for the government. "It shows that the
different groups are clubbing together," said one.
   "They've conducted joint operations before but this is the first
time I remember one group specifically asking for the release of
a member of another group." Layada, who has been in prison for
almost year, was arrested in Morocco in January 1993 under an
extradition agreement with Algeria.
   "There was a lot of debate within the GIA about what to do if
the government refused to cave in to their demands," said one
diplomat. "In the end they decided to release the two because they

one Rumanian were killed. On July 20, a local journalist with the
national news agency, the Algerian Press Service (APS), was gunned
down in front of his home.
   A journalist with APS, who did not want to be named, told IPS
she was scared. "We're all keeping a low profile," she said by
phone on July 25. "We don't know who's going to be killed next."
   Algeria has been in political turmoil since January 1992 when
the army intervened to prevent a victory by the FIS in the
country's first multi-party elections. Violence exploded across the
country despite the proclamation of a state of emergency.
   The unrest is fueled by the spiralling economic crisis. Caught
between the fall in world oil prices, a slowdown in outside
investments and the troubles of industry, almost 1.4 million out
of Algeria's 5.3 million labour force are out of a job.
   The unemployment rate has risen by 32 percent in the past three
years. According to official statistics some 84.5 percent of the
registered jobless are aged between 16 and 29, and 68 percent of
these have never worked. A majority have no skills.
   The problem was met by a 40 percent devaluation of the dinar
accompanied by an increase in interest rates to discourage
inflation in April.
   In return, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) promised
Algeria a stand-by credit of one billion dollars, opening the way
for a re-scheduling of its $26 billion foreign debt and for new
credits from other donors.

PAKISTAN:  SECTARIAN CLASHES BETWEEN SHI'ITE AND SUNNI MUSLIMS
           CONTINUE TO ROCK KARACHI

By Imran Munir
   ISLAMABAD, July 31 (IPS) -- Pakistan's largest city of Karachi
continued to be disturbed this week by gun battles between
sectarian groups that the government is blaming on Indian agents.
   Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, who has accused India of fanning
trouble in her home province of Sindh, of which Karachi is the
capital, has called a special meeting of her cabinet in the city
to discuss ways to end the violence.
   Activists of the Shi'ite Tehrik-i-Jaffaria were again exchanging
fire with supporters of the fanatical Sunni Sipan-i- Sahaba in
various parts of Karachi, agencies report.
   Karachi has been almost shut down by the gun fights, violence
and killings that broke out July 22, and has so far claimed the
lives of nine people.
   The violence was sparked off by a grenade attack on a coach of
Sunni Muslims returning from a religious ceremony. Now it has
snowballed into a familiar pattern of revenge attacks.
   Six Shi'ite worshipers were injured by unidentified gunmen as
they were leaving a mosque after morning prayers on July 24.
   On the same day in another part of the city a police constable
was gunned down by masked youths, and the body of an unidentified
man who had been shot through the head was found.
   The city was only just recovering from a round of sectarian
clashes between April 29 and May 5. Factional strife within the
powerful Mohajir Quami Movement (MQM) of Muslim refugees from India
is claimed to be behind the violence.
   Premier Bhutto claims the MQM has been infiltrated by Indian
intelligence agents who are plotting to destabilize her government
and the country.
   Pakistani intelligence reports allege they have evidence. Secret
reports of the Interior Ministry corroborate the charges.
   The Bhutto government has called a cabinet meeting in Karachi
to discuss ways to renew contacts with the MQM in order to resolve
the ongoing crisis.
   The government seems to have realized the failure of previous
measures and now feels it must include all groups including the MQM
in discussions to end the sectarian feuding in Karachi.

BRITAIN:  HINDUS FIGHT TO KEEP THEIR TEMPLE FESTIVAL DAYS

By Susan Litherland
   LONDON, July 31 (IPS) -- If ever an arranged marriage faced
problems it is the one innocently orchestrated by a former rock
star between a popular British Hindu sect and residents of a
classic leafy English village.
   Letchmore Heath in Hertfordshire, home to wealthy London
commuters, nestles in picturesque fashion around a pub on the
green, a duck pond and blacksmith. In its midst stands a holy Hindu
shrine visited some six days a year by thousands of worshippers.
   The problem, according to the local Hertsmere Council's managing
director Philip Copland, is that the Hindus only have permission
to use it as a theological college. They are contravening the law,
which is made worse by the large number of devotees who visit the
temple.
   Akhandadhi Das, president of the temple, argues, "Without a
shrine there could be no question of training priests. We teach all
aspects of the worship of Krishna which the general Hindu community
finds fulfilling. Naturally they want to come and worship."
   Twenty-one years ago Bhaktivedanta Manor, a 19th century mock
Tudor mansion set in 17 acres of grounds, was donated to the
International Society for Krishna Consciousness by George Harrison,
a member of The Beatles pop group.
   The tussle between Krishnas and locals heated up in the mid-80s
when Hertsmere Council sought to limit the numbers of people
attending festival days.
   Before long, the numbers crept back up to about 20,000, the
council went to the High Court, and were told the best way to
control the situation was to issue an enforcement notice that would
prevent the manor from operating as a temple.
   The Krishnas appealed and were turned down. They went to the
European Commission in March for help but were told rights of
worship didn't necessarily overrule the planning laws of Britain.
The council was deemed just and once more issued an enforcement
order.
   Copland says: "These days we still get more than 12,000 people
gathering at the temple on festival days.
   "Some council members believe that despite the proposed access
road, this is not acceptable in a village like Letchmore Heath."
   To strengthen their case the Krishnas have proposed building an
access road, at their own expense, that would take traffic away
from the village center.
   They have already paid a deposit of 100,000 pounds ($150,000)
for the option to purchase the land, and say the total cost would
be in the region of one million pounds ($1.5 million).
   A decision on the proposal was expected last week but the
council failed to reach agreement and deferred it until October.
   Naresh Chadha, chairman of the Temple Defence Movement, was
unsurprised at the dithering. He claims the Conservatives in the
jointly-run council came with a pile of amendments determined not
to allow the scheme to go ahead. "They arrived full of pre-
conceptions," he points out.
   Some members of the Hindu community claim it has less to do with
traffic than with racial prejudice. Sorita Bhatia, a journalist on
the London-based Asian newspaper Eastern Eye, is convinced
religious discrimination is at play.
   "The offices of the racist, right-wing British National Party
are allowed to stay open despite national pressure, but our temple
may have to close due to trouble stirred up by a few local
villagers," she says.
   There are rows going on throughout the country over the siting
of mosques, but because Hindus are less vocal their temples don't
get public support, she adds.
   Chadha claims it has more to do with snobbery. "The main issue
is that property values may be affected by a lot of Hindus visiting
the village."
   If the application is finally turned down the Krishnas will take
their fight to the Department of the Environment. Their
determination not to be moved to a possibly less sensitive site is
rooted in the manor's history.
   Harrison gave the house to Srila Prabhupada, founder of the
sect, who lived there periodically between 1973 and his death in
1977.
   "Once a Hindu temple has been established, it can never be
moved. We will defend it vigorously," warned Chadha. "We will form
a housing trust and buy up every house that goes up for sale in the
village."
   It is not an idle threat. The sect is backed by the immensely
wealthy Hinduja family who live in Britain. Indeed, the matter has
been taken as high as the Indian parliament.
   Chadha has held meetings with L.K. Advani, leader of the
opposition Hindu Bharatiya Janata party who has promised he will
do anything he can to help.
   The Congress government has been sufficiently rattled to send
a senior minister, Kamal Nath, to Britain to warn ministers that
British contracts could be at risk over the row.
   It was reported in the Sunday Telegraph newspaper that Prime
Minister John Major was sympathetic to the Krishna's case, but
could not intervene in a local government matter. That, says
Chadha, hasn't changed.
   A possible flashpoint could be the celebrations for Krishna's
birthday at the end of August. A two-day affair, Copland says it
will involve "lots of noisy chanting and fireworks". He believes
the council will enforce against it.
   "We have suggested to the Krishnas that they might consider
holding it in a nearby country park. Devotees could come to the
manor, worship before the statues, and then be bussed to the park.
Their response seems to be favorable."
   Whatever the outcome of the October council meeting, the row
seems set to rumble on indeterminately. The Department of the
Environment cannot close the theological college, even if it does
prevent worshippers entering the temple.
   If that happens, the villagers are likely to find devotees
practicing their religion outside the temple gates.

SUDAN:  REBELS REJECT KHARTOUM'S UNILATERAL CEASEFIRE

By Horace Awori
   NAIROBI, July 31 (IPS) -- Southern Sudanese rebels have rejected
a unilateral ceasefire declared by the government that was due to
come into effect at midnight on July 30.
   "The ceasefire is a sham. It has been calculated to deceive the
people of Sudan and the international community", said Steven Wondu
of the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA).
   He said the military government of Lt-Gen. Omar Hassan al Bashir
had launched three major offensives against the SPLA stronghold at
Nimule on the Uganda border in the past few days.
   "As I speak now, heavy fighting is continuing. We have repulsed
three attacks which were preceded by heavy bombardments," Wondu
claimed.
   He said the Sudanese government forces lost 739 troops in the
battle of Nimule when they tried to cross the Awa River to enter
the city.
   Government forces had captured the adjacent towns of Pageri and
Aswa about three months ago, and have been pushing on to dislodge
the rebels from Nimule.
   Wondu, who represents an SPLA faction led by Col. John Garang,
described the ceasefire declaration, announced over state-run Radio
Omdurman as "unprocedural."
   He said, "President Daniel Moi (of Kenya), who is the chairman
of the (peace) talks, had appealed for a ceasefire and any response
should have been formally presented to him and the negotiators for
discussion."
   Wondu said the SPLA had immediately given a formal response to
Moi's appeal and "we are surprised that the chairman of the talks
learnt of the (government's) ceasefire through the press."
   He claimed that the ceasefire only covered gunfire, leaving out
aerial bombardments and troop movements. "This renders it
meaningless and insincere and we shall continue to defend
ourselves."
   Wondu said the SPLA would only reciprocate if Khartoum accepted
an internationally monitored ceasefire within the context of the
six-nation IGADD peace initiative.
   The Inter-Governmental Authority on Drought and Desertification
(IGADD), which is brokering the ongoing peace talks between the
Sudanese government and the two factions of the SPLA here, groups
Djibouti, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Kenya, Somalia, Sudan and Uganda.
   According to Wondu, the talks, which have been going on behind
closed doors center on demand for self-determination for the south
and a secular arrangement for a proposed interim period that would
precede separate statehood for the region.
   "We in the SPLA unconditionally accept these principles and will
only negotiate on their basis," said Wondu.
   The SPLA has been fighting against domination of the mainly
Christian-African south by the Arab-Islamic north since 1983. More
than a million people have been killed and another three million
displaced in the fighting.
   Earlier mediations by Nigeria and by former U.S. President Jimmy
Carter failed to make any headway.
   But the SPLA itself is divided. The rebel movement split into
two groups in 1991.
   Early this week the factions clashed in the Bahr-el-Ghazal
region in southern Sudan and 1,000 people were killed, according
to a Catholic bishop in the area.

ULSTER:  IRA'S POLITICAL WING DEFENDS REJECTION OF PEACE PLAN

By Sarah O'Hara
   DUBLIN, July 31 (IPS) -- Northern Irish republican leader Gerry
Adams this week put a positive face on the weekend rejection of a
Anglo-Irish peace plan by political representatives of guerrillas
fighting British rule in the disputed province.
   Gerry Adams, leader of Sinn Fein -- the political wing of the
Irish Republican Army (IRA), which has waged a 25-year war against
British rule in Northern Ireland -- insisted that the peace process
was still alive, despite his party's rejection of the initiative.
   "We have a peace process which can't be stopped," he said in
reviewing the conference in Letterkenny, in the Republic of
Ireland. "It may be too slow but it can't be stopped and that is
a point that is missed, you see. People miss the big picture."
   Sinn Fein, which represents only one in ten voters in Northern
Ireland, has held center stage for most of the last eight months
since the British and Irish prime ministers began a joint peace
initiative with the so-called Downing Street Declaration.
   The Declaration attempts to recognize the rights of both the
majority Northern Irish Protestant community to remain part of the
United Kingdom and the minority Catholic community to its
aspiration for a united Ireland.
   Both Irish and British leaders hoped it would encourage the IRA
to call a permanent ceasefire in return for a place at the
negotiating table alongside Irish, British and Northern Irish
constitutional parties.
   But Sinn Fein again refused to either accept or reject the
Declaration, arguing instead that the British government should
"join the persuaders" in trying to convince the pro-British
Protestant majority that they could live in a united Ireland.
   Meanwhile the IRA has continued its armed struggle with British
forces, and attempted new bombing attacks against targets on the
British mainland.
   Irish prime minister, Albert Reynolds, was surprisingly upbeat
in his response, saying this week that he could see "some positive
signals" from Sinn Fein.
   He said the peace process would continue, with or without Sinn
Fein and that his government would go on searching for agreement
with Britain on new political structures for Northern Ireland
(Ulster).
   In contrast, his Deputy Dick Spring, also shadow foreign
minister and leader of the Irish Labour Party, described the
Letterkenny conference decision as sickening. "I think we must be
living in totally different worlds if Sinn Fein sees the conference
as a positive development," he said.
   And British government Minister for Northern Ireland Patrick
Mayhew said the initiative for peace did not rest with Sinn Fein
and that Sinn Fein were "rejecting democracy" because they could
not achieve their aims through the ballot box.
   Mayhew said the two governments were preparing a framework
document, to establish new relationships between North and South,
and between the Irish and British governments as well.
   Of Sinn Fein, he said, "We have never waited upon them. We have
not been spending several months waiting, twiddling our thumbs, to
see what Sinn Fein were going to do. We have been pressing on, the
two governments and the constitutional parties, with our political
work. We've got to go on doing that and we will."
   Reynolds, who leads the populist Fianna Fail party in a
coalition government with Labour, is now under pressure from Irish
opposition politicians suspicious of the motivations of the IRA.
   John Bruton, leader of the conservative opposition party, Fine
Gael, said the Declaration had not progressed peace. He believed
it was "ultimately futile" to expect a ceasefire from the IRA,
which he described as "a classic revolutionary organisation".
   "They use violence some of the time, they use artificial offers
of peace at other times and they use these to break the will of
democratic politicians," he said.
   Adams said that the peace process had been "kick-started" by
himself and the leader of the constitutional nationalist SDLP, John
Hume, "nurtured" by the Irish government,  and "helped" by
"nationalist Ireland", with no assistance from the British.
   "What we did yesterday was to give a considered and detailed
response to the Downing Street Declaration. We're the only party
to give such a detailed response to the Declaration," he said.
   "What we have done is to isolate positive elements (in the
Declaration) that can be built up and negative elements which we
can seek to revoke. The governments never said it was a solution,
the governments said it was a step forward.
   Much of the thinking on the part of the Irish government over
the last eight months has been based on the idea that Adams
represents a significant grouping within Sinn Fein and IRA which
would like to see an end to the conflict.
   However many "doves" in the republican movement may not be
prepared to force the issue, for fear it would split the IRA and
produce a newer, more vicious group.

TIBET:  DALAI LAMA TO ADDRESS INTERNATIONAL STUDENT FESTIVAL

   OSLO, July 31 (IPS) -- Tibetan leader-in-exile and Nobel Prize
winner, the Dalai Lama, will visit the Norwegian city of Trondheim
in October to address the International Student Festival in
Trondheim (ISFiT).
   The main theme of the festival from Oct 6-15 is Human Rights,
said festival organizer Rina Sunder and ISFiT Head of Groups Lars
Bjoergan Schroeder. They travelled to Dharamsala, India, where the
Dalai Lama lives in exile, to secure his support.
   The two students made a personal representation after the
Tibetan leader's representatives in London and Dharamsala initially
declined the invitation on his behalf. While in India the two also
invited a number of Indian government officials and human rights
activists who will also attend the ISFiT events.
   His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama, to his followers the "earthly
manifestation of the Avalokiteshvara, Bodhisattva of Compassion"
has spent over 35 years trying to find a non-violent response to
the armed invasion and annexation of his historic homeland.
   Since the Chinese invaded in 1959, Tibet's temples have been
razed, its natural resources plundered and its lands seized for
Chinese settlers and nuclear facilities. The Tibetan environment
has been degraded and a long list of human rights violations have
seen monks and nuns persecuted and people imprisoned without trial.
   "I am fighting for the maintenance of our culture and our
identity," he told IPS in an interview this year. He says one
million Tibetans have died since China invaded in 1949. Since then
Tibet's spiritual leader has made representations world wide to
raise violations of human rights by the Chinese in his country.
   "Tibetans are, at best, second class citizens in their own
country. Deprived of all basis democratic rights and freedoms, they
exist under a colonial administration in which all real power is
wielded by Chinese Communist party and the army," he told IPS.
   The International Student Festival in Trondheim will bring more
than 500 students from 100 countries to what is Europe's most
comprehensive student conference with debate meetings, academic
seminars, work groups and concerts, all on a human rights theme.
   The festival has its own newspaper and will run their own radio
station during the festival. ISFiT is a non-profit festival
financed mainly by the University of Trondheim and Norwegian
government departments and agencies.

CARIBBEAN:  REGIONAL WOMEN ACTIVELY OPPOSING VATICAN'S
            UNCOMPROMISING POSITION AGAINST REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS

By Sheila Rampersad
   PORT OF SPAIN, July 31 (IPS) -- Women's groups in the Caribbean
have joined the international women's movement in opposing the
Vatican's uncompromising anti-abortion position and have insisted
that population policy cannot be discussed in isolation from
reproductive rights and therefore women's rights.
   "Unsafe abortions are a major cause of death, therefore access
to safe abortion should be an integral part of reproductive health
services," says a non-governmental organisation position paper that
will be presented at the World Women's Conference in China next
year.
   The position paper echoes the view of the Caribbean Association
for Feminist Research and Action (CAFRA). The paper noted that Cuba
and Barbados are among the few Caribbean countries that have
decriminalized abortions. A draft bill to achieve this in Guyana
is currently before the Parliament there.
   CAFRA's voice is strong on the connection between reproductive
health and women's rights.
   "In the context of the upcoming International Conference on
Population and Development Caribbean governments should be urged
to actively resist attempts to reject the new framework of
reproductive health and rights which has been negotiated by most
governments, in support of the advocacy of the international
women's movement," the document states.
   The Caribbean's population and family planning experts will
support the CAFRA position this September at the Population
Conference to be held in Cairo, Egypt.
   The Caribbean's policy position states: "Unsafe abortion is also
one of the most neglected underlying causes of reproductive ill
health in the Caribbean and constitutes a major unrecognized social
health issue.
   "Women, adolescents and disadvantaged population groups are
particularly vulnerable to all aspects of reproductive ill health
and satisfactory outcomes cannot be achieved without the full
involvement of both men and women."
   The regional position, outlined in the Port of Spain
Declaration, calls for "the provision of appropriate information
and services in order to prevent unsafe abortions and to ensure
high-quality standards for abortion-related services for
individuals and couples."
   Although there are no data available on just how many illegal
abortions occur in the region, research by CAFRA member Nesha
Haniff shows that many women opt for the unsafe, backyard
procedure.
   According to Haniff, in Guyana, where health care is very poor
and where available, is costly, the rate of abortion is considered
extremely high, although no official figures exist.
   Abortion costs between almost seven dollars (900 Guyanese
dollars) and $15 (2,000 Guyanese dollars).
   "Women interviewed before their abortions said the health system
had failed them and this was being used as a contraceptive device.
They preferred a more long-term, uncomplicated contraceptive with
low maintenance. They had difficulty accepting abortion as an
alternative but wanted to exert control over the pregnancy. Condom
use was intermittent," Haniff said.
   Additionally because of its illegality, many women opt for folk
remedies for unwanted pregnancies.
   In St. Lucia, abortions are also illegal but unlike Guyana,
there is not the same tacit acceptance, according to Haniff.
   "The Catholic religion is very influential, advocating natural
contraceptive methods only and has been problematic for the St.
Lucia Planned parenthood Association," she said.
   In 1983, the crude birth rate was 30 per thousand and St.
Lucia's population was growing at the rate of two percent per
annum. High unemployment, compounded by rapid population growth and
a mounting dependency burden on the state led the government in
1990 to establish the National Population Unit.
   Arguing that reproductive rights are human rights, women's
groups in the Dominican Republic point out that an estimated 25 to
50 percent of maternal deaths in that country are a result of
illegal abortions.
   They estimate that approximately 70,000 women risk their lives
each year in back street procedures. They say that 40 percent of
births in the last five years were unwanted and that 17 percent of
women in a relationship have an unsatisfied demand for
contraceptives.
   Groups in Puerto Rico, where abortion is legalized, report that
since legalization, the number of deaths associated with abortion
has declined considerably.

BANGLADESH:  DHAKA QUIET DURING TWIN ANTI-NASREEN RALLIES

By Tabibul Islam
   DHAKA, July 31 (IPS) -- Leaders of right-wing Islamic groups
warned at two rallies in the Bangladesh capital July 29 that the
government would have to face the consequences if fugitive writer
Taslima Nasreen was not punished.
   Several thousand people mobilized to attend the twin rallies
called separately by the Jamaat-e-Islami and an alliance of 13
other radical parties, listened patiently as their leaders
threatened to launch demonstrations against the government.
   The fundamentalist Jamaat-e-Islamic and the United Action
Council Alliance are separately campaigning for the hanging of the
controversial writer, to make Bangladesh an Islamic republic and
a ban on newspapers and organizations they call anti-Islamic.
   Though the twin rallies passed off uneventfully, security still
remains tight in Dhaka, which has been disturbed by nearly daily
protests, marches and demonstrations by opponents and supporters
of the controversial feminist author.
   The Alliance has given the Khaleda Zia administration seven days
to arrest Nasreen, who went into hiding on June 4 to escape an
arrest warrant and a fatwa for blasphemy.
   At least 100,000 people attended the Alliance rally, but the
much larger one was the rally of the Jamaat-e-Islami which was held
near the Baitulmukarram national mosque in Dhaka.
   Speakers at both the rallies described 32-year-old Nasreen as
a creation of India and the Western world.
   Jamaat chief Golam Azam thundered "Taslima Nasreen was an
unknown writer...she was created by the Western world and India to
malign Islam," he thundered.
   S.M. Suleiman of the Alliance urged the government to scrap all
treaties with India and boycott all Indian goods.
   However, Golam Azam, trying to strike a more balanced note, said
his party was keen on maintaining good relations with its giant
neighbor to the west. "But India must not encourage those attacking
Islam," he added.
   Religious extremists have accused India of supporting Nasreen,
who first raised a storm last year after the publication of her
book "Lajja" (Shame), a story of a Hindu family in Bangladesh
during the riots that swept the country in December 1992.
   The head of a then little-known radical group in the Bangladeshi
town of Sylhet issued a fatwa against Nasreen and a huge cash
reward.
   Nasreen was living under police protection in Dhaka until June
3 when a warrant for her arrest was issued by a Bangladeshi court
for her provocative interview to the Indian newspaper, The
Statesman.
   The English-language daily, published from Calcutta, quotes the
outspoken writer calling for a revision of the Koran. Nasreen has
said she was misquoted.
   Almost daily strikes and protests between Nasreen's opponents
and supporters, who believe she has the right to freedom of speech,
disrupted normal life in Bangladesh through June.
   The Bangladesh government is under pressure from the West to
protect the 32-year-old fugitive writer who is being described as
the female Salman Rushdie.
   Nasreen is accused of "maliciously outraging the religious
feelings of Muslims", a charge the religious extremists insist must
be punished with death.
