<p align="center"><b>Massachusetts Medical Marijuana Research
Program<br>
May Breathe New Life From Assembly Measure</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>July 30, 1996: Boston, Massachusetts:</b>&nbsp;
A bill (H. 2170) introduced by Rep. Patricia Jehlen (D-Somerville)
that would reinvigorate the state marijuana therapeutic research
program and eventually provide for a medical necessity legal
defense has passed the Massachusetts state assembly and now
awaits the signature of Gov. William Weld.&nbsp; Sources close to
Gov. Weld indicate that he will sign the bill into law. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">As amended by the state legislature, H. 2170 will direct the
Massachusetts Department of Public Health (DPH) to pass rules and
regulations within 180 days for the establishment of a marijuana
medical research program.&nbsp; Like many states, Massachusetts
had previously adopted legislation allowing for such a program,
but had never addressed the issues of funding, regulations, or
viable sources for marijuana. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;The new law does not solve the problem of the federal
government's denial of access to legal marijuana, but it puts
Massachusetts on the record as aggressively researching the
issues of treatment and supply,&quot; said <b>NORML</b> Legal
Committee member Michael Cutler, Esq. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;[It] creates pressure for a legal source to be
created,&quot; added an aid from Rep. Jehlen's office.&nbsp; &quot;[It
is] a step in the right direction.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The measure also provides patients who are certified to
participate in the program a legal defense against marijuana
charges.&nbsp; This provision was a concession from the
legislation's original intent which would have allowed any
patient with a physician's pre-trial diagnosis of medical necessity
to use the defense.&nbsp; Weld expressed concern that the bill~s
original language was overly broad. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The governor has 10 days to either sign or veto the measure. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;By enacting this law, [Gov. Weld] will allow attention to
the medicinal needs of patients, whose access to treatment is
blocked by the identity of their necessary medicine rather than
by conduct which they can control,&quot; summarized Cutler.&nbsp;
&quot;For many patients, their use of marijuana enables them to
support themselves and their families rather than being totally
disabled and publicly supported.&nbsp; For these patients, who
risk arrest and prosecution every day for the crime of desiring an
ordinary quality of life, this law provides hope for a rational
future of doctor-patient therapies free from governmental
interference.&quot; <br>

<p align="center"><b>Update: Welfare Reform Bill Amendment
Altered<br>
To Deny Federal Benefits To Those Convicted On Felony Drug
Charges Only</b> </p>

<p align="left"><br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>August 1, 1996, Washington, D.C.:</b>&nbsp; Most recreational
marijuana smokers will be exempted from the provisions of a last
minute amendment (Samdt. 4935) introduced by Sen. Phil Gram (R-Texas)
that denies for life federal assistance-based benefits to all
individuals convicted on felony drug charges.&nbsp; The amendment
is part of Congress' overall welfare reform package. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In the measure's original form, the law additionally denied
&quot;means-tested&quot; federal benefits for five years for
anyone convicted of a marijuana misdemeanor.&nbsp; Possession of
a small amount marijuana is generally treated as a misdemeanor in
all 50 states.&nbsp; The initial language was overwhelmingly
approved by the Senate. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Gramm's amendment was altered during recent debate in conference
committee.&nbsp; As the amendment stands now, it will only apply
to future felony drug convictions and states will be able to opt
out of the program if they enact legislation to do so.&nbsp;
President Bill Clinton has agreed to sign the welfare reform
package into law. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;The conference committee has provided relief for some
marijuana smokers by altering Gramm's amendment; however, this
bill still unfairly and inappropriately targets drug users,&quot;
noted <b>NORML</b> Deputy Director Allen St. Pierre.&nbsp; Pierre
noted that under the revised amendment, a murderer, rapist, or
robber could receive federal funds and benefits, but not an
individual convicted of cultivating marijuana. <br>

<p align="center"><b>California Law Enforcement Must Procure A
Warrant<br>
Before Using Heat Scanning Devices</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>July 26, 1996, Sacramento, CA:</b>&nbsp; The
California Supreme Court has let stand a 1st District Appellate
Court decision mandating that state law enforcement officials
must procure a warrant before conducting thermal imaging searches
of private residences where they suspect drug cultivation may be
taking place.&nbsp; The lower court ruling is now binding on
trial courts statewide. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Only Justices Marvin Baxter and Ming Chin voted to grant a
hearing on the prosecution appeal; four votes are required for a
hearing by the seven-member court. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;The use of thermal imaging devices can give law enforcement
information regarding activities taking place inside a residence
that they would not otherwise be privy to without procuring a search
warrant and entering the house,&quot; stated <b>NORML</b> Deputy
Director Allen St. Pierre.&nbsp; &quot;By its very nature, it is
an intrusive practice that constitutes an unreasonable search
within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment to the United States
Constitution.&nbsp; Therefore, it should require a warrant.&nbsp; <b>NORML</b>
applauds the actions of the California court.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In its decision this April, the 1st District Court of Appeals
likened the use of thermal imaging to that of electronically
tracking the movement of chemicals inside a home by using a
beeper.&nbsp; The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1984 (<i>U.S. v.
Karo</i>) that a warrant must be attained before law enforcement
can use a beeper. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Like the beeper signal ... the thermal imaging scan of
[the] residence told the police something about activities within
the house which they could not otherwise have learned without
obtaining a warrant,&quot; opined Justice Marc Poche.&nbsp;
&quot;PreciseIy because the thermal imaging is indiscriminate in registering
sources of heat, it is an intrusive tool which tells much about
the activities inside the home which may be quite unrelated to
any illicit activity.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;... [Therefore,] we find that society recognizes as
reasonable an expectation that the heat generated from within a
private residence may not be measured by the government without a warrant
permitting such a search.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><i>For more information on the use of thermal imaging, please

<p align="center"><b>Update: Partnership For A Drug Free America<br>
Agrees To Modify Ad Criticized As &quot;Patently Homophobic&quot;</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>July 29, 1996, New York City, NY:</b>&nbsp;
The Partnership for a Drug Free America has agreed to re-edit a
series of anti-heroin public service announcements that had drawn
sharp criticism from the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against
Defamation (GLAAD). <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The ad in question featured a teenager named David whose life
plummets downhill because of an addiction to heroin.&nbsp; The ad
concluded with the narrator saying: &quot;And now I have sex with
men for money to support my habit.&nbsp; ... I wish I didn't have
to be like this.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">GLAAD first voiced opposition to the spot early this month
alleging that the ad &quot;had the potential to exacerbate
higher-than-average risks gay and lesbian youths face for
substance abuse and suicide by implying that being gay is worse
than being addicted to heroin.&quot;&nbsp; At that time, PDFA President
Richard Bonette refused GLAAD's request to pull the ad. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Recently, however, Bonette has experienced a change of
heart.&nbsp; He now says that the spots will be re-edited to omit
the references to prostitution.&nbsp; &quot;A perception of
offense, however unintended, [may] dilute or interfere our basic
message&quot; of keeping adolescents drug free, Bonette recently explained
in a letter to GLAAD. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Alan Klein, news media director at GLAAD said, &quot;We're very
much pleased that the Partnership has taken the concerns of the
gay and lesbian community serious.&quot;</p>
