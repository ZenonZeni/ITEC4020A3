Technology &amp; Health: On-Line Service to Assist Global Trade --- Venture Led <br>
by GE, AT&amp;T Will Let Firms Negotiate<br>
09/26/95 02:14<br>
  A group of multinational companies is expected to unveil today an on-line<br>
service to allow large and small businesses to engage in international <br>
trade.<br>
<p>
  The new service, dubbed International Business Exchange, or IBEX, is a <br>
joint<br>
effort of AT&amp;T Corp., Dun &amp; Bradstreet Corp., General Electric Co. and the <br>
U.S.<br>
Chamber of Commerce to let businesses use on-line traffic to line up <br>
suppliers,<br>
negotiate contracts, make and receive bids, and arrange the delivery of <br>
goods<br>
and services around the world.<br>
<p>
  IBEX today also is expected to announce the backing of four new <br>
high-profile<br>
partners: Chase Manhattan Corp., Microsoft Corp., Digital Equipment Corp. <br>
and<br>
Viacom Inc.'s Simon &amp; Schuster publishing unit.<br>
<p>
  "The way people conduct international trade today is they look at <br>
directories,<br>
they get on airplanes and they receive unsolicited letters," said Peter<br>
Sandiford, chief executive and president of the Global Business Alliance <br>
Inc.,<br>
which manages IBEX. "This system allows businesses to locate, qualify and<br>
negotiate with business partners around the world from your PC."<br>
<p>
  Scores of companies are developing tools for so-called electronic <br>
commerce,<br>
largely focusing on enabling business-oriented transactions on the Internet. <br>
The<br>
IBEX system will be launched as a discrete on-line service and is to be<br>
accessible via the Internet sometime next year.<br>
<p>
  The new service will be based on networks provided by AT&amp;T and GE. Digital<br>
Equipment will handle software orders and provide the IBEX package in its <br>
PCs,<br>
while the Chamber of Commerce, a nonprofit business federation, will resell <br>
the<br>
service through more than 3,000 offices world-wide.<br>
<p>
  Such corporate muscle could give the service the strength it needs to <br>
build<br>
business-to-business electronic relationships. "They're working with the <br>
right<br>
people," said Brian O'Connell, staff editor at Technologic Partners, a <br>
high-tech<br>
publishing and consulting firm. Companies such as Dun &amp; Bradstreet and AT&amp;T, <br>
he<br>
said, "are as close to global organizations as you can get."<br>
<p>
  The IBEX software allows companies to sign on and submit a request for <br>
goods<br>
or services, which is posted anonymously. The request could be styled using <br>
an<br>
array of categories offered by the service, including location, product<br>
category, payment and shipping terms. The customer would then receive bids <br>
from<br>
businesses hoping to land the contract.<br>
<p>
  Once a bid is chosen, the identities of the businesses are disclosed and<br>
negotiations begin. IBEX allows them to attach documents such as <br>
confidentiality<br>
agreements, contracts and purchase orders.<br>
<p>
  The service amounts to a virtual business agent. "You are able to create <br>
the<br>
services provided by an in-country agent from your PC," said IBEX's Mr.<br>
Sandiford.<br>
<p>
  Stan Lepeak, program manager for Meta Group, a research firm, said the new<br>
service "is a good quick way to engage in true electronic commerce without <br>
the<br>
baggage" of Internet security concerns and the relatively high cost of<br>
commercial on-line services. IBEX, he noted, costs $250 to register for the<br>
service and a paltry $5 per transaction.<br>
<p>
  Analysts noted, however, the difficulties IBEX may face in gaining<br>
international acceptance and getting businesses to trust counterparts they <br>
may<br>
never meet off-line.<br>
<p>
  Esther Dyson, president of EDventure Holdings Inc., which publishes the<br>
hightech newsletter Release 1.0, said IBEX needed to provide protection <br>
against<br>
"deadbeats and jerks" that might fail to honor contracts. Moreover, "people<br>
outside the U.S. don't have credit cards, and there are currency and tax<br>
regulations they'll have to deal with," Ms. Dyson said.<br>
<p>
  Mr. Sandiford said there was no way to guarantee that a company would <br>
honor a<br>
deal, but there are tools for due diligence. When companies sign on to the<br>
service, they offer a host of references that can be contacted <br>
independently.<br>
Potential customers of a company can also refer to information provided by <br>
D&amp;B<br>
and contract a third-party consultant to conduct due diligence in a foreign<br>
country.<br>
