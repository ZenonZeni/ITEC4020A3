<H1><CENTER>Entrepreneurial Europe</CENTER></H1><P>


<I>Among the hallway topics at last week's BioPartnering Europe conference in London, one could hear debated whether Europe was on the brink of creating a critical mass of homegrown biotechnology ventures. As is usually the case, commentary ranged from the optimistic to the skeptical. To provide a flavor of the emerging biotech enterprise in Europe, BioCentury this week offers profiles of three early-stage companies that are pursuing chimeric technology, gene therapy, and "combinatorial biology". </I><P>

<B><CENTER>XTL's chimeric technology</B></CENTER><P>

When Martin Becker joined XTL Biopharmaceuticals Ltd. as President and CEO in November 1994 from Syntex Corp., XTL had technology but no business strategy. Becker has spent the past few months focusing the company's efforts on the use of its chimeric animal technology to develop fully human monoclonal antibodies and the creation of improved animal models that can be used in-house and in conjunction with corporate partners to develop improved lead compounds.<P>

Based in Rehovot, Israel, XTL was formed to develop engraftment technology, developed by Yair Reisner at the Weizmann Institute of Science, that enables the production of chimeric rodents with functioning human immune systems and other human tissues. XTL was incorporated in 1992 by Yeda, Weizmann's licensing and business development arm.<P>

While looking for ways to eliminate graft rejection, Reisner found that by severely irradiating mice and reconstituting their hematopoietic systems by transplanting cells from SCID (severe combined immunodeficiency) mice, he could reconstitute their myeloid and erythroid lineages without producing mouse antibodies. Peripheral blood lymphocytes from human donors and/or other human tissue then can be transplanted, leading to a human/mouse chimera.<P>

<B><CENTER>Exploiting the asset</B></CENTER><P>

The question then was what to do with these mice. One possibility was to make human antibodies. The mice have a fully human lymphoid system, so when they are given an antigen, they have a human antibody response. They generate HLA-restricted cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) following immunogen administration, in contrast to hu/SCID mice, which generally display anergy and have difficulty generating CTLs, according to the company. <P>

The mice also can be produced using differing extant strains, such as BALB/c, nude and BNX, which allows XTL to choose different strains for different purposes.<P>

Becker believes that one advantage of using fully human antibodies versus humanized antibodies is that the former have higher affinity and thus may require less drug to achieve an equivalent treatment effect. The antibodies show proper maturation, with class switching from IgM to IgG, he said.<P>

It also is possible to put other human tissue into the mice, such as liver. When the company puts in liver that has been infected with hepatitis C or B virus ex vivo, nucleic acid sequences of HBV and HCV start appearing in the blood two weeks after transplant. To derive high-affinity antibodies, XTL is putting lymphoid cells in its mice from human patients who have successfully cleared the virus, and boosting their response with a vaccine.<P>

The company has isolated 10 MAbs against HBV thus far and is developing them  for passive immunotherapy of needlestick, neonates born to mothers with HBV, and liver transplant in recipients with HBV. XTL intends to have a clinical candidate within eight months.<P>

XTL has formed its first corporate partnership in its hepatitis C program, signing an option agreement with the BioChem Therapeutics Inc. subsidiary of BioChem Pharma Inc. (BCHXF), to explore use of the mice as a model to test drugs against HCV.<P>

The rodents thus can serve both as animal models of disease and as sources of human monoclonal antibodies. However, XTL doesn't intend to develop its animal model capabilities into a service business. The company will use them either to aid in the development of its own compounds or as part of a collaboration for which it would receive royalties.<P>

In the area of autoimmune disease, XTL is developing MAbs to gamma interferon, which plays an important role in biasing the immune system to a Th1 response. When that response is over-amplified, as it is in many autoimmune diseases, it can lead to the generation of auto-aggressive CTLs that cause tissue destruction. The company is targeting multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus and Type I diabetes. <P>

Gamma interferon also plays an important role in XTL's third program in organ rejection, where blocking interferon gamma may be useful in preventing allograft rejection or in transplant rescue.<P>

The company also is working to develop new animal models. One project is to develop a model of MS that is more relevant than the currently used EAE model. Another goal is to develop a good mouse model of hepatitis. The best existing model is the chimpanzee, which is expensive . The company also is developing models for immunotherapy of human tumors.<P>

Like most startups these days, XTL has no intention of becoming fully integrated, but plans to collaborate with corporate partners to conduct clinical development and marketing. XTL believes it can add value to lead compounds from its alliance partners by providing improved animal models for drug development.<P>

XTL has raised $8 million to date and is in the midst of a private placement in the U.S., Israel and the U.K. with the goal of raising at least $3.5 million. The company aims to achieve profitability in seven years, using pharmaceutical alliances to partially fund R&D. Prior to an initial public offering in about three years, XTL anticipates needing one or two small ($3.5-$6 million) private placements.<P>

While Israel is clearly off the beaten path of biotech, XTL's location confers certain advantages, Becker said. It's a good place to do clinical trials, with a base of highly educated clinicians and scientists, modern infrastructure, a less expensive work force and less government bureaucracy. <P>

In addition, because much of Europe, with the exception of the U.K., isn't well-served by venture capital, European academics have few outlets for the development of their inventions and are eager to collaborate with what biotech companies do exist -- even as far away as Israel, Becker said.<P>

Unusual among Israeli biotech companies, the core management team at XTL has previous experience at biotech and pharmaceutical companies. In addition to Becker's experience at Syntex, COO Zachi Berger has been at Pharmos Corp. and Vice President of Research Shlomo Dagan came from ImClone Systems Inc. and an Israeli biotech company, Biomakor. <P>
