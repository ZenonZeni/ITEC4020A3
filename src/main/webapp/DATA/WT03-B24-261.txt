<p><strong>WASHINGTON</strong> - President Clinton appointed a new "national 
security" team last week, tapping U.N. Ambassador Madeline 
Albright as secretary of state and Republican Senator 
William Cohen of Maine as defense secretary.</p>

<p>As part of the "shake up," Clinton also appointed national 
security advisor Anthony Lake CIA chief and Lake's deputy, 
Samuel Berger, to the national security council job.</p>

<p>The appointments, which are subject to Senate confirmation, 
received praise from Democrats and Republicans, including 
Jesse Helms of North Carolina, who called for a new spirit 
of bipartisanship. Peace forces, however, took a different 
view of the appointments.</p>

<p>Vice-Admiral John Shanahan, director of the Center for 
Defense information, said secretary Cohen would be "nibbling 
around the margins of the defense budget, rather than taking 
a serious look at reducing spending."</p>

<p>"I would like to think that the new secretary of defense 
would come up with a plan to reduce expenditures at least 
$50 billion. I sense that what will happen, however, is that 
expenditures will be kept at current levels," he said in a 
telephone interview.</p>

<p>Shanahan pointed to new military aircraft already in the 
authorization stage, including the F-22, the F-16 and the 
so-called "joint strike fighter" - which will cost $360 
billion to design and manufacture - as "unnecessary 
expenditures" that benefit only defense contractors.<p>

<p>"It's no secret that companies like Lockheed and Boeing 
[which will build the new aircraft] have too much influence 
on Congress," Shanahan told the World. He said the American 
people want more spending on health care and education and 
"according to a recent poll, 70 percent want to spend less 
on the Pentagon."</p>

<p>Cynde Nordone, a Catholic nun who directs a local chapter of 
Jobs with Peace, sees the appointments signaling business as 
usual in Washington. "Unfortunately, I've not heard or seen 
anything yet [from Clinton's new team] that would indicate a 
resolve to reduce military spending," she said.</p>

<p>Nordone is a member of the School Sisters of Notre Dame, an 
order which works with poor women in Baltimore. She agrees 
with Shanahan that money should be taken from military 
spending and put into domestic programs.</p>

<p>The appointment that has received the most attention is that 
of Albright. She is said to be fervently anti-Cuba, which 
explains the warm endorsement she received from Jesse Helms. 
Albright is not generally liked in the U.N., where she has 
spearheaded the effort to dump popular secretary-general 
Boutros Boutros-Ghali.</p>
