NOTES: FIRST INTERSTATE GIVES IN TO WELLS FARGO

First Interstate Bancorp finally gave in last month to the unwelcome
approaches of its Californian neighbour Wells Fargo. The resulting
merger, valued at dollars 11.6 billion, is the biggest in US bank
history and a rare example of a successful hostile bid.

After several months of fighting, when the end came for First
Interstate it came quickly. On Monday 22 January the bank announced
that it had started talking to Wells. By Wednesday, the deal was
agreed.

The agreement left First Interstate's rival suitor, First Bank System
(FBS) of Minneapolis, on the shelf.

FBS had come in as a white knight to rescue First Interstate. As
compensation, the Minneapolis bank receives a dollars 200 million
termination fee.

Two developments appeared to have prompted First Interstate's volte
face.

The potential benefits of the FBS merger had been undermined by a
Securities and Exchange Commission ruling that, because the deal was
structured as a 'pooling of interests' the group would not be able to
undertake any substantial stock repurchases for two years afterwards.

Meanwhile, the strength of the Wells stock price had boosted the value
of its bid and the gap over the alternative. The terms of the offer -
two-thirds of a Wells share for each First Interstate - have not
changed since Wells upped its first bid (The Banker, 12/95, p4), but
its worth has.

At the time of the announcement, in contrast, the FBS offer was worth
some dollars 10.1 billion.

The get-together is expected to lead to some substantial cuts in
staffing and branch networks as Wells gets to grips with the
considerable overlaps between the two groups and creates a new major to
challenge the strengths of BankAmerica in California.

Wells, based in San Francisco, has 983 banking locations in the state,
increasingly focused on supermarket outlets rather than traditional
branches. First Interstate, Los Angeles-based, has a total of 1,140
offices in 13 western states; 406 are in California. The network will
be reduced. So will staff levels; Wells has indicated that around 7,500
jobs would go as part of an dollars 800 million cost cutting programme.

NOTES: NEW LOOK FOR FIRST UNION

First Union Corporation of North Carolina has acquired a new dimension
as a result of its merger with New Jersey's First Fidelity. As well as
creating the sixth largest US bank holding company, with assets of some
dollars 126 billion and covering 12 eastern states plus Washington DC,
the deal has brought a substantial addition to First Union's
international armoury.

First Fidelity has had a significant presence in London since 1973. The
branch, where Richard Morley remains as general manager, has now been
re-labelled with the First Union logo.

Until recently, the North Carolina bank's international involvement had
been minimal. Andrew Oleksiw, US-based managing director, international
division, explains that the group has focused over the last 10 years on
growing internally and being 'a high performance bank in the US'.

Until the latest merger, First Union's growth to its present position
had been in a rather lower key than that of its immediate neighbour in
Charlotte, NationsBank.

Daniel Mathis, US-based managing director of First Union's capital
markets group, says that over a period of 10 years the group has made
some 60 acquisitions, many of them small and designed to fill in the
coverage. They often produced significant cost savings.

With the First Fidelity deal, he says, there is no overlap and
therefore no great economies. But with the extended branch network in
the US, he sees opportunities to sell existing products to new
customers.

Oleksiw explains that in the home market the group had focused on four
main areas. First, international corporate banking, particularly for US
subsidiaries of foreign companies in its region. Second, trade finance,
where he argues that with its technology the group can offer lower
processing costs on letters of credit, for example, than the money
centre banks.

Third, correspondent banking. And fourth, something of a speciality
because of its acquired presence in Washington, banking for embassies,
which often have procurement and economic development agencies there.

Now the group is looking at a new horizon, supporting US corporations
abroad. Oleksiw says Latin America, which is in the same time zone and
easily accessible, does not require a physical presence; not having one
can boost correspondent banking business.

In the far East, the group established a joint venture company in
Hongkong with the Hong Kong Chinese Bank to support US companies with
trade in Asia.

The company, First Union HKCB Asia, 'is expected to process over
dollars 1 billion annually in trade transactions by the end of the
decade'. First Union has also opened a representative office in South
Africa.

Says Oleksiw: 'That left us with Europe. We were looking here before
the acquisition. The preference would have been to buy a small bank and
tweak it to fit; we weren't able to find the right opportunities. It is
fortuitous that we bought First Fidelity which had an operation with a
London focus.' First Union has identified more than 2,500 companies
based in its home market area with UK subsidiaries. Morley could have
his work cut out.

NOTES: GANGLAND GAMBLE

Big names on a little list? So it would appear from the furore that has
erupted in Japan with the revelation that a relative few big borrowers
account for over 40% of total loans from the country's seven bankrupt
housing loan corporations (Jusen). The sixty four thousand dollar (or
rather Yen 628 billion) question is, who are these people? It has been
widely believed that the Jusen collapsed because they got in way over
their heads during the orgy of real-estate lending that occured during
Japan's bubble economy. Once asset values collapsed their loans went
bad and that was that.

A more sinister interpretation is emerging, however, that seems certain
to show up prime minister Ryutaro Hashimoto's Liberal Democratic Party
in an unfavourable light - assuming that the full details ever come
out.

The picture that is coming slowly into focus is one of a corrupt
alliance among Japanese bankers, bureaucrats and organised crime
(Yakuza) syndicates to exploit the profits of the bubble economy.

The government has released lists of the leading 50 borrowers at each
Jusen, though no names as yet. There is strong public interest in
knowing who they are because of the growing realisation that in the
case of many big borrowers from the Jusen they are simply refusing to
repay debts rather than being unable to do so. And yet taxpayers are
being asked to cough up Yen 628 billion (dollars 598 million) toward
the clean-up of the Jusen mess.

It has been assumed, too, that the Jusen's Yakuza debtors, nasty enough
as they are to have shot dead one bank manager who tried to collect
debts and to have stabbed another, were on the fringe of the Jusen
problem.

However, the figures show that debts held by major borrowers at the
Jusen amounted in total to Yen 4.4 trillion or 41% of the total loans
outstanding.

In the case of four of the Jusen, the top 50 borrowers include
(anonymous) individuals.

'Public servants are bound by law not to disclose secrets,' declared
prime minister Hashimoto, although the finance ministry said it would
consider releasing names to a closed session of Japan's national Diet
(parliament) upon request.

What makes the affair even more intriguing is that no fewer than 473 of
the total 532 senior executives of the Jusen were supposedly
respectable Japanese bankers.

Banks founded and funded the Jusen, along with hundreds of Japanese
agricultural co-operatives, but they also played a large part in
managing them. A dozen of their executives were also former senior
officials of the Ministry of Finance.

The Jusen affair has an almost uncanny resonance with the great
'compensation' deal scandal that embroiled most of Japan's leading
securities houses in 1991.

At that time, news leaked out that the big brokerages had paid some of
their biggest clients huge sums to compensate them for losses they
suffered when the great Tokyo bull market of the late 1980s collapsed.

The legions of small investors who had to take their knocks in the
market were not delighted to learn of this, though it was assumed that
the favoured few were so big that the brokers wanted to stay on the
right side of them at any cost.

The question now is - were they also gangsters whom the brokers were
terrified of confronting?

NOTES: FLAK-FIGHTER STEPS DOWN

Brian Quinn, who is stepping down at the end of this month as Bank of
England executive director responsible for banking supervision, has
lived in interesting times.

During his tenure, two dramatic bank crashes have brought the Bank's
role under the spotlight and created a good deal of flak aimed at the
supervisors, including suggestions that the supervisory role should be
removed from the central bank.

The 1991 closure of the fraud-ridden Bank of Credit & Commerce
International (BCCI), where the Bank played a leading role, led to the
Bingham report and in turn to significant developments in the Bank's
operations. Last year's collapse of Barings brought further criticism
and more reports to be followed up.

That task falls to Michael Foot, deputy in the supervisory department,
who will take Quinn's place.

NOTES: NCB TAKES ITS PARTNERS

Partnerships may still be in fashion at Goldman Sachs but elsewhere,
from accountancy firms to banks, incorporation is preferred. In Saudi
Arabia, the largest bank in the Arab world, National Commercial Bank
(NCB), has been a partnership since it was established in 1951. But
times may be changing.

In the late 1980s and early 1990s NCB went through a difficult period
where it was forced for various reasons, including involvements with
Bank of Credit & Commerce International (BCCI), to withdraw from many
of its international operations. In recent years, however, the bank has
undergone a reorganisation and last month chairman Mohammed bin Mahfouz
announced another year of record profits with NCB's net income in 1995
up 20% over the SR579 million(dollars 154 million) achieved in 1994 and
an improvement in the net return on partners' equity from 8.3% to 9.9%.

The improved performance is not all that has changed. Early last year
the bank's founder Salim bin Mahfouz died, which focused attention on
the ownership of the bank which was known to be spread among the
Mahfouz and Kaki families.

While the partnership form has been maintained it is understood that
the entire ownership of the bank is now in the hands of former chief
executive Khalid bin Mahfouz, who is no longer involved in the bank's
management.

With Khalid bin Mahfouz now owning 100%, the bank's ownership structure
has been streamlined. But NCB remains unincorporated and not listed on
the local stock exchange like other banks.

Bankers suggest that if NCB wants to expand abroad again and utilise
the growing domestic capital markets then it would need to be
incorporated.

The question now is whether Khalid bin Mahfouz's sole partnership will
go the way of Goldman Sachs or seek incorporation.

NOTES: A TRULY BRITISH IDENTITY

UBAF Bank, the majority Arab-owned institution founded in London in
1972, is to change its name in early March to British Arab Commercial
Bank (BACB).

The purpose of the change, according to chief executive Peter Taplin,
is to reinforce the bank's identity as a British-based institution
licensed and supervised by the Bank of England.

The bank has six Arab shareholders, including Libyan Arab Foreign Bank
(36.5%), Central Bank of Egypt (7.9%) and Rafidain Bank (4.9%) as well
as a major British shareholder, Midland Bank (24.8%).

The new name will reflect the bank's prime role of conducting business
with banks and other customers in the Arab world.

NOTES: PRIVATE CASH HEADS EAST

Total capital flows to leading emerging markets in 1995 were around
record levels of about dollars 216 billion despite the Mexican peso
crisis. Total private capital flows to these markets in 1996 are
projected to be robust, demonstrating the substantial continuing
investor interest in emerging economies, says the Washington-based
Institute of International Finance (IIF).

In its 1996 capital flows forecasts the IIF says that private financial
flows to the leading 30 emerging economies may total around dollars 175
billion, much the same as the totals in 1994 and 1995 and comparable to
the 1993 record flow of dollars 192 billion.

Official flows, which increased substantially in 1995 after the Mexican
crisis and reached dollars 41 billion, are expected to decline to
around dollars 11 billion in 1996.

Developments in markets in leading industrial countries are expected to
have a profound impact on flows to emerging economies.

'The continuation of relatively low world interest rates during 1996,
and improving economic fundamentals in many developing countries,
suggest that there will be strong investor interest in emerging markets
this year,' says Charles Dallara, IIF managing director. 'We anticipate
a substantial rebound in bond financing and increased direct
investment, offset by a reduction in short-term lending by banks from
the high levels seen last year.'

Latin America and Asia-Pacific have been the prime areas of capital
flows to emerging markets. The IIF predicts that private flows to Latin
America will reach about dollars 52 billion in 1996 after dropping to
dollars 37 billion in 1995, while private flows to Asia-Pacific will
amount to dollars 87 billion in 1996 compared to dollars 94 billion in
1995. The IIF also forecasts that real GDP growth will average 2.7 % in
Latin America in 1996 after 0.4% growth in 1995 while Asia-Pacific will
again be the powerhouse with expected growth this year of 8.4% after
reaching 9.0% in 1995.

NOTES: EMERGING MARKETS

It was a year to forget for emerging markets investors and fund
managers. Many are choosing to bury memories by focusing on a brighter
1996. The markets suffered from foreign investors' confidence crisis
following the Mexican devaluation in late 1994 and early 1995. US fund
managers, in particular, found little incentive to venture beyond the
comforts of home into riskier markets, thanks to the strong performance
of the US equity market, which rose 34.7% in dollars, according to the
Morgan Stanley Capital International US Index.

In 1995, the IFC Investable Composite Index fell 10.3% in dollar terms,
after a 13.8% fall in the index in 1994, in contrast with the MSCI
World Index, which rose 18.7% in dollar terms. Among regional IFC
indices, Latin America dropped 18.7% and Asia 6.9%.

Europe/Mideast/Africa provided a ray of light, with its 19.5% increase,
although the region ex-South Africa registered a fall of 6.9%.

The best performers among the IFC Investable Indices in 1995 were
headed by Jordan, which rose 23.1% in dollar terms, followed by South
Africa with a 14.8% increase and Zimbabwe with 12.3%. The runners-up
were Peru, up 10.6% and Indonesia, which climbed 9.9%.

Jordan was seen as a play on the Middle East peace process by foreign
investors. It also received a boost from a 1995 investment law, which
lifted restrictions on the entry of foreign capital.

South Africa enjoyed an inflow of around dollars 1.4 billion of foreign
money into equities in 1995, says Vikas Nath, emerging market
strategist of UBS, after entrance into several indices, including the
IFC Investable Indices, and return to the international investment
scene.

Macro-economic fundamentals improved and falling inflation, among other
factors, spurred a huge bond rally in the last four months of the year.

South Africa's good performance also boosted Zimbabwe, explains Nath.

Zimbabwe's rise also reflects a slight recovery from the impact of a
drought in late 1994 and 1995, says Nigel Rendell, emerging markets
strategist at James Capel.

Worst performers were Sri Lanka, with a fall of 39.5% in 1995; Hungary
with 35.1%; and India with 34.9%. Pakistan, with a fall of 33.7%, was
close behind.

Foreigners were scared off from Sri Lanka by the civil war and
terrorism; Pakistan was also hit by political turmoil. India came off
the boil after the 1994 euphoria. 'A lot of people are tipping India as
a key market for 1996 after such a disastrous 1995,' says Rendell.

Hungary was tarnished in the eyes of foreign investors by big budget
and current account deficits at the start of 1995, but a stabilisation
plan announced in March 1995 has been quite successful in reducing
them.

Michael Howell, head strategist at ING Barings, projects about dollars
50 billion of cross-border equity flows to emerging markets in 1996
(including Hongkong, China and Singapore), from dollars 15 billion in
1995.

He expects foreign buying in 1996 will be felt strongly by two regions:
Asia-Pacific, specifically Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand and
Indonesia; and the 'embryo' emerging markets, notably Eastern Europe
and Russia.

He forecasts these regions, which comprise around 25% of the emerging
stock market capitalisation, will receive around dollars 20 billion. He
adds that more cash will also go into sub-Saharan Africa: 'This indeed
could be the region to surprise investors in 1996'.

Jane Hakham, investment director of Beta Funds, picks Argentina and
Poland as her favourites for 1996. She believes Argentina did not
deserve the pasting it received in the wake of the Mexican crisis and
is 'definitely due for a recovery'. With 1996 price/earnings ratios of
about 10 times or less for some stocks, the market is 'really very
cheap', she says. She also finds Poland, on a P/E of about 7 for 1996,
good value.

Of new markets, Hakham likes Egypt, which has 1995 P/Es of about 8-8.5.
The market is a 'turnaround story', which will benefit indirectly from
the Middle East peace process. China, Pakistan and Turkey could also be
turnaround stories for 1996, she thinks.

Nath of UBS, for the first half of 1996, recommends overweighting
Turkey, South Korea, Chile, Israel and Thailand; and 'neutral plus'
positions for Brazil and South Africa.

Rendell also favours Poland for 1996 and Brazil, if it can engineer
crucial reforms of the tax system and public sector pensions.

FOREIGN BANKS IN LONDON: THE SECRET COST OF TAX

Foreign banks with branches in the UK face complex tax legislation and
a wide variety of taxes. A branch bank operating in the UK has its own
UK corporation tax liability as well as responsibilities for the
collection of tax from its employees and the people with whom it does
business. The Inland Revenue has taken an increasing interest in banks'
proper application of the rules for deduction of tax at source in
recent years, and this has been expensive for banks which were not
aware of their obligations.

Few banks in London have not had to face detailed questioning by the
Inland Revenue before their accounts are agreed. This is due to the
complexity of banking business and the fact that banking business is
often carried out by a branch; branch accounts seldom carry a statutory
audit opinion.

A bank operating in the UK through a branch must pay corporation tax on
the profits attributable to the business carried out in the UK. The
Inland Revenue is concerned that the UK branch accounts accurately
reflect those profits. Recently it has looked in great depth at the
extent to which loans booked in the UK branch are genuinely London
business.

It was initially concerned that loans were being booked in London to
take advantage of the UK's generous tax credit rules. However, in 1987
these were changed and its concern in recent years has been that loans
on which large losses have been made do not belong in London. Loan
losses have wiped out many branch bank profits over the last few years
so it is clearly beneficial for the Inland Revenue to be able to argue
that these losses do not belong in the UK branch accounts.

In deciding where a loan belongs the Inland Revenue uses Organisation
for Economic Co-operation & Development criteria, which look at where
the following took place:

* the offer of the new business;

* establishing the borrower's credit rating and the risk involved in
the loan;

* negotiation of the terms;

* the decision to make the loan;

* conclusion of the contract and disbursement of the funds; and

* administration of the loan.

Of these the first four are the most important. Where a bank makes
large provisions it is likely to face questions from the Inland Revenue
about which country the above functions took place in. The Inland
Revenue does not carry out audits, in the way that the tax authorities
of some countries do, but it may ask to see loan files or loan
documentation in order to establish that loans belong in the UK.

It will not usually accept that the transfer of loans from one branch
to another is effective for tax purposes. If a loan was initially
booked in the London branch its view is that the profits associated
with it cannot be transferred to another branch even if all the risk
and administration of the loan is transferred as well.

Another area of Inland Revenue interest is ensuring that a UK branch
receives adequate reward for work done for other parts of the bank.
This includes the raising of funds on the London markets for other
parts of the bank when the London branch is expected to make a margin
on the transaction.

The other side of the coin is the amounts paid to other parts of the
bank for work done for the UK branch. Here the Inland Revenue wants to
be sure that profits are not shifted out of the UK by the use of
charges for work performed outside the UK. A bank must be able to
justify its intra-group charges by reference to the amounts which would
be charged by third parties.

Two particular deductions claimed by most branch banks operating in
London have been scrutinised by the Inland Revenue in recent years. The
first is the deduction for head office charges relating to the UK
branch.

Under the terms of many tax treaties entered into by the UK, a UK
branch can deduct a proportion of head office expenses, but it has to
be able to demonstrate that the proportion is reasonable by reference
to the functions performed at head office for the UK branch.

The second is the deduction for interest payable to other parts of the
bank on funds advanced to the UK branch. The Inland Revenue view is
that an element of this interest should not be deductible, representing
the interest on the capital which the branch would have needed if it
was a subsidiary.

Many banks have argued vigorously against this disallowance but,
unfortunately, a test case has not been taken to clarify the legal
issue.

To settle their tax affairs, many banks have accepted a disallowance of
interest deduction based on a notional capital amount, often equal to
the cost of funding the branch's fixed assets.

The Inland Revenue has been criticised in recent years for the
complexity of its tax legislation. The 1993 legislation on the taxation
of foreign exchange transactions was a case in point, and this has a
big impact on banks due to the international nature of their business.

Particular features of this legislation which will be of interest to
banks are the election for accounts to be prepared in a non-sterling
currency for tax purposes, the deferral provisions for tax on
unrealised exchange gains on long-term capital assets and liabilities
and the transitional rules which take certain balances outside the new
rules for six years.

These new rules have become applicable to many banks from 1 January
1996 and important elections have to be made before 2 April 1996.

The UK banking community has been increasingly complaining that it is
being used as a tax collection agency for the government. This is
partly due to the vigorous approach of the Inland Revenue in recent
years in checking that banks are fully carrying out all their
withholding tax obligations.

Except in restricted circumstances, banks operating in London need to
withhold tax:

* from interest paid to individuals;

* from interest which is not paid in the ordinary course of banking
business;

* from interest on quoted Eurobonds, foreign interest or foreign
dividends collected as agent for UK residents (individuals or
companies);

* from foreign interest or foreign dividends where the bank is a paying
agent; and

* from salary payments.

The main area to which the Inland Revenue has devoted resources in
recent years is in checking the first of these; that banks are
correctly deducting income tax from interest paid to individuals.

Broadly, income tax must be deducted from payments of interest to
individuals unless it is on a qualifying certificate of deposit or a
qualifying time deposit of at least pounds 50,000 or the beneficial
owner of the interest has notified the bank in writing that he is not
usually resident in the UK.

In many cases the Inland Revenue has found the documentation in respect
of not ordinarily resident accounts to be inadequate and large
settlements of tax have had to be paid.

The Inland Revenue is now turning its attention and audit resources to
ensuring that the paying and collecting agent rules, items three and
four in the list above, are being correctly applied by banks.

The current legislation on this is outdated and new legislation will be
included in the 1996 Finance Bill. The indications are that, although
it has been announced as a deregulatory measure, it will more clearly
define the scope of the rules and set out the practicalities of
applying them, rather than greatly restricting the number of
transactions which fall within them.

The position is broadly that a bank must deduct tax from interest on
quoted Eurobonds, foreign interest or dividends where it obtains
payment of these amounts. This is particularly relevant to custodial
and private client business.

The main exception to the rules is where the person entitled to the
proceeds is not resident in the UK, and it is here that Inland Revenue
audits have brought problems in the banks to light.

The documentation supporting gross payment to non-residents has often
been inadequate or out of date. It is likely that the new legislation
will set out more clearly the documents which must be kept to support
gross payment but banks need to be sure that they do not have exposures
under the old rules as well.

Many banks in London employ expatriate staff and the Inland Revenue is
increasingly looking at their salary packages to ensure that the rules
for deduction of tax at source are fully complied with. A common area
for error is payments made in the home country. If these payments are
for work carried out in the UK tax should be deducted at source even if
payment is made outside the UK.

In a competitive environment, where cutting the cost base is paramount,
tax must be given due consideration to ensure that it does not become a
large cost.

VIEWPOINT: SHAPE UP FOR EUROPE

Europe has embarked on a historic endeavour of economic integration,
with the final goal of a political European Union. One important step
is the Maastricht Treaty and European economic and monetary union
(EMU).

No one should be surprised that the debate has become more noisy and
intense as deadlines draw closer. Important issues should be discussed
publicly and open dialogue and fair debate can only help this process.

There are two demands on European economic and monetary union: it
should be a union of stability, and it should not become a transfer
union. Only if these two preconditions are met can members reap the
benefits of a single currency in Europe. Only then will the new
Eurocurrency have a chance to gain broad acceptance.

There is a clear European consensus, formalised in the Maastricht
Treaty, that EMU can only be based on stability. Stability must not
only be created after the union begins, it must be brought into the
union by every country wishing to become a member. To ensure this, the
Maastricht Treaty contains a set of entry criteria in the areas of
inflation, interest and exchange rates as well as fiscal performance.

In our opinion all entry criteria, including the fiscal reference
levels, should be strictly met. Hence, there is a growing likelihood
that we will have to consider a small stability union comprising about
one half of EU members, for example Germany and its neighbours which,
however, account for a substantial share of total EU product.

The UK, with its stability and its economic role in Europe, would be a
natural part of EMU from the beginning. We hope that political
obstacles can be removed by the time the decisions have to be taken in
1998.

Stability from the outset is more important than initial all-inclusive
membership. We think of European integration as an ongoing process.
Each EU member country must be part of this process, but we have never
thought that entry at a later date should carry the outsider's stigma.
As long as the rules are the same for each member country and as long
as they are clear, we are all (the word may be allowed in this context)
insiders.

This has nothing to do with German 'power play' or with monetary union
'on German terms'. The issue is much simpler: the Deutschmark is one of
the world's three key currencies. Stability on world financial markets
is only possible if the issuers of the key currencies - US, Germany,
Japan - ensure responsible monetary policy and low government deficits.
The new European currency will be the successor to the Deutschmark and
must satisfy the same quality standards if the world financial system
is not to suffer.

Hence, each country joining EMU must realise that it is assuming the
rights and duties of a key currency country. The prime requirement in
this respect is financial discipline, not only when joining EMU, but in
the long run as well.

How successfully the European Central Bank can preserve the stability
of money will depend a great deal on the choice of monetary policy
instruments.

Instruments and operating procedures must be efficient and convincing,
in particular in the starting phase, when the European Central Bank
will not have any monetary policy record. It is essential that it can
rapidly prove its ability to contain inflation. This will be decisive
for the financial markets' view that the new currency is a 'high-
quality currency'.

In respect to the mechanics of the monetary changeover, financial
markets need to know which steps of the conversion are regulated by
administrative measures and which are left up to the market itself.

Competition between banks will help advance the process of monetary
union.

The banks will pay close attention to the interests of their customers
and respond to demand for products in the Eurocurrency by making
available an appropriate range. In offering Europroducts, all banks
within the monetary area will compete with each other. The emerging
single EU financial market will no longer be hampered by national
borders. Regulations and market entry barriers are being removed.
Intense competition will compel banks to act and react rapidly.

Deadlines drawing closer have a special meaning for banks since it will
be up to them to actually and practically handle first the transition
and then the new money. As banks, we will have to explain to our
customers that, at least, their economic future will not be jeopardised
by European monetary union and that we will be able to handle all
technical matters competently.

This means preparations have to start now, though there remains
considerable uncertainly about exactly what we must prepare for. In a
wider sense, this is not unusual, because dealing with an uncertain
future is just another expression of risk-taking. This is the banks'
business.

Banks must prepare themselves well and in good time for monetary union.
They must review their place in a monetary area that is caught up in a
process of convergence and explore the strategic options offered by a
large economic area with a single currency. Now that the single
European market has prompted them to reshape their business strategies
for Europe, financial institutions have to work out the implications of
the single currency for their own houses.

First, banks must adjust to a new authority in the field of monetary
policy - the European Central Bank - and to a different set of monetary
policy instruments. The heterogeneous national instruments we have
known are being unified and will be subject to unified handling as
well. Many familiar national monetary policy instruments may now
decline in importance.

Again, banks will have to examine the possible impact on their business
policies, specifically in the areas of liabilities management, currency
trading and securities.

The range of money market products is likely to converge EU-wide. Here,
banks will have to do some thinking, above all about the associated
rise in the costs of refunding as markets become more transparent.

Currency trading in future will centre round three main currencies (the
Eurocurrency, dollar and yen), and this reduction in the number of
currencies and the cessation of currency risks will mean a loss of
business for banks in the areas of money changing, hedging, swap deals
and arbitrage operations.

Monetary union will also have an impact on the securities business,
involving a far-reaching convergence of interest rates in the member
countries. This effect is already leading to portfolio shake-up in the
run-up to monetary union, and that is adding considerably to the
counselling needs of private and corporate customers.

Credit institutions must also adjust to meet technical requirements,
most of all in the areas of organisation and data processing, payments
and accounting. The introduction of a common European currency will
inevitably entail converting all accounts and all balance sheet items
to the new currency unit. Banks' software, too, must be converted - all
the way from their own accounting systems, via customer databases, to
electronic cash and voucher dispensing systems. All systems in the
areas of deposits, credit and securities must be adjusted.

The transition to new bank notes and coins will call for a huge
logistic effort. In payments, too, customers and banks must tackle the
conversion of all systems: from SWIFT and inter-bank payment systems,
automatic bulk transfers and payments, all the way to the electronic
links between banks and their corporate customers.

Banks would be adopting too shortsighted an approach if they only saw
the costs and drawbacks of monetary union. We must not lose sight of
the opportunities and the earnings potential for an agile institution
that is being created.

The best practical example is the US. Americans use one currency in a
country, which is in some ways more heterogeneous than the group of
European countries that will form EMU. No-one in the US would even
think of using more than one currency when travelling from New York to
Miami or to Los Angeles or doing business there.

Demands that transition to monetary union be managed without so-called
'competitive distortions' in the financial sector have entered the
debate with little challenge. Europe is all about competition, and
competition does not become distorted if some are seen as likely to
perform better than others.

The field of competition among banks will be service for customers who
will require products in the new Eurocurrency. Should some banks be
able to offer their new products better, faster and cheaper than their
competitors, then this is the kind of competition which is designed to
make Europe more productive. It is the mainstay of the single market.

Jurgen Sarrazin is chairman of Dresdner Bank, Frankfurt.

INVESTMENT BANKING: A PURSE IN A WALLET

The cashless society may be some years away, but an increasing number
of schemes are trying to bring it closer.

In Europe, one of the most interesting is Mondex, based on a smart card
which is being tested in the UK town of Swindon by two clearing banks,
National Westminster and the Midland Bank. The CSFI recently invited
the project managers to describe its progress and discuss the
implications.

The heart of Mondex is a silicon chip embedded in a plastic card which
can be loaded with electronic cash from the holder's bank account via a
special terminal attached to a conventional telephone. It thus becomes
a 'purse' whose contents can be spent through terminals in shops (or
even transferred to other cards).

The transaction is authorised by the holder's PIN and takes only a few
seconds. Each card has an 'originator', which would have to be an
institution approved by the banking authorities, to bring the card
within the bounds of monetary control.

According to Mondex's promoters, the advantages of the card for the
consumer are its convenience, control and security (cards are
'lockable'), though anyone who loses their card would also lose the
money on it if they were uninsured. It also enables the holder to
withdraw 'cash' from his or her bank account from the comfort of their
home - something that home banking cannot do. For the retailer, the
benefits are better cost management, security, and the possibility for
value-added functions such as customer loyalty schemes.

The Swindon experiment went live in July with 1,000 consumers. There
are now over 8,000. More than 700 retailers, or 70 % of the total, had
signed up, car parks had been added, and buses would join soon. Mondex
payphones have now been installed on most street corners, and
cardholders can obtain cash through them 24 hours a day. This provides
the 'missing link' of home banking. There are now 50 payphones, rising
to 300, plus 1,000 in private homes.

About pounds 500,000 changed hands over Mondex in the first five
months, or some pounds 25,000 a week, which the promoters said was very
satisfactory even though it only amounts to pounds 3 per cardholder a
week.

The aim behind Mondex is to make it practical for everyday
transactions, even buying a bus ticket or a newspaper, which means
driving down the cost of producing it and running the system.

The aim was also to make Mondex 'democratic' - or separate it from
considerations of credit standing. Anyone should be able to have a
Mondex because it need not even be linked to a bank account. You could
buy a fully charged card in a store and give it to someone as a gift.
However, the facility to charge the card from your bank account would
be subject to status, and would cost money, about pounds 1.50 a month.

The sense of the CSFI meeting was that Mondex could bring clear
advantages to the retailer through improved cash management, but it was
less obvious how the consumer would benefit. They would have the cost
and bother of managing their cards, essentially to make transactions
which could more easily be done with cash. Unless it replaced cash
completely, Mondex would become yet another piece of plastic to keep in
an already crowded wallet.

Also, for larger purchases, the consumers would still do better to use
their credit card and enjoy the interest-free credit period, so if
Mondex had a future, it would have to be in the small transaction end
of the market.

Some participants were worried about the potential for money laundering
on Mondex cards. Could they not be used to spirit money out of shady
accounts? The money could not be 'tagged' in the way that numbered
banknotes are.

The scheme also has potentially profound implications for banks if
'originators' can be non-banks. This means that a whole sector of the
cash economy could operate without the help of banks. And there is no
reason why originators should be banks, though Mondex is in close touch
with the Bank of England over how 'originators' should be defined and
authorised.

Mondex's backers intend to run the Swindon experiment for another year
or two before deciding on a national roll-out. NatWest will not say how
many customers it will need to turn Mondex into a profit-making
proposition. What is important, it says, is to see if Mondex works, and
how it can be turned into a money spinner.

INVESTMENT BANKING: CATS THAT GOT THE CREAM

The right people, the right place, the right time - that sums up the
experience of the leading players in international mergers and
acquisitions work based in London in 1995.

It was the year when the big investment in M&A professionals made in
particular by the US investment banks over the last five years paid
dividends - and bonuses.

The boom in cross-border and other international M&A was only part of
the story: the volume of domestic transactions in the US and the UK
also soared.

As a result, fees from M&A received uncharacteristically prominent
mentions in the year-end statements of a number of the investment
banks.

At Lehman Brothers, chairman and chief executive Richard S. Fuld Jr
reported that fourth quarter 'merger and aquisition fees increased 50%'
compared with the same period of 1994. At both Morgan Stanley and JP
Morgan, merger advisory work got more than a passing reference.

Some idea of the scale of the increase in international work can be
gleaned from our tables. In 1994, the top 10 firms in cross-border work
racked up a combined dollars 104 billion worth of deals. In 1995, the
equivalent figure was dollars 215 billion. In both cases the figures
include some double counting, since as many as four or five advisers
may get credit for the same deal. Nevertheless, the trend is sharply
upwards.

For confirmation, look no further than the table of cross-border deals
worth dollars 1 billion or more (see page 18).

In 1994, The Banker tracked 27 such deals (either announced or
completed during the year) worth a combined dollars 52 billion. Last
year there were 39 deals in the same category, worth more than dollars
95 billion.

The big question is: can the boom last? Are there fundamental factors
at work that will continue to drive the world's big corporates into
each others' arms? Is the consolidation ongoing, or has it run its
course? Is the merger boom just a by-product of falling world interest
rates combined with the extended bull run in US and, to a lesser
extent, UK equities? The surge in takeover volumes in 1995 provokes
tempting comparisons with the previous boom at the end of the 1980s.

In the UK, according to figures from stockbrokers James Capel, the
value of deals announced or completed topped the pounds 41 billion mark
last year - or roughly twice the previous record year, 1989.

A similar pattern is apparent in the US, thanks mainly to an explosion
in multi-billion dollar bank mergers last year.

One leading investment banker in London points out that the bare
statistics reflect accidents of timing. 'If you look at UK transactions
last year the numbers are influenced by a couple of very large
transactions. I tend to think of deals happening on a much more
consistent basis. If you plot the activity over the longer term, the
trend is a lot smoother than the data suggests.'

That said, he also confirms that current business levels are way up on
those for the same period a year ago. 'If you look at our existing
backlog of transactions - projects on which terms are either agreed or
where there is a better than 50% chance of success - the total today is
already equivalent to about 60% of what we completed in 1995.' The
normal backlog is between 20% and 30% of a year's business.

One thing is certain. The deals done in 1995 were of a different order
to those done in the last boom.

In the peak year of 1989 the name of the game was leverage. The two big
deals of the year were the dollars 29.6 billion takeover of RJR Nabisco
by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts (KKR) and Sir James Goldsmith's unsuccessful
dollars 21 billion offer for Britain's tobacco giant BAT Industries.

There was unlimited cash available to fund almost any big proposition -
or there was until the banks turned their backs on the proposed buyout
at United Airlines, Washington and the US courts got obstructive, and
the junk bond boom collapsed.

'Compared to the last boom cycle, this one is a lot less financially
motivated and much more strategically driven,' says Ed Annunziato, head
of international M&A at Merrill Lynch (whose cross-border deal volumes
placed the firm just outside the top ten in The Banker's league tables
last year).

'The strategic push is coming as a result of big changes in a handful
of industries. Regulatory change, technological change and cost
pressures associated with one or both - these have been important
drivers in the growth of M&A activity.'

But not the only ones. As important has been the need to squeeze out
the scale economies necessary if a business is to compete globally.

'We saw unprecedented levels of activity last year - almost a feeding
frenzy,' says Jim Downing, managing director and co-head of corporate
finance at Lehman Brothers in London. 'That was partly driven by the
desire to create global positioning on the part of big businesses. But
there was also a defensive quality to it: if your competitor takes out
one of the few remaining targets you can't afford to sit back and
watch.'

Having spent the first half of the 1990s streamlining their operations,
many big corporates are having to live with the prospect of limited
growth, he argues.

The answer is to acquire it. For those acquisitions, 'companies have
been focusing on those sectors where they're choosing to be global
businesses,' says Downing. 'And, in contrast to the 1980s, they're
doing it in a very targeted and surgical way.'

The ready availability of cheap money has played its part, too, he
accepts.

But, again, comparisons with 1989 would be misleading. Having rebuilt
their balance sheets over the course of the 1990s, UK companies, for
instance, are funding deals not from funny money but from internally
generated cash, or from justifiable bank borrowing.

According to the James Capel analysis, two-thirds of the consideration
paid in UK takeovers last year was in the form of cash. Buying other
businesses is a better bet than sticking the cash on deposit.

So long as interest rates remain low by historical standards, activity
on the part of UK companies will remain high, predicts Piers von
Simson, a managing director at SBC Warburg.

'Our projections envisage the generation of very substantial cash
surpluses in corporate UK this year,' he says, 'particularly in what
might broadly be defined as the consumer and service groups.'

Companies such as Tesco, Marks & Spencer and Reuters are generating
huge amounts of cash, he points out. 'The combined Glaxo Wellcome may
be highly geared at present, but the potential cash generation over the
next couple of years tops pounds 2 billion.'

The importance of the UK's contribution to Europe-wide M&A activity
cannot be overstated, says Klaus Diederichs, co-head of M&A for JP
Morgan in Europe. 'Eight out of every 10 big deals had a UK component
last year.

France was in second place, but a long way behind.'

Diederichs sees a number of risks in predicting another record year for
the international M&A business.

'First, if equity markets take a tumble, that will dent confidence.
When confidence goes, deals don't close. Second, there is a danger that
prices get driven too high. Third, there is a limit as to how many more
deals can be done in the most active sectors.

'For instance, a year ago there were 12 independent regional
electricity companies (RECs) in Britain; now there are just five.' For
these reasons, Morgan's team is working on the assumption that total
market volumes in the UK could fall by anything up to 20% in 1996.

CSFB professes itself similarly cautious. Stephen Hester, co-head of
investment banking in London, says 'our internal budgets suggest a 15%
decline in the market as a whole - but that would still leave 1996 the
second most active year in history.'

His concern is that M&A activity tends to peak when the economic cycle
is at or just past its peak. With the cycle turning down across much of
Europe, it is more than possible that M&A activity will turn down with
it.

One thing is certain: the outlook hangs crucially on three key
industries which generated a disproportionate amount of work for M&A
specialists in 1995. They are finance, pharmaceuticals and the world of
telecommunications and media.

No fewer than 23 of our 39 dollars 1 billion-plus deals fit into these
these sectors. 'In terms of those industries,' says Merrill's
Annunziato, 'there is going to be a lot more of the same - though in
pharmaceuticals the restructuring is clearly further advanced than in
the other two sectors. As far as financial institutions and the
telecoms/media sectors are concerned, the restructuring could last
another ten years. Certainly, in US banking, it's not remotely close to
being over.'

The deal lists of the leading investment banks bear testimony to the
frenetic activity in those three sectors over the past year.

In US banking, the size and value of deals expanded sharply,
culminating in the first big hostile takeover bid - Wells Fargo's
dollars 10 billion offer for First Interstate.

There are still 11,000 banks in the US, and plenty of scope for the
deal-makers to be creative. But the process is not confined to the US.

In Europe, for instance, CSFB was involved in 27 banking or insurance-
related deals last year (either completed or pending) and acted for
financial institutions in France, Switzerland, Sweden, Norway, Italy,
Germany, Austria, Spain and the UK. The consolidation of banks in Italy
and Scandinavia is proving a fruitful source of income for several of
the M&A specialists.

So too is the gradual sell-off of Credit Lyonnais' peripheral assets,
some of them banking outposts, others non-bank assets.

Neither of the two investment banks responsible for putting together
the restructuring of some dollars 26 billion worth of CL assets - now
placed into the Consortium de Realisations (CDR) - gets credit in our
league tables for a deal that will take 20 years to complete: Paribas
acted for the French government, Lazard Freres Paris for CL.

But hunting down buyers for the various assets is proving a lucrative
occupation for most of the players in our tables. CSFB sold off Banque
Colbert's regional operations in France to Financiere Meeschaert, its
Paris-based asset management operations to NatWest and its Luxembourg
offshoot to Staal Bankiers, an offshoot of the Dutch Achmea Holding.

Merrill sold CL's Peruvian and Chilean operations (to Banca Commerciale
Italiana and Dresdner respectively) and JP Morgan advised CL Bank
Nederland on its sale to Generale de Banque. Warburg found buyers for
the CL-owned MGM cinema chains in Britain and the Netherlands.

The prospect of more big banking takeovers in the US looks a racing
certainty. But what about Europe?

Morgan Stanley's head of European investment banking operations, John
Studzinski, comments: 'If you look at the UK, there is both
demutualisation and the consolidation of retail services in progress.'
There is also plenty of scope for deals around Europe. 'The conclusion
must be that the process of integration will continue.'

Much the same can be said about the pharmaceuticals industry, where
Morgan Stanley had a hand in the year's two biggest cross-border deals
(acting for Marion Merrell Dow in its takeover by Hoechst of Germany
and for Sweden's Pharmacia in its dollars 13 billion merger with Upjohn
of the US).

It also acted for Chiron of the US in its dollars 2 billion tie-up with
Switzerland's Ciba-Geigy. Says Studzinski: 'There are at least three or
four more consolidations of a similar size to take place in the
industry. The only question is when they will happen.'

In the telecoms and media sectors it was the Lazard houses that put in
the most impressive performance, racking up a string of big deals. The
four it did for MCI Communications Corporation and the one for Seagrams
(the takeover of Hollywood studios group MCA) were alone worth a
combined dollars 10 billion.

Goldman, which acted for the Japanese vendor in the MCA sale, also did
its share of big deals in this area and Reimers is in no doubt there is
more to come.

Lehman's Downing points out the bulk of the media and telecoms deals
have been in the US: 'There is scope for a lot more consolidation in
Europe.' One-off factors were nonetheless apparent in one sector last
year. That was UK utilities, and especially the RECs.

Again Goldman did well, thanks to its acknowledged role as a defence
adviser, picking up four advisory mandates. While there may still be
some unfinished business, there is a finite number of deals to be done.

'There may be more consolidation to come, though lots of companies
appear to be running into domestic monopoly constraints,' says SBC
Warburg's von Simson. The firm acted for America's Southern Electric in
its successful bid for SWEB.

One counterbalancing factor that could sustain UK takeover activity -
particularly in the utility sector - is the threat of a Labour election
victory in a year or so's time.

'If you are an international strategist, the pressure is probably on
you to slip a UK deal in before the election,' says von Simson. 'Under
Labour, the onus is likely to be on the buyer to prove that a deal is a
good thing, rather than on the regulator to show there is nothing
damaging to it.' Be that as it may, M&A specialists expect to see
continental Europe pick up the baton. 'In 1996 you're more likely to
see a restructuring among utilities in Germany, Spain and Italy,'
predicts Morgan Stanley's Studzinski. Merrill's Annunziato agrees.

'German utilities have traditionally been conglomerate-owned. Deals are
likely as part of the refocusing of industry generally.' Or so
investment bankers would like to believe. The trouble is, the long
mooted 'deconglomeratisation' of Germany is proving a patchy affair.

Hoechst and Viag have both shown a willingness to prune peripheral
businesses, but few other German corporates have followed them.

One reason for this is that anti-avoidance provisions in the German tax
statutes could penalise a vendor if 10% or more of a demerged company's
shares subsequently change hands within a short space of time -
something that is highly likely if the demerged company is publicly
floated.

Von Simson argues that this ruling tends to be used as an excuse for
inaction by German industrialists.

'European Union members have all signed up to the concept of tax-free
demergers. I suspect that, if enough pressure were applied, the
legislation might be clarified or the tax authorities might give a
ruling that the anti-avoidance provisions did not apply.

'Pressure from the international investment community will translate
into action sooner or later. There will be disposals that have the
effect of deconglomeratising German industry - though perhaps not a
direct demerger along the lines of ICI/Zeneca.'

CSFB's Hester agrees. It is all part of what he sees as a long-term
trend: the 'Anglo-Saxonisation of continental Europe'. The impact of
new takeover codes, the harmonisation of accounting standards, the
appearance of international investors on local share registers - all of
this is helping to cement a change of attitude. The upturn in European
M&A activity last year looks no fluke.

But it will still take an enormous acceleration in the process to
compensate for a slowdown in UK merger activity - were that to happen
this year.

Morgan's Diederichs points to the fact that the value of French and
German deals combined last year was no more than a quarter of the total
recorded in the UK. 'If the pace of activity in the UK falters,
continental Europe cannot take up the slack,' he argues.

The caveat is well taken; and few of the main players in this game are
prepared to look beyond the next three months. But, right now, they
simply cannot believe their luck.

INVESTMENT BANKING: DIG DEEP FOR DEBT

In January, in what looked like a last act of desperation, Eurotunnel,
the crisis-stricken operator of the Channel tunnel, called on the UK
and French governments to guarantee a substantial bond issue to help
refinance its pounds 7.8 billion (dollars 11.8 billion) debt. The plan
proposed that the bond issue would involve a 'zero coupon' structure in
which there would be low or no interest payments for about 10 years.

But, far from being a miracle cure for the Chunnel operator's financial
difficulties, a closer look at the proposal showed it would merely
delay the pain and add to the company's bulging interest bill. Both the
French and the UK governments swiftly ruled out the plan.

The move follows Eurotunnel's announcement in September that it had
suspended interest payments on its debt mountain and was starting
negotiations with its banks to rearrange its finances. Eurotunnel's
four agent banks - National Westminster, Midland Bank, Banque Nationale
de Paris and Credit Lyonnais - were to report to the rest of the
banking syndicate, comprising 225 members, mainly UK, French and
Japanese banks, by 17 March.

Until then, both sides were bound by a pact of secrecy from commenting
publicly on the negotiations.

Traders and brokers in the UK and European corporate debt market will
have been watching keenly. Promising a record-breaking restructuring,
Eurotunnel's plight could provide a feast for the UK distressed debt
market.

The crisis comes when the UK market is facing a famine in the supply of
new names to trade, as the recovery of the UK economy continues. Many
UK companies which have been big debt trading situations are having
their difficulties resolved or recovering, for example, GPA and
Cordiant (Saatchi and Saatchi), while prospects for resolution for
others in the coming year are brightening, for example, Signet and
Somerfield.

While traders have been talking for some time about the possibilities,
and hindrances, for a market to develop in continental European
countries, the dwindling supply in the UK, barring Eurotunnel, may give
extra impetus to their efforts there and in trading of UK near-par,
good quality loans. Some are looking further afield, to the Far East
and Latin America.

But while Eurotunnel debt and derivatives of debt could prove to be a
bonanza for the corporate debt trading market, some traders admit to a
worry that the market could be swamped by big pieces of debt looking
for a home, which would depress the price. Few banks are willing to
sell at the mid-January price of around 37 pence in the pound, but an
upward move in the price is likely to provoke more trading.

Tony Tucker, senior director of Bank of America in London, argues that
Eurotunnel is big enough and diverse enough that the 'primary
principles of demand and sources of supply could work,' bringing about
an equilibrium in supply and demand.

Despite the uncertain outlook for the UK market, in 1995 volumes in UK
and European distressed and impaired loans appear to have continued to
increase, but estimates vary widely.

Bank of America estimates dollars 10 billion for 1995, up from about
dollars 6.5 billion in 1994. Of this dollars 10 billion, Tucker
explains that debt sales by original lenders in regularly quoted names
such as GPA account for about one third; other original sales account
for about another one third; while retrades among participants account
for the remaining third.

Other estimates are more modest. Don Pollard and David Newport, vice-
presidents of Citibank, estimate around dollars 8 billion was traded in
1995, including retrades.

Richard Brennan, director of international loan sales and trading at
Merrill Lynch, estimates only about dollars 2 billion of original debt
was traded in 1995, and says the original debt can trade as much as 10
to 15 times.

The increased volume reflects the greater number of traders and
investors in the market. There are now at least 10-12 serious
participants which have each committed capital of around dollars 100-
250 million and people to the market, points out Tucker. These have
brought more liquidity and competition to the market, and spreads in
the more liquid names have narrowed.

Besides these new players, two inter-dealer brokers have also entered
in the last year to 18 months, Patriot Securities in New York and
Canter Fitzgerald, which only deal with dealers, enabling them to
retain their anonymity until the deal is done. Pollard and Newport
observe that longer term local investors, mostly foreign banks in the
UK, have moved into the UK market, such as Standard Bank, Banco
Santander, West Merchant Bank and ING Bank, as well as some of the UK
clearing banks.

They have seen a flow from the US 'vulture' type high-yield investors,
to these local investors, which are looking for less risky plays and
are willing to make more moderate returns. This trend has provided US-
based investors with buyers for debt bought earlier in the
restructuring cycle.

'We probably do about half of our trades into local buyers, whereas the
year before we probably did about 80% of our trades back into US
buyers,' says Pollard.

In 1995, Brennan of Merrill Lynch noticed a growing acceptance of the
market as a viable way of managing the risk contained in a bank's
portfolio of assets by a number of UK clearing banks, which have become
actively involved both on the buy and sell side. Tucker adds that
portfolio analysis is exerting a growing influence on banks' management
of loans.

A notable exception is Barclays Bank, which has not bought or sold any
of its impaired debt. Terry Bond, lending services director, explains
that the bank has been a strong supporter of the Bank of England's
informal philosophy on financial workouts, the London Approach, which
aims to create and maintain stability during a workout. Barclays has
been anxious to continue to give a lead in stability, says Bond.

On the effect of debt trading on a standstill and financial
reconstruction, he says: 'We still have a sense of nervousness'. The
bank would also like to see how the market develops before it positions
itself as a player.

However, given the right circumstances, it might in the future consider
debt trading as an option. 'We have seen the emergence of a large
number of responsible players in the market. There isn't necessarily a
free for all which some people feared might happen; and if you have a
responsible market then it's something that you can actually learn to
live with,' Bond comments.

A fertile source of original distressed debt has been the debt-ridden
Japanese banks, which have been coming into the market more in 1995,
driven by a need and desire politically and commercially to clean up
their balance sheets, says Tucker. Pressure from the Ministry of
Finance (MoF) and the Bank of Japan (central bank) for more realism on
their balance sheets, along with the Daiwa scandal and the admission
that some of the housing loan subsidiaries were under water, is forcing
the Japanese banks to look to write off as much of their bad debts as
possible at their fiscal year end in March 1996.

Many of the Japanese banks have sold out of GPA, Signet, Somerfield and
Isosceles, says Tucker, but not yet out of Eurotunnel. Leading Japanese
banks, which have almost dollars 2 billion in outstanding loans to
Eurotunnel, were reported in January to have said that they had no
plans for an early disposal of them.

It is estimated that the Japanese banks have sold more than half of
their European distressed debt, excluding Eurotunnel, over the past
three years.

In October, a series of damaging revelations, including the Daiwa
scandal, led to a premium being put on lending to Japanese banks, which
increased their cost of capital and was the catalyst for some of them
to sell thinner-priced, near par loans.

Traders have had mixed success at tackling the potential of continental
Europe. Bank of America sees France as a growing area: it opened an
adjunct office in France in 1995 and has traded the debt of all but one
of the French companies named in its price list.

These include: Air France Partners Leasing; Aluminium Dunkerque, the
aluminium smelting company partly owned by Pechiney; Groupe Bull, the
partially privatised computer company; and Orlyval, the tunnel between
Orly and Paris. There are plenty of obstacles to trading in French
loans, however, particularly when real estate or secured mortgage or
security of assets are involved, which are difficult and expensive to
transfer under French law. Bank of America has traded a Spanish credit,
but has not done any trading in German company debt.

Large syndicate deals such as Aluminium Dunkerque are unusual on the
Continent; 'club deals', involving a smaller number of banks than in a
syndication, are more common in continental Europe than in the UK.
There are also many bilateral deals, where a company has a separate
contract with each bank, for example, in Germany, which accounts for
the difficulty of trading there, says Tucker.

Pollard and Newport of Citibank observe that the UK and European market
has followed their expectations in all respects except one: trading has
been slower to take off in Europe than they envisaged. 'The market has
not performed as expected with respect to geographic diversity,' they
comment.

While France seems to be the next area, they admit that they have not
seen the holders of French loans prepared to accept what they think is
fair price. Of Germany, Pollard comments: 'The German banks seem to be
reluctant to let the loans go'.

Traders have also been eyeing with a certain relish recent banking
debacles for debt trading opportunities, such as Credit Lyonnais, Daiwa
Bank and Banco di Napoli of Italy, which are under pressure to reduce
their size.

But, so far, the few deals done have been to other members of the
lending syndicates in these names, rather than through intermediaries,
because of a reluctance to sell loans at less than par. Tucker of Bank
America admits: 'There is a frustration because we have put a huge
amount of effort into it.' The hope is that new management or stronger
directives from government will force these banks to take the hit and
to sell the loans at a discount.

Looking ahead to 1996, Tucker expects distressed volumes to flatten out
next year, while Pollard and Newport expect the volumes to be flat or
even down.

Besides Eurotunnel, a rare potential new big name at the start of 1996
was Trafalgar House, the troubled property company, but the jury was
still out on whether it would go into a restructuring.

Brennan of Merrill Lynch still sees plenty of opportunities, for
example, in convertibles and pure bonds: 'It may not be bank debt; it
may be other portions of the capital structure that will be traded.'
Pollard and Newport are planning to spend more of their time this year
trying to buy into situations on the Continent and are also hopeful
that the near-par market will continue to develop.

Some traders, undaunted by limited opportunities closer to home, are
looking even further afield to the Far East and Latin America. Bank of
America, for example, has been looking around Hongkong and Singapore.
In these countries bank debt is still quite healthy at the moment,
because yields are high and maturities are short, but Tucker believes
that sooner or later there is bound to be an oversupply.

He also sees potential in Thai, Korean and Indonesian debt. At the
moment he thinks Asian convertibles are interesting. He predicts that
'South East Asia could be half again the size of the UK and European
market in the next three to five years.'

For the more fearless, China is also potentially an enormous, but
complicated, market. In Latin America, Mexico holds potential because
of the numbers of defaults, but again is only for the more aggressive
brokers and traders with a high risk to return profile. It promises to
be a challenging ride for traders and investors.

INVESTMENT BANKING: GO FOR THE GILT

Two recent developments in the London financial markets have increased
investor awareness of money market funds as a viable alternative for
the management of short-term cash reserves.

The collapse of Barings almost one year ago sparked a debate among
financial institutions concerned about the safety of their overnight
cash balances.

Asset managers, pension fund administrators, corporate directors and
other fiduciaries have begun to question traditional deposit
arrangements which potentially expose their cash to a significant level
of credit risk.

The second development supporting increased interest in money market
funds is the introduction at the beginning of this year of an open
market in gilt (UK government securities)repos.

The emergence of a broad-based gilt repo market will provide money fund
managers with a fully collateralised instrument which will greatly
enhance their ability to meet investor liquidity needs.

A money market fund is essentially a stand-alone investment vehicle
operated much like other collective investment schemes. The fund is
invested in a diversified portfolio of high-grade short-term
instruments with the objective of protecting the principal value of
investor capital while providing liquidity and a reasonable level of
current income.

Money market funds are typically subject to regulatory controls
designed to protect principal value, including minimum quality
thresholds for investment, minimum diversification requirements and
maximum maturity levels both for instruments held by a fund and for the
fund's portfolio as a whole.

There are important differences between money market funds and
traditional bank deposits. A money market fund's assets are invested
solely for the benefit of its investors. Management is provided by an
outside investment adviser which is paid a fee for this service but the
fund receives the full benefit of the income earned net of this fee.

Banks, by comparison, are in the business of re-investing their
customers' deposits. A bank may charge a fee for specific cash
management services but this fee is in addition to the favourable
spread which the bank earns on the deposits themselves.

A second difference between a money market fund and a bank deposit is
that the fund is structured to separate completely asset management
from asset custody. Unlike a bank which accepts deposits from its
customers, the manager of a money market fund does not itself receive
or hold investor funds. All of the fund's assets are separately held in
a segregated account at a custodian bank where they are 'ring-fenced'
against claims of the bank's creditors.

The manager's job is to direct the day-to-day investment of these
assets in accordance with the investment objectives and policies set
forth in the fund's prospectus furnished to investors.

The most important distinction between money market funds and bank
deposits is that investors in a money fund receive the benefits of an
actively managed portfolio.

A bank deposit requires the commitment of investor monies for a set
period of time in order to earn a quoted rate of return. By contrast, a
money market fund pools investor subscriptions and actively manages the
pool to provide both daily liquidity and a market rate of return. An
actively managed portfolio is continuously invested in a variety of
high-grade short-term instruments selected by the manager to achieve
the fund's objectives. Through active management a money market fund in
effect 'securitises' its investors' cash.

In the US money market funds have achieved broad acceptance as a
valuable cash management tool for both institutional and individual
investors. Total net assets of money funds are now more than dollars
750 billion, with annual sales in excess of dollars 2 trillion.
Approximately 48% of money market fund assets are held for benefit of
institutions such as retirement plans, corporations, foundations and
charities, and a variety of fiduciary accounts.

In the US banks are major investors in money market funds and often
serve, through non-bank affiliates, as sponsors and advisers to funds.
Money market funds have also become accepted cash management vehicles
in other countries, notably France, where money market fund assets now
total in excess of dollars 250 billion, and Germany, where money funds
were first permitted in 1994 and have already attracted considerable
interest.

A money market fund industry has not developed in the UK quite simply
because, until now, there has been no need for one.

The establishment and growth of money funds in the US was in direct
response to a series of developments within the banking community in
the 1970s and early 1980s when regulatory limits on the level of
interest that could be paid by banks prevented them from giving
depositors market rates of return.

This period also witnessed the failure of a number of prominent banking
and savings institutions. Money market funds were created in response
to investor demand for a safe alternative that could provide
competitive returns.

Recent developments in the UK financial markets, though perhaps not as
dramatic as the events giving rise to the US money fund industry, are
nevertheless significant and could fuel a demand for money market funds
in the UK. The increased acceptance of such funds in major European
markets should also stimulate the use of money market funds by UK
institutions.

The collapse of Barings needs to be placed in context. It is important
to emphasise that Barings did nothing fundamentally wrong in the way it
handled its investors' overnight cash. Barings' decision to place
approximately pounds 500 million of such cash on deposit with its
affiliate bank conformed to the cash management practices of other
asset managers.

The problem was more systemic. Unlike securities held for its
customers, which were properly 'ring-fenced', overnight cash deposited
with the bank was reflected on its balance sheet as an unsecured asset
subject to the claims of creditors. When Barings failed it was only by
virtue of the ING acquisition that investors avoided a total loss of
their overnight cash then on deposit with the bank.

In the wake of Barings' collapse market participants have searched for
alternative solutions. As a 'stopgap' remedy UK asset managers and
other fiduciaries early last year began diversifying their deposits by
taking cash balances away from single institutions with which they
enjoyed an affiliation or other longstanding relationship and by
spreading those assets among a number of high quality banks.

Diversification clearly reduces the extent of exposure but it does not
address the core credit risk issues. There is also the problem of
locating a sufficient number of high-grade institutions to ensure an
adequate level of diversification.

Money market funds take a different approach to diversification and in
the process substantially reduce credit risk exposure. By investing
assets in a range of money market securities such as repos and
commercial paper, investor cash is 'securitised' and thereby
effectively protected against any potential creditor claims that might
otherwise be asserted.

Within a money fund credit risk is addressed as an investment matter
through proper portfolio diversification and compliance with minimum
quality guidelines. By carefully managing its portfolio maturities a
money market fund provides its investors with both overnight cash
liquidity and a market rate of return. In this way the fund serves as
an effective substitute for traditional bank deposit arrangements
without exposing investors to any significant degree of credit risk.

To work effectively money market funds must have access to a range of
investment vehicles that will enable them to achieve their safety,
liquidity and yield objectives. A key issue for a money market fund is
the ability to obtain overnight liquidity for a significant portion of
its assets in order to meet redemption requests of its investors.

In the US, as well as in France and Germany, liquidity has been
provided to market participants through a broad-based and highly liquid
'repo' market. A repo, or repurchase agreement, involves the short-term
(including overnight) sale of securities to a cash provider such as a
money market fund, coupled with a commitment to repurchase the
securities at an agreed-upon time and price, thereby determining the
yield during the purchaser's holding period.

Repos constitute among the lowest risk means of improving short-term
yields as the lender or buyer of repo can take advantage of both the
credit worthiness of its counterparties (the sellers of repo) and the
availability of high quality 'collateral,' which are the repo-ed
securities. In the US more than dollars 1trillion of repos is traded
each day. In the European repo markets, centred in London, annual net
purchases of repos had increased to a level of over dollars 7.3 billion
by the end of 1994.

From 2 January of this year there are no longer any official
restrictions on anyone repoing or lending and borrowing gilts, either
directly or indirectly through intermediaries. The removal of these
restrictions means that investors may now freely use gilt repo to
invest their cash balances.

As of mid-January, open market trading in gilt repos had not yet
resulted in a fully liquid repo market as participants and their
advisers were still working to resolve some lingering systems and
documentation issues. Yet it is probably safe to say at this early date
that there is widespread interest in the development of the repo market
as a short-term investment alternative.

If money market funds are to achieve the safe and liquid goals of their
shareholders it will be essential that a broad-based gilt repo market
becomes established. In advance of this development the alternatives
for money fund portfolios are to hold time deposits of a number of
highly rated banks, to invest in commercial paper of high-grade
corporate issuers and to engage in other strategies such as short-term
fully hedged swaps into liquid instruments denominated in other
currencies.

Thus far only a handful of sterling denominated money market funds have
been launched, and these have endeavoured to preserve maximum
flexibility in their investment programmes. Most have not been able to
assure investors of absolute liquidity, or 'same day' settlement on
redemption of their fund shares. The advent of gilt repo, therefore, is
an important step in the future development of actively managed money
market funds designed for UK institutional investors.

INVESTMENT BANKING: MOVE OVER

International bankers remain concerned about competition from the World
Bank's government-funded private sector finance arm, the International
Finance Corporation (IFC), for business which they consider could be
handled by private sector banks.

A report(1) last month from the Institute of International Finance
(IIF), the Washington-based group representing nearly 200 private
financial institutions from around the world, acknowledges that IFC has
taken on board the criticisms. But it argues that it should go further.

Last year IFC issued new guidelines on Collaboration with Private
International Financial Institutions. This is welcomed by IIF, which
emphasises the continuing 'strong interest of most private banks in
working in partnership with IFC'.

Nonetheless, IIF stresses the substantial change in the emerging
economies which, previously dependent on official financing, now
increasingly have access to commercial sources.

'Most of the private flows are .. concentrated in the more advanced
developing countries. These are the same countries where IFC is doing
most of its business. As a consequence, the potential for IFC
activities to displace services provided by private banks has increased
measurably.' Among nine recommendations for further action by IFC, the
report argues: 'IFC should adopt an active and transparent graduation
policy as part of a basic reorientation away from countries that have
access to international capital markets toward those that do not.
Generally, there should be a presumption that IFC will not support
transactions in countries designated as having substantial access to
international capital markets, especially transactions involving large,
well-known companies.' On underwriting; 'IFC should continue to limit
its underwriting of international securities to exceptional cases where
it is clear that the transaction cannot be completed without IFC's
presence.'

Pointing out that IFC has adopted a policy of not competing for
privatisation mandates awarded through bidding procedures, it argues
that a further step should be taken to 'adopt a policy of not competing
for any advisory mandates awarded through a bidding procedure.'

ITALY: LOSERS NOT CHOOSERS

When Banco di Napoli declared a 1995 half-year loss of L1,561 billion
(about dollars 1 billion) last autumn, it confirmed its capacity for
exploring the financial outer reaches. It had shocked markets earlier
in the year by declaring a loss of almost L1,000 billion for 1994, then
revised upwards to L1,147 billion.

Yet Banco di Napoli's awful performance should not have been a
surprise.

Other large southern banks had extended loss-making frontiers over
recent years, and Banco di Napoli operates in the same difficult
environment of the mezzogiorno's almost comatose economy and the
tenacious grip of politicial interference for which the south is
notorious.

The truth about the dismal quality of its loanbook could not be hidden
forever.

On its beam ends, the Neapolitan bank started 1996 in search of rescue.
It was thrown a line at the end of November, when the treasury ministry
and a group of banks agreed a L2,500 billion loan at market rates, a
move suggesting that the bank was suffering an awkward liquidity
shortage.

The loan only allows temporary respite, however, when what is needed is
radical restructuring both of its capital base and operations.

Indeed, a drastic re-shaping has been sought by Federico Pepe since his
appointment to the chief executive's hot seat last summer.

Heavy cuts are needed in the branch network, both to reduce losses and
slim assets. But this will not be enough, and a massive injection of
fresh capital, upwards of L3,000 billion, is also needed to put ratios
in order.

Though believed to enjoy central bank support, Pepe's plans have not
been taken on board by all fellow directors, some of whom have
vigorously opposed disposal of branches.

There is opposition also to dilution of the equity owned by the bank's
foundation. Seemingly unaware of the adage that losers cannot be
choosers, Neapolitan politicians want to continue controlling the bank
and calling the shots, and imagine that there are gullible white
knights ready to put their cash into a southern Italian bank that has
given no satisfaction to investors.

Banco di Napoli's shares were traded at L658 on 15 January, against a
1995/1996 high of L1,480.

A big headache for the supervisory authorities, as well as its
shareholders, Banco di Napoli is far from being the only problem in
Italian banking, however.

Associazione Bancaria Italiana (ABI, the Italian banking association)
published a review of the 1995 half-year results of a sample of 91
commercial banks, including all the major institutions, at the end of
last year.

The overall picture was gloomy. Although there was a slight increase in
interest margin for banks with nationwide operations, from 1.09% of
total assets in the first half of 1994 to 1.12% in the January to June
period last year, this is considered to have resulted from transitory
improvements in conditions.

Reviewing 1995's first-half results, Stefano Preda, professor of
economics at Milan's Bocconi University, noted that, faced by
difficulties in maintaining interest margins, many banks have tried to
boost earnings from services.

'Diversification is the typical strategic response to crisis in core
business. However, results do not at the moment seem comforting.' Preda
noted that Italy's banks have until now diversifed into sectors that
are similar to banking, mature and offering low margins and high risks.
He pointed to asset management where commissions of only L250 billion
were earned on more than L115,000 billion under management.

Preda considered that while Italy's banks must improve revenues, they
must also cut costs further. At more than L110 million, the average
annual cost per employee is far higher than in other sectors. The ratio
of operating costs to deposits and loans has been declining since 1991,
but this is not enough.

Fragmentation of the banking system prevents economies of scale.

'Concentration is the right path, and is obligatory in many cases where
size is insufficiently competitive,' said Preda.

ABI's figures show that while there was a general improvement in gross
operating results, and improvements in net profit for regional and
provincial banks, the large national banks' aggregate bottom line was
written in deep red.

Thanks to increased provisions and lower extraordinary gains, Italy's
large national banks showed an aggregate post-tax loss of L866 billion
in the first half of last year, compared with a profit of L445 billion
in the same period of 1994. Clearly Banco di Napoli's awesome losses
were influential, but other big banks hardly shone.

Even after booking L44 billion extraordinary gains, Credito Italiano
could report a post-tax end-of-June profit of only L91 billion (less
than dollars 60 million).

And while Istituto Bancario San Paolo di Torino showed a bottom line
surplus of L214 billion, it fell short of past achievements and what
might be expected of Italy's biggest bank.

Troubled Monte dei Paschi di Siena (MPS), whose former general manager
Vincenzo Pennarola is appealing through legal channels against his
dismissal in November, is another of Italy's faded banking glories.

It was able to report a half-year net profit of L77 billion (on total
assets of L100,174 billion) only thanks to booking L152 billion of
extraordinary gains.

And Milan's Cariplo, apparently still hopeful about making an initial
public offering of its shares, returned a half-year profit of L135
billion (on total assets of L131,271 billion) that is unlikely to
encourage queues of eager prospective shareholders.

There are no signs of joy at Banca di Roma either. Formed from the
merger of three unsparkling institutions (Banco di Roma, Banco di Santo
Spirito and Cassa di Risparmio di Roma) in the late 1980s and early
1990s, the bank has yet to shine.

Half-year profit of the bank (total assets of L153,665 billion) was a
meagre L53 billion. Moreove, the recent acquisitions of Banca
Mediterranea (L2 billion profit at 30 June) and Banca Nazionale
dell'Agricoltura (L17 billion loss) have done nothing to strengthen the
Rome bank.

Notwithstanding disappointing results and dodgy loan books, Italy's big
banks nevertheless seem to seek problems.

Perhaps it is because most (Cariplo, MPS, San Paolo, Banca di Roma and
the large southerners Banco di Napoli and Banco di Sicilia) still
belong firmly in the public sector.

That may also explain the apparent enthusiasm with which IMI (the
investment bank and financial services conglomerate), its three
controlling shareholders (Cariplo, San Paolo and MPS) and Banca di Roma
bought into the equity of the Mediaset television company owned by
former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi , in spite of enormous and
evident conflicts of interest.

At least Banco di Napoli was not among the banks which put up L400
billion to take a 6% stake in Mediaset at the end of December, though
its name does appear among the shareholders of Italy's TAV high speed
train project.

But that investment was made when the bank was reporting profits.
Survival is now the issue, rather than the collection of political
points that still seems to preoccupy many banks.

Professor Preda sees a trend that presents ample risks and a difficult
future if decisive structural intervention is not undertaken both in
individual banks and the system overall. Indeed, some bankers refer to
a crisis situation.

As Italian banking enters 1996, many questions remain unanswered, not
least, which of its members might go the way of Banco di Napoli.

FRANCE: PROFIT - OR LOSS

As expected, Paribas chief executive Andre Levy-Lang was officially
ified last December that he is under investigation by a French
magistrate looking into a case of falsified accounts at a Paribas
subsidiary, Ciments Francais.

This procedure, on which Paribas refuses to comment, allows the
magistrate to interrogate Levy-Lang. The magistrate is obviously trying
to determine if Paribas and its chief executive knew about the
falsified accounts, something that Paribas, which has instituted a
civil action in the case, has always denied.

Given the circumstances of the case it would seem highly unlikely that
Paribas was aware of the problem at Ciments Francais.

Perhaps the bigger question raised by the case is the degree to which a
holding company, like Paribas, can control its subsidiaries. And
whether a French holding company can control a French subsidiary - even
with five representatives on the board of directors of the subsidiary -
given the passive nature of boards in France vis a vis the executive
chairman. Ciments Francais' executive chairman, Pierre Conso, was a
respected member of the business community.

The case dates back to 1991 when one of Paribas' major shareholders,
the AXA insurance group, decided to get rid of its shares in Ciments
Francais, a cement group. After a bid Paribas ended up with 86% of the
group headed by Pierre Conso. Ciments Francais reported profits of
FF401 million (dollars 77.4 million) for 1991, a year when Paribas
posted a loss of FF200 million, the first in its history.

In April 1992, after trying unsuccessfully to fit the new activities in
with another industrial group, Paribas announced it was selling a
controlling shareholding of 54.7% of Ciments Francais to Italcementi,
part of the Pesenti family group, one of the most important family-held
groups in Italy.

The FF6.6 billion deal, arranged for the Pesenti by Mediobanca, made
Italcementi the largest cement company in Europe and the second largest
in the world.

In July 1992 Ciments Francais raised FF500 million in equity on the
market, guaranteed by Mediobanca and Paribas, both of which reportedly
ended up stuck with the paper.

At first this looked like hard luck but in the light of following
events was perhaps a stroke of good fortune since no big international
investors became mired in the deal.

In October 1992 an audit of Ciments Francais commissioned by
Italcementi uncovered FF2.7 billion in off balance-sheet activities
that had gone unreported in its official balance sheet and which
accounted for FF655 million of the FF740 million in losses for the
first semester of 1992. Conso was fired and later arrested.

Mediobanca, which has a small shareholding in Paribas, was infuriated.

Paribas deducted FF500 million from the purchase price and later took
off another FF325 million. It also took over some of the off balance-
sheet activities of Ciments Francais.

The FF800 million capital gain originally announced turned into a loss
for Paribas. A report ordered by the investigating magistrate concluded
that in 1991 Ciments Francais should have posted a FF120 million loss
instead of a profit.

One of the ironies in the story is that Giampiero Pesenti, head of
Italcementi, is also chairman of Gemina, the investment and financial
services group of Fiat, in which the Pesenti group as well as
Mediobanca also have shares.

The recent Mediobanca-concocted plan to merge the activities of Gemina
with the financial and industrial activities of the Ferruzzi group to
create a super-Gemina foundered, due to surprise losses at a Gemina
subsidiary, Rizzoli. This would have created the second largest group
in Italy after Fiat.

Now Gemina executives are under investigation for falsified accounts
and false corporate reporting. Paribas was to have taken a 5% stake in
the super-Gemina deal.

AUSTRIA: POST-UNION BLUES

Austria has a headache, or several. Sobered up after the excitement
which accompanied the overwhelming vote in the 1994 referendum in
favour of joining the European Union, the country is now coming to
terms with the implications of membership, a year after joining.

After the second election in just over a year, the once stable
political structure is in disarray.

The government still badly needs to tackle the budget deficit, the
issue which caused last year's breakdown of the ruling left/right
coalition.

The point has been made more urgent by commitment to meeting the
Maastricht criteria for membership of economic and monetary union
(EMU).

Rather than being marginalised as just a small country on the eastern
fringes of the EU, Austria aims to be a senior player in the big
league, while at the same time retaining a role as a gateway to the
emerging economies of central and eastern Europe. That objective is in
doubt.

A slowdown in economic growth is not helping. Nor is it providing a
promising background for the banks, already suffering in their home
market from slow loan growth and pressure on margins in a seriously
overbanked country.

Meanwhile, the political shenanigans have yet again put into abeyance
plans for privatisation of the government's stakes in the two biggest
banks. First in line is Creditanstalt, where the voting majority has
been up for grabs for nearly five years now; but the biggest, Bank
Austria, could also be affected.

That is one of the problems facing the new finance minister. Viktor
Klima, a Social Democrat (red) and former minister of transport, was
appointed by chancellor Franz Vranitzky (red) after Andreas Staribacher
resigned.

The move was widely welcomed in the banking sector as clearing the way
for another attempt at the planned privatisations and, possibly, for
sorting out the problems with the budget.

Staribacher, a tax consultant, had been brought in last April to
replace longserving (red) finance minister Ferdinand Lacina, who
stepped down after problems in negotiating the 1995 budget. (Last month
Lacina was named to succeed Herbert Lugmayr, who is retiring, as
chariman of GiroCredit, central clearing organisation for the savings
banks.)

Now the new finance minister faces the same problems as his
predecessors in 1996; the junior coalition partner, the People's Party
(black), has been pushing for cuts in the generous spending on social
security rather than tax increases.

The election in December had been brought on by the collapse of the
coalition over the budget argument after the People's Party's new
leader, Wolfgang Schussel, took a chance on improving the party's
representation in Parliament.

His gamble failed; the reds increased their seats from 65 to 72, the
blacks edged up from 52 to 53. The far right Freedom Party headed by
the populist Jorg Haider, which had previously been gaining ground and
challenging the established political set-up, stood still with 41 seats
against 42.

That leaves the government where it started. At the time of writing,
talks were still going on to renew the coalition.

Whatever agreement is reached between the parties, they have to tackle
the budget issue. The deficit was expected to reach 5.3% of gross
domestic product (GDP) last year. It needs to be cut to 3% to meet the
Maastricht convergence criteria. Until a budget is agreed for this year
predictions further ahead are shaky.

Some contribution is expected from the proceeds of privatisation of
extensive state holdings in industrial and commercial companies -
including the banks. But the fundamentals, which caused the previous
split, need to be sorted out.

Getting the deficit under control is not being helped by the economic
slowdown. The latest forecasts from GiroCredit indicate that GDP
growth, which hit 3.0% in 1994, slipped to 2.0% last year and could
fall to 1.7% this year.

The bank results have reflected the slowdown in the economy.
Preliminary indications for the full year from the biggest banks show
that, while business at home was quiet, international activities helped
to produce reasonably good results.

Bank Austria reported in late December that operating results for 1995
should be up by 16.8% at about S4.9 billion (dollars 485 million). The
bank has been working on cutting costs: 'The domestic branch network
was further streamlined through the closure or merger of branches.

'The number of branches and business units fell from 320 to 306, and
the bank plans to merge 20 more branches in 1996.'

In the home market: 'Demand for personal loans remains depressed due to
slow growth in disposable income, but is stronger than in 1994.
Business loans experienced growth, especially those granted to small
and medium-sized companies.'

Outside Austria 'international business has surpassed expectations. In
1995, the performance of all the bank's foreign offices was either good
or outstanding based on a comparison of the results posted for 1994'.

Bank Austria has been working to take advantage of the fact that it is
now under the same holding company which holds a majority of GiroCredit
(which is however fighting to avoid losing its its separate identity).

The asset management activities of the two banks have been merged. And
'agreement was reached with GiroCredit to direct external public
accountants to examine the possibilities for merging some of the
foreign offices of Bank Austria and GiroCredit'.

The bank has also been developing its external links. Cariplo of Italy
has agreed to increase its holding from 4.3% to 5.6% this year.

And last year Bank Austria formed a strategic link with Germany's
Westdeutsche Landesbank.

'The co-operation agreement .. foresees a participation of WestLB in
Bank Austria in the order of about 9.1% in Bank Austria's share capital
through a capital increase. The two banks moreover mutually declare
themselves to be preferred partners for cross-border financial
transactions.'

Creditanstalt has been particularly helped by foreign business.
Chairman Guido Schmidt-Chiari reported a rise of 16% in the CA Group's
after-tax surplus to about S2.2 billion.

'One dominant characteristic of the 1995 business year was the
favourable earnings situation in international business. While
accounting for some 50% of the consolidated balance sheet, foreign
business generated about two-thirds of the group's surplus for the
year.'

In contrast: 'Domestic business was under heavy pressure in 1995.

'The reasons for this development are to be seen in the extremely weak
credit demand during much of the year, the shift to short-term loans
with low interest rates and a general squeeze on the interest margin.'

GiroCredit, which as well as being the central institution for the
savings banks is a commercial bank in its own right, had a good year
with operating profit up 56% at S1.53 billion. The year was eventful,
including a reorganisation of risk management, restructuring the equity
investment portfolio and 'going public'.

To achieve this, the bank converted the whole of its outstanding
participating capital, with a nominal value of S300 million, into
preference shares which were offered to the public. 'Despite the
unfavourable market climate at the time, the issue was oversubscribed.
The preference stock is widely held, having been placed with private
and institutional investors in Austria and abroad.'

The problems of the banks were highlighted by rating agency Moody's in
its December 1995 review. The agency pointed to five challenges:

* Widespread overcapacity within the domestic banking system;

* Aggressive retail fund pricing coupled with relentless pressure on
loan margins which, together, continue to define the generally poor
profitability of Austrian banks;

* Slack loan demand for the foreseeable future as the Austrian economy
itself shows renewed signs of slowing down;

* High overhead ratios that are the product not only of underlying thin
core operating revenues but also of relatively high cost structures;

* The need, at least for some of the major banks, to rebuild their true
economic capital that, to an extent, had been impacted by the release
of hidden reserves (either through the sale of assets or reductions in
overprovisioning) during the recession.'

Moody's added: 'Looking ahead, the Austrian banking system as a whole
may have difficulties in pursuing any further far-reaching and more
painful restructuring after a number of years of targeted and
moderately successful cost containment measures.'

The agency highlighted the excessive number of banks. 'From a retail
banking point of view, Austria remains overbranched. With the exception
of Belgium, its banking system is the most overbanked in the European
Union with any one bank or bank branch serving, on average, a mere
1,384 people. Germany comes relatively close with 1,533 people served.'

Consolidation and restructuring within the banking system are needed.
Some progress has been made in the savings sector. But at the end of
the day developments depend on political influence and convincing
entrenched interests of the need to adapt to the new open environment
of EU membership.

Sorting out the privatisation programme would be a good starting point.
It would help to shape the future direction of the banks, as well as
making a significant, if one-off, contribution to cutting the budget
deficit.

Bank Austria is majority owned by the (historically red) City of
Vienna; but the Federal government has indicated its intention of
selling off its 22.8% voting stake. That has not prevented chief
executive Gerhard Randa from making long-term plans.

The greatest uncertainty is over Creditanstalt, where the long-running
saga of the sale has made it difficult for the management to plan
ahead.

While he was finance minister, Staribacher had called in JP Morgan to
put a value on the Federal government's stake - just under half the
capital but holding 70.5% of the votes.

Morgan determined that, while the bank was worth some S28-30 billion in
total, the government's controlling stake should command a premium.
That implied a valuation of some S18 billion, a useful contribution to
cutting the deficit (The Banker, 8/95, p31).

The coalition's collapse and the election meant that the sale was again
put off (The Banker, 11/95, p4). Now Klima has the chance to start the
process again. As usual, politics intervenes.

The sale offer had progressed as far as inviting indicative offers for
the Creditanstalt stake. It is believed that the consortium including
First Austrian Bank and Italy's Generali insurance group (known as the
'Austrian solution'), which has been showing interest for some time,
put down a marker. It is not known whether there were any other firm
approaches.

The nub of the issue is whether Austria will be prepared to allow a
traditionally black bank which goes back to the old Habsburg empire to
pass out of Austrian control.

Germany's Allianz insurance group had shown an interest, but backed
off; Switzerland's CS Holding group pulled out of a firm offer when it
met an increasingly xenophobic reaction.

Lacina, finance minister at the time, is believed to have at least
initially favoured the CS Holding approach. Klima is understood to have
opposed the deal, believing that the bank should stay in Austrian
hands.

Now he is in the driving seat. The problem will be to reconcile
national pride with giving value to the purchaser(s) of the
Creditanstalt stake and at the same time realising as much benefit as
possible to help cut the budget deficit.

There is a strong belief that the sales of the Federal government's
bank stakes will go ahead this year. That will be some relief to
everybody.

CZECH REPUBLIC: THE SECOND TIME AROUND

Parliamentary elections at the end of June are already casting a
shadow. Not that anyone expects the present coalition government led by
prime minister Vaclav Klaus and his Civic Democratic Party to lose. Nor
is there likely to be any disruption of the economic and political
stability which has characterised the Czech transition to a market
economy, easily the smoothest and most successful in post-communist
central and east Europe.

As Klaus has recently observed, his government, in office since June
1992, is already the longest serving since the collapse of the Austro-
Hungarian empire in 1918 led to the creation of an independent
Czechoslovakia - and ultimately to the emergence of the Czech republic
in 1992, when Slovakia split away.

This does not mean that this year's elections for the 200-seat chamber
of deputies (and later in the year for the newly-created 81-member
senate, or upper house) is likely to see another Klaus walkover.
According to the opinion polls, the main opposition group, the Social
Democratic Party, led by Milos Zeman, has moved up from 6.5% of the
vote at the 1992 election to around 20% support against 25-27% for
Vaclav Klaus's Civic Democratic Party.

By contrast, the two junior partners in the present coalition, the
Civic Democratic Alliance and Christian Democratic Union/Czech People's
Party, look like mustering around 6-8% of the vote, just about
sufficient to satisfy the 5% minimum to secure representation in the
new house. So do the communists, which makes the Czech republic the
only country in the region where former communists (reformed or
unreformed) have no prospect of being voted back into power.

But, while the elections are unlikely to see an upset, they are
nonetheless having an influence on the local political debate. Issues,
such as reform of the health service, education, pensions, and public
transport, which have tended to be neglected amid the broad political
consensus about the reform process, have been moving up the pecking
order.

So have questions arising from what prime minister Klaus has himself
described as the 'early post-transformation stage' to which 'Czech
society has now progressed'.

Longer-term questions about industrial policy, financial sector
regulation, and the role of banks and investment funds in corporate
governance have been prompted by a series of takeovers of companies and
investment funds and by several bank failures.

Last year's yawning trade deficit has underlined a growing debate about
Czech competitiveness. Can a country of 10 million people offer a home
market large enough to support industrial companies and financial
services groups capable of competing successfully in today's global
market place? Differences between the government and the central bank
over exchange rate policy have become increasingly public. The trade
deficit appears to strengthen the case for the Czech crown to be
devalued: the heavy, continuing inflow of foreign capital creates a
strong argument for revaluation.

The investment inflow is one measure of the international recognition
the so far successful transformation of the Czech economy has been
receiving.

Foreign direct and portfolio investment has been flooding in, bringing
the cumulative total since the transition began in 1990 to well over
dollars 5 billion.

In October the government fully liberalised all current account
transactions and also freed many capital account transactions, thus
achieving convertibility in terms of the International Monetary Fund's
Article VIII.

Then, in November, the Czech republic chalked up a notable double. The
country became the first in post-communist central and east Europe to
be accepted for membership of the industrial nations' club, the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation & Development.

In the same month, the country was the first in the region to be
awarded an 'A-stable' investment grade rating by Standard & Poor's, the
US credit rating agency.

The Czech economy, meanwhile, is expected to grow by another 4-5% this
year, for the third year running. Prime minister Klaus prefers to call
the downturn in the early 1990s not a recession but 'a transformation
shake-out' - a 'shake-out of the non-viable economic activities which
could exist only in protected Comecon markets, with distorted price
structures and huge subsidies'.

Unemployment never rose by very much, and is now less than 3% and still
falling. Productivity is rising. Inflation has fallen to single
figures, and is still declining. The Czech crown has been holding
steady on the world's exchanges. And, as Klaus is keen to point out,
Czech living standards (using purchasing power parity) are already back
to or above the level of the poorer member countries in the European
Union.

The only possibly worrying feature in an otherwise impressive record is
the trade deficit. Last year it looked set to reach dollars 3.5
billion, up sharply from dollars 470 million in 1994. But here, too,
Klaus sees this as natural in the early post-transformation stage of
the Czech economy.

Not only are imports likely to increase as the pace of industrial
output and construction quickens. Exports are also likely to be
diverted to the home market as the growth of investment and consumption
accelerates. With the country's overall international credibility
standing high, and investment pouring in, financing the trade deficit
poses no problem, at least for the present.

Vaclav Klaus goes further. He sees no reason to change the exchange
rate, unlike Josef Tosovsky, the able central bank governor, who has
been worried by the impact of heavy monetary inflows, especially short-
term speculative capital, upon the domestic money supply, and thus upon
inflationary pressure. According to Klaus, a devaluation would not
solve, at least in the short run, the balance of trade deficit, while a
revaluation - especially a small revaluation - would not discourage
monetary inflows.

Instead, the two may settle for a more modest change in exchange rate
policy. This would be to widen the band within which the Czech crown
trades against the dollars/DM currency basket. At present the band is
limited to 0.5% either side of parity.

Changing the band to as much as 3%, or possibly even 5%, either side of
parity could help to deter speculative flows as well as provide some
scope to promote competitiveness.

Competitiveness has already been improving to some extent. Industrial
productivity has risen. The low level of unemployment, despite large,
continuing lay-offs, indicates that the manpower shake-out in some
sectors has been absorbed by the fast growing small business and
services sectors.

'The low level of unemployment is a bottleneck to higher growth,' says
Josef Tosovsky of the National Bank; 'manpower and other resources are
still being hoarded by inefficient firms'.

Lubomir Soudek, chairman and chief executive of Skoda Plzen, the
country's largest heavy engineering firm, makes a similar point.

'Czech industry faces several competitive disadvantages. We still lag
behind in technology. There are still big problems over working methods
and ethics, including lower labour productivity because of outdated
management methods.

The general lack of capital is a major hindrance.

'Short-term loans from local Czech banks are not on as good terms as
those offered by western banks to their clients. Finally, a drawback
that cannot be overlooked is the relatively low level of direct
government support for Czech industry.'

As Soudek indicates, prime minister Klaus is inclined to leave things
to the market. But, for a long while, banks and other creditors
appeared reluctant to enforce the bankruptcy laws.

These were considerably strengthened in 1993 and another amendment to
quicken liquidation proceedings is in preparation now. It is only
recently, however, that the rate of enforcement has picked up. Between
late 1992 and May 1995 a total of 4,500 bankruptcy petitions were
filed, but only 600 bankruptcies were declared.

There are other indications that the pace of restructuring in Czech
industry may be about to quicken. Last year the second and final wave
of the Czech republic's voucher privatisation programme was completed,
raising the share of the country's gross domestic product generated by
the private sector to more than 70%. The flow of foreign direct
investment also boomed in 1995, in part boosted by the partial
privatisation sale of SPT Telecom to the Swiss and Dutch
telecommunications groups.

As Lubomir Soudek of Skoda Plzen says, many Czech companies are too
small to compete with the largest multinationals.

In October Stratton, a US investment company owned by Michael Dingman,
a Bahamas-based industrialist, announced that it had bought stakes in
eight leading Czech companies (in shipping, glass-making, pulp and
paper, and oil and gas exploration) from Prague-based Harvard Capital &
Consulting, the big privatisation investment fund group.

Stratton proposed to inject marketing, management, and financial
expertise into the eight firms, regarding itself as a medium-term
investor.

Eventually, it would sell its shares on to strategic investors or float
them on the market. Meanwhile, Stratton and Harvard (which had
subsequently bought in the market further shares in the same companies)
would vote their shares jointly.

This was followed by a move against other big privatisation investment
funds by a little-known Czech firm called Motoinvest acting in concert
with Plzenska Banka and Agrobanka, two local banks. In a series of
stock market raids, Motoinvest bought blocks of shares in six
investment funds run by established local fund managers, saying that it
would dispense with the existing management and run the funds itself.

Shortly afterwards, Bankers Trust bought by agreement 40% stakes in two
investment funds run by Ceska Sporitelna (Czech Savings Bank),
intending to sell the stakes on to Western institutional investors.

Each of these moves, but especially Motoinvest's, sent a shock wave
through the relatively staid world of Czech fund management.
Motoinvest's ploy demonstrated the funds' vulnerability as long as
their own shares trade at big discounts to net asset value. The obvious
conclusion was that fund managers need to generate much better returns
on their portfolio of investments in privatised companies.

The government was also prompted to act more speedily to tighten up the
regulatory framework. The lack of transparency on the Prague Stock
Exchange has long been criticised as a major shortcoming and a source
of weakness. In future, acquisitions of stakes of more than 10% in a
company will have to be disclosed.

At the same time, the law is being changed to allow investment funds,
which have hitherto been restricted to a maximum 20% holding in any one
company, to elect to become managerial funds permitted to acquire
majority stakes in Czech companies.

Big changes also appear to be impending in the banking sector. Foreign
banks were becoming a major force in the local corporate and investment
banking markets when the National Bank temporarily stopped issuing new
banking licences in late 1993 and set about trying to encourage the
emergence through mergers of a tier of middle-sized local banks.

Now, with the failure of these hopes (despite the impending merger of
Banka Hana and Zemska Banka) and with the Czech government about
formally to announce its bid for European Union membership, the
National Bank is thinking of lifting or easing the ban on new licences,
with the UK's Midland Bank apparently heading the list of possible new
arrivals.

Meanwhile, two of the four large local banks, Ceska Sporitelna and
Ceskoslovenska Obchodni Banka (the former foreign trade bank), are at
'the very preliminary stage' of discussing the possibility of a merger.

These talks may never come to anything. But they point to one possible
way forward. The big local banks in the Czech republic (like those in
Hungary, another country of 10 million people) are relatively tiny
compared with the foreign banks with which they increasingly have to
compete, such as the big German, Austrian, American (including now GE
Capital), Swiss, and Dutch banks building up key positions in the
region's banking and financial markets.

Sooner or later, the 'big' local banks will have to follow their major
corporate clients as they expand abroad, just as Western banks had to
in their day.

As competition builds up in the run-up to European Union membership,
the big Czech (and Hungarian, Polish and other) banks will need to seek
strategic partners of their own or, alternatively, try to outgrow the
limitations of their own local home market by making acquisitions
elsewhere in the region.

In banking, as in other sectors, the second and perhaps the harder
stage of the transformation of the Czech economy is getting seriously
under way.

GLOBAL BANKING: HOME AND AWAY

The world's Top 50 global banks appear to have slowed their expansion
abroad as the trend towards consolidation in domestic banking sectors
takes hold.

The Banker's latest survey of global banking suggests that, while some
have expanded their percentage of overseas assets, others have returned
their focus to domestic markets.

The top ranking continues to be headed by the UK's Standard Chartered
with its percentage of assets abroad remaining above 70%. However, for
the second year running, the bank has relied on Hongkong for more than
50% of its pre-tax profits. Nevertheless, it does have an extensive
network throughout the high-growth region of Asia; predators with
ambitions in the area would find Standard Chartered a tempting
acquisition. In January, rumours were circulating, with the UK's
National Westminster Bank, ranked 13th globally, as a potential bidder.

One new entry into the top five is ABN-Amro Bank, whose overseas assets
figure this year of 61% includes those assets domiciled overseas booked
through the Netherlands. This figure looks set to increase further for
in 1994, the number of the bank's overseas branches increased from 461
to 540.

The Netherland's second largest bank, ING Bank, is also a bank that
focuses on international activities, having entered obscure foreign
markets such as North Korea and Cuba before its rivals. Its acquisition
of failed Barings will enhance its international activities. However,
the lack of information provided by the bank on its overseas assets
makes a comparison with ABN-Amro difficult. It is not surprising to
find the Dutch banks venturing abroad, given their saturated home
market.

The top players continue to include the 'Big Three' from Switzerland,
but their position in the global rankings has changed as they vie to
gain control of their domestic market.

Swiss Bank Corporation expanded domestically in 1994 through
acquisition, co-operation agreements and minority stakes, losing seven
places in the rankings as the percentage of its assets held abroad fell
from 53% to 47%.

Union Bank of Switzerland also expanded domestically by acquiring five
regional banks, resulting in a drop in its ranking to fourth from
second. CS Holdings made its large domestic acquisition of Swiss
Volksbank in 1993, followed in 1994 with the absorption of
Switzerland's largest regional bank, New Bank of Argovie.

However, such actions at home do not represent a change in overall
global strategy. Swiss Bank Corp took over the UK's SG Warburg in 1995
and CS Holdings has risen to second place in this year's rankings. Its
assets in the US through investment banking subsidiary CS First Boston
represent 30% of group total assets.

Other strong European representations come from the five French banks
which hold more than 40% of their assets abroad. Surprisingly, troubled
Credit Lyonnais, under pressure to dispose of assets to pay for its
overexpansion in the 1980s, now leads the French pack with 53.6%.
According to the controversial rescue plan announced in early 1995,
Credit Lyonnais was ordered to sell off 30% of its foreign assets.

Deutsche Bank leads the four German banks in the list, with 43% of
assets abroad as of end December 1994. Deutsche Bank's chairman Hilmar
Kopper said in November that the bank was only 'half German' and has
designs to become a global player in wholesale operations. With a 2.7%
share of the European Union market, it is the market leader and is
strengthening its investment banking operations in London through
subsidiary Deutsche Morgan Grenfell.

Better disclosure from Dresdner Bank indicates that 33% of its assets
are held abroad, and this figure looks set to rise further with last
year's acquisition of the UK's Kleinwort Benson.

Other developments among the European banks include a drop in Banco
Santander's assets abroad, from 38.6% to 29.7%, as a result of
absorbing failed Banesto. Banco Bilbao Vizcaya now assumes the position
of top global Spanish bank. In December, the UK's National Westminster
Bank sold off its US retail and commercial banking operations as a
result of competition arising from the rapid pace of consolidation in
the US banking market.

However, one of the bank's strategies is to build up NatWest Markets
internationally and it has recently expanded its futures operations in
Asia.

Outside Europe, Japan continues to be represented by 10 banks with two
newcomers, Mitsubishi Trust & Banking and Sumitomo Trust & Banking, in
this year's list through better disclosure of their overseas
activities. Their annual reports indicate ambitions to expand abroad,
especially in China and the Asia region. This is not surprising, given
the prolonged recession at home. However, a merger on 1 April between
Bank of Tokyo, the most international of the Japanese banks, and the
domestically stronger Mitsubishi Bank will create the world's largest
bank, but with a higher proportion of the new banks' assets residing at
home.

Of the three Australian banks in the list, a contrast of strategies
exists between National Australia Bank and Westpac. National Australia
Bank continues to expand abroad with its acquisition of Michigan
National Corp of the US, increasing its overseas assets figure to 47%.
This will be reflected in next year's survey. Meanwhile Westpac is
continuing to refocus on its domestic market after reckless over-
expansion in the 1980s, resulting in 1992 in a loss equivalent to one
third of its then Tier One capital.

Of the six US banks in the ranking, JP Morgan, Bankers Trust and
Citicorp all hold over 45% of their assets abroad. However, with
possible new regulations regarding interstate banking, US banks may
take advantage of the new opportunities to expand domestically.

Indeed, a process of consolidation is under way within the US banking
sector and in 1995, the biggest bank in the US was created by the
merger between Chemical Banking and Chase Manhattan. Now they hold
23.6% and 29.8% of assets abroad respectively, with the merger creating
a more powerful domestic than international franchise. For the moment.

Where they come from

Europe                  (25)
North America           (10)
Japan                   (10)

How we did it

The Banker's annual listing of global banks ranks the Top 100 largest
banks in the world according to their percentage of assets based
overseas. They all have a presence in London, New York and Tokyo.

Figures have been obtained from the banks or from their annual reports.
The ideal measure consists of assets booked through overseas offices as
well as overseas assets booked through domestic ones.

In some cases, through lack of information, estimates such as income
generated abroad have been used as the next best indicator.

To enable a comparison of global reach, asset figures in seven leading
financial centres are provided. However, in most cases the given
figures will exclude those assets domiciled in those overseas centres
which have been booked through domestic offices. Nevertheless, they do
provide an indication of the relative sizes of foreign banks'
operations.

Owing to the lack of information for London, employee totals have been
used, drawn from the November 1995 issue.

For Hongkong figures include the banks' subsidiaries but not their
branches.

For Singapore, figures also include contingent liabilities and
commitments.

JAPAN: HASHIMOTO TO THE RESCUE

History cannot record many cases of a country swapping prime ministers
for the sake of its banks and yet this is what has happened in Japan.

With the fate of the bankrupt housing loan corporations (Jusen) hanging
in the balance, and thus that of the banking system too, political
tough guy Ryutaro Hashimoto has taken over from mild-mannered Tomiichi
Murayama the role of premier and also that of defender of the financial
system.

Hashimoto would have become prime minister sooner or later - his
election last year as president of the majority Liberal Democratic
Party (LDP) ensured that. But Murayama's sudden resignation in early
January was precipitated not so much by a process of natural selection
as by fears that the parliamentary opposition would make mincemeat of
him over the Jusen affair. If he is to save his own political skin, and
the reputation of the parliamentary coalition in which he served as
trade and industry minister, Hashimoto has to champion the Jusen
rescue.

The issue is extremely important, not only for Japan but equally for
international financial markets. The fragile Japanese banking system
could be plunged back into turmoil if the Jusen scheme is turned into a
political football. The so-called Japan premium would reappear in
interbank markets, the Tokyo stock market would likely reverse its
recent gains and a dangerous downward economic spiral could result.

With so much at stake it was small wonder that Murayama, who is 71
years old and weary from the burden of 18 months in office, should
shrink from facing what threatened to be a full frontal challenge once
Japan's national Diet reconvened on 22 January. The Shinshinto
opposition party now has at its head Ichiro Ozawa, a man every bit as
ruthless politically as Hashimoto and who will seize any opportunity to
bring down the ruling coalition.

In a country like Japan which loves to hate its bankers, Shanshinto has
nothing to lose and everything to gain by capitalising on the Jusen
issue.

Japanese voters are often assumed to be docile but there is a
surprising degree of popular outrage over the scheme devised last
December by the Ministry of Finance (MoF) to rescue the mortgage
lending firm - using Yen 685 billion or dollars 6.8 billion of taxpayer
subsidies in the process .

Even now, some five years after the collapse of Japan's bubble economy,
bankers are still being berated by politicians and the public for
causing the bubble. That banks were forced into financing speculative
assets in the late 1980s after financial deregulation sent many former
clients in search of capital market finance rather than bank borrowings
is overlooked.

Virtually everyone is baying for the blood of the bankers and Ozawa is
an astute enough politician to exploit the popular ire and try to bring
about the downfall of the Hashimoto government over the Jusen issue.
Few in Japan would argue with Shinshinto's right to force the coalition
to seek a popular mandate after its unseemly power grab in 1993, but
the few who realise what is at stake wish the opposition had chosen
another issue on which to go to war.

The Jusen scheme represented the coping stone of an elaborate edifice
constructed by the finance minister under its former political head
Masayoshi Takemura, who heads the minority Sakigaki party within
Hashimoto's coalition. Under initiatives announced late last year, the
MoF arranged first for banks to come clean on their bubble-economy bad
loans, to beef up their management systems and to agree to a Resolution
Trust-type body being set up, financed by a steep hike in deposit
insurance premiums.

The ministry also promised to thoroughly overhaul itself and to render
its opaque supervision of Japan's financial system more transparent and
accountable in future.

But it was the Jusen scheme (which involved a considerable financial
sacrifice on the part of Japanese banks) that finally tipped
international confidence back in Japan's favour. Now, this could be in
jeopardy once more.

The Jusen problem is big by any measure. Out of total loans of around
Yen 13 trillion the seven firms (which began with residential mortgage
lending before splurging on commercial real estate financing in the
bubble economy) have seen some Yen 6.3 trillion worth go bad. Most is
attributable to banks and it represents one-third of the Yen 18
trillion in loans which the MoF says is now irrecoverable in the
Japanese financial system.

The public has selected the wrong target in pillorying the banks over
the Jusen scheme. Taxpayers' money is needed not so much because banks
(which founded and financed the housing corporations) have proved
unwilling or unable to shoulder the full burden of writing off bad
loans, but because hundreds of agricultural co-operatives which also
lent to the Jusen are shirking their share of the burden.

The co-ops, with formidable deposit-gathering powers through their
trading connections with farmers, have agreed to accept only a
fractional part of the Jusen loan write-offs relative to the size of
their exposure. Such is the co-ops' political influence, (especially
with Hashimoto's Liberal Democratic Party which depends heavily upon
the rural vote), that few politicians are prepared to attack them
publicly .

Banks are easy meat by comparison and even though there is risk for
Japan in jeopardising again the health of the banking system the
temptation to make political capita}il out of the Jusen issue appears
irresistible. If the Jusen scheme were to unravel, banks would be
forced to follow lengthy legal procedures in order to liquidate these
institutions and to crystallise their losses. The banking system would
see its international credit ratings sink even lower than they have
done already and more banks could suffer runs as the failed Hyogo Bank
did.

This cannot be allowed to happen, not only because of the systemic risk
it implies but also because Japan's fragile economic recovery will
almost certainly stall if banks do not soon become engines of credit
creation again. One reason why Japan's economy has been so weak for so
long - real GDP has grown by under l% on average over the past four
years - is because what little recovery has taken place has been
financed by a run down of savings and by tax rebates. Bank credit has
been absent.

Loans outstanding at Japan's 11 commercial or 'city' banks actually
fell by 1.4% from a year earlier to Yen 218.03 trillion by the end of
December, according to the Federation of Bankers Associations of Japan.

While loans at the three long-term credit banks and seven trust banks
have risen marginally, banks in general simply are not confident enough
about their balance sheets to engage in the kind of aggressive consumer
and business lending needed to underpin a substantial rise in demand.
Japanese banks badly need more generous tax treatment in writing off
bad debt but the quid pro quo for this was that they agree to shoulder
a heavy part of the Jusen rescue burden. If the scheme falls through,
so too presumably do the tax concessions.

Despite the critical importance of restoring the banking system to full
health in Japan, few people are prepared to sacrifice themselves for
this cause. This became painfully obvious when Hashimoto began casting
around for a new finance minister to replace Takemura, who himself was
only too eager to take theoopportunity offered by Murayama's
resignation to jump out of the hot seat.

Finally, Hashimoto had to turn 66-year-old Wataru Kubo, secretary
general of the Social Democratic Party (SDP), the second largest force
within the ruling three-party coalition to make the 'sacrifice' of
offering himself up as finance minister. What is normally regarded as a
plum job would have gone to an LDP man but all the likely candidates
declined it.

Although Kubo's appointment assures Hashimoto of socialist party
support for the controversial Jusen scheme, political analysts say that
by putting the SDP stalwart in the direct firing line the new prime
minister has provided himself with a sacrificial lamb in the event that
a senior minister has to resign to take responsibility for the Jusen
scheme.

Hashimoto will insist that taxpayer's money being put into it should
prove at least partly repayable, if the Resolution Trust-type
institution being set up as part of the scheme succeeds in collecting
bad debts and realising collateral.

A significant part of these bad debts is owed by organised crime
(Yakuza) syndicates which borrowed from Jusen during the bubble but are
now refusing to repay loans. Bankers try to collect at their peril -
sometimes literally on pain of death. The bad debt issue could well
prove to be fatal for the aspirations of some Japanese politicians too,
to say nothing of its impact on Japan's financial system and economy.

TAIWAN: GIVE US A SMILE

Service quality and conservative management appeared to be the keys for
success in Taiwan's rocky financial market last year and may well
continue to be the formula in 1996, according to local bankers and
analysts.

Even though Taiwan maintained a 6.4% rate of real economic growth and
20% growth in exports, the island's domestic economy remained cool.

Financial markets were hit by the continued depression in the property
market and a stock market that lost about 27% of its value during the
year, factors which also slowed expansion of private consumption.

The outbreak of a number of financial scandals, a rising number of
bankruptcies and intensification of tensions with mainland China in the
second half of the year added to the perception of gloom in the
domestic economy, despite the strongest export sector performance in
years.

Indicators of the sluggish financial environment included soft growth
in the M2 money supply, which slowed from 13.1% in January to 8.4% by
November.

More critical for bankers was the relatively cool growth in loans and
investments, which rose by only 12.1% over the first 10 months of 1995,
compared to 15.1% during the same period in 1994. Moreover, the
percentage of non-performing loans rose to a high 3.1% by November,
according to Central Bank of China data.

Taiwan's major state-owned banks, which are particularly vulnerable to
exposure in loans to the property market and small enterprises, looked
likely to just barely meet earnings targets for the first half of the
1996 fiscal year (which began 1 July 1995).

Earnings for the top three state-owned commercial banks suffered from
the impact of a rising share of non-performing loans and losses in
securities investments.

During the first five months of their fiscal year (from July to
November) compared to the year-ago period, the pre-tax earnings for
First Commercial Bank slipped 14% to NTdollars 2.8 billion, while Hua
Nan Commercial Bank suffered a 22% decline to NTdollars 2.7 million and
the Chang Hwa Commercial Bank's pre-tax earnings reached only NTdollars
2.4 billion, about 5% off the year ago period.

On 31 December, the First Commercial Bank had deposits of NTdollars
614.1 billion and loans of NTdollars 499.9 billion, followed by Hua Nan
Commercial Bank with NTdollars 604.5 billion in deposits and NTdollars
480.4 billion in ordinary loans, and the Chang Hwa Commercial Bank with
NTdollars 593.3 billion in deposits and NTdollars 460.1 billion in
loans.

Despite the soft conditions, the island's 16 newer private banks
(mostly established in 1991-92) continued to attract a rising share of
deposits and loans. With NTdollars 11.3 billion in total deposits and
NTdollars 10.6 billion in loans, the combined weight of the new banks
approached the scale of a major state-owned bank.

But the pace of growth of the new banks slowed markedly from previous
years and their ranks showed more signs of differentiation in business
performance.

E. Sun Bank emerged as the leader in deposits for the first time with
NTdollars 82.7 billion, up 37% over last year, followed closely by
Cosmos Bank with NTdollars 82.6 billion and Taishin International Bank
with NTdollars 80.6 billion.

Six other banks reported deposits over NTdollars 70 billion. But the
fastest growth was tallied by En Tie Commercial Bank, the newest
entrant, with 46%, followed by Bank Sinopac with 42% expansion in
deposits.

Growth in loans was clearly far slower than for deposits last year for
the new banks. Only five had extended over NTdollars 70 billion in
loans by the end of 1995, led by Cosmos with NTdollars 75.9 billion, E.
Sun Bank with NTdollars 73.9 billion, and Taishin International Bank
with NTdollars 73.5 billion.

Indeed, virtually all banks faced difficulties in finding outlets for
rising deposits. None of the 16 new banks listed more loans than
deposits by year-end, averaging 94%.

Still, the new banks were more effective in this area than the three
state-owned commercial banks, among which the highest ratio was tallied
by First Commercial with a year-end 81.4% ratio of loans to deposits,
according to data published in the Commercial Times (8 January 1996).

More significantly, only five of the 16 newer private banks tallied pre-
tax earnings over 7% on revenues in what was the fourth year of
operation for most of them.

Overall, the new banks earned an average of NTdollars 630 million last
year and tallied a profitability rating of 5.88%, according to early
data collected by the vernacular Economic Daily News (5 January 1996).

Bank Sinopac was the most profitable bank with 7.83% of pre-tax
earnings compared to revenues with a reported NTdollars 807 million in
net earnings, followed by the Asia Pacific Bank, E. Sun Bank, Taishin
International Bank, and the Dah An Commercial Bank.

Four other banks scored pre-tax profitability rating over 6%, but seven
failed to reach this mark, with Bao Dao Commercial reporting the lowest
profitability ratio with 3.52% on NTdollars 352 million in pre-tax net
earnings.

Noted Professor Yin Nai-ping of the banking department of Taipei's
National Chengchi University: 'We are now beginning to see the
polarisation of the new banks into those that are well managed and
efficient and those that have less healthy management practices,
including excessive dealings with affiliates of associated business
groups.'

Banking insiders indicate that banks that played it safe by reducing
investment in securities and high-risk lending and those that turned to
consumer loans in 1995 came out with more positive results on the year-
end balance sheets.

The earnings of several new banks were hit hard by the end to write off
non-performing loans, particularly banks that focused lending
strategies on smaller enterprises and the property sector.

According to the Commercial Times (3 January 1996), Union Commercial
Bank wrote off close to NTdollars 200 million, the Dah An Commercial
Bank took a hit of about a NTdollars 100 million, and Pan Asia suffered
a NTdollars 80 million in bad loans, mostly to corporate clients.

On the flip side, a number of banks improved their balance sheets
markedly by shifting the focus of lending strategy to individual and
consumer loans.

Huang Yungjen, general manager of E. Sun Bank, said ESB's share of
loans to corporations and individuals had shifted from about 60:40 in
previous years to 55:45% last year and that the target is half-and-half
in 1996.

'The consumer lending market is mature here given the per capita income
of over USdollars 10,000, and in relatively poor economic conditions,
extending more consumer loans is a good way to disperse risk,' Huang
noted, adding that 'we can put more effort on corporate loans when the
economy improves'.

Huang said ESB also gained through a management priority on loan
'quality over quantity.' While the non-performing loan ratio for the 16
new banks averaged 3.15% by October 1995, ESB had a 1.9% ratio, thanks
in part to diversification to consumer lending and close risk
management of major clients with loans over NTdollars 50 million with
assigned staff and a headquarters computer database.

Huang also noted that ESB gained by playing the stock market
cautiously. 'We held down the investments by our trust department to
between NTdollars 100-200 million and ended up losing only about
NTdollars 30 million, compared to other private banks that lost as much
as NTdollars 200 million,' Huang said.

Yet despite the growing scale of the new banks, Chien Hung-Tao, general
manager of Hua Nan, maintains that they do not yet pose a major threat.
'As the new banks are under strong pressure from shareholders to turn
profits and as they bear higher costs, they cannot use low lending
rates to compete with us nor can they compete in terms of foreign
exchange services,' Chien noted.

Where the state-owned banks are feeling the heat from the new private
banks is in personnel. 'Service attitude at the new banks is clearly
better because they steal good employees from us,' complained another
executive in a top three state-owned bank. A key concern for state-
owned banks is whether a draft law allowing them greater flexibility in
personnel management will be passed this year.

For the new year, local bankers express cautious optimism. A forecast
issued by the Central Bank of China in late December anticipates that
consumer and investor confidence will revive after Taiwan's first
direct Presidential election on 23 March, and with continued strong
export growth and accelerated public infrastructure spending in the
second half, maintain a moderate 6.48% economic growth rate in 1996.

But analysts note that the new year contains a number of major
political uncertainties, mostly focused around the Presidential
election. While incumbent President Lee Teng-hui of the ruling
Kuomintang is favoured by most pundits to win the poll, the process
will also entail two potential cabinet reshuffles.

As a new legislature was elected in early December, Lee has to appoint
a premier in February for approval by the new Legislative Yuan, but the
winner of the presidential poll will also need to name a premier as
well, probably by May.

Moreover, as the Kuomintang's majority in the 164-seat Legislative Yuan
was reduced to a handful (85 seats), the new legislative environment
will be less predictable and the weight of the grassroots opposition
Democratic Progressive Party (53 seats) and the right-wing New Party
(21 seats) on financial policy more evident.

Not the least of bankers' concerns is whether mainland Chinese leaders
will move to moderate the current hard-line stance toward Taipei,
particularly if Lee, who has been pilloried in the controlled mainland
press, is elected.

ESB's Huang Yung-jen noted that his bank's targets for 1996 are set
conservatively 'as there are a large number of uncertainties'.

'As the government tries to implement the plans to turn Taiwan into an
Asia-Pacific regional operating and financial centre, the pace of
internationalisation will accelerate as will the competitive pressure
from foreign banks,' Huang noted.

'Expectations are that the economy won't be worse than last year, but
also not much better,' Huang said. 'Many say that conditions may
improve after the Presidential election and that relations with
mainland China will settle down afterward, but this remains to be seen.

'So we will retain a conservative approach and work to maintain the
quality of loans, improve the effectiveness of capital use, and put
more stress on consumer loans and other products for the individual
market to lower overall risk.'

1996 will be a key year for a number of new banks, particularly as
three, Grand Commercial, Dah An and the Chinese Bank, will become
eligible to apply for listing on the Taiwan Stock Exchange next year.

But TSE regulations also require that companies hoping to list as a
first grade stock must maintain pre-tax earnings to revenue ratios of
over 6% during the two years before application and that the latter
year's profit rate must be higher.

Of the three, Dah An and the Chinese Bank both attained earnings over
6% (7.2% and 6.41%, respectively), and plan to better this performance
in 1996.

However, Grand Commercial, which only tallied a 4.2% profit rate on
NTdollars 530 million in pre-tax earnings, will only be able to apply
for second-class listing, even if it attains its ambitious target of
NTdollars 988 million in earnings this year. The remaining banks are
under no less pressure to attain this earnings rate during the coming
two years.

Roger Chuang, executive vice-president of the Grand Commercial Bank,
said: 'We hope that after the Presidential election the overall
environment will improve and the stock market will revive. with
continued strong traditional business and improvement in non-core
areas, we should boost our earnings up to NTdollars 988 million.'

TAIWAN: STORM DAMAGE

Taiwan's financial authorities offered a draft programme to strengthen
the supervision of monetary institutions as part of an effort to
rebuild confidence in the island's financial sector in late December.
It had been racked by several scandals in the latter half of 1995, one
of which led to the censure of the central bank governor.

The series of scandals began in late July with a NTdollars 20 billion
run on the Changhua City Fourth Credit Co-operative after exposure of
embezzlement by its general manager for stock speculation that
ultimately led to the co-operative's absorption into the Taiwan Co-
operative Bank (TCB). Since then, a number of farmers associations'
credit branches have also experienced bank runs.

No sooner had this storm calmed than a NTdollars 10 billion run hit the
Taipei-based International Bills Finance Co (IBFC) in early August in
the wake of the arrest of a 29-year-old IBFC dealer on charges of
forgery and embezzlement in another stock market speculation scandal,
which included the state-run Bank of Taiwan among its victims.

In early December, the private Overseas Chinese Bank (OCB), in which
the finance ministry is the largest stockholder with 14.7%, suffered a
run of over NTdollars 10 billion when local media reported that a bank
shareholder had allegedly borrowed more than NTdollars 6 billion
without adequate collateral.

Former OCB executive director Liang Po-hsun, a construction tycoon, was
forced to resign his executive post in the wake of the scandal and the
bank was stabilised with the aid of a rescue package by local banks,
but may face prosecution.

Although the impact of these events has so far been limited, their
occurrence has sparked official and private concern for the health of
the financial system and criticism of alleged slow reaction and poor
supervision on the part of monetary authorities.

In September, the Executive Yuan (cabinet) approved administrative
punishments for 54 officials in connection with the Changhua and IBFC
scandals, including Deputy Finance Minister Chen Mu-tsai and Deputy
Central Bank of China Governor Chin Cheng-hsiung.

The Control Yuan, the highest government watchdog organ, followed by
voting on 29 December to censure Central Bank of China Governor Sheu
Yuan-tung and six other acting or retired officials of the Bank of
Taiwan for the IBFC affair. Moreover, Premier Lien Chan instructed the
finance ministry and the central bank to develop a plan to intensify
monitoring of the island's over 4,000 financial institutions. On 28
December, Finance Minister Lin Chen-kuo and Central Bank of China
Governor Sheu Yuan-dong issued a draft programme to intensify
inspection and monitoring of over 4,000 financial institutions and
dealing with financial crises through a new division of monitoring
responsibilities among the finance ministry, the central bank, the
Central Deposit Insurance Corporation (CDIC) and local governments.

Under the plan, the Taiwan Co-operative Bank will no longer supervise
basic level financial institutions, such as credit co-operatives or
farmers and credit branches of fishermen's associations.

From 1 July 1996, the CDIC will monitor such institutions which have
joined the insurance deposit programme, and local governments (namely,
the Taiwan Provincial Government and the Taipei City and Kaohsiung
City) will be responsible for supervising non-CDIC member institutions
in their districts.

Responsibility for monitoring and crisis management over the island's
banks (including overseas branches) will be divided as follows:

* The Ministry of Finance will monitor new commercial banks established
after 1991 and the state-managed Farmers' Bank of China, the Chang Hwa
Commercial Bank and the Taiwan Enterprise Bank;

* The Central Bank of China will supervise the rest of the domestic
banking sector, including the state-run Chiao Tung Bank, the Export-
Import Bank of China, the Bank of Taiwan, the Land Bank of Taiwan, the
TCB, the Hua Nan Commercial Bank, the First Commercial Bank, and the
International Commercial Bank of China (ICBC).

Lin stated that, beginning 1 July 1996, branches of foreign banks
originating in Europe, the Americas and Africa will be inspected by the
finance ministry, while the remainder will be monitored by the central
bank.

The finance ministry will monitor the entire insurance sector, while
the central bank will oversee inspection of all bills finance
companies.

Lin also said that the deputy finance minister and deputy CBC governor
will jointly head a MOF-CBC financial inspection oversight committee
that will be empowered to adjust the method and rate of inspections.

Lin added that top executives of financial institutions will be
required to attend inspection meetings and that the finance ministry
will push to have internal auditors responsible not to management but
to the boards of directors or examiners to improve the quality of
internal auditing.

Lin also stated that his ministry would propose a new law to separate
the credit function from the island's farmers and fishermen's
association to bring these operations under the inspection system.

Sheu added that 'this is not a division of powers but an arrangement to
enhance the effectiveness of inspection and monitoring'.

'This is the first stage of improvement of the monitoring and
inspection system,' Sheu said. 'After a year or two, we will review to
make further improvements.'

Lin said that both agencies agreed that 'establishing an unitary agency
for monetary inspection is not feasible at present'.

In the meantime, prospects for passage by the Legislative Yuan of a
proposed statute to liberalise the personnel management of state-run
banks remain dim, he noted.

Hua Nan Commercial Bank General Manager Chien Hung-tao said the
scandals serve as 'a warning that banks need to continuously upgrade
management practices'.

'The Changhua City co-operative case was clearly one of wrong-doing by
top management, while the IBFC scandal was created by a working-level
trader,' Chien noted. 'Obviously internal auditing and management
structures need to be strengthened in all banks.'

Chien added that Hua Nan was now adopting a policy of moving employees
to new posts every two to three years and urging branch managers to
heighten awareness. 'Times are no longer so relaxed as before and you
can't blindly trust employees,' he warned. One banking analyst noted
that the finance ministry feels that 'it would be very difficult to get
statutes on firewalls to control affiliated trading between financial
units of conglomerates passed by the Legislative Yuan now as such
proposals would spark sharp opposition from the private banks'.

However, the analyst related that the finance ministry and central bank
'are already surveying conglomerate assets and their utilisation
quietly, even if they will not release such information openly'.

'But if the banking and other laws aren't revised, such problems will
continue to haunt the financial system,' he warned.

A watershed may occur, for good or ill, shortly as many analysts
anticipate a major reshuffling of the finance ministry and central bank
when a new cabinet is appointed.

President Lee Teng-hui is obliged to appoint a new premier in early
February in response to last December's election of a new Legislative
Yuan, but any premier confirmed by the legislature in February will
play a caretaker role through Taiwan's first direct Presidential
election on 23 March, after which the new president will have the
option of naming a new premier.

In the meantime, depositors may be finding their own solution to
uncertainty. According to central bank data, basic financial
institutions lost nearly NTdollars 175 billion in deposits from August
to November last year, while deposits in the island's postal savings
system rose over NTdollars 83 billion since July to reach a record
NTdollars 1.94 trillion by des lower interest rates.

TAIWAN: SIX FOR THE HIGH JUMP

The government's highest supervisory body, the Control Yuan, decided to
censure Central Bank of China Governor Sheu Yuan-dong and five other
serving or former officials of the central bank and the Bank of Taiwan
in connection with the International Bills Finance Co (IBFC) scandal
last December.

The Control Yuan's impeachment case said that Sheu, who was Bank of
Taiwan chairman until last May, mismanaged personnel relating to the
BoT trust department and did not exercise proper control over the trust
unit.

The Control Yuan brief stated that such mismanagement had sown the
seeds for the subsequent scandal as the former IBFC trader Yang Jui-yen
illegally borrowed NTdollars 39 billion from the BoT trust department.

Sheu declared that he would not resign, and he and the five other
persons impeached denied the charges. 'There are many misunderstandings
and claims not in accordance with fact (in the impeachment),' said
Sheu, who said he will put his case to The Committee on the Discipline
of Public Functionaries of the Judicial Yuan, which will now consider
the degree of punishment.

Professor Yin Nai-ping of the Department of Banking at Taipei's
National Chengchi University said the impeachment amounts to accounting
'to the public for the flurry of financial scandals'.

Yin noted that Sheu would probably not be faced with a severe penalty
'as he was not directly involved in the IBFC case and in fact the
central bank and the finance ministry coped with that scandal
relatively effectively'. He aded: 'But it will definitely hurt his
reputation.'

ASIA NOTES: CHINA'S MARKET LAUNCH

China passed another important financial landmark on 1 January, with
the launch of its unified interbank market.

The new system, being operated by the Foreign Exchange Trading Centre
in Shanghai, enables local banks and financial institutions to lend or
accept short-term deposits of one day up to less than four months.

It is using the same computer network as the foreign exchange market,
linking 35 cities in China. On the first day of trading it linked 27
cities.

'It is a very important step forward with respect to China's financial
reforms,' comments Benny Chiu, research manager of HongkongBank China
Services. He believes all the local banks and financial institutions,
such as investment and trust companies, will use the new market.

Stanley Wong, treasurer of Standard Chartered Bank in Hongkong,
believes that the development of the interbank market system and of
stabilised interest rates will enable a yield curve to be established,
which will in turn enable a forward market for the renminbi to be
developed.

Foreign banks are barred from doing renminbi business and so do not
have access to the new interbank market.

Until now China has had regional interbank markets with differing
operations and mechanisms. The Shanghai market was estimated to have
handled R200 billion (dollars 24 billion)of transactions last year.

Chiu explains that the new national market provides more structure and
formality by unifying the regional markets under the same regulations
and operations. It will also provide more market-based interest rates.

On 1 April, The People's Bank of China will start open market
operations formally, by which it will be able to offer interest rates
and control money supply.

This will enable the authorities to exercise macro-economic control of
the implementation of monetary policy, says Chiu.

Wong explains that, prior to the new system, local banks in China have
tended to lend or borrow among themselves on a city-by-city basis or on
a bilateral basis, lending and passing on surpluses or liquidity among
themselves at bilaterally agreed interest rates.

Difficulties arose in moving liquidity from one city to another. For
example, a shortage in Shanghai could not be readily met by a surplus
in Beijing.

This resulted in a disparity in interest rates, which ranged between 10-
15%.

ASIA NOTES: INDONESIA WIDENS BAND

Bank Indonesia (central bank), in a further liberalisation of
Indonesia's currency, widened the band within which the rupiah would be
freely traded from early January. The Bank has also issued guidelines
for a new regulation allowing banks to do derivatives transactions in
foreign exchange and interest rates, but not in securities and bonds.

The rupiah now trades within a 3% range in the intervention band, up
from 2%, that is, about 66 rupiah around an announced mid-rate, set by
Bank Indonesia against a basket of currencies. The Bank has also
created an inner 2% 'convergence' band, effectively within the 3% band,
for transactions with the finance ministry and government.

Bank Indonesia's recent band widening is the latest in a series which
began in December 1993. The shift creates more autonomy and flexibility
for the implementation of monetary policy.

Bank Indonesia is also pursuing a policy of depreciating the rupiah to
the US dollar by 4-5% a year to maintain export competiveness, since
the country still has a big current account deficit estimated by the
government at dollars 7.94 billion in fiscal 1995-96, or about 3.8% of
gross domestic product.

John Flint, treasury manager with Hongkong and Shanghai Banking
Corporation in Indonesia, comments that, given that interest rates in
other Asian countries, such as Thailand and Malaysia, have come down
quite aggressively so far this year, 'the chances are that people
looking for yield enhancement trades will move a little bit more to the
rupiah now.'

ASIA NOTES: WELCOME TO BURMA

The Burmese military government announced in late December that it will
allow foreign banks with representative offices in Rangoon, the
capital, to set up joint ventures with private Burmese banks. It is
reported that foreign banks would have to provide at least 35% of the
equity capital.

The invitation seems to have met with a lukewarm response from most
foreign banks in the country. Foreign bank sources say that most of the
22 foreign banks with representative offices would prefer to have full
branch operations.

Standard Chartered Bank, while looking at the options available, has no
immediate plans to do anything more than run its representative office,
says John Brinsden, resident director for institutional banking for the
sub-region.

Brinsden believes that the Burmese government's move in allowing joint
ventures with foreign banks is 'the first step down the road to their
eventually allowing foreign banks to actually run full branches there -
but that could be another two years or so.'

Besides the 22 foreign banks that already have representative offices,
a further 10 have been issued licences to open such offices. Of the 32
banks, most originate from Asia. The rest include four French banks;
Hongkong & Shanghai Banking Corporation and Standard Chartered from the
UK; and Bank of Nova Scotia from Canada.

Burma has two state-owned banks, 11 non-exchange private banks and four
exchange private banks. Government related agents account for a large
number of the shareholders in the four exchange private banks.

The biggest constraint on growth and foreign investment remains the
repressive military government, which in November rejected requests by
the opposition National League for Democracy (NLD), headed by Aung San
Suu Kyi, for dialogue in a constitutional convention. Burma's ruling
military junta has consistently refused to recognise the results of the
1990 general elections, in which the NLD won 80% of the vote.

MACAU: BEIJING BOUNTY

Like Hongkong, Macau is an anomaly in Asia. The enclave, on the South
China coast, represents one of the last two vestiges of European
colonialism in the Chinese empire. In less than 18 months' time it will
be the last such outpost, as the sovereignty of Hongkong returns to
China.

Macau's own transition back to Chinese rule will not occur until 1999
and most observers agree that this will be far smoother than even the
most optimistic predictions for Hongkong's return to the Middle
Kingdom.

These political developments will have repercussions on the banking
sectors of the two regions and on individual banks. The most pressing
credit risks of banks in Hongkong are derived from their vulnerability
to uncertainties surrounding the upcoming transition. Macau banks are
likely to be indirectly affected and this will become one of the most
significant issues for the banks in the coming years.

As a regional and international financial centre, Macau has been
conclusively overshadowed by the breathtaking growth of Hongkong. In
contrast to the British authorities in the territory, which adopted a
laissez-faire policy with regard to financial and banking affairs,
Portugal restricted banks from operating in the enclave, at least until
1982.

During that year, the monetary authorities in Macau implemented a new
banking law which eased restrictions on foreign banks setting up shop
in the enclave and in the following five years, about 10 such banks
opened branches. At the end of 1995, the banking sector comprised six
locally-incorporated banks and 18 foreign banks. Nevertheless, the
difference in the size of the two banking systems is immense: Macau's
total banking assets are just 2% the size of Hongkong's.

Ironically, China's flagship financial institution, the Bank of China,
is by far the largest bank in the enclave, accounting for 33% of the
banking sector's total assets. Moreover, it is the dominant shareholder
of the largest locally-incorporated bank, Tai Fung Bank.

The growing presence of the Bank of China in Macau reflects the closer
ties between the mainland and the enclave in the lead-up to 1999. This
was further manifested on 16 October, 1995 when the Bank of China began
issuing Macau bank notes. Until then, Banco Nacional Ultramarino (BNU),
the enclave's de facto central bank, was the only bank to perform such
an activity. In the wake of this landmark note issue, the Bank of China
is expected to play a wider role in Macau's monetary affairs, in much
the same manner that it has and continues to do so in Hongkong.

Banks in Macau share many of the same strengths and weaknesses as
locally-incorporated Hongkong banks. They enjoy strong profits derived
largely from handsome earnings on their mortgage lending activities.
With the property market at this stage reasonably strong and
characterised by a low level of defaults, they have been able to boast
strong asset quality. At the same time, however, the banks in Macau
exhibit a noticeable lack of diversification in their assets.

Like their Hongkong counterparts, they are engaged overwhelmingly in
just two business activities: trade finance and property-related
lending. This has been accentuated by the flight of various
manufacturing concerns to South China in search of lower operating
costs. Therefore, while their asset quality now may be strong, the
underlying quality of their assets is quite weak and renders them
vulnerable to a change in the fortunes of the property market. This
issue will become particularly salient in light of both Hongkong's and
Macau's sovereign transition.

As a consequence of the oversupply of residential apartments in Macau,
local banks have been continuing their expansion into South China,
principally through trade finance and syndicated lending, and this has
seen their risk exposures to the region correspondingly rise. The
proportion of China-related credits on Macau banks' books is also
likely to increase in line with growing integration between the enclave
and the mainland and a potential easing of China's monetary policy.

Although they share many of the same characteristics, banks in Macau
are less profitable, less liquid and not as well capitalised as their
Hongkong counterparts. Lending accounts for a greater proportion of
their asset bases, but they have a slightly higher share of loans and
advances geared towards lower risk yet lower yielding trade financing.
On a regional scale, their performance as a group, measured by a
composite weighting of their profitability, liquidity and capital
adequacy is only slightly above average*.

Further opportunities essentially lie in South China, as will become
evident, given the limited prospects for expansion locally. This was
highlighted in the first three quarters of 1995 with the total loans of
the banking sector growing by a very subdued 4.5% compared to the same
period of 1994.

The relationship between banks in Hongkong and Macau go beyond shared
characteristics and operating similarities. Macau's pataca is pegged to
the Hongkong dollar and in a few year's time the territory and the
enclave will be part of the same sovereign state.

In 1983 and 1984, when Sino-British negotiations regarding the future
of Hongkong were at their most tenuous and Hongkong was in the midst of
a recession, this prompted runs on a number of Macau banks.

Given that the Hongkong dollar is pegged to the US dollar, Macau's
interest rate cycle closely follows both Hongkong's and America's. In
1994 and most of 1995, this gave rise to a difficult operating
environment for local banks, with interest spreads being slightly
squeezed.

The close relationship and intricate link between Hongkong and Macau
will clearly be demonstrated over the next two years, with developments
affecting banks in Hongkong likely to have a ripple effect on Macau
banks.

If the socio-political situation of Hongkong or South China takes a
turn for the worse, Macau banks are likely to suffer considerable
hardship. This is despite the fact that Macau's own transition to
Chinese sovereignty is expected to be rather smooth in light of the
fact that relations between Beijing and Lisbon have been more
harmonious than those between London and Beijing.

Portugal even offered Macau back to Beijing in 1974 after the former
turned socialist. Macau's transition is almost regarded as an aside in
comparison to the international attention Hongkong and 1997 is
receiving. The enclave's value in terms of strategic financial
performance is far less than the territory's.

Macau banks will be operating in a period of uncertainty in the
intermediate term for geopolitical reasons clearly beyond their
control. Nevertheless, following an increasingly closer degree of
integration between the enclave and South China, the banks' assets are
set to expand if the economic conditions are ripe. At this stage there
is unlikely to be a sharp shift in the composition of the banks' loan
books and thus mortgage lending and trade finance will very much
continue to characterise their business activities.

In this context will be the growing influence of the Bank of China both
in its actual operations in the enclave and greater say in Macau's
monetary affairs. In the meantime, the world is watching events
unfolding as its high profile neighbour which will undoubtedly have a
significant impact on developments in Macau.

LATIN NOTES: ZEDILLO'S BIG BAILOUT

The loan restructuring at Mexico's leading bank Banamex marks a turning
point in the Zedillo government's effort to resolve the post-
devaluation crisis in the financial system.

Proponents of this move view the Banamex agreement as a big step toward
ending the year-old crisis, but critics fear the deal establishes a
precedent for mushrooming subsidies to the banking industry.

At issue is the government's agreement in mid-December to issue 10-year
bonds to Banamex for dollars 2 billion in Banamex loans, acquired by
the official bank deposit insurance agency Fobaproa. Payments on an
estimated 43% of the loans sold to Fobaproa were already past due, with
most of the remaining debts classified as high-risk and many expected
to become non-performing during 1996. The Banacci financial group that
controls Banamex will increase its capitalisation by dollars 1.1
billion during 1996.

Even critics of the deal agree that this will enhance the quality of
Banamex's loan portfolio and substantially improve its capital ratio.
At the time of the deal, Banamex management estimated that gross past-
due loans had increased from Mexdollars 15.3 billion at end-September
to more than Mexdollars 17 billion by December. The loan sale to
Fobaproa reduced the bank's past-due loans by more than a third; the
ratio of past-due to total loans outstanding fell from 12.8% at end-
September to 9% or less.

Banamex's commitment to a capital increase should boost its capital
adequacy ratio from 10.4% in December to 15% when recapitalisation is
completed this year. About half of the dollars 1.1 billion capital
infusion is expected to be raised through equity and debt issues in
capital markets; over dollars 500 million will be generated from
internal funding sources.

The biggest concern raised by the Banamex operation is the precedent
that it establishes for expanded federal support for bank restructuring
this year.

The quid pro quo of government purchase of troubled loans in exchange
for bank commitments to recapitalisation was established in mid-1995 by
federal agreements to buy dollars 1.5 billion debts from Probursa and
Serfin.

But the extension of the bank-support programme to the country's
largest - and one of its most financially sound - financial
institutions signals that all banks will be offered the option of
negotiating a similar agreement.

Banco Mexicano, a financially solid subsidiary of the Invermexico
financial group, followed Banamex with a deal in late December to sell
dollars 900 million in loans to Fobaproa and pledge a capital increase
of dollars 500 million by the end of 1996.

Questions over the scale of the government's open-ended fiscal
commitment to bank bail-outs will intensify in the wake of the Zedillo
government's decision to extend the ADE programme - which subsidises
interest relief for individual and small-business debtors - by three
months to end-April.

About 75% of an estimated 2.1 million problem loans targeted for ADE
relief - mainly credit card and mortgage debt - had been restructured
by year-end 1995. The hike in interest rates in the fourth quarter has
magnified the cost of the subsidy for the fixed concessionary rates
applied to restructured debts, and the extension appears certain to
push ADE costs above the dollars 2.3 billion budgeted.

LATIN NOTES: BANESPA GOOD HEALTH RECIPE

The Cardoso government's decision to end the year-old federal
intervention in Sao Paulo's troubled state bank Banespa provides a
symbol of the improving economic and banking outlook for Brazil.

While the return of Banespa management to state control marks a setback
for reformers who favoured outright privatisation, most analysts credit
the Cardoso government for implementing long overdue measures to slash
staffing and restructure assets that have left Brazil's largest state
bank in better financial health.

The Banespa action in mid-January helped a resurgence in economic
confidence, fuelled by further progress on the government's agenda for
social security, fiscal and administrative reforms that underpin its
stabilisation and growth programme.

A flurry of concern in mid-1995 over deterioration in the current
account balance and inflation has faded as the trade account has
returned to surplus and price growth has slowed. Monthly surpluses in
the second semester narrowed the trade deficit for the first 11 months
of 1995 to dollars 3.1 billion, while consumer inflation in 1995 fell
to a 22-year low at 23.2%.

And with international reserves hovering near dollars 50 billion, the
real was holding firm above 0.97 units to the dollar in January.

The banking industry should benefit from the improving economic
environment as stabilisation in current account and inflation trends
widens the central bank's room for easing interest rates lower in 1996.

President Fernando Henrique Cardoso's has indicated that he will move
cautiously in cutting interest rates. But with GDP growth this year
expected to approach 5% and minimal risk of an inflation resurgence,
banks should show steady growth in lending activity over 1996.

LATIN NOTES: NOW, WHERE WERE WE?

Argentina's commercial banks began this year roughly where they left
off in December 1994, before the Mexican crisis triggered a plunge in
peso osits as Argentine investors scrambled to protect themselves from
devaluation risk by seeking safety in dollars.

After bottoming out around dollars 37 billion in March 1995, Argentine
bank deposits have clawed back lost ground to reach dollars 45.1
billion in peso and dollar holdings - about the level on the eve of the
Mexico scare.

Investors' persistent preference for hard currency is evident in the
steady climb of dollar deposits to more than dollars 24 billion, some
dollars 3.2 billion higher than peso deposits in the banking system.

Industry analysts expect growth in peso and dollar deposits to continue
as economic growth recovers, setting the stage for a revival in dormant
corporate lending business by the year end. The fall in consumer
inflation to less than 2% in 1995 points to further decline in interest
rates from their March 1995 peak.

MEXICO: NO EASY RECIPE

Q The Mexican government has built an extensive - and costly - safety
net of programmes to prevent the considerable liquidity and asset
quality blems of the banking industry over the past year triggering a
wider crisis in the financial system.

What has been the level of government financial assistance to the banks
over the past year and how much will it need to allocate to support
programmes in 1996? Also, how would you characterise the government's
current policy on bank intervention, especially in the light of recent
moves regarding Inverlat and Banamex?

A Preventing or containing a financial crisis is not an end in itself.
The ultimate goal of the authorities should always be the protection of
the real sector of the economy and, thereby, the welfare of the
population. However, an immediate objective is maintaining and
strengthening the financial system, which has the banking system at its
core. This is essential to enable banks to efficiently perform their
main role, credit intermediation, without which the functioning of any
modern economy would be impossible.

Managing financial crises is never easy, nor susceptible to recipes of
general application. However, there are some basic principles to be
observed, among which the following must be included: preventing the
development of systemic risk; avoiding an unwarranted expansion of
central bank credit; shunning political and other pressures to bail out
stockholders of financial institutions while, at the same time,
protecting the legitimate interests of both creditors and borrowers;
minimising the fiscal costs that may be inherent to the policies
adopted to overcome the crisis and, if feasible, distributing these
costs over a number of years, and interfering the least possible with
the normal functioning of markets.

In order to deal with the impact of the December 1994 devaluation on
commercial banks a comprehensive package was adopted and is currently
being applied. The components of the package are the following: a
dollar liquidity facility; a temporary capitalisation
programme(PROCAPTE); adoption of the Investment Unit (UDI) scheme to
manage the problem of accelerated, and not contractually foreseen,
amortisation of credits in real terms caused by inflation; easing of
some restrictions concerning participation in the capital of commercial
banks in order to attract new investors, both foreign and domestic;
acquisition of a fraction of banks' loan portfolios in a two to one
ratio of new capital paid in by stockholders, so as to provide an
incentive for banks to maintain adequate levels of provisions and
capitalisation; strengthening of supervision; and a debtor support
programme(ADE) to encourage additional loan restructuring, prevent the
development of non-payment practices, provide interest relief and offer
a legal truce to debtors.

The projected fiscal cost represents a net present value of Mexdollars
90.8 billion (dollars 12.1 billion), equivalent to 5.5% of estimated
GDP for 1995. The fiscal cost of the ADE programme in 1995 was absorbed
via the application of a fraction of the fiscal surplus generated in
that year. The remainder, an amount which in net present value terms is
equivalent to 4.7% of 1995's expected GDP, will be generated gradually
throughout the life of the programmes. A portion of this cost will be
financed by the commercial banks themselves.

Direct intervention in troubled institutions has been limited to a few
cases. Recourse to this sort of action by the National Banking and
Securities Commission takes place only to the extent that other
options, such as merger or outright sale, are viable at all or within a
reasonable term. Banks' stockholders lose their investment, or see
their participation diluted, should the state, through FOBAPROA, become
an owner. In that eventuality, FOBAPROA would only be a temporary owner
as it would immediately proceed to find new suitable shareholders.

Q Monetary policy has been the focus of considerable controversy and
debate over the past year. Some complain that an excessively tight
policy threatens to deepen the recession, others feel the fall in the
Cetes (Treasury Bill) rate last September may have been too rapid.

What are the primary objectives for monetary policy in 1996 and what
benchmarks has the Banco de Mexico established for money supply growth?
A As stated in the Law of Banco de Mexico, the primary objective of
monetary policy is price stability. Consequently, it is imperative that
monetary policy in 1996 be aimed at fostering the convergence of the
public's inflation expectations towards the objective announced by the
government. To this end, central bank policy should be defined in terms
of a variable under its control and which the public can easily
monitor. For 1996, as in the previous year, Banco de Mexico decided to
set a limit on the increase of its net domestic assets. It is expected
that the expansion of the demand for base money in 1996 will be in the
order of Mexdollars 18 billion. The needed growth of the supply of base
money will originate from the accumulation of net international
reserves and a maximum increase of Mexdollars 15 billion in net
domestic assets of the central bank.

In its monetary programme for 1996, a widely distributed document,
Banco de Mexico announced quarterly limits on the growth of its net
domestic assets.

These limits take into account the seasonal behaviour of the demand for
base money and the expected path of net international reserves
accumulation.

It must be stressed that in accordance with the stabilisation programme
adopted by Mexico, monetary policy, combined with other measures taken
by the Federal Government, has been geared towards attaining, among
others, two very important objectives: a steady reduction of the
inflation rate and lower interest rates. The latter, however, will not
be achieved by artificial means but rather as a consequence of
generating expectations of declining inflation. It is a mistake to
compare, as some analysts do, the level of the Cetes rate in the most
recent primary auction (about 41%) with the rate of past annual
inflation observed at end-year 1995. It is prospective inflation that
matters. If the market expects lower inflation in the future, it is
only natural for nominal interest rates to fall.

Q The Zedillo government established a 1996 consumer inflation target
of 20.5% and GDP growth target of 3% in the document accompanying the
federal budget last November. Do you see the inflation target as
realistic and how will the central bank balance the conflicting demands
of curbing inflation and stimulating growth during 1996?

A Mexico's experience, in line with those of many other countries,
confirms that monetary policy makes its best contribution to economic
growth and employment when it is aimed at achieving price stability.

Banco de Mexico will assuredly contribute its full efforts in order to
accomplish the economic programme's 20.5% annual inflation objective.

Nonetheless, having an explicit inflation target does not necessarily
imply that the central bank is making a projection of future price
behaviour. It is a well-known fact that a central bank cannot directly
control changes in the general price level. Its influence over
inflation is indirect, through the effects of its actions on aggregate
demand. Furthermore, there are several variables, not under the
influence of central banks, which have a marked incidence on the
behaviour of prices. In sum, the proper monetary policy is a necessary
and useful, although not sufficient condition to ensure the attainment
of an inflation target.

To the extent that the average exchange rate in 1996 coincides with
that included in the programme, and indirect taxes, prices of goods and
services produced by the public sector, foreign inflation, and
international prices of raw materials remain roughly in line with the
projections in the economic programme, an annual inflation of 20.5% is
within reach. At any rate, the monetary programme was designed on the
basis of the 20.5% inflation assumption and will not be modified.

Q The peso's devaluation of more than 120% from December 1994 to year
end 1995 has ushered in a sweeping overhaul in exchange rate policy.

What is the Banco de Mexico's current exchange rate policy, what
criteria will guide future interventions and to what extent will the
Bank permit the peso to depreciate during 1996 especially with the
government's stated goal of an average exchange rate of 7.7 new pesos
to the dollars?

A On 22 December, 1994 Mexico adopted a floating exchange rate regime.
From mid- March to October 1995, Banco de Mexico did not intervene in
the foreign exchange market. However, during the last two months of
that year it did so four times in order to reduce unwarranted
volatility in the market.

Like most central banks, Banco de Mexico recognises that occasional
interventions may be necessary to smooth out erratic movements in the
exchange rate. Sporadic interventions do not mean that Banco de Mexico
has a real exchange rate objective. The market determines the exchange
rate and, therefore, the latter is by definition an equilibrium rate.
In that sense, the exchange rate can be neither undevalued nor
overvalued.

In order to present the 1996 Budget to Congress, which includes items
denominated in foreign currency, the government had to have an estimate
of the average nominal exchange rate for the year. However, this
estimate, 7.7 pesos per dollar, should not be interpreted as a goal. It
is not a revealed specific support level for the peso which the central
bank is bound to defend.

Q Do you believe that the existing central bank law goes far enough in
establishing and protecting the Banco de Mexico's role as an
independent monetary authority?

A In August 1993, Congress approved an amendment to the Mexican
Constitution whereby the central bank was granted autonomy. The new law
for Banco de Mexico was passed and came into effect on 1 April 1994.

For autonomy to be effective, the central bank must have control over
all of its credit operations. Thus, the Constitution states that no
authority may order Banco de Mexico to grant financing, either through
credit of any sort or through acquisition of assets.

One of the foundations of the autonomy of Banco de Mexico is the
independence of judgment of the persons responsible for conducting the
bank's affairs. Thus, its administration has been entrusted to a five-
member board chaired by a governor. The governor is named for a six-
year term starting at the beginning of the fourth calendar year of the
six-year presidential term, while the four deputy governors are
appointed for overlapping eight-year terms, each one being designated
every two years.

Thus, the composition of the board assures the stability and continuity
of policy that is brought about by a long-term perspective in the
setting of policy. Board members can only be removed for reasons of
serious offence, as defined in the law.

Existing central bank legislation in Mexico indeed goes far enough in
protecting the central bank's role as an independent monetary
authority.

Critics should read the pertinent Mexican legislation and modify their
characterisation of Banco de Mexico as an institution subservient to
the federal government's economic and political interests.

Those who claim that in spite of the respective legal provisions
autonomy has not been effective in practice bear the burden of proof.
Such assertions overlook the fact that for a long period Banco de
Mexico has not granted net financing to the federal government.

At times, critics seem to argue that central bank autonomy means having
the power to select the exchange rate regime. In Mexico, as in nearly
all countries, that decision rests on the government.

Q Do you believe that present international support (from the US, IMF,
World Bank and other institutions) is sufficient to preserve exchange
rate and broader economic stabilisation during 1996?

A In the weeks following the December 1994 devaluation, financial
markets reacted violently, as fears mounted that the government and
other borrowers would not comply with payments to non-residents due in
the short-term.

Mexico's crisis had immediate effects upon several markets, mainly in
Latin America, and there was a serious risk of systemic repercussions.
The gravity of the situation called for exceptional international
assistance. Thus, a financial package was put together with the help of
the United States, Canada, the International Monetary Fund and the Bank
for International Settlements. This package has allowed Mexico to
comply with its obligations and has thus facilitated the stabilisation
of financial markets. To date, Mexico has drawn dollars 20.8 billion
dollars net, far less than originally estimated, and in all likelihood
will not need additional support. As early as May 1995, renewed
possibilities for placing Mexican paper in international markets have
emerged and are gradually increasing.

GHANA: RERUN THE GOLD RUSH

Long known mainly for its gold and cocoa exports, Ghana has
restructured and diversified its economy enough to go from backwater to
bona fide emerging market in ten years.

In a business climate that is already flourishing by Africa's humble
standards, new opportunities are arising in what is being called the
continent's most ambitious privatisation effort. The Jerry Rawlings
government is working closely with the World Bank to sell off the
country's largest bank, two smaller ones it also owns, and other key
state assets in communications, transport, insurance and other sectors.

No matter how much promotion is done, no one expects it will be easy to
convince potential buyers to invest in Africa. But the run-up is
nevertheless providing extensive advisory work for the handful of
strong privately owned banks that already exist in Ghana. Add the heavy
demand for financing that the country's private banks already face,
plus the related business they see via the small but growing local
stock market, and you have a serious operational challenge for the
people who run them.

The busy environment has begun attracting experienced international
talent to Accra, where a decade of sustained 5% annual gross domestic
product (GDP) growth has brought Mercedes SLs, satellite dishes and
cellular phones popping up alongside the more traditional trappings of
African life.

In have come people like CJ Best, a veteran US banker who arrived in
1994 to manage CAL Merchant Bank under the auspices of an international
public/private sector co-operative venture called the African
Management Services Co. (AMSCO). 'It's an exciting time to be here,' he
said. 'The whole economy has become much more dynamic. Ghana has the
potential to become a focal point for all of Anglophone West Africa.'

From headquarters in Amsterdam just across from the ING tower, AMSCO
uses a combination of government and corporate funds to help owners of
promising African companies locate new full-time managers with the hard-
to-find skills they need. It then provides them with training grants
and networking opportunities throughout their contracts to help build
competitiveness in their firms.

CAL was launched by a private Ghanaian group that had IFC financing in
1990 when the government first allowed private competition in banking.
Since then it has built up dollars 39.4 million in assets and strong
local market shares in trade finance, capital markets and advisory
services. It needed a general manager who could build it into an
institution that top clients in New York and London would use.

For that AMSCO found them Best, who had specialised in African finance
for more than 20 years at Chase Manhattan, the New York branch of
United Bank for Africa, and elsewhere. His job is to help build CAL's
growth into the international merchant bank of choice at a time when
Ghana is poised to attract additional private investment from abroad.

He plans to devote much of 1996 to giving all his employees
comprehensive training through resources provided by AMSCO's Management
Development Fund, whose donors include bilateral aid agencies from the
US and Europe, and hopefully turn the bank into a globally competitive
institution that will set a precedent for Ghana and all of Africa.

'A lot of my work involves training by example, both on questions of
overall management and specific needs such as credit analysis, all the
various elements of risk and so on,' he said.

'We've historically provided a lot of letters of credit to Ghanaian
companies, and now are building up a corporate finance group that
should be at full strength in about 12 months.'

CAL is a rarity in Ghanaian banking in that it has no government
ownership.

It and the other local niche players which deal with an international
clientele such as Ecobank, Databank, and the local affiliates of
Barclays and Standard Chartered, have a unique vantage point on the
planned privatisation of the country's largest financial institutions.
They are closely involved in plans to prepare larger competitors for
sale under contracts funded by the World Bank, which recently said the
small private banks were 'more adept and efficient at financial
intermediation' than those the government owns.

Topping the for-sale list is Ghana Commercial Bank, the country's
largest with dollars 141 million in Tier One capital, almost half of
the country's banking assets, and an established international
presence.

Two smaller domestic lenders, Social Security Bank and National
Investment Bank, also are on the block. The idea is to bring the
government shareholding down to 40% in each case, with 30% being listed
on the stock exchange and another 30% going to a foreign strategic
partner who can bring in new management sophistication and an
international network to support the country's growing export strengths
in gold, timber, cocoa and other commodities.

All three banks could spell interesting opportunities if offered at the
right price. But investors are wary of 1994's 70% inflation and 40%
currency devaluation against the dollar, and few international banks
have shown interest lately in buying minority stakes in emerging
markets. Except for South Africa, they seem unwilling to take on
Africa's risks, especially in the wake of the Meridian-BIAO collapse.
That leaves much promotional work for the World Bank-funded advisory
teams.

Best's team at CAL, for example, is working with Johannesburg-based
Nedcor and KPMG Peat Marwick to get National Investment Bank ready for
sale.

Another South African institution, Standard Bank, is working with
Coopers & Lybrand on a similar effort for Social Security Bank, while
Credit Commercial de France and Price Waterhouse are working on Ghana
Commercial Bank. No one yet knows if any eventual buyers can be
attracted from Europe, Asia, the US, South Africa, or anywhere else, or
what sort of incentive packages they might require.

'If any place in Africa outside of South Africa is attractive to
international commercial banks, Ghana would be,' said World Bank
financial sector specialist Elie Saleeby. 'But the question is whether
their strategic plans leave them in a mood for buying anywhere.'

The privatisations are intended to be the crowning achievement of the
Financial Sector Adjustment Programme (FINSAP), a restructuring effort
that has received dollars 200 million of World Bank funding since 1987.
It has prompted big changes in Ghana's state-run institutions,
including a cleaning up of balance sheets through transfer of non-
performing public and private sector assets to a government trust,
reform of daily operations and introduction of new prudential
regulations.

'Noteworthy achievements have been made in Ghana,' Saleeby said. 'It is
a financial sector where significant efficiencies have been introduced,
although there is still more to be done. It's emerging fast, and like
all emerging markets there will be hiccups from time to time. But the
greatest challenge is to maintain momentum, and they've done a fairly
good job of maintaining it so far.'

The goal is to get Ghana's leading banks up to international standards.
The World Bank argues that can only come with the participation of top
international partners as core investors. Emerging market bank watchers
say such transactions can be a good way for the host institution to
obtain valuable capital, access to new management, and global
operational links that it cannot get at home.

Polish export finance specialist BRE, for example, sold a 21% stake to
Commerzbank a year ago, thus gaining 'a leg up on its domestic and
international competition' and a reputation as 'the most innovative
Polish bank' in the view of Creditanstalt Investment Bank analysts. ING
and Allied Irish Bank hold similarly sized chunks of other Polish
banks, and in December GE Capital Services paid dollars 87 million for
a controlling 32.5% stake in Hungary's Budapest Bank, which Credit
Suisse had considered but then rejected a year earlier.

That, though, was Europe. Africa may be of far less interest to
strategic investors of that calibre from Western Europe and the US,
perhaps opening a door for banks from South African banks to buy their
way into Ghana. How much it would cost is unknown, but sources close to
the process say the transactions could take another year or more to
conclude, and may require deferred payment plans of other sizeable
incentives. The Rawlings government has meanwhile already floated 30%
of Social Security Bank on the local stock exchange, and now may do the
same with the two other banks on its list.

Meanwhile, CS First Boston and Ecobank have also just begun World Bank-
funded advisory work on the upcoming privatisation of Ghana Telecom,
set to be the biggest divestiture since 1994's dollars 450 million sale
of part of the state holding in Ashanti Goldfields to portfolio
investors through a GDR and local capital market issue. Ghana Airways
and the Tema oil refinery are also set for sale. It all adds up to big
business for the country's few private banks.

BARCLAYS TESTS BARCLAYZONE

Barclays Bank has launched a three-month pilot to test the acceptance
of an interactive share dealing branch system. The touch-screen
multimedia system, called BarclayZone, provides a two-way video link
between the customer and Barclays Stockbrokers based in Glasgow. It
provides information, advice and facilities for share registration and
dealing. The pilot will take place in three branches and will test
customers' appetite for such a service with the possibility for
extension to other services such as taxation services, wills, unit
trusts, portfolio management and travel or health insurance.

A successful pilot will also see BarclayZone sites opening in airports,
train stations and out of town shopping centres.

BarclayZone has accounted for a 'significant investment'. It was
developed by Barclays Multimedia, a division of Barclays Group
Operations Technology, which was set up in mid-1992 by Joseph de Feo,
head of Barclays' IT department. It is the latest in a series of remote
banking services that were launched by Barclays in 1995.

Those included a multimedia kiosk developed in conjunction with Thomas
Cook to provide travel and related financial services, a home shopping
service via the Internet called BarclaySquare and a home banking
service via PC for personal customers, called Barclays PC Banking,
available at the end of this month.

Reuters, the news, information and dealing room systems' vendor, has
launched a software package, Kobra, to provide users with tools to
create their own information selection, manipulation and display. Kobra
enables users, with a constant standard display, to mix information
from different information sources on one screen.

Based on object-oriented technology, whereby programs are broken up
into modules (objects) and functions, Kobra integrates different types
of information (data, text and graphics) in real time.

Kobra comes in four different versions targeting different levels of
user.

Run mode provides users with access to pre-arranged displays.

Montage mode is for more specialised users to build their own displays.
Link mode builds on functionality provided by the Montage mode but
provides links between items coming in from different sources.

Development mode is designed as a toolkit for creating objects that can
be used on any of the other levels of workstation.

Reuters has also ventured further into the information superhighway by
acquiring a 2.5% stake in Yahoo, a software browser for the Internet.
This extends Reuters' policy of supplying news services on a wholesale
basis to various Internet suppliers (including Yahoo, the Microsoft
Network and Compuserve); a relationship analogous to Reuters supplying
news services to newspapers.

Peter Thomas, director media relations, Reuters, says: 'We see the
Internet as an opportunity for us but, as everybody else, we continue
to research the best way for it to be utilised'. He continues: 'Because
of its performance and security issues it is not something that we can
directly use at this stage, but technology is moving very fast'.

PRICE OF LOTUS NOTES CUT

Lotus Corporation has changed the pricing structure of its leading
messaging and groupware product, Lotus Notes, which is used by more
that 3.3 million people. The wholly-owned subsidiary of IBM (The
Banker, 7/95, p89), has cut the price of the desktop version of Lotus
Notes by more than half (58%) in an attempt to 'accelerate sales and
deployment' of the product.

However, Lotus has increased the price of the Notes server products,
required to run Notes in the network environment, to bring them more in
line with other client-server products which use a lower client cost
and a higher server cost, according to Jim Moffat, communications'
product manager, Lotus (UK). Before the announcement the client and the
server products' pricing structure was the same.

'Because of the performance enhancements to the product, we are
supporting many more users for our server, and because customers buy
many more clients than servers, the cost of ownership is actually going
down drastically,' says Moffat.

The announcement came prior to the shipment of Notes Release 4 which
started last month in the US and Europe. The product includes new
features such as intelligent agents to make it easier to store, and
navigate through, information; Internet access via the InterNotes Web
Navigator; and tools for developing Web applications. Lotus also has a
new Notes Mail client.

NEW DERIVATIVES MESSAGING STANDARDS

SWIFT, the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication,
has introduced a new series of derivatives message standards. In
conjunction with the International Swaps and Derivatives Association
(ISDA), the trade association for over-the-counter derivatives, SWIFT
has introduced message standards for single currency interest rate swap
confirmation, cross currency interest rate swap confirmation and
interest rate reset confirmation.

TELERATE LIVE CHANGES

In separate announcements, Dow Jones Telerate announced that it is
amalgamating its dealing room television service, Telerate Live, with
the service transmitted by its majority owned subsidiary, European
Business News (EBN).

Telerate claims that under the new arrangement the price for the
service will be free and the coverage of the service will be extended
from the UK to include the Continent. The announcement also means that
Telerate no longer needs pay EBN to produce its TV service. Production
is now shared with Flextech, a subsidiary of US's TCI, which owns 30%
of EBN.

Dow Jones will continue to support Dow Jones Investor Network the
forerunner for Telerate Live which is broadcast in the US.

Bloomberg, on the other hand, has announced the availability of its
dealing room television service to the European market. It intends the
service to be transmitted to all its customers' terminals free of
charge. Bloomberg believes the pricing structure will encourage more
people to take its terminals.

There is an appetite for such TV services in the dealing room but price
is a key issue. Dow Jones Telerate may have miscalculated by charging
for their service. A city insider adds: 'I do not think that Dow Jones
developed separate programme material that was so new in its content
and presentation that made it of value to the City'.

BOLERO CHOOSES SWIFT

Bolero, a pan-European initiative for the automation of commercial
trade documentation, has selected SWIFT to build the main component of
its system, the central registry. The registry, which sits at the heart
of the Bolero system, is designed to store and maintain information
about all transactions going through Bolero.

The announcement comes following the withdrawal from the scheme of the
previous central registry developers, Cable & Wireless, on the grounds
that they were hoping to set up their own competing service.

Cable & Wireless had participated in, and partly sponsored, the Bolero
project and pilot which comprised 25 multi-national organisations and
six banks.

The project was designed to prove the technical feasibility of the
automation of bills of lading.

Other sponsors included the European Commission which paid 50% of the
estimated ECU3.7 million pilot and Unisource (an alliance between the
telecoms suppliers of Sweden, Holland, Spain and Switzerland). The
pilot came to a successful end in mid-September.

TFS PARTS FROM SYNTEGRA

Thomson Financial Services (TFS) has pulled out of its year old
partnership with Syntegra, the systems' integration division of British
Telecom. The partnership was set up after the Bank of England's
appointment of Syntegra and Swift as network providers to the UK
securities industry's electronic share settlement system, Crest.

Syntegra and TFS entered the agreement on the proviso that Syntegra
would develop the SettleNet service whereas Thomson would at a later
stage bring expertise and added value to that service.

Explains Kevin Milne, director Thomson Financial Services:
'Unfortunately, despite our best efforts to reach a detailed contract
with Syntegra, we have been unable to do so. It now looks as though
Syntegra's policy has changed so that an agreement with TFS no longer
looks possible'.

Syntegra was surprised by Thomson's announcement but did not feel the
announcement would affect its positioning which it claims stands at
around 60% of the Crest networking market.

Crestco, the company that owns Crest, has commented that the break-up
does not affect the development of Crest, scheduled to go live on 15
July 1996.

On 15 January network trials began. During that time workstations were
rolled out.

TECHNOLOGY: CONVERT OR CRASH

When European political leaders confirmed the timetable for European
Monetary Union (EMU) at the December Madrid summit, media coverage
focused on the currency's new name and on which countries might meet
the macro-economic convergence criteria by 1999.

Little or no attention was devoted to the practical question of whether
the banks will be ready to meet the timetable. But, whatever the
political and economic hurdles which EMU must overcome, the challenge
of making the necessary changes to computer systems within the banking
industry may prove to be its most serious handicap.

As the sector is already dogged by a constant stream of software
failures, the risk of development problems on IT projects on the scale
of EMU preparation is considerable. This problem will be exacerbated by
a demand for specialist IT skills, which will be in limited supply.

So it is imperative that immediate action should be taken to prepare
for the conversion of banks' computer systems to handle a single
currency, if the deadlines for EMU are to be met. However, continued
uncertainty over the details of the currency changeover is impeding
progress.

EMU will involve largescale enhancement or rewrite of multiple systems
across most parts of a bank, all of which must interrelate and complete
within the same ambitious timescale.

To say there is a significant systems delivery risk is an
understatement - experience suggests there is a certainty of major
systems development failure in many banks and a very high likelihood of
knock-on impact on other projects and business functions. Moreover, if
a software development fails once an irrevocable commitment is made to
EMU, there will be no fallback option if a bank intends trading after E-
Day.

Nor will these likely failings be isolated incidents. The transition to
EMU will be exposed to the weakest link in the chain. If any one member
of a payments network is behind, for example, then an EMU-compatible
network cannot go live. Similarly, if a particular segment of the
banking industry in a given country is not ready, then conversion to
the new currency at the retail level cannot take place.

Failsafe approaches to systems development do exist. However, they
usually involve more protracted development timescales and their
adoption would jeopardise the ambitious deadlines for EMU.

A typical big bank has hundreds of separate systems in operation, each
with its own natural life cycle. The additional step of adapting these
systems for EMU may invalidate previous decisions regarding investment
priorities and shorten the shelf-life of individual systems.

For larger banks, the development costs of preparing IT systems for the
single currency are therefore expected to exceed ECU60 million.

However, following recent cutbacks, banks have little spare capacity in
IT development. For this reason, EMU investment needs to be
incorporated into IT planning cycles as a matter of urgency.

It is important that banks undertake both a 'top down' and a 'bottom
up' assessment of the systems impact of EMU, to arrive at a realistic
understanding of the changes required and a credible assessment of the
timing and resourcing implications.

A recent report, European Monetary Union - critical IT supply-side
issues, produced by CGS, evaluated the demand which EMU will place on
the IT services industry, and whether the industry has the capacity to
meet this demand.

The only comprehensive estimate of the systems cost of EMU to banks
stands at ECU5 billion. Based on this figure and on assessments derived
from experience of working on EMU projects in Germany, the Netherlands
and France, CGS has modelled the likely pattern of demand for IT
services.

While concluding that demand is unlikely to exceed the capacity of the
IT services industry, the CGS findings reveal that considerable
uncertainty still remains because:

* estimates of the demand itself are shrouded in doubt;

* the supply of appropriate IT resources cannot be turned on at will;

* the timing of this sudden demand surge coincides with other demand
peaks.

Although European political leaders have agreed upon the timetable for
EMU, the structures necessary to support the unification process remain
ambiguous and undecided. As yet no legal framework exists and there is
scarcely more clarity now than a year ago on the crucial question of a
dual currency operation.

Moreover, little work has been done to estimate how the demand for Euro-
denominated accounts will affect different sectors of the economy. Even
the characteristics of the new currency itself - such as interest
calculation and capitalisation rules - remain undefined. So to estimate
the full scale of the technological transition with any accuracy is
extremely difficult.

The costs of currency changeover published to date are minimum
estimates only and, in the manner of all such calculations, will tend
to creep upwards as detailed requirements become clearer. Indeed, as
figures were based on the assumption of a Big Bang conversion and a
period of dual currency operation now seems more likely, IT costs are
likely to be inflated by at least 50%.

One thing is certain, however: IT resources are not interchangeable
commodities and specialist skills in limited supply are likely to
present real supply side bottlenecks, despite theoretical capacity in
the IT industry as a whole.

First, larger banks and retail banks are more likely to use in-house
developed systems than smaller and wholesale banks. The danger will be
where internally developed old systems, supporting core parts of the
business, require major redevelopment to accommodate EMU. These are the
very systems where banks may be least able to turn to external
resources to make the necessary changes.

Second, for industry segments such as international branch banking, and
functional areas such as treasury, the critical path for EMU will be
the changes made by package vendors.

From an EMU perspective, packaged software, which is written to be
flexible, is likely to accommodate change more easily than much of the
old bespoke software in banks. Vendors typically have limited financial
resilience, however, and may be reluctant to act until the uncertainty
surrounding EMU is eliminated. And there will undoubtedly be a small
minority of package vendors who experience problems in implementing the
necessary changes for EMU.

As these problems will become clear only late in the day, affected
banks will have little opportunity to develop alternative systems.

Given the scale of effort demanded, it is reasonable to expect banks
across Europe to respond to the prospect of a single currency with a
frenzy of detailed planning and impact assessment. Unfortunately,
progress is far from uniform. This is in part a question of political
geography. In Germany, the Netherlands and France, for example, CGS is
working with banks which have a 'sleeves up' attitude to EMU, based on
a conviction that it will happen. By contrast, at least one UK clearing
bank has devoted neither time, thought, nor resources to the issue,
based on a conviction that, for the UK at least, EMU will not happen.

All European banks face the same dilemma: they can wait until 1998 to
discover whether their country will join EMU, when it will be too late
to implement the systems changes, forcing a negative decision; or they
can invest now for an outcome which may not arise.

It is unclear whether governments, or even banks themselves, appreciate
just how large an effort is involved in preparing banks' IT systems for
EMU, or indeed the urgency of moving on to a war footing today to
ensure that the necessary changes are properly planned and executed.

It is essential that institutions such as central banks and banking
federations should seek to encourage a more coordinated approach to
currency changeover, if the deadlines for the single currency are to be
met.

The first step should be the establishment of guidelines for banks to
assess the systems impact of EMU, combined with milestones at which
banks must explain their plans and monitor progress.

Early warning systems should also be established to enable problems
within individual institutions to be identified swiftly and rectified
before the point of irretrievable breakdown is reached.

Finally, contingency plans should be set in place, perhaps including
software rescue services, temporary bureau processing, or systems loans
between banks.

The significance of IT preparation for EMU should not be
underestimated.

Otherwise, come 1998, some countries may find themselves unable to
participate in EMU, irrespective of their success in achieving economic
convergence criteria.

IT preparation may seem a mundane consideration in comparison to the
continuing debate on the economic and political implications of EMU.

Nevertheless, it is an indisputable fact that no country will be able
to proceed with EMU unless its national banking community has made
sufficient progress in making the necessary modifications to computer
systems.

TECHNOLOGY: EUROPE'S IT BOOM

The European IT software and services market is forecast to grow 8% a
year for the next five years, boosting market size to more than dollars
130 billion by the year 2000, according to Input, a global intelligence
and consulting firm.

In another report published in January, European Software and Services
Market - Competitive Analysis, 1995, Input ranks the market shares of
the leading European software and service vendors.

In 1994, the top 20 vendors accumulated revenues of dollars 29.6
billion or 35.7% of the total European market of dollars 83.3 billion.

The report highlights IBM's domination in Europe, which holds the top
slot in France, Germany and the UK. However, it has had its position
eroded in the Nordic region by the formation of groups through
acquisition, for example, Celsius in Sweden; by forceful niche players
in Denmark; and robust defence of their markets by local vendors in
Finland and Norway.

US vendors such as CSC, Andersen Consulting and EDS continue to
dominate tenders for big contracts, except for SAP of Germany.

In the Netherlands, national vendors - Philips, BSO-Origin, Raet,
Roccade, Getronics - have recently announced alliances to extend their
geographical reach and extend their service portfolios.

The report also highlights the emergence of new entrants, for example,
telecommunications vendors, such as MCI and AT&T, which continue to
extend their range of services.

They have done this either through acquisition, for example, MCI
acquired SHL for dollars 1 billion last year; or by the creation of a
professional services unit internally, for example, AT&T Solutions.
AT&T is now in the throes of a major restructuring.

The report observes that some vendors are relationship builders rather
than technology experts. They are using 'value-based pricing' to
differentiate themselves from the competition and establish long-term
relationships with clients based on improvement in business, rather
than IT, metrics.

Among banks worldwide, expenditure for outsourcing, systems integration
and network services is growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR)
of 15%, says Input in a study of worldwide banking information
services.

Outsourcing is increasing at a CAGR of 19%, since banks are now using
outsourcing to handle business functions, network management and
desktop services as well as application and platform systems
operations.

A recent survey by Information Week of the biggest information systems
spenders in Europe in 1995 put three banks among the top 10: Barclays
Bank was the third biggest spender with dollars 1.3 billion; ABN Amro
Holdings was fifth with dollars 960 million; and Deutsche Bank was
ninth with dollars 814 million.

TECHNOLOGY: FRAUD BUSTERS

Last September three fraudsters were jailed for a pounds 120,000
swindle which involved the first home-made high street cash dispenser.
More than 300 bank and building society customers were fooled by the
Halifax 'card cash' dispenser which had been carefully built into the
front of an equally fictitious mortgage broker's premises in East
London.

According to Moira Lavery of lawyers, Dibb Lupton and Broomhead, not
one of the victims realised, as they tried in vain to withdraw cash,
that their personal identification numbers and card details had been
secretly recorded to make counterfeit cards, later used to plunder
their accounts.

While these fraudsters were caught and were jailed for up to four
years, the fake cash dispenser they built highlights the lengths
fraudsters will go to and the ingenuity used against financial
institutions and the public.

The Lebanese loop, a piece of camera film inserted into an automated
teller machine (ATM), is another ingenious device to defraud
cardholders.

For Lorna Harris, head of the fraud prevention unit of the UK's
Association for Payment Clearing Services (APACS), the struggle is not
to get complacent and to be ever vigilant against new types of fraud.
Although plastic card fraud can never be fully eradicated, considerable
progress is being made in limiting losses.

In the UK, plastic card fraud losses have declined rapidly in recent
years since the peak in 1991 when losses reached pounds 165.5 million.
In 1994 fraud losses fell to pounds 96.8 million , 25% lower than in
1993, and Lorna Harris says the 1995 figure is expected to show a
further downward trend.

Why the improvement? APACS attributes the success to better co-
operation between banks, retailers and the public and the banks'
authorisation strategy introduced in 1992.

Before then about 10-12% of all plastic card transactions required
authorisation but, since the banks got together and developed an
approach across all retail sectors from April 1994, some 30% of all
card transactions are authorised and fraud losses in certain retail
sectors have fallen as much as 75%.

For banks, fraud is not seen as a competitive issue and the UK banks'
willingness to co-operate with each other, along with the existence of
an umbrella body such as APACS, is viewed as critical to recent
success. Also, the negotiation of a tariff reduction with British
Telecom lowered the cost of authorisation calls for retailers and added
to the spirit of co-operation.

In other countries, card fraud has been rising and global figures for
Visa show a worldwide confirmed fraud total of dollars 675 million for
the year ending June 1995. The US accounts for 58.2% of this figure.
Many countries, however, the US included, do not have an inter-industry
umbrella organisation such as APACS in the UK and many believe that the
lack of such a coordinating vehicle has been the reason behind growing
losses in these countries.

New approaches are being used to limit card losses which are still
dominated by lost/stolen cards which make up 71.1% of the latest UK
losses. The emergence of 'hot card' checking has become invaluable in
cutting fraud.

With 5,000 cards lost or stolen every day out of a total of 86 million
cards issued in the UK the problem for issuers, retailers and customers
has been growing with retail outlets, such as petrol stations, being
the most fraud prone, accounting for around a quarter of all losses.

In the petrol sector, with a high volume of low-value transactions, the
use of on-line authorisation has proved inappropriate and 'hot card'
checking, using a simple swipe mechanism, has proved very effective. A
cashier can tell within seconds whether a credit, debit or cheque
guarantee card is being used fraudulently.

In the last three years hot card files and hot card broadcasting have
helped to combat fraud and provide a low-cost alternative to on-line
authorisation.

The market leader, CardClear, uses terrestrial television networks to
transmit data on lost/stolen cards to retailers and hopes to have 5,300
installed sites by 1997.

CardClear managing director, Brian Raven, says hot card broadcasting
has been endorsed by the UK banks for use in the petrol sector and
since October 1993 Barclaycard's losses (largest UK card issuer) in
that sector have fallen by 54%. Raven also believes that cross-border
fraud is growing (from 13.2% of all losses in 1992 to 21.7% in 1994)
and that the market need for hot-card broadcasting will expand.

CardClear hopes to use satellite broadcasting to carry its service into
continental Europe for use by European banks on a pan-European basis.
In January it announced a three-year agreement with UK petrol retailer,
Mobil, to install its hot card system in Mobil's 700 retail outlets
throughout the country. And Raven hopes to provide a range of
information services to retail and other market sectors .

One recent card innovation, however, does not appear to have been that
effective. The photocard has been described more as a novelty than a
fraud prevention tool and surveys from Norway and New Zealand indicate
that it has no more advantages than a card without a photo.

While two leading banks in the UK have introduced photocards, the take-
up has only been a modest 30% and industry statistics show that only
500,000 photocards have been issued, amounting to just 0.6% of the UK
market.

Sophisticated new technology is also expected to provide significant
improvements in combating card fraud, with new products to be launched
soon.

'Europay believes that neural networks are an important element of its
risk management strategy, along with the introduction of smart cards,'
says Patrick Nelson, business development manager for the UK and
Ireland for Europay International, Europe's leading international
payments organisation.

'Counterfeit fraud is still very much a risk for card issuers and
acquirers across Europe and many local systems are unable to deal with
this problem.

'Europay's new neural net fraud prevention system, set for launch in
the first quarter this year, identifies likely patterns of fraud based
on a merchant's international activity.

'This means that, unlike other neural network systems that analyse
cardholder behaviour, Europay's system is able to flag suspicious
purchases without any delay to the cardholder at the point of sale. By
focusing on fraudulent or targeted merchants such as stores selling
brands of upmarket Swiss watches, the system has the potential to
prevent 12% of international fraud volumes.'

Nelson explains: 'Europay chose neural network technology to complement
its existing fraud prevention measures as it can be quickly adapted to
take into consideration changing circumstances and does not require
strict models to be imposed from the outset. For the past 12 months
Europay has been working with Nestor to refine its system by using data
collected from clearing payment transactions.

'After rigorously testing the system on its mainframes to make sure it
can cope with huge volumes of data, Europay is now in a position to be
able to deliver the system to members either as a stand-alone product
or to complement the technology they have developed themselves.

'By tailoring the system to meet the individual requirements of each
bank, Europay is confident that neural network technology will play a
key role in fighting fraud across Europe.' The smart card also
represents another big step forward in fraud prevention.

France already has a 'chip' card in action which has proved hugely
successful against crime. But it lacks international compatibility. In
the UK, a strategic approach to add chips to plastic cards has been
established through APACS. The so-called ICC project is expected to
have a chip card in production by the end of 1997.

Although the chip project was prompted by concerns over fraud, and the
realisation that magnetic strip technology was reaching the end of its
life cycle, APACS soon became aware that the industry costs of
introducing the new chip technology could not be justified on projected
fraud savings alone.

APACS notes that the recent growth in electronic commerce has placed a
new imperative on financial institutions to be able to offer secure
payment services. The Internet is a prime example of the need for such
secure payments.

Chip-enabled plastic, as such, is a good entry point as the card is a
useful mechanism for transporting the chip which, in turn, is good
technology for storing the tokens necessary for secure services.

The UK aims to have 50% of its point-of-sale terminal base converted to
chip delivering 65% by value of UK transaction turnover by the end of
the millennium. It is anticipated that the whole of the ATM network
will be converted in a similar period or earlier.

The project, which includes the active involvement of the major
schemes, Europay (representing Mastercard), Visa and Switch should
provide a quantum leap in card security.

Smart cards will provide the future technology for the payments
industry.

Initially, experts suggest, the new cards will probably be programmed
with a signature comparison facility, along with an ability to check
the card user's pin code.

But if the technology improves, so-called biometric information could
be included, possibly involving a finger-print scan, dynamic signature
verification, back of hand vein checks, retina scans and - perhaps one
day - voice recognition. This will certainly give tomorrow's fraudsters
plenty to ponder.

THE BOTTOM LINE

The outlook for European economies and financial institutions over the
short, medium and long term bears considerable scrutiny. Uncertainties
and unknowables notwithstanding, the prospect of much faster change
than many people believe or can absorb is, or should be, of major
concern. The fall of communism in the late 1980s led to a cataclysm in
central and eastern Europe; the spillover, the spectacular economic
growth in Asia, and the pervasive impact of technology are factors that
many in western Europe may not have fully taken on board.

As historian Eric Hobsbawm noted in Age of Extremes: 'Perhaps the most
striking characteristic of the end of the twentieth century is the
tension between the accelerating process of globalisation and the
inability of both public institutions and the collective behaviour of
human beings to come to terms with it.'

Although western Europe is not alone in wrestling with these issues,
history and tradition weigh heavily on those in the EU; radical change
will not come easily. Already this year the spectre of economic
weakness and reduced growth has spread across the continent and touched
the strongest economy, Germany. Recent figures showing rising
unemployment, lower growth expectations and expected larger budget
deficits have altered perceptions of Germany and, as a result, Europe
overall.

Analysts believe the near term risk in Europe is one of deflation as
countries, while continuing to keep a hold on inflation, struggle to
meet Maastricht convergence criteria for European economic and monetary
union (EMU) and strong core currencies erode competitiveness.

However, the risks are also much broader. Much is at stake and monetary
union is only one aspect of a Europe needing to reposition itself in a
fast-changing global environment.

But EMU represents the prime challenge now and 1996 is critical if
union is to proceed. By the end of this year experts believe it will be
clear whether January 1999 will be the genuine starting date, and if
the project is viable.

A consensus appears to be emerging that a small group of countries
could start, but that both Germany and France would have to be
included, as anything less than two major economies would not be
acceptable. Will the convergence criteria be met? Some recent views
suggest that Germany and France are now likely to have deficits in 1997
of 3.3% of gross domestic product (GDP), in excess of the official 3.0%
criteria, but that governments would not object to such modest
overshooting.

The problem comes if the current economic downturn persists and the
deficits rise to the 4% of GDP range. Governments would then find it
difficult to accept such large overshootings, even if other criteria
were more or less acceptable. Does Europe, from the handful of
countries that could make 1999 to those which cannot, have the will to
meet the targets and strive for long-term goals?

Alexandre Lamfalussy, president of the European Monetary Institute, the
forerunner of the European Central Bank, made encouraging noises in
late January. 'European citizens are just as mature and well-informed
as financial market operators. Over time experience has taught them to
assess the effects of economic policy decisions from the viewpoint
which goes beyond the short term.

'They are, therefore, aware of the overriding necessity of bringing the
rising trend of public spending on social security, health care and
pension schemes under control - because they know that in the long term
these increases will jeopardise the whole of our social welfare
system.' Unfortunately, Lamfalussy appears more hopeful than realistic.
Evidence suggests that, except perhaps for the Germans, governments,
the public and financial institutions are not well aware of the long-
term implications of EMU and have scarcely addressed the issue beyond
narrow, parochial parameters.

Most banks appear not to be technically prepared even if the political
go-ahead is given. And what will be the relationship between the
handful of countries that could make 1999 and those which do not?

Uncertainties multiply and even if Lamfalussy's optimistic opinion of
'European citizens' is accepted, much still needs to be done to make
the partnership between the political decision-makers and the private
sector on EMU really work. There is little evidence to show that
financial institutions are taking a proactive stance on anything to do
with EMU.

Can a wait and see policy work? If the 1999 start founders, as it
might, and delays are ruled unacceptable, as is likely, the lack of an
EMU process will have severe long-term implications. EMU, like it or
not, is Europe's response to globalisation and if a void ensues then
Europe will be the loser.

Looking longer term to 2006, what are the prospects? The only
certainties appear to be that Asia will not stand still and that
technology will continue to reshape employment. Since the industrial
revolution technology has shifted employment upstream; today that
process is accelerating and politicians' rhetoric that more education
is needed belies the fact that fewer real jobs in certain sectors are
being created and fewer are likely to be created.

EMU represents a long-term strategy for Europe. It may not be perfect
but if governments, the public and also banks do not take a proactive
approach there will be no strategy. Europeans need to look to their
future and act accordingly.
