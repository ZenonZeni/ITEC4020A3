Wind power is one of the most ancient energy resources
harnessed by humans that is also proving to be among the most
cost-effective ways of delivering electricity services in many parts
of the U.S. and in other countries around the world.

The U.S. wind industry believes wind power could provide
one-fifth of America's electricity over the next several decades at
prices competitive with less environmentally friendly energy
options. To achieve this goal will take a combination of ongoing
                   scientific and technological advancements in the design and
                   operation of wind turbines and supportive public policies
                   that allow wind turbines to compete on a level playing field
                   with fossil and nuclear resources. Already, wind is
                   providing several percent of some states' electricity services,
                   like in California. 
<DD>North America is very well endowed with wind resources. Twelve
states in the Great Plains contain about 90 percent of the nation's
usable wind resource. In order of greatest potential they are:
North Dakota, Texas, Kansas, South Dakota, Montana, Nebraska,
                                 Wyoming, Minnesota, Iowa, Colorado,and New
                                 Mexico. North Dakota alone has enough energy in
                                 its windy areas to supply one-third of the nation's
                                 current electricity, although it is unlikely that it will
                                 all be developed to produce wind power.

Even after imposing severe constraints on where wind turbines
can be sited (for example, avoiding urban areas, environmentally
sensitive lands and national parks) there is still sufficient wind
potential in the continental U.S. to produce more than 4.4 trillion kWh
of electricity each year. This is roughly 40% more than the 2.9 trillion
kWh of electricity consumed in the U.S. in 1993.
<DD>How much wind actually gets harnessed depends on a number of
factors. These include the price of alternative options, and the
speed with which institutions like states, utilities, and regulatory
bodies encourage the development of market incentives for the sale of
                                   wind generated power among states and regions.
                                   California, for example, is not ranked among the
                                   top 12 states with substantial wind resources, yet
                                   its vigorous support for wind power has resulted
in most of the world's wind power now located in California.

In addition to a dozen states with enormous wind resources,
several dozen other states have pockets of modest wind resources
that also offer economic opportunities for wind generation either
by individual homes and businesses, or by utilities and independent
                               power producers for distribution through the electric
                               grid. 
<DD>During the past 20 years, outstanding progress has been made in
the technology used to convert wind energy to electrical energy.
More than 16,000 wind turbines are operating in California,
which produced 3 billion kWh of electricity in 1994. This is enough
                  power to satisfy the residential needs of a city the size of San
                  Francisco (1 million people) or the total energy needs of a
                  city of 300,000 people (Buffalo, NY). In Europe, Denmark is
                  a world leader in wind power; the country has integrated
                  3,500 turbines into the utility grid.

Electricity from wind turbines has
dropped 20-fold over the past two decades, from $1 per kWh to 5
cents/kWh. It is expected to drop to 4 cents/kWh by the end of the
decade. A turbine's operating life has also improved, from lasting just
                               1 to 5 years in the mid-1970s to operating 20 years
                               today; by the turn of the century a 30 year lifespan
                               for turbines is expected. 
<DD>More than a dozen utilities and several independent power
producers have already announced plans to develop new wind
power plants before 2000. New wind facilities are planned for
Alaska, California, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Montana
                    New York, Texas, Vermont, Washington, Wisconsin, and
                    Wyoming. Wind installations are also planned for several
                    locations in Canada, including Alberta and Quebec, as well
                    as in a number of remote villages throughout Mexico. 
<DD>Small wind turbine systems are often the most inexpensive source
of power for remote sites. Wind electric water pumping systems
are simple and rugged. Other common applications include
telecommunications and rural residences electrification. Remote power
                               systems using U.S. small wind turbines have been
                               installed in more than 70 countries around the world.
<DD>Remote wind power systems often incorporate additional
generating systems such as diesel generators and photovoltaic
solar arrays. These "hybrid" systems provide improved reliability
of power supply and operational flexibility. Only when the power from
                         the wind turbine is not sufficient to operate the load,
                         does the alternate power source come on-line. Hybrid
                         systems hold great promise for the billions of people
                         worldwide now living in villages remote from utility
                         grids.
<DD>Most modern wind turbines are used to produce electrical power
on site at homes, farms and businesses which are already served
by a utility grid. Because the average wind turbine generates
electricity less than 100 percent of the time, it may be important to be
                         connected to the electric utility grid in areas where winds
                         are seasonal or where energy storage systems are not
                         cost-effective. Usually, the electricity generated by the
                         wind turbine directly powers the home or business.
                         When wind-generated power is available, the user buys
less electricity from the utility. If the turbine generates more power
than the site is using, the utility buys the excess electricity, further
reducing the utility bill of the wind power producer.

Wind turbine systems are most promising as sources of
centralized electric power. Wind farms currently in existence in
the U.S. are rarely owned by public utility companies. Instead,
they are mainly owned by private businesses or individuals. The
                                   electricity produced by each of the power plants,
                                   which range in size from a few hundred kilowatts
                                   to tens of thousands, is then sold to the local
                                   electric utility.
<DD>In order to determine the best locations to site wind-power plants,
engineers undertake what is referred to as wind prospecting.
Wind-measuring instruments known as anenometers are set up
with recorders to take readings of wind speeds over a period of time (at
              least four months).
<DD>Wind power plants offer flexibility and modularity, allowing
utilities to install generating capacity as it is needed, with very
short lead times (in months or a few years, compared to 5 to 10
years for a large power plant). Wind power can also be used to support
                            new or growing electricity demand at the site of the
                            customer, preventing the need to upgrade transmission
                            and distribution lines.
