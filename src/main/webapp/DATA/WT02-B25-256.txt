Undercurrents: A Therapist's Reckoning with Her Own Depression
<P>
by Martha Manning
<P>
Review by Jerilynn Brezil Hoy, Froma Lippmann, and Kyle Wheeler for the NAMI Literature Committee.
<P>
	Undercurrents, an autobiographical account of a woman's encounter with major depression, is one of those rare books that manages to be funny, intense, and frightening all at once.  Although her subject matter is serious, the author, Dr. Martha Manning, views the vagaries of life with a wry sense of humor that leavens the frightening story she tells.  When depression descends on Martha, a psychotherapist living near Washington, D.C., she falls down the slippery slope as helplessly as anyone.  Undercurrents describes her journey into despair and the dramatic steps she took to save her own life.
<P>
	This eminently readable book chronicles 20 months of Martha's life through a series of journal entries.  Early on, hints of her impending depression creep into her entries.  She begins to experience sleep disturbances; she loses interest in doing things; overall, as she describes it, she feels as if her "transmission is slipping."  Remarkably, her entries continue, even in her darkest moments.
<P>
	Manning's family is also ravaged by the effects of her illness.  Martha vividly describes the frustration of her husband_-also a psychotherapist_-who can do nothing to "fix" her.  Her daughter, on the cusp of adolescence, observes her mother's descent into depression with bewilderment and anger.  In her journal, Martha describes with great pain the several miscarriages she's had and mourns her inability to have more children. 
<P>
	Martha starts seeing a therapist herself, Dr. Kay Jamison, who has written a book about her own struggles with manic-depression.  She describes a time when she is both therapist and patient, helping others and seeking help.  She also meets regularly with a psychopharmacologist who prescribes antidepressants.  Martha has many problems with the antidepressants, and she and her doctor try to find the right medication and dosage.  All this intervention is not enough, and Martha continues to decline.
<P>
	The depression becomes so debilitating that Martha finally considers electroconvulsive therapy (ECT).  Obsessed with thoughts of dying, she feels she has no choice but to try it.  Even through her hospitalization and six ECT treatments, she continues to write.  Martha's description of her emergence from darkness as the pain of depression slowly recedes is extremely moving.
<P>
	A year after the treatment, Martha still has problems, not only with depression but also with short-term memory loss.  Her writing reveals an understanding that she will never be the person she was before her illness and an acceptance of that fact.
<P>
	Throughout her remarkable journey, Martha writes in a style that is a pleasure to read.  For those of us who seek to understand depression, Martha Manning has done a great service by writing a beautiful, honest, and ultimately hopeful account of her own illness.

An Introduction to Psychiatric Rehabilitation, edited by the Publications Committee of IAPSRS.
<P>
Readings in Psychiatric Rehabilitation, edited by William Anthony and LeRoy Spaniol. 
<P>
Review by Helen Hill for the NAMI Literature Committee
<P>
	Psychiatric rehabilitation has become such a popular buzz word--or buzz phrase--in the 1990s that its meaning has become diffused.  An Introduction to Psychiatric Rehabilitation, edited and published by the International Association of Psychosocial Rehabilitation Services (IAPSRS), clarifies the meaning.
<P>
	The book has seven sections, each with a collection of essays written by both professionals and consumers.  The sections are:  "What Is Psychiatric Rehabilitation?"; "Experiencing Psychiatric Rehabilitation"; "Implementing Psychiatric Rehabilitation Programs"; "Training Psychiatric Rehabilitation Staff"; "Managing Psychiatric Rehabilitation Programs"; "Evaluating Psychiatric Rehabilitation Programs"; and "Psychiatric Rehabilitation Outcomes."  The usefulness for professionals is obvious.  Anyone working today with people recovering from a brain disorder needs to understand the principles underlying psychiatric rehabilitation: the importance of encouraging independence rather than mere compliance and the importance of work-with-support as an essential part of the recovery process.
<P>
	But parents and consumers need to understand these principles, too.  Parents, other family members, and consumers who want to advocate for better mental health services need to be well informed about the possibilities.  Consumers can gain understanding by sharing the experiences of others who have written about themselves.
<P>
	Joan Nobiling's introduction to the chapter "Experiencing Psychiatric Rehabilitation" makes a point that fits the whole book.  "Psychiatric rehabilitation," she says, "is not something that is delivered to an individual, but rather it is accomplished through the individual's active participation in a process that includes choice and decision-making."  Knowing what the options are is essential if we are to help our family members or ourselves lead better lives.  This book goes a long way toward showing how that is possible.
<P>
	Readings in Psychiatric Rehabilitation, edited by William Anthony and LeRoy Spaniol, covers much of the same ground as An Introduction to Psychiatric Rehabilitation.  Both books draw heavily from the Journal of Psychiatric Rehabilitation, which is published jointly by the Center for Psychiatric Rehabilitation and IAPSRS.  The chief difference is that, though not inaccessible to the general reader, Readings is designed primarily for the social work student or professional who is interested in rehabilitation.  Essays are grouped in eight chapters:  "An Introduction to the Field"; "Introduction to Research"; "Philosophy, Process, and Technology"; "Implementing the Psychiatric Rehabilitation Approach"; " "Psychiatric Rehabilitation Personnel"; "Psychiatric Rehabilitation Programs"; "Psychiatric Rehabilitation Systems"; and a final chapter called "Changing Toward the Future," which includes two essays on managed health care and an essay by Anthony, "The Guiding Vision of the Mental Health Service System in the 1990s."  Each chapter includes its own rather full list of bibliographical references for further readings.
<P>
	This is a book to recommend--particularly to professionals--but IAPSRS's book, An Introduction to Psychiatric Rehabilitation, is of broader interest for the general reader.

An Unquiet Mind:  A Memoir of Moods and Madness
<P>
by Kay Redfield Jamison
<P>
Reviewed by Diane T. Marsh, Barbara Pilvin, and Judith Tydings, for the NAMI Literature Committee.
	<P>
	In An Unquiet Mind, psychologist Kay Redfield Jamison has written an extraordinary account of her experience with manic-depression (the term she prefers to bipolar disorder).  For more than three decades, Dr. Jamison has lived with this "quicksilver" illness, with its mercurial moods, and with its "peculiar kind of pain, elation, loneliness, and terror."  No reader will be untouched by her memoir, which is inarguably one of the most powerful, insightful, and eloquent depictions of life with this illness.
<P>
	Dr. Jamison is professor of psychiatry at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and coauthor of the standard medical text on manic-depressive illness.  Thus, it is with fascination that we read of her struggle against lithium, the drug that would ultimately save her life.  She writes about her belief that she should handle her illness without "crutches" such as medication and about the severe side effects she experienced.  Dr. Jamison also shares her deep resistance to relinquishing the exhilarating highs of the illness--"the intensity, glory, and absolute assuredness of my mind's flight"--for a life that seemed restrictive, less productive, and "maddeningly less intoxicating."  Ultimately, she made peace with lithium only when it was clear that the alternatives were death or insanity.
<P>
	The book also offers a compelling description of her recovery process.  She acknowledges the value of medication, of psychotherapy, and of the many people in her personal and professional lives who have provided essential--indeed, lifesaving--support.  Readers will also witness her personal resilience in a struggle that took her to the "blackest caves of the mind."  In her words, "One of the advantages of having had manic-depressive illness for more than thirty years is that very little seems insurmountably difficult."
<P>
	The book's arrangement is essentially chronological, beginning with Dr. Jamison's childhood and adolescence.  She describes the emergence of the disorder, its relentless course, and its increasing hold on her life.  She details her severest symptoms of depression and mania, her visual hallucinations, and her deliberate--and nearly fatal--lithium overdose.  From the dual perspectives of patient and professional, she places these experiences in the context of her own life and of the larger professional territory.  There are also some wonderful philosophical and humorous passages.
<P>
	Given Dr. Jamison's multiple roles as a consumer, professional, and family member, as well as her gifts as a writer, this book is likely to appeal to the widest possible audience.  At the same time, readers may respond differently to a number of themes in the book, as did NAMI reviewers.  The three reviewers agreed on the overall value and importance of the book.  They responded differently, however, to Dr. Jamison's discussion of the positive aspects of this disorder, including the relationship between bipolar disorder and creativity, which was explored in Jamison's earlier book, Touched With Fire.  One reviewer, a psychologist, family member, and painter, felt that the emphasis on the creativity and contributions of people with bipolar disorder offers a valuable corrective to the widespread tendency to define people in terms of their illness and to ignore their strengths, talents, and potential for recovery.
<P>
	On the other hand, a second reviewer, who has bipolar disorder herself, remarked on the level of courage required to write such a personal memoir, but reacted negatively to Dr. Jamison's mention of the positive aspects of this disorder--as if she were trying to convince herself (and her readers) that it is truly worth having.  The third reviewer, who has a brother with bipolar disorder, pointed out that Dr. Jamison has been very fortunate in spite of her illness, as the author herself acknowledged when addressing the NAMI convention last summer.  Through her writing and television productions, she focuses on the giftedness of painters, musicians, and others like herself who enrich our lives despite their illness.  This reviewer was concerned that the emphasis on giftedness would deflect attention away from those who are not particularly gifted and, in fact, are ravaged by this illness.
<P>
	 An Unquiet Mind will remain with you long after you have put it down.  Far more than a memoir of moods and madness, the book is also a journey into the heart of our humanity through the lens of this volatile illness.  Dr. Jamison has charted this journey with grace, candor, and humor.  Hers is an important and moving story, told by a distinguished scientist who has a poet's sensibility.

Review of General Psychiatry, 4th Edition
<P>
Edited by Howard H. Goldman, M.D., M.P.H., Ph.D.
<P>
Review by David Seaman for the NAMI Literature Committee
<P>
	Most of the 58 contributing authors of this psychiatric textbook practice and teach psychiatry at leading medical centers around the country; some are in private practice.  The chapter on psychiatric diagnosis, by Dr. Goldman, includes a glossary of psychiatric signs and symptoms that lay readers will find particularly helpful.  The book incorporates the complete diagnostic criteria as listed in the DSM-VI, which makes it especially useful for diagnosis and classification of the various disorders.  While written for medical students, most of the book's content is readily accessible to the informed lay person.  Review of General Psychiatry, 4th Edition would be an excellent reference for AMI affiliates, and it should also be available in public libraries. 
<P>
	Review of General Psychiatry, 4th Edition is published by Appleton and Lange (1995).  It is available at bookstores.  $32.95.

A Pragmatic Approach to Psychiatric Rehabilitation:  Lessons from Chicago's Thresholds Program
<P>
Edited by Jerry Dincin, Ph. D.
<P>
Review by Charles P. Cotton, C.C.S.W.; Richard Greer, and Victoria Conn, R.N. for the NAMI Literature Committee
<P>
	A Pragmatic Approach to Psychiatric Rehabilitation:  Lessons from Chicago's Thresholds Program provides a readable and comprehensive overview of psychiatric rehabilitation.  Jerry Dincin, who edits this volume, uses his extensive experience as director of Chicago's Thresholds Program to provide practical examples of rehabilitation approaches.  The contributors, also, are all people who have hands-on experience and important roles in this organization.
<P>
	Dincin believes that there are three basic components in psychiatric rehabilitation:  The biological basis of mental illness and the importance of medication, the rehabilitation relationship between staff and consumers, and the rehabilitation program efforts.  The central importance of accepting a biological understanding of mental illness is clearly expressed.  There is an excellent presentation of the staff/consumer relationship as the "glue of rehabilitation."  Clear descriptions of the specific services that make up the comprehensive Thresholds program are included.
<P>
	Readers will also learn about other programs for special populations, which include consumers with coexisting issues such as substance abuse, homelessness, motherhood--any populations such as the deaf and the elderly.  Included in Dincin's book is an interesting presentation of research results supporting the effectiveness of the Thresholds' services and a brief discussion of emerging issues in the filed of psychiatric rehabilitation.
<P>
		A Pragmatic Approach to Psychiatric Rehabilitation:  Lessons from Chicago's Thresholds Program is excellent.  It illustrates not only what psychiatric rehabilitation approaches can provide, but also why they are so important in the lives of those with serious brain disorders.  It is a valuable resource for anyone who deals with mental illnesses--consumer, family member, or professional.  And the subject is timely, given the current uncertainty surrounding the future of community mental health in our country.

Media Madness:  Public Images of Mental Illness
<P>
By Otto F. Wahl, Ph.D.
<P>
Reviewed by William Zaccagnino, Rupert B. Hurley, and Jim Howe for the NAMI Literature Committee
<P>
	Media Madness:  Public Images of Mental Illness is an outstanding book.  While the subject of the treatment in the media of those with brain disorders may at first seem to beg the question of "Isn't this just another case of political correctness?" the rampant inaccuracies about mental illnesses in newspapers, magazines, movies, and books makes it clear that this is not merely stereotyping, but rather a pervasive ignorance.  
<P>
	Dr. Wahl's book goes far to explain where the errors are and to educate and sensitize the reader to the frequent inaccuracies.  In addition, this book is very readable.  It is well researched and it isn't patronizing or accusatory toward those who write the newspaper stories and novels, script the movies, draw the cartoons, or create the advertisements that are built on the inaccuracies that so frequently are the public's body of knowledge about mental illness. It's possible some readers might feel the author is too kind, considering the number of inaccuracies in the media.
<P>
	Dr. Wahl gives his readers many mainstream references in his text and illustrations:  The Far Side, Kudzu, Silence of the Lambs, Psycho, Friday the 13th (and its many iterations), Rozanne, M*A*S*H, and many more that indicate the common belief that mental illnesses are fair game for humor, an excuse for murderous behavior, and an explanation for diminished intelligence.  The danger in all of this, of course, is that the media provides the base of knowledge for children and reinforces the beliefs of others who have long been exposed to such erroneous references.  Of equal or even greater danger is the plethora of inaccuracies present in the print and electronic news media.  Here the reader/viewer expects that the information is not altered as a means of entertainment, but reported objectively.  If the information reconfirms established beliefs, unfortunately the reader/viewer easily assumes that these inaccuracies are facts.
<P>
	Dr. Wahl shows that those with mental illnesses are frequently presented as their illness:  they are schizophrenics, manic depressives, or multiple personalities rather than persons with an illness or disorder.  Wahl points out that similar characterization is not applied to those with cancer, diabetes, and other physical illnesses.  And any psychiatric treatment in a person's past is deemed relevant to any story, regardless of whether or not it is relevant to the point of the story--especially when violence is involved.
<P>
	In addition to the excellent text and illustrations, Dr. Wahl includes extensive notes representing his thorough research.  He has included three appendices listing movies, television shows, and books that have mental illness or psychiatric references, many of which are inaccurate and disparaging.
<P>
	Media Madness is recommended highly.  It can easily serve as one of the references for NAMI's current anti-stigmatism campaign.  And it is "must reading" for every journalism student, active journalist, writer, screenwriter, marketing student, and ad copy writer and artist.  Consumers, family members, and other interested parties would also learn much from reading the book.

<P>

	And Media Madness is also a call to action.  Wahl assures his readers that one voice, one letter, one call can actually make the media change its path.  He maintains that most media people don't intend to offend or mislead their audience and that helpful, correcting information in many cases will be welcomed.
