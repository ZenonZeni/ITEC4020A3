Shift in Investment Structure Concerns Oil Prospectors
</font><hr>

Production Sharing Contracts (PSCs) have provided the most common vehicle for foreign participation in the oil and gas industries in Vietnam.<p>

Recently, according to some in the industry, the government has encouraged PetroVietnam to form joint venture companies (JVCs) with foreign oil operators instead of PSCs, to increase PetroVietnam's managerial role and to "raise PetroVietnam's status," according to one source.<p>

The  switch to JVCs would be the "last thing that foreign oil companies would want," one source told the VBJ.<p>

Nigel Russell, an attorney with Phillips Fox in Hanoi, explains three central reasons why foreign oil companies, as well as some other investors, prefer PSCs, or other forms of Business Cooperation Contracts (BCCs), over joint venture companies, from both a commercial and a legal perspective.<p><br>

<blockquote><b>PSCs the Industry Standard --</b> PSCs and other forms of unincorporated arrangements are recognized internationally as the standard, and most appropriate, means of investing in the oil and gas sector.<p>

Foreign oil and gas companies have come to feel reasonably comfortable with the PSC arrangement. So much so, it seems, that they are wary of investing through a JVC as an alternative. This is despite the fact that the legal framework governing the status and operation of PSCs (like all BCCs Vietnam) is not entirely clear, while the framework for JVCs is relatively well understood.<p>

<b>PSCs Avoid Double Taxation --</b> There can be considerable international tax savings resulting from a PSC because double taxation is not incurred, as it can be when investing in a separate legal entity such as a JVC.<p>

While the parties to PSCs pay similar taxes to those payable by JVCs, the net result for a foreign oil company investing through a JVC is that more tax is paid than if it can invest through a PSC arrangement.<p>

This can have a profound effect on the feasibility of investments in the oil and gas industry (as can the additional administrative cost of establishing and operating a separate legal entity), which are commonly high risk and capital intensive to begin with.<p>

<b>Management Control --</b> The PSC arrangement provides considerably greater management flexibility than a JVC.<p>

This is important to foreign oil and gas companies, which often need to make major decisions involving high expenditures both quickly and easily.<p>

Under Vietnam's foreign investment laws, a JVC must be managed in accordance with several, quite strict, requirements. The parties to the JVC must appoint members to a Board of Management in accordance with their respective contributions to the prescribed capital of the JVC. A unanimous vote of the Board is required in a number of matters, including the JVC's production and business plan and the removal of the General Director.<p>

The management of a PSC is not subject to any of these restrictions.<p></blockquote>
