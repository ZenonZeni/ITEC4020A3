<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">EDD Report 352.  1996.  Wages,

Benefits, Contributions, and Employment by Industry.  August 23.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">This annual report presents administrative

data that employers provide to EDD when they pay their Unemployment

Insurance taxes.  These data show that crop and agricultural service

employers pay only about half as much in UI taxes as unemployed

workers draw in benefits.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">In calendar year 1995, 934,000

reporting units paid $309 billion in wages to an average 10.2

million employees.  Employers pay UI taxes on the first $7,000

of annual wages for an employee, so taxable wages of $83 billion

are only 27 percent of total wages paid in 1995.  Unemployed workers

received $3 billion in UI benefits in 1995.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">Some of the most interesting data

are those for individual industries.  The 38,000 agricultural

reporting units paid $6.8 billion to an average 464,000 covered

employees, or an average $14,700.  Agricultural employers contributed

$164 million in UI taxes, but unemployed workers received almost

twice as much in UI benefits, $304 million.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">The report provides data by two,

three, and selected four-digit SIC codes.  The 17,600 crop reporting

units paid $3 billion in total wages to an average 197,0000 covered

employees, and unemployed crop workers drew $156 million, twice

crop employer contributions of $78 million.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">The 4,300 livestock reporting

units paid $468 million in total wages to an average an average

25,000 covered employees, and unemployed livestock workers drew

$5 million, less than livestock employer contributions of $7 million.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">The 15,000 agricultural service

reporting units paid $3.2 billion in total wages to an average

an average 238,0000 covered employees, and unemployed agricultural

service workers drew $140 million, almost twice agricultural service

employer contributions of $78 million.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">The only three-digit information

published is for 1,426 farm labor contractors and farm management

services, SIC 076.  They paid $958 million in total wages to an

average 112,000 covered employees; unemployed workers drew $73

million, or twice employer contributions of $36 million.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">EDD publishes four-digit SIC information

for 1,060 farm labor contractor reporting units in 1995.  They

paid $788 million in total wages to an average 102,000 covered

employees, or an average $6,600 per covered job; unemployed workers

drew $66 million, or twice employer contributions of $32 million.</FONT></TT>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">Barger, W. K. and Ernesto M. Reza.

 1994.  The Farm Labor Movement in the Midwest.  Austin:  University

of Texas Press.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">This seven chapter book is the

story of Baldemar Velasquez and the Farm Labor Organizing Committee,

a union based in Toledo, Ohio that represented about 4,000 seasonal

farm workers employed on 100 Ohio and Michigan farms in 1991.

 The authors are ex-FLOC organizers who stress how FLOC developed

its winning strategy:  enlist churches, unions and other groups

to boycott food companies Campbells and Heinz.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">In 1994-95, FLOC reported that

it represented 90 percent of the workers in the pickling cucumber

industry in Ohio.  However, they report that there are 60,000

migrant workers in Ohio, Indiana, and Michigan, which would suggest

that FLOC represents fewer than 10 percent of area migrants.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">Campbells and Heinz bought tomatoes

and cucumbers from farmers, and FLOC was able to persuade Campbells

in 1986-87, and Heinz in 1987, to sign three-way agreements between

themselves, the growers who actually employed FLOC farm workers

and FLOC.  A chronology of FLOC activities is provided on pages

52-53 of the book.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">The strength of the book is its

insider's account of how FLOC persevered in its struggle for recognition

by the nonfarm food companies that had the ability to pay the

higher wages that FLOC wanted.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">The book is much less clear about

the desirability and usefulness of the FLOC method of using guilt

about poor farm workers to pressure food companies to improve

their wages.  In the FLOC case, Ohio and Michigan production is

a very small part of the total amount of cucumbers and tomatoes

each company buys; would the same strategy have worked in California,

where most of these commodities are produced?</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">FLOC endorsed a merger with the

UFW in 1985, but in July 1994, became a local union directly affiliated

with the AFL-CIO.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">The book does not deal with FLOC's

adaptation to the end of sharecropping in 1993.  Until 1993, many

FLOC members were share croppers who received as payment for picking

cucumbers 50 percent of the revenues they fetched when the cucumbers

were delivered to the processor.  As share croppers, they could

legally employ their children during the six to eight week harvest,

enabling a family to sometimes earn $1,000 or more weekly.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">Valle, Isabel.  1994.  Fields

of Toil: A Migrant Family's Journey.  Pullman, Washington: Washington

State University.  </FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">This book is a newspaper reporter's

account of one year with a migrant worker family, 1991-92, based

in south Texas that every year follows the ripening crops to Washington

and Oregon.  The year-in-the-life project was sponsored by the

Walla Walla Union-Bulletin--according to one estimate, there were

7,500 migrant workers in Walla Walla county in the early 1990s.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">The first thing to note is that

the Martinez family is very unusual.  Due to a shortage of inexpensive

housing for short term migrants, there are few follow-the-crop

migrant workers, except in the northern states where workers are

needed for less than three months.  Patriarch Raul was also unusual

because he was 61 in 1991-92, far older than the typical migrant

worker--the book repeats the canard on page 57 that the average

life expectancy of a migrant farm worker is 48.  </FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">Finally, few extended families

make the migrant trek in the 1990s; the typical migrant farm worker

is a 25- to 35- year old man who shuttles into the US from Mexico,

and then works in a crew of 20 to 30 men which has jobs, and often

housing and transportation, arranged for them by an intermediary

such as a farm labor contractor.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">The Martinez family had 13 children.

 The family is also unusual in its ability to tap virtually every

program sponsored by the state and federal governments to assist

migrant and seasonal farm workers.  From Migrant Education to

Migration Health to Migrant Head Start to the job training program

that provides a summer job to the 15-year old son as a recreational

aide, the family seems to be familiar with many of the 15 federal

programs that assist farm workers at an annual cost of over $600

million.  </FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">Summaries of these programs are

presented in various chapters, but there is no sense of evaluation.

 For example, many of the children in the lower Rio Grande Valley

are enrolled in Migrant Education programs, but Fields of Toil

gives little sense of whether these supplemental federal funds

are being spent wisely.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">The strength of Fields of Toil

is its portrayal of manual labor for a country in which most people

provide services from office settings.  Most of the 18 chapters

are short, as befits the newspaper columns as they originally

appeared.  The family goes from crises to crisis, looking for

work where there are already too many workers, dealing with good

and bad employers, and always worrying that something may push

them further into poverty.</FONT></TT>
