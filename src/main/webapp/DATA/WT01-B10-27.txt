Pollution causes female snails to become male</h2>

VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) <b>Female snailshave been turning into males</b>, in certain polluted coastal harbors of British Columbia  a researcher says.  Snails undergoing the change, which some scientists think is caused by tin-based contaminants in the water, have been found by University of Victoria biologist Derek Ellis and his colleagues. <p>
The females have been turning into males in harbors and marinas throughout the Strait  Juan de Fuca, Ellis said. <p>
"Most of the harbors on the west coast of Vancouver Island... show the same effect," he said. <p>
'So we know that the whole of the southern B.C. coast is affected, or was when we looked." <p>
Ellis said the phenomenon called imposex has affected almost all species of carnivorous snails. In some species <i>not only do the females grow a penis, but the ovaries turn into testicles.</i> In others, females that retain their ovaries are prevented from releasing eggs by the growth of a penis. <p>
The animals die out because they cannot breed said Ellis, who has studied imposex in snails at several polluted locations around the world. <p>
Ellis found females with penises in 49 of the 50 locations examined.<p> 
Ellis and environmental authorities suspect tributyltin (IBT), a potent compound once widely used in boat paint and at salmon farrns, is responsible, although not enough research has been done to confirm their theory. <p>
Canada brought in regulations to reduce the use of TBT in 1989. Paints containing TBT can now only be used on vessels more than 80 feet in length, on outboard motor shafts and aluminum boats. <p>
Ellis would like to find out if the regulations have had the desired effect of bringing the tin levels down and reducing the level of imposex in snails. A lack of ressearch dollars has prevented Ellis or environmental agencies on this coast from folIowing the fate of the snails. <p>
Environment Canada official, Lee Harding said money is scarce and monitoring of TBT and imposex in snails has not been a top priority. <p>
He will suggest TBT contamination be investigated and imposex in the snail population get more attention. 
"From an ecological point of view, to have the gastrpods (snail) population diminishing could be quite profound," be said, adding that at this stage it is not even clear how long it will lake for the snail population or the enviromnent to recover from pollution. <p>
Researcher Carol Stewart, who is involved in a study of tin compounds at the federal Insititute of Ocean Sciences, said she is just as concerned about the invisible effects of pollution. <p>
"The masculinization of snails is some-thing that you can see. What about the things you can't see?" asked Stewart, who suspects micro-organisms might also be affected and that patterns of predation might be altered. <p>
"One of the scary things to me is that the effects occur in snails at levels that we as chemists can't even measure."<p><hr>
