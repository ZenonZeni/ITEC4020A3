</CENTER></H3><BR></B> 



The FY 1997 Labor, HHS, and Education appropriations bill (H.R. 3755) was not taken by
the Senate subcommittee before Congress recessed early last month.  Now that Congress is
back in session through the beginning of October, the Senate will hopefully mark up the bill
relatively quickly.  However, because there are several funding bills that are still not ready for
President Clinton's signature -- including the Labor, HHS bill -- it seems very likely that an
overall continuing resolution (CR) will be passed to keep these programs funded through
October 1, which is the beginning of the next fiscal year. The passage of a CR would trigger
release of the $1.3 billion that Senator Trent Lott set aside for such an occurrence. Once the
$1.3 billion is released, it is possible that some of this could be added to the Labor, HHS bill. 
Stay tuned!   <P>

<b>IDEA Reauthorization:</b><p>

As you know, the House has passed its reauthorization bill (H.R. 3268), while the Senate's
bill (S. 1578) has not yet been brought to the floor.  With only a few weeks left to complete
the reauthorization process before Congress recesses for the year, something drastic needs to
happen in order for both houses to agree on common legislation that would also be acceptable
to President Clinton.  Should the Senate overcome its current deadlock and pass a bill, it
would need to conferenced with the House's version (the two are quite different in several
areas), and both houses would then need to pass the compromise bill. The Senate bill is
currently stuck due to controversy surrounding several issues: funding, attorneys' fees, and
discipline (see earlier updates for more information). <P>

It is possible for this process to be completed before Congress adjourns in early October, but
the time frame is exceedingly tight.  Realistically, the Senate bill will probably need to be
acted upon during this first week of September in order for the process to be completed in
time.     <P>

A relatively uncontentious conference committee could somewhat accelerate and ease the
reauthorization process.  Throughout the August congressional recess, House and Senate staff,
along with CEC and other groups, have attempted to develop a package that would be suitable
to both houses of Congress.  If a compromise bill can be agreed upon, the House and Senate
could then concurrently pass this bill, thereby replacing their current proposals.  CEC will
continue to closely monitor and participate in the ongoing process, and we'll provide updates
as they develop. <P>
