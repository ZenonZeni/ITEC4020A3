<h3>  Background </h3>
This project, which arose as part of my Ph.D. work, has been a research
focus since joining the University of Toronto in October 1986.
<h3> Synopsis </h3>
Polymer ultrafiltration is used in a number of industrial and biomedical
applications.  The efficiency of the filtration process is almost always
limited by the formation of a resistive layer of rejected polymer
molecules upstream of the filter (the so-called "polarized layer").
We are using a novel optical system (designed and constructed over the
last several years) to directly measure the polymer concentration within this
layer, and to thus related layer structure to hyrodynamic resistance.
We have used this system to determine physiochemical properties of
polymers and study factors influencing polarized layer formation.  Ultimately
we hope to use the system to rationally test different strategies for
reducing polarized layer resistance, thus improving filtration efficiency.<p>
