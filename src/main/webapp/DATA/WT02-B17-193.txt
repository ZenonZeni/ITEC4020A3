In light of the current market conditions (i.e., low natural gas
prices, utility deregulation, etc.), biomass cofiring projects
are the best opportunity for near-term growth in biomass utilization
for power generation.  Despite biomass being a very different
fuel in many respects, it is a logical choice for cofiring in
a natural gas combined cycle system for several reasons.  The
combined cycle process configuration optimizes heat recovery from
each stream for maximum power generation making it a very efficient
cycle.  Also, electricity generation from natural gas is expected
to increase significantly between 1995 and 2010.  This growth
in natural gas is expected to result in increased construction
of combined cycle systems due to continued interest by industry
in gas turbine combined cycle technology.  In addition to its
potential environmental benefits, biomass may, in select cases,
offer fuel flexibility or a supplemental low-cost fuel for use
in a gas turbine combined cycle system.  When integrating biomass
into a natural gas system, it is important to design the system
to produce the most economical processing scheme.  This is true
for all power generating applications including repowering or
retrofitting of an existing plant, or construction of a new plant.
 It is also important to design a system that will be cost competitive
for both natural gas and biomass.  The effects of system modifications
and changes in operating parameters on the overall system performance
should be examined on a case by case basis.  This includes a comparison
of design and off design performance for part load operation.
 A discussion and an evaluation of systems employing three biomass
technology categories: biomass combustors, biomass boilers, and
biomass gasifiers is presented.  Several conceptual power plant
configurations were developed that integrate these technologies
with natural gas-fired gas turbines.  Advantages, disadvantages,
and applications for each biomass/natural gas combined cycle system
are also presented.

<A NAME="intro"><H3>INTRODUCTION</H3></A>
This paper addresses several ways to utilize biomass in a cofiring
scenario with a gas turbine combined cycle system that uses natural
gas as the primary fuel to generate power.  This unique concept
of a biomass/natural gas combined cycle system has not been examined
extensively like the notion of cofiring biomass and coal in existing
coal boilers.<A HREF="#1"><sup>1</sup></A>,<A HREF="#2"><sup>2</sup></A>  Several conceptual power plant configurations
have been developed that integrate biomass technologies in the
form of combustors, boilers, and gasifiers with natural gas-fired
gas turbines.
<P>
Despite biomass being a very different fuel in many respects,
it is a logical choice for cofiring in a natural gas combined
cycle system for many reasons.  Electricity generation from natural
gas is expected to increase by over 60% between 1993 and 2010.<A HREF="#3"><sup>3</sup></A>
The expected increase is in combustion turbines and combined
cycle plants.  Natural gas is attractive because it is a cleaner
burning fuel than coal or oil and currently has a relatively low
price.  Gas fired units have a lower initial capital cost and
a shorter construction time than other electricity generating
systems.  Developmental trends have concentrated on increased
efficiency and power output from gas turbines which has added
to the increased interest in combined cycle plants.
<P>
Before building new power plants, utilities are expected to optimize
current operating plants.  Repowering is one way of improving
the efficiency of an existing plant as well as extending the plant's
life.  Combined cycle repowering has the advantage of using existing
sites, steam turbines, instrumentation, and other plant equipment
thus reducing the cost of construction for a more efficient power
generating facility.  Retrofitting existing power plants is probably
the first step for utilizing biomass in an integrated gas turbine
combined cycle system.   A detailed site specific analysis for
any of the biomass/natural gas coprocessing schemes presented
in this paper should be performed to determine the economics at
a given site because each electricity generating system has unique
considerations.
<P>
<A NAME="bio"><H3>BIOMASS TECHNOLOGIES</H3></A>
The biomass systems utilized in this study can be divided into
three technology categories: combustors, boilers, and gasifiers.
 The combustion of biomass is a proven technology with technological
improvements resulting in cleaner combustion and improved efficiency
through operating enhancements such as staged combustion.  Biomass
combustors are currently available from equipment vendors for
the combustion of liquids, sludges, and solids.  Biomass applications
have ranged from timber products including hog fuel, sawdust,
bark, branches, and wood chips to agricultural wastes consisting
of seeds, hulls, and stalks.  Industry has concentrated on using
biomass combustors for converting waste streams into a usable
energy source.  Producing electricity through the use of biomass
boilers is a well-proven technology.  Both bubbling and circulating
fluidized bed boilers have been used for biomass fuel service.
 More than 170 fluidized bed boilers have burned alternate fuels
such as municipal, commercial, agricultural, and industrial waste
residues as of 1992.<A HREF="#4"><sup>4</sup></A>  Biomass boilers have been used for many
energy intensive processes in the pulp and paper industry and
in the food processing industry.  In these applications, biomass
boilers are used to satisfy energy requirements by producing steam
from waste products.  Often part of the steam is used directly
in the process and the remainder is used to cogenerate electricity.
 Biomass gasification is a generally less developed technology
than biomass combustors or boilers.  However, several types of
biomass gasifiers have been developed over the years including:
updraft, downdraft, bubbling fluid bed, circulating fluid bed,
and entrained flow.  Gasifier operating pressures have varied
from atmospheric to 2.4 MPa (350 psia) with typical operating
temperatures in the range of 760 &#176;C to 982 &#176;C (1400
&#176;F - 1800 &#176;F).  Work has begun to scale up several gasifier
types worldwide.
<P>
<A NAME="proc"><H3>PROCESS DESCRIPTIONS</H3></A>
Eleven process configurations were developed to integrate biomass
fuel into a gas turbine combined cycle system.  These diagrams,
shown in Figures 2-10, represent a handful of the processing schemes
that could be developed for biomass/natural gas combined cycle
systems.  The biomass systems employed can be divided into the
three technology categories discussed above: combustors, boilers,
and gasifiers.  The following subsections present the various
processing schemes for each category.
<P>
<H3>Base Case</H3>
The base case, shown in Figure 1, for evaluating each biomass
cofiring scenarios is a natural gas-fired gas turbine combined
cycle system consisting of a gas turbine, a heat recovery steam
generator (HRSG), and a steam turbine.  A combined cycle was chosen
as the base case because this process optimizes the heat recovery
of each stream for maximum power generation making it a very efficient
and commonly used cycle.  Combined cycles can reach net electrical
efficiencies of 45 - 55% (LHV).  It is also anticipated that continued
interest in gas turbine combined cycle technology will result
in increased construction of these systems worldwide.  All of
the biomass/natural gas coprocessing schemes are a modification
of this base case design.  In Figures 2-10 the base case combined
cycle system is shown with solid lines and the biomass systems
are depicted with dashed lines.
<P>
<H3>Utilizing Biomass Combustion</H3>
Two processing concepts were developed for utilizing a biomass
combustor with a natural gas combined cycle system.  The first
schematic is depicted in Figure 2, in which air is utilized for
biomass combustion followed by an optional quench step, and a
cyclone for ash removal.  The quench step is only required for
high alkali containing biomass feedstocks.  In this case the gas
stream would be cooled to about 538 &#176;C (1000 &#176;F) by
injecting water directly into the stream.  This promotes condensation
of the alkali allowing them to be removed with the ash particles
in the downstream cyclone.  Figure 3 shows a second combustor-based
schematic and differs from the first by utilizing the turbine
exhaust gas as the oxygen source for combustion.  The turbine
exhaust gas is hot (ca. 538 &#176;C or 1000 &#176;F) and typically
contains 13 - 15 vol% oxygen<A HREF="#5"><sup>5</sup></A> and therefore should be a good source
for combustion "air".  This process configuration requires
a low alkali biomass feedstock because quenching the entire hot
gas stream to the HRSG would result in a large decrease in thermal
efficiency.
<P>
<H3>Utilizing A Biomass Boiler</H3>
Two process arrangements for integrating a biomass boiler with
a gas turbine, HRSG, and steam turbine were developed.  The only
difference between the two boiler configurations is that the second
one uses process water to wash the contaminants from an herbaceous
feedstock.  This would be useful for crops such as switchgrass
or bagasse.  Both arrangements are shown in Figure 4  with a box
around the feed differences which are labeled as option 1 and
option 2.  The boiler in this figure includes associated equipment
such as dust collectors, electrostatic precipitators, baghouse
filters, or wet scrubbers to control emissions.  In the layout,
the boiler is integrated with the steam turbine of the combined
cycle system.
<P>
<H3>Utilizing Low Pressure Biomass Gasification</H3>
Figures 5-8 contain flow diagrams for utilizing low pressure gasification
with a gas turbine combined cycle system.  In Figures 5 and 6,
the biomass derived synthesis gas is combusted and sent to a duct
burner in the HRSG.  These two figures have the following biomass
processing steps in common:  drying, low pressure gasification,
hot gas clean up, and  combustion.  Drying is accomplished using
waste heat from the HRSG flue gas.  The hot gas clean-up portion
of the process includes a cyclone which removes most of the ash
and particulates, a tar cracker for converting heavy hydrocarbons
into lighter ones, and a set of ceramic candle filters for additional
particulate and alkali removal.  It is important to remove heavy
hydrocarbons and alkali species to very low levels to prevent
deposition and corrosion on downstream equipment.  The only difference
between the arrangements in Figures 5 and 6 is the gasification
oxygen source: Figure 5 uses air while Figure 6 uses hot turbine
exhaust gas.  Depending on the size of the biomass system and
if the gas turbine is at full load or part load, only a slipstream
of the turbine exhaust gas may be required for gasification. 
In that case part of the turbine exhaust gas may be bypassed around
the biomass system and sent directly to the HRSG.  The schematic
in Figure 5 shows two feedstock options just like the biomass
boiler schematic (Figure 4) to show how the biomass washing step
which facilitates the use of an herbaceous feedstock can be utilized
with gasification.
<P>
The low pressure gasification concepts shown in Figures 7 and
8 differ from those in Figures 5 and 6 in many ways because the
biomass derived synthesis gas is utilized as a turbine fuel instead
of directly in the HRSG.  In order to accommodate this different
processing concept, the syngas must go through the following additional
steps after hot gas clean-up:  cooling, quenching, and compressing.
 The hot gas clean-up step in Figures 7 and 8, is the same as
that described above for Figures 5 and 6 except that it does not
include a set of ceramic candle filters.  Since the gas must be
cooled before compression, this piece of equipment is not necessary.
 Instead the gas is cooled by heat exchangers to a point above
alkali condensation followed by additional cooling and alkali
removal with a conventional quench step.  Any alkali that is not
entrained in the ash coming out of the cyclone will be removed
with the waste water in the quench step.  The heat exchange is
used to recover some of the sensible heat in the gas stream as
well as to reduce the amount of quench water required.  The heat
exchange step can be used to raise the temperature of another
stream elsewhere in the process, if required, or to produce steam
that is sent to the HRSG resulting in the generation of additional
electricity or a combination of these two concepts may be employed.
 In Figure 7, the syngas is fed to a gas turbine in conjunction
with or instead of natural gas whereas in Figure 8, the syngas
and natural gas are each fed to separate gas turbines and then
the exhaust gas from both turbines is combined and sent to the
HRSG.
<P>
<H3>Utilizing High Pressure Biomass Gasification</H3>
Figures 9 and 10 contain high pressure gasification processing
schemes that are similar to the low pressure configurations illustrated
in Figures 7 and 8.  In all of these diagrams (Figures 7-10) the
concept that is employed involves using the biomass derived synthesis
gas as a turbine fuel.  However, for  the high pressure gasification
configurations (Figures 9 and 10) the synthesis gas exiting the
hot gas clean-up section can be fed directly to the gas turbine
combustor without any of the additional processing steps which
are required for the low pressure schematics.   The hot gas clean-up
for the high pressure configurations consists of a cyclone to
remove most of the particulates and ash, a tar cracker for converting
heavy hydrocarbons into lighter ones, and a set of ceramic candle
filters for additional particulate and alkali removal.
<P>
<A NAME="opp"><H3>OPPORTUNITIES FOR USE</H3></A>
Many applications exist for utilizing the biomass/natural gas
coprocessing schemes laid out above.  For example, any of the
configurations shown in Figures 2-10 can be used in repowering
an existing coal boiler, in increasing the output from an existing
power plant,  or in the construction of a new power plant.  Additional
applications which are not necessarily subsets of these three
options are described below.
<P>
The biomass boiler concepts illustrated in option 1 and 2 of Figure
4 can be used to retrofit an existing biomass boiler with a gas
turbine system.  The gasification concepts in Figures 8 and 10
as well as Figure 4 are applicable for utilizing natural gas as
a peaking fuel.  In these cases, the configurations will allow
the natural gas to be used during either a planned or an unplanned
peak in electricity demand.  This is useful for electric utilities
because they need some flexible power generating options for handling
daily load variations.  Using natural gas as a peaking fuel is
advantageous for the gasification concepts in Figures 8 and 10
because the capital intensive biomass gasification system can
be designed for average rather than maximum load thus reducing
the total capital cost.
<P>
Biomass may be used as a peaking fuel for planned peaks in any
of the biomass/natural gas coprocessing schematics shown in Figures
2-10.  However, only the configurations utilizing biomass in a
combustor or in a boiler (Figures 2-4) will be able to use biomass
as a peaking fuel during an unplanned increase in load.  These
technologies allow the equipment to be started up and brought
on-line more quickly than a biomass gasifier system.
<P>
<A NAME="adds"><H3>ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES</H3></A>
There are both advantages and disadvantages to integrating a biomass
system with a natural gas combined cycle system.  In some cases,
an advantage to one power production facility may be a disadvantage
to, or simply have no effect on, another facility.  Ultimately,
each individual operating plant (existing or new) would have to
evaluate the biomass/natural gas combined cycle scenarios according
to the needs and capabilities of the facility as well as the expected
fuel supply and cost structure in the area.  The following subsections
outline some of the advantages and disadvantages to consider when
examining the eleven biomass/natural gas power production coprocessing
configurations.
<P>
<H3>Utilizing Boiler Feed Water for Washing Biomass</H3>
When utilizing boiler feed water (BFW) for washing herbaceous
biomass as shown in option 2 of Figure 4 and option 2 of Figure
5, the resulting wash water contains valuable nutrients such as
nitrogen (N), and potassium (K).  These are two of the major nutrients
used in producing fertilizers for plant growth in the U.S.<A HREF="#6"><sup>6</sup></A>  Irrigating
crops with process wash water may be advantageous to the farmer
because this would reduce or perhaps eliminate fertilizer costs.
These costs include the purchase and application of the fertilizer.
 Depending on the region where the crop is grown and the type
of crop grown, different amounts of fertilizer are necessary to
obtain the required nutrients that are essential for plant growth.
<P>
<H3>Utilizing Turbine Exhaust Gas</H3>
<P>
Figures 3 and 6 containing biomass combustion and low pressure
gasification, respectively, utilize hot turbine exhaust gas as
the biomass combustion or gasification oxygen source.  This exhaust
gas is typically around 538 &#176;C (1000 &#176;F) requiring high
temperature valves for controlling the flow of the exhaust gas
to the combustor or gasifier unit and for bypassing flow around
the biomass system directly to the HRSG.  Problems may arise in
obtaining, controlling, and maintaining suitable high temperature
valves at a reasonable cost for this type of high temperature
application.  Because of the high turbine exhaust gas temperature,
process schemes using this gas (Figures 3 and 6) should minimize
the piping distance between the gas turbine and the biomass system
(combustor or gasifier).  If the layout of an existing natural
gas combined cycle plant poses space constraint problems, then
integration of the biomass system between the gas turbine and
the HRSG could create design problems as well as additional equipment
costs.  Problems that could arise would be associated with thermal
expansion and piping stresses while extra costs would include
additional piping and insulation as a minimum.  At such high temperatures
even a 4" diameter pipe will require several inches of insulation
to keep the gas hot.
<P>
A comparison of Figures 3 and 6 with Figures 2 and 5 shows several
positive aspects to using the turbine exhaust gas as the oxygen
source for combustion or gasification.  First, using the exhaust
gas eliminates the need for any additional equipment that is required
when using atmospheric air for a biomass gasifier or combustor
system.  The equipment required for an air system includes a blower
and a minimum of one heat exchanger.  Some electricity is required
to operate the blower resulting in a reduction in the overall
electrical output from the plant.  Furthermore, in order to warm
the air another stream in the process must be cooled simultaneously
resulting in a decrease in the overall system efficiency. Because
the turbine exhaust gas is very hot (typically 538 &#176;C) no
additional heating is required in the schematics of Figures 3
or 6 and this could result in a higher overall system efficiency
when compared to using air as in the concepts shown in Figures
2 and 5.  However, because of the additional equipment between
the gas turbine and the HRSG, these systems will experience an
efficiency loss of the gas turbine due to the higher pressure
required at the gas turbine outlet.  Therefore, the overall system
performance must be examined in detail to determine the net effect
of using air versus exhaust gas as the oxygen source for combustion
or gasification.
<P>
The turbine exhaust gas must have a sufficient amount of oxygen
to burn the biomass, otherwise a backup air system would be required.
 However, this will not be a problem as long as the system is
designed so that the oxygen in the turbine exhaust gas meets the
required lbs of O2/lb of biomass fed to the combustor or gasifier.
 Special consideration should be taken in evaluating the oxygen
requirements when operating at the maximum biomass feed rate and
in evaluating the oxygen availability when operating the gas turbine
at a reduced rate.  With a fully integrated system as shown in
Figures 3 and 6, the biomass portion can not operate without the
gas turbine unless there is a backup air system whereas in the
other schematics (Figures 2 and 5), the system can operate at
part load utilizing only the biomass portion of the system when
the gas turbine is down.
<P>
<H3>Feedstocks</H3>
Figure 2 involving a biomass combustor as well as all of the biomass
gasification configurations (Figures 5-10) have more feedstock
flexibility than the remaining three configurations shown in Figures
3 and 4 with respect to utilizing biomass containing high amounts
of alkali.  A quench step can be inserted before ash removal in
the biomass combustor system of Figure 2 whereas for the schematic
in Figure 3, quenching the entire hot gas stream to the HRSG would
result in a large decrease in thermal efficiency.  All of the
biomass gasifier systems have the ability to remove alkalis which
are present in the synthesis gas.  The high pressure biomass gasifier
systems in Figures 9 and 10 and the low pressure gasifier systems
in Figures 7 and 8 contain a hot gas clean up step to remove alkalis.
 Some alkali species will be entrained in the ash coming out of
a cyclone and the remainder will be removed using a set of ceramic
candle filters.  In the low pressure gasification systems shown
in Figures 7 and 8, some alkalis are removed with the ash in a
cyclone and the remainder is removed in the quench step.
<P>
In most cases, utilizing a biomass combustor or boiler as in Figures
2-4, does not require drying of the biomass eliminating the additional
costs associated with the dryer system.  However, the reduced
efficiency of the combustor or boiler must be taken into account
when performing the economics of the overall system.  Many combustors
or boilers can handle high moisture feedstocks with moisture contents
up to 65 wt%.<A HREF="#7"><sup>7</sup></A>  Whereas for a gasification system the biomass
must typically be dried to 10 - 15 wt% moisture for a direct gasifier
and 20 - 25 wt% for an indirect gasifier.   For any gasifier system,
drying the biomass will result in a higher overall thermal efficiency
and in more stable operation of the system.
<P>
Biomass is not an easy solid to feed because of its low density,
fibrous nature, and other properties.  Biomass feeder systems
are typically made up of lockhoppers and/or screw feeders.  Difficulties
with feeding biomass will depend on the type of biomass feedstock
as well as the operating pressure of the system.  It is anticipated
that there will be less difficulties with feeding biomass to a
low pressure system like a biomass combustor (Figures 2 and 3),
a biomass boiler (Figure 4), or a low pressure gasifier (Figures
5-8).  When the feedstock is batch fed through pressurization
and depressurization of a series of lockhoppers, the operating
costs of feeding biomass to a high pressure system (Figures 9
and 10) in terms of dollars and efficiency may also be considerably
higher due the increased inert gas requirement.
<P>
<H3>Retrofitting Existing Systems</H3>
The following discussion applies to Figures 2, 3, 5, and 6 which
utilize the combustion gas from a biomass combustor or gasifier
directly with a HRSG.  When retrofitting an existing natural gas
combined cycle system, if the gas from the biomass combustor or
gasifier system is not as clean as the exhaust gas from the gas
turbine then the HRSG will require additional equipment modifications
such as the addition of an induced draft (ID) fan or soot blower
to prevent particulates from building up on the tube walls.  Otherwise,
the HRSG will experience a reduction in the heat transfer coefficient
as well as a loss in heat transfer surface area which will ultimately
lead to less power generation from the steam turbine.  Higher
particulate loads will also result in more frequent down-time
for cleaning of the heat exchange surfaces in various parts of
the HRSG.  An excessive amount of particulates could also cause
emission problems.  However, for the biomass combustion illustrations
shown in Figures 2 and 3 this can be solved by putting a baghouse
filter on the stack before the flue gas is emitted to the atmosphere.
 Since flue gas is used to dry the biomass in the low pressure
gasification schemes (Figures 5 and 6), the baghouse filter on
the gas stream exiting the dryer should be designed to collect
any particulates that carry over from the HRSG.
<P>
In a combined cycle configuration, increasing the gas velocity
to a HRSG will result in higher pressure drops throughout the
gas side of the HRSG which in turn causes an increase in the back
pressure to the gas turbine.  Adding the biomass system shown
in the process configuration of Figures 2-3 (biomass combustion),
Figure 4 (biomass boilers), or Figures 5-10 (biomass gasification)
would result in an increase in gas flow to the existing HRSG which
may be above the design point.  Since pressure drop is proportional
to the gas velocity squared, a small increase in the gas velocity
will have a large effect on the HRSG pressure drop and the resultant
increase in the gas turbine outlet pressure will cause a decrease
in the gas turbine efficiency.  Depending on the operating parameters
of the overall system, there is probably an operating point where
a trade-off between higher turbine outlet pressure and lower turbine
efficiency results in a higher thermal efficiency of the overall
biomass/combined cycle system.
<P>
For the two different operating configurations in Figure 4, a
minimal amount of additional equipment and piping modifications
would be required to retrofit an existing biomass boiler system
thus resulting in a minimal additional cost for increased power
production.  As a minimum, it would be necessary to add a gas
turbine.  It may also be necessary to upgrade or make modifications
to the HRSG and steam turbine.  Since a gas turbine does not require
a lot of space, it would also be adaptable to space constraint
problems of an existing biomass boiler plant.
<P>
<H3>Gas Clean Up</H3>
In general, all of the biomass systems require some type of gas
clean-up which is not required for a natural gas combustion system.
 This includes clean-up for contaminants such as particulates,
ash, char, tar, and alkalis which are not found in a natural gas
system.  These contaminants can cause corrosion, erosion, and
deposition problems in downstream equipment resulting in reduced
performance and high maintenance costs.  Since tars are not produced
in biomass combustor or boiler systems, tar removal is not required
for the systems shown in Figures 2-4.  However, depending on the
feedstock and the type of gasifier utilized, tars of varying quantity
and quality can be produced from a gasifier system.  Therefore,
each gasifier configuration shown in Figures 5-10 requires tar
removal in the gas clean-up process whether the synthesis gas
is used as gas turbine fuel or used directly in the HRSG.  However,
the biomass combustor and boiler systems (Figures 2-4) have the
disadvantage of having the potential for more environmental problems
associated with incomplete combustion of the biomass compared
to the gasification systems (Figures 5-10).
<P>
<H3>Startup and Turndown</H3>
The biomass combustor and boiler systems (Figures 2-4) can be
started up rapidly compared to the low or high pressure biomass
gasification systems.  This is important when operating a power
plant which experiences frequent changes in load especially unplanned
load variations.  For fluctuating operations, it is also important
to determine the turndown capability of the biomass system.  Because
biomass gasifiers have not been operated at large scales, it is
not clear what the turndown capability of these systems will be.
<P>
<H3>System Complexity</H3>
The biomass combustor and gas clean up equipment in Figures 2
and 3 are very simplistic compared to a biomass boiler or gasification
system.  For any operating facility, as larger and/or more pieces
of equipment are added to a system more space and/or land is required.
 The gasification configurations, especially those in Figures
8 and 10), require a large amount of equipment which will not
only require more plant space but could result in higher capital
and operating costs.  Because gasification is not as well developed
as biomass combustors or boilers, there is also an increased risk
associated with the commercialization of the low or high pressure
gasification technology (Figures 5-10).
<P>
<H3>Low versus High Pressure Gasification</H3>
In Figures 7-10 the synthesis gas derived from biomass gasification
is used directly in a gas turbine.  When comparing low pressure
gasification (Figures 7 and 8) with high pressure gasification
(Figures 9 and 10), the low pressure systems require additional
cooling and compression.  This results in additional capital and
operating costs.  However,  when utilizing a low pressure indirect
gasifier these additional costs could be offset by reduced gasifier
costs.  In general,  indirect gasifier systems are estimated to
be less expensive than direct gasifier systems.  Because of the
indirect heating, the gasifier is sized to accommodate a smaller
gas flow thus resulting in a lower equipment cost that a direct
heated gasifier.
<P>
<A NAME="con"><H3>CONCLUSIONS</H3></A>
Examining the integration of biomass with a gas turbine combined
cycle system was chosen because this process optimizes the heat
recovery of each stream for maximum power generation making it
a very efficient cycle.  It is also anticipated that the low cost
of natural gas, the fact that it is a cleaner burning fuel than
coal or oil, and the incremental increases in efficiency and power
output from gas turbines will generate continued interest in gas
turbine combined cycle technology resulting in increased construction
of these systems.  The biomass systems examined were divided into
the following three technology categories: biomass combustors,
biomass boilers, and biomass gasifiers.  Eleven process configurations
were developed for cofiring biomass and natural gas in a gas turbine
combined cycle system.  Many opportunities exist for using these
biomass/natural gas systems such as repowering an existing coal
boiler, retrofitting an existing power plant, or constructing
a new power plant.  Many advantages and disadvantages can be found
when comparing the various biomass/natural gas coprocessing schemes.
 However, the advantages and disadvantages need to be examined
on an individual plant basis.  When integrating a biomass/natural
gas system, it is important to integrate all energy streams to
produce the most economical processing scheme.  It is also important
to design a system that will be cost competitive for both natural
gas and biomass.  The effect of operating parameters such as increased
turbine outlet pressure and part load operation on the overall
system performance should be examined on a case by case basis.
 For retrofit plants, a comparison must be made between the increase
in power generation versus the additional capital and operating
costs incurred.  Biomass cofiring projects such as the biomass/natural
gas systems laid out in this paper will be the best opportunity
for near-term growth in the area of biomass utilization.  Implementing
biomass gasification in this way will bring about technology acceptance
which will lead the way to larger scale biomass plants.  Overall,
the processing of biomass to electricity will depend on the cost
of the fuel, market conditions, the conversion technology used,
and the income generated by the power produced.
<P>
Work involving more detailed design, performance, and economic
analysis of the most promising systems has begun using GateCycle
software by Enter Software, Inc.  These detailed evaluations will
pay particular attention to the effects of operating parameters
such as part load performance and increased turbine outlet pressures
on the cost of electricity production.
