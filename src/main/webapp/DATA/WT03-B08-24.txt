COMING SOON TO YOUR FACTORY: WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS


The boom in wireless communications technology is soon going to hit the factory
floor, say analysts and those involved with the new systems. With the
unprecedented growth in consumer markets for cellular phones and such products
as wireless speaker systems, the technology for wireless data communications is
quickly maturing and coming down in price.

For companies supplying wireless equipment, the manufacturing market "is going
to be a very big deal," says Jack Killion of Wireless Publishing Inc.Others
are just as bullish.  "There is going to be a massive boom, driven by the
cellular phone market pushing down the costs of components and chips," says
Wayne Manges of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory's Centers for Manufacturing
Technology.  "This is a key technology for the 21st Century.  People who get
in early and stay with it will do extremely well."

Numerous companies are installing wireless networks in their factories.  "Our
customer list has become endless," says John Davis, Director of Industrial
Technology Marketing for Akron, Ohio-based Telxon, a publicly held company
(NASDAQ symbol TLXN).  Telxon expects to grow its wireless manufacturing group
by almost 30 percent this year.

"Our growth is out of sight," says Davis. "It's very profitable." With the
amount of growth that exists in the market "we're hiring people like crazy,"
Davis adds. "If you have a skill and you know this industry, we will hire you."
(Telxon supplies entire systems including handheld, pen-based, voice and vision
computers and real time data collection devices. Its revenues increased 28
percent from 1994 to 1995, from $271 million to $379 million.)

Ford Motor's Louisville, Ky., plant, a four-million square foot facility, has
installed a wireless data communications system. Boeing, Chrysler, GM, General
Electric, Miller Brewing, Northrop, Allied Signal, Intel, consumer packaged
goods companies, retail stores like Wal-Mart and others such as Disney and
American Express are installing systems for use in material management,
warehousing, quality control, monitoring and maintenance of machine tools and
in-building paging.

"The leading edge companies in every industry are the ones who are doing this,"
says Killion. "They're biting the bullet of higher costs because they recognize
the benefits are so good that they're just jumping on it."

Wireless manufacturing plants offer the opportunity for companies to retrofit
facilities without extensive engineering hassles. "You can never get the cable
right" in a manufacturing environment," says Manges of Oak Ridge. "There are
people who spend their whole life keeping the cable in order." Wiring in a
nuclear power plant, for instance, typically costs about $2,000 per foot. 

Wireless systems also allow companies to put real-time information in the hands
of empowered workers and they help in decision making. There are also benefits
associated with the speed and reliability of data and the ability to spot
problems earlier with fewer people. Farther down the line, wireless can help
improve customer service and lower inventories.

Analysts project the market for wireless automated data collection at $3.4
billion this year with a growth rate exceeding 20 percent per year.

But there are still a lot of technical issues that need to be resolved before
wireless systems become ubiquitous in manufacturing operations. Integrating
hundreds or thousands of data-generating sources into one seamless system is a
big challenge. Redundancy has to be built in the system.

"Because of the size of the problems and the amount of data [that is being
generated], wireless requires multidisciplinary people," says Manges.
"Theoreticians, mathematicians, communications experts, computer junkies" are
all needed to integrate sensors and data sources, all of which have their own
channel. "If all you've done is replace wire you haven't solved the problem,"
says Manges. "It's the non-architectural issues that are important: data
structuring, queuing theory, modeling. You have to start small and establish
standards as you build these systems." 

"Wireless is only now starting to be applied" in commercial enterprises, says
Killion. "It's a high priority for suppliers because there is so much
low-hanging fruit" in virtually every industrial sector.

201-285-1500; Manges can be reached at 423-574-8529.

LARGE MANUFACTURERS, SUPPLIERS JOIN ENERGY DEPARTMENT'S AGILE MANUFACTURING
PROGRAM


The Department of Energy's Technologies Enabling Agile Manufacturing (TEAM)
program, about a year old, is "beginning to put some flesh on the bones," says
program manager Diane Bird.

TEAM is beginning to do "practical and important things," says Aris
Melissaratos Vice President of Science, Technology and Quality at Westinghouse
Electric Corp.  "They've taken the concepts of agility and are bringing
technology to the shop floor...This is substantive work and brings agility to
the real world rather than it being theory and academics."

TEAM's team now includes about 35 companies, many of which are household
names, such as Cummins Engine, General Motors, AlliedSignal and numerous
others from a variety of industries.  Universities, R&D consortia and other
government agencies are engaged in the effort.

"We're not industry specific, nor are we terribly process specific," says Bird,
who works in DOE's Defense Program's Office of Economic Competitiveness. "We're
going to take the highest priority needs across a variety of industry sectors
and across a variety of processes that are in concert with our own [DOE] needs
and work with that group."

DOE has committed $5 million a year for three years to the TEAM effort.  Bird
estimates that another $5 million in federal funding is finding its way into
the program through other government programs.  Industry is devoting about $10
million a year in the effort, for a yearly total of about $20 million.
"Financially, things are getting tougher," says Bird.  "People are beginning
to see the benefit of dividing up the workload and sharing the results."

One of the primary themes of TEAM is the integration of various design
software tools with the equipment that makes parts and products.  Customers,
suppliers and vendors in virtually every manufacturing sector have different
CAD tools, NC tools and NC programming software.  "One of the big complaints
is that not much of this talks to each other," Bird explains.  "It's not a
simple task to make that happen and to make it happen without data loss or
glitches."

The Energy Department has been dealing with this problem for 15 years. Its
nuclear weapons production complex has purchased machine tool controllers and
has modified them for its own use. That labor intensive effort worked fine when
DOE had lots of money, but its budget is going down and the agency is becoming
more dependent on the private sector to pick up the slack. Moreover, many
commercial companies have the same problem of integrating different design and
manufacturing systems.

"In the past we've had to maintain our hardware and software ourself," says
Bird. "But that's expensive and inefficient and we'd like to go buy this stuff
off the shelf." By involving industry in helping suppliers produce open
architecture equipment and software, the entire supply base will be far more
robust. "A larger group of users in the commercial environment will help find
glitches, improve it, and drive additional revisions and upgrades much more
quickly than we could with our low production volume," says Bird.

There is no doubt that this would happen without the Energy Department's help.
But DOE is restricted to "Buy American" procurement provisions. Unfortunately,
many overseas suppliers have no desire to sell equipment that would be used to
manufacture nuclear bombs.

Overseas suppliers also tend to implement their latest generation systems on
their home turf. "It's much more difficult to have those relationships with
foreign countries and assure that you are indeed getting the newest
state-of-the-art equipment," says Bird.

The new tools would be developed without DOE assistance, but if U.S. industry
misses the market window, then U.S. companies may not be involved both in
supplying the manufacturing systems and utilizing them. And thus DOE's push.
"Sure it will happen anyway," says Bird. "But will it happen by developments by
U.S. companies and entities or will it happen overseas and then we will just be
purchasing all of this?"

Bird can be reached at 202-586-0499. For written information on TEAM (the
compilation of overhead slides from the Annual TEAM Meeting), contact Richard
Neal of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory's Centers for Manufacturing
Technologies at 615-574-1862.

AT 101 YEARS OLD, NAME WILL KEEP UP THE GOOD FIGHT


The National Association of Manufacturers has just completed its 100th year of
operation and the campaign it started planning four years ago to boost the
image of manufacturing in the U.S.  society will continue.

"The whole idea of the Manufacturing Campaign is that it would reach a peak in
1995, and that's true," says Ladd Biro, Vice President of Marketing and Member
Services at NAM and President of the organization's Manufacturing Institute.
But there is plenty of more work to do.

No other national group is tasked with promoting the importance of
manufacturing to the country.  When NAM president Jerry Jasinowski started
planning the campaign, few positive statements were being made about
manufacturing.  Layoffs, pollution and knuckle-headed management stories ruled
the day.  Manufacturers were on the defense.

But there are plenty of success stories that have since been written and the
Manufacturing Institute is doing its best to target members of Congress and the
media to pick up on them.

The campaign last year involved hundreds of people at the national, state and
local level. NAM sponsored 40 events in 25 states. It commissioned artwork and
posters by Peter Max. It wrote a manufacturing coffee table book. It promoted
manufacturing through a national media campaign. And it created a popular
manufacturing educational program for the nation's high schools that is now
being incorporated in a CD-ROM format.

The entire campaign consumed some $3 million and was funded by the nation's
largest manufacturing companies.  Intel, for instance, is underwriting an
$80,000 essay contest for high-school students.  The theme is the future of
manufacturing in America and the contest has drawn more than 2,300 entries.
Only about 750 were expected.

NAM expects the manufacturing campaign to consume between $1 million and $1.5
million this year. "I don't see us letting up on a publicity campaign," says
Biro, who joined NAM from American Airlines in 1992. "There is always going to
be a job to do." Much of the funding this year will come from grants.

The campaign has done a great deal to improve NAM's image as well. NAM is
extremely healthy, says Biro. Revenues have increased by 6 to 7 percent a year
for the past four years. "We're not trying to grow staff, but last year was a
record for membership growth," says the 34-year-old Biro. NAM now has 13,600
member companies.

A lot of that growth has to do with the improved fortunes of manufacturers and
the high profile of NAM president Jerry Jasinowski. But a great deal of it can
be attributed to  Biro and his staff's attention to improving services to
members and marketing NAM in a more aggressive manner. Others in the trade
association field are envious of the job NAM has done in this regard, and it is
often held up as a benchmark for how to improve member services and increase
membership.

Central to the marketing operation is a telemarketing sales force of 20, which
will be increased by three this year. Paid on a commission basis, these folks
call prospective members and those who are renewing their memberships. Biro
believes he can add 1,000 new members this year and he has a personal goal of
25,000 members. The average member pays around $500 a year in dues, but the
range is from $150 to $130,000 per year.

"Our image has changed," he says. NAM is no longer thought of as being a stodgy
place. The organization has improved its communications to members and has
started promoting its own accomplishments rather than taking a more modest
approach to its successes in Washington. Biro can be reached through NAM at
202-637-3000.

ARTHUR ANDERSEN'S VIEW INTO THE 1996 CRYSTAL BALL


One of the keys to success for manufacturers in 1996 will be "innovative
alliances," says Steven Hronec, worldwide director of Arthur Andersen's
manufacturing industry practice. While new approaches to improving operations
and reducing costs will be important, "manufacturers that want staying power
will continue to use...new alliances to compete," says Hronec.

Companies will need to team up with customers, suppliers and competitors and
the most successful firms will access customer and supplier information
through electronic data interchange and the Internet.  The most successful
global companies will move beyond the "country-to-country" management approach
and will use communications technologies to choose from global vendors and
suppliers, rather than being limited to local, regional or national resources.

Manufacturing Execution Systems and Enterprise Requirements Planning will
continue to gain in popularity during the year.  Companies that involve
employees in their strategic planning processes will succeed above and beyond
their rivals, says Hronec.

Savvy manufacturers will use "activity-based cost management" which will allow
them to restructure their operations to concentrate their resources on the
processes that are the most profitable and cost effective.  "We see
manufacturers either combining operations or splitting them up to enhance
their competitive advantage," says Hronec.  "Either way the result is
something different from what they were before."

Finally, the ISO9000 quality and ISO14000 environmental standards will continue
to be important. ISO14000 will "soon become a basic and necessary part of doing
business around the world," says Hronec, who can be reached at 213-614-8512.

LIMBERING UP IS A BEST PRACTICE AT SPRING FACTORY RUN BY DAYTON PARTS INC.


To manufacture springs, you have to be flexible. That's the lesson learned by
Dayton Parts Inc., of Harrisburg, Pa., a $57 million manufacturer of 17,000
different types of springs primarily used in trucks.

The company had a problem of excessive worker injuries which it discovered
occurred almost entirely during the first two hours of each shift.  In 1990,
the company experimented with a stretching program for all of its plant
personnel and a core group continued with the program for one year.  "At the
end of the year, none of the employees in the stretching group had been
injured," says a U.S.  Navy Best Manufacturing Practices survey of the company
conducted this past summer.  "This result influenced DPI to make stretching
exercises mandatory again in 1992.  All employees are now required to stretch
for 10 to 15 minutes before starting production.  This time is included within
the normal workshift."

The stretching program costs about $75,000 per year to operate, but it pays a
handsome dividend. In conjunction with other safety programs, the company's
annual cost of workman's compensation has decreased from $700,000 to $200,000.
The savings were refunded to the company and the money was used in part to pay
employee bonuses.

Dayton Parts sounds like most companies that have become enlightened over the
past decade.  Its management philosophy is based Eliah Goldratt's theory of
constraints as outlined in his book, The Goal, which is required reading in
all plant departments.  "Every action is focused on the common goal of making
money now and in the future," says the BMP survey.  "This program...has
effected a real cultural change throughout the company."

Safety, customer service, quality and cost reduction are driving forces in the
company. "Shop-floor supervisors now function more as coaches in the continuous
improvement process as the workcells are becoming sell-managed," says the BMP
survey. "Employees are actively involved in continuous improvement teams and
their input is making a difference."

For a copy of the 12-page report, contact Ernie Renner, Director of the BMP
program at 1-800-789-4267, or fax a request to him at 301-403-8180 (e-mail:
ernie@bmpcoe.org).

A NEW BUSINESS MODEL FOR DOD BEGINS TO GAITHER MOMENTUM: ADVANCED CONCEPT
TECHNOLOGY DEMONSTRATIONS


The Advanced Concept Technology Demonstration  (ACTD) program at the Pentagon
has evolved in just two years into becoming a substantial effort that will
leverage three-quarters of a billion dollars. And if the Pentagon brass has its
way, it should grow substantially in the future. 

For fiscal year 1997, the ACTD office working with the services had drawn up a
list of 100 potential ACTDs-"fieldable prototypes"-before winnowing that down
to 46.  The office expects to start another dozen or so new projects next
year, although the number of new starts "is not the characteristic by which we
ought to be measured," says Jack Bachkosky, Deputy Under Secretary of Defense
for Advanced Technology.  The program also has been pared back by Congress.
The Pentagon asked for $65 million this year, but received an appropriation of
$39 million.

The program aims to quickly prove the viability of new military systems within
tight budgetary constraints.  The systems are tailored to the needs of the end
user-the warfighters-and include close participation by technologists,
industry and program managers.  "We're marriage brokers," says Bachkosky in
explaining his role in fostering the deployment of commercial off-the-shelf
and mature technologies into useful new defense systems.

The eight ACTDs now under way and the nine new projects that will start in
1996 represent a new way of doing business for the Pentagon.  With technology
changing faster than the defense procurement system, military planners are
fielding systems that are obsolete before they go into production.

The ACTDs only embrace mature technologies that can be fielded almost
immediately in new systems, "We make sure the users understand they know what
the technology will and will not do," Bachkosky told a group of reporters in a
recent Pentagon briefing.  Some technologies may not be mature enough to carry
out a far-fledged mission.  Others that use commercial components not designed
for the military may not work without radical reengineering at substantial
cost.  Such technologies are probably not good candidates for ACTDs, says
Bachkosky.

"ACTD provides the procedures for the users to identify his needs initially,
then there is a continuous interaction" so the user understands how much such a
system will cost and whether it's feasible for it to go into production through
the normal acquisition process, he explains. 

Understanding the cost of production and ownership-maintenance and manpower
needed to operate the system-is part of the ACTD process. "If it does provide a
needed capability and its costs are not insurmountable, then it will go into
low-rate production," says Bachkosky.

The "Predator" autonomous aerial vehicle, which is now flying above Bosnia, is
an example of a more mature ACTD.  It has a range of 500 miles; can fly at
25,000 feet for 40 hours and can cruise at 70 miles per hour.  It is equipped
with a payload of sensors.  Commanders on the ground would love to have a
system that flies at mach one or mach 1.6.  But to field such a system, the
ACTD program would have to begin an entirely new project.  If the field
commanders "want to buy a 911 Porsche for a Honda Civic price" then the ACTD
office has to tell them "we can't afford it," says Bachkosky.  "We give them
an estimate on how much more it will cost.  The warfighter can accept that or
not."

The ACTD program "is a way of working around the acquisition process,"
Bachkosky adds.  "It provides an entry for systems the military wants and
needs."  The office is working closely with industry and industry associations
to create projects based on purely commercial technologies.  Even a company
like Disney has something to offer in the way of simulation technology.
"They're not immune from taking money from DOD as they are from anywhere
else," says Bachkosky, who can be reached at 703-697-6446.

APPROVED 1996 ACTDS:
o Combat ID
o Logistics (Total Asset Visibility)
o Medium Lift Helicopter (completed)
o Semi-Automated Imagery Processing
o Battlefield Awareness and Data Dissemination
o Counter Proliferation
o Military Operations in Built Up Areas (delayed 1 year)
o Ship Defense Against Imaging IR Missiles (cancelled)

JAPANESE AUTO EXECUTIVE TELLS DETROIT TO QUIT WHINING


The Japanese automobile market is not a "sanctuary" as Chrysler Chairman Robert
Eaton says it is, according to William Duncan, general director of the Japan
Automobile Manufacturers Association. "Eleven auto manufacturers now compete in
Japan intensely for a market that is less than half the size of the U.S.," he
says. "This is hardly a sanctuary."

The Big Three's problems in Japan are being caused "precisely" for the reason
that Japan's market "is not a sanctuary that allows manufacturers to ignore
customers needs for easy profits."  In August of last year, imports took 13
percent of Japan's automobile market and 32 percent of the large car segment
was captured by Ford, GM and Chrysler.

"Detroit's automakers have only recently indicated a serious interest in
selling cars in Japan and still have a long way to go to match their European
counterparts in product availability, market fit and investment," says Duncan,
who can be reached at 202-296-8537.

CORPORATE NEWS: KOLLMORGAN CORP.; SELECTRON CORP


Kollmorgan Corp.  has won the The National Electrical Manufacturers
Association's Automation Forum's Renewal Award for improving its manufacturing
facilities and keeping them in the United States.  "Kollmorgan could have
easily decided to manufacture products offshore, but believed they could
achieve competitive manufacturing costs and efficiencies by rearranging its
facilities into focused factories in North America," says Automation Forum
executive director Bill Rolland, who can be reached at 703-841-3200.

Solectron Corp., the company that does nothing other than focus on
manufacturing electronics products for others, had another banner quarter.
Its sales for the first quarter of 1996 were up 36 percent to $691 million,
and its net income soared 50 percent to $27.3 million ($0.52 per share).
"During the quarter, several of our customers, particularly those in the
peripherals, telecommunications and workstation markets, expanded their
relationship with us and/or increased their volume requirements," says
Solectron president and CEO Koichi Nishimura, who can be reached at

THE NAVY'S INNOVATIVE SOLUTION TO MAINTAIN CAPABILITY WHILE REDUCING ITS
INFRASTRUCTURE


Like the other military services, the Navy has an extensive number of
manufacturing facilities.  For the most part, these are referred to as depots,
although there are other manufacturing assets, such as shipyards and
industrial departments.  Over the years, these facilities have been used to
maintain the fleet and have benefited from protective legislation guaranteeing
sources of work.  But as the Defense Department continues to downsize, these
in-house assets are being viewed for reduction or closure.

The current policy of the government is to depend on the private sector to the
maximum extent possible.  This policy has been established in OMB Circular
A-76, "Performance of Commercial Activities," and has recently been
reemphasized in the "Roles and Mission" report presented to the Secretary of
Defense.  Under certain conditions, however, the private sector is not used.
These would include areas protected by the government to maintain capability
as governed by the "60/40" rule which keeps 60 percent of all maintenance work
in-house, and areas where the private sector has defaulted on performance
requirements, can't respond to fleet emergencies, or chooses not to bid on
government solicitations.

There are presently two versions of legislation pending in Congress to address
the "60/40" rule.  Both bills appear to eliminate this "60/40" restriction,
forcing the services to outsource work previously performed in-house.  Taking
the potential legislative decision to the extreme, depots would be closed for
business and private industry would become responsible for all defense
industrial work.  This would include those categories of work that private
industry failed to do correctly the first time.

Obviously, out-sourcing all defense work is not the sole solution to
downsizing.  The government will need to maintain some in-house manufacturing
capability to respond to fleet needs when private industry cannot do so.  The
result will be a compromise to the "60/40" rule, where the government
maintains a much smaller in-house capability.  A challenge for the Defense
Department, therefore, is deciding how to address this impending legislation
in a timely and efficient manner.

In Lakehurst, N.J., the Navy has a $200 million manufacturing facility, which
occupies 250,000 square feet of unique buildings and is staffed by 214
manufacturing engineers and artisans.  The primary purpose of the Lakehurst
plant is to provide prototype manufacturing support, producibility analysis,
drawing package validation and the application of new manufacturing
technologies to the design, development, and product verification of flight
critical aircraft launch and recovery and support equipment.  A significant
part of the Lakehurst work involves completing contractor defaulted efforts,
responding to fleet-critical needs and conducting work the private sector was
not interested in doing.

Supported by the National Performance Review recommendations, a downsizing and
the creation of a competency-aligned organization, Lakehurst has been reduced
to its core, with employment down approximately 33 percent from four years
ago.  The key to the continued success of this downsized organization was
identifying the critical in-house labor required to perform the tasks
necessary to deliver quality equipment and support contracting efforts.  Tasks
that could be performed by industry were earmarked for contracting out.  The
net result is an industrial facility that is working with non-defense
organizations and is operating at the same level of performance at a reduced
cost.

According to Richard Rumpf, former Assistant Secretary of the Navy, Research,
Engineering and Systems, partnering permits the government to maximize use of
private industry, reduce the possibility of default, keep the fleet running
smoothly and allow the government to reduce its size while maintaining
capability. 

     The partnering concept is also fully compliant with Federal Acquisition
Regulations and public law. Concepts for partnering are being refined and
explored at Navy Lakehurst and, if successful, offer the possibility for
applying the partnership concept to depots when and if the "60/40" rule is
abolished in the December, 1997, timeframe. Partnerships are a win-win
arrangement for both the Navy and industry.

1995: THE YEAR IN QUOTES


"If it ain't broken, break it," became a cliche in 1995, but it's probably the
best way to describe what was happening in the industrial sector last year.

If only that was the case in politics. Politicians spent the year breaking what
was already broken. As U.S. industry stormed into 1996, the U.S. government
limped. 

While the private sector was undergoing a rebirth with a surge of confidence
provided by the maturation of new technologies and the booming stock market,
the U.S.  government reached a nadir, getting bombed in Oklahoma and closing
its doors in Washington.  If it's any consolation to those who work for Uncle
Sam, it wasn't long ago that U.S.  industry was in about the same situation
with few predicting the turnaround that has ensued.

1995 will be remembered as the year the Internet sprang into the consciousness
of the nation. It was a year in which the electronic revolution intensified.
Manufacturing found a seat at the corporate table, having been orphaned for
decades. The quality revolution seeped further into the business culture. And
the government was on the verge of a radical restructuring.

For the vast majority of people in the U.S.  who are involved in the new
industries that have been created over the past 20 years and the older
industries that have been transformed by the new technologies, a new age of
hope has definitely appeared, driven by the knowledge that humans are
resourceful, extremely hard working, are capable of changing quickly and
learning new skills.  This abundance of energy is collectively transforming
the way we live.  All of this is good news.

Here are some of the more profound, enlightened and interesting things people
said in 1995, as captured by the editorial staff of Manufacturing News.

ON INDUSTRY

"There is a disproportionate amount of pessimism in America about our ability
to compete globally.  Remember, 10 years ago people were saying that we
couldn't compete at all and we were living in a post-industrial society and
manufacturing was written off.  The big story is that that is not happening.
I don't think the majority of Americans know about this story."
--Jerry Jasinowski, president of the National Association of Manufacturers, May
15, 1995

Over the next 50 years, companies will generate hundreds of billions of
dollars-and maybe even trillions of dollars-a year in revenue. Management will
utilize concepts common in organisms and start applying them to corporate
structures. "We will take anecdotes out of nature and convert them into
practical, living guidelines. We will find better ways of letting things
organize from the bottom instead of from the top."
--Bob Galvin, Chairman of the Executive Committee, Motorola, Nov. 15, 1995

"I don't want guys on the [manufacturing] line supporting me.  I want to
support the guys who are doing the work.  I'm just overhead."
--Koichi Nishimura, President and CEO of Solectron Corp., Jan. 3, 1995

"Will Rogers once said, 'Even if you are on the right track, you'll get run
over if you just sit there.' And he was right.  None of us can afford to
become complacent."
--William Mitchell, Vice Chairman, Texas Instruments, March  31, 1995.

"Leadership is all about causing change. Management is about maintaining a
certain level of performance or implementing a program. You have to have both
skills, but the one that we have least of at this point is leadership."
--Eric Houts, Continuous Improvement Program Manager, Kaiser Electronics, Feb.
1, 1995

The Asian competitive threat, particularly from South Korea, "is coming much
faster than most people think and the implications for business, government,
our customers and employees-our overall competitiveness and our standard of
living-are enormous."  The U.S.  government and industry must undergo a "major
change, [otherwise] the role of the Western World will gradually diminish."
--Alex Trotman, Chairman and CEO, Ford Motor Co., Sept. 15, 1995

"I will be a very content business executive when we sell our $250 million
[defense] business and I don't have to deal with the Defense Department of the
United States or [defense departments] anywhere else in the world. I will be
very content when we're down to zero percent of our business."
--Tracy O'Rourke, Chairman and CEO, Varian   Associates Inc., March 15, 1995.
Five months later Varian sold its Electron Devices operation to Leonard Green &
Partners for $200 million.

"I often do a pronoun test when I go into companies.  I say to the workers,
'Tell me about this company?' And if they say 'They' [when talking about
management], I know it is [a struggling] company.  If they say 'We,' I know
it's a different kind of company."
--Labor Secretary Robert Reich, April 17, 1995.

"I have been through the entire transition of the military being the primary
driver of new semiconductor technologies to the military being such a small
part of it that it doesn't drive anything, virtually,"
--Don Walker, Vice President of Motorola and Director of the company's
Commercial-Plus Technologies Operation formerly the Military Products
Operation, based in Tempe, Ariz, speaking about the company's decision to
close its military semiconductor business, May 15, 1995

"In our world-class plants the only person not on a shift is a plant manager
and he is required to come down once a month and run the line."
--James Schoonover, Director of Operations for DuPont, July 3, 1995

"This year, the government of Switzerland is procuring more fighter aircraft
than the United States. We are primarily working off our backlog and new orders
are at an all-time low."
--James Sinnett, Vice President of New Aircraft and Missile Products, McDonnell
Douglas, September 1, 1995

"Most of our major new products have come from the unarticulated needs of our
customers and understanding that. We have to raise the level of innovation we
have in the company."
--William Coyne, Vice President, R&D, 3M, Oct. 17, 1995

"The nice thing about the [semiconductor fabrication plants being built] is
that today, 60 percent of the equipment going into them-whether they're in the
United States or somewhere else-is from U.S.  suppliers."
--William Spencer, President of Sematech, April 17, 1995

"An awareness of the electronics [contract] manufacturing services industry
continues to increase among analysts and investors. In our opinion, this is an
opportune time for investors to capitalize on this industry."
--William Cage, J.C. Bradford & Co., September 1, 1995

"Quantitative analysis of the culture of top growth companies reveals that they
consistently place higher value in areas such as teamwork, innovation, customer
orientation, flexibility, accountability and organizational learning.
Interestingly, top growth companies place low value on bureaucracy, political
power and an orientation toward profit."
--Douglas Tuttle, Deloitte & Touche, July 1, 1995

"At least three-quarters of America's gain in export competitiveness can be
linked to [the high yen].  It is important to recognize that part of the
apparent transformation in the competitive picture is the result of factors
that don't have much to do with the fundamentals of productive performance."
--Richard Lester, director of the MIT Industrial Performance Center, October
17, 1995

"Plants that export are quite different from firms and plants that do not...In
almost all dimensions, the exporters' performance is preferable."
--Why Exports Really Matter, a report from the Manufacturing Institute, July
17, 1995

"The use of advanced manufacturing technologies confers benefits upon both
firms and employees.  Employees in technology-using firms are the recipients
of higher wages and stronger wage gains."
--John Baldwin, Statistics Canada, July 3, 1995

"The only sustainable competitive advantage you can achieve in the chemical
industry is through new technology, not cost, not service. Technology. And the
development of this new technology is essential just to stay even with the
competition." 
--Jim Trainham, Director of Engineering R&D at DuPont's Central R&D facility,
Oct. 2, 1995

"We're at a critical point-a crisis point-in that the printed board technology
and the assembly technology hasn't kept pace.  It's becoming a roadblock.  So
we need a significant effort to overcome that because the country that doesn't
have a printed circuit assembly industry probably soon isn't going to have
much of an electronics industry either."
--Thomas Dammrich, Executive Director of the Institute for Interconnecting and
Packaging Electronic Circuits, July 3, 1995

"There have been further losses among manufacturers of food processing
equipment and packaging and a decline in investment in food science and
technology research.  Both are bellweathers of erosion in technological
leadership and innovation."
--Al Clausi, President of the Institute of Food Technologists, July 17, 1995

"It cost [Wrangler] a little more to make that pair of jeans in the United
States than it would in Bangladesh, but, hey, they can make them today and
deliver them tomorrow, whereas if they order from Bangladesh, they have to wait
at least three or four months to get the boat back over here."
--Peter Butenhoff, President of TC Squared, Feb. 15, 1995


ON JAPAN'S LINGERING PROBLEMS -
AND AWESOME POTENTIAL

"Early on in the current recession, many writers blamed Japan's economic
misfortunes on external factors-appreciation of the yen, U.S.  trade pressure
and the bust of the economic 'bubble.' More recent writings about business
ties to the ominpresent bureaucracy may reflect deeper and more serious
thinking on what's wrong with Japanese ways."
--Ayako Doi, Editor of Japan Digest, Jan. 3, 1995

"Anybody who believes the Japanese are on their back is just wishfully thinking
and in two years, the Japanese are again going to be 10 feet tall,"
--George Gamota, Director of the Mitre Corp., July 17, 1995

"The Japanese are [still] 10 years ahead of us...It's not like we're gaining
anything in the manufacturing field."
--William Boulton, Auburn University's Center for International Commerce, Oct.
17, 1995

"The U.S. holds 95 percent of the world's microprocessor market. Why? Because
Intel, HP and TI have shorted the timeframe of the life of their chips by 50
percent. When they do that, the creative side dominates, whereas on the
improvement side, when the Japanese start to improve the Intel 486, the Pentium
is released. By the time they start to improve the Pentium, the next one is
coming out. The Japanese are really hurt by this strategy."
--John Preston, Director of Technology Development, MIT, Feb. 15, 1995

"At Nissan, industrial engineers will take video tapes of people doing a piece
of work and then the industrial engineer will go fast forward, repeat, fast
forward, repeat and time it and analyze the motion of the wrists and fingers
down to a level where they are then able to detail out how to do this process
the most efficient way and train their people that way. It was strange to see
how the person almost became part of the machine. They were almost one."
--Willie Kim, Group Leader for Manufacturing Engineering at McDonnell Douglas,
commenting about his experience working at Nissan for one year as part of the
Commerce Department's Japanese Manufacturing Fellowship Program, March 3, 1995.

The high yen, high production costs in Japan, and the threat of having
manufacturing plants closed not so much because of damage from an earthquake
but because of a disruption in Japan's finely tuned just-in-time delivery
system "is totally rewriting their books on their investment plans."  It's
especially true now that Japan's economy is picking up and companies are in
the process of deciding when and where to add production capacity.
--Sheridan Tatsuno, Japanese Analyst, shortly after the devastating Kobe
earthquake, Feb. 1, 1995

Commerce At Light Speed (CALS) is being viewed as a way to transform the
keiretsu structure of Japanese industry.  "CALS is drawing attention as a new
rule for transactions between companies that go beyond corporate groupings.
Even the automotive industry, which used to be well known for its keiretsu
relationships, is beginning to seek transactions beyond corporate groupings
such as introducing common parts and components."
--Norihiko Ishiguro, Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry, Nov.
15, 1995

"[The lifetime employment] guarantee might be the structural deficiency of the
Japanese system that is resulting in the prolonged slowdown of the economy.
If that's the case, then they definitely need to change their management
style.  But if they see a recovery just as they used to when they went through
the typical business cycle, they may be able to maintain the old system."
--Joji Arai, Secretary General of the International Productivity Service,
August 7, 1995.


THE AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY

"We're in the fashion business and it's a little like the movie business.
There is a need for right-brain people in a car company-people who are highly
creative and who have an innate sense of the market.  Sometimes if you go
rigorously by what the marketing people say what needs to be done, you will be
guaranteed to do the wrong thing."
--Robert Lutz, President, Chrysler Corp., Feb. 1, 1995

"While we're researching agile, the Japanese are implementing it. And it is the
master of lean, which is Toyota, that is going and implementing it. We don't
have any more time to study,"
--Donald Runkle, Vice President of General Motors and General Manager of GM's
Delphi Saginaw division, May 15, 1995

"The advantage of having a single CAD/CAM system, and in particular one like
CATIA, lies primarily in the fact that the entire enterprise can easily access
and communicate product and process definition without the ever-present fear
that it will be misinterpreted either because of translation errors or [it] not
[being] up to date. We can directly trace much of our improved quality and
reduced cost to our implementation of a single CAD system."
--Frank Ewasyshyn, Vice President of Advanced Manufacturing Engineering,
Chrysler Corp., July 17, 1995

"Each of the Big Three companies has a long way to go in the cultural change
process which will result in a truly lean enterprise."
--Daniel Roos, Co-Director of MIT's International Motor Vehicle Program, Nov.
1, 1995

"The focus [of the Ford Production System] is on zero waste, zero defects, high
levels of machine reliability and measuring ourselves every step of the
process."
--Roman Krygier, Advanced Engineering and Process Leadership for Ford
Automotive, Nov. 1, 1995. 

LABOR

"For the sake of the shareholder and [executive] bonuses, [management is]
willing to keep the people down in Third World countries also. I don't see
corporations talking about real democracy in China or Korea. They don't give a
shit about democracy over there. They don't give a shit about it because they
don't really know what democracy is because they don't have democracy in their
own plants in the United States."
--George Korpias, President, International Association of Machinists, Dec. 1,
1995

"True apprenticeships [for tool and die makers] have gone away, which is very
bad. What happens is you have this group of journeymen whose average age now is
61 years old, so it won't be long before there won't be anybody left to train
the new people coming into the field. It's an urgent thing."
--Sam Hart, a machinist at the Oak Ridge Y-12 production facility, Feb.  15,
1995

THE NEW CONGRESS

"The bar has been raised with this session of Congress in terms of someone
showing us that we are making a prudent investment. A prudent investment isn't
good enough. A desirable investment isn't good enough any more. A
well-intentioned investment won't make it in this environment. The old game is
over. And it really is over because times have changed."
--Rep. Bob Franks (R-N.J.), Feb. 1, 1995

"The long-term commitment of the country to research and development is in
jeopardy.  There is a real chance that we'll wind up with a budget resolution
or a set of priorities that do not reflect the same level of national
commitment to research and development that we've had since the second world
war."
--Sen. Jeff Bingaman (D-N.M.), May 1, 1995

Q: "The freshmen organized in the House right now want to get rid of the whole
Department of Commerce."
Good: "I find that one just absolutely mind boggling. How could you possibly be
a group of people who are presumably pro business and want to abolish the only
advocate for business in the cabinet?"

"Q:  But they come over here and see people walking the halls like zombies,
doing nothing."
Good: "That's bull_, come on. I can go to anybody's establishment and find
zombies. And I can find them on Capitol Hill. There are a hell of a lot of
people in this building who are career folks who really work very hard and are
very smart and do a good job.  Sure there is stuff that doesn't get done very
well, nobody is going to argue that. But a hell of a lot gets done pretty well.
The other point is I get a little bit aggravated about the fact that the
suggestion is that I checked my brains when I came here."
-Mary Good, Undersecretary of Technology at the U.S. Department of Commerce,
April 17, 1995

"I don't think the Chrysler bill is going to go any place. They [Republican
freshmen] worked solo. You're going to privatize NIST? Over my dead body."
--Rep. Constance Morella (R-Md), Chairman of the House Science Committee's
technology subcommittee, June 15, 1995

The House Republicans "are not anxious to cut off something [pork-barrel
projects] that they got a good deal of benefit out of. The new [committee]
chairmen are chomping at the bit to get some goodies for themselves."
--Rep. George Brown (D-Calif.), Ranking Minority Member of the House Science
Committee, March 3, 1995

"We've been doing technology with industry and triggering things for the
commercial marketplace forever.  We keep kidding ourselves about why we're
doing the projects.  But I like doing it from out behind the curtain [of the
military].  It's risky, and I don't know if it will last, but we owe it to the
country to do it correctly and be honest about it."
--Arati Prabhakar, Director of the National Institute of Standards and
Technology, June 1, 1995, discussing the fate of the Advanced Technology
Program, which is still up in the air.

"The National Association of Manufacturers believes the disproportionate large
cuts proposed in newer R&D programs are a mistake."
--NAM policy statement on federal R&D budget cuts, Sept. 1, 1995


NATIONAL LABS, R&D AND UNIVERSITIES

"I wonder if the new Congress realizes how angry U.S. high-tech companies are
becoming at what they perceive as the unfair competition they are increasingly
encountering from the federal laboratories for diminishing federal science and
technology spending. In too many instances, federal laboratories established to
serve the public interest seem to have evolved into institutions bent on their
own survival whether that serves the public interest or not."
-Brenda Forman, Director of Marketing Policy for Lockheed Martin, March 15,
1995

"It is now part of every program manager's job not only to develop great new
military relevant technologies, but to take the responsibility of determining
how it will get built."
--Michael McGrath, manufacturing program manager at the Defense Department's
Advanced Research Projects Agency, March 15, 1995

"...One of the difficulties with ARPA is that it has grown so big that-at least
in my view-its character is threatened. There is a danger in ARPA getting too
big, both in changing its character and it becoming too bureaucratic. That is
not necessarily good for an entrepreneurial organization. I'm trying very hard
to shrink the agency. It is not a popular notion. ARPA is very entrepreneurial.
The object of the game is to get all the money."
--Larry Lynn, Director of the Advanced Research Projects Agency. Oct. 17, 1995

"When Alice went looking for a land of nonsense, she found it. It was the
university."
-John White, Dean of the College of Engineering, Georgia Institute of
Technology, July 17, 1995

"Today, the future has no organized political constituency."
--Charles Vest, President, MIT, Oct. 2, 1995

A 1996 MANUFACTURING RESOLUTION: EDUCATION REPLACES COMPETITIVENESS AT NATION'S
PRIMARY CONCERN


Last year was one of the best ever for U.S. manufacturers and will go down as
the year that manufacturing was finally recognized as being as important to the
country's future as financing has been for the past decade or more.

Thank goodness. The nation couldn't wait much longer for manufacturing to
undergo an image change both in the public and corporate worlds.

But now the manufacturing community has to build on the good news of 1995.

Education has replaced competitiveness as the buzzword of the 1990s. As well it
should.

During Christmas break, I drove my family from Washington, D.C., to Toronto, a
10-hour trip. About halfway between the two cities lies Corning, N.Y., near the
Pennsylvania border. On the way back from Toronto, we stopped at the Corning
Glass Museum.

The museum includes a tour of the Steuben glass factory, which my children
found to be "awesome, cool," they say.  They had no idea of how glass was
made, and could not believe their eyes when a craftsman making a $400
paperweight easily cut the hot glass with a pair of shears.

The factory was spotless and modern. The workers obviously enjoyed what they
were doing. And the products they made were works are art-expensive, but worth
it-given the amount of work and skill needed to make them, say my kids, who
enthusiastically said they'd love to learn the craft.

Having never thought of it before, they realized how important glass is in our
culture and that it's been made for more than 3,000 years. They experienced the
entire  process, from the gathering of the raw materials to the grinding,
polishing and inspection of the final product.  "I loved it," said my
12-year-old daughter.

If you are the owner or manager of a manufacturing plant, show it off to the
children in your community AND their parents AND the press. 

Manufacturing is reclaiming its place in American society, but it needs a push.
Making products is sexy, vibrant, high-tech, exciting and rewarding. This
message has to get out to millions of people in the country who are fretting
about the future.

Keep telling the story.

--Richard McCormack
