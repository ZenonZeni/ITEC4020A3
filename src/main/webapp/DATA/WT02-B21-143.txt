<H1>Information Headquarters for ASF/STEP Software and Tools</H1>
One of the goals of the ASF/STEP program is to create software and 
software tools to help manipulate and explore SAR data. Software, as used 
by the ASF/STEP devlopment team, is defined as an individual program that 
preforms one specific task. However, when working with SAR data, a user 
will need to preform many tasks to achieve the desired result. For 
example, if a user wants to combine multiple SAR images, the user will 
have to preform radiometric calibration, geocoding, and maybe even a 
resampling of the images to obtain what he or she wants.
<P>
To help in this process, STEP has created software tools. A tool helps 
the user by preforming all the specific tasks to accompils what the user 
wants. Using the mosaicking example from the last paragraph, a user could 
use a software tool to preform all the specific tasks automatically.
<P>
Why do we offer both tools and software? We offer the user both because
the user has better idea of what he or she wants to do with their data. 
The software programs by themselves can be used in other ways besides our
tools. We offer the software programs (including the source code) so that
each user can use the programs to his or her best advantage.
