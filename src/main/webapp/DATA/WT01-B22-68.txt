<h2>Pinch Hitters for Defense </h2>

<h2>Popular Mechanics, December, 1941 </h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>

<p>Over in England it's saccharine for sugar; on the continent
it's charcoal &quot;gasogenes&quot; in the rumble seat instead of
gasoline in the tank. Here in America there's plenty of sugar,
plenty of gasoline. Yet there's an industrial revolution in
progress just the same, a revolution in materials that will
affect every home. After twelve years of research, the Ford Motor
Company has completed an experimental automobile with a plastic
body. Although its design takes advantage of the properties of
plastics, the streamline car does not differ greatly in
appearance from its steel counterpart. The only steel in the
hand-made body is found in the tubular welded frame on which are
mounted 14 plastic panels, 3/16 inch thick. Composed of a mixture
of farm crops and synthetic chemicals, the plastic is reported to
withstand a blow 10 times as great as steel without denting. Even
the windows and windshield are of plastic. The total weight of
the plastic car is about 2,000 pounds, compared with 3,000 pounds
for a steel automobile of the same size. Although no hint has
been given as to when plastic cars may go into production, the
experimental model is pictured as a step toward materialization
of Henry Ford's belief that some day he would &quot;grow
automobiles from the soil.&quot; When Henry Ford recently
unveiled his plastic car, result of 12 years of research, he gave
the world a glimpse of the automobile of tomorrow, its tough
panels molded under hydraulic pressure of 1,500 pounds per square
inch from a recipe that calls for 70 percent ofcellulose fibers
from wheat straw, hemp and sisal plus 30 percent resin binder.
The only steel in the car is its tubular welded frame. The
plastic car weighs a ton, 1,000 pounds lighter than a comparable
steel car. Manufacturers are already taking a low-priced plastic
car to test the public's taste by 1943. </p>
