<H3>ABSTRACT</H3>
<P>
<FONT FACE="ARIAL">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Commercially available styrene-ethylene/butylene-styrene triblock polymer (Kraton G1652) was partially sulfonated using a SO3/triethyl
phosphate reagent in a dichloroethane/cyclohexane mixed solvent.
Films of the product were cast from lower alcohols to give elastic
materials with different degrees of sulfonation (ca. 30-60%) as
determined by titration. Transmission electron microscopy suggests
that the cast films possess cylindrical sulfonated polystyrene
domains. The films swell in water, with the extent of swelling
being dependent on the sulfonation level. Ionic conductivities
as high as 8.5 x 10^(-2) S/cm are obtained when fully hydrated,
and compare favorably to those exhibited by hydrated, sulfonated
fluoropolymers such as Nafion.</FONT>
<HR width=3>

<P>
<H3>INTRODUCTION</H3>
<P>
<FONT FACE="ARIAL">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Polymers with high protonic conductivities are potentially useful
as proton exchange membranes (PEM's) in fuel cells. Among the
earliest PEM's were sulfonated, crosslinked polystyrenes, and
these were employed in fuel cells on the Gemini space missions. <A href="#A1">[1]</A>
More recently, interest has been directed to sulfonated fluorocarbon
polymers, of which Nafion has been most extensively studied. <A href="#A2">[2-7]</A> 
This material has a high protonic conductivity (ca. 7 x 10-2 S/cm
at 30 oC) <A href="#A3">[8]</A> when hydrated and is chemically
rather inert.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="ARIAL">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been proposed that Nafion possesses an inverted micellar
structure, with spherical (ca. 40-50 &Aring; diameter) clusters
lined with sulfonic acid groups which are interconnected via ca.
10 &Aring; channels. <A href="#A4">[9-11]</A> We sought to mimic
this picture using inexpensive sulfonated, hydrocarbon-based block
copolymers. Block copolymers in general can exhibit a rich array
of microphase-separated morphologies depending on relative block
sizes. <A href="#A5">[12]</A> Such materials provide us with an
opportunity to link good ionic (protonic) conductivity through
water-swellable micro-domains with low material cost and desirable
mechanical properties. We note that selected block copolymers
have been shown to be useful as alkali metal-based polymer electrolytes, <A href="#A6">[13]</A> 
although apparently no efforts have been directed toward obtaining
high protonic conductivity based on hydrocarbon block polymers.</FONT>

<P>
<FONT FACE="ARIAL">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We selected Kraton G1652 for our studies as it contains a saturated
carbon center block which should be inert to the sulfonation reaction,
which in this case employs SO3/triethyl phosphate to achieve high
levels of sulfonation without crosslinking. <A href="#A7">[14]</A> 
The reaction is summarized in <A HREF="images/fig1acs.jpg" >Figure 1</A> . 
The Kraton used in this study contains 29% by weight styrene and
exhibits a microstructure of polystyrene phases intermediate between
spheres and cylinders (ca. 150 &Aring; in diameter) in an ethylene/
butylene-rich continuous phase. 16 Sulfonation levels, based on
the moles of styrene units sulfonated, ranged from 35-65% as determined
by titration. We note that sulfonated, saturated Kratons have
been disclosed in a patent, <A href="#A8">[15]</A> and that Weiss
and coworkers <A href="#A9">[16-18]</A> have explored in detail
the morphology and mechanical properties of lightly sulfonated
(up to 12 mol% styrene units) Kraton G1652, the latter representing
an interesting new class of ionomers. However, we are unaware
of studies directed at highly sulfonated derivatives with the
aim of obtaining highly proton conducting films.</FONT>
<P>
<H3>EXPERIMENTAL</H3>
<P>
<FONT FACE="ARIAL">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kraton G1652 was acquired from Shell Chemical; dichloroethane
(DCE) and cyclohexane were from Krackeler Scientific; triethyl
phosphate (TEP) and sulfur trioxide (SO3) were from Aldrich. All
materials were used without further purification. Sulfonation
of the styrene-ethylene/butylene-styrene (SEBS) triblock polymer
was carried out in a batch mode using SO3/TEP. <A href="#A7">[14]</A> 
The reaction vessel was kept slightly below 0oC and reaction times
ranged from 60-90 min. After removing most of the cyclohexane
and DCE, the residue was taken up into lower alcohols. Films were
then cast from these solutions on glass under an IR lamp.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="ARIAL">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Titrations to determine the sulfonic acid content of the film
were carried out using standardized sodium hydroxide solutions.
Films were hydrated in deionized water and washed by placing the
film in clean deionized water three times for one hour each. About
0.15 g of film was placed in a small vial and approximately 12
ml of sodium chloride solution was added. After immersion for
about 2 h, titrations to a phenolphthalein endpoint were carried
out. Data are reported as mol% styrene units sulfonated. Samples
for transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were first stained
for 15 min in the presence of RuO4 vapor and then cryomicrotomed
at -100 degrees celsius using a Reichert-Jung Fc4 microtome. A
2000 FX high resolution transmission electron microscope was employed
at a magnification of 275,000x.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="ARIAL">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conductivity measurements were made on samples treated to remove
any residual sulfuric acid from the sulfonation reaction. Samples
were soaked in water for 30 min. and then dried under an IR lamp
for 30 min, and this sequence was repeated twice. The conductivity
of the membrane was measured by using a pair of pressure-attached
high surface area platinum electrodes as described by Zawodsinski
et al.8 The mounted sample was immersed in distilled, deionized
water at room temperature (ca. 24 degrees Celsius). Once the sample
had completely hydrated, measurements were made from 1 Hz to 10KHz
using a Solartron 1260 frequency response analyzer. Both real
and imaginary components of the impedance were measured and the
real Z-axis intercept was closely approximated. The cell constant
was calculated from the spacing of the electrodes (L), the thickness
of the membrane and the area of the platinum electrodes (A). The
conductivity (s) was calculated using the equation</FONT>

<H3>RESULTS &amp DISCUSSION</H3>
<P>
<FONT FACE="ARIAL">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Films of sulfonated triblock polymer are yellow and relatively
transparent as well as elastomeric. A transmission electron micrograph
of a microtomed and RuO4-stained film (ca. 45% sulfonation) is
shown in Figure 2 and reveals what appear to be cylindrical (ca.
150 &Aring; in diameter) sulfonated polystyrene domains in an
ethylene/butylene matrix. We believe that at this high sulfonation
level, relatively homogeneous sulfonated polystyrene domains are
present rather than ionic clusters of sulfonated styrene repeat
units within polystyrene domains as is the case in lightly sulfonated
Kratons. <A href="#A9">[16-18]</A></FONT> 
<P>
<FONT FACE="ARIAL">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The films swell upon immersion in water, and the extent of swelling
is as expected dependent upon the sulfonation level. These hydrogels
retain their elastomeric character. We have no information on
the organization or the sizes of the sulfonated domains upon hydration,
but speculate that these are interconnected upon swelling and
perhaps forming bicontinuous phases. X-ray and neutron scattering
experiments are planned to address this important issue. The films
remain relatively transparent upon hydration, suggesting that
the water-swollen domains remain below ca. 400 nm in diameter.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="ARIAL">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ionic conductivities of fully hydrated films having various levels
of sulfonation are reported in <a href="table1.htm"> Table 1 </a>. Samples having sulfonation
levels greater than about 45% have conductivities comparable to
Nafion (ca. 7 x 10-2 S/cm) under similar conditions.(8) The amount
of sulfonation within the polystyrene domains is well above the
percolation threshold for ionic conduction of ca. 7 mol%, as recently
determined by Yeager, Eisenberg and coworkers <A href="#A10">[19]</A>  
for sulfonated homopolystyrene. The high conductivity we observe
indicates that the sulfonated domains are interconnected. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="ARIAL">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In summary, we have prepared highly proton conducting, elastomeric
films by sulfonation of a styrene-ethylene/butylene-styrene triblock
polymer. Several applications of these materials are being investigated,
including their use as proton exchange membranes in fuel cells.</FONT>
