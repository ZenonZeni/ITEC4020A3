Debtor's Counsel Pleads Guilty to Bankruptcy Fraud

Bernard J. Berry, a California bankruptcy attorney, pleaded guilty on
Dec. 11 to two counts of bankruptcy fraud. According to U.S. Attorney
Nora M. Manella, Berry, in anticipation of filing a bankruptcy for his
client, transferred the client's business assets away from her business
knowing that the assets were collateral for an SBA loan. This action was
taken with intent of concealing the assets from representatives of the
SBA and the bankruptcy trustee.
"This is a particularly egregious case because it involves an attorney
who attempted to use his knowledge of bankruptcy proceedings to profit
at the expenses of the U.S. Government," said Steve Marica, assistant
inspector general for investigations at the SBA.
Berry is scheduled to be sentenced on March 8, 1995. He faces a maximum
sentence of 10 years in prison and a fine of $500,000.

Melvin Belli Files Chapter 11

Melvin Belli is one of the most well-known lawyers in the country. His
fame was such in the '60s that he actually appeared on an episode of the
TV series "Star Trek," as "Gorgon," a creature who made the  children of
one planet visited by the starship "Enterprise" murder their own
parents.
As a lawyer, he brought personal injury lawsuits to the public
consciousness and was a role model for many law students.
Now his firm has filed Chapter 11 and Belli has hired San Francisco
bankruptcy lawyer Penn Butler to represent him.
"There are two culprits," Belli said. "One is Dow Chemical who went into
bankruptcy and reneged on the $4 billion they had set up to pay [tort
claimants]. I had put out $5 million to $10 million for doctor's
reports, etc. The bank was going to lend us $45 million based on the Dow
Chemical settlement."
But when Dow went into bankruptcy, that loan disappeared and Belli found
himself cash poor.
"The second [culprit] is the $15 million [I had to pay my wife] in the
divorce," Belli said.
Belli said the Chapter 11 is merely buying "the finest personal injury
firm in the country" some time until everyone can be paid off in full.
"I have $50 million to $75 million in big cases coming in," he said.
"The oil case in Alaska, the Marcos case, the implants -- they're all
coming in toward the end of this year and over into the next year. But
we had some current creditors who wouldn't wait. It was impossible to do
anything but go into a Chapter 11."
Belli is now an outspoken convert of the bankruptcy system.
"People don't realize what Chapter 11 really is for," he said. "I have
changed my former opinion of that. I didn't know the difference between
Chapter 11 and ordinary bankruptcy. [Now I say], thank God that we've
got Chapter 11."

Lenders Worry That Consumers Cannot Afford Increased Debt

For the first time in history, consumers owe more than $1 trillion on
their non-mortgage installment credit. The outstanding balance on their
credit cards is approaching $400 billion. The most recent statistics
from the Federal Reserve show that total outstanding consumer revolving
credit was 19 percent higher through the end of October 1995 than it was
at the end of October 1994. According to RAM Research's Bankcard
Barometer, credit card delinquency rates increased from 3.89 percent
during the first quarter of 1995 to 4.33 percent during the fourth
quarter of the year.
All these numbers have the people who lent the money more than a little
nervous that debtors will be unable to pay their bills.
"1996 will be a year when we see higher delinquency and loan losses as
the consumer becomes more overextended," predicted John Kirby, senior
vice president in charge of consumer lending for SouthTrust Bank of
Alabama, N.A., in Birmingham, Ala. "Credit cards have been highly
solicited during 1995, leading to a suspicion that a larger number of
customers will have more credit card debt than their income provides."
Kirby explained that this explosion in credit card availability was the
result of several new lenders entering the market. In order to establish
loan volumes these new lenders were very aggressive in the solicitation
of business and often offered very low rates. Lenders who did not lower
their underwriting standards or rates in response to this competition
lost business to the new lenders. Many of those customers who left were
better credit risks than those who stayed. As a result, all lenders have
an increased risk of loss on consumer loans regardless of whether they
extended credit to borrowers that they might have previously rejected.
W. Doug King, executive vice president of Wachovia Corp. in Winston-
Salem, N.C., agreed that consumers will have increased difficulty paying
their bills during 1996 and saw it as a continuation of a trend that
began during 1995.
"Over the past several years consumers have taken on a great deal of
debt. The strained ability to service indebtedness through income, which
is not growing at a rapid pace, makes it very difficult for consumers to
address unexpected expenses," King said. "In the household environment
of two incomes where one or both consumers have lost jobs due to
downsizing, consolidations, or mergers, many have had to take lower
paying jobs, or are still unemployed. This situation has, of course,
significantly impacted the debt repayment ability of those affected
consumers.
King also noted that increases in the prime rate, which went from 6
percent to 9 percent in less than a year, significantly impacted the
ability of consumers with adjustable rate mortgages to finance their
other installment debt.
The ease of filing for bankruptcy is another reason why King expects to
see higher consumer loan losses during 1996. "Filing is simple and
inexpensive, there is no longer a social stigma attached to bankruptcy,
and the judicial system, in many cases, appears to be encouraging the
'fresh start' concept of bankruptcy."
While these factors would be conditions causing loan losses at any time,
the lending practices of credit card issuers have created a fragile
economic environment for consumers.
"The credit card industry has flooded the market with a variety of
credit card offers, most with tempting teaser rates. These offers have
encouraged some consumers to accept higher credit availability than can
be serviced with their income. In addition, the teaser rates quickly
expire resulting in higher debt service obligations."
Credit card issuers offering incentives for credit card use have added
to the problem of consumers taking on more debt than they can handle.
While there is nothing inherently wrong with consumers using credit
cards that offer rewards, "many consumers are being shocked at how
quickly miscellaneous purchases can add up," King said. "For example, in
some cases consumers, who have purchased groceries with credit cards,
are finding that they do not have the ability to pay off those purchases
upon receipt of the credit card statement, and actually wind up paying
for those groceries over an extended period of time."
And King sees the trend of increased consumer loan losses resulting from
lowered credit standards continuing beyond 1996.
"From a realistic standpoint, due to 1996 budgetary and earnings
pressures, the possibility of some banks lowering credit standards to
maintain growth and earnings may exist. In the event some banks in the
industry did lower credit standards consumer delinquencies and losses
would clearly move to even higher levels."
So, are lowered standards for issuing credit cards going to bankrupt the
lenders along with the borrowers? Probably not.
"The good news is that credit card debt is but one segment of the
consumer debt," said William E. MacDonald III, the president and CEO of
National City Bank, Cleveland, in Cleveland, Ohio, and the chairman of
the Consumer Bankers Association.
"To fairly assess consumer debt you must also include loans from home
equity and personal and revolving credit lines. If you look at the debt
service burden from a macro perspective, including both mortgage and
installment loan payments, the debt level numbers are not as alarming,"
MacDonald said.

5th Circuit Judges May Prohibit Chapter 13 Plans Calling for Direct
Payment of Creditors

Bankruptcy judges may deny confirmation of Chapter 13 plans that call
for the debtor to make payments directly to creditors, the Fifth Circuit
ruled in William C. and Julie C. Reid v. Michael Gross (In the Matter of
William C. and Julie C. Reid), No. 95-40249 (December 11, 1995). The per
curiam decision was not released for publication.
"We write briefly today only to emphasize that In re Foster, 670 F.2d
478 (5th Cir. 1982), stands clearly for the principle that the
bankruptcy court has broad discretion in determining whether a debtor
may act as disbursing agent in place of the trustee, thereby avoiding
the Chapter 13 trustee's fees," the court said. "Although Foster
recognizes that the debtor should have flexibility in formulating
Chapter 13 plans . . . we find no error in the bankruptcy court's
rejection of the proposed, amended plan, which, in this instance,
included a modification of First Bank and Trust's original loan to the
debtors."

U.S. Trustees Respond to Chapter 13 Guideline Criticism

The December 21st issue of Consumer Bankruptcy News included an article
entitled "EOUST Hears from Tennessee Legislators." This article also
appeared in Bankruptcy Court Decisions News & Comment, where it included
a note that bankruptcy judges had also written to the Executive Office
for U.S. Trustees to express concern with the proposed revisions to the
Chapter 13 Trustees' Handbook and the proposed ethical guidelines. In
response to the BCD version of the article we heard from Linda Ekstrom
Stanley, the U.S. Trustee for Region 17 (E.D. and N.D. Cal. and D.
Nev.), the chair of the Standing Trustee Subcommittee and Ellen B.
Vergos, U.S. Trustee for Region 8 (Ky. and Tenn.).
"As United States Trustees, and as members of the subcommittee who
participated in the drafting of proposed Standards of Conduct for
Standing Trustees and proposed Handbook Revisions, we are particularly
concerned that Chapter 13 administration be ethical, efficient and
economical for all who come in contact with the system.  This is a goal
of all those in the U.S. Trustee Program who have been involved with
these proposals.
"We feel it necessary to correct some misconceptions circulating about
the proposed standards and handbook revisions.  Many of these
misunderstandings were contained in your recent article entitled
'Legislators/Judges Worry about EOUST's Proposed Rules.'
"Your article quoted a letter from four members of Tennessee's
congressional delegation who expressed a concern that 'these new
regulations would negatively impair the effectiveness of the trustees,
and result in major financial losses to the creditors . . .' We submit
that if one reads the proposed standards and handbook revisions, one
will see that this expressed concern is misplaced.
"The proposals are divided into two portions: the first establishes five
ethical standards; the second gives guidance in incurring expenses and
in determining what is reasonable and necessary.  The standards are
those which ought to guide the fiduciaries in the administration of an
important trust.  The standards are, in part, to address abuses.  For
example, there have been instances where standing trustees have hired
and paid substantial salaries to family members for little or no work.
There have been trustee family members who have received excessive
compensation with benefits packages far exceeding those available for
comparable positions in the public and private sectors. Other cases
involve self-dealing by trustees who have charged trust operations sums
far above market rates or for often unnecessary expenses. These are of
serious concern.  Every dollar spent on unnecessary expenses comes out
of the pockets of the debtors.
"The 21 U.S. Trustees in the country are charged by law with the duty to
supervise the Chapter 13 trustees in their respective regions. 28 U.S.C.
Section 586(b). While the U.S. Trustees have and will continue to deal
with abuses on a case-by-case basis, the U.S. Trustees will be aided in
their supervision by definitive standards of which the standing trustee
has received advance notice about expected conduct. Written standards
will protect against claims of arbitrary or disparate treatment and, in
part, are a response to standing trustees' requests for written
direction.
"The U.S. Trustee Program is also obligated by law to review and approve
the budgets of each trustee operation.  This duty arises from 28 U.S.C.
Sec. 586(a)(1) which expressly limits the use of percentage fees to pay
for compensation and the actual, necessary expenses of the trustee.
"It is up to the 21 U.S. Trustees to act as 'watchdogs' over expenses
and to approve only those which meet the actual and necessary test.  The
proposed handbook revisions are to serve as a guide for the regional
U.S. Trustees in determining whether an expense of the Chapter 13
trustee in their respective regions is actual and necessary.
"The proposed standards and handbook revisions are not being offered as
an attempt to 'federalize' Chapter 13 trustees' operations, as
characterized by the Tennessee congressional delegation whose letter was
quoted in your article.  Rather, they are to serve as standards for
those in the system which will remain largely unchanged.
"Another misconception in your article is that 'the bankruptcy bench
closely monitors the operations of the trustees. . .' While the
bankruptcy courts adjudicate the issues which come before it in Chapter
13, it is the U.S. Trustee who is charged by law with monitoring the
budget and office operations.
"When the standing trustee system is examined, it is clear why Congress
felt that supervision and oversight were necessary.  The standing
trustee is a statutory fiduciary whose rights and responsibilities are
defined by statute as well as by the terms of the confirmed plan.  The
trustee receives payments from the debtor and holds them in trust to
distribute according to the terms of the confirmed plan or as otherwise
provided by law or court order.  To fund the standing trustee operation,
the standing trustee receives a percentage of all moneys received under
plans.  These fees are held in trust to pay for the collective cost of
administering all chapter 13 plans.
"By virtue of appointment by the U.S. Trustee, the standing trustee is
assigned to his or her caseload. The standing trustee's compensation and
office overhead are funded by the moneys paid by debtors through the
Chapter 13 plans.  Eighty percent of the standing trustees in the
country are paid maximum compensation of $122,816 in addition to having
all their overhead paid. The overhead and compensation are paid cut of
the funds paid in by the debtors and not by the trustees.  The standing
trustee is not subject to the vagaries of the marketplace, but receives
his or her salary and overhead by virtue of the number of case filings
in the district.  Many of these trustee operations are quite large.  For
example, in the Western  District of Tennessee, the three standing
trustees disbursed over $100,000,000 in fiscal year 1995.  Each year
approximately $2 billion flows through the standing trustee operations.
Clearly, Congress intended that the use of these fiduciary funds be
supervised.
"Your article suggested that 'letters from bankruptcy judges . . . have
argued in favor of keeping the system as it is.'  The fact is that many
bankruptcy judges have written.  Some favor the proposals, some want to
keep the system as it is, and others favor some proposals and argue
against others.  The comments are across the board.
"Finally, your article, quoting from the congressional letter, cites as
an example of increased cost, that the regulations would require that
the West Tennessee trustees' operations to be split into two distinct
office requiring the purchase of new equipment and the hiring of new
staff. The actual proposals as written, do not require the splitting,
but would prohibit a co-trustee operation to enhance accountability of
the individual trustee.  There are other more cost effective methods by
which the same result could be accomplished.
"The writer of your article suggested that there is a lack of meaningful
dialogue between the U.S. Trustees and the standing trustees which could
'harm the system.' In fact there has been extensive dialogue.  Comments
and suggestions concerning the proposals have been sought and obtained
from standing trustees, judges, creditors and others in the system.
Many U.S. Trustees have held meetings with the standing trustees in
their respective regions to obtain comment and input.  This month the
subcommittee met directly with a cross section of standing trustees from
throughout the country. Many useful suggestions and comments have been
gathered from this process.  The dialogue is ongoing and will be
considered in revising the standards and guidelines early next year.
Additionally, all written comments will be reviewed by the members of
the Director's Advisory Board in the next few weeks.  The Board is
comprised of bankruptcy judges and United States Trustees.  The Board
will also hear oral presentations from some of the commentators,
including representatives of the NACTT.
"If your readers would like to receive a copy of the proposals, write
Linda E. Stanley, 250 Montgomery Street, Suite 910, San Francisco,
California 94104, telephone 415-705-3333; or Sandra S. Coleman,
Assistant Director, Executive Office for United States Trustees, Suite
742, 901 E Building, 901 E Street, N.W., Washington, D.C., 20530,
telephone 202-307-1399."

Farmer Must Repay Over $1 Million in Fraudulent Bankruptcy

District Judge Neal B. Biggers Jr. has ordered Lawyer Wheeler Sr., a
Mississippi delta farmer to repay more than $1.1 million to the
Department of Agriculture and the Bank of Webb as a result of his
conviction on an elaborate bankruptcy fraud scheme.
Wheeler borrowed about $1 million from the Farmers Home Administration
and nearly $150,000 from the Bank of Webb for "farming," according to
the U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Mississippi. He then
declared bankruptcy and obtained a discharge of both of the above debts
by concealing approximately $800,000 in assets and income, the U.S.
Attorney said. The scheme was discovered by the Agriculture Department's
Inspector General.
In addition to repaying his loans, Wheeler must pay a $10,000 fine and
serve a sentence of two years and 10 months in prison without parole
followed by three years of supervised release.
At the sentencing, Judge Biggers told Wheeler that he would not show
leniency to an individual who had willfully committed his crimes and
refused to admit his wrongdoing.

Eleven New Bankruptcy Judgeships Requested

If you're interested in applying for a bankruptcy judgeship, your job
prospects are looking brighter. Because of the recent rise in bankruptcy
filings, Chief Judge Paul A. Magnuson (D. Minn.), chair of the Judicial
Conference's Committee on the Administration of the Bankruptcy System,
recently requested 11 new bankruptcy judgeships.
"The bankruptcy courts have made great strides in the efficient
processing of cases," Judge Magnuson told the House Judiciary
Subcommittee on Commercial and Administrative Law. "Despite our quest
for efficiency...we need additional bankruptcy judges to provide for the
proper administration of the bankruptcy system now."
The Bankruptcy Judgeship Act of 1995 (H.R. 2604), introduced in Nov. by
Rep. George W. Gekas, R-Pa., would establish four permanent bankruptcy
judgeships in the Central District of California and one permanent
bankruptcy judgeship in the District of Maryland.
One temporary bankruptcy judgeship would be created in each of the
following districts: the Southern District of Florida, the Eastern
District of Michigan, the District of New Jersey, the Eastern District
of New York, the Northern District of New York, and the Eastern District
of Pennsylvania.
While there currently are 326 authorized bankruptcy judgeships, the
number of filings increased 8 percent during the first three quarters of
1995 compared to the first three quarters of 1994 -- a pattern that is
expected to continue.
"We are struggling with an overburdened system," Judge Magnuson told the
subcommittee. "We are not asking our bankruptcy judges to do more -- we
are requiring it. We will continue to seek ways to improve the
bankruptcy system's efficiency, but we critically need these 11
additional bankruptcy judgeships."
Also testifying in support of the legislation was Judge William E.
Anderson (Bankr. W.D. Va.), chair of the Legislative Committee of the
National Conference of Bankruptcy Judges, and Chief Judge Paul Mannes
(Bankr. D. Md.).

Top 13 Things Attorneys Wish They Could Tell Judges

1. Be prepared. We thought that the reason attorneys were required to
write prehearing memoranda and clear, detailed moving papers was to
allow the judge to read them before trial.
2. Be open and flexible. Not every relief from stay case is the same.
3. Standardize your rules. Appearing in a new court should not be like a
game of Battleships where you spend all of your time worrying about the
hidden mines.
4. Don't take appeals so personally. You're not infallible.
5. Remember what it was like to be an attorney. You didn't always have
the perfect client or perfect case either.
6. Be humble -- even if you're perfect.
7. Be consistent. Consistency encourages settlements and eliminates
having to quote yourself as contrary authority.
8. Rule promptly. Even if you're wrong it keeps the case moving.
9. Don't publish so many opinions. West Publishing does not give a cash
award for most opinions published by a bankruptcy judge in one year.
10. Give everyone a chance to have his or her complete say -- unless the
case is being televised and will last longer than three months.
11. Be decisive. It's your job.
12. Be prompt -- or approve compensation for counsel waiting time.
13. Be willing to speak to bar associations and civic groups. Attorneys
and the public need to see that you have a mind and a heart.

Top 13 Things Judges Wish They Could Tell Attorneys

1. Be prepared. It works for the Scouts. It will work for you.
2. Be flexible. If a hearing takes an unexpected turn, don't keep going
straight ahead.
3. Be honest and candid. The attorney's license you save may be your
own.
4. Call and ask the judge's clerk about procedural issues if you are
unsure. It beats making dumb mistakes.
5. Don't ask for emergercy relief in every case. Your courthouse
nickname may become "Chicken Little."
6. Be humble -- even if you're perfect.
7. Know your client inside and out -- within professional limits of
course.
8. Be more organized. The judge needs all the help she can get.
9. Have a sense of humor. The law can be funny. The facts can be
hilarious.
10. Kill the court and opposing parties with courtesy and respect. If
you don't, the court may kill you.
11. Losing happens. Prepare yourself and your client for it.
12. Keep cross-examination short and to the point. Boring the judge is
rarely productive.
13. Know the law -- not just the facts before trial. Otherwise, you may
be proving up your opponent's case.

Do You Recognize Your Marketing Program?

By Sally J. Schmidt of Schmidt Marketing Inc. in Burnsville, Minn.
As I travel from law firm to law firm, I often am amazed at the
similarities in how marketing programs are organized or not organized.
In fact, some of the most common marketing structures are downright
dysfunctional.
Whether a firm makes its marketing decisions in one of the ways listed
below is sometimes related to how long the firm has been engaged in
marketing. In other cases, it is a result of the firm's culture and the
degree of individuality that it allows.
Since many of these structures actually can produce negative results,
poor use of resources, internal competition, ill-designed strategies and
potential conflicts, I would like to use a few borrowed clichis to point
out the characteristics of six faulty marketing programs, and the
problems they may create for you, your marketing director, or your firm.
Six Dysfunctional Marketing Programs
1. The Squeaky Wheel Marketing Program
Defining Characteristics: The lawyers who demand the marketing resources
get them.
Discussion: Without a marketing plan or firm-wide goals, decisions about
allocating marketing resources are made on the basis of demand. So it's
possible that the firm is spending money on lawyers who are ineffective
marketers, and activities that will not produce results.
Result: The firm is not working toward any common objectives, and
individual attorneys use firm resources to build their own practices and
potentially portable books of business.
2. The Flavor of the Month Marketing Program
Defining characteristics: Something more "sexy" or interesting always
comes along to capture the attention of the marketing effort.
Discussion: In these programs, the attention span of the marketing
director, marketing committee or marketing partner is relatively short,
and new ideas always receive immediate endorsement. One month it might
be a client survey, the next month a home page, and the next an image
advertising program, with no real commitment to any direction or
strategy.
Result: The firm engages in scattershot initiatives instead of building
a foundation and conducting the follow-up necessary to achieve real
marketing success.
3. The Monkey See, Monkey Do Marketing Program
Defining Characteristic: The firm imitates the marketing efforts of its
competitors or other law firms in its market.
Discussion: I can't tell you the number of law firms that have decided
to undertake an activity because another firm is doing it. From hiring
marketing directors to writing newsletters, their strategies simply
reflect those that their competitors employ. My advice is, if another
firm has already cornered the market on an activity, your firm should do
something else; the innovator firm almost always receives the greatest
rewards.
Result: Since these firms do not take time to determine what they are
trying to accomplish (their objectives), and the best ways to achieve
these objectives, their marketing efforts are usually ineffective.
4. The Pass the Buck Marketing Program
Defining Characteristic: Something or someone else is always holding
things up in marketing.
Discussion: I think lawyers in this type of marketing organization would
have a hard time selecting just one response to this multiple choice
question:
"I cannot do [whatever I was supposed to do] because:
a. The management committee never responded to my memo
b. The marketing director never set up a meeting
c. The brochure is hopelessly out of date
d. My contact never called me back."
Result: No one ever takes the initiative or implements marketing ideas.
5. The Grass Is Always Greener Marketing Program
Defining Characteristic: Other law firms' clients are a lot more
attractive than the ones the firm already has.
Discussion: Usually the result of a poorly designed compensation system
proving too many incentives for origination or not enough for client
retention, this type of program encourages lawyers to pursue new
relationships, sometimes at the expense of existing ones. Taken to the
extreme, some lawyers refuse to work on matters for the client of a
colleague, or to introduce other lawyers into their own client
relationships.
Result: Lawyers are chasing new business while existing (hard-earned)
clients slip away.
6. The Every Man/Woman for Himself/Herself Marketing Program
Defining Characteristic: Everyone in the firm gets equal time and
resources for marketing.
Discussion: Obviously, not every lawyer has the same skills or
opportunities with respect to marketing. While everyone should be
encouraged, not everyone warrants the same resources. The internal
competitiveness and lack of coordination usually found in this marketing
structure can be apparent even to prospects and clients, who may see
lawyers from the same firm call on them on consecutive days or notice a
lack of internal communication. Working together undoubtedly sees
greater marketing success.
Result: The lawyers are not taking advantage of their collective
contracts and ideas, and may even be pursuing conflicting opportunities.
Conclusion
There are some firms whose primary goal is just getting the lawyers to
undertake marketing activities -- any lawyers and any activities. And
the last thing a firm should do is construct what the lawyers perceive
to be barriers to marketing, such as processes, controls or approvals.
Still without a better system for making decisions about marketing
strategies and resources, many law firms will find their levels of
activity and expenses going up appreciably without corresponding
results.
