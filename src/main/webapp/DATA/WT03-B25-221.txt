</H3>
<BR>
A collaborative GMS/GOES Pathfinder project involving the Australian Bureau
of Meteorolgy (BoM), the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research
Organization (CSIRO), the United States National Aeronautical and Space
Administration (NASA), and the Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO)
is underway. Data from the Japanese Meteorological Satellite (GMS) for a
benchmark period (1 July 1994 - 31 December 1995) will be examined (both
GMS-4 and GMS-5). <BR>
Sources of noise in the data (e.g., stripes) will be removed, accurate cloud
detection algorithms will be developed, radiometric calibration of the data
will be performed and validated using field observations being planned and
implemented by CSIRO Division of Atmospheric Sciences, CSIRO Office of Space
Science &amp; Applications/Earth Observation Centre, the Bureau of Meteorology,
and the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. <BR>
<BR>
Contemporaneous GOES observations (GOES-7 and GOES-8) also will be processed
and radiometrically calibrated using procedures developed during the initial
GOES Pathfinder Benchmark period (1987-1988) by Simpson et. al., 1995; Simpson
and Gobat, 1995a,b; and Frouin and Simpson, 1995. This project will modify
the GOES-7 procedure to accommodate and make optional use of new information
contained in the GOES-8 and GOES-9 (GVAR) and the GMS data. A cross calibration
between the GOES and GMS data and between GMS and NOAA AVHRR data for the
period also is planned so that composite products of interest to the global
change community can be made. To demonstrate the scientific usefulness of
the GMS/GOES data resulting from this project, we will: a) examine ENSO
development and propagation from the Indonesian Basin to the west coast
of North America; and b) examine ENSO related land vegetation changes on
the Australian continent. <BR>
<BR>
The data sets, software, and documentation developed as part of this project
by Scripps will be made available to both the NASA designated DAAC and to
CSIRO/BoM in Australia. Likewise, relevant software and datasets developed
by Australia will be made available to Scripps and the NASA designated DAAC.<BR>
