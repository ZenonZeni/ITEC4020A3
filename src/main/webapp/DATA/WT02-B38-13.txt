TECHNOLOGY PROLIFERATION OF 1980s TO SHAPE CARD
MARKET IN 1990s

     With the credit card industry now in what has been termed
"the third decade of card growth," a new agenda of challenges
awaits it.  The coming of the 1990s reinforces the rapid pace at
which change occurred over the past 10 years and how competitive
the current marketplace has become.
     The advances made in electronic processing capabilities in
the 1980s have set the stage for what are expected to be even
more innovative and flexible payment systems ahead.  "As we build
those, there will be the ability to offer a variety of payment
mechanisms--whether they be proprietary credit or proprietary
debit or just various other forms of credit programs," Larry
Myatt, vice president of marketing and product development at
Sears Payment Systems Inc., told CARD NEWS.
     Despite an electronic environment better able to affect
change, by way of providing more options to retailers and
consumers in a shorter period of time, there is still the need to
fine-tune and clarify card product strategies.
     The proliferation of products in the 1980s was designed to
fit various  customer segments, card enhancements, warranty
programs, airline discounts and frequent flier programs.
     But some of what happened has resulted in major internal
divisions.
     "We see every element of the business polarized," Alex Hart,
president of MasterCard International, said about bank cards.
     The industry is divided between issuers and acquirers, a
split seen as possibly eroding future cooperative efforts,
according to an examination of card polarization and consol-
idation, prepared by Edgar, Dunn & Conover Inc., the San
Francisco-based management consulting firm.
     An increasing portion of the industry is concentrated among
fewer participants in both the issuing and acquiring segments.
Consolidation on the acquiring side has resulted in
the entry of third-party processors with little or no interest in
the issuing side of the business.  Moreover, the proposition that
banking can retain control of the retail payment system in the
upcoming years is very much open to debate.  The largest bank
card processor today by a substantial margin is not a bank but
First Data Resources, a subsidiary--most troubling of all to bank
card issuers--of American Express.

      The top 10 issuers of bank cards in the late 1990s probably
will not be banks, noted David Poe, a principal with Edgar, Dunn
& Conover.  Of the top 10 acquirers at present, 4 of the
processors on the acquiring side of the merchant business account
for some 45% of the volume in dollars, he said.
     In addition, processors have developed innovations aimed at
certain market  segments, such as electronic draft capture (EDC)
and low-cost authorization.
     Non-bank competitors such as American Express and Sears,
Roebuck & Co. are gaining control of more point-of-sale (POS)
terminals, as several banks have given up the merchant side of
the business.
     The card system is opening up to yet more competition.
Namely, Ford Motor Co., General Electric (GE) Credit, Household
Bank of Chicago, General Motors, and--potentially posing the
greatest threat of all--American Telephone & Telegraph Co.
(AT&T).
     The acquiring business is consolidating because of the
inability of many banks to remain competitive in the merchant
marketplace.  "Rather than sell their portfolios to their banking
competitors, most banks have chosen to sell to non-banks," stated
Charles Russell, CEO of Visa U.S.A.
     One recent exception to that trend was the acquisition by
Citicorp--one of the largest card processors--of the merchant
card business of FCC National Bank, a wholly owned subsidiary of
First Chicago Corp.  But many industry analysts think the
merchant business will remain within banking only in rare
instances such as this.
     Sears Payment Systems recently announced it will process the
$60 million private-label card portfolio of Lochmere Inc., a
retailer In Woburn, Mass.

  Invading others' turfs

     Deregulation in the 1980s provided the card industry
tremendous freedom with regard to pricing flexibility.  The
decade saw the emergence of annual and  other fees, competitive
pricing, and much pressure on interest rates and annual fees from
new entrants into the marketplace.
     During the period, there were also the first signs of
saturation, slow growth, and lower response rates to mailings.
The merger and acquisition mania also began with Chemical Bank's
acquisition of Continental's card portfolio.   Bank cards began
trying to increase their share of the lucrative travel and
entertainment (T&E) market long dominated by American Express,
which made its own entree into the large, mainstream retail
markets.
     Another development of the 1980s, the issuing of securities
backed by credit card receivables, now accounts for billions of
dollars of securitized assets in this country.
     Citicorp, which has securitized close to $8 billion in card
receivables,  now is offering $750 million in bonds in its
largest overseas issue to date backed by receivables generated in
the United States.  Sears also is considering the distribution
outside the country of its own card outstandings.   In the
present market, the name of the game is differentiation.  "Our
prime directive is to tailor products and services to meet the
specific consumer's needs," Russell said.
     Segmentation became a buzzword in the 1980s as it pertained
to gold, affinity, business and student cards.  There was a new
focus on customer service by the card industry and a growth in
national solicitations, spelling the end of only regional and
statewide marketing.
     Bank cards now face increasing competition from all sides.
In already trying to accommodate the demands of individual market
segments, bank cards are accepted for payment in supermarkets,
fast-food restaurants, movie theaters, parking lots, toll booths,
and the health-care industry.  Part of the emphasis here is on
speed in the card authorization and purchase process.
     When Sears introduced its Discover card in early 1986, the
growth of consumer credit was at its peak, noted Carl Steidtmann,
vice president for senior management and chief economist at
Management Horizons, a division of Price Waterhouse.
     In the realm of differentiated offerings, Discover is
selling a cashback feature that no other bank or non-bank card
has.

  Potential new products

     But we may be entering a period when a similar opportunity
exists for the introduction of new products.  The reason is that
the burst of activity in the early 1990s probably will be the
last peak of credit growth in the 1990s, Steidtmann pointed out.
     Others contend that new product introduction remains
increasingly diffi-cult.  "We're not in the same cooperative
relationship that we all used to be in when everything was done
within the banking community," said Poe.
     In this decade, many observers say, it will be necessary to
better understand the data reflecting what is taking place within
the customer base that bank cards now have.  Financial
institutions will need information even more to manage the risk
of credit cards, noted Donald Auriemma, president of Auriemma
Consulting Group in Garden City, N.Y.
     The 1990s will see, for the first time in a decade and a
half, a rising savings rate, Steidtmann said.  This will happen
primarily for reasons related to demographics.
     The savers currently are people between ages 45 and 60.  The
savings rate did not decline due to tax law changes, individual
retirement accounts (IRAs), or even societal greed, Steidtmann
said.  The real reason was demographics because in the 1980s the
number of people in the key savings sector went down.  In the
previous decade, the growth of installment credit was
unprecedented, driven largely by the demographics of the time and
a fairly stable economic environment.  While the economy at
present is robust, the 1990s has been projected as an era in
which unemployment and the demand for credit will fall.
     With low unemployment, people from a lower socioeconomic
level will enter the mainstream of the economy, resulting in an
increased penetration of cards.  Aside from more savings, there
will be more looking for ways to reduce one's own credit
exposure, Steidtmann said.  "What previously had gone into debt
payment and into the creation of debt will now go into savings,"
he added.      Demographics, to the extent they indicate a
turning against the credit culture, pose an unpromising picture
for credit in the 1990s.  The growth of
income also will have an effect on credit in the new decade.
There will be average rates of growth in income but a significant
change in the distribution of income.
     The demand for credit will decline, not relatively but in
absolute terms.  Households will not have the same demand for
credit as has been the case.
     The issue of market share will become critical to third-
party, bank, and proprietary cards.  The 1990s should see a
reduced demand for proprietary cards with the trend toward
reducing credit.

Squeeze on small issuers

     Market share will be the essential component in any AT&T
credit card product that enters the market.  The share and card
base that AT&T could draw on, in terms of its calling card
population, represents a huge potential marketing advantage.  If
the telecommunications giant offers a cobranded Visa card, for
example, it will most likely be at the expense of the cards that
cardholders already have.
     In the 1980s, the growth of private-label credit cards was
not nearly as great as that of bank cards.  There has been a move
within the large sector of retailers to come back to private-
label cards because of the enhanced marketing  capabilities
provided to them, such as target promotions and more information
about the consumers who buy in their stores.
     "Our perspective is that private-label credit cards or
proprietary credit cards, merchants' own programs, probably will
not grow in terms of total numbers of accounts, as far as the
bank card market will grow in the next few years," observed Larry
Myatt of Sears Payment Systems.

  Third-party bank cards

     However, he thinks there is good growth prospect for those
third-party processors--like Sears Payment--in devising private
label programs for merchants, as retailers look at the costs
associated with operating their own programs.  Therefore, a shift
from in-house to third-party operated programs is expected.
     Those who maintain their own credit card system in-house now
will look to third-party processors for other ways of maintaining
that capability because of the costs of new systems and
equipment.  There is expected to be more movement  toward third-
party processors maintaining the retailer card base than any
changes in or out of the private label business.
     If strategic alliances can be formed between both credit
offerers and retailers, the opportunity may be created for third-
party offerings to develop  in the arena of bank card credit.
This is probably the one component of the industry that will
experience growth in the 1990s, due to its ability to offer many
of the benefits of a proprietary card at the cost of a bank card,
according to Steidtmann.
     Such alliances will have to be based on joint marketing, on
providing information through the channel of distribution, the
quality of service, the ability to bring customers to a retailer
who would not go there otherwise, and on a much less expensive
economic model.
     This outcome is not likely to come about unless the view of
credit and retail executives toward credit moves from competition
and confrontation to one of cooperation, Myatt added.
     In terms of other payment mechanisms, many observers see an
enormous untapped market for debit cards at the point of sale--in
the form of proprietary debit, automated clearing house (ACH)
debit or direct debit.
     ACH debit is expected to be a very active means of payment
in the 1990s, Myatt said.  Part of its implementation was delayed
over the controversy in-volving Entree, the national POS debit
mark that MasterCard and Visa had been jointly developing.
     An antitrust lawsuit filed last summer by the attorneys
general in New York and in 12 states has stalled that program
indefinitely, if not permanently.
     ACH debit has been touted as a national debit card operated
through a bank card-like mechanism, as Entree was proposed to be.
In addition, American Express or Discover could offer this
product with their own cards.
     The other ACH vehicle is private-label debit, in which the
retailer itself--California's Vons Supermarket is one example--is
the card issuer.  In the 1980s, the financial and retail sectors
were hesitant about whether banks would take the lead in debit
cards or if that drive would be spearheaded by individual
retailers.
     It makes sense from a consumer standpoint to be able to have
a debit card that can be used at a variety of retail
establishments, Myatt told us.
     "Frankly, we have a lot of concerns about ACH-driven
products unless they are bank controlled and bank driven," said
MasterCard's Hart.
     The origin of a proprietary debit environment is akin to
private-label credit cards in that the objective is the
generation of additional sales volume and added customer
convenience.   Proponents see private-label debit making sense in
supermarkets where a lot of checks are now written, and at
gasoline stations where there already exist examples of
proprietary debit cards.

  New decade's trends

     Some of the trends in the 1990s will no doubt be
continuations of existing  developments.  Insiders stress that
the card industry must know the true net costs when features are
added to cards or efforts are made to attract different customer
segments.  Additionally, the industry will require better product
and customer profitability information, and it is looking toward
the development of systems that allow making those kinds of
determinations.
     Further segmentation of card products needs to be in terms
of segregating  between convenience users and revolvers.
Questions to be addressed include  whether to increase spending
allowed on a credit limit, and permitting the use of a card on a
monthly basis as a charge card--with a line of credit still the
foundation for an account.
     The 1990s are certain to bring a substantial increase in
non-bank card competition.  JCB, Japan's largest bank-issued
credit card, is seeking to be-come a major world player and to
increase its merchant network outside Japan.
     The card already is moving to overtake Diners Club.  JCB can
offer the card electronically, can come in and negotiate with a
relatively few processors and reach a large percentage of retail
establishments.
     One new product likely to emerge in the future is a coin
replacement card, or possibly a pre-paid card, for handling small
transactions.
     From all indications, there is strong interest in the United
States in chip technology and, specifically, in the integrated
circuit chip capabilities of smart cards.  Unlike in Japan and
Europe, the cards have no proximity to their source in the United
States, and have been more difficult to implement. Smart cards
offer potentially many variables and, for that reason, U.S. banks
are less inclined to agree on the direction in which to proceed,
noted Kevin Wilby, vice president of the retail transaction
division at Business Modeling Techniques Inc. (BMT) in Rochester,
N.Y.  On top of that, the first demand in this country would be
for the institution of smart card standards--which poses a much
more difficult task than the magnetic stripe that reflects a
standard format, he said.
     Consolidation and internationalization in the industry is
expected to continue, with more pressure to process transactions
inexpensively.  Besides controlling operating expenses, many
officials see a need for behavioral scoring at the point of sale
to minimize the number of declines in the system.  The
enhancement of this intelligence at the point of sale will be a
factor in controlling credit losses.
     Aside from network and communications enhancements to
support this new level of intelligence in database management,
the focus will continue on making investments in systems and on
the maximizing of efficiencies.

NEW YORK STATE LAW BARS MERCHANTS FROM
REQUIRING ADDRESSES ON CARD SALES SLIPS

     A new law that took effect last week in New York state,
reportedly the first of its kind in the nation, prohibits
merchants from requiring customers to put their address or
telephone number on sales slips when making purchases by credit
card.
     This controversial practice--along with that of recording
credit card numbers on personal checks when a purchase is made by
check--has been sharply criticized by consumer advocates, who
have maintained that merchants are exposing customers to
potential fraud and are violating their personal privacy (CN,
Oct. 30, 1989, p. 1).
     The state law will "address the unauthorized dissemination
of personal information," said Daniel Feldman, a state
assemblyman who sponsored the bill.  He also introduced
legislation last year that mandated carbonless credit card forms
in New York.
     While both the Visa and MasterCard associations appeared
uneasy over con-sumers being made to write their card number, its
expiration date and a phone number on checks, they have focused
more attention on ending the requirement by  merchants that a
cardholder's phone number be written on a credit card sales draft
in order to complete a card transaction.
     The Bankcard Holders of America (BHA), a Herndon, Va.-based
consumer education group, has urged the 2 bankcard associations
and the National Retail Merchants Association (NRMA), among
others, to clarify and enforce policies to bar the current check-
cashing policies of merchants.
     Visa and MasterCard spokesmen have said the associations
have a limited ability to take action in response to these check
acceptance procedures.  The bank card industry has rules in place
to protect itself against liability for the use of a credit card
to pay for returned checks.
     A number of merchants in the state were convincing customers
that their address and phone number were necessary to make credit
card purchases, Feldman  said, when the information actually was
being used to compile mailing lists.    One exception to the law
is that merchants who do not have the capability to verify a
customer's card electronically may still ask for a customer's
address or phone number.  The penalty for violations of the law
is $250.

CHASE TO ACQUIRE CARD PORTFOLIOS WITH COMBINED
OUTSTANDINGS OF $660 MILLION

     The Chase Manhattan Bank (USA), the Delaware affiliate of
Chase Manhattan Bank, will acquire the credit card portfolio of
Bank of Boston Corp. and its affiliate, Bank of Boston
Connecticut.  In addition, Chase has acquired the majority of the
credit card portfolio of Investors Savings Bank of Richmond, Va.
     The combined outstandings of the MasterCard and Visa
portfolios represent  $660 million.  The Bank of Boston portfolio
has $625 million in outstandings, and the outstanding balances of
Investors portfolio are approximately $35 million.
     Last year, Chase also purchased the portfolios of Michigan
National Bank, Meritor Financial Group of Philadelphia, and
Leader Federal Savings Bank in Memphis, Tenn.
     Bank of Boston, in a move similar to the response of other
New England institutions to the region's slumping real estate
market, said it would write off about $300 million in loans for
the final quarter of 1989 and set aside about $280 million for
other possible losses.  But the company predicted it would break
even in the fourth quarter and earn a $145 million profit for
1989, due in part to its decision to sell its credit card
business, which has 675,000 cardholders.
     Bank officials said the card business, while profitable,
would drain financial resources that the bank would rather put
toward marketing other consumer products such as home equity,
residential mortgages and education loans.
     The Investors portfolio includes approximately 40,000
MasterCard and Visa accounts.  The institution also has entered
into an agent bank agreement with Chase under which it will
continue to offer credit cards bearing the Investors name and
logo to its customers throughout Virginia.  In the future, the
accounts of Investors' existing card customers will be serviced
by Chase with no disruption in service.

*New Jersey Transit Corp., a commuter bus and
rail system, will allow commuters to use credit
cards to pay for tickets starting in the fall.  The
system already accepts Visa, MasterCard, and Dis-
cover cards at a number of agent sites and ticket
vending machines.  This project, which is being developed at
Nynex Information Solutions Group, will allow commuters at a
later point to have their accounts  debited for ticket purchases.
Nynex is linking all credit card ticketing operations, permitting
New Jersey Transit to cut costs by negotiating the lowest prices
from suppliers of credit authorization and settlement services.
New Jersey Transit is now discussing joint ticketing with the
Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the umbrella organization
for several New York-area mass transit operations.  The New York
City Transit Authority, the Metro North and the Long Island
Railroad commuter trains plan to offer ticket payment options
that would automatically debit bank accounts.

     *Telephone calls made by credit card at the 2 Philadelphia

     *Telephone calls made by credit card at the 2 Philadelphia
area airports will be among the options provided by MCI Mid-
Atlantic under a new major contract for public pay phone service.
     The 3-year, $10.5 million agreement, between the city of
Philadelphia and MCI Mid-Atlantic, will provide long-distance
service to pay phone customers at Philadelphia International and
Northeast Philadelphia Airports.  MCI will provide "0" plus
services to customers making collect, third-party, person-to-
person and credit card calls at any of the 550 pay phones at both
airports.  This development is part of the implementation of
equal access at public pay phones that was decreed by court order
for non-AT&T carriers.  The order, in a 1988 decision by U.S.
District Judge Harold Greene, covers calls made on cards as well
as other operator-assisted calls.  The national pay phone market
is estimated to be worth $2 billion a year.  "Pay phone premise
owners and managers--particularly high-volume users such as
municipalities, airports, hotels and such--can receive
substantial benefits through MCI now that the pay phone market is
a matter of choice," said George Taylor, president of MCI's Mid-
Atlantic Division which covers customers in Pennsylvania, New
Jersey, Delaware, West Virginia, Maryland, Virginia and the
District of Columbia.

AIR TRAVEL CARD ADDING INTERNATIONAL CAPABILITIES FOR WORLDWIDE
PHONE CALL CHARGES

     Air Travel Card and Executive TeleCard Ltd.
have announced an agreement to permit cardholders to  charge
international telephone calls on their Air Travel Card account.
This makes Air Travel Card and its licensee cards, "AirPlus" in
Europe and "Passage"  in the Far East, the first corporate travel
card to offer a worldwide telephone  charge system to its
members.
     Designed as a card product for executive travelers wanting
to make direct dial or operator-assisted international calls, Air
Travel Card enables members to have easy access to more than 60
countries where the system is in operation.  The services
provided by the Switzerland-based Executive TeleCard allow
telephone users to charge calls between countries outside the
United States.
     This umbrella agreement invites each of Air Travel Card's 30
issuing airlines to enter into separate contracts with Executive
TeleCard in the upcoming months.  A number of the issuing
airlines already have expressed an interest in this optional
service for their customers.
     "We are proud to offer this one-of-a-kind telephone charge
system and look forward to featuring it as one of Air Travel
Card's unique customer benefits,"  said Charles Fischer,
executive secretary for Air Travel Card.

  Card eliminates phoning obstacles

     The Executive TeleCard System, which can be accessed from
both private and public telephones worldwide, eliminates the many
problems often posed by language barriers, confusing instructions
and coin-operated pay phones, ex-plained Robert Roach, president
of Executive TeleCard.  It also avoids the surcharges that are
customarily applied by hotels.
     "The Air Travel Card customer is a perfect match to
Executive TeleCard's product line," Roach said.  "We are
enthusiastic about this agreement and look forward to providing
