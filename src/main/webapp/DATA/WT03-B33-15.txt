impression, so I empty my IN tray into the bin. Now that's what I call
efficient!

I log in to my account and there's three helpdesk mail requests, all
ticking away to expiration, then escalation, then further escalation,
then followup mail message, then even further escalation, then 2nd
follow-up mail and casual phone call, then still further escalation,
then non-casual phone call, then threats, then, ultimately, and sadly,
violence. But not so sadly that I won't resort to it. And they know I
will too...

Because I used to be... the Bastard Operator From Hell!
 ...and sometimes, late at night I get these twitches. Like dead people
get. (Or, as I prefer to call them, perfect computer users)
In the mornings I get them too. Like when the phone rings. And when I
get e-mail. And when people talk to me. AND when people are hogging the
expresso machine to make fluffy milk. But apart from that I'm cured. A
new man.

I smile at the thought and look, in reminiscence, at some reminders of
my past.

A couple of backup eight-mm tapes with cartoons on them. The thank-you
cards for my attendance at 23 separate funerals of computer center
staff. The 230V AC mains plug with the thinwire ethernet plug at the
end. I didn't ever get round to trying that one either, so I don't even
know what it would've done.

I'm bored.

The Bastard Operator From Hell steps up the ladder... he's now the
Bastard System Manager From Hell

I get up and slip a fingerprint-free magnet on top of the reed switch
that the Boss had installed in my display cabinet while I was on
holiday, then pry the glass door open with a screwdriver. As far as I
can figure, the switch is supposed to ring an alarm if the door is
opened.

Silence. I grab my etherkiller and wander down the hallway to the
switchboard, applying another magnet and opening that to silence as
well.

That's what's missing in society today trust.

I pull the 15-amp breaker for the meeting room, then wander on round and
plug the etherkiller into a cheap timer set to 5 minutes from now. On
the way back to the switchboard I hear the first few murmurs about
excessive collisions. I plug in my unpatented nail "fuse" (estimated
fault current 200-300 amps) with a set of heavily insulated pliers and
wander off to the tea-room to start my expresso brew. Halfway through
the make, the machine stops. Now that's what I call a collision.

I look around in a bewildered manner as panic erupts on all sides,
half-made expresso in my hand. I step out into the hallway and behold
pandemonium. Two programmers are fighting over a CO2 fire extinguisher
in an effort to put their terminals out. I wander down to my room just
as my X terminal, the unreliable piece of excretia it is, flames it's
last and lapses into a dull smoulder.

"My cabinet!" I cry in `horror' and hear the extinguisher struggle end
abruptly. In a flash the two programmers concerned are behind me staring
into my room. Shortly thereafter the boss runs up as well.

"What's this magnet for?" I ask, picking it up and hearing a bell start
chiming in the distance.

"You bastard!" one of the programmers utters.

"I'm sorry?" I ask, turning.

"YOU did it didn't you?"
"What? Break into my own cabinet? But I've got a key."
That's the terrible burden of proof really in this day and age, you
need some to make an accusation.

The late-breaking news comes in that one of the consultants had a set
of head-phones plugged into a CD-ROM drive hanging off their networked
PC. But not anymore. Now there's an unexpected vacancy in the
department. I blame the Ethernet Isolation specs. Three kV my backside!
Soon, I'm helping the police with their enquiries.

"What is this, can you tell me?" a burly officer asks, right up in my
face. He holds up a magnet.

"It's a magnet. There was one on my cabinet!" I cry.

"Yes. And where did you get them?" he asks, seizing control...

 ...and losing it.

On my cabinet! I just said!"

"No, not this one. The others. Where did you get them?"

"Others? What others? You mean there were more on my cabinet! Why?" (I
can play the "stupid game" forever, having had years of education at the
hands of users.) ...

A couple of hours later I'm back at my desk with Mr Lucky, no charges
pressed. I close my cabinet, satisfaction mine for the first time in a
long while.

Then the phone rings...

I get a call from the big boss he's been getting complaints about the
trainee bastard operator from hell. I ask him to forward all the
complaints to me and that it would be best to let me deal with them. I
ring the operator and get him to make an appointment with me.

Two weeks later, he does, and I show him the complaints that have
accumulated so far.

Seventy Three complaints in your first three weeks!" I say "It's
good but it's NOT Good Enough! You should be getting at least 10
complaints a day AT LEAST!

Now, let's see what you're doing wrong: You get a call from a user what
do you do?"

"Kill them off?" The TBOFH replies

"NO! How can you kill them off if you don't know their USERNAME? Your
FIRST priority is to get their username. Then what would you do?"

"Kill them off?"

"NO! Get them to tell you what their problem is!"

"Why?

"Because later I can say they didn't explain their problem to you
properly. It's a great defence works every time. A user rings me up to
complain; I listen to their problem, then say "Oh, when you said `my PC
doesn't work' he must have thought you meant `how can I make my PC never
work again and destroy my life's work at the same time?' it happens all
the time!' Then they tell me implausible that is, I say how terribly
sorry we are, then fake some connect and CPU time records so their
monthly bill is about the same as the Uraguayan national debt. So, after
you've heard their problem, what do you do?"

"Kill them off?"

"NO! Then you make up some excuse. Have you got an excuse card
calendar?"

"Uh. No.."

"And you said you were qualified to operate a computer! You'd better
have mine." I pass my computer card calendar over, flipping it to page
one "ENTROPY"....... ...I like it.

Now, you give the cretin an excuse. Then what do you do?"

"Kill them off?"

"YES!" (He certainly has a fixation) "Then what?"

"Hang up?

" "NO! Then they'll call you back when the problem recurs. Your job is
to make them FEAR calling you. How can you work when people are calling?
So, you make them pay for calling in the first place. What would you
do?"

"Delete their files?"

"Yeah, it's a start, but then they may call back when they get new
files. You want them NEVER to call back. What could you do?"
Swear at them?"

"No. I can see we'll have to demonstrate. Have you got a metal
ballpoint?"

Yes"

"See that wallsocket over there. Take the refill out of the pen and poke
in into the wallsocket."

"But it's live!"

"Would I really make you do it if it were live?" "
Oh." *fiddle* *fiddle* BZZZZZZZEEEEERT!

Of course I would. He was no good anyway.

LEISURE - BOOKS: LEARNING DELPHI THE DUMMIES WAY

from PC QUEST (India), OCTOBER, 1996

by VKT

This book is already into its second edition, and Rubenking has done a
good job. However, it is not intended for any dummy programmer.

The book starts with a formal introduction to Delphi (as is traditional
with a Delphi tutorial) covering the most important component of
Delphi the form component. Then it goes on with using other components
explaining the basics of how they are arranged on the component palette,
how to include them in your application, how to set their properties,
and how to write the event handlers. The author then discusses the
components on the standard palette, the dialog components and the menu
components.

This follows a comprehensive discussion on a variety of the additional
and advanced components, file components and database components all on
the palette along with all their important properties and events. The
text is laced with examples that range from simple to smart. In deed the
thoroughness with which the author covers the ground makes this an ideal
text book for discussion on Delphi components the informal presentation
notwithstanding.

The book also deals with Win 95 components and two chapters on Delphi
programming that cover units, form files, projects, resources, major
features of Object Pascal, and writing and debugging code. The usual
Dummies feature "Parts of Ten" offers a chapter each for Ten Common
Mistakes, Ten Windows API functions and Ten Fabulous Functions Families.

This is probably the best starter for aspiring Delphi programmers that
we've come across recently. And even for experienced programmers, its
comprehensive coverage of all the components on the palette make it a
worthwhile quick reference. The best part is its price; to use a cliche
it is a steal.

LEISURE - BOOKS: MULTIMEDIA ADVENTURE WITH VISUAL C++

from PC QUEST (India), OCTOBER, 1996

by VK Thakur

This book covers advanced Windows multimedia programming techniques in
Visual C++ 2.x and is aimed at advanced Visual C++ programmers. Since
Visual C++ is very close to the Windows API, even Visual Basic, Delphi
and Pascal programmers with a penchant for resorting to Windows API
would find the book extremely useful.

The authors have gone to a considerable extent in explaining the
fundamentals and the techniques rather than just throwing a lot of
arcane C++ code at the reader. So, it is easier for a developer using a
different development environment to port the code that comes in this
book to the environment of his/her choice.

The initial chapters cover basic HyperMedia and teach you how to create
HyperText jumps with the CScrollView class of the MS Foundation Classes.

This is followed by an introduction to the Windows Multimedia System
with examples on how to use sndPlaySound() function and the high level
mciSendString() and mciSendCommand() interfaces.

Next, the authors concentrate on Imaging. After an introduction to
bitmaps and palette management the pace gets lively as the authors
provide a delightful insight into Palette Animation, ROPs and special
visual effects (such as Dissolves). With the pace still lively, the
authors return to HyperMedia this time focusing on HyperImaging. They
start with the code for a simple hotspot editor and went on building a
full-fledged hotspot editor that can mark irregular regions of an image
as hotspots. The discussion ends with a full-featured HyperMedia engine.

The reader is then taken through a breathtaking journey into the
wonderworld of animation simple as well as sprite. The book also covers
how to play audio CDs, the MIDI standard, and the MCIWnd interface for
playing AVI files.

It comes with a CD-ROM packed with the source code and executable of
the impressive projects, such as the sprite and HyperMedia engines,
covered in the book. Besides, the CD-ROM lets you have a look at some
useful shareware apps as well as video clips, sound files and music.

Multimedia programming is arguably the most difficult type of
programming that requires skills as well as imagination. If you want to
join the select band of multimedia application developers, not by using
authoring tools but a programming environment, this book is for you.

LEISURE - BOOKS: NETWORKING IN PLAIN ENGLISH

from PC QUEST (India), OCTOBER, 1996

by PR

Doug's style of presenting technophobic stuff is both funny and
encouraging. However, the absence of effective illustrations may divert
your attention from the boring text-only approach. Although
well-written, unlike most of his other titles, this book does not assume
readers to be dummies. It takes a straight-forward approach to demystify
the magic that allows you to share a printer or to exchange documents
electronically with your colleagues and friends.

All the 30 odd chapters in the book by and large center around Novell
NetWare. Written in a logical sequence, each one covers a specific
aspect of networking network hardware, printer sharing, network
security, trouble shooting, connecting to the Internet, and building an
intranet infrastructure. Interestingly, it's more like a reference you
won't have to go through cover to cover just turn to the chapter you're
interested in and start reading.

Each chapter is further divided into self-contained modules that all
relate to a basic theme. For instance, Using Network Printers contains
nuggets such as ports and printer configuration, redirecting printer
output, playing with the print queue and what to do when the printer
jams. Network Security deals with user accounts, passwords, privileges
and access rights, and tips for managing multiple servers.

The title also packs a variety of icons corresponding to different types
of technical tips, tricks and warnings. For instance, a warning to the
network administrator regarding the authorization of user accounts says:
"Beware of the all-encompassing "*" wildcard. If your network has an
account whose user ID is simply "*", delete it as soon as you've created
your permanent accounts. The "*" account allows anyone to access the
system, no matter what user ID he or she enters."

The other stuff you can extract from this guide is a variety of
interesting and informative tips on advanced networking features,
including remote networking, connecting to the Internet, and creating
your own intranet. However, the information on sharing CD-ROM drives or
a Fax, setting up a voice mail system, playing network games,
understanding Internet addressing, setting up an Internet/intranet site
using popular Web servers including MS Internet Information Server and
NCSA HTTPd, could have been more informative.

An extensive "Part of Tens" is the most encouraging module of this
particular Dummies title. This includes 10 Big Network Mistakes, 10
Network Gizmos (Only Big Networks Need), tips on networking Windows for
Workgroups 3.11 and Macs, and information on a variety of programs that
make networking easier. There are also three comprehensive command
references on NetWare, LANtastic and Windows (WFW 3.11, Win NT, and Win
95) networking to help keep your network under control. This title won't
make you a network expert; nor would you find it interesting if you
don't like reading long text-only articles. However, it's definitely a
good and handy reference for most local area networking needs.

LEISURE - BOOKS: A CRASH COURSE ON NETWORKING

from PC QUEST (India), OCTOBER, 1996

by Pinaki Ray

If you use Novell NetWare and find it very complicated, this book is for
you. The first 24 chapters are so well written that you can master these
concepts in so many days, by devoting at least two hours a day to each.

Take another six days to practice what you've learned, and you will find
your so-called `stupid' network as friendly as it could ever be .And to
make your job even easier, there are handy command references for
NetWare (versions 3.x and 4.x), Personal NetWare, LAN-tastic, Windows
for Workgroups 3.11 and Windows NT.

The book follows a step-by-step approach to help you get going smoothly.

It begins by unveiling the basics Cabling, Network Interface Cards,
Topology, Hub, Network Operating Systems, and File Server the very least
you need to know about networking. However, if you want to skip any,
"The Least You Need To Know" section, at the end of each chapter, might
prove sufficient. (Although the author could have packed more
interesting information in each of them.)

To illustrate different end-user features, the book takes a parallel
approach for both DOS and Windows for Workgroups users. The most
frequently used NetWare features such as MAP, NLIST, FLAG, NDIR, NWUSER,
NETUSER, SALVAGE, and FILER have been discussed in detail with
appropriate illustrations. Chapters on network security, printer
sharing, communicating on a network (using Lotus cc:Mail), and NetWare
troubleshooting are written carefully, so that readers won't get
confused while applying them in real-life situations.

Finally, the author helps you build your own network from installing and
configuring network cards to setting up a peer-to-peer LAN using Windows
for Workgroups. You may never need to build one from scratch, but seeing
how it's done can also guide you through the tasks for connecting a new
computer to an existing network.

Although the book has a ctually nothing to do with NetWare
administrators, it is still highly recommended for novice NetWare users
who want to use common sense to stay connected.

NEWS WORLDWATCH: VIRTUA FIGHTER KIDS FOR SEGA SATURN RELEASED

from PC QUEST (India), OCTOBER, 1996

You'd have a big head too if you were the newest addition to one of the
most successful fighting franchises in the video game industry. US-based
Sega (www.sega.com) has given `birth' to Virtua Fighter Kids (VFK) for
Sega Saturn. The mega-hit arcade game in Japan is a sequel (or
`pre-quel' biologically speaking) to Virtua Fighter 2, the best-selling
Sega Saturn game.

All 10 Virtua Fighter 2 characters are in `half-pint' proportions except
their heads which are 10 times normal size and designed as the child
version of each fighter. The result: 20 percent faster action with
crystal-clear facial expressions that add more emotion. VFK is a direct
translation to the 32-bit Sega Saturn video game console. And as Sega's
ST-V arcade board is compatible with the Saturn hardware, perfect
conversion is possible. The moves are the same as Virtua Fighter 2, but
the smaller body proportions of VFK characters give players an ability
to create new move.

The Options menu lets players chain together various moves and adjust
their timing. Complex combinations that previously required multiple
directional and action key strokes can be activated with one button. The
new Kid's mode lets players unfamiliar with the controls perform the
appropriate moves by pressing the buttons randomly perfect for younger
children or inexperienced players. Other new features include a short
instant replay during play, , a computer graphics opening movie that
shows each character in both traditional and `kids' sizes, and a reward
movie showing the Kids' characters private lives. The game costs $50.

from PC QUEST (India), OCTOBER, 1996

With its corporate focus on the company's traditional photographic
business as well as new digital imaging markets, Eastman Kodak in
Rochester, New York, has sold its money-losing $1.8 billion-a-year
copier and printer business to UK-based Danka Business Systems for $684

industry leader Xerox while losing additional marketshare to competitors
such as Canon and Konica.

Under deal, Kodak will continue to manufacture and sustain its copier
line, while Danka, will sell and service the machines. Danka will also
take over some of Kodak's assets and operating liabilities, while Kodak
will retain $123 million in receivables stemming from long-term copier
leases in Britain and Canada. Danka officials said they plan to offer
jobs to the more than 10,000 Kodak copier sales workforce, including

NEWS WORLDWATCH: TOSHIBA TAKES A PAGE FROM SONY'S US HOME PC STRATEGY

from PC QUEST (India), OCTOBER, 1996

Following in the footsteps of Sony, Toshiba announced its entry into the
US home PC market with its Infinia line that offer advanced multimedia,
and bear close resemblance to the company's other consumer electronics
products.

Like Sony, Toshiba's plans to slowly roll the PCs out into the US market
which has been stubbornly resistant to Japanese-made desktop PC. The
company will make only three models available initially, and sell them
through a handful of carefully selected retailers in key regional
markets. Unlike Sony, however, Toshiba already enjoys a leadership
position in the US notebook computer market. Tom Scott, head of
Toshiba's US PC operations, said, Toshiba hopes to rank as the fifth
largest PC vendor in the US by the end of 1997.

To entice users, Toshiba has built a number of button controls into the
Infinia system, most of them located on the monitor. These control
functions such as volume, base, tremble, and brightness. The Infinia
also doubles as a TV or radio. In those modes, the buttons change
functions to those of a TV.

The three models have Pentium processors, with varying RAM, disk drive
capacity, and a 28.8 kbps modem, are priced between $1,699 and $2,799. A
15" monitor with stereo speakers adds $449 to the price tag.

NEWS WORLDWATCH: TOSHIBA'S NEW DVD LASER CAN PUT 15 GB ON SINGLE SIDE
DISK

from PC QUEST (India), OCTOBER, 1996

In another potential blow to the Sony-Philips digital video disk (DVD)
alliance, Toshiba has announced the availability of a blue-purple
semiconductor laser that allows for up to 15 GB of data to be stored on
a single-sided disk. By comparison, the red laser used in the
Sony/Philips DVD system stores a mere 5 GB on each of a two-sided disk.

Toshiba's laser generates a 417 nanometer wavelength at room
temperature, compared to the 650 nanometer wavelength of the red laser.

The blue-purple laser is based on a gallium-nitride compound. With a
capacity of 15 GB, the Toshiba disks would offer enough storage capacity
for full length movies with substantially less compression requirement.

NEWS WORLDWATCH: CIRRUS LOGIC LAUNCHES NEW CD-RECORDABLE/ERASABLE CHIPS

from PC QUEST (India), OCTOBER, 1996

Cirrus Logic Inc (www.cirrus. com/) has introduced the industry's
fastest encoder/decoder chips for CD-ROM applications. These support
CD-Recordable/Erasable (CD-R/E) formats that allow the end-user to
record, erase and re-use the CD-ROM. Available in SCSI interface
(CL-CR3560) and ATAPI interface (CL-CR3460) versions, the encoders also
support the industry's fastest 18X read and 8X record disk speeds. The
new chips are fully compatible with all CD-writing methods. And also
support Sony-Philips CD-ROM, CD-I, and CD-DA (Digital Audio) formats,
for use with all implementations of CD technology. The chips are
equipped with a CD-ROM encoder/decoder, CIRC encoder, EFM modulator,
ATIP decoder, SCSI or ATAPI interface.

The CL-CR3560 has a single-ended SCSI interface with integrated 48 mA
bus drivers. The chip supports the SCSI-2 industry standard, making it
compatible with a wide variety of peripherals. The CR3560 is also
SCAM-compatible, conforming to the latest updates of the SCSI
specification. The CL-CR3460 is the ATAPI equivalent high-performance
CD-R/E encoder/decoder. The ATAPI interface permits the CD-ROM to share
the ATA bus of the host computer with existing ATA/IDE hard disk drives.

Both devices combine fast error correction and the capability to read
damaged disks on-the-fly to provide the industry's most advanced data
integrity protection.

NEWS WORLDWATCH: IBM & 15 BANKS TEAM UP ON E-BANKING

from PC QUEST (India), OCTOBER, 1996

Two years ago, Microsoft CEO Bill Gates said that today's banking
institutions were `dinosaurs' waiting to be overtaken by a new
electronic banking order where Microsoft would play a central role.

Gates has since regretted the statement, as the banking industry has
looked every which way since to keep him out.

Now 15 leading US banks have formed Integrion Financial Network an
alliance with IBM to support a new financial network that will provide a
broad range of electronic banking services to customers. And that too
without paying royalties to Microsoft, Intuit, or other e-banking
supplier. Integrion will enable bank customers to check their balances,
transfer money between accounts, pay bills, shop electronically on the
Internet, send e-mail messages to their bank, and even arrange for loans
on major electronic purchases. In the future, the network can be used to
trade securities, get stock quotes, and get access to their mutual
funds. Although only 15 banks have signed up, Integrion will be open to
any bank.

The move appears a setback to Gates' hopes for the banking community, as
outlined in a 1994 Fall Comdex video presentation, where Microsoft
envisioned people using Windows-controlled devices instead of cash,
credit or bank cards. In Gates' vision, computer users can establish
electronic credit accounts to shop both in cyberspace and in the real
world.

With Integrion, customers can shop on the Internet, and access their
accounts through their bank's Web site which can be directly accessed or
through services such as America Online and CompuServe. User can either
pay directly or click a "Financing" button at the vendor's Web site.

This connects the user to a bank on the Integrion network that
determines the customer's credit worthiness.

MULTITASKING WITH DOS: GENERATE A BACKGROUND WITH TINY DARTS SHOOTING ALL
OVER THE SCREEN

from PC QUEST (India), OCTOBER, 1996

While today's operating systems usually  have multitasking built-in,
good old  DOS users too could  do with a bit of it. Hooks and TSR
programs can be used to provide some rudimentary multithreading even
with a normal DOS program.

Interrupt 8h is the timer interrupt and is called by the system 18.2
times a second (actually 91 times in 5 seconds). This is used to update
the system clock and perform other regular updates. This interrupt can
be captured and pointed to your own procedure, making sure it is called
several times a second. However, there is one disadvantage Int 8h is a
sensitive interrupt where delays can cause the machine to hang. The
procedures chained need to return the control very fast so as not to
interrupt the normal functioning of the system.

To get around these restrictions, Int 1Ch which is invoked by Int 8h
every time it is called can be used effectively. While this too is
called 18.2 times a second, it can be used quite safely without the
dangers involved with Int 8h. When chaining a procedure to Int 1Ch, keep
in mind that the procedure should be one that does something fast and
returns the control soon. For instance, a procedure that updates a clock
in the corner of a screen should not have a loop built into it, but
should rely on the fact that it is called repeatedly several times a
second. Every time it is invoked, it should get the current time and
display it before handling the control back.

To make things simple, here is a program (compilable in Turbo Pascal
6.00 and above) which demonstrates background operation using Int 1Ch.

The program generates a background akin to what programs like Scream
Tracker use, with tiny darts zipping all over the screen. While these
"movers" move around, the program can go on processing in the
foreground, interacting with the user normally.

Assuming fifteen movers are going to be around at any given point of
time, an array with details about each mover is maintained. Each mover
is determined by its X and Y coordinates on the screen, the character
that is used for the mover, the direction the mover is moving, its speed
setting and whether the mover is currently on the screen or not.

The array is initialised with a randomly chosen Y coordinate and an X
coordinate which describes either the extreme left or right corner. Care
is taken so that no two movers lie on the same row. The speed is a
random figure and the direction of movement is selected according to
which corner the mover starts off. If the mover lies on a position where
a character already exists, one can either choose to have it overwritten
or have it hidden giving the illusion of passing in front and behind the
character respectively setting the OnScr truth variable accordingly.

The procedure MoveIt is an interrupt procedure that is written to
replace the original Int 1Ch. The address of the real interrupt is
stored in the variable Int1C. MoveIt has a counter that keeps cycling
between 0 and 15. A mover's position is updated when the current value
of the timer is exactly divisible by the speed of the mover. This means
that the lower the speed setting, the more frequently the mover is
moved.

Every time MoveIt is called, it cycles through the data for all 15
movers making adjustments when necessary. When a mover hits the end of
the screen, it is pulled off and a new one is created. Once in a while,
the speed of a mover is changed while it is travelling across the
screen. When a new Y coordinate is being generated for a mover, one
needs to check whether another one already exists in the same row.

A problem with movers when the screen is being used for something is
that if a mover gets overwritten when it is on the screen, the next time
it moves, it blanks out the offending character because when the mover
was put on the screen, the position was blank. Again, if the screen is
scrolled, the data on where the movers were located will no longer be
valid, leaving lost movers all over the screen. While nothing can be
done about the second problem except for ensuring that the screen is not
scrolled, the first problem can be countered by creating a set of rows
on which movers should not appear. Any changes on the screen by the
foreground processing should be done only here.

The set nothere contains the rows on which movers should not appear. It
should be initialized to an empty set in the beginning before using it.

The sample program has the first two rows marked off limits for the
movers.

One of the problems with the default frequency of Int 1Ch is, it is not
frequent enough to provide very effective control over speed. The
solution is to boost the number of times the timer invokes Int 8h, which
in turn invokes Int 1Ch. The procedure FTimer, increases this speed, and
the STimer procedure returns this to normal. While this increases the
number of times the procedure MoveIt is called, it also has the side
effect of speeding up the system clock. To get rid of this, you can
write a replacement Int 8h which calls the real Int 8h only 18.2 times a
second, but calls your procedure every time the speeded up timer ticks.

The same technique can be used for other interrupts as well. For
example, Int 28h, the idle time interrupt is called whenever the system
is free and the computer is waiting for the user to do something. It can
be chained to kick in with a screen saver after a specified period of
inactivity. Int 24h, the DOS critical error interrupt can be chained to
install a proper error handler, while Int 23h, the critical break
handler can be hooked to install a custom Control-Break handler.

While these techniques can be used to implement some degree of
multithreading, DOS was never made for this. Extreme care should be
taken when implementing things like this so as to avoid potential
conflicts with other programs and TSRs which may use the same hooks.

FAXES FOR FREE: USE EMAIL TO SEND FAXES

from PC QUEST (India), OCTOBER, 1996

To the many wonders of the Internet, add another the  ability to send
free faxes to many parts of the world. This experiment started in 1993
to integrate e-mail and fax. Its now grown into a reliable and
full-fledged service that is used regularly by both individuals and
organizations. Since it can be accessed using e-mail, readers with
e-mail access to the Internet can send faxes.

Send e-mail to a special address incorporating the phone number of the
fax machine you are trying to reach instead of a fax. The e-mail address
format is remote-printer.1st_Address_ Line/2nd_Address_Line@ .iddd.tpc.int.

The "remote-printer" bit is required to generated an automatic cover
page. The Address Lines generate a "Please deliver this fax to:" message
on the cover page. When the cover page is created, underline characters
will be converted to spaces and backslash to a new line. Use the address
to specify the recipient's name/title and department, or any other
addressing information. The pound sign represents the fax number, and
this should include the country code, the area code, and the fax number.

Indian users should not use the `00' ISD prefix used. The entire number,
including the country code must be included even if you are sending a
fax within your own country. (For users in India of course this is moot,
since as of writing India is not accessible through this service.)
Suppose you want to fax the BBC World TV's News Editor whose fax number
is +44-181-5762782. Here `44' is the UK country code, `181' London's
code and 5762782 the fax number. You would send e-mail to
remote-printer. News_Editor/BBC_World_TV@441 815762782. iddd.tpc.int.

Similarly, if you wanted to fax Time magazine's Hong Kong office, you
would send e-mail to remote-printer.Hong_Kong_Office/Time_
Magazine@85225129790.iddd.tpc.int, where 852 is Hong Kong's code and
25129790 is the number.

The project depends on a number of "cells" available worldwide. A cell
is a remote-printing server, that has been set up to service a
particular geographical calling area. A fax sent to this server will be
redirected to the appropriate cell which then transmits it locally as a
fax. Since the fax has traveled mostly through the Internet, and not
over the telephone, its free (unless you pay to send e-mail). And since
your message has traveled as a fax only on the final leg of its journey,
it will have less data loss than a conventional fax.

Feedback

Once a fax is delivered, the sender receives a status report by e-mail
from the cell operator confirming delivery. If the fax could not be
delivered (the number is not a fax machine, or its is continuously busy,
or the machine is out of paper), the cell operator will inform you via
by e-mail, of its inability to deliver. Most cell operators try a number
of times to send a fax, informing you of the outcome of each attempt,
before they give up.

If you don't receive a report, it's possible that either your original
fax or the cell operator's confirmation message is delayed. It's as
reliable as e-mail, and delays do take place with e-mail too. Or your
fax could be waiting in a fax queue on a busy cell. However, usually you
will receive confirmation of a successful transmission within 15
minutes, but it could be as long as a day too. If you don't received any
acknowledgment even after 24 hours assume that something went wrong and
send the fax again.

AREAS SERVICED

As of writing, just three countries UK, Sweden and Hong Kong have
complete coverage. There is partial coverage of Australia, the US,
Canada, and parts of Europe. In the US, some major metros including New
York and San Francisco are covered.

Before sending faxes by e-mail, find out which areas are covered. A fax
sent to an area not covered generates an error message from the project
administrator. Coverage changes as new cells come on-line, and as
technical glitches occasionally take cells off-line, or when network
failures make them inaccessible.

To receive a list of countries covered, send blank e-mail to
tpccover@info. tpc.int for a list of service areas. The list is e-mailed
to you, and if you're a regular use update your listing every other
week.

FAXING GRAPHICS

This service is not limited to ASCII-based text. You can also send
PostScript file using a MIME-compliant mailer. (If you're not sure if
your mailer is MIME-compliant, check with its vendor, your system
administrator, or a knowledgeable friend.)

With PostScript you can send formatted text (including non-Roman fonts
such as Devanagiri) or complex images. You can even send your fancy
letterhead if you have a graphical format copy and a scanned version of
your signature.

To generate a PostScript file, select a PostScript printer driver in
your application and use the `print-to-file' option. This file should
always have a .PS extension. For the most reliable results, use basic
fonts such as Times New Roman. And if you want to spice things up then
select the print option that allows you to include font descriptions in
the PostScript file. This results in a huge file that can be
successfully converted to a fax by a cell which doesn't know about the
font you are using. A caveat: some e-mail providers restrict the size of
messages sent, as do Internet service Providers, and the destination
cell. Also some PostScript drivers create non-standard files. If
possible, use Apple's LaserWriter driver which works.

SETTING UP A CELL

The project's coverage depends wholly on cell operators individuals and
organizations worldwide who have established cells in their local areas.

Most operators participate as an Internet-community service as they earn
no profits. However, they are allowed to acknowledge a sponsor on the
cover page of every fax delivered and to use advertising revenue to
offset costs.

To join the project and establish your own cell you will need a permanent
connection to the Internet (as opposed to a dial-up connection) and some
basic hardware (a PC and a fax modem). The project will provide the
software. The coverage of your cell depends on you. Most cover an entire
area code so that every fax sent is a local call. Contact the project
administrator at tpcadmin@info.tpc.int for details.

A FAQ is available by mailing a blank message to tpcfaq@info.tpc.int.

Information on the project is available www.tpc.int. There's also a
mailing list for those interested. Join it by sending a message to
majordomo@aar net.edu.au. This message must have a body of a single line

MAKING MUSIC ON THE PC

from PC QUEST (India), OCTOBER, 1996

More about MIDI

In last month's article we covered  the fundamentals behind making music
on the PC. We also learnt b about MIDI composition and digital audio.

This month we'll take a  closer look at how you can use MIDI. But before
you can do something constructive, you will need a better idea of the
technology. And a demystifying of its associated jargon and concepts.

Connecting Things

MIDI (Musical Instruments Digital Interface) is a way for MIDI devices
to communicate with one other. A 5-pin DIN socket is used for MIDI and
is the gateway through which data passes. And if you don't know what is
a DIN, look at your PC's keyboard connector socket and plug. There are
three types of MIDI ports IN, OUT and THRU and a port on one device can
be connected to a MIDI port on another using a MIDI connector. This
looks like an ordinary DIN connector, but is better shielded. However,
you can also use a normal two ended DIN cable without problems.

Use a PC with a MIDI-compatible sound card as your primary MIDI device.

However, as most sound cards often don't have standard MIDI sockets, you
will need a MIDI adapter which is connected to the sound card's DB15
joystick socket. The DIN plugs at one end of the cable can be plugged
into other MIDI devices. When acquiring a MIDI adapter, its important to
ensure that it uses electronic components known as opto-isolators in it.

Some cheaper adapters do not use these, and may not work properly with
your sound card.

Keyboard To PC

We have two MIDI devices a keyboard controller and a PC with a sound
card. A typical keyboard such as the Roland PCM200 has a MIDI OUT port.

And the PC sound card has both MIDI IN and a MIDI OUT ports. If you
connect the MIDI OUT of the keyboard to the MIDI IN of the PC, the
keyboard can send MIDI data to the PC. The PC cannot send MIDI data to
the keyboard, since this particular keyboard only has an OUT port. The
PC can in turn send MIDI data out through the OUT to another MIDI
device, such as. another keyboard with a MIDI IN or another PC with a
MIDI IN. In short, the OUT port transmits data and IN port receives
data. But what about the THRU port.

If the PC has a THRU port, then any device connected to this port will
receive only MIDI data being received via the MIDI IN port. THRU ports
are a bypass for the raw MIDI data sent to a MIDI device. Most MIDI
devices, including PCs, can reconfigure the OUT to a THRU port. This
allows a keyboard to be connected to one PC that is in turn connected to
another PC, and the MIDI data flows through the first computer to the
second without being modified. But if the first PC has an OUT port
instead, MIDI data transmitted would originate from that PC.

In principle a network of MIDI devices can be daisy-chained (connected)
using the IN, OUT and THRU ports. And any MIDI data can be routed to any
device with the right port. However, data flow is one-way: from OUT to
IN or from THRU to IN.

The MIDI Data

Now that we've learn a bit about the hardware mechanics, lets look at
how the data is moved. Actually, for some reason, most people call MIDI
data messages, so we too shall do so from here onwards. Essentially,
there are two types system messages and channel messages.

System messages tell the MIDI device how to run itself, and are pretty
much like DOS or UNIX OS commands. They can tell the MIDI device to stop
or start playing a musical piece, or do a data-dump (dumping all from
one device to another). Channel messages describe to the MIDI device
details of notes being performed.

The MIDI specification assigns 16 channels (1-16) through which note
data is passed. Although you usually assign a channel per instrument,
you can also assign many instruments to a single channel. And if you're
really perverse many channels to an instrument.

Each channel is like a TV channel. The MIDI device connected and
receiving channel messages will only perform data in that channel if it
is set to receive it. Or to put it in MIDI-speak: if the channel numbers
match. For example, you can have a flute on Channel 2 with a piano on
Channel 3, but if A is receiving only on Channel 2 and B too is
receiving on Channel 3, then A will reproduce the flute and B the piano.

A common misconception is that MIDI connectors pipe audio. This is
untrue and they only carry the instructions for playing a sound. In
essence, if you set A to receive on channel 2 and B on channel 3, and
then send an instruction to play a flute on channels 2 and 3 through
MIDI, the flute sound generated is looked up separately. A's sound card
will transmit a flute sound and B's sound card too will mimic it. And if
A's card has good sound reproduction and B is low-quality, then you're
going to end up with something that's discordant, and not really music.

And speakers connected to B's card will only reproduce the low-fidelity
sound generated. They won't be able to play the great stuff coming from
A.

MIDI Composition And Sequencer

Now to the nitty-gritty's of how MIDI is used to make music. A sequencer
sends MIDI messages in the right sequence to MIDI devices to get them to
play their sounds. Sequencer tell the device to play drums on channel
10, bass guitar and double bass on channel 1, flute on channel 2 and
piano on channel 3. Sequencing is also known as MIDI composition, and a
suitable sequencer lets you compose music for an entire orchestra.

But how many kinds of sequencer are there. Although special, dedicated
hardware sequencer are available, there are also PC software based
ones. A hardware sequencer' main advantage is that they are a complete
portable package such as the Roland MV-30 (39cm x 31cm x 7.7cm) that
weighs 3 .46 kg. Marketed as a "studio production system," it can
control up to eight instruments on external MIDI devices.

But software sequencer are becoming more popular. Although available on
desktop machines, these were too bulk to carry to a concert. But
notebook PCs whose portability, affordability and capabilities are
beginning to make an impression, and the software option will eventually
edge out hardware sequencer.

Composing On The PC

The most popular PC software sequencer available are Cubase, Logic, and
Cakewalk. They are also very expensive, with the Pro versions costing
more than $200 apiece. While its possible to get earlier (and cheaper)
versions of abroad. I would recommend Logic and Cakewalk as earlier
versions of Cubase are notoriously buggy on the PC because they were
rather badly ported from the Mac. Logic and Cakewalk too have porting
bugs but are not as bad.

But for beginners, I would recommend PowerTracks Pro. This retails at
$29 and has enough features to keep you busy. And when you finally
outgrow it, it's cheap enough to not feel bad about moving on. It is
also the one sequencer we've never been able to crash. Version 4 (latest
as of writing) also allows one track of digital audio to be recorded
along with the sequencer.

The real problem with all the sequencer mentioned is that they are not
legally available in India. And if you can't buy them abroad, then all
you can use are pirated (and possibly) duplicate units. Are software
vendors in India listening.

But don't despair, there is a solution. As an example, let's walk
through Music Sculptor, a (rather dated) shareware sequencer, for you to
get a feel. Do remember that shareware is not free, and if you decide to
keep using this app, you should pay the author. Registration costs about
$30, but we for one would rather save up for PowerTracks Pro (which is a
lot better) instead. Music Sculptor 1.7 is available on the PCQ Winter
'96 CD-ROM.

To use Music Sculptor, you need a PC with a sound card and speakers,
running Win 3.x. You don't need a music keyboard (though if you have one
then use it) or a MIDI adapter (because if you are not using a music
keyboard, then the MIDI connection from the sequencer to the sound card
is emulated by the PC).

In Music Sculptor the top track-view window is a MIDI music editor.

However, more powerful sequencer have many different and useful ways to
edit music in the. These include Score-View editors that show notes in
musical score form for each track; Event-View editors which allow direct
handling of MIDI data; and Piano-Roll editors that use horizontal bars
corresponding to the pitch and assigning a length that corresponds to
the duration. (Piano-rolls were rolls of scrolling special paper with
punch marks used to play automated pianos. The computer version
resembles it mechanical ancestor and uses an electronic rather than
mechanical version, hence the name).

The bottom window is a piano keyboard, and you can use the mouse to play
it. Just click the mouse on a piano keys. And if you hear a familiar
sound you are in luck. But if you don't hear anything it's time to check
things. This is a familiar ritual for anyone who links together musical
devices and more often than not you wonder why is there no sound.

Check easy stuff like speaker connections: are they plugged in and
receiving power. Are the cables connect to the correct jacks. If all
seems well next check that your sound card drivers exist look in Program
Manager's Main window's Control Panel applet under Sound. If you can't
see any drivers then they may have not been installed and check the
card's manuals and software. If your card software includes a mixer for
the various outputs and inputs, check that the MIDI output is switched
on and that the master volume is set on maximum. And if in doubt, set
all outputs on full and adjust later. Also check that the output from
the sequencer is set to the sound card.

Once everything is set, touch piano keyboard with the mouse and
generally mess around. Scroll up and down the keyboard using the scroll
bar at the bottom, to see what are the highest and lowest notes you can
sound. And drag the mouse across the keyboard to hear a glissando.

Sound Up, Let's Party

In Pro recording studios, you usually start with a rhythm track. And we
shall too. If your sound card driver supports the General MIDI standard,
which it should if it's MIDI compatible, then the default assignment
of the instruments on channel 10 will be drums of some kind. Move the
mouse pointer to the channel (ch) button for track 1, then click and
select channel 10. (Some sound cards may use channel 16 instead). You
also need to enable the track 1's recording mode by clicking its "Rec"
button. Try playing some of the piano keys you should get a variety of
sounds from bass drums to toms, hi-hats and cymbals.

To lay the drum track in, use the metronome facility to keep time. This
can be toggled from the Settings menu. Now, press the record button. You
will hear the metronome clicking. Listening to the metronome, use the
mouse to hit the drums at the right points in time. As the measures go
by, you will see the track grow. You only need to put the track in right
over one bar (or measure as defined in Music Sculptor) at a time, and
stop (by pressing the stop button) whenever you like.

It doesn't matter if the other measures are wrong, because you can
select the wrong ones with the mouse and delete them. Similarly, you can
select the correct measures and paste them in wherever you like in the
sequence to build a perfect drum track bit by bit. And to play click the
Play button.

Next, lay down a bass track on track 2. To select the right bass, click
the instruments column of track 2 and select from the collection of
General MIDI instruments. Record this track while playing the drum track
(with Play mode enabled) as backing to help you keep time.

You similarly can lay down other instruments on the remaining tracks.

There are 16-track and 24-track studios. Music Sculptor is like a
99-track virtual studio. But the number of channels remains 16, as in
MIDI.

Going Down The Road

Keying in your sequences using the mouse will soon become quite tedious.
It's also harder to make your music expressive. And if this is the case,
then its time to invest in a better MIDI controller. Usually this is a
dumb MIDI keyboard (dumb because it has no built-in voices, like normal
consumer keyboards). It does not need to be a keyboard and can be a
guitar (where each string is assigned a MIDI channel), or a wind
instrument like a saxophone (in which case the pressure with which you
play becomes very important MIDI data). Even tap-dancing shoes have been
used as MIDI controllers. But this is not as odd as using your mouse as
a MIDI controller device, though not connected to the sound card's MIDI
port like a normal controller.

A decent MIDI controller makes it easier to be more expressive. The
Roland PCM200 has velocity-sensitive keys and a pitch bending stick.

This makes quite a difference, and lets you record a sequencer track
which doesn't sound hopelessly mechanical. Another sound investment is a
better sequencing software as Music Sculptor, though easy to use, it is
really dated. If you want more control, you'll have to buy one of the
other sequencer mentioned. These will not only give you better track
editing, but also allow you to automatically correct the timing of the
notes (quantization) and do data dumps.

If you find that your sound card's output is poor, get a professional
sound module MIDI devices that play sounds stored on wavetables like the
sound card, but better. And as you feel the need, add more equipment to
the system. If its MIDI-compatible then connect it to your MIDI network
and do interesting things in combination with the other devices. Being
inventive and using your imagination goes a long way in a MIDI set up,
and is really the most important ingredient for MIDI composition.

Music technology is changing, and MIDI is no exception. The best way to
find out more is to subscribe to magazines such as Sound On Sound or
Future Music. You can also subscribe to a music makers' mailing list on
the Internet. A really useful reference is What's MIDI, available for
7.50 (cheque or postal order, payable to Nexus Media Ltd.), from Best
Sellers, Making Music, 50 Doughty Street, London W1N 2NG, UK.

The concluding part of this opus shall cover samplers and digital audio.
Meanwhile, here's a teaser about MIDI and digital audio to get you in
the mood: If you have a multimedia system, listen to the IKE8.WAV
(\Sharewar\ Music, PCQ Summer '96 CD-ROM). It's my band playing (with me
singing). See if you can figure out which of the instruments were
generated from MIDI sequencing, and which were real.

PAINTSHOP PRO 4: UPDATED FEATURES GIVE PSP COMMERCIAL FEATURES AT A
SHAREWARE PRICE

from PC QUEST (India), OCTOBER, 1996

PaintShop Pro 4 now brings a professional paint app to your desktop, at
the price of share-ware. And the features that put this app way ahead
of comparable shareware bitmap editors include support for full
masking, 21 image filters, 11 deformation utilities, options for
customizing your own filters, plus support for third party Adobe- or
Aldus-compatible plug-ins filters.

Besides supporting standard functions available in bitmap editors,
PaintShop Pro 4 has new special effects such as Hotwaxing, Gradient
Effects, Buttonize, and Drop Shadow. Using some of these effects is more
for fun than actual use. And Web designers, multimedia enthusiasts and
those who need to create presentations will appreciate some of included
features.

Buttonize is used to convert any graphic into a 3D button that can be
saved as a transparent GIF. These can later be used in Web pages or a
variety of multimedia applications. And Drop Shadow lets you create
raised text effects.

PSP 4's interface is far more streamlined than its predecessors, and the
filters are faster. And with drag-and-drop enabled, to open a graphic
files just drag it onto the PaintShop window or icon. This feature is
also available for multiple files too.

This version's speed too is amazing, with a typical filter like Emboss
being applied over a 1 MB file in seconds. It also incorporates some 29
paper textures mimicking a variety of surfaces. There are lots of minor
changes (Ctrl+Shift+F for full screen preview instead of Shift+F) that
will take existing users some time to get used to.

Screen capture has been enhanced, and you can now capture multiple
screens at one go. And this process can be triggered with the right
mouse button. Support for TWAIN-compatible scanners is also included.

All common bitmap and vector file formats including PCX, CDR, CGM, BMP,
GIF, and PhotoCD are supported. PSD (Photoshop) image support is also
built in, but PSP 4 can't read multiple layered images. It also failed
to open some .CDR files.

This is far more powerful than comparable shareware bitmap editors. And
if you perhaps miss some features, such as support for objects and
unlimited undo, available in other non-shareware, professional bitmap
editors, remember this one came free. And when registered is still
cheaper.

Paint Shop Pro 4 for Windows 95 and Windows NT. Shareware from JASC
Software Inc, Eden Prairie, MN (www.jasc.com). Registration $69 ($23
upgrade).

The new version has several exciting features including image filters,
deformation utilities, and support for third party plug-ins such as
Kai's Power Tools and Andromeda Filters. Also creates transparent GIFs
for use with Webpages and multimedia applications.

LOMEGA ZIP DRIVE: AN EFFICIENT, FORDABLE DRIVE FOR 100 MB "FLOPPIES"

from PC QUEST (India), OCTOBER, 1996

Storage remains a problem, and you can either store on tape, diskette, or
CD-ROM each with its own problems and limitations. Or you could get a
ZIP drive that uses a proprietary format disk a little bigger than a
3.5" floppy and stores up to 100 MB of randomly accessible data. And the
drive fits into most briefcases with the greatest of ease.

Our review unit was a parallel port version. SCSI versions too are
available. Strangely enough, the target PC must have a SCSI card
installed, which is still uncommon (unless it's a Mac where this is
standard). A Mac version is also available.

The drive is encased in a high impact resistant plastic colored an
aesthetic, easily recognizable blue. And can be stored vertically or
horizontally. There are two LEDs green power and orange for drive
access. The drive was powered by a surprisingly big power supply that
worked only at 220 volts units sold in the US and elsewhere are
dual-voltage, and much smaller. Since the drive is meant to be portable,
this was a strange decision from the vendor. And although the
documentation stated that the smaller, dual voltage power supply was
available separately if required, the vendor could not supply it.

There's a short, stubby cable with clearly marked 25-pin connectors at
both ends. And a quick check with a multi-meter showed it as an ordinary
25-to-25 pin cable, with every pin connected to the corresponding one at
the other end. Iomega warns that while it is indeed a straight-through
cable, the length and quality are important. We tried using an
identically configured serial cable that failed to work probably because
this was almost three times the length of the ZIP drive's cable.

The drive comes with two 3.5" diskettes one for DOS and Windows 3.x, and
one for Windows 95 that contain the driver's drivers. There was also a
single ZIP disk labelled "Tools". Installing all the drivers was quick
and easy. The setup program scans all ports, detects the drive, copies
the driver software into the right place on the hard disk, and then
enables the drive by assigning it the next available drive letter. You
don't even have to reboot. The second option is better for those who
carry the drive around. Just run GUEST or GUEST95 to detect the drive,
assign a drive letter and move out of the way all in about 10 seconds.

In Win95 we clicked on "My Computer" and sure enough there was a new
icon for the ZIP drive, complete with drive letter. Clicking that got an
error message. Sometimes one misses the obvious two red-faced reviewers
inserted the supplied ZIP disk into the drive and chose "retry". Now we
got the disks contents, just as off a hard disk or floppy. The drive's
Properties page indicated that the disk supplied was almost full, with a
mere 20 MB free.

This disk contains various drive utilities, and their Mac version. Even
more disconcerting was that the disk was write protected as we were
unable to copy any files to it. And the manual, while useful for the
physical installation, was silent about this aspect. The README file did
mention that the Installation program would erase the Mac stuff and make
the drive writable, but we used the GUEST app instead. According to
Iomega's Web site, run RECLAIM located in the SCSI subdirectory of the
Tools disk under DOS. That freed some 37 MB of space. Interestingly, the
ZIP disks have no write-protect tab. This is done through software, and
you can assign a password to the disk for more safety.

Speed Tests

Our disk now had 70 MB free, and we started copying small 100-200K
files, then a few 1 MB sized ones, finally a 50 MB monster. It soon
became clear that the ZIP drive is no speed demon the average was about
2 MB per minute faster than a floppy drive, but still with a sense of
disappointment. We though this was caused by the Guest app, so we now
went for a full install. And at the end a panel popped up saying that a
supplied program could speed-up the disk, but warned about possible
machine lockup if the parallel port wasn't up to spec. It did, and the
README said this option was only available for bi-directional parallel
port. While the test PC's parallel port was such a port, the BIOS was
set to compatibility (unidirectional) mode. This was changed, the PC
rebooted, and another test showed the transfer rate had risen to slightly
more than 5 MB per minute. We also noticed that Win 95 was now buffering
writes and releasing up the machine much faster and there was heavy ZIP
drive activity for quite a while after Windows returned control to our
application.

Wishes And Work Arounds

Among the things really missed is an ability to quickly find how much
space remains. With conventional drives, clicking the icon in Win95
gives an instant report. However, IOMEGA has thoughtfully provided a
work around. An option (right-clicking the drive) temporarily marks it
as non-removable. Win 95 now treated the ZIP drive as a hard disk and
correctly reported the disk space. This also solved another problem.

While installing an e-mail program on the ZIP, the installer refused to
install on a non-removable drive. The work-around solved that problem
too. While the drive is marked non-removable, you can't eject the disk,
but the eject button remembers your attempts and as soon as you revert
the settings, the disk ejects.

The ZIP drive comes with a comprehensive set of disk management
utilities. Of these utilities, some pop-up when your right click on the
ZIP drive icon. And include copy, format, write protect and eject disk,
as well as temporarily mark as a non-removable. However, we were unable
to find a cataloging app advertised as part of the software even the
accompanying demo-cum-ad mentioned FINDIT which apparently had not been
shipped. We later found that the Win 95 versions was not yet ready, and
had to download these later from the company's web site
(www.iomega.com). These added a catalog of the disk's contents, and a
new one-step backup and restore option that is fast and very convenient.

The backup software works in the background and ejects the filled up
disk as a signal to replace it with a blank one.

FINDIT was very fast, but far from convenient. It allows you to quickly
catalog and locate files, but you can't launch files or copy them. You
need to first start Explorer, insert the disk indicated by FINDIT, and
navigate to the correct directory. A shortcut is to press Ctrl-Escape,
select "Run Explorer z:\yourpath\" (or whatever the drive and path of
your target is).

Zipping On Price

The ZIP's international price is $200 and $15 for the disks.

Unfortunately, the local prices are a bit higher, yet still quite
affordable. At around Rs 16,000 for the drive and Rs 1,500 per disk,
this is the cheapest portable direct-access storage you can buy. We hope
price crash, sooner rather than later as they become more popular. But
watch out for fake disks. So far disks are being made only by Iomega but
rumour has it that they may soon be made by other floppy disk
manufacturers.

Overall the ZIP drive and disks have been so useful that we wonders
where they were all this time. As for reliability, the ZIP disks appear
extremely reliable. We haven't had them long enough to know when and if
they will start giving trouble with the oldest ZIP disk dating from June
1996. Iomega claims that the disks are very reliable and have survived
all their field tests.

Many manufacturers have decided that rather than shipping machines with
5" drives, the standard 3.5" drives will now be accompanied with Zip
drives. Iomega also makes a version that fits nicely into the bay next
to the normal floppy drive. But don't put them in your back pocket.

They're still too fragile for that.

LEXMARK OPTRA E: A ULTRA-COMPACT, LOW-COST, 600 DPI LASER PRINTER FOR
PERSONAL USE

from PC QUEST (India), OCTOBER, 1996

Optra E lists among the smallest laser printers available today. It's
taller than most other models, yet fits snugly into a corner on your
desk. Because of its compact design, paper travels along a U-shaped
path, going in face up and coming out face down. Although we anticipated
frequent paper jams and curled-up pages, the paper jammed just once. And
that too when taking the last few sheets in the stack.

Optra E ships with drivers for DOS and Windows, MarkVision a printer
management tool. This (if you use a bi-directional interface) keeps you
informed of the printer's status. For instance, if the printer cover is
open, an icon of the printer with its cover open glows red. And can also
give audio prompts if your system has sound capabilities. The printer,
however does not ship with a bi-directional cable.

We had trouble getting Optra E up and running. One of its Windows driver
library files was corrupted and we had to acquire a fresh set from the
vendor. Then when we powered on the printer, the Press Button LED kept
flashing and issuing a print command would hang the system. Searching
the manuals both paper and online were of little help, as there was no
mention of what error this indicated.

A call to the vendor revealed that a front panel reset was needed to
clear the buffer. This too was not easy. According to the manual, to
reset you need to keep the operator button pressed for a long time. But
that didn't work and we managed a reset only after powering on the
printer while keeping the button pressed. Once we had figured this out,
there were no probems.

We tested the Optra E on our standard test bench a Pentium/100 MHz with
16 MB RAM running Windows 3.11. Text prints were sharp and clear, and
selecting PQET (Print Quality Enhancement Technology) smoothened the
slight edges in larger fonts. At 300 dpi (standard mode), the Optra E
printed the first sheet in 25 seconds average, not much off its rated 19
seconds for the first page. The average speed at 300 dpi came to
approximately 4 ppm (manuals give this as 6 ppm).

For a full-page graphic in 300 dpi, the Optra E took 171 seconds. That's
very slow compared to the HP LaserJet 5P (a 600dpi laser printer tested
on the same test bench) which managed it in 26 seconds at 300 dpi, and
56 seconds at 600 dpi. While printing at 600 dpi, the Optra E took an
unbelievable 21 minutes to tackle the full page graphic and the print
quality was worse than the 300dpi output. And after printing the page,
it gave a complex page error. Going by the manual, this indicates that
you need to upgrade the printer's memory. The Optra E ships with 1 MB of
memory which is sufficient for text printing. For graphics, get a memory
upgrade.

It's a reasonably priced laser printer, with lots of features that well
performs under 300 dpi. But it's not the serious graphics user's cup of
tea.

PRODUCT     : Lexmark Optra E

TYPE        : True 600dpi monochrome laser printer

FEATURES    : MarkVision printer management utility, 26 scalable fonts,

              and Toner Saver modes, RAMSmart advanced memory management
              utility, 1 year warranty

SUMMARY     : A light-weight and compact laser printer that gives good
              performance under 300 dpi but needs a memory upgrade for
              600dpi graphics.

LEXMARK COLOR JETPRINTER 1020: GOOD VALUE FOR MONEY

from PC QUEST (India), OCTOBER, 1996

The 1020 is shaped differently from its contemporaries. It has a curved
front panel that flips opens to become the paper out tray. There are
three buttons and two indicator lights, but most printer management
functions are carried out by the bundled software. The power cable is a
"UK-type" three pin plug, with flat pins. And needs an adapter when used
in India. Or you will have to get a power cable that fits Indian power
sockets. You will also need to buy a Bitronics cable, as one is not
provided with the printer.

For a printer this inexpensive, the printer management software that
accompany the driver is among most comprehensive ones that we have
seen. Installing the drivers is simple and straight forward. The
software undertakes tasks that include cleaning and properly aligning
the print cartridge, setting print options such as paper type and size,
and the brightness and contrast of the colors in the print out. It also
has voice alerts. Also installed is an elaborate on-line help file.

There is no other printed documentation, but for an airline ticket-like
installation guide.

This printer can be bought according to the user's specification. That
is if you know what you want. The options are with monochrome
cartridge, or with Color cartridge and CorelDRAW 3.0, or with color
and monochrome cartridges, and all at different prices.

At the price of the Jetprinter, we did not expect professional quality
output. Yet, were pleasantly surprised by the results. The color
cartridge prints black by combining Cyan, Magenta and Yellow. Its not
true black, but passes muster. In our first tests with the color
cartridge, the Jetprinter's performance was good when printing solid
colors, but was way off the mark while printing gradients and
photographs. Apparently, some of the installed cartridge's
ink nozzles were not firing. The vendor replaced the cartridge, and after
a thorough cleaning, the new one gave real good printouts.

On our test machine P100/16 MB running Win 3.1 the Jetprinter gave
speeds of about a page per minute in normal mode for monochrome text,
which makes it slightly faster than the HP DJ 200. A full page color
graphic took 3:20 minutes to print.

Included with the printer is a CD-ROM containing CorelDRAW 3.0, 1,000
clipart images and 100 True Type fonts. Version 3.0 is pretty old for
CorelDRAW. And the manuals need to be purchased separately, using a form
inside the CD-ROM. Its too not clear if this option is available for
India.

All said and done, the Jetprinter 1020 is an affordable low-end inkjet,
that gives good quality output in both color and monochrome.

PRODUCT     : Lexmark Color Jetprinter 1020

FEATURES    : 330x300 dpi low-cost inkjet (600x300 dpi airbrush mode).

PERSONAL RESOURCES PLANNER: AN INFORMATION MANAGER WITH FA FEATURES

from PC QUEST (India), OCTOBER, 1996

Personal Resource Planner (PRP) is a true-blue personal information
manager (PIM). Apart from managing contacts and appointments, it helps
you track your personal data, accounts, portfolio and projects. We
looked at the demo version of PRP. This is fully functional and only
restricts the number of entries. Installation is quick and creates a
program group for the software

The graphic interface, though not as slick as Lotus Organiser, is nice
and friendly. There is, however, a small mix-up in the Accounts module.

The Accounts icon should be dimmed when within this module, but
surprisingly, if you click it here you go to PRP's Diary section.

The Accounts option is more a mini-FA package, that lets you create and
maintain an accounts master. You can enter daily expenses in a
transaction file, and periodically consolidate your accounts. Options
for printing vouchers, generating and printing ledgers, trial balance
and P/L statements complete the job.

The Valuables section lets you track asset details such as purchase
date, amount, and mode of payment. You can also maintain records for
several owners, and enter details under different categories and
locations. And assign passwords to each module.

The program lets you store contact information (including name, address,
and telephone number) in the CardFile database. The data file structure
is customizable, and you can create multiple files. You begin by
specifying the database fields. Changing and deleting fields is easy.

And you can sort and index files. Cards can be categorized as `private'
and `public'. You can also export data into FoxPro 2.5 and dBASE IV and
vice versa. However, PRP doesn't support files from other popular PIMs.

Using the CardFile, you can also fix appointments (including multiple
day events and recurring tasks). There's also an auto-dialer for phone
calls that maintains a log of calls made. Call logs, as well as other
handy to-do lists and schedules can be printed. Tasks in to-do list can
be assigned different priorities. Text search options are included in
to-do lists, appointments, contacts and address books. The calendar
offers weekly, monthly and annual views. And the built-in notepad
appears adequate enough.

The Diary records important personal information such as the numbers for
your bank account, insurance policy, and vehicle license. It also has
separate sub-menus for medical, travel, credit cards and other
expenditure-related data.

The Portfolio module is exhaustive, and allows creation and maintenance
of company masters (with their financial, bonus, dividend and closure
history). The Report options includes valuation, dividend, and
sale/purchase. The Utility menu has depreciation, rate of interest and
value calculators. Unfortunately, the Help files were not included in
the demo reviewed.

PRP also includes a full-featured Project Management module complete
with calculation of cost per function point and per day output, and
generation of activity and resource-wise reports. Plus, it also included
trimmings such as conversion tables, international currency information,
a world clock and startup reminders.

In fact, except for e-mail support and group scheduling, Personal
Resources Planner has all features essential in a PIM. And would be a
useful application to manage your time.

PRODUCT   : Personal Resources Planner (Demo version) for Windows.

PRICE     : Rs 3,699 (Introductory offer valid till December 1996)
SUMMARY   : A handy tool for managing resources and increasing
            productivity. Has a calendar, to-do lists, appointments
            and other time management tools. Also a CardFile for contact
            management and a Diary for personal data. Modules for managing
            portfolio, valuables, accounts and projects.

E-MAIL SERVICES IN INDIA: HOW HELPFUL ARE HELP DESKS?

from PC QUEST (India), OCTOBER, 1996

India has never been known for after sales support or service be it from
public utilities or computer vendors. And e-mail, which falls somewhere
in between, is no exception. The story (and service) is more or less
identical, whether its public sector VSNL which has been strongly
criticized or private service providers who are expected to be better,
yet who too are the same.

Usually, when you call the Help Desk in an emergency this in itself an
indicator that something has gone wrong you are fully justified in
expecting an immediate solution to your problems. Instead, the assigned
telephone numbers are either busy or go unanswered. And when they are
answered, more often than not no technical staff is available to
properly respond to your queries. Or to fix the problem.

In the course of this review, our experiences with the various service
providers did not impress us. (And remember as PCQ Labs reviewers, we
were in a sense handicapped, as we invariably had to disclose our e-mail
addresses and identities when calling the various help desks).

Incidentally, almost all our calls were related to problems we actually
faced, including non-working software, nodes that refused to respond,
junk being attached to messages, and so on.

aXcess began the cycle by not giving their front-end software in Delhi.

And what was finally delivered did not have a single installable module.

Getting connected to their help desk was virtually impossible (in Delhi)
during the day.

Sprint RPG claims to operate a 24-hour help desk in Delhi. Yet when we
called up at night, the telephone rang unanswered. However, during
working hours things were better.

Datapro had several problems while installing their software on our test
machine in Delhi. And could successfully complete it only after multiple
attempts. And then they gave up trying to (fruitlessly) install
value-added additions because of inherent bugs in the software.

Global's help desk was initially very difficult to get through to. They
subsequently set up a 24-hour help desk in Delhi, which despite its name
apparently does not function after office hours (presumably 9-to-5).

Wipro BT help desk was a waste of time. They were unable to help set
things right most of the time because "no one was available."
In comparison, and despite criticism, VSNL's help desk seems a much more
organized operation. Particularly when you begin with low expectations,
and are willing to wait while they connect you.

E-MAIL SERVICES IN INDIA: WIPRO BT EXM MAIL

from PC QUEST (India), OCTOBER, 1996

Wipro BT EXM Mail to give it its full name is based on the EXM/UA
interface. And includes the primary interface to the local user, a
communication server, and a configuration utility. The communications
server is a program that handles all communications with the message
store. The server/node that you log on to is the message store.

Your mail will be transferred to your Inbox. The message store notifies
where the message has come from, whether it's a message delivery report,
or a message with an attachment. And all details are specified including
the date, time of delivery, status, subject, and its origin.

Mail sent can be assigned different priorities, importance, and
sensitivity levels. They can be directly typed in or sent as an
attachment. You can also create an address book where each entry has an
alias.

Mails for despatch is stored in the outgoing mail folder, and whenever
you connect to the message store, it will be transmitted. Automatic
connection to the message store occurs as soon as you log in. One
problem encountered with this pack age was that in most of the mail we
sent, an extra part was created by the software. Sometimes this add-on
was sent as an attachment.

At Delhi and Bangalore, we were able to connect to the node on the first
try, or at worst, on the second. However, connects in Mumbai were bad
with most requiring five or more tries.

E-MAIL SERVICES IN INDIA: VSNL GIAS

from PC QUEST (India), OCTOBER, 1996

GIAS offers two types of accounts shell and TCP/IP. E-mail is available
in both through a shell account. As GIAS is essentially an Internet
service, in this review we have considered only the shell account. And
more specifically only its e-mail section.

GIAS uses a vanilla interface with no special software, and you can any
standard communications app to connect. The account is customisable in
the sense that you can use specialised third party app such as Eudora,
or browsers like Microsoft's Internet Explorer if you choose the TCP/IP
account, to simplify sending and receiving mail.

On the whole we found the GIAS shell account a little tough to use. For
one thing, other packages had easy menu-driven options for uploading and
downloading files for attachments, and for creating messages offline.

And VSNL has disabled the GIAS menu options for upload and download.

Selecting upload gives a message asking you to go to the restricted UNIX
prompt and use rz for uploads. However, if you do so and start the
upload process using your comms app (we used Telix) it transmits for a
while before crashing. To upload files you need to use the additional
switch -be (rz -be <filename>).

Similarly, the download option tells you to use sz, but to download your
mail in one go we had to use additional switches again (sz -e -l 1024 -L
1024 <filename>) to get mail and attachments together. And attachments
are MIME encoded, so you need a program such as XFERPRO (PCQ Summer '96
CD-ROM) to convert them into a readable format. Alternately you can save
attachments to your local directory on VSNL server, and then download
them separately.

You can also read your mail online in PINE, the shell account's e-mail
package with a built-in address book. However, PINE doesn't let you
queue messages to send them later. You must send, cancel or postpone.

You can also upload ASCII text directly into PINE which works for short
messages. However, when we tried uploading a UUENCODED attachment, the
system went into an infinite loop and eventually disconnected after more
than five minutes of endless screen scrolling.

Connecting is comparatively difficult with GIAS. At all stations, we had
to keep re-dialling to get connected. This happened on almost all
attempts.

On the other hand, VSNL GIAS doesn't charge you per message or on a
volume basis a powerful attraction especially if you are sending and
receiving a lot of mail. And more importantly, you get Internet
access something none of the other services reviewed can offer today.

There's only a one-time (renewable) connect charge for every 500 hours
of use.

E-MAIL SERVICES IN INDIA: SPRINT RPG

from PC QUEST (India), OCTOBER, 1996

The SprintMail software is by far the most option-filled e-mail app. It
seems to have a button for just about any task. And apart from the
normal send and receive mail options, there's also an interactive option
that allows you to log on to the node and work online. You can also join
several entailment forums available on SprintMail. These range from
astrological predictions to technical discussions.

All tasks from message composition through address book management to
interacting with the host are performed by clicking icons on the
toolbar. However as is usual with such an impressive number of buttons,
initially it can be quite confusing to decide which one does what. Tool
tips or an Icon explanation screen would definitely add to the ease of
use.

There's also an option to set up and perform scheduled operations. This
allows you to send mail at a preset time, or check for mail.

Managing address books too is simple. There is a range of templates that
convert the address into Sprint's format. When SprintMail first started
in India, the Internet template would not work properly, as it had not
been customized to Indian addressing. But this bug has since been fixed,
and Internet addressing too is supported by the templates.

Connecting to Sprint was also easy, with at worst, a second try required.

E-MAIL SERVICES IN INDIA: GLOBAL MAIL

from PC QUEST (India), OCTOBER, 1996

This is an easy-to-use e-mail app. You read your mail and create new
mail offline. Once everything is ready, you just connect to the node.

Mail received is downloaded and whatever you have ready in your Outbox
is uploaded for onward transmission. And once connected, the software
graphically displays messages being retrieved.

All the retrieved mail is automatically stored in the local folder. A
really nice thing about this package is that unread mail has a sealed
envelope icon and mail read has an open letter icon. This helps you
distinguish between new messages and old ones. Activities such as
connecting to the node and sending and receiving mail have been
simplified. And can be done through one click of your mouse.

However, creating Address Books is really painful as there are no
templates. If you want to enter an Internet e-mail address, instead of
using the common @ symbol you have to enter `(a)'. The window to make
this entry is quite confusing and consists of several tabs that ask just
about everything but the way to grandma's house. The main tab lets you
fill in details such as your given name, surname, common name, and
primary routing details. Then there's a network tab where you enter the
domain defined attributes and other network details needed for Internet
addresses. There's also a postal tab to enter details such as a person's
postal address and telephone numbers. There's the Others tab to enter
the alias name. And finally there's the X.500 tab with several of its
own queries. It would have been much simpler if templates had been
provided, as in Sprint mail.

A really helpful feature about this app is that if there's pending mail
in the Sent Mail folder, the software prompts you on whether to send it
or not whenever you exit. Sending or receiving attachments is easy
between two ISOPRO users. We sent a ZIPfile between two ISOPRO hosts,
and between an ISOPRO and another e-mail package. Between the former,
the attachment format was recognized, but in the latter the file changed
to BIN format. This necessitated a call to the Help Desk for a solution.

Just save the BIN attachment as a ZIP file and then access it.

Connecting to Global was not a problem. We were able to get through on
the first try itself on most occasions. And the worst case was five
tries that happened twice at Bangalore in the afternoon.

E-MAIL SERVICES IN INDIA: DATAPRO XEE-MAIL 96

from PC QUEST (India), OCTOBER, 1996

The Xee-MAIL 96 user agent is an easy-to-use app whose other options
besides e-mail include printing, managing address books, access
permissions, administration, tools, and a neatly compiled help file.

During installation, the software by default creates a System
Administrator (Sysadmin). This user has the rights to add five more
users and define their access rights.

Creating e-mail is the same as with other Windows-based e-mail apps. You
create new mail by typing in a message, or by using cut-or
copy-and-paste from other messages or text documents, and by using
attachments. One nice feature about the latter is that you don't have to
specifically invoke the address book. Just click the To: tab, and the
address book displays automatically. Next double click on the
recipient's alias and the address is entered in the To: field. However,
Xee-MAIL does have a strange way of connecting to the node. After
preparing your messages, you have to restart in DOS to dial-in. For a
Windows app, its really strange that you need DOS for such simple tasks.

One area where we faced problems was while using mailing lists. The
package refused to queue a mailing list, and this remained consistent,
regardless of whether the mailing list consisted of a single address or
of 20 addresses. We even checked if the Sysadmin had imposed any such
restrictions on the user, but found none. And even the Sysadmin was
unable to queue the mailing list for dispatch.

Creating an address book is simple. There are several templates for
adding a new e-mail address. There are also additional features such as
authorizing access to someone else to use your account while you are
away and encoding a message for privacy.

Connecting to Datapro's nodes was fairly easy at all locations. We were
usually able to connect in three tries. And in the worst case, it took
eight attempts to get through at 11:00 AM in Delhi. But in Bangalore we
faced a problem. After a full day of testing, our mail box the next day
was full of 172 undelivered messages. Many of these were duplicates, and
others had been sent and received by recipient. However this problem
occurred only once.

E-MAIL SERVICES IN INDIA: AXCESS

from PC QUEST (India), OCTOBER, 1996

aXcess Electronic Messaging is a DOS based e-mail service. And it's
initial splash screen is the only graphical element. aXcess gives you
the option of using either their software, or any standard
communications app (such as Telix) to upload and receive mail.

With aXcess you can prepare messages both on and offline. However,
features such as the Address book and Alias lists can only be created
and accessed while online. Therefore even though you create messages
offline you still have to remember the e-mail address or at the very
least the recipient's e-mail alias (nickname for the full address).

Using this method, an address such as labsd.pcq@axcess.net.in becomes
`labsdelhi' which is easier to remember. The problem with remembering
multiple aliases or addresses is mitigated a bit by Alias lists that
allow to you club e-mail addresses under an easy to remember word such
as `Friends'.

Once you dial in, aXcess allows you to organize your mail by moving and
copying messages between folders. You can view or create messages using
the built-in editor which looks a lot like WordStar 4. And the pull-down
menus are quite straightforward. But using the e-mail software would
have much easier with dialog boxes instead of the nested sub-menus
approach used. You have to select `Move' to choose the message to move,
then select the target folder to move to, and finally press <Esc> to
back out.

One problem we faced with aXcess was that you can't address a message to
more than seven people in the To list. And the same restriction also
applies to Alias lists. To make it harder, the system has few prompts
and messages. There is no way of knowing when you are done with the
current chore. And you end up staring at the screen wondering what's
going on. A simple dialog box mentioning that the task is completed
would be nice.

aXcess also gives you access to Business India's database of the Stock
Market and Foreign Exchange rates. But when we tried to check this, we
got an error message that we weren't registered for this service.

At all test locations, we had problems connecting to the aXcess nodes.

E-MAIL SERVICES IN INDIA: PCQ LABS REVIEWS FIVE MAJOR E-MAIL PROVIDERS

from PC QUEST (India), OCTOBER, 1996

For this review, PCQ Labs setup test accounts at Bangalore, Delhi and
Mumbai. Vendors were also requested to activate a roaming account at
Pune. Vendors were allowed to install the necessary software on our test
machine, and configure it. The only difference was VSNL GIAS, where we
used Telix a popular shareware app as no specialized software was
provided. Once the software was properly set up, the tests began on an
`as-is where-is' basis. We were unable to review VSNL's GEMS.400
service, as test accounts were only available at two locations Delhi and
Mumbai.

E-mail usage can broadly be classified into two levels corporate and
person to person of messaging. In the former, most of the data sent and
received is information such as MIS, sales and purchase reports. And as
our test of the market showed, most corporate messaging in India uses
the same service provider, with all branches and users connected to the
same system. Corporate messaging also uses value-added options such as
message confirmation and faxing. On the other hand, person-to-person
messaging is not restricted to a single provider, and is usually
across systems.

To send e-mail, a user has to first prepare the message, and then dial
in to the provider's nearest node to send or receive mail. The software
provided helps the user manage messages. And the service provider needs
to ensure that e-mail sent reaches its destination at soon as possible,
without losing content or importance.

In this review, we have checked each of these stages. Service and
support was tested in some detail. It has not been included in the
rankings, as we were unable to duplicate test conditions with every
vendor. Security of the system and mail has not been tested.

Test messages were exchanged from Delhi and Bangalore to the other test
account at Delhi, Bangalore and Mumbai, at predetermined times. And all
locations were checked (in alphabetic order) at hourly intervals for
mail receipt.

To connect to a node, we tried two alternate numbers, five times each.

If a connection was not established, we proceeded to the next service,
and only returned the busy ones at the end of the cycle.

To test the supplied software's ability to handle attachments, a
standard attachment consisting of a BMP file embedded in a Word
document was used.

PRAKASHAK: ADD INDIAN LANGUAGE CAPABILITIES TO WINDOWS APPS

from PC QUEST (India), OCTOBER, 1996

Prakashak brings multilingual capabilities to your computer, and it runs
on DOS, Windows and Macs. It is available for Devanagari (Hindi),
Kannada, Telegu, Tamil, Malayalam, Gujarati, Bengali, Oriya and
Gurumukhi (Punjabi). Prakashak for Windows comes with a bundled DOS
editor. But to install the app, you need to do separate installs for DOS
and Windows, and both require the key disk. All copy protection schemes
are irritating, and this one is no exception.

Prakashak's DOS-based text editor lets you enter multilingual text. It
has regular word processor features such as indents, tabs, fonts, and
type styles. And also supports multiple columns, mail-merge, and macros.

However, the package lacks a spell-checker and transliteration
facilities. But it's fast and print quality is reasonable.

The mail-merge option lets you merge text in both English and Hindi.

However, you have to be careful to maintain the correct format while
making your data file entries. Just one wrong entry and the editor
crashes to the DOS prompt.

To use the Windows version, run your favorite Windows word processor or
DTP app, and then run Prakashak for Windows. Choose the Languages option
on the Prakashak main menu bar and select the language you've installed.

Now select Phonetic or Graphical keyboard mapping. In our tests, we
found phonetic mapping a lot more intuitive. Choosing either option
brings up a dialog box listing all running applications that work with
Prakashak. Select the application you want to use and you can begin
work. You can also create custom keyboard layouts using the DOS-based
INSTALL.EXE utility.

The Filter option lets you convert files created in the Prakashak DOS
editor to ASCII, RTF or Ventura format. Set Defaults lets you select one
application that will run every time you run Prakashak. You can also
define hot keys to invoke macros. You can have four such macros to let
you switch between languages and fonts using a hot key. These macros
worked fine with Write using the default hot key of Ctrl-F3 but they
didn't work properly with Word for Windows.

Prakashak worked well with PageMaker 5, and files created using the DOS
editor and converted to RTF format imported well. Prakashak's manuals
are comprehensive. The program comes with several true type fonts for
Windows. It also works with ATM fonts. However, as an add-on, it's an
expensive solution, when cheaper alternatives are available, especially
for Indian languages.

PRODUCT    : Prakashak for Windows (with Prakashak DOS Editor).

FEATURES   : Available in Devanagari, Kannada, Telegu, Tamil, Malayalam,
             Gujarati, Bengali, Oriya and Gurumukhi scripts with keyboard
             mapping and fonts. Has Phonetic or Graphical keyboard mapping.
             DOS-based editor.

PRICE      : Rs 12,500 (one script). Rs 9,000 (each additional script).
             Rs 9,000 (upgrade with DDE for FoxPro with one typeface).
             Rs 21,000 (DDE and DTP per language with all typefaces)

SUMMARY    : An Indian language solution that gives additional capabilities
             to your Windows word processor and DTP software. Fonts are
             available for True Type and ATM. Expensive as an add-on.

NEC VERSA 4080H: NEC'S LATEST VERSA IS AN ELEGANT MULTIMEDIA PENTIUM

from PC QUEST (India), OCTOBER, 1996

This is NEC's upgraded Versa note-book, and unlike the Cyrix-based
Versa 550D we reviewed in August, this one runs on an Intel
Pentium/120. NEC's finally got rid of the trackball and put an elegant
and functional touchpad. And the 100-240V mains adapter is so tiny, I
wish they'd fit it into the notebook itself.

There's extensive power management, and the Phoenix Powerpanel, a
floating button-bar that lets you, with one click, choose "high battery
life", or presentation quality, or a custom setting; or suspend the
notebook, or, best of all, save memory contents to a disk file and power
off.

On the display panel are the brightness control and two small
loudspeaker grills at the top corners. Great place for speakers, though
these are a bit tinny and weak (0.15 watt each). Some other neat touches
included a rear infrared port and when you use the optional docking
station, this is disabled and a second infrared port on the front goes
active. You can select this through an on-screen button, too.

We tested a very limited 8 MB model, a tight squeeze for most apps. With
multimedia, 16 MB is a basic requirement.

The Versa's TFT active matrix display is clear and sharp head-on, and
reasonably clear as you change your viewing angle horizontally, but
things get a little fuzzy with a change of vertical angle especially
when looking at color photos. A possible reason could be that we had
trouble setting the display to above 256 colors.

The lithiumion battery packs enough power, and ran multimedia apps and
a CD-ROM for about 90 minutes. The CD-ROM and floppy drive fit into the
same bay, so you have to choose between them.

The unit we got was a straight US import, with a US mains plug, and the
promise of 24-hour hotline support (presumably in the US). The manual's
comprehensive (though older than the notebook), with even a bit on what
to do when you're travelling (documents for Customs checks, etc). The
body stickers, however, say "Versa 4000", which is the older DSTN model.

A well-featured elegant multimedia notebook that is adequately powered
for most apps, as long as you take it with 16 MB.

PRODUCT   : NEC Versa 4080H
SPECS     : Multimedia notebook with Pentium/120 MHz, CD-ROM, floppy drive,
            10.4" TFT color display. Dual infrared (S-IR) ports, PCMCIA

TASTY BITS FROM THE TECHNOLOGY FRONT: EN ESPANOL

from PC QUEST (India), OCTOBER, 1996

Thanks to Bruno Unna of Internet de Alta Calidad in Mexico City, TBTF
will henceforward be available to Spanish-speaking readers. See
(www.iac.com.mx/cgi-bin/uncgi/iackernel.pl?dest=/nw/hd/th/ultimo.html)
for the latest issue. I don't read Spanish myself, but it's apparent
that Bruno translates the news and omits my wisecracks. His site is
better designed than mine, too.

TASTY BITS FROM THE TECHNOLOGY FRONT: ESSENTIAL TOOLS: PUBLICIZING YOUR WEB
PAGE

from PC QUEST (India), OCTOBER, 1996

A new user queried the Apple Internet Authoring mailing list for advice
on getting the word out about his new Web page. The query drew this
detailed and cogent response (www.counsel.net/info/marketing.html)
from Bob Reap. It's a blueprint for doing the hard work of letting the
world know about your site, to the point of diminishing returns.

Learning To Think Like An E-mail Direct Marketer

Whether you call it "marketing via e-mail" or "spamming," you might be
interested in following a moderated conversation among its
practitioners. The Direct E-mail Marketing Association (DEMA) hosts a
mailing list and Web archive (kww.com/dema/). I've subscribed for a
while now and even posted once or twice. The moderator, Rob Zee
maintains an upbeat tone and seems sincerely to want to educate the list
about what is and is not acceptable behavior on the Web with the goal of
finding ways to make unsolicited commercial e-mail palatable to
recipients and ISPs. Zee is also collecting names/addresses of netizens
who wish not to receive commercial e-mail; he plans to make the list
publicly available, at which time reputable marketers should begin to
filter their mailing lists against it.

I learned of the DEMA list from Phil Agre's Red Rock Eater news service.

TASTY BITS FROM THE TECHNOLOGY FRONT: FOLLOW-UP: HOW'S JAVA DOING?

from PC QUEST (India), OCTOBER, 1996

On Sun's first Java Day, I alluded to the new (to me) idea that the Java
language might be good for more than animating Web pages. Last
November people weren't talking much about the intranet with a little
"i". It has since become a commonplace that the money made from Net
technologies over the next several years, at least, will mostly be made
by targeting the builders of corporate intranets. The MIS world is now
taking seriously the notion of using intranets and Web browsers to
develop and deliver corporate applications. In a real sense Web
technology has picked up the gauntlet from the declining client/server
model.

Here are some recent developments in the conquering march of Java.

IBM has announced that the next version of its OS/2, code-named Merlin,
will have Java technology built-in to the operating system l Remember Taligent?
The late collaboration (by everyone except Microsoft) to invent next-
generation frameworks for software development folded its tent some time ago.
Now the Computer Industry Daily reports that Sun has licensed some of
Taligent's technology specifically its multilingual class libraries to
implement world-wide applications and applets in Java.

Sun has delivered its Java Workshop development environment and is
selling it for $99 for the rest of 1996 a price point far below the
competition's.

TASTY BITS FROM THE TECHNOLOGY FRONT: RELIGION ON THE NET

from PC QUEST (India), OCTOBER, 1996

It's long been my belief that the content on the Net must mirror the
interests of humans in the aggregate. Business, science, politics,
pornography, religion if people spend energy on it in "meatspace" they
will spend energy on it on the Net. Recently I've been accreting
pointers to religious sites. Here are a few.

A site that offers free home pages to churches and Christian-related
groups (www.churchsurf.com/).

The Monetary of Christ in the Desert (www.christdesert.org/pax.html),
where the brothers have brought the ancient art of the illuminated
manuscript into the electronic age.

The German Conference of Bishops recently renounced Confession by
Computer, a PC application developed in Cologne that lets users confess
to one or more of 200 sins. The program also offers advice on how to
reach priests and ministers on the Net.

The Virtual Diocese of Partenia (www. partenia. fr), presided over by
Bishop Jacques Gaillot. This outspoken French bishop was stripped of his
former seat at Evreux by the Pope in 1995. But since bishops cannot be
defrocked unless excommunicated, Gaillot had to be given another
diocese. The Church's solution was to make Gaillot bishop of Partenia, a
small area in the Sahara Desert in which no people have lived for at
least 1,500 years. Since he had been made the Bishop of Nowhere, Gaillot
decided to become the Bishop of Everywhere that is, of cyberspace.

Ultraseek (ultra.infoseek.com) provides a quick count of Web pages
having the following words in their titles. The total of 63,785 compares
favorably with the cyberporn count of 11,702. The words are: church,
temple, mosque, archdiocese (21,740); Hindu, Catholic, Baptist,
Lutheran, Muslim, orthodox, Protestant (19,560); Christian (12,569);
bible, Koran, Torah (6,120); and Jesus, Buddha (3,796)

TASTY BITS FROM THE TECHNOLOGY FRONT: PIONEER ANONYMOUS REMAILER SHUTTERS
THE SHOP

from PC QUEST (India), OCTOBER, 1996

Johan (Julf) Helsingius of Finland, who has run the anonymous e-mail
server anon.penet.fi since 1993, shut it down last week. On 25 August
1995 the British Observer newspaper had run a banner-headline front-page
article (scallywag.com/) titled "The Peddlers Of Child Abuse." The
article, which is both technically inaccurate and seemingly libelous (a
lawsuit has in fact been filed), accuses Helsingius and the owner of
England's largest ISP of willing complicity in child pornography.

Helsingius attributed his decision not to the Observer article's
appearance, but rather to the lack of clearly defined laws relating to
the Internet. Helsingius is a scarred veteran of the anonymity wars,
fighting the Church of Scientology to keep the identity of a user
private.

Other anonymous remailers remain in service; Community ConneXion
supports a free encrypting interface to ten of them
(www.c2.net/remail/).

TASTY BITS FROM THE TECHNOLOGY FRONT: AOL ENJOINED FROM BLOCKING SPAM

from PC QUEST (India), OCTOBER, 1996

America Online blocked all e-mail from five Net addresses belonging to
companies AOL believes responsible for sending upwards of a million
"spam" e-mail advertising messages to AOL subscribers. According to AOL
the volume of unwanted spam e-mail is the now number-one complaint of
its members. One of the alleged spammers, Cyber Promotions Inc, filed
suit, and the next day a Federal judge ordered AOL to stop blocking the
mailings pending a trial scheduled for November. AOL has appealed.

TASTY BITS FROM THE TECHNOLOGY FRONT: ARE NT WORKSTATION & NT SERVER THE
SAME?

from PC QUEST (India), OCTOBER, 1996

TBTF for August 8 (see PCQ September 1996) summarized a messy fight
between Microsoft and Netscape, et al, over the licensing provisions of
Windows NT 4.0 Workstation. One of the combatants not mentioned in the
earlier coverage is O'Reilly Associates, who like Netscape makes a Web
server that can run on the less expensive NTW platform. Two days ago
O'Reilly senior editor, Andrew Schulman published an article
(www.software.ora.com/news/ms_internet_andrews.html) claiming that NTW
and NTS are in fact identical, except for the values of two registry
settings (www.pcweek.com/news/0902/06ent.html). Tests run by PC Week
(www.pcweek.com /news /0826/26lic.html) are cited in the O'Reilly
article, although the results seem to me to bolster Microsoft's claim
that NTS is optimized for a server role. (Either Microsoft's or
Netscape's server, running on either NTW or NTS, could easily serve
enough users to saturate a T1 connection, according to PC Week.)

TRAINING BLUES - THE IDEAL COMPUTER COURSE

from PC QUEST (India), OCTOBER, 1996

The quality of computer education in most of the parts in India is still
pathetic. Much of the problem stems from the fact that the  educators
are as ignorant as the students. I have come across many people who are
career trainers, and have little to no understanding of the discipline
they are teaching. In fact, our value systems make this paradoxical
situation possible you could hardly expect a student to explain in not
more than five lines the difference between programming in FORTRAN and
an RDBMS language.

What follows is my own humble contribution to help lessen the problem a
hypothetical course for students aspiring to be career developers. The
course structure assumes that candidates know how to use a PC and a word
processor.

It starts with a course in Pascal programming not Basic, COBOL, or C.
Pascal is the ideal language to make one start thinking in structured
terms that you would find useful throughout your career. Another
advantage is, one will find the books on data structures, algorithms and
compilers easy to understand as most of them use Pascal as the reference
language.

The next course would be a trimester-long-unit devoted to solving
programming problems. Students would be expected to use their knowledge
of Pascal to solve a long series of programming problems, mostly of the
traditional variety. Learning to struggle with easy to state but tough
to solve problems does much in developing clear thinking. Moreover,
students get to understand their true aptitude for the subject matter.
The student would take a course in Windows and PC software usage in
parallel with the above. This course would focus on using software like
dBASE, MS Word, Excel, Lotus 1-2-3 and the like for day-to-day
applications. In addition the students would be exposed to advanced MS
DOS concepts and Windows fundamentals.

The next few courses would focus on commercial problem solving using
COBOL, assembly language programming, and an insight into computer
architecture. Students would be asked to write programs for a mini
payroll or general ledger system. The computer architecture and assembly
language course would provide the student with an elementary idea of the
innards of the computer and the basic operations it is capable of. The
lab exercises of this course would focus on writing small programs in
8086 assembler with exposure to BIOS and DOS services. The computer
architecture course is central to the understanding of a whole range of
concepts.

The next trimester would focus on systems programming and C language.
The former would cover elementary ideas about compilers, interpreters
and operating systems. The students would be given a comprehensive
exposure to technical nitty-gritty such as concurrency, time sharing,
and security. Parallely, they would learn to use C language to develop
small utilities, such as those for encrypting and compressing files.

The penultimate semester would cover databases and networking. True
justice should be done to these courses since students would have an
adequate background to understand many of the central issues of these
topics. Concurrent lab coverage would include developing
network-compatible programs and skills on popular RDBMS packages.
The last semester would provide a set of optional courses such as
Windows programming, advanced RDBMS, object oriented programming, and
elements of accounting.

The bottom line This might not be the optimal course structure, but far
better than teaching C as the first programming language.

WATCH YOUR PC ON TV

from PC QUEST (India), OCTOBER, 1996

We are often asked why we prefer external modems to internal ones. And
since most internal modems have a built-in 16550 UART and a lower price
tag.

Well, there are several reasons for this. Let's start with one of the
more disastrous ones. Have you ever switched on your PC while watching
TV in the next room. More often than not, the screen starts shaking and
all kinds of strange lines appear on-screen. This is caused by
inadequate shielding of the PC's power supply. Without a body to
approve electrical emissions, such as the FCC, vendors don't pay much
attention to the quality of the power supply's filter circuits. The
result lots of electrical emissions than can and do cause interference
with just about any electronic device.

Now imagine your poor little internal modem card sitting right next to
this power supply. If the TV next door can be effected, think of what's
happening to a something right next to the source of all this
interference. You get miserable performance as lots of noise is added to
already dismal telephone line conditions. Given that our telephone
system is not the best money can buy we land up with problems ranging
from bad or almost no connects, to low transfer rates when trying to
transfer files.

There are several other reasons against using internal modems, but our
idea here is just to warn you about what you could be getting into.
Another hair-raising example is the possibility of being struck by
lightening while online during a storm. This can happen to both
external and internal modems. With an external modem all that goes
normally is just the modem. But for an internal modem you could
burnout the whole PC. Not to mention any other peripherals such as the
monitor, keyboard and printer. Think about it.

AND HOW THEY FARED: WITH EVERYBODY PERFORMING QUITE WELL, PRICE & FEATURES
DETERMINE EDITOR'S CHOICE

from PC QUEST (India), OCTOBER, 1996

The results of our tests were initially quite surprising. Unlike the
V.32bis modems that were quite common in 1994-95, the V.34 modems tested
this year produced near identical performance results. At first we
though our tests had some flaws, but after running through the test
suites several times, we realized what was really making the difference
was the V.34 specification itself.

In the Sibling Test, there was a mere 2.66 percent difference in speed
between the highest and the lowest connect times. And all speeds were
consistent with what we expected at 28,800 bps (in theory, a 28,800 bps
modem in V.42 mode will transfer at a maximum speed of 3,600 characters
per second; actual speeds were better than 90 percent of this in all
cases).

In the ISP Access Tests, differences in speed amounted to no more than
3.8 percent. All the modems remained rock-steady while connected. And
all of them survived the three minute beep without major incidents.
In fact, the total variance in scores for performance is as low as 11
(out of 100). And in such a scenario, buying decisions will be
influenced very much by features, bundled goodies and most importantly,
the price tag.

For this years shootout, we have modems offering more or less similar
performance, with price tags varying between Rs 10,000 to Rs 40,000. And
some modems also have features that could justify, at least partially,
the higher prices. However, others, and in particular, the Motorola
Premier and the US Robotics Courier V.Everything, simply cannot justify
their prices, given their feature sets.

Some vendors may argue that their modems are faster (having a top speed
of 33,600 bps), but the implementation of this speed is simply a
superset of the V.34 standard used by all modems. And other
manufacturers can argue that they won't implement a speed standard that
had not been ratified by the ITU. (Remember the V.FC episode from early
1995, where many manufacturers jumped the gun and implemented V.FC to
deliver 28,800 bps, only to find their modems incapable of adjusting
when the official V.34 standard appeared, causing serious damage to
many modem manufacturers' reputations when they had to either recall
modems for factory refitting, or simply orphan them.)

Most of the modems operating at 28,800 bps will be able to upgrade to
33,600 bps once V.34bis is ratified and in all cases this will mean only
a change of Firmware (the control software within the modem) easily
done today with most using Flash ROM upgrades, or simply a Firmware ROM
replacement.

Interestingly, the lowest priced modem in this review, the GVC 28800,
supported the V.34+33,600 bps speed. Forty percent of the modems were
unable to connect at full speed when subjected to the Unknown Modem
Test. This should be a pointer for users working with bad lines or
questionable modems at the other end.

The final decision boiled down to the two most important factors
insofar as the Indian market is concerned price and the Out-Of-Box
Experience.

When we applied the Brown-Gibson model to our results, the Boca was
unquestionably on top. It had a 12 point lead over the ZyXEL Omni and a
19 point lead over the Hayes that came in third. The GVC came in fourth,
loosing mainly on features. Motorola, who changed their modem pricing
from Rs 21,000 to Rs 31,000 during the review, dropped to ninth place,
despite very good performance and features. The US Robotics Courier
dropped from last year's top-three to the eighth place, despite top
marks for performance, because of its price.

Happy high speed connects.

ZYXEL OMNI 288S: GOOD BALANCE OF PRICING & FEATURES, COMPLEMENTED BY
PERFORMANCE

from PC QUEST (India), OCTOBER, 1996

The Omni 288S is not exciting to look at, but provides good value for
money. This is a basic dial-up model, with just enough LEDs. However,
their location on top of the case is not very ergonomic. And to see
what's happening you need to look down at the modem a not so comfortable
position.

It uses the same manual and software as the Elite 2864, which makes it
extremely easy to use. However, it also shares the same shortcomings no
Win 95 INF files, and more or less the same performance online.
Like the Elite, the Omni too can be upgraded via Flash ROM. And we hope
its quality will `ripen with age' like any good wine. ZyXEL is well
known for issuing frequent firmware upgrades (even in the 1496 series),
so one can expect that online performance will improve over time.
At Rs 16,000, the Omni is priced about the same as the US Robotics
Sportster 28800, and its PPF is the lowest in the entire review six
percent below the estimated fair landed price!

The modem's price-to-features balance made it a serious contender for
the top slot, but the Boca wins on better pricing and a slightly better
performance.

RATING:

PRODUCT   : ZyXEL Omni 288S

PRICE     : Rs 16,000

SUMMARY   : The Omni gives above average performance and a very good
            price-to-features balance. A no frills dial-up model, the Omni
            gets the second rank, and is highly recommended.

ZYXEL ELITE 2864: GOOD FEATURES & MATCHING PRICING, BUT AVERAGE
PERFORMANCE

from PC QUEST (India), OCTOBER, 1996

Although ZyXEL terms the Elite 2864 a `Do Everything' modem, we would
prefer calling it a multimedia modem because of its obvious stress on
features such as voice traffic.

It sports a sweeping design, with the largest number of LEDs on its
status panel and supports both serial as well as parallel connections to
the PC. It also has an optional RAM upgrade that can receive faxes
without being connected to a PC. It can also be upgraded to ISDN
capabilities (albeit at a stiff price tag)

It came without any Win95 INF files, and we had to download these from
the Internet before we could install this modem. This is a bit of a
Catch 22 situation to install the modem, you need to use it first, which
you can't. The bundled software, Triofax, is a full voice mail system
that is very easy to use. However, it does not support Win95's TAPI
functions.

The manual is really elaborate, with lots of diagrams and configuration
options something new users will definitely appreciate.

The many LEDs let you see the status from across the room. And the
powerful speaker can really rock the room when it handshakes. Online, it
was unable to reproduce the magic of its predecessor, the 1496 series.
It retrained more than usual, and in the unknown modem test,
consistently failed to connect at 28,800 bps.

ZyXEL uses Flash ROM to update its firmware. Several such upgrades have
addressed many problems in earlier models. One hopes that the Elite 2864
too will also eventually become as stable as the 1496 series at which
point it will become a serious contender. upgrade ability to ISDN may not
seem much now, but when ISDN becomes a reality, this will ensure that
the modem does not become obsolete.

Earlier priced at Rs 35,000, the Elite has been more comfortably
repriced to Rs 25,000, and sports a really low PPF of eight percent

RATING:

PRODUCT   : ZyXEL Elite 2864

PRICE     : Rs 25,000

SUMMARY   : The Elite has an elaborate LED display, and sports a sweeping
            design. Offers ISDN upgradeability and a RAM upgrade can enable
            it to receive faxes without attaching to a PC.

US ROBOTICS SPORTSTER 28800: A NO-FRILLS MODEL WITH BELOW AVERAGE
PERFORMANCE

from PC QUEST (India), OCTOBER, 1996

The Sportster 28800 is the natural successor to the Sportster 14400. It
looks near identical to the older models a not highly ergonomic shape
and insufficient LEDs. And there is no voice/data toggle switch either.
The modem too comes with little documentation when the first Sportster
was first introduced in India, we were impressed with the quality of
documentation, but things seem to have changed. The manuals are useful
if you know about modems, but a novice would be lost in the jargon
jungle.

Like its sibling, the V.Everything, this one too comes without a serial
cable, which leaves you wondering how to connect the modem to your PC.
That is until your told that you have to buy this necessary component
separately the equivalent of saying `batteries not included'.
Online, this modem was not very stable, and had problems dealing with
the modem in our ISP Access and in the unknown modem test. In the former
it managed to connect, but retrained often. As for the latter, it could
not connect at 28800 bps.

At Rs 15,500, it carries a PPF of almost 70 percent.

RATING:

PRODUCT   : US Robotics Sportster 28800

PRICE     : Rs 15,500

SUMMARY   : Indifferent performance, lack of features and over pricing
            caused this to fall in the ratings

US ROBOTICS COURIER V. EVERYTHING: EXCELLENT PERFORMANCE & FEATURES WITH A
STIFF PRICE TAG

from PC QUEST (India), OCTOBER, 1996

Black, sleek, excellent performance, and very expensive. Add to all this
a pretty fabulous software bundle, which just about sums up the US
Robotics Courier V. Everything.

Unlike the low-end Sportster, this one is a real work horse, and has
been a long favorite with service providers world wide, and with good
reason too. It supports virtually every modem protocol ever invented
(including V.FC, V.32terbo and V.34), as well as the yet to be
established V.34+ running at 33,600 bps). When you use the V.Everything,
you'll never need to worry about compatibility issues.

The modem too is an ergonomic delight sized and shaped to fit under a
standard phone, or as part of a pile of modems stacked one over the
other. It also has a programmable switch that is user customizable
(though the default is a voice/data toggle switch). A slider volume
control makes it easy to "listen in" on a link for audio debugging, and
the bank of DIP switches at the bottom are great for configuring it for
non-PC applications, such as mainframes. And for those in the habit of
misplacing their manuals the Courier has the most important commands
printed on its bottom. The supplied documentation was a bit obtuse, but
usable nevertheless.

The V.Everything has a pretty overpowering software bundle in the form
of two CD-ROMs packed with lots of useful applications, including an
accounting system, communication and Internet software, as well as other
utilities. And all these with a multimedia front end that is a pleasure
to use.

Win95 had built-in drivers for this modem, so there were no problems.
Surprisingly, there was no serial cable supplied - a serious drawback.
Online, it worked steadily and reliably. File transfer speeds were on
par with the other modems. What really let it down was the pricing at Rs
28,000, it is priced out of reach for most users, which is a pity. A
more realistic price would have made this the unbeatable choice for the
masses. As it stands, the high price tag represents a PPF of about 50
percent

RATING:

PRODUCT    : US Robotics Courier V.Everything

PRICE      : Rs 28.000

SUMMARY    : An excellent but expensive workhorse with lots of software.
             The unrealistic pricing and average features really lost it
             points.

MULTITECH 2834 BL: LEASED-LINE MODEM THAT'S EXPENSIVE FOR DIAL-UP USE

from PC QUEST (India), OCTOBER, 1996

Similar to its predecessor the 1432 BL, the 2834 BL too is encasedin a
metal box. It looks sturdy and is projected as high-end modem.
Unfortunately, it also comes with a high price tag; the highest in this
shootout.

The 2834 BL's front panel is quite impressive. It has all the relevant
LEDs including speed indicators and a voice/data toggle switch. The
power supply is an inline block type with a strange connector that
actually locks in place, but sometimes falls off every now and then. The
modem also has a small volume control knob at the back. Apart from the
regular serial and phone connectors, it also had a 4-wire leased line
connector the only modem to have that.

The 2834 BL has excellent documentation with the manual adequately
explaining all the features and settings. The bundled software is
MultiExpress which has its own separate manual. Also supplied is a
serial cable. There are no extra drivers required as the modem is listed
in Win95 and worked without any problems. In terms of performance, the
2834 BL was a little on the lower side. It had the highest handshake
time and the transfer rates were average both on the EPABX as well as on
the transfers with VSNL. The modem does support the V.34+ protocol and
in our cross tests, it did connect at V.34+ 33,600 bps.

Overall the modem passes muster, but its not for the average buyer. The
steep price of Rs 39,500 places it out of most users budgets. But it
does have the advantage of being leased line compatible, and would be a
good for corporate buyers. The 2834 BL is an expensive even abroad, but
in India its PPF works out to 64 percent.

RATING:

PRODUCT     : Multitech MT 2834 BL

PRICE       : Rs 39,950

SUMMARY     : The 2834 BL gave average performance and features. Very
              impressive front panel, plus leased-line support.

MOTOROLA PREMIER 33.6: A HEFTY PRICE TAG LETS THE PREMIER DOWN

from PC QUEST (India), OCTOBER, 1996

At first glance, the Motorola Premier invoked a sense of dejavu it
looks identical to the Motorola Lifestyle 28.8 reviewed last year. The
only visible difference we could find was the higher operating speed
(33,600 bps using the as-yet unratified V.34+ specification) and its
price of Rs 31,000.

A quick check at Motorola's Web site showed that this was indeed the now
discontinued Lifestyle, with a few additional features, none of which
affect everyday use. The modem now has a Flash ROM feature that allows
Motorola to update the modem's controlling firmware through a software
upgrade. And it also has additional features such as synchronous
operation and V.25bis dialing (used only when connecting to certain
mainframes). It's DTE (Terminal interface) rate can go twice as high as
the Lifestyle's (230.4 Kbps instead of 115.2 Kbps), but this feature
that will mean little to the average user, whose PC can only `talk' at
speeds up to 115.2 Kbps. The modem also incorporates some security
features such as 20 user security profiles and remote configuration,
which would be useful when the Premier is used in a host environment.
The modem itself is encased in a sleek `slab of cheese' plastic
body first seen in the Lifestyle with an insufficient number of LEDs to
let the user know what's going on. There is no voice/data toggle switch.

And the documentation is somewhat on the skimpy side definitely not for
first time users though reasonably comprehensive for experienced ones.
In actual use, the Premier performed as expected from a true Motorola
modem (unlike the Fastalk models which are rebranded, the Lifestyle
modems are actually manufactured by Motorola). Online performance was
stable, though some quirks did show up. In the default setup, the modem
would connect at 2400 bps unless forced to 28,800 bps this was probably
a flaw in the firmware that should be rectified by now.

Motorola worldwide has begun a global product repositioning exercise,
where certain models are priced as premium models as in their cellular
phone range and the Premier too seems a victim of this.

None of the available features can justify the Rs 31,000 price tag, and
we wonders just who exactly is Motorola targeting. It does not have
4-wire leased line or voice facilities that would have helped justify
the price. And since Motorola worldwide has discontinued the Lifestyle
(as announced on their own web site), it doesn't have a modem that
caters to the lower end of the market. The Premier could easily have
been priced at around Rs 18,000, which would have been fair. As it
stands, the Rs 31,000 price tag represents a PPF of almost 80 percent.
While the Motorola scored an impressive 96 out of 100 on Performance,
and a not too bad on Features, but out priced itself from the
competition!

RATING:

PRODUCT       : Motorola Premier 33.6

PRICE         : Rs 31,000

SUMMARY       : WWW. The Premier gave good performance and is reasonable in
                features. But its pricing robbed it of a possible top three
                position, if not the Editor's Choice itself

HAYES ACCURA 288 MESSAGE: GOOD PERFORMANCE & COULD DO BETTER ON FEATURES

from PC QUEST (India), OCTOBER, 1996

The Accura 288 is a sleek little modem, like most of the other models
reviewed. The manufacturer have decided to pay attention to the
modem's appearance too. Its packaged in a simple plastic casing,
making the Accura one of the lightest. The power supply is of the
small socket-mounted type.

The box contains a serial cable, a small booklet masquerading as the
manual and which is by no means complete, and SmartCom software. This
comes with its own, larger manual and the first time when we looked at
the documentation, we assumed (wrongly) that the SmartCom manual would
also have details for the modem.

On the front panel, the modem sports the regular number of LEDs. The
back panel has the connector for the serial port, the phone and line
jacks and the power switch. There is no volume control or voice/data
switch. With SmartCom, the modem can act as a complete messaging
station with answering machine. Since our tests did not involve these
abilities, this feature was not tested.

As of performance, the Accura fared quite well. Its handshake time was
average and the file transfer rates on both the internal EPABX tests as
well as the VSNL tests were very good. In fact, the Accura 288 had the
highest file transfer speed in the ISP test. But it did have a problem
connecting to our unknown modem. For some reason, it would constantly
step down to V.34 21,600 bps. We tried several times but always got
connected at this rate. And this cost the Accura valuable performance
points. Similarly, it scored a total blank in "Others", making it to
third place overall.

Overall, the modem performed well, but is overpriced at Rs 15,750, which
represents a PPF of more than 70 percent. Nevertheless, this is not such
a bad modem.

RATING:

PRODUCT     : Hayes Accura 288 Message

PRICE       : Rs 15,750

SUMMARY     : Good performance but for connect speeds to the unknown modem.

Using the bundled software, the modem can act as a complete messaging
station.

GVC 28800: AN ATTRACTIVE LOW COST OPTION WITHOUT SACRIFICING ON
PERFORMANCE

from PC QUEST (India), OCTOBER, 1996

The GVC 28800 modem looks quite similar to the older Hayes V Series
modems. A silver metallic case with a bit of black, quite compact and
neat. Despite the fact that its made of metal, its extremely light. The
power supply for the GVC too is the small socket mounted variety.
The front panel had just a row of LEDs, nothing else. There was no
voice/data toggle or speaker adjust knobs; just the power switch at the
back, with phone line in and out jacks connectors and the serial
connector. There even was no indicator for speed. There was an HS
indicator for any speed exceeding 2,400 bps, and a TST LED for retrains.
Speaker volume is controlled using software. But the speaker is a bit
tinny, and the V.34 handshake can really make it shriek, so you should
adjust the volume to as low as possible.

Appearances aside, the modem behaves quite well. We managed to get some
pretty good results calling over the EPABX, and on our direct line tests
as well. Rock steady file transfers and a reasonably low handshake time
gave the GVC a slight, early lead in performance. We did not encounter
any problems connecting to our unknown modem. Every connect was at V.34
28,800 bps. The GVC also supports the V.34+ protocol, so in some tests
we even managed to get a 33,600 bps connect.

A feature that we really missed, was online statistics or last call
analysis. At high-speed, it really nice to know where the problems lie.
Many modems these days have a register which can be checked for the
details of the last call.

The modems factory defaults are properly configured for hardware
(CTS/RTS) flow control, and we did not have to make any changes at all
to get it to work, other than the X register for detection of dialing
tones.

A skimpy little 22 page manual comprises the modem's documentation. And
QuickLink II the bundled software. No serial cable was provided, but
Win95 drivers were supplied.

Overall a good modem, it performed well in all tests, with best part
being the price. At Rs 10,000 it is definitely the cheapest 28.8 kbps
modem available today. And it comes with a three year warranty. The PPF
is 23 percent, which means you can expect the price to come down a bit.
However, the absence of adequate documentation, a serial cable,
voice/data switch and other features cost the GVC dearly, that it could
not recover despite its low price. The GVC ended up in fourth place.

RATING:

PRODUCT   : GVC 28800

PRICE     : Rs 10,000

SUMMARY   : Good performance and attractive pricing. Lost out on features.

BOCA MV.34EE: GOOD PERFORMANCE & ATTRACTIVE PRICING SETS THE BOCA APART

from PC QUEST (India), OCTOBER, 1996

Packaged in an all black plastic case, the Boca MV.34 EE looks nice and
sleek. The modem is small, light, and very portable. And the power
supply is the standard, two-pin socket mounted type.

The front panel has several LEDs, but none indicate the connect speed.

It appears to be trend not to provide a speed indicator on the front
panel, but to use software instead. The Boca however does have an
indicator for retrain a thoughtful touch. In most of the tests
conducted, the modem hardly ever retrained, so at first we actually
thought there was no retrain indicator.

The Boca comes with adequate documentation. There's a nice 94 page
booklet that gives you all the information you need. As for drivers,
none are shipped, but it is recognized and listed in Win95 so it worked
without any problems. Also bundled is Faxworks 3.0, a fax software. In
terms of completeness, this was one of the few modems shipped with a
serial cable.

Performance-wise the Boca was really good. It did not have the fastest
handshake times or even the highest transfer rates, yet was extremely
steady. It did very well on all the tests, over the EPABX, as well as
during direct calls to VSNL. Even the test with our unknown modem were
very good. As the Boca does not support the V.34+ protocol, all connects
were at V.34 28,800 bps.

The price tag of Rs.13,500 is attractive, and includes a five year
warranty. Overall a good modem, with excellent performance. The modem
scored a low 18 percent Premium Profit Factor, which is commendable.
Steady performance, good features and a decent price makes the Boca
MV.34EE the Editor's Choice.

RATING:

PRODUCT      : Bocamodem MV .34 EE

PRICE        : Rs 13, 500

SUMMARY      : Good features and pricing combine with performance to make
               the Boca modem the winner in this shootout.

THE PC QUEST 1996 MODEM SHOOTOUT: THE TESTS

from PC QUEST (India), OCTOBER, 1996

The sibling test

Each modem was tested back to back (not over a phone line) against a
modem of the same make and model. This determined how the modem would
behave in what could be called `unchallengeable ideal conditions'. It
should be noted that though some modems were capable of speeds up to
33,600 bps using the as-yet-undefined V.34+ standard (expected to become
V.34bis sometime in late October), we forced the modems to connect at
28,800 bps to keep results consistent. And a standard ZIP file was
transferred to test transmit speeds.

The Inter-operability Test

Each modem was tested back to back (not over a phone line) against all
the other models in the review. This brought out any problems that a
modem could face when connecting to another modem from a different
vendor, as is likely to happen when you connect to any BBS or Internet
service.

The ISP Access And Data Transfer Test

Each modem was tested repeatedly against a specific modem at VSNL (the
sole public Internet Service Provider, as yet) over a standard phone
line. The ZIP file was used to test transfer speeds. This represented
the most common usage of such modems. As in the Sibling tests, we forced
the modems to work at 28,800 bps, though this was actually unnecessary,
as VSNL's modems do not go beyond 28,800 bps.

The Unknown Modem Test

Each modem was tested over telephone lines against the same modem (from
a vendor not included in this review).

Pricing

We also calculated the `Premium Profit Factor' (PPF) a comparison of the
US street prices with the prices at which the modem is sold in
India though we did not include this factor for the actual ranking. The
PPF was calculated by estimating the landed cost in India, based on the
US street price, using $1=Rs 36, and adding 50 percent to this value
towards import and marketing expenses. This value, deemed as a fair
price, is then compared to the actual Indian price, and expressed as a
percentage above the estimated fair price. The higher the percentage,
the bigger the PPF. Use this value to estimate the chances of the price
dropping in the near future the higher the differential, the higher the
chances for a price drop.

How We Ranked Them

In order to determine the rankings, we used the standard PCQ Labs
Performance-Features-Price model and the Brown-Gibson model to arrive at
the weightages of individual parameters. Given below are the parameters,
and their associated weightages

Performance

File transfer rate (cps)               50
Connect speed to unknown modem         33
Time taken to handshake with sibling   17
Total                                  100
Price                                  100

Features

Documentation                          31
Serial Cable provided                  31
Win 95 INF file provided               19
Voice                                  13
Others                                 6
Total                                  100

NB: For `Others' we looked at the following six factors V.34 +, Lease
Line Option, Connect Speed Indication, Retrain Indication, and
Voice/Data switch. The presence of each meant one point.

PC QUEST 1996 MODEM SHOOTOUT: PCQ LABS TORTURE-TEST 10 V.34 MODEMS

from PC QUEST (India), OCTOBER, 1996

Every year around this time, here at PCQ Labs we spend a considerable
amount of time testing modems. And this year too, this activity has been
more frenetic than ever before, mainly because of the incredible demand
for modems that has resulted from VSNL's introduction of publicly
accessible Internet services.

While laying down the test parameters for this year's review, PCQ Labs
was faced with the decision about what modems to review. We have found
that users tend to refer to our reviews throughout the year, and its
therefore very important to ensure a line up of modems that can cater to
the demands for the next year (or until our next shoot-out).

So we decided to exclude any modem that does not offer speeds of 28,800
bps or more. The reasoning is actually quite simple VSNL now offers
V.34, 28,800 bps access in all cities and demand for modems operating at
these speeds has risen sharply. The biggest factor in this increase has
been a rapid rise of World Wide Web content and Web pages are now
incredibly rich both in graphical and multimedia content. This is good,
but at the same time, pages such as these require high access speeds
before you can see what you're supposed to.

Our minimum specification was that reviewed modems should be external,
V.34 models, at the very least. The inherent instability of the previous
standard (V.32bis), plus the low speeds achieved by such modems made
them less desirable. And finally, the low prices of modems today (the
lowest we tested cost just Rs 10,000, with average street prices for
high quality, V.34 modems being around Rs 16,000) effectively ruled out
V.32bis 14,400 bps modems priced just 20 percent less.

In this shoot-out, we have managed a fair sampling of the market. Some
models are however missing: World Wide Technologies withdrew after
submitting a model for the shootout. And the US Robotics Voice modem was
not tested because they could provide only one modem as against the two
required by our tests.

How We Tested

For testing the modems, we kept in mind the fact that almost all
potential purchasers would be using them to connect to VSNLs Internet
services. We therefore tested these modems against a typical modem
running at VSNL (we had access to a specific telephone number and not a
hunt group, ensuring that we had the same line and equipment conditions
for every test).

We stressed on the "out of box experience" (OOBE) for modems tested.
Usability scored over other factors a modem that was up-and-running
straight out of the box was rated higher than one that took a lot of
tinkering and support. This OOBE was also affected by little things
like if the vendor bothered to supply a serial cable (it was surprising
that some of them didn't), if they offered a 16550A-based serial card
either as a standard or as an option (almost none of them even chose to
make the buyer aware that without this, these modems are effectively
useless), what was the quality and usefulness of documentation
available (modem documentation that is, not software documentation. For
example, GVC shipped a generic 22 page manual devoid of any useful
details), and how the modems performed using their basic factory
(default) settings.

We did not test PCMCIA (PC Card) modems, or internal modems in this
shootout.

The Test Bed

The test bed consisted of two Pentium/100 PCs with 16 MB RAM, running
Windows 95, with the MS Plus! pack installed. And both machines had
16550 UART ports installed. The communication software used was
HyperTerminal 2.0.
