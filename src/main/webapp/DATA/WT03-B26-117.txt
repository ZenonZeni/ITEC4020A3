<H3>A Bigger Picture </H3>

<P>
How can we draw this all together?
<P>
The disturbance assessments applied to the ILZ and ELZ are qualitatively
distinct and thus have been separately reported as <A HREF="chap3a.htm#table5">Table 5</A>
and <A HREF="chap3b.htm#table8">Table 8</A>.
<P>
The two sets of figures cannot be simply aggregated.
<P>
Nonetheless, we present the following argument to support a combination
of these two sets of figures to produce a systematic continental
assessment. Further, we then use these figures to compare the
status of the Australian continent with global assessments compiled
by <A HREF="refs.htm">Hannah et al (1994, 1995)</A>.
<P>
For the ILZ, we have argued that with impact on biodiversity,
the thinned and cleared classes should be aggregated. By far the
largest proportion of the indeterminate class area was grasslands
or shrublands; disturbed by grazing but not cleared. This class
cannot be ignored but it should not be equated to uncleared.
<P>
In our opinion, compared with the impact on biodiversity of clearing,
the three levels of grazing disturbance assigned for the ELZ are
far less severe or permanent. The indeterminate class can by default
be added to the slightly disturbed class.
<P>
Therefore, we create a combined scale of landcover disturbance
with three levels: undisturbed (uncleared, slight), partially
disturbed (indeterminate clearing, substantial grazing), and significantly
disturbed (thinned and cleared, significant grazing). We stress
that this aggregation is based on personal judgement. What is
more important, it ignores the threat of feral animals.<HR>

<P>
From the combined figure in <A HREF="#table12">Table 12</A>, more
than one third (35%) of the continent was significantly disturbed.
From the tenure figures of <A HREF="chap2c.htm#table4">Table 4</A>,
it can be determined that only 81% of the continental area is
subject to active landuse. The remainder is allocated to unused
(12%) or in conservation reserves (7%).
<P>
From this we can conclude that almost half of the landcover subject
to landuse was assessed by us as significantly disturbed.
<P>
How should we to interpret <A HREF="#table12">Table 12</A> in
terms of biotic erosion?
<P>
Many concerned individuals regard the land reserved by conservation
tenure as the only area worth considering in the difficult task
of preventing or slowing biotic erosion: only the National Parks
and nature reserves matter, the rest is lost.
<P>
In contrast, Pressey (1995), proposes a wider and more useful
plan for effective conservation to which we subscribe.
<P>
We believe the critical areas to be those which are significantly
disturbed. These are the areas most in need of remedial management.
<P>
In addition, we propose that for conservation management, the
partially and undisturbed areas are equivalent and deserve a lower
priority for action than the significantly disturbed areas. However,
we note that we are here ignoring the relentless impact of feral
species.
<P>
Lastly, how do the overall figures for Australia compare with
the other continents?
<P>
The most recent global figures on disturbance are those compiled
by Hannah et al (1994, 1995). Using different techniques, they
produce a three-level classification of disturbance that was overall
more severe than reported here. In our opinion, their most disturbed
category, human dominated, represents a greater level of disturbance
and irreversibility than used here. This was shown by their assessment
of Australasia being 62% undisturbed, 26% partially disturbed,
and 12% human dominated; Table 2 of Hannah et al 1994. The aggregate
of their last two categories (38%) was comparable with our most
disturbed category (35%).
<P>
Using this relationship, we recalculate Table 2 of Hannah et al
(1994) to produce a disturbance ranking of all the continents.
In relative terms, Australasia and South America have equal lowest
proportions of significantly disturbed landcover (38%), with Europe
containing the highest (86%). <HR>
