<H2><HEAD>Site Characterization Progress at Yucca Mountain</HEAD></H2>
<BODY>
<HR>
Scientists have made a great deal of progress in their investigation of Yucca Mountain, Nevada. They have studied the data from extensive scientific and analytical work performed since site characterization began, and have confirmed various early hypotheses about the mountain. In the process, they have also reduced some scientific and technical uncertainties about its potential performance as a repository site. 
<P>

An important milestone in this effort has been the completion of the third in a series of total system performance assessments. This is an analytical technique that uses computer models to evaluate the ability of a repository and its engineered and geologic systems to safely contain and isolate radioactive waste. <P>

Scientists and engineers are using the insights produced by this assessment to refine their waste containment and isolation strategy. This strategy will help focus future scientific and engineering efforts on important technical issues that still need to be resolved. Outstanding issues concern long-term behavior of the natural geologic system, as well as features and processes of the natural geologic and hydrologic system that might impact the engineered systems currently being designed for the repository. 
<P>


While some tests will continue for a number of years, for the viability assessment due in 1998, engineers and scientists will perform work designed to further confirm the hypotheses underlying their waste isolation strategy.<P>

<H3>Exploratory Tunnel Adds to Earlier Efforts</H3>

Scientists developed their earliest picture of conditions at Yucca Mountain from surface-based tests and observations dating as far back as the late 1970s. These included drilling efforts and seismic testing. This understanding has been complemented by recently completed subsurface excavation. During the last year, the rapid progress of the tunnel boring machine has advanced excavation of the exploratory tunnel through the proposed repository level. This has provided confirmation of many early assumptions about conditions at the site. <P>

Among some of the important scientific results that have emerged:<P>

<UL>
<LI>Observations of the natural system and data collected since 1978 suggest that the natural system is robust, which is to say that the geological characteristics of the site appear to be complementary   can work together in their ability to isolate waste. <P>

<LI>Numerical models and calculations will be able to bound, or set limits upon, many of the uncertainties for radiological safety evaluations. This leads to greater confidence in predicting how the site will respond once the repository is built.<P>

<LI>Recent performance assessments provide confidence that a Yucca Mountain repository would contain and isolate radioactive waste, and would assure public health and safety.<P>

<LI>Geologic evidence is consistent with models of the site that have been the basis of performance calculations for more than 10 years. However, scientists still must determine the long-term importance of potential fast pathways for water movement. <P>

<LI>Very recent work has challenged the extent of the potential for the lateral diversion of infiltration. This new, preliminary information is being evaluated. Ongoing exploration and planned testing will help determine the extent to which infiltration may be expected to be diverted near the surface of Yucca Mountain.<P>

<LI>The rock quality at the potential repository level is as good or better than assumed when scientists first considered a repository at Yucca Mountain that could safely dispose of spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste.<P>

<LI>The potential repository area is also as dry as expected.<P>

<LI>The probability of a future volcanic eruption directly intersecting a repository at Yucca Mountain is now estimated to be about 1 in 70,000,000 per year.</UL>


<H3>Next 2 Years Will Continue To Focus on Vital Science Activities</H3>

Scientific activities during the next 2 years will focus on the scientific and technical questions about waste containment and isolation that remain to be resolved. In particular, scientists will address:</H4>
<UL>
<LI>The rate of water seepage into the proposed repository level <P>

<LI>The integrity of waste packages <P>

<LI>The rate of release of radionuclides from waste in waste packages that have been penetrated by water <P>

<LI>Radionuclide movement through the repository's engineered and natural barriers<P>

<LI>The rate and manner in which radionuclides from waste packages dissolve in the ground water at the repository level.
</UL>

<H3>Refining Mathematical Models of Repository Performance</H3>

In addition, scientific activity during this period will address the development of mathematical and conceptual models describing the performance of the potential repository. Toward this end, scientists will:<P>

<UL>
<LI>Test and model groundwater flow above the water table, to better understand the behavior of 
water in the unsaturated rock where a repository would be located<P>

<LI>Test and model groundwater flow, to better understand the movement of water below the water table<P>

<LI>Refine radionuclide movement models, to integrate or combine what is known about the flow of water, the effects of waste-generated heat, and the geology of Yucca Mountain<P>

<LI>Develop supportable values, or numbers, for releases of different radionuclides over time from the repository's engineered barriers<P>

<LI>Complete the description of the geology of Yucca Mountain, as well as assessments of volcanic and seismic hazards to a repository built there<P>

<LI>Continue refining mathematical models predicting future climatic conditions at Yucca Mountain<P>

<LI>Conduct tests to establish the effects of waste-generated heat upon the rock and water in a repository. These data will support coupled-process models of the waste package environment an
d the rock affected by the waste-generated heat. The first of these tests began August 26, 1996.<P>
