<h1 align=center>Medical Marijuana: Aid to Infirm
<br>or Vague Loophole in Narcotics Laws? </h1>

<p><font SIZE=+1>By MARK EVANS
<br>Associated Press Writer</font> </p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Jim Scott's morning routine rarely
varies. First, a cup of coffee. Next, a dose of lithium, to treat his manic
depression.</font> </p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>Then a tightly rolled cigarette, packed with the cheapest
marijuana he can find.</font> </p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>The 50-year-old San Franciscan repeats the ritual at noon,
at dinner-time, and late at night, smoking three more joints, each precisely
measured at 1 gram. He falls asleep stoned.</font> </p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>``This controls my anger,'' Scott says, gesturing with
an unlit joint clasped in his left hand. ``It helps me keep my balance.''</font>
</p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>The only variable in Scott's daily routine is the availability
of his pot, which he's forced to find illegally, through friends or on
the streets. That's why he is actively campaigning for Proposition 215,
a ballot measure which would permit people to grow and use the drug for
certain medical purposes.</font> </p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>To its supporters, Proposition 215 is a long-overdue measure
that would help seriously ill people cope with pain and disease. But to
opponents, it is a cleverly shrouded hoax that uses ailing people as pawns
in a broader battle to legalize a dangerous drug.</font> </p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>``The pro-marijuana lobby has made no bones about the
fact they want to legalize marijuana. The way to do that, they have decided,
is through medical marijuana,'' said Tom Gorman, spokesman for the California
Narcotics Officers Association. ``It's unfortunate they're using sick people
to get what they want. It's exactly what they (the infirm) don't need.''</font>
</p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>Gorman says the proposition provides no controls on quality
or dosage of marijuana. And, he notes, a synthetic form of marijuana known
as Marinol already is available by prescription.</font> </p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>Moreover, Gorman says, under Proposition 215 a doctor's
``prescription'' for marijuana could amount to no more than an informal
verbal statement, making it difficult to track who legally is entitled
to the drug.</font> </p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>``If I were a (marijuana) grower, I would get a doctor's
permission somehow. I'd say I have a headache or a backache. Or pick a
doctor who was deceased. If I got busted, I could say I had permission,''
Gorman says.</font> </p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>Drug dealers are smart, he says, and will find ways to
exploit every loophole in the initiative. Enforcing existing laws against
marijuana would amount to ``an absolute mess,'' if the measure passes,
he says.</font> </p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>Despite Gorman's skepticism and a medical community that
remains divided on the issue, there are many who swear the drug helps them:
Cancer patients say it has helped them fight the nausea that follows chemotherapy
treatment. AIDS patients recount how it helps their appetite, allowing
them to stave off the ``wasting'' effects of the disease. Glaucoma patients
say it helps reduce pressure in the eyes.</font> </p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>And then there are people like Scott, who claim four joints
a day help him wrestle with insanity.</font> </p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>``I know what I'm like without it,'' says Scott, whose
mood swings have landed him in jail or mental hospitals dozens of times.
``I'm down on Market Street, yelling uncontrollably, yelling very loudly
at the shopkeepers.''</font> </p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>The debate over medicinal marijuana is nothing new in
California. State lawmakers approved similarly worded measures in 1994
and 1995, but Gov. Pete Wilson vetoed both.</font> </p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>``This is probably our toughest fight,'' said Orange County
Sheriff Brad Gates, a longtime opponent of efforts to legalize the drug.
``It's on the ballot, and we have to deal with it. But I don't think it
will pass.''</font> </p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>Recent polls, however, show strong voter support. A Los
Angeles Times survey last month showed voters favoring the initiative,
53 percent to 31 percent. A Field Poll gave it a 2-to-1 margin of victory-although
it found only half the voters were aware the measure was on the ballot.</font>
</p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>Opponents say the apparent support may simply come from
people who don't completely understand the initiative.</font> </p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>``It's a scam,'' says Sharon Rose of Californians For
Drug-Free Youth. ``I read the initiative to people and they flip (their
opinion). The way it's written, it's deceptive.''</font> </p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>But Jeffrey Reed, a 40-year-old registered nurse, says
the only deception is in anti-drug rhetoric which lumps marijuana together
with much more dangerous narcotics.</font> </p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>``We're talking about a herb that's been used to heal
since time immemorial,'' Reed says.</font> </p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>Reed, diagnosed with AIDS in 1988, says he discovered
the drug's curative powers a couple years ago and has been spreading the
word ever since.</font> </p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>``I think we're at a turning point,'' he says. ``Finally,
we're getting to decide whether the attorney general and a bunch of police
can decide what's medicine-or whether to leave that decision to our doctors.''</font></p>
