<font size = 4>

<p>Transactions usually entail one or both of the role of adviser and representative.  Often, the Firm is
called upon to give advice to structure, facilitate or evaluate a proposed transaction or one underway
or about to be consummated.  Similarly, the Firm can be called upon to represent the client, such as by
being its negotiator or emissary, in bringing a transaction about.</p>

<p>Transactions demand an understanding of the business objectives sought to be attained, a realistic
assessment of the legal issues and concomitant risks including the risks of future disputes, and a
focused effort to attain those objectives while keeping the legal risks at an acceptable level.  That is
how the Firm approaches transactions.  Interposing objections that have no realistic application to the
facts, as well as "papering over" issues to make a deal happen when it should not or when the
businessmen have not actually judged the risks worth taking, are things the Firm avoids.</p>

<h3><img align = center src = "blueorb.gif"><a name = "disputes"><font color = "#2f4f2f" size = 5>Disputes</font></h3></a>

<font size = 4>

<p> Disputes -- with business associates, competitors and governmental representatives -- are part of
ongoing commercial relationships.  Responding to disputes starts with assessing, from a strategic
perspective, the nature of the dispute and how to approach it. </p>

<p> Some disputes represent honest disagreements over matters to which the parties gave little heed
when embarking upon the transaction, or which arose as a result of significant economic or regulatory
change.  Dealing with such disputes includes assessing the facts about which the parties disagree and
trying to develop alternative, convergent objectives which the client and the other party to the dispute
will share. </p>

<p> Other disputes comprise something quite different.  The cause of the dispute may be only
indirectly related to the issue seemingly in dispute -- a business war being fought on a battlefield of
opportunity.  The battlefield of opportunity must, of course, be dealt with, but it alone may not end the
disagreement.  Judgment in analyzing and addressing these kinds of disputes is the key to handling
them.  These kinds of disputes can by their nature invoke the Firm's role as an aggressive champion of
the client. </p>

<h3><img align = center src = "blueorb.gif"><a name = "prevention"><font color = "#2f4f2f" size = 5>Prevention</font></h3></a>

<font size = 4>

<p> Preventive law, that is, anticipating areas of concern and minimizing in advance the risks they present,
quintessentially calls into play the Firm's role as adviser. </p>

<p> Preventive advice can be independent of any transaction or an adjunct to a transaction or representation in a dispute. In dealing with a dispute, the Firm also focuses on the prevention of future claims and disputes of similar type. </p>
