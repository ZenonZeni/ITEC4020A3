<P>
One of the primary goals of the DOE Hydrogen Program is to ensure that 
partnerships with industry members help to develop and deploy safe, 
environmentally friendly, cost-effective hydrogen energy systems for 
transportation, 
heating and cooling, electricity generation, and other appropriate energy 
and fuel 
uses.  The program also seeks to assist U.S. businesses in becoming more 

competitive in the global economy by providing clean industrial 
technologies, 
enabling industry to be less energy- and resource-intensive, and 
eliminating or 
reducing the need for environmental cleanup and remediation.
<P>
The program focuses on achieving the technological advances that will 
enable hydrogen to become an economically viable part of the national 
energy 
resource mix, and has set near-term, intermediate, and long-term research 
and 
development (R&D) goals.  Projects to develop advanced technologies for 
hydrogen production, storage, transport, and use that appear competitive 
in terms 
of energy consumption, emissions, and capital investments have priority. 

<P>
The DOE Hydrogen Program selects R&D projects through open and 
competitive procurements.  This section of the InfoNet contains program 
meeting 
announcements and notices of current or active solicitations to identify 
new projects.  
There are many opportunities for small and large U.S.-based businesses to 

participate in this program.  Click on the following topics for more
