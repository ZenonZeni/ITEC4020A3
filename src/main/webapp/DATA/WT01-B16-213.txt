I have a close friend who is on a weight loss diet that is a mildly modified version of the Atkins Diet, which restricts the consumption of carbohydrates and grains. One who wants to lose 14 pounds in 2 weeks does not eat pasta, bread, grains, or sugars of any kind. The greasier the better, says one doctor in Arkansas. He says you can eat all the eggs, cheese, and peanuts you want. I am worried that this diet could be harmful to the future of one's health which is why I refuse to try such a diet. Could a nutritionist address this question?

Weight loss can be a very confusing endeavor. There is a wide choice of eating styles, each one claiming to be the "end-all" of dieting. The low-carbohydrate, high-protein, high-fat diet your friend is experimenting with will probably help her to lose weight, but most likely the loss will be only temporary. This diet may cause other health problems down the road.<br>
 <img src="images/clear.gif" width="20" height="1" border="0" alt="">
This particular fad diet, which resembles the ones promoted by Drs. Atkins, Stillman, and Scarsdale, is founded on the physiologic activity of the hormone called insulin which controls the conversion of food into energy and fat stores. While adequate insulin is required for proper food utilization, excessive insulin release can stimulate the metabolism of fat (adipose) tissue and actually cause you to gain weight.<br> 
 <img src="images/clear.gif" width="20" height="1" border="0" alt="">
The standard American diet is often high in refined carbohydrates (sugar and white flour), fats, and chemical additives and these force the body's insulin regulation out of balance. The end result is weight gain and a slow metabolism.<br>
 <img src="images/clear.gif" width="20" height="1" border="0" alt="">
Instead of eliminating the poor food choices that damage the insulin mechanism, these fad diets limit carbohydrate intake which temporarily disables the triggering of insulin release. Unfortunately, the increase of protein and fat in this diet can be extremely detrimental to other body systems. Electrolyte imbalance, increased cholesterol and triglycerides, heart disease, diabetes, and arthritis are just a few of the possible health consequences.<br>
 <img src="images/clear.gif" width="20" height="1" border="0" alt="">
Your best bet is to avoid all diets completely. Instead, consider beginning a lifetime of nutritious eating, enjoying natural, fresh, minimally processed, fiber-rich foods, less refined carbohydrates, and denatured, hydrogenated, saturated fats. You will then most likely reach your appropriate weight, naturally.

<b><a name="ProstateCancer">Prostate Cancer Update</a></b><p>
 <img src="images/clear.gif" width="20" height="1" border="0" alt="">I'm writing to offer additional information about my prostate cancer patient as reported in your magazine (Digest 15, Holistic Physician—Prostate Cancer). This information is crucial to understanding the significance of the case. The patient was diagnosed with a moderately differentiated prostate cancer at a major cancer institution in New York City in February 1994. His PSA (prostate specific antigen—a prostate tumor marker) then was 7.0, but 2 months later it was 8.3. He was first seen at our center in May 1994 at which time his PSA was 8.6.<br>
A radical prostatectomy or radiation was recommended by each of the conventional doctors he consulted, but the man was reluctant to undergo either because of their serious side effects. Instead, he chose to start an intensive alternative treatment program. Over the next 2 years, his PSA varied somewhat, in part depending on how closely he was following the program and the amount of stress in his life.<br>
 <img src="images/clear.gif" width="20" height="1" border="0" alt="">In June 1995, 16 months after his diagnosis, his PSA was 8.23, which was lower than when he began treatment with us 13 months earlier,  then in April 1996 it went up slightly to 9.19. During the summer of 1996, this patient did very little of the prescribed program and his PSA climbed to 12.02 by October 1996 when we saw him again. At that point, he went back on the program and his last PSA in November 1996 was 12.04. If he remains consistently on the program, I believe that his PSA will remain stable or go down.<br>
The important point with regard to this case is that his prostate has not significantly worsened over almost a 3-year period using only alternative cancer treatments, even though he has not been totally consistent in following them. A radical prostatectomy (surgical removal of the prostate gland) would have almost certainly caused complete sexual impotence and, probably, urinary incontinence.<br> 
 <img src="images/clear.gif" width="20" height="1" border="0" alt="">Radiation is also likely to have made him impotent and produced other side effects. Since the patient is happily married and has an active sex life, he is happy with his decision to avoid conventional procedures whose track record for success is quite questionable.
