<tt>On March 21, 1996 the US House of Representatives passed a bill 333-87 that
would add agents to the US Border Patrol, take other steps to reduce illegal
immigration to the US, and prevent legal immigrants from receiving welfare
assistance.  On May 2, 1996, the Senate approved a similar bill by a vote of
97-3, making it likely that some type of immigration reform law will be enacted
in 1996.</tt><p>
<tt>Both Senate and House versions of immigration reform are known as H.R.
2202.</tt><p>
<tt>About 3.2 million illegal aliens were estimated to have been in the US in
October 1992, and their number is believed to be increasing by about 300,000
per year.  Half of the settled unauthorized alien population in the US is
thought to have entered without inspection, and half are persons who entered
lawfully.  Most of the proposals in the new legislation are aimed at persons
who sneak across the borders.</tt><p>
<tt>The Senate conference committee that was assigned the task of reconciling
the separate bills was appointed in May; the House committee is expected to be
appointed in early June.  Congress is expected to vote on the resulting  bill
by summer.  President Clinton will probably sign a bill if it does not include
the House-passed provision that would allow states to deny K-12 education to
illegal alien children.</tt><p>
<tt>The House and Senate bills include three major sets of measures to reduce
illegal immigration and reduces the access of legal immigrants to welfare.
First, both provide for stronger border enforcement, adding 1,000 Border Patrol
agents per year for five years, bringing the total from 5,175 in 1996 to almost
10,000 by 2000.  Both call for a 14-mile "triple fence" on the US-Mexican
border south of San Diego, and would increase the penalties for smuggling
aliens into the US and for using false documents to obtain US jobs or welfare
assistance--document fraud could bring a $500,000 fine and 15 years in prison.
Both bills also permit the Attorney General to allow local police departments
to "seek, apprehend, and detain" illegal aliens who are subject to an order of
deportation.</tt><p>
<tt>Second, both bills introduce pilot programs to enable employers to verify
the status of newly-hired workers.  The Senate bill would give the President up
to eight years to test three verification programs and report the results back
to Congress, while the House measure specifies a three-year voluntary pilot
program for employers in five states -- California, New York, New Jersey,
Florida and Texas.  No national worker eligibility verification system could be
established, however, without another congressional vote.  Both bills narrow
the range of documents that persons seeking US jobs may present to employers as
proof that they are lawful workers from the current 29 to six.</tt><p>
<tt>Third, both bills seek to prevent LEGAL immigrants from obtaining welfare
benefits.  Under current law, immigrants must show that they will not become
"public charges" in the US, and this requirement is usually met by the US-based
sponsors of relatives immigrating.  They sign affidavits assuming financial
responsibility for their relatives.  If the pending legislation becomes law,
these affidavits will become legally binding.  </tt><p>
<tt>If immigrants apply for welfare assistance within 10 years of their arrival
(Senate), or before they become naturalized US citizens (House), the welfare
agency could "deem" or assume that the immigrant has access to his sponsor's
income and assets.  US residents who want to sponsor immigrants would have to
have incomes of at least 125 percent (Senate) or 200 percent (House) of the
poverty line ($14,700 for a family of four in 1993), up from the current
requirement of at least a poverty line income. </tt><p>
<tt>Under the proposed legislation, if the immigrant and sponsor's incomes are
so low that the immigrant nonetheless qualifies for assistance, the immigrant
may become deportable.  Under US law, an immigrant is deportable if she becomes
a "public charge," defined in pending legislation as receiving welfare
assistance for 12 months or more in a five-year period (Senate) or seven-year
period (House).  </tt><p>
<tt>The Senate bill makes illegal aliens eligible for emergency Medicaid,
school lunches and other nutrition programs, immunizations, and short-term
disaster relief, but permits legal immigrants to participate only in school
lunch and nutrition programs.</tt><p>
<tt>The Government Accounting Office in May reported that 25 percent of the
elderly supplemental security income recipients were legal immigrants.  About
two-thirds of the immigrants on SSI live in California, New York and Florida.
SSI was established in 1972 to help people who do not qualify for Social
Security benefits.  In 1996, the maximum SSI payment is $470 a month for an
individual and $705 for a couple.  In 1995, about 6.5 million people received
nearly $25 billion in federal SSI benefits, and $3 billion in state
benefits.</tt><p>
<tt>The House and Senate bills differ in three important areas.  The House
bill, but not the Senate bill, would permit states to deny K-12 education to
unauthorized alien children in the US.  There are believed to be at least
600,000 such children in US schools, half in California.  </tt><p>
<tt>Second, the House bill prohibits illegal alien parents from applying for
welfare benefits on behalf of their US-born and US-citizen children.  The US
citizen children remain eligible, but a legal US resident would have to apply
for benefits on their behalf.  Third, the House bill permits, under certain
circumstances, the immediate expulsion of foreigners who arrive in the US and
apply for asylum; the Senate removed a similar provision on a 51-49 vote.
</tt><p>
<tt>Many advocates are using the pending immigration legislation to preserve or
remove provisions affecting immigrants in anti-terrorism law signed in April
1996.  For example, under the "summary exclusion" procedures included in the
anti-terrorism law, beginning in November 1996, INS officers at ports of entry
will have final authority to exclude from the US aliens arriving without
documents, and those arriving with false documents, who request asylum.  Under
current US law, an alien may request a hearing with an immigration judge before
being removed from the US, and may seek judicial review of a denial of an
asylum application and order of deportation. </tt><p>
<tt>Similarly, the anti-terrorism law eliminates the possibility that legal
immigrants who have been in the US for at least seven years can avoid
deportation if they were convicted of felony crimes in the US.  The immigration
bill relaxes this a bit, saying that the immigrant must be <u>sentenced</u> to
five or more years in prison to be ineligible for 212(c) relief from
deportation.  In FY94, 4,100 legal immigrants asked to stay in the US after
being convicted of crimes, and 1,800 were allowed to stay.  </tt><p>
<tt>The anti-terrorism bill similarly does not permit immigration judges to
suspend deportation for unauthorized aliens who have been in the US seven or
more years if they entered without inspection.  In FY94, 4,300 unauthorized
immigrants asked to stay in the US, and 2,400 were allowed to stay.  The
immigration bill preserves suspension of deportation, renaming it cancellation
of deportation or removal.</tt><p>

<tt><u>Legal Immigration</u>.  The INS was criticized by Congressional leaders
of immigration subcommittees in May 1996 for "misleading" the public about
immigration levels.  Just before a crucial Senate vote March 28 on whether to
reduce legal immigration, the INS released the FY95 immigration numbers, which
showed that 720, 000 immigrants arrived in FY 1995, down 18 percent from
880,000 in FY 1993.</tt><p>
<tt>The agency said that the numbers showed that prudent planning and
management were making immigration levels controllable without new legislation,
and the Senate thereupon defeated an effort to reduce legal immigration.</tt><p>
<tt>Internal INS projections became public, however, revealing that the agency
expects immigration levels to rise in 1996 and 1997--some 100,000 to 200,000
visa applications were pending at the end of FY 1995 due to an administrative
logjam.</tt><p>
<tt>Advocates jumped to exploit the new data.  Those who want to reduce
immigration argued that the administration's use of numbers was another example
of the politicization of the immigration issue.  </tt><p>
<tt>Those who favor the status quo, or more immigration, argued that the
long-run level of legal immigration is about 850,000 per year, and that, in any
year, the number "admitted" may rise or fall by 10 to 20 percent as a result in
variations in INS processing, and because of fluctuations in the number of
visas requested by US employers.</tt><p>
<tt>On May 16, 1996, the House Immigration Subcommittee held a hearing on the
numbers issue, during which the INS was criticized by Lamar Smith, chair of the
immigration subcommittee for "misleading Congress" after trends in legal
immigration.  The INS projects about 953,000 immigrants and refugees in FY
1996. </tt><p>
<tt>The INS testified that the wild card in projecting legal immigration to the
US is the behavior of the 2.7 million illegal aliens who were legalized and
became permanent resident aliens under the Immigration Reform and Control
Act--1.6 million as LAWs (unauthorized aliens in the US before 1982 or persons
legalized under Section 245A of the INA), and 1.1 million as SAWs (Section
210).  It is estimated that spouses and minor children of legalized LAWs and
SAWs comprise 80 percent of the 1.1 million people in the second preference
backlog--70 percent are Mexicans.</tt><p>
<tt>According to the INS, most of the 911,000 spouses and minor children on the
second preference waiting list who want to join newly-legalized aliens in the
US are already in the US--101,000 applied for Family Unity protection from
deportation, and many of the rest are in the US illegally.  By one estimate,
about one-fourth of all immigrants "admitted to the US" in any year are already
in the US.</tt><p>
<tt>The timing and manner by which this second preference backlog is eliminated
play key roles in identifying the number of immigrants "admitted" to the US.
The backlog could be eliminated if legalized aliens naturalize, and petition
for the admission of their immediate families--LAWs could naturalize after
December 1993, and most SAWs after December 1995 (there is no quota on the
admission of family members of US citizens, and INS data do not differentiate
between US-born and foreign-born US citizens who petition for the entry of
their immediate relatives).</tt><p>
<tt>About 42 percent of the foreign-born residents of the US in the 1990 Census
were naturalized US citizens, and 23 percent of the Mexican-born residents had
become naturalized US citizens by 1990.  </tt><p>
<tt>The INS assumed that 45 percent of the newly legalized aliens would
naturalize, a higher percentage than usual for Mexicans because, to become a US
immigrant, the LAWs had to take an English and civics test that is similar to
the naturalization tests.  Among the LAWs, a survey suggested that there would
be one spouse or minor child to be admitted as an immigrant for each three
legalized aliens.  The INS assumes that each of the 1.1 million SAWs would
petition for a spouse or child.</tt><p>
<tt>The INS assumed that all of the family members of LAWs and SAWs are in the
backlog, and that an average 60,000 per year would be admitted to the US under
current laws, so that about 200,000 would remain in the second preference queue
in 2003.</tt><p>
<tt>As of May 10, 1996, at least 308,000 legalized aliens applied for
naturalization, representing 20 percent of the total eligible group.</tt><p>
<tt>A second factor changing immigrant admissions numbers is that, beginning in
the summer of 1995, aliens residing illegally in the United States when they
were eligible to become immigrants could adjust their status while remaining in
this country.  Because of delays in setting up the INS system to process these
immigrants, many of the aliens who applied for adjustment to immigrant status
in 1995 will be admitted as immigrants in 1996.</tt><p>
<tt>The number of Mexican-born US residents appears to have increased in the
1990s.  There were 4.3 million Mexican-born residents enumerated in the 1990
Census, 6.3 million in the March 1994 CPS, and 6.7 million in the March 1995
CPS.  However, the CPS reports that significantly more Mexicans arrived in the
1980s than does the Census, i.e, more Mexicans in the US in 1995 than in 1990
reported that they arrived in the 1980s.  This is a surprising result, because
some Mexican-born residents emigrate, and others die.  </tt><p>
<tt>An analysis by Jeff Passel suggests that the Mexican-born population in the
US is rising, but not by the 500,000 per year implied by 1990 Census-1994/95
CPS changes.  It appears that many SAWs were not enumerated in the 1990 Census,
but were in the US with their families in 1994-95, and reported that they
arrived in the US in the 1980s.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Criminal Aliens.</u> Under the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program
(SCAAP), the Department of Justice makes grants to states in accordance with
INS estimates of the number of illegal immigrants in state prisons. </tt><p>
<tt>According to Sen. Spencer Abraham (R-Mich), there are almost 500,000
convicted foreign-born felons in the US.  Aliens are first tried to determine
whether they committed a crime in the US.  If convicted, each is entitled to a
hearing before an immigration judge to determine if he/she is to be deported.
</tt><p>
<tt>Criminal aliens ordered to be deported may appeal to the US Board of
Immigration Appeals (BIA), asking to remain in the US because they e.g., have
families here.  The INS typically releases criminal aliens while they wait for
the outcome of these deportation hearings, since the alien has already been in
prison for the US crime committed, and GAO estimates that most criminal aliens
released commit additional crimes--77 percent of non-citizens convicted of
felonies are re-arrested at least one more time in the US.</tt><p>
<tt>To expedite deportations, the INS began to station agents and hearing
officers in federal and state prisons, so that the alien can ask to prevent
deportation before being released.  The INS has also begun to station agents in
county jails--Anaheim may be the first city in the US to have INS agents
permanently stationed in its jail in order to identify and deport all illegal
immigrants who have been arrested.  According to a survey conducted in Fall
1995, 35 percent of the Anaheim 's inmates were illegal aliens.</tt><p>
<tt>Pending immigration legislation includes government funding for a six-month
pilot program at Anaheim jail. </tt><p>
<tt>According to a report in the Los Angeles Times, of the 2,300 suspected
Mexican drug traffickers taken into custody in border areas in 1995, one in
four were sent back to Mexico because of jail overcrowding and lack of
resources to prosecute them in the US.  US Customs says that, in general,
prosecution is deferred if the smuggler has less than 125 pounds of drugs, or
if the defendant is a Mexican citizen. </tt><p>
<tt>One reason US jails are overcrowded is the large number of foreigners
detained by Operation Gatekeeper.  In the first week of May, 1996, of the 930
inmates housed at the Metropolitan Correction Center in Los Angeles, 49 percent
were charged with immigration law violations and 36 percent were being held for
drug offenses.</tt><p>
<tt>The INS is closing 30 interior Border Patrol offices and shifting the
agents to the border.</tt><p>
<tt>The INS has allocated $5 million to fly 5,000 Mexicans apprehended in the
US to the interior of Mexico in 1996--an average of $1,000 per person for
airfare and transportation from the airport to home communities.  The first 13
Mexicans were flown to Guadalajara in April 1996.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Employer Sanctions</u>.  On May 23, 1996, the INS announced that IBP of
Dakota City, Nebraska; Monfort Inc. of Greeley, Colorado; Excel Corp. of
Wichita, Kansas; and BeefAmerica of Omaha, Nebraska --meatpackers that employ
56,000 workers at 48 sites in ten states and represent about 80 percent of the
industry--agreed to participate in the INS's voluntary Employment Verification
Pilot (EVP) helps employers determine whether their non-citizen employees are
legally authorized to work in the United States.  </tt><p>
<tt>After hiring a new employee, employers participating in EVP send the
A-numbers and other information to an INS database via modem, and the INS
verifies the alien's right to work.  In California, an EVP arrangement with 234
employers who have 80,000 employees in Santa Ana and City of Industry,
including Disneyland, found that about 26 percent of all newly-hired workers
presented false documents to employers.  </tt><p>
<tt>These 234 California employers checked on the status of 11,500 non-US
citizens over seven months, and found that 2,948 were not legally authorized to
work.  In a midwestern meatpacking experiment, 27 percent of the non-US
citizens hired were found to have presented false documents.</tt><p>
<tt>It may be that more than one in four workers presented false documents,
since employers do not check on persons who assert that they are US citizens.
The INS does not seek to apprehend aliens who are denied work, under the theory
that inability to work in the US is enough of a deterrent.</tt><p>
<tt>In Santa Ana, south of Los Angeles, a bakery in the city's enterprise zone
that recruited workers through the city-run Economic Development Department
closed after INS inspections found that 47 of 62 workers were not authorized to
work in the US.  (Enterprise zones are state-designated areas that use tax
incentives to draw jobs to economically depressed districts.)  The city
screened workers to determine if they were economically disadvantaged, but not
for legal status. </tt><p>
<tt>An INS agent in 1995 estimated that almost 25 percent  of the workers in
222 meatpacking plants in Nebraska and Iowa were in the US illegally.  In 1995,
INS agents in Nebraska and Iowa arrested 704 people on illegal immigration
charges, nearly double the 363 arrests the office logged in fiscal 1994.  Some
of those apprehended reported that they paid $400 each to be transported from
the border to Chicago.</tt><p>
<tt>The Excel Corporation, a beef processor in Kansas, agreed to a new contract
affecting about 2,300 hourly workers, mostly Hispanics, that includes a 20 cent
per hour wage increase.  The 13-month contract also includes a stipulation that
if an employee's immigrant status changes and the employee notifies the company
of the change, the employee will not be disciplined for having earlier provided
false information.  </tt><p>

<tt><u>Internal Migration.</u>  California lost a net 143,000 residents to
other states in 1995, reflecting the slowdown in the state's population growth
in the first half of the 1990s.</tt><p>
<tt>During the 1980s, California gained a net 1.25 million residents from the
other 49 states.  Between 1990 and 1995, California lost a net 1.55 million
residents to other states.  California gained a net 1.4 million immigrants in
the first half of the 1990s, or almost 300,000 per year.</tt><p>
<tt>California, which had an estimated population of 31.6 million in 1995, is
expected to have 41 million residents in 2010.  California 's population growth
is fueled by births (over 600,000 per year) and immigration (over 300,000 per
year).</tt><p>
<tt>In reviewing population growth since 1980, demographer Hans Johnson notes
that California's population increased by 500,000 in 1980, a peak 900,000 in
1989, and then 100,000 in 1993.  Johnson's estimates, based on the assumption
that 91 percent of the 18 to 64 year old residents have drivers' licenses,
suggest that there was very high unauthorized immigration to California in the
late 1980s, and a high outmigration of US-born residents to other states.
</tt><p>
<tt>Estimates of illegal immigration based on apprehension data, by contrast,
report declining illegal immigration in the late 1980s.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Welfare.  </u>About 2.7 million of California's 32 million residents
receive cash assistance, including 20 percent of California's children.  About
17 percent of the US welfare recipients live in California but, because
California has a high cost of living, and because California has been
relatively generous, the $6.7 billion spent on cash assistance in California is
27 percent of US welfare spending.  </tt><p>
<tt>In the ongoing debate over how to reform welfare, Democrats stress offering
carrots to induce poor people to work--higher minimum wages, job training and
child care--while Republicans stress penalties for not working--time limits on
the receipt of assistance, lower grants, etc.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Politics.</u>  California politicians, beginning with Governor Pete
Wilson in 1994, link the state's problems to immigration and population trends.
A standard "new Democratic" analysis of the state's problems begins with
California's unique demography.  California is a big and ethnically diverse
state that is seeing its middle class move to other states.  </tt><p>
<tt>As one result, elderly and often wealthy white California voters resist new
taxes, while poor minority residents need more state-provided services than
their taxes pay for, from schools to criminal justice.  California faces the
challenge of building and staffing more schools for the current baby boom
entering K-12.  Prop 98 requires the state to maintain school funding, plus the
prospect of less money but the same responsibility in a federal health and
welfare block grant, while dealing with a growing criminal justice system.  By
some estimates, criminal justice is now California's largest industry.</tt><p>
<tt>Some historically African-American California cities are rapidly becoming
mostly Latino cities, as African Americans move out and Latinos move in.  East
Palo Alto is an example.  Between 1980 to 1990, the African American population
in East Palo Alto dropped from 60 percent to 42 percent, while the Latino
population increased from 14 percent to 36 percent.  Blacks are older-- in
1995, the school district had 29 percent black children, and 58 percent Latino
children.</tt><p>
<tt>California on May 23 announced that women seeking pre-natal care under
Medi-Cal will have to show proof that they are California residents.  The
prenatal care for needy women served 100,000 women in 1995 at a cost of $25
million ($250 each).</tt><p>
<tt>On May 24, a San Diego judge barred the "U.S. Citizens Patrol" from
policing the airport--the patrol was seeking to deter illegal immigrants from
using the airport to travel around the US.  The INS apprehends 20 to 25
unauthorized aliens at the San Diego airport each day.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Labor Markets.</u>  David Heer of USC in November 1994 surveyed
immigrants at day labor markets in southern California, at Mexican soccer
league games, patrons of catering trucks with Spanish menus, and persons in
three shopping centers, and found that 55 percent of the Mexican-born residents
live in areas that have mostly Mexican-born residents.</tt><p>

No Federal Reimbursement</a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt>On May 13, the US Supreme Court refused to permit Florida to sue the
federal government to recoup the cost of providing services to illegal aliens.
Florida in 1994 sued the US government for $1.5 billion for violating the 10th
amendment to the US constitution, which reserves powers not granted to the
federal government to the states.  Lower courts dismissed Florida's suit,
saying that it raised political rather than legal issues, and the Supreme Court
refused to hear it.</tt><p>
<tt>According to Florida's suit, the federal government's failure to prevent
illegal immigration caused Florida to incur costs to incarcerate illegal alien
criminals, educate children, and provide health care.  The federal district
judge agreed: "The court recognizes that the state of Florida is suffering
under a tremendous financial burden due to the methods in which the federal
government has chosen to enforce the immigration laws.... But recognizing these
facts does not create a legal theory under which this court may grant
relief."</tt><p>
<tt>The dismissal of the Florida suit may revive the two initiative campaigns,
Save Our State and FLA-187, that seek to get voter approval for Prop 187-style
measures in Florida -- 430,000 signatures are needed.  Florida had an estimated
322,000 illegal immigrants, about 10 percent of the national total, in October
1992.</tt><p>
<tt>Five other states -- New York, California, Arizona, Texas and New Jersey --
have had similar lawsuits thrown out by federal judges.</tt><p>

Agree on Migrant Rights</a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt><u>Mexicans' Rights</u>.  On May 8, the US and Mexico signed 11 agreements,
including a four-page "Memorandum of Understanding on Consular Protection" that
spells out the rights of legal and illegal Mexican nationals in the US.  The
MOU largely restates current US law and practice, and emphasizes that the INS
is to notify Mexican consular authorities when they detain pregnant women and
children.</tt><p>
<tt>Another MOU pledges that the US and Mexico will cooperate to crack down on
alien smugglers, and notes with "deep concern" the beatings and accidents
involving unauthorized Mexicans in southern California in April, 1996. There
were almost weekly incidents in southern California in April in which
immigrants trying to flee were injured or killed when the vehicles they were in
crashed.</tt><p>
<tt>On May 9, one of the two unauthorized Mexican aliens clubbed by 1996
Riverside county sheriffs on April 1, 1996 filed two suits seeking compensation
for civil rights violations.</tt><p>
<tt>Southern Californians continued to debate the beatings and accidents of
unauthorized aliens, with many immigration restrictionists arguing that the
deputies were justified in using force to apprehend the aliens.  If the border
were closed, they asserted, there would be no chases and beatings.  </tt><p>
<tt>The two beating victims have been featured at numerous rallies in support
of immigrant rights, prompting even some of those sympathetic to immigrants'
rights to worry about the backlash from a lawsuit filed by lawyers for the
immigrants, arguing that "the felons [the aliens] should not get a windfall
because of the deputies misconduct."  Mexico's aggressive support for
demonstrations and the suit was also criticized. </tt><p>
<tt>Smugglers who bring aliens across the 2,013-mile US-Mexico border for a fee
are raising their rates.  According to Border Patrol agents who interview
aliens after they are apprehended, fees for a guaranteed safe passage to Los
Angeles have risen from a maximum of $200 to $400 or more.</tt><p>
<tt>Mexico has begun to crack down on smugglers who bring non-Mexicans through
Mexico en route to the US.  In May, Mexican police arrested several smugglers,
and deported the aliens from Central and South America who were being smuggled
to the US.  </tt><p>
<tt>Smuggling people in Mexico is a federal crime punishable by two to 10 years
in jail--judges handed down prison terms to 700 smugglers in 1995, almost
double the 1994 total.  The Mexican Congress is likely to approve in September
a redefinition of smuggling to "organized crime," which would permit 20 years
in jail, and allow police to go after the persons behind the smugglers.</tt><p>
<tt>In Arizona, the U.S. Border Patrol launched a ''Stay Out, Stay Alive'' to
persuade potential illegal aliens not to try to enter the US through the
desert.</tt><p>
<tt>US Secretary of State Christopher led eight cabinet secretaries to Mexico
for the 13th US-Mexico Binational Commission meetings on May 7-8.  The meetings
involved over 300 officials from both countries.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Population.</u>  Mexico's population surpassed 91 million in 1995,
despite a steady decline in the population growth rate, according to a major
mid-decade census report issued April 25, 1996.  Mexico added 10 million people
between 1990 and 1995, but the growth rate slowed to 1.8 percent in 1995 from
two percent in 1990.  According to the Mexican census, the country's population
was 66.8 million in 1980, and 81.2 million in 1990.</tt><p>
<tt>Mexico is rapidly urbanizing--some 46 percent of Mexicans lived in cities
of 100,000 or more in 1995, up from 11 percent in 1970.  The percentage of
Mexicans living in towns of less than 2,500 fell from 41 percent in 1970 to 26
percent in 1995.</tt><p>
<tt>In 1995, Mexico City had 8.4 million residents, and the Valley of Mexico
that includes Mexico City had 16.4 million, including Ecatepec on the northern
outskirts with 1.5 million residents, and Nezahualcoyotl to the east with 1.2
million.  Guadalajara had 1.6 million people and a metropolitan area of 3.3
million in 1995, and Monterrey had 1.1 million and an urban area population of
2.9 million.</tt><p>
<tt>The Mexican peso, which has stabilized at about 7.5 pesos to $1 since Fall
1995, is considered to be increasingly overvalued by some analysts, since the
Mexican inflation rate of 30 percent far exceeds the US rate of three percent.
The peso is down 54 percent in nominal terms from its 3.4 pesos to $1 rate of
November 1994, but down only 19 percent in inflation-adjusted terms.</tt><p>
<tt>In mid-May, Mexico reported that exports--fueled by the peso
devaluation--were up 20 percent in the first quarter of 1996 versus 1995.
</tt><p>
<tt>A Mexican peasants organization, the National Union of Autonomous Regional
Campesino Organizations (UNORCA), in April, 1996 said that 80 percent of
Mexico's three million ejidatarios, and 2.5 million small farmers are now
vulnerable to bankruptcy and that NAFTA is to blame.  In late April, 1996, the
Mexican government announced a plan to provide $1 billion in credit and
technical assistance to 600,000 producers of grains on 11.5 million
acres.</tt><p>
<tt>With the opening of a 2,300-employee Samsung television assembly plant in
Tijuana on March 29, 1996, Mexico now has almost as many television
manufacturing workers as the US--25,000 in Mexico versus 30,000 in the US.
Samsung pays the assembly line workers--70 percent women with six or less years
of schooling--345 pesos for a 45-hour work week, or about $47 per week or $1
per hour.</tt><p>
<tt>Over 90 percent of the television sets assembled in Mexico are
exported--NAFTA eliminated tariffs on electronics imports from Mexico and
Canada.  Samsung will open a research &amp; development facility in San
Diego.</tt><p>
<tt>Mexico has a system of labor courts, and some have argued that, to attract
foreign investment, these courts have become "employer friendly."  For example,
many planned strikes do not result in plant shutdowns--to be legal, a labor
court must certify the strike.</tt><p>
<tt>On June 30, 1996, Presidents Clinton and Zedillo are scheduled to open a
new truck crossing port linking Calexico and Mexicali (pop 750,000).
Mexicali's maquiladoras are booming, a reflection of its stable, non-union
labor force, abundant water supplies from the Colorado River, and proximity to
the U.S. marketplace-- President Zedillo grew up in Mexicali. </tt><p>
<tt>There is apparently more cross-border movement by local residents.  Some
Mexicans legalized under IRCA reportedly are living in the US, but sending
their children to Mexico for schooling, and to get them away from gangs.

<tt>The US Department of Labor on May 3 issued its first-ever report on the
nation's garment workers.  Half of the sewing shops that were investigated had
violated federal labor laws.  There are about 22,000 sewing shops in the
US.</tt><p>
<tt>DOL encourages upstream garment manufacturers and retailers to police their
subcontractors and earn a place on DOL's "No Sweat" list of retailers that
monitor their suppliers.  JC Penny and Talbots were cited as companies that
bought clothing from sewing shops that violated wage and hour laws.</tt><p>
<tt>Some garment manufacturers have contracted with Cal Safety Compliance
Corporation in order to assure themselves that the sewing shops they use are in
compliance with labor laws.  The firm employs 52 inspectors to make quarterly
inspections of the shops.  According to Cal Safety, half of California's 4,000
licensed sewing contractors are not in compliance with labor laws.  In
addition, there are believed to be 1,000 unlicensed sewing shops in southern
California.</tt><p>
<tt>On May 6, 1996, the four Thais who operated the sweatshop in El Monte that
confined Thai sewers to an apartment complex were sentenced to six- and
seven-year prison terms and ordered to pay $4.5 million to 70 unauthorized
workers.</tt><p>

<tt>Immigrants in the US have higher rates of self-employment than US natives.
As immigration increased over the past 25 years, immigrants from particular
countries have become associated with particular businesses in many areas of
the US.  </tt><p>
<tt>For example, immigrants from India and their descendants own almost half of
the economy motels in the US.  US residents of Indian ancestry own over half of
the 620 Econo Lodges, and one-third of the 1,100 Comfort Inns.  Many of the
Indian-Americans who own US lodgings are named Patel, and many moved from the
western Indian state of Gujarati to Africa, and then came to the US via
Africa.</tt><p>
<tt>In New York, 53 immigrants from India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh were the
successful bidders for new taxi medallions, paying up to $180,000 each for the
right to operate a yellow cab in New York City.  </tt><p>
<tt>Other immigrant groups that have found a niche in the US economy include
Koreans who sell fruits and vegetables in major US cities, Palestinians who
operate small stores open for long hours in cities such as Detroit, and
Cambodians who operate doughnut shops in California.</tt><p>
<tt>The economic recovery in southern California is spotlighting the role of
immigrants in business.  According to some observers, southern California is
developing an economy based on small companies run by ethnics who are heavily
involved in international trade.  </tt><p>
<tt>The Koreatown section of Los Angeles, for example, was badly damaged in
1992 riots, but today is home to 500 toy distribution companies with 6,000
employees.  Los Angeles' industrial corridor, stretching 24 miles down Alameda
Boulevard, from downtown Los Angeles to Long Beach Harbor, has thousands of
immigrant-run businesses.  Manufacturing employs 717,000 workers in Los
Angeles, including 120,000 in garments, and many of these businesses are
immigrant-owned and immigrant staffed. </tt><p>
<tt>This industrial corridor is also the place where unions are attempting to
recruit new members.  The Service Employees International Union added 8,000
newly-unionized janitors to its membership in Los Angeles, virtually all of
them Latin American immigrants.  About 1.4 million Hispanics are union members,
making them eight percent of the 17.5 million union workers in the US.</tt><p>
<tt>Many of the Hispanic union leaders in southern California got their start
in union organizing with the United Farm Workers union.</tt><p>
<tt>In Orange county, almost one-fourth of all residents were born abroad, and
some analysts believe that immigrant entrepreneurship is spurring an economic
recovery in southern California, since "minority-owned" firms are increasing
their employment at faster than average rates.  There are believed to be
280,000 Latino-owned firms in California in 1996, up from 70,000 in
1982.</tt><p>
<tt>Many of the immigrant-owned businesses are small, employing the immigrant
and his family.  A USC study of self-employment among immigrants found that,
over their first 20 years of residence, rates of self-employment jump, from
eight to 21 percent for Asian immigrants.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Immigrant Investors.</u> Two US programs that aim to attract immigrant
businesses to the US are reportedly plagued by fraud.  Under one program,
authorized in IMMACT in 1990, up to 10,000 foreigners can be admitted as
immigrants each year if they invest at least $1 million--or $500,000 in rural
areas--and create at least 10 US jobs.  </tt><p>
<tt>There are numerous consultants advertising to would-be investors, but
relatively few takers--only 106 investors committed $1 million or more in FY94,
and 51 committed $500,000 or more (with their dependents, 444 persons were
admitted under the investor criteria).</tt><p>
<tt>One reason why so few foreigners invest in the US in exchange for permanent
immigrant visas is that, once they become US residents, their income earned in
other countries becomes subject to US taxes.</tt><p>
<tt>The other immigrant business program that is not living up to expectations
is the L-1 visa program, which permits foreigners with US business branches to
enter the US temporarily.  Originally designed in the 1970s to permit
multinationals to move key foreign personnel into the US easily, the program
has evolved into a way for small and sometimes fictitious "businesses" to bring
relatives to the US.  There were almost 100,000 L-1 admissions in FY94, up from
about 70,000 in FY91.   Over half of the visas in this category go to the
spouses and dependents of "intra-company" transfers.</tt><p>
<tt>There were 9,500 Turks enumerated in the 1990 Census in New York, mostly in
Sunnyside, Queens and, as economic conditions in Turkey deteriorate, their
number may now top 25,000.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Minimum Wages.</u>  Congress in May 1996 debated whether and how much to
raise the US minimum wage, currently $4.25 per hour, and there were hundreds of
stories about the likely effects of a minimum wage increase on the three to
four million US workers who now earn $4.25 per hour.</tt><p>
<tt>There are about 133 million persons 16 and older employed or looking for
work, and about 107 million are employed in the wage and salary jobs covered by
minimum wage laws.  About 12 million US workers--one in nine-- earn less than
$5.15 per hour, and thus would be affected directly by President Clinton's
proposal to increase the minimum wage to $5.15 by 1997.</tt><p>
<tt>The 90-cent increase would push annual pay for a full-time minimum-wage
worker from $8,500 a year to $10,300 and, with the earned income tax credit,
lift a breadwinner with a family of four above the $15,600 poverty line.</tt><p>
<tt>The discussions of whether to raise the minimum wage centered on four
issues.  First, how many jobs are likely to be eliminated at higher wages?
Employers argue that a 20 percent wage hike--$4.25 to $5.15-- would eliminate
about 600,000 jobs, or five percent of the 12 million jobs that pay $5.15 or
less.</tt><p>
<tt>Second, who earns the minimum wage, or, do minimum wage workers "need"
higher wages?  Although many minimum wage workers are teens working in fast
food restaurants, most are adult women employed in a variety of
services.</tt><p>
<tt>Third, how would the effect of higher minimum wage vary across regions and
industries?  For example, between 15 and 20 percent of all workers in states
such as Louisiana, Mississippi, and Arkansas earn less than $5.15 per hour,
versus five to eight percent of workers in the Northeast.</tt><p>
<tt>Fourth, would a higher minimum wage in fact be paid, or would many
employers disregard the law?  The Wall Street Journal on May 20 ran a page one
story that repeated estimates that two to three million US workers are
illegally paid less than the minimum wage.  The story noted that the penalty
for violating the minimum wage is to pay it--apparently not a strong sanction
for often cash-strapped businesses.</tt><p>
<tt>DOL found that 43 percent of 76 garment makers in southern California in
May 1996 were violating minimum wage laws.  Over the past five years, DOL has
normally assessed US employers about $20 million annually for violating minimum
wage laws--the frequency of minimum wage violations per 1,000 workers is
highest in southern states such as Florida, Georgia, Arkansas, and Texas.  Many
restaurants do not pay their employees who receive tips the one-half the
minimum wage (currently $2.13 per hour) as required. </tt><p>
<tt>Some economists argue that, instead of increasing the hourly minimum wage,
the Earned Income Tax Credit should be expanded.  The EITC paid $21 billion to
low earners in 1995--poor people with earnings report their earnings on their
tax forms, and the government mails them a check for up to 40 percent of their
earnings--e.g, family with two or more children and earnings of up to $8,890
could receive up to $3,556 in EITC payments in 1995.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Immigrant Mobility</u>.  The Wall Street Journal on April 26, 1996
discussed the Chiswick-Borjas debate over the economic progress of immigrants.
The writer noted that the first wave of immigrants after 1965 included a high
percentage of skilled Asians, so that, when Chiswick tracked their economic
mobility in the late 1970s and early 1980s, he found that they catch up in
earnings to similarly-educated US-born residents within 10 to 15 years.</tt><p>
<tt>However, subsequent immigrants, especially the relatives of Mexican
immigrants, had less education and motivation, what Borjas called "declining
quality," leading Borjas to predict that these immigrants would never catch up
to similar US-born residents in earnings.  Furthermore, Borjas argues that many
immigrants lack the "ethnic capital" needed to catch up economically to similar
US-born residents.  Hispanic immigrant networks, according to Borjas, are more
likely to lead them into the welfare system than into self-employment.</tt><p>
<tt>Borjas estimates that US-born workers lose $133 billion per year in lower
wages because of competition from immigrant workers, and that one-third of the
widening wage gap between high school drop outs and more educated workers is
due to immigrants.  </tt><p>

<tt>The EU Parliament has designated 1997 as European Year against Racism, and
called for the "isolation" of "racist parties" such as France's National Front
and the Austrian Freedom Party.</tt><p>
<tt>A report presented to the European Parliament by Dutch Christian Democrat
Arie Oostlander blamed "racist parties" for increasing xenophobia, racism and
anti-Semitism in Europe.  MEPs supported the report's call for a general ban on
discrimination.  The EP also agree that member states should make
naturalization and dual nationality and voting easier for immigrants, but it
stopped short of agreeing that member states should introduce measures
outlawing and punishing organizations engaging in racist and xenophobic
activities.  The report was adopted on May 9. </tt><p>
<tt>On May 8, Belgian officials detained Austria's Joerg Haider, one of the
targets of the EU's battle against xenophobia, for four hours because officials
believed he was trying to enter the country illegally.  Belgian immigration
officials held him in a room packed with illegal African immigrants until a
copy of his passport was faxed to the authorities.</tt><p>
<tt>Generous health and related benefits are being debated or cut in Europe to
increase the flexibility of the labor market and, hopefully, lead to more
jobs.</tt><p>
<tt>Some expect business to boom for employment services companies as Europe
deregulates labor markets--these companies provide temporary and permanent
employees to firms and become the "employers of record."  In the UK in 1993,
temporary help was 2.7 percent of total employment, 1.7 percent in the
Netherlands, and 1.1 percent in France--versus 1.4 percent in the US.</tt><p>
<tt>In May, the second and third largest employment services companies--Ecco of
France and Adia of Switzerland--agreed to merge, so that the combined company,
as well as Manpower, will each account for about 10 percent of the $77 billion
employment services market world-wide each year.</tt><p>
<tt>In April, France announced cuts in its health care programs, expected to be
approved by Parliament in Summer, 1996, and Germany announced plans to reduce
its budget deficit by $33 billion by reducing work and welfare
assistance.</tt><p>
<tt>Under a 1971 law, Italy guarantees pregnant women full pay during the last
two months of pregnancy and the first three months following the birth-- five
months at full pay, with 80 percent of the tab paid by the government.  In
1995, the Italian government paid $900 million in maternity benefits.  In
response, some Italian employers avoid hiring young women, or hire them in
part-time, contractual jobs.</tt><p>
<tt>There are few public or private child care facilities for children aged
0-3, but 90 percent of the children aged three to six are in "scuola materna,"
the state-supported kindergartens.</tt><p>
<tt>Italy has one of the lowest fertility rates in Europe--at current rates,
the average woman will have 1.2 births in her lifetime, versus two in the
US.</tt><p>

Court Upholds Asylum
Reforms</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a><a></a></a></a></a></a></a></h2>
<tt><u>Asylum/Aussiedler.</u>  The German Constitutional Court on May 14 upheld
the asylum reforms that went into effect on July 1, 1993--the reforms sharply
reduced the number of applicants for asylum in Germany.  The German court
emphasized that the reforms did not change an individual's right to asylum in
Germany if she faces political persecution at home.</tt><p>
<tt>The court upheld the three key reforms--safe countries of transit, safe
countries of origin, and detention for airport arrivals.  Under the reform,
applicants must apply for asylum in the first safe country that they enter--
Germany is surrounded by safe countries.  Second, the reforms define safe
countries of origin, to which applicants can be returned while their
applications are considered.  Third, applicants who fly to Germany can be
detained if they apply upon entry, or they must apply within three days after
their arrival--the court extended this period to apply to seven days in its
234-page ruling.</tt><p>
<tt>The number of foreigners seeking asylum in Germany was 9,500 in April,
1996, bringing the total to 40,000 for the first four months of 1996, including
7,900 Turks, 7,400 from Serbia and Montenegro, 3,200 from Iraq, and 2,000 from
Afghanistan.  In 1995, there were 127,937 applications for asylum, 127,210 in
1994, 322,599 in 1993, and 438,191 in 1992.</tt><p>
<tt>In 1995, about nine percent of the asylum seekers were granted asylum in
Germany.</tt><p>
<tt>During the first four months of 1996, some 54,200 ethnic Germans arrived in
Germany from the ex-USSR.  There were 218,000 Aussiedler arriving in Germany in
1995, and 222,600 in 1994.  About two million ethnic Germans have emigrated
from the former East Bloc to Germany since the 1989 opening of the Berlin Wall,
and four million still live in eastern Europe.</tt><p>
<tt>The German government denied a May 27 story in Der Spiegel that it was
considering limiting the influx of Jewish refugees from the former Soviet Union
because most of them were no longer persecuted, and are now economic refugees.
In 1990, Chancellor Helmut Kohl agreed to accept for humanitarian reasons an
unlimited number of Jews from the former USSR.  More than 45,000 Jews and their
relatives have migrated to Germany.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Bosnians.</u>  Some 200,000 of the 320,000 Bosnians living in Germany
are scheduled to return to Bosnia in the six months beginning  July 1, 1996--an
estimated 70 percent of them were ethnically cleansed from areas now under
Serbian control, so that they will have to return to areas controlled by the
Muslim-Croat federation.  </tt><p>
<tt>Some local Bosnian leaders in government-controlled parts of Bosnia -
almost all under the control of President Alija Izetbegovic's ruling Muslim
Democratic Action Party - are demanding that each person returning from Germany
bring "taxes" of up to DM10,000 (US $6,600) each.  A German assessment of
prospects for the return of Bosnians, and for peace in Bosnia, was very
pessimistic--the 16 Laender interior ministers on May 3 agreed that before
Bosnians can be returned, local safety must be guaranteed.</tt><p>
<tt>The UNHCR agrees.  On May 12, a UNHCR official said that most of the two
million Bosnians displaced by the war--including the one million elsewhere in
Bosnia--will not be able to return to their original homes because they will be
"unwanted strangers" in their old homes.</tt><p>
<tt>There are also believed to be 120,000 Kosovo Albanians in Germany-- mostly
failed asylum-seekers.  On May 16, the Serbian government agreed to take them
back into the reconstituted Republic of Yugoslavia--Serbia and Montenegro.
Germany said it will not pay Yugoslavia to expedite the Kosovo Albanians
return.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Labor Market</u>. The German government, seeking to make the labor
market more flexible, is permitting small employers to dismiss
workers--henceforth, employers with less than ten employees, up from the
current less than five, will be freer to dismiss workers.</tt><p>
<tt>The president of the "Bundesanstalt fuer Arbeit" or federal labor office on
May 1 said that Germans must accept the fact that labor market flexibility is
the key to creating jobs.  According to Jagoda, Germany would have two million
more jobs if the number of part-time jobs could be increased.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Turks/Vietnamese.</u>  Integration indicators for second-generation
Turks are mixed.  On the one hand, there are about 16,000 Turks studying in
German universities.  On the other hand, 86 percent of the foreign youth under
20 who are jobless have not learned an occupation.  Over 80 percent of Turkish
children in Germany have worker parents.</tt><p>
<tt>Some Turks advocate coordinated Turkish and German government efforts to
integrate Turks in Germany.  Turkey's Prime Minister Yilmaz visited Germany in
May, seeking German help to unfreeze EU subsidies for Turkey that have so far
been blocked by Greece, and asking Germany to protect and better integrate
Turks living in Germany.  </tt><p>
<tt>Yilmaz warned the German government that most Kurds seeking asylum in
Germany are "working undercover" for the outlawed PKK.  There are about 500,000
Turkish Kurds in Germany, out of a total Turkish population in Germany of 2.2
million. </tt><p>
<tt>Since 1992, 35 Vietnamese have been killed in Berlin, usually in fighting
with other Vietnamese gangs over the sale of non-taxed cigarettes.  Gang
leaders tend to operate from Czech or Polish border villages rather than from
Germany.</tt><p>
<tt>There are about 60,000 Vietnamese living legally in Germany, and another
40,000 more are thought to be illegally present--cigarette vendors are drawn
from the illegals ranks.  Vietnam agreed to accept many of the former East
German guest workers who were Vietnamese in exchange for $65 million in
assistance, but took only 67 Vietnamese in 1995, far less than the 2,500 in the
agreement.</tt><p>
<tt>Last year's clampdown on right-wing violence by the German government
resulted in a 44 percent drop in violent crime by neo-Nazis and right-wing
extremists, according to the Federal Office for the Protection of the
Constitution's annual report.  The report indicated that violent crimes with a
racist or right-wing motive fell from 1,489 in 1994 to 837 in 1995, the lowest
level since 1990.  Contributing to the drop in racist crimes is the tightening
of Germany's asylum laws, which halted much of the support for the extreme
right-wing political parties.  </tt><p>

<tt>Interior Minister Debre endorsed some of the 46 recommendations made by a
parliamentary commission April 16, 1996, arguing that "if we want to integrate
the legal foreigners in this country, we have to be intransigent with those who
are illegal."  Among the recommendations were to permit police to hold illegal
aliens for up to 45 days, versus the current 10 days, and to create files on
persons with whom new immigrants live in France.</tt><p>
<tt>The parliamentary commission's report created a furor by calling for an end
to automatic immigrant access to education and medical care, and for permitting
foreigners under 18 to be deported.</tt><p>
<tt>Another Parliamentary report released in May estimated that France is
losing $20 billion to $32 billion annually because of undeclared work by
illegal immigrants.</tt><p>
<tt>Polls suggest that 33 percent of the French want tougher laws against
illegal immigration, while 49 percent believe that better enforcement of
current laws will suffice.  Some expect France's political parties to compete
with one another to "get tough" on immigration to offset the appeal of the
National Front in elections in 1998.</tt><p>
<tt>In order to counter the National Front's "get tough" attitude on
immigration, the French Interior Minister has ordered the expulsions of several
planeloads of illegal immigrants.  Debre argues that tightening immigration
controls is the only way to stem the rise of the ultra-right wing.</tt><p>
<tt>The National Front accused the French government on May 20 of suppressing
official reports that show links between immigration and crime.  According to
the reports, which could not be verified by the government, there were 200
stone-throwing attacks on buses in 1995, and over 100 bus drivers had been
assaulted and more than 600 cars set on fire in Lyon. </tt><p>
<tt>In a May 25 interview with the Los Angeles Times, Jean Marie Le Pen
explained that the "growth in immigration...provoked unbearable economic and
social consequences... the idea of the 'nation' remains the most effective way
to protect security, liberty, identity and prosperity...One cannot make French
people from massive immigration.  To live in security and harmony, people need
a certain homogeneity."</tt><p>
<tt>Le Pen recommended that one solution to US immigration problems would be to
invest in Mexico, so that Mexicans can achieve "their aspirations inside their
own borders."  Mexicans, according to Le Pen, are easier to integrate in the US
than are Islamic immigrants in France, since Mexicans share many aspects of US
culture and Christianity.</tt><p>
<tt>Film star Brigette Bardot attacked Muslims for slaughtering sheep to
celebrate religious holidays.  Bardot, though married to a local leader of Le
Pen's National Front party, supports the Chirac government.  Bardot complained
that while churches sit empty because of a lack of priests, mosques are being
built throughout France.  According to Bardot, France has been invaded by
foreigners, with the blessing of the government.</tt><p>

<tt>As the Asylum and Immigration Bill made its way through the British
Parliament, a Seasonal Agricultural Workers Scheme was added to permit British
farmers to employ, from May through November, up to 10,000 Eastern Europeans as
farm workers.  The bill will introduce employer sanctions, and some farmers
feared that they would not be able to recruit enough short-term casual labor to
harvest crops.</tt><p>
<tt>Since World War II, foreign students have been able to work temporarily on
British farms.  Foreign students are paid the same as UK workers at wage levels
set by the Agricultural Wages Board.</tt><p>
<tt>On May 9, the British government defeated an opposition move to eliminate
restrictions included in the Asylum and Immigration Bill on council housing for
asylum seekers and certain categories of immigrants.  The government was also
able to defeat an cross-party move to maintain child benefits for
asylum-seekers who were being denied other social security benefits.  A May 2
amendment to the bill giving police and immigration officers the power to stop
and search people they suspected of being illegal immigrants was also defeated.
</tt><p>
<tt>The number of people applying for asylum in the UK rose by 11,000, to
44,000, in 1995.  Most applicants are from Nigeria, Somalia, India, Pakistan
and Sri Lanka.  </tt><p>
<tt>The government says that since January 1996, when new rules to cut benefits
to "bogus" asylum seekers went into effect, the number of asylum seekers
declined from 11,563 the previous quarter to 8,069.  Figures for April showed
asylum applications dropped from an average monthly number of 3,690 to 2,068.
Only 1,308 of the claims were lodged by people already living in the country--
the lowest number since February 1994.</tt><p>
<tt>Britain in April decided not to deport a Saudi dissident to placate Saudi
Arabia, reversing a January 1996 decision to send him to the Caribbean island
of Dominica after a court ruled that the UK had not shown that Dominica was a
safe haven for the dissident.  </tt><p>
<tt>The Saudi dissident was "given leave to remain" in the UK with his family
for four years.  This status permits him to leave and re-enter the UK.</tt><p>
<tt>The Saudi government has assured British officials that they will not
retaliate against British firms because of the dissident's activities. </tt><p>
<tt>Saudi Arabia had warned Britain that it was putting at risk trade links
worth billions of dollars a year by allowing a Saudi dissident to remain in
London. Mohammed al-Masari has published reports accusing the Saudi royal
family of corruption and human rights abuses.</tt><p>

<tt>Since the USSR was formally dissolved in 1991, some nine million people
have been uprooted, including at least two million people who fled regional
conflicts like those in Tajikistan and Georgia.  In May 1996, there was a
conference organized by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the
International Organization for Migration and the human rights division of the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.</tt><p>
<tt>There are believed to be about six million migrants in the CIS states,
according to the IOM, including 2.5 million refugees and displaced persons.
Some predict that another two to four million ethnic Russians will move to
Russia within the next five years.</tt><p>
<tt>Some 2.7 million of the Russians outside Russia reportedly moved to Russia
over the past three years.  According to the Institute of Economic Forecasts of
the Russian Academy this has compensated for the natural decrease in the
Russian population.  Over the past 10 years Russia's death rate has been about
one million per year with a much smaller number of births.  </tt><p>
<tt>The Ukrainian government has challenged the argument that the break-up of
the USSR left 25 million Russians outside Russia.  The 25 million figure, which
comes from the 1989 Census of the USSR, included 11 million ethnic Russians in
Ukraine.  However, the Ukrainian government argues that many of the ethnic
Russians in Ukraine are "Ukrainians who speak Russian." </tt><p>
<tt>The IOM has signed a migration agreement with the Ukrainian government to
provide technical cooperation, information and assist with the return of
migrants.  </tt><p>
<tt>The Ukraine has received over 300,000 illegal migrants since the collapse
of the Soviet Union.   </tt><p>
<tt>Russia's Federal Border Service reports that they have deported about 367
Chinese from the Maritime Territory since the beginning of the year.  The
Chinese normally enter the country with tourist visas then do no return home.
</tt><p>
<tt>Russia in April announced that food imports would be restricted after July
1, 1996--about 45 percent of Russia's food is imported.</tt><p>
<tt>Some 6,000 Russian companies have received permission to employ
foreigners.</tt><p>

<tt>The Asean Trade Union Council (ATUC) in mid-May announced at an
International Labour Organisation-ATUC symposium that it would urge governments
and employers to phase out migrant workers and replace them with local
workers.</tt><p>
<tt>The ATUC urged that the recruitment of migrant workers be done on a
government-to-government basis, or by reputable employment agencies duly
registered with the government.</tt><p>
<tt>On March 1 and 2, the leaders of Asia and Europe held the Asia-Europe
Meeting (ASEM) summit in Bangkok to discuss common issues.  The EU would like
to discuss human rights, while the Asian countries would like to concentrate on
economic cooperation and technology transfers.</tt><p>
<tt>Thai activists pushed the summit members to adopt the UN convention of
rights of migrant workers and family members and minimum standards for the
treatment of  smuggled aliens. </tt><p>
<tt>Most Asian governments have not signed the 1990 United Nations convention
on the rights of migrant workers and their family members, nor taken steps to
fulfill the 1995 Beijing platform for action to against human trafficking
networks.  In many cases, children are trafficked--there are an estimated one
million child prostitutes in Asia.</tt><p>
<tt>Hong Kong and the Philippines urged 500 delegates participating in an
agenda-setting meeting for the 18-nation APEC annual summit to include
provisions that would make labor migration easier.  One participant said that
an APEC labor migration agreement may be signed at the 1998 annual
meeting.</tt><p>
<tt>The November, 1996  meeting is scheduled to be held in the
Philippines.</tt><p>
<tt>The UN Commission on Human Rights asked for better protection of women
migrant workers.  The resolution, adopted in April, 1996, calls on countries to
implement legislation to prevent violence against women and to prosecute
offenders.  </tt><p>
<tt>The Global Alliance against Trafficking in Women urged governments to adopt
a set of "standard minimum rules" to protect the rights of women laborers and
those forced into prostitution.  According to the Alliance, female victims are
often prosecuted, and traffickers are often prosecuted under immigration rather
than tougher criminal laws.</tt><p>
<tt>The International Labour Office has taken a special interest in 1996-97 in
women workers, including migrants working outside their country of origin, and
women employed in foreign-owned firms that receive special incentives to invest
in their country of nationality.</tt><p>
<tt>The ILO estimates that some 800,000 Asian women leave their countries of
origin for jobs abroad each year.  An ILO report blames unscrupulous labor
brokers and weak laws for permitting the emigration of Asian women to reach
such high levels.  However, instead of recommending more regulation of women
migrants, the ILO recommends that women be provided with more information
rather than regulation.</tt><p>
<tt>The ILO is also launching a major study of export processing zones, the 230
areas in 70 countries in which special rules apply to foreign firms that
establish factories.  So-called maquiladoras employ almost 40 million local
workers worldwide to assemble goods, usually for re-export.  Most of the
world's export processing zones are in Asia--there are at least three million
workers employed in 64 zones in Asia, plus 14 to 40 million more workers in
Chinese special economic zones.</tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC18">Thailand:
Two Million Illegals</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>?
</a></h2>
<tt>Thailand's security forces estimate that there may be over two million
unauthorized foreign workers in the country, four times the mid-1995 estimate
of 590,000.  The official government estimate is 500,000 illegal immigrants, of
whom 300,000 are from Burma.  The rest are from Cambodia, Laos, and China.
Most are employed in fishing, farming, construction and the textile and
footwear industries.</tt><p>
<tt>The Thai Immigration Bureau arrested 219,455 illegal immigrants between
1990 and June, 1994.</tt><p>
<tt>Thailand has a work force of 35 million, and 10 percent belong to unions.
The unions complain that illegal aliens depress wages--the Thai minimum wage
which is 135 to 145 baht (about four dollars) a day.  On the island of Phuket,
illegal but skilled Burmese workers reportedly work for 70 and 150 baht per
day.  Thai employers can be fined 60,000 baht for each illegal worker they
hire.</tt><p>
<tt>Thailand is considering permitting Burmese workers to be employed legally
in border provinces if employers pay insurance fees of 5,000 baht per
worker.</tt><p>
<tt>Dr. Kritaya Archavanitkul, of the Population and Social Research Institute
at Mahidol University, reported in "Policy Options for the Importation of
Foreign Labour into Thailand" that it is very difficult to make sustainable
foreign worker policies because reliable data on the extent of labor shortages
and the number of foreign workers are inadequate.</tt><p>
<tt>Thai officials report an increase in foreign beggars, who are attracted to
the country because of the tradition of Buddhists giving alms to the poor.
Many come from the neighboring countries of Cambodia and Burma.  Most beggars
earn $4-12 per day. </tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC19">Singapore</a></a></a></a></a>:
Reduce Dependence</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt>Singapore's Labor Minister warned the construction industry to improve its
productivity rather than rely on foreign workers.  According to Construction
Industry Development Board figures, more than 85 per cent of the tradesmen and
general labour in Singapore's construction industry are foreign workers, and 90
percent of the foreign construction workers are unskilled.  Despite a levy of
S$440 per month for each unskilled foreign worker, and S$200 for every skilled
worker, the number of foreign workers is increasing.</tt><p>
<tt>The levy helps to prop up the wages of local workers who compete with
foreigners, and allows the Singaporean government to extract some of the wage
gap that motivates migration.</tt><p>
<tt>Singapore phased in a tough new strict liability standard in construction,
making general contractors liable for the labor law violations of
subcontractors.  The revised Employment of Foreign Workers Act went into effect
on March 1, 1996, and three general contractors are being assessed fines for
the 100 illegal foreign workers brought to their work sites by
sub-contractors.</tt><p>
<tt>On May 15, the labour ministry said it would seek prison terms for
contractors who hire illegal workers, even for a first offense--two contractors
were jailed for eight months and 10 months on first offenses.  Since 1995,
there have been 361 employers fined, including one firm that paid S$312,000 for
hiring 26 illegal workers, or $12,000 per worker.</tt><p>
<tt>In January, 1995, Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew said that Singapore had
50,000 foreign supervisors, managers and professionals, and another 300,000
blue-collar foreign workers.  Some 9,000 to 10,000 illegal foreigners are found
in Singapore each year.</tt><p>
<tt>Some researchers argue that industries that have high proportions of
foreign workers, such as manufacturing and construction, are less likely to
take steps in their personnel policies to accommodate local workers.  For
example, retailing, which is not allowed to employ foreign workers, offers many
part time jobs.  Singapore's labor ministry says that there are potentially
620,000 housewives and retirees who could work in Singapore. </tt><p>

Vietnamese escaped after rioting for two days to protest their return to
Vietnam.  The rioters burned 17 buildings, including the building housing their
records, in the hopes of slowing their repatriation.</tt><p>
<tt>The US sought to encourage returns by promising to give Vietnamese in the
camps before October 1, 1995 one more chance to apply for asylum in the US
after their return to Vietnam--some 2,000 to 6,000 more Vietnamese might come
to the US under this plan.  Each returning Vietnamese receives $240 from the

Restricts Foreign Workers</a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt>On May 1, 1996, China introduced new restrictions on foreigners working in
the country, and on internal migrants, in a bid to preserve "social order."
The Regulations on the Management of Foreign People's Employment in China say
that only foreigners with "special skills" will be permitted to work in China,
and they must obtain licenses by June 30, 1996.</tt><p>
<tt>Under a 1993 regulation, foreign job-seekers were obliged to register with
the State Bureau of Foreign Experts (SBFE) and apply to "Chinese intermediary
organizations" before looking for work in China.</tt><p>
<tt>An estimated 180,000 foreigners are currently employed in China, according
to the official Xinhua news agency, and 12 million Chinese are employed by
foreign joint venture companies.</tt><p>
<tt>State enterprises have an estimated 40 million redundant employees, and
there are a further 124 million "surplus" farm workers, plus 80 million migrant
workers.  China abandoned "employment for life" in 1986.</tt><p>
<tt>China's household registration system, established in 1958 to regulate
rural-urban migration, assigns persons at birth to agriculture or urban
residences, and, until recently, this distinction governed access to housing,
employment, and government services.  There are three major types of internal
migration within China--de jure permanent (officially acknowledged changes in
household registration), de facto permanent, and temporary--both are moves that
do not result in changes in household registration.</tt><p>
<tt>Schools in major cities such as Beijing, Shanghai and Tianjin began in
March to offer education to the children of migrant workers.</tt><p>
<tt>One analysis of migration patterns within China confirmed the "migration
hump" hypothesis, i.e., that increased development temporarily INCREASES
emigration.</tt><p>

 Detained Foreigners Can Work in Ag</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt>The Malaysian government in mid-May announced that the 11,000 illegal
workers being detained could obtain an "amnesty" or legal work permit if they
agreed to work in agriculture.  There are believed to be up to 100,000 illegal
workers employed on plantations in peninsular Malaysia.  Plantation employers
may request detained foreign workers from Indonesia, Bangladesh, Pakistan and
Thailand through July 31, 1996.</tt><p>
<tt>The government initiated the program to reduce the amount of money spent on
detention centers.  </tt><p>
<tt>Malaysia's Manpower Department opposed the scheme, arguing that offering
amnesty to illegal foreign workers in detention camps will encourage more
illegal immigration, and not encourage labor-saving mechanization in
agriculture.  Unions agreed.</tt><p>
<tt>The Federation of Malaysian Manufacturers' Malaysian Electrical and
Electronics Industry Group (FMM-MEEIG) asked the government to relax rules on
importing foreign workers, so that the industry can restructure and reduce its
dependence on foreign labor.   Under current procedures, a Foreign Workers Task
Force handles each employer request for foreign workers, and the manufacturing
sector is only allowed to recruit foreign workers from Bangladesh, Indonesia,
Pakistan and Thailand.</tt><p>
<tt>Many foreign investors want the levy on each foreign worker--doubled on
January 1, 1996; M$ 200-M$ 400 per month for professional and management
categories and M$70 to M$ 150 for manufacturing and construction--to be waived
for new investments in Malaysia.</tt><p>
<tt>A wildcat strike by foreign workers at the Kuala Lumpur International
Airport under construction brought a reminder that foreign workers can be
deported for striking.  According to the Labor Minister, "Going on strike is
not the Malaysian way of resolving industrial issues."  There were in May 1996
some 17,173 workers, including 7,623 foreigners from 49 countries, employed by
39 contractor at the KLIA site.  The largest groups of foreigners are from
Indonesia (4,407), followed by Bangladeshis (1,074), and workers from Myanmar
(391).</tt><p>
<tt>The Malaysian government announced that, beginning January 1, 1997, foreign
workers would no longer be permitted to be employed to pump gas.  In response,
several gas station chains announced that they would phase in machines that
permit drivers to swipe their credit card and get gas by self service.</tt><p>
<tt>The Seventh Malaysia Plan will attempt to attract women and retirees to
join the labor force in addition to phasing out labor-intensive industries.
Over the next five years the government plans to restrict the importation of
foreign labor to agriculture, construction and domestic services.  </tt><p>
<tt>The government predicts that by the end of the Seventh Malaysia Plan there
will be 781,000 legal foreign workers in the country.   </tt><p>
<tt>The Malaysian government has established a special task force to tackle the
issue of land encroachment by foreign settlers.  The first meeting, which had
20 representatives from different government agencies was held on May 22, 1996.

age restriction on children entering Hong Kong on one-way permits from China
after July 1, 1996.  This means that thousands of mainland children will be
allowed to join their Hong Kong families.  Under current procedures, only
children outside the school-age range - under five or between 16 and 20 - are
eligible to migrate to Hong Kong.  Despite eliminating the age restrictions,
the director of education says there will still be enough room in HK
schools.</tt><p>
<tt>The Hong Kong government increased the daily immigrant quota from 105 to
150 people in July 1995.  Of the 45 additional places, 30 were given to
mainland children who will have right of abode in Hong Kong after the Chinese
take over in 1997.  The remaining slots went to persons separated from their
spouses for 10 years or more.  </tt><p>
<tt>Hong Kong's legislative council narrowly passed a bill that allows the
government to detain boat people not formally rejected for repatriation by the
Hanoi government.  The law was enacted to counter a recent ruling by the Privy
Council which deemed it illegal to detain anyone whom Hanoi was not willing to
accept back.  The ruling resulted in the release of hundreds of asylum-seekers
from camps in Hong Kong, mostly ethnic Chinese who are not considered
Vietnamese by Vietnam.  </tt><p>

<tt>Christmas Island, a remote island 1,240 miles off Australia's north west
coast, has been the target of the largest influx of Asian boat people in over a
year.  Over 250 people in four boats, most from southern China, landed on the
island the second week of May.  Australian immigration officials say it is too
early to tell if another wave of asylum-seekers is on its way.  </tt><p>
<tt>The last major wave of boat people was in late 1994 and early 1995, when
over 800 Vietnamese born ethnic Chinese landed on Australia's northern shores.
Most were Vietnamese-born ethnic Chinese who said they had been discriminated
against by Chinese authorities.</tt><p>
<tt>Despite a pledge not to reduce immigration, the newly-elected conservative
government is apparently planning to reduce the number of refugees accepted by
Australia from 15,000 to 10,000 per year, thereby saving about $12 million per
year.</tt><p>
<tt>Australia in 1993 permitted 29,000 Chinese to remain after the June 4, 1989
Beijing crackdown and, as their family members join them, China has become the
third leading country of immigration to Australia, after Britain and New
Zealand.  The 19,500 Chinese students and their 9,500 spouses and children were
granted permanent residence in November 1993.</tt><p>
<tt>The Australian Immigration Minister proposed an immigration plan in May
1996 that would award extra points to immigrants who promise to live outside
Sydney and Melbourne for at least two years after their arrival.  Under the
current system, an extra five points are awarded to applicants in the family
category, such as siblings, non-dependent children and some parents, sponsored
by people living in regional areas--the number of points may be raised to 20,
or 20 percent of the 100 needed for admission.</tt><p>

<tt>The Knesset State Control Committee released a report in May 1996 that
asserted that 10 percent of Israel's workers are foreigners--100,000 working
legally, and 100,000 illegal workers, including an estimated 10,000 illegal
Poles.</tt><p>
<tt>Many politicians are echoing former Jerusalem mayor Teddy Kollek, who
asserted in April that Israel may be creating a "guest worker" problem of
German proportions by importing 80,000 mostly Thai and Romanian workers.  Other
politicians call the foreign worker issue a "time bomb"that "threatens the
country."</tt><p>
<tt>Kollek argued that Israel rely on its own and Palestinian workers.</tt><p>
<tt>Until February 24, 1996, the first suicide bombing, some 80,000
Palestinians were employed legally within Israel's borders, and another 40,000
to 50,000 worked illegally as day laborers in Israel.  Today, the number has
been reduced to about 15,000 daily commuters--including 7,000 Palestinian
workers over the age of 40.  The PLA estimates that 60 percent of Palestinians
are jobless, and that border closures cost $6 million in losses each
day.</tt><p>
<tt>In May 1996, Israel authorized the entry of another 10,000 foreign workers
from Bulgaria and Romania to take the place of Palestinians who are barred from
Israel.</tt><p>
<tt>In the hotly contested election on May 29, 1996, it was revealed that
500,000 Israelis live outside Israel, usually in the US.</tt><p>

<tt>Several ships filled with Liberians fleeing fighting were initially turned
away from neighboring country ports by countries that feared the Liberians
would not leave.  </tt><p>
<tt>In mid-May, about 2,000 Liberians who paid $75 each to flee fighting in
their country on a Ghana-bound Nigerian freighter on May 5 were pushed out to
sea after their ship was partially fixed in the Abidjan, Ivory Coast.  There
are already about 350,000 Liberians in the Ivory Coast as a result of the
six-year civil war.  The UNHCR estimates that more than 750,000 people have
left Liberia in since the fighting started in 1989. </tt><p>
<tt>Ghana later allowed the Bulk Challenge ship to land after passengers
reportedly rioted, and aid agencies provided them with water and food.  West
African peacekeepers in Monrovia, Liberia took steps to prevent Liberians from
boarding outgoing ships.</tt><p>
<tt>Nigeria led the 16-member Economic Community of West African States
peacekeeping force, ECOMOG, established in 1990 to keep the peace in Liberia.
However, many Liberians renamed the peacekeeping group "Everything That Could
Move Is Gone," a reference to the peacekeepers tendency to strip Liberia of
everything from its mineral wealth to factory equipment.  There were apparently
stolen UN vehicles and equipment on the Bulk Challenge ship.</tt><p>
<tt>Liberia, founded in 1847 by freed American slaves, has a population of
about three million--an estimated 80 percent of Liberians have been displaced
by the ongoing civil war.</tt><p>

<tt>Data on the Foreign-Born from the October 1994 CPS.  1996.  US Department
of Labor, International Labor Affairs Bureau, Bulletin 3, May.</tt><p>
<tt>Since January 1994, the monthly Current Population Survey of households has
included information on place of birth and year of immigration.  In October
1994, there were 14 million foreign-born persons in the US labor force, and 118
million US-born workers, making foreign-born workers about 11 percent of the
132 million labor force.  Half of the foreign-born workers--6.4 million--were
Hispanic, and two-thirds of these immigrant Hispanics were born in
Mexico.</tt><p>
<tt>Foreign-born men are more likely to be in the US labor force, and
foreign-born women are less likely to be in the labor force.</tt><p>
<tt>About 78 percent of foreign-born men (53 percent of foreign-born women),
and 74 percent of US-born men (59 percent of US-born women), were in the labor
force in October 1994, meaning that they were employed or unemployed and
looking for work.</tt><p>
<tt>Harris, Nigel.  1996.  The New Untouchables: Immigration And The New World
Worker.  New York: St Martin's. </tt><p>
<tt>This book argues that countries such as the United States, that define an
American way of life in cultural, political and economic terms, look at
nationality as a choice for individuals, so that immigrants are encouraged to
Americanize and naturalize.  Ethnic-origins can be reflected in hyphenations,
such as Italian-American.</tt><p>
<tt>In Europe, by contrast, the sense of nationhood is more tribal: a nation
consists of its indigenous peoples, even some who have left.</tt><p>
<tt>Harris argues that governments do not impede the movement of the rich or of
the employees of multinational corporations, and they will not be able to
restrict the migration of the unskilled.  The agents who move unskilled workers
across borders--labor workers and contractors "bore like termites through the
fortifications of the state to create supply and demand" for foreign
workers.</tt><p>
<tt>Williamson, Chilton, Jr.  1996.  The Immigration Mystique: America's False
Conscience.  New York: Basic Books.</tt><p>
<tt>This book challenges the ''myth'' that immigration was always a blessing
for America.  Williamson sees the massive immigration from 1870 to the 1920s as
the start of great and disruptive changes, citing gradual but persistent
negative effects on national identity, social and political order, population
growth and the environment.</tt><p>
<tt>Today's immigrants, Williamson argues, embrace multiculturalism and
challenge the very idea of a special American identity.  Today's immigrants
allegedly press for a larger and ever-more intrusive government, thus
undermining traditional American concepts of personal liberty and
self-reliance.</tt><p>
<tt>Sowell, Thomas.  1995.  Migrations and Cultures: A World View. New York:
Basic Books.</tt><p>
<tt>In this book, Sowell asks what makes immigrants prosperous by examining six
high-achieving migrant communities, from German migrants to the Eastern Europe
and Russia to "overseas Chinese" in Asia.  The answer, according to Sowell, is
human capital -- education and skills -- and cultural capital -- risk-taking,
self-reliance, thrift, cohesion, work habits, and concern for their children's
future.  </tt><p>
<tt>There is a chapter on the migratory history of Jews, Germans, Japanese,
Chinese, Indians and Italians.  According to Sowell, "Nothing is more common
than to have poverty-stricken immigrants become prosperous in a new country and
to make that country more prosperous as well."</tt><p>
<tt>Sowell has three themes.  First, not all cultures are equal in their
ability to prosper.  Second, it makes no sense to invite immigration from the
Third World into industrial countries, since the immigrants bring with them too
little cultural capital to succeed.  Third, government intervention in
industrial countries cannot overcome the lack of cultural capital and guarantee
immigrant success.</tt><p>
<tt>Sowell repeats a theme of his earlier books that avoiding reliance on
government is the key to a group's economic success.  Thus, Sowell emphasizes
that Japanese immigrants in the US were able to prosper despite governmental
discrimination.</tt><p>

<tt>The average GNP per capita in 1994 was $4,600 in the 159 countries on which
the World Bank assembles data--it ranged from almost $40,000 for each of the
40,000 residents in Luxembourg to $130 for Ethiopians.</tt><p>
<tt>Faist, Thomas. 1995.  Social Citizenship for Whom? Young Turks in Germany
and Mexican Americans in the United States.  Avebury: Aldershot, England.
</tt><p>
<tt>This three-part, 248-page book compares the different systems of two
countries to integrate young adults into the labor market.  The study compares
Turks in Germany and Mexicans in the United States, both of whom have similar
disadvantaged situations.  The author recommends a guaranteed income for school
leavers to help them transition to the labor market.  </tt><p>
<tt>The first part of the book outlines the theoretical framework of how the
school-work proceeds.  The second part explores the empirical research by the
author in the cities of Duisburg, Germany and Chicago.  Part three summarizes
the findings and offers policy recommendations for eliminating the second-class
citizenship of many Turks in German and Mexican-Americans.</tt><p>
<tt>Menchaca, Martha. 1995. The Mexican Outsiders: A Community History of
Marginalization and Discrimination in California.  University of Texas Press:
Austin, Texas.</tt><p>
<tt>A 250-page, 10-chapter paperback book is billed as an ethnographic history
about how social injustice has affected Mexicans in the United States.  The
work is based on research done in Santa Paula, California.  The first chapter
describes the land tenure system in California in the late eighteenth century,
and then moves on to how this resulted in "social separateness" in the
community in the 19th century.  </tt><p>
<tt>The book includes chapters on: school segregation, farm labor unions,
desegregation attempts, segmentation of the farm labor market and racism.

<tt>Bach, Robert.  1996.  Becoming American, Seeking Justice.  This report
presents the results of 2,500 telephone and 700 in-person interviews with
"working poor" immigrants in the US--practically all persons had incomes low
enough to participate in assistance programs, and about 30 percent received
public assistance.</tt><p>
<tt>The focus of the interviews was on the legal needs of immigrants, and their
major need was for legal assistance to deal with housing issues--one in three
had a housing problem, and 20 percent thought they had been discriminated
against in housing.  Auto-related consumer problems were second, and problems
with health care providers were third.  Immigrants were more satisfied with the
help that they got from non-lawyer notarios (70 percent satisfaction) than they
were with the help that they got from legal assistance lawyers (54 percent
satisfaction).</tt><p>
