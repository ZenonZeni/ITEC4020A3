HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE APPROVE NATIONAL ID SYSTEM AS PROVISION OF 
IMMIGRATION BILL -- PROVISION IS WATERED DOWN, FIGHT MOVES TO HOUSE FLOOR

On September 20, 1995 members of the U.S. House of Representatives agreed 
to create a National Identification system. By a margin of 2 votes, the 
House Judiciary Committee failed to remove a provision of the House 
Immigration bill establishing a national registry of Social Security 
Administration and Immigration and Naturalization Service data. The 
Committee instead agreed to limit the scope of the system and to require 
Congressional authorization before large scale implementation. Excerpts 
from the Committee debate and the vote breakdown are printed below.

The effort to remove the national identification system provision is being 
led by Representative Steve Chabot (R-OH). Chabot offered an amendment to 
strike Section IV of HR. 2202, the "Immigration in the National Interest 
Act" (sponsored by Rep. Lamar Smith, R-TX) which would establish a national 
computer registry by combining Social Security Administration and 
Immigration and Naturalization Service data. 

The 'Employment Eligibility Mechanism' as the provision is called in the 
legislation, would be used to monitor and track all hiring decisions made 
by employers nationwide. As a result, the ability of every American to work 
would be conditioned on the accuracy of the information in this national 
data system.

Chabot's effort to remove the Employment Eligibility Mechanism was narrowly 
defeated 15 - 17. The committee instead approved an amendment offered by 
Rep. Martin Hoke (R-OH) to limit the scope of the program and require 
additional congressional authorization before a nation-wide system could 
be created. Debate now moves to the floor of the House, where another 
attempt to remove the provision altogether is likely. 

The 'Employment Eligibility Mechanism' has been vigorously opposed by a 
large and diverse coalition, including organization such as the ACLU, 
Citizens for a Sound Economy, the Center for Democracy and Technology, 
and individuals such as William Kristol (Project for the Republican Future), 
Jeff Eisenach (Progress and Freedom Foundation), and Jack Kemp 
(Empower America), among others (for more information, see CDT Policy 
Post No.15 URL:http://www.cdt.org/publications/pp150531.html).

Representative Chabot's amendment to remove the Employment Eligibility 
Mechanism provision had broad bi-partisan support and the support of civil 
liberties advocates, ethnic organizations, business leaders, and labor and 
religious organizations. Chabot, who referred to the Employment Eligibility 
Mechanism as "1-800-BIG-BROTHER, deserves credit for bringing this issue to 
the forefront of the debate. Chabot has indicated that he will continue to 
press for the removal of the provision as the bill moves to the House Floor.

Although the Committee did not remove the Employment Eligibility Mechanism 
provision, Rep. Hoke (R-OH) offered an amendment to limit the Employment 
Eligibility Mechanism to a pilot program which would be conducted in at 
least 5 of the 7 states with the largest number of unauthorized workers.   
Under the Hoke amendment, the pilot projects sunset on October 1, 1991, and 
the system may not be established in non pilot states without additional 
action by Congress.  In addition, Rep. Becerra (D-CA) added language 
directing the Attorney General to include an analysis of the system's: 
1) ease and reliability; 2) impact on job loss due to inaccurate or 
unavailable data; 3) effect on discrimination; 4) impact on privacy; 
and , 5) cost and administration to employers.  Both the Becerra and Hoke 
amendments were approved by a voice vote.

CDT is pleased that the Committee moved to limit the scope of the Employment 
Eligibility Mechanism and that Congressional approval would be required to 
expand the program. However, CDT remains vigorously opposed to government 
efforts to establish large scale national computer registries to track and 
verify personal information about US Citizens. Such proposals clearly violate 
the privacy rights of Americans, and create the potential for large scale 
surveillance by law enforcement agencies and discrimination by employers. 
CDT will closely monitor the progress of this issue and will update you on 
its progress as the House moves forward.

(3) Excerpts from Rep. Chabot's (R-OH) statement in favor of his amendment:

The system has been referred to as dialing 1-800-BIG-BROTHER.  It will be 
costly to operate; it won't work; and it will send exactly the wrong message 
as to whether the government is to be the master or the servant of the people.  
Our focus should be on illegal immigrants and the people who smuggle them in, 
not on innocent, law abiding American citizens.

Now, some people argue that we should oppose this system because it will lead 
inevitably to a national ID card. . . But I believe that this system is 
tremendously misguided even if one does not believe that it will evolve 
into a national ID.  We should stop this habit of turning to the private 
sector and forcing small business to act more and more as an arm of the 
federal government.  And we should get the federal government out of the 
face of innocent citizens.

Would this 1-800 number system even work?  I suppose that depends in part on 
your assumptions about whether those bad employers who now rely on undocumented 
labor would even call the number in the first place.  And it depends, of course, 
on your assumptions about the infallibility of government data and government 
employees.  Is everyone's name in the system now?  No.  Would every keystroke 
entered into the computer be perfectly executed?  Perhaps, but an error rate of 
only one percent would at the very least cause great heartache for about 650,000 
Americans each year.  And while we may believe that government is perfect 
(I confess I don't), would the employer always record the correct verification 
number? Personally, I worry about getting those verification numbers wrong every 
time I order some ticket by telephone. 

                              *    *     *

Would government be able to resist the temptation gradually to expand the 
uses of this new system once the set-up costs have been incurred?  Will we 
use it to track people, or to store more and more information on them?  The 
answer again depends on your view of government, informed perhaps by your 
view as to whether use of the social security numbers has up to now been 
limited to their initial function.

But let's just consider the system at hand.  I just don't think I was sent 
here to establish this sort of bureaucracy.  And I'm not surprised that the 
spectrum of people opposing these provisions is extremely broad and 
encompasses folks who are all over the lot on other immigration issues. 

My amendment will strengthen the bill, Mr. Chairman, for I do not believe 
that this legislation will be able to carry the weight of 1-800-BIG-BROTHER 
when it comes to the floor.  I urge adoption of the amendment.
