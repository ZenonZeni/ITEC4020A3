<tr><td> Women's Coalition Against Family Violence </td></tr>
<tr><td> The Federation Press, 1994, ISBN 0646179241</td></tr>
<tr><td> This book brings together the untold stories of a number of murdered women and children, as told by their family and friends. The accounts highlight the extent of institutional and community inaction towards, and complicity in, domestic violence. They make it clear that the killings were not inexplicable or aberrant occurrences, rather they were the final act of violence after a history of violent control and abuse of power over their wives, girlfriends, ex partners and children. This book challenges your preconceived ideas about domestic violence and domestic homicide.</td></tr>
