<B>Amnesty International Irish Section will soon be hosting an on-line Urgent Action Network (UAN) on
its Web site. This will be open to all who are interested in participating in it (you do not have
to be a member of Amnesty International). Please read on if you would like to find out more...</B>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><B>What is an Urgent Action?</B></FONT> An Urgent Action (UA) is an
appeal by Amnesty International (AI) for its members and friends to urgently write letters on behalf
of an individual or individuals whose case has been adopted by AI. These cases invariably involve
a danger of torture or death occurring to the individual(s) concerned.

<P><FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><B>But what does writing letters achieve?</B></FONT> Those who torture
or perform extrajudicial executions rely on secrecy to be able to do so. When letters start
arriving from human rights activists around the world this element of secrecy is lost - they are
aware that the world is watching them. Murder and torture are illegal acts in all countries, no
matter how poor their human rights records. 

<P><FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><B>So how do I get involved in the UAN?</B></FONT> You will need to
register yourself as a participant (a contact address will be posted here early in January 1997).
This is important, as we need to be able to monitor the activity of the UAN - we are talking
about people's lives here! You can select the geographical areas which you are particularly
interested in, and the frequency with which you wish to write appeals (usually one per week to
one per month).
<P><B>AI Members:</B> If you are a member of an AI Section other than the Irish Section you should
contact your Section's UAN Coordinator for approval before becoming involved in the On-Line UAN.
<P><B>NOTE:</B> UAN members should not become involved in UAs within their country of
citizenship or residence.

<P><FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><B>How do I find out about current UAs?</B></FONT> We will be placing
UAs on Web pages on our site and also in a Usenet newsgroup. The UA case information will be
available to all, but the contact addresses (to write appeals to) will only be available to
members of the UAN. We will also post news updates on past UAs, so that you can see how
effective your efforts have been.
