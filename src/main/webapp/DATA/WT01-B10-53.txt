<h1 align=center>My IVF Experience</h1><hr>
Well, you have taken the biggest step.  You have decided to conquer your infertility.  You have come to the right place.<p><p>
The following pages are written to help you understand exactly what will happen during your in vitro cycle. <p><p>
 <p>
Please remember,<i> everyone experiences their cycle differently</i>.  What I am about to describe is a general outline.  If your experience differs from what is described, don't worry - everyone is different!<p>
You will spend a lot of time in the waiting room with a lot of other women going through the same thing.  I am sure, in no time, conversation will arise.  We call this waiting room gossip. If your experience differs form what you hear in the waiting room, please <i>don't panic</i>.  I can't stress enough - <i>EVERYONE IS DIFFERENT!</i>  Of course if you are truly worried, ask a nurse or doctor, not a friend.  All procedures and timing are done for a reason.  This is not to say you shouldn't keep abreast of your dosage and treatment;  just keep in mind everyone responds differently.<p>
The purpose of this reading is to hopefully answer questions that may come up.  If you have other questions, feel free to ask the appropriate staff member.  They will be happy to help.<p>
Your cycle begins with day 1, being the first day of your period of the month prior to your planned IVF.  On this day, you are to call the office and let them know you are ready to begin. In doing this, you allow the doctors to acquaint themselves with your history.<p>

Most women will begin Lupron shots three weeks into the cycle.  Lupron is usually given in your belly or thigh.  I know it sounds horrible, however, it is probably the least of your worries.  You won't feel a thing. <p>
After about ten days, you will be asked to come in for blood tests and an ultrasound examination to see if you are ready to begin. 

In most cases, you will have one tube of blood drawn.  I have found that keeping pressure on the area where the blood was drawn from, and holding your arm in a bent position with your elbow elevated alleviates the black and blues.<p>

Pergonal (HMG) and Metrodin (FSH) are administered in one shot in your upper buttocks are intramuscularly. This shot is no big deal.  Honestly, you will become immune.  Many of us give ourselves shots and, in many cases, husbands are giving the shots.  If you are interested in learning  how, tell one of the nurses and she will be happy to instruct your husband.  <p>

Basically, your first several days will require morning shots, and afternoon shots.  Once you have received your morning injection, you can go about your day.  The office lab and ultrasound usually opens around 7:30 AM and so does the office.  Please have your blood work done by 9:00 AM.  This way, the doctors can have your results back in time to analyze them and decide on your medication for that afternoon.  If you are having your afternoon injection administered by an IVF nurse, they like for you to return by 2:30 PM.  If you will be doing it yourself, you need to call by 2:30 PM to find out your dosage.  They like for you to get your injections around the same time every day.  Don't panic is you are off by a few hours.<p>

You are probably wondering what types of side effects you may encounter from these drugs.  Well, remember everyone is different.  Many people have complained of headaches, drowsiness and short term weight gain.  <p>

If your headache is persistent, you are allowed to take Tylenol and only Tylenol.  Evidently, this has proven not to affect the other drugs.<p>

Drowsiness, well, if possible try to take an afternoon nap.  Remember, you are probably up and out much earlier than you are accustomed.<p>

Weight gain, unfortunately this just kinda happens.  Again, everyone is different.  If you happen to be one of the ones it happens to, don't fret, you can lose it.  Anyway, who cares, especially if you get a baby out of it.  <p>

Your response to the drugs determine when you will start ultrasounds.  The nurse will tell you when you call or come in for your afternoon shot, whether you need an ultrasound the next morning.<p>

For the doctors to see your follicles on an ultrasound machine, which is done transvaginally. You do not need a full bladder.<p>


On the screen, the doctor will locate your ovaries.  In your ovaries, he is looking for follicles.  Follicles house the eggs.  There is no way to determine the status of the eggs until after retrieval.  All they can do at this point is see follicles.  They will measure the follicles on the screen.  This will be done daily until they reach a certain size.  When they are big enough and your estrogen levels are high enough, retrieval will be scheduled.<p>

Before you are actually scheduled for surgery, a decision needs to be made.  Should you have intravenous sedation or an epidural block?  <p>

When the doctors seem satisfied that you are ready for retrieval, they will schedule for your HCG shot.  Timing is essential.  The doctors want to retrieve your eggs just before they release on their own (Ovulation).<p>

This HCG shot will be scheduled based on the time you are scheduled for surgery.  You will need your HCG shot 37 hours prior to surgery.  This could end up being at midnight.<p>

On the morning of your retrieval, you don;t get to have breakfast.  You will be asked to arrive approximately 1 hour prior to retrieval unless additional sperm processing will be required.<p>
A Unit nurse will come down and talk to you and tell you what to expect.  You will be asked to change into a hospital gown. You will be asked to empty your bladder and proceed to the room for retrieval. You may not recognize you doctor because he is in scrubs from head to toe.  At this point, climb up onto the table and the rest is history.  I can't describe to you what happens next, because I don't remember too much. The IV sedation made me pretty drowsy.  I remember hearing the doctor report when an egg was retrieved.  But, I lost count. I was surprised that it didn't really hurt as much as I expected.<p>

What I can tell you is that the follicles are aspirated and, if there are eggs present, they are removed and are immediately put into incubation.<p>

While you are in the recovery room, your husband will be asked to provide a specimen.  This specimen will be washed and the good sperm will be united with your good eggs for hopefully fertilization.<p>

Don't be alarmed if your husband is asked to return the next day to provide another specimen.  In many cases, your eggs could be immature at the time they were retrieved.  Overnight they can mature and a fresh sample is needed for fertilization.<p>

You will be instructed to start taking progesterone shots.  This is done to help your uterus house the baby should you become pregnant.  You will be given the choice of taking progesterone shots or suppositories - the choice is yours.  <p>

Two or three days after retrieval, you will return to the office for embryo transfer. <p>

At this time, he will tell you how many embryos he is transferring.  It's pretty much like a pap smear. First, a speculum is inserted then a catheter with a syringe on the end.  Seconds later, the syringe is emptied into the catheter.  You may feel slight cramping but nothing serious.  Then you may be asked to lie on your belly for about an hour before going home.<p>

Don't worry, the eggs will not expel themselves.  You can then eat lunch and stay in bed for a few more hours once you get home. Take it easy when you go home.<p>

About 12 days after the retrieval, you will be given a pregnancy test.  You may be surprised, but as early as 10-12 days blood samples will show if you are pregnant.  Your HCG needs to be over 5 to be pregnant, although over 20 is a more stable pregnancy result.  All your levels should be higher than usual.<p>

Probably one of the most important points to convey in this reading is that should you become pregnant, of course be happy.  However, it is essential that you put it in prospective and realize that it is very early in the pregnancy and the next few weeks are crucial.<p>

For all of us, hearing that we are pregnant will be the most wonderful news.  Remember, as easily as they told you that you are pregnant, it can be as easy to tell you that you aren't any more.  This is not intended to scare you, but merely to help you understand the waiting is not yet over - it has just begun.<p>

A  note of advice is to keep the happy news between yourself and your very immediate family.  This will save you numerous phone calls should you miscarry, thus allowing you to get over the pain and get psyched to start in vitro again.<p>

Be prepared to stay with the program.  It works.  Believe me, if there is no chance for you, The doctors will not let you go through it.<p>

For those of you who do not get pregnant - hang in there.  It will happen.  Remember, your mind can work against you.  <b>Think POSITIVE!</b>  For those of you who get pregnant, spread the word of this miracle.<p>
To all - <b>GOOD LUCK!</b><p>
