Picking Stocks: Techniques That Stand the Test of Time </H2><P>
<HR>

Research on stock selection often seems contradictory. Yet, study after study has found that certain factors do have long-term significance.<p>


Which techniques and overall investment approaches seem to have withstood the test of time? Here's a short survey of those that appear to work over long time periods:<p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Seeking Firms That Sell At A Low Market-Price-To-Book-Value Ratio: </strong>This is one technique that continuously turns up in studies as being successful. However, there are some interpretation problems. A price-to-book-value screen will tend to turn up stocks that are concentrated in a few industries that traditionally sell at low price-to-book-value ratios (price per share divided by assets less liabilities on a per share basis), as well as many "troubled firms" that require unique analysis. The low price-to-book-value screen may simply be a proxy for neglected or out-of-favor firms and industries--firms that may have been driven below their real value by overreaction to negative news. However, screening for firms with a price-to-book-value ratio that is low relative to an industry average, and for firms with a price-to-book-value ratio below 1.00, a very select group, still appears to be a productive investment approach. <p>


<li><strong>Seeking Firms That Sell At A Low Price-To-Earnings Ratio: </strong>This is another long-time classic, although with similar interpretation problems. In most research, firms with the lowest price-earnings ratios (price per share divided by earnings per share) using trailing earnings--earnings for the most recent four quarters--produce the highest returns before and after adjusting for risk. The price-to-book-value ratio approach, however, in recent research seems to capture the same kinds of firms as the low-price-earnings-ratio screen, while at the same time producing better results.<p>


<li><strong>Concentrating On Stocks With Low Market Capitalization--Price Per Share Times Number Of Shares Outstanding: </strong>
Countless studies have indicated that small capitalization stocks have provided above-market returns even after adjusting for risk. Why? Probably due to neglect--with less media exposure, less institutional ownership and less analyst scrutiny, investors have more chance to uncover bargains. Interestingly, most of the above-average returns have tended to come in January and, more recently, starting in mid-December; the studies, however, have failed to come up with a convincing explanation for this calendar effect. What constitutes "small"? Definitions have varied, but the original studies concentrated on firms of around $100 million or less. On the other hand, some recent research suggests that differences in capitalization are not as important when the data is adjusted for differences in price-to-book-value ratio.<p>


<li><strong>Seeking Stocks That Have Recently Seen Upward Revisions In Analysts' Earnings Forecasts: </strong>The larger the upward revision in a consensus earnings forecast (the average of estimates by financial analysts), the greater the near-term returns, according to some studies. While the price reaction is not an unexpected result, the fact that above-market risk-adjusted returns tend to persist well after the revision is more surprising. Analysts are always changing forecasts as new information is available and expectations change, but it is easier to monitor earnings forecast revisions than the variable set followed by analysts. <p>


<li><strong>Seeking Stocks With Large Earnings Surprises: </strong>Positive or negative earnings surprises--when announced earnings vary from earnings consensus estimates--cause reactions in price on the days prior to the announcement and on the earnings announcement date. Apparently, leaks abound when the news is exceptionally good or bad. The real surprise is that the stock price adjustment process continues for quite some time, perhaps a year for a serious surprise. And the price adjustment is greater for negative surprises than for positive surprises. Also, it is not too late to buy after the announcement of a large positive earnings surprise, but buying right after the announcement of a large negative earnings surprise is a bit premature; shorting the stock (borrowing the shares to sell them) would still have merit at that point.<p>


<li><strong>Buying An Initial Public Offering At The Offer Price: </strong>Studies indicate that buying an IPO at the offering price produces above-market risk-adjusted returns, while buying a new offering after it begins trading in the market is more likely to produce negative returns. Unfortunately, these findings are more useful for institutional investors than for individual investors, since most IPOs are offered first to a dealer's largest clients, who quickly snap up the best offers, leaving behind those that are less desirable. If you can get a new offering at the offering price, you probably shouldn't buy it; if you can't get it at the offer price, wait a year or so before you buy it in the secondary market if it still has any appeal.<p>


<li><strong>Buying Stocks Using A Value Approach: </strong>While value investors are not all alike in their selection of measures of value, their emphasis is consistent. They do not want to pay much for historical values such as earnings, dividends, or assets. Using the value approach usually creates lower risk portfolios that tend to shine in uncertain and down markets. <p>


The tools of the value approach are familiar--low price to earnings, low price to book value, low price to cash flow per share, above average dividend yield, low debt to equity, and high return on equity. The trick is to adjust these measures for unique firm and standard industry conditions to avoid false readings.<p>


Value investing as an approach has had consistent long-term success over widely varying economic and market environments, but tends to fall behind other approaches on occasion, particularly in the strongest portion of a bull market.<p>


<li><strong>Investing In Stocks With Price Momentum: </strong>The key to momentum investing is to buy price movement--If the stock's price is moving significantly upward, jump on and ride it until the road starts to flatten out and be quick to jump off when momentum falters.<p>


Momentum investing at its purest is simply a technical approach that relies on measures such as relative strength and moving averages. Relative strength is the price of an individual stock relative to some index base of the overall market; the more positive the relative strength trend, the more attractive the stock. Moving averages relate a stock's current price to its average price over some period; stocks with current prices moving above their moving average in an upward trend are attractive on a momentum basis. <p>


While much research indicates that technical indicators fail to provide above-market returns after transaction costs, certain momentum measures have occasionally been shown to work. However, these studies also indicate that short-term trading is required to succeed.<p>
</ul>

The common themes that research studies have repeatedly uncovered:<p>

<ul>
<li>Markets tend to overreact to news. Good news--news better than expected--draws and holds market attention; bad news--news worse than expected--is not soon forgotten.<p>


<li>Markets consistently ignore or neglect small stocks, creating the potential for excess returns.<p>


<li>Value investing is contrarian in nature, and is advantageous when markets overreact to events or choose to ignore worthwhile investment opportunities.<p>
</ul>

Thus, beyond understanding the mechanics and terms of investing, simply getting a feel for how markets tend to react or overreact to new information and situations is invaluable.<p>
