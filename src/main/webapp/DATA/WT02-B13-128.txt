<a name="RTFToC2">Immigration
and Internal Migration Promote Balkanization</a></a>
</a></h2>
<p>
William Frey's analysis of 1990 census data found that especially unskilled
US-born residents moved out of the cities and states to which immigrants moved
between 1985 and 1990.  Balkanization would result if minority immigrants
continued to move into cities such as Los Angeles and states such as
California, which are increasingly being abandoned by unskilled whites.  <p>
<p>
Detailed analysis by Nancy Bolton of the UCLA-BFP forecasting group indicates
that such a balkanization process was underway in California in the early
1990s.  According to Bolton's estimates, California added 66,000 net new
residents between 1990 and 1993 but, during this period, the state gained a net
133,000 less-than-high-school-educated residents and 76,000 college-educated
residents, and lost a net 143,000 high school graduates. <p>
<p>
Freya Schultz of Santa Barbara county shows that, as labor-intensive strawberry
production increased in the county,  so did the influx of
less-than-high-school-educated migrants.  Furthermore, with increased
employment seasonality, and that many of these unauthorized workers cannot
lawfully draw unemployment insurance benefits, AFDC cases have taken on a
seasonal pattern, with unemployed workers seeking benefits for their US-born
and citizen children. <p>

<a name="RTFToC4">Economic
Uncertainty Motivates Rethinking Immigration Policy</a></a>
</a></h2>
<p>
Demetrios Papademetriou, who has replaced Doris Meissner as head of the
Carnegie Endowment's Immigration Policy Program, believes that the US "appears
to be on the verge of a fundamental reexamination of its views on immigration"
that is "potentially fateful"  because the US is in a period of "pervasive
economic uncertainty."   This uncertainty, in turn, derives from layoffs in
"recession-proof" industries such as financial services and defense, especially
in California.  Papademetriou says that anti-immigrant politicians have been
able to exploit the "social tensions" that always accompany immigration, and
that "no politician has felt compelled to actively resist this anti-immigration
tide."<p>
<p>
According to Papademetriou:  "immigrants are successfully absorbed into the US
labor market."...the overall economic contributions of immigration exceed its
economic liabilities" and "immigration clearly improves the US' ability to
compete "in the global economy.  Furthermore, the formation of ethnic
communities is thought to spawn and strengthen international links that
facilitate the exchange of goods and capital."  Papademetriou allows that "the
picture is not uniformly positive," since immigrant workers may act as an
economic-distorting subsidy in some industries.  <p>
<p>
According to Papademetriou, legal and illegal immigrants have similar
experiences in US labor markets, and the overall impacts of immigrant workers
on US workers is small.  Papademetriou says that immigration is interwoven with
decline in agriculture, garments, and shoes, so that it is not possible to say
whether immigration contributed to falling wages and conditions in these
industries, or whether falling wages etc. caused by other factors led Americans
to abandon these jobs, creating an opening for immigrants.   <p>
<p>
Papademetriou argues that immigration creates government jobs for US workers
(to provide the immigrants with government services), jobs for similar
immigrants in ethnic enclaves, and an overall increase in jobs to provide the
housing and other services immigrants consume.  Papademetriou contrasts the
generally positive conclusions about the effects of immigrants on the
macroeconomy with the negative conclusions of case studies, but concludes that
his "synthesis is even more tentative that the body of literature on which it
is based."   <p>
<p>
Papademetriou predicts that "an all-out fight centering on the costs and
benefits of immigration" will really be a proxy for larger issues facing the
US.  He warns that the fight will be based on  inadequate data, although he
predicts that those who emphasize the costs of immigration will win the
headlines.  Second, Papademetriou expects the coming fight over immigration to
end the US "age of innocence" with immigration, which presumably means the end
of an era in which the US simply assumed that immigration was on balance mostly
beneficial to the country.<p>

Issues New Visa Requirements for Skilled Foreign Workers</a></a>

<p>
The Immigration and Naturalization Service is making final a regulation easing
new requirements imposed by the 1990 Immigration Act on employers wishing to
obtain temporary employment visas for highly skilled  foreign workers.  The
rule changes a provision in the 1990 IMMACT requiring prospective employers to

Work in Neighboring Costa Rica</a></a>

<p>
Costa Rican border officials permit Nicaraguan farm hands to cross the frontier
to overcome seasonal shortages of sugar and coffee harvesters.  Some 7,000
workers migrate into Costa Rica for the sugar harvest, usually for the months
of December and January.  Unemployment in Nicaragua affects almost 50 percent
of the population, versus 5.5 percent in Costa Rica.  <p>
<p>
Migrant workers save about $22 monthly, not much higher than what they could
earn in Nicaragua.  Costa Rican officials say those who are hired directly by
farms get better deals and can earn up to $500 monthly.  The procedure for
hiring migrant workers is monitored by Costa Rica's labor ministry, which
usually transports the workers or supervises their trip to the farms.  The
biggest problems are with workers who seek jobs in the thriving banana
industry; most work without contracts, and many are poorly treated. <p>

<a name="RTFToC8">New
EU Immigration Rights Proposed</a></a>
</a></h2>
<p>
According to many observers, " Immigration is the largest and most contentious
problem facing the European Union."  The EU is preparing to issue a charter of
rights for the 9 million citizens of non-EU nations who are living legally in
an EU nation, such as Turks established in Germany.  Under the proposed
charter, these third country nationals could work anywhere in the 12 nation EU,
and the EU would take steps to better integrate them with enhanced training
opportunities and guarantees of equal rights. <p>
<p>
The proposals are contained in a document from Padraig Flynn, a former Irish
Justice Minister and Commissioner for Social Policy and Immigration.  According
to Flynn, "'immigration to Europe has been a positive development with
substantial economic and social benefits.''  Flynn's proposals are the first
indication of how the Maastricht treaty may allow the European Union to spread
its influence into areas previously reserved for national governments. <p>
<p>
The Commissioner's  recommendations are based on three themes.  First, the
European Union should help to create new rights for legally resident
immigrants.  Second, immigrants should be encouraged to integrate rather than
to retain their original citizenship.  Third, there should be a way for EU
nations to  burden share in immigration issues. The document also recommends
tougher measures against illegal immigrants.<p>

<a name="RTFToC9">Workers
from CIS Flood Russia; New Controls Announced</a></a>
</a></h2>
<p>
Hundreds of thousands Ukrainians and Belarusans are migrating to Russia,
attracted by a stable currency and jobs local workers shun. <p>
<p>
The official unemployment rate in Russia is one percent, and most observers
believe that the true rate is less than 5 percent.  However, inadequate housing
market and government residency regulations keep unemployed or underemployed
Russians from moving to labor shortage areas, such as Moscow, leaving vacancies
in some of Russia's least desirable jobs that can be filled by migrant workers.
<p>
<p>
At least 300,000 migrant workers, mostly from Ukraine and Belarus, have
contracts that let them work legally in Russia.  The total number of migrants
is estimated to be half a million or more.<p>
<p>
Concern about foreign workers led Boris Yeltsin in December 1993 to issue two
decrees: "On Measures to Introduce Immigration Control" and "On the Hiring and
Use of Foreign Labor in the Russian Federation".  <p>
<p>
The first establishes the Russian Federation Federal Migration Service  to
regulate the employment of foreign workers.  Russian employers who want to
employ foreign workers must to request a work permit  and to include the
opinion of local authorities, a draft contract that specifies the wages and
working conditions being offered, and assurances that the employment of foreign
workers will not have an "unfavorable impact on the employment conditions for
Russian citizens."<p>
<p>
The second document gives Russian citizens priority to fill vacant job
positions.  Employers wishing to hire foreign workers must pay a fee equivalent
to one month's minimum wage for each  foreign worker  hired.  Foreigners who
come to Russia to engage in professional activities and are hired in violation
of the Statute on Hiring Foreign Labor in the Russian Federation will be
subject to deportation at the employer's expense.  If employers hire foreign
workers without the appropriate permits, they can be liable for additional
penalties not yet specified.<p>

A "birth dearth" in Europe resulted in the use of  guestworkers instead of
allowing wages and markets to adjust to slower workforce growth.  Nearly 20
percent of the EU population is over 60  By 2010, there will be more EU
residents drawing unemployment that contributing toward them with current early

should have "zero migration and promised to start sending planeloads of illegal
immigrants home "until the world got the message''  now says that up to 100,000
foreign workers a year will be needed to fill vacant jobs for which French
workers are either unqualified or unwilling to fill.  German politicians also
now acknowledge that non-German contributions to pension and welfare programs
are necessary.  A spokesman for the Social Democrats reports that the two
million foreigner workers in Germany contribute 10 percent of the national
output, and pay an even greater proportion of taxes and pension fund
contributions.<p>

Reports on Foreign Workers</a></a>
</a></h2>
<p>
In the first three quarters of 1993, Poland issued 7,889 work permits to
foreign workers , according to the  Central Statistical Office (GUS).  Foreign
workers came to Poland from 104 countries, but one-third were Ukrainians (16.1
percent) and Russians (13.1).  Other nationalities included Vietnamese (7.6),
Americans(4.8) and British workers(3.6 percent).  Foreigners are most often
employed in construction, trade, the catering business, transportation and
communications, culture and arts, and non-conventional medicine.  Ukrainians,
Belarusans, Russians and Chinese are most often employed in construction,
Vietnamese dominate in commerce and catering, while U.S. and British citizens
work mainly in education.  Non-conventional medicine is a domain of Russians
and Mongols.<p>
<p>
The largest group of  foreign workers  fall in the blue-collar category (27.1
percent).  Managers of companies with mixed and foreign capital received 21.8
percent of the permits.  Those employed as specialists, experts and advisors
were 15.4 percent of the total.<p>
<p>
The State Labor Inspectorate (PIP) estimates that about 20 percent of the Poles
employed in the private sector, over 1.2 million people, work illegally,
usually by being registered as unemployed and drawing unemployment benefits
while also working.  The PIP estimates that several thousand Belarusans,
Lithuanians, Russians and Ukrainians work illegally in Poland.  Most often they
find seasonal jobs in agriculture and construction.<p>

<a name="RTFToC18">Rise
of Foreign Workers in Malaysia</a></a>
</a></h2>
<p>
In January, 1994, Malaysia  launched a crackdown against the  foreigners who
are working illegally in the country.  The federal government issued a
directive, freezing work permits for foreign workers.  In late January, the
Malaysian government announced that it was considering caning, or the flogging
of the buttocks with a thick cane, to discourage illegal workers from entering
its borders. <p>
<p>
Employers in the construction and plantation industries have expressed concern
that any wide-ranging moves against  foreign workers  would lead to serious
production shortfalls.  On some plantations up to 80 per cent of workers are
foreigners, most of them Indonesian or Bangladeshi.<p>
<p>
Malaysia has gone from a country with double digit unemployment to full
employment in less than ten years.  The unemployment rate for 1993 was 3 per
cent.  Wage increases also rose with productivity.  As a result,  all major
sectors of the economy are experiencing labor shortages.  Foreign workers had
to be recruited by the government to overcome labor shortages.  In the
beginning, mostly Indonesians workers were brought in for the plantation
sector.  This was later extended to cover services and manufacturing. <p>
<p>
A U.S. Embassy report says that with a population of 19 million, Malaysia has a
labor force of seven million, including up to two million  foreign workers,
still primarily from neighboring Indonesia.  According to the report, about one
million of them are illegal.  Government estimates are somewhat lower, one
million foreign workers with 200,000-250,000 illegal immigrants. <p>
<p>
Malaysian government officials say that illegal immigrants had committed crimes
and had engaged in petty trading and hawking, activities which foreigners were
barred from doing.  The Home Minister warned that the one million foreign
workers  in Malaysia would pose a social problem if the economy were to
decline.  He added that though the freezing of worker permits make it difficult
to resolve the labor shortage, it was necessary for the country's security.<p>

<p>
Taiwan has set  strict limits on the categories and numbers of  foreign
workers.   According the chairman of the Council of Labor Affairs, the country
has adopted four guidelines for hiring blue-collar workers: 1) Foreigners
cannot take jobs which locals are willing to do.  Companies have to advertise
in three newspapers for three days, and show that response is poor before
tapping overseas labor; 2) Since wages for  foreign workers  are usually lower
than those for locals, industries may be able to postpone automation by hiring
more outsiders.  Hence, companies must submit improvement plans along with
requests for foreign workers; 3) Entrepreneurs bear the responsibility of
preventing foreigners from becoming permanent residents.  They can stay in the
country for a year, followed by one-year extension of their work permits.; and
4) Foreign workers  should not endanger Taiwan's society.  Management of their
stay in the country is mandatory.<p>
<p>
In a related move, Taiwan labor officials will include Vietnam to the list of
Southeast Asian countries from which workers are allowed to immigrate for two
years.  Taiwan, Vietnam's biggest foreign investor, will adopt an unprecedented
government-to-government labor cooperation agreement to allow 1,000 Vietnamese
nationals to work on the island<p>
