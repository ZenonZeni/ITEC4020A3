<p>MK ANNOUNCED 3RD QUARTER RESULTS
</b></center>
<P>
BOISE -- Washington Construction Group, Inc., renamed Morrison Knudsen 
Corporation following its merger with MK, announced today its third 
quarter results for the period ended August 31, 1996. Morrison Knudsen 
Corporation and Washington Construction Group, Inc. merged on
September 11, 1996 and the results announced today are for the former 
Washington Construction Group only for the quarterly period ending prior 
to the merger.  <P>
     The Company announced that the recognition of after-tax adjustments 
of $11.1 million for write-downs on certain real estate properties and 
non-core businesses held for sale have resulted in a net loss of $11.2 
million, $.38 per share, on revenue of $97.8 million for the quarter ended 
August 31, 1996 compared to net income of $3.0 million, $.10 per share, on 
revenue of $71.9 million for the third quarter of 1995. The net loss for 
the nine month period ended August 31, 1996 was $10.4 million, $.35 per 
share, on revenue of $242.4 million compared to net income of $5.2 
million, $.18 per share, on revenue of $160.3 million for the comparable 
period in 1995.  Gross profit of the former Washington Construction Group 
for the third quarter was $5.0 million, compared to $7.2 million for
the third quarter of 1995. <P>
     The Company said that it has completed a review of financial matters 
following the merger which included changing the status of certain assets 
from "held for use" in the business to "held for sale". These assets 
include a non-core business and a real estate development project. In 
assessing the carrying amount of these properties, the Company recognized 
an after-tax impairment loss totaling $7.5 million.<P>
     "Selling these non-core assets is part of our strategy to streamline 
operations and focus on our core engineering and construction operations," 
said Robert A. Tinstman, MK President and Chief Executive Officer. "The 
merger provided an opportunity to evaluate the status of these 
non-construction related assets, which were primarily real estate 
development projects. The write-downs will not have an impact on future 
results and we remain confident in the future performance of the
combined Company's operating units."<P>
     In connection with the merger, the Company plans to consolidate 
certain functions of the combined company and relocate personnel to its 
Boise headquarters. Doing so will change the manner and extent to which 
certain offices will be used in the future. In assessing the carrying 
amount of such property, the Company recognized an after-tax impairment 
loss of $3.6 million.<P>
     Operational highlights for the former Washington Construction Group 
in the third quarter include the award of a $58.7 million project in 
Fresno, California, for the California Department of Transportation. The 
project consists of the construction of 26 structures within two 
interchanges, excavation of 2.8 million cubic yards of earth and the 
pavement of approximately three miles of roadway. Work on the project 
began in mid-September and is expected to be completed during 1998.<P>
     The former Washington Construction Group's backlog of all uncompleted 
contracts on August 31, 1996 was $419 million, $135 million higher than 
its August 31, 1995 backlog (a 48% increase) and $133 million higher than 
its backlog on November 30, 1995.  <P>
     The merger of Morrison Knudsen and Washington Construction resulted 
in a company of 10,000 employees in 25 countries providing management, 
engineering and construction services to clients in seven markets: 
environmental, mining, heavy construction, industrial &amp; process, 
operations &amp; maintenance, power and transportation. <P>
<p>

<P>Morrison Knudsen Corporation (NYSE--MK), founded in 1912, serves the 
world's environmental, industrial, mining, operations & maintenance, 
power, process, transportation and heavy construction markets as an 
engineer and constructor.<p>
