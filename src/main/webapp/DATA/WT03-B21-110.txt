<h2>Conceptus Acquires Microgyn, Developer of Therapeutic Hysteroscopy Devices</h2>
<!-- textstart -->
<p>
    SAN CARLOS, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Dec. 2, 1996-- Conceptus Inc (NASDAQ:CPTS)  today announced that it has completed the acquisition 
of Microgyn, Inc., a private medical device company, for a 
combination of cash and common stock.    
<p>
           Microgyn is focused on developing products to increase the safety
and performance of resectoscope procedures, including therapeutic 
hysteroscopy.  The acquisition is to be accounted for on a purchase 
basis.  Significantly all of the $4 million fixed portion of the 
purchase price is expected to be accounted for as in-process 
research and development and expensed in the fourth quarter of 1996.
<p>
    Therapeutic hysteroscopy is one of the most rapidly growing 
procedures in gynecology to treat uterine disorders which may result 
in recurrent pregnancy loss, dysfunctional uterine bleeding, and 
pelvic pain.  This procedure can often provide a less invasive 
alternative to hysterectomy, or the removal of the uterus, which 
is an invasive surgical procedure performed approximately 600,000 
times each year in the United States.
<p>
    &quot;Microgyn's technology provides Conceptus another platform from 
which to broaden our product portfolio for the interventional 
gynecologist,&quot; commented Kathryn Tunstall, President and CEO of 
Conceptus.  &quot;Significantly, Microgyn's hysteroscopy-based products 
are highly complementary to our core catheter technologies, 
providing what we believe will be improved clinical solutions which 
are less invasive and more cost effective.&quot;  
<p>
           Conceptus's Transcervical Tubal Access Catheter (T-TAC) system, 
consisting of proprietary microcatheters and guidewires, enables more
direct and accurate diagnosis of diseases of the uterus and fallopian
tubes.  T-TAC also forms the basis for the company's Transcervical 
Falloposcopy system (incorporating specialized fallopian tube 
microendoscopy products) and the S/TOP (Selective Tubal Occlusion 
Procedure) System for nonsurgical female sterilization.  
<p>
    &quot;We share Conceptus's vision of creating a company dedicated to 
developing innovative clinically valuable products for the diagnosis 
and treatment of the gynecologic patient,&quot; stated Keith Isaacson, 
M.D., co-founder of Microgyn and a recognized expert in 
hysteroscopy.  &quot;We are pleased to be part of a broad effort to 
transform the practice of interventional gynecology, a previously 
underserved area of medicine, though the creation of new 
technologies specific to gynecologic applications.&quot;
<p>
    Microgyn's lead product, the continuous-flow Isotonic Solution 
System (CISS), is designed to permit the use of isotonic, or 
physiologic, fluids during hysteroscopic procedures.  Today, these 
procedures require the use of hypotonic fluids, the absorption of 
which can lead to a number of clinical complications, including 
death.  Microgyn filed a 510(k) application for the system in June 
1996.  The CISS is compatible with the large installed base of 
existing hysteroscope systems and electrosurgical generators.  
Microgyn is also developing other related products that are intended 
to further improve the performance of hysteroscopy.
<p>
    Conceptus, Inc. designs, develops and markets innovative, 
minimally invasive medical devices for the interventional gynecology 
market.  The company's initial focus is on the development of 
systems to improve the diagnosis and treatment of uterine and 
fallopian tube diseases and disorders.  The Company is also 
developing a nonsurgical approach to fallopian tube sterilization, 
the most commonly performed contraceptive procedure worldwide.
<p>
    Except for the historical information contained herein, the 
matters discussed in this press release are forward-looking 
statements, the accuracy of which is necessarily subject to risks 
and uncertainties.  The clinical efficacy of and market demand for 
products and receipt of regulatory approvals among other matters 
discussed in this release, may differ significantly from the
discussion of such matters in the forward-looking statements.  
Actual results may be affected by, among other things, risk and 
uncertainties related to new product development and introduction 
cycles, research and development activities, delays by regulatory 
authorities, scientific advances by Conceptus or third parties, 
introduction of competitive products, third party reimbursement and 
physician training, as well as those factors set forth in the 
Company's prospectus, dated February 1, 1996.
