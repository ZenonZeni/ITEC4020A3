<center><h1><i>How to Apply</i></h1></center>
<p>
<p>
Check the benefits available with each Plan. Select the most suitable Plan for your needs. Remember if applying on behalf of your family that each individual member can select a different plan.
<p>
As a guide to the benefit schedule the plans available are listed on the page headed 
'The MEDICUS Range of Plans', which should be read carefully before making your choice.
<p>
Check the Premium Schedule for the rate appropriate to your age. You will note that there are two Premium Schedules for each Plan. The first is headed 'Rates for Individuals' and the second 'Membership Rates'. Rates for Individuals indicate the monthly premium for the plan you select. Membership Rates enable you to reduce the overall cost of your plan, however, to qualify for the membership rates you must pay an annual membership premium in the first month of each year as indicated on the rate chart, followed by reduced monthly premiums. This annual premium will automatically be deducted by Direct Debit in the first month of every year of your plan. If you prefer, in the initial year of joining, payment of the membership premium may be made by cheque payable to Medicus Family Care Ltd. Membership reduces the overall cost of insurance over the course of twelve months 
<b>BUT IS NOT REFUNDABLE.</b>
<p>
The CHILD CARE plan, available for parents wishing to cover only their children, has just two rates: £20.50 per month for the first child and £10.25 per month for the second and any subsequent children.
<p>
Add together the monthly premiums selected for each member of your family to determine your total monthly premium. Remember that the direct debit deductions in the first month of each full year of cover will include the annual premium for membership if this option is chosen.<i> (Annual membership premiums may be paid by cheque in the first year).</i>
