<P>Many people who are over weight do not understand the reason why. 
They often feel that they do not eat that much. They think it has 
something to do with their metabolism. Physicians generally do not 
agree with this. We usually measure the levels of thyroid hormone and if
they are normal we say that metabolism is not the reason for the 
obesity. New information indicates that there may indeed be a 
metabolic cause for obesity and it is not related to the thyroid 
hormones. The key hormones are insulin and glucagon. These then are 
a major factor in the regulation of hundreds of other little-known, 
difficult to measure hormones.
<P>&nbsp;
<P>There is an optimal balance of these many hormones that leads to 
optimal health and optimal weight. The key is the insulin and glucagon 
balance. Too much insulin in the blood leads to suboptimal hormone 
balance in general. Insulin levels in the blood are controlled by what you
eat. Primarily the relative amount of protein to carbohydrate in your 
diet. Studies have shown that the ideal ratio is 3 grams of protein to 4
grams of carbohydrtate in every meal. The food you eat can be thought 
of as a powerful drug. We know that drugs must be taken at prescribed 
intervals and in prescribed dosages. The new technology suggests that 
food be used the same way. To reach a state of optimal health you must 
eat food in a controlled fashion and in the proper proportions. Losing 
weight does not require will power, it does require information. If you 
control what you eat you do not have to be overly concerned with how 
much you eat.
<P>&nbsp;
<P>You must think of food not as a solurce of calories but as a control 
system for hormones. If you eat the right combination of foods, you tap 
into a hugh source of energy, your own stored body fat. With the wrong
combination the fat stores are inaccessible for use as energy for the next
4-6 hours.
<P>&nbsp;
<P>Exercise is also a modulator of hormones. The higher the intensity of
exercise, the more hormonal responses are affected. Higher intensity 
aerobic esercise reduces insulin levels, and increases levels of glucagon.
The intensity of exercise that induces an improved balance of hormones 
is between 60 and 80 percent of maximum heart rate. Jogging, 
swimming, or running can generate this level of intensity. Anaerobic 
esercise is also benificial. If the intensity is great enough, it causes
the 
body to release human growth hormone. Human growth hormone is the 
most powerful gat burning hormone in the body. It burns fat, and it 
allows you to build new muscle at the same time. Growth hormone is 
also released during sleep; during stage 3 and 4 sleep just prior to 
REM. Insulin is a powerful inhibitor of human growth hormone.
<P>&nbsp;
<P>Obesity is not weight gain, it is the accumulation of excess body fat.
Ideally a male should have about 15% body fat and a female should 
have 22% body fat.
<P>&nbsp;
<P>The liver can store only 60-90 grams of carbohydrate as glycogen. This
is the only reserve source of glucose for the brain from carbohydrate. 
The brain uses 2/3 of the circulating carbohydrats that you use at rest.
The muscles can store 300-400 grams of carbohydrate, but this is not 
available to the brain. Once the storage areas in the liver and muscle are
full, the rest of the carbohydrates you eat end up as fat. Insulin 
stimulated by excess carbohydrates aggressively promotes the 
accumulation of body fat. Excess carbohydrates in your diet not only 
make you fat, they make sure you stay fat.
<P>&nbsp;
<P>Glucose is found in grains, pastas, bread, cereals, starches, and 
vegetables. Fructose is primarily found in fruits. Galactose is found in
dairy products. Galactose and fructose must be converted to glucose 
before releasing back to the blood. The higher the fiber content of a
carbohydrate, the slower the rate of entry into the blood stream.
<P>&nbsp;
<P>It is genetically impossible to lose more than 1 to 1.5 pounds per week
of body fat. You can lose more weight, but it will be primarily water 
loss and muscle mass loss. People on quick weight loss programs look 
haggard because they are losing muscle mass.
<P>&nbsp;
<P>Twenty five percent of people have blunted insulin responses. They can
eat more carbohydrates and not get fat. Twenty five percent have 
extremely elevated insulin responses to carbohydrates. They simply 
have to look at carbohydrates to begin gaining fat.
<P>&nbsp;
<P>The symptoms of protein malnutrition include a weakned immune 
system, loss of muscle mass, and hair loss. The amount of protein you 
need depends on three factors: weight, percent body fat, and level of 
activity. Spread your protein intake evenly throughout the day.
<P>&nbsp;
<P>Restrict bad fats; which are arachidonic acid and saturated fat. Get 
most or your fat from monounsaturated fat.
<P>&nbsp;
<P>Stay on the perimeter of the supermarket when you shop.
<P>&nbsp;
<P>The amount of protein that can fit on the palm of your hand is about 4
oz. or 28 grams. The size of the carbohydrate portion should be about 
twice as big as your protein portion in the amount of space it occupies 
on your plate.
<P>&nbsp;
<P>Whenever you have a problem with hunger or carbohydrate cravings, 
look to your last meal for a clue to the reason why.
<P>&nbsp;
<P>If you are fat and shaped like an apple, you are hyperinsulinemic. High
triglyceride levels are an indication of hyperinsulinemia. 
Hyperinsulinemia may be the primary risk factor for heart attacks. 
Insulin will be increased by eating too much food at any one meal or too
much carbohydrate.
<P>&nbsp;
<P>Restricted are high density, high glycemic, carbohydrates like grains,
breads, pasta, rice, and starches. Also restricted are protein sources 
rich in arachidonic acid like egg yolks, fatty red meats, and organ 
meats.
