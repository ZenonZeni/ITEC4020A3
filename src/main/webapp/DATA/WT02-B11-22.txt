The following are my personal notes based on articles, experiences and observations during
my involvement with auto  racing. Hope You Enjoy... I Welcome Your Input and Comments.......  
<br>
<p>
Tires:
<p>
Racing tires... are designed for one purpose and that is to be "used up". Getting the most out of tire in the primary
goal. All tires have an ideal operating temperature, inflation level and slip angle for optimum performance. We will
only address tire issues here so lets assume no negative chassis influences. To obtain maximum adhesion
a tire should be run at an inflation level that allows the tire to be flat to the track. Underinflation and
Overinflation can cause a concave or convex tire patch __---__ or ---__---  Temps like this: 200 215 200
show an Overinflated tire. Underinflation looks like this: 225 200 225 .  Notice how the entire temp of
the underinflated tire increases. Understand that a tire has both internal and external friction causing
heat [one other source is brakes we'll talk bout that later]. Reducing air pressure increases internal friction raising temperature and of course the opposite is true.
Always mount tires with the arrow in the proper direction, internal construction of bias tires have 
the belts running in a specific direction so deflection of the tread width does not occur under load.
Running backwards can cause deformation and delamination  of the tire. Getting the tires in the
proper temperature range can be done by stiffining or softening springs or roll bars and to lesser 
degree raising or lowering tire pressures. Stiffer springs and lower air pressure will increase temps.
and visa versa.   
<P>
External friction... is generated by slip angle. Slip angle is the difference between the track and the tire.
it occurs in all lateral directions depending on acceleration, deceleration and turning. The key is
controlling slip angle within the tires operating parameters. Too much slip angle will result in higher
tire temps and excessive tire wear. And too little will result in a cold tire that will last forever. Both of
these instances will result in poor traction in all lateral directions. So we must operate whithin those
extremes at all times. The ideal slip angle is one that works for the tire. Racers have no control over
where that tire is most efficient, that is done in the design and manufacturing process. All we can do
is set our chassis to not exceed these ranges.   
<P>
Pressure... can be regulated many ways for desired effect. But maintaining  consistant temps across
the face should be a major consideration. You can and should use tire pressure for tuning your racer.
First things first tires, as we discussed, build heat and air pressure will increase as tire temps goes up.
It's important not to let that pressure build up deform our contact patch. There are several ways to do
this the first is obvious, start with less air pressure to get the desired air pressure at operating temps.
The second is with bleed off valves that keep a tire pressure consistant regardless of increasing
temps. And of coarse you can use a gas that is inert to heat such as nitrogen, however some o2 is
always in the tire (unless you live in space)  and some pressure build is imminent.
<P>
Stagger...The more air in a tire the larger its circumference  A larger tire on the outside of the car
makes up for the difference in distance the inside is traveling as opposed to the outside tires.
Stagger should be used but kept to a minimum. Too much can eat HP down the straights and 
make the car loose going in. However if you need to transition the car fast such as a sprinter or
dirt car or your on a very tight short ashphalt track  get all you can by lowering left rear tire 
pressures. If you want to close the stagger up on longer runs try nitrogen on the rights and air on the lefts.
<p>
Spring rate... is effected by tire pressure as well. The side wall of a tire is also a spring and as such
can be utilized as a tuning tool. Changing several pounds of air pressure in a tire will change the
plyablity of the sidewall and change the effective spring rate. This is even more evident with the
radial tire,  1 pound of air can change the spring rate as much as 25#s per inch. This is because a
radial tire is constructed with the belts running vertical causing centrifical force to stiffen the side
wall as the tire goes faster. This is not as drastic in bias ply tires because of their diaganal placement
of the belts but it still occurs. Look at a dragster tire, it grows tremendesly under acceleration.  
<p>
Chassis height... and therefore wheel weight are also effected by tire pressure due to changes in
circumferences. More or less air raises or lowers the chassis and adds or removes wheel weight.
So if you need to tighten a car up a little put a few extra pounds in the RF and LR and of coarse
the opposite would be true. This also makes an adjustment in stagger at the same time that will
also tighten the car up a bit.
