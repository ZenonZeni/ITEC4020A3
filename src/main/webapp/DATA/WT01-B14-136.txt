The National Aeronautics and Space Administration Scatterometer (NSCAT), 
a microwave radar, will measure near-surface wind velocity (both speed
and direction) over the global oceans. The information derived is critical in 
determining regional weather patterns and global climate.

The NSCAT
will measure wind speeds and directions over at least 90% of the ice-free
global oceans every 2 days - under all weather and cloud conditions. Winds are
a critical factor in determining regional weather patterns and global 
climate.  At present, weather data can be acquited over land, but our only 
knowledge of surface winds over oceans comes from infrequent and sometimes
inaccurate reports from ships. Since oceans cover approximately 70% of
Earth's surface, NSCAT data will play a key role in scientist's efforts to
understand and predict complex global weather patterns and climate systems.<P>

NSCAT has two major systems - the spaceborne instrument system and the
ground data processing system. The flight instrument is a specialized microwave
radar designed to measure winds over the oceans. It will be launched 
into a near-polar Sun-synchronous orbit on the 
Japanese Advanced Earth Observing Satellite (ADEOS), scheduled for flight in
early 1996. Like its predecessor on the Seasat satellite, NSCAT will use
an array of antennas that radiate microwave pulses at a frequency of 14 GHz
across broad regions on Earth's surface. This array of six, 3-m-long antennas
will scan two 600-km bands of ocean - one band on each side of the instrument's
orbital path, separated by a gap of approximately 330 km. Obtaining backscatter
and wind vector information nearly continuously, NSCAT will be able to make
190,000 wind measurements per day - more than 100 times the amount of ocean
wind information presently available from ships. <P>

Ground computers will produce wind measurements within 2 weeks of receiving
raw NSCAT data from the ADEOS spacecraft, with no backlog, throughout
the 3-year mission. Arrangements may be made to allow near-real-time access
to these wind data by agencies such as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration. NSCAT data products will include global backscatter data;
50-km resolution ocean wind vectors in the measurement swaths, and spatially
and temporally averaged, gridded, wind field maps.<P>

As part of the NSCAT project, NASA is also sponsoring a team of 15 scientific
investigators who serve as project advisors during the development of the
instrument and ground data processing system and who will conduct research
based on NSCAT data. Their studies are expected to lead to improved methods of
global weather forecasting and modeling - and possibly to a better 
understanding of environmental phenomena (such as El Nino) that greatly 
affect world economies. <P>

Satellite scatterometers are microwave radar instruments designed specifically
to measure near-surface wind velocity (both speed and direction) over the 
global oceans under all weather conditions. Wind stress is the single 
largest source of momentum to the upper ocean, driving oceanic motions on 
scales ranging from surface waves to basin-wide current systems. Winds over 
the ocean modulate air-sea fluxes of heat, moisture, gases and particulates, 
regulating the crucial coupling between atmosphere and ocean that 
establishes and maintains global and regional climate. Measurements of 
surface wind velocity can be assimilated into regional and global 
numerical weather models, improving our ability to predicate future weather. 
As the only remote sensing systems able to provide accurate, frequent, 
high-resolution measurements of ocean surface wind speed and direction 
under both clear-sky and cloudy conditions, scatterometers will play an 
increasingly important role in oceanographic, meteorological and climatic 
studies during the 1990s and beyond. <P>

Scatterometers use a highly indirectly technique to measure wind velocity
over the ocean, since the atmospheric motions themselves do not 
substantially affect the radiation emitted and received by the radar. 
These instruments transmit microwave pulses and receive backscattered power 
from the ocean surface.  Changes in wind velocity cause changes in 
ocean surface roughness, modifying the radar cross section of the ocean 
and the magnitude of the backscattered power. Scatterometers measure 
this backscattered power, allowing estimation of the normalized radar 
cross section of the sea surface. Backscatter cross
section varies with both wind speed and direction when measured at moderate
incidence angles. Multiple, collocated, nearly simultaneous
normalized radar cross section measurement acquired from several detections can
thus be used to solve simultaneously for wind speed and direction. <P>

The first spaceborne scatterometer flew as part of the Skylab mission in
1973 and 1974, demonstrating that spaceborne scatterometers were 
indeed feasible. The Sea-sat-A Satellite Scatterometer (SASS) 
operated from June to October 19878 and proved that accurate wind 
velocity measurements could be made form
space. The SASS cross section measurements have been used to significantly
refine the empirical model relating backscatter to wind velocity, and the
SASS data have been applied to a variety of oceanographic and meteorological
studies. A single-swath scatterometer operating at C-band is presently
flying on the European Space Agency's Remote Sensing Satellite-1 mission.
When it is launched as part of the ADEOS mission in 1996, NSCAT will be
the first dual-swath, Ku-band scatterometer to fly since Seasat. Additional 
spaceborne scatterometers will be flown in the later 1990s on European and
U.S. spacecraft. <P>
