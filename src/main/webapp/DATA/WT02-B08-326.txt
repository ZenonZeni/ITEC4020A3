Another challenge is controlling the satellite's orbit so that its trace on the ground, or ground track, stays within 1 kilometer (0.6 miles) of a desired path.  By doing this, we cover the same areas of the ocean and can monitor how the sea surface height changes through time.  
<p>
"Maintaining" TOPEX/Poseidon's orbit is needed because atmospheric drag reduces the satellite's altitude and causes the ground track to drift eastward, outside the desired path.  To correct for this eastward drift, we fire onboard thrusters and cause a westward drift in the ground track.  Months later, when atmospheric drag causes the ground track to again drift eastward beyond the acceptable limit, another "Orbit Maintenance Maneuver" is performed.  During TOPEX/Poseidon's first three years in orbit,  we performed eight such maneuvers.
