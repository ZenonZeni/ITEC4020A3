   <a href="mailto:mmcmahon@trvnet.net">George McMahon</A> sat down on the steps of the Capitol building in Des 
Moines Saturday, leaned back, fired up a marijuana cigarette and casually 
inhaled -- and he wasn't breaking any laws.
   <a href="mailto:mmcmahon@trvnet.net">McMahon</A>, who suffers from a rare genetic defect that causes muscle spasms
and nausea, is one of eight people in the United States authorized by the 
federal government to use the drug legally.
   "My hospital bills used to be thousands of dollars.  Now I smoke a 
plant," <a href="mailto:mmcmahon@trvnet.net">McMahon</A>, of Bode, told more than 30 people gathered Saturday for a 
rally in support of legalizing the drug for medical purposes.  "I smoke 
marijuana because it makes me better.  The other pills I took made me 
worse."
   Most who attended the rally, including <a href="mailto:mmcmahon@trvnet.net">McMahon</A>, agreed that both 
corporate and government interests have prevented the drug's wide-spread 
legal use.
   "They're fighting dirty, like in the 1930s when they said marijuana will 
make you mean," <a href="mailto:mmcmahon@trvnet.net">McMahon</A> said.  "They're using weapons against you that you 
don't understand."
   Barbara Douglass of Storm Lake, another person who may use marijuana 
legally, also attended the rally.  Douglass suffers from multiple sclerosis.
   Carl Olsen of the group Iowans for Medical MarUuana, which sponsored the 
rally, said he remains optimistic about favorable legislation becoming law.
   "The legislators aren't afraid they won't get elected for supporting this 
issue," he said.  "The public supports this issue."
   Iowa Sen. Merlin Bartz, R-Grafton, who did not attend the rally but has 
agreed to draft legislation supporting the legal medical use of marijuana, 
said judgments about the drug's proper use should be left to the medical 
community.
   "There are all other types of prescription drugs that are considered 
illegal if not used under the direction of a doctor," Bartz said, "and for 
some reason (marijuana) has been singled out as something that cannot be 
legally prescribed by a doctor.
   "In no way is that an endorsement of legalizing the drug," he added.
   Not all Iowa lawmakers agree.
   Rep. Philip Wise, D-Keokuk, who teaches high school, did not attend the 
rally Saturday but said he would oppose such legislation.
   "Having dealt with teens for the last 26 years, the last thing we need to 
do at this juncture is send the message that the use of any drugs, including 
softer drugs, is acceptable," he said.</PRE>
