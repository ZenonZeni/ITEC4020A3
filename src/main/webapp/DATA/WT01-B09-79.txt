<B>Project Title:  40 Ft Hybrid Electric Transit Bus<p>

Performing Organization:  Kaman Electromagnetics Corporation</B><p>

<B>Project Summary:</B>
<P>
Kaman Electromagnetics Corporation (Kaman) has converted a 40
ft transit bus from a diesel engine based power pack to a hybrid
electric propulsion system configuration. Kaman was the prime contractor in the development, installation, check out, and test
of the hybrid electric propulsion system. The bus is powered by
a propane fueled rotary engine generator set and a NiCd battery
pack that feeds a Kaman PA44 drive motor and power electronics.
The motor drives the existing bus rear differential allowing for
easier vehicle conversion. The complete system provides full four
quadrant operation to permit regenerative braking as well as propulsion
in both forward and reverse.
<P>
Kaman was responsible for the complete propulsion system on the
hybrid electric bus. Engineers developed a top level system design
to fit the hybrid electric propulsion system into the existing
bus without altering passenger capacity or vehicle structure.
The operation and performance of the hybrid electric system are
similar to the operation of a conventional diesel powered bus.
Kaman developed the specifications for the system software, batteries,
battery regulator, vehicle control system, generator set, and
drive motoripower electronics. The system software is realtime
multitasking that was originally developed in accordance with
the DOD MILSTD 2167A and MIL STD 2168 software development standards,
resulting in a high level of maintainability and flexibility.
<P>
<B>Project Deliverables: </B><P>One prototype 40 ft transit bus with
a hybrid electric propulsion system.
</P><P>
<B>Project Schedule: </B><P>The bus will be in Hawaii on or about
May 1, 1996.
