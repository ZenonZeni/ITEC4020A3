<HR><H2>NEXRAD:</H2><H3> ---probably the most advanced hydrometeorological warning and forecast system in the world.</H3><P>
	The hardware keystone of the National Weather Service's major modernization, the Doppler weather surveillance radar (Model WSR-88D) is responsible for a quantum leap in weather forecasting capability.  Nicknamed NEXRAD (for Next Generation Weather Radar), the system is built around a refined radar so sensitive it can detect and identify wind-driven hail, rain, insects, and even dust, then apply Doppler technology to determine data on the speed, direction and movement of shifting winds. As much a signal processor as a radar, NEXRAD has tremendous computing power to analyze and manipulate incoming data. <P>
	"We're now seeing existing complex phenomena in clear air we never before knew were there." says NOAA's Joeph Golden.  "Micro-cold fronts, all sorts of discontinuities. We can now track dust fronts in front of thunderstorms very well." <P>
	Using special computer processing, NEXRAD can  provide unprecedented views of a storm's internal wind movements, identifying, for example, an abrupt shift in wind direction - a hook echo - that marks the mesocyclonic circulation  that accompanies tornado formation.  By viewing the storm system at different elevations in the vertical column above the hook echo (much like a CAT scan)   forecasters are able to detect additional strong inbound-outbound "wind couplets" (AKA  velocity couplets)  to confirm tornado formation - and issue emergency warnings 20 to 30 minutes before a tornadic episode. Similarly,  NEXRAD can detect at the cloud base and above wind movements associated with vortical weather events such as tornadic waterspouts. <P>
	With its associated UNISYS work station, two 19" full color high-resolution displays, dedicated software, and continual upgrades,  NEXRAD is a forecasters dream, able to show, among many displays, hourly rainfall amounts,  wind profiles in the form of velocity and azimuth,  mean radial velocity of vortical storms, and predicted  storm movement at 15 minute intervals. <P>
	The NWS intends to have about 120 NEXRADS deployed through the US and its territories by the end of 1996. Dr. Golden hopes the activation of a NEXRAD system in Key West, Florida will enable him to develop Doppler velocity data, especially from low-level scans of developing waterspouts. <P>

Note: In October Dr. Golden, and co-author Carin Goodall-Gosnell, the Science <P>
Operations Officer at the NWS's new office in Newport, NC. will deliver a research paper on the Cherry Point waterspout at the American Meteorological Society's  Conference on Radar Meteorology, in Vail, Colorado. <P><CENTER><A HREF="spout.html">Back to Severe Weather<P>
