&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Not until the beginning of the 19th century did men even dare to explore the unknown and isolated North. Today, however, we are able to offer voyages that men could only dream of just a few years ago. The main reason for this is the fleet of Russian icebreakers which has become available to the Western world. Russia owns an impressive fleet of powerful icebreakers, staffed with some of the most experienced crew and officers, many of whom have lived their lives in the High Arctic. The North Pole awaits us as we head north from Murmansk (Russia) across the Barents Sea to Franz Joseph Land, with its volcanic mountains and glaciers. Our landings include Cape Flora, noted for its abundance of mosses and lichens, and Rubini Rock and other seabird colonies, where we see dovekies, guillemots, kittiwakes and a variety of nesting Arctic birds. From the helicopters we have incredible views of glaciers, icebergs and volcanic plateaus.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;We continue through the ice to the North Pole, on board the world’s most powerful icebreaker, the 75,000 horsepower <I>Yamal</I>. We navigate through vast ice floes, pressure ridges and hummocks up to three meters thick. We encounter polar bears, walruses, and ivory gulls. We celebrate our arrival to the North Pole and 90º N with a barbecue on the ice. Heading southward we stop at Novaya Zemlya and Ice Bay, where Wilhelm Barents and his party overwintered. On Vaigach Island we explore the tundra and may visit the Nentsy, a reindeer herding people.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Join Zegrahm co-founder Anna Zuckerman-Vdovenko on this wondrous journey to the North Pole. 1997 will be Zegrahm’s eighth season in this area and Anna’s tenth voyage to the Pole - surely this must be a record!
