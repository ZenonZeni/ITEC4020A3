describe the occurrence, availability, and physical, chemical, and
biological characteristics of surface and ground water and their
inter-relationship.

<LI>Conducts supportive basic and problem-oriented research in
hydraulics, hydrology, and related fields of science and engineering to
improve the basis for field investigations and measurement techniques
and to understand hydrologic systems sufficiently well to predict
quantitatively their response to stress, either natural or manmade.

<LI>Disseminates water data and the results of investigations and
research through reports, maps, computerized information services, and
other forms of public releases.

<LI>Coordinates the activities of Federal agencies in the acquisition
of certain water information.
