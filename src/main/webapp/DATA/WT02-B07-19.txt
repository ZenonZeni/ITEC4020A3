(1) CONGRESS COULD VOTE ON FINAL PASSAGE OF THE CDA TODAY (Thurs 2/1)

House and Senate members of the conference committee considering the 
telecommunications reform legislation, which includes the Exon "Communications 
Decency Act", are expected to give final approval to the bill today, paving 
the way for a vote in the House of Representatives as early as Thursday 
evening (2/1). The schedule for a Senate vote is unclear, although a vote 
before the end of the week is possible. President Clinton is expected to sign 
the bill.

Even if no votes occur today, once the Conference Committee members agree to 
send the bill to the floor of the House and Senate, no further changes can be 
made. 

Ironically, the possible vote comes exactly one year to the day that Senator 
Exon introduced the original Communications Decency Act (Feb. 1, 1995). 
Although significant changes have been made to the CDA since its introduction, 
the proposal is still an unprecedented violation of the First Amendment rights 
of all Internet users, and threatens to destroy the Internet as a viable means 
of free expression, education, and political discourse.  CDT is committed to 
challenging this bill all the way to the supreme court, if necessary, to 
ensure that these provisions are overturned.

The decision to bring the bill to a vote was unexpectedly announced late 
Wednesday 1/31 after Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole (R-KS) dropped his 
objections to provisions granting broadcasters fee access to new digital 
spectrum.

Despite the objections of civil liberties advocates and the telecommunications
and computer industries, Congress is expected to pass the telecommunications
bill with the CDA intact.  However, if you feel strongly about this issue,
you should continue to speak your mind.  An Action Alert prepared by the 
Voters
Telecommunications Watch (VTW) describing what you can do is attached below.

CDT will post an analysis of the final legislation, along with statements
from key members of Congress and other relevant information soon after the 
final vote.  In the mean time, for more information, including the text and 
analysis of the latest proposal (Dec 21, 1995), see CDT's Net-Censorship 
Issues Web Page (http://www.cdt.org), or send email to <cda-info@cdt.org>

THE LATEST NEWS

The Internet censorship legislation, bundled with the Telecommunications
Deregulation bill (S652/HR1555), would impose a speech standard on the 
Internet of "indecency", dumbing down public discourse on the net to
only that which is appropriate for children.   It could be voted on as
early as this Thursday, 2/1/96.

This legislation, available from http://www.cdt.org/cda.html, has changed
consistently for the worse despite the best efforts over the last year of
many public interest groups to bring it in line with the protections outlined
in the First Amendment.

Congress is poised to vote on Thursday, Feburary 1.  We are not hopeful
that Congress will reject the behemoth Telecommunications bill on the basis
of the unconstitutional Internet censorship language.  It is likely to pass,
or be cemented in stone to prevent it from changing in any way before a
future vote, should this one be delayed.

This is one issue that, despite the legislative efforts of the best civil
liberties representatives on the planet, will have to be resolved in court.

________________________________________________________________________
WHAT YOU CAN DO NOW

It is unlikely that even a massive public outcry will be enough to defeat
the Telecommunications Deregulation bill.  We do feel that you should
continue to speak your mind however, and remind Congress that you are
concerned about the callousness with which they treat the First Amendment
in a medium they often have little experience in.  Remember, no matter
how bad it gets this year, someone will probably introduce a similar
bill next year, and we'll need to continue to educate these people all over
again.

1. Call your Senators and Representatives and tell them you find the
   net censorship provisions unacceptable.  A complete list of legislators
   can be found at http://www.house.gov/ and http://www.senate.gov/.
   In addition, you can try looking up your Senator with the Zipper, a
   service which lets you look up your legislator by entering your zipcode.

   Sample communique:

        <ring ring>

        RECEPTIONIST
        Hello, this is Senator Dongle's office.  May I help you?

        YOU
        Congress is about to vote on provisions of the telecommunications 
        reform bill which will cripple the Internet as a viable means of
        free expression, education, and commerce.  I am outraged that this
        proposal has made it this far.  Please do everything in your power
        to remove these provisions from the bill.

        RECEPTIONIST
        Ok, thanks for calling!

2. If anything interesting transpires during the call, send us email at
   vtw@vtw.org so we can investigate.

        $ Mail vtw@vtw.org
        Subject: called Senator Dongle

        I called Senator Dongle, and his staff says that they weren't
        aware that anyone had a problem with the Internet censorship
        language.  Perhaps you should pay them a visit.

        ^D
        Mail sent!

3. Sit back and watch the court challenge.  We hoped it wouldn't have to come
   to this.

CHRONOLOGY OF THE COMMUNICATIONS DECENCY ACT

Jan 31, '96     The House and Senate prepare to signoff on the conference
                report for the Telecomm bill and rush a vote to the floor.
Dec  7, '95     The House half of the Telecomm conference committee
                votes the "indecency" standard for online speech into
                the Telecomm Deregulation bill.
Sep 26, '95     Sen. Russ Feingold urges committee members to drop
                Managers Amendment and the CDA from the Telecommunications
                Deregulation bill
Aug  4, '95     House passes HR1555 which goes into conference with S652.
Aug  4, '95     House votes to attach Managers Amendment (which contains
                new criminal penalties for speech online) to
                Telecommunications Reform bill (HR1555).
Aug  4, '95     House votes 421-4 to attach HR1978 to Telecommunications
                Reform bill (HR1555).
Jun 30, '95     Cox and Wyden introduce the "Internet Freedom and Family
                Empowerment Act" (HR 1978) as an alternative to the CDA.
Jun 21, '95     Several prominent House members publicly announce their
                opposition to the CDA, including Rep. Newt Gingrich (R-GA),
                Rep. Chris Cox (R-CA), and Rep. Ron Wyden (D-OR).
Jun 14, '95     The Senate passes the CDA as attached to the Telecomm
                reform bill (S 652) by a vote of 84-16.  The Leahy bill
                (S 714) is not passed, but is supported by 16 Senators
                who understand the Internet.
May 24, '95     The House Telecomm Reform bill (HR 1555) leaves committee
                in the House with the Leahy alternative attached to it,
                thanks to Rep. Ron Klink of (D-PA).  The Communications
                Decency Act is not attached to it.
Apr  7, '95     Sen. Leahy (D-VT) introduces S.714, an alternative to
                the Exon/Gorton bill, which commissions the Dept. of

                (such as the CDA) is necessary.
Mar 23, '95     S314 amended and attached to the telecommunications reform
                bill by Sen. Gorton (R-WA).  Language provides some provider
                protection, but continues to infringe upon email privacy
                and free speech.

Feb 21, '95     HR1004 introduced by Rep. Johnson (D-SD)
