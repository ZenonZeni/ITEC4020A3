	(a) Except as otherwise provided in this subpart, beginning with model year
1996, the following percentages of new light duty motor vehicles acquired
annually for state government fleets, including agencies thereof but excluding
municipal fleets, shall be alternative fueled vehicles;<p>
(1) 10 percent of the vehicles acquired in model year 1996;<p>
	(2) 15 percent of the vehicles acquired in model year 1997;<p>
(3) 25 percent of the vehicles acquired in model year 1998;<p>
(4) 50 percent of the vehicles acquired in model year 1999; and<p>
(5) 75 percent of the vehicles acquired in model year 2000 and thereafter.<p>
	(b) Each State shall calculate its alternative fueled vehicle acquisition
requirements for the state government fleets, including agencies thereof, by
applying the alternative fueled vehicle acquisition percentages for each model
year to the total number of new light duty motor vehicles to be acquired during
that model year for those fleets.  <p>
	(c) If, when the mandated acquisition percentage of alternative fueled
vehicles is applied to the number of light duty motor vehicles to be acquired
by a fleet subject to this subpart, a number results that requires the
acquisition of a partial vehicle, an adjustment to the acquisition number will
be made by rounding the number of vehicles up to the next whole
number.<b></b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b>[[section]]490.202  Acquisitions satisfying the mandate.</b><p>
	In addition to the use of alternative fueled vehicle credits under subpart F
of this part, the following actions within a model year qualify as acquisitions
that count toward compliance with the new light duty alternative fueled vehicle
mandates by State fleets:<p>
	(a) The purchase or lease of an Original Equipment Manufacturer vehicle,
(regardless of model year of manufacture), capable of operating on alternative
fuels that was not previously in service in the fleet; or<p>
	(b) The purchase or lease of an after-market converted vehicle (regardless of
model year of manufacture), that was not previously in service in the fleet;
or<p>
	(c)  The conversion of a newly purchased Original Equipment Manufacturer
Vehicle (regardless of the model year of manufacture) to operate on alternative
fuels prior to its first use in service.<p>
<p>
<b>[[section]]490.203  Light Duty Alternative Fueled Vehicle Plan.</b><p>
<b>(a) General Provisions.</b><p>
	(1) In lieu of meeting its acquisition requirements under [[section]]490.201
exclusively through State-owned vehicles, a State may follow a Light Duty
Alternative Fueled Vehicle Plan approved by DOE under this section. 	<p>
	(2) Unless a fleet is exempt under [[section]]490.204, a State which does not
have an approved plan in effect under this section will be subject to the State
fleet acquisition percentage requirements of [[section]]490.201.<p>
	(3) In the event that a significant commitment under an approved plan is not
met by a participant of a plan, the State shall meet its percentage
requirements under [[section]]490.201 or submit to DOE an amendment to the plan
for DOE approval.<p>
	(4) Only voluntary acquisitions or conversions, or combinations thereof, by
state, local, and private fleets may be used to meet the State's alternative
fuel vehicle acquisition requirement under the plan. 	(5) Any acquisitions or
conversions of light duty alternative fueled vehicles by fleets within the
State may be included within the plan, irrespective of whether the vehicles are
in excluded categories in the definition of fleet set forth in [[section]]490.2
of this part. 	<p>
<b>	(b) Required elements of a plan.</b>  Each plan must include the following
elements:<p>

meets the requirements of this subpart;<p>
	(2) Identification of state, local and private fleets that will participate in
the plan;<p>
	(3) Number of new alternative fueled vehicles per plan participant, either
through conversion or acquisition; <p>

fulfill significant commitments by plan participants, in order to meet the
requirements of [[section]]490.201;<p>
	(6) A provision by the State to monitor and verify implementation of the
plan;<p>
	(7) A provision certifying that all acquisitions and conversions under the
plan are voluntary and will meet the requirements of [[section]]247 of the
Clean Air Act, as amended (42 U.S.C. [[section]]7587) and all applicable safety
requirements.<p>
	<b>(c) When to submit plan.</b>  Beginning with model year 1996, any State
wishing to submit a plan under this section must do so no later than June 1
prior to the model year covered by such plan.<p>
	<b>(d) Review and approval.</b>  DOE shall review and approve a plan which
meets the requirements of this subpart and is designed to achieve at a minimum,
the same number of alternative fueled vehicle acquisitions or conversions as
would be required under [[section]]490.201 within 60 days of the date of
receipt of the plan by DOE at the address in paragraph (h)(1) of this section.
<b>	</b><p>
<b>	(e) Disapproval of plans.</b>  If DOE disapproves or requests a State to
submit additional information, the State may revise and resubmit the plan to
DOE within a reasonable time.  States, however, must comply with
[[section]]490.201 until such time as the plan is approved.<p>
<b>	(f) How a State may modify an approved plan.</b>  If a State determines
that it cannot successfully implement its plan, it may submit to DOE for
approval, at any time, the proposed modifications with adequate justifications.
Until the modifications are approved, the State must comply with
[[section]]490.201.<p>
<b>	(g) Where to submit plans.</b><p>
