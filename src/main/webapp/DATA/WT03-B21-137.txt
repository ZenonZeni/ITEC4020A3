				<TD ALIGN=LEFT><B>The La Coipa open pit mine in the Atacama desert region of northern Chile is one of South America's largest gold mines and one of the world's largest silver producers. It is located in Copiapo Province, 800 kilometres north of Chile's capital, Santiago, and is accessible by a 140-kilometre road from the regional centre of Copiapo. In 1995, La Coipa produced 282,000 ounces of gold and 9,426,000 ounces of silver, or 409,200 ounces of gold and gold equivalent at a cash cost of $168 per gold equivalent ounce.</B>

		<P><IMG SRC="/images/LaCoipa1.jpg" ALT="La Coipa Mine Site" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=165 ALIGN=RIGHT BORDER=0>TVX Gold has a 50% interest in La Coipa, held through its 50% indirect interest in Compania Minera Mantos de Oro which owns the mine. An indirect subsidiary of Placer Dome Inc. of Vancouver owns the remaining 50% interest and is the operator.
<P>Reserves at La Coipa at the end of 1995 contained 6.7 million gold equivalent ounces, sufficient for over 16 years of operation at planned production rates.
<P>The La Coipa property consists of approximately 7,500 hectares of mineral claims. The ore deposits form part of a precious metal epithermal system located in the northern Chilean Tertiary volcanic belt known as the Maricunga belt. The main Ladera-Farellon and Coipa Norte zones are about three kilometres apart. Exploration drilling which resumed in 1992 after an 8-year break has since identified the satellite Farellon Bajo ore zone adjacent to the Ladera-Farellon pit, and the Brecha Norte orebody beside the Coipa Norte deposit.
<P>All of La Coipa’s reserves occur in oxidized zones. The eastern portion of the Coipa Norte orebody and the Farellon deposit are semi-tabular in form, characterized by high gold grades associated with argillitic alteration and occur primarily within Triassic sediments. The Ladera and western Coipa Norte orebodies are mushroom-like in shape, have high silver-to-gold ratios, are silicified, and occur within a pyroclastic unit, in the upper portions of the mineralized zones. It is believed the Coipa Norte silver zone has not undergone significant erosion, while at Ladera, the upper portion of the host pyroclastic rocks is strongly leached and almost barren, suggesting secondary enrichment as the source of the high silver in the ore.
<P>Mining of all ore and waste at La Coipa utilizes conventional open pit mining methods and equipment. The Ladera-Farellon orebody is being mined in three separate pit phases. Mining of the Coipa Norte deposit began in 1995.
<P>In the milling process, ore is crushed, then ground in a circuit incorporating a semi-autogenous mill with a pebble crusher and two ball mills. The ground ore is leached, then filtered and washed to separate out the tailings, and passed through a Merrill-Crowe plant and the refinery. In operation since 1991, the Phase II La Coipa plant was designed to process 15,000 tonnes of ore daily. During 1995, certain installations from the original Phase I 1,000 tonnes per day agitation leach plant, which was in operation from May 1989 until April 1991, were returned to production to increase overall capacity to exceed 16,000 tonnes per day.
<P>Funding of the Phase II plant was provided by $250 million of project financing arranged on a non-recourse basis to TVX Gold. Based on a $25 million prepayment in December 1995, it is expected that this financing will be repaid before the end of 1996.
<P>Production from La Coipa in 1996 is planned to amount to 237,000 ounces of gold and 13.6 million ounces of silver.
