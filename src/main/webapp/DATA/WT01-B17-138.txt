<blockquote>
<P>




	I believe that in most cases it is wise to remove toxic metals such as mercury from the mouth. Generally, by the time a patient gets to me, she may already be seriously ill or plagued with confusing symptoms for which no one has been able to find a medical answer. In most cases, patients in this condition request that I remove their mercury amalgam dental fillings, even though they have no firm assurance that their health problems will be improved. That was Melanie’s plight.<p>

	<br><b>DEPRESSION CAUSED BY MERCURY FILLINGS.</b> Melanie suffered from severe depression which had worsened after she broke a tooth and exposed a new surface of amalgam. She wanted all 8 of her mercury amalgams removed immediately. Melanie told me she felt suicidal and out of control and could not wait even one more day to have this procedure done. I gave her vitamins, minerals, and homeopathic remedies to prepare her system for the mercury removal which would be done several days later.<p>
	Her reaction to having the mercury removed was dramatic. Her depression lifted immediately and she rapidly became a normal, healthy woman again. Melanie feels she would have killed herself if the mercury had not been taken out of her teeth.<p>
	In my experience, the majority of patients who have their mercury amalgams removed see positive and often dramatic improvements in their health. In fact, a Patient Adverse Reaction Report (1994) involving 762 people showed that about 24% reported symptoms of depression and 100% of these reported feeling “better or cured” after their mercury dental amalgams were removed.<p>

	<br><b>WHAT THE WHOLE-BODY DENTIST KNOWS.</b> In December 1990, 60 Minutes aired a story called “Is There Poison in Your Mouth?” in which they focused on the controversy over mercury dental amalgam fillings. The viewing public responded in droves, requesting dentists across the U.S. to remove their mercury-based fillings. Many dentists reacted to this pressure and replaced their patients’ fillings even though they were not adequately trained to do so. The results were disastrous.<p>
	I received hundreds of calls during the months that followed this broadcast from patients who had their fillings removed and then became very ill. Why? Because improper amalgam removal, especially in patients already somewhat ill, can cause complications and possibly produce toxic mercury exposure at much higher levels than they had with the mercury in their teeth. Even worse, few dentists know how to recognize the symptoms of mercury poisoning or know how the human body stores and processes toxins, yet this information is crucial to a successful removal of mercury amalgams.<p>
	A dentist trained adequately in the protocols of what I call Whole-Body Dentistry™ will understand the body’s processes as a unified ecosystem and will never remove amalgam fillings without preliminary testing. First, we must evaluate how your body currently is handling the mercury poison; second, we must determine your overall health and immunological vitality.<p>
	A “provocative urine” test can reveal how saturated with mercury your body tissues are. A mercury vapor test tells us how much mercury is escaping the fillings as vapor during chewing and when your teeth are at rest. A metals compatibility test shows us your reaction at the immunological level to the heavy metal components of the filling. I use electro-dermal screening to evaluate the impact of mercury on the body’s acupuncture meridians or energy circuits. I also check for electrical interference generated by the amalgam fillings, using a meter that reads electrical current in the mouth. <p>
	These tests give the dentist evidence regarding how the patient’s body is managing the impact of mercury poison. However, each individual has a unique toxicity threshold.<p>

	<br><b>PREPARING FOR MERCURY REMOVAL.</b> When the decision to remove the mercury fillings is made, before proceeding it’s important that the body systems be working efficiently. The feces are a major excretory route for mercury, so it’s essential that the patient’s eliminatory system be working well. If there is constipation or sluggish bowels, this must be corrected. While mercury remains in the teeth, there is a constant low level of mercury poisoning in the body; after amalgam removal when the body begins to detoxify, the mercury must be flushed out of the body rapidly and thoroughly.<p>
	For a relatively healthy person preparing to remove the mercury, this involves taking vitamins, minerals, and homeopathic remedies. During the mercury removal, we administer vitamin C intravenously to minimize the harmful impact of mercury suddenly entering the bloodstream. Attention to diet and nutrition immediately before, during, and immediately after amalgam removal, factor heavily in a patient’s ability to flush toxins out of the body. Strategic use of the diet can help the body fight infection and hasten the healing process, sometimes even minimizing the need for medication. <p>
	I encourage my patients to eat extra amounts of eggs (2-4 daily) for their high sulfur content; the sulfur bonds with mercury and other metals and carries them out of the body. I recommend higher than normal daily amounts of vitamin C (a maximum of 3000 g, taken in 1000 g doses). <p>
	I often advise my patients to receive massage, acupuncture, or homeopathic remedies to help in the healing process. Detoxifying baths, sauna, and exercise are also useful because they help a patient to literally “sweat out” the poisons.<p>
	When I remove the mercury amalgam from a patient who is suffering from a number of ailments and the symptoms do not completely clear up, I immediately think about the negative influence of root canals and cavitations (improperly healed tooth extraction sites). Both of these dental conditions can produce significant problems in the way the body functions. <p>

	<br><br><b>A WINDOW INTO THE BODY’S ENERGY SYSTEMS.</b> The best way to isolate the role of these dental factors is with electro-dermal screening. Your dentist may not have heard of this approach yet, but in not too many years this device will undoubtedly be as common to the dental office as the treatment chair and X-ray machine. <p>
	Since every major organ in your body is linked through the energy meridians of acupuncture to a specific tooth, electro-dermal screening (EDS) can provide the whole-body dentist with a great deal of useful information about the state of your teeth and how that state affects any part or system of the body. EDS can help identify “energetic stressors” in the body that are creating blockages in the natural flow of energy. Dental stressors can be anything alien or out of balance in the body such as fillings, crowns, impacted teeth, root canal teeth, sinuses, tonsils, scars, misaligned teeth, inflamed gums, and cavitations. These fields of disturbance are most often located in the head because the mouth is the place where we most readily allow thoughtless or unnecessary surgery, excessive procedures, and implantation of foreign materials.<p> 
	However, the results of this disturbance can be felt anywhere in the body and can block the effectiveness of virtually any treatment. EDS is an exceptionally useful, non- invasive investigational tool that helps me recognize which types of more conventional diagnostic testing might be appropriate to confirm my suspicions of what is going on in the patient’s mouth, as the following case study shows.<p>
	
	<br><b>NO WISDOM IN KEEPING THESE TEETH.</b> Anne Marie first came into my office wearing an oxygen mask. She had to wear it continuously. Several years earlier she had been exposed to strong chemicals used for cleaning furnaces. She became sick, then sicker, especially with breathing problems and heart arrhythmia.<p>
	When I met her, Anne Marie was so ill that the slightest exposure to any airborne chemical would produce a serious disturbance. Consequently, she couldn’t drive a car anymore and she was rapidly getting worse. When I removed her mercury fillings, this stopped her downward slide and produced a slight improvement, but she remained severely ill.<p>
	I used electro-dermal screening to discover that her wisdom teeth were affecting her autonomic nervous system and possibly influencing her breathing and heart problems. Anne Marie also had gum infections around these teeth and I urged her to have them removed. She resisted the proposal. Over the next several months I repeated the EDS investigation and consistently determined that her wisdom teeth were related to her other problems. She finally agreed to have these teeth removed. <p>
	When she returned after the operation, Anne Marie gleefully informed me that not only had she driven the 200 miles from her home but she was down from 5 canisters of oxygen to less than one a week. She told me the positive results of having the wisdom teeth removed were instantaneous, “like someone turning on a light switch.” Immediately following the extraction, her heart rate, which previously had been greatly elevated, returned to normal.<p>

	<br><b>DENTAL PATIENTS AWAKE!</b> Regrettably, the prevailing attitude of most dental patients is this: close your mind and open your mouth (and wallet). They do just as their dentist tells them.<p>
	People have not been taught that the health of their teeth is linked to their overall well-being. I’m amazed at how often people will routinely forget about certain conventional dental procedures they have received because they regard them as minor and without lasting impact. That is why I tell my new patients that D.D.S, the initials for the standard dental degree, could also mean Deadly Dental Syndrome: what your dentist is doing or doesn’t know may be killing you.<p>
