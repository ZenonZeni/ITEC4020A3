Special Features:  Alfred Dunhill New York is an Anglophiles wet dream, with clothes and accessories that hearken back to grander British Empire times.  The store boasts a beautiful new humidor, with "keep" lockers.  However, the cigar selection is extremely limited and more expensive than other retailers.  The bottom line?  It's a wonderful to look, but pricey.<BR>

Name:  <B>DE LA CONCHA</B><BR>
Address: 1390 6th Avenue (between 56th and 57th Streets), New York, NY 10019<BR>
Tel:  (212) 757-3167, (888) CIGAR-04 <BR>
Proprietor:  Lionel Melendi<BR>
Years Operating:  33 <BR>
# of Brands:  "mucho, mucho, mucho"<BR>
Hours:  Mon.-Fri., 8:30-8:30; Sat., 10-8.<BR>
Special Features:  No glitz, no glamour -- just one of the best cigar shops anywhere.  From their generous selection to their crack sales staff, De La Concha represents that finest slice of that bygone era.  Either Lionel Melendi or George Vasquez, store manager is in the store at all times.  Both are Cuban, both are sons of the tobacco trade, and both are personable, chatty cigar scholars.  For straight-up cigar sales, it just doesn't get any better than this. <BR>
