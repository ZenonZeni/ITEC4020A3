<br>
Research in in-situ, non-contact, non-destructive 
evaluation of industrial electronic materials, especially 
GaAs and Si substrates and device-level chips: 
Development of novel laser-based techniques to probe 
deep impurity levels and electronic lifetimes either 
dynamically by pulsed laser excitation, or statically in a 
scanning imaging mode.<p>
