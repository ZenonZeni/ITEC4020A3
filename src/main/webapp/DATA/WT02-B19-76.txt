<i><u>Professor W.D. Baines</u></i><p>
     Research is centered in fluid flows driven by buoyancy.  Specific studies have been
focused on plumes, heat transfer by jets, free convection at large Rayleigh numbers and forced
convection over bodies with heat generation.  Problems studied have applications in ventilation,
pollution dispersion, thermal energy storage and mixing in large containers.  Most solutions have
been obtained using a combination of laboratory experiments, simplified analyses and numerical
simulation. <p>

<i><u>Professor I.G. Currie</u></i><p>
     Research in the area of fluid sciences includes non-intrusive velocity measurements using
Laser-Doppler Anemometry.  A well-equipped LDA Laboratory exists in which measurements
are made involving both single-phase and two-phase flows.  The single-phase flows involve
refractive index matching of the fluid and solid components of the apparatus, thereby permitting
optical access to obscure parts of the flow field.  The two-phase flows include liquids with gas
or vapour bubbles, in both diabatic and adiabatic situations.  A complementary analytical
program exists.  Application of the measurements program are made to the design of heat
exchangers and to flow-induced vibrations. The latter include vortex-induced vibrations and
galloping.  Analyses include both classical mathematics and numerical/computational methods. <p>

<i><u>Professor C.R. Ethier</u></i><p>
    Current research interests involve computational fluid dynamics, fluid flow at low Reynolds
numbers, the fluid mechanics of filtration, and visualization of unsteady flows.  Specific topics
being studied are: advanced finite element simulation of 3-D incompressible flows, flow
visualization using the photochromic dye tracer technique, flow through complex or
inhomogeneous porous materials, hydrodynamic properties of polymers in solution, and
formation of mass transfer boundary layers during filtration.  Most of the problems are tackled
using a combination of theoretical, numerical, and experimental methods. <p>

<i><u>Professor D.F. James</u></i><p>
      Research focuses on the flow of non-Newtonian fluids, particularly to understand the rheology
of viscoelastic fluids like polymer solutions.  The extensional viscosity (or elasticity) of these
fluids is of particular interest because this fluid property is the operative one in important
industrial applications such as secondary oil recovery.  <br>
Our objective is to characterize this property : 
<ol>
<li> by developing instrumentation to measure fluid elasticity and <br>
<li> by analysing kinematics and dynamics at the microscopic or molecular level to develop 
constitutive equations.  
</ol> <p>

<i><u>Professor S. Karpik</u></i><p>
     My research is concerned with the computational challenges posed by the problem of
modeling incompressible fluid flows whose motions may be either laminar or turbulent.  The
objective of this work is to develop the ability to simulate a wide range of environmentally
interesting flows (for example, the short and medium range transport of airborne pollutants over
complex terrain or the dispersal of heated waste water in lakes and rivers).  As a consequence
of the fact that this type of modeling can be very expensive and even tax the capabilities of
supercomputers, I am actively involved in the development of more economical and robust
numerical methods.  Depending on the particular application, my work employs various
combinations of finite difference, finite element, pseudospectral and multigrid techniques. 
Other research interests include object oriented programming methods and the development
of algorithms for parallel computation. <p>

<i><u>Professor J.G. Kawall</u></i><p>
     My research deals with the development of hot-wire anemometry and flow-visualization
methods for the acquisition of digital turbulent-flow data, the development of digital signal
image processing methods for the computer-analysis of flow signals and flow-visualization cin
pictures, and the application of these techniques to a wide variety of laboratory-generated
turbulent flows.  Specific applications are in the areas of building aerodynamics and plume
dispersion. <p>

<i><u>Professor J.F. Keffer</u></i><p>
     The focus of the research is the experimental investigation of turbulent-flow phenomena
through the use of hot wire anemometry and digital image analysis of flow visualization. This
research has two basic objectives, viz, to gain a comprehensive understanding of the physics of
turbulent flows and to obtain quantitative information about these flows, both of which are
relevant to a wide range of industrial and natural turbulent-flow problems.  Current research
includes: <p>
<ul>
<li>Properties of the turbulent/non-turbulent interface characterizing free and partial-bounded
flows, such as wakes, jets, boundary layers, mixing layers and wall jets. 
<li>Detection of the coherent structures embedded within turbulent flows using pattern
recognition, spectral and correlation analyses and phase averaging, and determining the role of
these structures within turbulent transport processes.
<li>The structure of complex turbulent flows in which the phenomena of negative production
occurs. 
<li>Experimental studies on wind induced erosion and suspension of surfaceparticles supported
by Lagrangian dispersion modelling.
<li>The mechanisms of turbulent combustion.
</ul> <p>

<i><u>Professor M.R. Loewen</u></i><p>
Current research topics include acoustic remote sensing of breaking waves, air entrainment
by breaking waves, the dynamics of large-scale breaking waves and the stability of a rotating
cylinder of fluid.  A series of laboratory experiments are being conducted in a computer
controlled wave channel at the Canada Centre for Inland Waters (Burlington, Ontario). 
Measurements are being taken of the volume of air entrained, the sound generated and the
energy dissipated by breaking waves.  The objective of the research is to determine how
variations in the water temperature effect these parameters for small-scale breaking waves. 
Experiments to study the air entrainment, sound generation and energy dissipation produced
by large-scale breaking waves are planned.  The experiments will take place in the world's
largest two dimensional wave channel (300m x 5m x 7m) located in Hannover, Germany.  The
primary objective of this project is to investigate the properties of breaking waves over a wide
range of scales.  In addition, an apparatus has been constructed  for studying the stability of a
rotating horizontal cylinder of water.  Experiments observing the different modes of
hydrodynamic instability and the rotation rates at which they occur are being carried out.<p>

<i><u>Professor H.J. Leutheusser</u></i><p>
     In purely laminar flow, attention is focussed on the effects of roughness on thin lubricating
films, on viscous fluid transients in closed conduits of arbitrary cross-section (which constitutes 
an important problem in haemodynamics), and on non-uniform steady flow in open channels, 
as typically encountered in the conveyance of molten substances in certain industrial 
manufacturing processes. <p>
     Ongoing research in mainly turbulent flow includes experimental studies of unsteady
motion in closed conduits, the fluid dynamics of the cooling flow in high-speed bearings, and the evolution of
vortex rings. <p>
     In addition, there is research in progress on the hydrodynamics of weir flow, the
hydraulics of culverts, shear flow between smooth and rough walls in relative motion, and flow
through rotating systems. <p>
