<p> Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of
the United States of America in Congress assembled, </p>

<p> SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. </p>

<p> This Act may be cited as the `Exclusionary Rule Reform Act of
1995'. </p>

<p> SEC. 2. ADMISSIBILITY OF CERTAIN EVIDENCE. </p>

<p> (a) In General: Chapter 223 of title 18, United States Code,
is amended by adding at the end the following: </p>

<p> `Sec. 3510. Admissibility of evidence obtained by search or
seizure </p>

<p> `(a) Evidence Obtained by Objectively Reasonable Search or
Seizure: </p>

<p> Evidence which is obtained as a result of a search or seizure
shall not be excluded in a proceeding in a court of the United
States on the ground that the search or seizure was in violation
of the fourth amendment to the Constitution of the United States,
if the search or seizure was carried out in circumstances
justifying an objectively reasonable belief that it was in
conformity with the fourth amendment. The fact that evidence was
obtained pursuant to and within the scope of a warrant
constitutes prima facie evidence of the existence of such
circumstances. </p>

<p> `(b) Evidence Not Excludable by Statute or Rule: </p>

<p> `(1) Generally: Evidence shall not be excluded in a
proceeding in a court of the United States on the ground that it
was obtained in violation of a statute, an administrative rule or
regulation, or a rule of procedure unless exclusion is expressly
authorized by statute or by a rule prescribed by the Supreme
Court pursuant to statutory authority. </p>

<p> `(2) Special rule relating to objectively reasonable searches
and seizures: Evidence which is otherwise excludable under
paragraph (1) shall not be excluded if the search or seizure was
carried out in circumstances justifying an objectively reasonable
belief that the search or seizure was in conformity with the
statute, administrative rule or regulation, or rule of procedure,
the violation of which occasioned its being excludable. </p>

<p> `(c) Rule of Construction: This section shall not be
construed to require or authorize the exclusion of evidence in
any proceeding.'. </p>

<p> (b) Clerical Amendment: The table of sections at the
beginning of chapter 223 of title 18, United States Code, is
amended by adding at the end the following: </p>

<p> `3510. Admissibility of evidence obtained by search or
seizure.'. </p>
