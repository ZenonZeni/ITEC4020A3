<CENTER><H1>How Arris, Khepri put deal together</CENTER></H1><P>

<b><center>By Karen Bernstein<br>
Editor-in-Chief</b></center><p>
Despite the stated desire of nearly everyone in biotech to consolidate the industry, mergers don't grow on trees. Last week's announcement of a definitive agreement under which Arris Pharmaceutical Corp. will acquire Khepri Pharmaceuticals Inc. illustrates one solution to several of the key issues facing early to mid-stage biotech companies: both companies faced the problem of building critical mass in a fragmented industry, while Khepri in particular was caught in the limbo of mezzanine venture financing.<p>
With the exception of genomics and screening companies, the financing choices for mid- to late-stage private companies are extremely constrained. For many of these companies, corporate partnering may not be an option until they have identified and begun testing lead compounds. And the fewer the options, the less leverage companies have with mezzanine funders, who have struck increasingly tough bargains as their exit vehicle -- the IPO market -- has been less and less generous.<p>
Those funding realities place strong constraints on young companies, which can find themselves with technology that they don't have enough money to develop.<p>

<CENTER><h3>What Khepri needed</CENTER></h3><P>
Both ARRS and Khepri are developing therapeutics based on proteases, catalytic proteins that alter the structure and function of other proteins and peptides by cutting the targeted molecule.<p>
With $3 million in the bank at Oct. 31, 44 employees and an annual burn rate of $7.5 million, Khepri's choices were to do another funding round or look for a merger. The company has raised $23 million in three rounds of financing since its founding in 1992. At its last round in November 1994, it raised $11 million at $1.50 a share.<p>
<b><center>Timetable slips</b></center><P>
At the same time -- and not unusually -- Khepri found that its timeline for getting its first compounds into the clinic had slipped. "There were things we'd hoped to accomplish, like IND filings and corporate partnering, that didn't happen," said Alex Barkas of Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, a Khepri investor. "If we'd had partners to offset the burn, that would have reduced the need for equity financing. There are lots of reasons why that didn't happen, but at the end of the day it didn't matter why."<p>
Barkas said that companies developing compounds -- as opposed to platform technologies -- face an initial period where it can be difficult to find partners. "It's easy for products with Phase II data. But in that in-between period when you have compounds in preclinical development, or Phase I or early Phase II, people say, 'Maybe we should wait, even if we have to pay more.'"<p>
Whether Khepri decided to go with more venture funding or an acquisition, the reality of the current environment is that valuations have been pushed down for companies with compounds in preclinical development and no corporate partners. <p>
At ARRS's share price of $9.875 prior to the announcement of the deal, the transaction is worth $20 million to Khepri shareholders -- less than the $30 million post-money valuation Khepri had at its last funding round. But Khepri was unlikely to do any better by tapping the financial markets.<p>
"This is reflective of the market for relatively young, private companies," said Khepri President and CEO Ron Henriksen. "Not only have a whole number of players gone away, but those who have stayed are acting like value players. We could have anticipated a very tough next round valuation discussion and a valuation down from the previous round."<p>
Having decided that a merger was the way to move forward, Khepri looked for an older, more established, public company, and came up with four or five candidates. <p>

<CENTER><h3>What ARRS needed</CENTER></h3><P>
ARRS, meanwhile, was looking for additional capabilities and technologies. A common criticism is that most of the so-called "target" companies don't have enough technology to keep a sufficient number of collaborations going to ensure that one or two will be successful. <p>
ARRS's approach to those issues has been two-fold: to focus on targets that address very large markets, and to aim for six active research partnerships at any one time. Some of those then will graduate to clinical development so that, several years out, there will be three or four programs in the clinic with new research collaborations coming up behind them. <p>
"That's a sustainable model: the partners bring cash and reduce the burn rate," said John Walker, president and CEO. "Our Bayer and Pharmacia deals both call for double-digit royalties, while both partners pay the full costs of R&D. We think that's the kind of model you have to strive for, though you can't get double-digit royalties every time."<P>
To make that scenario fly requires a broad opportunity base, which is why ARRS set out to find a new set of targets that fit with its in-house capabilities.<P>
ARRS initiated talks with Khepri in June 1994, in a meeting between Walker, Henriksen and Barkas. "We had already planned to make a bigger drive in protease technology," Walker said. "Alex picked up the obvious synergy between the two  companies."<P>
The companies continued discussions through August 1994, meeting with various board members. But by then Khepri was distracted by a funding round. ARRS then approached Khepri again last January, after ARRS had signed a partnering deal with Bayer AG, and made an offer that wasn't accepted. ARRS then picked up the thread again in August.<P>
ARRS wanted to expand its program beyond serine into cysteine proteases, Walker said. "We had discussions with other companies and universities, and kept coming back to Khepri, given its proximity, its scientists, and the depth and breadth of its technology."<p>

<CENTER><h3>Assessing the synergy</CENTER></h3><P>
Critical to any company thinking about long-term survival is having enough internal opportunities to withstand the inevitable failures of one program or another. At the end of the day, said Barkas, there will be one or two protease companies, one or two transcription factor companies, and so on. "I think there's a first mover advantage here," he said.<p>
ARRS believes the combination will create the most extensive portfolio of new targets of any company pursuing protease drug discovery. The company has long believed that to be successful, discovery companies need prolific pipelines of future product opportunities, Walker said. <p>
There are four main classes of proteases -- serine, cysteine, metalloproteases and aspartyl -- each of which is characterized by the chemical mechanism used by the protease to cleave chemical bonds. Proteases can either activate or inactive their target proteins.<p>
ARRS has been focused on serine proteases, while Khepri has pursued cysteine proteases. But in another year, said Henriksen, they would have been two protease companies competing for corporate deals as each moved into the other's area.<p>
The companies also have different R&D strengths. Khepri has expertise in protease biology, genomics and chemistry to produce reversible and irreversible cysteine protease inhibitors, while ARRS has combinatorial chemistry, screening, rational drug design, pharmacology and its Delta technology.<p>
ARRS hasn't fully disclosed the Delta technology, but it consists of a plasma component used in the design of protease inhibitors to provide structural anchoring at the catalytic site, allowing researchers to design in specificity.<p>
One of the key drawbacks to working with proteases has been the lack of specificity of compounds. Scientists have been able to design potent compounds, but because proteases show a great deal of homology at the catalytic site, specificity has been elusive. "Building in both specificity and potency has been the holy grail of protease inhibition," said Walker.<p>
The merger will allow ARRS to pursue multiple protease targets in parallel, increasing the number of potential partnering opportunities. ARRS plans to adapt its Delta technology for serine proteases to Khepri's cysteine targets, and to expand its internal cloning and expression capabilities through expertise acquired from Khepri.<p>

<CENTER><h3>Valuing the deal</CENTER></h3><P>
One of the hardest parts of M&A discussions is agreeing on the relative valuations of the companies. By this time, Khepri had concluded that it would take a stiff haircut in its next funding, giving it an incentive to be more flexible in any merger talks.<p>
From its side, ARRS had several ways of estimating the value of Khepri. "First, we knew we needed to build what Khepri already had, so there was an opportunity cost to us," said Walker. "That accounts for the majority of the investment decision. Our first assessment was a scientific one: we did a make-vs.-buy analysis."<p>
Beyond that, Khepri brought genomics capability and cysteine protease chemistry that ARRS couldn't build in-house. <p>
On the other hand, ARRS judged that Khepri on its own would be worth less than if it were folded into another company with more resources. "In terms of building value, a broader, more prolific pipeline was worth more than Khepri's smaller pipeline," Walker said. "And the cash we have provides more certainty that Khepri will be able to bring that pipeline to fruition. <p>
"That was a very strong consideration when we were looking at the technology value early on. It's not just the technology value, but the ability of the company to do something with that technology -- and that relates to the availability of capital."<p>
ARRS therefore estimated that the combined companies would be worth more than what ARRS would pay for Khepri.<p>
To make the deal work, Khepri's shareholders had to come to the same conclusion -- that Khepri ultimately would be worth more as part of ARRS than it would be on its own. Thus for Khepri's VCs, the calculus isn't that they'd put $23 million into the company and are getting back stock worth about the same amount.<p>
"This is not a cash-out liquidation event," said Grant Heidrich of the Mayfield Fund, a Khepri investor. "The value of Arris stock is different than if someone had given me cash. I'm not looking at today's value, I'm looking at what will be there in the future."<P>
Barkas also doesn't view it as a liquidation. "Because of the synergies that became apparent here, when we compare it to the alternatives for the company, we said this looks pretty attractive. <p>
"We had a company trapped in mid-stage financing hell, because of the absence of any true mid-stage and mezzanine financing in the biotech sector. That vacuum means the alternatives are going public or refinancing at increasingly less attractive valuations with other venture capitalists who have the same goals you had when you first invested -- and they want to invest at similar valuations. Or you could bring in mezzanine investors who are typically investing in public or private stocks and tend to put onerous terms into their agreements.<p>
"When you look at that as your alternative as compared with doing this, from a valuation standpoint it's probably a wash. And the upside is better here, on a train that's already moving."<p>
In the actual discussions between ARRS and Khepri, the valuation issue was dealt with by setting aside the actual amount of money implied by the deal. That varied with the price of ARRS shares and was at a high of $28 million in early September when ARRS was trading at $13.875. Instead, the parties focused on the number of shares Khepri stockholders would receive. In that way, both sides estimated the proportion of value each company brought to the party. <p>
Under the terms of the deal, ARRS will acquire Khepri in a two-stage closing. At the first closing in December, ARRS will issue 1.5 million shares of stock, of which 1 million will not become eligible for sale until January 1997. On Dec. 30, 1996, ARRS will issue, at its discretion, either 525,000 additional shares of stock or pay the equivalent in cash.<p>
Khepri shareholders will own 16.4 percent of ARRS on a fully diluted basis. Before the deal, ARRS has 10.7 million shares outstanding fully diluted and 8.75 million non-fully diluted.<p>

<CENTER><h3>Combining the programs</CENTER></h3><P>
Khepri has two products in preclinical development, CPI-1 and rNEP, and two in R&D, cathepsin O2 (CatO2) and ICI-1. <p>
CPI-1 (cysteine protease inhibitor-1) is a small molecule inhibitor of cathepsins B,L and S, which are implicated in the tissue destruction associated with rheumatoid arthritis. Recombinant human neutral endopeptidase (rNEP) is a protease that inactivates a wide range of peptide mediators involved in the airway inflammation associated with asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).<p>
ICI-1 is a small molecule inhibitor of the interleukin-1 converting enzyme, ICE, a cysteine protease that promotes inflammation by changing inactive IL-1 to its active form. ICE is implicated in inflammatory bowel disease. <p>
CatO2 is another cysteine protease associated with the bone breakdown seen in osteoporosis.<p>
The company is in discussions with potential partners for all of these programs.
ARRS has focused on inhibition of serine proteases, with most of its research on tryptase, an enzyme with potential to treat asthma and other inflammatory diseases.<p>
The tryptase program is in development with Bayer, under a $70 million November 1994 deal to develop orally active inhibitors of tryptase and chymase, enzymes that play an important role in asthma, allergic rhinitis and allegic conjunctivitis. <p>
APC 366, ARRS's first generation tryptase inhibitor, is part of that deal. The compound is in a Phase IIa trial in asthma, with results to be announced at the end of the first quarter of 1996. A second generation oral inhibitor is in preclinical development.<p>
Work on chymase is in discovery. Chymase is implicated in respiratory ailments, as well as in cardiovascular inflammation.<p>
ARRS is addressing the role of serine proteases in the clotting cascade under a $40 million Sept. 1995 deal with Pharmacia AB to develop oral therapeutics for blood clotting disorders. The partners are developing inhibitors of three serine proteases: Thrombin, Factor Xa and Factor VIIa. The companies have lead candidates in preclinical evaluation.<p>
ARRS also has a separate, broad program in receptor-based discovery technology focused on oral cytokine and growth factor mimetics. It has early drug leads with Amgen Inc. for an oral mimetic of erythropoietin, while a collaboration with Pharmacia in human growth hormone is slightly ahead of the EPO program. ARRS is in early research on its own in G-CSF (granulocyte-colony stimulating factor) and TPO (thrombopoietin).<p>
In addition, ARRS has two other collaborations with Pharmacia: a deal covering ARRS's molecular diversity and high throughput screening technologies, and a collaboration to apply ARRS's artificial intelligence technology to Pharmacia's in-house drug development.<p>
ARRS is internally organized into three groups with different R&D responsibilities. A core discovery group will incorporate Khepri's general technology expertise, while Khepri's protease programs will be folded into the protease group. A third group has responsibility for the receptor programs.<p>
Within the protease program, decisions will be made on prioritizing the various programs. ARRS's two partnered programs will have top priority. Next, Walker said, will be Khepri's cathepsin programs in rheumatoid arthritis. "We see partnering opportunities over a reasonable period, so we want to apply the necessary science and ensure a collaboration," he said.<p>
ICE and CatO2 are earlier and will have lower priority. ARRS plans to apply its Delta technology to those molecules. <p>
Finally, ARRS will complete ongoing preclinical studies of rNEP, which falls outside its small molecule focus, and evaluate partnering opportunities based on the data.<p>
The combined company will have 152 employees, and ARRS plans a reduction of about 15 percent. ARRS's burn rate in 1995 was less than $3 million, and was projected to rise to $6 million in 1996. Combined with Khepri's projected 1996 burn of $8-$9 million, that would total $14-$15 million. <p>
The company has committed to reduce the combined burn by 25 percent going forward. In 1996, operating expenses are projected at $26 million, with a burn rate of $11-$12 million. Those figures don't account for increased revenues that might accrue from new corporate partnerships.<p>
The acquisition will be accounted for as a purchase. ARRS will take write off the bulk of the purchase price as in-process R&D this quarter. A decision hasn't been made on the fate of Khepri Canada, a 50 percent owned subsidiary.<p>

<CENTER><h3>Finding first principles</CENTER></h3><P>
Having successfully navigated an acquisition, Walker thinks the difficulties of putting together Tier II and III biotech companies are myriad. Even before the practical issues of negotiating between competing egos and notions of value, are the fundamental issues of finding companies that are truly synergistic -- beyond the trite use of that word in every merger announcement.<p>
"There needs to be complementarity of science -- not redundancy but complementarity," said Walker. "While program overlap may present an opportunity to cut the combined burn rate, that's a financial issue, not a business growth issue. Growth is best accomplished by complementarity."<p>
Also critically important is equality between the two sides coming together. "That's difficult," said Walker, "because of competition on the management teams over who's going to make decisions. With any organization, you clearly have to define who has the leadership role. Where people get into difficult straits is figuring out who will do that."<p>
In this case, Henrikson will stay on until the end of the year, while three members of Khepri's management, Dave Estell, Don Payan and Jean Warner, will stay on as ARRS vice presidents.<p>
But while the realities of management mean there can't be two chiefs, at the employee level, mergers and acquisitions can be accomplished in such a way that the members of the junior company don't feel like victims. <p>
"Even though this is billed as an acquisition, we made a very specific commitment to the Kepri and Arris people that scientifically this is a merger of equals," Walker said. "The reductions will be borne by both companies, not solely by Khepri. That's a very important message, because you need to insure there's no we/they orientation, but a unified group of scientists."<p>
Finally, true mergers are hard to pull off if the companies aren't geographically proximate, and there's no reason to expect that one company's perfect partner will be located next door, as Khepri and ARRS are in South San Francisco.<p>
Finding all of those elements in one package will be very hard for most companies, he concluded. <p>
