<B>SCHOOL-TO-WORK OPPORTUNITIES ACT<P>
</B>On May 4th, President Clinton signed the School-to-Work Opportunities Act into law.  The law authorizes $300 million for FY 1995 to develop and establish school-to-work transition programs.  CEC played an integral role in crafting the law by promoting recommendations that were eventually incorporated into the final legislation.  CEC's main concern centered on the inclusion of children with exceptionalities in the school-to-work transition programs.  It was critical to ensure programs were designed in such a way to provide the support and accommodations necessary for children with disabilities to fully participate.  <P>
Following is a brief summary of provisions in the law that will encourage the participation of students with disabilities:<B><P>
Definition of All Students.  </B>Similar to Goals 2000, the law defines the term "all students" to include students with disabilities and academically talented students.  Throughout the legislation, the term all students is used to ensure programs are designed in such a way to ensure the opportunity to participate is extended to the entire student population. <B> <P>
School Site Mentor. </B> The transition programs will provide each student with a school site mentor to act as a liaison among the student and the employer, school, teacher, school administrator, and parent of the student.  The school site mentor will work in consultation with both teachers and related services personnel.<B>  </B><P>
<B>Work Experience.  </B>The House version of the bill required <B>paid</B> work experience to be apart of any transition program, while the Senate just required work experience.  Many believed that by requiring paid work experience, job opportunities would be limited.  The final legislation does not require paid work experience.      <B> </B><P>
<B>Career Awareness and Exploration.  </B>Every transition program must provide career awareness and career exploration and counseling.  The Senate required these services to begin prior to the 11th grade.  The House began these services much earlier, requiring the services begin no later than the middle school grades.  CEC strenuously advocated the need to begin early.  The law now calls for services to begin no later than 7th grade.<P>
<B>State Programs.  </B>For a State to receive a development grant, the State is required to describe in its State Development Plan how it will provide opportunities for students with disabilities and academically talented students in the school-to-work programs.  For an implementation grant, a State must submit a State Implementation Plan that describes how the State will ensure "effective and meaningful opportunities" (language taken from the ADA) for all students to participate in programs.  <P>
A State is also required in both the State Development Plan and in the State Implementation Plan to describe the manner in which the State has obtained and will continue to obtain the participation of teachers and related services personnel in the planning and development of the transition program.  States must also describe the State's strategy for providing training to  teachers and related services personnel.         <P>
<B>Graduation Assistance.  </B>With the funds provided to States through implementation grants, States will provide subgrants to local partnerships.  Local partnerships may use the funds for a variety of school-to-work activities including a graduation assistance program to assist at-risk students, low achieving students and students with disabilities in graduating from high school, enrolling in postsecondary education, and finding or advancing in jobs.<P>
<B>Professional Development.  </B>Local partnerships are authorized to design local strategies to provide adequate planning time and staff development activities for teachers, school counselors and related services personnel for the implementation of school-to- work programs.<P>
<B>Assessments of Programs.  </B>The Secretaries of Education and Labor will make grants to establish a system of performance measures for assessing State and local programs on a range of issues including the outcomes of participating students and school dropouts, by gender, race, ethnicity, socioeconomic background, LEP, and the disability of the participants and whether the participants are academically talented students.
