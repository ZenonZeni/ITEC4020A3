Euthanasia: Beyond Final Exit</H1>

<H2>New Research in Self-Deliverance [Rational Suicide] for the Terminally Ill</H2>

<P><A HREF="resume.html">Chris Docker</A>, Cheryl Smith, John Hofsess,
Bruce Dunn. 1995, 116 pp, ISBN:1-896533-04-3. Individual book sales (not
USA or Canada): Tel +44-131-556-4404. Price: &pound; 8 GBP(UK) &pound;

<P>The latest research in self-deliverance (auto-euthanasia/rational suicide) available
at last... Academic articles on rational suicide including a history of
books on self-deliverance and one of the most comprehensively referenced
articles on fasting available. The Title is based on the series of articles
in the Canadian journal &quot;Last Rights&quot; in which some of the chapters
initially appeared. </P>

<UL>
<LI><B>Beyond Final Exit</B> explains... the history of suicide guides
and the reliability (and unreliability) of information in them. </LI>

<LI><B>Dispels the myth</B> that a leading, lethal, over-the-counter drug
can cause blindness in the event of failure, discusses the lethal dose
and the supporting evidence. </LI>

<LI><B>Analyses</B> the use of tricyclic antidepressants, frequently prescribed
drugs that can be lethal alone or in combination. </LI>

<LI><B>Discusses</B> <I>street drugs</I> - illicit drugs bought on the
black market - should they be used for self-deliverance if you get access
to them? </LI>

<LI><B>Answers</B> common questions about poisonous plants - if you're
optimistic about these, be warned of the side effects first! </LI>

<LI><B>What about</B> carbon monoxide? The favourite method of Dr Kevorkian?
Beyond Final Exit looks at its effectiveness and obtaining supplies, and
there is also a chapter on other inert gases worth considering. </LI>

<LI><B>Fasting?</B> In Departing Drugs there is only a passing reference
to controlled fasting as a means of self-deliverance. .<IMG SRC="awardchp.gif" VSPACE=3 HEIGHT=34 WIDTH=285 ALIGN=RIGHT>Many
people have used this method successfully and yet it is not without its
critics. <I>Beyond Final Exit</I> includes what is probably the most comprehensive
examination of the known facts on this method </LI>

<LI><B>New information</B> has come to light in recent years on barbiturates
were virtually discontinued twenty years ago but some people have old supplies
or manage to obtain them and want to know the dosages and effectiveness.
and, in this new volume,<I> Beyond Final Exit</I> takes a fresh look at
the evidence. </LI>

<LI><B>The International Drugs Consensus Working Party</B> published the
fruits of their research in <I>Departing Drugs</I> - the <I>Supplement
to How to Die With Dignity,</I> and many people wanted to know the reasoning
behind some of the controversial new developments, so a scientific <I>companion</I>
was planned. While in preparation, more research was accomplished and new
information brought to light. <B>Self deliverance guides</B> were pioneered
by the Voluntary Euthanasia Society of Scotland with <I>How to Die With
Dignity</I> in 1980; they were popularised by Derek Humphry in his best-seller
<I>Final Exit</I> and placed on a scientific footing with <I>Departing
Drugs.</I> Now, in 1995, the Scottish Voluntary Euthanasia Society proudly
presents <I>Beyond Final Exit,</I> the latest research into self-deliverance.
</LI>

<LI><B>Supported</B> by hundreds of references to supporting data, <I>Beyond
Final Exit</I> bares its finding to scrutiny by other researchers worldwide.
It is already the subject of strong interest from the Netherlands, where
self-deliverance (in preference to doctor-administered euthanasia) is gaining
ground. </LI>

<LI>Beyond Final Exit gives you the facts and the secure knowledge on methods
of self-deliverance. <I>Beyond Final Exit</I> is already in its second
printing. Order your copy now while stocks last. </LI>
