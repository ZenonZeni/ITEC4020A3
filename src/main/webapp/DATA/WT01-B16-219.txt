<b>CANCER TREATMENT<br>
Interest in Alternative Approaches Is Rising</b><p>
Confidence in the efficacy of alternative medicine as a treatment option for cancer is growing impressively. The American Cancer Society estimated in 1993 that 9% of U.S. cancer patients use complementary therapies, although other researchers placed the figures higher—at 10% to 60%. <p>
A study undertaken at New York Hospital in 1994 revealed that about 30% of breast cancer patients polled said they had consulted an alternative practitioner while 25% were currently receiving some form of "unconventional" therapy such as shark cartilage, medicinal mushrooms, Chinese herbs, or vitamin injections.<p>
Yet another study in Cancer (1991) estimated that anywhere from 10% to 50% of cancer patients try some form of alternative or complementary care; the same study reported that 5% of cancer patients abandon conventional treatment in favor of alternative approaches. The U.S. government estimates that in 1992 the public spent $2 billion on alternative cancer treatments. 	<p>
Based on the most conservative estimate that 10% of U.S. cancer patients consult alternative practitioners every year, this means that at least 100,000 cancer patients are under alternative care or using alternative substances as part of a cancer treatment program.<p>
The trend toward incorporating more alternative practices in cancer care is growing worldwide. A 1994 survey (published in the British Medical Journal) of 415 cancer patients in 2 London hospitals indicated that 16% had used alternative therapies for cancer. Among the most popular modalities used were relaxation, visualization, diet, homeopathy, vitamins, and herbs. The average user of these alternative therapies was 50, married, and female; 82% were either "satisfied" or "very satisfied" with the therapies, describing the benefits as both physical and psychological.<p>
A 1994 study at the Women's and Children's Hospital in South Australia (published in The Medical Journal of Australia) showed that about 46% of children, aged 4-16, with cancer had received at least one alternative treatment and that fewer than 50% of the children's parents discussed their use of alternative methods with their conventional doctors. Among the preferred modalities were positive imagery (17%), hypnotherapy (15%), relaxation exercises (10%), diet (8%), and multivitamins (8%). Of the children's parents, 83% stated that there were no side effects.<p>
According to the European Journal of Oncology (October 1995), of 630 cancer patients in Norway, 20% had been or were currently users of alternative therapies (called "non-proven therapies" in the survey) for their cancer. Among the most popular methods were therapeutic touch, herbs, vitamins, diet, and Iscador (an injectable remedy from mistletoe). Up to 40% of these patients had used alternative therapies for other illnesses prior to developing cancer.<p>
In the Netherlands, of 949 oncology outpatients polled at several hospitals, 9% said they were presently using alternative medicine in addition to conventional approaches. Of the patients with lymphatic cancer at the Center of Oncology in Krakow, Poland, 25% had received alternative therapies prior to admission. In Germany, out of 160 cancer patients, 53% said they had used alternative medicine at some point in their medical history.<p>

<b>BOTANICALS ARE BIG!<br>
Sales of Natural Herbal Products Climb</b><p>
The new annual survey of natural herbal products sales by Whole Foods magazine shows "strong growth" for herbs. For the average  store, with yearly sales of about $800,000, herbal products represent 27% while herbal body care and cosmetics pull in 6%. <p>
Retailers responding to Whole Foods' survey said their 1996 overall herbal products sales were up 32% over the previous year, while sales of herbal supplements alone have grown by 7.8%. Among the biggest selling herbs are Echinacea (representing 9.6% of all herbal sales), garlic (7.2%), followed by ginseng, Ginkgo biloba, and goldenseal; together these 5 account for 33% of all herbal supplement sales. In sixth place is Mu Huang (ephedra), followed by Siberian ginseng, psyllium, saw palmetto, and Cascara sagrada; these 5 represent 16.7% of dollars spent on herbal products. The top 10 herbs captured 49.7% of U.S. herbal sales, says Whole Foods.<p>
Regarding how Americans are using their herbs, Whole Foods reports that 50% take them in capsules, 18% as tablets, 11% as teas, 13% as extracts or tinctures, but only 5.4% as bulk herbs. When asked what obstacles were preventing even stronger herb sales, 41% of U.S. herbal products retailers attribute it to lack of consumer education; for 23%, it is government restrictions on consumer information; and for 18%, it is "scare stories" about herbs in the mainstream media. <p>
In other words, direct political interference by official opponents of herbal products accounts for 41% of the public's resistance to herbs. Only 2% said price was a factor and only 10% considered lack of product standardization or manufacturer promotions to be factors.<p>

<b>59% OF CANADIANS USE ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE</b><p>
According to a poll of 2,629 residents, conducted in June 1996 by the Richmond Regional Health Board in Richmond, British Columbia (Canada), 59.4% said they have tried "complementary" or alternative health therapies, including chiropractic, acupuncture, massage, and aromatherapy. The majority of the respondents (59%) were aged 31-50; 75% were women.<p>
Even more impressive, 86.3% say they are in favor of having alternative therapies at least partially funded by Canada's Medical Services Plan, while 88.6% of Richmond residents want to see a "Complementary Health Therapies Center" established in their community. Among Chinese residents, 46.1% have used complementary therapies, as have 44.7% of hospital workers and 61% of employees of the Workers' Compensation Board.  <p>
Of those individuals dissatisfied with Canadian Medicare services,  78% had used alternative therapies. Among modalities, the category of vitamins and supplements was the most often used, by 37% of respondents; 30% had used chiropractic; 29% massage, 17% naturopathy, and 14% acupuncture. <p>
For those who had not accessed an alternative therapy, lack of knowledge of the therapy's benefits followed by cost considerations were the main reasons, the Richmond poll revealed. Among hospital workers, however, 24% (compared to only 8.8% among all 2,629 respondents) gave as a prime reason their lack of belief in the benefits of the therapies. <p>
"This finding is consistent with the literature," the Richmond Health Board "Information Report" summary stated. "Those involved in the provision of [conventional] medical services are less likely to explore alternative health therapies."<p>
The Information Report also summarized data on alternative medicine from other studies. A 1996 survey found that 41% of Canadians aged 55-64 and 43% of those aged 65 and older were "ready to consider" an alternative therapy. Of Ontario general practitioners, an estimated 55% to 71% regard one or more alternative therapies as "useful," but in Alberta it is 77% and in Quebec, 83%; 44% of Alberta physicians, 52% of Ontario doctors, and 77% of those in Quebec referred patients for complementary health-care services.<p>
Another survey of British Columbia residents conducted in 1995 by the Angus Reid Group indicated that 72% of those polled said they were "interested" in alternative medicine. Of these, young- to middle-aged women of lower to middle income represented the majority. The survey also found that 89% would patronize an alternative medicine clinic.<p>

<b>31% OF AMERICANS LEFT OUT IN THE COLD,<br>
Despite $1 Trillion for U.S. Health Care</b><p>
With the annual cost of U.S. health care topping $1 trillion, 31% of Americans are  still either uninsured or have difficulty in paying for medical services. In a nation that spends this much money on health care, leaving 31% of our population out in the cold is absurd, shameful, and inexcusable.<p>
Harvard University researchers polled 3,993 Americans by telephone in 1995 and found that 17 million insured and 17 million uninsured Americans alike have financial problems in receiving needed medical care; about 30 million report they have difficulty in paying their medical bills; and 45% of the uninsured and 11% of those with health insurance said they had trouble in the previous year getting the medical attention they needed. <p>
Some 70% of the uninsured rated their medical symptoms as either "somewhat serious" or "very serious" at the time when they were unable to afford adequate medical care. Of those uninsured who had problems receiving medical care, 75% rated their health status as "poor." <p>
The researchers found that only 37% of those uninsured were able to receive medical care for free, at a reduced charge, or as part of charity care. This data shattered the common assumption that the sick and indigent could always get free medical care somehow, stated study director Karen Donelan of Harvard's School of Public Health. "The sickest people surveyed are most likely to have problems getting the medical care they need." <p>
The majority (53%) of uninsured adults have difficulty in obtaining or paying for proper health care, she added. In fact, more people (44%) received calls from collection agencies over unpaid bills than received free care (37%). Among the uninsured are 9.8 million children, or about 13.8% of all U.S. children. That is the national average, but in 7 states that number exceeds 20%.<p>
The main reason (55%) given for the uninsured not having health insurance is that it is simply too expensive, the study said. One of the prime reasons for this excessive expense, in the Digest's opinion, is the government-enforced virtual monopoly of U.S. health care by conventional medicine and its rigid emphasis on expensive drugs, surgery, and high- technology interventions. <p>
Perhaps this is why in 1993 the World Health Organization (WHO) ranked the U.S. 18th among developed nations in terms of "good health." WHO noted that one of the prime reasons for this superior showing by other countries (all of whom spend less per capita for health care) is their "pluralistic approach" to health-care delivery, meaning their willingness to allow conventional and alternative therapies to thrive (and compete openly) side by side in the medical marketplace.<p>

<b>RADIATION THERAPY SPEEDS UP PROSTATE CANCER DOUBLING TIME<br>
Media Ignores Facts</b><p>
According to the Cancer Communication Newsletter, mainstream television media are dangerously misrepresenting conventional medical procedures for prostate cancer, including radiation, by not disclosing the serious side effects. <p>
Radiation therapy—implanting radiation seeds in the prostate gland—routinely given for early signs of prostate cancer can actually hasten the development of that cancer. Prostate cancer cells can double in as little as 1.2 months after radiation treatment while unradiated prostate cancer cells may take an average of 4 years to double. Similarly, it will take up to 20 years for the average untreated prostate cell to double 5 times but if treated with radiation therapy, it can double 5 times in only 6 months—40 times faster. <p>
Meanwhile, despite these facts or perhaps unaware of them, urologists send thousands of patients with suspected prostate cancer to radiation therapists every year. According to medical statistics culled from Urological Nursing, Family Urology, and other sources, and published in the Cancer Communication Newsletter, about 30-40% of men in their 50s have signs of prostate cancer, but of these, only about 8% will ever feel the effect of this disease in their lifetime, and less than 3% will die from it. <p>
Yet if a man in his 50s has an elevated prostate specific antigen (PSA, a standard prostate cancer marker) and undergoes prostate surgery, he has a 20% risk of the following scenario happening: The surgery can actually release cancer cells into the blood, and from 6 months to 5 years later, he will again have an elevated PSA, indicating cancer. <p>
Research reported in Family Urology indicates that while 50% of male radiation patients may experience a drop in their PSA, it is sustained in only 20%; this means only 10% of the total radiation patients have a sustained decline in PSA. It also means that about 90% are likely to have cancer cells that, owing to radiation, now double 40 times faster than unradiated prostate cells. <p>
The point is brought more keenly home by realizing that for the man who initially had a 92% likelihood of having no ill effects from latent prostate cancer, now, as a result of surgery or radiation treatment, is likely to become incontinent or impotent, and have to deal with a rapidly growing cancer. <p>

<b>INSURERS TO COVER ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE<br>
Cost Savings and Consumer Demand Show Insurers Why</b><p>
With annual revenues of $3 billion, Oxford Health Plans of Norwalk, Con-necticut, has set up a 1,000-practitioner provider network for alternative therapies, enabling its premium holders to consult with and be reimbursed for visits to alternative providers. The program started on a trial basis for policy holders in New York, Connecticut, and New Jersey. <p>
For an additional 3% added on to their premiums, those holding policies with Oxford may now be reimbursed for visits to chiropractors, acupuncturists, naturopaths, massage therapists, and yoga instructors, provided they are on Oxford's list of 1,000. Oxford plans to expand coverage soon to include reflexology, t'ai chi, hypnotherapy, meditation, and other body energy approaches. <p>
According to Oxford's senior vice president, David B. Snow, a survey by the company of its 1.4 million members revealed that 33% had used alternative health care in 1995. "This is not fad stuff we're talking about."<p>
Stephen Wiggins, chairman,  chief executive of Oxford, and a personal enthusiast of holistic medicine, says that strong consumer demand (as indicated by Oxford's survey) and unarguable cost savings (most alternative therapies cost less than conventional treatments) are compelling reasons to try this new approach. <p>
In fact, Wiggins believes that if an insurance company ignores consumer demand, it does so at its peril. Oxford's decision to go with alternative care reimbursement was "a recognition of the obvious trend: the demand by consumers to seek an alternative to conventional Western medical solutions."<p>
This makes Oxford the first U.S. insurance company to form a network of alternative practitioners which, incidentally, mirrors its existing network of 33,000 conventional physicians. While other insurers—American Western Life, Kaiser Permanente, Blue Cross/Blue Shield, Mutual of Omaha, Prudential—offer limited coverage of some alternative specialties, they have not established a formal holistic provider network such as Oxford's.  <p>
Why are more insurers willing to pick up the tab for alternative medicine? According to Alan Kittner of Complementary HealthCare, a consulting firm in San Francisco, California, "Insurers are beginning to cover alternative treatments in order to differentiate themselves from their competitors and appeal to this public demand." <p>
In the Digest's view, when alternative therapies are allowed to compete openly and fairly in the health-care marketplace, their ability to satisfy public demand and provide huge cost savings alone will establish them as the predominant approach to medicine. <p>
