<H1>Applications of spaceborne SAR interferometry</H1>
<P>
Abstract:
<P>
Spaceborne SAR interferometry has provided several potential applications,
both commercial and environmental, e.g. digital height maps, land
cover classified images, earthquake and volcano assessments etc.
This report deals mainly with the accuracy of the measured parameters
in SAR interferometry. A system model is described to characterise
different effects in the system. A description of error sources
is included as well as a thorough description of estimation techniques.
Coherence and phase estimates are shown to be biased under certain
conditions. Height estimates suffers from several errors, e.g.
biasing, orbital modelling and atmospheric-induced errors. Four
of the applications are covered, digital height maps, forest monitoring,
land cover classification and shore-fast sea ice monitoring together
with an error analysis of results. For example, derived digital
height maps have a RMS error of 3-5 meters in northern Sweden
but also a height bias over forested areas which is approx. less
than half the real tree height in the area. The modelling of forests
show a principle agreement with measured parameters in the images.
Weather conditions greatly influence measurements. Inversion of
measured parameters should be possible with the model and thus
a measure of forest bole volume could be obtained from the images.
Land cover classification using SAR interferometry is outlined
together with how the data could be used. However, better understanding
of how different land classes appear in the images is required.
