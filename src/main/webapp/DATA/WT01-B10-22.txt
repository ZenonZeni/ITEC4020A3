The woman's antibody level may fall to levels that will not adversely affect the sperm.
</a>
<a name=Cone"><P><DT><B>Cone Biopsy: </b><DD>A surgical procedure used to remove precancerous cells from the cervix. The procedure may damage the cervix and thus disrupt normal mucus production or cause an incompetent cervix, which may open prematurely during pregnancy.
</a>
<a name="CAH"><P><DT><B>Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia: </b><DD>A congenital condition characterized by elevated androgens which suppress the pituitary gland and interfere with spermatogenesis or ovulation. Women may have ambiguous genitalia from the excess production of male hormone.

</a>
<a name="CL"><P><DT><B>Corpus Luteum: </b><DD>The yellow-pigmented glandular structure that forms from the ovarian follicle following ovulation. The gland produces progesterone, which is responsible for preparing and supporting the uterine lining for implantation. Progesterone also causes the half-degree basal temperature elevation noted at midcycle during an ovulatory cycle. If the corpus luteum functions poorly, the uterine lining may not support a pregnancy. If the egg is fertilized, a corpus luteum of pregnancy forms to maintain the endometrial bed and support the implanted embryo. <a href="cl.jpg">Picture</a> of a corpus luteum.A deficiency in the amount of progesterone produced (or the length of time it is produced) by the corpus luteum can mean the endometrium is unable to sustain a pregnancy.

The person will suffer from high blood pressure and water retention as well as a number of other symptoms. A concurrent elevation of adrenal androgens will suppress pituitary output of LH and FSH and result in low sperm production or ovulatory failure. A woman may also develop male secondary sex characteristics, including abnormal hair growth. Cushing's Disease is another condition in which these same symptoms occur, but as the result of a pituitary tumor.
</a>
<a name="D&C"><P><DT><B>D&C (Dilation and Curettage): </b><DD>A procedure used to dilate the cervical canal and scrape out the lining and contents of the uterus. The procedure can be used to diagnose or treat the cause of abnormal bleeding and to terminate an unwanted pregnancy.
</a>
<a name=" "><P><DT><B>Danazol (danocrine): </b><DD>A medication used to treat endometriosis. Suppresses LH and FSH production by the pituitary and causes a state of amenorrhea during which the endometrial implants waste away.  Many women experience oily skin, acne, weight gain, abnormal hair growth, deepening of the voice and muscle cramps with this medication.
</a>
<a name="Delayed Ejaculation"><P><DT><B>Delayed Ejaculation: </b><DD>A condition in which the man fakes orgasm and does not actually ejaculate when having sex.
</a>
<a name="Delayaed Puberty"><P><DT><B>Delayed Puberty: </b><DD>A condition in which the youngster fails to complete puberty and
develop secondary sex characteristics by sixteen years of age. Puberty may be stimulated with hormonal replacement therapy. Some will outgrow the condition without treatment.
</a>
<a name="DES"><P><DT><B>DES (Diethylstilbestrol): </b><DD>A medication prescribed in the 1950s and 1960s to women to prevent miscarriage. Male and female fetuses exposed in utero to this drug devel-oped numerous deformities including blockage of the vas deferens, uterine abnor-malities, cervical deformities, miscarriages, and unexplained infertility. DES is no longer prescribed for this indication.

Many physicians find routine treatment with this antibiotic more cost-effective than performing multiple cultures on both the husband and wife looking for infection.
</a>
<a name="Dysmenorrhea"><P><DT><B>Dysmenorrhea: </b><DD>Painful menstruation. This may be a sign of endometriosis.
</a>
<a name="Dyspareunia"><P><DT><B>Dyspareunia: </b><DD>Painful coitus for either the man or the woman.</a>

<p><dt><b>Ectopic Pregnancy</b><dd>A pregnancy outside of the uterus, usually in the 
fallopian tube. Such a pregnancy can rarely be sustained, and often leads 
to decreased or complete loss of function in the affected tube. Methotrexate is now used to dissolve the pregnancy without causing major damage to the tube.

<P><DT><B>Egg Retrieval: </b><DD>A procedure used to obtain eggs from ovarian follicles for use in in vitro fertilization. The procedure may be performed during laparoscopy or by using a long needle and ultrasound to locate the follicle in the ovary.
<P><DT><B>Ejaculate: </b><DD>The semen and sperm expelled during ejaculation.

<p><dt><b>Embryo Transfer</b><dd>Placing an egg fertilized outside the womb into a 
woman's uterus or fallopian tube.
<P><DT><B>Empty Sella Syndrome: </b><DD>A condition that occurs when spinal fluid leaks into the bony chamber (fossa) housing the pituitary gland. The fluid pressure compresses the pituitary gland and may adversely affect its ability to secrete LH and FSH and may elevate prolactin levels.

<p><dt><b>Endometrial Biopsy</b><dd>A test to check for Luteal Phase Defect. A procedure during which a sample of the uterine lining is collected for microscopic analysis. The biopsy results will confirm ovulation and the proper preparation of the endometrium by estrogen and progesterone stimulation

<p><dt><a href="index.html#endo"><b>Endometriosis</b></a><dd>A condition where endometrial tissue is located outside the womb. The tissue may attach itself to the reproductive organs or to other organs in the abdominal cavity. Each month the endometrial tissue inbreeds with the onset of menses.

<P><DT><B>Endorphins: </b><DD>Natural narcotics manufactured in the brain to reduce sensitivity to pain and stress. May contribute to stress-related fertility problems.
<P><DT><B>Epididymis: </b><DD>A coiled, tubular organ attached to and lying on the testicle. Within this organ the developing sperm complete their maturation and develop their powerful swimming capabilities. The matured sperm leave the epididymis through the vas deferens.
<P><DT><B>Erection: </b><DD>The process during which the erectile tissue of the penis becomes engorged with blood, causing the penis to swell and become rigid.

<p><dt><b>Estradiol</b><dd>The female hormone produced in the ovary. Responsible for formation of the female secondary sex characteristics such as large breasts; supports the growth of the follicle and the development of the uterine lining. At midcycle the peak estrogen level triggers the release of 4he LH spike from the pituitary gland. The LH spike is necessary for the release of the ovum from the follicle. Fat cells in both obese men and women can also manufacture estrogen from androgens and interfere with fertility.

<p><dt><b>Estrogen</b><dd>Female sex hormone.
<P><DT><B>Expectant Therapy (Endometriosis): </b><DD>A wait-and-see approach used after laparoscopic surgery for mild endometriosis.
<p><dt><b>Fallopian Tubes</b><dd>Ducts through which eggs travel to the uterus once 
released from the follicle. Sperm normally meet the egg in the fallopian tube, the site at which fertilization usually occurs.
<P><DT><B>Female Kallman's Syndrome: </b><DD>A condition characterized by infantile sexual develop-ment and an inability to smell. Since the pituitary cannot produce LH and FSH, the woman must take hormone supplements to achieve puberty, to maintain secondary sex characteristics, and to achieve fertility.
<P><DT><B>Ferning: </b><DD>A pattern characteristic of dried cervical mucus viewed on a slide. When the fern pattern appears, the mucus has been thinned and prepared by estrogen for the passage of sperm. If it does not fern, the mucus will be hostile to the passage of the sperm.
<P><DT><B>Fertile Eunuch: </b><DD>A rare disorder characterized by an LH deficiency leading to low testosterone levels and poor sperm production. Male secondary sex characteristics will be incomplete and sex drive will be low.
<P><DT><B>Fertility Specialist: </b><DD>A physician specializing in the practice of fertility. The American Board of Obstetrics and Gynecology certifies a subspecialty for OB-GYNs who receive extra training in endocrinology (the study of hormones) and infertility.
<P><DT><B>Fertility Treatment: </b><DD>Any method or procedure used to enhance fertility or increase the likelihood of pregnancy, such as ovulation induction treatment, varicocoele repair, and microsurgery to repair damaged fallopian tubes. The goal of fertility treatment is to help couples have a child.
<P><DT><B>Fertility Workup: </b><DD>The initial medical examinations and tests performed to diagnose or narrow down the cause of fertility problems.
<P><DT><B>Fertilization: </b><DD>The combining of the genetic material carried by sperm and egg to create an embryo. Normally occurs inside the fallopian tube (in vivo) but may also occur in a petri dish (in vitro). See also In Vitro Fertilization.
<P><DT><B>Fetus: </b><DD>A term used to refer to a baby during the period of gestation between eight weeks and term.

<p><dt><A HREF="fol.jpg"><IMG ALIGN=right IMG SRC="fol.gif"></A><b>Follicles</b><dd><i>Fluid-filled sacs in the ovary which contain the eggs released at ovulation.</i>  <p><dd>Each month an egg develops inside the ovary in a fluid filled pocket called a follicle.  This follicle is one inch in size and is about ready to ovulate.
<P><DT><B>Follicular Fluid: </b><DD>The fluid inside the follicle that cushions and nourishes the ovum. When released during ovulation, the fluid stimulates the fimbria to grasp the ovary and coax the egg into the fallopian tube.
<p><dt><b>Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH)</b><dd>A pituitary hormone that stimulates spermatogenesis and follicular development. In the man FSH stimulates the Sertoli cells in the testicles and supports sperm production. In the woman FSH stimulates the growth of the ovarian follicle. Elevated FSH levels are indicative of gonadal failure in both men and woman.

<p><dt><b>Follicular Phase</b><dd>The pre-ovulatory portion of a woman's cycle during which a follicle grows and high levels of estrogen cause the lining of the uterus to proliferate.  Normally takes between 12 and 14 days.

<P><DT><B>Genitals: </b><DD>The external sex organs, as the labia and clitoris in the woman and the penis and testicles in the man. Also called genitalia.
<P><DT><B>Germ Cell: </b><DD>In the male the testicular cell that divides to produce the immature sperm cells; in the woman the ovarian cell that divides to form the egg (ovum). The male germ cell remains intact throughout the man's reproductive life; the woman uses up her germ cells at the rate of about one thousand per menstrual cycle, although usually only one egg matures each cycle.
<P><DT><B>Germ Cell Aplasia (Sertoli Cell Only): </b><DD>An inherited condition in which the testicles have no germ cells. Since men with this condition have normal Leydig cells, they will develop secondary sex characteristics. May also be caused by large and/or prolonged exposure to toxins or radiation.
<p><dt><b>Gonadotropins</b><dd>Hormones which control reproductive function: Follicle 
Stimulating Hormone and Lutenizing Hormone.
    
<p><dt><b>Gonadotropin Releasing Hormone</b> (GNRH)<dd>A substance secreted by the hypothalamus every ninety minutes or so. This hormone enables the pituitary to secrete LH and FSH, which stimulate the gonads. See also FSH; LH.
<P><DT><B>Gonad: </b><DD>The gland that makes reproductive cells and "sex" hormones, as the testicles, which make sperm and testosterone, and the ovaries, which make eggs (ova) and estrogen.
<P><DT><B>Gonorrhea: </b><DD>An infection that is usually asymptomatic, but that may cause a bad-smelling yellowish vaginal discharge and red and swollen vaginal walls. If it reaches the fallopian tubes, the woman will suffer pain, develop a high fever, and possibly develop tubal blockage. The responsible organism may also impair sperm and prevent pregnancy. In the man gonorrhea seldom leads to damage, but it may cause a painful infection.
