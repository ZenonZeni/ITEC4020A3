<P>
The RSC presence in the NT is <A HREF=/chemistry/b_salter-duke.html>
Brian Salter-Duke</A> at the Northern Territory University. Brian is 
the NT Local Representative. There are representatives in all the 
States and Territories. The national local representative is 
Professor Alan Bond at Monash University. <P>
The local representatives have two functions. 
<UL><P>
<LI> they select the annual RSC Lecturer and then organise 
the lecturer's trip to their own State or Territory. In 1995 it was
Professor Ted Baker from New Zealand. The 1996 lecture has recently
been given by Bob Cattrell.<P>
<LI> they hold some information about the RSC including membership forms
 and details of RSC Research Grants.<P>
</UL>

It is unlikely that the 1997 RSC Lecturer will visit Darwin.<P>
