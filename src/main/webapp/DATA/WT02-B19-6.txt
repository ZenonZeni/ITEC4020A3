<B>CYTRX TO MERGE ZYNAXIS WITH VAXCEL SUBSIDIARY TO CREATE PUBLIC
COMPANY WITH MULTIPLE VACCINE DELIVERY TECHNOLOGIES <BR>
</B>
<P>
<B>Atlanta, Georgia and Malvern Pennsylvania, December 6, 1996
<BR>
</B>
<P>
CytRx Corporation [NASDAQ:CYTR] and Zynaxis Inc. [NASDAQ:ZNXS]
today announced they have agreed, subject to Zynaxis shareholder
approval,  to merge Zynaxis with CytRx's Vaxcel, Inc. subsidiary
to create a new public company with multiple novel vaccine delivery
opportunities.  Paul J. Wilson, Vaxcel's current President and
CEO, will head the “new” Vaxcel which will be headquartered
in Atlanta.  Before closing, which is expected by the end of the
first quarter of 1997, CytRx will provide secured interim financing
of up to $2 million to Zynaxis, subject to certain conditions.
 After closing, Vaxcel shares are expected to publicly trade on
the NASDAQ SmallCap market.  CytRx will own approximately 87%
of Vaxcel's outstanding shares.  

<P>

“This merger is significant for both Zynaxis and Vaxcel,”
commented Jack J. Luchese, CytRx President and Chief Executive
Officer.  “It is a win-win situation, as we are establishing
a company with greater capabilities than either company alone.
 Furthermore, the Vaxcel/Zynaxis combination is a successful example
of CytRx's strategy to create wholly-owned subsidiaries around
distinct technology platforms, develop value in them, and then
take each public.  We believe this publicly traded company will
provide equity market recognition of the value in CytRx subsidiaries.”


<P>
 “This is also an ideal opportunity for Zynaxis,” added
Martyn Greenacre, Chairman and CEO of Zynaxis.  “Vaxcel specializes
in human vaccine delivery technologies.  I am confident this will
maximize the potential of our complementary technologies.”


<P>

of Vaccines<BR>

<P>
“The addition of Zynaxis technologies will round out Vaxcel's
portfolio of proprietary vaccine delivery technologies to provide
multiple opportunities for success,” noted Paul Wilson. 
“Our Optivax&reg; adjuvant is primarily focused on enhancing
the effectiveness of injectable vaccines, while the Zynaxis technologies
are primarily targeted on improving oral and mucosal vaccine delivery.
Our strategy will be to license these three technologies on a
vaccine-by-vaccine basis to companies engaged in vaccine research
and development.”

<P>
Preclinical studies using Optivax with a variety of vaccines have
demonstrated that Optivax represents a more effective way of administering
injectable vaccines.  A Phase I human clinical trial was initiated
in January 1996 to evaluate the human safety and adjuvant activity
of Optivax administered in combination with an immunotherapeutic
vaccine for patients with metastatic cancer.  Results are expected
in early 1997.

<P>
Zynaxis' PLG microspheres are a proprietary microencapsulation
technology designed to  allow for delivery of oral vaccines. In
preclinical studies, PLG encapsulated vaccines have reproducibly
induced systemic and mucosal antibody responses following oral
administration.  ALK, a world leader in allergy therapeutics,
has licensed the PLG technology for oral delivery of allergy vaccines.
 They are currently conducting a Phase II human clinical trial
in Europe.

<P>
Zynaxis' mucoadhesive polymer offers potential for oral delivery
as vaccines can be formulated with these compounds and delivered
to mucosal sites. A recent preclinical study showed the polymer
induced a stronger mucosal immune response following a single
<U>oral</U> dose of an influenza virus vaccine than the injected
vaccine. 

<P>
As part of the agreement, Zynaxis is seeking a buyer for its Cauldron
Process Chemistry division with closing expected in 1997.  Cauldron,
located in Malvern, Pennsylvania, provides process research and
development and production of bulk pharmaceutical chemicals under
Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) conditions. 

<P>
QED  Technologies of Malvern, Pa. provided advisory services to
CytRx in this transaction.

<P>
CytRx Corporation's business strategy is to build shareholder
value through the development and commercialization of high value
human therapeutic products, while capitalizing on other bio-pharmaceutical
opportunities through its unique subsidiary structure.  

<P>
Zynaxis' technology portfolio includes proprietary oral and mucosal
delivery systems to enhance the performance of vaccines.<BR>

<I><FONT SIZE=2>Certain statements, expectations and assumptions
contained in this release are forward-looking and are subject
to a number of risks and uncertainties.  Although CytRx and Zynaxis
have used their best efforts to be accurate in making those forward-looking
statements, it is possible that the assumptions made by management
may not materialize.  In addition, other important factors which
could materially affect future performance include: economic conditions
in the vaccine industries; outcomes of current and future clinical
trials; successful licensing of the technologies to vaccine development
companies; reviews by the SEC, FDA and other regulatory agencies;
and the risk factors set forth from time to time in CytRx and
Zynaxis SEC filings, copies of which are available upon request
from each company.

<TD WIDTH=582>Vaccines are medicines designed to prevent the occurrence of infectious diseases by stimulating the 
body's natural defenses -- the immune system.

<P>
Vaccines have contributed more to disease eradication than any other medical intervention.  Some of the most devastating
 human diseases such as polio, smallpox, tetanus, pertussis and measles have been significantly controlled by safe and 
effective vaccines.  

<P>
More recently, vaccines have been introduced to prevent hepatitis, bacterial meningitis and chickenpox.
<P>
<BR>
<P>
The global vaccine market is estimated at over $2 billion with sales expected to continue to grow at double-digit rates since 
vaccines are considered to be one of the most cost-effective medical tools.  

<P>
Many new vaccines are expected to be commercialized over the next decade including vaccines that hold promise in dealing 
with the growing problem of antibiotic resistance.
<P>
<BR>
<P>
Many current vaccines require multiple doses -- and physician visits -- to adequately protect individuals against disease.  
This is a costly procedure that often leads to noncompliance. There is considerable opportunity in reducing the number of 
required doses.

<P>
Also, some current vaccines are only marginally effective with patients contracting the disease even though they were 
properly immunized.  Increasing effectiveness of these vaccines to improve patient response rates offers significant benefit.

<P>
“Subunit vaccines” offer a promising approach to new vaccine development.  However many new subunit 
vaccine candidates lack the efficacy required for FDA approval.  These companies cannot succeed without enhancing 
the effectiveness of subunit vaccines.

<P>
Oral immunization has numerous advantages over injectable vaccines including ease of administration and patient 
acceptability.  New delivery vehicles will be necessary to successfully develop these oral vaccines.
