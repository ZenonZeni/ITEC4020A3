<p><font size="2"><strong>Report of the Redfern Legal Centre Drug
Law Reform Project</strong></font><strong> </strong></p>

<p><font size="2">September 1996</font> </p>

<p><font size="4"><strong>5 Comments on the Harm Reduction Model</strong></font><font
size="5"><strong> </strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2">Respondents were asked to comment in broad
terms about the desirability of controlled availability, and
about the Principles for Controlled Availability outlined in the
paper. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Responses were received from the same group
under the same conditions outlined in Chapter 3.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2"><strong>General remarks</strong></font><strong>
</strong></p>

<p><font size="2">General comments on the Model included:</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;I would argue that we need to examine
specific regulatory options in terms of their potential for harm
minimisation and, in particular, to assess the relationship
between drug-related harm and particular forms of markets and
systems of distribution. As Nicholas Dorn and Nigel South have
recently suggested in the UK context, we need to ask: 'What sort
of markets do we least dislike, and how can we adjust the control
mix so as to push markets in the least undesired (harmful)
direction.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Some of the specific goals proposed for
rational drug policy have still to be tested. The means of
implementing controls on age, advertising and marketing, and
adequate knowledge about safe use are unknown. There should
certainly be a framework of treatment for drug related problems.
The prescription system is untested, as is the assessment
process.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;I wish to endorse (the Model's) contents,
especially the point that prohibition has had no positive
results. I am not competent to suggest any amendments except to
add that I was a registered nurse for about thirty-five
years.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Unfortunately, the (Model) goes much
further than the harm minimisation principles of the National
Drug Strategy, to the point of having few controls on
availability at all.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;In general, harm reduction strategies
presuppose the impossibility of addressing the undesirable
behaviour and hence direct attention to the consequences. What is
not clear, in my mind, is how we define the I undesirable
behaviour' with which we are dealing. In other words, is drug use
a cause or result of other social or behavioural problems?&quot;</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2"><strong>Controlled availability</strong></font><strong>
</strong></p>

<p><font size="2">Should we adopt a &quot;controlled
availability&quot; approach in the long term as the best policy
direction for currently illicit drugs?</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Fourteen were in favour of the concept of
controlled availability as outlined in the paper, six were
against.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Comments:</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Supported, because it's sensible.&quot;</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;(Controlled availability) is needed as
the next step in harm minimisation.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;We need education about drug effects, and
research too. Controlled availability provides a means both of
generating data and of informing users.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Sends the wrong message to young
people.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Supported, provided that: it is
researched for each drug group research is open and rigorous only
move to next group if research is favourable&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Controlled availability as defined seems
more like 'uncontrolled availability' when over-the-counter
options are included. All drugs with a medical purpose that can
help people with an addiction problem should be available on
prescription, but not over-the-counter.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Can't answer for all drugs at this stage.
Support idea for cannabis.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;I am unconvinced as to the merits of a
'blanket' approach to controlled availability. More convinced as
to the merits of controlled availability of cannabis, perhaps
ecstasy, and favour prescribing system for heroin.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2"><strong>Internal consistency</strong></font><strong>
</strong></p>

<p><font size="2">Is the Harm Reduction Model of Controlled Drug
Availability internally coherent? For example, are the principles
consistent with the stated goals?</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Seventeen said yes, four said no.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Comments:</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Good effort in putting all this together
... the way you've done it contains a lot of common sense.&quot;</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;I don't think the mechanisms of
controlled availability have been spelt out in enough detail to
make a judgment about harm minimisation for all drugs.&quot;</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;They're the best considered proposals
I've yet seen coming from an Australian source ... May these
proposals enjoy wide readership.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Raises all the right questions which need
to be addressed. The current system needs to be challenged.&quot;
</font></p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;The document could be strengthened by
describing the pros and cons of each method of delivery (Eg,
prescription and over the counter).&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2"><strong>Principles</strong></font><strong> </strong></p>

<p><font size="2">Do you broadly support the Principles of
Controlled Availability set out in the Harm Reduction Model of
rug Availability? </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Eighteen were in favour, five were opposed.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">Comments:</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;The closest to the mark we've seen so
far.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;It is this kind of extremism that offers
opponents of harm minimisation strategies a platform from which
to jump.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;You should be congratulated for doing the
exercise. By being specific about details, you give everybody a
chance to tear it apart. But that is positive.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;We congratulate the Drug Law Reform
Project on the production of such a positive and practical Model,
one that if fully and successfully implemented by governments and
other decision makers, would most certainly contribute to a
substantial reduction of hepatitis C transmission. We look
forward to hearing of progress on its implementation.&quot;</font>
