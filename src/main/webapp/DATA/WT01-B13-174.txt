Concerns about rising interest rates, the
possibility of higher price inflation and Federal Reserve tightening
of credit continue to contribute to considerable market volatility. But while
the professional investors  tend to debate every economic release,
individuals who invest in mutual funds for the long term have been
wise to stay the course. Indeed, several recent economic measures
are quite reassuring and argue in favor of a continued healthy
economy with low inflation.
<P>
The economy expanded at a 4.2% annual rate in the second quarter,
the fastest pace since the second quarter of 1994. This robust
growth is welcome in general but has tended to roil markets, which
fear strong growth will lead to overheating and inflationary pressures.
So far, however, such fears have been largely unwarranted. With
the exception of food prices, whose increases were weather-related,
there have been no significant signs of inflationary pressures.
As it has so often recently, the economy is in the process of
slowing itself down. While the Federal Reserve Board stands by
ready to attempt to moderate economic growth with either interest
rate cuts or increases, such intervention can run the risk of
going too far in one direction. It appears that our economy today
is self-regulating.
<P>
Based on these snapshots of the economy, then, we look for a relatively
calmer remainder of the year. Our forecast calls for growth to slow
down in the fourth quarter, to result in an advance
of about 2.5% for the entire year. Assuming that bond and stock
market investors concur that there is no chance of an overheating
economy or significantly rising interest rates, the markets should
relax, as well. 
<P>
Our market forecast 10 months into the year is not much different
from what we forecasted in January. The bond market, which is
climbing back from a decline this year, may produce a 5% total
return in 1996. The stock market, after the correction is completed,
may advance 10% to 15% for the year. Naturally, future market conditions
cannot be predicted with assurance.
<P>
In addition, we are projecting that long-term (30-year) interest
rates will hover in the 6.5% to 7.0% range. Short-term interest
rates may drop below their current levels. Finally, we would be
surprised if the Federal Reserve Board moved to adjust interest
rates either way more than 25 basis points for the remainder of
the year.
<P>
Given the economic environment, we do not look for an upset in
the upcoming presidential election. Much more interesting will
be which party wins the most congressional seats. If the Democrats
regain control of Congress, a bond market selloff could be expected.
<P>
While U.S. markets are expected to provide modest returns, we
continue to advocate the benefits of diversification into alternate
markets. Many overseas markets are forecasted to grow at a rate
well above our 2.5% growth expectation for the U.S., and there
are many equity and fixed-income opportunities abroad. The value
of the U.S. dollar, always a concern to international investors,
will probably not strengthen much against other currencies for
the foreseeable future.
<P>
Thank you for your continued support. We appreciate the opportunity to serve your investment
needs.
