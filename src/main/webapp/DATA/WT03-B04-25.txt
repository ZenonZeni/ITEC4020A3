GETTING CYPRUS-REGISTERED SHIPS TO TOE THE LINE

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

The European Union is leaning on the Republic of Cyprus, which boasts the
world's fourth biggest merchant shipping fleet, to align its shipping
policy with the EU's, before joining the European Union. On a visit to
Cyprus on October 18, Neil Kinnock, European Commissioner for Transport,
stressed that what the EU mainly had in mind were standards for shipping
safety and the flags of convenience policy, making it easy for foreign
ships to register in Cyprus. "This is of particular importance for us,
given the size of the Cypriot fleet, which is currently the world's fourth
largest fleet and expanding rapidly, and because of the large number of
vessels which belong to EU companies yet fly the Cypriot flag", according
to Mr Kinnock, who was in Nicosia to take part in a conference of European
maritime experts. The Commissioner claims that because of Cyprus'
potential EU membership (a matter that will be considered in 1998), the
Commission is obliged to ensure high safety standards at sea as well as
fair competition in the merchant shipping industry. Mr Kinnock was thus
making a veiled criticism of the country's lax attitude to ship
registration.

The tonnage of the Cypriot merchant fleet totalled 38.3 million in 1994,
but nearly 80% of the Cyprus-registered tonnage was over 15 years of age.
By way of comparison, 45% of Liberia's fleet, the biggest in the world, is
less than five years old.

STOP PRESS: HUMANITARIAN AID MUST GET THROUGH IN ZAIRE, BONINO SAYS

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

Humanitarian Aid Commissioner Emma Bonino launched an urgent appeal on
October 25 to the groups fighting around the border region of Zaire and
Rwanda to let humanitarian aid through to the 1.2 million refugees
affected by the crisis, and said the international community had to make
it clear to those launching the attacks that a new genocide in the region
will not be tolerated. She also criticised the functioning of the EU's
foreign and security policy, saying that it was not able to effectively
seek solutions to the problem, and pleaded for an acceleration in the
procedures needed to release emergency budgetary reserves in response to
the crisis.

The refugees have been grouped mainly in camps around the cities of Goma,
Bukavu and Uvira in eastern Zaire. Following the outbreak of the fighting
between the Zairean army and Tutsi Banyamulenge rebels, all of the 190,000
people in the 12 camps around Uvira have fled and, along with tens of
thousands of the Zairean population, are taking to the hills in Zaire or
on their way to Bukavu. Painting a bleak picture, Commissioner Bonino said
the rebels - which she says seem to be following an organised plan to
destabilise the Hutu refugee camps - are also advancing toward Bukavu,
causing thousands to begin to flee camps in that area.

While food stocks for several weeks exist around Bukavu and the European
Community Humanitarian Office and other bodies are preparing to establish
other emergency measures, such as food drops, the resources will be put
under considerable stress if most of the refugees from Uvira reach the
camps. However, even this is uncertain, the Commissioner said, because
access to camps around Bukavu and Goma are being blocked by the army or
the rebels, and humanitarian workers are unable to reach them.

EU/MEDITERRANEAN STATES: INTERMEDIATE REPORT ON MEDA ACTIONS

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

Of the ECU 4.685 billion in EU subsidies earmarked for the
Euro-Mediterranean partnership for the period 1995-99, ECU 414 million had
been allocated by October 1, 1996 to bilateral actions and projects, and
ECU 30 million to regional activities and projects. These figures are
contained in an interim report published by the European Commission on
October 24. Euro-Mediterranean funding for regional projects and
activities extends to five areas: Barcelona process projects, economic
cooperation, decentralised cooperation programmes, information technology
and media projects, and projects concerning cultural heritage, as well as
to the MEDA Democracy programme.

Economic cooperation.

ECU 20 million has been granted this year to the MEDSTAT regional
cooperation project involving Eurostat (the Statistical Office of the
European Communities), and the statistics institutes of the twelve
Mediterranean partners and the fifteen EU Member States. Subsidies have
also been granted to events aimed at nurturing business contracts between
small and medium-sized enterprises in Mediterranean third countries and
the EU: "Med Interprise Bethlehem" (February 1996), "Med Interprise Cairo"
(May 1996), "Med Interprise Algeria" (scheduled for December 1996) and at
involving Mediterranean countries in the Europartnership events in Lulea
(June 1996) and Genoa (November 1996). A frame-work contract has been
drawn up to cover the short term hiring of experts for the preparation of
economic cooperation projects (ECU 2 million)

Decentralised cooperation.

ECU 37 million has been granted to the "Med Campus" (cooperation between
universities), "Med Urbs" (cooperation between local authorities), and
"Med Media" (media cooperation) programmes. A further programme, "Med
Techno", involved with technological cooperation will be launched shortly.

Culture and media.

Following the Euro-Mediterranean Conference of Ministers of Culture in
Bologna in April 1996, and the meeting of experts on cultural heritage in
Brussels in September (both meetings were financed under the "Barcelona
process"), a initial list of 14 joint projects is being drawn up for
financing in 1996 or the beginning of 1997. Funding granted to these
projects will depend on fine details, notably the number of countries
participating in each project. In addition, two training projects have
been provisionally financed under the Med Media programme, and a subsidy
granted for the dissemination of information on the Euro-Mediterranean
Partnership through Maghreb radio station Medi 1 (set up in the Moroccan
city of Tangiers).

Democracy.

Financed through a separate MEDA budget line, implementation of the MEDA
Democracy programme began in 1996 with subsidies totalling more than ECU 6
million granted to 32 projects.

Miscellaneous.

Other activities benefiting from regional funding through MEDA include:
support for the REDWG Secretariat (Regional Economic Development Working
Group, chaired by the European Union) in Amman (ECU 400,000), the
Euro-Arab Management School in Granada (ECU 400,000), and "micro-actions"
(ECU 1.8 million). A total of ECU 1.7 million has been granted over 1996
to the preparation and organisation of sectoral meetings at Ministerial
level and among experts in the following fields: culture, the information
society, energy, small and medium sized enterprises, investment, cultural
heritage, shipping, water management, foreign policy institutes and the
instruction of diplomats.

MEPS CRITICISE BP ROLE IN COLOMBIAN HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

The European Parliament criticised human rights abuses in Colombia on
October 24 and asked that an unpublished Government Human Rights
Commission report on the activities of British Petroleum, which MEPs
accused during a debate of complicity in human rights abuses and
environmental damage in the Casanare region, be made public. In a
Resolution, the Parliament calls on all European oil companies to "observe
the highest standards of respect for human rights and environmental
protection, especially given the conditions of conflict in which they are
working". Backed by 127 to 62 with 7 abstentions and supported by Members
from most of the Parliament's major political groups, the Resolution says
a new dialogue should be established between the oil companies and the
community in Casanare to broker support for a new social and economic
development plan for the region.

British Socialist MEP Richard Howitt, a member of the Parliament's South
American delegation, accused BP during the debate earlier that day of
collaborating with the military in the region, saying these allegations
are backed by the Human Rights Commission report. "The report makes
accusations of the passing of secret video evidence to the military
leading to the death and disappearances of anti-oil protesters, and
suggests that military denunciations against the protesters lead to
assassinations", he said.

BP "rejects these charges completely", according to a company spokesman.
The British oil group applies the same human rights standards in Colombia
as it does in other countries, he said, and "would never ask the Colombian
military to break up a strike". BP also questions whether the report is
actually preliminary testimonies into oil industry activities in general
in two Colombian regions rather than a report on BP activities in
particular.

In its Resolution, the Parliament "condemns unreservedly all human rights
abuses committed in Colombia" by the security forces or paramilitary or
guerrilla groups. It also finds fault with the Government, calling on it
to guarantee rather than restrict press freedom in the country, to stop
the use by the army of extrajudicial and arbitrary killings, torture and
other human rights violations, to cooperate with the Colombian
Attorney-General's office in its efforts to arrest those involved in
extrajudicial killings and to continue its efforts to counter
drug-trafficking.

EU/SLOVENIA: PARLIAMENT PRESSES EU STATES TO RATIFY ASSOCIATION AGREEMENT

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

Meeting in plenary session in Strasbourg on October 23, the European
Parliament adopted reports by Bernd Posselt (EPP, Germany) on the economic
and commercial aspects of the Association Agreement between the European
Union and the Republic of Slovenia, and Ulpu Iivari (PES, Finland), on the
political aspects of this agreement, sending a clear message to Member
States to ratify the Association Agreement without delay. The Parliament
is delighted that Slovenia lodged a request for accession to the European
Union on June 10, and will therefore be placed among the vanguard of
candidates for the next enlargement.

Rapporteur for the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Mrs Iivari observed that
adoption of an Association Agreement between the Union and Slovenia has
been a long drawn-out process. Negotiations began on March 15, 1995, with
the Agreement signed more than a year later on June 10, 1996. Negotiations
became bogged down on the fact that - historically - a part of Italy was
annexed by the former Yugoslavia. Rome insisted that Italian nationals
forced to leave Yugoslavia in the 1950s should be granted the right to
recover what real estate they abandoned. However, Slovenian legislation
and constitutional law prohibits foreigners from owning real estate. The
two parties have now settled on a compromise whereby Slovenia has agreed
to guarantee all EU citizens the right to acquire real estate from the
fourth year after the entry into force of the Agreement. In addition, EU
citizens who have resided for at least three years on Slovenian territory
(the case of Italians) will see their rights to acquire real estate
recognised from the entry into force of the Agreement.

In her report, Mrs Iivari explains that the general situation in Slovenia
is encouraging: per capita income stands at USUSD9,000 a year, and
Slovenia already meets a number of the Maastricht criteria set for
Economic and Monetary Union. The text urges the Slovenian Government to
pursue privatisation and the European Commission to provide financial
backing for redevelopment projects and encourage economic and cultural
cooperation. In his speech to the Parliament, EU External Relations
Commissioner Hans van de Broek called on the Member States' national
Parliaments to ratify the Association Agreement with Slovenia as quickly
as possible. Slovenia itself will need to amend its Constitution as regard
the acquisition of real estate, overhaul administrative structures, and
consolidate economic reforms.

Encouraging the Slovenian Government to pursue the privatisation process,
Bernd Posselt's report invites the European Commission to offer financial
support to border regions between Slovenia and the EU for redevelopment
projects to counteract the disappearance of traditional border activities,
and to encourage economic and cultural cooperation. Member States are also
urged to provide long-term backing for major infrastructure projects in
Slovenia and to include these projects in European planning for
trans-European transport networks. Finally, the report urges Slovenia to
further improve protection for minority groups.

Slovenia on the right road to EU membership.

On the eve of the European Parliament's vote, the head of the Parliament's
delegation for relations with Slovenia, Michel Ebner (EPP, Italy), said at
the end of a two-day meeting in Ljubljana that Slovenia was proceeding on
schedule for meeting the preconditions for EU membership. The encounter
was held in the context of high-level meetings with senior political
figures, including Josef Skolc, President of Slovenia's parliament, Janez
Drnovsek, Prime Minister, and Davorin Kracun, Foreign Minister. The
impression given during the meeting was that all parties what ever their
stripe were much in favour of closer ties with Europe.

The European Parliament's delegation judges that in order to ensure the
continuing possibility of early EU membership, Slovenia would have to take
steps to complete its own ratification procedure as soon as possible after
the November 10 elections. Other subjects raised at the meeting include
the EU's Inter-governmental Conference on the Maastricht Treaty reform and
the application of the PHARE programme of aid for economic reforms in
Eastern Europe, as well as a number of economic and environmental issues.
Privatisation was considered with Mr De Prikmajer, State Secretary at the
Ministry for Economic Relations and Development. The officials also mooted
the situation in Bosnia after the September 14 elections, and welcomed the
positive role that Slovenia is being called upon to play in the region.

PARLIAMENT CALLS FOR COMPLETE EU EMBARGO ON BURMA

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

The European Parliament said on October 23 that the EU should implement
economic sanctions against Burma (Myanmar) in an attempt to pressure its
military rulers, the State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC), to
end widespread human rights violations. On the same day as Burma announced
that it had detained Kyi Maung, a top advisor to Nobel Peace Prize
laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, the Parliament condemned in a Resolution "the
violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms being perpetrated
against the Burmese people".

It called in particular for the Council to "end all links between the
European Union and Burma based on trade, tourism and investment in Burma
by European companies" when it meets on October 28-29, and for the
Commission to present without delay the conclusions of its present inquiry
into withdrawing Generalised System of Preferences trade concessions from
Burma. The withdrawal of GSP, which would cost Burma tens of millions of
Dollars, is the only immediate step which may be taken to put effective
pressure on the SLORC, the Parliament said.

Meeting in plenary session in Strasbourg, the MEPs took particular aim at
foreign companies active in Burma. It expressed concern that investment in
Burma by UNOCAL and French oil group Total has caused significant
violations of human rights and indirectly led to forced relocation and
labour, and welcomed the decisions by 15 international companies to stop
investing in the country. International pressure should also be brought to
bear on the country through the United Nations, says the Resolution. The
Parliament called on the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN)
to refuse Burma's application for membership until the SLORC has stepped
down from power, warning that "Burma's full membership would harm
relations between the EU and ASEAN".

EU/US: COMMISSION TRIES TO WRING DANISH SUPPORT FOR CUBA MEASURE

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

The threat of a Danish veto on the European Union's common response to the
United States' anti-Cuba laws has sent European Commission and EU Council
of Ministers officials into a frenzy as they seek to persuade the errant
Member State of the merits of their proposal. The Commission has also used
the deadlock as an argument for ending the use of a veto in EU foreign
policy.

The EU's Foreign Ministers will be meeting in Luxembourg on October 28 for
their Council and the Commission wants the common response agreed against
the so-called Helms-Burton law, by which the United States hopes to punish
companies doing business with Cuba. But Denmark appears determined to
resist the move, insisting it is not against a response as such, rather
against the legal means by which the Commission is proposing to push
through the measure. "Our position is firm and our Government clearly
indicated this in two meetings of COREPER", a Danish official said.

In fact, Denmark actually supports EU arguments against Helms-Burton, and
claims its caution is based on a potential threat to EU Members State
sovereignty thanks to the rarely-used Article 235 of the EU Treaty. The
retaliatory measures will be taken under this Article which states that
the Council has the power to act on issues not specified in other areas of
the Treaty, but can only do so by unanimity. It says: "If action by the
Community should prove necessary to attain, in the course of the operation
of the common market, one of the objectives of the Community and this
Treaty has not provided the necessary powers, the Council shall, acting
unanimously on a proposal from the Commission and after consulting the
European Parliament, take appropriate measures".

Denmark says it has held misgivings about Article 235 ever since joining
the European Community in 1973, as it clashed with Article 20 of the
Danish Constitution which says the Government cannot give away too much
sovereignty. "Denmark is not against the European Union taking
precautionary measures against the USA. It's just that we cannot accept
the use of Article 235", Foreign Minister Niels Helveg Petersen said. "I
know that others are trying to find an alternative basis on which to
proceed."

Some officials in Brussels suspect Denmark's reticence on ceding authority
to the Commission is linked to a pending court case in Copenhagen on the
issue of sovereignty. A group of 11 citizens recently filed a suit
claiming the Danish Government's signature of the Maastricht Treaty on
European Union contravened the country's Constitution by transferring too
much political and judicial authority to supranational institutions. And
the sensitivity over sovereignty can also be traced to Denmark's two
referendums on the Maastricht Treaty. The Danish Government only secured
approval for the Treaty during the second referendum, in 1993, after
renegotiating Denmark's position so there could be an option on the final
stage of Economic and Monetary Union and other EU measures potentially
threatening to national sovereignty.

The European Commission discussed the problem during its weekly meeting on
October 22, and the Commission President Jacques Santer said it proved how
important it was for the EU to speak with one voice on such matters. "This
is a very concrete example which shows that we have to take decisions
quickly without unanimity", Mr Santer's spokesman said. "What is important
is that the Union establishes a joint action as soon as possible as we
risk losing our credibility on the international stage."

As for finding a way around the problem, officials appear to be looking at
all the available means within the EU's legal instruments to placate the
Danes. "We are not being dogmatic about it and we are not fixated with
Article 235", said one official. "But we have gone through the Treaty with
a fine tooth comb and we believe the combination of articles we are using
is the best."

EU AND EGYPT STRIVE TO REVIVE TALKS

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

The Middle East process, trade relations, Association Agreement talks,
financial cooperation and regional cooperation - these are just a sample
of the key themes due to be discussed, on October 28 in Luxembourg by EU
and Egyptian Foreign Ministers. Gathered for a Cooperation Council
meeting, the two sides are likely to focus on problems that have succeeded
in stalling the Association Agreement negotiations for several months now.
The European side believes the concessions being sought by the Egyptians,
mainly concerning farm trade, are excessive and do not reflect the real
level of trade between the two sides. Egypt wants the right to be able to
enjoy zero or reduced-rated duties for products for which they are not
traditional exporters to the EU market. (potatoes, for example). They also
want the export quota system to take account of reference years Egypt
considers are most in the country's favour. These demands are not accepted
by the European Commission or the EU Member States, who are fearful of
seeing their own producers having to compete with farm produce from Egypt.

The two sides will also be taking stock of EU financial assistance for
Egypt. Under the new MEDA financial programme for non-EU Mediterranean
countries, Egypt is slated to receive ECU 275 million for 1996. 155
million will be channelled into the Social Development Fund, 100 million
into the basic education sector and 20 million into environment causes.

EU/PALESTINE: LEON BRITTAN AND PARIS SPAT OVER PEACE PROCESS

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

France is somewhat miffed over a statement that Leon Brittan European
Commissioner for External Economic Relations, made on October 24 to the
effect that the conditions are not ripe for the EU to take part in the
Middle East peace process. Why? Because the Member States are unable to
work together. He also called on the major EU countries to refrain from
taking any independent addiction in this sphere. Sir Leon was making a
veiled allusion to the role Paris wants France and the EU to play in the
Near East. Catherine Colonna, spokeswoman for the French President, said
that the Commission's words were singularly lacking in relevance. They are
not the sort of things one expects to hear from the European Commission
nor do they reflect reality, she stressed, adding that the Commission has
no powers in common foreign policy matters. Elsewhere, the Commission has
signed a three-year agreement with the UNRWA involving ECU 130 million.

On a visit to the Middle East from October 20 to 26, President Jacques
Chirac made a call for Europe to become a joint sponsor of the peace
process. The US and Russia have been the two sponsors since the peace
process got under way in October 1991 in Madrid. Sir Leon Brittan judged
that the conditions are not ripe for EU involvement. "If we succeed in
working together and we refrain from any independent action, we will then
be able to work with the US in the region. Otherwise we will not succeed
in this endeavour", he implied.

Ms Colonna stresses that policy positions on the Middle East were being
taken regularly at the highest level of the EU and that Europe is
increasingly present and active in this area via its Member States and
collectively. She recalled that before his trip to the Middle East, Mr
Chirac took care to inform his partners that he would be reporting back to
them as soon as he got home.

Aid for Palestinian refugees.

The EU is to provide the hefty sum of ECU 106 million over three years for
the UN refugees welfare Agency. UNWRA's General Commissioner, Peter Hansen
says the 4.5% increase in aid (in comparison with last year's
contribution) would help cover18% of his organisation's Budget. The EU is
the second biggest contributor to the UNWRA Budget after the US, but the
first if donations from each Member States are taken into account. The
money is used for programmes relating to food, education and health for
the 3.3 million Palestinian refugees in Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, the West
Bank and Gaza.

Mr Hansen says the EU aid has arrived just at the right moment, because
the UNWRA Budget is running a 15% deficit and was on the verge of having
to stop making payments. The General Commissioner is planning to make a
tour of the Arab countries to ask them to boost their contributions
(currently accounting for only 1% of the Budget). As for Israel, he is
simply asking the authorities there to facilitate the efforts being made
to deliver aid.

The aid for UNWRA is quite separate from that awarded to the Palestinian
Authority. The EU is also funding other projects such as one for a major
Palestine hospital due to open next year, for which the EU has paid ECU 20
million.

Gaza port.

During his visit to Palestine, President Chirac announced on October 23
his decision to revive the Palestinian shipping port project for Gaza.
Sponsored by the Netherlands and France, the project is supposed to result
in the port being able to handle more than one million tonnes of cargo
annually in six years' time. Mr Chirac visited the site during his visit
to the Gaza Strip. A USD1.5 million contract was signed to allow French
engineers to press on with the preparations and to help with construction
immediately after an Israeli/Palestinian agreement along these lines. "The
construction of a port in the Gaza Strip, that France has decided to fund,
together with its European partners, is an economic and political
necessity", according to Mr Chirac.

A first feasibility study, initiated with the support of Israel by the
Dutch firm Grabowsky and Poorts, was conducted by Tel Aviv University in
1990/91. The autonomy agreements signed by Israel and the PLO have, in the
meantime, conferred on the Palestinian Authority the right to its own
port. The Israelis and Palestinian have agreed upon a negotiating system
specifying their mutual approval for each of the three project phases:
studies, construction and port operations. The port exists only on paper
for the moment, but the Palestinian President, Yasser Arafat, symbolically
laid the first stone last January 18 in the company of the Dutch Prime
Minister, Wim Kok. The cost of building the Gaza port is put at USD71
million, with the Netherlands supplying FF 23 million, France 19 million
and the EU (via the European Investment Bank) 29 million.

EU/LEBANON ASSOCIATION AGREEMENT LOOMING UP

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

Lebanon and the European Union are likely to be in a position to sign a
partnership deal before the end of the year, a European official hinted on
October 22 in Beruit. Major progress had been made in the talks, according
to Bernard Philippe, a senior European Commission official in charge of
negotiating with Lebanon. At the end of a meeting with Zafer al-Hassan, a
high-level official from the Lebanese Ministry for Foreign Affairs, Mr
Philippe stressed that more talks were needed for farming, emigration and
services. Without mentioning any exact date, the EU's negotiator in Beruit
expressed confidence about a deal being struck between the two sides
before the end of the year. The talks on establishing an economic, social
and cultural partnership got under way in 1995.

EIB loan to Lebanon.

The European Investment Bank announced on October 24 an ECU 50 million
loan to Lebanon to pay for projects to combat water pollution. The loan
agreement was signed by Ariane Obolensky, Vice-Chairman of the EIB, and
Nabil Jisr, head of a Government-sponsored development and reconstruction
organisation. Carrying a 3% rate of interest, the loan forms part of
overall aid of ECU 130 million from the Lebanese Government, the World
Bank and a Japanese fund awarding money for schemes to clean up Lebanese
coastal cities. The EIB has awarded loans to the tune of ECU 300 million
for Lebanese reconstruction projects launched since the end of the
1975-1990 civil war.

EU/BULGARIA: "CONSTRUCTIVE" TECHNICAL MEETING WITH BULGARIA

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

Despite the recent problems in Bulgaria (see European Report N   2064),
there was a conciliatory tone to the second meeting of the Association
Council, held in Brussels on October 22. Implementation of Bulgaria's
Europe Agreement is "progressing according to schedule", delegates agreed,
and the EU side - headed by Sipke Brouwer, Director for relations with
Central and East Europe in the European Commission's External Political
Relations Directorate-General, DG IA - welcomed the recent economic
stabilisation and restructuring programme from the Government, and
expressed hope that it would help sustainable long-term development.

Bulgaria's application to join the EU, its accession to the World Trade
Organisation, and its adoption of a national strategy to respond to the
1995 White Paper on rules for the Internal Market were all welcomed (and
Bulgaria also reported on its work to set up a special framework agreement
with the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development). There was
also recognition of Bulgaria's efforts at developing regional cooperation,
especially via the Sofia Ministerial meeting in July. Moreover, Bulgaria's
plans for enterprise and financial sector restructuring and for cash
privatisation were judged appropriate for "substantial" assistance from
the EU-coordinated PHARE programme for economic reform. The EU
acknowledged the "important steps" taken towards "economically viable"
electricity prices as a crucial aspect of energy reform.

But it was made clear that any further EU macro-financial support would be
given only if Bulgaria brings the IMF-agreed macro-economic and structural
reform programme back on track. There is a need for more agricultural
reform, too, the EU side pointed out firmly, with emphasis on new rules on
land ownership and market liberalisation. Bulgaria's recent request for
food aid to overcome a short-term cereal supply imbalance will be assessed
in the light of how many concrete steps Bulgaria shows it is ready to make
in that direction - particularly since the EU has already agreed to
facilitate planting by private farmers for the 1997 harvest.

During the meeting - where the Bulgarian delegation was led by Emil Valev,
Director of European Integration, and Peter Stefanov, the Deputy Minister
of Trade - most of the outstanding trade issues were resolved, but there
remains much to be done to meet Bulgaria's desire for greater freedom of
movement for workers. The EU also stressed the need to keep to schedule
for bringing in - and for giving real effect to - legislative
approximation, particularly in respect of competition, certification and
standards. Another urgent need, the EU side said, is for a civil service
law to promote a stable and professional public administration. And on the
sore point of visas, the current aim is to develop PHARE programmes that
will "create the conditions for a reconsideration by the EU of its visa
policy".

EU/EAST EUROPE: EU LOOKS AT ADMINISTRATIVE COOPERATION WITH CEECS

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

The pre-accession process for the countries of Central and Eastern Europe
(CEECs) is not only delivering a plethora of headlines on the political
relations between the EU and its candidates. It is also bringing these
countries ever closer to EU operating methods, through a series of less
spectacular but nevertheless influential mechanisms. The meeting of EU and
CEEC Internal Market Ministers in Luxembourg on October 25 was scheduled
to look at one of the latest moves in these "back office" developments -
what goes under the prosaic title of administrative cooperation. What it
comes down to is trying to ensure that all the CEEC rule changes result in
new conditions on the ground as well as in their statute books, so that a
genuine Single Market will be brought into being with enlargement.

Administrative cooperation has already been a permanent feature of
relations between existing EU Member States for years - based on the
knowledge that no Single Market will work at all in practice without
constant common efforts to avert problems and prevent the emergence of
latent protectionism masquerading as national safeguard measures. Between
Member States, regular meetings of officials at all levels and across all
Internal Market sectors has made it possible to deal with potential
problems early, before they become serious obstacles to free movement -
and at the same time mutual confidence has been built.

These existing mechanisms within the EU include the system of prior
notification of new national measures of a technical nature (set up by
Directive 83/189) and the related procedures for assessing derogations
from rules on free movement of goods, which will come into effect from the
beginning of 1997 (under Decision 3052/95), and a new procedure for
ensuring transparency of technical standards in the framework of the
information society. They also include networks created, in line with a
number of Council Resolutions over the last two years, to establish
national contact points and information on national administrative
structures - aimed both at increasing cooperation between Member States
and at helping companies to understand their rights for cross-border
operation in the Single Market. And they include the programmes such as
Karolus, Mattheus and Mattheus Tax for exchanges between Member States of
officials working in customs and taxation.

When CEECs join the EU, their officials too will have to play an active
part in these networks. To start preparations for that time - and
particularly since few East European officials have much experience of
many of the market economy mechanisms which are at the heart of a Single
European Market - the European Commission has made a number of specific
suggestions. Bringing CEEC officials progressively into the loop will get
them ready to work fully with their new colleagues after accession, and
will in the meantime also provide them with a lot of technical help in
resolving some of the problems that their own national legislative
adaptations are presenting.

Already the TAIEX office in Brussels provides the CEECs with technical
assistance and access to expertise - including short visits, contacts with
EU Member State experts, and seminars. The Commission is also suggesting
setting up some ad hoc groups of EU and CEEC officials and experts in
specific domains - such as DG XVII is now doing for gas, where each Member
State has been asked to nominate one official and one industry expert. And
it recommends that specific meetings - such as DG XVII (again) organised
on energy matters at Director-General level in March - can be helpful.
What the Commission is seeking from all the Internal Market Ministers is
guidance on what they would themselves find most useful.

Treading carefully.

The Commission is conscious of the need for caution in such a process.
Some of the EU mechanisms for administrative cooperation also have a
decision-making (and sometimes even a legislative) role, and it would not
be appropriate for officials from non-Member States to take part, even as
observers - and there was some initial resistance from Member States to
the idea of premature cooperation. But the Commission, in its 1995 White
Paper on integrating the East Europeans into the Internal Market, already
announced its intention of suggesting some methods in which CEEC officials
might gain a better understanding of the operation of the Single Market.
Prior to the Council, Presidency sources downplayed the significance of
Member State resistance, suggesting it was based on a misunderstanding
that exaggerated the size and speed of the steps now under discussion.

EU/ZAIRE/RWANDA: EU REAFFIRMS SUPPORT FOR POLITICAL SOLUTION TO CONFLICT

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

EU Development Commissioner Jo_o de Deus Pinheiro and members of the
Council's Africa Working group have thrown their support behind new
efforts to calm tensions at the border between Zaire and Rwanda that
observers fear could escalate into an all-out conflict. They met on
October 23 with Aldo Ajello, European Union envoy to the Great Lakes
region, following recent fighting between Zairean Government troops and a
Tutsi community near the frontier and a mass exodus of refugees in the
area.

EU representatives gave the envoy a mandate to proceed with attempts to
bring about a meeting as soon as possible between the Prime Ministers of
Zaire and Rwanda to defuse the situation. "A meeting was initially
scheduled for early November. All efforts possible should be deployed to
ensure it takes place despite the incidents that have taken place these
last few days in South Kivu in eastern Zaire", the Commissioner said after
his meeting with Mr Ajello. The special envoy also met Commissioner Emma
Bonino to discuss humanitarian aid. A crisis unit, set up within the
European Community Humanitarian Office (ECHO), will be responsible for
following the situation and deciding whether to activate any emergency
measures.

In a statement published on behalf of the EU on October 21, the Council
Presidency "urged all parties to exercise restraint and to ensure the
prevention of open conflict across the border between Zaire and Rwanda".
The EU statement, which was backed by the associated Central and Eastern
European countries, Cyprus and Malta, also supported the efforts of the
United Nations Special Representative, Ibrahima Fall, to seek a peaceful
resolution.

EU/CENTRAL AMERICA: EU PROJECTS TO AID REFUGEES IN GUATEMALA AND EL
SALVADOR

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

The European Commission cleared on October 23 two development aid projects
designed to help uprooted people in El Salvador and Guatemala. In El
Salvador, the ECU 4 million programme will help integrate into local
communities displaced persons, demobilised soldiers and people returning
to the department of Morazan, one of the areas worst affected by the
fighting that ended with peace agreements in 1992. In Guatemala, the EU is
putting up ECU 3.1 million to help pay for infrastructure improvements and
to promote agricultural and forest production.

In an effort to encourage self-sufficiency and sustainable development in
El Salvador in the longer term, actions under the new programme will be
targeted specifically at strengthening productive activities via a credit
system and providing specialised technical assistance and support for
marketing development and training needed to build productive
infrastructure.

Other activities carried out under the ECU 4 million programme (of which
ECU 3.6 million comes from the EU) will aid in the construction and
rehabilitation of social, health and education infrastructure and
communication routes, cleaning up the environment and the development of
technical skills and expertise. The encouragement of basic cereal
production, the creation of family kitchen gardens and livestock
production will also be priorities. Carried out jointly by the Deputy
Minister of Foreign Affairs in El Salvador and the European Union in
collaboration with local and European non-governmental organisations, the
project is scheduled to run for one and a half years.

The Commission has supported those uprooted by armed violence in El
Salvador since 1984, and since 1991 has provided aid to help people
resettle in Morazan from, for example, the Colomoncagua refugee camp in
Honduras. Some ECU 4.6 million has been invested in projects geared
primarily at supporting self-sufficiency in health, education,
agricultural and stock-breeding production, the installation of workshops,
and the production of textiles, leather and footwear.

Aiding peace in Guatemala.

With the November 1996 signing of an overall peace agreement in Guatemala
in view, the Commission approved a programme to help resettle communities
in the Sayaxche and La Libertad municipalities in the El Peten department
that were displaced, primarily to Mexico, by the civil war. It is designed
to foster the move towards democracy, promote socio-economic development
and create the machinery for consultation between the government and civil
society.

The ECU 4.4 million project (of which ECU 3.1 million will be provided by
the EU) will finance infrastructure and basic services construction such
as access roads, schools, health centres and drinking water systems, and
aid in agricultural and forest production, including the promotion of
permanent crops, reforestation, sustainable forest management, and the
development of other natural resources. Funding will be provided for
training in carpentry and wood craftsmanship, weaving and eco-tourism. The
project also aims to reinforce the capacity of local communities to
formulate and draw up their own development projects.

With an estimated 30 million refugees and displaced persons worldwide, the
European Commission has just published "Refugee Issues", a 36-page
document which provides an overview of EU aid in favour of displaced
persons in Africa, Latin America, Asia, Central and Eastern Europe and the
CIS, the Middle East and North Africa. In 1995, ECU 725 million was
allocated to help deal with refugee crises.

CULTURE: COMMISSION TO FUND 147 PROJECTS

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

A total of 147 projects concerned with preservation of the European
cultural heritage will benefit from Community funding to the tune of ECU
ten million. This decision by the European Commission falls within the
framework of actions in preparation for the implementation of the Raphael
programme. This programme, which is on its way to being adopted, was the
subject of a report by Francisco Sanz Fernandez (PES, Spain) adopted by
the European Parliament, meeting in plenary session in Strasbourg on
October 22, and recommending an increase in its budget.

The European Union's activities in the area of cultural heritage
preservation expanded during the 1980s under the influence of the European
Parliament. Each year, the Commission supports projects selected for their
cultural or technical value. It also finances exhibitions and publications
vaunting Community projects and initiatives in this area. The Commission
proposed the Raphael programme on March 29, 1995, with the goal of
providing a broader and more coherent framework for activities already
under way in the area of cultural heritage.

Parliamentary report.

Introducing his report on second reading, Mr Sanz Fernandez stressed the
need to increase the programme's budget to ECU 86 million from the ECU 30
million proposed by the Council of Ministers and which he considers
inadequate in light of the programme's objectives. The report emphasised
that culture is not a luxury and that handing the European cultural
heritage down to future generations is essential. It also pointed out
cultural activities' potential for job creation. The Commission has
indicated that it recommended a budget of ECU 67 million. The rapporteur
had no objection to the Council's wish to reduce the length of the
programme from five years to four, taking into account preparatory
activities conducted in 1996.

Financing of pilot projects.

The 147 projects selected by the Commission were advanced by national,
regional and local authorities, as well as associations of private
individuals in the EU Member States. Some 25% of these projects provide
for participation by associated countries of Central and Eastern Europe
and other third countries that have Association or Cooperation Agreements
with the Union. Five distinct actions were launched:

- cooperative projects for the preservation and promotion of the European
Baroque heritage

- projects aimed at promoting the European archaeological heritage

- projects for the promotion and provision of access to the cultural
heritage of museums

- activities and/or events with a European dimension for the preservation
and increased awareness of the European cultural heritage

- supplementary training and mobility for professionals in the sector.

OPPOSITION TO COMMUNITY TRANSIT DECISION

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

Against the background of the war it is waging on Community transit fraud,
the European Commission is planning to increase the overall guarantee for
"non-sensitive" goods on the basis of duties and taxes paid during
delivery operations. Under the Commission proposal the guarantee would be
raised from 30 to 100% A few months ago, the guarantee was suspended for
"sensitive" goods, which are subject to high duties and taxes and are thus
a favourite target for fraudulent activities. The matter was expected to
be considered by the October 25 Internal Market Council. In view of the
proposed increase, EuroCommerce, which represents the EU's commercial
sector, has already voiced its firm opposition to a plan, saying it is
unwarranted. The association reckons that the low level of duties and
taxes to be paid for non-sensitive goods act as a disincentive to fraud.
EuroCommerce is worried about the harmful consequences for the economic
operators involved. During a public hearing held by the European
Parliament's Committee of Inquiry, Community transport operators also
stressed what a heavy burden they would have to support as a result of
increased guarantees. They are calling for more sharing of
responsibilities between the different agents in the transit chain.

AUDIOVISUAL POLICY: PARLIAMENT INDICATES SUPPORT FOR GUARANTEE FUND

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

"The Americans have managed to inculcate the entire world with their
values. Europeans must use their film industry to defend and promote the
ideals of the European Community", declared French MEP Armelle
Guineberti
re (UFE) in support of the creation of a European Guarantee
Fund for audiovisual production during a debate in the European
Parliament's plenary session. In a report adopted by the Parliament on
October 22, Mr Guineberti
re issued a moving plea for a full-scale
European response to American domination of the cinema. "A European film
industry must have resources at its disposal", she said, calling the
Guarantee Fund the answer to both a cultural and an economic need.
Amendments to the Commission's proposal were nonetheless numerous and
supported special provisions for productions in less widely-spoken
languages.

The draft Decision establishing a Guarantee Fund for the audiovisual
industry was unveiled on November 14, 1995. Under the proposed system,
banks would be granted guarantees for a portion of the loans they make to
film producers or distributors. The European Union's contribution would be
ECU 90 million, this amount to be matched by the private sector and other
public bodies. This Fund would be administered by the European Investment
Fund (EIF). It will not be easy to put into practice, given the
reservations expressed by the Council of Ministers, which must reach a
unanimous decision for the proposal to go ahead. Furthermore, as Mrs
Guineberti
re's report points out, the unresolved technical and financial
issues shed doubt on the firmness of the Member States' political will to
set up a Guarantee Fund of this kind. In any case, the Parliament plays a
merely advisory role on this proposal, which based on Article 130 of the
Treaty.

Specific strategy for SMEs.

The Audiovisual Guarantee Fund would have to take into account the demands
of the market, production issues and television rights, which do not
concern the cinema directly, but merit more consideration, the
Parliamentary report noted. Criteria for eligibility would give special
treatment to small countries, those with a less widely-spoken language and
smaller firms. The MEPs were also sceptical about the choice of the EIF to
manage the Fund. Given the specific features of this sector and the legal
and financial implications of the guarantees to be provided, an ad hoc
structure would have to be set up within the EIF to represent the European
Union's funds. However, it would be assisted by a group of professional
experts from the film industry and the world of banking, as the
"particular nature of the audiovisual sector rules out the direct
application of the EIF's own criteria", according to the report.

Mrs Guineberti
re further recommended a pilot period of five years, during
which the Fund's impact on the European audiovisual sector could be
assessed. Once its usefulness had been demonstrated, the Union could begin
to think about laying the legal foundations for its future activities.

Commission reaction.

Marcelino Oreja, the European Commissioner for the Audiovisual portfolio,
declared that he hoped the Council of Ministers will adopt the proposal
for setting up the Fund at its December 16 session on audiovisual affairs.
He indicated willingness to incorporate 21 of the Parliament's amendments,
in particular one emphasising the difficulties faced by countries with
lesser-used languages. He also supports some other amendments in
principle, including the one proposing an ad hoc structure wherein
industry professionals would be represented to administer the Fund, and
another in favour of support for SMEs and small-scale projects. However,
Mr Oreja opposes the idea of setting up the Fund for a provisional period
of five years during which its impact on the European film industry could
be assessed.

CULTURE: PARLIAMENT CALLS FOR INCREASE IN CREDITS FOR ARIANE

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

The financial package provided for the Ariane programme to promote books
and reading is too small, according to the European Parliament. On second
reading of a proposal on this cultural programme, the MEPs adopted a
report by Nana Mouskouri (EPP, Greece) during their October 22 plenary
session in Strasbourg.

Ariane is a programme of support for books and reading. First proposed in
November 1994 (COM(94)356), it is based on Article 128 of the Treaty
(requiring the Council of Ministers to take a unanimous decision). The
Parliament gave its Opinion on first reading in April 1995 and the Council
adopted its common position in July. As Mrs Mouskouri pointed out, this
common position changed four points of the initial proposal:

- The length of the programme was reduced from five years (1996-2000) to
two years (1994-1998), with the option of launching another programme
after an assessment of the first one, to which the rapporteur had no
objections. Pilot projects in the areas covered by Ariane had a budget of
ECU 2.5 million in 1996; this was the figure advanced by the Commission
for the first year of the programme.

- The budget was decreased from ECU 34 million over five years to ECU
seven million over two years. The Council adopted the proposals contained
in the revised version of the Commission's budget. This is unacceptable,
in the Parliament's view, if the Union wants to have a real impact on the
current situation. The Parliamentary report thus proposed a budget of ECU
10.5 million.

- While the Commission proposed setting up an Advisory Committee to
administer the programme, the Council preferred a joint Advisory and
Management Committee. The Parliament is in favour of an Advisory Committee
as initially proposed.

- The original proposal provided for three main actions, but the Council
established six priority measures. Mrs Mouskouri believes this approach
provides a clearer vision of the scope of application of the programme,
but she emphasised promotion of reading via translation of works written
in the Union's lesser-used languages.

Marcelino Oreja, the European Commissioner responsible for Cultural
Affairs, assured the Parliament that the Commission is particularly
sensitive to arguments concerning the need to defend minority languages,
but said he could not agree to the funding increase given budgetary
constraints.

MAD COW DISEASE: MIXED SIGNALS FROM COMMISSION ON "PROVEN" BSE/CJD LINK

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

The European Commission sent out mixed signals on October 24 to news that
UK scientists may have proved a direct link between bovine spongiform
encephalopathy (BSE) and a new variant of the human brain condition
Creutzfeldt-Jacob Disease (dubbed by experts "vCJD"). Speaking at a press
conference in Paris, EU Farm Commissioner Franz Fischler said he thought
in the light of the new findings, the European Union ought to bring in
stricter legislation on consumption of animal offal, and stressed that the
UK authorities should now proceed with the planned targeted cull of some
150,000 cattle, suspended by the Major Government in mid-September.
Meanwhile back in Brussels, a Fischler aide spoke of both positive and
negative aspects of the scientific discovery. The negative side, he said,
was the obvious public health risk, now shown to be very real, that eaters
of infected beef tissue may have contracted brain disease. The positive
element consisted in the fact that the new discovery would make it easier
to trace animals incubating the disease, he stressed. Meanwhile, in
Strasbourg, Members of the European Parliament voted to extend the mandate
of the Temporary Committee of Inquiry into BSE.

BSE and vCJD prions "match".

The British scientific journal Nature carried a report on October 23 of a
new technique developed by Dr John Collinge and his colleagues in the
Prion disease Group at Imperial College School of Medicine, London, for
tracing the "molecular marker" of the prion protein which causes the brain
tissue of sufferers to degenerate into a spongy mass. "The biochemical
signature of prions in patients who died from new variant CJD matches that
of prions in mice and macaque monkeys experimentally infected with BSE,
but differs from that of prions in human patients with acquired or
sporadic CJD", says the Nature report. This finding "greatly strengthens
the conclusion that vCJD is a consequence of the BSE epidemic in British
cattle", it goes on. The new technique is likely to form the basis of a
rapid diagnostic test for spongiform encephalopathies, say the experts.

Further safety precautions?

Reacting to the news, a European Commission spokesman stressed that the EU
executive had been proceeding on the assumption of a BSE/CJD link for some
time and that all necessary measures to protect the public were already in
place. The new study would go to the EU scientific committees for
examination, and any necessary new proposals would be made on the basis of
their recommendations, the spokesman explained. However, from Paris, Franz
Fischler indicated to the press that he would be re-tabling to the Farm
Council on October 28 proposals to completely exclude from the food chain
those cattle and sheep tissues found most likely to transmit the BSE agent.

Harmonisation needed.

The legal situation regarding use of brain, eyes, spinal cord, nervous
tissues, spleen and lymph glands (shown to be capable of transmitting the
fatal prions) from cattle and sheep varies across the European Union. The
only EU-wide statute on the subject relates to UK bovine tissues, which
are banned from export. Also, ruminant waste may not be fed to cattle and
sheep, but does constitute an important ingredient in the meat and bone
meal still fed to pigs, chickens and other farm animals. The French
authorities paved the way towards tighter rules in June, when they banned
from both human foodstuffs and all animal feeds the tissues in question,
from cattle aged over 6 months and sheep and goats aged over one year.
Ireland and the UK have brought in similar regulations. Mr Fischler
believes Member States' rules should now be harmonised on the French
model. However, a proposal to that effect he tabled to the Council in July
met with little enthusiasm from the EU Standing Veterinary Committee.

The French Agriculture Ministry gave a favourable reaction on October 25
to an announcement by the Bonn authorities of a new national legislative
Bill that would, in line with French law, ban all imports from France of
the sensitive tissues. The Ministry welcomed the move, as likely to foster
EU-wide harmonisation of measures. The German Government has since July
maintained a unilateral ban on all products containing beef tissues from
the UK and Switzerland, the two main centres of the BSE epidemic in Europe.

Inquiry extended.

Meanwhile the European Parliament voted in plenary session on October 24
to extend the mandate of its Temporary Committee of Inquiry (TCI) into BSE
for another three months. The nineteen MEPs who have been interviewing
Commission staff, government officials and scientific experts since early
September feel they need more time to get to the bottom of all the
evidence, some of which seems to point to an early cover-up of the dangers
of "mad cow disease" for public health. The TCI will now produce its
report sometime in late February.

FISHERIES: PROCESSORS CALL FOR LIFTING OF FISH IMPORT TARIFFS

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

The European Union's tariffs on fish imports have been sharply criticised
in a report by the European Fish Processors Association (AIPCEE) which
argues that they raise prices to the detriment of the consumer. The report
- which calls for an end to import restrictions by quantity or by price -
says the EU now depends on imports from third countries for half its fish
consumption.

Tariffs harming EU industry's competitiveness.

European Commission sources tried to dismiss the report as irrelevant and
one-sided, but the AIPCEE, which represents the fish processing industry
in twelve EU Member States, insists that the policy implications are
clear. The report says that tariffs levied on imports harm the
competitiveness of the EU processing industry on the international market
against those processors from countries where tariffs are negligible,
especially on finished products. "The outcome of the regime can only be to
raise prices to the detriment of the consumer, the processing industry and
ultimately to the fishermen themselves through the destruction of markets."

Around 50% of total imports of fish and fishery products from third
countries are covered by imports of cod, saithe, redfish, haddock, hake
and Alaska pollack, the report says. "The supply of the EU market with
these species has to be safeguarded up to 83% by imports from third
countries like Norway, Russia, Iceland, Poland and Argentina." This means
that only 17% of total white fish supply can be met by the EU's own fleet.
The report argues that with demand outstripping supply, imports of these
stocks do not harm the EU's own fishermen. "Therefore, there is no purpose
in restricting imports by quantity or by price when supplies are not
available from EU fishermen."

The AIPCEE estimates that the supply of EU fish products amounted to 8.5
million tonnes in 1995, up 29% from 6.6 million tonnes in 1986. Over the
same period, imports from third countries nearly doubled from 2.7 million
tonnes to 5.5 million tonnes in 1995. By contrast, exports from the EU to
third countries grew only from 1.3 million tonnes to 1.4 million tonnes.
"The continuous trend towards import dependence needs to be recognised in
a further liberalisation of the conditions under which such imports from
third countries are allowed", the report says.

The report offers four policy recommendations for the European Commission
and the EU's Council of Ministers:

- decisions on tariff suspensions should be taken sufficiently in advance
to give EU enterprises time to plan their forward purchases and avoid
unnecessary costs for storage and financing;

- there should be duty free access to raw material especially when
important third countries are granted duty free access to the EU for
processed fish products;

- further reductions should be made in import duties for species which
cannot be supplied in sufficient quantities from EU catches: such reduced
duty imports should extend not only to frozen raw material, but also to
fresh fish necessary for the processing industry;

- autonomous tariff quotas should be converted for certain species into
general tariff suspensions.

More generally, the AIPCEE makes four suggestions to contribute towards
improving supplies for domestic fisheries:

- using size control to produce more selective catches: cod, saithe and
haddock catches are generally too small and of low marketing standards;

- improving quota management so that supplies are available on a reliable
and continuous basis for the filleting industry: the report says the
processing industry cannot cope with the successive gluts caused by
erratic landing patterns of EU catches;

- the plans to cut fishing capacity should be based on long-term analyses
of the conditions necessary for sustainable fishing effort;

- closer cooperation between EU fishermen and the processing industry on
measures to improve domestic supply, based on the long-term sustainable
availability of fish at world market prices.

Last March, the association called for the lifting of the Commission's
plans for fish inspection charges. It listed four reasons for rejecting
the plans: the levy would act as a tax on the fish consumer, and demand
would fall further if prices rose; fish is very safe and becomes
unpalatable before it becomes unsafe, making the checks an unnecessary
bureaucratic procedure; the need for checks can only actually be judged by
local inspectors after individual operations; and it would be impossible
to assess what a standard charge should be when the cost is not known.

REGIONAL POLICY: COMMISSION TIGHT-LIPPED ON COHESION REPORT

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

The European Commission has been remarkably secretive about its draft
Cohesion Report, due to be released on October 31, which is expected to
provide a comprehensive assessment of the European Union's various
Structural Fund policies and its efforts to reduce regional disparities.

The services of Regional Policy Commissioner Monika Wulf-Mathies often
tend to be cautious about information, but there is particular reticence
about the Cohesion Report, which has involved a number of different
Directorates since the beginning of the year. Rumours about the report
suggest that it may reveal continuing disparities in certain regions, but
Commission officials are refusing to confirm or deny any speculation.

The structure of the Cohesion Report can, however, be revealed. There will
be four sections dealing with different aspects of regional policy. The
first will be an overview of social and economic cohesion within the EU,
showing past trends and developments. Then there will be a section dealing
with the individual efforts by the EU Member States to influence cohesion
within their territories. The third part will be an examination of the
EU's various complementary polices which have had an effect on the
regions, like the Common Agricultural Policy, telecommunications, business
networks and social policy. And the final part will concern the effects of
the EU's Structural Funds and Cohesion Fund on the regions.

The impact of the report will be felt far beyond the Commission's regional
policies. The Commission is able to concede that the Cohesion Report will
provide a springboard to the 1999 review of the Structural Funds. And any
analysis of the link between the EU's efforts and social and economic
cohesion will be studied closely by the aspiring EU candidates in Central
and Eastern Europe (CEECs) hoping to gauge future EU regional policy.

The current Structural Funds have a total budget of ECU 157 billion for
the 1994 to 1999 period, and Mrs Wulf-Mathies has suggested maintaining
the overall criteria for the package. This will mean the Structural Fund
budget would remain at the current 0.46% of the EU's gross domestic
product, and the overall figure for the 2000 to 2006 period would be about
ECU 260 billion. But there is scepticism about keeping other aspects of
the current Structural Funds. For example, the Cohesion Fund, which
provides Funds for Member States with less than 90% of the EU's average
gross national product could be dominated by the CEECs if they join. The
same goes for the current criteria for Objective 1 of the Structural
Funds, which goes to the EU's poorest regions, whose gross domestic
product is 75% or less that the EU average.

AGRICULTURE: 1995 EU FARM SPENDING DOWN AS PERCENTAGE OF GDP

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

Total expenditure under the Guarantee Section of the European Agricultural
Guidance and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF) for 1995 rose to ECU 34,503 million,
from the ECU 32,970 million disbursed in 1994. However, this figure
represents a lower percentage of both the total EU Budget (51.7%, compared
with 55% in 1994) and total Community Gross Domestic Product (0.53%, down
from 0.58% in 1994). These facts emerge from the 25th EAGGF Guarantee
Section report*, newly approved by the European Commission. The report's
authors point out that the 1995 expenditure figures are inflated by the
inclusion for the first time of the three new Member States -Austria,
Finland and Sweden - and by the fact that direct aid to farmers introduced
under the 1992 reform of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) was also
stepped up during the year.

Expenditure well inside guideline.

The final total of appropriations allocated to the EAGGF Guarantee Section
in 1995, i.e. the original 1995 Budget, the Supplementary and Amending
Budget (SAB), letter of amendment, transfers and provisional
appropriations, totalled ECU 36,849.6 million (not including the monetary
reserve of ECU 500 million) plus automatic carry-overs amounting to ECU
64.3 million. During the 1995 financial year, the agricultural guideline,
which sets a ceiling on Guarantee Section spending, was fixed at ECU
37,944 million, somewhat higher than the 1994 financial year (ECU 36,465).
In the event, total expenditure came to ECU just 34,503 million. No
non-automatic carry-overs were made from the 1994 Budget to that of 1995
and there was therefore no expenditure under that heading. The trend in
expenditure since 1988 is shown below in Graph 1a. Graph 1b shows EAGGF
Guarantee Section expenditure within the EU's General Budget.

Expenditure breakdown.

Looking at the different categories of spending, the figures show that
spending on export refunds continued to decline, falling from ECU 8,161
million in 1994 to ECU 7,802 million in 1995. It thus now accounts for
only 22.6% of total EAGGF Guarantee Section expenditure. Meanwhile,
intervention spending in 1995 came to ECU 26,206 million, mainly
consisting of storage aid and price compensatory aid (production,
processing and marketing aid). As a result of a return to more balanced
markets, expenditure on storage fell very steeply from ECU 5,386 million
in 1993 to ECU 1,070 million in 1994, and then again to ECU 339 million in
1995. On the other hand, price compensatory aid was up (from ECU 24,490
million in 1995 as compared with ECU 21,339 million in 1994). This was due
to the major expansion of production aid schemes (acreage payments,
set-aside, suckler-cow premiums and premiums for male bovine animals)
introduced as part of the 1992 reform of the CAP.

Arable aid dominant.

Comparing product sectors, arable crops, a heading which now subsumes four
former expenditure headings (cereals, oilseeds, protein plants and
set-aside), accounted for 43.5% of overall spending. This sector was
followed by milk products (11.7% ) and beef and veal (11.7%). (See Graph
2a below.)

France the chief beneficiary.

Among the Member States, France is still the main recipient of Guarantee
Section expenditure at ECU 8,377 million - absorbing some 24% of overall
spending. Next, at some distance, come Germany (ECU 5,380 million), Spain
(ECU 4,562 million) and Italy (ECU 3,364 million) (see Graph 2b). In their
first year following accession, Austria received ECU 86 million, Finland
ECU 62 million and Sweden ECU 75 million.

Lengthy clearance of accounts process.

One of the main features of the clearance of accounts procedure, the
report explains, is that it enables the Commission to recover from the
Member States sums unduly paid in the application of the regulations on
the Common Agricultural Policy. After lengthy dialogue and conciliation
stages with the Member States in question, decisions leading to recovery
are taken by the Commission. Following this path, clearance of the
accounts for 1991 was only adopted by the Commission on 21 December 1994,
so that its consequences apply in the 1995 financial year. The sum
recovered amounted to ECU 1,518.3 million out of expenditure totalling ECU
30,332 million, the report details.

Conciliation body begins work.

During 1995, under the accounts clearance procedure for 1992, a proposal
was put to the Commission for the recovery of ECU 1,026.5 million out of a
total of ECU 32,083 million. The Commission's final decision in February
1996 reduced the amount to be recovered to ECU 997.5 million. 1995 was
also the year in which the conciliation body began its work, which
involves observations on the clearance of the 1992 accounts. This led to a
series of new, lengthy preventive measures on the part of the Commission
EAGGF accounts clearance departments following upon the conciliation
procedure. At the same time, preparation of the accounts clearance
procedure relating to the 1993 financial year continued to the stage of
dialogue with the Member States, says the EAGGF report.

ENVIRONMENT: "NEW" PROPOSALS FOR ENFORCING LEGISLATION

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

On October 22, the European Commission presented a three-point programme
for improving implementation of EU environmental legislation. This is not
a superfluous initiative: in 1995, the Commission registered 265 suspected
breaches of environmental Directives, representing no less than 20% of all
infringements against Community law. This is why, according to the
Commission, "original proposals" must be now considered. However, it
remains to be seen whether this "Communication on the implementation of EU
environmental law" - which only sets out general guidelines - will have
any genuine effect as it does not contain any binding measures. It will at
least have the merit of launching a wide-ranging debate on the issue.

As Ritt Bjerregaard, the Environment Commissioner, recalled, "improving
implementation of EU environmental law is not just a question of taking
Member States to Court". "It is neither possible nor practical for all the
legal actions that could arise from lack of compliance with Community
rules to be channelled through one enforcing authority, the Commission and
one court of law, the Court of Justice", the Commission explains. Recourse
to Articles 169 and 171 of the Treaty appears insufficient but will remain
complementary to any new measures envisaged.

According to the Communication, the following three initiatives are most
apt to effectively improve the implementation of EU environmental
legislation "because control of implementation begins at home, in the
Member States":

* the establishment of guidelines to assist the Member States in their
environmental inspections;

* the establishment of a procedure within the Member States to receive and
examine complaints from the public about the implementation of Community
environmental law;

* examination by the Commission of the question of guaranteed basic access
for representative organisations to the national jurisdictions, "in
keeping with the principle of subsidiarity" (some Member States already
have an Ombudsman system, while others have no provision). This is the
most controversial issue. Following the adoption of the Communication, one
Commission official explained "we have no wish to create new mechanisms
where provisions already exist".

"The solutions we are advocating would enable non-governmental
organisations to appeal to the courts", he explained, imparting the
Commission's wish for decisions to be taken at the most local level
possible.

On the Community level the Commission may, in future proposals (and when
revision existing Directives), introduce a specific provision requiring
the Member States to provide sanctions in national legislation for failure
to respect EU environmental law. These penal, administrative and other
sanctions may for example take the form of withdrawing operating licences
from such factories as fail to respect a Directive.

EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT VOTES ON SAFETY OF MOTOR VEHICLES AND SHIPS.

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

Gathered in plenary session in Strasbourg between October 21 and 25, MEPs
adopted two reports concerning transport. The approved report concerning
the Directive on roadworthiness tests for motor vehicles and their
trailers (cooperation procedure second reading) only retains three of the
amendments proposed by the rapporteur Italian Independent Spalato Bellere.
MEPs are anxious to increase the frequency of testing (three years after
the date on which the vehicle was first used and thereafter every year)
and ban old vehicles that fail to meet minimum standards for braking
systems and emissions. Voting to adopt the report by Nikitas Kaklamanis
(UFE, Greece) on the safety and efficiency of marine equipment aboard
ships sailing between European Union ports, MEPs retained a number of the
amendments tabled in first reading (under the cooperation procedure),
notably the insistence that safety checks are carried out by accredited
independent bodies.

SWEDEN REFUSES TO BUDGE ON TRAVELLERS' ALCOHOL ALLOWANCES

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

Sweden remains intractable in current negotiations with the European
Commission on purchases of alcohol by travellers. To the Commission's
dismay, Sweden is still refusing to set a date for the end of a derogation
allowing it, along with Denmark and Finland, to impose stricter limits on
purchases of alcoholic beverages by citizens travelling within the
European Union than those provided for in Community legislation. Mario
Monti, the European Commissioner for the Internal Market, Customs and
Taxation, held another round of talks with the Finance Ministers of the
three Nordic countries in Strasbourg on October 23. He said that he
remained flexible as to the date when the exemption would end, but that he
wanted this date, once specified, to be firm (see European Report N  s
2167). If no agreement can be reached, the European Court of Justice will
be responsible for putting an end to the derogation, the Commission warned
following the meeting.

Denmark and Finland are reportedly willing to give up their special regime
in 2004. The Commissioner feels, however, that five and half years is
sufficient time for these countries to adjust. He said following the
meeting that he would suggest that the Commission set a deadline of June
30, 2002. The Commission will present a proposal to this effect very
shortly, so that the Finance Ministers will have time to examine it before
the end of the year. Unanimous agreement is required to extend these
exemptions beyond 1999, the date initially specified by the Commission.

EUROPEAN COMMISSION TO CREATE ENERGY ADVISORY COMMITTEE

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

The European Commission is likely to adopt by early November a Decision to
create an Energy Advisory Committee, as called for in its December 1995
Energy Policy White Paper, as part of an effort to establish an informal
but institutionalised dialogue with the energy sector and ensure its
support when new areas of action in the energy field are chosen. This
Committee will be expected to assist in identifying energy policy areas
where Commission action is deemed to be necessary, provide advice on the
means needed to implement Commission proposals and give opinions on these
proposals before they are finalised.

The Committee is to be composed of 31 representatives of energy producers,
distributors, consumers, unions, and associations dealing with the
protection of the environment. During the preparation of the White Paper,
all these interested parties had indicated to the Commission the priority
they place on dialogue and transparency in the formulation of EU energy
policy.

INTERNAL MARKET COUNCIL: ALL TALK AND SCARCELY ANY ACTION

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

Gathered on October 25 in Luxembourg for a sitting devoted to the Internal
Market, EU Ministers listened to strong words from European Commissioner
Mario Monti, who sought to prod them into applying EU Single Market
legislation more effectively. The Ministers held a debate on transparency
of rules covering information society services. Talks about administrative
cooperation, in particular, were held with representatives of associate
countries from Central and Eastern Europe (see separate article). As
European Report was going to press, the Council was on the verge of
passing a Resolution on streamlining customs procedures and giving the
European Commission permission to negotiate a Customs Cooperation
Agreement with Norway.

Toeing the line.

Unless EU countries show a bit more determination in trying to apply
mutually-agreed rules, the Single Market will not be able to produce the
anticipated benefits in terms of jobs, economic growth and
competitiveness. This is the gist of the message that the Commissioner for
the Internal Market had to give to Ministers. In spite of the appeal made
at the EU Summit in Florence last June and the letter Mr Monti sent to
each Member State, there is little improvement to report in the way the
Member States are transposing and applying Internal Market Directives: the
overall rate of transposition for all Member States is virtually the same
as that reported at the previous Internal Market Council in May (93.3% in
the case of Directives reflecting the 219 measures the 1985 White Paper
thought necessary for completing the Single Market, and 90.9% for the
1,140 Directives relating to the Internal Market).

In the context of Single Market legislation as a whole, the Commission has
instituted 11 proceedings against Member States in the EU Court of
Justice. Denmark and the Netherlands are the two most disciplined
countries in this respect and far outstrip the larger countries. Spain and
France come eighth and ninth respectively in the class, whereas, Germany
is last but one, the one being Austria. The most problematic sectors
continue to be public procurement (Denmark, Luxembourg and the Netherlands
are alone in successfully transposing EU legislation in this area) and
insurance (Spain and Greece are lagging well behind). The Commissioner
reported the presentation, in early November, of a Commission
Communication on the impact and efficiency of the Single Market in the
European Union.

Mr Monti explained to Ministers the key ideas in the Citizens First
initiative due to be launched on November 26 (and not November 20 as we
mistakenly reported in our previous issue). The first information guides
for the general public in Europe will focus on the themes of living,
working, studying, training and carrying out research in an other EU
country. Others due to be published in mid 1997 will cover consumers and
the social dimension of the Single Market. A free phone service will be
set up in each country to enable individuals to gain access to the media
for this large-scale information campaign The Commission also referred to
the progress made with pilot projects initiated under the SLIM programme
on legislative legislation. This matter is due to be given a higher
profile during the November 26 Internal Market Council.

Openness in the information society.

During the debate on the Commission's proposal for a Communication on
regulatory transparency in the Internal Market for information society
services, France was the only country to bristle at the strategy being
recommended. Paris argued that the some of the services were treated in
the proposal "like pieces of merchandise". The French representative was
referring to the Commission's idea of treating on-line services,
interactive entertainment services and on-line information services as
coming within the scope of EU legislation on the free movement of goods
and not on telecommunications or the audiovisual sector. (European Report
will return to this matter in a forthcoming issue.)

Other subjects.

As the afternoon was drawing to a close, on October 25, Ministers were
still preparing to adopt a Resolution on the simplification and
rationalisation of customs rules and procedures. Ministers had already
reached an agreement on this matter prior to the Council meeting. They
were also due to give permission to the Commission to negotiate a customs
cooperation agreement with Norway, an agreement that would take account of
links this country has in this sphere with the Nordic EU countries. They
were also set to adopt without further debate a Regulation for increasing
from 30 to 100% the guarantee given by transport hauliers for
non-sensitive goods (less exposed to fraud) under the Community transit
system. This decision gave rise to an agreement on October 23 between
COREPER (the Committee of Member States' Permanent Representatives to the
EU) and the European Commission (see previous issue of European Report).
The agreement nonetheless allows certain exemptions and maintains the
guarantee at 30% for transporters above suspicion (established in the
Member States where the guarantee is given, frequent users who have always
behaved correctly, etc.).

FARM COUNCIL: BEEF DOMINATES AGENDA FOR OCTOBER 28/29 SESSION

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

EU Agriculture Ministers meeting in Council in Luxembourg on October 28
and 29 will return to a subject which has dominated the headlines in one
way or another since March, namely beef. The Farm Council will try to
agree on a support package consisting of short-term crisis measures and
longer-term structural adaptations to help the beef sector cope with
falling demand in the wake of the BSE crisis. With a number of Member
States unwilling to back some of the more far-reaching elements in the
European Commission proposals for cutting production volumes, the
Ministers are unlikely to reach consensus without burning the customary
midnight oil. However, the financing question may prove to be the biggest
stumbling block. The European Parliament has so far refused to consider
proposals for slashing cereals aid to pay for beef support, which means
the Council cannot legally adopt them. Meanwhile, the Commission is
insisting it cannot endorse the necessary ECU 1 billion-plus of
expenditure without first balancing the books.

Commission wants balanced budget.

A package of three linked proposals tabled by Farm Commissioner Franz
Fischler on July 30 calls for reductions in arable aid payments and cuts
in investment support to pay for higher beef intervention buying and other
short-term measures designed to absorb surplus EU beef production,
estimated at 1.2 million tonnes per year since consumption has fallen in
the wake of the "mad cow" crisis. Parliament used its urgency procedure to
vote an Opinion on the first part of the package - the purely beef sector
measures - on September 20, but refused to do the same for the
controversial arable aid cuts. The Commissioner has always expressed
reluctance to see the three elements split up. If measures costing over
ECU1 billion are to be agreed, then the Ministers should decide at the
same time where the money is coming from, insisted a Fischler aide.
However, a Commission spokesman insisted on October 25 that basic
agreement on the medium-term measures - designed to cut back production by
slaughtering very young calves, reducing premium rights for farmers and
lowering stocking density - would have to be reached before Ministers head
for the airport on October 29 or 30.

In fact, Franz Fischler has already given away an important bargaining
chip in agreeing to raise the Community beef intervention ceiling from
400,000 to 460,000 tonnes for 1996, and endorse public buying-in of
lighter cattle ("weanlings") under 300 kilogrammes in weight. These
decisions, voted through on a Commission proposal by Ministers at the
Fisheries Council on October 14, have taken some of the urgency out of the
issue, and the Member States' delegations may now be more inclined to hold
out for better terms for their farmers in the overall package. The more
intensive farming countries such as Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium
are opposed to moves to lower the regional stocking ceilings used for
calculating eligibility for special beef premium payments to farmers and
reduce the stocking levels for eligibility to the "extensification
premium". The Netherlands and Italy are unwilling to introduce the
new-born calf slaughter option, which they feel will outrage public
opinion, France wants to see premiums payable on suckler cows raised,
while Portugal is fighting to maintain the second premium payable on its
older, extensively-raised, bulls. (see European Report N   2158 for full
details of Member States' positions).

Problem now less urgent?

Meanwhile a report on the beef crisis drafted by experts in the
Commission's Directorate-General for Agriculture (DGVI), which was due to
be discussed at the Council, has been held up in the pipeline by Edith
Cresson, one of France's two Commissioners. The conclusions of the report
basically state that no further compensation should be paid to EU beef
farmers for losses incurred this year. Total producer losses since the
beef crisis began are put at just over ECU 1.1 billion for 1996. Council
has already allocated a package of Community money worth ECU 850 million,
with provisions for the Member States to match that figure with equal
national funds. Meanwhile some ECU 230 million has been brought forward
from the 1997 Budget allocation to pay advance suckler cow premia during
1996. This will have the effect of freeing up an equal amount of Community
funds to help finance beef measures next year. The French authorities are
still pushing however for extra compensation for their beef producers.

Exports booming.

On October 25 the EU Beef and Veal Management Committee accepted a further
31,000 tonnes of prime beef, plus 180 tonnes of weanlings, into
intervention, bringing to 396,000 tonnes the total amount of beef carcases
now in public storage. The Commission spokesman stressed that 1996
intervention would not now approach the 720,000 tonnes foreseen in early
pessimistic scenarios at the height of the crisis. Exports from the Union
are now running well over 22,000 tonnes per week and some 100,000 tonnes
ahead of schedule for the year 1996/97, as foreign demand has picked up
again. However, the GATT Agreement on Agriculture limit on export of
subsidised EU beef is likely to be reached before June 1997, when the
problem will flare up again, he warned.

Identification and labelling.

The Council will also register its initial reaction to Commission
proposals for cattle identification and beef labelling rules. The idea is
that all EU cattle should be identified by means of an eartag and personal
passport. As regards labelling, individual producers and organisations
would be authorised to put in place voluntary schemes for providing the
customer with detailed information on their beef products. The draft
Regulation lays down what information may appear on a label (for details
see European Report N   2163), and lays down rules for verifying the truth
of any claims made. The Commission hopes this scheme will be up and
running by January 1997, but the European Parliament will need to register
its Opinion before the Council can go ahead and adopt the legislation.

Quickfire offals proposal?

Franz Fischler has also announced he will be tabling proposals banning all
designated "sensitive tissues" from cattle and sheep from the human-animal
food chain (see separate article on mad cow disease).

Inspection Office.

Under the final main point on the Council agenda, the Ministers will look
at the long-standing proposal to set up an EU Veterinary and Phytosanitary
Inspection Office in Ireland. The proposals call for an independent agency
to take over part of the tasks currently being carried out by the Office
of Veterinary and Phytosanitary Inspection and Control (OVPIC) under the
auspices of the Commission's Directorate-General for Agriculture. The
Council has been asked to approve changes to the legal structure of this
new body in order to ensure its effectiveness and speed of action. An
advance staff has already set up shop in the town of Grange in County
Meath as the site of the new Agency, but disagreements are still raging
over the status of the office, the powers to be accorded to its staff,
numbers of new veterinary personnel to be hired, and the financing for the
expanded operation. Germany believes the Agency should remain a small
operation, financed entirely from the Community Budget, rather than
obtaining its own finances from licence fees on products authorised.

Other business.

A number of Member States have tabled points they wish to discuss under
any other business:

- Austria is concerned about subsidised cattle exports from Switzerland,
which are making life hard for Austrian exporters of calves to Italy;

- the Spanish and Portuguese delegations are demanding that the Commission
draft a "reflexion paper" for wide discussion before finalising its
upcoming proposals for reform of the olive oil sector;

- France and Greece want to see the provisions for grubbing-up of apple,
pear and nectarine orchards agreed under the 1996/97 price package
implemented promptly;

- the UK and the Netherlands want to keep up the pressure for
thoroughgoing implementation of Directive 95/29/EC, safeguarding the
welfare of animals in transit, particularly as regards mandatory staging
posts and vehicle capacity;

- the Greeks want to discuss the issue of foot-and-mouth disease in Turkey;

- Portugal intends to bring to the fore the plight of farming and forestry
in arid regions;

- the Swedish delegation wants to discuss the upcoming World Food Summit,
scheduled for November 13-17, urging that further CAP reforms would
facilitate cheaper worldwide provision of food.

AMERICAN SURVEY ON FACTORS AFFECTING EUROPEAN BUSINESS FORTUNES

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

Switzerland, Ireland and the Netherlands are the European countries rated
as most favourable for business, according to a survey conducted by the
European Council of Chambers of Commerce (ECACC*). The ECACC members were
invited to assess factors likely to affect the development of business in
23 European countries and the Mediterranean basin. The factors include
government policies, infrastructure, employment and social security
legislation, tax systems, and the quality of life. Countries with the most
unfavourable "climates" in this respect are Greece, Bulgaria, Poland, the
Slovak Republic and Romania. ECACC members were also questioned about the
medium-term (the next five years) prospects: the UK, Belgium, Switzerland,
Italy and Germany are fairly pessimistic, believing that the economic
climate is set to get worse.

Economic factors, including government incentives, banking systems, tax
levels and rates, social security costs, employee healthcare costs,
foreign exchange rate stability and environmental policy, were most
favourable in Luxembourg, Switzerland, Ireland, the Netherlands and
Austria, while they were rated as unfavourable in Poland, Hungary,
Belgium, Romania and France. As for workforce-related issues, including
worker quality, labour costs, training and retraining, labour unions and
worker involvement, Ireland, Switzerland, Bulgaria, Norway and Turkey were
rated highest in terms of the most favourable business environment, and
Belgium, France, Germany, Romania and Portugal came in lowest.

* Set up in 1963, ECACC represents American Chambers of Commerce in 21
countries, from Sweden to Israel and from Russia to Portugal. Some 16,000
companies (American and European) are affiliated to these Chambers of
Commerce.

MEMORANDUM TO CLEANING INDUSTRY

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

Trade union and employers' representatives from the European cleaning
industry, the FENI representing employers and Euro-Fiet the trade unions,
signed a joint memorandum on new sources of employment on October 21. This
agreement is the first concerning the development of new jobs signed by
social partners within the framework of a sectorial dialogue. The European
Commissioner for Social Affairs, Padraig Flynn, described the agreement as
"an innovative and realistic action marking an important step in the
shared work of the social partners". The memorandum asks public
authorities to create the conditions necessary for the exploitation of
these new sources of jobs, the cost of which is often too high for
individuals. The social partners have suggested that the Member States
introduce subsidies to develop demand on the part of individuals and
discourage work "off the books". Other mechanisms could include the
introduction of tax incentives and a reduction of the VAT rate on cleaning
services. The FENI and Euro-Fiet plan to hold a European colloquium on
this theme in early 1997, followed by Round Tables of all of the concerned
actors in the Member States.

UNICE OPPOSES ROAD USER CHARGE POLICY.

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

European employers represented by UNICE do not want to see road user
charges rise for another five years, to allow time for a global assessment
of the impact of such measures. It comes as no surprise that the proposals
on goods haulage by road presented by the Union of Industrial and
Employers' Confederations of Europe in Brussels on October 22 diverged
widely from the strategy pursued by the European Commission over the past
few months. Concerned about European industry's ability to compete on the
North American and Japanese markets, UNICE claimed that other modes of
transport are not competitive enough to handle the additional freight that
would be shifted off the roads to rail, inland waterways or maritime
cabotage. "European companies, on average, pay 16% more than those in the
United States and 21% more than in Japan for transport and logistics
services", says UNICE to justify its opposition to any increase in road
taxes. The message is clear: road transport is the only mode that works
efficiently, and imposing higher taxes on it will make it more difficult
for European firms to compete and could lead to company transfers and job
losses.

VAN MIERT DENIES BBC REPORT OF EU PROBE INTO BSKYB FOOTBALL DEAL.

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

EU Competition Commissioner Karel Van Miert denied reports on BBC Radio
Five Live on October 24 that a formal investigation was under way into
alleged distortion of EU competition rules by British Satellite channel,
BskyB, over its football Premiership deal. An EU source said that the
British Broadcasting Corporation had been mistaken in its confusion
between what Mr Van Miert said was a need to closely watch all exclusive
television agreements, and a formal investigation such as the one
currently being made into seven-year fixed contracts for a Dutch sports
channel (see European Report N   2157).

FRANCO-GERMAN STEEL TAKEOVER CLEARED

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

A takeover by German stockholding and steel distribution company Klockner
Stahl and Metallhandel (KSM) of French Arus Distribution Industrielle,
which is active in the same field, was cleared by the European Commission
on October 24. KSM is indirectly wholly-owned by the German industrial
giant, VIAG. Arus was founded in December 1993 when Paris-based Arbed and
Usinor Sacilor of Luxembourg, merged their steel business. It distributes
steel products in France and Britain for industry, ironmongery,
non-ferrous metals, heating and sanitary equipment. Under the takeover
agreement, KSM will acquire 62% of the shares in Arus, 31% from each of
Arbed and Usinor. Although the remaining shares are widely dispersed, KSM
will, as a result of the deal, hold sole control over Arus.

A Commission investigation into the agreement showed that it would not
give rise to market shares above 10% in either Germany, France or Britain.
In all sectors of the steel market, the combined Arus/KSM company was also
found to be likely to face strong competition from PUM, the Cockerill
Sambre subsidiary and the largest steel stockbroker in France, as well as
a large number of other stockholders, including at least two with market
shares of over 10% for heavy sections and merchant bars.

PUBLIC AID SCHEME FOR LUXEMBOURG'S COUNTRYSIDE APPROVED.

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

An aid scheme under Luxembourg's "programme for the upkeep of the
countryside and the landscape" was approved by the European Commission on
October 23. It constitutes a series of measures, financed on the one hand
by national aid, and on the other by funds from the EU's agri-environment
programme, to vineyards on steep slopes (with an inclination amounting to
more than 30%) and terraced vineyards. The total aid comes to
approximately 47,000 Luxembourg Francs and works out at about ECU 1,208
per hectare. The Commission has also said it will allow the Luxembourg
authorities to use state subsidies to finance less-intensive farming
methods which are compatible with environmental protection and the
maintenance of the countryside, before the Community part-funding arrives.

COMMISSION CLEARS STATE AID FOR GERMAN CIVIL ENGINEERING FIRM.

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

German construction and civil engineering firm Schachtbau Nordhausen was
given European Commission approval on October 23 to receive state aid for
a restructuring plan which began soon after it was privatised in 1992. The
aid involves a waiving of claims on the firm totalling 3.8 million
Deutschemarks, and a four-year extension on the repayment period of a 4
million DM state loan. In authorising the aid, the Commission took account
of its role in the overhaul of "an ailing firm in an area facing
considerable economic difficulty". The unemployment rate in Nordhausen was
running at 21% at the beginning of the year.

TELECOMMUNICATIONS: COMMISSIONER URGES DEREGULATION IN SPAIN BY JANUARY
1998

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

Karel Van Miert, European Commissioner for Competition, sent a letter on
October 24 to the Spanish authorities, asking them formally to forgo a
five-year waiver allowed by EU legislation. Spain would therefore
undertake to completely liberalise its telecommunications industry
(services and infrastructure) by January 1, 1998. An EU-wide telecoms
deregulation agreement, which hinges on the Spanish decision, would help
give a fillip to the stalled World Trade Organisation (WTO) talks on the
worldwide deregulation of telecommunications services, stresses the
European Commission.

Exemptions.

Spain has already made clear its intention not to use the five-year
transitional period in full, but it is still seeking a 22-month stay of
grace. This would mean that not before October 1999, the date when the new
legislation on licences would be introduced, would Madrid be required to
grant permits to other vocal telephony operators. Commissioner Van Miert
is apparently ready to grant Spain extra time to introduce the licensing
legislation, but no longer than six months. This would mean that no later
than June 30, 1998, the Spanish telecoms market would be opened up to
competition. Spain is the only Member State not to formally seek a delay
for opening up the sector to competition. Ireland, Portugal, Luxembourg
and Greece also enjoy this possibility and have made requests along these
lines (see table below).

The Commission stresses that Telefonica, the operator with monopoly
control over the basic vocal telephony service in Spain, is prepared to
accept liberalisation by January 1, 1998. Community sources also indicate
that the go-ahead for the merger between Telefonica and Unisource will be
not be given until Spain has officially confirmed the timetable being
sought. Unisource is jointly owned by operators from Sweden (Telia AB),
the Netherlands (PTT Telecom) and Switzerland (Sweizerische PTT-Betriebe).

Karel Van Miert cites several reasons for minimising the periods of time
covered by the exemptions. Under the terms of EU Directives regulating the
liberalisation process, transitional periods of this kind may be granted
only in the light of the sophistication of the networks. Further, the
Council of Ministers and the European Council have often stressed the
importance of a swift liberalisation process, in the interests of economic
growth and the promotion of the information society. It is also important
for the countries involved to become integrated as soon as possible into
the European telecoms market and thus be in a position to benefit from
investment and corresponding services.

WTO talks.

The Commission believes the EU-wide telecoms deregulation process will
also make a major impact on the WTO talks on telecommunications. The EU
deadline has to be as close as possible to 1998 in the Member States, as
1998 is also the target date set for liberalisation worldwide.

The WTO talks are due to end on February 15, 1997. The 53 countries taking
part in the talks should have reached an agreement last April 30, but at
the eleventh hour, the US decided to harden its position and thus
undermined the deal. The parties therefore gave themselves another nine
and a half months. The next key stage will unfold from December 9 to 13 in
Singapore, during the WTO Ministerial-level conference. In the meantime, a
high-level meeting is scheduled for November 14, after the US Presidential
elections.

Sir Leon Brittan, European Commissioner with the External Trade portfolio,
is hoping to use the intervening period to put the final touches to
Europe's improved offer to Geneva, with a firm commitment from Spain: this
country assumes particular importance in the WTO talks, given the size of
its domestic market and the inroads made by Telefonica in several Latin
American countries. Spain is the only country to be expressing reluctance,
according to a sources closely involved with the matter. Belgium, France,
Greece and Portugal also seemed disinclined, last March, to open up their
markets, but their doubts have now been dispelled, apparently.

Reaction from Madrid.

In a communique published on October 24, the Spanish Government confirmed
its resolve to open up Spain's telecoms sector in 1999. Rafael Arias
Sagado, Spanish Ministers for Public Works, issued a timetable, on October
9, for the programme of activities needed to ensure the telecoms markets
is fully exposed to competition. The timetable provides for the general
Law on communications to be completed in December 1997 and for the
Regulation on services and licensing procedures12 months later. The
Regulation governing the conditions for occupying the public sector is to
be adopted in the first quarter of 1999. Concrete licensing decisions are
due to be taken during the second quarter of 1999, according to the
Minister.

VAN MIERT SEEKS "CLARIFICATIONS" OVER ELECTRABEL ACCORDS

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

European Competition Commissioner Karel Van Miert has written to the
Belgian Government asking for "clarifications" over plans by the power
utility Electrabel, to force local authorities into long-term electricity
supply contracts, it was revealed on October 22. In March this year,
Electrabel, which is privately owned, offered the Belgian intercommunales
(joint ventures between municipalities for electricity distribution) the
chance to buy stakes in the company in return for signing 30-year
electricity distribution contracts. Mr Van Miert has repeatedly said that,
under EU rules on free and fair competition, he will not accept contracts
lasting more than 15 years.

The Commissioner is now reported to have asked the Belgian authorities for
a clearer explanation of how much freedom the local authorities will have
to end the contracts with Electrabel and choose to go to another supplier.
An EU source said that although the Commission had recently received a
letter from Leo Peeters, Flemish Minister for Home Affairs, agreeing "in
principle" to the 15-year contracts, Mr Van Miert was concerned about
recent indications that the parties to the agreements might be planning a
U-turn over commitments made in May for a definite reduction in their
duration.

ENPA APPLAUDS GREEN PAPER ON COMMERCIAL COMMUNICATION

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

Newspaper publishers represented by the European Newspaper Publishers
Association (ENPA) have cheered the approach recommended by the European
Commission in the Green Paper it published last May on commercial
communication (COM 96/192). The paper offers several guidelines for
harmonising the framework of rules on these sorts of communication (that
is advertising in all its forms) or at least for smoothing out the
national difference to some extent. The ENPA is particularly pleased about
the idea of a case-by-case probe of initiatives that European and national
authorities would be called upon to take in this realm. Subjecting the
initiatives to public scrutiny should prevent the emergence of new
obstacles, particularly in the context of the information society. ENPA
thinks that initially the country of origin rule should be strengthened
throughout the Single Market. This may be achieved by mutual recognition
of national rules. The publishers are backing the Commission's aspirations
to streamline the European legal setting. They call on the EU authorities
to take full account of the cultural diversities in the EU. The ENPA also
wants to see the Committee due to be instructed to monitor the rules
governing approximation process extended to publishers.

The ENPA is a lot more scathing about the Commission media concentration
plan. Confected by the services of Mario Monti, European Commissioner for
the Internal Market, the project is still under negotiation at the
Commission. The aim is to set a number of restrictions on media
concentrations so as to safeguard pluralism. The way the ENPA sees it, the
plan in its present form would act as a major obstacle to the future
development of local or regional publishing houses. The criteria adopted
would discourage the companies from growing as a de facto readership
threshold of 30% is imposed on any newspaper hoping to get involved in
broadcasting, according to the ENPA. Moreover, the rules being
contemplated would affect only time-honoured activities (daily newspapers,
radio and TV) and would affect the ability to develop new products and
services in the media industry.

COMMISSION CLEARS MANNESMANN STAKE IN GERMANY'S DBKOM.

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

A proposal under which German engineering group Mannesmann will buy a
49.8% stake in DBKom in an agreement with fellow German railway company,
Deutsche Bahn, was cleared by the European Commission under the EU Merger
Regulation on October 24. Under the terms of the deal, DBKom, which
operates the telecommunications network of Deutsche Bahn, will also be
merged with CNI Communications Network International, a telecommunications
company currently owned by Mannesman and Deutsche Bank. In a statement,
the Commission said DBKom would provide telecommunications services in
competition with Deutsche Telekom and other significant competitors, and
was not in danger of creating a dominant market position.

INTERNAL AUDITORS STAKE A CLAIM IN AUDIT GREEN PAPER DEBATE

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

The European Confederation of Institutes of Internal Auditing (ECIIA) has
welcomed the European Commission's July 24 Green Paper on the Role,
Position and Liability of Statutory Auditors (see European Report N  
2152), but says the Commission's insistence on effective systems of
internal control as a key element of corporate governance is only a start.
"Establishing, running and maintaining an effective system of internal
control calls for skills which most managers do not possess, and which can
only be provided through a competent and professionally qualified internal
audit function", says the internal auditing profession's European body. It
goes on to call for internal audit to be made mandatory in large
organisations.

ECIIA says an "expectation gap" has opened up between what the public
expects and what current rules provide on corporate governance. But
"exclusive reliance on the statutory auditor" cannot ensure adequate
internal control, and only creates "unfulfillable expectations in the
public mind". Certification of financial statements is not enough, it
argues: a "snapshot" judgement as to whether a company has a chance of
still being able to trade twelve months ahead "is hardly up to the task of
responding fully to shareholder and creditor concerns", it says, insisting
on the need for more systematic measurement - via an internal audit
function - of more reliable business performance indicators. Similarly,
the best way of dealing with fraud is by prevention rather than detection,
ECIIA argues - again pointing to the role of internal audit.

Above all, ECIIA says - contrary to the Commission's view - that boards of
directors are not in a position to respond to public concern over the need
for effective control. This is largely a day-to-day matter more properly
in the realm of management, the internal auditors claim. And any control
system put in place without an adequate review system "will probably fail
at critical points", warns ECIIA.

The proposed acquisition of German energy supplier, Isarwerke, by
Bayernwerk, the Bavarian electricity utility, was announced to be under
investigation by the European Commission's Merger Task Force on October
23. An initial examination of the deal has shown it is likely to fall
within the scope of the 1989 Council Merger Regulation, but before a final
decision is made, the Commission is inviting comments from third parties.
Submissions should be made under reference number IV/M. 808 -

STATE AID: COMMISSION REJECTS TAX BREAK SCHEME FOR ITALIAN ROAD HAULIERS

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

Tax credits worth ECU 466 million for Italian road hauliers in 1993 and
1994 were rejected by the European Commission on October 23 as
incompatible with EU state aid rules. The scheme operated on the basis of
payments of a fixed percentage, up to a certain maximum, of the cost
(minus VAT) of fuel and lubricants, calculated according to the weight of
the vehicle, to travel within Italy.

Under the scheme, Italian legislation provided for a system of tax credits
for Italian road hauliers operating for other people (i.e. not on their
own account), and for a system of compensation for non-Italian EU hauliers
(who are compensated for the fuel they use in travelling on Italian
territory). In 1992, the Commission started formal state aid proceedings
against the Italian State regarding a similar credit scheme in operation
that year, and found the aid to be incompatible with the Treaty. Two years
later, the Commission took Italy to the European Court of Justice for
failing to observe its Decision.

But the Italians continued with their tax incentives for road hauliers.
The credit schemes proposed for 1993 and 1994 are in all but terms of
budget, ceilings and application periods the same as those already
outlawed by the Commission; the only new element is the compensation for
non-Italian EU hauliers. A formal state aid investigation into the
1993/1994 scheme under Article 93(2) of the Treaty was opened in October
1995.

The Commission inquiry has found the scheme incompatible with the Treaty
on the grounds that it is an operating aid that is not offered as part of
a restructuring plan for the sector. It does not, therefore, fill any of
the conditions for exemptions to the Treaty's state aid rules. All aid
already paid out has been ordered to be recovered by the Italian
authorities.

COMMISSION RE-OPENS SECURIPOST STATE AID CASE

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

A European Commission investigation into allegedly illegal state aid to
French transport and security company, Securipost, prior to its
privatisation in 1993, was re-opened on October 23. The decision was made
following a September1995 ruling by the European Court of Justice that the
Commission had not taken sufficient account of a complaints by the Chambre
syndicale nationale des entreprises de fonds et de valeurs (French union
for investment funds, stock brokers and other financial service firms),
known as Sytravel, and the company, Brink's France.

The French Government will be asked to provide information in particular
on compensation payments to civil servants made redundant as a result of
the privatisation plan, and an apparent failure by Securipost to pay
social security contributions towards state unemployment benefit funds.
There are also suspicions that the French authorities may have made a
direct capital investment of FF15 million to Securipost in 1989. At the
specific request of the Court of Justice, the Commission has said it will
also carry out further investigations into fees charged by Securipost for
its services to the French national post office. Paris has one month to
reply to the allegations

FRENCH R&D SUBSIDIES FOR STEEL INDUSTRY APPROVED

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

French Government subsidies for two steel industry research and
development projects were approved by the European Commission on October
23. The first, a project dubbed "Myosotis", is being carried out at
Isbergues, in the Pas-de-Calais region, in collaboration with the German
group Thyssen, through a European Economic Interest Grouping (EEIG), and
relates to a continuous thin-strip casting process. It is expected to cost
a total of FF 96 million and cover a three-year period (1995-97). Under a
scheme known as "Major Innovative Projects" the project will be 50%
financed by the French steel company Uscinor Sacilor, which will receive
FF 12 million from the French State.

The other project, covering an equivalent period, to be carried out at the
Maizi
res and Gondrange works by IRSID, a Usinor Sacilor subsidiary, is
designed to adapt steel-making processes for use with scrap, and in
particular to adapt electric furnaces to new sources of iron. To be known
as the "steelworks of the future", it is intended to make optimum use of
energy and find solutions to the environmental hazards caused by the large
amounts of scrap metal in France and other Member States. The project,
which will cost a total of FF 76.5 million, is at the applied research
stage and will receive aid of FF 17.5 million.

STATE AID: GREEN LIGHT FOR TWO OUT OF THREE SPANISH OPEL PLANT SUBSIDIES

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

Two 1994 state subsidies granted by the Spanish region of Aragon to Opel's
Saragossa plant were given European Commission retroactive approval on
October 23. The Commission said the aid, which was intended to help
towards the production of the new Tigra sports model, was compatible with
rules for state aid to the motor industry. A third aid injection to the
General Motors-owned German car maker, from the same year, but for a
different sector of the plant, was turned down by the Commission, and
ordered to be repaid.

The permitted aid consisted firstly of a grant of 100 million Pesetas
towards an overall investment of 1,326 million for the introduction of
new, more sophisticated technology at the plant, and secondly, of a grant
of 68 million Pesetas towards total costs of 340 million Pesetas to train
the 500 employees to use the new technology. The third aid injection, a
grant of 200 million Pesetas towards the development of new software
equipment at a total cost of 1,300 million Pesetas, was rejected on the
grounds that it did not comply with EU criteria for state aid to the motor
industry. In a statement, the Commission said it has since received
assurances from the Spanish authorities that the 161 million Pesetas
already granted to the firm would be recovered.

Opel Spain is wholly-owned subsidiary of General Motors Spain. In 1993,
the Saragossa headquarters produced two Opel models, the Corsa and the
Astra, and had a turnover of 465 billion Pesetas, with net profits of 19
billion. Production of the Tigra model began in 1994 when the state aid
was granted.

VAN MIERT MEETS GERMAN SKET DELEGATION OVER NEW AID PLAN

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

A new restructuring plan for German heavy machinery giant SKET is soon to
be submitted to the European Commission for approval, a meeting between a
delegation from the company and EU Competition Commissioner Karel Van
Miert revealed on October 23. A former flagship of East German industry,
SKET Schwermaschinenbau Magdeburg, based in Magdeburg, Saxony-Anhalt, went
into financial receivership in mid-October. A Commission spokesman said Mr
Van Miert was "concerned with the situation, and prepared to analyse a new
plan with the same understanding he has already shown to SKET".

The Commission opened a formal investigation in March 1995 over
approximately DM 957 million worth of state aid to the troubled company.
The procedure was extended in July 1996 when additional measures worth DM
352 million were announced after the original privatisation plan
floundered (see European Report N   2153). SKET's recent efforts to restore
profitability have amounted to a reduction in costs of DM 31 million, but
the Commission is still doubtful about its chances of long-term viability
- something which a new plan must ensure if it is to be approved. Brussels
also suspects that some of the aid may have been used to cover SKET's
operating costs or to sell products at dumping prices. SKET owns 120 small
supply companies, and is currently under the control of the Bundesanstalt
fur vereiningungsbedingte Sonderaufgaben (BvS) - the German public agency
for special tasks related to reunification. Although there is no official
deadline for the formal submission of the plan, German Government sources
have said they hope it will be drawn up by the end of the year.

COMPETITION: COURT REJECTS COMMISSION EUROTUNNEL CONTRACT DECISION

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

A European Commission decision nearly two years ago to force French and
British railway companies, Societe Nationale de Chemins de Fer (SNCF), and
British Rail (BR) to give 25% of the Channel Tunnel's capacity to third
party operators (case T-79/T-80/95) was rejected by the European Court of
First Instance on October 22, on the grounds that it was based on a
factual error. In a statement, the Court said it had found the Commission
to have made a "profound error of judgement" over the interpretation of
the usage contract governing access to the tunnel.

A fixed rail link beneath the English Channel between Frethen in
Nord-Pas-de-Calais, and Cheriton in Kent, was born of an agreement signed
on February 12, 1986 by the French and British Governments. On March14,
1996, two private companies, Channel Tunnel Group, and France Manche,
secured the concession to build and operate the Channel Tunnel,
establishing a joint-venture company under the name of 'Eurotunnel'. The
concession, which was originally for 55 years, but later extended to 65
years in 1994, provided for half the Channel Tunnel capacity to be
reserved for passenger and goods trains between Britain and continental
Europe. SNCF and BR were to be entitled to retain full use of their share
of the capacity, on the condition that they arranged for the maximum
number of trains possible, provided adequate national railway
infrastructure (including for high-speed trains), and maintained their
payments to Eurotunnel - including a share of upkeep and maintenance.

But, after receiving comments from the interested parties, the Commission
ruled on December 13, 1994 that the way the usage contract was structured
allowed BR and SNCF to hold 100% of hourly paths available for
international freight, and that it was an infringement of Article 85 of
the EU Treaty and Article 53 of the EEA Agreement. It imposed a condition
on the two companies by which they would be required to make available 25%
of the hourly capacity of the tunnel to competitors. SNCF and BR contested
the Commission's Decision and lodged complaints at the Court of Justice on
March 7 and March 8, 1995 respectively. On October 22, they successfully
convinced the Court that third parties have always had access to the
Channel Tunnel, and that they had never had any intention to secure more
than 50% of international capacity. Since the Commission Decision has been
in place, no parties have actually come forward to exercise the right to
the remaining 25%, which is now no longer likely to be applicable,
following the Court's ruling. Meanwhile, loss-making Eurotunnel said on
October 22 that it would shed 657 jobs in an attempt to improve its
competitiveness.

EIB EURO-BOND ISSUE IN SPAIN.

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

The European Investment Bank is preparing the first Peseta-denominated
bond issue in Spain intended for small savers. "Bonos Europeos" will be
available in Spain from October 28 to November 15. Some 20 savings banks
and commercial banks, with more than 15,000 agencies in the country, will
offer for subscription 40 billion Pesetas worth of EIB bonds for a nominal
value of 10,000 Pesetas (ECU 62). The bonds are for 10 years and carry a
six-month interest rate of 7% (annual rate of 7.12%). The managing
underwriters are guaranteeing individual investors liquidity of the bonds
within 24 hours. The issue will be jointly managed by the Caja de Madrid,
Banco Central Hispano and Banco de Santander. The bond issue will
strengthen cooperation between the EIB and the Spanish banking sector and
allow the Bank scope for continuing to diversify its system for collecting
Peseta-denominated resources, according to the Bank. In Spain, the Bank
has helped along the development of the "Matador" market (bond market for
non-resident issuers of Peseta-denominated bonds) by its continuing
presence as a borrower of large amounts of funding. Between 1988 and 1995,
the EIB launched 38 issues and managed to collect over 750,000 million
Pesetas. Since the start of the year, it has raised over 200 billion.

MILD IMPROVEMENT IN CONFIDENCE INDICATOR IN JULY/AUGUST

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

Confidence in the economic outlook improved slightly between July and
August, according to a European Commission survey conducted among company
managers and consumer and published on October 21. The figures show that
the period of zero growth is drawing to a close, even though economic
indicators are still below the long-term average.

Figures for August show that companies prepared to step up production in
the coming months outnumber those who expect to do the opposite.
Nonetheless, EU industry orderbooks are far from full and exports continue
to be too low. The level of durable stocks is also considered excessive in
terms of demand for industrial products. The outlook is less bleak in
terms of the predicted level of orders and growth in exports. Industry is
also counting on increased output in the near future. This mild
improvement will not make any immediate effect on employment in the
industrial sector, though. EU industry's utilisation capacity was running
at 80.8% in July, which is much the same as the level reported in the
previous quarter. As for consumers, they are now less pessimistic about
their own financial circumstances and future developments.

TAXATION: COMMISSION WORRIED ABOUT GERMAN CAR INCENTIVES

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

Should Germany be allowed to provide tax incentives now for cars that
already meet the next round of vehicle emission standards recommended
under the Auto Oil air quality programme, which are still only at the
proposal stage? As the matter has now taken an almost exclusive political
turn (with "mistakes" being committed by all sides), it will be up to
European Commissioners to give an answer to the question, during their
October 30 meeting. On top of the political irritant, there are a series
of legal "hitches" that can be traced right back to the complex
compromises that preceded the adoption of the last Directive on motor
vehicle pollution.

The European Commission sent a letter to the German authorities last
September 23 to notify them that their draft Bill intended to allow lower
road taxes for cars that are more environmentally-friendly than required
by the standards in the Auto Oil proposals (tabled by the European
Commission on June 18) were out of step with EU legislation (see European
Report N   2161). Germany meekly withdrew its proposed Bill and it was
thought that was the end of the matter. Determined to press on with their
tax breaks, the German authorities soon tabled a new Bill and this too
offered tax incentives starting in 1997 but they are supposed to apply to
cars that comply with the standards provided in the Auto Oil proposals.
The Bill is therefore based on standards that are less strict than in the
previous plan.

They might, however, turn out to be too strict for the Commission's taste.
The matter is nevertheless still a highly controversial one. Article 3 of
Directive 94/12/EC (on motor vehicle pollution) certainly argues the case
for a unfavourable opinion from the Commission: it proposes that Member
States may provide tax incentives only for vehicles complying with the
requirements in this same Directive (the standards in the German Bill
extend beyond the confines of the Directive and are based on a proposal
that has still not been adopted by the EU Member States, far from it).
However Article 4 of Directive 94/12 argues the case for retaining the
German Bill: it specifies that the Commission and industry have to consult
under the Auto Oil programme in order for the Commission to recommend a
further tightening of the standards before the end of 1994 and that these
proposals should be adopted by the Council of Ministers before the end of
1996. Even though the Commission is not entirely to blame, the Auto Oil
proposals in the end were not presented until mid-1996 and have yet to be
adopted. There are therefore grounds for considering that Germany could
legitimately expect to be able to introduce, starting on January 1, 1997,
tax incentives for cars that are cleaner than required by the 94/12
standards (the Auto Oil proposals envisage the same kind of article as
Article 3 in the Directive 94/12).

Faced with the politico-technical conundrum, the Commission is feeling
extremely uncomfortable about the idea of refusing to allow Germany to
press on with its plan. "The Commission might well decide not to run the
risk of being taken by Germany to the EU Court of Justice for
non-observance of Article 4 of Directive 94/12", according to officials
closely involved with the matter. Admittedly, Article 4 made it possible,
when the Directive was being adopted, to rally the support of certain
countries which have long been more to the fore on the environmental
protection front. But is also completely unrealistic, in that it leaves
the Commission only a few months in which to define its position in the
face of the powerful interests of the motor industry and the oil industry.

TAXATION/EXCISE DUTIES: COMMISSION SOON TO PROPOSE TAXES ON ALL ENERGY
SOURCES

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

The European Commission is expected to come up with a proposal before the
end of November for an increase in minimum excise duty rates on mineral
oils and the inclusion of other energy sources - electricity, natural gas,
coal and perhaps even biofuels - in the excise duty system. If the
proposal is approved by the full team of Commissioners and the Council of
Finance Ministers (which could be more difficult), excise duties on
mineral oils would gradually be increased, particularly in those Member
States that currently have the lowest taxes. With the proposed energy/CO2
tax stalled for the past four years, the Commission's main goal is now to
win acceptance for the principle of some kind of tax, no matter how small,
on all energy sources. The proposal, which puts more emphasis on the
principle than actual tax rates, has already created "very serious
tensions" within the Commission, according to well-placed sources.

Since January 1, 1993, the Member States have been required to set excise
duties rates on mineral oils above a Community minimum rate (expressed in
ECU) for each product and its particular use (heating oil, lead-free
petrol, etc.) under Directive 92/82/EEC governing excise duties on mineral
oils. The same excise duty system covers tobacco and alcoholic drinks too
(although the Commission does not intend to modify the rates for these
products at the moment). A closer convergence of duty rates among the
Member States within the Single Market to prevent distortions of
competition was one of the Commission's and the Member States' objectives
in adopting this system. Some current minimum rates are listed below.

* Heavy fuel oil: ECU 13 per 1,000 kg

* liquefied petroleum gas and methane for industrial use: ECU 36/1,000 kg

* leaded petrol: ECU 337 /1,000 litres

* lead-free petrol: ECU 287/1,000 litres

Commission sources say that minimum rates should now be increased, not
only to keep pace with inflation, but also as a first step towards a
closer approximation of rates (setting a minimum rate tends to be
ineffective, since market forces push rates downward, according to
experts). This approximation of rates would discourage cross-border
shopping and would incorporate environmental concerns into policies in
other areas, now that the specific proposal for an energy/CO2 tax has
foundered. New rates should be high enough to create an incentive, but not
so high as to ruin the proposal's chances of adoption by the
Commissioners, informed sources explain. To soften the psychological and
practical impact of these measures, the increase would be gradual.
Commission experts speak of raising rates by about 30% over five to ten
years, but this is only theoretical. Several Directorate-Generals - DG III
(Industry), DG XXI (Taxation), DG XI (Environment), DG XV (Internal
Market) and DG XVII (Energy) must still consult among themselves.

Most of the Member States apply taxes at levels well above Community
minimum rates. But others (Portugal, Greece, Ireland and Luxembourg)
impose rates on certain products (some types of mineral oils) that are
equivalent to or only slightly higher than the minimum. These Member
States would eventually be required to raise their minimum rates to comply
with the new European minima (and for this reason are likely to oppose the
proposal in Council). The rise would also concern those States whose rates
are already well above the minimum rates. "This increase would give Member
States with high excise duty rates more room to manoeuvre, making excise
duties higher everywhere", says an expert on this issue, also bringing up
the concept of shifting taxes on labour to other bases, preferably with a
positive impact in terms of environmental protection.

These are exactly the arguments that have spurred the Commission to
broaden the scope of application of the Directive on excise duties to
include other energy sources such as coal, natural gas and electricity.
The Commission's first concern seems to be winning acceptance for the
principle of taxation of these products, regardless of the rate, as a
first step towards compensating for the failure of the energy/CO2 tax
proposal. As mentioned earlier, even biofuels could be include in this
proposal, which would thus supersede Directive 92/81/EEC on the structure
of excise duties on mineral oils, that on excise duty rates (92/82/EEC)
and the draft Directive on excise duty reductions for biofuels (still held
up in the Council).

COMMISSION ADOPTS TAX SYSTEMS REPORT

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

A European "code of good conduct" has to be developed to prevent national
tax policies continuing to be threatened by too much fiscal competition
between Member States, said European Commissioner for Taxation Mario
Monti, when presenting on October 22 the report the European Commission
had just adopted on the development of tax systems (see previous issue of
European Report for further details).

The erosion of the tax base is the main problem singled out by the
Commission, which recommends setting up a high-level forum, or a "Fiscal
Policy Committee" that with its overview of policies would work on
developing a code of good conduct for use by the Member States. "It is not
the proposals that are lacking, it is a consensus that is missing", Mr
Monti stressed once again, referring to the numerous proposals that seek
to complete the European fiscal area but have been held up in the EU
Council of Ministers for many years owing to the rule on unanimous voting.
"Nowadays it is much more often the markets, and no longer the Member
States, that are sovereign", he lamented, calling for greater coordination
between the Member States. "If the countries were to exercise this
sovereignty together, they might then be able to recover it from the
markets". He urged the Member States to coordinate their fiscal policies
more.

Minimising tax evasion, ensuring the smooth functioning of the Single
Market, promoting employment and environmental protection are just some of
the main themes in this report due to be presented to EU government
leaders at their December 13/14 Summit in Dublin. It will first be
examined by EU Finance Ministers in November. The report argues the need
to reverse the current trend towards an increasing burden on labour.

EMPLOYMENT: PARLIAMENT APPROVES NEW LABOUR MARKET POLICY COMMITTEE

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

The proposal for a Council Decision to set up an "Employment and Labour
Market Policy Committee" was endorsed by the European Parliament's plenary
session in Strasbourg on October 24. The report by Ioannis Theonas (EUL,
Greece), which formed the basis for the Parliament's Opinion, recognises
that such a Committee would remedy a deficiency by creating an official
and stable structure charged with monitoring employment policy and the
implementation of multi-annual programmes.

The Parliament believes this Committee should strengthen coordination
between the employment policies of the different Member States. It should
also participate in preparatory work on the annual report on the
employment situation and the joint report submitted to the European
Council.

The creation of a Committee similar to the Economic Policy Committee set
up in 1974, with the objective of promoting the coordination of Member
States' short- and long-term economic policies, was first proposed at the
informal Council of Social Affairs Ministers in October 1995. Since March
1995, monitoring of the employment situation has been the responsibility
of the ad hoc group of personal representatives of Labour and Employment
Ministers. However, this group has encountered difficulties in fulfilling
the task assigned to it, because of the lack of resources at its disposal.

The European Commission believes the Committee should serve to: - monitor
employment trends in the EU;

- examine Member States' employment and labour market policies;

- exchange information and experience between the Member States and with
the Commission;

- prepare reports and recommendations on these questions; and

- draw up an annual comparative report on the employment situation in the
Member States and the policies followed by the latter.

A preliminary agreement on setting up the new Committee was secured at the
Social Affairs Council on September 24, and should be ratified at the
December 2 Council (see European Report N   2160 for further details).

EMI TO UNVEIL EURO BANKNOTES THIS YEAR

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

The European Monetary Institute is expected to unveil the new Euro
banknotes this year, EMI President Alexandre Lamfalussy announced on
October 22. These banknotes will begin circulating on January 1, 2002 at
the latest. The EMI, precursor to the future European Central Bank,
launched a competition to design the Euro in mid-February, restricted to
artists specialising in the design of banknotes and designated by the
Central Banks of the European Union Member States. The final choice must
be approved by the EMI Council, which is composed of the Governors of the
15 Central Banks of the European Union, at a meeting later this year,
although no date has yet been set, Institute sources in Frankfurt said.
The EMI has received 44 proposed designs for the Euro. "I believe that we
will be able to announce the result of the selection process this year",
Mr Lamfalussy told a gathering of German businessmen.

A committee of specialists chose two themes for the future currency:
European historical periods and styles, and modern or abstract designs. Mr
Lamfalussy indicated that the first theme had been used in 27 of the
designs. A spokesman for the EMI explained that every aspect of each entry
is now being examined to determine whether it meets the criteria laid
down. Each denomination (5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200 or 500) must bear the
name of the currency, the initials of the European Central Bank in five
languages (BCE, ECB, EZB, EKB, EKP) and the stars symbolising the European
Union. The notes must also incorporate the latest anti-counterfeiting
technology (a watermark, a security thread that turns black on
photocopies, colour-changing inks) and be easily distinguishable by the
visually impaired.

POLE TO HEAD EAST EUROPE BRANCH OF COLLEGE OF EUROPE.

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

Jacek Saryusz-Wolski, well-known in Brussels as Poland's chief negotiator
- until just weeks ago - with the EU, has been appointed as Rector of the
College of Europe in Natolin, on the outskirts of Warsaw. He will take up
his appointment at the start of 1997. The College in Natolin was set up
two years ago, largely with PHARE programme funding, to provide a sister
establishment to the College of Europe in Bruges, Belgium, but with a
particular focus on Central and Eastern Europe. The 60+ students who
follow postgraduate European studies courses there each year come from
most EU and EFTA countries, most of the Central and East European
countries, and from countries in the former USSR. The teaching faculty
includes eminent visiting lecturers from across Europe and from Polish
political, administrative and academic circles. There is to be an official
opening ceremony for the College on November 6.

ECSC: EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT SEEKS REVISIONS IN DRAFT 1997 BUDGET

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

The European Commission's draft 1997 Operating Budget for the European
Coal and Steel Community, which cuts all items of expenditure except aid
for research, should be modified to fall in line with Parliament requests,
especially those concerning continuing ECSC aid for redeployment,
restructuring and research. Such were the conclusions of a Resolution on
the Budget adopted without amendment by the Parliament in plenary session
on October 24.

The Parliament is anxious to ensure that the necessary measures are taken
to prepare for the period after 2002, when the ECSC Treaty will expire,
and in the meantime that existing credits are used as wisely as possible.
In its Resolution, the Parliament said that the proposed operating budget
of ECU 265.5 million - an increase of ECU 24.5 million over the 1996 one -
is inconsistent with the run-down of activities implied by the plan to
phase out the Treaty. Also, noting that real needs estimated by the
Commission are of the order of ECU 172 million rather than ECU 265.5
million, the Parliament contests the Commission's decision to set aside
surplus revenue appropriations of ECU 93.5 million - almost the total sum
of resources derived from the levy on companies in the coal and steel
sectors - as a reserve for the successor body to the ECSC. For the
Parliament, the proposed Budget represents an imbalance between available
resources and requirements and, by containing a provisions for subsequent
financing, runs counter to the principle of an annual budget.

In its Resolution, the Parliament proposes increasing the sums allotted
for redeployment aid (from 56 to ECU 60 million), research (from 82 to ECU
91 million), conversion aid (from 7 to ECU 11 million) and social measures
in the coal industry (from 22 to ECU 26 million). It would also provide
ECU 5 million for the preparation of a successor body to the ECSC while
reducing the proposed reserve for this organisation from ECU 93.5 million
to ECU 67.5 million.

FOREIGN AFFAIRS COUNCIL: AGENDA STRETCHES FROM CUBA TO SINGAPORE, VIA
AFRICA AND RUSSIA

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

The meeting of EU Foreign Affairs Ministers in Luxembourg on October 28
and 29 has a full agenda, with decisions expected on international trade
matters - notably the anti-Helms/Burton law measures and the preparations
for the WTO Ministerial meeting in Singapore in December, on international
political matters - notably in the Middle East and former Yugoslavia, and
on crucial EU affairs including progress with the Inter-Governmental
Conference and with the preparations for Eastern enlargement of the
European Union.

The EU's response to the US Helms-Burton and D'Amato legislation is almost
ready. The Council will be asked to decide on the "blocking statute" - a
draft Council Regulation and a draft Joint Action - which would together
protect against the effects of third-country (for which, read "US")
legislation on EU trade with third countries (for which read "Cuba",
"Iran" and "Libya"). The draft EU measures are subject to some questions
still - with reservations on specific questions from the UK, Germany and
Spain (principally, non-compliance, recovery of damages, and scope), and
with Denmark opposed to the entire legal base of the draft Regulation. But
the Presidency says that discussions have now reached a point where it is
up to Ministers to take a decision. The European Parliament was expected
to give its Opinion on the proposals on October 25.

The Middle East features in several of the agenda items: the Council will
examine the Middle East peace process in the light of recent EU and Member
State contacts there, and will discuss the possible appointment of an EU
envoy in the region - although no precise EU view has yet been established
of an envoy's role or status (unofficial candidates are being discussed
already, however, with an informal short list including the Spanish
Ambassador to Israel, and a number of Italian and Swedish names); European
Commissioner for relations with Mediterranean countries Manuel Marin will
report orally on negotiations for a Euro-Mediterranean Association
Agreement with Egypt; the Council will be asked to adopt the common
position on the 10th session of the Cooperation Council with Egypt - which
will take place on October 28 at midday (see separate article in Section
V); and over the following a lunch broader political issues will be
discussed.

On the Inter-Governmental Conference, the Council will look particularly
at external action of the EU under the headings of Common Foreign and
Security Policy, external economic relations, and security and defence,
where the Presidency is seeking political direction from Ministers (see
separate article in this issue). The Ministers are planning an exchange of
views with the President of the European Parliament, but no formal
discussion of the recent Franco-German proposal on closer cooperation (see
Document with this issue of European Report) is planned by the Presidency,
which has merely noted the paper as one of several contributions to the
IGC discussions, but is taking no view of it. The Member States' personal
representatives will discuss flexibility at their own IGC meeting in
Luxembourg on October 29.

Ministers will also meet their counterparts from the ten applicants from
Central and Eastern Europe on October 29, with talks focusing on progress
in the pre-accession strategy, the IGC, and - over lunch - current
international issues, particularly former Yugoslavia and Russia.

Other matters up for examination at the Council include:

- progress in establishing an EU Monitoring Centre on Racism and
Xenophobia (although no decision will emerge until later this year);

- former Yugoslavia, with a report from the EU's High Representative
there, Carl Bildt, on the postponement of elections and other recent
developments, as well as discussion and probable adoption of Conclusions
on a regional approach for EU relations with South Eastern Europe and on
policy guidelines for EU input into upcoming international meetings on
former Yugoslavia;

- the probable adoption of EU guidelines for upcoming meetings of the
Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe;

- support for transition to democracy in Zaire (with a Belgian-inspired
discussion on the recent developments in the Great Lakes region); and

- the probable adoption of Conclusions setting out guidelines on EU
preparation for the WTO Ministerial meeting in Singapore on December 9-13
(with discussion focusing on trade in relation to labour standards,
tariffs, textiles, environment and investment). The Council will hear a
progress report on the telecommunications talks and consider the
newly-proposed mandate for the EU to begin negotiations with major trading
partners on an international Information Technology Agreement (see last
issue of European Report).

The Council is also scheduled to sign a Framework Agreement with South
Korea (see last issue of European Report). And the Council is expected to
decide on suspending trade concessions for Burma under the Generalised
System of Preferences (see separate article on the European Parliament's
Resolution).

IGC '96: MEPS WARY OF DUBLIN SUMMIT OUTCOME

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

Members of the European Parliament are expressing doubts about the outcome
of the special EU Summit hosted by the Irish Presidency on October 5 in
Dublin to try and inject some impetus into the negotiations on
institutional reform ahead of the EU's expansion to the East. In a
Resolution adopted on October 23 in Strasbourg by 328 to 34 with 83
abstentions, MEPs noted that EU government leaders had oft-repeated their
commitment to ensuring the Inter-Governmental Conference on the Maastricht
Treaty review is concluded next June in Amsterdam. However, MEPs want to
ensure that this should not serve as an excuse for scaling down the
ambitions. Meanwhile, the Franco-German proposals for ways of promoting
closer cooperation between small groups of countries has been given a
cautious welcome in some EU quarters. Personal representatives of Foreign
Ministers are due to consider the proposals on October 30 in the context
of the IGC. (European Report is publishing, as a supplement to this issue,
a full version of the Franco-German proposals on greater cooperation.)

Tabled by the Committee on Institutional Affairs, the Parliamentary
Resolution expresses concern about the EU's Summit's failure to move
forward on institutional reforms. The European Commission's President, who
was there to take part in the Parliamentary debate, agreed that "the
positions adopted by the delegations were still a far cry from what is
needed" and a great deal of progress had yet to be made in this area. The
Parliament nonetheless applauds the EU's resolve to stick to the timetable
and in particular to round the talks off next June in Amsterdam. However,
MEPs call for the draft Treaty, due to be presented by the Irish
Presidency prior to the EU Summit in Dublin, to "demonstrate the Union's
capacity to acquire instruments adequate to the important commitments it
will have to fulfill in the near future".

Generally speaking, the Parliament has stressed its commitment to the idea
of introducing a Treaty chapter on employment, adopting effective measures
to provide the EU with a Common Foreign and Security Policy and creating a
genuine Euro-wide policy based on internal security and freedom. The
Resolution underscores the need for decisions to be take by EU Heads of
State and Government when they gather for the next European Council in
Dublin, on December 13/14. Several MEPs in the Socialist, Christian
Democrat, Liberal and Green camps are leaning on the Member States'
governments to make a commitment soon to a full-blown public debate on the
EU reform process.

In the wake of an amendment tabled at the last minute, the Parliament gave
its reaction to the Franco-German plan to introduce a "general clause on
closer cooperation" allowing those who wish and have the ability to do so,
to move at a faster pace towards economic and political integration. The
Parliament judges that "any increased cooperation under the various
pillars must be achieved with due regard for the institutional framework,
the acquis communautaire and the objectives of the Union and must be open
to all Member States at any time".

Caution and flexibility.

The Franco-German idea of having a Maastricht Treaty clause to allow
certain countries to improve their cooperation in certain areas has been
given a cautious welcome. The Member States and the Commission are
planning to go through the proposal with a fine tooth comb. "The issue of
flexibility is one of the more importance ones to emerge from the
Inter-Governmental Conference. There is a strong feeling that there is a
need for something in this area, but there is also a very strong feeling
that this matter has to be given cautious consideration", Noel Dorr, the
current IGC Chairman, opined on October 22. During initial talks about the
flexibility proposals, several Member States voiced fears about the risk
of the Single Market being undermined. In Commission circles, the feeling
is that the text, which still has to be converted into articles (and this
will take some time), is going in the right direction.

The Commission has several reasons to be pleased. First of all the French
and Germans are seeking to apply enhanced cooperation in areas where
unanimous decision-making is required.

Second, the flexibility strategy is bracketed by stringent principles,
such as the need to retain the single institutional framework: no Member
State would enjoy a right of veto, no Member State would be excluded, and
there must be full respect for the EU's legislative achievements, for
Community law and the Treaty objectives. These principles would be
guaranteed by verification procedures enforced by the EU Court of Justice,
in particular, acting in response to a request from a Member State not
taking part in the enhanced cooperation.

A third reason to be pleased is the Franco-German determination not to
tamper with the Single Market: the flexibility strategy would not apply to
the EU legislative achievements and therefore to the Internal Market and
common polices. In the case of the first pillar, the Franco-German plan
stresses that "the need to list the possible areas would have to be
examined". The idea has been proposed for the flexibility approach to be
used, for example, by Economic and Monetary Union participants to converge
their tax laws, indeed even their compulsory levy systems, if unanimity
voting is to continue in these two areas by the end of the IGC. France and
Germany's partners believe the system has the major drawback of imposing
rules on those who intend to join the Euro zone at a later date, without
having allowed the newcomers to have their say.

Another advantage of the flexibility strategy is that in the context of
the Common Foreign and Security Policy and defining a common defence
policy, enhanced forms of cooperation may help to take account, without
necessarily having too suffer the consequences, of the specific
circumstances of certain Member States and in particular of the neutrality
of the Nordic countries, Ireland and Austria. The Franco-German plan
proposes to set a minimum threshold of Member States for implementing the
closer cooperation plan.

As far as France and Germany are concerned, the flexibility would be
another kettle of fish in the context of Maastricht's third pillar
(cooperation between the courts and police forces, immigration, right of
asylum, visas, combating drug-trafficking and crime). In this broad policy
area, the Franco-German plan envisages measures to slacken the system for
Conventions so that they would be able to come into effect after a certain
number of ratifications by the Member States (and solely for the States
having ratified according to a threshold to be set on a case-by-case basis
as well as scope for concluding Conventions with less than 15 countries,
thus committing only States that are parties to the Convention) and the
implementation of operational measures and material cooperation between
certain Member States.

The Franco-German plan certainly has its appeal, not least in the way it
seeks to prevent Community activities from being thrown into a state of
paralysis. However, the closer cooperation idea raises a series of
questions of a technical nature that have to be debated before being able
to be included in the Treaty. It also raises the fundamental question of
how the system will operate. Instead of providing a coherent view of
Europe, the numerous alliances could, on the contrary, end up by creating
disorder. The Member States would all be able to live under the same roof
- the European Union - but would proceed at different speeds. In theory,
and here were are looking some way into the future, countries joining the
single currency will not necessarily be the same ones taking part in
military operations in the Middle East, say, nor those who have
established an area in which people may move without obstruction. Against
this background, what will become of the family spirit and in particular
the financial solidarity on which the European Community is built? The
Franco-German plan still has to be spelled out in a bit more detail, but
it is possible to see that the initiative could act like a tonic on the
institutional negotiations: if it creates enough fear, it may induce the
Member States to be more ambitious about extending qualified majority
voting, to which the Germans and French are in theory still committed.

1997 EU BUDGET: EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT PROPOSES AN INCREASE OF ECU 800
MILLION

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

On October 24, the European Parliament in first reading proposed an
increase of some ECU 800 million to the draft European Union General
Budget for 1997 adopted by the EU Council of Ministers in July. Payment
appropriations emerge from the Parliament's first reading at ECU 82.514
billion, compared with the 81.646 billion voted by the Council. The
increase advocated by MEPs would chiefly benefit spending linked to the
functioning of the Internal Market - with an additional ECU 300 million
for the trans-European networks - research and development, the Northern
Ireland peace programme and external relations.

The European Parliament subscribed to the principal amendments tabled by
its Committee on Budgets on reports by the Dutch MEP Laurens Jan
Brinkhorst (on the General Budget and the European Commission's Budget)
and the Spanish Member Juan Manuel Fabra Valles (on the Budgets of other
institutions - see separate article on the ECSC Operating Budget). The
Parliament has chosen not to question the horizontal reduction of ECU 1
billion in farm spending sanctioned by the Council of Ministers, excluding
exceptional spending on the beef and veal sector and costs linked to the
BSE crisis, and in Structural Fund spending except for the less-developed
regions of the Community.

By contrast, the Parliament exercised its rights within the limits of the
financial perspectives, and voted to re-enter credits on internal policies
linked to the internal market and on external relations, revoked be the
Council during its first reading. In respect of internal policies, the
MEPs have chosen to put in reserve ECU 300 million including ECU 73
million in a negative reserve to cover funding for the 14 priority
transport projects and the IVth Framework Programme of Research and
Development, and ECU 100 million for the Northern Ireland peace programme.
This accounting trick should enable funds to be lifted from current lines
in Section 3 of the Budget. MEPs also expanded budget lines on things such
as the environment, consumer protection, equal opportunities, information
and communication, anti-fraud measures and transport, for which the
Council had approved deep cuts (see table below).

Turning to external relations, the MEPs voted through a ECU 335 million
increase in payment appropriations over draft Budget approved by the
Council. Among others, this increase will benefit the countries of Central
and Eastern Europe and the former USSR, Mediterranean and Latin American
countries and cooperation with non-governmental organisations. The
Parliament voted to withhold aid intended for Turkey (ECU 53 million for
the EU/Turkey Customs Union and ECU 3.5 million for technical measures).
As regards the appropriation for the MEDA programme of assistance to
Mediterranean third countries, of which Turkey is just one beneficiary,
the Parliament and the European Commission have agreed to finance projects
linked to promoting democracy and respect for human rights and
strengthening civilian structures in Turkish society. By contrast, the
Parliament complied with a Commission request and rejected projects
intended for South-Eastern Anatolia. A working party made up of 5 MEPs and
the European Commissioners Manuel Marin (Relations with Mediterranean
States) and Hans van den Broek (External Political Relations) will be set
up to exercise prior control over projects the Commission proposes to
finance in Turkey in 1997. Finally, the European Parliament took a scythe
to the Common Foreign and Security Policy line.

The Budgets of EU institutions, and in particular the Commission, have
emerged from the Parliament's first reading with a number of
modifications. MEPs decided to put in reserve 26% of remuneration for
Commission officials, in order to force restructuring of the
Directorate-General for Enterprise Policy, Tourism and the Social Economy
(DG XXIII), following the scandals that have sullied the Tourism Unit.
They also voted to put in reserve 50% of the credits allocated to the
Directorate-General for Information and Communication (DG X) to force it
to review its information policy. Discipline demands, the institutions
will not increase their personnel next year. However, in order to
guarantee the proper functioning of the institutions, the Assembly
approved a recommendation from Mr Fabra Valles, and voted to increase by
ECU 1.37 million the overall amount allocated to the Council of Ministers,
the Court of Justice, the Court of Auditors, the Economic and Social
Committee, the Committee of the Regions and the joint ESC/CoR structure.
This increase will finance measures involving personnel at the Court of
justice (ECU 154,000 on ECU 1.138 million), the ESC (ECU 16,486 on 90,158)
and the joint organisational structure (ECU 55,000 on 142,348).

These sums are not final. The Council of Ministers can reinstate a more
austere Budget in its second reading on November 19. However in respect of
so-called non-compulsory spending (with the exception of agriculture), the
MEPs will have the last word in December. Between the two readings, the
Parliament hopes to succeed in negotiating two agreements with the Council
and the Commission. The first concerns the forty budget lines that
correspond to pilot projects and Community programmes whose credits are
not allocated for want of a legislative act of the Council. The second
concerns the financing of EU fisheries agreements with third countries, on
which the Parliament is anxious to have its say.

Criticism of the execution of the 1996 Budget.

The European Parliament has also adopted a highly critical resolution on
the execution of the 1996 Budget, tabled by British Conservative MEP James
Elles. The Assembly criticises the wretched quality of budget forecasts in
the farming sector, denounces the poor rate of execution of the Structural
Funds budget, and disapproves of the Commission's deliberate refusal to
enact articles concerning the promotion of inter-regional cooperation
actions and the centre for enterprise and innovation, on the grounds that
similar actions could be financed through the structural funds. MEPs have
also expressed concerns over the slow-down in the execution of the budget
of Community actions supporting peace in the Middle East and has called on
the Commission, without delay, to provide information on the planned use
of credits covering special aid to refugees in the Republics of the former
Yugoslavia.
