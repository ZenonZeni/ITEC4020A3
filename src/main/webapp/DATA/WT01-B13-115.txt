<P>
The Clinton administration should be pleased about the July
correction in U.S. equity prices.  The market has begun adjusting to the
growing likelihood of Federal Reserve tightening during August.  If the markets
had expected the Fed to remain passive, the risk would have increased of
investors becoming even more speculative than they were during the spring and
setting the stage for a dramatic stock market correction in the weeks before
the presidential election.  <i>Any Fed tightening during August will have only
a marginal effect on the economy this autumn whereas a repetition of the 1987
stock market crash would permit the Republicans to argue that the economy's
current prosperity is an illusion which will give way to recession next
year.</i><p>
<p>
While most of Wall Street is now prepared for a 25 basis point interest rate
hike this month, there continues to be considerable disagreement about the
economy's underlying strength.  As Alan Greenspan himself suggested in his
recent congressional testimony, there are good arguments for expecting final
demand growth to slow during the second half of 1996.  He said,<p>
<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
"...the support to economic growth provided by expenditures on durable goods,
both for household consumption and business fixed investment, is likely to wane
in coming quarters.  Consumer spending in the past few years has been boosted
as households have made up the purchases of big-ticket items that they had
deferred during the recession and the early, weaker phase of the recovery.
Five years after the business-cycle trough, however, we should expect that this
pent-up demand has been largely exhausted.  Moreover, many households have
built up sizable debt burdens in recent years, and coping with debt repayments
could hold down their spending.  The business sector has been adding
considerably to capacity; opportunities to invest profitably in new capital
should be increasing less rapidly as final demand slows some."</BLOCKQUOTE><p>
<p>
The problem for the Federal Reserve and investors is that the U.S. economy has
just completed an inventory sub-cycle lasting almost one year and is now poised
for a revival of stock-building.  The auto sector added about 1.0% to output
growth during the second quarter and will probably add another 0.5% during the
third quarter.  The GM strike shifted some auto output to the second quarter
while GM may build inventory during the third quarter in order to hedge against
strike risks in September  The non-auto manufacturing sector remained subdued
during the second quarter but should give a boost to output during the next few
quarters.  It is possible that the auto industry will create excess inventory
during the third quarter if there is no strike to consume it during September
but auto sales have been so responsive to price discounting that it should not
be difficult to reduce inventories quickly if the need arises.  <p>
<p>
<i>The economy's performance during the past year has been very comparable to
the gradual upturns which followed previous sub-cycles of slow growth resulting
from monetary tightening and inventory adjustments during the long expansions
of the 1960's and 1970's.</i>  Excluding weather driven disruptions of output
during January, the purchasing agent index reached a trough of 45.7 during
June, 1995 and rebounded to 54.3 during<p>
June, 1996 after fluctuating in a narrow range of 46.0-48.0 during recent
months.  The rebound in the purchasing agent index so far has been highly
comparable to the upturns which followed the slow growth sub-cycles of
1984-1985 and 1988-1989, but it has been much weaker than the recovery from the
slow growth sub-cycle of 1966-1967, when defense spending was buoyant. The
rebound in the stock market also has been very positive compared to the upturns
from previous slow growth sub-cycles.  The stock market has increased by 24%
since June, 1995 whereas during the upturn from the 1967 slowdown the gain was
only 5.0% and during the rebound from the 1989 slowdown the market declined.
<i>Monetary policy and inflation have been the critical determinant of equity
prices during all of the sub-cycles.</i>  In the late 1960's, the economy was
so overheated by the Vietnam War that monetary policy had to be tightened.  In
the 1989 sub-cycle, inflation had accelerated by enough that the Fed decided to
raise interest rates despite the sluggish growth of output.  In 1985, by
contrast, inflation was so subdued that interest rate declined and encouraged
equity prices to rise by 29% during the twelve months after the trough in the
purchasing agent index.<p>
<p>
The inflation environment today is analogous to the 1986 subcycle on the basis
of indicators such as the purchasing agent price index.  It is now about 50
compared to a trough of 40-45 twelve months ago and a peak of 70-80 two years
ago.  <i>But the level of unemployment today is 5.3% compared to an average of
7.2% during 1985.  As a result of the low level of unemployment, the major
concern of policy makers today is not industrial commodity prices but potential
upward pressure on wages.  As Chairman Greenspan noted in his recent
testimony,</i><p>
<p><blockquote>
"The economy is already producing at a high level -- and some early signs of
pressures on resources are emerging, especially in the labor market."</blockquote><p>
<p>
The uptick occurring in the level of wage growth is not alarming but it
is clear that a change of trend is underway.  The wage component of the
Employment Cost Index is now rising at an annual rate of nearly 4.0% compared
to less than 3.0% during 1995 while benefits are rising at an annual rate of
close to 3.0%.  If this acceleration continues in response to another year of
low unemployment, the core U.S. inflation rate could approach 4.0% by late
1997.  The risk facing the corporate sector is that the Fed will attempt to
prevent rising wages from pushing up prices by dampening output growth,
depressing productivity, and creating a squeeze on profit margins.<p>
<p>
The level of unemployment is now below 4.0% in two regions accounting for 10.8%
of the national labor market (the upper mid west, the plains and rocky mountain
states).  It is below 5.0% in four other regions accounting for over 36% of the
national labor market (New England, the southeast, the middle west and the
border states).  It is in the 5.0-6.0% range in six other regions
(mid-Atlantic, Florida, the deep south, the oil patch, the southwest and the
Pacific northwest).  It is above 6.0% only in New York (6.6% of the national
labor market) and California (10.6% of the labor market).  <i>As both New York
and California are currently experiencing much stronger output growth than they
were one year ago, it is doubtful that their district presidents would oppose
proposals to tighten monetary policy from low unemployment districts such as
Kansas City, Chicago or Minneapolis.</i><p>
<p>
The major argument against tightening in the face of escalating wages is that
final demand growth will soon moderate and thus lessen the upward pressure on
the economy's resource utilization rates.  <p>
<p>
The growth rate of retail sales slowed during June and July after strong growth
during the spring.  The uptick in mortgage rates should start to cool the
housing market this autumn.  Companies, such as Hewlett Packard, have warned
that there will be a major slowdown in high technology capital spending during
the next twelve months.  The sharp uptick in credit card delinquency rates
could encourage some banks to impose tighter lending quality standards on their
credit card operations.  If low income households suddenly lose access to
cards, they could be forced to curtail their spending.  The inventory
restocking process in the U.S. corporate sector has already produced a large
rebound in the level of imports which will erode the economy's growth momentum
by expanding the trade deficit.<p>
