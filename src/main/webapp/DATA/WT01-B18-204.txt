<H2><I>E. </I>Conclusion</H2>

Transportation will be the fastest-growing source of U.S. carbon dioxide 
emissions over the long term - by far - unless Americans take 
aggressive steps to build efficiency into transportation systems. 
Transportation is the only sector of the U.S. economy that is virtually 
totally dependent on oil. America is importing more oil than ever before, 
and the trend is upward. Transportation accounts for about half of all air 
pollution emissions in the United States, and more than 80 percent of air 
pollution in cities. Every tank of gasoline consumed by an automobile 
produces up to 400 pounds of carbon dioxide emissions.<BR>
<p>     Solutions to these transportation problems are within reach; what is 
needed is the political will to tackle them. Internal combustion engines 
are becoming increasingly efficient. Federal CAFE standards have doubled 
automobile fuel efficiency, saving nearly 3 million barrels of oil every 
day. Programs are helping retire older, more polluting vehicles from the 
road, while emissions-reduction technologies in new vehicles are being 
improved.<BR>
<p>     A revolution is underway in the transportation sector - the 
development of new low-emission and zero-emission vehicle technologies. 
The California Air Resources Board has implemented LEV and ZEV vehicle 
standards, which will take effect in 1998, that should spur a potential 
trillion-dollar market for environmentally clean automobiles. Several 
electric vehicle and hybrid-electric vehicle manufacturers are gearing up 
for mass production.<BR>
<p>     If the United States is going to seriously reduce carbon dioxide 
emissions in the transportation sector, however, long term solutions must 
include a reassessment of land-use planning. Communities nationwide are 
seeking to redesign urban structures around people, rather than around 
traffic. Several new urban designs maximize the benefits of locating 
conveniences within walking or bicycling distance.<BR>
