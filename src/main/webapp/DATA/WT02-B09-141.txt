<B>Cooper Institute's Oocyte Donor Program</B><br><hr><p>
<FONT SIZE=2>The Donor Oocyte (egg) Program was established in 1988 with the intent and purpose of making the IVF procedure more affordable.  Donation of oocytes is an option for those IVF participants in need of some financial assistance.  By donating half of the recovered eggs during an IVF cycle, the donor has the opportunity to assist another infertile person or couple to achieve a pregnancy, as well as receive some financial assistance to cover the expense of IVF.  The donor, in exchange for the sharing of her eggs, has the egg retrieval, the embryo transfer, and the necessary medications paid for by the recipient of the eggs.  Those IVF patients wishing to donate eggs are selected anonymously by a patient who needs donor eggs, (a recipient).  We cannot guarantee that all women wishing to be a donor will be selected.
<p>
The IVF cycle includes the ultrasound guided transvaginal retrieval, incubation, fertilization, and development of embryo(s), and transfer of embryos(s).  Both donor and recipient are responsible for their own preliminary IVF testing and bloodwork/ultrasounds for the cyle.  If necessary, each party will be responsible for the cost of sperm washing, sperm donation, sperm freezing, cryopreservation of excess embryos and embryo storage costs.
<p>
The total number of oocytes will be equally divided between the donor and the recipient at the time of retrieval.  If an odd number of oocytes is obtained, the recipient will receive the extra egg.  For instance, if fifteen oocytes are obtained, teh recipient will receive all of the eggs from that cycle.  The recipient will then be financially responsible for another IVF cycle and medications for the donor.  During the donor's then be financially responsible for another IVF cycle and medications for the donor.  During the donor's next attempt at retrieval, the donor will retain the same number of oocytes as produced in her previous cycle where less than five oocytes were obtained.  Any remaining oocytes will then be equally devided between the donor and the recipient, if requested by the recipient.  A donor who has produced fewer eggs than expected has the right to keep all the eggs for herself.  The recipient must be reimbursed for all of the medication costs.
<p>
The donor cycle will be automatically cancelled if during the follicle stimulation process they fail to produce an adequate amount of estradiol.  That level is defined as less than or equal to 120pg/ml on day five of Peronal/Metrodin/Humegon.  The recipient will be notified by the IVF staff that the cycle is cancelled.  The donor is obligated to return all unused medication to the recipient.
<p>
In the event the egg donor experiences ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome and must freeze all of the embryos, the egg recipient will be responsilbe for an additional $350.00 to cover the added expense of a frozen embryo transfer for the donor.
<p>
In the event a donor refuses to donate her oocytes in accordance to the procedure set forth above, the donor will then be responsilbe for the payment of all costs relating to the donor cycle.  This includes the retrieval, incubation and fertilization, transfer, any medication provided by the recipient, plus the recipient's medication costs for the cycle.  This payment must be made prior to the retrieval of oocytes.  The recipient is relieved of any further obligation to the donor if the donor refuses to donte.
