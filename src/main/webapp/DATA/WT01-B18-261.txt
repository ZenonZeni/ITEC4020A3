<p align="center"><tt>Proposition 215</tt></p>

<p align="center"><tt>Medical Marijuana Intiative</tt></p>

<p><tt>Section 1. Section 11362.5 is added to the Health and
Safety Code, to read:</tt></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><tt>11362.5. (a) This section shall be known and may be
    cited as the Compassionate Use Act of 1996.<br>
    <br>
    (b) (l) The people of the State of California hereby find and declare
    that the purposes of the Compassionate Use Act of 1996 are as
    follows:</tt></p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><tt>(A) To ensure that seriously ill Californians have
        the right to obtain and use marijuana for medical
        purposes where that medical use is deemed appropriate and
        has been recommended by a physician who has determined
        that the person's health would benefit from the use of
        marijuana in the treatment of cancer, anorexia, AIDS,
        chronic pain, spasticity, glaucoma, arthritis, migraine, or
        any other illness for which marijuana provides relief.<br>
        <br>
        (B) To ensure that patients and their primary caregivers
        who obtain and use marijuana for medical purposes upon
        the recommendation of a physician are not subject to
        criminal prosecution or sanction.<br>
        <br>
        (C) To encourage the federal and state governments to
        implement a plan to provide for the safe and affordable
        distribution of marijuana to all patients in medical need
        of marijuana.</tt></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><tt>(2) Nothing in this act shall be construed to
    supersede legislation prohibiting persons from engaging in
    conduct that endangers others, nor to condone the diversion
    of marijuana for nonmedical purposes.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>(c) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no
    physician in this state shall be punished, or denied any
    right or privilege, for having recommended marijuana to a
    patient for medical purposes.<br>
    <br>
    (d) Section 11357, relating to the possession of marijuana, and
    Section 11358, relating to the cultivation of marijuana, shall
    not apply to a patient, or to a patient's primary caregiver,
    who possesses or cultivates marijuana for the personal
    medical purposes of the patient upon the written or oral
    recommendation or approval of a physician.<br>
    <br>
    (e) For the purposes of this section, &quot;primary
    caregiver&quot; means the individual designated by the person
    exempted under this act who has consistently assumed
    responsibility for the housing, health, or safety of that
    person.</tt></p>
</blockquote>

<p><tt>Sec. 2. If any provision of this measure or the
application thereof to any person or circumstance is held
invalid, that invalidity shall not affect other provisions or
applications of the measure which can be given effect without the
invalid provision or application, and to this end the provisions
of this measure are severable.<br>
