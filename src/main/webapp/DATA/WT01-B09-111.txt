<B>Project Title:  IUPUI Race Car & NiMH Battery ­ Data Collection<p>

Performing Organization:  Indiana University ­ Purdue University at Indianapolis</B><p>

<P>Technical POC: Gary Burkart, (317) 278­1665</P>

<P><B>Project Summary:</B></P>

<P>The high current application required in racing will provide an excellent method of testing the
batteries and benchmarking NiMH performance versus PbA batteries. Under high current conditions, it is
anticipated that the NiMH batteries will significantly out perform the PbA. A major chassis and battery pack
engineering challenge will be to define a satisfactory thermal management system that is able to keep the
batteries within specified operating temperature. </P>

<P>The objective of the project is to compare the performance of the NiMH battery versus the current PbA battery
used in the race car. The race car will be instrumented and a data acquisition system will monitor race car and
battery pack performance. Data will be uploaded to the Electric/Hybrid Vehicle National Data Center established
by ARPA at the University of Hawaii.</P>

<P>The following advantages are anticipated when PbA batteries are replaced with NiMH batteries: </P>

<UL>
<LI> 10% less battery weight per battery pack, 
<LI> 8% increase in dc voltage per battery pack, 
<LI> equivalent battery pack power, and 
<LI> 100% increase in battery pack energy availability. </UL>

<P>The EV race car will likely experience more that twice the range with NiMH batteries versus PbA batteries. This
provides a substantial advantage and a winning race strategy. </P>

<P>Production processes for the NiMH battery are currently being developed by GM Ovonic. The battery may be
offered for electric/hybrid vehicles and other applications during 1997/98. Currently, prototype batteries are
available for evaluation in appropriate applications. GM Ovonic is particularly interested in high current demand
applications. The race car represents such an application.</P>

<P><B>Project deliverables: </B></P><P>DAS Results and Final Report of Findings</P> 
<P><B>Project Schedule:</B> </P><P><UL>
<LI>Expected to begin May 1, 1996 & continue for 2 yrs.</UL>
