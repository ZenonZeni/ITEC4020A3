The collection of <i>Cannabis </i>hemp germplasm at the Vavilov
Research Institute (VIR) consists of 397 accessions from 3
different eco-geographical groups: Northern, Central and
Southern. Eighty-five collection accessions were sown in
isolation at 4 locations in Russia in 1993 for the purpose of
maintaining the gene pools and replenishing the reserves of seed
for distribution. Sixty accessions yielded from 10 to 2,000 grams
of seed each. The remaining 25 accessions yielded no seeds.<br>

<p> <font size="3"><b>Introduction</b></font></p>

<p> The most important project of the International Hemp
Association is a grant of humanitarian aid to the N. I. Vavilov
Institute of Plant Industry (VIR) in St. Petersburg, Russia. The
VIR was founded in 1924 by plant collector and geneticist N.I.
Vavilov (Fig. 1), one of the first scientists to recognize the
importance of plant genetic resources conservation. The institute
is the longest existing seedbank in the world and houses a
priceless collection of over 400,000 seed accessions.</p>

<p>The Department of Industrial Crops of the VIR maintains the
largest <i>Cannabis</i> germplasm collection in the world. Most
of these accessions are either wild landraces or fiber hemp
varieties, and many of them are found in no other gene banks.
Under normal storage conditions, hemp seeds can be kept for about
5 years before losing viability. Maintaining a <i>Cannabis</i>
collection therefore involves reproducing the accessions at least
once every 5 years. Since the dissolution of the Soviet Union,
the funding of the VIR has dramatically decreased, threatening
the maintenance of its collections. If the <i>Cannabis</i>
accessions of the VIR are not reproduced they will surely become
extinct before their true value is ever realized and utilized.
Especially in light of the renewed interest in <i>Cannabis</i>,
it would be very short-sighted to let this collection die.</p>

<p> In 1993 the VIR, with the sole support of the IHA, began a 4
year program to preserve and evaluate its <i>Cannabis</i>
germplasm. The collection consists of 397 accessions of <i>Cannabis</i>
seeds from three basic eco-geographical groups: Northern, Middle,
and Southern, collected from 16 nations (Table 1). The collection
represents wild and traditional cultivated varieties as well as
products of plant improvement programs. The vast majority of the
accessions are classified as low-THC chemotypes of <i>Cannabis
sativa</i> L. All of the accessions will be reproduced during the
first three years, and in 1996 the entire collection will be
grown in replicate gardens and each accession will be
characterized.</p>

<pre>Two key requirements must be fulfilled before an accession can
be considered adequately reproduced. The primary goal of a germplasm
preservation project is the conservation of the entire gene pool.
It is very important that the population size is large enough
to ensure that nearly all of the genes within the gene pool are
reproduced in the resultant seed. We have set a minimum limit
of 1,000 plants in each population. This should ensure 99% preservation
of the gene pool. The second goal is to reproduce the accession
in sufficient amounts to distribute seed to researchers worldwide.
We have set a minimum limit of 200 grams of seed for storage and
later reproductions. Two hundred grams is approximately 10,000
seeds and will allow 5,000 seeds to be stored in an active collection
for reproduction and 5,000 seeds to be kept in long-term storage.
Seeds can only be released to the research community if more than
200 grams of seed from each accession are held by the VIR.

This paper reports the results obtained in 1993.

<font size="3"><b>Materials and methods</b></font></pre>

<p> Eighty-five accessions of hemp contained in the germplasm
collection of the Department of Industrial Crops at the VIR were
sown with the purpose of germplasm maintenance, replenishment of
seed stocks for distribution, and installation in long-term
storage. The accessions were planted at 4 VIR Experiment Stations
in Russia (Fig. 2): Pavlovsk (59°N) near St. Petersburg,
Ekaterinino (53°N) in Tambov Province, Kuban (44°N) near
Krasnodar, and Volgograd (48°N).</p>

<pre>At the Pavlovsk Experiment Station 15 collection accessions belonging
to the Northern and Central groups were sown in isolated plots.
Each plot contained one hemp accession, the distance between the
plots being 3-4 kilometers.  The accessions were sown according
to their ripening period, with early-ripening varieties planted
nearer to late-ripening varieties to avoid stray pollination.

Agrometeorological conditions during 1993 were unfavorable for
the growth and development of hemp. The spring was late and cold.
Air and soil temperatures in May and early June were lower than
average by 4-5 °C. Because of this the spring sowing was
delayed by 15 days compared to the average sowing date. The plots
were planted on June 10-13. The seed was sown in densely planted
rows spaced 20 cm apart. The size of the plot varied from 8-12
m<sup>2</sup> depending on the number of seeds available.

The absence of rainfall in late May and strong winds dried out
the soil. The first seedlings appeared 10-12 days after sowing
and continued to appear for several days. During the course of
the whole vegetative period the air temperature was well below
average, while the rainfall was above average. Therefore, the
development of the plants was delayed.

Sowing of the seed and maintenance of the plants in the isolation
plots were performed according to the methods developed by the
Department of Industrial Crops. Maintenance of the plots consisted
of hoeing the soil when needed, thinning the rows where seedling
density was too high, weeding, applying fertilizer, removing male
plants after they finished flowering, covering the female plants
with gauze nets at the time of ripening to protect the seeds from
birds, and harvesting of the seed plants.

The remaining 70 collection accessions of the Central and Southern
eco-geographical groups were sown at the Ekaterinino, Kuban and
Volgograd Experiment Stations. At the former two stations accessions
were sown in isolated plots. At the Volgograd Station isolation
was achieved by using wooden and gauze isolation chambers. In
1993 the agrometeorological conditions there were as described
for the Pavlovsk Station, especially the dry and cold spring.
This caused a delay in sowing, sporadic germination of the seeds,
and poor condition of the seedlings. During the course of the
vegetative period the rainfall was 2-3 times the average for many
years. This also impeded the development of the plants.

<font size="3"><b>Results</b></font></pre>

<p> At the Pavlovsk Experiment Station, complete flowering was
observed in early August. Seed formation occurred in late August
and early September. Frosts arrived in the end of September and
the temperature fell to minus 5 °C. These frosts killed the
plants that had not matured and been harvested. Thus out of the
15 collection accessions planted at the Pavlovsk Station, 10
accessions yielded from 10-1,000 grams of mature seed, two
accessions did not ripen, two accessions were stolen, and one
yielded only immature seeds (Table 2).</p>

<pre>Discussion and conclusions</b></font></pre>

<p> In the introduction to this paper we defined two key
requirements which must be fulfilled before an accession can be
considered adequately reproduced: at least 1,000 plants have to
produce a total quantity of at least 200 g of seed.</p>

<pre>Due to poor weather conditions, poor germination, limited space
and theft, only 14 of the 60 accessions reproduced were of sufficient
population size (more than 1,000 plants). Of these 14 accessions
only 10 were reproduced in sufficient quantity to allow distribution
(more than 200 g seed). This means that although 60 of the 85
accessions were reproduced, only 10 were reproduced with sufficient
population size and in sufficient quantity to satisfy our criteria.

Eighty-five <i>Cannabis</i> seed accessions were sown, 60 <i>Cannabis</i>
seed accessions were reproduced, and 10 seed accessions were reproduced
in sufficient quantity for distribution. Although the 1993 <i>Cannabis</i>
germplasm reproductions yielded minimal tangible results, we must
remember that this is the first time any <i>Cannabis</i> reproductions
have been attempted during the confusing period since the dissolution
of the Soviet Union. The extensive VIR system for germplasm preservation
has been partly reactivated and the future is now much brighter.
Our limited success is encouraging, considering that this is only
the first year of the VIR/IHA <i>Cannabis</i> germplasm preservation
project. We feel that the project should certainly be continued.
However, persistence and considerable additional financing will
be required to complete the reproduction and evaluation of the
entire <i>Cannabis</i> germplasm collection of the VIR within
the remaining three years of the project. Only one thing is certain,
we will never succeed if we do not focus our most concerted efforts
on <i>Cannabis</i> germplasm conservation.

<p> In 1994 the VIR and IHA continue their <i>Cannabis</i>
germplasm preservation programme. A third partner, the Italian
ENEA Institute is involved as well. A total of more than 100
accessions has been sown on five locations: Pavlovsk, Ekaterinino
and Kuban in Russia, Ustimovka in Ukraine and Bari in Italy.</p>

<pre>In Russia and Ukraine plant emergence and early growth have been slow due to cold spring wheather, but with the advent of higher summer temperatures crop growth has accelerated.

A detailed report on the results obtained in 1994 will be presented in the next issue of this journal.

Due to inflation in Russia, the costs of the project have doubled in 1994 relative to 1993. Donations to help continue this project are very welcome. Persons or organisations donating US $100 or more to the project will receive a VIR memorial medallion and/or pin and/or a copy of the VIR <i>Cannabis sativa</i> descriptor list, a 34 page booklet in English and Russian.</pre>
