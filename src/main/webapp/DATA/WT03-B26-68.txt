1. ATMOSPHERIC &amp; SCENE BRIGHTNESS VARIATIONS</H4>
Optical, shortwave and thermal image data from airborne and satellite platforms
have varying degrees of angle dependent brightness variation which change
with the sun position, atmospheric conditions, land surface type and sensor
characteristics. If left uncorrected, these broad level variations can make
it difficult to use the data with standard image processing and interpretation
methods.<BR>
<BR>
For example, a Daedalus airborne scanner has a scan angle of &#177;38&#176;
and if flown with the sun at an azimuth away from 'in front' or 'behind'
(i.e. away from the Principal Plane) this will result in significant image
brightness variations created by the atmospheric component phase functions
and any surface angle dependent reflectance effects. The reflectance function
describing the surface effects is the Bi-Directional Reflectance Distribution
Function, or BRDF. These atmospheric and surface effects are present in
all satellite data as well as aerial photography and video data to a greater
or lesser degree depending on the variation in the phase angle between the
sun, target and sensor among the pixels in the resulting image. Topography
enters into the equation in a way that depends on scale (or pixel size)
leading to quite complex variations in an image being scanned as illustrated
in <B><A HREF="brdff1.htm">Figure 1</A> </B>even if the surface type were
homogeneous.<BR>
<BR>
The atmosphere contributes to the total effect partly due to the varying
path length at different parts of the scan and partly to the atmospheric
scattering phase variation described by the composite phase function of
the atmospheric constituents. This describes the way radiation is scattered
out of a volume relative to the direction it enters. In optical remote sensing,
air molecules and aerosols account for much of the scattering and the effects
are greatest at shorter wavelengths. Hence, if the aerosol atmospheric turbidity
is high, the atmospheric brightening in (say) the blue-green will be visible
and significant in most remotely sensed data. In the thermal bands, the
angular variation is almost all due to the changing path length and the
major atmospheric effect is due to water vapour on the path.<BR>
<BR>
The land surface contributes to the broad level brightness variations common
to all remotely sensed images. The base 'colour' and brightness is a function
of the spectral properties of the material types making up the scene (e.g.
leaf reflectances and transmittances or soil grain mineralogy) plus structural
effects which give rise to the angular variations. The angular effects can
be ascribed to three main factors - the volume effect, the occlusion (or
hotspot) effect and the specular or glint effect: 
<UL>
<LI><B>Volume Effect</B>: Because of the changes in path lengths and extinction
in complex surfaces as the relative sun and look angles change, there is
a volume BRDF which has some similarity to the atmospheric phase function
induced variations. It will depend on surface structure and in vegetation
it depends on factors like leaf density variations and angle distributions
as well as total leaf area. 
<LI><B>Occlusion Effect</B>: The occlusion effect is a more specific effect
induced by the fact that the shadows cast by the sun represent parts of
the surface that are not 'seen' by the sun. The areas that are not 'seen'
by the sensor which are also not 'seen' by the sun are the common areas
between shadow cast by the sun if it were in the two positions. The varying
overlap induces a brightness variation as when the sun and sensor are aligned,
no shadows are 'seen' and the scene seems bright and when the look angle
is opposite to the sun many shadows are 'seen' leading to lower brightness.
<LI><B>Specular (or Glint) Effect</B>: The specular or glint effect is most
pronounced on water surfaces. It refers to the surface 'mirror' (or Fresnel)
reflectance in which the radiation is usually unaltered by the surface material
from which it is reflected. On land surfaces it is a composite of reflections
diffused from facets of varying angular positions and specularity. In Australia,
Eucalypt leaves are especially specularly reflective due to their waxy coating.
On water, glint is probably the major component of the BRDF and the hotspot
effect does not occur. 
</UL>
The sum of these effects in remotely sensed data is an image brightness
variation that is a sum of the atmospheric brightness and the scene brightness.
The atmospheric and surface effects also interact to provide a composite
effect that varies with sun, target &amp; sensor geometry. The effects are
more obvious in aerial photography and video images where the central perspective
means that at high sun angles the hotspot and specular points are within
the angular radius of the frame. For airborne scanners and satellite borne
scanners it is possible to avoid the brightest hotspot and glint points
by careful consideration of the scan geometry but since the variations are
significant for all angles the effects cannot be ignored in any image.<BR>
<BR>
The scene and atmospheric brightness variations are all minimised for a
scanner if the sensor data are scanned at right angles to the 'principal
plane'. The principal plane is the plane formed by the vectors joining the
earths centre to the sensor and to the sun. For an airborne scanner, this
means flying level, with the sun in front or behind the flight line. If
the hotspot or specular points need to be avoided at high sun times, the
scanning sensor is sometimes tilted forward or back to ensure it. These
'avoiding' strategies are not easily used with photography or video images.<BR>
