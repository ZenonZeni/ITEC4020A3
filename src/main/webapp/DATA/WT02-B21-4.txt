GRANT NUMBER: H180G30027 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  6/01/93 <br>
ENDING DATE:  5/30/96<P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  This project will conduct research into the benefits of
electronically-enhanced text
for mainstreamed students who are hard-of-hearing.<P>

METHOD:  Participating students (N=77) will be provided with Macintosh PowerBooks
containing electronically-enhanced versions of their classroom textbooks. Short-term
effects of
electronically-enhanced reading materials on the comprehension of content-area
materials and
academic achievement in regular classes will be assessed, as will the long-term effects
on the
literacy skills, academic achievement, and psychosocial development of students who
are
hard-of-hearing.  Additional research will explore the extent to which environmental
factors
effect
and are effected by the use of enhanced reading materials among such students.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  It is anticipated that this technology will greatly enhance
students'
abilities to read and comprehend text from content area materials by supporting their
literacy
needs unobtrusively, thereby maximizing their chances for success in least restrictive
environments.  Technical reports will be written on each phase of the project.  Articles
will be
written for publication in technology-oriented, content-area, language arts, and special
education
publications.  Presentations will also be made at national conferences.<P>

<b>Project CONNECT: Content-Area-Literacy Networked Notetaking for Exceptional
Children
and Teachers</b><br>

GRANT NUMBER: H180G40066 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  6/01/94 <br>
ENDING DATE:  5/31/97<P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  The project will research the benefits of synchronous notetaking strategies
using
portable laptop computers and a wireless network.<P>

METHOD:  Participating students will be selected from three populations for whom
notetaking
in
regular content area classes is often difficult: students with learning disabilities,
students with
severe hearing impairments, and students with severe upper extremity dysfunction.  All
participating students will be provided with Macintosh PowerBooks for regular class
notetaking
and will be assisted by trained notetakers using the same equipment.  These laptop
computers
will
be linked wirelessly and together they will create notes from class presentations and
discussions
using synchronous writing software.  Data will be gathered to (1) uncover the specific
notetaking
strategies most important for different types of students, (2) determine effective ways
for
students
to manipulate and use the notes for studying outside of class, and (3) explore ways to
increase
students' independence and personal responsibility for the notetaking process.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  A technical report will be written at the end of each
project year
describing and summarizing the results of research efforts to date.  Researchers have
arranged for
the provision of the software used at a discounted price to schools along with project
training
materials and a descriptive videotape.  Findings will also be submitted to professional
publications
and presented at conferences on state, regional, and national levels. <P>

<b>Examination of the Effectiveness of a Functional Approach to the Delivery of
Assistive
Technology Services in Schools</b><br>

GRANT NUMBER: H180U50025 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  8/01/95 <br>
ENDING DATE:  7/31/96<P>

ABSTRACT<P>
PURPOSE:  This project will examine the impact of the use of a
recently-conceptualized
unifying
model of human function to guide the development and delivery of assistive technology
services
in
public schools.<P>

METHOD:  The functional model to be used focuses on identification of demands that
are placed
on an individual from the environment and the functional responses that are required to
respond
to those demands.  Functional responses are made within the context of personal
perceptions, the
available personal resources, and the external supports (including assistive
technologies) that can
be provided.  Research will be conducted to identify commercially-available assistive
technology
assessment instruments and development of specifications for assistive technology
assessment
protocols.  Research will also conduct an initial comparison of assistive technology
information
systems, and procedures will be developed for researching other identified information
systems. 
Procedures will be developed for conducting research on interaction analyses occurring
during
assistive technology IEP meetings, as well as procedures for guiding the evaluation of
assistive
technology effectiveness.  Project staff will develop instrumentation for conducting
critical
incident studies to determine the competencies needed by those who are involved in
delivering
assistive technology services.  Initial training materials, procedures for evaluating their
effectiveness, and guidelines for providing training for those who will be implementing
the
policies
and procedures will be developed.  Baseline information about existing assistive 
technology
policies and procedures will be collected as well.  A variety of qualitative and
quantitative
research methodologies will be employed to answer key research questions, including
survey
research, case studies, single subject research, critical incident studies, interviews,
direct
observation, and evaluation research.  Following comparison of this baseline data with
research
findings based on assessment of outcomes among students receiving these technology
services,
the final summer of the project will be devoted to analysis of project effectiveness and
preparation
of the final report.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  Project findings will be presented at state and national
conferences, and an article reporting on research comparing software packages will be
prepared
for publication in a professional journal.  A document of Guidelines for Providing
Assistive
Technology Services in Schools will be generated, to include a description of what was
learned
as
a result of various project investigations.  A manual will also be developed for each of
the
screening and assessment procedures used in the project.  Screening and assessment
devices will
also be discussed in a series of reports for consumers.<P>

<b>A Computerized Assessment Environment to Promote Literacy in Assessment for 
Individuals
with Disabilities</b><br>

GRANT NUMBER: H180G50015 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  3/01/95 <br>
ENDING DATE:  2/28/98<P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  The project will conduct the second phase of research to (1) assess the
overall
efficiency and desirability of a computerized testing environment for individuals with
disabilities,
and (2) to systematically investigate the effects of specific modifications on test
performance of
students with disabilities, with the goal of improving the performance on tests and
increased
inclusion of students in district assessment performances.<P>

METHOD:  In Phase I of this research, 53 special education teachers and related
service
personnel were surveyed to determine the most common problems that special
education students
have in taking tests and the most common modifications used.  Data from this phase
will be
incorporated into Phase II analysis, and software developed as a result of this research
will be
used in Phase II experiments.  After Phase I research is used to identify tests and test
items
currently in use that can be used in a computerized testing environment for assessing
students
with disabilities, staff will investigate the effectiveness and suitability of the
computerized
testing
environment for administering tests and delivering test modifications for students with
disabilities. 
The effects of specific computer-delivered modifications on test performance of
students with
specific disabilities will be systematically investigated.  Finally, data will be evaluated in
preparation for dissemination of results, including suggestions for continuing
experimental
comparison of  performance on computerized modified tests with traditional test
administration
procedures, both modified and unmodified.  The computerized assessment
environment will be
field-tested in four diverse special education departments representing different
geographic,
demographic, and administrative characteristics.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  Results of research will be disseminated in two reports
and also
through publication and presentation of research results.  The first report will contain a
description of the project design, a description of prototype software design, and a
project
evaluation section.  The second report will be written for school district management
personnel,
and will outline the costs and benefits of using the model for student assessment and
test
development.<P>

<b>An Interactive MultiMedia Approach to Teacher Training Designed to Reduce the
Gap
Between
Research and Practice</b><br>

GRANT NUMBER: H023B50025 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  7/15/95 <br>
ENDING DATE:  7/14/96<P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  The project will develop and validate an interactive hypermedia training
program to
train teachers in one complex teaching practice: the Concept Mastery Routine
(CMR).<P>

METHOD:  Once information gathered from a literature review and consultations with
expert
trainers and teachers has been compiled, project staff will develop a refined version of
the
Interactive Hypermedia Program (IHP) that will maximize teachers' choice in learning,
and
hopefully increase  teachers' understanding and ability to implement the CMR in their
classrooms. 
Text and graphic displays will be collected, as will audio segments from teachers
commenting on
their use of the CMR with students. Additional audio will provide a running commentary
and
narration to accompany text and graphic displays.  Video segments will illustrate correct
usage of
CMR with students, and will be designed to clarify, elaborate, and extend the
information
provided in text and graphic displays.  An intervention study (yet to be designed) will
focus on
comparing the effectiveness of the IHP to a traditional teacher training program in terms
of
impact on teacher knowledge and behavior.  Sets of 30 experimental and control
teachers will
complete questionnaires and pre- and post-tests of CMR understanding.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  It is anticipated that development of the Interactive
Hypermedia
Program for training teachers in a complex instructional practice will provide a viable
solution to
bridge research to practice.  Descriptions of the project, position papers, and research
reports will
be written by project staff for publication in regular and special education journals.  The
possibility of presenting findings at national and state education conferences will also
be
pursued.<P>

<b>Assistive Technology in the Cognitive Realm: Tools for Daily Living</b><br>

GRANT NUMBER: H180T40053 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  1/01/95 <br>
ENDING DATE: 12/31/97<P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  The project will utilize existing technologies to assist a group of
adolescents and
young adults with cognitive impairments to use technology to "work around" their
cognitive
limitations in terms of remembering and implementing metacognitive routines.<P>

METHOD:  This project will develop and implement a series of software modules to
help users
access relevant information and knowledge to improve the quality of their life in the
community;
develop skills for exercising increased personal autonomy in decision making; manage
day-to-day
living situations and challenges; and promote the development of increasingly
sophisticated
problem-solving strategies.  Students aged 17-21 will be nominated by teachers for
participation
in the project.  Interviews with subjects will examine their interests and needs so
software
packages can be tailored to meet these needs.  Field testing will focus on the
refinement of the
graphic user interface, the user/prompt interaction sequences, and the kind of training
needed to
support users in their initial phases of learning and ongoing interaction with the system. 
Project
evaluation will rely on the use of multiple methods including qualitative and quantitative
techniques for data collection and analysis.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  The project's creation of innovative tools using varied and
integrated media and materials should enable individuals with disabilities to achieve the
outcomes
expected of all students, such as independence, productivity, and a quality of life that
promotes
equity in opportunity.  The process will also enable the learner across environments by
fostering
the creation of state-of-the-art instructional environments both within and outside school
settings.<P>

<b>Developing Technology, Media and Materials to Enhance Student
Self-Determination
Within Transition Planning</b><br>

GRANT NUMBER: H180A40071 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  7/01/94 <br>
ENDING DATE:  6/30/97 <P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  The project will enhance the utilization of a transition planning strategy that
incorporates a self-determination process as a foundation through the development of
computer
software, broadcast quality video tapes, and a wide array of materials.<P>

METHOD:  The three basic steps of this project will include the development of
appropriate
technology, materials, and media to support a transition planning strategy that
enhances student
self-determination within the IEP process, training a large sample of stakeholders on
how to use
the strategy, and training potential users and trainers of the strategy on how to use the
transition
planning strategy and its supporting materials.  The achievement of student
self-determination
within the IEP process requires that students must: (1) forecast their long-range goals
and
anticipate how to reach them; (2) be able to learn their own strengths and weaknesses;
and (3)
have a workable strategy for using this information themselves.  This approach should
be
supported by effective materials including technology and effective media supports.  In
order to
meet these conditions, project staff will focus on a strong foundation of work in: (1)
teaching
adolescents with disabilities how to build a sense of self-empowerment; (2) developing
assessment
instruments in areas that pertain to transition; and (3) designing programs and
developing
materials that improve transition services in local communities.  Student self-evaluation
will
include such areas of potential student achievement as academic skills, vocational
skills,
independent living skills, and personal/social skills.  While teaching self-evaluation
practices to
students with disabilities through modifications of the Transition Skills Inventory, staff
will
develop procedures for negotiating differences of opinion, and will review other relevant
standardized tests.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  This project will result in a series of training materials,
software
for a computerized management information system to support the overall strategy, and
a set of
objectives and tasks for addressing high priority program standards over the course of a
year.<P>

<b>Telecommunications for All</b><br>

GRANT NUMBER: H180J30025 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  8/01/93 <br>
ENDING DATE:  7/31/96<P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  This project will develop systems for the assistive technology application of
telecommunications for deaf children.<P>

METHOD:  Off-the-shelf and emerging communications technology will be tailored for
improved
access by children in school environments, and staff will develop systems, materials,
and
activities
that enable and encourage telephone use based on the developmental level of the
child.  The
project will begin with a needs assessment conducted at the schools, a survey of
materials and
curricula from other schools, and a review of all candidate products.  A preliminary
design of at
least one system for providing an array of technologies at one site will be developed,
followed by
review by a panel of experts.  The system will be assembled and software written to
integrate the
components, provide a user-friendly interface, and to provide tutorials and other
information. 
The
prototype system will initially be tested at schools closest to the research system, and
then placed
farther away as system reliability is established.  The system will be evaluated for cost,
reliability,
technical support required, ease of use, training requirements, and impact on children's
abilities
to
use visual telecommunications.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  The systems and materials generated will result in
greater
program accessibility and appropriateness for deaf children, use of telecommunications
at earlier
ages, and an accelerated program of instruction on visual telecommunications
compared to the
present case.<P>

technology activities, transition services, staff development, family participation,
administration,
community involvement, and policy development.  During the study, ECCTS will focus
on
integrated classrooms, children, staff, families, community schools, and state agencies
with
interests in assistive technology experiences for young children. Thirty-five 3- and
4-year-olds
with moderate to severe disabilities that prevent them from interacting effectively with
objects,
people, and events in their environment will be the primary subjects.  They are spread
across 12
classrooms, each of which has a special education teacher and an early childhood
teacher in
conjunction with support staff.  Tested procedures and materials will be adapted for
model
projects focusing on elements of the ECCTS system. Data to be gathered across the
major
components will include informally gathered pre- and post-test measures, observation,
interviews,
examination of records and materials, analysis of videotapes, content analysis, focus
groups, and
other methods.  Component I data will specifically include records and videotapes of
classroom
activities as well as individual child behaviors, dyads, and small groups functioning
during
curricular activities.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  Study results will provide the field with information on the
most
effective strategies in terms of developing comprehensive technology systems that
mesh with
delivery systems.  Awareness information on the project will be disseminated through
news
releases, television and radio, journal publications, electronic bulletin boards, and
presentations
during local, regional, and national presentations.<P>

<b>Science Education for Secondary Students with Severe Orthopedic Impairments
Using
Virtual
Reality</b><br>

GRANT NUMBER: H180T40100 <br>
BEGINNING DATE: 10/01/94 <br>
ENDING DATE:  9/30/96<P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  This project will develop and program three-dimensional virtual reality (VR)
scenarios to be implemented in science classrooms containing one or more students
who would
otherwise be prevented from experiencing hands-on science education due to
orthopedic
impairments.<P>

METHOD:  Staff will work closely with science teachers at selected secondary schools
to
identify
specific units within the existing curriculum from which students with severe orthopedic
impairments are excluded due to their physical limitations.  Following development of
appropriate
VR scenarios, half of the regular class (including orthopedically impaired students) will
conduct
experiments or perform activities using the VR system, while the other half of the class
performs
these tasks in the usual way.  Analyses will compare mean scores between the groups
(to
measure
instructional validity) and between orthopedically impaired students and their peers (to
insure
adequate progress within the curriculum).  Project staff will thus identify principles
underlying
the
use of VR to provide modified science activities and materials and to ensure meaningful
student
participation, meanwhile validating that the VR materials ensure adequate student
progress in
inclusive settings.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  A technical report will be written at the end of each year
summarizing the results of evaluation efforts to that date.  A manual for implementing
the
strategies found to be effective in this project will be written, with special emphasis on
guidelines
for implementing the program in public schools.  Project staff will write articles for
submission
to
professional publications for both scholarly and practitioner-oriented audiences.  Project
findings
will also be presented at key relevant conferences at state, regional and national
levels.<P>

<b>Integrating Speech Recognition Into the Classroom Interpreting Services of
Mainstream Deaf
and
Hard-of-Hearing Students</b><br>

GRANT NUMBER: H180A40006 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  9/01/94 <br>
ENDING DATE:  9/30/97<P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  This project will develop techniques for integrating speech recognition
within the
sign language interpreting process, develop a training program and materials for
teaching
interpreters to use these techniques, and set up a nationwide "training-the-trainer"
program to
disseminate these techniques.<P>

METHOD:  Staff will first meet with Montgomery County Public School (MCPS)
administrators
to plan activities, select MCPS interpreters (N=4) and high school students with
deafness (N=4)
to participate, and select topic areas and classes.  Staff will then obtain the
DragonDictate speech
recognition system as well as more advanced models (N=4), consisting of computers,
sound
capture boards, headsets, and a software package.  Staff will also obtain copies of
each of the
high
school textbooks used by MCPS in classes related to the selected topic.  The index and
glossary
words from these textbooks will be checked against the words in the speech recognition
system;
any words not in the system will be added.  Once all equipment has been installed,
participating
MCPS interpreters will train on the systems, and will help analyze classroom
interpreting to
determine strengths and weaknesses.  Once basic techniques have been defined, a
mock
classroom
learning situation will be conducted to allow participating interpreters and students to
practice
interpreting.  Techniques and procedures developed by participants will then be
evaluated for a
total of 20 hours under actual classroom conditions including non-participating students
(N=30)
and a teacher.  Once techniques have been approved, staff will develop materials and
a training
program for teaching interpreters to use speech recognition in class.  Staff will then
develop a
"training the trainer" program to teach people how to use the training program in other
classrooms and in different subjects.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  At least two journal articles will be submitted by the
project
staff. 
Staff will develop training materials for teaching classroom interpreters to use speech
recognition. 
As a result of this project, interpreters (N=60) will be trained to use speech recognition,
with
special instruction on teaching others to use it.<P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  The project will demonstrate and evaluate uses of interactive video as a
means of
increasing literacy development and interest among deaf and hard-of-hearing
students.<P>

METHOD:  The project will use Thurston's START model, which indicates that Support,
Time,
Access, Resources and Training are all necessary for the successful implementation of
innovation
in the classroom.  An additional teacher empowerment model will emphasize extensive
teacher
control of the implementation process and extensive teacher involvement in decision
making. 
Four programs - two residential schools and two public school programs - will
participate in the
3-year project. Each program will select a team of teachers and administrators for
participation,
and participants will be involved in all phases of the project, including preparation,
training,
curriculum development, support, implementation, institutionalization, dissemination,
and
evaluation.  Year One will focus on uses of captioned movies available on existing
videodiscs. 
Year Two will expand uses of interactive video to materials developed by teachers and
students
in
project sites.  Year Three will focus on shifting from the external to internal support for
interactive video, on conducting a summative evaluation, and disseminating results at
regional
and
national levels.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  Outcomes will include: (1) a data based, empirical
description of
the process by which interactive video was implemented in programs for deaf and
hard-of-hearing
students; (2) descriptions of contextual variables and student characteristics that may
influence
the
success of implementing interactive video in the classroom; (3) a model of successful
implementation based on these descriptions; (4) curricular materials for interactive
video
instruction; and (5) a video record of the implementation process, potentially for future
use in
training others for replication.<P>

ENDING DATE:  9/30/98<P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  This project will investigate the effect of captioned instructional television
for
students in special education and students with limited English proficiency enrolled in
college
preparatory classes.<P>

METHOD:  Using a multiple phase research strategy, the study will address the
following
questions: (1) Does captioning provide cognitive benefits for college age students with
learning
disabilities or students with limited English proficiency? (2) Does captioning provide
affective
benefits for college-age students with learning disabilities or students with limited
English
proficiency? (3) Is there a differential benefit (either cognitive or affective) for captioning
for
students with learning disabilities as compared to students with limited English
proficiency? and
(4) What are the optimal conditions for implementing captioning in a community college
setting?
A minimum of two intact classes (one focusing on students with learning disabilities,
one
focusing
on students with limited English proficiency) will be selected each year for full qualitative
and
quantitative data collection at Miami-Dade Community College.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  In addition to the knowledge and understanding gained

<b>Development of a Personal Caption Display Prototype to Benefit Students Who Are
Deaf</b><br>

GRANT NUMBER: H180J30040 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  6/01/93 <br>
ENDING DATE:  5/31/96<P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  This project will develop a prototype personal caption display system that
could be
worn by students who are deaf.<P>

METHOD:  This system would use a set of special eyeglasses to provide a caption
display. The
glasses would be battery operated and would receive captions via a wireless link;
captions
themselves would be viewed in the lens, and the optical design would be such that the
caption
would appear to be projected onto a distant screen or other object.  This imaging would
save
users from having to refocus their vision to read captions.  While the primary application
of this
technology will be to provide captions for lecture portions of a lesson, further
applications for
captioning television, movies and other media are also foreseen.  In addition, by using
several
transmission frequencies, this technology could be used to simultaneously provide
captions in
multiple languages.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  Development and testing of this system could be a major
breakthrough in captioning technology, providing a personal-level solution to many
common
captioning problems.  With the development of such a wearable personal caption
system, other
major sources of aural communication would become more equally accessible to deaf
persons.<P>

GRANT NUMBER: H180E30021 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  9/01/93 <br>
ENDING DATE:  8/31/96<P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:   The project will expand the use of a promising educational technology and
conduct
a comprehensive evaluation of its implementation and its efficacy with students who are
deaf,
students who are hard of hearing, and students with learning disabilities.<P>

METHOD:  In 1991, WGBH developed a captioning workstation for students.  In the
current
project, applications of that workstation will be furthered explored with more than a
dozen
teachers and their students at six schools.  Students will use video as a stimulus for
facilitating
comprehension of content, generating ideas and language, and supporting short-term
memory;
using a work processor, they will write text that matches or enhances the video; finally,
they will
superimpose their text over the video, resulting in a captioned videotape, which
reinforces
learning.  In collaboration with project staff, each teacher will establish specific
language and
literacy goals for the students and develop appropriate captioning activities to
accomplish those
goals.  Project staff from the National Technical Institute for the Deaf will evaluate the
project
from several perspectives: student performance on a variety of measures; attitudes of
teachers,
students and administrators toward learning and using the technology within the
curriculum; and
implementation issues.  Evaluation results will inform use of the technology during the
project
period and after.  Participating schools will include both special and integrated settings. 
Students
in K- 12 will participate; they will be deaf and hard of hearing, or have a
language-based learning
disability.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:   Project findings will be disseminated through traditional
outreach
channels as well as via a comprehensive teachers's manual and demonstration
videotape. 
Captioning software for the PC will also be available.<P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  This project will examine and demonstrate how individualizing the
closed-caption
prompt rate, manipulated to match each student's reading level and comprehension
reading rate,
can be a successful technological reading approach.<P>

METHOD:  A cluster equivalent materials design comprised of two groups of 4th-grade
students
who are mildly disabled and nondisabled in two classroom environments (inclusive and
noninclusive) will participate in a limited pilot study and a full-scale study for 1 academic
year. 
These groups of students will receive alternate treatments of: (1) digital video
interactive
materials with individualized prompt rate; and (2) closed-captioned videotapes with no

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  This project will design, develop, and test an innovative software
architecture to
provide a significant improvement in access by users with visual impairments to
graphically-based
software.<P>

METHOD:  This project will use an innovative multiple task approach for converting the
graphic
screen to speech or Braille.  A new computer standard called Object Linking and
Embedding
(OLE) will be used to enable one program to communicate with another. OLE will
provide the
means for access software to communicate directly with application programs instead
of
simulating or modeling the actions of the operating system.  The OLE Graphical User
Interface
Descriptive Environment (OLE GUIDE) will attempt to provide good access to the
Microsoft
Chicago Operating System.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  Through this adapted access to the Chicago system,
users with
visual impairments will be given access to line charts, bar graphs, and pie charts, as
well as other
graphic components of computer applications.  The publication of a monthly "OLE
GUIDE
Progress Report" will outline the project's ongoing problems, solutions and findings. 
This report
will be available via Internet and will also be used to maintain lines of communication
with
Microsoft, field staff at the American University, and other interested parties.  Papers on
the
progress of the project will be presented at leading conferences dealing with the
interests of
people with disabilities and will be submitted for publication in relevant professional
journals.<P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  The project will conduct a nationwide study of the ways special educators
use
technology, media, and materials to promote literacy among children with
disabilities.<P>

METHOD:  This study will seek to answer the following questions: (1) What is the state
of
practice in the use of technology to promote literacy for children with disabilities? (2)
What are
effective and innovative strategies for using technology to promote literacy? and (3)
What kinds
of information do special educators use to determine which technology to use to
promote literacy
and when to use them? A research design using Computer Assisted Telephone
Interview (CATI)
technology and case studies will solicit information from special education teachers,
administrators, and higher education faculty about what technologies they use and how;
which
technologies they feel are effective in promoting literacy; and what sources of
information they
use to learn about such technologies.  The overall CATI survey will reach 2,200
educators
nationwide.  Case studies of seven school districts which use technology to promote
literacy in
special education programs will provide real-world examples to deepen descriptive
statistical
data
gathered through the survey.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  Results of the survey and case studies will be translated
into
three
informational products: a research report, a photo essay, and a computer-based
presentation. 
Products will be distributed to the original survey participants, who will again be
interviewed
through CATI to find out if they read the information, what they thought of it, and how
they
might have used it.<P>

<b>The Personal Communicator: Empowering Deaf Learners in Social Interactions</b>

GRANT NUMBER: H180J30013 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  8/16/93 <br>
ENDING DATE:  8/15/96<P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  This project will enable deaf students to communicate better with their
peers,
teachers, and other associates, deaf or hearing, using a portable, multimedia
communication
device called the "personal communicator."<P>

METHOD:  A case study approach will be used over a 2-year period to provide an
in-depth
analysis of the application of the personal communicator" on Macintosh PowerBooks
and
next-generation computers referred to as Personal Digital Assistants with deaf children
at
elementary through secondary school levels.  Videotapes of randomly selected
classroom periods
at 2-month intervals will be analyzed to assess the frequency and content of social
interactions
between deaf and hearing students and between deaf students and hearing teachers. 
In addition,
researchers will assess attitudes toward integration of all hearing teachers and hearing
classmates
of deaf subjects, by randomly sampling written dialogue entries between dyad members
to also
assess written language competency.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  The "personal communicator" is designed to impact deaf
subjects'
social interactions with hearing classmates and teachers in participating classrooms. 
Social
integration skills learned through the use of the "personal communicator" are likely to
generalize
to situations outside the classroom.  Teacher and student attitudes toward integration
are likely to
improve when deaf students demonstrate positive social interactions.<P>

<b>Development and Evaluation of a Computer-Aided Speech-to-Print Transcription
System</b><br>

GRANT NUMBER: H180J30011 <br>
BEGINNING DATE: 12/01/93 <br>
ENDING DATE: 11/30/96<P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  This project will develop and evaluate a real-time speech-to-print
transcription
system that can be employed as a support system for deaf students.<P>

METHOD:  The system will use a hearing transcriber and a computer program to
convert speech
into print as the words are being spoken.  The system will provide a real-time text
display that
the
student can read to understand what is being said in a classroom.  In addition, the text
file stored
in the computer can be examined by students, tutors and instructors by reading the
computer
monitor or a hard-copy printout.  The system will use a laptop computer and common
word
processing software, as well as procedures for "compressing" or reducing the text when
speech
becomes rapid.  Following refinement of the basic system, the package will be
evaluated in the
classroom through: (1) evaluation of technical performance, (2) questionnaire of users,
(3)
in-depth interviews, (4) study of operators' use of the system, and (5) study of the
system in
implementation at the secondary level.  Operators and other personnel will be trained in
key
procedures, and operator training procedures will be refined and evaluated.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  This project will produce a field-tested and validated
system to
create computerized text files of classroom speech, which will not only serve the needs
of deaf
and hard-of-hearing students, but also create documentation for many other uses.  The
system
also has potential to facilitate the communication of deaf persons in work settings and
could be
useful for other groups of students, such as students with learning disabilities.<P>

BEGINNING DATE:  9/01/93 <br>
ENDING DATE:  8/31/96 <P>

ABSTRACT <P>

PURPOSE:  The purpose of this project is twofold: (1) to identify hearing loss in children
with
already confirmed disabilities using traditional audiometric screening and assessment
procedures
combined with recently developed technology using Transient Evoked Otoacoustic
Emissions
(TEOAE) testing; and (2) to compare the sensitivity and specificity of traditional
screening
programs with TEOAE testing programs in a group of normal children and a group of
children
identified as having one or more disabilities.<P>

METHOD:  Approximately 750 students between the ages of 5 and 7 who are currently
classified
with one or more disabilities will be screened for possible hearing loss using TEOAE
and
traditional audiometric procedures.  The TEOAE testing procedure allows for a quick,
noninvasive test of cochlear function without assistance from the person being
evaluated, and
thus
is expected to allow for early detection among children with developmental disabilities in
particular. <P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  The project will result in: (1) sensitivity and specificity
measures
of traditional pure tone screenings as compared to TEOAE screenings; (2) a
cost-effectiveness
comparison of TEOAE procedures and traditional audiometric screening techniques; (3)
recommendations for use of TEOAE with various degrees and types of developmental
disabilities
in children; (4) an analysis of demographic variables contributing to delayed
identification of
hearing loss among children confirmed as hearing-impaired; (5) data regarding the
perceived
utility of TEOAE to identify children with hearing loss in school settings; and (6) a
videotape
and
procedural manual.<P>

<b>Teaching Workplace Literacy</b><br>

GRANT NUMBER: H180G40079 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  1/01/95 <br>
ENDING DATE: 12/31/97<P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  This project will articulate how interactive instruction can be used to foster
higher
order thinking and how cooperative learning, specifically the group investigation
method, will
promote interpersonal skills development for secondary students with learning
disabilities. <P>

METHOD:  The first study will examine the effects of the interactive instructional model
on
higher order thinking in mathematics.  Relying on a mastery of basic mathematical
concepts,
students will use elementary spreadsheet skills to calculate averages, determine trends
in data,
and
ask "what if" questions.  The second study will build on Study 1 by linking math problem
solving
to expository writing.  Again, the interactive instructional model will be used.  The third
study
will
shift focus from higher order thinking to interpersonal skill development, examining the
integration of mathematical problem solving and expository writing in the context of
cooperative
learning. The final study will be an evaluation of our interactive instruction and
cooperative
learning practices to teaching workplace literacy at Phase 1 of secondary schools.  This
study
will
occur in mainstreamed classroom settings and will closely examine how the systematic
research
conducted earlier in experimental conditions translates into actual practice.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  The main product of this project will be the Integrated
Learning
Curriculum, containing exercises for integrating mathematical problem solving,
expository
writing, and strategies for structuring cooperative learning groups for this kind of
instruction. 
This material will be designed explicitly for practitioners and inservice courses. 
Instructional
vignettes will also be recorded on videotape for further dissemination.<P>

<b>Computer-Assisted Cooperative Learning in Mathematics in Integrated Classrooms
for
Students
with and without Disabilities</b><br>

GRANT NUMBER: H023N40027 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  9/01/94 <br>
ENDING DATE:  8/31/96<P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  The project will analyze the effects of computer-assisted cooperative
learning in
mathematics instruction within integrated educational settings.<P>

METHOD:  In the first project year, heterogeneous students (including regular
education and
students with mild disabilities) in integrated classrooms will be grouped to learn math
with the
help of computer technology in class.  A commercial computer software package will be
used to
teach math concepts, computation, applications and problem solving.  Effects of
cooperative
learning will be examined by comparing this instructional method with traditional
whole-class
teaching and learning.  Subjects will include 120 5th-grade students, 30 of whom have
disabilities. 
Six math teachers will be randomly assigned either to cooperative learning or
whole-class
instruction.  In the second project year, computer-assisted math learning methods will
be used for
160 5th-grade students, of whom 40 have disabilities, in integrated classrooms.  Effects
of
cooperative learning with computer-assisted instruction compared to an individual
learning
method will be measured.  A pre-post test comparison group design with students
nested within
teachers will be used.  Outcome measures will assess students' math achievement,
attitudes
toward math and computer-assisted curricula, and social relationships among students
in the
integrated classrooms.  In addition, interviews will be conducted with the students with
disabilities
to investigate their attitudes and feelings in the class.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  Project staff will present study results at a regional
conference
for
regular education and special education teachers and practitioners.  Results will also be
presented
in at least two national conferences for professionals in math education and special
education. 
Furthermore, project findings will be published in journals addressing both research and
practical
applications.  Consultation will also be provided to local regular and special education
teachers
based on the procedures used and the results obtained in the studies.<P>

<b>Pathways for Learning</b><br>

GRANT NUMBER: H180A40069 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  6/01/94 <br>
ENDING DATE:  5/31/97<P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  This project will develop, demonstrate, evaluate, and disseminate effective
organizational support and professional development strategies that promote the
effective use of
technology, media, and materials (TMM) to improve learning outcomes for students with
disabilities in grades 1-8.<P>

METHOD:  Within the project approach, regular and special education teachers across
grade
levels (e.g., grades 1-3, 4-6, or 6-8) will form a Pathway Team. As a team they will
design,
implement, and evaluate curricula that span their grade levels, focus on outcomes that
revolve
around building deep understanding and communication, and integrate a variety of
TMM
applications to meet student needs.  A designated group of students, including those
with
cognitive, physical, sensory, and emotional disabilities will be included in the pathways. 
As a
group, these students will travel from one teacher on a Pathway Team to another
through
successive grades, provided with the technology they need to make all transitions
smooth.  Over
the 3 project years, staff will carry out a formative evaluation to gather evidence about
the
success
of the components, problems that arise, and repertoires of solutions devised.  Staff
members will
collect all data through observations of meetings and classroom instruction, interviews,
and
collection of work samples, as well as videotaping the progress of selected students. 
Intervention
efforts will combine organizational support and professional development, consisting of
three
structures to promote collaborative work among stakeholders: a district-wide
Coordinating
Committee, School Management Groups, and school-based Pathway Teams of
teachers. 
Electronic networks, video conferences, and print materials will support the work of
these three
structures.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  As a result of this project, district administrators will
develop an
understanding of cooperation between stakeholders, a cadre of facilitators will be
created that can
promote change throughout school districts, and regular and special education teachers
will more
easily work together in collaborative Pathway Teams.<P>

Materials in the Provision of Education and Related Services to Children and Youth with
Disabilities</b><br>

GRANT NUMBER: H180N20013 <br>
BEGINNING DATE: 10/01/92 <br>
ENDING DATE:  9/30/97<P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  This project has two goals: (1) to collect, analyze, validate, and extend
extant
research regarding effective and efficient use of TMM to improve outcomes for children
and
youth with disabilities; and (2) to provide access to research and promote its used by
practitioners
so that they may better meet the educational and related service needs of children and
youth with
disabilities.<P>

METHOD:  A Delphi method will be employed with key stakeholders from each of
several
disability groups to identify priorities for that group.  Based on these findings, staff will
select
topics for review and dissemination and revise the strategic plan accordingly.  For each
topic
identified, research leaders, with input from others in their area of expertise, will
synthesize
extant
research literature.  Based on the strength and consistency of research findings, project
staff will
carry out one or more follow-up activities to validate and extend the findings.  Among
follow-up
methods to be employed will be telephone surveys, focus group sessions, on-site field
visits,
video
conferences with facilitated discussion at designated download sites, and
commissioned research
that extends ongoing research efforts.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  Formats for dissemination efforts will include: (1)
research
briefs;
(2) training manuals; (3) videotapes with accompanying print materials; (4) an on-line
multimedia
magazine containing text, still pictures, sound, and video; (5) videoconferences
broadcast via
PBS
stations across the country; (6) tapes of teleconferences with accompanying facilitator's
guides;
and (7) electronic bulletin board discussions.<P>
