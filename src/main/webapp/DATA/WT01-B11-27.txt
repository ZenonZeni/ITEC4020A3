<P> <EM> Thanks are due to Reiner Nikulski who submitted this page.</EM>

<P> The Hercules (Herkules) works have existed for more than 100 years
and are one of the oldest motorbike works. They belong to the Sachs
group who produce automotive products like clutches, shock absorbers and
small engines for severall purposes.  Sachs was one of the first
licensees of the new <A HREF = "nsu.html">NSU</A> / <A HREF =
"dr-wankel.html">Wankel</A> rotary engine in 1960.  They developed and
built more than 35,000 Wankel engines mostly for stationary purposes.
Characteristic was the air-cooling and the charge-cooled rotor.  The
biggest one was the 294 cc "KM 914" for generators and snowmobiles.
This KM 914 was the basis of all Hercules and <A HREF =
"norton.html">BSA (later Norton)</A> motorbikes.

<P> The first Hercules W 2000 was shown at the German IFMA motorbike
show in 1970 to see the public's reaction on a rotary bike. It had the
Sachs KM 914 engine and a BMW gearbox and driveshaft. Only one prototype
was produced.

<P> In 1973 Hercules built 50 W 2000 in a "pre-series" and sold them
only to Hercules dealers.  It had the KC 24 engine, which was based on
the KM 914 but was fitted for use in motorbikes.  A six-speed gearbox
with chain-drive was now installed. Characteristic for the pre-series
bikes was the yellow fuel tank.

<P> Production began in 1974 with the KC 27 engine. The Bike was sold in
England as DKW because that name was more popular in England and Sachs
owned the rights of that name, too. Special motorbikes based on the W
2000 have been driven in long-distance races and were very succesful in
off-road sports. A 50,000 km endurance test at the N&#252;rburgring in
1975 showed very low wear.  Hercules made prototype studies with a
water-cooled engine in a BMW/5 frame and a more conventional looking
engine on a 7 speed gearbox of the Hercules GS Two-stroke.  For the last
year of production the W 2000 got an oil-injector to avoid the mixing of
fuel and oil.  Overall 1800 Hercules W 2000 have been built.  After
stopping the production of rotary engines Sachs sold the tooling
machines to Norton. There is a IG Hercules W 2000 in germany, a DKW
owners club in England and a "Rotary Recycle" in USA.
