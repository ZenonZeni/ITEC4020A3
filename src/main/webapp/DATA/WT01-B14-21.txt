<P>

The stagnation of real wages also has coincided with a dramatic expansion of pay among many senior executives as well as a stock market boom which has produced large gains for them on their stock option programs. Popular magazines, such as Newsweek, have played upon class resentments over such differentials in pay by running front page stories about the rise of the "Overclass" (the technocratic elite profiting from the new world economic order) and "Corporate Killers" (a recent cover story on chief executives responsible for large layoffs). In the mid-1980's, there also was considerable media discussion about the social side-effects of corporate restructuring through takeover activity but the restructuring of that era did not provoke as much resentment because the overall growth rate of the economy and real income was much stronger. As many of the takeover artists of the mid-1980's violated federal security laws, the public also derived some satisfaction from watching some of the most prominent players go to jail. The corporate restructuring of the 1990's is being driven by factors very different from the takeover boom of the mid-1980's. As U.S. equity price/earnings multiples are much higher today than they were ten years ago, the dominant factors driving the restructuring are technology, international competition and the cumulative impact of several years of low inflation on corporate cost control strategies, not Wall Street's search for new transaction fees. As a result of the explosive growth of mutual fund ownership, a far larger share of the American population is benefiting from the impact of company rationalization on profits and share prices than ever before but the linkage between share ownership and employment is much weaker among ordinary corporate employees than among senior executives. According to Labor Department data, only 13% of U.S. employees participated in deferred profit sharing plans during 1993 while just 3% of this group belonged to employee stock ownership programs (ESOPS) and less than 1.0% received stock bonuses. The low level of stock ownership among company employees has helped to enhance the appeal of the Buchanan attack on corporate America despite the tremendous growth occurring in public equity ownership through mutual funds, individual retirement accounts and other tax deferred family savings programs. In a few weeks, a special White House taskforce will issue a report examining the feasibility of investing some portion of the social security trust fund in the equity market. Such a development would create practically universal equity ownership in the U.S. but it is unlikely to occur for at least three years.
<P>

The OECD recently published a study on income distribution in the major industrial countries. <B>The OECD data suggests that the U.S. has significantly more income inequality than other industrial countries primarily because of the very small share of income accruing to people in the bottom quintile of the population.</B> In the U.S., the bottom 20% of the population received about 5.7% of income in 1986 compared to 7.8% in Canada, 10.6% in Sweden and 7.0% in Britain. The share of income accruing to the wealthiest 10% of the population in the U.S. was about 24% in 1986 compared to 22% in Canada, 23% in Britain, 18% in Sweden, and 22% in Australia. In developing countries, such as Brazil and Mexico by contrast, the top 10% of households receive over 40% of personal income while the bottom 20% received only about 2.0-3.0%. The offset to this inequality is that affluent Americans pay high effective marginal income tax rates by international standards. In 1986, people in the top quintile of U.S. income paid 53% of all taxes compared to 3.8% for people in the bottom quintile. In Canada, the top quintile paid 46.5% of all taxes compared to 3.6% for the bottom quintile. In Britain, the top quintile paid 46.5% of all taxes compared to 4.5% for the bottom quintile. 
<P>

The U.S. also enjoys remarkable social mobility between income classes. According to a recent research report from the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, only about 5.1% of the people in the bottom income quintile of the population during 1975 were still in that quintile by 1991. Instead, 29% had moved to the top income quintile, 30% to the second income quintile, 21% to the third highest income quintile, and 14.6% to the fourth. Among people in the fourth income quintile, 37.0% also had moved to the highest income quintile while another 32.6% had moved to the second highest income quintile. The fact is that many of the people in the bottom income quintile are elderly and living on savings income, not wages, or young and thus poised to increase their income sharply as they gain work experience. <B>The marital status of people also has a major impact on their income rankings.</B> Among white people, 25% of households headed by single females have income below $10,000 compared to 4.7% for married couples. Among black people, 44% of households headed by single females have incomes below $10,000 compared to 9.8% for married couples.
<P>

The factor which appears to explain the magnitude of American income inequality compared to other industrial countries is the low level of transfer payments to the poor. In 1986, transfer payments accounted for only 13.7% of median income in the bottom quintile of the U.S. population compared to 32.4% for Britain, 18.3% for Canada, 27.0% for Sweden and 22.5% for Australia. The recent upsurge of spending on the Earned Income Tax Credit may have altered this ratio but with the exception of the EITC program the U.S. has far less generous transfer payment programs for the non-elderly than most other industrial countries. No presidential candidate is currently advocating an expansion of transfer payment programs because most middle class Americans perceive transfer payments other than social security to be give-aways to low income minority groups. In other industrial countries, by contrast, there is much less racial polarization than in the U.S. and thus much greater willingness to use the government as an engine for income redistribution. <B>As a result of the racial constraints on popular support for using the federal government to promote income redistribution, it is not surprising that right wing populists, such as Patrick Buchanan, have focused so heavily on themes such as foreign competition and corporate greed to explain falling living standards.</B> Such issues permit him to play upon the theme of economic insecurity without offering any detailed program for increasing public expenditure to promote job training or redistribute income. 
<P>

<B>The Buchanan themes played well in New Hampshire because that state has had one of the most volatile economies in the nation during the past decade.</B> In the 1980's, New Hampshire enjoyed an economic boom because of the impact of strong employment growth in New England's computer and defense industries, a flight of tax refugees from Massachusetts, and a real estate development boom financed by the state's newly privatized mutual savings banks. In the early 1990's, the boom turned to a bust as the New England high tech sector suffered from a slump in defense spending and demand for micro computers while vacancy rates for real estate reached such high levels that many of the state's banks failed. As a result of these upheavals, New Hampshire has not been immune to the problem of job insecurity and eroding real wages despite a low unemployment rate. According to one consultant's report, median family income in new Hampshire fell by 14.7% between 1989 and 1994 compared to 4.7% for the nation.
<P>

In 1996, Buchanan received only 27% of the primary vote in New Hampshire compared to 37% when he challenged George Bush in 1992. But while the 1996 primary vote was more fragmented because of the large number of candidates, the profile of the Buchanan vote clearly reflected the theme of economic insecurity. His voters were more heavily male, poorly educated and young than the voters for other candidates. According to surveys, he received the votes of 31% of male voters compared to 26% for Dole, 21% for Alexander, and 12% for Forbes while among women he received only 25% of the vote. He obtained 31% of the votes of people aged 18-29 years compared to 18% for Dole, 29% for Alexander, and 13% for Forbes. Among people over the age of 60, he received only 25% of the vote compared to 39% for Dole, 19% for Alexander, and 10% for Forbes. He received 43% of the votes of non-college graduates compared to 21% for Dole, 22% for Alexander, and 13% for Forbes whereas among college graduates he had only 23% of the vote compared to 27% for Dole, 23% for Alexander, and 12% for Forbes. Buchanan's voters also had strong ideological views. He collected the votes of 59% of people who described themselves as very conservative compared to 13% for Dole and 9% for Alexander while among moderates he obtained only 18% of the vote compared to 26% for Dole and 30% for Alexander. Buchanan received one third of the votes of people who said the economy mattered most compared to 25% for Dole and 23% for Alexander but his voting group was very much biased towards people with bad economic experiences. He received the votes of 27% of the people who said their personal financial situation had deteriorated compared to 19% for Dole, 24% for Alexander, and 14% for Forbes.
