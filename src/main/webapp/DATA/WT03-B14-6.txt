-AUSTRIAN GSM CELLULAR LICENCE AWARDED

TWW-2 January 1996-AUSTRIAN GSM CELLULAR LICENCE
AWARDED
TELECOMWORLDWIRE--(C) 1995 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

VIENNA, AUSTRIA- The Austrian government has awarded
the first competitive GSM cellular licence to a
consortium backed by Siemens and Deutsche Telekom
known as Oe-Call.  Oe-Call bid US$397m for the
licence -- the highest of the five applicants. 
Viktor Klima, transport minister for the Austrian
government, said that the competing service was
forecast to bring down prices by as much as 30%. Some
competing consortia said that the bid was unfair as
Siemens was an important equipment supplier to the
Austrian Post Office -- operators of the other GSM
service.  An appeal is permitted under Austrian law
although to date no company has said that it intends
to take advantage of this option.

TWW-2 January 1996-COMPUSERVE MOVES TO CLAMPDOWN ON
PORN, USERS PROTEST
TELECOMWORLDWIRE--(C) 1995 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

BONN, GERMANY- CompuServe, the giant US online
computer network service, has suspended worldwide
access to over 200 Usenet messaging groups following
concerns raised by German politicians over the
illegal pornographic nature of some contents. Users
throughout the world have criticised the company for
its actions, saying that the claims are unfounded and
that many worthwhile groups have been hit by the
action.  A raid had been made in November at offices
from the German federal prosecutor's office where
files and systems were examined.  Observers say that
the move had dire consequences for other Internet
service providers and point out that CompuServe needs
to engineer a system to restrict country-by-country
access in cases where it is forced to instead of
hitting all users worldwide. CompuServe has been keen
to point out that it did not have any input into the
Usenet groups being suspended over claims that they
contain child pornography and other undesirable
material.

-BRITISH AD WATCHDOG CLAMPS DOWN HEAVILY ON
ADVERTISERS

TWW-2 January 1996-BRITISH AD WATCHDOG CLAMPS DOWN
HEAVILY ON ADVERTISERS
TELECOMWORLDWIRE--(C) 1995 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

LONDON, UK- The Advertising Standards Authority, the
British ad industry watchdog, has clamped down on a
number of firms for their recent breaches of the
advertising code.  PEOPLES PHONE COMPANY PLC has seen
a complaint against it upheld where it offered a free
pocket colour TV on the purchase of a mobile phone. 
The complainant stated that the offer was only valid
for a select number of phones and not the entire
range as implied and noted that the offer was only
being offered for analogue handsets and not the
digital ones.  The company said that the offer
applied to all mobile phones and not all tariffs with
the exclusions listed in footnotes.  The ASA said
that the adverts should have been more clearly stated
to avoid confusion and requested that greater care be
taken in the future.  TOBYWARD LTD, trading as
Private Lines, had a complaint against it upheld
following objections to a mail order advert for
 Computer Hard-core Interactive Intercourse' which
was carried in PC Mart.  The crux of the complaint
centred around the tone of the language in a magazine
often bought by children.  In response Tobyward said
that they were aware of the sensitive nature of the
material, which had been certificated by the British
Board of Film Classification and that they thought
the publication was aimed at 18 to 35 year olds and
tailored the advert accordingly.  The SAA said that
while it had no objection to the adverts it requested
that a different headline be used if the same advert
was to be used in non-adult publications. VIRGIN
INTERACTIVE ENTERTAINMENT had a complaint against a
poster campaign upheld which featured the images of
dictators along with the strap  previous high
scores.' The ASA noted that permission had not been
given by President Chirac of France (who was featured
in the ads) and requested that the campaign not be
re-run.  IPC CORPORATION (UK) LTD had complaints
against it upheld following objections to an advert
which featured Pentium computers with a strap "50%
cashback. Choose any model from the fantastic
Cashback range and you'll be eligible to claim back
an amazing 50% of its purchase price in just five
years time." The advertiser said that the advert
contained two separate offers not applicable to all
products and the ASA said that the rules were not
very clear and requested amendments be made to the
advertisements.  GATEWAY 2000 EUROPE came under fire
after Dell Computer Corp, the Personal Computer
Association and members of the public complained over
adverts claiming that they had the first Windows 95
PCs on sale today and that every Gateway 2000 PC now
features Windows 95. The complaints stated that
Windows 95 was not on sale at the time of the
adverts' appearance and challenged the claims.  The
public complaints also noted the use of VAT exclusive
prices.  Gateway admitted it had acted wrongly,
claiming that the adverts were put together hastily
and the ASA requested that greater care be taken in
the future. Complaints were also upheld against ESCOM
who stated that it had over 160 stores nationwide and
open up to 8pm on Thursday nights when not all of the
stores operated late night opening policies; GAME LTD
was censured after it advertised management positions
with a retailer of multimedia technology with the
headline  Personality isn't everything' featuring a
young woman wearing a mini-dress and a man embracing
her behind the neck; RANK XEROX was censured for
using pictures of Trevor McDonald and Alan Whicker in
adverts for printing and copying machines without
their permission, claiming that such pictorial use
implied their recommendation of the machines;
HUTCHISON ORANGE was censured following a direct mail
shot which offered trade-ins through a dealer which
apparently did not exist when the recipient called
local outlets and ISLRIS RACING SERVICES were
censured for a press advert which failed to give the
correct call rates for a premium rate telephone
number listed.

-DISPUTE OVER INTERNATIONAL CALL LIMITATION GOES ON

TWW-2 January 1996-DISPUTE OVER INTERNATIONAL CALL
LIMITATION GOES ON
TELECOMWORLDWIRE--(C) 1995 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

LONDON, UK- An agreement has still to be reached
between BT, Mercury Communications and telephone
regulator Oftel over the timetable for the removal of
BT's and Mercury's sole rights to operate
international telephony networks out of the UK.  
While national service offerings are a free-for-all,
international service operation is still limited.  
Oftel is keen to open all of the markets, the
telephone companies naturally want to retain as many
advantages as possible and the UK government's
Department of Trade and Industry says that it is
broadly in favour of opening markets but notes that
it is discussing the move with the EU and World Trade
Organisation. Figures for 1994 show that 3.13bn
minutes of outbound telephone calls were made and
3.58bn minutes of incoming calls -- a surplus of 44m.

TELECOMWORLDWIRE--(C) 1995 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

LONDON, UK- The British government is planning to
invest millions of pounds in backing for a new
Internet project which will allow UK firms to
showcase their activities on the Internet.   The
funding would come out of the government's
 information society initiative' which would provide
support for companies looking at utilising the
Internet and the so-called information superhighway
as a worldwide window.  Backing for the service,
where budgets have yet to be revealed, is being made
by the Federation of Electronics Industry, trade
organisations and firms such as IBM, BT and Fujitsu. 
The planned offering would also include order
matching, overseas business promotion, access to
marketing sources and trade awareness.

-COST OF COMPUTER SYSTEM COULD THREATEN OPEN POWER
MARKET

TWW-2 January 1996-COST OF COMPUTER SYSTEM COULD
THREATEN OPEN POWER MARKET
TELECOMWORLDWIRE--(C) 1995 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

LONDON, UK- Plans by the UK government to open up the
domestic electricity market for competition are under
threat due to delays in the development of a complex
computer system needed to ensure compliance and open
activity.  The government and Coopers & Lybrand, the
retained consultancy, have confirmed that there are
serious doubts over whether a GBP100m computer system
could be operational by 1 April 1998 -- the date set
for domestic competition.  Some government sources
have hinted that matters have also been protracted
because of electricity companies proving to be less
than cooperative with many aspects of the plan.  The
computer system would mirror the electricity pool
used for commercial electricity affairs although it
will need to be larger and more powerful because of
the differing numbers of customers.  One option
facing the government is a phasing in of system
functionality and relative options.   There has also
been a number of rows over just who is to pay for the
computer system.  The government is expected to
announce a number of amendments to the programme in
January.

-COMPLAINTS MADE OVER OFTEL'S BT CLAIMS

TWW-2 January 1996-COMPLAINTS MADE OVER OFTEL'S BT
CLAIMS
TELECOMWORLDWIRE--(C) 1995 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

LONDON, UK- A number of complaints have been lodged
against Don Cruickshank, director general of Oftel --
the British telecommunications regulator -- over
comments he recently made about BT, Telecomworldwire
understands.  In November Cruickshank accused BT at a
public forum of failing to implement fair trading
throughout its business, suggesting that BT took the
view that there was no corporate harm in having anti-
competitive practices unless the regulator
intervened.  Oftel was not available for comment at
the time of going to press over the complaints
apparently lodged against Cruickshank.  Meanwhile
Oftel is to take action and monitor BT's activities
in the Internet service provision market following
some industry concerns that BT would be acting anti-
competitively and stifling fair competition in this
growing sector.   Some Internet service providers
have received a letter from Oftel admitting that BT
is cross-subsidising its services although the
regulator is presently watching the situation,
declining to take any action as the venture is still
effectively as a start-up.  Certainly commercially it
would not be sensible for BT to upset the market too
closely as it is a major supplier of leased lines and
secondary circuits and provision to many Internet
service providers in the UK.

-CLAMPDOWN ON UK MOBILE PHONE USERS

TWW-2 January 1996-CLAMPDOWN ON UK MOBILE PHONE USERS
TELECOMWORLDWIRE--(C) 1995 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

LONDON, UK- Several cellular service providers are
clamping down on their customers mobile phone usage
in a bid to cut fraud.  One network reseller has
already placed a ceiling of GBP50-worth of calls
without a deposit being paid and large deposits are
being demanded off GSM digital cellular users who
wish to take full advantage of cellular roaming while
overseas. Cellphones Direct, a UK service provider
who resells Vodafone Group airtime, plans to
introduce its cellular ceiling plan in February,
despite customer concern to the plan.  Vodafone and
Cellnet, as network operators, are not responsible
for the charges placed by its reseller agents who
deal direct with members of the public.

LONDON, UK- According to a tribunal arranged by the

The tribunal was told that as the food was ordered it

TELECOMWORLDWIRE--(C) 1995 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

LONDON, UK- The British government has confirmed that
police are empowered to search and read electronic
mail messages sent by companies and private
individuals.  Michael Howard, home secretary,
confirmed that the 1985 Interception of
Communications act does cover electronic mail and as
such allows authorised interception of e-mail
messages.  UK-based Internet service providers would
be forced to provide assistance to police upon
provision of a properly-executed warrant, however
observers note that there would be problems placing
warrants on systems hosted outside of the UK-- such
as CompuServe.

BANKING SERVICE
TELECOMWORLDWIRE--(C) 1995 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

LONDON, UK- British banking unions are becoming ever
concerned over the growth in telephone banking
services, claiming that new experiments could leave
High Street branches out in the cold. The National
Westminster Bank is trialing a system where customers
calling a local branch are switched to a central
answering centre and routine queries are dealt with
by staff linked to computer systems.  Officials say
that if the scheme is implemented, millions of staff
will be moved over to the cheaper service.  Peter
Haines, a spokesman of the Banking, Insurance and
Finance Union, said: "We are worried that it could be
used as a back-door way of phasing out all local
branches.  NatWest denied that it had plans to phase
out branches, saying that they remain a critical part
of their business plan.

COUNCIL
TELECOMWORLDWIRE--(C) 1995 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

BRUSSELS, BELGIUM- In a bid to champion the return of
the typewriter, a city borough council in Brussels is
planning to introduce a tax in the workplace. The
voted measure will see an annual GBP12 levy made on
every computer in central Brussels area and companies
will be forced to display a licence sticker as proof
of payment.  The tax law does not say what provisions
need to be made for laptop computers. Incredibly, a
number of inspectors are being appointed to police
the licensing process.  The city's finance department
used the argument that computers take away jobs and
hence it is acceptable to place a tax on them. Around
GBP1m is expected to be raised by the tax.  A number
of offices whose property falls between the city
borough where taxes are enforced and another local
tax-free borough has considered shifting all of its
computers to the other end of the office block in
order to save money.

that in principle barriers between local and long-

hindered by a number of different regulations that
prohibit market cross-entry and these are to be
lifted with a new set of fairness regulatory models
inserted in their place to protect smaller companies
from being impacted by larger competitors.  No time
span has been mooted for the new regime, however.

LONDON, UK- Hutchison Orange, operators of a UK PCN

range of new and existing handsets are now being made
available to dealers at full trade prices with
commission paid upon connection.  When Orange first
launched it sold units at net prices to dealers who
then sold on mark-up. The company claimed that it was
breathing a breath of fresh air into the cellular
marketplace although it denies that it has made a
sudden about turn.   Orange dealers will also be able
to earn extra commission by signing up customers to
higher price plans, based on marketing support
programmes and gimmicky offers.  "Orange if convinced
these proposals will ensure the competitiveness of
the trade proposition for 1996, building on the
excellent results seen since the launch of Orange,"
claimed Gareth Jones, group director of sales.

LONDON, UK- America Online is making a move into the

service provider -- although so does with CompuServe
with around 4m customers -- and it believes that it
can make a dent in the UK market despite arriving
many years after CompuServe first pitched camp. AOL
will be bringing exclusive British content for its
online service as well as the usual range of Internet

determined although it is expected to be comparable
to the US service.  The company is keen to point out
that it is not just marketing its US service with a
few extras into the UK, instead preferring to produce
the best of its US output with great UK and European
content. America Online has seen its move scrutinised
by the European Commission's anti-competitive
officials because of its planned alliance with
Bertelsmann and Deutsche Telekom.
