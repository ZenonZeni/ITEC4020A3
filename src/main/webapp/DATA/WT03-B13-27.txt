WISCONSIN PSC CHAIRMAN ELECTED NARUC PRESIDENT

Cheryl L. Parrino, chairman of the Public Service Commission
of Wisconsin (PSC) was elected president of the National
Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners (NARUC) at the
organization's annual meeting in New Orleans, Louisiana.

NARUC is a quasi-governmental nonprofit organization founded
over 100 years ago to serve the public interest by improving
the quality and effectiveness of public regulation in America.
Its membership is comprised of government agencies of 50
states and the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the
Virgin Islands. In her acceptance speech before NARUC members,

Chairman Parrino shared her goals for the organization and
outlined the major issues she believes are common to all
utility industries. She also indicated that she felt NARUC is
at a critical point in its 107-year history.

"The telecommunications industry is on the verge of the first
major legislative change in 30 years. I predict we will see
legislation pass this year or early next year. The Safe Water
Drinking Act, PURPA and PUCHA repeal or reform are all matters
currently under discussion. We must be involved if we are to
live up to our motto -- dedicated to the public interest,
Chairman Parrino said. "I commit that NARUC will be a viable
and valuable player in those discussions and that we will have
an impact on how the industries transition to a competitive
market place," she added.

CPUC INVESTIGATES WILTEL FOR CALLER ID PRACTICES

The California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) has opened
an investigation of Wiltel Telephone Corporation (Wiltel) for
allegedly releasing phone numbers of California callers to
out-of-state parties without notice or blocking, a violation
of CPUC and federal Caller ID regulations.

The Commission told Wiltel, a Tulsa, Oklahoma-based company,
it has 30 days to notify its customers that their billing
numbers are being disclosed in interstate calls. The notice
must be separate from the customer's bills and by first class
mail.  Wiltel must submit within 45 days a report to the CPUC
detailing numbers of customers, volume of intrastate and
interstate calls, and names of all resellers of Wiltel service
in the state.

If the company is found to have violated CPUC regulations, it
could face monetary penalties.

Specifically, Wiltel has been passing on billing numbers, but
for residential customers these are usually the same as the
home number, although they often differ for business lines. In
either case, Wiltel's California subscribers, many of them
with unlisted  numbers, do not know that their numbers are
being disclosed on the other end of a long distance call.

The problem was revealed in late 1994 when two California
customers complained to the Commission. While local phone
companies do not provide Caller ID, that is, allow a called
party to see the number of the person calling, billing numbers
are forwarded to the long distance phone companies and to
subscribers of 800 and 900 services for billing and routing
purposes.

OPEN DEVELOPMENT INTRODUCES PREPAID CALLING CARD
SYSTEM SUPPORTING MORE THAN 100 MILLION ACCOUNTS

Open Client/Server-Based Prepaid Calling Card System Brings
Customized Service Capabilities to RBOCs and Interexchange
Carriers

Open Development Corporation, of Westwood, MA, developers and
marketers of software and services to telecommunications
companies, has introduced openMEDIA Prepaid, a network-based
prepaid calling card system designed to handle over 100

any other prepaid system in the industry.  openMEDIA Prepaid,
which is marketed to service providers, can easily process 20
million call minutes per month.

openMEDIA Prepaid provides many advanced administrative and
performance features required to provide fast, reliable
prepaid service. These features include fraud control,
multiple reseller and rating plan support, call branding and
activation of cards and lots through IVR (interactive voice

associated with millions of accounts. In addition, openMEDIA
Prepaid handles administration, billing and customer care
functions using Windows-based applications.

"Our system is designed for maximum performance and
reliability. The use of industry-standard hardware and
software guarantees system flexibility and scaleability so our
customers can quickly respond and adapt to new market demands
now and into the future. "

Prepaid phone cards let users make calls easily without a
phone company account, allow the use of pay phones without
coins, and are cost-effective because there are no surcharges
or operator assist charges. For businesses, prepaid phone
cards make it easier to track expenses and can be used as
promotional items and giveaways. Yankee Group analysts expect
prepaid phone cards to represent a $1 billion market by the
end of 1996. "We use Open Development is openMEDIA Prepaid
phone card system for our standard retail offering as well as
our NFL "Let's Talk Football" sweepstakes promotion because it
is the most available, scaleable and reliable system we've
seen to date," said Gordon Allen, president of GTE Card
Services. "The system's database implementation enables us to
easily and efficiently manage account transaction processing
and card distribution," added Allen.

openMEDIA Prepaid is designed to be a reseller platform.  It
offers a hierarchical database of agents, subagents, lots and
cards, making it easy to set up new business partners, create
special promotions and generate hundreds of thousands of cards
in a matter of minutes. In addition, it provides the options
necessary to support one or more resellers. Each reseller, in
turn, can set up a number of prepaid phone card campaigns.

openMEDIA Prepaid is the first application to be fully
integrated on openMEDIA, Open Development's robust, open
client/server-based Enhanced Services Platform (ESP).
openMEDIA is a core foundation from which all applications
can run and share platform resources. The platform is built on
a fully integrated Oracle 7 database, PowerBuilder front-end
applications, IBM RS/6000 or Stratus Continuum processors, a
Summa Four or Excel Switch, Dialogic-based voice response
units and a voice recognition option.

The use of the Oracle 7 Relational Database Management System
(RDBMS) and the Oracle Parallel Server option ensures database
integrity and system scaleability. The platform also offers an
integrated client/server database, a real-time billing and
rating engine, and integrated ACD for customer care, IVR for
service creation environment, and is sold in a fault tolerant
and highly available configuration.

COMPUTER DATA PROTECTOR AND TELEPHONE
PRIVACY DEVICE INTRODUCED

Are there interruptions from coworkers or family members
picking up the telephone when you are dialed into your
favorite on-line service or cruising the INTERNET? Ever wonder
if someone else is listening in on your telephone
conversation?

If these are problems you are experiencing because of a shared
telephone line, Dalco Products has the answer without the
need of installing a dedicated line. Just place one of their
Data Protector line cords on the extensions that are causing
the interruptions.

Any device equipped with the Data Protector cannot access or
interrupt a line that is already in use. This prevents devices
on the same line from causing interruptions when downloading
files, and eavesdropping on calls already in progress. This is
an ideal device for the home office or anyplace where line
privacy is required.

Installation is simple. Just swap out your existing modular
telephone cord with the Data Protector cord. An in-line
coupler is provided if you need additional length in your
installation. Retail price is $16.95 each with discounts when
purchasing 3 or more devices.

Dealer inquiries are welcomed. For more information, contact
Dalco Products 200 West Main, Roberts, WI 54023. Phone
(715)749-0160 or Fax (715)749-3960.

NEW AMERITECH PAGING SERVICE BOOMING
IN CHICAGO AND ROLLS OUT IN DETROIT

Success of a new paging service from Ameritech, Calling Party
Pays - Paging (CPPP), has been so good in Chicago that
SourceOne Wireless is rolling out the service in Detroit under
their brand name, "FREEDOMPage."

Ameritech developed the Calling Party Pays - Paging service
and currently is the only company offering it in the U.S. As
the first CPPP customer, SourceOne Wireless earned $45,000
from Ameritech in usage fees generated during the audit period
the service was available in the Chicago market.

"This breakthrough technology now allows us to offer a paging
service to people who would not have considered one
previously. We particularly see interest among working parents
with school children to check on them, adults caring for
elderly parents and small business and trades business
people," said Neil Cox, president of Ameritech Information
Industry Services.

A CPPP subscriber no longer pays for incoming calls -- the
caller pays. The only cost for the paging subscriber is
purchasing a pager or converting a current one and the
activation fee, which means no monthly service fee for the
subscriber. Callers to a paging number are given a voice
announcement describing the service fee before the call is
connected. The caller has the option to hang up or complete
the call. The fee is determined by the third-party paging
provider offering the service, but usually runs a flat rate of
25 cents per call.

CPPP was tariffed in Illinois last August after a trial that
ran in Chicago since May. "Since then, 600,000 calls a month
are being processed and new subscribers are being added at the
rate of 15,000 per month," Cox said.

"We are extremely optimistic about FREEDOMPage in Detroit,"
said Dave Trop, chief executive officer of SourceOne Wireless.
"Our results to date in Chicago are well above expectations,
and we anticipate this service to be as successful as our
traditional paging services."

Ameritech is now accepting orders from Michigan, Ohio and
Wisconsin and expects to be accepting orders throughout
Indiana soon. The company also is exploring opportunities
outside the region.

Calling Party Pays (CPP) is built off the Advanced
Intelligent Network (AIN), the most advanced AIN platform
available today and the basis of many new enhanced services.
Other CPP product enhancements off the AIN platform are in
development, and Ameritech is offering technological and
marketing consulting services on CPPP to other companies,
according to Roger Sosa, CPP product manager.

WISCONSIN PSC APPROVES NEW RATE STRUCTURE (ALREADY IN PLACE)

The Public Service Commission of Wisconsin has reviewed the
record of the Utelco, Inc., rate restructuring proposal and
approved it at an open meeting. Utelco is a Monroe-based
telecommunications company that provides service to
approximately 12,500 customers in eight exchanges in the
Monroe area.

On December 29, 1994, Utelco implemented, subject to a refund
pending PSC review, a new rate structure that charges for
local telephone calls on a per minute basis. The Commission
received three petitions containing 1,258 signatures
requesting that it investigate the proposal, and conduct a
public hearing to determine if the Utelco proposal was in the
public interest.

Two public hearings were held in Monroe on September 25,
1995. At the hearings, 287 appearance slips were submitted by
individual Utelco customers and 206, or 72 percent of the
appearances, indicated they supported the Utelco proposal. In
addition, 46 Utelco customers testified both in support and in
opposition to the proposal.

The Commission found that Utelco residential customers
averaged approximately $8.53 in usage charges for the first
six months of 1995, and that 72 percent of the residential
customers were saving money under the Utelco plan.

GTE CARD SERVICES KICKS OFF FOOTBALL
SWEEPSTAKES USING NFL GTE PREPAID PHONE CARDS

Open Development's openMEDIA Prepaid Application Tackles Call
Management and Contest Administration

GTE Card Services Incorporated, which is a wholly owned
subsidiary of GTE Information Services Incorporated, and Open
Development Corporation, a software developer for
telecommunications service providers, announced a nationwide
football sweepstakes to promote "Let's Talk Football" NFL GTE
Prepaid Phone Cards.

GTE's Prepaid phone card and the administration of the
consumer contest are both automated by openMEDIA Prepaid, a
new prepaid calling card system built for high-volume
applications by Open Development. Open Development's openMEDIA
Prepaid system allows RBOCs and high-volume interexchange
carriers to offer reliable processing of debit calling-card
service.

GTE Card Services is sponsoring the "Let's Talk Football"
sweepstakes, which runs through December 31, 1995, to promote
its officially licensed NFL GTE Prepaid Phone Cards. The cards
feature officially licensed helmets and team logos from all 30
NFL franchises. They are sold in retail locations nationwide
in $10 denominations.

"We've been extremely pleased with the performance of our
prepaid business," said Gordon Allen, president, GTE Card
Services. "Due to significant growth in the prepaid phone card
market, our sweepstakes program has doubled in size. The
scaleability of Open Development's architecture has allowed
us to respond efficiently to this increased demand.

openMEDIA Prepaid offers service providers sophisticated
administrative features such as fraud control, multiple
reseller and rating plan support, call branding and
interactive voice response activation of cards and lots. The
application can handle millions of accounts and performs
administration, billing and customer service functions using
Windows-based applications. The system also tracks the sale
and usage of each card issued, which helps retailers determine
the effectiveness of their marketing strategies.

With the help of features built into the openMEDIA Prepaid
application, consumers can determine over the telephone,
without speaking with a contest representative, whether they
have won a sweepstakes prize. Consumers can call an 800 number
and enter their unique personal identification PIN, found on
the back of the card, to determine whether they have a winning
card. Prizes include official NFL merchandise, GTE Prepaid
Phone Cards featuring NFL teams, and a grand prize that
includes a trip for two to Super Bowl XXX in Phoenix, Ariz.

"We did an extensive market study and found that Open
Development's combination of availability, scaleability and
reliability are far superior to any other calling card
technologies," added GTE's Gordon Allen. "Open Development's
flexible database technology greatly simplifies the task of
running special promotions such as the sweepstakes, and its
tracking and reporting features help our distributors manage
their businesses more effectively every day."

The prepaid phone cards work much like a debit card with a
preset spending limit. The phone system tracks the prepaid
minutes and informs the cardholder how many long-distance
minutes remain. Once all of the available minutes have been
used, consumers can "recharge" the prepaid phone card using a
credit card.

openMEDIA Prepaid, designed as a reseller platform, is built
on a fully integrated Oracle 7 database, PowerBuilder front-
end applications, IBM RS/6000 or Stratus Continuum processors,
a Summa Four or Excel Switch, Dialogic-based voice response
units and a voice recognition option.

Open Development Corporation develops and markets software
solutions to telecommunications companies worldwide. The
company is recognized as an industry leader in highly
available, large network-based enhanced service platforms and
prepaid phone card systems. Founded in 1992, Open Development
is committed to providing its customers with high performance,
full-featured telecommunications services for wireline and
wireless networks worldwide. Open Development's products are
implemented as strategic business solutions because they
enable service providers to expand their offerings, grow their
customer base, and increase revenue.

GTE Card Services Incorporated, based in Irving, Tex., is a
wholly owned subsidiary of GTE Information Services
Incorporated.  GTE Corporation, the parent company of GTE
Information Services Incorporated, is the world's
fourth-largest publicly owned telecommunications company.
