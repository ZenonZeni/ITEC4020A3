<BR>

How much income will your investment yield? That is a difficult question
to answer - although some investments promise a fixed return over a
specific period of time, mutual funds do not, and you cannot consider
past yield of a mutual fund a reliable predictor of future results. 
<P>

But if only for the purpose of comparing one investment choice with
another, it makes sense to pay attention to the stated yield of an
investment. Mutual fund companies and depository institutions follow
both regulation and convention in describing an investment's yield.
Below we take a closer look at the various yields that you may see
mentioned in sales literature or advertisements.
<P>

Annual percentage yield (APY): Income earned on a bank deposit (a
certificate of deposit or money market deposit account, for example) is
described as an annual percentage yield. The yield reflects the total
amount of interest paid on a deposit account, based on the interest rate
and the frequency of compounding for a 365-day period. 
<P>

<IMG SRC="gifs/apy_chart.gif">

<P>

Current yield: You will see a current - or seven-day - yield mentioned in
money market fund advertising. This yield represents one week's income
annualized as of a specific date. It does not include realized or
unrealized gains and losses. 
<P>

<P>

Effective yield: Effective yield, in the context of fixed-price
investments such as money market funds or certificates of deposit,
includes the effect of compounding net investment income. That's why an
effective yield will be higher than a quoted yield. To understand the
difference between the yield quoted on an investment and its effective
yield, find out how frequently the income is assumed to be compounded.
You'll note a greater difference when income is compounded weekly than
quarterly or semiannually. And, remember that effective yield
presupposes that you reinvest all your income and that interest rates
remain constant. 
<P>

Current distribution rate: Current distribution rate is simply a measure
of the level of dividends distributed by a mutual fund for a specified
period. It may sometimes be greater than the fund's yield because, for
instance, it may include gains from the sale of short-term investments
and possibly long-term gains (which may be non-recurring). 
<P>

<P>

SEC yield: The Securities and Exchange Commission requires all income
mutual funds to calculate a yield using the same standardized formula.
According to the formula (which is included in Kemper funds' 
"Statement of Additional Information" or Part B), the SEC yield is net
investment income per share earned over a specific month, expressed as
an annualized percentage of the fund's maximum offering price (the
fund's per share net asset value plus the maximum applicable sales
charge) on the last day of that month. 
<P>

Taxable-equivalent yield: You'll find a taxable-equivalent yield cited in
material that accompanies investments in municipal bonds and mutual
funds that seek to earn income exempt from federal taxes. The stated or
coupon yield of these investments will likely be lower than the yield of
investments that are taxable. However, it's possible to calculate a
tax-equivalent yield that represents the yield that you would have to
earn on a fully taxable investment before taxes to match the yield on a
tax-free investment. The marketing materials will tell you the federal
(and state, if applicable) tax rates used as a basis for calculating the
taxable-equivalent yield.

<IMG SRC="gifs/whats_yield_subhead.gif" ALT="Total Return Defined">
<BR>

Although yield will give you an idea of the income being generated by
your investment, total return is considered one of the best measures of the overall
performance of most mutual fund investments. (Because money market funds
seek to maintain a constant $1.00 share price, yield is the usual
measure of their performance.)
<P>

Total return is a measure of the income earned by the fund's
investments, plus the effect of any realized and unrealized appreciation
or depreciation of the investments, during a stated period of time,
assuming the reinvestment of all dividends. While yield measures only
the income component of your fund shares, total return considers three
components: income dividends, capital gain dividends and changes in the
value of your shares.
