<p align="center"><b>American Public Health Association Passes
Resolution Endorsing Making Cannabis Available By Prescription</b> </p>

<p align="left"><spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="50"><b>November, 1995, Washington DC:</b>&nbsp; The
American Public Health Association (APHA), the oldest and largest
organization of public health professionals in the world, passed
a <a href="http://www.commonlink.com/~olsen/MEDICAL/apha.html">resolution</a>
this past November urging lawmakers to make marijuana legally
available as a therapeutic agent.&nbsp; The APHA represents more
than 50,000 members and has been effectively influencing policies
and setting priorities in public health since 1872.&nbsp; The
APHA is one of the first major American health associations to
formally recommend using cannabis as a medicine. <br>
<spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="50">&quot;This is a significant development toward achieving <b>NORML</b>'s
goal of amending the federal law to allow physicians to be able
to legally prescribe marijuana to their patients,&quot; states <b>NORML</b>'s
Deputy Director Allen St. Pierre.&nbsp; &quot;These are respected
health care professionals whose opinions and positions carry
great weight with our publicly elected officials.&quot; <br>
<spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="50">The APHA <a
href="http://www.commonlink.com/~olsen/MEDICAL/apha.html">resolution</a>
concludes that &quot;greater harm is caused by the legal
consequences of [marijuana's] prohibition than possible risks of
medicinal use&quot; and &quot;urges the Administration and Congress
to move expeditiously to make cannabis available as a legal
medicine.&quot; <br>
<spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="50">The <a href="http://www.commonlink.com/~olsen/MEDICAL/apha.html">resolution</a>
will be published in the forthcoming issue of <i>The American
Journal of Public Health</i>. <br>

<p align="center"><b>Marijuana Arrests For 1994 Near Half Million
Mark: FBI Data Confirms Clinton's Marijuana War To Be Tougher
Than Bush's</b> </p>

<p align="left"><spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="50">An estimated 481,098 total marijuana arrests were
made by state and local law enforcement during the year 1994,
according to the latest edition of the FBI's Uniform Crime
Report.&nbsp; This figure is a 26 percent increase over last
year's total and pushes the total number of marijuana arrests
under the Clinton administration to a staggering 861,788. <br>
<spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="50">Of the 481,098 arrests made for marijuana in 1994, approximately
83.7 percent (402,717) were for simple
&quot;possession.&quot;&nbsp; The remaining 16.3 percent (78,381
arrests) were for &quot;sale/manufacture,&quot; a category that
includes all cultivation offenses -- even those where the marijuana
was being grown for personal use. <br>
<spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="50">&quot;This data confirms that the federal government's war on
marijuana consumers has gotten significantly tougher under
Clinton's regime,&quot; states <b>NORML</b>'s Deputy National
Director Allen St. Pierre.&nbsp; &quot;These new FBI statistics
indicate that one marijuana user is arrested eveiy 65 seconds in America.&nbsp;
Not surprisingly, those individuals who possess marijuana are
being hardest hit.&quot; <br>
<spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="50">According to annual data collected by the FBI, Clinton's two year
average of total marijuana arrests (430,894 arrests per year) is
27 percent higher than the average number of yearly arrests under
the Bush administration (338,998).&nbsp; &quot;The fact that
studies indicate adolescent use rates for marijuana are rising at
the same time that law enforcement is arresting record numbers of
users affirms <b>NORML</b>'s long-held belief that marijuana
prohibition is not an effective deterrent to marijuana
consumption,&quot; remarks St. Pierre. <br>
<spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="50"><i>For more information on marijuana arrests, please contact

<p align="center"><b>(Meanwhile) Prison Population Experiences
Largest Annual Increase In History: United States Now
Incarcerates A Larger Percentage Of Its Population Than Any Other
Nation</b> </p>

<p align="left"><spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="50"><b>December 4, 1995, Washington, DC:</b>&nbsp;
The nation's prison population experienced its largest 1 year
increase ever bringing America's inmate population to a record
total of more than 1.1 million.&nbsp; With this total, the United
States now surpasses Russia to claim the unenviable crown of having
incarcerated a greater share of its residents than any other
nation. <br>
<spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="50">Since 1980, America's prison population has risen by over 300
percent.&nbsp; This dramatic increase is due mainly to the impact
of the &quot;war on drugs&quot; and stiff mandatory
sentences.&nbsp; According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics,
drug offenders now constitute nearly two-thirds of all federal
prisoners and approximately one-quarter of all state prisoners.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Update: Marijuana Activists Swarm To Arizona
To Purchase Legal Tax Stamps</b> </p>

<p align="left"><spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="50"><b>December 5, 1995, Phoenix, AZ:</b>&nbsp;
Following a recent Arizona court decision that rules a citizen
may legally possess and sell cannabis in Arizona if they possess
the proper state license and tax stamps to do so, marijuana
activists have been swarming to the state. <br>
<spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="50">According to reports from representatives of <a
href="http://www.amug.org/~az4norml/">AZ4NORML</a>, some
activists have even taken to openly selling marijuana in front of
the Arizona State Capital.&nbsp; Rich Davis, longtime hemp
activist and curator of the mobile USA Hemp Museum, recently sold
one gram bags of marijuana out in front of the Department of
Revenue in plain view of both capital and state police
officers.&nbsp; No arrests were made. <br>
<spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="50">A second well known activist, Ron Kiczenski, reports that he
intends to open America's first ever marijuana store.&nbsp;
&quot;This will be the first legal marijuana cigarette
company,&quot; he told <i>The Associated Press</i>.&nbsp;
&quot;It's legal to buy marijuana from anyone in the state.&nbsp;
You just have to pay the state tax within 24 hours of the
sale.&quot; <br>
<spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="50">The recent goings-on in Arizona stem from a ruling by Northwest
Phoenix Justice Court Judge John Barclay that dismissed charges
against Arizona NORML Chairman Peter Wilson because of evidence
that he is licensed by the state to sell marijuana.&nbsp; Basing
his decision on constitutional prohibitions against double
jeopardy, Judge Barclay concluded that Wilson could not be prosecuted
for possession of marijuana because of taxes he has paid to the
Arizona Depantnient of Revenue to sell cannabis.&nbsp; Under
Title 42 of a 1983 law, Arizona residents can purchase both a license
and tax stamps to possess and sell marijuana. <br>
<spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="50">State lawmakers contend that the legislation was intended solely
as a way to punish drug traffickers, not to legalize cannabis in
the state of Arizona.&nbsp; &quot;We're confident that [Judge
Barclay's] decision will be overturned,&quot; states Barnett
Lotstein, a special assistant with the Maricopa County Attorney's
Office.&nbsp; &quot;In the event it isn't, I'm sure the
Legislature would remedy that post haste.&quot; <br>
<spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="50">&quot;We know that the Legislature is going to vote on this issue
[when it convenes in January,]&quot; responds Bill Green of <a
href="http://www.amug.org/~az4norml/">AZ4NORML</a>.&nbsp;
&quot;Our goal is to be well organized so that we [can] actively change
the law the best we can at that time.&quot; <br>

href="http://www.ecolution.com/hempi.html"><b>Hempilation</b></a><b>
CD Escalates: Massachusetts Anti-Drug Group Organizes Rally
Against Radio Station WBCN Boston</b> </p>

<p align="left"><spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="50"><b>Boston, Massachusetts, December 1, 1995:</b>&nbsp;
The Massachusetts based anti-drug group, Governor's Alliance
Against Drugs, in cooperation with representatives from the DEA
and local law-enforcement, organized a protest outside the
offices of WBCN Boston to voice their disapproval of the station
&quot;giving airtime&quot; to the <b>NORML</b> benefit CD, <a
href="http://www.ecolution.com/hempi.html">HEMPILATION</a>. <br>
<spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="50">Alleging that <b>NORML</b> is poised to make &quot;millions&quot;
from the sale of the CD and further stating that &quot;WBCN is an
active participant of the pro-marijuana legalization effort in
Massachusetts,&quot; the G.A.A.D. issued a fax release
encouraging local law enforcement to attend the rally and
&quot;bring [their] squad car[s.]&quot; <br>
<spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="50">According to representatives from Mass/Cann NORML, about 15
protesters showed up at the gathering and a report of the event
was broadcast on WCVB-TV Channel 3 News.&nbsp; Attendees were
shown carrying signs with slogans such as &quot;WBCN is bringing
the country to its knees&quot; and &quot;WBCN: Broadcasting
Capitalists for NORML.&quot;&nbsp; G.A.A.D. Executive Director
Georgette Wilson and Boston liaison for the Drug Enforcemant
Administration, Steve Morreale, were filmed entering WBCN's
offices as &quot;they went in to make their case to station
officials.&quot; <br>
<spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="50">WBCN reported to WCVB-TV that the station will continue to play
music off the <a href="http://www.ecolution.com/hempi.html">HEMPILATION</a>
CD.&nbsp; Later, in an MTV NEWS interview which aired December 6
and 7, WBCN's program director commented that: &quot;Music
shouldn't be blamed for social phenomena.&nbsp; Musicians have
the same right to free expression as other Americans.&quot;&nbsp;
The radio station offered Wilson an opportunity to air her
concerns over <a href="http://www.ecolution.com/hempi.html">HEMPILATION</a>
on WBCN's public forum show, but Wilson refused their invitation. <br>
<spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="50">In response to the action taken by the Governor's Alliance
Against Drugs against WBCN, Mass/Cann NORML is considering taking
legal action against the federal prohibitionist groups involved
in the protest.&nbsp; &quot;These government sponsored and
organized activities are designed to coerce, threaten,
intimidate, and damage WBCN-FM so that they [will] abandon their
association with Mass/Cann NORML,&quot; alleges President <a
href="mailto:billdowning@delphi.com">Bill Downing</a>.&nbsp;
&quot;These sorts of actions, when performed by government
agents, are specifically proscribed by law.&quot; <br>
