RAFT is the acronym for The Sibley School's &quot;Rigid Air Foil Team,&quot;
a student design project that has involved over a dozen undergraduates for
the past three years, under the guidance of Professor Dean L. Taylor. The
challenge is to design and fabricate a rigid sail for a mono-hull sailboat
that will optimize the efficiency with which the wind propels the boat,
especially to windward. For a number of years rigid sails have been used
successfully on catamarans, twin hulled boats with considerably more favorable
stability characteristics than a conventional mono-hulled craft. It remained
to be proven that the Cornell team could achieve as much and outperform
conventional sails, using a Vanguard 20 sailboat as their test bed.<BR>

To overcome the tendency of the craft to heel, or tip in a strong wind,
the needed flexibility in the sail was achieved by designing an airfoil
out of two separate pieces, joined together by flexible straps. Advanced
composite material, consisting of fiberglass and metallic film was used
in the construction.<BR>
<BR>
The culmination of the three year effort took place this spring, a few weeks
before graduation, with the first test of the craft on Cayuga Lake. Results
were most satisfactory. This year's student team leaders, Chris Adler, Craig
Der Ananian and Michele Lea deserve congratulations along with the rest
of their colleagues. But next year's team already has its sights on making
improvements.<BR>
