<p><font size=4><img src = "ganim5b.gif" height=110 width=110
align=left>It has often been said that we can surf the country
and the world in a matter of seconds on the
Internet.  In a certain sense, this is no doubt true.  Indeed,
the Internet is changing not only the
way we spend our leisure time -- but also the way we do business
as well.  Of course, traditional
business limitations still exist in some form; but these are more
and more easily overcome as the
sophistication of computer hardware and software allows for the
exchange of more and more of
what we do and what we buy through the Internet.</p>

<p>The technology unfortunately -- or perhaps fortunately -- may
have left traditional notions of
equity and justice behind.  Hand in hand with these technological
changes will come changes in
the laws which govern us and the way that courts apply them.</p>

<p> One of the most basic questions of any court system is and
always has been which court has the right to decide a dispute
between two people.  With the advances in technology and the
use of cyberspace the question now sometimes comes down to "When
two people who use the Internet have a dispute relating to their
use of the Internet, and the only connection between them has
been the Internet, what court decides the dispute?"  The two of
them can be hundreds or thousands of miles or even continents
apart and the court nearest one of them may be very far away from
and inconvenient for the other. 

<p>If you do business over the Internet, do you think that
someone who disputes your rights can
sue you where his or her (not your) Internet connection is
located?  If you run a one-person store
in Hawaii or Australia, do you expect to be sued in Ohio by
someone in Ohio who encountered
you over the Internet?  Probably you have never thought about
this, and probably your initial
answer will be no, but if so you may be in for a surprise.</p>

<img src = "bluemarb.gif" height = 5 width = 650>

<p>At the end of July, 1996, the United States Court of Appeals
for the Sixth Circuit determined
that CompuServe could sue in Ohio an individual from Texas who
conducted what seems to have
been a small, part-time business only through the Internet and
interacted with CompuServe via
modem.  CompuServe has it corporate headquarters in Ohio.  In
<i>CompuServe v.
Patterson</I>, 89 F.3d 1257 (6th Cir. 1996), the Court dealt with
the question of whether or not
CompuServe could sue one of its subscribers in Ohio -- even
though the subscriber was an
individual (not a large business) from Texas and had never
physically been to Ohio -- but had
visited (so to speak) CompuServe in Ohio by using the Internet. 
The Court had to answer the question, did Ohio's courts have
jurisdiction over the out-of-state subscriber?</p>

<p>How do courts in the U.S. obtain "jurisdiction" over parties
who have a dispute, that is, which court has the
right to decide a particular dispute between those particular
parties?  Most disputes occur
between people located near one another in the same state or who
at least interacted with one
another face-to-face generally in a particular locale, so that it
seems fair to say the court in that
locale should decide their dispute.  But localized interaction
between people is not the norm of
the Internet.  In the U.S., the Due Process Clause of the
Fourteenth Amendment to the United
States Constitution usually determines when and where an
individual may be  subject to a civil
lawsuit in another state.  The basic rule, announced by the U.S.
Supreme Court in 1945 in
<i>International Shoe Co. v. Washington</I>, 326 U.S. 310,
requires examination of the facts of
the case, to determine if the nonresident defendant has
sufficient contacts with the state in which
the suit was filed such that the exercise of jurisdiction by a
court in that state would comport with
"traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice." 
Courts have gone to great lengths to
determine whether a person's activities in a state were enough so
that it would not offend these
<b><i>traditional notions</b></I> to allow an aggrieved party to
haul that person into the courts
of a state where he is not a resident.  The determination was
made based upon (i) whether the
person purposefully availed himself of the privilege of acting in
the foreign state, (ii) whether the
subject of the suit arose from the person's actions in that
foreign state, and (iii) whether the
person's acts (or the consequences thereof) in the state are
sufficient to make it "reasonable" to
bring that person into the foreign court.</p>

<p>But, how then do "traditional notions" apply to something like
the Internet?  Let us return to the decision in <i>CompuServe v.
Patterson</i>.  CompuServe brought suit in its home state of Ohio
against an individual
who lived and worked in Texas and developed shareware apparently
as a side business.  The
Texas software developer sold and marketed his shareware over the
Internet via CompuServe's
shareware service.  He used the CompuServe service by modem from
his home computer in
Texas and he subscribed to CompuServe via that modem connection.  
The Texas shareware
developer also sent several messages to CompuServe through
e-mail, claiming that CompuServe
software products infringed upon his rights.  The e-mail messages
originated from the shareware
developer's desk in Texas and ended up at CompuServe's Ohio
headquarters.  Because the Texas
developer used the CompuServe shareware service, Internet surfers
who downloaded his
software got it off a CompuServe server in Ohio.</p>

<p>CompuServe, in what might be viewed as a preemptive strike,
sued in Ohio for a declaration
by the Ohio court that CompuServe did not violate the Texas
developer's rights.  Obviously, for
the Texas shareware developer to assert those rights (or whatever
rights he may have), he must
either prove his case in Ohio or convince the Ohio court that it
lacks jurisdiction to decide the
issue.  Now that the Court has determined that suit in Ohio is
proper, the Texas shareware developer must now find an Ohio
lawyer and
probably also travel to Ohio in order to protect the rights he
claims to his software.</p>

<p>Incidentally, the Texas shareware developer told the Ohio
trial court that he had never been to Ohio and
that the only connection he had at all to Ohio was the fact that
CompuServe happened to be there. 
Yet, the Court of Appeals found that his electronic visits to
Ohio subjected him to the
jurisdiction of the Ohio courts.  In announcing its decision, the
Court of Appeals stressed that the
Texas shareware developer "consciously reached out from Texas to
Ohio to subscribe to
CompuServe, and to use its service to market his computer
software on the Internet."  Further, it
found that he "originated and maintained contacts with Ohio" when
he e-mailed CompuServe at
its Ohio headquarters concerning his claims.  Finally, the Court
admitted that "it may be
burdensome for [the Texas shareware developer] to defend a suit
in Ohio, but he knew when he
entered into [the agreement] with CompuServe that he was making a
connection with Ohio . . .
."</p>

<p>Obviously, the practical effects of the <i>CompuServe</I>
decision still must play
themselves out.  Courts no doubt will continue to grapple with
similar jurisdictional questions as
our cyber-"visits" from state to state and country to country
continue to grow exponentially.</p>

<p><img src = "fire.gif" height=105 width=85 align=left>The
<i>CompuServe</I> decision tells those who use the Internet for
business (or for
anything that could give rise to a legal claim) that they had
better very carefully consider the
transactions entered into over the Internet, because while the
other side of the world may be only
a mouse-click away, defending an action in a foreign court is an
entirely different matter.</p></font>
