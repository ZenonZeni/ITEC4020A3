Subject: 50 percent increase in electronic surveillance in 1993 <p>

I thought you might find this AP clipping of interest, especially
in the context of the pro-Clipper argument that there's really minimal
eavesdropping going on, despite all the static. <p>

WASHINGTON (AP) -- A nearly 50 percent increase in wiretaps and microphones
aimed at suspected drug traffickers pushed federal eavesdropping to a record
high during the first year of the Clinton administration.
   Overall, electronic monitoring by federal agents grew by almost a third in
1993, the largest increase in a decade, according to figures released by the
Administrative Office for U.S. Courts.
   No single event produced the 1993 increase, federal officials say. Rather,
they attribute it to progress in a decade-long effort to concentrate
investigations on the kingpins of sophisticated drug rings.
   "It takes time to get something in place in any federal agency," said Robert
C. Bonner, who stepped down as head of the Drug Enforcement Administration in
November 1993. "It's like turning a battleship."
   Attorney General Janet Reno said today that drug investigators complained to
her last year that some U.S. attorney's offices had few prosecutors experienced
in wiretap cases. "We've tried to increase the training so people with wiretap
expertise are available throughout the country," she said. "That may be one of
the reasons for the increase."
   Federal court orders approving telephone taps or electronic bugs for
narcotics investigations grew to 333 from 226 the year before.
   The 1993 total of 450 federal surveillance orders was the highest since a
1968 law authorized federal wiretapping. They represented a 32.4 percent
increase over the 340 orders in 1992.
   The last year with a bigger increase in total federal eavesdropping orders
was 1984, when there were 289, or 38.9 percent more than the 208 a year earlier.
Drug enforcement also was the engine then: 1984 was the first full year of work
for a nationwide network of organized crime drug enforcement task forces,
combining the efforts of 11 federal offices.
   "Agents are learning they can use wiretaps effectively in these cases so the
FBI and DEA are doing more and more," said Frederick Hess, head of the Justice
Department office that reviews all federal requests to courts for surveillance
orders.
   Somewhat bigger jumps occur in years when more agents finish long-term
investigations at the same time and begin new ones, Hess added.
   DEA once had "a reputation of concentrating on street-level buy-bust
operations," Bonner said. By late 1991 Bonner formulated and in 1992-3
implemented a strategy of focusing on kingpins of major regional and
international cocaine and heroin rings.
   By late 1993, DEA was operating four times as many drug wiretaps as the FBI
and for first time had more active drug wiretaps than the FBI had in all types
of criminal investigations, Bonner said.
   The FBI, which pioneered investigative attacks on the leadership of criminal
enterprises, particularly with electronic surveillance, brought that expertise
to its first drug investigations in the early 1980s.
   "The DEA and FBI have moved away from drug interdiction because we have more
impact through wiretap and undercover techniques that keep us more informed of
the inner workings of the organizations," said Tom Martin, who heads an FBI
headquarters unit that coordinates drug task forces.
   Among surveillances completed in 1993, a microphone placed inside a New
Jersey lawyer's office in a racketeering case operated for 435 days, overheard
65 people and cost the government $517,673 -- the year's longest and most
expensive federal eavesdropping.
   Hess said it was in the Camden, N.J., office of Salvatore Avena, lawyer to
reputed Philadelphia mob boss John Stanfa. Stanfa, Avena and 22 others were
indicted on racketeering-related charges March 17. The government told the court
the law office was used for meetings, at which the murder of rivals was planned,
"to evade electronic surveillance by fraudulently creating the appearance that
these were legally proper meetings."
   The microphone picked up Avena telling Stanfa in a demonstration of loyalty,
"If you want me to put my brains in the toilet, I'll put my brains in the
toilet," prosecutors said.
   There was a 10 percent decrease in electronic surveillance by state and local
law officers during 1993, from 579 to 526. New York, with 204 state court
orders, New Jersey, with 121, and Pennsylvania, with 61, accounted for 73
percent of the state surveillances. <p>
