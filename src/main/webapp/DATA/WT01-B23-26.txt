<p><b>VIII. THE PUBLIC DISCOVERS THE TRUTH ABOUT MARIJUANA</b></p>

<hr>

<p>&nbsp;We need not belabor the point, but sometime after 1965
the wisdom of the marijuana laws suddenly became dinner-table
conversation in most American middle-class homes along with the
Indochina war and campus dissent. Many sons and daughters, and
even mothers and fathers, of the middle class had tried the drug,
and those who had not were certainly familiar with
&quot;pot&quot; and the law. The medical profession finally
commenced a research effort to determine who was right-the user
who said the drug was a harmless pleasant euphoriant or the
lawmakers, who by their actions had condemned it as a noxious
cause of crime, addiction and insanity. <br>
</p>

<p>A. Marijuana and the Masses </p>

<p>Although marijuana arrests arid seizures hit their all-time
low point in 1960,1 the middle and late sixties witnessed a
revolution in marijuana use. Vast numbers of people have recently
adopted the drug as their principal euphoriant; however, by all
estimates, the new users are the sons and daughters of the middle
class, not the ethnic minorities and ghetto residents formerly
associated with marijuana.2 Student marijuana use is now so
common that it has been associated in the public eye with the
overall campus life style.3 Accompanying the growth of widespread
marijuana use on campus has been an increasing experimentation
with the drug by intellectuals, professors, young professionals
and members of several other social groups who would never have
considered using the drug ten years ago.4 </p>

<p>Dr. Stanley F. Yolles, former Director of the National
Institute of Mental Health, testifying before a Senate
subcommittee, said, &quot;A conservative estimate of persons in
the United States, both Juvenile and adult, who have used
marihuana, at least once, is about 8 million and may be as high
as 12 million people.&quot;5 Other estimates have run as high as
twenty to twenty-five million users.6 This vast increase in the
number of people using marijuana seems to have begun in the early
and middle sixties. It is likely that this new use pattern was
initially precipitated by the publicity surrounding the LSD
experimentation of Doctors Alpert and Leary at Harvard in 1963.7
As a growing segment of the academic fringe began to preach
consciousness-expansion, students began to find marijuana
available on campus. From that point the phenomenon snowballed.
As more novice marijuana users reported no ill effects from its
use, more students tried it, and in turn those who used and
enjoyed the drug began to &quot;turn on&quot; those who had not.
By 1970, some campuses reported that over seventy percent of the
student body were users.8 More recently, marijuana use spread
beyond the student subculture; reportedly its use has become
common even among young professionals on Wall Street.9 Moreover,
since it is readily available and widely used in Vietnam,
marijuana has become popular with many soldiers.10 </p>

<p>10 D. LOURIA, THE DRUG SCENE 10 (1968). </p>

<p>The general public is clearly aware that there has been both a
vast increase in the number of users and a shift from lower- to
middle-class use of the drug. These great changes in the nature
of marijuana use have had important social consequences. First,
with the sharp rise in the number of users and the tendency of
marijuana users to share common life styles and often political
opinions, the drug has become associated ill the past few years
with a major counter-culture, Many proponents of that
counter-culture have contended that the illegal status of
marijuana -which puts large numbers of people oil the wrong side
of the criminal law-is the most significant unifying and
recruiting agent for the New Left and the other political and
social causes of the late sixties.&quot; Some New Left leaders
have gone so far as to oppose reduction in the penalties for
marijuana possession because they feel severe penalties aid their
recruiting ends by making marijuana users outraged against a
society that overacts so strongly to a nonexistent danger.&quot;
We feel the general disrespect for marijuana laws may be causing
a dangerous disrespect for all laws in a sizeable segment of the
population. The credibility of government suffers on all issues
when its handling of the use of this drug seems to so many so far
removed from reality. This opinion is supported by the increasing
medical evidence that the dangers of tile drug are de minimus. </p>

<p>Secondly, the new middle-class use of marijuana has induced
the first significant medical inquiry into the nature of the
drug; has spawned increasing numbers of challenges to the
constitutionality of marijuana laws and penalties, and has
spurred the passage of more lenient legislation. </p>

<p>One commentator has stated: </p>

<p>Nobody cared when it was a ghetto problem. Marijuana -well, it
was used by jazz musicians or the lower class, so you didn't care
if they got 2-to-20 years. But when a nice, middle-class girl or
boy in college gets busted for the same thing, then the whole
community sits up and takes notice. And that's the name of the
game today. The problem has begun to come home to roost-in all
strata of society, in suburbs, in middle-class homes, in the
colleges, suddenly, the punitive, vindictive approach was
touching- all classes of society. And now the most exciting thing
that's really happening is the change in attitude by the people.
Now we have a willingness to examine the problem, as to whether
it's an experimentation, or an illness rather than &quot;an
evil.&quot; With this change I think we can come to a more
rational approach to methods of drug control.13 </p>

<p>Without doubt, the new class of users has successfully
demanded more favorable attention from the legislatures and the
courts than the lower class could have attracted. In fact, even
the slightest circumscription of the reach of a state marijuana
law is now national news.14 </p>

<p>A third result of the widespread use of marijuana has been a
substantial challenge to the traditional picture of the national
marijuana trade. Over the past three decades, law enforcement
officials continued to convince legislators that the traffic in
marijuana was controlled by professional criminals.15 Confronted
with this portrait of the marijuana trade, legislators naturally
stereotyped the &quot;seller&quot; as the vicious criminal
pushing his wares for high profit and felt that extraordinarily
harsh penalties were justified for sellers.16 From several recent
studies it appears that the structure of marijuana traffic bears
little or no relation to the traditional stereotype. In a recent
survey of 204 users it was found that 44 percent had sold to
friends at least once. Many casual users sell to leave themselves
enough profit to cover the amount of their own use. 17 The study
further finds that even at the very top, profits are too small
and the product too bulky to interest the criminal class that
probably underwrites sales of heroin and other &quot;hard
drugs.&quot; 18 Thus even at the top, amateurs-composed generally
of the students, young professionals and soldiers who constitute
the users-are the main source of the drug.19 It is also important
to note that marijuana is typically sold by the ounce20 rather
than by the cigarette as was traditionally assumed. Thus, even
the relatively casual experimenter was likely to have at least an
ounce of the drug in his possession. </p>

<p><font size="4"><b>B. Enforcement of the Marijuana Laws:
1960-1970</b></font> </p>

<p>As a result of the rapid spread of marijuana use, full
enforcement of the marijuana laws has become impossible.21 By
1967 the Federal Bureau of Narcotics had 299 agents, roughly 50
more than in 1956.22 In the same period the use of marijuana
probably increased 1,000 fold. It seems obvious from both FBN
statistics and the best available state and local statistics that
two enforcement patterns emerged in the sixties: concentration on
&quot;sellers&quot; and selective enforcement. </p>

<p>Since 1960 the FBN and major state and municipal narcotic
squads have concentrated on the larger sellers. In the early
sixties this trend was less pronounced,23 but by 1968 the
Commissioner of the FBN said that 75 percent of federal marijuana
arrests were of dealers and that even the remaining 25 percent
were sellers but were charged with possession as a result of plea
bargains. Statistics from California show the same concentration
on sellers nevertheless the California bureau found that most of
these sellers were young and first offenders.26 Thus, at least by
1968 it became clear that sellers were quite often neophytes. </p>

<p>At the same time that the police have abandoned full
enforcement for concentration on dealers, enforcement of the laws
has remained necessarily haphazard and somewhat selective. Since
marijuana use has become so common, there are certain student and
hippy communities in which the police could arrest nearly
everyone. Here the problem of selective enforcement necessarily
arises-the police arrest those they dislike for other reasons,
either political disagreement or suspicion of use of other drugs.
This inevitable practice, although perhaps not consciously
planned, has brought outcry from some victimized communities.27
This policy-if not a policy by the police at least a perception
by the hippies-of selective enforcement has provided them
increased impetus toward the anti-establishment life style they
have adopted. Their attitude is aggravated when the police engage
in particularly aggressive tactics, such as use of informers, to
trap the offenders. 28 </p>

<p>By 1970, the unenforceability of the marijuana laws was most
clearly evidenced by the failure of President Nixon's Operation
Intercept which was designed to seal off the Mexican border and
the supply of marijuana coming into the United States from
Mexico.29 Both national and international tensions led to the
failure of the &quot;Noble Experiment.&quot; By now, the
marijuana trade is so scattered and at the same time so
fragmented (with no real hierarchy in the trade) that the
unenforceability of these laws has reached Prohibition
proportions.<br>
</p>

<p><b>C. Emergence of Medical Opinion</b> </p>

<p>One of the most significant causes of widespread middle-class
use of marijuana was the lack of any medical proof of the
allegedly evil effects of its use. In fact, what authoritative
studies had been conducted up to this time were inconsistent with
the assumptions underlying anti-marijuana legislation. In this
situation, users viewed themselves as experimenters with a mild
euphoriant, not criminals endangering themselves or society at
large. The inevitable consequence was increased medical inquiry
into the effects of the drug, beginning in about 1967.31 </p>

<p>Concurrently, the National Institute of Mental Health
significantly Increased its funding for grants and contracts for
marijuana research.32 </p>

<p>Despite this intensified inquiry, uncertainty about the
effects of the drug persists. There are several major research
obstacles responsible for continued absence of reliable research.
After outlining the impediments to conclusive findings, we shall
extract from the existing studies the present state of medical
knowledge. </p>

<p><b>1. Research Obstacles</b> </p>

<p>The major obstacle is the nature of the marijuana plant
itself. Marijana is a derivative of the plant Cannabis Sativa,
commonly denoted the hemp plant. It is classified as a dioecious
plant, that is, the male reproductive parts are on one individual
plant and the female parts are on another. The differentiation of
the male and female plants is exceedingly significant because the
chemical compounds responsible for the euphoric effect of
marijuana are found primarily in the sticky resin that covers the
unfertilized female flowers and adjacent leaves. The male plant
may contain a small amount of this active resin, but it is grown
mainly for hemp fiber.33 </p>

<p>The hemp plant yields three rough grades of intoxicating
substances, the least potent of which is &quot;marijuana.&quot;
34 Yet, because the classifications are imprecise, confusion is
engendered by attributing to &quot;marijuana&quot; the effects
produced by the excessive use of the more potent forms of
cannabis.35 In addition, the psychic potency of the plant differs
depending upon where the marijuana is grown, 36 and upon
cultivation variables such as occurrence of fertilization and
time of harvesting: </p>

<p><br>
</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>If the male plants are not removed and fertilization
    occurs, the female plants which carry the main intoxicating
    properties are considerably weakened in that respect. In
    addition, unless harvesting is carried out immediately before
    the blossoming of the flowers there is further weakening and
    variation in the potency of the produce.37 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is interesting to note in this connection that the
marijuana used in the United States is among the weakest in the
world.38 These factors frustrate the creation of a standardized
dosage in any given experiment and preclude the comparison of the
results of independent studies.39 </p>

<p>In addition to the problems engendered by the great variance
in potency and dosage, meaningful marijuana research also
inhibited by differences in means of consumption. Since
standardized doses are generally considered impossible if the
drug is smoked,40 most studies, including the La Guardia Report,
are based upon oral administration of marijuana to the subjects.
Yet smoking is the method of consumption among nearly all
American users. Furthermore, standardized dosage is not even
assured by the oral method since &quot;little is known about the
gastrointestinal absorption of the highly water-soluble
cannabinals in man.&quot; 41 Finally, &quot;there is considerable
indirect evidence from users that the quality of the intoxication
is different when marijuana or its preparations are ingested
rather than smoked. In particular, ingestion seems to cause more
powerful effects . . . . &quot; 42 </p>

<p>2. Current Medical Knowledge </p>

<p>It is perhaps best to begin with the medical data concerning
the traditional allegations about marijuana. </p>

<p>(a) The Myths.-First, it is universally accepted among medical
authorities that marijuana is not physically habit-forming.43
Although some researchers have asserted that a psychological
dependence may result from continued use of the drug, this
hypothesis has not been established and its relevance has been
questioned. One authority has noted that &quot;habituation to
marihuana is not as strong as to tobacco or to alcohol.&quot; 44
Another has commented that &quot;[a] psychological dependence and
desire for the drug may occur, but this is inconsistent and is
not uncontrollable.... Perhaps the dependence is even less than
the dependence on cigarettes.&quot; 45 </p>

<p>Second, there is no evidence whatsoever that the use of
marijuana has a direct relationship to the commission of crime.
One commentator has noted that &quot; during the high the
marihuana user may say things he would not ordinarily say, but he
generally will not do things that are foreign to his nature. If
he is not normally a criminal, he will not commit a crime under
the influence of the drug.&quot; 46 In fact, it is entirely
likely that the characteristic passive reaction to the use of
marijuana tends to inhibit criminality. A recent study has shown
that juvenile &quot;potheads&quot; tend to be nonaggressive and
to stay away from trouble.47 Similarly, there is no scientific
evidence for the proposition that marijuana is an aphrodisiac. It
has been suggested to the contrary that the most potent form of
cannabis, pure ganja, has the reverse effect, being taken by
Indian priests to quell the libido.48 </p>

<p>Finally, the evidence is at best inconclusive regarding the
contention that use of marijuana leads to the use of
&quot;hard&quot; narcotics. Some of the early studies claiming to
have established a valid connection were scientifically
unreliable. One authority has observed in this regard: </p>

<p><br>
</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Supposedly scientific studies of this problem have been
    conducted in the past, such as the one done in a deprived
    area of a large city where the use of heroin was widespread,
    and indicating that many users of marijuana went on to the
    use of more hazardous drugs. I am sure that without previous
    marijuana, the use of such drugs in that environment would be
    just as high, and that if such a study were done on a college
    population, it would be found that the subsequent use of
    &quot;hard&quot; drugs would be negligible.49 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Referring to a presidential task force investigation, another
authoritv has commented: </p>

<p><br>
</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>It is true that the Federal study showed that among heroin
    users about 50% had had experience with marijuana- the study
    also found, however, that most of the heroin addicts had been
    users of alcohol and tobacco. There is no evidence that
    marijuana is more likely than alcohol or tobacco to lead to
    the use of narcotics.50 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>On the basis of the available information, most authorities
have concluded that there is no scientific basis for the theory
that the use of marijuana is a causal factor in the use of
&quot;hard&quot; narcotics.51 In any event, as a matter of common
sense, it would appear that the phenomenon in dispute is very
complex, including both individual personality features and
environmental factors. As one commentator put it &quot;Several of
the studies indicate that the precious statistics have been
misleading and exaggerated.&quot; Whether or not the proposition
can be scientifically established, there is probably a slightly
greater chance that an individual who has used marijuana could go
on to opiates, but statistically this is not . . . an important
social consideration.&quot;52 </p>

<p>Thus, it appears that none of the traditional allegations
about marijuana has been scientifically established, that its
alleged addictive qualities have been disproved, and that the
overwhelming weight of authority disputes its allegedly crime
producing and stepping stone tendencies. We will now briefly
survey the medically recognized effects of the drug, physical,
psychomotor and psychological. </p>

<p>(b) Physical Effects.-The acute physical effects of marijuana
are the subject of much debate. Various studies have reached
different conclusions. Nearly all authorities, however, are in
agreement that the bodily symptoms accompanying the
&quot;high&quot; are very slight. The most commonly noted effects
are a slight rise in blood pressure, conjunctival vascular
congestion, slight elevation in blood sugar, urinary frequency
and an increase in pulse rate.53 In general, these acute symptoms
are relatively short-lived, and there are no known lasting
physical effects.54 On the other hand, there is evidence that
prolonged smoking could lead to &quot;marijuana bronchitis,&quot;
and that communal smoking has the tendency to encourage the
spread of communicable diseases. </p>

<p>(c) Psychomotor Effects.-Varying results have also been
reported in studies of the acute effects of marijuana upon
psychomotor functions. Although the researchers have sometimes
found some slight impairment in performance tests,55 there is
apparently no general depressing or stimulating effect on the
nervous system and no influence on speech and coordination.56 In
the most recent study, Doctors Well, Zinberg and Nelson of the
Boston University School of Medicine found that marijuana users
are able to compensate nearly 100 percent for whatever adverse
effects may result on ordinary psychomotor performance. 57 </p>

<p>Such findings suggest that marijuana is not likely to be a
causal factor in driving accidents, a hypothesis that is
supported by a recent simulated driving test comparing the
performance of subjects under the influence of marijuana and
alcohol.58 There seems to be no contention in the medical field
that there are any lasting effects from marijuana in the
psychomotor area. The Well study reported that noticeable effects
&quot;were diminished between 30 minutes and I hour, and they
were largely dissipated 3 hours after the end of smoking. No
delayed or persistent effects beyond 3 hours were observed or
reported.&quot; 59 </p>

<p>(d) Psychological Effects.-The acute psychological effects of
the use of marijuana are more complex. At the outset, it can be
stated with certainty that &quot;marijuana is definitely
distinguishable from other hallucinogenic drugs such as LSD, MIT,
mescaline, peyote, and psilocybin. Although it produces some of
the same effects, it is far less potent than these other drugs.
It does not alter consciousness to nearly so great an extent as
they do nor does It lead to increasing tolerance to the drug
dosage.&quot; 60 Furthermore, the subjective effects of cannabis
are dependent upon the personality of the user, his expectations,
and the circumstances under which the drug is taken, as well as
learning to smoke marijuana properly.61 </p>

<p>There is general agreement about the pleasurable psychological
effects. Users uniformly experience greatly enhanced
perception-whether real or delusory-of visual, auditory, taste
and touch effects, increased sense of humor or hilarity, feelings
of well-being or wonderment, and distorted time and space
perceptions.62 In this connection, it is interesting to note that
even the pleasurable phenomena are dependent on individual
circumstances, particularly ivlicii the drug is taken for the
first time. Many, if not most, people do not become
&quot;high&quot; on their first exposure to marijuana, even if it
is smoked correctly.63 The probable explanation for this curious
phenomenon is that repeated exposure to marijuana reduces
psychological inhibition, as part of, or as a result of, a
learning process.64 </p>

<p>Medical knowledge is most tentative with reference to adverse
psychological effects. Recent studies, however, have vehemently
disputed an earlier tendency to attribute psychoses and severe
panic reactions to marijuana use.65 As Dr. Well has noted: </p>

<p><br>
</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Because reliable information about the acute effects of
    marijuana has been as scarce within the medical profession as
    without, many of these reactions have been misinterpreted and
    incorrectly treated. For example, simple panic states, which
    doubtless would be properly diagnosed in other circumstances,
    are often called &quot;toxic psychoses&quot; when doctors
    elicit immediate histories of marijuana use.66 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Medical experts now generally agree that the possibility of
depression, panic and psychoses depends entirely on the
circumstances of use and the personality of the user.67 In his
most recent study, Dr. Weil concluded that &quot;serious adverse
reactions are uncommon in the 'normal' population,&quot;68 but
noted three exceptions. First, simple depressive reactions which
rarely occur in regular users may occur in novices who approach
their initial use ambivalently.69 Second, the most frequent
adverse reaction is apprehension, more often described as
anxiety, and sometimes reaching a degree of panic. Again, such
reactions are closely related to the attitude of the user and to
the social setting.70 The social setting also influences the
frequency of panic reactions, suggesting again that this
phenomenon correlates with the degree of reluctance with which
people approach initial use of the drug: </p>

<p><br>
</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>In a community where marijuana has been accepted as a
    recreational intoxicant, they may be extremely rare (for
    example, one per cent of all responses to the drug). On the
    other hand, at a rural Southern college, where
    experimentation with the drug may represent a much greater
    degree of social deviance, 25 per cent of persons trying it
    for the first time may become panicked.71 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The panicked person normally believes that he is either dying
or losing his mind, and simple reassurance will end most such
reactions.72 The reaction normally is short-lived, but it may be
prolonged by an attitude encouraging the underlying fears.73 In
short, &quot;panic reactions . . . seem more nonpharmacologic
than pharmacologic.&quot;74 </p>

<p>Third, psychotic reactions occur rarely, if at all, in normal
users,75 and occur mainly in persons with a low psychosis
threshold or a history of psychosis76 or hallucinogenic drug
experimentation.77 Even in such cases, marijuana is a precipitant
rather than a primary cause of this type of reaction 78 which
lasts at most a day or two.79 <br>

<p>25 The state of California has kept excellent statistics since
1959. In 1968. as a typical year of the late sixties, the police
seized over 30,000,000 grams of marijuana of all kinds in only
10,000 arrests. The larger amount seized relative to the number
of arrests seems to indicate the concentration on dealers. BUREAU

<p>30 One commentator has charged that those most knowledgeable
about marijuana have &quot;dodged&quot; the topic. Kaplan, The
Special Case of Marihuana (Or, It's the Doctor's Fault), 9 J.
CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 349, 351 (1969). </p>

<p>31 At the end of 1968 there existed only four known studies on
human subjects conducted by Americans. See Weil, Zinberg &amp;
Nelson, Clinical and Psychological Effects of Marihuana in Man,
162 SCIENCE 1234, 1235 (1968) [hereinafater cited as Weil Study].
The previous lack of concern with marijuana call also be observed
by 211 examination of the number of articles appearing in medical
periodicals. During the decade between 1942 and 1951, only six
articles dealing with the subject are listed in the index for
medical journals. Eleven reports were noted as being published in
the next ten years. From 1962 to 1966, an average of three
materials per year were available. It was not until 1967 that the
subject became of sufficient interest to occupy the time of a
reasonable number of medical authors. In that year, eleven
articles appeared in medical periodicals. By 1968, this number
had increased to 30, and in 1969 more than 60 articles dealing
with the topic of human marijuana consumption have appeared. In
other words, more than three times the number of articles
appeared in the last three years than in the 25 preceding years. </p>

<p>32 In Fiscal year 1967, NIMH obligated $786,000 for marihuana
research grants and contracts. Comparable figures for 1968 and
1969 respectively were S1,239,000 and $1,330,000. In Fiscal year
1970, if funds are available, the institute proposes to obligate
$2,550,000 to support grant and contract studies of marihuana,
which means that there will have been a more than three-fold
increase for support of these studies in the last four
years.&quot; Statement by Dr. Roger 0. Egcberg, Assistant
Secretary for Health and Scientific Affairs, M.S. Dep't of HEW,

Representatives (mimeographed press release). </p>

<p>34 The three substances are charas-pure unadulterated resin
that has been scraped from the leaves and flowering tops of the
female plant; hashish or ganja-an agglomeration of female
flowering tops and stems with whatever resin is attached to their
surfaces, thought to contain about 40% resin; and marijuana-a low
potency preparation consisting of dried mature leaves and
flowering tops of both male and female plants, thought to contain
between 5 and 8% resin. Schwarz, Toward a Medical Understanding
of Marihuana, 14 CAN. PSYCHIATRIC ASS'N J. 591, 592 (1969). </p>

<p>35 As long as the term marihuana is used indiscriminately to
refer to cannabis of all kinds and potencies, confusion will
continue. . . . In this country some of the vigorous opponents of
marihuana seem to foster this confusion by attributing to any use
of marihuana the effects produced primarily by the excessive use
of the more potent forms of cannabis in an attempt to preserve a
strongly negative public image of marihuana. </p>

<p>H. NOWLIS, DRUGS ON THE COLLEGE CAMPUS 93 (1969). </p>

<p>36 &quot;The major botanical feature of the plant is the
extreme variability in its appearance, characteristics and
properties when grown in different geographical and climatic
condition.&quot; Schwarz, supra note 34, at 591. In the United
States and Mexico, for example, the production of the more potent
forms is relatively uncommon, and there appears to be no demand
for them. J. ROSEVEAR, POT: A HANDBOOK OF MARIHUANA 31-33 (1967).
</p>

<p>37 Schwarz, supra note 34, at 592. </p>

<p>38 Zunin, Marijuana: The Drug and the Problem, 134 MILITARY
MED. 104, M. 7 (1969). According to the author, several factors
contribute to this phenomenal: (1) The amount of resin found in
the flowering tops markedly decreases as the plants are grown in
more temperate areas. It is estimated that the resin content of
Indian cannabis is 20%; Mexican 15% or less; that grown in
Kentucky 8%; and that found in Wisconsin 6% or less. </p>

<p>(2) The activity of the resin in the female is greatly reduced
if fertilized by the male. In this country, because of an
inability to distinguish between the two plants, inattention to
cultivation and lack of knowledge, the female plants are
fertilized. (3) The resinous content is highest prior to
&quot;going to seed&quot; of the female plant. The marijuana in
this country has gone to seed prior to harvesting. </p>

<p>(4) The male plant contains little or no resin content. In
this country, the male plant is indiscriminately mixed with the
female plant in the final preparation. </p>

<p>(5) The most active portion of the plant is the flowering top.
In this country, preparations of marijuana are composed primarily
of leaves, twigs, and seeds which are crushed. </p>

<p>(6) The potency of marijuana decreases with time. It is
reduced at the end of one year, markedly reduced at the end of
two years, and nonexistent at the end of three years. In
addition, it keeps better in cold, dry climates. Most of the
marijuana in the United States is several months to several years
old by the time it has been harvested and has passed through the
smuggling operation. </p>

<p>39 Given the above variations in the plant and in its products
and extracts, together with the continuing ignorance of its
chemistry it is not surprising that it is virtually impossible to
make direct comparisons between the various studies on the
effects on human beings who are even more individually variable. </p>

<p>Schwarz, supra note 34, at 593. </p>

<p>Recently. what is believed to be the active ingredient in
marijuana has been isolated and synthesized. However, this
substance denominated (THC), is only available for research in
very limited quantities. Weil Study Furthermore, it has not been
proven that THC is the sole ingredient contributing to the
effects caused by marijuana. </p>

<p>40 &quot;[M]any pharmacologists dismiss the possibility of
giving marihuana by smoking because, they sav, the dose cannot he
standardized.&quot; Weil Study 1235. </p>

<p>43 &quot;-There is now an abundance of evidence that marihuana
is not an addictive drug. Cessation of its use produces no
withdrawal symptoms, nor does a user feel any need to increase
the dosage as he becomes accustomed to the drug.&quot; Grinspoon,

of the La Guardia Report that marijuana is not a direct causal
factor in criminal misconduct, but that the &quot;high&quot;
leads to sociable attitudes. </p>

marijuana has a tendency to produce drowsiness, it is difficult
to see how it could lead to an act of violent sex. J. ROSEVEAR,

have also been reported, but it is felt that these symptoms are
mainly the result of oral administration. Grinspoon, supra note
43, at 20. Increased appetite and dryness of the mouth are also
said to be common. </p>

<p>54 Usually the reports of chronic ill effects are to be found
in Eastern studies of individuals using the stronger hashish or
pure resinous substances over prolonged periods of time and are
complicated by the immeasurable effects of many other social,
economic, personality and cultural factors. Schwarz, supra note
34, at 595. </p>

<p>55 Tests by Robert S. Morrow in the 1930's revealed that even
large doses of marijuana did not affect performances on tests of
the speed of tapping or the quickness of response to simple
stimuli. Grinspoon, supra note 43, at 20. &quot;The drug did
affect steadiness of the hand and body and the reaction time for
complex stimuli.&quot; Id. The most recent study in this area was
done by Andrew Weil, Norman Zinberg and Judith Nelson of the
Boston University School of Medicine. Their conclusions were that
regular users of marijuana may show some slight degree of
impairment in performance tests, but that the aptitude of the
subjects may even improve slightly after smoking marijuana. Weil
Study 1242. Marijuana-naive subjects tended to show some
impairment in performance. Id. </p>

<p>57 We were struck by the difficulty of recognizing when a
subject is high unless he tells you that he is . . . . It seems
possible to ignore the effects of marihuana on consciousness, to
adapt to them, and to control them to a significant degree. Id. </p>

&quot;unlike alcohol drinkers, most pot smokers studiously avoid
driving while high.&quot; J. ROSEVEAR, supra note 36, at 135. </p>

<p>64 &quot;The subjective responses of our subjects indicate
that they had imagined a marihuana effect to be much more
profoundly disorganizing than what they, experienced.&quot; Weil
Study 1241. This subjective control over the effects extended as
far as the reporting of no effects when in actuality the subject
had received a large dose. Id. 65 Grinspoon, supra note 43, at

<p>68 Weil, supra note 66, at 997. </p>

<p>69 Marihuana depressions I have seen have occurred mainly in
obsessive-compulsive persons who are ambivalent about trying the
drug or who invested the decision to experience marihuana with
great emotional meaning. In interviewing these patients, I have
thought that they used marihuana as an excuse for letting
themselves be depressed, not that their depressions were
psycho-pharmacological. </p>

<p>Id. at 998. </p>

<p>70 Dr. Weil has stated that &quot;panic reactions occurred
most often among novice users of marijuana-frequently older
persons who are ambivalent about trying the drug in the first
place.&quot; N.Y. Times, May 1, 1970, at 18C, col. 2.<br>
</p>

<p>71 Id. These panic reactions may emulate acute psychoses in
hospital emergency wards &quot;where the patient may feel
overwhelmed, helpless and unable to communicate his
distress.&quot; Weil, supra note 66, at 998. </p>

<p>75 Dr. Weil is of the opinion that &quot;all adverse reactions
to marihuana should be considered panic reactions until proven
otherwise,&quot; id. at 998, and that he has never seen a toxic
psychosis following the smoking of marijuana by a normal user.
